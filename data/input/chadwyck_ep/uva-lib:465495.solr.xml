      <field name="fulltext">[Is worthy Mollineux now fall'n asleep] Is worthy Mollineux now fall'n asleep, In true Contentedness, and Silence deep? Her Noble Blessed Soul yet lives above, I'th' Everlasting Bliss, i'th' Father's Love; Where she doth rest, whilst we our selves bemoan Our Loss of her, in Vertue so well known. And still her Memory remains alive I'th' Hearts of all her Friends, which do survive; Who knew her Vert'ous Mind, Life, Words, and Way, That from her tender Youth, she did not stray From Wisdom's Voice and Dictates in her Heart; Whereby she was enabled to impart Some Fruits thereof, while she was very Young, To such as saw to what it did belong: The tender Noble Seed of Grace and Truth Did freely spring, when she was in her Youth; And grew in her, as she increas'd in Years, Bringing forth Fruit, as by her Book appears: Of which, a Testimony rests behind, As they that Read her Lines may fully find. She did not strive, nor glory, to appear In Gifts or Parts, but still to live in Fear; Whence Wisdom's known to have a true Beginning, And in the same she made a Faithful Ending. T. R. A few Words more, in Remembrance of my dear Wife, M. M. Tho' it may seem to some that read my Lines As a delightful thing, because their Minds Still their Enjoyments have; yet they must know No lasting Joys remain in things below. The Sythe of Time, Death, parteth Friend from Friend, But to true Friendship cannot put an end; Though Friends surviving Exercise may find, Whose Friend's remov'd, whilst they remain behind. My Friend, my Friend, my dearest Friend, my Wife, The greatest Joy and Comfort of my Life, In Visibles, is now remov'd from me: Though, as one destitute of Hope, I see No cause to Mourn for her; but sure I may Be, for my Loss, concern'd: Yet this can say, The Lord hath giv'n, the Lord hath took again, High Praises still be to his Glorious Name, Though mine's the Loss, hers is the Endless Gain. Although to me my Loss to bear is hard, Yet am I from Repining quite debarr'd; The Lord doth with his Goodness so supply, My Soul shall ever Praise him, till I die. Bless'd be the Day, wherein my Love abounded, At first to her, and Friendship firm was Founded In our United Hearts; my Faithful Friend! Friendship 'twixt thee and me shall never end. She was my Wife for full Ten Years, (alas, Short time!) which we in tender Love did pass Endearingly, which in our Hearts was sow'n, Some time before, by the Eternal One; Which, living in our Bosoms, did increase, Until the time of her deplor'd decease, And now's as fresh as ever. Surely she, Who wrote of Friendship, Love's extream degree, (Although with Life, her Pen was much sublim'd, Yet) did not, as her Bosom held it, find Words, half sufficient, fully to declare The Faithful Love she to her Friend did bear. True, Tender-hearted, in Affection kind, Exceeding diligent, and much inclin'd All for to serve in Love; but much more me, To whom she had comply'd my Wife to be. She to the Age of Thirty-Four Years stay'd A Modest, Chaste, Reserv'd, Ingenious Maid; Who did not only write of Modesty, (In Words profound) and spotless Chastity, But in Example was, as well as Words, A Pattern in the same: Wherein accords Her Life, Works, Writings, Words, true, lovely, sweet, Which in concinnate Harmony did meet. And as she wrote of Worship, Truth, and Zeal, With Courage bold for God, she did not fail; Being by his Arm upheld, when deeply prov'd, To stand a Faithful Witness: For she lov'd The Praise of God, more than the Praise of Men; Therefore was more to him, seem'd less to them That did not choose his Fear: Wherein she found Wisdom to stop their Mouths, their Wits confound; Though of the chief in Babel's Learning, they Stood as amaz'd, and knew not what to say. A Bishop of two Counties Diocess Her Question'd, she Reply'd, he proved this: His Chaplain then (the Master's Cause to mend) Attempting to Dispute, was foyl'd i'th' end; Whose Brother (being Lawyer) present cry'd, Her Learning made her mad; when she reply'd, He, as asham'd, and Speechless, turn'd aside. Thus Three great Learned Men, of subtil Wit, (To Silence put) did in One Hour submit T'a little Woman, crown'd with Wisdom's Bays, Who, in God's Fear, did celebrate his Praise; Declaring boldly 'gainst that Worship, which God ne'er set up, that makes its Merchants Rich. She lov'd the precious Truth, (plac'd in her Heart) For which she was Imprison'd; but the smart Its Adversaries felt: For Joy to her Thereby accru'd, who did its Cause prefer Before all Transitories. And, when I Was Prisoner for the same, it was my Joy, That she great Exercise did nobly bear, Therein rejoycing in God's Holy Fear: Though for her sake, Grief pierced oft my Mind, Where I the sense did of her Suffering find, So deep, that from mine Eyes my Sleep withdrew, And secret Tears did frequently pursue: Yea, without Outward Notice, once was I, When she was, by Distemper, like to die, Made sensible thereof, though in the Goal, Distant near Forty Miles, and did Condole; And for her to the Lord I pray'd, whose Ear Was open, and through Prison-Walls did hear: And he releas'd her from her Malady, And me from Prison, her again to see; Though then Confin'd, as firm as Men could tye; Praises be to God's Name Eternally. She sweetly wrote of Charity Divine, Which in her Heart and Life did clearly shine More bright, than in her Words; which did extend, In her, to Poor and Rich, to Foe and Friend: To all in plainness she, with due respect, Would freely shew her Sense; but to reflect 'Gainst any, being absent, did eschew; Charity taught her better things to do. To any, in Affliction, she was free Advice to give, or help with Remedy, Where her Endeavours could; which God did bless, Remarkably, with the desir'd success: Yea, sometimes, when Physitians had been try'd, Much Money paid, and still the Cure deny'd To their Performance, she in freeness gave What, from Distempers dreadful, prov'd to save. But Charity in her did farther move Her tender Heart, in Sympathizing Love, To use her Tongue or Pen, a Word to give To Minds in Exercise; which did Relieve, Convince, or Satisfie, and Strengthen some, The Race of Vertue in their time to run: For which, some have good Cause to bless the Name Of God, from whom those Words with Vertue came. This is not writ to Magnifie her Praise, The Praise belongs to God, who first did raise Her Mind, from things below, to seek his Truth, Hid in her Heart, in time of tender Youth; Which, truly sought, she found, and prized more Than Ophir's Gold, or Pearls of Indian-Shoar. This taught her to discern the Way of God, From Ways of Men; this made her love his Rod: This gave her knowledge of her Duty right Unto the Lord; this gave her also sight Into the Properties of needful things, Of many kinds, that Mortals comfort brings: This gave her, in her tender Years, to see The frail Estate of poor Mortality; The Sense whereof she daily did retain, Striving, with earnest diligence, to gain The precious Pearl of Immortality, As if she knew how short her Time should be; In hope of which, when painful Death assail'd Her Mortal Part, her Courage never fail'd; But did (with Sense as sound as ever) shew Her true Content, and Satisfaction too, To leave this World, of true Felicity, To be possess'd to all Eternity. O may, with me, her Off-spring still remain In God's pure Fear, Eternal Life to gain: Then, this short time once past, we may in Peace, Live with the Just, where Joys shall never cease; Where we, with her, may Living Praises sing For ever, to the Lord, the Heavenly King. Henry Mollineux. TO THE READER. The Author of this Miscellaneous Grove, Was Fruitful both in Vertue and in Love: Read but the following Lines, and thou may'st find, She was the Mistress of a Noble Mind; A Soul, of more than common size, possess'd Her almost (I had said) too narrow Breast. True to her Friend, as plainly doth appear, In dealing plainly with her Friend so dear: She us'd no Gilded Baits, no Flattery, No feigned Words, but plain Sincerity; Which doth bespeak her Love, and Vertue too, Contended one the other to out-do. In Numbers sweet, her warbling Pen hath try'd Unerring Truth from Error to divide: Her Lines, thus measur'd, have successful been, To turn the wand'ring Mind to search within; Where that Invaluable Treasure lies, Unsought by most, discover'd to the Wise; But yet conceal'd and hid from Vult'rous Eyes. 'Tis not the common way, I must confess, To write in Verse; although 'tis ne'ertheless To be esteem'd; because some do disdain, And undervalue what they can't attain: I'd have such unadvised ones to know, Their Genius perches on a lower Bough, For want of Wings their untun'd Souls to raise Unto a Pitch of Harmony and Praise. Oft have I seen the Lark upon the Wing, Toward the Sun ascend, and sweetly Sing; As if she had a Tribute due to pay Unto the mighty Ruler of the Day, In well-composed Songs of tuneful Breath, Such as the Swan repeats before her Death. Thus was our Author's Noble Faculty Employ'd, to render thanks, in Melody, To Him, from whom she did her Life receive; To Him, who never sparingly doth give To them that, to his Praise, his Gifts do use, And with his Blessings don't the World abuse. 'Tis such as these unto the Well can sing, That bubbles up from the Eternal Spring; And these alone, that to themselves secure A place, where Waters fail not, and where Bread is sure. I'th' Praise of noble Verse, much I might say, Which, tho' by some abus'd, its Value don't allay. A Pearl will not the less a Crown adorn, 'Cause by a filthy Swine it hath been worn, And trampled under Foot; th' intrinsick Price Will still appear unto the truly Wife. We read in Sacred Writ of some that wore, The Iewels of the Lord, and play'd the Whore: We also read, how David, with his Lire, Could still Saul's Rage, and sooth his secret Fire, That did his Breast inflame, and Heavenly Thoughts inspire; How with his Verse, he could his Mind compose, And lull his Passions to a soft Repose. His Psalms are full of Hymns and Songs of Praise, Prophetick Mystick Flights, in heavenly Lays; Which may suffice to let the Reader know, He was a Poet, and a Prophet too. The wisest Prince that ever fill'd a Throne, Or sway'd a Scepter in the World, was one, Who of divine and heavenly Love has sang A Song, which from th'Harmonious Being sprang. Therefore, kind Reader, don't pre-judge, but try, And then, no doubt, but in this Harmony, Thou'lt, to thy Comfort, Satisfaction find, When Discomposure doth possess thy Mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of the Fall of Man. The Holy One did, by his Word, Create Man in a blessed Innocent Estate; Gave him a Righteous Law, whereby he might Live in Eternal, Pure, Unstain'd Delight. But th'Serpent, the most Subtil Beast i'th' Field, Soon with a Lye our Grandmother beguil'd, Through a vain Hope; and to Iniquity Enslav'd poor Man, breaking the Unity Betwixt him and his Maker; leading him Fondly to seek a Satisfaction in Self-hood, and Transitory Things, below The Chiefest Good: Whereby Man came to know Sad Disappointments; whence he could not be, By pow'r in Self, e'er ransom'd or set free. But, ah, the Bowels of Eternal Love Did then, with Pity and Compassion, move Towards his Creature, that he Promised, The Woman's Seed should bruise the Serpent's Head: And, in the time appointed, freely gave His Darling Son a Sacrifice, to save Perishing Mankind from that dreadful State, Which was so miserable desperate; So that believing in the Heavenly Pow'r, He comes to know his Lord and Saviour, Redeeming him from Sin unto Salvation, And to Eternal Reconciliation. Written 1663. Of a Sinful State. My Sins are Numberless, more than the Hair Upon my Head; yea, more than I can bear. O how my Soul doth languish in Distress, Because polluted with Unrighteousness! Ah, how my wretched Heart hath often been Ensnar'd with Folly, and enticing Sin! Sin, seeming pleasant, subtilly betrays Poor doting Mortals; but its cursed Ways Leads to Death's Chambers, and like Poyson sweet, Lulls on the Soul into a lasting Sleep. Lord, Rouze me from such Slumbers that arise, That I may this deformed Sin despise, And quite forsake all Earthly Vanities, Which me into Temptation thus hath brought, That I (instead of Wisdom) Folly sought. O that I were at Peace with thee, and could Truly Lament my Sins, so manifold! My Sins, which will, except thou grant Relief, O'erwhelm me with Intolerable Grief. Awake, awake, my Soul, do not remain In Slothfulness and Sin; but turn again To him that made thee: Do not still transgress His Holy Law; but, whilst he calls thee, cease From Evil, learn his Precepts, follow Him, Who freely gave his Life thee to Redeem From this vain World, from Sin and Slavery, That brings to Endless Wo and Misery: He bought thee dear, with his most precious Blood, Shed on the Cross for thine and others good. But, ah, how oft have I despis'd true Joys, And plac'd my Heart on Transitory Toys? How oft did I the Glorious Pearl refuse, Vile Empty Husks, that nourish not, to choose? Look down upon me, and Commiserate, Most Gracious Lord, my Lamentable State; And tenderly lead thou me back again Into the Land of Promise, whence I came Into this Land of Darkness; where, alas, I thus was brought to Bondage and Distress: For, ah, thou King of Kings, if thou reject me, Phar'oh's pursuing Host would soon afflict me; And if thou help me not in this Distress, Then should I perish in the Wilderness. In what Egyptian-Red-Sea straits am I? Whither, or to what Refuge, shall I fly, But unto thee? In whom alone I must Repose my Confidence, and chiefest Trust. Renew my Strength (dear Lord) that so I may O'ercome my great Temptations day by day; And so support my Soul, that I may bear The World's Revilings with a thankful Ear; And that I truly may in thee Rejoyce, Great Spring of Life and Light, in Heart and Voice; Confessing thee, the only Saviour, Who sav'st thy People from the Dragon's Pow'r, And with thy Blood dost wash and purifie Our Souls from all Sin and Iniquity: Who art indeed the good Samaritan, That cast an Eye of Pity on us, when The Priest pass'd by, and Levite turn'd aside, And (as it were) Relief and Help deny'd: But thou hadst Wine and Oyl to Purify, Supple and Heal our grievous Malady. Thou, thou alone, the true Physitian, art The Consolation of a Contrite Heart: Oh say, Be whole; say likewise, Sin no more, Lest worse Afflictions happen than before: Say also, if it please thee, Gracious Lord, (Who what thou wilt, Effectest by thy Word) Thy Sin's forgiven, thy Iniquity Is cover'd; and beget true Faith in me, That I may Praise thy Name Eternally. 1664. On God's Love. The King of Kings, the Great Eternal One, Sent from his Bosom his Beloved Son, Lost Man to seek, and to Restore ag'in, From the most vile Captivity of Sin; Who for our sakes his Father's Throne forsook, And, as a Servant, freely on him took The Form of Man, and among Mortals came; Yea, meekly bore the Cross, despis'd the Shame; Walking on Earth amongst his Chosen Ones, The Isra'lites, beloved Jacob's Sons. But they, Rebelling in disdainful Pride, Their King, their Saviour, disown'd, deny'd; Because he did not, to the Sensual Eye, Unveil his Glory, and his Majesty. The Raies that did around his Temples shine, His Mein, his Speech, bespoke him all Divine. Yet this vain Off-spring did him still deny, Accuse, condemn, degrade, and crucify; Who patiently Resign'd his Life, his Breath, And, thro' his Lamb-like Sufferings, conquer'd Death. Thus they, with wicked Hands, did Crucify The Spotless Lamb, descended from on High: Yet Him they could not long i'th' Grave detain, But with great Glory he arose again; Astonishing the Watchmen at the Tomb, He, to their great Amazement, forth did come: Which, when they to the Rulers did declare, They charg'd them not to noise it in the Ear Of the Plebean Multitude; but say, That his Disciples stole him thence away, While they slept, in the Silence of the Night. Thus seeking, by Deceit, to hide the Light That then was dawning, to Confound its Foes; But for a Leader, and a Guide, to those, That meekly waited for its Consolation; They have entail'd a Curse upon their Nation. But Isr'el's Glory's surely broken forth, Light to the Gentiles, shining in the North; As by that holy Prophet was foretold, That in the latter Days th'Almighty would Call and bring forth a Seed out of the North, A (then) despised Corner of the Earth. Should we not now, in Lowliness of Mind, And true Contriteness, wholly be Resign'd Unto his Will in all things, who hath thus Extended his Engaging Love to us, And tasted Death for us? Alas, who can Enough admire his Boundless Love to Man! 1665. Of This Age. O how doth England now polluted lye, And deeply plunged in Iniquity! Are not her People bruitish, and so vain, That ev'n as great Motives to complain And mourn for her, as for that City was, (Through whose sad Streets our Saviour did pass Bearing his Cross) may now be found? For they As did the Jews, contemn the Blessed Day Of Visitation; hate the Heav'nly Light, That shines in Darkness; daily do despight Unto the only Author of all Good; And trample under Foot the precious Blood Of Holy Jesus, by the Father Sent A Just High Priest, a Blessed Covenant, Unto the People: Him do they despise, And on their Beds do Wickedness devise Against the Just and Innocent; for they, That Live Uprightly, make themselves a Prey. Alas, both Priests and People now are bent, With one accord, God's Heritage to rent: But he observes them, and the Day draws near, Wherein he'll surely meet them, as a Bear Bereaved of her Whelps; and then he'll take Vengeance, for his Afflicted Isr'el's sake. And though the Priests Peace unto many cry, They know not Peace; but such as do deny To feed them with the Fat, they Rent and Tare, Like those of old; yea, Cruel War prepare Against them. Thus, for all their Learning, they Know not the Scripture-Record, (which doth say, Touch ye not mine Anointed, neither harm My Prophets; for I'll guard them with the Arm Of my Salvation) Nor the Pow'r of God, That will Chastize, as with an Iron Rod, The Proud Rebellious Ones; who shall be known To be but Hirelings, whom he will not own. These are they that for Gain do prophesie Devices of their Brain, and speak a Lye To People; yet dare say, Thus saith the Lord; When-as they do not rightly know his Word, That's as a Fire and Hammer, to Destroy, Consume, and Batter down Iniquity. People, observing Priests to count their Gain Their Godliness, rush into all Prophane Abominations and Impurity; Counting Religion a meer Policy To over-awe dull Souls, whilst some enjoy All the Delights wherewith Earth can supply Their Soaring Fancies. Thus, alas, they run The Road to Ruine, swift to be undone: If Heav'n prevent not with a Gracious Hand, They'll soon draw down sad Judgments on the Land. On the Fruitless Fig-Tree. The Fig-Tree, tho' it flourish'd, did afford No Fruit, as was expected by the Lord; Therefore 'twas Curs'd, did wither and decay, No Fruit producing from that very day. But unto Mankind, O most Gracious Lord! Great are the Mercies which thou dost afford; Tho' slothfully they hide, sometimes deny, The Talents given by thy Majesty: Thou dost not in thine Indignation thus Pass so severe a Sentence upon Us; Although we, of our selves, so Barren be, And oft more Fruitless than that Blooming Tree, Thou prun'st us, and with sweet refreshing Show'rs Art pleas'd oft to renew our weakned Pow'rs: Yea, long thou spar'st us; and at length, who proves Fruitful, thou cherishest, and freely loves. But if thy great Forbearance, Lord, should be As 'twere frustrated by a Fruitless Tree, Thou justly may'st the Vine-dresser require To cut it down, and cast it into th' Fire: Though there was frequent Intercession made, As when the Dressers of the Vineyard said, Lord, let us try it yet another Year, And then, if any Fruit thereon appear, 'Tis well Forbearance hath thereto been shewn; If otherwise, 'tis time to cut it down. When thus the Lord hath long time Fruit expected From Men, and yet is carelesly rejected; Though waiting still, he pleas'd to condescend Line upon Line, with Patience, to extend; And Precept upon Precept, did dispence; And likewise promis'd a sure Recompence Of Durable Reward, Eternal Joy, To those that, ceasing from Iniquity, Would unto his most Sacred Will resign Themselves, and All: Then would he with Divine Sweet Heav'nly Show'rs bedew, and always bless Them, that they might be Trees of Righteousness. But if such should resist, they'll come to be Like Heath i'th' Desart, or the Fruitless Tree: And if against them the Decree be Seal'd, To cut them down, how can it be Repeal'd? Ah! prize the present Day of Visitation, And dare not to provoke his Indignation; That, through Distillings of his Heav'nly Love, You fertile Plants unto his Praise may prove. 1666. On Israel's Rebellion. O house of Israel, why will ye dye! O House of Israel, why shall not I Be King o'er you? Said the Eternal One, When their Rebellions came before his Throne, Rouzing his Justice: Why do ye refuse Me to be King, another King to choose? Incline your Ear, and hearken to my Voice, Lest you too late Repent your hasty Choice: Have I not gather'd you, that ye might be A pure peculiar People unto me? Did I not bring you out of Egypt's Land, And set you free from Pharaoh's cruel Hand? Did I not guide you safely through the Sea, Leading you with a Glorious Cloud by Day, And with a Pillar of bright Fire by Night, Conducted you in pleasant Paths of Light? Did I not Jordan's Flowing Streams divide, Whilst you pass'd dry-shod to the further side? Yea, without Humane Art, I caus'd to fall, Down to the Ground, proud Jericho's high Wall. Could any Mortal Prince do thus for you? I gave you Being, Life, and Conquest too. Why do you then Rebel against your God? Do you not fear Him, nor his Iron Rod? Remember how, in Love, I nourished Thee, like a tender Child, with Angels Bread; With Water from the Rock I did supply thee, Altho' I knew 'twas good sometimes to try thee: Thine Enemies I did for thee subdue; Yea, Great and Mighty Kings I overthrew, When they Oppressed or Opposed thee: But, ah, what Guile, or what Iniquity, Have your Fore-Fathers ever found in me! Or in my Righteous Statutes? Yet have they Delighted rather in a Crooked Way, Than in my Law; whose Path is perfect Light, In which the Wise and Prudent take delight. Though they perversly often turn'd aside, As you their Children, who have now deny'd Me to be King: 'Tis Me that you forsake, To choose a Mortal, who will from you take Your Sons and Daughters, for his Offices, For Horsemen, Cooks, and other Services; Your Vineyards, Fields, Cattel, and other Treasure, As he thinks fit, he'll call for at his Pleasure. Stiff-necked People are ye then, to choose Man for your King, but stubbornly refuse Me, your Creator, that ye may hereby Be like your Neighbours; whose Idolatry You also dote upon: Though my Command Was to destroy the Idols of the Land; Which to extirpate utterly, I did All Converse and Affinity forbid With those Inhabitants; whom therefore I, Since they the Land with gross Iniquity Had long defil'd, determin'd to expel, And give them for a Prey to Israel, To Root them out, not Imitate: For they, By ill Example, soon would lead astray From my pure Precepts. Yet you rather be Inclin'd to hearken unto such, than Me, And t'imitate the Nations round about ye, Who, should I but withdraw, would quickly rout ye Take now your choice; but know, the time will be, In your Afflictions, ye will seek to me: For they will prove as Thorns to vex and grieve you, And there is none but I that can relieve you; For 'tis not Man can give you Victory O'er your Opposers; No, 'tis only I. And had you still obey'd my just Command, I'd quite expell'd your Foes from out the Land. Meditations in Trouble. O how is my Distressed Soul perplext With overwhelming Sorrows! Ah, how vext With daily Troubles, hurry'd to and fro! I know not where to stay, or where to go, To find some ease, or to avoid my Grief; From this false World I cannot find Relief. Alas, alas, that which Afflicteth me Is Thoughts, how I have oft rejected thee, Most Gracious Lord, when thou Invited'st me, With other Weary'd Ones, to give us Rest, And Consolation at thy tender Breast. But, ah, incline thine Ear to this my Cry, Grant me thy Quick'ning Presence, or I dye. Though in Obscurity I have been hid, And as in Crooked Paths oft wandered; Some Glimpse of Light is surely broken in, Which gives to see the Loathsomness of Sin: Yea, through thy Goodness, I begin to know Thou'rt Rich in Mercy, and to Anger slow: Lord, speak the Word, that so I may be heal'd, Knowing thy Holy Life in me reveal'd. Ah, let thy Heav'nly Fear always in me Abound, Salvation is alone of thee. For, tho' thy Righteous Law I have transgress'd, And oft despised Knowledge, like the Beast, That hath no Understanding; thou didst please T'engage thy self, That if a Sinner cease From his past Wickedness, and fervently Do unto thee, Great King, for Mercy cry, So that thy Holy Precepts he obey, And walk sincerely in thy Living Way; Thou, by thy Prophet, Lord, wert pleas'd to give Thy Princely Word, He shall not Dye, but Live. Encouraged hereby, my panting Soul Cries unto thee, that thou would'st make me whole; Thou only Author of true Living Faith, That hast subdu'd the Pow'r of Hell and Death, And overcome the World: Ah, lighten me, That I may know thy Way, and follow thee; Bearing the Daily Cross, and find that Power, Which is to the Redeem'd a Refuge-Tower; And so enjoy Eternal Peace with thee, Thou taking up thy bless'd Abode with me, That I may sing thy Praise Eternally. A Meditation. Though Zion sit in Misery, And do in Ashes mourn, And all her Foes, as they pass by, Do her deride and scorn. Though like the spotless Turtle Dove, That in the Rock doth dwell, 'Wailing the absence of her Love, Whose Grief no Tongue can tell. Though for a Season thus she may Sit, like a Widow poor And desolate, there is a Day When she shall grieve no more. Though yet she mourn, lament and weep, To see her Children dear To wander, like poor scatter'd Sheep, Through Desarts far and near: Hourly in danger to be torn, By Tyger, Wolf or Bear, As they are seeking to return Unto their Mother dear. Yet those that would these Sheep annoy, Let them for certain know, They shall not, if such them destroy, Long unrewarded go. Ere long this Cloud of Misery Shall vanish quite away; She, that sat in Obscurity, Shall see a Glorious Day. Then shall her Tyranizing Foes Receive just Punishment, Who did her Children dear expose T'Exile and Banishment. These shall return to her again, With Sacred Songs of Joy; But those shall Roar and Howl for pain, And to the Mountains cry, Fall on us, hide us from the Wrath Of the Lamb's Anger, and Which He against us justly hath Sent forth: For who can stand When he appears? Sure only those That know his Blessed Power T'surround and guard them from their Foes, As in a Refuge Tower. 1668. On PETER. Could Peter, unto whom the watchful Cock Was as a Sign, be that abiding Rock, And firm Foundation, whereupon the Lord, According to his never-failing Word, Would build his Church, 'gainst which the Gates of Hell Should not prevail? For Christ himself would dwell Ev'n in the midst of her; Can these things be, And Peter so prevail'd against? For he Did after this yield to th' Infirmity Of Flesh and Blood; and so, for fear, deny His Lord and Master: Till his Master's Look Pierced his Heart; and yet Compassion took On Weeping Peter: But the Heav'nly Pow'r Abides, that shew'd him clearly in that hour, Jesus to be the Son of God, the Christ. Though Gog and Magog study to resist This Rock of Ages, all their Strength shall fail; For against this, Hell-Gates shall ne'er prevail: Nor shall that Faith or Hope e'er be Confounded, That is on this abiding Basis grounded. Would Man be safe against the Storms of Hell? Then build upon this Rock of Israel. A Meditation in Affliction. O gracious Lord, thou only King of Kings, Who only Saving Health and Comfort brings To the Afflicted, that in Faith do cry To thee! 'Tis thou canst heal each Malady; Thou a Physitian of Physitians art, And of thy Mercies freely dost impart Unto thy Creatures, who have none but thee To hope for help from, in their Misery. O thou that to the Blind restored Sight, Capacitating to behold the Light, Which makes things manifest, whereby we may Walk without Stumbling, and not lose our way: Who likewise didst the Dumb Man's Tongue unty, That he might speak, thy Name to magnify; The Dead reviv'dst, the Bury'd rais'd again, Strengthned the Ancle-Bones, whereby the Lame Leap'd as an Hart: Thy Pow'r is still the same. O thou that art the God of Love alone! Look down, look down, from thy most Gracious Throne; Have Mercy on me, ease me from my Grief, And grant unto thy Hand-maid some Relief; Hold forth thy Righteous Scepter, and say, Live; 'Tis thou alone that canst my Sins forgive: Speak but the word, and my—Infirmities Shall soon be heal'd.—Ah, heal my feeble Eyes, Of Soul and Body, Lord, that I may see Thy Heav'nly Light, and learn to follow thee! And in thy Fear spend my remaining Days, To tell thy Goodness, and to sing—thy Praise. 1668. On the Sight of a Skull. Behold, Ambitious Lump of Clay refin'd, Thy Epilogue; see, see to what design'd! So soon as thou wert Born, so soon as Air Affords thee Breath, thy Vitals to repair; So soon as thy small feeble Embrion Breast Is of an active Power, unknown, possess'd; So soon thou may'st expect the Dreadful Day, When thou once more must be reduc'd to Clay; And the whole Fabrick of thy Body must Again be brought to its first nothing, Dust: Then shall those Eyes, those Christal Eyes of thine, Which now, like Sparkling Diamonds, do shine; Their little Chambers circular forsake, And them to Essence more obscure betake; The tender Funnel of thy Nose, must thence Corroded be, and lose its Smelling Sense; And all the Volume of thy Face will be So chang'd, none may thereby remember thee: Therefore the hopes of all Terrestrial Glory, Is Frivolous, and Vain, and Transitory. Ah then, what cause hast thou, Presumptuous Man, To boast thy self? Whereon, alas, where can Thy vain Ambition build a Trophy now? What Cause hath Majesty upon that Brow T'Enthrone it self? Which must ere long become A Thread-bare Skull, a simple naked Bone? Therefore, who'er thou be, that dreads this strange, To Flesh and Blood, this doleful, certain Change, Let it be thy Concern, in holy Fear, To pass the time of thy Sojourning here In pure Obedience to that Heav'nly Pow'r, Who, when he pleaseth, can to Life restore And give thy Soul assured Satisfaction (In Him, who is our Life and Resurrection) To rest with him; whereby the Dread and Fear, That doth so frequently in some appear, When Thoughts of this great Change doth rise in Mind, Are vanish'd and dispell'd; they inward find Such hearty Resignation, they can sing, Grave, where's thy Victory? Death, where's thy Sting? Sin, Death's sad Sting, must therefore conquer'd be, Before poor Man this Joyful Day can see: Then, being call'd, we freely may lay down This Transitory Life, to gain a Crown Of Life Eternal, with the Prince of Peace, Where all Affliction shall for ever cease. Then, having put on Immortality, Our Souls shall Praise his Name Eternally. 1669. A Meditation. O who would think it such a task to find A vigilant and truly stable Mind! Low center'd down in that Eternal Light, Which, with its Brightness, drives away the Night Of gross Egyptian Darkness, that it may, Like pleasant Phospher, usher in the Day. Alas, what Heart can rightly apprehend The Soul-amazing Conflicts, that attend All that begin to travel towards Zion, How they're opposed by the Roaring Lion, That goes about, still seeking to destroy, And hinder from true Everlasting Joy. Ah, none but those that walk the narrow Way, Can see the Snares laid to entice astray, And draw aside from that Protecting Pow'r, Which only can preserve them in the Hour Of great Temptation. Ah, thrice happy they That know the Sheepfold, where they safely may Lie down secure, and need not be afraid Of any Beast of Prey, that would invade The couching Lambs, whose Shepherd never sleeps, But, as an Army, them securely keeps: Here may they Pasture sweetly, safely, bless'd; But from this Fold there is no place of Rest. 1669. On the Parable of the Ten Virgins. Truth pleas'd to say, Ten Virgins typifie The Heav'nly Kingdom's sacred Mystery. Ten Virgins, and but Five were counted Wise: Tho' all, alas, inclin'd to slumbering Eyes, Both Wise and Foolish; yet the King discern'd Who were his Faithful Ones, for they had learn'd To be prepar'd, and in their Vessels they Had taken Oyl, and labour'd in the Day, And furnished their Lamps; that in the Night, The Bridegroom coming suddenly, they might Find Favour and Admittance in to see The sacred Nuptial Joys; as also be Happy Partakers of the same: When they That Foolish were, and idly slept away Their precious Time, not having Oyl, must go To Buy; but then, too late returning to The Door, they find it shut; where, tho' they cry, Lord open to us! Ah, the sad Reply Will be, I know you not, depart from me, Ye Foolish Workers of Iniquity. Then may they wander, destitute of Light, In horrid Darkness of perpetual Night. Now, you that would be numbred with the Wise, Take heed of sleeping in Formalities; Lest ye forget the Oyl, the Life of Light, And so be unprepared in the Night: For, though you imitate the Wise, and bear A shew of Lamps, there can no Light appear, If Oyl be wanting. O Redeem your Time! Have Oyl in th'Vessel, that your Lamps may shine; Lest, if it be to seek, when 'tis too late, Such may in vain stand Knocking at the Gate, But find no Entrance: Therefore watch to hear The Midnight Cry, Arise, prepare, prepare To meet the Bridegroom; 'tis the Wise that shall Be entertain'd, that waited for the Call, And in their Vessels kept the Oyl for Light; Such were in Readiness, and therefore might Have free access unto the Marriage-Feast, And with a Chearful Heart, sit down and taste; Yea, feed and drink thereat abundantly, Having the Wedding-Garment on, whereby They read their Welcom in the Bridegroom's Eye. True durable Delights do then abound, Salvation, as a Bulwark, doth surround These highly Favoured Ones; who therefore sing Praise to the Bridegroom, Sion's Blessed King. 1669. A Meditation. The Lord, the Lord of Hosts, is Sion's King, Who dwells i'th' midst of her, &amp; she shall sing High Praises to his Name; knowing his Word Her only Law, to which, with one accord, Her Children hearken: Tho' she once did Mourn, She shall Rejoyce; Altho' she was the Scorn Of Nations, He'll Exalt her, as the Crown Of all the Earth; because she is his own. Then shall Jerusalem be known to be The bright, but tender Apple of his Eye; And all that touch her, to afflict or grieve her, Shall feel a Fiery Dart struck through their Liver: Her Children are a Chosen Generation; Jerusalem shall be an Habitation Of Peace and Quietness; for she shall be, By her Victorious Lord and King, kept free From all Invasion; and her Glorious Light, Which never more can be snrpriz'd by Night, Is Heav'ns great Lord, against whom none can stand, The Sun of Righteousness; whose Glorious Hand Is Zion's Shield, Salvation is her Wall And fenced Bulwarks, which can never fall, By Force of Batt'ring Rams, or Cannon-Shot, For their great Founder's is always on the Spot, And never can be shaken, but shall be Invincible to all Eternity. And though her Gates (each of a Pearl entire, Whose dazling Splendor justly may require Our humble Admiration) are by Day Open to all that that walk in Zion's Way; That which defileth, or that is impure, Or loves, or makes a Lye, cannot endure To enter there; the Fire consumes all Dross: The only Way therein is through the Cross. Her Streets, where her Inhabitants do pass, Are Bright as Gold, or like transparent Glass: Hither the Lamb conducts his Chosen Ones, To Reign with him, and sit on Glorious Thrones; There to behold, for ever, Face to Face, The Heavenly King, who giveth Grace for Grace, With Princely Priviledge, to take and eat Life's pleasant Fruit, which Man at first might take; Which ev'ry Month brings forth a new supply, Whose precious Leaves shall heal each Malady Among the Nations, that there may remain Not one infirm, or blemish'd with a Stain. The Saving Health of Nations dwelleth here, Where the Redeemed serve him without Fear; Keeping th' Eternal Sabbath Day of Rest, With great Emmanuel, for ever bless'd. The Christal River streaming from the Throne Of pure unblemish'd Glory (whereupon The Lord God, and the Lamb immaculate, In Mercy, Reigns) Refreshing ev'ry State, Here sweetly flows; and also, Proclamation Is made to ev'ry Kindred, Tongue and Nation, If any thirst, let that poor Soul repair Unto this Fountain, for Salvation's there: Come, saith the Spirit; Come, the Bride doth say; Why in a Land of Drought should any stay? Come, all that thirst, Come, drink abundantly These Soul-refreshing Streams of Purity: This is the Blessed River, that makes glad The Heritage of God, as David said; For this doth through the Holy City flow, And on its Banks that Tree of Life doth grow: No Cursed Thing is in this City found, But Perfect Peace, and Heav'nly Joys abound, Because the Righteous reigns; whose Servants all Praise Him incessantly; the Elders shall Cast down their Crowns before his pure white Throne, And say, All Praise, all Honour, and Renown, Belongs to thee; who, by thy Living Word, Created us for thy own Pleasure, Lord. 1670. On Nadab and Abihu. Were these the high Priests Heirs, that did begin In Sacrifice to perpetrate a Sin So Capital, so Dreadful, to provoke Offended Justice, to inflict a Stroke So Terrible, as to destroy at once Two of th'anointed Priests, the high Priests Sons, For offering Sacrifice; yea, Incense, when They hop'd to purchase Favour, but in vain? 'Tis not Presumption in the Carnal Will, That finds acceptance; nor can this fulfil The Sacred Precepts of the highest King, But rather Sad and Dreadful Judgments bring Upon the Heads of them, whose Confidence In self produceth such a bold Offence, As is an adding to the Law of God, To such he'll add his Plagues; his Iron Rod Shall sore afflict them. 'Tis his Word alone Must be the Law; in his Beloved Son Is he well pleas'd; Him only all should hear, And feel their Hearts abound with holy Fear; Not taught by Carnal Precepts, Man's Tradition, Or a Self-will, but where a true Submission Is known; the Author of our Faith doth here, In th' humble Heart, beget true Son-like Fear: Such dare not pass the Limit of Command, Lest he say, Who requir'd it at your hand? For He (to whom, of his abundant Grace, The Great Eternal One spoke Face to Face) Who knew what he requir'd, then testify'd, Thus saith the Lord, I will be Sanctify'd By them that do approach to me; for I, As with Refiners Fire, will purify The Sons of Levi. Therefore àll in Fear, Must with a broken contrite Heart draw near To Isr'el's God; this is the Sacrifice Which he hath promis'd never to despise. On Charity. What a sumblime, celestial Mystery, Is couch'd in this obscure Name, Charity! So frequent in the Mouths of most, but known To few, save in the empty sound alone; Else it would teach us how to Sympathize One with another in Infirmities. This mourns with those that mourn, and to their grief, Studies, in kindness, to impart Relief: This beareth all things, and suspecteth none; This seeks another's good, ev'n as its own; Never rejoycing in Iniquity, For 'tis true Love to Friend, to Enemy; Desiring more to veil, to hide and cover, Than to disclose the weakness of a Brother; And, with a Garment, hides a multitude Of Faults, that Enmity may not intrude. But this, with Lynx-ey'd Passion cannot rest, Nor long cohabit in the self-same Breast; One's mild and gentle, apt to condescend; The other's peevish with a Bosom-Friend: One joys in that most, that offendeth none; The other seeks to please it self alone: The one fulfils the Law, in all respects; The other Law and Gospel both rejects. Now, are not all engag'd to entertain The Gentle Nature? Not alone the Name Of Charity; which, keeping Residence Within the Bosom, may exile from thence All Peace-disturbing Passion, and restrain Insulting Self, that she alone may reign. This would incline all Hearts to a Serene Calmness, and to a Condescending Frame Of Spirit; still rejoycing to dispence Favours to all, in true Benevolence; Not in Ambition, or Formality, To be applauded by a Mortal Eye. Restless Distrust, and Haughty-Ey'd Disdain, Envy, that frets and gnaws it self in vain, At other's Happiness, with Discontent, Which doth, in any State, true Peace prevent, And Self-tormenting Rage, with Fierce Revenge, Which often heaves the Senses off the Hinge Of Reason; all (where this prevails) are gone, Dispers'd like Mists before the Rising Sun: For Wars and Strife, where this inhabits, cease; And she confirms the Mind in lasting Peace. 1675. Contemplation. Great God, arise, that so thine Enemies May be dispers'd, as Clouds when th'Sun doth rise! Thou King of Kings, who only must expel Th'intruding Foe, that in the Heart doth dwell, Which is thy proper Right, who didst create It for thy Service: Teach us, Lord, to wait For thine Appearance, in Sincerity; To know thee first to Judge, then Justify The Meek, the broken contrite Heart: 'Tis thou That teachest rightly to thy Name to Bow; For none can Bow acceptably, or call Thee, Jesus, Lord; (tho' thou art Lord of all, Both Heav'n and Earth) but by thy holy Spirit; Whereby we come, through Mercy, to inherit Thy Princely Favours; and not only know To call thee truly Lord, but Father too. What! tho' Man in Externals may conform, And seemingly from his Pollutions turn; Yet to subdue and regulate the Will, Is thy own Work, surpassing Humane Skill: Poor wretched Man, tho' he thy Pow'r resist, Cannot return unto thee when he list, Without thy Help; since his depraved Will Is so averse to Good, so prone to Ill; Except he be, by thy Redeming Power, Set free, and taught to know the Refuge-Tower: Then neither Winds, nor Waves, nor Stormy Weather, (Although with Fury all conspire together, T'assault and ruinate the House that's founded, And on the Rock is deep and firmly grounded) Can overthrow it: Here's a Fortress sure, Which will against all Batteries endure; Here may we find a Captain will defend, Whom all dear Sion's Foes cannot withstand. Lord, since Salvation is alone from thee, From Self Destruction, Wo and Misery; Teach us to wait to feel thy Conqu'ring Love, Within our yielding Bosoms, freely move, To quicken, heal, and strengthen us; that we May, through thy Goodness, rise and follow thee: Believing, there is none but thee that can Crown with Perfection this thy Work in Man; And give access before thy Royal Throne, Where perfect Peace and Joy in thee is known: Then holy Thanks and Praises shall ascend To thee, who to our Grief dost put an end. 1676. A Meditation in Retirement. O that my Mind were cent'red where it ought! Entirely freed from all distracting Thought: Vain wandring Thoughts, that crowd within my Breast Do oft obstruct my Soul from Solid Rest; And, like to vagrant Clouds, obscure the Mind Which should to serious watching be inclin'd: Ah! Rise thou Sun of Righteousness, thy Light Can soon dispel the Gloominess of Night: Appear, appear, let thy Victorious Ray, And long'd-for Presence, still renew the Day; Whereby my slumb'ring Eyes may walk and see The Dawning Morning of Felicity, Still more and more break forth to perfect Day, Whose Heav'nly Light guides in the Blessed Way, That leads to thy renowned Holy Hill; Where true Obedience to thy Sacred Will Makes glad the Hearts of thy Redeemed Ones, Who know the Comfort of Adopted Sons; And can sing Praises to that Gracious Hand, Which rais'd 'em up, and taught 'em how to stand, To walk and run the pleasant Paths of Peace, Rejoycing in true Joys that never cease. 1677. On the Vanity of the World. How long shall empty Toys possess the Mind, Which should to solid Joys be more inclin'd! What true Content can spring t'Immortal Souls From Riches, that take Wings, or lurk in Holes? Thereby deluding those who seem t' possess Them; but excluding from the Happiness, Which, in right use of them, might be enjoy'd; So in th'abuse their Hearts are more imploy'd, Hoping to find therein a true Content Unto the Mind: Yet nothing permanent Can e'er be found in fading Vanity; Such Hopes are crown'd at last with Misery. Shall then the seeming Beauty of this thing So dis-ingage from Duty to the King Of Glory, who alone should rule in Man? The Heart should be his Throne: Shall these things then So sway the Mind, that Mortals should thereby Be thus inclin'd to dote on Vanity, Rather than to adore their Maker, and Fall down before him, at his just Command. May He be their Delight and Joy alone, For Everlasting Life in Him is known: Whereas the Love of transient Objects here, Doth often prove a Soul-deluding Snare, To hold them fast, as in Captivity; Until at last, for their Iniquity, They come to find themselves in this sad State; Their Minds tormented, and their Joys t'abate. Should any then imploy his Time, his Labour, To gain a fading Toy, and lose the Favour Of his Creator! Who, with tender Love, Doth, as a Father, visit from above, And gently call unto himself, that He Might Ransom all to perfect Liberty. Yet might we use needful Enjoyments here, Without abuse, in holy Dread and Fear. These outward things should not possess the Mind, That to the King of Kings should be resign'd: And he perswades to leave things transitory, Yea, freely leads to never-fading Glory; Come then, embrace the Crown that's set before ye. 1677. Contemplation. How amiable is thy Presence, Lord! O how desirable thy holy Word! Though as a Fire or Hammer it appear, To burn and batter down whatever's dear To sinful Flesh and Blood, thy Judgments be Exceeding sweet and pleasant unto me: For Sion's Children are Redeem'd thereby, And Purify'd from their Iniquity; Yea, Everlasting Righteousness brought in, Her Converts ransom'd from ensnaring Sin; And thy Salvation is hereby reveal'd More near, and thy great Mysteries unseal'd, When Judgment is brought forth to Victory, That thine may walk with thee in Purity. Ah! teach us daily patiently to wait, In holy Awe, to know this happy State Confirm'd and Seal'd unto us, that we may Reign with the Lamb in the Eternal Day: Then may we, to the Praise of Sion's King, A Song of Judgment and of Mercy sing. A Meditation. O keep me in thy Fear, thou All in All, That I may always hearken to thy Call, And answer thy Commands: If thou say, Come, Or Go, I with a willing Mind may run The Paths of thy pure Precepts; that I may Still know thy Presence in thy Living Way. Ah, guide me by thy bright Enam'ring Eye! Wherein sweet Mildness, mixt with Majesty, So overcomes my Soul; that, ah, my Heart Thus wounded, loves to feel so sweet a Smart! 'Tis thou alone that wounds, and gently heals; Thou kills, and Everlasting Life reveals Unto the Dead, that hear thy Voice; they Live To bless thy Name, and Living Praises give Unto thy Life-restoring Word; whereby Thine are set free from their Iniquity, To Live and Reign with thee, whose Pow'r alone Works Wonders: Weakness wholly is our own; But Strength Invincible is thine, Great King! Thou Living Fountain, whence all Comforts spring: Ah, teach me fervently to wait to see Salvation and Deliverance wrought for me! That all Thanksgiving may to thee redound, Who art with Everlasting Glory crown'd. On TRUTH. Truth in the Inward Part is my delight, To Meditate therein both Day and Night, And feel its pure Enliv'ning Pow'r in me Surmount all Pleasure, that on Earth can be Enjoy'd by Mortals: Ah, this is alone More Precious than the Diadem or Throne Of Egypt's Land! O how my Soul admires it, And in the secret of my Heart desires it Above all transitory fading things! For this alone true Satisfaction brings To the Immortal Soul; then how can I But, in true Meekness and Humility, Bow down before the Glorious Majesty, And Supplication make, that this may be Abundantly each day reveal'd in me By th'Holy Ghost; that so a contrite Heart May be prepar'd, by Truth in th'Inward Part, And offer'd up, a Living Sacrifice Unto the Lord; who never will despise A truly humble, broken, contrite Heart; Because he loves Truth in the Inward Part: Who can but prize it! For th'Eternal Love Distils sweet Show'rs of Blessings from above, Into the Heart, where this abides and dwells; Which, with its Heav'nly Lustre, far excels All Oriental Gems: The Rubies rare, Or Sparkling Diamonds, may not compare, Or be esteem'd with this; its Worth exceeds Them all, as Sharon's Rose all noisome Weeds In Aromatick Fragrancy transcends; And as by sacred Influence extends A spicy Sweetness to what's touch'd thereby, And tinctures with a sacred Sympathy; As when one formerly was pleas'd to knock, T'awake his Love, the Handles of the Lock, Embalm'd with droppings of sweet smelling Myrrh, Stream'd with a Vertue, that enamour'd her, Who 'rose to open to him, so that she Was wounded deep, (O sacred Sympathy!) Nor could she rest, till seeking far and near, Her best Beloved did again appear. This is that Princely Lover, that inspires The Hearts of Mankind, with such pure Desires After himself: And those that be affected With Love sincere, the World must be rejected By such, for their Beloved's sake; for He A perfect Recompence to them will be. Love can admit no Rivals; they must choose But one, and then the other quite refuse: For he that loves Truth in the Inward Part, Ought to be sole Possessor of the Heart; Then in this Pilgrimage he'll grant a Guide Unto their Steps, lest they should turn aside; Even this for-ever-blessed Truth within, Which, as the Light, doth first discover Sin; Then, as it is obey'd, the Heart and Mind Hereby comes to be cleansed and refin'd (As Gold refined in the Fire from Dross) From all Pollutions; and upon the Cross The Enmity is slain, and holy Awe, With true Submission to the Royal Law, Springs in its stead; thus Sin and Wickedness Cast out and conquer'd, perfect Righteousness Is then brought in, whereby Salvation is Reveal'd, with earnest of Eternal Bliss. Thus Man's Redeem'd unto a Blessed State, That was become lost and degenerate, Through Disobedience to that Sacred Law, Enjoyn'd to Man at first, thereby to draw To sole Dependance on the Chiefest Good, Who granted him the Tree of Life for Food, Till he transgress'd; but then Man presently Became a Slave to Sin and Vanity. So as by Disobedience in that Day, Man, hearkening to the Serpent, lost his Way In Death's dark Region; if his pensive Mind Begins sincerely (by some Glimpse inclin'd) T'obey the Light of Life, he comes to be Redeem'd from Death and Darkness, and set free; Free from Captivity of Sin and Death, To serve the Lord of Life, who gave him Breath, Yea, Life and Being; and when'er he pleaseth But to with-hold his Pow'r, the Creature ceaseth To move: In Him alone is Life and Love, In whom the Righteous always Live and Move, As led by this pure, holy, blessed TRUTH, The Inward Word, the Guide of Age and Youth. For by this may a Young Man cleanse his Way; And to the Aged, 'tis their Strength and Stay: This surely is the goodly Pearl of Price; And this is Mary's well-approved Choice: This is the hidden Treasure, that doth lie So undiscerned by the Carnal Eye; Which, whosoever finds, and selleth all To purchase, tho' at first it seem but small Unto the Worldly-Wise, yet shall it be A good Inheritance Eternally. 1678. Contemplation. My Life, my Love, my Joy, Who can enough admire The Sweetning Influence Of Shiloh's Stream, from whence Vertue abounds unto thy Plants, whereby The Lilly sprouts, free from the Choaking Bryar; Thy Trees do likewise bring forth Fruit, &amp; flourish, To th'Praise of thee, who dost both Prune and Cherish. The time that is employ'd In holy Meditation Of thy Prevailing Love, Engaging from above The upright Heart, (wherein it is enjoy'd) In humble Fear, and sacred Admiration, Is best Improv'd; for this indeed doth tend To true Content and Peace, World without end. 1678. The Retreat, a Meditation. Thou only Solace of a Panting Soul, Let not Earth's interposing Mists controul The earnest Breathing of my Heart, and vail Thy Beauty over-long, lest Doubts prevail: Yet gently teach me always to submit To what Chastizement thou, my Lord, think'st fit; That a more intimate Acquaintance may With thee be known, and thy Eternal Day Shine forth, as when the Moon's Light must become, As the bright Quick'ning Lustre of the Sun; And so the Splendor of the Sun increase As the united Light of Seven Days. Ah then, what cause of Stumbling can there be To the Redeemed Souls, that follow thee, In true Unfeigned Love! Thou only art Worthy to have sole Interest in the Heart: 'Tis thou alone, who dost our Foes subdue, And, with kind Invitations, long pursue Rebellious Souls, too apt to turn aside, Or to forget thy kindness, if thou hide Thy Face a little; or like Israel, When Moses tarry'd in the Mount, rebel: For, ah, distrusting Thoughts do presently Object the sad Impossibility Of finding thee again, whereby we might Be overwhelmed in Egyptian Night; And with our borrow'd Jewels, form and make A Golden Calf, and wretchedly forsake, For new Inventions, thy most Righteous Law, If Moses for a season should withdraw; VVilling and running to our own Destruction, When we should wait on thee to gain Instruction. Ah, let thy tender Care preserve and keep Us, with an Eye that is not apt to sleep, But always guards thy little Heritage, From all their Adversaries, in this Age, As formerly; though the Unfaithful are Often Surpriz'd, and cast into a Snare: Bnt tho' thou try'st thy true Depending Ones, Thou still protect'st them as Beloved Sons. Ah! prove me, but support me; my Desire Is, with resigned Will, to pass the Fire Of Trials and Afflictions, till thereby I be refin'd from all Impurity. For those whom thou hast throughly purify'd, And in the Furnace of Afflictions try'd, Thou bear'st up in the Arms of thy Salvation, And suckles at the Breast of Consolation, That they may speak thy Praise, and run the Way Of Life and Peace, in thy Eternal Day. 1678. The First Epistle to Cousin F. R. My Heart (dear Cousin) thy Eternal Good Truly desires, and that Life's saving Food Thy Soul may taste and feed upon; that so Thou may'st unto a perfect Stature grow In Jesus Christ, the bless'd Emmanuel, And with him in pure Heav'nly Places dwell; That in sincerity, thy Heart and Mind May to this Loyal Lover be resign'd: Then will it not be grievous unto thee To wait to know his Will more frequently; Which, when made known, be careful to obey, That thou may'st travel in his holy Way; Not still resisting, lest he cease to strive, Who by his potent Love preserves alive. O prize this Love! and see that, with disdain Thou do'st not recompence this Love again: Plead not for Flesh, nor Fleshly Vanity, Lest thou be plung'd into Iniquity. Thou know'st, thou hast a Talent to improve, Yea, more than some: O do not grieve, or move To Indignation, Him that doth extend His tender Arm of Love thee to defend From the devouring Dragon, that with Wiles And sluggard Poisons, subtilly beguiles Unstable Souls, that sell the precious Truth, And in vain Pleasures waste their Prime of Youth, But be not thou as they, who for meer Toys, Contemn and Sell their Souls Eternal Joys: Nor be asham'd (dear Friend) I thee intreat, To honour Him that did thy Soul create, And Body too; altho' the World should scorn, For Jesus sake; thou know'st thou wast not Born To serve the World, the Flesh, nor Satan neither; Therefore, altho' all these Conspire together, Give Christ thy Heart, &amp; he will give thee Strength To overcome thine Enemies at length. But if thou be, before the Sons of Men, Asham'd to own thy self his Servant, then He'll be asham'd of thee before his Father, And Ever-Blessed Angels; therefore rather Deny thou all for Him, than Him for any; For tho' there be pretended Lovers many, Let this the chiefest of Ten Thousand be; For surely so he'll prove himself to thee, If thou canst but believe, and not exclude Thy self, through Sin and vile Ingratitude. O set thy self to seek him, that seeks thee, With his endeared Love, to set thee free From the Oppression of the Enemy, Thee to adorn in spotless Purity. Tho' Troubles, Griefs, and Crosses, do attend Thee many times, thou hast a Bosom-Friend, To whom in secret thou may'st tell thy Grief, Who will not fail to grant thee true Relief. Come then (dear Cousin) in Humility, Prove, and thou'lt find this Friend's Fidelity; Who will undoubtedly from Griefs divert thee, And unto Holiness and Peace convert thee: His Grace sufficient is, He only can Effect what seems Impossible to Man. My Heart is full, and fluent to indite, My Hand is therefore thus engag'd to write Much more than at the first I did intend, And yet I scarce can freely make an end. Third Month, 1678. The Second Epistle to Cousin F. R. Shall I (endeared Friend) expect in vain Thy Promise answer'd, and not yet obtain The Joy of better Fruits of vacant Hours, Which we are not assur'd long to be ours? Alas, the time will come when some will say, O that I had as yet another Day! What, to add Sin to Sin, and to retire, If once wash'd clean, to wallow in the Mire! No, no; but diligently to improve Their time, that they might Treasure up above, In Heav'ns Exchequer, that which will endure; Gold tryed in the Fire, refin'd and pure, With Garments of Salvation, which will bring Into acceptance with th'Eternal King. These are the Robes of Righteousness, that can Procure the Favour of both God and Man. O Come! Consider, let all Vanity Stoop to Concerns of such Importancy: And let none say, I hope 'tis well with me, Because I yet no Condemnation see, Nor feel I Judgments: If such yet retain A fond delight in transitory, vain, And fading Toys, their Treasure lies below, Which soon corrupts; such reap, ev'n as they sow; Sad Disappointments. Sion's Converts must Redemption know, by Judgments true and just Alas, the Hope of Hypocrites shall fail! In times of trial, what shall it avail? But those that singly leave all things below, Shall in themselves the Hope of Glory know; A Living Hope, a Hope that will endure: This purifies the Heart, as he is pure, That raiseth up the same in Men, that they May be encouraged in the good Way, That leads to Life, to Everlasting Peace, In Joys Eternal, which shall never cease. Ponder these things (my Friend!) thou hast indeed Engag'd thy self (although thou yet proceed But slowly to perform) with diligence, To render humble due Obedience To what's made known, by him that from above Draws tenderly, by his Long-suff'ring Love: O let it not so soon forgotten be! Which, as desir'd, will more increase in thee Its Sweet'ning Vertue, its Enliv'ning Power; That unto thee will more and more discover Iniquity, and for the same reprove Thy Soul in secret; but will gently move And lead thee, by his Strength-renewing Hand, With Cheerfulness to answer his Command, And fully Recompence thee: O be wise! Learn thou to fear, but do not now despise The Day of small Things; Ah, believe, that she That Faithful in a little is, shall be Made Ruler over much: Commit thine All To Him, that doth in Love so often call, Come unto me! And know, if thou abide Faithful in fervent Zeal, when thou art try'd, Thou'lt in thy Bosom find a sweet Increase Of an admired overflowing Peace; Which, rightly known, will more esteemed be, Than all those Objects carnal Eyes can see. But know, that mighty Works were never done Amongst them that would not believe the Son, The Lamb of God; such from a near Relief, Excluded were, because of Unbelief: Yet unto one, not Conscious of that Guilt, Be it unto thee even as thou wilt, Was Graciously Proclaim'd; whereby she found Her meek Petition fairly Heard, and Crown'd With a desired Grant; although to try Her Faith, at first the Answer did imply Rather Repulse than Favour, when 'twas said, It is not fit to take the Childrens Bread, And give to Dogs: She answered, Truth; yet Lord, These lick the Crums that fall beside their Board. Here's Wrestling Faith indeed, which as express'd In fervent Meekness, from a Panting Breast, Admiredly prevail'd with Him; whose Name, Whose matchless Love and Goodness, is the same For ever. Faint not, but go supplicate For Grace, to him that's easie to intreat By all that, in true Lowliness of Mind, Make their Addresses: Seek and ye shall find, Is the Authentick Warrant to begin To seek the Glorious Pearl that's lost within. Look not abroad, but light thy Candle there; Seek thou at home, and thou shalt find it near: Therefore Redeem thy Time, and Meditate How best thy Promise thou may'st yet compleat. Verily, what thou say'st, can not avail To justify, if thy Performance fail; Nor is there strength in self: Therefore endeavour To know that Hand, which helpeth to persevere Unto the End; and if thou Faithful be, A Crown of Life shall be bestow'd on thee. 1678. A Remembrancer. Consider well some by-past Days, On former Times reflect, And see if thou in all thy ways Art truly circumspect. 'Twas said in Scripture's true Record, The People well have spoken, Had they an Heart to serve the Lord, And not so falsly broken Their Sacred Vows, whereby they did Engage in holy Fear To leave undone what he forbad, That they might know him near, Strength'ning to do what he requires, (In deep Humility) And still begetting new desires, His Name to magnifie: Whose Promise is to dwell within, Even in the Humble Heart, And wholly to Redeem from Sin, And of his Grace impart; That we may know his just Command Reveal'd within, and done; And all destroy'd, that would withstand; Then shall his Kingdom come, Which doth consist in Righteousness, In Peace, and Heav'nly Joy In th'Holy Ghost, where Blessedness Abounds Eternally. 1687. An Epistle to Cousin E. S. When I remember thee (dear Friend) I find My Heart thus to advise thee, is inclin'd; If thou canst hear in Calmness, and subdue All peevish Passion, which in open view Of sober Persons, justly merits Blame, And manifests the Ground from whence it came: Then let this Counsel find a place in thee; Stoop low to Truth, and learn Humility: This thou wast once acquainted with; beware, Lest Strangeness interpose, and learn to fear. Know'st thou not what true Wisdom said of old, Man's greatest Foes are of his own Houshold? And true it is, not outwardly alone, But inwardly; for greater there is none, Than these, we can encounter with; for they Lurk close within, and secretly betray. Therefore take heed, for tho' there do appear Bad Precedents, and Ill Examples near, They'll not so soon infect a solid Mind, Which unto Watchfulness is still inclin'd: And then, though Trials frequently attend, There is an Arm of Love that will defend From all Assaults of Man's grand Enemy, As it is lean'd to, in Simplicity. O let's remember this, lest we should prove Unmindful of our First, our Chiefest Love! Or lest a Second Love should so engage Our Hearts and Minds, in this Infectious Age, As wholly to lead captive, and betray Us to a treacherous, fawning Delilah, A subtil Bosom Traytor; such prevail'd O'er one, whose Strength and Valour never fail'd, Until he doted on a Stranger's Love. O may such false Enticements never move Our Hearts to turn aside, lest we may lose Our Strength and Stay, and frequently expose Our selves to Snares and Dangers! Surely we Are always bound to wait in fear, to be Kept near that Living Vertue, that doth favour Thoughts, Words, &amp; Actions, and that keeps in favour With our First Love; that we may live and rest With Sion's holy King, for ever bless'd. To Cousin M. S. Sometimes (dear Friend) this riseth in my Heart, Come, let's with Mary, choose the better part; Of which the Meek shall not deprived be: Her Seat was low, in deep Humility, At holy Jesus Feet; where her desire Was still to hear that Voice, which did inspire Her Heart with fervent Love. She did not seek Usurped Power, but learned to be Meek; For certainly, the Humble-Hearted shall Exalted be; but Pride portends a fall. Whoever would be Great, must first be Low And Little, and a true Subjection know To that which teacheth Lowliness of Mind; And to the Truth their All must be resign'd, Before they can obtain that true Content, And solid Joy, that's firm and permanent: Such then may say, No Solace, Joy, nor Love, Like unto this, which freely from above Distills and streams into the Heart that's pure; Here's Treasure, Pleasure, Peace, that will endure: To this we ought to make our Calling sure. 1678. The Third Epistle to Cousin F. R. That Love (dear Friend) which brings thee to my Mind, Thus frequently, hath now again inclin'd To visit thee, with these Considerations Concerning thee: O Let thy Meditations Hereof be serious! Let all Vanity Be far exil'd, and love Simplicity. Shall I object to thee the Pompons State Of Purple Dives, or his Dreadful Fate? Nay surely! Thou the History canst read; Read thou within, and let not Self-hood plead. His Unrelenting Heart despis'd the Poor, Ev'n Lazarus, that Languish'd at his Door, Without Relief: Whereas in such a State, I should (think'st thou) be more Compassionate, And not so disregard him. Ah, my Friend! Though some a Hand of Charity extend, As outwardly (which in its place is good) Imparting sometimes Raiment, sometimes Food, To Fellow-Creatures: Yet there's one that's Poor, Humble and Meek, contemned at thy Door; That waits for entrance, and that gently knocks, Until the Dew have wet his Comely Locks; Open to entertain him now, for He Is come, in tender Love, to visit thee: And tho' Poor, Meek and Lowly he appear, He's King of Kings; therefore incline thine Ear To his Request, that he may dwell with thee, Whose Love's the Fountain of Felicity. Let Superfluities be laid aside, The Gaudy Trophies of Insulting Pride; And be not over-curious to express Too much Exactness in an outward Dress; Lest peevish Passion should too oft prevail, To banish Reason from its Throne, and vail Sound Judgment; which would search and purify Submissive Souls from their Iniquity, And Vanity, abounding in th'abuse Of Visibles, which Mortals fondly choose, And seek a Satisfaction in, in vain; For here no lasting Joy can they obtain. Why then should any so unmindful be Of that great Off-spring of Eternity, Th'Immortal Soul? That Epitome of Wonder; Compar'd to which, all things beneath or under The Glorious Sun are vain! What can be given In change for this, whose proper Home is Heaven? Ah, what advantage will it be to gain The World, and plunge the Soul in Endless Pain! Alas! Earths transient, vain, deluding Toys, So fondly snatch'd at, for true lasting Joys, Tho' (as by Rattles oft a Crying Child Is for a season of the Breast beguil'd) They seem to please, can never satiate The Panting Soul, nor bring t'a Blessed State: Why should they thus be priz'd, my Friend! O seeing Thou art the Off-spring of th'Eternal Being: Whilst that the Lord of Lords invites thee, come, Love him that will conduct thee safely home, Unto himself; and in thy Heart reveal Eternal Life, as the abiding Seal Of his endeared Love: Then Heav'nly Joy Shall Consolate thy Heart Eternally. Alas, that thou hereby might'st rightly know How the abounding Streams of Love do flow To thee and others, with increasing Store; Its Boundless Current streams and issues more Than through the slender Conduit of a Quill, In such small sable Channels can distill: O may'st thou always at the Fountain dwell! For it's unseal'd to wrestling Israel. 1678. The Fourth Epistle to Cousin F. R. in Answer to one Received. Thine I have now receiv'd, which manifests Thou hast had some regard to my Requests; And by these good Effects, dost testify, Thou'rt not so much inclin'd to Vanity, To Childish Sports, and Time-beguiling Play, As thou hast been therein, and spent thy Day: Endeared Friend, may'st thou be yet more Wise, And let thy Mind find better Exercise; That thou may'st learn, with diligence, to wait To feel the Springing-Life Regenerate Thy Soul; whereby thou'lt know no greater tryal Can meet us here, than daily Self-denial: Suffer we must, if we expect to Reign With Christ, (or else our Expectation's vain) In Sorrows, as in Joys, participate. Alas! He never came to Consecrate A Way for us to true Felicity, Thro' curious Trims, and Silks of Princely Dy: This Path is not bestrew'd with Golden Crowns, Rich Coats of Arms, and Scepters of Renown; Nor yet with Oriental Gems, that be Such dazling Sparks unto the Carnal Eye: No, no; 'tis through the Cross we must obtain The Crown of Glory; other hopes are vain. This Men of Understanding knew of old, And prudently disdain'd that Idol Gold: Wise Solon told King Crœsus (when he sate In Gaudy Pomp upon his Throne of State) Doting upon his Wealth, in lofty Pride, Expecting almost to be Deify'd) That Peacocks with their spreading Plumes express A greater Lustre in their Nat'ral Dress, Than He in all his Glory; which, tho' he Disdain'd to own, whilst in Prosperity, Except with Frowns, nor car'd to meditate So deep a Sentence: Sudden change of State Thereto constrain'd, and taught him to confess, 'Tis neither Wealth nor Honour, that can bless Man's Heart with true Content; but rather do Betray, and bring to Misery and Wo. Therefore delight not in these fading things, Which suddenly may vanish as on Wings: But let true Wisdom teach thee, (no Excuse Avails to plead for precious Time's abuse) That with an humble Spirit thou array Thy self: This is a Robe will ne'er decay; No outward Ornament can beautify, As Lamb-like Meekness, inward Purity. Now, tho' for what thou sensible dost seem In thy Condition, thou of true esteem Art no less worthy, Love doth here constrain, With Heart and Pen, to be thus bold and plain; And that because thy Soliloquies do Express, what Truth obligeth thee unto, The deep Engagements of thy Soul: O then! Take heed, lest that alone with Tongue or Pen Thou honour him, and Heart be far remov'd; Or thou be found Persidious, being prov'd: 'Tis not because I evidenty see The Symptoms of such Consequence in thee; But, ah, the Stratagems and Subtilty Of the Deceiver, our grand Enemy, Are but too prevalent with some, except True Watch and Ward within be always kept: That thus my Exercised Heart indites Unto thee; and my Hand, thus guided, writes, With true Dependance on that Arm of Power, Which is to Isr'el's Seed a Refuge-Tower. And therefore, since thou hast in measure known Engagement from above, thou'rt not thine own, But purchas'd with a Price to serve the Lord, The Price of Blood; therefore obey his Word: Then shall he teach, instruct, and strengthen thee, To follow him in true Sincerity; And thou shalt daily know the bless'd increase Of sacred Solace from the Prince of Peace: And as thou hunger'st, daily may be fed With finest of the Wheat, and Heav'nly Bread; Yea, honey from the Rock, and drink new Wine, Distilling from the true and living Vine; And in its sweet Refreshing Shade sit down In Rest and Peace, ascribing all Renown, Honour, and Glory, unto Judah's Lion, The meek, the spotless, holy Lamb of Sion. 1678. To Cousin P. S. Love, that inviteth all Men, hath (I see) Extended its Engaging Hand to thee, Dear Child! Consider and incline thine Ear, Bow down in Meekness, and thou'lt quickly hear The still small Voice, which doth behind thee say, Come, follow me, this is the Heav'nly Way, Walk in it: Travel here, thoul't not be weary, (This Path leads on to Sion's Sanctuary) But diligently waiting, shall renew Thy Strength in Him, that's Holy, Just, and True, The blessed Prince of Everlasting Peace, Who, as obey'd, will plenteously increase His daily Favours in thee, and reveal His Holy Will, and strengthen to prevail Against thine Enemies, that do surround Thy Soul with Snares, whereby thy Griefs abound: This is indeed the good Samaritan, That binds up broken Hearts, and only can Heal the afflicted; but he loves to see Jacob bow down in deep Humility: For then's the time of Love; He then extends His Love to contrite Hearts; such he defends With his Indwelling Presence: Therefore Fear Always; for he delighteth to appear To those that fear his Name, and faithful be To what's made known; in small things, they shall see Dominion over much, if they forsake The Flatt'ring World, and Self, for Jesus sake, Who Suffer'd for us, and despis'd the Shame; He's only worthy over all to Reign. Stoop therefore to the Cross, and do not fear What Earth can do, tho' Mortals scoff and jeer, And persecute, as those have ever done, That stubbornly Rebel against the Son And Heir of Glory: Him they buffeted, Revil'd and scorn'd; and on his Comely Head They tauntingly did set a Crown of Thorn, Whose Head the Crown of Glory doth adorn. 'Twas He, that for his Foes resign'd his Breath, And by his Suffering conquer'd Hell and Death: Therefore let's Suffer with him, that we may Live in his Presence in th'Approaching Day; When all his Adversaries shall become But as a Footstool to be trampled on. 1679. Contemplation. Establishment in holy Fear, That I may know my Darling near, Is more to me Than all the Pleasures Earth can boast, Which are but Pleasing Pains at most, And Fading Vanity. O thou prevailing Prince of Peace! Reveal still more the bless'd Increase Of thy Authority And Government, that shall remain, But never end; that so thy Reign, In Dread and Majesty, May be Exalted over those That would thy Conqu'ring Arm oppose; But to the Joy Of all that humbly wait in fear, And love to see thee, Lord, appear In perfect Purity. 1679. An Epistle to M. J. Beloved Friend, thy Welfare every Day, And Preservation in Truth's holy Way, Is heartily desir'd; and that in Fear, And holy Dread, thy Soul may persevere To travel Sion's Path in Purity, Learning to dwell in true Humility. Ah, let us both, in lowliness of Mind, Bow to the Pow'r, by which the Heart's inclin'd, With true Sincerity, to stand and wait, In Silence of all Flesh, at Wisdom's Gate; Until the Heav'nly Lawgiver appear, And in the Heart reveal his Counsel near; Who teacheth Meekness; never to repay Railing for Railing; but in Love to pray For those that do despightfully accuse us, And with Revilings frequently abuse us. When Spotless Inuocency was by Men Accus'd, and Truth condemn'd; O did he then, By Verbal Arguments with them, assay To justifie his upright Cause, or say The least Reviling Word? Nay, surely Nay. How then dare any, whom his Boundless Love Hath once engag'd, if he be pleas'd to prove Their Faith by Trials, as in secret say, We'll follow him in a more easie Way? Can we, without the Cross, expect the Crown Of Everlasting Glory and Renown? Nay verily, except the Cross do kill The Self-hood, and subdue the Carnal Will, How can we hope Eternally to Reign With Him, who by his Suff'rings overcame? 'Tis not restraint from gross Iniquity, But Self-denial, inward Purity, And Holiness made perfect in his Fear, That finds acceptance, when he doth appear To Judge the Secrets of all Hearts, and bring Into the Presence of the highest King. Then 'tis the pure in Heart shall see the Lord, And sing Eternal Praise with one accord; Because they know that holy Name, whereby They were Redeem'd from all Iniquity; The Righteous enter Everlasting Joy. 1679. Meditations. O love! Thou Substance of the Royal Law, Let thy sweet Influencing Power draw Our troubled Hearts, in true Humility, To wait on thee with holy Fervency: For thou our Souls hast often visited, That we might, by thy tender hand, be led From Darkness unto Light; from Enmity, Strife and Contention, unto Unity, In Undefiled, in Unfeigned Love; Which, tho' it may in Gentleness reprove, Or otherwise instruct, it covers all Faults and Offences; yea, if any fall Through Weakness, it bears up with ready Hand, And lends a Shoulder, till such learn to stand, And walk more strongly: For it joys to see Brethren to dwell in perfect Unity, Only Contending who may most be found In Lowliness, that Love may more abound. But, ah, 'tis Hatred, Wrath, Revenge, and Strife, Discovers Faults, strikes at the very Life; Provoking oft one seeming Friend or Brother, To bite, despise, if not devour another, For empty Trifles; so that Vanity Becomes Vexatious, and Perplexity Of Spirit: For, as well observ'd by one, All things are Vanity below the Sun; The Sun of Righteousness, which when it shines With its Resplendent Conqu'ring Ray, refines The drossy Nature; rightly purifies The Heart, consuming all Impurities; Whereby, at last, the Enmity is slain, And Love exalted over all to Reign. Great Prince of Peace! Instruct our Souls to wait To be Establish'd in this happy State; Where Joys abound, and Enmity does cease, And Charity withal doth still increase; That, with thy dear Redeemed Ones, we may Walk Hand in Hand in Sion's blessed Way; Where no Iniquity can e'er be found, Nor Love wax cold, but more and more abound; Yea, Love that thinks no Evil, but doth seek The Good of all, and teacheth to be meek; Not easily provoked, but in Peace With all: Here Happiness shall still increase. Then may our cheerful Souls triumph, and sing Pure, holy, living Praise to Salem's King. 1679. The Fifth Epistle to Cousin F. R. When I (endeared Cousin) meditate, How Heav'n hath blest thee in thy tender State; Reading thy Lines, by Wisdom's Dictates pen'd, Which thou (by mutual Love engag'd) didst send, And weightily reflect upon the (strange To Flesh and Blood! but) truly happy Change That's wrought in thee, by that Eternal Power, That (as a Father) leads to Sion's Tower, The Rock of Ages, Us, that went astray, Wand'ring like Pilgrims, that had lost their Way In some vast Desart, where the Savage Bear, And other Savage Beasts, range here and there, To seek their Prey: Yet by a sacred Hand They're brought t'a happy Habitable Land. Methinks we're bound to say, with one accord, Who can enough admire thy Goodness, Lord! O how can such but much esteem their Guide! Who, had their careless Steps but turn'd aside, And frowardly left the Discover'd Way, Had certainly become a wretched Prey To those Devourers: Ah! Such was our case, Had not th'Eternal led us by his Grace: Which, let us ne'er forget, but Praises sing To our most Gracious Guide, dear Sion's King: Who by his holy Life (the Light within Reveal'd) redeems Believing Hearts from Sin; And the Obedient to the Lord's Command, Shall eat the Good and Sweetness of the Land; The Land of Promise, giv'n them to possess, (Though Murmurers fall in the Wilderness) Then shall they feel that Life, which as with Nerves And Joynts, unites, and tenderly preserves As Members of one Body; so to give Due Service to the Head, in whom we live, By distribution of that precious Blood, Which to the Body is both Life and Food; And tho' it may retire, yet soon again It circulates and flows through every Vein; Renewing Warmth, encreasing Strength, whereby The Body flourishes in Unity. As doubly thus engag'd, methinks I prize thee Much more than Pen and Ink can advertise thee: Then how can those, who feel these Streams of Love And Life, but prize each other far above Ontward Relations, yet rejoyce to see Them to partake of this bless'd Unity! Thus thou to me art now become more near Than formerly Related; yea, as dear As Children of one Father, mutually Oblig'd to Breathe for the Prosperity And Welfare of each other, in the pure Eternal Love, which makes Election sure, And seals Salvation to us; yea, I find My Soul, in Sympathizing Love, inclin'd, As for it self, so to desire for thee, That we in Faithfulness may ever be Freserv'd; tho' Tribulations should attend, Emmanuel, Almighty to defend, Is near; yea, nearer than our Hearts expect, Tho' often undiscern'd through our neglect; He's Omnipresent, tho' not always seen, For interposing Clouds may from us skreen His Countenance: This he permits, to try And prove our Love, our Chaste Fidelity. But still he leaves us Pledges of his Love, That, ah, methinks, nothing should ever move Our firm engaged Hearts! Yet we, poor we, Are weak, and subject to Infirmity; Apt to forget his Favours, multiply'd Towards us daily; apt to turn aside, Did not his Blessed Arm protect, defend, And still renew Engagements to depend Only on Him, who loves unto the end. 1679. The Sixth Epistle to Cousin F. R. Can I but frequently remember thee, Endeared Friend, when I such dangers see, That daily meet the Travellers that set Their Faces Sion-ward? Can I forget To Recommend thee to that Arm of Power, That keeps Worm Jacob, as a Fenced Tower? Nay, nay; Can any Heart but break or bleed, To view th'Affliction of the holy Seed, Which in that City of Chester.Careless City is oppress'd, Like to a tender Babe kept from the Breast? Ah! Dreadful is the State of those, that lay Such Stumbling-Blocks, to hinder from the Way That leads to Life, and by a bare Profession Discourage them that seek the true Possession. O! Can Luke-warm Laodicea be So Justify'd? No, no, the firm Decree, Without Repentance, may not be Repeal'd; What's done in Secret, soon shall be Reveal'd: Ah, let their Stumblings and Backslidings be A Caution, but no Stumbling-Block to thee! Wait in the Deep, to know Love's Streams distil, Like the refreshing Dew of Hermon's Hill: Then, as thou travell'st in the Valleys low, Where Shiloh's sacred Rivolet doth flow, Thou may'st be, by its quick'ning Influence, Preserved in an holy Living Sense Of Heav'nly Things: Which blessed Priviledge, The Rage or Strength of Men can ne'er abridge Us of. Nor yet can I unmindful be Of my own State, whilst I admonish thee; But, sensible of Weakness, pity those Whom great Offences frequently oppose, To hinder them, if possible, that they Might not persist to travel Sion's Way. And as the wicked Spies, that falsly told Discouragements to Israel of old, Excluded both themselves, and likewise those That, with them, did by Unbelief oppose The Heav'nly Promise; tho' the Faithful were Conducted safe, and took Possession there, Ev'n in the Land that did with Sweetness flow; So do the Sloathful and the Careless now Raise Doubtings, and Distrust of Victory, In all that do not, with true Fervency, Press forward Cheerfully, with holy Fear, Knowing their Captain of Salvation near. O let the Love, which set the Heart on Fire To follow him, increase a true Desire In thee, to persevere unto the End; For Isr'el's King for ever will defend All that upon Him faithfully depend. 1679. Meditations in Trouble. Alas, when my distressed Mind, Through secret drawings, is inclin'd, Great King! to wait on thee; O how the subtil Enemy Presents fond Fancies, to entice aside My Heart from true Stability; So to despise true lasting Joys, And entertain vain transitory Toys, Which ne'er can satiate the Soul, when try'd. O how would Sloath entice mine Eyes! My weary Eyes to Sleep, That had more cause to Weep, Because the Solace of my Soul seems gone, And left my Heart alone, Surrounded with a Troop of Enemies. O whither is he gone? Or where Shall I go mourn, till he appear, Who is my Life, my Love? Alas, how shall I move Him to return, that's secretly retir'd; Like unto one displeas'd, Who, till he be appeas'd, My Heart cannot be eas'd; He is one lovely, and to be admir'd! How long, alas, my Love, my Life, Wilt thou with-hold the Influence Of thy Enam'ring Countenance, The Light of Life! Bow down thine Ear To an afflicted Heart, and hear Its Cries and Groans, and grant Relief. Without thy Presence all's in vain; Alas! How long shall I complain? The Cause of Grief is not from thee. Is there not some Iniquity, That keeps thus at a distance from my Love? Or art thou pleas'd to shroud Me thus, as in a Cloud? How long, Lord, shall it be Before thou please to answer from above? 'Tis none but thee, thou Holy One! 'Tis thy Prevailing Light alone Can rend the Vail, and all these Clouds remove: It's thou that grieves for me, And makes my Soul in Sympathy, Thus to pant after thee, thou God of Love. 1679. Concerning Trials. Alas, How hard a thing It is to bring Into a true Subjection, Flesh and Blood, Quietly to entertain (And not complain) Those Exercises that attend for Good! My Life, my Joy, my Love, If thus thou please to Prove And Exercise my poor perplexed Mind, Teach me to wait in Fear, That I may learn to bear What Trials may attend, of any kind: And, guarded by thy Ray, Walk in the Way, That leads directly to the Throne of Grace; Where, in Humility Poor, I may be Admitted to sit down i'th' Heav'nly Place: And there to thee discharge My Griefs at large, As to a Bosom-Friend, that bears with me, And often passes by Faults of Infirmity: Alas, I cannot bear too much for thee! Then work thy Blessed Will, So to fulfil Thy Sacred Counsel, for a further Trial; All Trials work for good (Tho' cross to Flesh and Blood) To them that follow thee in Self-denial; Bearing the Cross; for so Thine come to know We have a just High Priest, that's pleas'd to be (Altho' he dwells above What Grief can move) Touch'd with a sense of our Infirmity. Ah, let us ne'er forget, When sore beset With Tribulation, or when Snares surround, Humbly to lean to thee! Then shall we see The Joys of thy Salvation to abound. So Living Praises due (Thou Holy, Just, and True) To thee, thy dear Redeemed may proclaim, And in Sincerity May Magnify, With Heart and Tongue, thy great Eternal Name. 1679. Amen. A Meditation in Retirement. O thou, great King of Kings, arise and Reign! Except thy Vertue springs, all Worship's vain; Except thy Quick'ning Life be felt to rise, There's none can offer up a Sacrifice, That finds acceptance with so great a King: And then, who dare into thy Presence bring The Blemished, the Maimed, or the Blind, Which with an Earthly Prince could never find Any Regard; but rather for the same, Severe Chastizement, with Rebuke and Shame. O let thy holy Power operate Within thy Temple, thou Immaculate Holy, High Priest! O let thy Hand prepare The Sacrifice! Then Isr'el may not fear To find Admittance to the Royal Throne; Thou'lt smell the Sweetness, and accept thy own: We'll wait in Patience, and depend on thee, Thou only canst Rebuke the Enemy; That old Deceiver, Satan, though he stand Among thy Children, as at the right Hand Of Joshua; 'tis thy own Arm alone Can save the Brand pluck'd from the Fire, or none. 'Tis thou that tak'st the filthy Garment from us, And in thy Love art pleas'd to put upon us Thy Royal Robe of Righteousness, whereby We find access before thy Majesty, To touch thy Glorious Scepter, and appear Before the Throne of Grace; where, over Fear, Love sweetly hath prevail'd: Yet shall there be An holy Awe in all that worship thee, An humble (deep-engaged) Filial Fear, As to a tender Father, from his dear Obedient Off-spring; watchful to attend His holy Precepts; fearful to offend, For very Love; not as in Slavery, Dreading the Laws of just Severity; But as by Love engag'd, which fills the Breast With Satisfaction, not to be express'd With Mortal Tongue; as thou wast pleased, by Th'Apostle, whom thou lov'dst, to signify. We're now thy Sons, Great King! but who can tell What we shall be hereafter, when we dwell With thee in Glory? Can the Hand of Man Measure the Fulness of the Ocean? Then may a Finite Engine testify The Boundless Splendor of Eternity. 1679. Of MODESTY. Some covet to be deck'd in Rich Attire, With Gold and Pearl, that others may admire, Esteem, and honour them; and that they may Advance a Beauty, that will soon decay. If Imperfections did not lodge within, What mean these Deckings of the fading Skin? They, in whose noble Breast true Vertue dwells, Need not so much t'adorn their outward Shells; For Modesty doth many ways express, To all Observers, innate Comeliness: Modest Attire, and Meekness, signify A Mind compos'd of Native Purity. Needs no Appendices so to set forth A Jewel of a more admired worth, Than Indian Mines can boast; those beautify A Sepulchre, and make it fair to th' Eye; But this shews Innate Worth, and adds thereto Such Lustre, those alone could never shew: For where there is a Chaste Retired Mind, Th' Apparel, Gesture, Speech, and Look's confin'd Within the Bounds of Modesty, proclaim An Upright Heart, kept clear from Spot or Stain: This both adorns the Gravity of Age, And doth in Blooming Years timely presage A right Heroick Heart; where Liberty, That's inconsistent with true Modesty, Is not desir'd: Such study to behave Themselves Discreetly, Modest, Meek, and Grave; But if a Smile appear, such as a Child Reflects on's Mother, in Love undefil'd, 'Tis guarded with such simple Innocence, As gives no just occasion of Offence. For Modesty in Covenant doth bind The Eyes, lest they prove Traytors to the Mind; But ne'er instructs the Hand to plant a Snare, Lay Nets with gaudy Garments, plaited Hair, Or other Golden Superfluities, To captivate vain Hearts, and wand'ring Eyes: No, it abhors whatever seems to be A Blemish unto Chaste Simplicity: Yet proves it self a far more Potent Charm, Than wanton Looks; but daunts approaching harm, Like some strong Fortress, whence the Enemy Retreats, despairing of a Victory. Thus Modesty, and Spotless Innocence, Is often to its self a sure Defence. This is the Virgin's Ornament, whereby Beauty's adorn'd; for this doth Beautify, Where fading Colours flourish not, and may Be term'd a Dow'r, whose Worth shall ne'er decay, Sure Men, as Men, cannot forget to prize it; Tho' some, as Bruits, not minding it, despise it; Else would their Words and Gesture rarely be So Poysonous, with gross Impiety: Obscene Discourse, that horrid Smoak that fumes From scorching Darkness, that within consumes Some broyl'd tormented Hearts, cannot proceed From a Chaste Breast; no Rose brings forth a Weed. For this doth always constantly retain Such an abhorrence of all frothy, vain, Absurd Expressions, that 'twill manifest, The sad Resentment of a troubled Breast, In Crimson Colours; which do oft appear In modest Blushes, when th' unwilling Ear Is made partaker of such words as be A bold Affront to Spotless Modesty. Altho' there doth no inward Guilt upbraid, Or bring Indictment; yet, with Looks dismay'd, They signify Disgust, and seem to fear They should be Censur'd, being present where Such Words were utter'd (tho' injuriously) As one with them in the Conspiracy. Some say, 'Tis Treason but to lend an Ear To Treasonable Speeches, and forbear T' Accuse, or else to leave the Company. Thus Chaste Clitomachus, through Modesty Quickly departing, shew'd that he abhorr'd The needless Guilt of an Uncivil Word, When'er he heard it; and 'twas worthily Recorded, to instruct Posterity. For tho' the Dictates in each Humane Breast, Would, if observ'd, teach all Men to detest Such Criminal Expressions, as declare Their Owners odious to a Modest Ear; Yet Precedents of Vertue may be found Of good Effect, when those of Vice abound. Nor let it seem to any sober Mind A Paradox, that Modesty should find A place in either Sex, altho' it be Ascribed to the one peculiarly. Reason, that honours Mankind more than Beast, Gives forth its Laws and Dictates in each Breast; Vertue should therefore in both Sexes dwell; Some may in these, and some in those excel: Yet this, with many more, are not confin'd To either solely; but the prudent Mind In both embrace it; for it Regulates Deportment both in high and low Estates: For where she dwells, insulting Arrogance, Or any unbecoming Confidence, Must not remain, lest these defile and stain The Heart, where Vertue should prevail and reign; That Modesty may, by its Influence, Hide and avoid occasion of Offence. As Scripture-Record to Posterity, Doth Chronicle the Virgin Modesty Of Shem and Japhet, who went back to hide The Nakedness their Brother did deride; On whom the Curse became thereby entail'd To after-Ages, but a Blessing seal'd To them, and to their Progeny, whose Names (Like to a precious Ointment, that retains Its fragrancy) shall still inherit Praise, And be a Precedent to latter Days. For tho' the Memory of some doth rot, Vertue shall live, and never be forgot: The Wise in Heart esteem it, and thereby Order their Conversation prudently; And would not an unseemly Act commit, Tho' Mortal Eye should ne'er discover it: For Modesty, that in their Bosom reigns, Detests and loaths whatever spots or stains; Restraining from all Rudeness, it inclines To Gravity and Meekness, and refines The Language; intimating, that we should Be swift to hear, but never over-bold To speak, tho' Eloquent; and then take heed, Lest Words extravagantly may exceed A mild and civil Tone; for spoken loud, They seem to Summons-in the list'ning Crowd: Nor should they savour of Scurrility; For these are not th'Effects of Modesty, Which never can delight in Calumnies, Abusing others with Tongue-Injuries, Although revil'd: Civility disdains To vie in Folly, where no Prize pertains Unto the Victors; the true Noble Mind Conquers a Wrong by Patience, is resign'd For Vertue's sake to bear, that Reason may Be Re-enthron'd, and Passion pass away. Th' Examples, which the Ancients did afford Hereto, are many, left upon Record; For Civil Natures dictates in each Breast, Do far exceed what here can be express'd. 1679. Meditation. Alas, Alas! This Day Seems almost past away; What shall I say? My Love Doth hide his Face from me, Who Sorrows in Perplexity: Ah, shall not Sighs and Groans prevail to move Unto Compassion? Shall My drooping Spirit call And cry, but find no Ear, No Entrance, no Access, To ease my Heart in great Distress? Ah, Lord! How long canst thou forbear to hear? Great Dreadful Majesty, Whose Omnipotency Is Omnipresent! Doth not Love Always abound with thee? Yea surely, though it be Thine holy Pleasure thus sometimes to prove. Especially when we Have slighted thee, Or to thine Enemy inclin'd, Or have not kept retir'd, Nor fervently desir'd Thy Presence with a right composed Mind. Yet, O my Chiefest Love! Thy rowling Bowels move, And thee to Pity now constrain, Thy Condescending Ear Could not forget to hear, Nor shall Worm Jacob's Seed for Want complain. Worthy art thou to be Sought to in Fervency; The Careless Ones shall not prevail: Thou, Gracious Prince indeed, Favours the Wrestling Seed; This, in its Expectation, cannot fail. Thy sweet Encouragement In season does prevent All Doubtings and Distrust that can Arise, if faithfully Our Hearts depend on thee; Thou waits to manifest thy Love to Man. O teach my Soul to wait At th'Posts of Wisdom's Gate, In holy Fear! So to be found Prepar'd to meet with thee In true Sincerity, In whose sweet Presence Heav'nly Joys abound. 1679. On ELIJAH. O how th'Eternal Goodness from above Distils upon his Children show'rs of Love! And in the midst of Trials manifests Supporting Solace in their Panting Breasts; Engaging those, whom chiefly he designs, To set for Witnesses in Trying Times; Refreshing, feeding, strength'ning, and directing Safely, with his Indulgent Arm protecting, And hiding in the hollow of his Hand, Those that are faithful to his just Command. Thus was that holy Prophet of the Lord, Elijah, shelt'red from the threatning Sword Of cruel Jezabel, whose raging Breath Had vow'd, by all her Idols, sudden Death Unto this Man of God (although in vain) For seeking to lead Isr'el back again Unto the Lord, who then were gone astray, And wandred in a dark forbidden Way: Th'Almighty's sacred Power did surround And guard him, but his Enemies confound. Now, tho' Elijah thought himself alone, Surviving all true Prophets, and that none Were left but him, there was Seven Thousand more Preserv'd alive, that only did adore The God of Jacob, would not bow the Knee Unto, or worship Baal's false Deity. This Heav'n reveal'd unto him, when he sate, As one in Sorrow, in dejected State; Because the Sacred Name was then revil'd By Priests of Baal, the holy Prophets kill'd: For thus the Lord doth in his Wisdom try The utmost of Man's Wrath and Cruelty, As may conduce to th'Honour of his Name, But the remainder shall his Arm restrain. And though that be permitted to extend Affliction to the Body, put an end To poor Mortality, here is Man's Rage Confin'd; whilst from a weary Pilgrimage, Th'Immortal Soul releas'd, arrives with Joy Unto the Haven of Felicity, Where the more Noble Soul lives to survive Those short-liv'd Sorrows, and forgets to grieve; Whose Everlasting Glory doth transcend Expression, or what Man can comprehend: Yet when th'Eternal pleaseth to oppose The base Designs and Stratagems of those That would destroy, or wickedly suppress His Faithful Ones, whom he intends to Bless, He soon can blast their Projects, and confound Their chiefest Agents; with a Word, surround His own, as with a bright Celestial Host Of Seraphims. Let not the Mighty boast Themselves in Strength: Can Man resist his Hand? The Thorns and renting Bryars then may stand In Battle, to oppose Consuming Fire. Let Isr'el bow before him, and admire His mighty Arm, and magnify his Name: He guardeth whom he will; his Pow'r's the same, Which formerly the holy Prophet fed, And by th' obsequious Ravens sent him Bread; Yea, Bread and Flesh, early and late, they brought Him, who his Maker's Glory chiefly sought; And for his Drink, Brook Cherith did supply With Water; which, for want of Rain, grown dry, Unto Zarephta, by Command, he came, Where a poor Widow (tho' to entertain A Guest, but meanly furnish'd) did receive The Prophet; and, through Faith, she freely gave Part of her small, her almost wasted Store, Which she had thought a little time before To dress for her, and for her Son, thereby To be refresh'd, and shortly after Dye; Not knowing of so strange Increase, until The holy Man, that knew the Heav'nly Will, Did, by Divine Authority, proclaim, That till the Lord was pleas'd to send down Rain (Which then with-held, for the Iniquity That did abound, had brought th'Extremity Of Dearth and Famine) her small Stock of Meal, And little Cruise of Oyl, should never fail; Which she believing, from the Holy Word, Liv'd to admire the Wonders of the Lord Upon her Son, whom, when depriv'd of Breath, Elijah did prevail to call from Death, By fervent Supplication to that Pow'r That can the Dead to Life again restore; That unto her it might not seem to be Hard Measure for her Hospitality. Thence, by Commission from above, he came To bring glad tidings of long-sought-for Rain; That Israel might yet again incline To seek the Lord, who by his Power divine, Gives or with-holds a Blessing; and might learn, By those and other Wonders, to discern The Living God from Idols, who alone Answers by Fire from's Imperial Throne, As then 'twas prov'd, to their amaze and shame: Yet when some sought the Prophet to be slain, He to the Wilderness again retir'd, Where, tho' he, as in Agony, desir'd The Lord to take away his Life; yet there, To comfort him, an Angel did appear; Who, touching him, bad him arise and take What he found ready there; which was a Cake Bak'd on the Coals: O who can but admire How there the Cake was Bak'd on Coals of Fire! For which he took no care; and for his Drink, A Cruise of Water set! Ah, who would think The King of Kings should be concern'd for these Small matters for poor Man! who, if he please, Can well support, without the Strength of Bread, As then he did that holy Prophet lead Through th'Sandy Desart forty days, until He came to Horeb's Mount, the sacred Hill, Where, resting in a Cave, the great Command Then given to him was, Go forth and stand Before the Lord, his Wonders to admire; The rending Wind, the Earthquake, and the Fire, Pass'd by, but he in none of these did see Such Soul-amazing dreadful Majesty, As in the still small Voice; then, as with Dread And Reverence, his Face he covered, Or wrapped in his Mantle, stood to hear What more the Lord was pleased to declare, Or to command him; that he humbly might Obey his Precepts, which was his delight. Thus was he treated by the Holy One, And afterwards caught up unto his Throne, As in a Fiery Chariot, where, above All Grief, he Joys in pure Eternal Love: Yet who dare say, that for his sake alone, Such great, such glorious Wonders then were done? Did not th'Eternal Wisdom signify His Boundless, his all-Conqu'ring Love, thereby To all his Faithful Servants? Ah, Can He Cease to be Gracious, or Unmindful be Of his afflicted tribulated Ones? Nay surely, he hath own'd them for his Sons And for his Daughters; and if they be found Faithful to Death, they shall with Life be Crown'd: For he delights to Glorify his Name Amidst the Heathen: Therefore 'tis in vain For Men to Curse whom he designs to Bless, Or by their Laws to hinder Righteousness From running like a Stream; tho' formerly They pleaded Law, whereby the Just must dye; Who now, and ever, lives sole King of Kings, To whom the Angels Hallelujah sings. Of CHASTITY. Vertue's its own Reward; and Innocence, Where'er it dwells, a Fortress of Defence; And in the Confines of pure, Chastity, The Heav'n Born Soul finds joyful Liberty, And pleasant Freedom; far surpassing all The Latitude of base, luxurious Thrall, Wherein the captivated Heart's inclin'd To dote on Trifles, where it cannot find True Solace, suiting the Nobility Of that which sprung from Immortality: Then why should any, stiled Rational, So slight their Princely Great Original, As to sit down content, to equalize Themselves to Bruits, and sordidly despise Enjoyments more sublime, which gratify The Noble Intellectual Faculty, Proper alone to Creatures Rational? To be preferr'd before those Criminal Polluting Pleasures, which do so incense The injur'd (if not seared) Conscience, As much allays their present seeming Joys, And feeds the gnawing Worm that never dyes; Whilst prudent Minds delight to Contemplate The Wisdom of that Pow'r, that did Create And Form the Universe: The Mystery Of Natures scarce observed Harmony, And that Intrinsick Vertue, that is found In some familiar Concrets to abound, Brings a Delight inferiour to none, Save the Indwelling of that Lord alone, That gives the Knowledge of them, and did frame Them, to the Glory of his holy Name: The sweet Experience whereof, I find, Is, by a Noble and Ingenious Mind, Acknowledged; asserting it to raise The Heart, to celebrate their Maker's Praise. Why then should so much Time, Expence, and Cost, Be on some vain deluding Objects lost? Which, as with Chains, do bind in Slavery, And overwhelm, in gross Impurity, Some doting Mortals, whose depraved Sense Can taste no Pleasures, not derived thence. But where unstained Chastity doth reign, The Mind kept pure, is apt to entertain Joys more refin'd; and then, if any rude Disturbing Thought would secretly intrude, 'Tis soon expell'd, and banish'd from that Breast, Where Chastity hath taken up her rest: For here the Thoughts, the Words and Actions be Well season'd, with an awful Gravity; The good Effects of an Internal Law, Which doth, by its prevailing Precepts, draw Unto Obedience; whose Recompence Doth far surmount all transient Joys of Sense: Yet, ah, how many make it their Design, T'entice the Soul, and lead beyond the Line Of Innate Law, through pleasant Confidence, Bringing at last to Boundless Impudence; That Enemy to Vertue, that Prophane Preludium unto a Tragick Scene, Which doth by Heart-beguiling Pastimes bring The yielding Captives to the wounding Sting Of inward Horror, a tormenting Pain, That frets their Hearts, involv'd in lasting Shame; Whilst Peace and Honour evermore remains To them, in whose chaste Breast true Vertue reigns. Both Sexes are adorn'd by Chastity, For, as Recorded to Posterity, Great Heroes, for their Valour much renown'd, If in their Princely Bosoms this was found, As by a Law to limit; such did gain A more enobling Lustre to their Name: But those, from whom great Armies conquer'd fled, That by a wanton Heart were vanquishéd, (Though Fortitude is not to be forgot) This to their Names is a perpetual Blot. Who conquers Self, Vertue more Noble calls, Than he that overthrows the strongest Walls: Then for the Blushing Sex, what Tongue can tell The Infamy that on her Name shall dwell, That wants the Ornament of Chastity? 'Tis a Reproach unto her Memory: But she that keeps her Mind retir'd and chaste, Her Praise shall flourish; Fame nor Envy's blast Can never blemish it; that Happy Peace, That in her Bosom lives, shall never cease. This therefore is to some a Pearl as dear As Life; and such do less regard or fear The loss of Life, and all, than once to stain Their chaste reserved Souls, with guilt and shame. Thus fair Matilda rather chose to dye A Martyr to her Spotless Chastity, Than with a gnawing Guilt and Horror live In all the Pleasures that a Court can give; Who, tho' with Mortals she be ceas'd to dwell, She lives where Joys Immortal do excel All Vanities on Earth; and here her Name Doth still in Honour and Esteem remain. Vertue bestows a Crown of Endless Praise On all that to it Consecrate their Days. 1679. Of a FRIEND. If I to Love would be inclin'd, And, without seeking, knew to find One, whose unblemish'd Outward Case, Princely Deportment, Comely Grace, Might unto each observant Eye Denote the true Nobility Of an Heroick Heart and Mind, (From sordid Vanity sublim'd) Sincerely Pious, Loyal, Chaste, And with such Inward Peace possest, That Blust'ring Storms could ne'er prevent True Inward Solace and Content: Whom Prosp'rous Lot exalts not high, Nor can a cross Adversity Much discompose; observing well, That all things here are mutable; Who rightly knows to prize a Friend, Without a base sinister End. And though a Competency here Of needful things, without much care Enjoying, knows Treasure laid up, Secur'd from Theft, and Moths corrupt; Yet here, in Visibles, can see The Wisdom of Eternity; And knowing Rule, and Ruling know, In true Dominion things below; Meek, though Majestick; Valiant, and That Self and Passion can command: Rich in all Vertues, to compleat A Noble Heart, more Good than Great; 'Tis such an one as this shall be Much Honour'd, and Esteem'd by me. A Meditation. Ah, Lord! Why hid'st thou now thy Face from me? My Soul expects no Comfort but from thee; No Joy, but Grief; no Solace can be found, But Soul-distracting Sorrows still abound Within my troubled Breast; if thou retire, Or hide thy Face, all my Delights expire. How can I Live, except thy Quick'ning Breath Breathe on me, and subdue the Pow'r of Death? Ah, let my Heart thy Holy Ghost receive, That so a Resurrection from the Grave I may not only know, but be renew'd In strength, to press ev'n through a Multitude Of Tribulations, Lord, to follow thee! Which if they sometimes as a trial be, To prove the Love, whereto thou dost engage My Heart and Soul, in this Backsliding Age, Let many Waters never quench the same, But rather be as Oyl pour'd on the Flame; Which quickens, not extinguisheth the Fire: So may these Trials rouze my dull Desire Still more and more in Fervency to move And tend to thee, thou pure Eternal Love: For, ah, the warmth of thy Enliv'ning Ray, Proclaims the Dawning of th' Eternal Day; Which secretly Incourages to bear These light Afflictions; for the Day draws near, Wherein shall be a Glory (far transcending These Griefs) reveal'd, a Glory never ending: But, Lord, support me; there's no Trial can So far perplex, that on the outward Man May be impos'd; no Sorrow that can be Like the withdrawing of thy self from me: Thou only art the Solace of my Soul, To thee let my distressed Heart condole Her Troubles; for there's none like that, when thou With Frowns beclouds the Brightness of thy brow; Or secretly with-holds the Glorious Ray, Which is my Sun and Shield, my Strength and Stay; My chiefest Counsellor, mine All: Ah, then How can my Troubles be described by Pen! The Threats of this vain World shall not afflict me, Except the Darling of my Soul reject me: For it's thine Absence is the greatest Grief, Thy loving Presence is a true Relief. O 'tis my long'd-for Joy, mine only One! This Blessing therefore grant me, Lord, or none. O 'tis thy Love that thus engageth me, To wrestle with, and follow after thee! And tho' to prove me, thou may'st tarry long, Preserve in Patience, let me never wrong Thy Favours, so as once to entertain Another Lover, or to turn again In Heart to Egypt: Can her Garlick be Of any pleasant Savour now to me, Or any other Soul, that once hath fed On Manna-Delicates, or Angels Bread? Which even in the Desart thou affords Abundantly, as Holy Writ records Thou didst of Old: No, no, 'twas Penury Enforced (in that Land of Slavery) To feed thereon. If thy indulgent Care Provide, and feed my Soul with better Fare, Teach me to prize thy Love; 'tis now the same; To Isr'el's Seed, thou say'st not, Wait in vain; But thou appear'st, who always do'st regard Thy Breathing Babes, and with thee thy Reward Of inward Comfort's known, with an Increase Of Joy, and Earnest of Eternal Peace, To those that keep thy Covenant; to them Thy Promises are all Yea and Amen. 1680. Of the Rainbow. O how Stupendious are thy Wonders, Lord, Which thou Effectest by thy Living Word! How Gloriously Presented every where, Do they to the discerning Eye appear! Which, as it views the Outside, may discover The Inward Wonder, by the Shell vail'd over. Hath not each Visible a Mystery? Doth not each Herb proclaim a Deity? Which, with so fine an Essence, gave it Birth, Out of the gross dark Bowels of the Earth. If these familiar little Creatures be Such cause of Admiration, what may we Observe in this vast Concave of the Sky, So full of Wonders to a Searching Eye? Do not the Heav'nly Orbs declare thy Glory, Great King, as in an Universal Story? Sun, Moon and Stars do, by their Light, proclaim A Power divine, and magnify thy Name: Can then this curious Semi-circle, deck'd With such pure undy'd Colours, but affect Our Hearts with Dread and Wonder? Can a Sign Of such Concern and Glory (by Divine Authority plac'd in the Firmament, To signify that Gracious Covenant, Which, for thy Goodness, for thy Mercy's sake, Thou, in thy tender Pity, pleas'd to make With poor Ungrateful Mortals, that thereby They might believe, Floods should no more destroy All Animals) pass unobserv'd? Though Man, Through his ambitious Ignorance, began Soon to insult, altho' in vain; his Power And Policy, both fail'd at Babel's Tower: Yet hast thou not remov'd this signal Token Of thy endearing Love; nor rashly broken Thy lasting Cov'nant; but thereby dost shew, That thou alone art Faithful, Just and True. O can this great Memorial to the Nation, The Rainbow, but excite our Admiration, When it appears! Were not the Signs of Heaven, And Wonders in the Earth, ordain'd and given For more sublime Designs, than only be Look'd at, and gaz'd on, by Mortality? Did not the great Apostle once attest, That things invisible are manifest By those that do appear? Did not hereby Some of the Gentiles learn Divinity? Why may they not as well excite and raise Our Hearts, to celebrate the Author's Praise? 1680. Of CONTENT. Who seeks a Prize where 'tis not to be found, Makes his Confusion but the more abound: So they that dote on Riches that have Wings, Or any other transitory things, Do but with great perplexing Cares prevent That which they most pretend to seek, Content. Where may it then be sought? Behold, it lies Hid, as a Treasure, from the Vult'rous Eyes: Yet there's a Garden where this Plant doth grow, Which who desires to find, must learn to know A Heart that's well refin'd and purify'd From high-aspiring discontented Pride; Disdaining to admire that Idol, Gold, But can, as with undazled Eyes, behold Its Earth-bred Lustre; knowing how to use it, Not hoarding it to rust, that's to abuse it; That cannot for vile Pleasures prostitute The noble Soul to grovle with the Brute; That cannot be so bound to Humane Fashion, As to be over-sway'd with Furious Passion: But doth, as with a well-composed Mind, Hear Self revil'd and scorn'd; yet not inclin'd Unto Revenge, but still refers the wrong To Him, to whom all Vengeance doth belong; And can in inward Purity rejoyce, Tho' Vertue's branded with the Name of Vice; That doth in Joy such equal Temper know, That Sorrow cannot make it stoop too low, Nor be afraid, altho' the World should frown; Nor yet forget himself, through vain Renown; That counts an Injury worth no Reward, Save only this, a Noble Disregard; That's unto slavish Fear so much a Stranger, That it undaunted meets approaching Danger; Yea, high and low Estates can calmly bear, Without Disturbance or distracting Care; That honours Vertue, though in Poverty, Rather than Vice, puff'd up with Dignity; Whose equal Justice cannot vex his Foe, Nor spare his Friend, if that his Cause says, No; Who, tho' in Pow'r, would not inflict a Wrong; Nor yet can see th' Oppressed suffer long, Without Relief; but cheerfully doth lend A Helping-hand to Enemy or Friend; Whose Word's more binding than a Golden Chain, Who stedfast to his Promise doth remain; And will perform it, tho' no Ear attend, To testify betwixt him and his Friend; Who, in great multiplicity, can find A calm and wisely-recollected Mind; Knowing, that Heav'n did never This ordain A Slave to Earth, but over it to reign: And having Treasure, which no Rust can rot, Doth use the World, as if he us'd it not: And cheerfully submit to Providence, (Not by constraint) in what it doth dispence; Whether in Storms or Trials; for he knows That Promis'd Comforts appertain to those That mourn; or if his Lord and Master please, Can Joy in Sun-shine, or more prosp'rous Days; Knowing th' Eternal Wisdom never errs, Therefore sincerely in his Thoughts prefers That Will before his own; so comes to learn, Wisdom and Love in all things to discern; Who need not boast what Ancestors have been, When all their Vertues shine more bright in him; Which is a greater Honour than to be The Refuse of some Famous Pedigree; This knows such Peace the World can ne'er prevent, Here's that much sought-for, durable Content. 1680. An Epistle to M. R. This Opportunity did me invite, Dear Cousin, (tho' with Scribbling Pen) to write These Lines unto thee, thus to manifest I have not yet excluded from my Breast Th'Remembrance of thee; neither Time nor Place, Though far remote, should cancel or deface The Monument of Friendship in that Mind, That is to th' Everlasting Truth inclin'd. O may this always our Instructor be! Then shall we live in constant Amity: Let Truth in th' Inward Part be always dear Unto thee, then thy Counsellor is near; Who will instruct thee, how thou may'st behave Thy self at all times, modest, meek, and grave; That thou may'st find that Peace, which doth excel All Visible Enjoyments, and so dwell In Undefiled Love, that will attend The truly humble Heart unto the end. An Epistle to Cousin J. R. Could pious Paul desire that dreadful State, To be anathemiz'd, or separate From Jesus Christ, his high esteemed Lord, For Isr'elites, to whom the Heavenly Word, The Promises and Law, did appertain, The People unto whom the Cov'nants came, His Kindred in the Flesh? Then how can I Be unconcern'd for thee, my near Ally? No, no; for Love, the Universal Love, Which tenderly doth visit from above, Desires the good of all; takes no delight That Sinners die in Sin, but doth invite All to return to Him, and Live; for He Hath promis'd their Iniquity shall be Forgotten, they in Righteousness shall live; And He, to them that overcomes, will give A Crown of Life; yea, they shall splendidly Be cloath'd with Robes of Immortality. Consider well these things, my Friend, and learn To know what chiefly is thy great Concern; That Noble Off-spring of the Deity, Why should it be seduc'd with Vanity? O come, and in true lowliness of Mind, Receive Instruction! Seek, and ye shall find, Is a Sufficient Warrant to begin To seek the piece of Silver, hid within The House, thy Heart; Redeem thy precious Time, And find it out. O let thy Mind incline Unto the Voice, that doth in secret say, As one behind thee, This is Wisdom's Way, Walk in it; this will lead to lasting Joys; Despise them not for transitory Toys. Aim'st thou at Honour? Know, a sudden Puff Blasts it, and often leaves a Stinking Snuff. Ah, see'st thou not, that here all vain Renown Is dash'd and disannulled with a Frown? Seek Honour from above, and fear the Lord, And hearken to his holy living Word, Hid in thy Heart, that frequently reproves: Wisdom rebukes, and chastens whom she loves. But where there's no Reproof, there's cause of fear, Lest that the Holy One cease striving there: Such may too late bewail themselves, and say, O that I might be spar'd another Day! What can a wounded Spirit satiate, When Soul and Body must be separate? Whilst therefore Time doth unto thee remain, Take up the Cross, and own that holy Name, Christ crucify'd, and risen from the Grave, Whose Life's the Light of Men, that comes to save. But what avails to read the History! In silence learn to know the Mystery: For inwardly the Heart's defil'd with Sin, Therefore Salvation must be wrought within, By that which humbles, and that boweth down To Judgment; first the Cross, and then the Crown. The Word is as a Fire to purify The Heart of Man from all Iniquity, Before it be a Word of Consolation, And bring the Soul glad tidings of Salvation. All this (I hope) thou know'st; but he that knows it Is not thereby approv'd, but he that does it: The Doer of the Word is Justify'd, Because he by the same is Sanctify'd. Slight not the day of small things, lest there be Greater with-holden and conceal'd from thee. Was it not said, when Ephr'im was a Child, I loved him (that's lowly, meek, and mild?) O be not high and lofty, but come down, With quick Zacheus, if thou'lt gain the Crown Of Life and Peace! Hark, doth not Jesus say, Salvation's come unto thy House this day? If thou'lt receive it, cast it not away. 1680. An ELEGY. The fairest Flow'rs are not secur'd from Blasts, The strongest Tow'rs must unto Ruin yield, Each Visible unto its Period hastes, And by Retreat all call'd to quit the Field; Both Animals and Vegetables fall, Nature to common Change exposeth all: None can secure himself. Man, tho' possest Of that great Faculty, styl'd Rational, May plead no Priviledge above the rest, But stoop to th'Fate o'th' meanest Animal: Yet herein doth a Mystick Grandeur lie, He hath a Nobler Part can never dye. Altho' remov'd from Converse with his Friend; Relations and Acquaintance, are depriv'd Of his Society, Words can't extend T'unequal Objects; some are therefore griev'd Thus to be separated each from other; From a dear Father, or a tender Mother. O can their Off-spring be so unconcern'd, As not a little to Breathe forth their Grief, Where Sympathetick Bowels often yearn'd, Yet cannot now administer Relief To either side! Survivers may complain, Mourn and lament their absence, but in vain. But yet we may a little ruminate On by-past things, impressed on the Mind, And (tho' with grief) revolve that former State, When each in others Joys did Solace find; And let their Vertues flourish in each Breast, And Mem'ries live, tho' they are gone to rest. Ah, he is gone, who was a Father dear Unto his Off-spring, with a tender Eye, Waiting for good; tho' seemingly severe, When careless Crimes enforc'd Severity: As famous Judges often Sentence give With Tears, so he with the Chastiz'd did grieve. This dear Paternal Love did more engage His Childrens Hearts, than here may be exprest, Alluring (as it were) our tender Age To his advice; Love's Conquest is the best. Let others boast their forc'd Authority, Reigning like Tyrants in their Family. Nor did he count it as his chiefest Care, To gather for them Superfluity, Knowing that Earth-bred Wealth is oft a Snare, Whereby the Heart's engag'd to Vanity: His Gen'rous Spirit rather was inclin'd To furnish them with Treasures of the Mind. And though, in outward shew, he did appear Less forward in professing things divine, His Heart was not without an holy Fear; Light in his Youthful Days began to shine, And shew to him the empty Vanity Of Rome's seducing Soul-Idolatry. For when he was, by a Related Friend, Solicited their Fancies t'entertain, Who urging (when his Life seem'd near its end) To dye a Catholick, 'twas all in vain: The sacred Precepts of the blessed Truth Began to spring up in his Blooming Youth. So that, for all the Favours he receiv'd From that Relation, or great hopes of more, By promise due, he would not be deceiv'd To own those Principles he knew before Were Men's Inventions: Thus Heav'n secretly Did shroud and keep him from such Subtilty. And in succeeding Days did plainly shew A Way more excellent, a blessed Way; Whereby he, to his Satisfaction, knew That Path, wherein Fools walking cannot stray: Now, let his Weakness be forgotten quite, And with his Dust be buried out of sight. His Second Self by him was well belov'd; Who, tho' she for a season did survive, That she by future Trials might be prov'd, And by renewed Sorrows learn to grieve: A second Love she never entertain'd, But a chaste Widow many Years remain'd. And if Affliction and Chastizement be Undoubted Characters of Fathers Love, Whose Prudence often in Severity Doth, for Instruction to his Children, prove A greater Favour than they apprehend; She had her share, and found it in the end. Nor may her dear Affection be forgot Unto her Off-spring, whom she taught the Law Of Filial Duty; yet delighted not So much through Fear, as Love, to keep in awe: Austerity may gain a Slavish Fear, But Natural Affection more endear. She likewise (as her Consort did before) Delighted much to gratify her Friend, If any her assistance did implore, She freely would reach forth a helping-Hand; Thus studying good, she sometimes griev'd to see Relations for small Trifles disagree. Yea, she would rather bear an Injury, Than recompence it; rather reconcile Dissenting Parties, through her Lenity, Than seem t'encline to either for a while: But these her Exercises now must cease, And she rejoyce in Everlasting Peace. Alas! that those, who knew her well, might learn, By her Example, to become more mild, And not account Revenge a just Concern, Nor study to Revile, because Revil'd; Such would more inward Consolation know, Than from an angry Breast can ever grow. Well, though both He and She be gone to rest, And cannot with our Sorrows now be mov'd, Nor with the Frownings of this World oppress'd, Wherewith some may as yet be further prov'd, Their Names, engraven in our Hearts, may not Be raz'd, or cancel'd, or in time forgot. Nor shall we study high Hyperboles, So to perpetuate their Memory, Or raise a Monument of common Praise, Which cannot add to their Felicity; For they were what this insufficient Pen Cannot describe unto surviving Men. 1682. An EPISTLE. Is Friends fled, or Love grown cold? Do frozen Walls of Ice with-hold Its Pearly Streams? O let the Sun, That gave it being, shine upon The brittle Fence! Or is some Skreen Injuriously set up between The gentle Spring, and that bright Ray Which, conqu'ring Night, brings joyful Day? Remove that Obstacle away: Then, tho' with Grief I may confess, In Winter-time th' Effects be less, Because of Distance, or cold Air Prevailing in our Hemisphere, And interposing (For Sol's Pow'r Is still the same each Day and Hour) It will dissolve the Frost in time, If its warm Ray there-on may shine; Tho' vacant Clouds do interpose Its pure refulgent Beam, and those Inferiour Concrets that have Birth From the gross Element of Earth. But stay! Methinks a Spring should be From Winters chilling force, more free Than to be Frozen! Inbred Heat Is then, with purest Springs, more great; And with its Current soon doth glide Through Ice besetting either side. Let Love spring up, that we may see The same Effects, dear Friend, in thee. 1682. The Seventh Epistle to Cousin F. R. being then under some Exercises of Mind. In Loves pure Sympathy, endeared Friend, I know that secret Trials will attend, And raise some Conflicts in thy tender Breast, Such as by Pen cannot be well express'd: But all things shall (as left upon Record) Convene for good to them that fear the Lord. Some latent cause, from Carnal Eye conceal'd, May bring a Satisfaction, when reveal'd By that Refulgent Light; whose sacred Ray Leads on the Meek in Sion's pleasant Way; Whose Paths are Peace to them that persevere To follow Jesus with an holy Fear; Jesus, the Spotless Lamb, whose Pow'r surrounds His Babes, when Tribulation most abounds: Lean on his Bosom, for his Love extends Abundantly unto his Bosom-Friends; Who, tho' He in true Wisdom please to prove Our Faithfulness, our Fervency of Love, As he sees good: Yet there is never just Cause or Occasion of the least Distrust Of Loyalty in Him; who, when as we Were Strangers in a State of Enmity, Nay, in a poor, defil'd, polluted State, Objects more likely for Disgust and Hate; Did cast an Eye of Pity and of Love On Us, who had no Comeliness to move The least Affection, till his Gracious Hand Had Washed, Swadled, had Anointed and Adorned with his Robe of Righteousness, And put upon us his own Comeliness; And by his sacred Covenant, engage Our Hearts unto him in our tender Age: This, this is Love indeed! O let it never Be quenched in our Hearts, but live for ever! This, this is Love worthy to be admir'd! Ah! this is He alone to be desir'd. Therefore contend not in the Carnal Will, Tread Self-hood under foot, watch and be still; For all Additionals shall added be By Him, who knows what's best for thee and me: In Resignation let us wait to know His Will fulfill'd, and living Praises flow Unto his holy ever-blessed Name, Who only's worthy in our Hearts to reign For evermore, Eternally. Amen. Ninth Month, 1682. The Eighth Epistle to Cousin F. R. Shall Transitory Toys, vile Chaff and Dross, E'er be esteem'd and priz'd above the Cross? The Cross of Christ, the Pow'r of God, whereby The holy Men of Old did crucify The World and Self-hood; and thereby obtain A Crown of Glory, over all to reign, With Sion's King, in Everlasting Peace, Where Joys abound, but Griefs and Sorrows cease. Ah! Shall that precious Seed, that hath been sown In Ground prepar'd, so soon be overgrown With Bryars and Thorns? Or must the scorching Ray And parching Heat of Trials, cause decay In that once green (tho' tender) sprouting Plant? Hath it but little Root? Or doth it want Refreshing Show'rs, or early Dews? O see Why thus it seems to droop! Why should it be So long neglected? It may sprout again If cherished with first and latter Rain; Which Bount'ous Heav'n will not too long deny, If Disobedience and Idolatry Do not provoke thereto: That Gracious Hand, That planted it, can make a barren Land More fertile for its sake; and if he please, Can make a Fruitful Land a Wilderness. Ah! let our Breathings for each other be, That since we were from the wild Olive Tree Remov'd and separated, that we might Be grafted in the good, we may not slight The Hand that planted, nor the Root that bare us, Lest we decay; for can the Pruner spare us, That spar'd not Nat'ral Branches, if we be Unfruitful, but divide us from the Tree? But that we ever may, as we depend Upon the Root, feel Life and Sap ascend Into our Branches; that pure Praise may spring, And Fruits of Righteousness to Sion's King. A Letter to Cousin F. R. In secret Yearning for thy Preservation, Endeared Friend, I send the Salutation Of Love unfeign'd, and heartily desire Its pure Refining Flame may ne'er expire, Or be extinguish'd: For 'twas said of old, Iniquities abound, when Love grows cold. Now, though thy silent Pen doth testifie, There's some (yet latent) cause of Jealousie: I'll not my Rival envy, if it be One worthy to be entertain'd by thee, Without Detraction from that innate Worth, Whereto (I hope) thou art by second Birth Entituled. But can Affairs so crow'd, Or interpose, no Hour must be allow'd To send some welcome Evidence of Love, Which did so mutually engage and move Our Hearts and Pens so frequently t'express Their Quondam Sympathy? Well, ne'ertheless What's character'd in my poor pausing Mind, I send unto thee, as by Love inclin'd; Wishing thy Candid Aspect on the same, Or else annihilate them in a Flame. 3d of 7th Mo. 1683. A Parable to Cousin F. R. On Shiloh's fruitful Banks, in Valleys low, A pleasant Garden flourish'd, where did grow And spring, with early Dews, each curious Plant, Some rich in Beauty, some in pleasant Scent: Among the rest, a Lilly budded forth, Which flourishing a while in Native Worth; One time look'd out, t' observe and take a view Of some strange Plants, which in the High-way grew, To her a Scarlet Poppy then resorted, And with fine Accademick Phrases courted; Yea, did with florrid Subtilty invade Her Innocence, and charmingly perswade To quit that close Confinement, and become An Object more admir'd and gazed on: The Lilly seem'd to listen, till thereby She was almost seiz'd by a Lethargy; Scarcely regarding, that in unfenc'd Land She might be nip'd by some rash careless Hand, Or that she in the inclos'd Garden might Flourish, secur'd from Storm both Day and Night; And know the precious Dew of Hermon's Hill Daily upon her tender Leaves distil. A Neighbouring Plant obeserving this, dismay'd, Unto the Master of the Garden said, (In Sympathizing Bowels) Dearest Lord, Be pleas'd to send thy pure prevailing Word, To guard thy Lilly; let it not remain Without thy Fence: Ah, with thy early Rain Bedew and Quicken! Let it know, that there Is Blasting and Decay, but Safety here Within thy Walls, which are Salvation round About thy Garden, for 'tis holy Ground. 3d of 7th Mo. 1683. SOLITUDE. How sweet is harmless Solitude? What can its Joys controul? Tumults and Noise may not intrude, To interrupt the Soul That here enjoys it self, retir'd From Earth's seducing Charms; Leaving her Pomp, to be admir'd By such as Court their Harms; While she, on Contemplations Wings, Soars far beyond the Sky, And feeds her Thoughts on Heav'nly Things, Which in her Bosom lye. Great Priviledges here, of old, The wise Men did obtain; And Treasure, far surpassing Gold, They dig'd for, not in vain. The Tincture of Philosophers Here happily—they found; The Musick of the Morning-Stars Here in their Hearts did sound. Moses, that meek and prudent Prince Of Isr'el, did with Joy, By th'Burning Bush, Experience This Sacred Mystery; When in Retirement he withdrew, And led his tender Flock Beyond the Desart, he might view The Wonders of the Rock. So Heav'ns high honour'd Favourite, Did often choose to dwell Less for a Refuge, than delight Upon the Mount Carmel: For in th'Incensed Justice, he From Heaven call'd down Fire, To curb vain Man's Authority, That did by Force require The holy Prophet to submit Unto their proud Command, Or to come down, till Heav'n thought fit Thereto to condescend. There's neither Stateliness of Court, Nor any Frantick Mirth, Deluded Mortals Childish Sport, Nor Glories of the Earth, Can Counterpoise that inward Peace, Which in her Bosom dwells; Joys here abounding, Sorrows cease; Delight all Grief expels. Here may the Soul, secur'd from Noise, In Calmness meditate; And waiting, hear the still small Voice, Which makes the Mountains shake. But Consolates the Soul and Mind, As with a sweet Repose, Which here, as from its Dross refin'd, Participates of those Diviner Joys, whereto by Birth She hath a Sacred right; Which far transcends all Joys on Earth, In spotless true Delight. But those that covet to enjoy The Sweets of Solitude, Must bid Adieu to Vanity; Not let the World intrude, Like an alluring Dalilah, into their Privacy; For her design is to betray By subtil Flattery: Which, who by Watchfulness doth learn Discreetly to—repel, Such, to their Solace, shall discern Where perfect Peace doth dwell: And in Retirement, always find Such Innocent Delight, As fully Satiates the Mind, And plenteously requite Denial of all Earthly Things, Which ne'er can satisfie The Noble Soul, whose Solace springs From Immortality. The Glorious Joys of Seraphims; For which each daily sings High Praises, and Melodious Hymns, Unto the King of Kings. 1683. A Meditation. Can I forget that hand, that first did lay My mean Foundation out of Dust or Cay? Can I forget the Breath, that did inspire My Lifeless Mass with pure Eternal Fire? Can I forget the Word, that first said, Live; And with its Vertue, Life did to me give? Can I forget that Eye, that guideth me With Heav'nly Brightness through Obscurity? Can I forget that holy Arm of Power, That guards and keeps me safe, as in a Tower? Can I forget that sweet Celestial Bread, By which, when hungry, I am nourished? Or can my Soul ever unmindful be Of those Refreshing Streams that flow from thee? Thou great Eternal Fountain of all Good! Whose Name by Mortals is not understood; Nor can, by Letters, Words, or Sentences, Be rightly Comprehended as it is: For thou art All in All; and who can say, He can remember thee another Day? Except thy Holy Spirit still abide, And lodge with us, to teach, direct, and guide Our Hearts &amp; Thoughts, and quicken good Desires, Whereby we long for thee, when thou retires To thy Pavilion, to thy Secret Place; So that we rest not, till we see thy Face: For thou alone prepares true Rest for thine; Tho' furious Men against the Saints combine, Their Habitation they can ne'er destroy, By all their hostile Arts and Policy: For it is founded on the Rock that shall Abide; and, tho' Waves beat, shall never fall, As Faithful they remain to thee, that art Author of Faith, that Shield from ev'ry Dart. Ah, why should any doubt? Thy Arm's the same As ever; all-sufficient to restrain The Wrath of Man, tho' (as a flowing Tide) It seems Resistless: If thou please to guide Our feeble foot-steps-in thy Path, we shall Not be dismay'd, but follow thee through all That would oppose: Thou art our chiefest Guard; Yea, thou art our exceeding great Reward. Ah, take up thy abode with us! For we Can find no Resting Place, except in thee. 1684. Meditations on Persecution. Gold-hungry Seamen, tho' they oft endure Day-dark'ning Storms &amp; Tempests, to procure The winged Treasures of this fading World; Altho' they run the hazard to be hurl'd On wrecking Rocks, or quick-devouring Sands, Or cast as Captives on some foreign Lands, To spend their wretched Days in Misery, Instead of what they sought for to enjoy, Abounding Wealth, if to their wished Shoar They safe arrive; venture again, yet more Undaunted than at first, in hopes to be With more success, kept from those Dangers free. Then why should such Faint-heartedness appear In Isr'el's Camp, that ought of right to fear None but the Lord! Can any doubt, that have The Word of an Almighty King, to save Them to the uttermost? What! Tho' he seem To tarry long, his own Appointed Time Is always best; in greatest Straights, we do Wholly depend on, and acknowledge too, Salvation only from above; for then We find, 'tis vain to hope for help from Men. Ah! was not Isr'el thus beset? Could they Encounter furious Pharaoh's Host, or th'Sea? Yet was Deliverance near; the Sea must be A Path to them, a Grave to th'Enemy: Pharaoh might follow, to his own Destruction; Whilst Israel is prov'd, to gain Instruction: That these may learn whom they should chiefly fear, And whom to trust, when Tribulation's near. Ah, then in this our Gospel-Dispensation, Why should the Children of this Generation Seem so far Wiser, or more Valiant, than The sacred Off-spring of Jerusalem? Those hazard Life for Transitory Toys; And shall not these, for Everlasting Joys, Resign up Visibles, yea, Life and all, To Him that gave it, if he please to call To such a Trial? Can we baulk the Way Wherein he leads, except we run astray? We must through Exercises overcome, And bear the Cross, (if we would wear the Crown) And fully follow him: The Recompence Will far exceed, when we are parted hence. But who art thou, that art so loath to give Up an Estate? A Thief may soon deprive Thee of a greater Share, than he requires; Some suffer more by Carelesness and Fires; Which justly Heav'n permits, to let them see How vain these poor, these trifling Treasures be. Or dost thou fear Confinement? Heav'n may send Grievous Diseases, which Physitians Hand Cannot remove, and to th'uneasie Bed Make thee a Pris'ner, when thy Health is fled. But if thou be confin'd for Jesus sake, He will a Prison much more pleasant make, Than any Spacious Palace: For He'll be Fulness of Joy, and Saving Health to thee. Now, tho' some shun the Cross, as Worldly Wise, And from the Path of Truth apostatize, And yet the Judgments do not soon ensue, (Altho' they be in dreadful Vengeance due) So that the Wicked did of old aver, Surely the Lord his Coming doth defer: Yet shall they not have Peace, but feel the Rod Of a Displeased, of a Jealous GOD; Whose Word can never fail, altho' he try Some with Long-suffering, and great Clemency. Ah, Kiss the Son, lest that his Anger be Incens'd! For He alone can comfort thee: And let not any faint, or start aside, Heav'n will support his Faithful Ones when try'd. 1684. On DANIEL. When Babel's Grandees, by unjust Decree, With Royal Signet, surreptitiously Obtain'd, had seal'd an Edict, That none should Exhibit a Request, or be so bold To make Petition, save unto their King, In Thirty Days; in hopes thereby to bring T'inevitable Ruine, and destroy The Prophet Daniel, whose Sincerity Was well approved: Can we find, that he Was e'er so startled at the rash Decree, As to omit what formerly he knew Was an Incumbent Duty, or to shew His Zeal for Isr'els God? But every Day, Did he not, with his Window open, pray As formerly, and boldly supplicate For Isr'els Seed, in their afflicted State? Now some may say, What Daniel, couldst not thou In Heart, and in thy private Closet bow, And make Petition in his Ear, that hears Deep Sighs and Groans, as well as louder Prayers; But indiscreetly thus thy self expose A sought-for Prey unto thy watchful Foes? No, no; he stood not to consult his own Security, as knowing GOD alone, Whom he ador'd, was able to restrain The Wrath of Man, and in his Sacred Name, Support his Faithful Ones, tho' Trials should Be heaped on them, even Sevenfold; Or else would give the sweet Experience, Of a desirable Deliverance. Thus noble Daniel, when Spies attended, He, as a Criminal, was apprehended And cast, by Sentence of malicious Men, Unto the (now more gentle) Lions Den; Whither, approaching in the Royal Robe Of Spotless Innocence, th'Eternal God, That holds the Lives of Creatures in his Hand, Muzzled the Lions Mouths, with a Command Of Abstinence; and whisper'd in their Ear Such Dread, that they durst not approach to tear The Angel-Guarded Prey; but still must wait, Tho' Hunger-bit, for other courser Meat. But Babel's King could not be unconcern'd For upright Daniel: Ah, his Bowels yearn'd For this his Faithful Subject! So that he Could take no rest, but early rose to see What was become of him; or if the Power Of Isr'els God, whom Daniel did adore, Was able to preserve him from the Paws Of those Devourers, and their Rav'nous Jaws: Whereof, when Babel's King was satisfy'd By Daniel's Answer, who there testify'd His Loyalty to Heav'n, his Innocence Towards the King, he's soon removed thence; Whilst his Accusers must become a Feast For them that durst not touch the Sacred Guest: Th' Eternal Arm's the same, his Love's the same, To those that trust sincerely in his Name. But those that doubt when he is pleas'd to prove, And saw such signal Tokens of his Love, Are now but rarely seen, our Foe prevails Too much against us, whilst our Courage fails; We by distrust and doubting oft, I fear, Prevent those Wonders, which might else appear. Alas! 'tis Faith that conquers; he believ'd, And doubted not, and therefore was reliev'd: For he resisted even unto Blood, Therefore the Lord brought all about for good. Shall Man prescribe a Way for him, whereby His Glorious Name, he best, may magnify? A prudent General does not permit Such to appear in th' Front, he knows unfit To bear the first Assault of th' Enemy, But Valiant Hearts, that cannot yield nor fly: Can then the Everlasting Counsellor, The King of Kings, be more unskill'd in War? No, no; for He, the only wise Commander, Tho' of his meanest Soldier truly tender, Yet honours them in higher place, that be Free to encounter Dangers cheerfully. And tho' proud Gog and Magog Arm for Fight, Destruction from his Sword shall stop their Flight: They shall not 'scape from his all-seeing Eye; His Wrath shall overtake them suddenly: He, and his Saints must have the Victory. Then why should any Weak and Faint appear? Tho' Great Goliah glory in his Spear, And monstrous Stature, Little David shall, Without Saul's Armour, make the Giant fall; And bring Deliverance to Israel's Host, Tho' the Philistines long against them boast: And tho' worm Jacob's Seed be often prov'd With Tribulations, he is still belov'd, And for his sake great Kings shall be reprov'd. The Lord of Lords will get himself a Name, He'll overturn, and overturn again, Until he come, whose right it is, to reign. 1685. Amen. Meditations concerning our Imprisonment Only for Conscience sake, 1684. in Lancaster Castle. Tho' the Eternal Wisdom, Sion's King, Be pleas'd to try his Babes, by Suffering; Tho' some departing from the Sinner's way, And walking Sion-ward, become a Prey; Yea, tho' through Tribulations Israel must Enter the Promis'd Land, yet Heav'n is just, And tenderly supports his patient Ones, Altho' he Chasten his Beloved Sons; And tho' in Prisons outwardly they be Confin'd, the Son of Love doth set them free, And leads in verdant Plains of Liberty: The fresh fat Valleys, where sweet Shiloh flows, Upon whose fertile Banks the Lilly grows; Where, tho' he by some Exercises prove, He sollaceth with Flaggons of his Love. Then why should any Murmur? Jesus thus Extended Signal Favours unto us. Here are we with the hidden Manna fed, Tho' with Transgressors we be numbered: Here can we Prospects from our Tower survey, With much more Innocent Delight, than they That range at large; yea, here we may descry The pleasant Path, hid from the Vult'rous Eye: Wherein the Righteous follow Christ, their King And tender Shepherd, to the living Spring Of Joy; and to his Name, High Praises sing. Nor can the proudest Walls (tho' ne'er so High, The Monuments of Grave Antiquity) Be terrible to Spotless Innocence, That knows the Rock of Ages a Defence. Tho' some be from their Families remov'd; Here Mary's choice may better be improv'd: And Christ takes care for his, altho' they sit As unconcern'd, weeping at Jesus Feet: He'll be a Father to the Family Of such as, for his Name, in Prison lye; And fill their Hearts with Everlasting Joy. These rugged Walls, less grievous are to me, Than those bedeck'd with curious Arras be T'a guilty Conscience; to a wounded Heart, A Palace cannot palliate that smart: Tho' drunk with Pleasure, dull with Opiates, Some seem as Senseless of their sad Estates, Till on their Dying-Beds Conscience awakes. But tho' the Righteous be in Bonds confin'd, They inwardly sweet Satisfaction find. Neither can stately Roofs, Gates, Bars, nor all The Art of Man, suppress the Cries and Call, Or Supplication, or the poorest Sigh, Of Isr'els Seed; for his Redeemer's nigh; Who will regard the Cries, and hear the Groans, Of his Afflicted, Tribulated Ones; And will, in his appointed Time, arise, Utterly to confound his Enemies: Altho' by them he for a Season prove His Children dear; he'll yet in time remove The Scourge, and cast the Chast'ning Rod aside, When Isr'els Faith and Patience he hath try'd. Now, tho' some rage, because we cannot Bow Unto their vain Traditions, since we know The Blessed Truth, which hath engag'd to give Our Hearts to Him, in whom alone we live: Yea, tho' for this, some fret, and storm, and rage, And study to afflict God's Heritage; Their Wrath's restrain'd by One, that if he please, Can curb the Furious, Rowling, Raging Seas, As in a Moment; and upon the Wave, Teach his to walk, and by his Presence save From sinking, as of old: His Arm's the same, Eternal Praises to his holy Name. He is our Shield, our Sun, that penetrates Our closest Rooms, and sweetly consolates Our waiting Souls; and with his Quick'ning Ray, Changes black Nights of Sorrow, into (joyful) Day: So that 'tis not the Terrors of the Night, Nor Darts that fly by Day, that can afright The Righteous Souls, who walk in holy Fear; They know their Captain of Salvation's near, The Blessed Prince of Peace, their Joy, their King, The only Fountain, whence true saving Comforts spring. Sixth Month, 1684. Another Letter to Cousin F. R. As Winters tedious Nights to weary Eyes, As nipping Cold to chirping winged Flocks, Until the welcome Day-Star do arise, And lights the Trees to shake their dewy Locks: Or as a Door close lock'd, to limit thee, Ev'n thee, to whom I send these hasty Lines, Such was thy tedious Silence unto me, Till now of late a better Aspect shines. For from thy Bounteous Hand I have receiv'd, What I esteem more than the Miser's Gold; If I for lieu of it should be bereav'd Of the dear Int'rest which in thee I hold; Surpassing that of Consanguinity, Which scarce obliges, but in Complements; But Cordial Friendship's lasting Unity, Hearts by endearing Vertue so Cements, That distance, tho' remote, can't separate; Tho' interposing Business prevail, To hinder mutual Converse, and create Those Exercises which sometimes assail: That Adage, clouded to the World in mists, Is in thy Conversation verify'd; Honour with True Nobility consists, And nothing more Ridiculous than Pride. Pride in Deportment, and in Gaudy Dress, Indulg'd by some t'obtain a Monarchy, Is shunn'd by thee; thy Empire ne'ertheless Extendeth further, than desir'd by thee. Thou to the World in plainness bravely shews, Thou covet'st not the Troubles of her Noise; Yet unawares obligingly subdues, Far more than they that court her Vanities. Prides gaudy Captives strive to dazle Eyes, But thy sweet Gravity affects the Heart, Yet such sometimes gain Conquest by surprize; But whom thou overcomes, own due desert. Yet were thy Vertue and thine Honour less, If such Ambition found a place in thee, As frequently attends the gaudy Dress, T'insult o'er those ta'en in Captivity. But tho' thou can'st not totally redress Such Expectation, as some seem to have, Yet by a prudent Mein and Gentleness, Would loose the Fetters, that so far enslave; And innocently ever dost extend Such candid Favours, as may best agree To those whom thou vouchsafes to own thy Friend, And yet kept from reflecting Censure free. But thy great Zeal for true Religion shines In Life and Conversation, ev'n as far Above what others talk these cloudy times, As the Day-Ruler doth a twinkling Star. For in thy Blooming Years, thy tender Mind Was influenced with such warm desires Of Holiness; and so to Good inclin'd, As Love, and Power Divine, alone inspires. Nor didst thou take Religion upon trust, But wisely sought to know its Basis; and, Noble Berean-like, so wise and just, To search the Records of Divine Command: Which, having prov'd, thou heard'st, &amp; then obey'd; And with a right composed Heart and Mind, Bow'd to the Truth; so Truth its Scepter sway'd, And thou therein dost Peace and Solace find. And tho' at first the frowning World assay'd, By Scornings and Revilings, t'have deterr'd From Goodness, thy great Soul was not dismay'd, But this, before her Vanities, preferr'd: So things that once seem'd difficult, became More easie; and the Glorious Shining Light, That first but glimmer'd in the dark, the same Broke out more bright, &amp; overspread the Night. Thus what seem'd once impossible, appear'd To thy great Satisfaction; and thine Heart (Thy Understanding being fully clear'd) Enjoy'd the Choice of Mary's better part, Which from the Righteous may not be remov'd; They know Salvation near, Truth is their Choice; And tho' such be with Exercises prov'd, They have the Earnest of Eternal Joys. 1690. On FRIENDSHIP. Amongst the many Records I have read, And Transcripts, thro' the world much scattered, I've met with several Hints and Whisperings, Of an abstruse Grand-Property, that springs From some interiour, hidden, innate Cause, In Noble Breasts, uncircumscrib'd by Laws, Styl'd Friendship, which of such a Nature is, That many think they know it when they miss. But 'tis suppos'd of such sweet Innocence, Of so Divine and Sacred Influence, When it doth in true tender Hearts prevail, That when occurrent Troubles would assail, It guards, as doth a Bulwark, either Breast, Where it resides, and taketh up its rest. But O! this treacherous World knows little of it, Except it be in Name, whereby to scoff it. For now, tho' some affected with the Name, Would be suppos'd touch'd with its Noble Flame, They scorn its Dictates, and will not regard A troubled Friend, except some fair Reward Appear in view; their Business or their Pride Engrosses all; Self may not be deny'd. O when will Mortals raise their Eyes to see, That all things here are only Vanity! 1691. On the Three Holy Children. When Conqu'ring Babel's Foes were subjugate, And fair Jerusalem depopulate, King Nebuchadnezzar Triumph'd in Pride, And his Concerns of War seem'd laid aside; Who Glorying in his Strength, not in the Lord, Formed a Golden God to be ador'd. Now this great Image, made by Mortal Hand, Must worship'd be (such was the King's Command) Tho' senseless, helpless, tho' he ne'er could bless Their War-like Enterprizes with success: But 'tis the King's Decree, and then who dare Resist, but such as do a Greater fear? The Sentence is, The Fiery Furnace must Consume the Rebels Body unto Dust. Yet there were Captive Jews of Royal Blood, Who, in their Zeal for Israels God, withstood That cursed Edict, that vain Law reject, That strict Decree with them had small Effect: Then the Informers, that observ'd the Jews, And sought for an occasion to accuse The Innocent, (as some do now) drew near; And first, to gain acceptance in his Ear, Said, Live, O King, for ever! Thou hast made A firm Decree, which some have not obey'd; Even Three conceited Jews, who neither Thee Regard, nor to thy Gods do bow their Knee. O how his Fury doth at this arise! That any should his Golden God despise: His Visage doth its native Features change; His Eyes, with sparkling Rage, proclaim Revenge: Therefore, at his Command, they all in haste The Persons of the Innocent arrest; Call'd Shedrach, Meshach, and Abednego, And they before the wrathful King must go To prove the Matter; and, it seems, to try If they would Bow: Which, when they still deny, As knowing, He alone that did create The Fire, and all things else, could soon abate Its Violence; and from the threatning Hand Of Babel's King, deliver them that stand In Awe to none but him, and fear not Man; But dread the Living God, who only can Kill and Destroy, or save and keep Alive; For He to Man doth Life and Being give. This they believing, did not study how To answer; but resolved not to Bow To any, but the Lord: Altho' the King Seem'd, in his Wrath, to count it as a thing Impossible, that any God could be So Potent, to withstand his fierce Decree. But Great JEHOVAH did that Law confound; For when all Three were in their Vestments bound, And cast into the furious Fiery Flame, Th'Eternal Word did Pow'rfully restrain Its proper Quality, and so surround Them with Defence, no harm on them was found: Yet did the Fire retain its former Vigor, And manifest it with resistless Rigor, Against those Men, who bold to execute The King's Command, the Just did persecute: Which, when Nebuchadnezzar saw, dismay'd, He rose in haste, and to his Nobles said, Were not Three Men cast bound into the Flame? They answer'd, True: The King reply'd again, Now, in the midst thereof, behold, I see Four Men walk loose, and from their Fetters free; Whereof the Fourth seems cloath'd in Majesty, As Son of the Immortal Deity. Thus was the Lofty forced to confess, There was a Pow'r above him, and to bless The God of Isr'el; set his Servants free, That, trusting in him, would not bow the Knee Unto, or serve another, than the Lord, Their only God; but, as with one accord, Did yield their Bodies to his Will, that they Might magnify him in their Trial-Day. Consider now, had they not Faithful been, The Captive Seed of Isr'el had not seen That great Deliverance, so signally Wrought for them, that, in true Simplicity, Resign'd themselves, their all, unto the Lord, Who is alone worthy to be ador'd: Nor Babel's Monarch been constrain'd to bless His holy Name, who Reigns in Righteousness; Deposing Kingdoms unto whom he sees Most fit, and Changing Man's perverse Decrees. Lord, may thy Wisdom, in these latter Days, Limit, or turn Man's Wrath unto thy Praise! Put thou an Hook into the Jaws of those, That study Politickly to oppose Thy Works of Love and Wonder, in the Land, And with their Subtilty seek to withstand The Progress of despised Israel, In their Return towards thy Holy Hill, Sion, the sacred Mount of thy Renown, Which Babylon hath sought to Batter down, But never shall prevail; altho' she seem To sit in Pomp, like to a Stately Queen, That sees no Sorrow; all her Pride is vain; For fall she must, and never rise again; The Time's appointed: Then shall Sion rise, And Triumph over all her Enemies. The Conclusion of a Letter to Cousin F.R. Ne'er let the Prospect of a great Estate Dazle those Eyes, which I presum'd of late, Could from on High, with brave disdain, look down On this Worlds fading Glory; since a Crown Of Life is promis'd for a Recompence Of hearty, true, sincere Obedience, Unto the Faithful Soul, whose strong Desires Are centred in that Joy that ne'er expires. Ah, let Enough suffice! Could Poverty Be Advocate, 'twould plead Excuse for thee: But if we grasp at Riches that are vain, Then how is our Religion strong and plain? A MEDITATION. Lord, teach me patiently to follow thee, Thro' thy sore Travels, thro' thine Agony, Which thou so meekly didst endure for me, 'Mongst such unworthy Worms as wounded thee, Piercing thee fresh with our Iniquity: Teach us to Suffer, till we Reign with thee. Amen. To her Friend M. J. Let us, my Friend, all peevish Self withstand, And in the Meekness of the Spotless Lamb, Lead one another gently by the Hand, And travel forward to the holy Land, Where the Redeemed on Mount Sion stand, With Harps of Living Praises in their Hand. A MEDITATION. Eternal Love, before whose Glorious Face All Times art present, filling ev'ry place; Uncircumscribed, Unexcluded! Can Thy Boundless Mercy to forgetful Man Be told? Or can thy long Forbearance be Enough admir'd? Great Dreadful Majesty! Ah, let my Soul, in a true living Sense Now ruminate on the sweet Influence Of that abounding Goodness, which from thee Did freely reach to such a Worm as Me! The Beast, that cleaves the Hoof, &amp; chews the Cud, Was by the Ancient Law proclaimed Good: And as thou'rt pleas'd t'enjoyn thine Israel, In humble due acknowledgment, to tell Thy Mighty Wonders, each one to his Friend, Whereby thou brought'st 'em to the promis'd Land; So 'mongst the many Favours, Lord, of thine, May I now call to Mind that doleful Time; Wherein, as pondering of my State, I found (Tho' Life and Vertue doth with thee abound) My self as one of those dry senseless Bones, Which lay in th'open Valley, which thou once Did'st shew thy Prophet, all exceeding dry, Until thou pleas'd to cast a tender Eye Of Pity on them, and the Answer give Unto that great Demand, Can dry Bones live? By Breathing on them, when thy Gracious Hand Had gather'd them, and by thy bless'd Command, Cloath'd them with Flesh: Great King! thy Pow'r's the same It was of old, and cannot move in vain. Thus, tho' at first my miserable State Seem'd unto me doleful and desperate, How soon thou, in the Bone, didst broach a Spring, Which to my Soul did sweet Refreshment bring. Friendship Tried. Tho' it surpasseth Winters Skill, T'impede the flowing Tide, Which from the Spring in Hermon's Hill Each Moment is supply'd: Tho' Icy Walls cannot immure Its Christal Streams, that run secure; Nor yet the scorching Fiery Beams of Summers Heat exhale, Or to drink up those purling Streams, With all its Drought prevail; Which, ever flowing freely, bring Their Treasures from a Living Spring. Yet have I seen a pretty Well, Deriv'd from Show'rs of Rain, Which into Nature's Cistern fell, And did some time remain; By Summers Drought, exhal'd away, And vanish in a Scorching Day. So little Brooks and Torrents flow, While they have fresh supply From the distilling Clouds, but grow (When most they're wanted) dry, Like Cherith's Brook, whose pleasant Stream Ceas'd, when the Drought was most extream: So common Kindnesses may flow In some Sinister Hearts, And petty Favours seem to grow, Whilst sometimes they impart Renewed Bribes, in hopes t' obtain The Stock, with Int'rest, back again. But then, if any Fret arise, Or Disappointment come, How soon Upbraiding testifies, True Friendship found not room Within those narrow bounded Breasts, The Lodging of Self-Interest, True Friendship, that from Vertue springs, Doth so enlarge the Mind, It cannot be block'd up with things Of such a servile kind, As makes dull Misers fret and rage In this our Mercenary Age. 'Tis not the nipping stormy Winds Of sharp Adversity, Nor Winters Frost, can chill the Minds, Or stop the Sympathy, Which with unfeigned Love doth flow, Where Friendship doth sincerely grow. A MEDITATION. How long will Man forget himself, And be so much inclin'd To Treasure up that sordid Pelf, Which he must leave behind? And seek these Vanities on Earth, Which quickly come to nought; A little Jollity and Mirth Is often dearly bought: Fools for the Belly sell away Their Birth-right to the Wise; What's this Inheritance? Cry they: Thus they for Trash despise That Treasure, which no Thief can steal, No Canker-worm nor Rust Can e'er corrupt: And 'tis by Seal Confirmed to the Just; Who, tho' they here may suffer Loss, It shall become their Gain, If patiently they bear the Cross, They shall the Crown obtain. But those that choose their Portion here, Shall wail in Misery, Because such would not lend an Ear To th'Voice of Wisdom's Cry; Who call'd, to lead them in the way, Where no Destroyer's found, Nor any hurtful Beast of Prey Can tread this holy Ground: The Vult'rous Eye here cannot spy; But yet the humble Mind, That seeks in true Simplicity, This pleasant Path may find; And, though Unlearned, cannot err, Led by a sacred Guide, Unto a Habitation, where True Comforts are enjoy'd. Then why should Men unmindful be Of their more Noble Part, The Off-spring of Eternity, As wholly to invert The sole use of their Intellects, To gain a fading Toy, This Faithless World; while they reject True Everlasting Joy? They snatch at Shadows here, and slight The Substance that remains For ever: Thus they, in the Night, Walk on to endless Pains; If they persist to wander there, And carelesly contemn The springing Light, that doth appear Thence to deliver them: Then why, alas, should they destroy Their Hopes of lasting Treasures, And rest contented, sordidly To share with Beasts in Pleasures? Since Wisdom hath prepar'd a Feast, Her Table's furnished, That Fools may now become her Guests, And feed on Heav'nly Bread. Indeed the Wise in their own Eyes, Are fill'd with vain Conceit; Such will the Honey-comb despise, Yet shall the Hungry eat, Till satisfy'd, and with delight Walk on in Wisdom's Way; Knowing the Light expels the Night, And brings in perfect Day; Whereby they see things as they be, And so are taught to choose Eternal Life in Purity, But Sin and Death refuse. There's no abiding City here; Seek one that shall remain: To Wisdom's Counsel lend an Ear; True Godliness is gain: Where the Contented Mind is known, There is a sweet Increase Of Solace, where the Soul lies down In Everlasting Peace; True Peace and Joy, not to be found In vain Terrestrial Things: Pure holy Praises then abound Unto the King of Kings; Who from on High, with tender Eye, Look'd down, and pleas'd to send Wisdom to Call, whose Voice and Cry Doth unto all extend. Of a Happy Life. Shall we exclude from a Sedate, Sweet, Happy, and Contented State? The honest Man, that lives in Health, Enjoying still sufficient Wealth, Though not from an Inheritance, But sure supply from Providence, Estate by Industry can find, But treasures Goodness in his Mind; Though boasting no Nobility, Nor Honours, from a Pedigree; But rather can, with Tully, Ego meis Majoribus Virtute præluxi.tell, He doth his Ancestors excel; Yet is not over-clogg'd with Care; Can Time for Mind and Body spare; Can Feed and Sleep in Season, free From Superfluous Luxury; That hath an equal Loyal Spouse, An handsome Habitable House; Inherited, or Purchas'd, that He need not fear the sullen Threat Of griping Landlord; but if not, Finds true Content in any Lot; Since in the Closet of his Mind Dwells Solace not to be defin'd, Hath a just Friend, that canot be Transformed in Adversity; And what's more Happy, yet more Strange! He's always ready for a Change. On David and Jonathan. Are learned Pens solicitous t'Express Idle Chimera's in Romantick Dress? And shall the Fame of these Heroick Friends, Be thought a Theme unworthy of such Pens? Where a more Princely Pattern can we find Of Loyal Friendship, and a Nobler Mind, Than shines in Jonathan, Saul's famous Son? Whose Heart to David, since the Conquest won From great Goliah, was so firmly knit, That no Self-Int'rest could e'er alter it: Such Potent Love sprang in his Royal Breast, That he Disrob'd himself, to Cloath his Guest; And gave his Garments, Girdle, Sword, and Bow, Whether he did, by sacred Instinct, know He should his Father in the Throne succeed: (Can Man divert what Heaven hath decreed?) And though the Kishite politickly told, While Jesse's Son surviv'd, He never should Establish his Dominion, or Advance His Royal Scepter: Yet since Providence Had so dispos'd it, He, with Pious Mind, Serene from Envy, had in Heart resign'd His Kingly Pow'r to David: For had he Been false in Heart, some trick of Treachery Had broken forth, his Honour to obscure; Yet David other ways been kept secure. But O his brave Heroick Soul disdain'd Ignoble Projects; yea, a Crown so stain'd With Breach of Friendship! Ah, how did he plead With furious Saul, and nobly intercede For absent David, till he did provoke To (had it hit) a sad and fatal Stroke Against himself? then meekly he withdrew, And at th'appointed season went to shew This unto him, whose Life seem'd to depend On the Fidelity of such a Friend; Who (pre-advis'd) did privately attend The Prince's coming; where, with mutual grief, Leave to depart, was then the sole Relief Time did afford; with Tears, and great increase Of Sorrow, David is dismiss'd in Peace. But David, truly worthy such a Friend, Rememb'red this, when Heav'n had put an End To Rivalty of Rule, and call'd away The noble Prince; lest here his longer stay Might seem t'Eclipse his great Renowned Name, Had he surviv'd to see another Reign: David yet Grateful (when with watry Eyes, He had bewail'd his dear Friend's Exequies, And griev'd that he was by Philistines slain, 'Gainst whom his Sword was never drawn in vain, Until that dismal Day, that Heav'ns Decree On wretched Saul must executed be) Sought out occasion how to manifest The Effects of Friendship in his Kingly Breast; And to the Off-spring, gently did extend The Favours due to his deceased Friend; Mephibosheth, though Saul's Posterity, (Saul's, that was of such noted Enmity To David) being Son to Jonathan, Must dwell at Court, the King will entertain Him at his Royal Table, gives Command For the Surrender of Saul's State and Land. Was David Valiant? Did he, void of fear, Assail and slay a Lion and a Bear, And with undaunted Courage overcome The Warlike Gathite with a little Stone? But, which preferr'd him more than all the rest, An Upright Heart he bore within his Breast. Was not his Friendly Rival Jonathan Renown'd for Valour too? The only Man, That, with his Armour-Bearer, overthrew The proud Philistines, ere his Father knew With whom he left the Host of Israel, Whilst the proud Garrison before him fell, With Dread and Trembling; Israel, mean while Amaz'd, made haste but to pursue and spoil: Yet did he not out-brave his Loyal Friend, But by Majestick Meekness recommend That true Nobility of Mind, that brings A greater Honour than the Name of Kings. For tho' his Sword many Philistines slew, And Israel's Foes he bravely did subdue; Yet did that Love and Friendship in his Breast, Embalm his honour'd Name above the rest Of his Renowned Vertues, and engage Immortal Fame in each succeeding Age. On Modesty and Chastity. O how is this Luxurious World beguil'd! That Spotless Modesty seems quite exil'd; And Chastity cashier'd, or banish'd hence, Lest her prevailing pow'rful Influence Should tincture Humane Hearts with holy Awe, And deeply there engrave the Royal Law; Which few regard, though of a vast Extent, Although its Precepts teacheth to prevent The sad Effects, Grief, Shame, and Obloquy, That still attend them that slight Modesty. For Chastity, sits as with awful Grace, Enthron'd i'th' Heart, and sweetly in the Face Holds forth its Ensign, Modesty, as 'twere A Flag of Peace, which, when it doth appear, It bids Defiance to th'Voluptuous Mind, Although to Hospitality inclin'd; And doth with Friendly Treatments entertain Those that converse therewith, without a Stain, Or base Extravagance of wanton Look, Wherewith deluding Syrens bait their Hook, To catch unstable Hearts with seeming Joy, Though the design is chiefly to destroy. No, here's a pure, tho' far more potent Charm, That, as a Castle, daunts approaching Harm With simple Innocence, whose chiefest Care Is to prevent, rather than plant a Snare. Then why Should either Sex claim Liberty, Beyond the Confines of sweet Modesty? It seasons Words, and fairly regulates Deportment, both to High and Low Estates; It crowns the Man with Comeliness: But she That wants it, deserves Shame and Infamy. RETIREMENT. O whither is my Love withdrawn! and where Shall I direct my Steps to find him near, And fear no prying Eyes, nor list'ning Ear? Ah! Whither shall I now repair to find A Solitary Place to ease my Mind, To him that can my Foes in Fetters bind? Ah, Lord! with-hold not those Resplendent Beams, Nor stop the Current of those Christal Streams, Which would both heal my Wounds, and cleanse my Stains. Spring! Spring! O Fountain of Felicity! And let sweet Shiloh's Stream flow forth, that I May drink, and be refresh'd; or else I die. Appear, thou great High Priest of Israel! Who in that vast Eternity doth dwell, Whose perfect Beauty, Tongue can never tell. O can my Soul but much affected be With those Enam'ring Rays that dart from thee, Great Spring of Light! O teach me fervently To wait for thee! whose Love is still inclin'd To favour Isr'els Seed, whose Heart and Mind Is unto thee unfeignedly resign'd. Tho' Mortals cannot see thy Face, and Live; Yet to thy Royal Seed thou'rt pleas'd to give This Princely Favour, this Prerogative. Lord, cast thine Eye upon a Worm, whose State Is even like a Widow desolate! Remove, consume, all that would separate, Or interpose betwixt my Love and me: O rend the Vail throughout, that I may see My Soul's chief Darling! Ah, Thou, Thou art He, That stands behind the Wall, and there dost wait To shew thy self, when thine do supplicate To see thee near; then dost thou satiate The Pure in Heart: Altho' thou please to try Their Zeal, their Fervour, their Sincerity To thee; whose Presence, Lord, is always nigh. On Solomon's Requests. Great Solomon, t'whom Heav'n was pleas'd to give A Token of his Favour, when requir'd To ask and have; 'twas not that he might live To num'rous Years, or Riches he desir'd, Nor yet the Fame of outward Victory, But that his Heart true Wisdom might enjoy. Who, when he had this great Request obtain'd, Esteeming it above the finest Gold, Other more mean Enjoyments also gain'd; He learn'd by this, Enigma's to unfold; And saw by this, all things below the Sun, Were Vanity, and must to Period come: And while to this he rightly was inclin'd, His steps were guided in the Path of Peace; His Understanding Heart and Princely Mind In Wisdom's Secrets daily found Increase: He then Experimentally could tell, Her Price all glistring Rubies did excel. For this alone gives true Nobility, Rightly instructing Princes how to Reign, As with a Righteous Scepter: 'Tis hereby The Magistrate bears not the Sword in vain, To punish or protect; but knows t'extend Mercy and Justice with impartial Hand: Therefore a Terror only unto them, Whose Acts and Deeds are Evil; but a Praise To Wisdom's Children. Thus the Diadem Of Princely Solomon gave forth such Rays, As dazled the Beholders: Majesty Shin'd in his Wisdom to each wond'ring Eye; Much more than in the Plenty of his Gold, Or Sparkling Gems, common to other Kings; 'Twas none of these, when niggard Fame had told His Name in Sheba's Court, that from thence brings That famous Queen, whose Heart was set on fire To prove the Truth, his Wisdom to admire. Where secret Wisdom dwells, at her right Hand are length of Days, and Peace, wherewith to bless Those that attend on her, and always stand As at her Door, the Gate of Righteousness: With Wealth &amp; Honours her right Hand requites Those whom she's pleas'd to own her Favourites. But Words, alas, cannot enough set forth Its Excellence, nor Tongue of Man declare True Wisdom's Price, according to its Worth: She dwells i'th' humble Heart, that's fill'd with fear Of the Almighty; and all those that have her, Find Substance that remains, yea, endless Treasure. A Meditation. O who would think, all outward Foes might be Suppress'd and Conquer'd, much more easily Than that insulting Tyrant in the the Heart, Which there usurps, and acts the Traytor's part! For though a Man externally Reform His Actions, so that strictly he perform The Precepts of the Law; 'tis all in vain, If he th' accursed Achan entertain In his polluted Breast: This will expose Him to the Fury of all outward Foes; Whom otherwise he might with ease repel, Did not this Traytor in the Bosom dwell. We'll therefore wait, to feel the searching Power, By its Enlightning Influence, discover This cursed Achan, that the Camp may be Entirely Sanctified, to follow thee, Isr'els Victorious King, who truly dost Watch with a tender care o'er Isr'els Host: For 'tis a Task, surpassing Humane Skill, Rightly to govern and direct the Will. Let therefore Heart and Will be still resign'd To thee, with a free, fervent, humble Mind. Contemplation. Great Prince of Peace! When I incline To wait on thee, Thou say'st in secret, Thou art mine; Thou'st purchas'd me; Not with Corruptible or Fading Things, But with a Price that far exceeds the Crowns of Kings. Ah, Lord! Who can enough admire Thy Boundless Love, Which doth so far surpass desire, Yea, often prove Beyond what might expected be by me, Unworthy of the smallest smiling Glance from thee. O Gracious Love! Thy Sweets excel All things below: Alas! Earth's Beauty cannot parallel Thy meanest Glimpse, I know; For one's an Earnest of ne'er-fading Joy; The other's an ensnaring Soul-deluding Toy. Thy smallest gentle Ray invites Our Souls to taste Those never-fading fresh Delights, Which always last; And, as desired, more increase, Unto the humble holy Child of Peace. Mark how the Tapers feeble Light, With Glimm'ring Ray, Gilds as it were the Shades of Night, Instead of Day; But what's its Lustre, when the Sun appears T'Illuminate our doleful Hemispheres! So, tho' Earth's Pleasures sometimes do, With seeming Joys, Allays small Sorrows, mitigate a Wo, That from her Toys Proceeds, and vex the groveling Soul that feeds Upon her empty Husks, and noisome Weeds. Yet when the Brightness of thine Eye Doth from above Discover dark deluding Vanity, And with its Love Invite; how less than nothing then are those Fondly Ensnaring Toys, and Flatt'ring Shows, Which only by Reflections do Produce Remorse In th'injur'd Conscience, to increase the Wo That will with Force Fall upon those that dote on Fading Toys, But slight the Light that leads to endless Joys? Ah then, who can enough admire Thy Love, thy Light! Who can but long, with strong desire, For such Delight! This is the Light of Life, fades not away, But shines—more bright unto the perfect Day. Of FRIENDSHIP. Vertue is the right sacred Spring, whence flows Those Christal Streams, whereby true Friendship grows; That dear Affection, that firm Unity, That Interwoven free Community, Which so engageth Hearts and Minds together, No stormy Sea, nor utmost Lands, can sever These willing Captives: For the Gen'rous Mind Is not by place, though far remote, confin'd. True Friends, when they by distance are bereaven Of Verbal Converse, have their Names engraven In one anothers Hearts, which cannot be Cancell'd or Raz'd by Earths vain obloquy: Yet, lest the same should, as a Glimm'ring Spark, Seem to expire, as buried in the Dark, There is by Mediums (if the place deny Them, viva voce, free Community) Reciprocal Reflections of its Beams Unto each other, couch'd in sable Streams; Tho' the abounding Solace doth increase, When Friends converse together Face to Face; Then freely they Unbosom their Requests, And treasure Secrets in each others Breasts, As in firm Cabinets, close lock'd, where none Can find the Key, but only each his own. Is one oppress'd with Grief? He lays a share Upon his Friend, that he may help to bear: Swims one in Solace? Finds he cause of Joy? 'Tis then re-doubled by Community: Mourns one? the other Mourns: Doth one Rejoyce? His Second Self then, both in Heart and Voice, Doth Sympathize: True Friendship may not be Without an inward secret Sympathy. But fawning Parasites, tho' they pretend, In Complement, to be each others Friend, For meer Self-int'rest, or some close design, Become, if not proud Enemies, in time Absolute Strangers; and so manifest True Friendship ne'er was grounded in their Breast. Altho' there was some formal Shew, whereby Some were deluded, through Hypocrisie, T'impart their hidden Secrets, which are now Made Proclamations, with a scornful Brow; Nor are Reproaches, taunting Calumnies, Backbiting, Railing, other Injuries, With-held, as opportunity affords Them vent for Wrath, with either Tongue or Swords; Surely, because such do not rightly know That Innate Spring, which makes true Friendship grow: For this, by Covenant, doth so engage Their Noble Hearts, that no Self-wounding Rage Can here prevail, or once dissolve the Knot Friendship hath ty'd: Mistakes are soon forgot, If any interpose, or would present Some Crime, to cause a Frown in discontent. There's Charity in Friendly Breasts, that heals Such Scars, whereby true Love, not Rage, prevails: And when it is unto Perfection grown In both their Hearts, such Scars are seldom known. Gentle Advice, whereby one may reclaim A Friend from Error, doth not wrong the Name, Or make a Breach in Friendship: None may be Rightly esteem'd a Friend, that if he see His Neighbour lose his Way, will not direct Unto a better; or that will reject Good Exhortation, fancying Reproof A greater Crime than he is guilty of. Self-hood is often Blind; therefore a Friend Is not prohibited to reprehend, So he proclaim not Faults. But they that would Sin uncontroul'd, and hug their Errors, should Never contract a Friendship, lest thereby That sacred Name be stain'd with Infamy. Is any Wise, that when Distempers do Begin to seize, would not desire to know? Diseases known, are sooner cur'd; but they That would indulge and hide them, that they may Thereby increase, do frequently expose Themselves, as a Derision to their Foes. True Cordial Friends, without offence, can bear Kind Admonition, though it be severe. The faithful Wounds of Friends are like Incision, Made by the Skilful Hand of some Physitián, To let out noxious Humours, that invade The afflicted Part, and stubbornly impede The hoped Cure; which afterward with speed Doth, by some suppling Ointment, well succeed. Thus, by this needful Freedom, Friendship shines With greater Lustre; but its Light declines, Where this is limited. Who can but grieve To be so overpow'r'd, not to relieve A Friend afflicted; that may not apply A precious Balm to heal his Malady? But there's Rejoycing, when with equal Mind Exchanging Thoughts, they may in any kind Express their Sentiments, and signify Reproof or Approbation faithfully. Thus still persisting in the sweet Increase Of Love unfeign'd, and firm abiding Peace: Here Innocent Delights more freely springs, Than may be found in Courts of mighty Kings. But as true Vertue's rarely to be found, So Friendship grows not up in every Ground: He that would choose a Friend, should prove and try; Before the Knot be knit, none should unty, While either Friend remains; for Friendship must (Though one be separated unto Dust) If poor Mephibosheth survive, extend To the Posterity and Name of Friend; Else that's imperfect, which should rather be A little Ray of Immortality. Hast thou a Friend, whose Ingenuity, Well guarded with a right Simplicity, Can both esteem what thou'lt communicate, And of his own richly retaliate The hidden Treasures of a knowing Breast, Whose Cordial Love (too great to be express'd By feigned Speeches) freely can reveal His Secrets in thy Ear, but thine conceal Close from all others, whose Fidelity Will ne'er desert thee in Adversity, Altho' the World Frown on thee, but remain In Offices of Love, the very same, Or more endear'd, than in Prosperity? If likewise thou retain Integrity; Or if thou'rt overtaken by surprize, And hast transgress'd, can deeply sympathize, (If thou forsake thine Error, and accept Of Counsel, that advice may take Effect) And, as in secret, mourning over thee, Can with Love's Garment, wisely cover thee From th'Eyes of others; yet if Scandals should (When rais'd by others) in his Ear be told, Will still thy true Intelligencer be; Yet boldly guard thy Name, and plead for thee, When thou art absent: Know, that he expects Friendship should have in thee the same Effects; Yet hates Upbraiding, or a Slanderous Tongue: What can to Friendship be a greater Wrong? But those that flatter thee in prosp'rous Times, And subtilly indulge thy darling Crimes; Will not endure a blust'ring Storm, but flee, And, with thy Riches, haste away from thee. This is a Friend indeed, that cannot be Brib'd with thy Wealth, or lost in Misery: O grant him in thy Heart a worthy place! And see, as in a Glass Face answers Face, Thou answer him; yea, prize him more than Gold Of Ophir; for his Worth cannot be told. 'Tis but the wise and honest Heart, from whence Deceit's exil'd, that's Friendships Residence. A Letter to a Friend. Sometime this Query riseth in my Mind, Can Friends be to each other so unkind, Thus to perplex, and yet not shew the Cause Why Friendship should admit so long a Pause? Hath Grandeur stupify'd thy fertile Quill, Or Mammon metamorphos'd thus thy Will? So Condescending formerly, and kind, As if to Love and Friendship most inclin'd. Methinks abundance of such outward Store Should ne'er abridge our time, but gain us more. Not that Wealth can add Number to our Days; But Time (wherein the Indigent may raise Some Stipend, to procure their daily Food) Might be improv'd, as for a mutual Good, By such as have obtain'd a full supply; Or else wherein doth the advantage lie Betwixt the Rich and Poor? Heaven still extends Bread, to sustain each to their latter ends. Then should not those, that greater Mercy share, Some Time for Friendship's Priviledges spare? But should my Grief by words be thus express'd? I'll cease to write, and only Sigh the rest; For since my Letters may not answer'd be, I may conclude, that all is Vanity. Another Letter to a Friend. My hasty Pen, about to write Unkind, (When interrupted by my zealous Mind) Again admits of dear Marcaria; tho' Thy tedious Silence gives affront unto True Cordial Friendship, which in ev'ry State Sweetly delighteth to communicate Pure Streams of Love, as opportunity Permits, to manifest its Sympathy: Which, seeming now to cease, gives cause of doubt, Some new Concern hath jostled Friendship out From that fair Bosom; where, if yet it dwell, 'Twill by its influencing Power dispel What'er would stop its Current: For we see That standing Pools oft-times corrupted be, When smaller Brooks, whose Streams do gently glide Along their Banks, are purg'd and purify'd. Alas, that Love that burns with fervency, Is frequently perplext with Jealousie! Then why so Silent? Why so strangely Mute? Must I indeed not only find my Suit Ungranted, but Disdain'd? And must I be Therefore unanswer'd, for a Penalty To be impos'd, as for a henious Crime? Tho' I forgot once a Request of thine, I did not wholly throw aside my Pen; But, as full fraught with other matter, when In hopes of sending, though I did omit To answer each Punctilio, yet I writ, (Grateful or not:) For my Officious Quill, As formerly engag'd, is ready still To write to thee.— Ah! Canst thou think what Doubtings do attend, Whether sad Sickness, or some rival Friend May now so long restrain thy careless Pen, As if it would not deign to write ag'in? Or must that Friendship in Oblivion Iye, That seems Immortal? Then send Reasons why: How should I else resent this Injury? Upon Parting with a Friend. 1 And can the affects of Cordial Friendship be So apt to raise a Tumult in the Mind? Or so injurious to my Friend and me, To make us to each other seem unkind? 'Twere then but weak; nay Weakness surely must Be challeng'd ours: Friendship is always just. 2 May we not innocently then rejoyce In the Society of Bosom-Friends? Yea; yet we cannot always have our choice, Since things below unto Mutation tends. True Friends must part of meer necessity; Best Titles here are but uncertainty. 3 Yet might the Ocean cease to ebb and flow, Ere I should once ungratefully deny Those Obligations deep, whereby I owe Much more to thee, than my poor Company Could e'er retaliate in many days; But I might suffer Losses other ways. 4 Whilst she, obliging she, might never want, What was so much desir'd, Society; There's many too ambitiously would grant That which themselves would so much gratify. Why should she then strive for a thing so mean, And scarcely worth the Labour to obtain? 5 Then why should too too furious fiery Zeal, Usurp a place in such a Noble Heart, Where only Love should evermore prevail, (As knowing best to act true Friendships part) Which thinks no Evil, but doth tenderly Heal, or conceal and hide Infirmity? 6 They that are unengag'd in Wedlock, seem T'enjoy a Priviledge of Liberty, To act Spontaneously, and may redeem Time to enjoy a Friend; yet frequently Such can plead urgent Business to withdraw, And think it is no Breach of Friendships Law. 7 When such as are by nuptial Tye confin'd, Should not be censur'd in Sarcastick Strains, Lest some seem Cruel, when they would be Kind; And so change Mutual Pleasures into Pains: Therefore let Heats and Animosities, On Friedship's Score, no more among us rise. A Letter of Invitation to a Friend. If to the Country I my Friend invite, 'Tis but to do languishing Friendship right: What to a Friend can be a greater Wrong, Than that the Second's absent over-long? Now, tho' our Cottage be but mean for thee, Make it more pleasant by thy Company. For tho' we think we have an Interest, Firmly secured in each others Breast; Yet if it cease to circulate and flow, 'Twill sooner stagnate, than increase and grow. Ne'er let it be like that adored Gold, Possess'd by wretched Misers, (that of old Conceal'd and hid it) useless, lest we seem Quite to reject, and lose that just Esteem, Due to the Root, from which true Friendship springs, Which to the Heart, Immortal Solace brings. Indeed in high-flown Panegyrick Verse, My Pen is not accustom'd to rehearse Praises incredible, nor to Commend, In deep Hyperboles, a worthy Friend; Yet she that treasures Vertue in her Breast, Shines in those Robes, wherewith it doth invest The truly Noble Soul, whereby each Eye Something of Innate Lustre may espy. Then may such well assert, like Sheba's Queen, When she great Judah's King and Court had seen, One half had not been told; So may it be Affirm'd by many that have heard of thee: Why then should this mean Pen pretend to tell Half of those Vertues that in thee excel? A Meditation. 1 Why should the pure Immortal Mind, That cannot Circumscribed be Within the Bonds of Flesh and Blood, Seem to Fallacious Toys inclin'd; Neglective of the chiefest Good, And only true Felicity, The never-fading Joys of vast Eternity. 2 Were wretched Infants Naked hurl'd Upon the Banks of sullen Cares, To beg the Favours of the World, And only be involv'd in Snares, And suckled at the Breasts of Misery; Unless in all things they comply With Earth's imperious Nods, and sordid Tyranny? 3 No, no; that all-discerning Eye, That with a strict observant Look Surveys the corners of the Universe, And Tokens of his Pow'r disperse Therein, who now and ever took Care of the Helpless, cannot pass them by, Since the young Ravens Wants he doth supply, 4 But an Instructive Lesson's learned hence, That helpless Man might look unto The all-preserving Hand of Providence, From whom alone all Blessings flow; To whom alone our humble Eye Should always in Sincerity Be lifted up, for he'll regard our earnest Cry. 5 Though Infants many days, do more Regard the Pap than her that gives it, They learn in time both to implore Help, and t'acknowledge who relieves it; And, though they do not want the Breast, Would with their tender Mother's Bosom ever rest. 6 Thus is not both our Heart and Mind Taught, with Magnetick Influence Of sacred Love and Sympathy, That we thereby might be inclin'd To soar above the Sphere of Sense, Of perishing Mortality; Yea, with unwearied Fervency, Seek the Sublimer Joys of bright Eternity? Another Meditation. Oh! If my Mind Should be inclin'd, This would Increase my Fear: Lord, from above, Thou God of Love, Reveal thy Counsel near; That I may know, That I may do Thy Ever-Blessed Will: Ah, thine alone, And not mine own, Great King! Do thou fulfil. Dat veniam Corvis, vexat censura Columbis What a Succession of Delusion's here, Whilst Righteous Reason is dethron'd! Shall Darkness thus cover our Hemisphere? Ah! Must no other Law be own'd, But a depraved Will, that still inclines To choose the worst, and leave the best; Disdaining to observe the Sun, that shines Within the Conclave of the Breast? Why, both in former and more modern Days, Should Vertue, as an henious Crime, Be prosecuted! Lest its Conquering Rays, Through the whole Universe should shine, And thence dispel the horrid Shades of Night, That does surround poor Mortals, so That till this, rising, undeceive the Sight, They wound their Friend, and spare their Foe: Striking at pure unspotted Innocence, Condemning true Sincerity, As Malefactors, guilty of Offence; Whilst Barabbas hath Liberty Granted by common Suffrage: Birds of Prey And Rapine, may uncensur'd tear The harmless Doves; and who dare that gainsay? But unto these, (Oh) how severe! Yet have some few been rais'd in ev'ry Age, Led by a Spark of Light and Love Divine, which, as in secret, did engage To plead a little for the Dove; At least, to manifest their Discontent, As none of the Confed'racy; That they might either limit or prevent The Progress of such Tyranny; And, like the wise Gamaliel, intercede With sober Caution, to beware, Lest some thereby the Prince of Heav'n invade, And cast themselves into a Snare; Yea, Launch thereby into the sad Abyss Of Endless Wo and Misery; Except, Reclaim'd by such Advice as this, They learn to shew more Clemency. A Letter to Cousin F. R. [Written after her Marriage.] Dear Cousin, thine is safely come to Hand, Whereby I may thy Welfare understand; Which is right pleasant welcome News to me, As the like Notice here of mine to thee: For mutual Love, where it abides, doth joy In Friends, as in their own, Felicity. O may it ever have preheminence! Then shall we not be apt to take Offence, Nor wilfully offend; but in each Breast, Where it prevails, believe and hope the best: This still indulgeth Amity and Peace, But causeth Animosities to cease; Distance of Miles can never quench the same, It lives a Warming, not Consuming Flame: In which I re-salute thee, and remain Thy constant Friend, not changed but in Name. Another Letter to Cousin F. R. No doubt, ere this Rejoycing Friends are come, Congratulating thy Arrival home; And with the kindest Welcome, signify Their Expectation, to renew the Joy They'd formerly in thy Society. But sure, a watchful Heart may never be Lost (tho' engag'd) in multiplicity; But eyes the Rock, which, when in rowling Waves, Is safe to Anchor on, and firmly saves, As in a Cliff, or secret hiding place, Free from the dangers of Tempestuous Seas; Wherein, as any doth securely stand, Such cannot be unmindful of a Friend That doth in such like Habitation dwell, But can delight by Tongue or Pen to tell Their Exercises, with Endearments free; Love circulating thus in Sympathy. But scarce had these my Musings finished, With many more quite lost and scattered, For want of Penning, when thy Letter came, And prov'd my hopes deferr'd were not in vain; Therefore in curtale Lines herewith I send My Sentiments thereof to thee, my Friend. A Third Letter to Cousin F. R. Can I be silent, though I seem t'intrude 'Mongst such a throng'd important Multitude? Can I forget that Heart, that seem'd to me Firmly engag'd in mutual Sympathy, And Bonds of sacred Friendship, which were then Suppos'd Immortal? Can my sluggish Pen Forget its useful Office, though it want That influencing fair Encouragement, Which once was wont so freely to distil In copious Lines, from thy more pregnant Quill? Nay, nor although I own Realities, May I in curled Strains Hyperbolize, That innate Vertue, which in thee doth lye, Needs no such varnishing, vain Sophistry: This nought avails, but, like Adventures, toss'd On Boistrous Seas, may well be reck'ned lost, If no Return be made: Yet may there be A better Traffick 'twixt my Friend and me, If she'll but deign to step from out the Crowd Of those Incumb'rances, which so be-cloud And intercept that Converse, which should be Not too too long confin'd in such as thee; Who, by Example and good Converse, may Lead on Associates in an happy Way. Should then this fading World again e'er find So great a place in that Heroick Mind, Which heretofore so prudently deny'd Its Grandeur, Pomp, and all its swelling Pride, To treasure up a far more Noble Prize, Than can be well observ'd by common Eyes, Which dote on Toys, and can admire the blaze Of transitory Honours, but soon daze At the Appearance of that Glorious Light, Which to th'Immortal Soul gives perfect Sight And Prospect of the new Jerusalem, Where the Redeemed wear the Diadem Of Endless Glory, and Rejoyce to sing Melodious Songs of Praise to Sion's King? Should then this World's Inferiour Trifles be Of such regard, as to prevail with thee To look aside? Ah! nay; For thou hast learn'd To pass by all her Triumphs unconcern'd. Now therefore, persevere, my worthy Friend, In that where Friendship never knoweth end. M. M. UPON SILENCE. [Written by another Hand.] 1 What Muse so soft, or who is fit to sing Thy Praise, thou mighty Passive Thing? Who can Define thy Genealogy, Thou Product of the Deity? For before any thing, thou hadst thy Place Extended through the wide and empty Space. 2 Th'Inhabitants above, in that bright Sphere, Acknowledge thee a Being there, When they their Hymns and Hallelujahs sing To their High and Heavenly King, In a most Reverend Frame, make use of thee To magnify the great Solemnity. 3 When Horeb's Mount was topt with Fire &amp; Smoak, And with a Dreadful Trembling shook; To add unto its Horror and its Wonder, The Rocks and Mountains split asunder: Yet ne'ertheless, JEHOVAH was not there, But in the Silent Voice he did appear. 4 Tho' Voice and Speech alone to Man was given, To worship Him, whose Throne is Heaven; Yet in an awful Reverend Silence, He Admits of a Discovery; For to his Ears, Words utter'd without Noise, Are louder Languag'd, than a Vocal Voice. 5 What Praise is due to thee, thou calm Abode, Thou Rest of Souls, that worship God In thy Recess; the Spirit doth convey To Man the Knowledge of the Way, That leads to where Desires terminate, Where more's enjoy'd than Mortals can relate. 6 Tho' some confess the Pleasure of thy Loves, Thy nightly Walks and silent Groves, Thy sweet Retirements, and thy pleasant Shades, Where neither Wind nor Storm invades; Where Pleasure's free, unmixt, and unconfin'd, Always attend upon a quiet Mind. 7 Yet very few there are, that really be Fully Satisfy'd with thee: Therefore thine Artless Altar neglected lies, For want of holy Votaries; Whil'st Noise, thine Enemy, ascends the Chair, And Crowds her Praises Eccho through the Air.
