      <field name="fulltext">To the ryght Honorable, Sir Henrie Compton knight, Lord Compton of Compton hole, R. S. wisheth long life with increase of honour. As Moyses once by law then made Was taught to swimme and not to wade Ariued (by God) at Princes place, Whom Pharaos daughter tooke to grace. And brought hym vp, and taught hym so, Who prooued at length as well ye know: So I by chaunce thys Pamphlet here Dyd saue sometime from water cleere, And tooke it vp and brought to light, To be defended through your might. And so your Honours fauor finde, According to the Authors minde. Foure yeere and more I dyd hym nurse. Although no whit it cost my purse, Yet driuen at length at cost to be, Because your Lordship should it see, Yet no such cost as shall appeare, But mende my purse within the yeare. Th' aucthor sure I doe not know, No whether he be high or low, Or now aliue, or els be dead: But this in few words may be sead. Hoping your honor accept it will, According to the Authours skill. And for my part still shall I pray, That God your Lorship blisse alway. R. Smith. The most famous and tragicall history of Pelops and Hippodamia. The argument of the Historie following. Onomaus was king of Archadia, vnto whom it was told by the Southsayers, that whomsoeuer his onely daughter Hipodamia did marie, he should dye, she comming to her ripened yeeres, he proclaymed a prize of running with Chariots, that whosoeuer did vanquish him therin, should marry Hippodamia, and haue the Realme with her, but the vanquished should dye. Many of the Woers were slayne: at last Pelops promised priuily to Myrtilus that if hee shoulde winne the prize, Myrtilus should lye with Hipodamia the first night: Whereupon he made the Axiltree of wax, by reason wherof in the course the Charet fell downe, which Onomaus th? perceyuing, slew hymselfe, and Pelops enioyed the Lady, and Myrtilus requyring that which was promised, Pelops threwe hym into the Sea, which euer after was called mare Myrtonum. There stretcheth long a Realme in Greece, of antique bruice and fame, Whose memory remayneth yet, Archadia it we name. Which title Archas sonne of Ioue, bestowed on that land: Who ruled there with Regall crowne, and golden mace in hande. There is the fenne of Lernea, where Hidra a monster great With hundred hissing Serpents heads, retayned there her seate. Til Hercules inforced was with strength the fiend to gripe, And Erymanthus riuer there, his surging course doth keepe. Where once the scepter help in throne Omaus with his might, One of the sonnes of dreadfull Mars, the furyous God of fight: Which wight of Parge sisters three, such grace he gan obtayne, That they did all forbeare to cut or shred his thread in twaine. Wherby he drewe his vitall web, vntil the siluer heares Gan grow vpon hys aged skull, for cause of many yeares. He only Hippodame had, hys daughter damsel fayre. Which by descent and due desert, should stay his lawfull heire. Who guyded was in seemely life, by learned Sages store. And as she doeth encrease her dayes, so vertues hath she more. She was her fathers only ioy, the fortresse of his life She left was only of his stock then sole without a wife. In somuch that the greatest care and studie of the king, Was aye in vertues lore to trayne and this hys daughter bring, Which vertues she conceiued so, and printed in her hart, As fast as learned Patrons could instruct her them by arte. Which caused her in flaming yeres, to beare the worthy fame: And ne to haue among the rest, her mate, a courtly dame. But that she dyd excell and shade the shape of euery wight As much as Luna with her hornes surpast a starre by light. These vertues and the like so rare enforst the father olde With zealous care his daghter and her state for to behold, And to prouide that damage small hereafter should annoy The tender corps by any meanes of thys his only ioy. For which intent he did retayne with him in Court alwayes A number seene in Magike arte and prone for such assayes: Which by their learned skil forshew vnto the king and his Those things that long shal after fal of euil hap or blisse. Which men Omaus king gan will in presence for to come, Which do approch, their dutie eke with bended knee soone downe, Do listen then to heare their charge: to whom the king gan say. My tryed friends, ye learded peeres, in whom my trust doth stay, As heretofore ye faithfull haue been vnto me and mine, In all aspects and great affayres, so now your eares encline: You all do know our daughter dear, our Hippodame milde, Who seemeth now in youthly yeeres, a most vertuous childe, And shunneth yet each sinfull lore, as farre as I can know, Whereby to me no little ioy, through her I say doth grow: Yet doubting now dame Fortunes wheele, which whirle th very strange, I aske your ayde, for to preuent and stop a sodeyne change. For Fortune frayle not surely stayes her steppes still in one place, But turneth as the winde, whereby I stay in doubtfull case. What if that she should be infect with Venus wanton sport, Or other like: or if that shee should any ill report, That may vnwished come to passe? I silie wight in woe, Might wail the case of this my child, her selfe which noyeth so: For youth is fraile, and tendeth not sometimes to sage aduise, And shunneth that which they perceiue Those men which do seem wise, For to embrace: for they whom that olde Senex staffe hath smite, In sadnes, not in youthly pranks doe studie and delite. But youth doth tread the path to find and earst t'obtaine that still, Which they perceiue doth please the flesh, hap either good or ill. And you doe know, there nothing is that fraile flesh pleaseth more, Than that which doth depend on vice, wereof there raigneth store. And I remember Venus sonne who with his shaft and bowe Doth often peerce the harts of those who like pangues did ne know Alas if that should light on her, as likely sure it is, Unwares to me then might I say adue my ioy and blisse. For that blind boy doth cast his dart, not on the meanest sort, As soone as on those stately Peeres, that places haue in Court. For why they driue their time in ease and idly spend the day They feede on dayntie dishes rare and rest on downe for aye, There is no pleasure but they taste as may content the hart Which are the causes that he doeth so soone throwe them his dart. For if thou banish idlenes, thou breakest then the bands Which Cupid doth with flight deuise to tangle both thy hands If she should chaunce to fix hir mind in loue with one that is Inferior in degree to her which match were farre amisse, I should be loath, therfore, my frends of this her destinie, I wil that ye ensearch foorthwith, and it reueale to me, To this intent I may prouide, for to preuent the same, If it should happen for to be impayring to her fame. Yet willingly I would that she should ioyne with one in loue As meete is in degree, which doeth from him all vice remoue, For this I know the time will be if that her yeres endure, Needs she must knit her selfe to one in wedlock ioy most pure. Wherfore repaire to th' used place and with our Gods assent As touching Hippodamia, to know their high intent. And take the fairest goate that may within this towne be found Him offer vp in sacrifice, to them, whose laude doeth sound Aboue the starres, who rule the globe who sitte aboue the starry skye, And know such things as earst were past, and those to come perdy. Then they all on their bowed knees, vnto the earth doe fall And one of them doth answere then and thus in name of all, O king, if that we would not graunt now to thy best and thee, Unworthy we were of our liues, true subiects ne were we. If that by Magike art we may satisfie thee in this, We are right glad that by the same we thee auferre such blisse. And now there doth remain no more but th' while to loue I pray, To further that our enterprize, which fortune doth assay. This Onomaus king was of and held the Paynim law, He knew not then the liuing God ne kept himselfe in awe: Wherefore he gan erect a place as best he had in thought, Where hee and earst his subiects moe, to fayned Gods they sought. Herein were aulters many store, where when in smart they fall, They offer vp their Sacrifice, and to their Gods they call. The cause is say they (for why) they offer vp such gift And offerings brent for Sacrifice is for a proper shift, For this they thought, sith that so farre of distance were the skies, Their voice might scarce be heard, or els so high as skies arise, Yet often they doe prayers houle vnto their gods aboue: To this intent when loud they crie, they might by chaunce haue loue: And eke on aulters them to moue with burned flesh intend, The smoke whereof in litle while might vnto them ascend. And thus although no voice might be so high as skies inclinde. Yet by the incense thereof, they might vnderstand their minde: For smoake (they say) goes vpward still, and riseth with the winde. These wisemen to the temple goe, with hast for to fulfill The hest of Onomaus king, and search for good and ill. They bring with them the kyd his death which resieth to receiue, And one of them with peerecing knife doeth force him life to leaue. And wringing out the blood also, depriuing him his skyn, They prayers say, which they suppose doeth cause the Gods to blinne. Then kindle they the fire, and throw the Goate into the same. For to consume to ashes aye by violence of flame. They mark the diuers colours that in waste doe flee therehence, The raynbow hue, to deeme thereby of Gods the high pretence. Some on Saturnus call, and some on Iupiter doe crye, Some on Mars, and some on Sol, yea some on Mercurie, Some on Venus, some to Luna make their vocation. No god there was but him they had, in appellation. As diuersly their mindes were sette, so diuersly they cal Eche one vnto his god to proue which happyest would befall So they consume the tyme vntyll the fleshe is almoste spente, Then deeme they what shall happen, as they thinke is Ioues entent, And other gods: then pray they one whiche oldest was of all, To shew them first what he did thinke shoulde afterwarde befall. But he with pause doth stay, as though some doubt he did perceyue, His rolling eyes caste vp, and musing he doth leaue And said: my freendes and fellowes deare shall I nowe tell in deede, This case, or as I thinke thereof? the more haste the worste speede. I well perceyue by th' azure hue, that paynted aye the flambe, And by the string that helde the heart of this our killed lambe, With other signes but euill newes, for vs aye to declare, It certayne is when Hippodame in mariage linke doth fare, Our king must lose his life perforce whether he will or no, Such froward destinie for him the Gods haue graunt to shoe. And was not aye the verie like reueled to you all, Alas, this cruell sodaine chaunce my minde doth much appall. How say my friends? but now such feare hath strike them to the heart, That they haue now scarsce power to speake or him thereof impart. At length they causde him vnderstand that they did know full well The same, but that they gaue to him the preheminence to tell And first declare the same, for hee, was oldest them among, For reuerence ouht be giuen to th' old men, of the young: They all deuise the meane whereby they may this expresse Unto Omaus, which doth expect an answere more or lesse: And then that aged father doth his tale againe renew, Full bent to waile their owne state, as after doth ensue. Alas what hap had we (quoth he) this arte for to assay, Why did not we bestowe our minds or wits another way? I muse wherfore each wight with tongue doth this our darke estate Most happy call, when vs they minde and when of vs they prate, And blabbe that we each thing doe knowe and ken each destiny, And eke the knots of fortunes laund can vndoe by and by. Alas if that we tel a man his present froward fate, Then are we sure of hym to haue and purchase peeuish hate. And although hys desire be to know the very same, Yet naythelesse if it be sharpe he giueth vs the blame, Againe, or els if we conceale, and doe not tell the trueth Then are we sure and certayn that the wrath of God ensueth. Thus on ech side the doubt is playne the perill is more great, We are in worse case then they whom the destinies doe threat. As now when that we doe foretel this hap vnto the king, Who knowes what he in raging fits wil doe, or els what thing With mischiefe shal be done by him, perhaps in that his ire, He wil pretend to slay vs than to quench his burning fire. As thogh that we were cause thereof our selues this doe we know Nor cannot aye vnlesse we should more sacrifices showe To deeme therby our frowarde fate but now the time doth haste That we must wend vnto our king, and spend no winde in wast. I would to Ioue that we might stay, vntil to morow day, And then to yeelde our answere vp the while we would assay By incence sweete the destinie that happen should to vs. Then each doubt and each fearful poynt we would our selues discusse, But now there is no remedie, Omaus king doeth stay Ere this time long in closet tilte to heare what we can say. He thinkes it long til that we come to tel to him this spight, Come let vs goe, the gods vs shield, and succour with their might. Thus passe they on their way vntill vnto the hall they come, From thence they passe the chambers large, and goe through many a roome, Vntil the priuie chamber they, approach, wherein the king Remayned then, whom they salute as best with their liking. Then bowe they down their knees to th' earth, then one of them gan say O soueraine king our liege and Lord thus much we doe thee pray, Sith thou doest wil that we reueale such things we know to thee, To pardon vs, what euer that of vs shall spoken be. That being graunt, we boldly then our mindes may whole expresse And open thee each darkened poynt, as thou erst wouldst no lesse, Which he gan graunt thus much, and sayes some peruerse newes I feele, Because ye doubt mine ire, alas I dread dame Fortunes wheele. Perdy I thinke if that my chaunce were happy me to saue There were no neede that pardon thus, of me you yow should craue. Oh tell the same, then they agayne the Gods that rule the skye, And turne the rounded globe, whose power and whose authoritie Thou mayst ne gaynsay once, to vs thus they declare, That wh? thy daughter Hipodame in wedlock bands doth fare (Which now in ripened yeres doeth waxe) that thou shalt lose thy life, The very day most sure in which she giuen staies a wife. Thus much we learned haue, thus much the peruerse destiny Of thee for her by offrings brent, we know assuredly Prouide therfore it happen that, as sure as Ioue doth raigne As true as sonne of Mars thou art in skies which did remayne Then he as foming bore that whets his tuskes against the fight, Doth rage with puffed face, and erst with swelling eyes for spight. His ire permits his tongue to tel the greefe he bides with payne. So vanquisht he with fury was, in dumpe doth so remaine, At length when memory he found his sparkling eyes at last. Upthrowen, this tale with warbling tongue among them be outcast, Oh Ioue what cruel hap is this, what deuilish desteny, What horror doeth inuade my brest? because that I must dye. And must I die in deede for that as yet I neuer knew I neuer knew my fate before what after should ensue Oh fortune, fortune, which ne treades her steps still in one place, But wauering here and there most fraile, as doutfully doeth trace Why deales not she as equally the golden gifts she hath, But setteth some to top on high and some treades vnderneath. Oh Hippodame is this the gift and recompence I haue Because that I thee trayned thus in Courtly place so braue? Is this the fruite I reape of thee, who in thy childish yeres Didst shew to me thy sire such hope, and sprang me siluer heares: Alas, alas, that thou shouldst be the causer of my greefe, Which wast the only ioy to me and fortresse of my life. The staffe wherby I leaned, when I fel in any smart, As often as I thought on thee, ful light was then my hart Oh Aesculap reuiue my corps that passeth now to woe, Come Clio help my parched paines and haples hap to showe. Ther was not since the world began a wight that felt such greefe As how I feele, or had such cause to wayle his noyed life. Can there be any greater payne or torment can you tell, Be thought by furious fiery fiendes, that lurke below in hell, I reade that Ixion is tur- ned there, and tost on hie, For promise broke, or whirling wheele. so for desert perdy, Sisiphus doeth on shoulders beare the stone to top of hyl, Which rolling downe again, he doth renue his paynfull ill. Amyd the lake with thirsty iawes olde Tantalus therein Pursues the waues the water stream doth wet and wash his chinne. And when to him now oft deceaued it doeth yet promise make Then flits the flood the fruite at mouth, his famine doth forsake. I reade also how Titius heart, to flying foule is praye, And Danaus daughters fill in vaine their watry vessels aye. And all these feele such pangues and paynes for some their iust desert But I as giltles now abide, it for to peerce my heart. If for desert I felt the same lesse greefe it were to me But once being come t'expulse the same, I finde no remedy. Thus finisht be hys wayling stile commaunded earst with speede The Southsayers for to auoyde, which willingly for dreade. Consent, misdoubting much that he in fury fond some fact To them would doe, whereby their greefe, they should for nought exact. Omaus then be takes himselfe, and goes in couert wise, To garden plot, where by himselfe, he wayles with watry eyes, There doubts he what were best to doe, what remedy to finde What wile for to coyne out that might deceiue fortune vnkind. At last he thinks to slea and ryd his daughter of her life, For so much as she was the spring wherehence doeth flowe this greefe And better it to be that she in Charons boat should wean Then he, who being dead, t'ensue his destinie to end. For sith that Ioue appoynted hath, this destinie to take, Effect wheneuer that she did her sole estate forsake. If she were slaine before that time by no meanes he can see, Through her desert this hap to pas then no such hap to be. And so himselfe quyt for to leaue then stayeth he a while, At last he doeth reuoke those words and them from mynd exile. And poureth out this playnt agayne, ah myser, did I say That I with boysterous hand should pierce and Hippodame slay, I doe recant those words againe, in no wise it may be, She is mine only child, which by my wife was left to me. Shal I embrue my hands with blood or that doe in my rage, Which I did neuer yet commit shall I thus stayne mine age? No, no, and more then that, she is my only childe, Then she once dead, Archadia hath fewe the crowne to wielde, If I were dead also, therefore Ile search some witty wile. Wherby I may the churlish snares of dame fortune beguile. And from these parched pinching paynes my selfe for to beguile, And therby for to saue her life for if that she should dye, I glad woulde be my selfe to wende with hir, then by and by: And what that I did speake before I vtterly denye. In arbour he consumes the tyme, at length he doth arise, As Musa puts into his minde, a shyfte he can deuise, Which he thinkes best, this is the same: he myndeth to ordeyne A prize to runne with chariots swifte in fielde vppon the playne, And who so findes the chaunce the swyftest pace to trace, (And vanquished the king) thereby for to departe the place Shall wedde this dame, and when the lyfe of this king is in hande, T'inioy Arcadie realme, and earst the king therof to stand: But on the other side, if that Omaus geues the foyle, The vanquished to lose their lyues for ventring in the broyle. Thus he decreed in minde, thereby if happie that hee be, To winne the prize, if contrarie, his owne death for to see. And now when that he doth perceiue he found no better way, He hyes him into Pallace straight, to publish this for aye. And then in deede he calleth in one which most meete he found, For such assayes, whom he can will with trumpe in hand to sound In euery place within the Realme, the Cities of the land, Proclayming to each wight these words or lyke, which next doe stande. Here foloweth the Proclamation. If there be any wyght that myndes to trye By course of charets on the field sh playue, And eke before the route of chyualry UUorthy seeme to haue reward for payne, It stayes the wyll of Onomaus grace, That they approch within these thyrty dayes Unto the Court, where they shall finde in place Hymselfe sole prest to try in these assayes, Gaynst commers all, and who so vanquisht is On fyeld by hym, shall soone then lose hys lyfe: But who so ouerrunnes the king with blisse Shall espouse Hippodamia to hys wyfe: And furthermore the Realme for to enioy, After the death of Onomaus king. To hym without disturbance or anoy Of any man, and to hys chyldren after hym. Tubicen goes and passeth fro, he sounds in euery place The newes, and at the last returnes and is one in ioyous case, Because that this his toyle, and iournes is so past, The commons muse full fast on this, and are with feare agast, Not knowing what the cause shoulde bee of this so sudden change, But for the most part they impute this hap to fortune strange. And as the vulgar people muse, the nobles ioy againe, For ech of them doth thinke by fight this Lady to obtaine. Then might you see the knight concurre on heapes, to haue a sight Of Hippodam vnto the court t'encourage them to fight And they who that vile dastard hearts before time did possesse, In hope to winne this Ladie bright, them now to runne doe presse. So much the forme of women doth enforce men for to doe, Like as they neuer did before, ne like againe would so, Unlesse it were their enterprise as authors olde dyd shewe And they that learned are indeede, the very same doe know. The lusty gallants of the Court, that proper are and tall Do mynd to venter now themselues and hazard life and all. The choosing is of coursers braue, that trymly treads the way And wel is he that hath the best the cheefe to prooue that day. There trim they vp the charets light which put in redynesse Ech thing that they shal need in field themselues they see to dresse. The king also himselfe, his horse prouided he doth see, His charets al which lightest and most meete were thought to be. In these affayres they doe consume and spend the thirty dayes Ordeyning, and ech one hymselfe, to trye in these assayes, Thus all things set in order due as best were to deuise: Among the troupe of chyuallers, one Pelops doth arise. And vewing aye the seemly port of Hippodame bright He mynds to try himselfe to wynne her if he may in fight. There was that time one Myrtilus of fayned faith a wight, Who ruled the charet of the king and draue the horses right. To hym doth Pelops think to wend there some meane to deuise Wherby he may preuent the king, and bleare the lookers eyes. And thinks with gelt to ouercome this mysers feeble minde Or by some other way, he cares not what, so he may finde The meane to be Archadian king wherby he should enioy. This dame, and evry thing he would without let or anoy. And searching aye the Pallace large to finde this Myrtilus He commeth to his chamber, where at length sayes to him thus. My frend, thou knowest that in field the combat we shall see, And ventrous wights to bear the fame, amongst the chyualry, And as I one doe minde with force, to shew my selfe in fight To prooue if lucke will happen me to winne that Lady bright. Yet naychelesse by thy deuice if I might winne the same I should reward thy beneuolence aduauncing of thy fame. But Myrtilus with fayned shew of frendship to his Lord. Doth answere thus, in no wise I may vnto thee accord. Think not that I for this thy glose of promise fine, will shewe Me disobedient to my liege to whom I seruice owe. Aduancement ne I craue of thee my paynfull seruice may Preferment get me of our king wherfore thus much I say Forsake this place, and now desist with talke to trouble me. Then he which to obtaine his will no meane or way did see, Being almost in despaire of hope doeth hope yet once againe. To trye the wight which sayd hym nay, although it were his payne: Oh Myrtilus if that I may by any meanes aspire, To win the prize, and specially, if thou helpst my desire, Thou shalt be sure to match in bed with Hippodamie deare, If thou canst finde the wile to bring, to lucky end this geare. We are as frends, what neede these words and circumstance of stile? Eche thing shall common be with vs what euer hap the while. What though that thou doest play this pranke art thou the first that hath Been earst vnfaithfull to his Lord, for scant or els for scathe. Let musing go, though this seeme strange yet thinke if king I be I will reward this thy desert, as thou in time shalt see. Would it not moue a frozen heart yea flinted for to bowe, To haue in armes such damsels as, are rare I make a vowe? Thinke therfore on the night that thou in bed with her shalt haue, Who staynes each courtly dame that shines, for beuties gift so braue. Now Myrtilus euen as thou wilt to me thine answere show, If thou wilt not, I must goe seeke some other wight to know That may me ayd, and think not but if able that I be: This thy vnkindnes Ile requite what euer hap to me. Then he that stood so stiffe gan turne and vnto Pelops say More for the brunt of Cupid blinde, then any thing for aye, If that thou list thy hest to keepe, performde as thou doest vowe Ile stand content to pleasure thee, as much as I may showe. If thou canst be content, that I as thou hast sayd before, Shall lye with her, I will prouide that thou needest doubt no more For I wil make the Axeltree the charet which doeth beare Of waxe, which by force of a cracke most suddenly shall teare Wherby vnto the ground y? knowest the charet needes must fall: In so much as the Axiltree, doth beare the charge of all. Which beeing done, the course is lost then all the prize is thyne, And therefore in the wedding night, lette pleasure fyrst be mine. Thou knowst the king at eche course doth with changed charet runne, And then renewe his course agayne, as first it was begunne: Beware that thou doe not presume to run, till thou doest see The first course and the second too expired for to bee: Then valeantly foorth preace thy selfe for I wil ready stand, To offer him his wexed roome, which next shall come to hand. Then Pelops proud of this good hap gramercy sayes my frend As now I haue no more to say, for this thy councel kind, But farewel once, for Phaeton descendes Olimpus downe, And Phebus shunnes Proserpina, his foe, that hellish hound. And I will earst depart from thee those things for to prouide To morow which within the listes, in fight I shall haue neede Adue agayne then trudgeth he as fast as he can fly, Unto his chamber, where that he doth call to gods on hye For help, but chiefe to Venus mylde to whom young Paris gaue Before the rest for loue of Nimph the golden apple braue. And sith that Luna with her black and darkned horned hue, Doth cause the sparkling starres in skyes their places to renue. He thinks it best to clyme hys bed in sleepe to spend the night, That in the day betimes he might be ready for to fight The time thus doth consume &amp; wear the night doth vade away And Phebus getting th' upper hand, Proserpina doeth fray He shewes himselfe as cheeftain now with chariot in the skye, With twice two prauncing horses y? shewes hys authoritie. The smal birds by their chirping lay doe shew the time to wake, And sluggish bed the drowsie place, a tyme for to forsake For as the day appoynted is to haue with him for sight, Of things that appertayne to day so likewise is the night Appoynted hym things to be done which appertayne to light. Therfore each wight doth styrre hymselfe for so prepare, Into the field, and valiantly hys armes for to declare Among the rest Omaus doeth make ope hys drowsie eyes, Unwilling he to keepe hys bed doth suddenly arise. In mind to make thaduenture short to lose or els to wynne. Wherfore he hasteth first hymselfe the array for to begyn. Those youthful seemly knights who by their great desire Were pricked forth to try th?selues no lesse haste dyd require. They thinking long the time to bee themselues to field do hast And spend not iangling here &amp; there the day which is farre past When it was knowne by sounde of trumpe, the king at poynt to bee, A number prest in order braue a man might then espie For to attend vpon the king, yea rather on the wight For whose sake now eche one doth knowe to be this broyle and sight The king as cheefe and chalenger first marcheth on the waye, With all the crue of noble men him after in araye, Some wyth theire helmes besette with plumed fethers hye, Some on theire horsses heades for shewe doe put the like perdie, Which waueth with the winde: the thirde but in degree Doth Pelops ryde in perfect hope, but none so braue as he The charrets make acheere full shewe, the trumpets sounde woulde moue The heart of anie wight, yea sure the verie goddes aboue So shrill a note with puffed cheekes, those men with breth doe sounde, That from the earth it flyes to skies, from skyes agayne to grounde. The horses eares are filde with that they snort, and staring stand, They prauncing iette, to shew themselues which best might tread the land. But Hippodame whose face hath set each heart on flamed fire, Doth follow now with troupes of dames in sad and black attire. Not as she went the prize to see, with ioy or to behold But as though that she went to mourn, Oh wight of perfect mould. Those Ladyes that attend her trayne, in lyke suite goe they all, As though they wayled some their frend, which lately tooke a fall. Thus passe they foorth with measurde steps til they come to the place Where they appoynted are to stand as Iudges of the case. Within the lystes might no man come vnlesse they minde to trye Themselues, or footemen which attend the king and Princesse nie, Each one in order takes his roome where he himselfe would stand, To run his course, and take his lot which comes next to his hand. What should I say, the trumpets blowe the blast of battle braue, Each one doth hope by fortune good, himselfe to quite and saue. And now the time is come at poynte when first the king doth say He that doth mynd his charet first with mine for to assay, I wil that he come shew himselfe, then foorth one yodeth fast And sayes I am the wight, sir king, to whom first lot is cast. Then there remains no more, but both let run their charets light As swift almost as Iphicus were there beseene in sight. But loe the king hath woon the prize, as all men thought before The trumpets sound their warbling notes for ioy of that therfore, Then needes the lawe must rigor take which sight did much appall And dread the lookers on, so that thers none amongst them all That venter durst scarce for to runne but musing there they stand At length the second takes like charge, and enterprise in hand. Alas, he followes the other cleane, and taketh selfesame end. For lozing aye the prize, he doeth giue life it to amende. Now Myrtilus oh caytiffe vile, is ready for to bring With trayterous face the charet waxt with speed vnto the king. Which taken gratefully, the course doth then renewe, By Pelops Prince of Phrygia, in order to ensue. But loe, ere that demi the way the course had ouerpast That brittle axeltree of waxe euen with a thought was brast. And fell vnto the ground, wherfore Omaus seeing this: Drawes out his goring knife or sword with force he ne doth misse To stabbe hymselfe nye to the hart, such frenzie tooke him then, As scarce oppressed Hercules, when Iunos wrath began. The only prize is giuen to young Pelops, and the name Of Uictor doth remayne to hym and Fama shewes the same. The persed corps is taken vh, and as the guyse is there, Unto the temple of their Gods to burning him they beare. But Pelops takes the readie waye to Hippodamia sheene: Where as she stood on plated stage, to see and to be seene, His bonet vailed, humblie he gan say hir on this wise, Due reuerence once being done hys face toward the skyes, Oh rare seene sparke of beuties flame, oh Matron of the crue, Panthora thou, whose face doth stayne bright Phebus golden hue. Sith that the Gods aboue haue shewed to me such dignity, To beare the prize of winning thee, by true authority. To whom I render thanks for this I come now for to clayme And aske my right, for sith by Lawe, I woon thee in thys playne, I iudge thee mine, your Fathers hest doeth testifie the lyke. Then she whose roseall hue was staynde and hyd on euery cheeke, By spring of christall teares, at last this wise to him gan say, Sir Pelops thou of Phrygia Prince in whom vertue doeth stay, Sith that by armes I am your own, I thereto doe agree, As lawe requires: yet as thou art a knight, this graunt to me I may a while deplore the death of my vnhappy sire Who causer is of his owne fall by this his fond desire. For nature bynds the child to wayle this day let me haue sway To morow I for to commaund, am thine, and then alway And that I may those obsequies and rytes which appertayne To funerals fulfil, and then thine owne I doe remaine, Til Atropos my vitall twine entends to cut in twayne, If thou in heart agree also, and therefore I require Thee for to rest thy weary corps and me haue my desire. Then he replete with ioy, doth wend vnto the Pallace cleere, And Hippodame tendes the corps which layd is on the beere, With woful hart and dreary playnt, the Ladyes rest doe wayle, The king, but more bicause this wight so much her mone doeth vayle. The triumph thus mixt is with huge sadnes and some ioy, As some lament, so some reioyce, and thus they spend the day Til Omaus dead inioys the flame as worthy as may be, After the vse of Arabia as authors testifie. But oh, prince Phaeton forsakes with weary horse the hil, Descending down Olympus tops below to stay, vntyll By holes distinct, the time is set t'aduance hymselfe againe. Then evry wight betakes him selfe, to bed of releast payne, And though that Pelops throwes himselfe, on bed for shewe of rest Yet sleepes he not, so much with ioy, his heart is ouerprest. He hates this night, and hopes for day he thinks it long to see, Til that dame Hippodame she might his spoused mate once be. Who now her tender corps in bed hath hid in couert wise, Of whom likewise Somnies with sleight ganne approach their eyes. Whom dolor rules, and woe restraynes she wayles the haplesse hap Of her vnlucky Father, which Fortuna dyd entrap. Yet thinketh she her sorrowes large, now for to be the lesse Sith that for losse of father, she an husband shal possesse. These thoughts consume and driue the night tyl Sol doeth shewe hys hue And Terra glad thereof, doth now forsake her watrye dewe. Then might you see dame floras arte depaynted aye on greene How herbs start vp their heds aboue the ground for to be seene. Ech feathered fowle disdayns y? bush the tree is pearch for night, And resting boghs do seek their prais in fields where they are pight. And likewise as in siege each wight, is stirring here and there, Some doing this, some doing that, all busie euery where, For this day comes in which they minde with mirth and ioy to keepe. The mariage of two princes yong, which now forsake the sleepe. The nobles of the Realm make hast and say, its time that they Ordeine themselues the temple to therefore to come away. Oh if that Clio would accept, to shewe her worthy art In bookes to wryte the order that that day was kept with hart. Then might you see a triumph, as if Alexandrus were With all his iolilyke royaltie, in place among them there. But to proceed, they sease the church when trumpets sound the blast Where both they ioyn in one ere that the day was demi past. Euen as it did behoue such Peeres where both they crowned be The king and Queene of Archadie great ioy it was to see. Mens minds wer not so fangled th? as now they doe appeare Therefore eche solemne thing was done, more rudely as I heare But leaue we them to celebrate those things we haue in hand And reuert to the Pallace, where no wight doeth idle stand. But there prepare of costly cates a banket rare to see, As thogh the muses nine themselues inuyted guests should be. What shuld I say by al thing which present dyd there abound, It suffized then the very ground and floore for to surround? No heart could wish but there it was as dyd thereto pertayne No tonge can shew els what did lack but there it was full playne The diuyne rites performed then they both retyre at last, For Sol now in hys woonted roome, Meridyan is plast. Where they consume the time at meate, two houres large or more, The noble men attending aye and waytyng them before. Both Dukes and Earles with such lyke, and Barons of hye prise, Eche one in office dyuersly as best was to deuise. This dinner done, the armory beginneth for to sound, Which to the land of Pelops, and Hippodame doth redound There Orpheus scholers shewe, their masters skyll and arte Then youthly knights betake themselues all things els set apart To daunce and rayse the dames or Nimphes almost in sight. And so in pleasure they consume the tyme vntyll the night, The king departs the hall hymselfe, as fast as he can hye, Which Myrtilus as prone therfore, doeth suddenly espye. And thus he sayes, sir Pelops now, sith that you doe obtayne This dame and eke the Realme, by my industry and my payne, I reade you for to keepe your hest, the time is present now The night drawes on, therfore I pray remember wel your vowe But he these words doeth thunder out, oh caytyffe borne to ill, Oh myser most, dishonour such wouldst thou me bring until? Oh traytor vile, dissembler thou thou shalt haue thy reward. Because mine honor, and thy faith thou diddest not regard For thy desart and vsage aye, example thou shalt be, To other that commit such crime, what euer hap to me. Now Pelops calles to other, which he findeth best to trust, And painteth out this hap to them of Myrtilus vniust. Who being bound they throw on horse, vnto the sea they ride: There plunge they in this Venus child with this reproch that tide. Lye there thou Lecher, thou wouldst fayne asswage thy foule desire, On her who is thy Leege, on whom thou oughtst no shame require. And yet because that by this help, young Pelops gate the game, In memorie of him he would that sea to beare his name. This done, they all returne againe, vnto the woonted place But in the Citie they disguise themselues with hidden face, And maske vnto the Court, where that they spend much time in play, Not knowen who that they were, vntill they threwe their maske away, Which done the Queene departs the hall, each wight departs to rest, King Pelops wishing nothing lesse, is thereto likewyse prest. Where they content, both take their ease, as both they dyd require, And Pelops hath the onely wight, whom most he did desire. FINIS. Epigrams and Sonets. Of the most famous, renowmed, and thrice happie Realme of England. [Oh fertile soyle, thou little lande] Oh fertile soyle, thou little lande, that Anglia hath to name, Unto whose bankes and lymits set Brutus of perfect fame With forced shield gan turne his arme vnto thee now I say, These words to thee in whom the waues of hony sweete doe stay. In whom the floods of milke doe runne, and Nectar fine doth flowe, Like land our Lord to his elect, did promyse long agoe. If euer thou hadst cause to laugh, or ioyfull to be seene, Then clap thy hands, and thanke the God that gaue thee such a Queene. Whose vertues doe ascend and mount vnto the very skyes, And there doe moue the mighty Ioue, to turne to thee hys eyes. With louely hand to poure on thee, the seedes of this his grace And plentie causeth of all things to abound in euery place. Within thy compasse cut thou canst not truely witnes this, Before her dayes that like in thee there was such cause of blisse. Nor aye there is none other cause by wit which thou canst finde That mooued God to throw on thee such plenty thus assignde. But her, before her dayes, in bookes full playne its to beseene What war, what strife, and slaughter great in thee at once hath beene. What scarcitie with thee there was, what penury each thing, For want of grayne, the lack of foode dyd to thy bowels bring. The moued Gods by some thy fault, what euer sinne it were, Did thee inforce the horror huge, and wrack of warre to beare. By reason when the people faynt, and tyred could not toyle, To tyll this land, wherby almost it was vnfertile soyle. But now sith none there is in sight, oh thanke thy God therefore, And wish her life that is the cause of this thy perfect store. Who here in presence prayeth plain, vnto the Lord aboue, At whose request, and whose behalfe, he poures on thee such loue, Yet thinke not (litle Realme) that it is for thine owne assent, Thy sinne is sore, it is for her, or els thou mightst be shent. Her vertues shine as bright as stars as cleere as Phebus cheefe, The port of hir doth stayne the moon a Phenix by her life. For chastity Lucretia ne could that Romish dame Aspire to her, though while she liued she had the only fame. Let prudent Pallas pause a space and then for to eschue Let Clio muse to paint the gifts, which Ioue doth her endue: Who worthy is to rule and raigne besides her kingdomes three Ouer the globe which we account, all Chaos for to be. What shuld I say, what shal I write but laud the royall race Of her who by her passing port stayres Iunoes very face. Elizabeth whose name compact, doth stand of letters nine, The effect thereof and meaning true in fewe words to define. She loues the Muses nine, she loues their wisdome passinglie: She loues the sugred skil, she loues their lawes assuredly. Let ech true subiect on his knee with thankful heart stil pray For to preserue this noble Queene, in vertues lore alway. The queene of England, realme also of France and Ireland Whom God protect from all annoy by his most mighty hand. And graunt her subiects her to serue in heart with one accord: While she doth raigne here ouer vs, as long as please the Lord. And when that Atropos shal cut and shred her webbe in twaine, In skyes with him to ioy a place, for euer to remayne. [When Phebus in the azure Skye] The Author being minded to write, but lacking an argument, made this following, thinking wherof he were best to write. When Phebus in the azure Skye Gan mount with horses tracyng hye, Then was my mynd bent to endite, Some pretty toy with pen to write. Of quyls I had in place good store, With inke and paper meete therfore But arguments I wanted aye That might conduct me on the way At length when zelous study had Pretence to write of good or bad, As aye my mind dyd geue me skill, It selfe reprooued mine owne wil. I wil of kings goe tel the raigne, How they in throne doe hie remayne. That doth surpasse my base estate Some other thing Ile imitate Ile write of priestes, but with those It is mad medling in a glose. Of good men I wil somewhat shewe, But fewe such on earth I know Then wil I wryte of such therfore, As doe geue almes vnto the poore. It is rare vsed in each place, Ergo I wil omyt that case. Of fasting something Ile declare But let that goe it is so rare. Ile write of rich mens huge desire, The more they haue, more they require. But shal I talke of a blast of wynde? Then women Ile not leaue behinde. Of naughty packs Ile paynt the showe, That argument would ouerflowe. Of whordome then shal I deuise A volume large that would comprise. I wyll then flatter euery man, But many men that science can. Then wyl I lye, Ile cog and face, Nay that is vsed in euery place. Shall I tel trueth, it is too rawe, A blacke Swanne I neuer sawe. Oh Ioue what world is this to see? Amendment no way found may be. Omnium rerum vicissitudo. Warre bringeth pouertie, Pouertie bringeth peace. Peace bringeth riches, Riches bringeth pride, Pride bringeth warre. Warre bringeth pouerty, &amp;c. Whereas by martiall power and might, the Citie vanquisht stayes, And ouerrun by forraine foes denyeth such assayes. Then pouertie pursues with payne, and pyncheth euery wight. With greedie gripes to shewe his strength, and eke outragious spight, By pouertie each man is forst, to asswage his hautie heart, And hold himself content with peace all horror set apart. Then aye as authors witnesse doe, small things for to encrease, And grow ful great, as long as that each wight enioyes the peace. So that by peace it followes then a man may soone obtayne The sand of golden Pactolun, and eke the siluer vayne Then if a man enioyes the pelfe of riches pleasant molde, He fals in pride, th' unhappy clog, too high his head to holde. Wherby he spurns against such as his betters farre are borne: Then war pursues this peace again in former place to torne So doth this world flit alway, ne constant doth abyde, And fortune whirleth very strange, on rounded stoole to glide. Wherfore I deem ech toyling wight that traceth on the ball, Farre better aye had beene vnborne ne troubled there at all. The louer being demaunded wherefore he went alwaies in black attire, in c?men dati? of the same, made answere to his Lady on this wise, Sith that each man with brauery, in colours doth him dight, Such as, may please his mistresse eye, and answere her delight, Some choose the greene, the white some weare, some tawney light or sad: And some in yealow garnisht are, in purple some be clad. Some orient red, some watchet dye some one, some diuers take, And weare the same most curiouslie for their fayre mistresse sake. And wheras I doe serue and sue and seeke to haue the grace Of her that with her liuely hue staynes all that comes in place. To know a reason you request what thing I should desire That only I aboue the rest in blacke my selfe attire. The black and browne doe seldome change, they fixe their louely grace, When other colours light and strange, doe vade within short space. The yealow soone it waxeth pale, the russet keepes small stay: The tawny eke wil soone be stale, the purple wil decay. The white wil soyle, the greene wil stayne so wil the louing blew: The red wil change with litle payne, and take another hewe. And so the grace is shortly gone, their beuty soone decayes, But black is black, and alwayes one, and serues at all assayes. And so the heart that you doth serue what fortune so betide, From trueth profest wil neuer swerue but constant still abyde, Beside all this these colours light, doth nothing els declare, But what their fancy and delight doth will, the same they weare. As virgin white and wel beseene, the hopeful russet hewe, The pleasant yelow, youthfull greene, and eke the faithful blewe. Thangry red, the men forsake in tawney chuse their weede. And thus in colors they them shape as folly doth them leade. Of colors as is their attire, so fleeting is their minde They loue, they leaue, despise, desire, so fickle as the winde But sober black presents a mind, whom folly makes not fayne, Dame prud?ce there may fauor find and lodge with all her trayne. And as vnchanging is the hewe and eke vnmedled die, So constant is the heart and true that vnder it doeth lie. And thus for this I weare the blacke you may right wel beleeue And not for that I mourn, or lack but that which you may geeue. Oh were the happy houre at hand, come were that ioyfull day When you my faith wil vnderstand, and trueth vprightly way. And so release my paynfull sute, to lie possest in place, To reape the long desired fruite, and ioy the wished grace With colours then let them depart, whose fancy flits alwayes While I in black with stedfast heart doe serue you all my dayes. The louer hauing daunced with his Lady, in the end thereof speaketh these words. Madam, sith that you doe vouchsafe to daunce about with me I render harty thanks, and though, vnworthy now I be, To kisse your tender palme with mouth yet doe I naythelesse, Remaine your seruant stil in heart, and place of thrall possesse. The answere to the same. Good sir, whereas you say that you vnworthy are with me To daunce, your pleasure and your tongue doe both agree. You may say what you list, but this I knowe to be most true, No dame there is within this place, condigne to match with you. Much lesse am I that meanest am inferior to them all, A worthy dame t'aspire to you to daunce within this hal: Stoupe not so lowe to kisse my hand for if that you doe please, I am your owne what so betide your thraldome to release. And thinke that you haue gotten out and in this presence found A seruant true, as like that which dame fame did once resound Unto Penelope the faire which was Vlisses wife. What would you more, I am your owne, in heart whilest I haue life. Omne mundum positum est in malignitatem. Complayning I ne can refraine with measure iust my tongue, But he vnlose with mingled tunes, must make a dolefull song. And say as Tullie said, when he the Romans did accuse, O maners, o time, because that they all goodnes did refuse. There was not sith the world was a worser time than this In which the Lady Virtus doeth of presents alway misse. The assembly huge of Reprobates doth more and more encrease. And treadeth downe the simple soules, by their most heauy prease. Which when my mind did know, foorthwith by feare I dyd refrayne, This tale not meete yet for such as doe virgins pure remayne. The restlesse estate of a Louer, written to a fr?d of his, whrein he craueth to haue some good councel to ease his greefe. My frend, the care that I sustayne and life I leade at all, I send in paper here, as by these lines perceiue you shall. The sluggish bed and drowsie place I always doe detest Sith I therin with weary limmes enioy no quyet rest. Before that Phebus shewe his beams in morning I arise On field to fare then forth I passe, as is my common guise. Where of the lusty flowers greene, and yealow fresh of hewe, As by and ouer them I passe, I take the perfect vewe. Which colours two (though vading aye) I like and euer shall, For in the field while they remayne they passen colours all. Directly then vnto some hil, or mountaine fast me by, In beaten path I take my course, and way as it doth lie. Where long I scale with feeble legs my selfe vp for to get. By reason though of troubled heart I puffe and sometime swet. Yet stint I neuer till that I on highest place may stand And top therof, me round about, for to behold the land The sweling sea with surging waues also such foules as flie And euery thing that of the land, or ayer comes me by. The greene forrest which vnto me doth seeme most fayre of all, And euery fearefull beast thereof to you which I name shal. The mighty hart, his make the hind the buck and eke the doe. On side of hil there resteth, and the swift amazed Roe. The nimble long ear'd hare that swift before the hound gan run, The litle cracknut squirel erst on tree, that pretie bun: And furthermore I see by me, the wilie subtile foxe. The balstone or the grey doth chase and beate from clime rocks. Oh but at length I doe perceiue, as wished with the rest, A pallace pure of pleasure, and the place that likes me best. And as in ioy (by sight therof) in dumpe there stil I stay At length vnto my selfe these words, with warbling tongue I say. Within thy walles and chambers fayre a perfect place of blisse, My dearest frend, the wight that hath my heart, enclosed is. Where oft I wish my wretched corps in couert for to be, So that no wight my sodayne shape or presence knew but she. Transformed from my proper hew, and changed in such wise, As for our sureties both she could her selfe then best deuise. A pretie little hound on her with faithful heart to fowne, I stand content so that my minde, were present to her knowen. A chirping mouse in hole to creepe, in caue or hollow wall: When that in bed she thinks to rest, my louing noyce were small, A linnet in a wretched cage, before her for to sing With shrillish notes I would ne stay nor stent of warbuling. A Phillip Sparow on her fist or elswhere to be fed, At her owne hands twice euery day with chosen crums of bread. A little Robin that doeth hop about with reddish brest: Or els if Ioue would me conuert, a blacke flea in her nest. In faith with force ne could I finde or thinke once in my heart, The prety naked soule from out her sleepe once for to start. But that mine eyes at leysure might her seemely corps behold: Of God that rules the rounded ball, none other thing I would. Thus when my weary playnt and wishes all haue sayn: I hie me home, because the night, approched to my paine. Where I consume the day, vntil I see the mantled night: Which come on bed, for shew of rest. I spend vntil the light, And then my course to mountain hie againe I doe renew Of euery thing as yesterday, to take the perfect vewe Loe here my frend I send to you the patterne of my payne, I craue nothing but of your hands an answere sage againe. And as in pleasure you haue beene to me a faithfull frend, So likewise in distresse and greefe to shew your selfe so kinde. Some good aduice let me receiue of that thy gratefull hand, Wherby I may direct my path as surest for to stand. The while I wil attempt with lines and letters for to moue, The frozen heart of that good saint me to requite with loue. If tokens may ne boote, or that none other thing preuaile, Then wil I goe and yeelde my selfe what so ere doth me assaile, And present plead for grace, but now for once let this suffice. My Muse and I with slender quill, to endite wil now deuise. The Louer writeth to a Gentlewoman, by treatie to cause her to loue him, if he may possible. Madame, like as the drop that falles, vpon the marble stone, Doeth peerce the same thogh not with strength but with oft fall thereon. So now thogh that the sparke of fire be small within my brest, Yet euery day its like to be stil more and more increast. Unlesse that ye vouchsafe to giue to me the oyle of grace, For to preuent the same, before it take a roote and place. Therefore these lines which I here send, doe pray to haue a releefe, To flow from you, to him that is, your seruant during life. For sith that Cupide with his dart hath hit the marke that he Did shoote at with his blunted bolt, which stocke he made of me: And sith there is no creature that can rid me fro my greefe, But onely you, Oh Ladie myne, or cure my noyed life, I send you here with faithful minde, a present, though but small, Now take my hand, and eke my heart, yea take my life and all, To pleasure you if that ye list ne neuer to denie, Let me enioy the name and place, your siruant to supplie: Let this suffice till that I knowe the tenour of your minde, Whether ye list to giue long life or death vnto your freend. One of these two you may preuent, for both rest in your hande, If that you list Panthora milde, sith I in hope do stand: And as I doe perceiue the cause of ioy or else of greefe Ile say it doth proceede from you be it of death or life. Go passe to hir ye printed lynes, that doth possesse my heart, If that you cause me to receiue some comfort of my smart, I shall reioyce, but if ye giue to me a froward stile, I shall be prone, and with good will from life me to exile. By him that hath bin here before your owne, and so is nowe: And for to be your owne he hath yplight a faithful vowe. Here the Ladie writeth an aunswere to the letter of hir Louer, perseuering in hir stubburnesse: nothing ruing his faithfull heart. Your lines sir, that you sent to me but of late dayes, I haue perusde, as meete I thought to be for such assayes, And sith that you request to haue an answere ayne, I stand content to do so much, sith you in hope remayne, To put you out of hope, thinke not I am so fayne, To graunt so soone vnto your hest that were but folly plaine: Goe chuse and take your make some elswhere to be found. I am not one that wil so soone in any band be bound. And you to be as free, as erst you were before, Leaue of I pray you by my reade and trouble me no more. Yet say not naythelesse that I the causer stay And am the weauer of your woe, that were no likely way. Though that your pleasure were to forge such fayned stile And by the siluer hooke to catch the fish that feares no gile. The loue is very hot for which a man would kill Himselfe, I know it very well that is a painful ill. Though Pyramus that wight with sword did peerce his heart, For Thisbie, and she likewise did of like death take a part. They two are dead in deede, they two be layd in stone, We neuer shal finde out by sight, their like now they are gone. Now doubt I whether that the like loue flowe from you Therfore content your selfe y? while, I must needes say adue. By her that loues not aye, To spend her words in wast Wherfore she sends but few lines To thee, farewell in hast. The letter of a friend of a wounded Louer, wherein hee goeth about to disswade him from this louelie follie. My frend your parched letters are late hapned to my hand And them with eye I haue perusde, and euery sentence scande. Wherby I doe perceiue that you doe languish still in paine, And now according to request, I write to you againe. That I with dreary plaint accuse and wayle the haples hap Wherin blind Cupid Venus sonne did lately you entrap. But yet small remedie I find, if she so froward be As in your letters you report, and shewe the same to me. But that ye doe refraine from loue me thinketh that the wight That lerning hath might wel preu?t and stop such peeuish spight. Loue is not of such force &amp; strength, as farre as I can showe, But if it be by learning you better then I doe know. Then fixe your mind some elswhere aye, where you may reape the fruite For which you haue so toyled long by painfull suite. But if you cannot soone withdraw, from her your yelded hart And thereby to exile your selfe, from this your snared smart. Then wander hence away into some Countrey farther off, If you can aye forbeare a while this soyle to dwell aloofe, And there with troupe of chiualrie to exercise your selfe In feates of armes, thereby to shun, of loytring loue the elfe. Such facts wil cleane exile, &amp; driue from out your mazed minde These pranks, insomuch y? they shal no place hereafter finde. The Adage old doth shew vs plaine, and as I haue heard say, Long out of sight, clean out of mind, and I beleeue it aye. Then if that you attempt some way, and worke some wittie wile, By fauor of your frends to fare a litle in exile, And cut the calmed seas, the land to treade at th' other side You soon then wold leue of your loue which now in hart you hide. And if your heart doth not assent, in forrain fields to trace, Th? in some town within this realm you must finde out some place, For you that haue the store of welth, may leade your life as best To court it out with other braue, and royst among the rest. In Court great knowledge is, to which you may aspire, If that you list with zelous paine to applie your whole desire, And in the Court also you shall perceiue some condigne dame, That may extinguish clean the print and sparke of the other flame. In time to come perhaps also, I say you shall reioyce, And laugh to see this link, the which you left haue by my voyce. Perch?ce y? gods haue you preseru'd vntil some better end, Then may you ioy by right with me that standeth for your frend. But if you mind not aye to passe, into some other land: Nether to serue in princely Court, in Courtly roome to stand. Then fixe your earnest minde to aspire to knowledge hie By studie of the common lawes, a Councelor to supplie. And leaue such fondly toyes wherin you now doe frame And trace your steps, y? more to tred your present woe and paine. And giue the common law the fame, when each trade doth decay, The prouerb old as you know wel doth likewisy to vs say: No fishing to the sea there is, nor seruice to a king. No such game as the trade of lawe doeth to our coffers bring, The trade of Lawe doth fill to brinke from bottome boysterous bags They royst in silke, when other range the streete in rented rags. Now iudge your selfe which of the twaine doeth giue shewe best to be. With one of them I would that you in heart could aye agree. If that you like not aye the change of dames within the court: For Countrey prilles your youthfull life with them to lead in sport. Or if you more esteeme the sight of her that wayes not you: More then the gilt that Law doth get by learning to ensue. I know not what thing I shall say, but wayle the froward fate, Which vnto you the Gods haue graunt, to purchase peeuish hate. Thus now adue my frend, marke well these lines which I doe send, And sometime let me heare from you, how that you doe entend. The Louer writeth once more to his friend, as doeth followe after. The paines that you haue taken sir, an answere to indite, Unto my letter that I sent with thankes I here requite. Not able any other way by gifts to recompence the same. But with my pen a few lines in paper here to frame. Whereas you say I should refraine, and keepe my selfe from loue, That were too hard, sith loue it selfe hath forst the Gods aboue. What moued Iupiter to turne himselfe to take the shape And forme of Bull, but only loue, for dame Europas rape? And for because (my frend) you say loue is not of great strength, As farre as knowledge geueth you, it shall appeare at length Did not loues law enforce that Ioue to turne in Eagle strange, When that Asterion he could accept into his grange, He tooke on him the forme of swanne, as Leda when he had, Under his feathred wings and brest, in safetie for to shade. A Satyre strange, he forst him selfe, that Iupiter by name Saturnus sonne, to the intent he might Necteis clame, In forme of golden showre when that to Danae he could clyme In towre strong, for pleasure then with hir to ioy a time. Thus lose did he his former face, as loue did oft compell, Besides him other gods also, which all I can not tell. But if that Poets tales seeme true, then did Neptunus turne, And had the face of other beasts, a Ramme sometime to forme, Sometime a lustie horse to be, sometime a fish to play, As of a Dolphin take the hue as loue did beare the sway. And did not earst Apollo take the shape of Rauen blacke Sometime a shepheard in the fielde to bring his lust to sacke? No god was free, sith all the shape of chaunged formes gan take, Of beastes or birdes, and oftentimes of foule of fish of lake. Then say not that loue hath no force, the prouerbe thus doeth say, Amor vincit mundum, and then nothing so strong doth stay. And where as you do giue aduice me to withdrawe my minde, And fixe my heart some elsewhere, that I may some fauour finde. Alas can I withdrawe my thought, or els auert my heart From hir whose picture still I fynde within my brest impart: No no, or else and shall I graunt to wander in exile, And drudge about as one vnknowne, thus desolate the while: I can not aye endure that trade, and where agayne you say, I should me trie in feats of armes, and so driue loue away, For once from sight cleane out of mynde, prouerbially you speake, That is most true of such as would there vowed promise breake, My heart, aye giues me power inough in foraine lands to wende, And ouer surging seas to glyde t'arriue at the other ende. Yea if I had a thousand liues, I would them venter all For hir, if that at my returne reward for payne might fall. Or where to serue in princely court your hest doth me aduise, He that aduentures such affaires had neede be verie wise In court though that great dignitie be to be gotten aye, I haue no minde to such attempts for things that I shall say. In court at times to dice and carde, a man must venture oft, His winnings one time will be small, his losings come aloft, A man must not denie to play an hundred pound or twaine, If that he mynde to beare a name, though nothing else he gaine: And other exercises store, which when a man doth meete With such as stand more than his match his winning goes to fleete. The Court a fit place is in deede for such as know no ende Of wealth, and such as heape vp more than they may yerely spende. Such lustie laddes neede take no dread how that they lose or win, Their tenants toyle, they know not how their worldly wealth comes in. And some by parents wise haue nowe such order in their land And Bounds well set, that they ne neede about it fyle their hand. And where you thinke in court there is such store of damsels fayre, Though they were like the Muses nine, that stere aboue the ayre: Yet if that Enthinimias in court did aye remaine More beautie she should showe by sight, than any other twayne Though that she be a countrey prill, no weight thereof doth stand, Thinke you that some those Courtly dames are not of countrey land? Yea though that they haue changed place, and eke their wonted guise, Yet countrey Ladie they are still, as farre as I deuise. If that you knowe the contrary, suppose that if this dame, (Though stubborne she) were set in court, should she not beare the name To be a Courtier eke most fit? small is the difference Nowe put off you, if that ye lift to giue intelligence. And also of your other choyce, I like much as the rest, The studie of the common lawes I ne account as best: To bend my mynde vnto that side, I thinke it follie playne, The way is long and tedious, so much more is his paine That trieth it, and if such store of gold be got thereby, I wish some frend that hath no welth his minde thereto apply: But as for me, I thanke the Gods that blessed me such wise, I greatly ne (as Prouerbes say) do neede to rub mine eyes. And this I know for certaintie, that he which linkes in loue, To earnest studie any tome his minde can neuer moue. None of your choices three I like but pensiue do remaine. My sorow groweth more and more I feele the worser paine. And where you raise request to kno how that I do entend The copy of my letter aye, and hers before I send. Therby you may perceiue and see how small she doth esteeme, The cankred care wherby I crie, and stand at very brimme, Of Stigian lake, yet do I mind, ere many daies be past, T'assay againe, for many men say Loue comes not in hast. Yet will I pause a while, and think on evrie poynt, At length when I perceiue my time Ile venter out a ioynt. And then renue my painful sute, which now doth stand begun It wil be long ere that I ende the feeble fooles are wun, With litle care as I haue learnd thus fare you wel from T. Where oft to giue me councel good I wish you for to be. The lamentation of a louer beeing refused, shewing no hellish torments to be lyke his, wherwith he accuseth his Ladies crueltie, &amp; yet at l?gth praieth to haue releefe. Come on thou hart y? long hast slept in woe, Reuiue thy selfe thy haples hap to shew, Yee sences all closde vp with couert care, Unlose your selues my sorowes to declare: Thou tongue that tyed art by string of paine Be prest to shew the woe where I remaine, Thou hand y? long hast staid stretch out at last, To shew the present greefe and sorowes past, Of him that dying liues and wisheth death, Thogh dead in hart yet alway draweth breath A thousand times for woe who stil doeth crie, And wisheth death each day and cannot die. Though Ixion nayled on the whirling wheele, Which hellish stubs &amp; irksom pains doth feele, Though Tantalus amyd the lake therein Pursues y? waues which wet &amp; wash his chin, And when to him deceiude it promise makes Th? fleets y? flood, his dryth and thirst ne slakes Thogh y? the tree with aureal fruit doth stand By him, and when he reacheth out his hand Th? flies y? stock on which the fruit doth grow So bides he paine, and feeles excessiue woe. Though Titus heart did lie a perfect pray To flying foules, this payne he bides alway, Though Danaus daughters fyll in vayne The watry vessels, and in toyle remayne, Yet none of these for greefe may ay compare With me, for Clio may not yet declare Ne paynt eche parched paine, wherby I pyne, Though she had all the helpe of Muses nyne, Or else expresse with slender quill in hand, That eche wight might it fully vnderstand. Such dangrous dread doth double in my brest For hir, who reweth not this my vnrest: Ah frosen heart, ah wight of marble moulde, Ah fem as fierce as Tygre to beholde, Oh wolfe of visage fell, who wouldest deuoure Ech simple lamb, that ioyes but slender powre, Thee to the noble Lyon to compare, Were folly plaine, sith he this vertue rare Enioyes, who neuer doth delight, with force To teare the sely beast y? yeldeth to his might, But then as victor to returne away, And somewhere else to seeke a condigne pray. But thou whose mouth delighteth stil to feade, Art not content my corps on ground to tread, But ay to rent and teare my giltlesse hart In peeces small by this my woe and smart. If that thy pleasure be to feede on me, So say, ile pull my heart to giue it thee, Thereby for to asswage thy hot desire, Thereby of life to extinguish out the fire. What wouldst thou more to do thy bodie good? I would on dagger fall to spill my blood, Or else with lancing kniues to cut my flesh, To make thereof for thee a daintie dish. Then grant and yeeld to this my one request, I wish no more to breed my quiet rest. When Cupid shot at me first with his dart, And by the blow did peerce my tender hart, I knew no salue to cure my sore againe, But thereby did remaine pensiue for paine, Till Amor now by sleight the meane did find, To rid the same if thou ne grow vnkind. Rue then thou frozen hart and stomacke dire, With friendlie woords grant now y? I require. Let me inioy soone, eke the place possesse Thy selfe, and thereby my wo redresse, So me for to requite with loue againe, Sith I in hart thine owne shal still remaine, Till sisters three shall rid my vitall twine, Thy loue let me haue aie, for thou hast mine. Grant this ye gods that glide on starrie skie, And guide that Chaos ball most equally, What ioy were this to me that am a thrall, If thou thy mate wouldst me once frendly call. Sith I so oft haue trauaile spent in wast, To reape the wished frute now at the last. The Louer hauing written manye times, almost past hope, yet doeth renew his playnt againe. Although that here before my deere I written haue in wast: And sent my lines to thee in vaine expressing sorowes past. Yet hope doth hag me to encline with pen once for to paynt The staggering staffe wherby I stay and shew to thee my playnt. And thogh that yet thou alwais haue been ruler of my care Yet now at length a gentle wight doe thou thy selfe declare. If any sparke of mercy stay now flaming in thy brest Then say the word that profit may, and bring me wished rest. Let not the guiltles ghost geue vp the cynders to the soyle But let your mercy be an ayde to helpe him geue the foyle. To hatefull hap, let not my corps to Charon dreery be, By passage ouer Stigian lake, a burthen aye to see. Let not the wight that now enioyes halfe yeeres to runne his race So soone depart from terra green, in Tartar to haue place. Sith you may giue hun light y? now in darkenes doth remaine, Sith you may giue him Freedome y? in thraldome stayes for payne. Thinke on the faithful hart of him that sayd thee so: Thinke on the meaning true of hym that wandreth stil in woe. Think earst on him that doth not ay esteeme his borowed life: To pleasure you if you vouchsafe to remedy his greefe. And now sith that you vnderstand, the secrets of my mind Let this suffice I say, vntil an answere be assignde. And though that many sundry times I trauayled in wast: I waigh it not so that I may haue mercy at the last. By him that staies in hart your owne, as long as life doth last And if that loue be after life, your owne when life is past. The louer being denied, yet singeth this song, being constant, with hope to obteine hir at the last that may reward him for his paine. Though surging seas do compasse me, Of carking cares on euery side, Yet trust I once to range most free, And to the ioyfull valley glide, And eke the wight for to obtaine, That may release me from my payne. Though she sayes nay to my request, And doth deny my true desire, Disdayning aye to breed my rest, Whereby I freeze amid the fire, Yet trust I once for to auart Thus stubborne sternnesse from her hart. My lady cals it follie plaine, With toong such hardned knot to knit, As all the teeth with helpe of braine, Shall ne be able to vnclit, She wrappeth wily wit so sure, It to obtayne its very dure. She doubts least that I meane awry, She feareth least my hart be fraile. She thinks I loue not faithfully, But outwardlie hir to assaile, She thinketh aye my toong to flee In words, with hart ne to agree. Oh that Cassandras gift were plaine, And woorthy skill for her to gesse, If that I list in hart to faine, Contrary to that I professe, Then should be seene the great good will, I beare to her, and shall do still. Yet I ne blame that silly wight, Though circumspect alway she be, Unfaithful loue hath brought much spight, The proofe whereof we dayly see, By such as thinke contrary aye, In hart to that which toong doth say. Yet I am none of those I vow, I loue hir truly in my hart, As is my thought the same I show, In outward words with wo and smart, Wherefore these words I say certayne, That iustly I should her obtayne. Though long it be ere I arriue The ioyfull hauen to possesse, Though long I wretch doe weare the giue And carefull clog of heauinesse, Yet hope I ouce to see that day To haue my loue and none say nay. The Ladie by often intreatie being vanquished with loue, doth write a comfortable letter to her Louer. Desist my Philo frend, to plunge or welter still in paine, Where flowing aye the noysome waues, of woe alwayes remaine. Leaue off to waile or mourne for that which thou didst deepe desire. Sith I am prest with zelous care, to extinguish out the fire, And the vnwasting coale that lyes, now hid within thy brest, In couert wise, and by my meanes to bring thee cause of rest. Desist with pen to paint the paine, which compast thee ech side, Or dolefull tunes to shewe the greefe, in which thou didst abide. Leaue off that blacke attire, wherein thou vsest for to goe, A perfect hewe (as some report) and signe of wicked woe, And fall to mirth, to ioy with her, that comes to ease thy smart. Thy earnest suite hath found a place to lighten on my hart. Though once restraynd by force I fled and thereto would not bowe, For reasons rough, this one among the rest I doe allowe In bookes I readen haue ful oft, and others many a time: Of maydes deceiued by wyly wyghts and led in loathed crime. For Sathan meaneth most deceit, when Angels shape he takes, The fish is trapped soonest with, the siluer hooke in lakes. I doubted aye the like, vntil, that I enioyde the gift, Which once Cassandra held, that had beene aye a present shift. For to discerne and know thereby the secrets of thy mind If that I should thee faithfull, or a playne dissembler find. For this you know as wel as I this is the greatest care Of maydes, how they bestow themselues. in louely bands to fare. And how they knit themselues in league. though loue be very strong: And not for pleasure small to sing alway a mournfull song. But sith that I by proofe perceiue thy meaning true to be, And without fraud I stand content herein to pleasure thee: Then aye persist in stedfast faith for euer to endure. And me in heart to be thine owne, to finde thou shalt be sure. Now fare thou wel my only care, my stedfast staffe of ioy: The only comfort of my life, whom Ioue keepe from annoy. By her that loues thee aye, more better than her hart: If then consent to yeeld thereto, till death shall aye depart. The ioyfull louer hauing by earnest sute obtained her whom he loued, made this dittie following. Come on ye louers that long haue rest in wo, Leaue off your sobs so tearing, And helpe my ioyfull hap to shew A face of laughter bearing: Come on all ye I say agayne, Your Ladyes fauour which obtayne, And let vs all sing. For wee haue past the greatest ieopardy that might Haue wrought vs any wo or greefe Nowe we arriue the hauen cheefe And passe the sea of spyght. Though Cupides arow piercde my t?der hart And brought to me such payning, Yet now exiled is my smart, My deare I thus obtayning, I ioy with hyr that ioyes with me, I loue no wight so well as she, For like this ioy knew I neuer non before that day In which these words were to me showne Come on my deare, thou art myne owne, I will thee loue alway. What words of c?fort were these now thinke you all To bring such libertie to me, When I had liued long in thrall, At last that day set to see, I ne remember now my woe, Which me compassed long agoe, Therefore let vs sing. For I am recompenced wel for this my payne, I haue the wight that I loue best, Hir words do bryng to me such rest, I wish none other gayne. Ye Gods y? rule the rounded ball grant this to me I aske vnfaynedly, If I loue hyr with faythfull mynde, As I loue hyr, let hyr loue me, And not the contrary, Let hyr ne growe in heart vnkynd, And then may I sing, And purpose truely to loue hyr alwayes in my heart What euer hap shall aye befall, Yea though I lose my life and all, Till death vs two depart. Tempus rerum edax. Nothyng there is but aye, at length doth vanish cleane, For tyme doth weare away, such things as earthly bene. The Rose for all his hue, the skarlet Gillowfloure, The Uyolet so blewe, doe vanish in one houre. The tree that groweth bigge, and windeth euery way, Doth once rot euery twigge, when time sayes nowe, decay. The wight that here is borne, at last doth lose his breath, Though many wayes he turne, and would not meete with death. The marble stone most sure, that lyeth: vnder feete, Can not alwayes endure, but goeth once to fleete. The king that sits in throne, with golden mace in hand, At length shall be as none, but earth on him to stand. The house wherein we trust. though hard as flint it be, At length shall weare to dust, a heape of stones to see, The castel set on hie, on hill that standeth stout, Its seene that time doth trye, and beat the sollage out. The church that coured is with lasting lead aboue, At length time doth ne misse, his beautie to remoue, A doore of brasse strong made of yron or such like, Time causeth once to glad, and with decay it strike. The rock that standeth strong, amyd the foaming flud, Though that it lasteth long time beateth it to mud. The sea bankes that are hie, and seene from land to land, Time wasteth vtterlie, aye farther for to stand. The Gun that by his strength can turrets ouerthrowe, Time doeth consume at length his power and might to shewe. The hil that stretcheth long, and casteth out his side, As time doeth come more strong, then he in fall doeth glide. The starres that in the skie, most thick set doe remaine, Doe fade immediatlie, when time doth come with main. The sunne that shines so bright, shall lose his comely grace, And shewe no sparke of light, as time doeth take his place. The moone that wandreth fast, and shineth on the land, Must needes decay at last when timely power is scande The world of compasse round, in fashion of a ball, At length shall not be found when time consumes it all. Nothing there resteth stil but consumes by and by, When time doeth shew his will then vades the earth and skie. The Louer being willed of his Ladie to attire himselfe in blacke and blewe, demaunded the reason, to whome she made this answere folowing by a letter. Because that you (my deare) request to know herein my will: Wherefore that you in blacke and blewe, should aye attire you stil. The black is said by right report, most constant to remaine: And ne to change that colour sad, for any other graine. The blewe presents the wearers minde and eke a louing hart: Be tokening louely lyking still, not soone aye to depart. Then ioyne these two in one, and if thy rayment touch the blacke, I mixt with blewe a lace or like my loue ne let it lacke. For as the blacke presents a face of faythfull trust to stay, So doth the blewe aye represent, a louing heart alway. And for a token of true loue, my ioy I send to thee Enclosed here those colours two, weare thou the same for me, Wherein is tyde a slight present, in recompence of thyne, A tablet wrought, I giue it thee, it is no longer myne: As often as you weare the same, for my sake and for me, Then wish me well, for be thou sure, I wish the lyke to thee. The Louer writeth to his Ladie, wherein he condiscendeth to weare the colours that she willeth him for hir sake. In colours two sith you request I should my selfe attyre, As blacke and blew, I stand content to answere your desire, For where as black presents a mind whom folly makes not fayne, A colour fit it is for me, changing for none other grayne. If blewe a louing minde present, and eke a faithfull hart, It is for me that ne doth minde, from constant loue to start. But by the gift that you me sent, I can not recompence Inough, though daily I apply thereto my full prsence. Yet though I haue no gift to giue, that worthy is of thee. In place of other yet let this suffice now sent from me: And though it be a gift but light, or recompence but small, I giue my hand, I plight my faith, I send my hart and all. That keepe vntill I do repayre to thee, though it belong, My selfe to ioy in armes of loue, and sing a ioyfull song. Farewell my ioy, farewell my life, farewell my hart to thee, Farewell thou wight to whom I wish more good then erst to me. To him that was disappointed of his woman and louer. To freat thy selfe in frantike wise, to beate thy senslesse brayne, To clyme where nothyng hangs for thee, to fish where flowes no gayne, Me thinkes it booteth not at all: desist with speede therefore The enterprise thou hast in hand: this saw hath bin of yore, That hard it is for to conuert a womans vowed mynde, Such sterne and stubborne kynde of God to them is so assignde. Hir loue not bent is towards thee, whom thou dost fix in hart, An other doth with ioy possesse the wight that breedes thy smart. Yet for to ease thy mynde, here is enclosde I sende to thee In token of beneuolence, a wreath of willow tree. The louer writeth in the praise of his Ladie wherein he doth compare hir to a Laurel tree that is alwaies greene. Like as the Bay y? bears on branches sweet The Laurel leaf that lasteth alway greene To change his hue for weather dry or weet, Or else to lose his leafe is seldome seene. So doth my deare for aye continue still, As faythfull as the louing Turtle doue, Rewarding me according to my will, With faithfull hart for my most trustie loue, And sith the time that we our loue began, Most trustie she, yet hath endured aye, And changeth not for any other man. So constant she of fayth in heart doth stay. Wherefore vnto that tree I hir compare, That neuer loseth leafe, no more doth she Lose tried trueth, how euer that she fare, But alwayes one by loue in hart to me. Th? bost I on this br?ch of Bayes most pure, Sith that so sweete I finde it at my hart, And loue while that my life shall aye endure, And till that death our bodyes two shall part. The pretie birth of a childe. It fortund late a Frenchman for to dwell In England, where himselfe he quited well. And tooke an Ihishwoman to his wife, Hauing by her a childe of perfect life: Now if this child beginning shall retaine Of fathers side, a Frenchman he is plaine, But contrary, if of the mother he Shall take the spring, he Irish is to see, But some say, that he shalbe of the land Where he was borne, th? english shal he stand. The wordes of a dame concerning her Louer, spoken to one Mistresse Anne. In fayth goo mistresse Anne I haue found out a make in deede. A proper man, and tall, and one that seemes wil stand in steede. I loue hym wel, more then I say, I wish to him hys good, I loue him like mine owne deere heart or els my vytall blood. For this you know that I ne loue my blood once for to see, No more I doe delight that he within my sight should be. In praise of his Ladie. E Elisa dame that Carthage Queene, N Ne Polixena faire beseene, T T'aspire vnto my Ladies hewe, H Helena ne with all the crewe, I In passing sort may not compare, N Nor vaunt them selues for beutie rare.

I In Greece though Apelles did frame, A A picture cleere of Venus dame, S Sertaine she doth the same excel Of whome these lines the name doe tel. Of foure kindes of men that maie sing at didner, and other meate meales. The Gentleman that hath the store of worldly wealth, may sing At meales of meate, for pleasure great that pleasant songs may bring. And next by order check, the foole that ioyes none other graine, May sing and garre as doth the birde against a shower of raine. The Minstrel then that fidleth fine at feeding times may play, And sing to heape into his pursse the coyne by night or day, But cheefe, though last, the old cocke may or cockold ne be dull To crow and sing fond fantasies, to hag from horned scull. Of couetousnes and Lecherie together. A pursse full fraught with gold, as worldly misers frame, Had one at codpice point, who tyed with niggish knot the same: Thus were these two together knit, and ioynde in amitie, A pursse with pelfe of couetise, at lace of lecherie. A perfect tricke to kill little blacke flees in ones chamber. Take halfe a quart of barly graine a quart of strongest beere. And boyle withall in earthen pot, a pint of water cleere, Till all these three consumed be to ounces twelue or lesse, And then the place to which you will these fleas in heaps to presse, Anoynt with that: this water hath in it this vertue raw That all the fleas will thither come: then take a slender strawe, And tickle them on the small ribs, and when you see one gape, Thrust th? the straw into his mouth. and death he ne shall scape. Each thing in his vocation. The preests ensearch for funerals, and flatterers haunt the feast, The surgions seeke the maimed, and the Rauens carreyne creast. The frailenesse of women. An apple winnes hir mynde, it lost is with a nut: Hir toung hangs filed with no edge, yet it will quickly cut. To his friend of the frailenesse of dame Fortune. VVh? fortune doth most smilingly aduance Those sonest doth she cast vnto y? ground Unequall hap she holdeth still by chaunce, For to extoll, or else defame by sound. I reade somewhat of Polycrates ill, Who neuer felt the fel aduersitie, Yet dreading lest she once would work her wil, Into the sea did throw (to satisfie Her brittle minde) a ring of value great, Yet fortune thoght to shew hir power &amp; might And forst a fish with gulching iawes to eate The same: which geuen to the king, by sight The ring appeerde: with maruel he at last Was captiue tane of great Orontes king, And strangling string about his neck ycast, Was forst adieu vnto his life to sing. Learne thou by this I say my gentle frend, That riches ranke, ne yet the precious stone Can once deferre this fortune so vnkind, For if it might this king had not been gone, And for because that thou art set so hie, And placed stayest in seate of this degree Unwilling aye to lose authoritie, I cannot chuse but now aduertise thee To train thy selfe in such wise thou maist haue (If fortune fraile should hap to slip from thee) Ech mans good wil, wherby he might thee saue Fr? dangers dread, which y? might haply see, For now a thing not rare it is in deede, That where we wey our footesteps best to be With slippery place then soonest doe we slide Therefore marke wel that I haue said to thee. The morning before the Louer went to his Ladie, made this petition to the Gods. Golde is a signe men say of happy lucke and loue, Then graunt ye Gods I pray that rule the skie aboue, This my request to me, that sith that I this night Did dreame such gold to see as answerd my delight, That I may heare such newes, of her that hath my heart, Like as ioy stil insues to rid me from my smart. And Venus Goddes milde, to whom the apple gaue Young Paris Prince a child a noble dame to haue Graunt that I may by suite, haue her I doe request: And I wil geue the fruite, to thee before the rest. The foolishnes of a painter. Repairing to a Painters place to view such pictures rare As he with pensil fine had framde the fame away to beare. Me thought I sawe such pictures there, of beauties darlings braue, As dyd surpasse, and condigne were the onely brute to haue. Whereby it seemde he far had sought, by sea and eke by land, Eche passing part of womanhood, with eye had rightly skand. At length his wife discending downe, a passing peece in deede, Me thought I neuer saw hir like, attyrde in womans weede. Who there dyd draw myne eyes to hir, from pictures cleane away, By whom was playne dame beuty then hir banner did display. And vewing there eche perfect poynt which nature dyd apply, That sely soule in couert wise, I speake thus by and by: Thou paynter that with curious eyes hast seene ech courtly dame, In mynde thereby by sight of such a picture rare to frame, What dydst thou meane to seeke so farre, and hast at home a wife, For beuty which knowes not hir peere with woman which are cheefe, Thou foole, if that thou list in deede. with pensell to detrayne A picture that all other shews of pictures aye should stayne, Or if thou meanst to frame a shew of beauty catcht in net, And such one as the gaole thereby thy selfe thou erst might get, Then forge the picture of thy wife, and trauaile not for payne, Sith she the cheefe of beauties stocke, among vs doth remayne. The grieuous complaint of him that had the hap to marie his mistresse. When youthfull yeres did prick me forth in stature for to growe A tall yong man, and towardnes, (to call) by sight to shew, I did request in heart to be a seruing man a space, Whereto my freends dyd condiscend, and wished me their grace. A master meete my parents chose, as best they thought in minde, That should in seruice me retayne, sith I thereto was clynd, A gentleman of antike stocke by alliance very good, By pedigree and iust discent he came of gentle blood: And striken deep in yeres, this wight a wife he had before, A passing dame, a pleasant wench, of beutie which had store. They did continue many yeres, in vertues wayes most pure With faithful loue and amitie, and frendships lore most sure. In so much that there was cause gin to neighbors round them by, To blaze this bruite in euery place, by fame both farre and nie, Happy to be that aged soule, and luckie for to stand, That had by Gods appointed him a wife to lead in hand, That aye dame beuties baner braue displaied in such wise Withall, for vertue in no place her like might once arise: Wel, to ensue, dame Atropos can shread his web in twaine, Leauing no issue him behind as his heire to remaine. Whereby the right of land and lease of siluer and of golde, Descended solely vnto her, for euer it to holde. Then was this widow often sought, in mariage league to wend, But she refusing offers large, to none would condiscend, Then I remembring many times her vertues manifold, The seemely port, the comely grace which she by sight did hold But cheefly aye the worldly wealth and riches pleasant store, That by her husband was her left surrounding aye the flore. Was moued much by Cupid blinde for to attempt with maine, If that I might this passing wight by any meanes obtaine. And being daily conuersant I wrought the matter so, That in short time my hearts desire I obtainde so my woe. The mariage made, most ioyfull I in heart did aye remaine I neuer knewe what sorrow meant ne felt what thing was paine. Ah pleasantly we dyd consume two moneths and no more, In pleasant wyse then dyd I thinke, to sue to get some store, Of gold if that I myght, I knew she had the same, And fruitful bagges, but in no wise, I could one crowne reclayme: And as request was made of me, this answere by and by, Was gin of hir in crooked wyse, and aye most frowardly, Good sir, I wedded not for that, aduauncement ne you gaue To the intent that any store of myne you should thus craue, And thinke to be your owne, but this much I do to you say, If that you stand to my reward, your labor ile repay: And what I giue you take, myne offer ne refuse, I was your mistresse tyll I gaue, you licence me to vse. Such as is yours is myne, and myne is sure myne owne: Then none ye haue, ne none ye get, vnlesse frendship be showne. But I with rage and choler mooued, ne could my selfe refrayne, To me it was a present death, and earst a piercyng payne, That I shoulde be a womans thrall, that I should be a slaue, That I in place of husband, should none of her substance haue. It mooued me in deed, so that though cleane agaynst my vow, I was constraynd by fury fell some blowes for to bestow, But out alas, her freends forthwith gan giue her freendly ayde, Wherby I troden downe to ground in mynd was aye dismayde: And she puft vp by passyng pryde, her head was growne so hye Aboue my pate, that able she was it with nayles to clye, With pot, with candlesticke, and eke with bedstaffe of huge weight, Both stoole and forme flang at my face, with care thus I was freyght. On euery fide, oh miser most: oh caytyfe borne to payne, Oh diuels drudge, oh frantike foole, that marry wouldst for gayne: When I in stable serude the horsse, Then was I wearier aye, On bench with clownes whole peny vp, at treygobet to play Than I am now beside all this, and which doth greeue me more, Of hornes by hir vile whoredome strong, accrueth to me store. No remedy I finde the while, for still before my face, Roysters, ruffins, she retaynes in bed, my rightfull place. Wherefore a thousand tymes I wayle my state and mysery, A thousand tymes I call for death, yet naythelesse can dye: I shall liue longer than I would, in thrall with mickle shame, Oh God what hap had I, when first I wedded home my dame. The Louer by pleasant talke caused a Ladie to vnderstand how a shrew or vnhappie woman came first into the world. Let no man muse but this was first the ofspring of a shrowe, As I in lynes here subsequent, shall cause you for to know. When as for sinne the thunderer loue dyd the earth surround, And ouerwhelmed aye with waues, eche part of heauy ground: Deucalion onely saued was, and Pirrha then his wife, (As Poets say) of mortals and he longest ioyed life. And wh? perceiuerance did him take that euery wyght was gone, And that they two and no more on earth were left alone, Then pensiuely they tooke aduice to Themis for to wend, To wete how mankind might again his former life entend. This Goddesse can reply them to, with answere on this wise, If that Deucalion could find out by sight of greedy eyes, His mothers bones, and him behind they throwen for to be, Within short tyme they should start vp men lyuing for to be, This maruell much dismaide the mynds of these two seely wights, As though that they dyd fearefull stand, by sight of hellish sprights: But this Deucalion beyng wyse, perceyued at the last, The earth mother to be of all things that are nowe and past: And erst to be the spring wherehence all mortals first did flowe. By reason then of earth he was (by wit) he prompt dyd knowe, And aye her bowels for to be the sandy crushing stones: The marble and such like also, appoynted her for bones. Wherefore he threwe behynde himselfe these stones of manifold, Which to be men immediatly (amasde he gan behold.) Of these came all the men that nowe are liuyng vnder skye: And Pirrha mylde to play her part behynd her by and by, Gan throw as many stones as this Deucalion threw before, Which streight became a troupe of dames: of both kindes there were store. The reason now I guesse how that such shrewes in earth abound, In euery place among the men, a number to be found, Is this, the sea replet with salt, dyd beate agaynst the land, And many stones within the same of saltish tast dyd stand, Then to ensue, when all the earth with sea was ouerrune, There was no land but water all to be seene vnder Sunne. Decreasing yet it left such stones, remayning on the land As saltish were, a number sure: perhaps to Pirrhas hand Came one of those, and made a fem: the salt must freat alway, Within that wight which first was made of salted stone or clay, Whereby to choler it prouokes and her in rage to fall In frantike wise: a shrewe to be such one we alway call. For such was Morrell slayne, and layde in saltish bryne, For saltish shrewes his skyn was flayne such shrewes in it to shryne. Of faithfull friendship. VVhen worldly wealth doth vade &amp; decay, And erthly riches to erth do turn againe Yet freendship most stedfast and sure for aye, Hap what hap may doth styll remayne. May any man find the lyke of Carion And Menalip companions aye, Who to the death were friends? no not one, Who kept this frendship most stedfest in stay, There are freends dead, and of sorts twayne, By prouing a man may finde it true, The one in countnance all for gaine, The others words dead to ensue. Some men remember Pylades, A faithfull man, a trusty wyght, Oh sacred freend vnto Orestes, Oh sparkling starre to giue vs light: They all are gone and layd in graue, Once we had Pilades, and once Orestes, But them againe or like, we none shall haue, Ne haue not nowe, to trace their progresse: Menalip is gone, and Carion, The sacred soules hath rapt them aye, Their facts haue we as yet to looke vpon, Such kept the flowre of freendship in stay. What daunger insueth if a man enterprise a higher place then his degree can aspire vnto. By fortune came a countrey clowne to London, for to see, And roming vp and downe the streetes as best he thought to be, Went to the court a place vnmeete for such a carter playne, The same tyme where for princes sport great pastime to ordayne Men went about: the nyght drew on, and Luna with hir hornes, The azure skie and element with sparkling starres adornes. And he thus learned of the boyes or lackeys of the courte, Such passing pleasure for to be, and eke such princely sport, Dyd mynde (if that he myght) to get and wryng into the hall To take the vewe, this boyish clowne dyd nothing aye appall, Though with the sight of nobles store his doltish eyes were fed, But loppreth to the vpper end, his cap vpon his head. One of the wayters seeing this, him by the arme can hold, And sayd sirrha, to come so nygh how darest thou be bolde? Come on, if that thou list to viewe and see some pleasant sight, Goe get thee out into the streete and stare on the moone lyght. But he with strugglyng gan refuse, and very long resist, Till at the length his eare dyd fetch somewhat at porters fist. (I know not what it was) but he with anger chafed much, Dyd thinke if he were at the doore to recompence this tuch, So that in deede (that place attayne) vnwares to any wight, He gaue the porter another blow, with all his power and might. The fellowes seeing this, gan run on heapes vnto the doore, And for one blow they dyd him gyue whole twenty, yea and more, In so much that the foolish sot was forst almost to cry, When as he felt a weighty fist to hit him on the eye. They layd on load, but at the last he escaped from the doore, Thinking aye to go so far, he venture would no more, But to beware by this, sith that so foolishly he would. Nowe venture in a place to high for his decree so cold. This chaunce doth often hap to such as boldly do aspire To highest top as they are led by foolish fond desire: Its often seene, that they which sit at meat at the vpper end, Are often placed all belowe, and lowest thither send. Let euery man him hold content, and aye well pleased be, In ech poynt, with such haps as are most meete for his degree. Of parents deformed hauing a beutifull childe. Doubling doubts &amp; musings much I stande To see dame natures fact, by skilfull hand, I muse how that the tree that beares by kynde, The red hawe, should to chestnuts be inclynde: I muse how that y? tree should change that sute For grapes most pure his cat sloes soure frute This change seems somwhat strange in deed to me Such kindly gripes vnkindly for to be. I muse how that dame nature could with skill, And learning large of high Pernassus hill, Frame such a peece on earth here for to stray Of parents as were made of clodded clay. I muse how that erst such a froward syr With drowsie wife, whose loue is to the fire, Should get a daughter damsell faire &amp; bright, For to display dame beauties banner bryght. This fact departs by fame the onely deed, Of thundring Ioue, y? giues y? good their meed To rest with him, and paies the ill their hire. For to descend to hell and flaming fire. Of him that tooke a quart of wine when it was proffered by his freend, who minded to get a pottell. One newly come to towne, of freends a number he gan meete, Aboue the rest, by freendly talke one cheefly thus him greete, Unto your welcome sir I haue, some where a quart of wine, Which willingly I would bestow on you this present tyme. Mary (quoth the other) gladly your gentle gift I take, The quart of wine I meane not nowe with nay thus to forsake. Nay quoth the other streight, you ought for to haue offred me, A pottell more for to requite my gift offred to thee: For curtesie doth will when that one offreth thee a quart, Thou shouldst him giue the like or more, to shew thy gentle heart. Beshrew me then (quoth the stranger) for ere thou drinkst of mine, I will be sure before hand aye, to haue a taste of thine. For many men most mindfully, do often offer make, Such things as they ne willingly, would any time forsake. But for a skill to get the like vnder colour and face Of curtesie where crabbed clawes deceitfully do trace, So nowe this quart of wine is offred aye of thee, To the intent that thou mightst get a pottell more of me. To hir the Louer writeth, being familiarlie acquainted, refused in presence to speake to him. Sith that thy fauour once I helde and ioyed part thy grace, What was the cause, that this disdayne should vrge himselfe a place In thee? at home I knowe, and eke remember well: Full louing tales and stories there I often could thee tell, And for reward I could receyue of thee a kisse or twayne, As iustly aye deserude of me: in recompense of payne. I then was bold to go with thee, in chambers low and hie, And in mine armes on bed of downe haue thee thereon to lye, Though I restrayned by forced feare would neuer enterpryse To taste of Venus sports, as things ne to be seene with eyes. Where as perhaps (as well appeard) you willyng were thereto, But that a doubt came in the wynde that forst a freend a foe. This token you remember well, if that you list to yeeld. She tooke a blow below the eare, at Mooregate by the field. To play at cardes and tables both, to driue the tyme away, And other games you coulde deuise, as time serude day by day. An hundred toyes were to be found, that might vs merrie make, Then had the Moone cleane lost hyr forme, and was ne like a cake, I was thy darling then, also I dyd possesse thy hart: Eche word that stubbornly was cast dyd cause eche other smart. Why now, what is the cause me tell, that this so vile disdayne, Should thee enforce ne to regarde him that for thee bydes payne? What was the cause that when you met me with your fellowes mo, And troupe of dames in open streete, you would so slyly go. And looke awry as though not meete I were to see your face? (Such freends as we are aye before) this was a chaunged case. But go thy way, to choose thy feere, euen where it likes thee best, Ile trouble thee from hence no more, ne thee disturbe of rest. But as long as by sight I know, a woman from a sheepe, For thy sake I will then beware, and looke before I leape. Of Vnthrifts. Those men whose mindes are wolly bent and set on pleasure vayne, Do take no care to get the thrift, that brings incessant gayne. Of Whoredome. As aye amongst th'vntamed beastes that range amid the wood, There is no greater rauenor than the Wolfe of cruell moode. And as the Puttoke doth surpasse eche winged foule perdy, By egernesse to skirre hir pray, once seene with greedy eye: So aye excelles this monstrous vice of whoredome by hir kinde, Eche other vice stupendious by Sathan left behinde. Like will to like. Euen as good men reioyce alway With good men for to be, In companie to ioy with them: so like it is to see, Ill men reioyce with like to haue their companie alwaies: The good with like, the ill with ill, do ioyne in all assayes. Of vnwittie spending. Me think such wights, small wit in head retaine, Which do consume &amp; spend that worldly gaine Which they haue got with swet of browe and payne no cause therefore: Such treasure th? as they for long haue soght In litle tyme for to consume to nought, Such spendyng ay not taking any thought, makes rich men poore. Perit quicquid feceris ingrato. Amongst such deeds, as when that they are done Inforce a man for to repent therefore, This one thing cheefe remaines for ech to shun, Though there abo?d by knowlege many more, What euer thing thou doest with zelous mind, T'a churlish wight y? adage shewes such sense, Its lost: he will not leaue his doggish kinde, Ne neuer meane the same to recompence. The propertie of Reprobates. By kinde they that are lewde in deede, doe ioy in heart alway, When as the good misfortune find and fall into decay. A good man. Perforce a perfect wight in deede, to be, he beares the fame, Which no man harmes ne doth delight, his neyghbour for to blame: Then it insewes, if he be good, we should him follow still, Sith we are taught to loue the good and to abhorre the ill. And if that vertue ought to be imbrast of euery wight. Then ought we all embrace that man that vertuous is and right. A perfect preseruatiue for health. For keeping of a man in health there is no better way, Than for to eate and drinke by meane, one meane to keepe alway, And ne surpasse or change that meane at one time more or lesse, For measure brings a treasure tried in pleasure or distresse. A stupendious desire. Some men there are that do imploy and fix their greedy mynde, To gather riches to themselues, to priuate gayne inclynde: And though they find no end of wealth, yet more they do desire, And kindle vp vpon their heads, a flashing flame of fire. Olde men. Al liuing wyghts whom that old Senex staffe hath smit, Denieth youthfull slouthfulnesse, and otherwise delite. Diuersitie of remembrance. VVe all are wont (as well is knowne) to prynt and beare in mynde, A lesson touching naughtinesse, to which vice is inclinde, More sooner than a godly phrase: so great diuersitie Of good and yll, we alwayes finde fixt in our memory. The deceites of the Foxe. For to haue learnde the Foxes wiles, and rightly vnderstand, Were readiest meane them to preuent before they come to hand. Of a womans hatred. The anger of a shrew is aye, more greeuous to some wight, Then is the sting of serpent strong, that bringeth mickle spite. Of boasting and bragging. He that doth litle thing performe, yet bragges at euery house: May be compared to an hill, that once brought forth a Mouse. A signe of anger. If that he bends the browes in frowning wyse to lowre, We say that he then angry is, or hath an angry showre, The sudden falling into danger No wight there is that steppeth forth or traceth on the ball, That can from daunger him exempt, so soone as in it fall. The pitie of Dormice. Of pitie this is a signe. And condigne aye for to be knowne. Howe that yong Dormice alway feede, Their syers that in age are growne. And when that they ne able are, To trauayle for their pray, The yong ones yet the same will get. And bryng to rest alway. Of imdietie of children. VVho can deny but vertue all is vanisht out of place, When as the children ne obey the fathers in no case. The sinnes of Kings. VVhen euer as the king doth sinne, and iustly Ioue therefore, Doth vengeance giue, to the intent that he should sinne no more: We alwayes see the plague to light, on commons many a one, As well as on the wight that finde and forceth them to grone. Of eating of egges At meate there met both he and she, among those dishes rare That there were set (not daintie though) came egges t'augment the fare, (Quoth she) if that you eate this egge. the prouerbe doth ensue, Three shames herewith incontinent shall happen vnto you. But he applying this egge, not printing that in minde: There fell a drop, thers one (quoth she) the other be behinde. With that he clapt the egge into his mouth, the shelles and all, Theres two (quoth she) watcht for the third, till that it doth befall. To him that was angrie because the Cuckow did sing before his doore. Frend rage not with the Cuckow, though he sings before thy doore, And Cuckow cry, ne chaunging aye, the tune he sang before. He cryes not Cuckold, though much like, thy wife do thou not blame, For though thou thinkest he Cuckold cryes, perhaps it is not thy name. Of Sugar and Salt. Sugar and Salt begyn with like letter, though sugar be good, yet salt is better: This sugar is sweete in mouth to the taste, yet doth the Scripture shew vs at the last, That salt doth season all things that there be, and no such mention of suger we see. Of hastie wiuing. He doth desire a wife in deede, and thinks it very sweete, That willingly would marry aye, eche harlot he doth meete. Of despising of the poore. Though that he falne be in decay, and wanteth to maintaine, Yet it is not a godly point to scorne the wight in paine. Of harlots. An harlot sure in outward shew professeth feruent loue, But from her heart she doth expell and faithful loue remoue. But certaine she is crauing stil, and greedy of thy golde, And without that or such like giftes, no more touch they wil holde. As long as thou doest fill her hand with money, they remaine Thine owne: but they are gone when that they haue no hope of gaine. Of keeping companie with naughtipacks. He that doth cling to felowship of naughtipacks alway. Its maruel if he with their blots, himselfe ne spotteth aye. The Prouerbe. In age he hardlie shal enioy, or riches store obtaine That could ne finde in heart in youth to geue himselfe to paine. Of anger without a cause. He that doth freat for each light cause, or trifle in respect, May wel be calde a foole by kinde, his follie to reiect. Of husbandrie and Scholers. Such as doe toyle to till the land, and husbandrie maintaine: Such as doe plowe and cart, abide ten times more greeuous paine, Than such as doe indeuour aye and learning sweete desire, And geue themselues by pleasant trade sweete letters to aspire. Another Prouerbe. He seemes vnwise that doeth intend the top of house to raise, Before that he hath cast the floore to beare the heauie paise. The error of the wicked. As the Egles doe contemne at beetles for to smite, So rich men doe, to scorne the poore, in heart ofttimes delite. Of pleading where a man is not heard. It better were that euery wight should hold his peace alway, Than for to speake and waste his wind not being heard for aye: Yea where the people ne esteeme his words, but count as vaine, There were he better hold his peace, and take no wilful paine. The frailnesse of youth. Youthly age is bent so much to foolish fond aspect, That if the masters wil not once with tongue their faults detect. Another time, the worser mad you shal them surelie finde, If that it happen so, that correction be blinde. Nothing is hid from God. VVhat sinne soeuer thou commit if it be great or small, If it be in most secrete place, yet God beholds all. Of flatterie and lieng. Flatterie beares a skill with it, But lying comes by mother wit. A faithfull frend. Doutlesse a frend he is in deede, and ought to be accounted sure, Which shewes himselfe a frend vnto his frend, as long as life endure. Of costlie apparel. Extreme follie it seemes to be attyred in such wise, To which thy base state and degree by much ne may arise. Of Neighbourlie aide. Let it ne greeuous seeme to thee, thy neighbour to releeue, Sith he, if thou shouldst meete with neede the like to thee may geeue. Of good counsell. Good councell see that thou obey at first when thou begin, Ne in such hazard doe thou slide, and sodenly fall in: From which thou maist not easily pul or drawe thy foote againe, And thus repent when its too late, encreasing stil thy paine. Of him that would fight at home, and no where els. VVith me ne wouldst thou striue, ne yet deuision make, But at home on thine owne dunghill, where all cocks proudly crake. Of a couetous mind. So sparing he is stil, and harde of that he doeth recleame, That easier it is for to get or drawe a water streame Out of a Flint, then for to wring a penie from his bagge Where thousands lie, his best coat yet is but a rotten ragge. The Prouerbe. In braue attyre who pampreth vp his corps for seemely sight, In veluet, purple, and such like, his purse then waies most light. Of wicked children. The childe that doeth account, and thinketh ought for aye: His Parents worthie ne to be to whom he should obaye, Most meete is to be expelde, out from the christen flock, Least graffes we should haue more to growe out of such wicked stocke. Of vvailing for the dead. VVhat profiteth to waile the dead, and strike my selfe with paine, A man may weepe til heart strings breake, yet haue not them againe. Of parents. It is not parents wit by right, so much the childe to hate, Rather to see him cast away than roughly him to rate. Of such as had rather haue harlots than wiues By wit I ne allow the vse ne councel of that wight Which rather would frequent the house of harlots day and night. Then chastly for to take a wife. and Himeneus please: And rather would sustaine stil strife. than alwaies liue at ease. Of him that esteemeth riches more than frendship. Vnworthy he of frendship is, that more esteemeth gold Than faithful frendship, which as long as very life doeth hold. Of Destinie. No destinie a man may scape, as reason doeth allowe: And hanging is a destinie, as many men doe know: Then if a wight doth throwe himselfe amyd the surging sea, In mind thereby to meete with death, and drowning him to slea: Yea though he fight in skirmige dure, and braul with such as be Surpassing him by manly force, yet thus much doe we see: Though many wayes for death he seek himselfe away to cast. If hanging be his destinie, he hang shal at the last. FINIS. M. G.</field>
