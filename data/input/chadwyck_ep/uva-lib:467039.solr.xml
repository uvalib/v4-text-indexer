      <field name="fulltext">JANUARY A WINTERS DAY Withering and keen the winter comes While confort flyes to close shut rooms And sees the snow in feathers pass Winnowing by the window glass And unfelt tempests howl and beat Above his head in corner seat And musing oer the changing scene Farmers behind the tavern screne Sit—or wi elbow idly prest On hob reclines the corners guest Reading the news to mark again The bankrupt lists or price of grain Or old moores anual prophecys That many a theme for talk supplys Whose almanacks thumbd pages swarm Wi frost and snow and many a storm And wisdom gossipd from the stars Of politics and bloody wars He shakes his head and still proceeds Ne'er doubting once of what he reads All wonders are wi faith supplyd Bible at once and weather guide Puffing the while his red tipt pipe Dreaming oer troubles nearly ripe Yet not quite lost in profits way He'll turn to next years harvest day And winters leisure to regale Hopes better times and sips his ale While labour still pursues his way And braves the tempest as he may The thresher first thro darkness deep Awakes the mornings winter sleep Scaring the owlet from her prey Long before she dreams of day That blinks above head on the snow Watching the mice that squeaks below And foddering boys sojourn again By ryhme hung hedge and frozen plain Shuffling thro the sinking snows Blowing his fingers as he goes To where the stock in bellowings hoarse Call for their meals in dreary close And print full many a hungry track Round circling hedge that guards the stack Wi higgling tug he cuts the hay And bares the forkfull loads away And morn and evening daily throws The little heaps upon the snows The shepherd too in great coat wrapt And straw bands round his stockings lapt Wi plodding dog that sheltering steals To shun the wind behind his heels Takes rough and smooth the winter weather And paces thro the snow together While in the fields the lonly plough Enjoys its frozen sabbath now And horses too pass time away In leisures hungry holiday Rubbing and lunging round the yard Dreaming no doubt of summer sward As near wi idle pace they draw To brouze the upheapd cribs of straw While whining hogs wi hungry roar Crowd around the kitchen door Or when their scanty meal is done Creep in the straw the cold to shun And old hens scratting all the day Seeks curnels chance may throw away Pausing to pick the seed and grain Then dusting up the chaff again While in the barn holes hid from view The cats their patient watch pursue For birds which want in flocks will draw From woods and fields to pick the straw The soodling boy that saunters round The yard on homward dutys bound Now fills the troughs for noisy hogs Oft asking aid from barking dogs That tuggles at each flopping ear Of such as scramble on too near Or circld round wi thirsty stock That for his swinging labours flock At clanking pump his station takes Half hid in mist their breathing makes Or at the pond before the door Which every night leaves frozen oer Wi heavy beetle splinters round The glossy ice wi jarring sound While huddling geese as half asleep Doth round the imprisond water creep Silent and sad to wait his aid And soon as ere a hole is made They din his ears wi pleasures cry And hiss at all that ventures nigh Splashing wi jealous joys and vain Their fill ere it be froze again And woodstack climbs at maids desire Throwing down faggots for the fire Where stealing time he often stands To warm his half froze tingling hands The schoolboy still in dithering joys Pastime in leisure hours employs And be the weather as it may Is never at a loss for play Rolling up jiant heaps of snow As noontide frets its little thaw Making rude things of various names Snow men or aught their fancy frames Till numbd wi cold they quake away And join at hotter sports to play Kicking wi many a flying bound The foot ball oer the frozen ground Or seeking bright glib ice to play To sailing slide the hours away As smooth and quick as shadows run When clouds in autumn pass the sun Some hurrying rambles eager take To skait upon the meadow lake Scaring the snipe from her retreat From shelving banks unfrozen seat Or running brook where icy spars Which the pale sunlight specks wi stars Shoots crizzling oer the restless tide To many a likness petrified Where fancy often stoops to pore And turns again to wonder more The more hen too wi fear opprest Starts from her reedy shelterd nest Bustling to get from foes away And scarcly flies more fast then they Skaiting along wi curving springs Wi arms spread out like herons wings They race away for pleasures sake A hunters speed along the lake And oft neath trees where ice is thin Meet narrow scapes from breaking in Again the robin waxes tame And ventures pitys crumbs to claim Picking the trifles off the snow Which dames on purpose daily throw And perching on the window sill Where memory recolecting still Knows the last winters broken pane And there he hops and peeps again The clouds of starnels dailey fly Blackening thro the evening sky To whittleseas reed wooded mere And ozier holts by rivers near And many a mingld swathy crowd Rook crow and jackdaw noising loud Fly too and fro to dreary fen Dull winters weary flight agen Flopping on heavy wings away As soon as morning wakens grey And when the sun sets round and red Returns to naked woods to bed Wood pigeons too in flocks appear By hunger tamd from timid fear They mid the sheep unstartld steal And share wi them a scanty meal Picking the green leaves want bestows Of turnips sprouting thro the snows The ickles from the cottage eaves Which cold nights freakish labour leaves Fret in the sun a partial thaw Pattring on the pitted snow The sun soon creepeth out of sight Behind the woods—and running night Makes haste to shut the days dull eye And grizzles oer the chilly sky Dark deep and thick by day forsook As cottage chimneys sooty nook While maidens fresh as summer roses Joining from the distant closes Haste home wi yokes and swinging pail And thresher too sets by his flail And leaves the mice at peace again To fill their holes wi stolen grain And owlets glad his toils are oer Swoops by him as he shuts the door The shepherd seeks his cottage warm And tucks his hook beneath his arm And weary in the cold to roam Scenting the track that leadeth home His dog wi swifter pace proceeds And barks to urge his masters speed Then turns and looks him in the face And trotts before wi mending pace Till out of whistle from the swain He sits him down and barks again Anxious to greet the opend door And meet the cottage fire once more The robin that wi nimble eye Glegs round a danger to espy Now pops from out the opend door From crumbs half left upon the floor Nor wipes his bill on perching chair Nor stays to clean a feather there Scard at the cat that sliveth in A chance from evenings glooms to win To jump on chairs or tables nigh Seeking what plunder may supply The childerns litterd scraps to thieve Or aught that negligence may leave Creeping when huswives cease to watch Or dairey doors are off the latch On cheese or butter to regale Or new milk reeking in the pale The hedger now in leather coat From wood land wilds and fields remote After a journey far and slow Knocks from his shoes the caking snow And opes the welcome creaking door Throwing his faggot on the floor And at his listning wifes desire To eke afresh the blazing fire Wi sharp bill cuts the hazel bands Then sets him down to warm his hands And tell in labours happy way His story of the passing day While as the warm blaze cracks and gleams The supper reeks in savoury steams Or keetle simmers merrily And tinkling cups are set for tea Thus doth the winters dreary day From morn to evening wear away JANUARY A COTTAGE EVENING The shutters closd the lamp alight The faggot chopt and blazing bright The shepherd from his labour free Dancing his childern on his knee Or toasting sloe boughs sputtering ripe Or smoaking glad his puthering pipe While underneath his masters seat The tird dog lies in slumbers sweet Startling and whimpering in his sleep Chasing still the straying sheep The cat rolld round in vacant chair Or leaping childerns knees to lair Or purring on the warmer hearth Sweet chorus to the crickets mirth The red cap hanging over head In cage of wire is perchd abed Slumbering in his painted feathers Unconcous of the outdoor weathers And things wi out the cottage walls Meet comfort as the evening falls As happy in the winters dearth As those around the blazing hearth The ass frost drove from off the moors Where storms thro naked bushes roars And not a leaf or sprig of green On ground or quaking bush is seen Save grey veind ivys hardy pride Round old trees by the common side Litterd wi straw now dozes warm Neath the yard hovel from the storm The swine well fed and in the sty And fowl snug perchd in hovel nigh Wi head in feathers safe asleep Where fox finds ne'er a hole to creep And geese that gabble in their dreams Of litterd corn and thawing streams The sparrow too their daily guest Is in the cottage eaves at rest And robin small and smaller wren Are in their warm holes safe agen From falling snows that winnow bye The hovels where they nightly lye And ague winds that shake the tree Where other birds are forcd to be The hus wife busy night and day Cleareth the supper things away While jumping cat starts from her seat And streaking up on weary feet The dog wakes at the welcome tones That calls him up to pick the bones On corner walls a glittering row Hang fire irons less for use then show Tongues bright wi hus wifes rubbing toil Whod sooner burn her hands then soil When sticks want mending up and when Mores sought to eke the blaze agen And sifter dengling by their side And poker in the fire untryd And horshoe brightend as a spell Witchcrafts evil powers to quell And warming pan reflecting bright The crackling blazes twittering light That hangs the corner wall to grace And seldom taken from its place Save when the winter keener falls Searching thro the cottage walls Then quaking from the cottage fire Warm beds as comforts they require Yet still tis bright as gold can be And childern often peep to see Their laughing faces as they pass Gleam on the lid as plain as glass Things cleard away then down she sits And tells her tales by starts and fits Not willing to loose time or toil She knits or sues and talks the while Somthing as may be warnings found To the young listners gaping round Of boys who in her early day Strolld to the meadow lake to play And skaited races void of fear Oer deeps or shallows any where Till willows oer the brink inclind Shelterd the water from the wind And left it scarely crizzld oer When one plopt in to rise no more And how upon a market night When ne'er a star bestowd its light A farmers shepherd oer his glass Forgot that he had woods to pass Who overtook by darkness deep Had been to sell his masters sheep Till coming wi his startld horse To where two roads a hollow cross Where lone guide when a stranger strays A white post points four different ways There by the woodsides lonly gate A murdering robber lay in wait The frighted horse wi broken rein Stood at the stable door again But none came home to fill his rack Or take the saddle from his back The saddle it was all he bore The man was seen alive no more In her young days beside the wood The gibbet in its terror stood Tho now all gone tis not forgot Still dreaded as a haunted spot And from her memory oft repeats Witches dread powers and fairey feats How one has oft been known to prance In cowcribs like a coach to france And rid on sheep trays from the fold A race horse speed to burton hold To join the midnight mysterys rout Where witches meet the yews about And how when met wi unawares They instant turn to cats or hares And race along wi hellish flight Now here and there and out of sight And how the tother tiny things Will leave their moonlight meadow rings And unpercievd thro keyholes creep When alls in bed and fast asleep And crowd in cupboards as they please As thick as mites in rotten cheese To feast on what the cotter leaves For mice ant reckond bigger thieves They take away too well as eat And still the hus wifes eye they cheat Nothing to miss as other thieves Alls left the same as she percieves In spite of all the crowds that swarm In cottage small and larger farm That thro each key hole pop and pop Like wasps into a grocers shop Wi all the things that they can win From chance to put their plunders in The shells of wallnuts split in two By crows who wi the curnels flew And acorn cups by stock doves pluckt And eggshells by a cuckoo suckt That hold what ever things they please Stole tea or sugar bread or cheese Wi broad leaves of the sycamore To rap as cloths their daintys oer And hazel nutts when they regale In cellars brought to hold their ale Wi bungholes squirrels bored well To get the curnel from the shell Or maggots a way out to win When all was eat that grew within And be the key holes ere so high Rush poles a laders help supply Where soft the climbers fearless tread On spindles made of bentv thread And foul or fair or dark the night Their wild fire lamps are ready light For which full many a daring crime Is acted in the summer time When glowworms found in lanes remote Is murderd for its shining coat And put in flowers that nature weaves Wi hollow shapes and silken leaves Such as the canterbury bell Serving for lamp or lanthorn well Or following wi unwearied watch The flight of one they cannot match As silence sliveth upon sleep Or thieves by dozing watchdogs creep They steal from Jack a lanthorns tails A light whose guidance never fails To aid them in the darkest night And guide their plundering steps aright Rattling away in printless tracks Some horsd on beetles glossy backs Go wisking on and others hie As fast as loaded moths can flye Some urge the morning cock to shun The hardest gallop mice can run In chariots lolling at their ease Made of what ere their fancys please Things that in childhoods memory dwells Scoopd crow-pot-stones or cockle shells Wi weels at hand of mallow seeds Where childish sports were stringing beads And thus equipd they softly pass Like shadows on the summer grass And drive away in troops together Just as the spring wind drives a feather They ride oer insects as a stone Nor bruize a limb nor brake a bone As light as happy dreams they creep Nor brake the feeblest link of sleep A midgeon in their road abed Ne'er feels the wheels run oer his head But sleeps till sunrise calls him up Unconsous of the passing troop Thus dames the winter night regales Wi wonders never ceasing tales While in the corner ill at ease Or crushing tween their fathers knees The childern silent all the while And een repressd the laugh or smile Quake wi the ague chills of fear And tremble while they love to hear Startling while they the tales recall At their own shadows on the wall Till the old clock that strikes unseen Behind the picture pasted screene Where Eve and Adam still agree To rob lifes fatal apple tree Counts over bed times hour of rest And bids each be sleeps fearful guest She then her half told tales will leave To finish on tomorrows eve The childern cringe away to bed And up the ladder softly tread Scarce daring from their fearful joys To look behind or make a noise Nor speak a word but still as sleep They secret to their pillows creep And whisper oer in terrors way The prayers they dare no louder say And hide their heads beneath the cloaths And try in vain to seek repose While yet to fancys sleepless eye Witches on sheep trays gallop bye And faireys like to rising sparks Swarm twittering round them in the dark Till sleep creeps nigh to ease their cares And drops upon them unawares O spirit of the days gone bye Sweet childhoods fearful extacy The witching spells of winter nights Where are they fled wi their delights When listning on the corner seat The winter evenings length to cheat I heard my mothers memory tell Tales superstition loves so well Things said or sung a thousand times In simple prose or simpler ryhmes Ah where is page of poesy So sweet as theirs was wont to be The majic wonders that decievd When fictions were as truths believd The fairey feats that once prevaild Told to delight and never faild Where are they now their fears and sighs And tears from founts of happy eyes Breathless suspense and all their crew To what wild dwelling have they flew I read in books but find them not For poesy hath its youth forgot I hear them told to childern still But fear ne'er numbs my spirits chill I still see faces pale wi dread While mine coud laugh at what is said See tears imagind woes supply While mine wi real cares are dry Where are they gone the joys and fears The links the life of other years I thought they bound around my heart So close that we coud never part Till reason like a winters day Nipt childhoods visions all away Nor left behind one withering flower To cherish in a lonly hour Memory may yet the themes repeat But childhoods heart doth cease to beat At storys reasons sterner lore Turneth like gossips from her door The majic fountain where the head Rose up just as the startld maid Was stooping from the weedy brink To dip her pitcher in to drink That did its half hid mystery tell To smooth its hair and use it well Who doing as it bade her do Turnd to a king and lover too The tale of Cinderella told The winter thro and never old The faireys favourite and friend Who made her happy in the end The pumpkin that at her approach Was turnd into a golden coach The rats that faireys majic knew And instantly to horses grew And coachmen ready at her call To drive her to the princes ball With fur changd jackets silver lind And tails hung neath their hats behind Where soon as met the princes sight She made his heart ach all the night The golden glove wi fingers small She lost while dancing in the hall That was on every finger tryd And fitted hers and none beside When cinderella soon as seen Was woo'd and won and made a queen The boy that did the jiants slay And gave his mothers cows away For majic mask that day or night When on woud keep him out of sight And running beans not such as weaves Round poles the height of cottage eaves But majic ones that travelld high Some steeples journeys up the sky And reachd a jiants dwelling there A cloud built castle in the air Where venturing up the fearfull height That servd him climbing half the night He searchd the jiants coffers oer And never wanted wealth no more While like a lion scenting food The jiant roard in hungry mood A storm of threats that might suffice To freeze the hottest blood to ice And make when heard however bold The strongest heart strings cramp wi cold But mine sleeps on thro fear and dread And terrors that might wake the dead When like a lion in the wood He snufts and tracks the scent of blood And vows if aught falls in his power He'll grind their very bones to flower I hear it now nor dream of harm The storm is settld to a calm Those fears are dead what will not dye In fading lifes mortality Those truths are fled and left behind A real world and doubting mind FEBRUARY A THAW The snow is gone from cottage tops The thatch moss glows in brighter green And eaves in quick succession drops Where grinning icicles hath been Pit patting wi a pleasant noise In tubs set by the cottage door And ducks and geese wi happy joys Douse in the yard pond brimming oer The sun peeps thro the window pane Which childern mark wi laughing eye And in the wet street steal again To tell each other spring is nigh And as young hope the past recalls In playing groups will often draw Building beside the sunny walls Their spring-play-huts of sticks or straw And oft in pleasures dreams they hie Round homsteads by the village side Scratting the hedgrow mosses bye Where painted pooty shells abide Mistaking oft the ivy spray For leaves that come wi budding spring And wondering in their search for play Why birds delay to build and sing The milk maid singing leaves her bed As glad as happy thoughts can be While mag pies chatter oer her head As jocund in the change as she Her cows around the closes stray Nor lingering wait the foddering boy Tossing the molehills in their play And staring round in frolic joy Ploughmen go whistling to their toils And yoke again the rested plough And mingling oer the mellow soils Boys shouts and whips are noising now The shepherd now is often seen By warm banks oer his hook to bend Or oer a gate or stile to lean Chattering to a passing friend Odd hive bees fancying winter oer And dreaming in their combs of spring Creeps on the slab beside their door And strokes its legs upon its wing While wild ones half asleep are humming Round snowdrop bells a feeble note And pigions coo of summer coming Picking their feathers on the cote The barking dogs by lane and wood Drive sheep afield from foddering ground And eccho in her summer mood Briskly mocks the cheery sound The flocks as from a prison broke Shake their wet fleeces in the sun While following fast a misty smoke Reeks from the moist grass as they run Nor more behind his masters heels The dog creeps oer his winter pace But cocks his tail and oer the fields Runs many a wild and random chase Following in spite of chiding calls The startld cat in harmless glee Scaring her up the weed green walls Or mossy mottld apple tree As crows from morning perches flye He barks and follows them in vain Een larks will catch his nimble eye And off he starts and barks again Wi breathless haste and blinded guess Oft following where the hare hath gone Forgetting in his joys excess His frolic puppy days are done The gossips saunter in the sun As at the spring from door to door Of matters in the village done And secret newsings mutterd oer Young girls when they each other meet Will stand their tales of love to tell While going on errands down the street Or fetching water from the well A calm of pleasure listens round And almost whispers winter bye While fancy dreams of summer sounds And quiet rapture fills the eye The sun beams on the hedges lye The south wind murmers summer soft And maids hang out white cloaths to dry Around the eldern skirted croft Each barns green thatch reeks in the sun Its mate the happy sparrow calls And as nest building spring begun Peeps in the holes about the walls The wren a sunny side the stack Wi short tail ever on the strunt Cockd gadding up above his back Again for dancing gnats will hunt The gladdend swine bolt from the sty And round the yard in freedom run Or stretching in their slumbers lye Beside the cottage in the sun The young horse whinneys to its mate And sickens from the threshers door Rubbing the straw yards banded gate Longing for freedom on the moor Hens leave their roosts wi cackling calls To see the barn door free from snow And cocks flye up the mossy walls To clap their spangld wings and crow About the steeples sunny top The jackdaw flocks resemble spring And in the stone archd windows pop Wi summer noise and wanton wing The small birds think their wants are oer To see the snow hills fret again And from the barns chaff litterd door Betake them to the greening plain The woodmans robin startles coy Nor longer at his elbow comes To peck wi hungers eager joy Mong mossy stulps the litterd crumbs Neath hedge and walls that screen the wind The gnats for play will flock together And een poor flyes odd hopes will find To venture in the mocking weather From out their hidy holes again Wi feeble pace they often crecp Along the sun warmd window pane Like dreaming things that walk in sleep The mavis thrush wi wild delight Upon the orchards dripping tree Mutters to see the day so bright Spring scraps of young hopes poesy And oft dame stops her burring wheel To hear the robins note once more That tutles while he pecks his meal From sweet-briar hips beside the door The hedghog from its hollow root Sees the wood moss clear of snow And hunts each hedge for fallen fruit Crab hip and winter bitten sloe And oft when checkd by sudden fears As shepherd dog his haunt espies He rolls up in a ball of spears And all his barking rage defies Thus nature of the spring will dream While south winds thaw but soon again Frost breaths upon the stiffening stream And numbs it into ice—the plain Soon wears its merry garb of white And icicles that fret at noon Will eke their icy tails at night Beneath the chilly stars and moon Nature soon sickens of her joys And all is sad and dumb again Save merry shouts of sliding boys About the frozen furrowd plain The foddering boy forgets his song And silent goes wi folded arms And croodling shepherds bend along Crouching to the whizzing storms MARCH March month of ‘many weathers’ wildly comes In hail and snow and rain and threatning hums And floods: while often at his cottage door The shepherd stands to hear the distant roar Loosd from the rushing mills and river locks Wi thundering sound and over powering shocks And headlong hurry thro the meadow brigs Brushing the leaning willows fingering twigs In feathery foam and eddy hurryng chase Rolling a storm oertaken travellers pace From bank to bank along the meadow leas Spreading and shining like to little seas While in the pale sunlight a watery brood Of swopping white birds flock about the flood Yet winter seems half weary of its toil And round the ploughman on the elting soil Will thread a minutes sun shine wild and warm Thro the raggd places of the swimming storm And oft the shepherd in his path will spye The little daisey in the wet grass lye That to the peeping sun enlivens gay Like Labour smiling on an holiday And where the stunt bank fronts the southern sky By lanes or brooks where sunbeams love to lye A cowslip peep will open faintly coy Soon seen and gatherd by a wandering boy A tale of spring around the distant haze Seems muttering pleasures wi the lengthning days Morn wakens mottld oft wi may day stains And shower drops hang the grassy sprouting plains And on the naked thorns of brassy hue Drip glistning like a summer dream of dew While from the hill side freshning forest drops As one might walk upon their thickening tops And buds wi young hopes promise seemly swells Where woodman that in wild seclusion dwells Wi chopping toil the coming spring decieves Of many dancing shadows flowers and leaves And in his pathway down the mossy wood Crushes wi hasty feet full many a bud Of early primrose yet if timely spied Shelterd some old half rotten stump beside The sight will cheer his solitery hour And urge his feet to stride and save the flower Muffld in baffles leathern coat and gloves The hedger toils oft scaring rustling doves From out the hedgrows who in hunger browze The chockolate berrys on the ivy boughs And flocking field fares speckld like the thrush Picking the red awe from the sweeing bush That come and go on winters chilly wing And seem to share no sympethy wi spring The stooping ditcher in the water stands Letting the furrowd lakes from off the lands Or splashing cleans the pasture brooks of mud Where many a wild weed freshens into bud And sprouting from the bottom purply green The water cresses neath the wave is seen Which the old woman gladly drags to land Wi reaching long rake in her tottering hand The ploughman mawls along the doughy sloughs And often stop their songs to clean their ploughs From teazing twitch that in the spongy soil Clings round the colter terryfying toil The sower striding oer his dirty way Sinks anckle deep in pudgy sloughs and clay And oer his heavy hopper stoutly leans Strewing wi swinging arms the pattering beans Which soon as aprils milder weather gleams Will shoot up green between the furroed seams The driving boy glad when his steps can trace The swelling edding as a resting place Slings from his clotted shoes the dirt around And feign woud rest him on the solid ground And sings when he can meet the parting green Of rushy balks that bend the lands between While close behind em struts the nauntling crow And daws whose heads seem powderd oer wi snow To seek the worms—and rooks a noisey guest That on the wind rockd elms prepares her nest On the fresh furrow often drops to pull The twitchy roots and gathering sticks and wool Neath trees whose dead twigs litter to the wind And gaps where stray sheep left their coats behind While ground larks on a sweeing clump of rushes Or on the top twigs of the oddling bushes Chirp their ‘cree creeing’ note that sounds of spring And sky larks meet the sun wi flittering wing Soon as the morning opes its brightning eye Large clouds of sturnels blacken thro the sky From ozier holts about the rushy fen And reed shaw borders by the river Nen And wild geese regiments now agen repair To the wet bosom of broad marshes there In marching coloms and attention all Listning and following their ring leaders call The shepherd boy that hastens now and then From hail and snow beneath his sheltering den Of flags or file leavd sedges tyd in sheaves Or stubble shocks oft as his eye percieves Sun threads struck out wi momentary smiles Wi fancy thoughts his lonliness beguiles Thinking the struggling winter hourly bye As down the edges of the distant sky The hail storm sweeps—and while he stops to strip The stooping hedgbriar of its lingcring hip He hears the wild geese gabble oer his head And pleasd wi fancys in his musings bred He marks the figurd forms in which they flye And pausing follows wi a wondering eye Likening their curious march in curves or rows To every letter which his memory knows While far above the solitary crane Swings lonly to unfrozen dykes again Cranking a jarring mellancholy cry Thro the wild journey of the cheerless sky Full oft at early seasons mild and fair March bids farewell wi garlands in her hair Of hazel tassles woodbines hairy sprout And sloe and wild plumb blossoms peeping out In thick set knotts of flowers preparing gay For aprils reign a mockery of may That soon will glisten on the earnest eye Like snow white cloaths hung in the sun to drye The old dame often stills her burring wheel When the bright sun will thro the window steal And gleam upon her face and dancing fall In diamond shadows on the picturd wall While the white butterflye as in amaze Will settle on the glossy glass to gaze And oddling bee oft patting passing bye As if they care to tell her spring was nigh And smiling glad to see such things once more Up she will get and potter to the door And look upon the trees beneath the eaves Sweet briar and ladslove swelling into leaves And damsin trees thick notting into bloom And goosberry blossoms on the bushes come And stooping down oft views her garden beds To see the spring flowers pricking out their heads And from her apron strings she'll often pull Her sissars out an early bunch to cull For flower pots on the window board to stand Where the old hour glass spins its thread of sand And maids will often mark wi laughing eye In elder where they hang their cloaths to drye The sharp eyd robin hop from grain to grain Singing its little summer notes again As a sweet pledge of Spring the little lambs Bleat in the varied weather round their dams Or hugh molehill or roman mound behind Like spots of snow lye shelterd from the wind While the old yoes bold wi maternal cares Looses their fears and every danger dares Who if the shepherds dog but turns his eye And stops behind a moment passing bye Will stamp draw back and then their threats repeat Urging defiance wi their stamping feet And stung wi cares hopes cannot recconsile They stamp and follow till he leaps a stile Or skulking from their threats betakes to flight And wi the master lessens out of sight Clowns mark the threetning rage of march pass bye And clouds wear thin and ragged in the sky While wi less sudden and more lasting smiles The growing sun their hopes of spring beguiles Who often at its end remark wi pride Days lengthen in their visits a ‘cocks stride’ Dames clean their candlesticks and set them bye Glad of the makeshift light that eves supply The boy returning home at night from toil Down lane and close oer footbrig gate and style Oft trembles into fear and stands to hark The waking fox renew his short gruff bark While badgers eccho their dread evening shrieks And to his thrilling thoughts in terror speaks And shepherds that wi in their hulks remain Night after night upon the chilly plain To watch the dropping lambs that at all hours Come in the quaking blast like early flowers Demanding all the shepherds care who find Warm hedge side spots and take them from the wind And round their necks in wary caution tyes Long shreds of rags in red or purple dyes Thats meant in danger as a safty spell Like the old yoe that wears a tinkling bell The sneaking foxes from his thefts to fright That often seizes the young lambs at night These when they in their nightly watchings hear The badgers shrieks can hardly stifle fear They list the noise from woodlands dark recess Like helpless shrieking woman in distress And oft as such fears fancying mistery Believes the dismal yelling sounds to be For superstition hath its thousand tales To people all his midnight woods and vales And the dread spot from whence the dismal noise Mars the night musings of their dark employs Owns its sad tale to realize their fear At which their hearts in boyhood achd to hear A maid at night by treacherous love decoyd Was in that shrieking wood years past destroyd She went twas said to meet the waiting swain And home and friends ne'er saw her face again Mid brakes and thorns that crowded round the dell And matting weeds that had no tongues to tell He murderd her alone at dead midnight While the pale moon threw round her sickly light And loud shrieks left the thickets slumbers deep That only scard the little birds from sleep When the pale murderers terror frowning eye Told its dread errand that the maid shoud dye Mid thick black thorns her secret grave was made And there wi night the murderd girl was laid When no one saw the deed but god and he And moonlight sparkling thro the sleeping tree Around—the red breast might at morning steel There for the worm to meet his morning meal In fresh turnd moulds that first beheld the sun Nor knew the deed that dismal night had done Such is the tale that superstition gives And in her midnight memory ever lives That makes the boy run by wi wild affright And shepherds startle on their rounds at night Now love teazd maidens from their droning wheels At the red hour of sun set sliving steals From scolding dames to meet their swains again Tho water checks their visits oer the plain They slive where no one sees some wall behind Or orchard apple trees that stops the wind To talk about springs pleasures hovering nigh And happy rambles when the roads get dry The insect world now sunbeams higher climb Oft dream of spring and wake before their time Blue flyes from straw stack crawling scarce alive And bees peep out on slabs before the hive Stroaking their little legs across their wings And venturing short flight where the snow drop hings Its silver bell—and winter aconite Wi buttercup like flowers that shut at night And green leaf frilling round their cups of gold Like tender maiden muffld from the cold They sip and find their honey dreams are vain And feebly hasten to their hives again And butter flys by eager hopes undone Glad as a child come out to greet the sun Lost neath the shadow of a sudden shower Nor left to see tomorrows april flower APRIL The infant april joins the spring And views its watery skye As youngling linnet trys its wing And fears at first to flye With timid step she ventures on And hardly dares to smile The blossoms open one by one And sunny hours beguile But finer days approacheth yet With scenes more sweet to charm And suns arive that rise and set Bright strangers to a storm And as the birds with louder song Each mornings glory cheers With bolder step she speeds along And looses all her fears In wanton gambols like a child She tends her early toils And seeks the buds along the wild That blossom while she smiles And laughing on with nought to chide She races with the hours Or sports by natures lovley side And fills her lap with flowers Tho at her birth north cutting gales Her beautys oft disguise And hopfull blossoms turning pale Upon her bosom dies Yet ere she seeks another place And ends her reign in this She leaves us with as fair a face As ere gave birth to bliss And fairey month of waking mirth From whom our joys ensue Thou early gladder of the earth Thrice welcom here anew With thee the bud unfolds to leaves The grass greens on the lea And flowers their tender boon recieves To bloom and smile with thee The shepherds on thy pasture walks The first fair cows lip finds Whose tufted flowers on slender stalks Keep nodding to the winds And tho thy thorns withold the may Their shades the violets bring Which childern stoop for in their play As tokens of the spring The time when daiseys bloom divine With thy calm hours begun And crowflowers blazing blooms are thine Bright childern of the sun Along thy woodlands shaded nooks The primrose wanly comes And shining in thy pebley brooks The horse bleb gaily blooms The long lost charm of sparkling dew Thy gentle birth recieves And on thy wreathing locks we view The first infolding leaves And seeking firstling buds and flowers The trials of thy skill Were pastimes of my infant hours And so they haunt me still To see thy first broad arum leaves I lovd them from a child And where thy woodbines sprouting weaves I joyd to trace the wild And jocund as thy lambs at play I met the wanton wind With feelings that have passd away Whose shadows cling behind Those joys which childhood claims its own Woud they were kin to men Those treasures to the world unknown When known—was witherd then But hovering round our growing years To gild cares sable shroud Their spirit thro the gloom appears As suns behind a cloud As thou first met my infant eyes When thro thy fields I flew Whose distance where they meet the skyes Was all the worlds I knew That warmth of fancys wildest hours Which made things kin to life That heard a voice in trees and flowers Has swoond in reasons strife Sweet month thy pleasures bids thee be The fairest child of spring And every hour that comes with thee Comes some new joy to bring The trees still deepen in their bloom Grass greens the meadow lands And flowers with every morning come As dropt by fairey hands The field and gardens lovley hours Begin and end with thee For whats so sweet as peeping flowers And bursting buds to see What time the dews unsullied drops In burnishd gold distills On crocus flowers unclosing tops And drooping daffodills Each day with added glorys come And as they leave the night Put on the roseys lovley bloom And blushes with delight And suns that wait their welcome birth With earlier haste pursue Their journeys to this lower earth To free their steps from dew To see thee come all hearts rejoice And warms with feelings strong With thee all nature finds a voice And hums a waking song The lover views thy welcome hours And thinks of summer come And takes the maid thy early flowers To tempt her steps from home Along each hedge and sprouting bush The singing birds are blest And linnet green and speckld thrush Prepare their mossy nest On the warm bed thy plain supplys The young lambs find repose And mid thy green hills basking lies Like spots of lingering snows Young things of tender life again Enjoys thy sunny hours And gosslings waddle oer the plain As yellow as its flowers Or swim the pond in wild delight To catch the water flye Where hissing geese in ceasless spite Make childern scamper bye Again the fairey tribes pursue Their pleasures on the plain And brightend with the morning dew Black circles shine again And on its superstitious ground Where flowers seem loath to dwell The toadstools fuzzy balls abound And mushrooms yearly swell The seasons beautys all are thine That visit with the year Beautys that poets think divine And all delight to hear Thy latter days a pleasure brings That gladden every heart Pleasures that come like lovley things But like to shades depart Thy opend leaves and ripend buds The cuckoo makes his choice And shepherds in thy greening woods First hears the cheering voice And to thy ripend blooming bowers The nightingale belongs And singing to thy parting hours Keeps night awake with songs With thee the swallow dares to come And prunes his sutty wings And urgd to seek their yearly home Thy suns the Martin brings And lovley month be leisure mine Thy yearly mate to be Tho may day scenes may brighter shine Their birth belongs to thee I waked me with thy rising sun And thy first glorys viewd And as thy welcome hours begun Their sunny steps pursued And now thy sun is on the set Like to a lovley eve I view thy parting with regret And linger loath to leave Thou lovley april fare thee well Thou early child of spring Tho born where storms too often dwell Thy parents news to bring Yet what thy parting youth supplys No other months excell Thou first for flowers and sunny skyes Sweet april fare thee well MAY Come queen of months in company Wi all thy merry minstrelsy The restless cuckoo absent long And twittering swallows chimney song And hedge row crickets notes that run From every bank that fronts the sun And swathy bees about the grass That stops wi every bloom they pass And every minute every hour Keep teazing weeds that wear a flower And toil and childhoods humming joys For there is music in the noise The village childern mad for sport In school times leisure ever short That cuck and catch the bouncing ball And run along the church yard wall Capt wi rude figured slabs whose claims In times bad memory hath no names Oft racing round the nookey church Or calling ecchos in the porch And jelting oer the weather cock Viewing wi jealous eyes the clock Oft leaping grave stones leaning hights Uncheckt wi mellancholy sights The green grass swelld in many a heap Where kin and friends and parents sleep Unthinking in their jovial cry That time shall come when they shall lye As lonly and as still as they While other boys above them play Heedless as they do now to know The unconcous dust that lies below The shepherd goes wi happy stride Wi morns long shadow by his side Down the dryd lanes neath blooming may That once was over shoes in clay While martins twitter neath his eaves Which he at early morning leaves The driving boy beside his team Will oer the may month beauty dream And cock his hat and turn his eye On flower and tree and deepning skye And oft bursts loud in fits of song And whistles as he reels along Cracking his whip in starts of joy A happy dirty driving boy The youth who leaves his corner stool Betimes for neighbouring village school While as a mark to urge him right The church spires all the way in sight Wi cheerings from his parents given Starts neath the joyous smiles of heaven And sawns wi many an idle stand Wi bookbag swinging in his hand And gazes as he passes bye On every thing that meets his eye Young lambs seem tempting him to play Dancing and bleating in his way Wi trembling tails and pointed ears They follow him and loose their fears He smiles upon their sunny faces And feign woud join their happy races The birds that sing on bush and tree Seem chirping for his company And all in fancys idle whim Seem keeping holiday but him He lolls upon each resting stile To see the fields so sweetly smile To see the wheat grow green and long And list the weeders toiling song Or short note of the changing thrush Above him in the white thorn bush That oer the leaning stile bends low Loaded wi mockery of snow Mozzld wi many a lushy thread Of crab tree blossoms delicate red He often bends wi many a wish Oer the brig rail to view the fish Go sturting by in sunny gleams And chucks in the eye dazzld streams Crumbs from his pocket oft to watch The swarming struttle come to catch Them where they to the bottom sile Sighing in fancys joy the while Hes cautiond not to stand so nigh By rosey milkmaid tripping bye Where he admires wi fond delight And longs to be their mate till night He often ventures thro the day At truant now and then to play Rambling about the field and plain Seeking larks nests in the grain And picking flowers and boughs of may To hurd awhile and throw away Lurking neath bushes from the sight Of tell tale eyes till schools noon night Listning each hour for church clocks hum To know the hour to wander home That parents may not think him long Nor dream of his rude doing wrong Dreading thro night wi dreaming pain To meet his masters wand again Each hedge is loaded thick wi green And where the hedger late hath been Tender shoots begin to grow From the mossy stumps below While sheep and cow that teaze the grain Will nip them to the root again They lay their bill and mittens bye And on to other labours hie While wood men still on spring intrudes And thins the shadow solitudes Wi sharpend axes felling down The oak trees budding into brown Where as they crash upon the ground A crowd of labourers gather round And mix among the shadows dark To rip the crackling staining bark From off the tree and lay when done The rolls in lares to meet the sun Depriving yearly where they come The green wood pecker of its home That early in the spring began Far from the sight of troubling man And bord their round holes in each tree In fancys sweet security Till startld wi the woodmans noise It wakes from all its dreaming joys The blue bells too that thickly bloom Where man was never feard to come And smell smocks that from view retires Mong rustling leaves and bowing briars And stooping lilys of the valley That comes wi shades and dews to dally While beady drops on slender threads Wi broad hood leaves above their heads Like white robd maids in summer hours Neath umberellas shunning showers These neath the barkmens crushing treads Oft perish in their blooming beds Thus stript of boughs and bark in white Their trunks shine in the mellow light Beneath the green surviving trees That wave above them in the breeze And waking whispers slowly bends As if they mournd their fallen friends Each morning now the weeders meet To cut the thistle from the wheat And ruin in the sunny hours Full many wild weeds of their flowers Corn poppys that in crimson dwell Calld ‘head achs’ from their sickly smell And carlock yellow as the sun That oer the may fields thickly run And ‘iron weed’ content to share The meanest spot that spring can spare Een roads where danger hourly comes Is not wi out its purple blooms And leaves wi pricks like thistles round Thick set that have no strength to wound That shrink to childhoods eager hold Like hair—and with its eye of gold And scarlet starry points of flowers Pimpernel dreading nights and showers Oft calld ‘the shepherds weather glass’ That sleep till suns have dryd the grass Then wakes and spreads its creeping bloom Till clouds or threatning shadows come Then close it shuts to sleep again Which weeders see and talk of rain And boys that mark them shut so soon Will call them ‘John go bed at noon’ And fumitory too a name That superstition holds to fame Whose red and purple mottld flowers Are cropt by maids in weeding hours To boil in water milk and whey For washes on an holiday To make their beauty fair and sleak And scour the tan from summers cheek And simple small forget me not Eyd wi a pinshead yellow spot Ith middle of its tender blue That gains from poets notice due These flowers their toil by crowds destroys And robs them of their lonly joys That met the may wi hopes as sweet As those her suns in gardens meet And oft the dame will feel inclind As childhoods memory comes to mind To turn her hook away and spare The blooms it lovd to gather there My wild field catalogue of flowers Grows in my ryhmes as thick as showers Tedious and long as they may be To some they never weary me Then wood and mead and field of grain I coud hunt oer and oer again And talk to every blossom wild Fond as a parent to a child And cull them in my childish joy By swarms and swarms and never cloy When their lank shades oer morning pearls Shrink from their lengths to little girls And like the clock hand pointing one Is turned and tells the morning gone They leave their toils for dinners hour Beneath some hedges bramble bower And season sweet their savory meals Wi joke and tale and merry peals Of ancient tunes from happy tongues While linnets join their fitful songs Perchd oer their heads in frolic play Among the tufts of motling may The young girls whisper things of love And from the old dames hearing move Oft making ‘love knotts’ in the shade Of blue green oat or wheaten blade And trying simple charms and spells That rural superstition tells They pull the little blossom threads From out the knopweeds button heads And put the husk wi many a smile In their white bosoms for awhile Who if they guess aright the swain That loves sweet fancys trys to gain Tis said that ere its lain an hour Twill blossom wi a second flower And from her white breasts hankerchief Bloom as they ne'er had lost a leaf When signs appear that token wet As they are neath the bushes met The girls are glad wi hopes of play And harping of the holiday A hugh blue bird will often swim Along the wheat when skys grow dim Wi clouds—slow as the gales of spring In motion wi dark shadowd wing Beneath the coming storm it sails And lonly chirps the wheat hid quails That come to live wi spring again And start when summer browns the grain They start the young girls joys afloat Wi ‘wet my foot’ its yearly note So fancy doth the sound explain And proves it oft a sign of rain About the moor mong sheep and cow The boy or old man wanders now Hunting all day wi hopful pace Each thick sown rushy thistly place For plover eggs while oer them flye The fearful birds wi teazing cry Trying to lead their steps astray And coying him another way And be the weather chill or warm Wi brown hats truckd beneath his arm Holding each prize their search has won They plod bare headed to the sun Now dames oft bustle from their wheels Wi childern scampering at their heels To watch the bees that hang and snive In clumps about each thronging hive And flit and thicken in the light While the old dame enjoys the sight And raps the while their warming pans A spell that superstition plans To coax them in the gardens bounds As if they lovd the tinkling sounds And oft one hears the dinning noise Which dames believe each swarm decoys Around each village day by day Mingling in the warmth of may Sweet scented herbs her skill contrives To rub the bramble platted hives Fennels thread leaves and crimpld balm To scent the new house of the swarm The thresher dull as winter days And lost to all that spring displays Still mid his barn dust forcd to stand Swings his frail round wi weary hand While oer his head shades thickly creep And hides the blinking owl asleep And bats in cobweb corners bred Sharing till night their murky bed The sunshine trickles on the floor Thro every crivice of the door And makes his barn where shadows dwell As irksome as a prisoners cell And as he seeks his daily meal As schoolboys from their tasks will steal He often stands in fond delay To see the daisey in his way And wild weeds flowering on the wall That will his childish sports recall Of all the joys that came wi spring The twirling top the marble ring The gingling halfpence hussld up At pitch and toss the eager stoop To pick up heads, the smuggld plays Neath hovels upon sabbath days When parson he is safe from view And clerk sings amen in his pew The sitting down when school was oer Upon the threshold by his door Picking from mallows sport to please Each crumpld seed he calld a cheese And hunting from the stackyard sod The stinking hen banes velted pod By youths vain fancys sweetly fed Christning them his loaves of bread He sees while rocking down the street Wi weary hands and crimpling feet Young childern at the self same games And hears the self same simple names Still floating on each happy tongue Touchd wi the simple scene so strong Tears almost start and many a sigh Regrets the happiness gone bye And in sweet natures holiday His heart is sad while all is gay How lovly now are lanes and balks For toils and lovers sunday walks The daisey and the buttercup For which the laughing childern stoop A hundred times throughout the day In their rude ramping summer play So thickly now the pasture crowds In gold and silver sheeted clouds As if the drops in april showers Had woo'd the sun and swoond to flowers The brook resumes its summer dresses Purling neath grass and water cresses And mint and flag leaf swording high Their blooms to the unheeding eye And taper bowbent hanging rushes And horse tail childerns bottle brushes And summer tracks about its brink Is fresh agen where cattle drink And on its sunny bank the swain Stretches his idle length again Soon as the sun forgets the day The moon looks down on the lovly may And the little star his friend and guide Travelling together side by side And the seven stars and charleses wain Hangs smiling oer green woods again The heaven rekindles all alive Wi light the may bees round the hive Swarm not so thick in mornings eye As stars do in the evening skye All all are nestling in their joys The flowers and birds and pasture boys The fire tail long a stranger comes To his last summer haunts and homes To hollow tree and crevisd wall And in the grass the rails odd call That featherd spirit stops the swain To listen to his note again And school boy still in vain retraces The secrets of his hiding places In the black thorns crowded copse Thro its varied turns and stops The nightingale its ditty weaves Hid in a multitude of leaves The boy stops short to hear the strain And ‘sweet jug jug’ he mocks again The yellow hammer builds its nest By banks where sun beams earliest rest That drys the dews from off the grass Shading it from all that pass Save the rude boy wi ferret gaze That hunts thro evry secret maze He finds its pencild eggs agen All streakd wi lines as if a pen By natures freakish hand was took To scrawl them over like a book And from these many mozzling marks The school boy names them ‘writing larks’ Bum barrels twit on bush and tree Scarse bigger then a bumble bee And in a white thorns leafy rest It builds its curious pudding-nest Wi hole beside as if a mouse Had built the little barrel house Toiling full many a lining feather And bits of grey tree moss together Amid the noisey rooky park Beneath the firdales branches dark The little golden crested wren Hangs up his gluing nest agen And sticks it to the furry leaves As martins theirs beneath the eaves The old hens leave the roost betimes And oer the garden pailing climbs To scrat the gardens fresh turnd soil And if unwatchd his crops to spoil Oft cackling from the prison yard To peck about the homclose sward Catching at butterflys and things Ere they have time to try their wings The cattle feels the breath of may And kick and toss their heads in play The ass beneath his bags of sand Oft jerks the string from leaders hand And on the road will eager stoop To pick the sprouting thistle up Oft answering on his weary way Some distant neighbours sobbing bray Dinning the ears of driving boy As if he felt a fit of joy Wi in its pinfold circle left Of all its company bereft Starvd stock no longer noising round Lone in the nooks of foddering ground Each skeleton of lingering stack By winters tempests beaten black Nodds upon props or bolt upright Stands swarthy in the summer light And oer the green grass seems to lower Like stump of old time wasted tower All that in winter lookd for hay Spread from their batterd haunts away To pick the grass or lye at lare Beneath the mild hedge shadows there Sweet month that gives a welcome call To toil and nature and to all Yet one day mid thy many joys Is dead to all its sport and noise Old may day wheres thy glorys gone All fled and left thee every one Thou comst to thy old haunts and homes Unnoticd as a stranger comes No flowers are pluckt to hail thee now Nor cotter seeks a single bough The maids no more on thy sweet morn Awake their thresholds to adorn Wi dewey flowers—May locks new come And princifeathers cluttering bloom And blue bells from the wood land moss And cowslip cucking balls to toss Above the garlands swinging hight Hang in the soft eves sober light These maid and child did yearly pull By many a folded apron full But all is past the merry song Of maidens hurrying along To crown at eve the earliest cow Is gone and dead and silent now The laugh raisd at the mawking thorn Tyd to the cows tail last that morn The kerchief at arms length displayd Held up by pairs of swain and maid While others bolted underneath Bawling loud wi panting breath ‘Duck under water’ as they ran Alls ended as they ne'er began While the new thing that took thy place Wears faded smiles upon its face And where enclosure has its birth Its spreads a mildew oer her mirth The herd no longer one by one Goes plodding on her morning way And garlands lost and sports nigh gone Leaves her like thee a common day Yet summer smiles upon thee still Wi natures sweet unalterd will And at thy births unworshipd hours Fills her green lap wi swarms of flowers To crown thee still as thou hast been Of spring and summers months the queen JUNE Now summer is in flower and natures hum Is never silent round her sultry bloom Insects as small as dust are never done Wi glittering dance and reeling in the sun And green wood fly and blossom haunting bee Are never weary of their melody Round field hedge now flowers in full glory twine Large bindweed bells wild hop and streakd woodbine That lift athirst their slender throated flowers Agape for dew falls and for honey showers These round each bush in sweet disorder run And spread their wild hues to the sultry sun Where its silk netting lace on twigs and leaves The mottld spider at eves leisure weaves That every morning meet the poets eye Like faireys dew wet dresses hung to dry The wheat swells into ear and leaves below The may month wild flowers and their gaudy show Bright carlock bluecap and corn poppy red Which in such clouds of colors widely spread That at the sun rise might to fancys eye Seem to reflect the many colord sky And leverets seat and lark and partridge nest It leaves a schoolboys height in snugger rest And oer the weeders labour overgrows Who now in merry groups each morning goes To willow skirted meads wi fork and rake The scented hay cocks in long rows to make Where their old visitors in russet brown The hay time butterflyes dance up and down And gads that teaze like whasps the timid maid And drive the herdboys cows to pond and shade Who when his dogs assistance fails to stop Is forcd his half made oaten pipes to drop And start and halloo thro the dancing heat To keep their gadding tumult from the wheat Who in their rage will dangers overlook And leap like hunters oer the pasture brook Brushing thro blossomd beans in maddening haste And stroying corn they scarce can stop to taste Labour pursues its toil in weary mood And feign woud rest wi shadows in the wood The mowing gangs bend oer the beeded grass Where oft the gipseys hungry journeying ass Will turn its wishes from the meadow paths Listning the rustle of the falling swaths The ploughman sweats along the fallow vales And down the suncrackt furrow slowly trails Oft seeking when athirst the brooks supply Where brushing eager the brinks bushes bye For coolest water he oft brakes the rest Of ring dove brooding oer its idle nest And there as loath to leave the swaily place He'll stand to breath and whipe his burning face The shepherds idle hours are over now Nor longer leaves him neath the hedgrow bough On shadow pillowd banks and lolling stile Wilds looses now their summer friends awhile Shrill whistles barking dogs and chiding scold Drive bleating sheep each morn from fallow fold To wash pits where the willow shadows lean Dashing them in their fold staind coats to clean Then turnd on sunny sward to dry agen They drove them homward to the clipping pen In hurdles pent where elm or sycamore Shut out the sun—or in some threshing floor There they wi scraps of songs and laugh and tale Lighten their anual toils while merry ale Goes round and gladdens old mens hearts to praise The thread bare customs of old farmers days Who while the sturting sheep wi trembling fears Lies neath the snipping of his harmless sheers Recalls full many a thing by bards unsung And pride forgot—that reignd when he was young How the hugh bowl was in the middle set At breakfast time as clippers yearly met Filld full of frumity where yearly swum The streaking sugar and the spotting plumb Which maids coud never to the table bring Without one rising from the merry ring To lend a hand who if twas taen amiss Woud sell his kindness for a stolen kiss The large stone pitcher in its homly trim And clouded pint horn wi its copper rim Oer which rude healths was drank in spirits high From the best broach the cellar woud supply While sung the ancient swains in homly ryhmes Songs that were pictures of the good old times When leathern bottles held the beer nut brown That wakd the sun wi songs and sung him down Thus will the old man ancient ways bewail Till toiling sheers gain ground upon the tale And brakes it off—when from the timid sheep The fleece is shorn and wi a fearfull leap He starts—while wi a pressing hand His sides are printed by the tarry brand Shaking his naked skin wi wondering joys And fresh ones are tugd in by sturdy boys Who when theyre thrown down neath the sheering swain Will wipe his brow and start his tale again Tho fashions haughty frown hath thrown aside Half the old forms simplicity supplyd Yet there are some prides winter deigns to spare Left like green ivy when the trees are bare And now when sheering of the flocks are done Some ancient customs mixd wi harmless fun Crowns the swains merry toils—the timid maid Pleasd to be praisd and yet of praise affraid Seeks her best flowers not those of woods and fields But such as every farmers garden yields Fine cabbage roses painted like her face And shining pansys trimd in golden lace And tall tuft larkheels featherd thick wi flowers And woodbines climbing oer the door in bowers And London tufts of many a mottld hue And pale pink pea and monkshood darkly blue And white and purple jiliflowers that stay Lingering in blossom summer half away And single blood walls of a lucious smell Old fashiond flowers which hus wives love so well And columbines stone blue or deep night brown Their honey-comb-like blossoms hanging down Each cottage gardens fond adopted child Tho heaths still claim them where they yet grow wild Mong their old wild companions summer blooms Furze brake and mozzling ling and golden broom Snap dragons gaping like to sleepy clowns And ‘clipping pinks’ (which maidens sunday gowns Full often wear catcht at by toying chaps) Pink as the ribbons round their snowy caps ‘Bess in her bravery’ too of glowing dyes As deep as sunsets crimson pillowd skyes And majoram notts sweet briar and ribbon grass And lavender the choice of every lass And sprigs of lads love all familiar names Which every garden thro the village claims These the maid gathers wi a coy delight And tyes them up in readiness for night Giving to every swain tween love and shame Her ‘clipping poseys’ as their yearly claim And turning as he claims the custom kiss Wi stifld smiles half ankering after bliss She shrinks away and blushing calls it rude But turns to smile and hopes to be pursued While one to whom the seeming hint applied Follows to claim it and is not denyd No doubt a lover for within his coat His nosgay owns each flower of better sort Ancl when the envious mutter oer their beer And nodd the secret to his neighbor near Raising the laugh to make the matter known She blushes silent and will not disown And ale and songs and healths and merry ways Keeps up a shadow of old farmers days But the old beachen bowl that once supplyd Its feast of frumity is thrown aside And the old freedom that was living then When masters made them merry wi their men Whose coat was like his neighbors russet brown And whose rude speech was vulgar as his clown Who in the same hour drank the rest among And joind the chorus while a labourer sung All this is past—and soon may pass away The time torn remnant of the holiday As proud distinction makes a wider space Between the genteel and the vulgar race Then must they fade as pride oer custom showers Its blighting mildew on her feeble flowers JULY Daughter of pastoral smells and sights And sultry days and dewy nights July resumes her yearly place Wi her milking maiden face Ruddy and tannd yet sweet to view When everywheres a veil of dew And raps it round her looks that smiles A lovly rest to daily toils Wi last months closing scenes and dins Her sultry beaming birth begins Hay makers still in grounds appear And some are thinning nearly clear Save oddly lingering shocks about Which the tithman counteth out Sticking their green boughs where they go The parsons yearly claims to know Which farmers view wi grudging eye And grumbling drive their waggons bye In hedge bound close and meadow plains Stript groups of busy bustling swains From all her hants wi noises rude Drives to the wood lands solitude That seeks a spot unmarkd wi paths Far from the close and meadow swaths Wi smutty song and story gay They cart the witherd smelling hay Boys loading on the waggon stand And men below wi sturdy hand Heave up the shocks on lathy prong While horse boys lead the team along And maidens drag the rake behind Wi light dress shaping to the wind And trembling locks of curly hair And snow white bosoms nearly bare That charms ones sight amid the hay Like lingering blossoms of the may From clowns rude jokes they often turn And oft their cheeks wi blushes burn From talk which to escape a sneer They oft affect as not to hear Some in the nooks about the ground Pile up the stacks swelld bellying round The milking cattles winter fare That in the snow are fodderd there Warm spots wi black thorn thickets lind And trees to brake the northern wind While masters oft the sultry hours Will urge their speed and talk of showers When boy from home trotts to the stack Wi dinner upon dobbins back And bottles to the saddle tyd Or ballancd upon either side A horse thats past his toiling day Yet still a favorite in his way That trotts on errands up and down The fields and too and fro from town Long ere his presence comes in sight Boys listen wi heart felt delight And know his footsteps down the road Hastening wi the dinner load Then they seek in close or meadows High hedgerows wi grey willow shadows To hide beneath from sultry noon And rest them at their dinner boon Where helping shepherd for the lass Will seek a hillock on the grass The thickset hedge or stack beside Where teazing pismires ne'er abide And when tis found down drops the maid Proud wi the kind attention paid And still the swain wi notice due Waits on her all the dinner through And fills her horn which she tho dry In shoyness often pushes bye While he will urge wi many a smile It as a strength to help her toil And in her hand will oft contrive From out his pocket pulld to slive Stole fruit when no one turns his eye To wet her mouth when shes adry Offerd when she refuses ale Noons sultry labour to regale Teazd wi the countless multitude Of flyes that every where intrude While boys wi boughs will often try To beat them from them as they lye Who find their labour all in vain And soon as scard they swarm again Thus while each swain and boy and lass Sit at their dinner on the grass The teams wi gears thrown on their backs Stand pulling at the shocks or racks Switching their tails and turning round To knap the gadflys teazing wound While dob that brought the dinners load Too tricky to be turnd abroad Needing the scuttle shook wi grain To coax him to be caught again Is to a tree at tether tyd Ready for boy to mount and ride Nipping the grass about his pound And stamping battering hooves around Soon as each ground is clear of hay The shepherd whoops his flocks away From fallow fields to plentys scenes Shining as smooth as bowling greens But scard wi clipping tides alarms They bleat about the close in swarms And hide neath hedges in the cool Still panting tho wi out their whool Markd wi the tard brands lasting dye And make a restless hue and cry Answering the lambs that call again And for their old dams seek in vain Running mid the stranger throng And ever meeting wi the wrong Fiegn wi some old yoe to abide Who smells and tosses them aside And some as if they knew its face Will meet a lamb wi mended pace But proving hopes indulgd in vain They turn around and blair again Till weand from memory half forgot They spread and feed and notice not Save now and then to lambs shrill crys Odd yoes in hoarser tone replys Still may be seen the mowing swain On balks between the fields of grain Who often stops his thirst to ease To pick the juicy pods of pease And oft as chances bring to pass Stoops oer his scythe stick in the grass To suck the brimming honey comb Which bees so long were toiling home And rifld from so many flowers And carried thro so many hours He tears their small hives mossy ball Where the brown labourers hurded all Who gather homward one by one And see their nest and honey gone Humming around his rushy toil Their mellancholly wrongs awhile Then oer the sweltering swaths they stray And hum disconsolate away And oft neath hedges cooler screen Where meadow sorrel lingers green Calld ‘sour grass’ by the knowing clown The mower gladly chews it down And slakes his thirst the best he may When singing brooks are far away And his hoopd bottle woeful tale Is emptied of its cheering ale That lulld him in unconscous sleep At dinners hour beneath a heap Of grass or bush or edding shock Till startld by the country clock That told the hour his toil had lost Who coud but spare an hour at most And wearing past the setting sun He stays to get his labour done The gipsey down the meadow brook Wi long pole and a reaping hook Tyd at its end amid the streams That glitters wi the hot sunbeams Reaches and cuts the bulrush down And hawks them round each neighboring town Packd at his back or tyd in loads On asses down the dusty roads He jogs and shouts from door to door His well known note of calling oer Offering to hus wives cheap repairs Mending their broken bottomd chairs Wi step half walk half dance and eye Ready to smile on passers bye Wi load well suiting weather warm Tuckd carlessly beneath his arm Or peeping coat and side between In woolen bag of faded green Half conseald and half displayd A purpose tell tale to his trade The gipsey fiddler jogs away To village feast and holiday Scraping in public house to trye What beer his music will supply From clowns who happy wi the din Dance their hard naild hilos thin Along the roads in passing crowds Followd by dust like smoaking clouds Scotch droves of beast a little breed In swelterd weary mood proceed A patient race from scottish hills To fatten by our pasture rills Lean wi the wants of mountain soil But short and stout for travels toil Wi cockd up horns and curly crown And dewlap bosom hanging down Followd by slowly pacing swains Wild to our rushy flats and plains At whom the shepherds dog will rise And shake himself and in supprise Draws back and waffles in affright Barking the traveller out of sight And mowers oer their scythes will bear Upon their uncooth dress to stare And shepherds as they trample bye Leaves oer their hooks a wondering eye To witness men so oddly clad In petticoats of banded plad Wi blankets oer their shoulders slung To camp at night the fields among When they for rest on commons stop And blue cap like a stocking top Cockt oer their faces summer brown Wi scarlet tazzeles on the crown Rude patterns of the thistle flower Unbrinkd and open to the shower And honest faces frank and free That breathe of mountain liberty Soon as the morning wakens red The shepherd startles from his bed And rocks afield his morning pace While folded sheep will know his face Rising as he appears in sight To shake their coats as in delight His shadow stalking stride for stride Stretches a jiant by his side Long as a tree without a top And oft it urges him to stop Both in his journey and his song And wonders why it seems so long And bye and bye as morning dies Shrinks to an unbrichd boy in size Then as the evening gathers blue Grows to a jiants length anew Puzzld the more he stops to pause His wisdom vainly seeks the cause Again his journey he pursues Lengthening his track along the dews And his dog that turnd to pick From his sides the sucking tick Insects that on cattle creep And bites the labourer laid asleep Pricks up his ears to see him gone And shakes his hide and hastens on And the while the shepherd stayd Trailing a track the hare had made Bolts thro the creeping hedge again And hurrying follows wi the swain The singing shouting herding boys Follows again their wild employs And ere the sun puts half his head From out his crimson pillowd bed And bawls behind his cows again That one by one lobs down the lane Wi wild weeds in his hat anew The summer sorts of every hue And twigs of leaves that please his eye To his old haunts he hallows bye Wi dog that loiters by his side Or trotts before wi nimble stride That waits till bid to bark and run And panteth from the dreaded sun And oft amid the sunny day Will join a partner in his play And in his antic tricks and glee Will prove as fond of sport as he And by the flag pool summer warm He'll watch the motions of his arm That holds a stick or stone to throw In the sun gilded flood below And head oer ears he danses in Nor fears to wet his curly skin The boys peeld cudgel to restore And brings it in his mouth ashore And eager as for crust or bone He'll run to catch the pelted stone Till wearied out he shakes his hide And drops his tail and sneaks aside Unheeding whistles shouts and calls To take a rest where thickly falls The rush clumps shadows there he lyes Licking his skin and catching flyes Or picking tween his stretching feet The bone he had not time to eat Before when wi the teazing boy He was so throngd wi plays employ Noon gathers wi its blistering breath Around and day dyes still as death The breeze is stopt the lazy bough Hath not a leaf that dances now The totter grass upon the hill And spiders threads is hanging still The feathers dropt from morehens wings Upon the waters surface clings As stedfast and as heavy seem As stones beneath them in the stream Hawkweed and groundsels fairey downs Unruffld keep their seeding crowns And in the oven heated air Not one light thing is floating there Save that to the earnest eye The restless heat swims twittering bye The swine run restless down the street Anxious some pond or ditch to meet From days hot swoonings to retire Wallowing in the weeds and mire The linnets seek the twiggs that lye Close to the brook and brig stones drye At top and sit and dip their bills Till they have drunk their little fills Then flert their wings and wet their feathers To cool them in the blazing weathers Dashing the water oer their heads Then high them to some cooling sheds Some dark wood glooms about the plain To pick their feathers smooth again The young quicks branches seem as dead And scorch from yellow into red Ere autum hath its pencil taen Their shades in different hues to stain Following behind the cranking ploughs Whiping oft their sweating brows The boys lead horses yokd in pairs To jumping harrows linkd that tears And teazes the hard clods to dust Placing for showers in hopes their trust The farmer follows sprinkling round Wi turnip seed the panting ground Providing food for beast and sheep When winters snows are falling deep Oft proving hopes and wishes vain While clouds disperse that promisd rain While soon as ere the turnip creeps From out the crust burnt soil and peeps Upon the farmers watching eye Tis eaten by the jumping flye And eager neath the midday sun Soon as each plough teams toil is done Scarse waiting till the gears are taen From off their backs by boy and swain From hay filld racks they turn away Nor in the stable care to stay Hurrying to the trough to drink Or from the yard ponds muddy brink Rush in and wi long winded soak Drink till theyre almost fit to choak And from the horsbees teazing din Thrust deep their burning noses in Almost above their greedy eyes To cool their mouths and shun the flyes Deaf to the noise the geese will make That grudge the worthy share they take Boys now neath green lanes meeting bough Each noons half holiday from plough Take out their hungry teams till night That nipp the grass wi eager bite Wi long tails switching never still They lunge neath trees when eat their fill And stamp and switch till closing day Brushing the teazing flyes away Endless labour all in vain That start in crowds to turn again When the sun is sinking down And dyes more deep the shadows brown And gradual into slumber glooms How sweet the village evening comes To weary hinds from toil releasd And panting sheep and torturd beast The shepherd long wi heat opprest Betakes him to his cottage rest And his tird dog that plods along Wi panting breath and lolling tongue Runs eager as the brook appears And dashes in head over ears Startling reed sparrow broods to flye That in the reed woods slumberd nigh And water voles in haste to hide Nibbling the sedges close beside Lapping while he floats about To quench his thirst then drabbles out And shakes his coat and like the swain Is happy night is come again The beast that to the pond did creep And rushd in water belly deep The gad flyes threatning hums to shun And horse bee darting in the sun Lashing their tails the while they stood And sprinkling thick their sides wi mud Snuff the cool air now day is gone And linger slow and idly on To the pebbly fore to drink And drop and rest upon its brink Ruminating on their beds Calm as the sky above their heads The horse whose mouth is seldom still Is up and cropping at his will The moisting grass unteazd and free In summer eves serenity Uncheckt by flyes he grazes on Right happy that the day is gone Ne'er leaving off to turn around His stooping head to knap the wound And tail that switchd his sides all day Is quiet now the suns away The cowboys as their herd plod on Before them homward one by one Grows happy as their toil grows short And full of fancys restless sport Oft struts along wi sinking day Acting proud their soldier play Wi peeld bark sash around each waist And rush caps on each beaver placd Stuck wi a head aches red cockade And wooden swords and sticks displayd For flags—thus march the evening troop While some one strikes a whistle up And others wi their dinner tins The evenings falling quiet dins Patting wi hollow sounding tums Rude imitating fifes and drums Calling their cows that plod before Their army marching from the moor And thus they act till met the town Carless of laughs from passing clown Where their dogs too tird for play Loiter on their evening way Oft rolling on the damping grass Or stopping wi the milking lass Waiting a chance the ways conseal A mouth full from her pails to steal Or dropping down to pick a bone By hedger from his wallets thrown Or found upon some greensward platt Where hay folks at their dinner sat Sweet comes the cows breath down the lane Steaming the fragrance of the plain As home they rock and bawling wait Till boys run to unloose the gate And from their milksheds all adry Turn to the pump wi anxious eye Where shoud the maids wi boys repair To fill the dashing bucket there They hurry spite of threatning clown And kick the milkers bucket down And horses oft wi eager stoop Will bend adown to steal a sup Watching a moments chance to win And dip their eager noses in As by they pass or set it down To rest or chatter to a clown And knats wi their small slender noise Bother too the troubld boys And teaze the cows that while she chides Will kick and turn to lick their sides And like so many hanting sprites Will bite and weal the maid anights Who dreams of love and sleeps so sound As ne'er to feel each little wound Till waken by the morning sun She wonders at the injury done Thinking in fears simplicity That faireys dreaded mistery On her white bosom in the dark Had been and left each blisterd mark The fox begins his stunt odd bark Down in its dew bed drops the lark And on the heath amid the gorse The night hawk sturts the feeding horse That pricks his ear wi startling eye And snorts to hear its trembling crye The owlet leaves his ivy tree And to its hive slow sails the bee The mower seeks his cloaths and hides His scythe home bent wi weary strides And oer his shoulder swings his bag Carrying in hand his empty cag Hay makers on their homward way To the fields will often stray And mong the grain when no one sees Nestle and fill their laps wi peas Sheep scard wi tweenlight doubting eye Leap the path and canter bye Nipping wi moment stoops the plain And turning quick to gaze again Till silence upon eve awaits And milkmaids cease to clap the gates And homward to the town are gone Wi whispering sweethearts chatting on And shepherds homward tracks are past And dogs rude barks are still at last Then down they drop as suits their wills Or nips the thyme on pismire hills Where nought is seen but timid hares That nights sweet welcome gladly shares And shadows stooping as they stoop Beside them when the moon gets up Reviving wi the ruddy moon The nightingale resumes his tune What time the horsboy drives away His loose teams from the toils of day To crop the closes dewy blade Where the haystacks fencd and made Or on the commons bushy plain To rest till the sun comes again Whistling and bawling loud and long The burthen of some drawling song That grows more loud as eve grows late Yet when he opes the clapping gate He cant help turning in his joys To look if his fear wakeing noise Has raisd a mischief in the wind And wakd a ghost to stalk behind And when hes turnd them safe aground And hookd the chain the gate around Wi quicker speed he homward sings And leaves them in the mushroom rings Wi the dewdrunk dancing elves To eat or rest as suits them selves And as he hastes from labour done An owlets whoop een makes him run And bats shill flickerings bobbing near Turns his heart blood cold wi fear And when at home wi partner ralph He hugs himself to think hes safe And tells his tale while others smile Of all he thought and feard the while The black house bee hath ceasd to sing And white nosd one wi out a sting That boys will catch devoid of dread Are in their little holes abed And martins neath the mossey eaves Oft startld at the sparrow thieves That in their house will often peep Breaking their little weary sleep And oft succeed when left alone In making their clay huts their own Where the cock sparrow on the scout Watches and keeps the owner out The geese have left the home close moats And at the yard gate clean their coats Or neath their feathers tuck their heads Asleep till driven to their sheds The pigeon droves in whisking flight Hurrying to their cotes ere night In coveys round the village meet And in the dove cote holes retreat Nor more about the wheaten grounds The bird boys bell and clapper sounds Retiring wi the setting sun His toil and shout and song is done The shill bat wi its flittering mate Starts thro the church vaults iron grate Deaths daily visitors and all He meets save slanting suns that fall At eve as if they lovd to shed Their daily memory oer the dead Hodge neath the climbing elms that drop Their branches oer a dove cote top Hath milkd his cows and taken in On yokes the reeking pales or tin And been across the straw to chain The hen roost wicket safe again And done his yard rounds hunting eggs And taen his hat from off the peggs To scamper to the circling cross To have a game at pitch and toss And day boy hath his supper got Of milk before twas hardly hot Eager from toil to get away And join the boys at taw to play Neath black smiths cinder litterd shed Till the hour to go to bed Old gossips on their greensward bench Sit where the hom bound milking wench Will set her buckets down to rest And be awhile their evening guest To whom their box is held while she Takes the smallest nips that be That soon as snift begins to teaze And makes her turn away to sneeze While old dames say the sign is plain That she will dream about her swain And toss the cloaths from off her bed And cautions her of roguish ned Holding their hands agen their hips To laugh as up she starts and trips In quickend speed along the town Bidding good night to passing clown From the black smiths shop the swain Jogs wi ploughshares laid again And drops them by the stable shed Where gears on pegs hang over head Ready for driving boys to take On fore horse when their toils awake The kitchen wench wi face red hot As blazing fire neath supper pot Hath cleand her pails and pansions all And set them leaning by the wall And twirld her whool mop clean again And hung it on the pales to drain Now by the maids requesting smile The shepherd mounts the wood stack pile Reard high against the orchard pales And cause of thorns she oft bewails Prickd hands and holes in sunday gown He throws the smoothest faggot down And hawls it in at her desire Ready for the kitching fire Beneath the elderns village shade Oer her well curb leans the maid To draw the brimming bucket up While passing boy to beg a sup Will stop his roll or rocking cart And the maidens gentle heart Gives ready leave—the eager clown Throws off his hat and stoops adown Soaking his fill then hastens on To catch his team already gone Eager from toil to get release And in the hay field feed at peace. The weary thresher leaves his barn And emptys from his shoes the corn That gatherd in them thro the day And homward bends his weary way The gardener he is sprinkling showers From watering pans on drooping flowers And set away his hoe and spade While goody neath the cottage shade Sits wi a baskett tween her knees Ready for supper shelling peas And cobler chatting in the town Hath put his window shutter down And the knowing parish clerk Feign to do his jobs ere dark Hath timd the church clock to the sun And wound it up for night and done And turnd the hugh kee in the door Chatting his evening story oer Up the street the servant maid Runs wi her errands long delayd And ere the door she enters in She stops to right a loosend pin And smooth wi hasty fingers down The crumpling creases in her gown Which Rogers oggles rudly made For may games forfeit never paid And seizd a kiss against her will While playing quoits upon the hill Wi other shepherds laughing nigh That made her shoy and hurry bye The blacksmiths grizly toil is oer And shut his hot shops branded door Folding up his arms to start And take at ease his evening quart And farmer giles his business done Wi face a very setting sun Jogging home on dobbins back From helping at the clover stack The horse knows well nor trys to pass The door where for his custom glass He nightly from the saddle jumps To slake his thirst or cheer the dumps Leaving old dob his breath to catch Wi bridle hanging at the latch The shepherd too will often spare A sixpence to be merry there While the dog that trackd his feet Adown the dusty printed street Lies as one weary loath to roam Agen the door to wait him home While the taylors long day thirst Is still unquenchd tho fit to burst Whose been at truants merry play From sheers and bodkin all the day Still soaks the tankard reeling ripe And scarce can stoop to light his pipe The labourer sitting by his door Happy that the day is oer Is stooping downwards to unloose His leathern baffles or his shoes Making ready for his rest Quickly to be the pillows guest While on mothers lap wi in The childern each their prayers begin That taen from play are loath to go And looking round repeating slow Each prayer they stammer in delay To gain from bed a longer stay Goody hath set her spinning bye Deafend by her chattering pye That calls her up wi hungry rage To put his supper in the cage That done she sought a neighbours door A minutes time to gossip oer And neath her apron now tis night Huddles for home, her candle light Hid from the wind—to burn an hour As clouds wi threatend thunder lower The mastiff from his kennel free Is now unchaind at liberty In readiness to put to rout The thieves that night may bring about Thus evening deepning to a close Leaves toil and nature to repose AUGUST Harvest approaches with its bustling day The wheat tans brown and barley bleaches grey In yellow garb the oat land intervenes And tawney glooms the valley thronged with beans Silent the village grows, wood wandering dreams Seem not so lonely as its quiet seems Doors are shut up as on a winters day And not a child about them lies at play The dust that winnows neath the breezes feet Is all that stirs about the silent street Fancy might think that desert spreading fear Had whisperd terrors into quiets ear Or plundering armys past the place had come And drove the lost inhabitants from home The fields now claim them where a motley crew Of old and young their daily tasks pursue The barleys beard is grey and wheat is brown And wakens toil betimes to leave the town The reapers leave their beds before the sun And gleaners follow in the toils begun To pick the littered ear the reaper leaves And glean in open fields among the sheaves The ruddy child nursed in the lap of care In toils rude strife to do his little share Beside his mother poddles oer the land Sun burnt and stooping with a weary hand Picking his tiney glean of corn or wheat While crackling stubbles wound his little feet Full glad he often is to sit awhile Upon a smooth green baulk to ease his toil And feign would spend an idle hour to play With insects strangers to the moiling day Creeping about each rush and grassy stem And often wishes he was one of them In weariness of heart that he might lye Hid in the grass from the days burning eye That raises tender blisters on his skin Thro holes or openings that have lost a pin Free from the crackling stubs to toil and glean And smiles to think how happy he had been Whilst his expecting mother stops to tye Her handful up and waiting his supply Misses the idle younker from her side And shouts of rods and morts of threats beside Pointing to the grey willows while she tells His fears shall fetch one if he still rebells Picturing harsh truths in his unpracticed eye How they who idle in the harvest lye Shall well deserving in the winter pine Or hunt the hedges with the birds and swine In vain he wishes that the rushes height Were tall as trees to hide him from her sight Leaving his pleasant seat he sighs and rubs His legs and shows scratchd wounds from piercing stubs To make excuse for play but she disdains His little wounds and smiles while he complains And as he stoops adown in troubles sore She sees his grief and bids him sob no more As bye and bye on the next sabbath day She'll give him well earned pence as well as play When he may buy almost with out a stint Sweet candied horehound cakes and pepper mint Or streaking sticks of lucious lolipop What ere he chuses from the tempting shop Wi in whose diamond window shining lyes Things of all sorts to tempt his eager eyes Rich sugar plumbs in phials shining bright In every hue young fancys to delight Coaches and ladys of gilt ginger bread And downy plumbs and apples streaked with red Such promises all sorrows soon displace And smiles are instant kindled in his face Scorning all troubles which he felt before He picks the trailing ears and mourns no more The fields are all alive with sultry noise Of labours sounds and insects busy joys Some oer their glittering sickles stoop Startling full oft the partridge coveys up Some oer the rustling scythe go bending on And shockers follow where their toils have gone First turning swaths to wither in the sun Where mice from terrors dangers nimbly run Leaving their tender young in fears alarm Lapt up in nests of chimbled grasses warm And oft themselves for safty search in vain From the rude boy or churlish hearted swain Who beat their stone chinkd forks about the ground And spread an instant murder all around Tho oft the anxious maidens tender prayer Urges the clown their little lives to spare Who sighs while trailing the long rake along At scenes so cruel and forgets her song And stays wi love his murder aiming hand Some ted the puffing winnow down the land And others following roll them up in heaps While cleanly as a barn door beesom sweeps The aching drag wi weeds entwind And swinging rakers toil behind When the sun stoops to meet the western sky And noons hot hours have wanderd weary bye They seek an awthorn bush or willow tree Or stouk or shock where coolest shadows be Where baskets heapd and unbroached bottles lye Which dogs in absence watchd with wary eye To catch their breath awhile and share the boon Which beavering time alows their toil at noon All gathering sit on stubbs or sheaves the hour Where scarlet poppys linger still in flower Stript in his shirt the hot swain drops adown And close beside him in her unpind gown Next to her favoured swain the maiden steals Blushing at kindness which her love reveals Who makes a seat for her of things around And drops beside her on the naked ground Wearied wi brambles catching at her gown And pulling nutts from branches pulld adown By fondling swain the maid wi heaving breast Upon her lovers shoulder leans at rest Then from its cool retreat the beer they bring And hand the stout hooped bottle round the ring Each swain soaks hard—the maiden ere she sips Shrieks at the bold whasp settling on her lips That seems determined only hers to greet As if it fancied they were cherrys sweet So dog forgoes his sleep awhile or play Springing at frogs that rustling jump away To watch each morsel that the boon bestows And wait the bone or crust the shepherd throws For shepherds are no more of ease possest But share the harvests labours with the rest When day declines and labour meets repose The bawling boy his evening journey goes At toils unwearied call the first and last He drives his horses to their nights repast In dewey close or meadow to sojourn And often ventures on his still return Oer garden pales or orchard walls to hie When sleeps safe key hath locked up dangers eye All but the mastiff watching in the dark Who snuffts and knows him and forbears to bark With fearful haste he climbs each loaded tree And picks for prizes which the ripest be Pears plumbs or filberts covered oer in leams While the pale moon creeps high in peaceful dreams And oer his harvest theft in jealous light Fills empty shadows with the power to fright And owlet screaming as it bounces nigh That from some barn hole pops and hurries bye Scard at the cat upon her nightly watch For rats that come for dew upon the thatch He hears the noise and trembling to escape While every object grows a dismal shape Drops from the tree in fancys swiftest dread By ghosts pursued and scampers home to bed Quick tumbling oer the mossy mouldering wall And looses half his booty in the fall Where soon as ere the morning opes its eyes The restless hogs will happen on the prize And crump adown the mellow and the green And makes all seem as nothing ne'er had been Amid the broils of harvests weary reign How sweet the sabbath wakes its rest again And on each weary mind what rapture dwells To hear once more its pleasant chiming bells That from each steeple peeping here and there Murmur a soothing lullaby to care The shepherd journying on his morning rounds Pauses awhile to hear their pleasing sounds While the glad childern free from toils employ Mimic the ding dong sounds and laugh for joy The fields them selves seem happy to be free Where insects chatter with unusual glee While solitude the stubbs and grass among Appears to muse and listen to the song In quiet peace awakes the welcomed morn Men tired and childern with their gleaning worn Weary and stiff lye round their doors the day To rest themselves with little heart for play No more keck horns in homestead close resounds As in their school boy days at hare and hounds Nor running oer the street from wall to wall With eager shouts at ‘cuck and catch the ball’ In calm delight the sabbath wears along Yet round the cross at noon a tempted throng Of little younkers with their pence repair To buy the downy plumb and lucious pear That melt i' th mouth—which gardners never fail For gains strong impulse to expose for sale And on the circling cross steps in the sun Sit when the parson has his sermon done When gardners that against his rules rebell Come wi their baskets heapd wi fruit to sell That thither all the season did pursue Wi mellow goosberrys of every hue Green ruffs and raspberry reds and drops of gold That makes mouths water often to behold Sold out to clowns in totts oft deemd too small Who grudging much the price eat husks and all Nor leaves a fragment round to cheer the eye Of searching swine that murmurs hungry bye And currans red and white on cabbage leaves While childerns fingers itches to be thieves And black red cherrys shining to the sight As rich as brandy held before the light Now these are past he still as sunday comes Sits on the cross wi baskets heapd wi plumbs And Jenitens streakd apples suggar sweet Others spice scented ripening wi the wheat And pears that melt ith' mouth like honey which He oft declares to make their spirits itch They are so juicy ripe and better still So rich they een might suck em thro a quill Here at their leisure gather many a clown To talk of grain and news about the town And here the boy wi toils earnd penny comes In hurrying speed to purchase pears or plumbs And oer the basket hangs wi many a smile Wi hat in hand to hold his prize the while Not so the boys that begs for pence in vain Of deaf eard dames that threat while they complain Who talk of the good dinners they have eat And wanting more as nothing but consiet Vowing they ne'er shall throw good pence away So bids them off and be content wi play Reaching her rod that hangs the chimney oer And scaring their rude whinings to the door Who sob aloud and hang their hats adown To hide their tears and sawn along the town Venturing wi sullen step his basket nigh And often dipping a desiring eye Stone hearted dames thrifts errors to believe Who make their little bellys yearn to thieve But strong temptation must to fears resign For close beside the stocks in terror shine So choaking substitutes for loss of pelf He keeps his longing fingers to himself And mopes and sits the sabbath hours away Wi heart too weary and too sad for play So sundays scenes and leisure passes bye In rests soft peace and home tranquillity Till monday morning doth its cares pursue And wakes the harvests busy toils anew SEPTEMBER Harvest awakes the morning still And toils rude groups the valleys fill Deserted is each cottage hearth To all life save the crickets mirth Each burring wheel their sabbath meets Nor walks a gossip in the streets The bench beneath its eldern bough Lined oer with grass is empty now Where black birds caged from out the sun Would whistle while their mistress spun All haunt the thronged fields still to share The harvests lingering bounty there As yet no meddling boys resort About the streets in idle sport The butterflye enjoys his hour And flirts unchaced from flower to flower And humming bees that morning calls From out the low huts mortar walls Which passing boy no more controuls Flye undisturbed about their holes And sparrows in glad chirpings meet Unpelted in the quiet street None but imprison'd childern now Are seen where dames with angry brow Threaten each younker to his seat That thro' the school door eyes the street Or from his horn book turns away To mourn for liberty and play Loud are the mornings early sounds That farm and cottage yard surrounds The creaking noise of opening gate And clanking pumps where boys await With idle motion to supply The thirst of cattle crowding bye The low of cows and bark of dogs And cackling hens and wineing hogs Swell high—while at the noise awoke Old goody seeks her milking cloak And hastens out to milk the cow And fill the troughs to feed the sow Or seeking old hens laid astray Or from young chickens drives away The circling kite that round them flyes Waiting the chance to seize the prize Hogs trye thro gates the street to gain And steal into the fields of grain From nights dull prison comes the duck Waddling eager thro the muck Squeezing thro the orchard pales Where mornings bounty rarely fails Eager gobbling as they pass Dew worms thro the padded grass Where blushing apples round and red Load down the boughs and pat the head Of longing maid that hither goes To hang on lines the drying cloaths Who views them oft with tempted eye And steals one as she passes bye Where the holly oak so tall Far oer tops the garden wall That latest blooms for bees provide Hived on stone benches close beside The bees their teazing music hum And threaten war to all that come Save the old dame whose jealous care Places a trapping bottle there Filled with mock sweets in whose disguise The honey loving hornet dies Upon the dovecotes mossy slates The piegons coo around their mates And beside the stable wall Where morns sunbeams early fall Basking hens in playfull rout Flap the smoaking dust about In the barn hole sits the cat Watching within the thirsty rat Who oft at morn its dwelling leaves To drink the moisture from the eaves The redbreast with his nimble eye Dare scarcely stop to catch the flye That tangled in the spiders snare Mourns in vain for freedom there The dog beside the threshold lyes Mocking sleep with half shut eyes With head crouched down upon his feet Till strangers pass his sunny seat Then quick he pricks his ears to hark And bustles up to growl and bark While boys in fear stop short their song And sneak on hurrys fears along And beggar creeping like a snail To make his hungry hopes prevail Oer the warm heart of charity Leaves his lame halt and hastens bye The maid afield now leaves the farm With brimming bottles on her arm Loitering unseen in narrow lane To be oer took by following swain Who happy thus her truth to prove Carrys the load and talks of love Full soon the harvest waggons sound Rumbling like thunder all around In ceasless speed the corn to load Hurrying down the dusty road While driving boy with eager eye Watches the church clock passing bye Whose gilt hands glitter in the sun To see how far the hours have run Right happly in the breathless day To see it wearing fast away Yet now and then a sudden shower Will bring to toil a resting hour When under sheltering shocks—a crowd Of merry voices mingle loud Wearing the short lived boon along With vulgar tale and merry song Draining with leisures laughing eye Each welcome bubbling bottle drye Till peeping suns dry up the rain Then off they start to toil again Anon the fields are wearing clear And glad sounds hum in labours ear When childern halo ‘here they come’ And run to meet the harvest home Stuck thick with boughs and thronged with boys Who mingle loud a merry noise Glad that the harvests end is nigh And weary labour nearly bye Where when they meet the stack thronged yard Cross bunns or pence their shouts reward Then comes the harvest supper night Which rustics welcome with delight When merry game and tiresome tale And songs increasing with the ale Their mingled up roar interpose To crown the harvests happy close While rural mirth that there abides Laughs till she almost cracks her sides Now harvests busy hum declines And labour half its help resigns Boys glad at heart to play return The shepherds to their peace sojourn Rush bosomed solitudes among Which busy toil disturbed so long The gossip happy all is oer Visits again her neighbours door For scandals idle tales to dwell Which harvest had no time to tell And free from all its sultry strife Enjoy once more their idle life Some that waining toil reprieves Thread the forrests sea of leaves Where the pheasant loves to hide And the darkest glooms abide Neath the old oaks mossed and grey Whose shadows seem as old as they Where time hath many seasons won Since aught beneath them saw the sun Within these bramble solitudes The ragged noisey boy intrudes To gather nuts that ripe and brown As soon as shook will patter down Thus harvest ends its busy reign And leaves the fields their peace again Where autumns shadows idly muse And tinge the trees with many hues Amid whose scenes I'm feign to dwell And sing of what I love so well But hollow winds and tumbling floods And humming showers and moaning woods All startle into sudden strife And wake a mighty lay to life Making amid their strains divine All songs in vain so mean as mine OCTOBER Nature now spreads around in dreary hue A pall to cover all that summer knew Yet in the poets solitary way Some pleasing objects for his praise delay Somthing that makes him pause and turn again As every trifle will his eye detain The free horse rustling thro the stubble field And cows at lare in rushes half conscealed With groups of restless sheep who feed their fill Oer cleard fields rambling where so ere they will The geese flock gabbling in the splashy fields And quacking ducks in pondweeds half conseald Or seeking worms along the homclose sward Right glad of freedom from the prison yard While every cart rut dribbles its low tide And every hollow splashy sports provide The hedger stopping gaps amid the leaves That oer his head in every color weaves The milk maid stepping with a timid look From stone to stone across the brimming brook The cotter journying wi his noisey swine Along the wood ride where the brambles twine Shaking from dinted cups the acorns brown And from the hedges red awes dashing down And nutters rustling in the yellow woods Still scare the wild things from their solitudes And squirrels secret toils oer winter dreams Picking the brown nuts from the yellow leams And hunters from the thickets avenue In scarlet jackets startling on the view Skiming a moment oer the russet plain Then hiding in the colord woods again The ploping guns sharp momentary shock Which eccho bustles from her cave to mock The inly pleased tho solitary boy Journeying and muttering oer his dreams of joy Haunting the hedges for the wilding fruit Of sloe or black berry just as fancys suit The sticking groups in many a ragged set Brushing the woods their harmless loads to get And gipseys camps in some snug shelterd nook Where old lane hedges like the pasture brook Run crooking as they will by wood and dell In such lone spots these wild wood roamers dwell On commons where no farmers claims appear Nor tyrant justice rides to interfere Such the abodes neath hedge or spreading oak And but discoverd by its curling smoak Puffing and peeping up as wills the breeze Between the branches of the colord trees Such are the pictures that october yields To please the poet as he walks the fields While nature like fair woman in decay Which pale consumption hourly wastes away Upon her waining features pale and chill Wears dreams of beauty that seem lovely still Among the heath furze still delights to dwell Quaking as if with cold the harvest bell The mushroom buttons each moist morning brings Like spots of snow in the green tawney rings And fuzz balls swelld like bladders in the grass Which oft the merry laughing milking lass Will stoop to gather in her sportive airs And slive in mimickd fondness unawares To smut the brown cheek of the teazing swain With the black powder which their balls contain Who feigns offence at first that love may speed Then claims a kiss to recompence the deed The singing maid in fancy ever gay Loitering along the mornings dripping way With wicker basket swinging on her arm Searching the hedges of home close or farm Where brashy eldern trees to autumn fade Wild shines the hedge in autumns gay parade The glossy berrys picturesquely weaves Their swathy bunches mid the yellow leaves Where the pert sparrow stains his little bill And tutling robin picks his meals at will Black ripening to the wan suns misty ray Here the industrious hus wives wend their way Pulling the brittle branches carefull down And hawking loads of berrys to the town While village dames as they get ripe and fine Repair to pluck them for their ‘eldern wine’ That bottld up becomes a rousing charm To kindle winters icy bosom warm That wi its merry partner nut brown beer Makes up the peasants christmass keeping cheer Like to a painted map the landscape lies And wild above shine the cloud thronged skies The flying clouds urged on in swiftest pace Like living things as if they runned a race The winds that oer each coming tempest broods Waking like spirits in their startling moods Fluttering the sear leaves on the blackning lea That litters under every fading tree And pausing oft as falls the patting rain Then gathering strength and twirling them again Till drops the sudden calm—the hurried mill Is stopt at once and every noise is still The startld stockdove hurried wizzing bye As the still hawk hangs oer him in the sky Crows from the oak trees quawking as they spring Dashing the acorns down wi beating wing Waking the woodlands sleep in noises low Patting the crimpt brakes withering brown below The starnel crowds that dim the muddy light And puddock circling round its lazy flight Round the wild sweeing wood in motion slow Before it perches on the oaks below And hugh black beetles revelling alone In the dull evening with their heavy drone Buzzing from barn door straw and hovel sides Where fodderd cattle from the night abides These pictures linger thro the shortning day And cheer the lone bards mellancholy way Till surly Winter comes with biting breath And strips the woods and numbs the scene with death Then all is still oer wood and field and plain As nought had been and nought would be again NOVEMBER The village sleeps in mist from morn till noon And if the sun wades thro tis wi a face Beamless and pale and round as if the moon When done the journey of its nightly race Had found him sleeping and supplyd his place For days the shepherds in the fields may be Nor mark a patch of sky—blind fold they trace The plains that seem wi out a bush or tree Wistling aloud by guess to flocks they cannot see The timid hare seems half its fears to loose Crouching and sleeping neath its grassy lare And scarely startles tho the shepherd goes Close by its home and dogs are barking there The wild colt only turns around to stare At passers bye then naps his hide again And moody crows beside the road forbeer To flye tho pelted by the passing swain Thus day seems turned to night and trys to wake in vain The Owlet leaves her hiding place at noon And flaps her grey wings in the doubting light The hoarse jay screams to see her out so soon And small birds chirp and startle with affright Much doth it scare the superstitious wight Who dreams of sorry luck and sore dismay While cow boys think the day a dream of night And oft grow fearful on their lonly way Who fancy ghosts may wake and leave their graves by day The cleanly maiden thro the village streets In pattens clicks down causways never drye While eaves above head drops—where oft she meets The school boy leering on wi mischiefs eye Trying to splash her as he hurrys bye While swains afield returning to their ploughs Their passing aid wi gentle speech apply And much loves rapture thrills when she alows Their help wi offerd hand to lead her oer the sloughs The hedger soakd wi the dull weather chops On at his toils which scarcly keeps him warm And every stroke he takes large swarms of drops Patter about him like an april storm The sticking dame wi cloak upon her arm To guard against a storm walks the wet leas Of willow groves or hedges round the farm Picking up aught her splashy wanderings sees Dead sticks the sudden winds have shook from off the trees The boy that scareth from the spirey wheat The mellancholy crow—quakes while he weaves Beneath the ivey tree a hut and seat Of rustling flags and sedges tyd in sheaves Or from nigh stubble shocks a shelter thieves There he doth dithering sit or entertain His leisure hours down hedges lost to leaves While spying nests where he spring eggs hath taen He wishes in his heart twas summer time again And oft he'll clamber up a sweeing tree To see the scarlet hunter hurry bye And feign woud in their merry uproar be But sullen labour hath its tethering tye Crows swop around and some on bushes nigh Watch for a chance when ere he turns away To settle down their hunger to supply From morn to eve his toil demands his stay Save now and then an hour which leisure steals for play Gaunt grey hounds now their coursing sports impart Wi long legs stretchd on tip toe for the chase And short loose ear and eye upon the start Swift as the wind their motions they unlace When bobs the hare up from her hiding place Who in its furry coat of fallow stain Squats on the lands or wi a dodging pace Tryes its old coverts of wood grass to gain And oft by cunning ways makes all their speed in vain Dull for a time the slumbering weather flings Its murky prison round then winds wake loud Wi sudden start the once still forest sings Winters returning song cloud races cloud And the orison throws away its shrowd And sweeps its stretching circle from the eye Storm upon storm in quick succession crowd And oer the samness of the purple skye Heaven paints its wild irregularity The shepherd oft foretells by simple ways The weathers change that will ere long prevail He marks the dull ass that grows wild and brays And sees the old cows gad adown the vale A summer race and snuff the coming gale The old dame sees her cat wi fears alarm Play hurly burly races wi its tale And while she stops her wheel her hands to warm She rubs her shooting corns and prophecys a storm Morts are the signs—the stone hid toad will croak And gobbling turkey cock wi noises vile Dropping his snout as flaming as a cloak Loose as a red rag oer his beak the while Urging the dame to turn her round and smile To see his uncooth pride her cloaths attack Sidling wi wings hung down in vapourey broil And feathers ruffld up while oer his back His tail spreads like a fan cross wavd wi bars of black The hog sturts round the stye and champs the straw And bolts about as if a dog was bye The steer will cease its gulping cud to chew And toss his head wi wild and startld eye At windshook straws—the geese will noise and flye Like wild ones to the pond—wi matted mane The cart horse squeals and kicks his partner nigh While leaning oer his fork the foddering swain The uproar marks around and dreams of wind and rain And quick it comes among the forest oaks Wi sobbing ebbs and uproar gathering high The scard hoarse raven on its cradle croaks And stock dove flocks in startld terrors flye While the blue hawk hangs oer them in the skye The shepherd happy when the day is done Hastes to his evening fire his cloaths to dry And forrester crouchd down the storm to shun Scarce hears amid the strife the poachers muttering gun The ploughman hears the sudden storm begin And hies for shelter from his naked toil Buttoning his doublet closer to his chin He speeds him hasty oer the elting soil While clouds above him in wild fury boil And winds drive heavily the beating rain He turns his back to catch his breath awhile Then ekes his speed and faces it again To seek the shepherds hut beside the rushy plain Oft stripping cottages and barns of thack Where startld farmer garnerd up his grain And wheat and bean and oat and barley stack Leaving them open to the beating rain The husbandman grieves oer his loss in vain And sparrows mourn their night nests spoild and bare The thackers they resume their toils again And stubbornly the tall red ladders bare While to oerweight the wind they hang old harrows there Thus wears the month along in checkerd moods Sunshine and shadow tempests loud and calms One hour dyes silent oer the sleepy woods The next wakes loud with unexpected storms A dreary nakedness the field deforms Yet many rural sounds and rural sights Live in the village still about the farms Where toils rude uproar hums from morn till night Noises in which the ear of industry delights: Hoarse noise of field-free bull that strides ahead Of the tail switching herd to feed again The barking mastiff from his kennel bed Urging his teazing noise at passing swain The jostling rumble of the sturting wain From the farm yard where freedoms chance to wait The turkey drops his snout—and geese in vain Noise at the signal of the opening gate Then from the clowns whip flyes and finds the chance too late The pigeon wi its breast of many hues That spangles to the sun turns round and round About his timid sidling mate and croos Upon the cottage ridge where oer their heads The puddock sails oft swopping oer the pen Where timid chickens from their parent stray That skulk and scutter neath her wings agen Nor peeps no more till they have saild away Such rural sounds the mornings tongue renews And rural sights swarm on the rustics eye The billy goat shakes from his beard the dews And jumps the wall wi carting teams to hie Upon the barn rig at their freedom flye The spotted guiney fowl—hogs in the stye Agen the door in rooting whinings stand The freed colt drops his head and gallops bye The boy that holds a scuttle in his hand Prefering unto toil the commons rushy land At length the noise of busy toil is still And industry awhile her care forgoes When winter comes in earnest to fulfill Her yearly task at bleak novembers close And stops the plough and hides the field in snows When frost locks up the streams in chill delay And mellows on the hedge the purple sloes For little birds—then toil hath time for play And nought but threshers flails awake the dreary day DECEMBER CHRISTMASS Christmass is come and every hearth Makes room to give him welcome now Een want will dry its tears in mirth And crown him wi a holly bough Tho tramping neath a winter sky Oer snow track paths and ryhmey stiles The hus wife sets her spining bye And bids him welcome wi her smiles Each house is swept the day before And windows stuck wi evergreens The snow is beesomd from the door And comfort crowns the cottage scenes Gilt holly wi its thorny pricks And yew and box wi berrys small These deck the unusd candlesticks And pictures hanging by the wall Neighbours resume their anual cheer Wishing wi smiles and spirits high Glad christmass and a happy new year To every morning passer bye Milk maids their christmass journeys go Accompanyd wi favourd swain And childern pace the crumping snow To taste their grannys cake again Hung wi the ivys veining bough The ash trees round the cottage farm Are often stript of branches now The cotters christmass hearth to warm He swings and twists his hazel band And lops them off wi sharpend hook And oft brings ivy in his hand To decorate his chimney nook Old winter whipes his icles bye And warms his fingers till he smiles Where cottage hearths are blazing high And labour resteth from his toils Wi merry mirth beguiling care Old customs keeping wi the day Friends meet their christmass cheer to share And pass it in a harmless way Old customs O I love the sound However simple they may be What ere wi time has sanction found Is welcome and is dear to me Pride grows above simplicity And spurns it from her haughty mind And soon the poets song will be The only refuge they can find The shepherd now no more afraid Since custom doth the chance bestow Starts up to kiss the giggling maid Beneath the branch of mizzletoe That neath each cottage beam is seen Wi pearl-like-berrys shining gay The shadow still of what hath been Which fashion yearly fades away And singers too a merry throng At early morn wi simple skill Yet imitate the angels song And chant their christmass ditty still And mid the storm that dies and swells By fits—in humings softly steals The music of the village bells Ringing round their merry peals And when its past a merry crew Bedeckt in masks and ribbons gay The ‘Morrice dance’ their sports renew And act their winter evening play The clown-turnd-kings for penny praise Storm wi the actors strut and swell And harlequin a laugh to raise Wears his hump back and tinkling bell And oft for pence and spicy ale Wi winter nosgays pind before The wassail singer tells her tale And drawls her christmass carrols oer The prentice boy wi ruddy face And ryhme bepowderd dancing locks From door to door wi happy pace Runs round to claim his ‘christmass box’ The block behind the fire is put To sanction customs old desires And many a faggots bands are cut For the old farmers christmass fires Where loud tongd gladness joins the throng And winter meets the warmth of may Feeling by times the heat too strong And rubs his shins and draws away While snows the window panes bedim The fire curls up a sunny charm Where creaming oer the pitchers rim The flowering ale is set to warm Mirth full of joy as summer bees Sits there its pleasures to impart While childern tween their parents knees Sing scraps of carrols oer by heart And some to view the winter weathers Climb up the window seat wi glee Likening the snow to falling feathers In fancys infant extacy Laughing wi superstitions love Oer visions wild that youth supplyes Of people pulling geese above And keeping christmass in the skyes As tho the homstead trees were drest In lieu of snow wi dancing leaves As tho the sun dryd martins nest Instead of icles hung the eaves The childern hail the happy day As if the snow was april grass And pleasd as neath the warmth of may Sport oer the water froze to glass Thou day of happy sound and mirth That long wi childish memory stays How blest around the cottage hearth I met thee in my boyish days Harping wi raptures dreaming joys Oer presents that thy coming found The welcome sight of little toys The christmass gifts of commers round The wooden horse wi arching head Drawn upon wheels around the room The gilded coach of ginger bread And many colord sugar plumb Gilt coverd books for pictures sought Or storys childhood loves to tell Wi many a urgent promise bought To get tomorrows lesson well And many a thing a minutes sport Left broken on the sanded floor When we woud leave our play and court Our parents promises for more Tho manhood bids such raptures dye And throws such toys away as vain Yet memory loves to turn her eye And talk such pleasures oer again Around the glowing hearth at night The harmless laugh and winter tale Goes round—while parting friends delight To toast each other oer their ale The cotter oft wi quiet zeal Will musing oer his bible lean While in the dark the lovers steal To kiss and toy behind the screen The yule cake dotted thick wi plumbs Is on each supper table found And cats look up for falling crumbs Which greedy childern litter round And hus wifes sage stuffd seasond chine Long hung in chimney nook to drye And boiling eldern berry wine To drink the christmass eves ‘good bye’ JULY [SECOND VERSION] July the month of summers prime Again resumes her busy time Scythes tinkle in each grassy dell Where solitude was wont to dwell And meadows they are mad with noise Of laughing maids and shouting boys Making up the withering hay With merry hearts as light as play The very insects on the ground So nimbly bustle all around Among the grass or dusty soil They seem partakers in the toil The very landscap reels with life While mid the busy stir and strife Of industry the shepherd still Enjoys his summer dreams at will Bent oer his hook or listless laid Beneath the pastures willow shade Whose foliage shines so cool and grey Amid the sultry hues of day As if the mornings misty veil Yet lingered in their shadows pale Or lolling in a musing mood On mounds where saxon castles stood Upon whose deeply buried walls The ivyed oaks dark shadow falls Oft picking up with wondering gaze Some little thing of other days Saved from the wreck of time—as beads Or broken pots among the weeds Of curious shapes—and many a stone Of roman pavements thickly sown Oft hoping as he searches round That buried riches may be found Tho search as often as he will His hopes are dissapointed still And marking oft upon his seat The insect world beneath his feet In busy motion here and there Like visitors to feast or fair Some climbing up the rushes stem A steeples height or more to them With speed that sees no fear to drop Till perched upon its spirey top Where they awhile the view survey Then prune their wings and flit away Others journying too and fro Throng the grassy woods below Musing as if they felt and knew The pleasant scenes they wandered thro Where each bent round them seems to be A hugh and massive timber tree While pismires from their castles come In crowds to seek the litterd crumb Which he on purpose drops that they May hawl the heavy loads away Shaping the while their dark employs To his own visionary joys Picturing such a life as theirs As free from summers sweating cares And inly wishing that his own Coud meet with joys so thickly sown He thinks sport all that they pursue And play the all they have to do The cowboy still cuts short the day Mingling mischief with his play Oft in the pond with weeds oer grown Hurling quick the plashing stone To cheat his dog who watching lies And instant plunges for the prize And tho each effort proves as vain He shakes his coat and dives again Till wearied with the fruitless play Then drops his tail and sneaks away Nor longer heeds the bawling boy Who seeks new sports with added joy And on some banks oer hanging brow Beats the whasps nest with a bough Till armys from the hole appear And threaten vengance in his ear With such determined hue and cry As makes the bold besiegers flye Elsewhere fresh mischief to renew And still his teazing sports pursue Pelting with excessive glee The squirrel on the wood land tree Who nimbles round from grain to grain And cocks his tail and peeps again Half pleased as if he thought the fray Which mischief made was meant for play Till scared and startled into flight He instant hurries out of sight Thus he his leisure hour employs And feeds on busy meddling joys While in the willow shaded pool His cattle stand their hides to cool Loud is the summers busy song The smallest breeze can find a tongue Where insects of each tiney size Grow teazing with their melodys Till noon burns with its blistering breath Around and day dyes still as death The busy noise of man and brute Is on a sudden lost and mute The cuckoo singing as she flies No more to mocking boy replys Even the brook that leaps along Seems weary of its bubbling song And so soft its waters creep Tired silence sinks in sounder sleep The cricket on its banks is dumb The very flies forget to hum And save the waggon rocking round The lanscape sleeps without a sound The breeze is stopt the lazy bough Hath not a leaf that dances now The totter grass upon the hill And spiders threads are standing still The feathers dropt from more hens wing Which to the waters surface cling Are stedfast and as heavy seem As stones beneath them in the stream Hawkweeds and Groundsells fanning downs Unruffled keep their seedy crowns And in the oven heated air Not one light thing is floating there —Save that to the earnest eye The restless heat seems twittering bye Noon swoons beneath the heat it made And flowers een wither in the shade Untill the sun slopes in the west Like weary traveler glad to rest On pillard clouds of many hues Then natures voice its joy renews And checkerd field and grassy plain Hum with their summer songs again A requiem to the days decline Whose setting sun beams cooly shine As welcome to days feeble powers As evening dews on thirsty flowers Now to the pleasant pasture dells Where hay from closes sweetly smells Adown the pathways narrow lane The milking maiden hies again With scraps of ballads never dumb And rosey cheeks of happy bloom Tanned brown by sumers rude embrace That adds new beautys to her face And red lips never paled with sighs And flowing hair and laughing eyes That oer full many a heart prevailed And swelling bosom loosly veiled White as the love it harbours there Unsullied with the taints of care The mower gives his labour oer And on his bench beside the door Sits down to see his childern play Or smokes his leisure hour away While from her cage the black bird sings That on the wood bine arbour hings And all with happy joys recieve The quiet of a summers eve</field>
