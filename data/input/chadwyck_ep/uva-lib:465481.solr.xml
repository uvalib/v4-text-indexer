      <field name="fulltext">[This little Book, my God and King] 1 This little Book, my God and King, The first fruits of my Muse, I bring Unto thy Throne, an Offering. 2 'Twould look more lovely, I confess, Were it attir'd in the dress Of abler Pens, than in my Verse; 3 But since my Numbers could not flow In loftier Strains, than here they do, For Reasons Thou and I do know: 4 Accept the Present; though it be Too mean a Gift for Majesty, Lord, 'tis my All, and due to Thee. A SACRED POEM. The Birth of S. John and the most holy Jesus, Luke the first. Since there are many who have undertook, Of those great Wonders, to compile a Book, Which of late years were in this Nation done, Just in that order as they were made known To them, by those who at the same time were Eye-witnesses of what they did declare; To me, who from the first have understood Exactly sev'ral things, it seemed good, To write, Divine Theophilus, to thee, This following matter, as 'twas told to me: That thou the truth of all those things may'st know, Which I suppose was taught thee long ago. In Herod's days, who King of Jewry was, There liv'd a sacred Priest call'd Zacha'ras, One of Abia's Course; he had to Wife Elizabeth, of an Exemplar life The Virgin was, before she knew his Bed; Nor was she less devout when married. Both righteous were; both blamelesly did live, In all those Laws God to the Jews did give. No Child they had, nor e're were like to have; Elizabeth too old was to Conceive. It came to pass, while that he went to burn Within the Temple Incense in his turn, Before the Lord, and all the People were Without devoutly on their knees at Pray'r; On the right hand o'th' flaming Altar he Perceiv'd an Angel of the Lord to be: His aged Limbs, scar'd at the Vision, shook; Trembling he stood, until the Angel spoke. The Promise of John's Birth and Office. Fear not, said he, thy Prayers are heard; a Son Thy Wife shall bear, and thou shalt call him John: Thousands of hearts glad at his birth shall be, As well as thou, and praise the Lord with thee. He shall be great in the Almighty's sight, For abstinence a perfect Nazarite; Not tasting Drink that's strong, nor any Wine; Endu'd early with the Spirit Divine: Many of Isr'el's Children to the Lord Shall be converted by his pow'rful Word. He shall before the true Messiah go, I'th' Pow'r and Spirit of Elijah; so That he shall make the Ceremonious Jews Admire Justice, and her Paths to chuse; And so prepare them to be wise, that they Shall Christ receive, and his Commands obey. How shall I know, since I am now grown old, Said Zacharias, what thou hast foretold Shall come to pass? my Wife is likewise known, Through heatless age, past hopes to have a Son. Gabriel's my name; by the great God's command, Before whose sacred presence I do stand, With these glad Tydings I am sent to thee; But since thou faithless art, and wilt not be Perswaded of the truth of what I say, Deaf shalt thou be, and dumb, until that day Thine aged Wife shall bring forth to thy joy, From her now barren Womb, this promis'd Boy. Long did the People, with amazement, wait For Zacharias, at the Temple Gate: Forth at the length the aged Priest did come, Deaf, as the Angel said, and likewise dumb; Soon they perceiv'd something reveal'd had been By a wing'd Herald, which he there had seen: Beck'ning he stood, but could not for his heart, What he had heard and seen to them impart. The Conception of S. John Baptist. It came to pass, so soon as he had done His priestly Office, and the Crowd was gone, The silent Priest departed to his home, And streight his Wife receiv'd a pregnant Womb. Five Months from home, not willing to abide The People's Censure, she withdrew aside; Although, assur'd she was, her marr'age Bed Was never stain'd with a disloyal deed. She knew this Mercy in her aged days, Was an unwonted Gift; and so gave praise Unto the Lord, who had remov'd that day From her the shame of barrenness away. In the sixth Month the glorious Gabriel came From the Almighty, to a Town, whose name Was Nazareth; within whose happy Wall There liv'd a Virgin, whom they Mary call: Youthful and florid, as the blooming-May, Devout and piously imploy'd each day; Of Body chast, and humble too in mind, In whom all Heavenly Graces brightly shin'd. She was betroth'd to Joseph for a Wife; A man all just, and of a pious life: And was descended from that valiant King Who Isr'el freed with a smooth Stone and Sling. To her the Angel came, as she alone On bended Knees was praying to the Throne Of the great God, and thus to her he said: The Salutation. Hail, thou most lovely person, happy Maid! The Lord is with thee; thou art highly blest; Of all thy Sex thou art the happiest. When she beheld the glorious Messenger, Who in this manner had saluted her; A Rosy Blush diffus'd it self all o're Her lovely Face, and shame-fac'd on the Flore She cast her Eyes, troubled, and in her mind seeking th'importance of his words to find; But while she musing was, silence he broke, And thus the borrow'd Form to Mary spoke. The Promise of Conception of the most Holy Jesus. Fear not, thou lovely Maid; from Heavens King, Before whose Face thou hast found Grace, I bring Most joyful news; Thou shalt conceive a Son, Who shall to Isr'el bring Salvation: Him thou shalt Jesus call; he great shall be, The happy product of Divinity. He shall his Father David's Throne ascend; His Scepter over Isr'el shall extend: Of his Dominion there shall be no end. To him the Rulers of the Earth shall bring Their borrow'd Crowns, and own him as their King. How can I hope, blest Gabriel, said she, While I a Virgin am, that this to me Can ever happen? to conceive a Son, A thing ne're heard off, nor was ever known: Thy God doth know how I have always led A single life, and ne're defil'd my Bed. Therefore, said Gabriel, from the glorious Throne Of the most High, his Spirit shall come down And fruitful make thine hallow'd Womb, to bear Jesus, the Son of God, thy Saviour. What I have said, th'Almighty will fulfill: His Pow'r is able to effect his Will: And as a Token that thou shalt conceive, She who is barren, call'd Elizabeth, Is now with Child: To Zach'ry I brought down The joyful Message of a wisht-for Son. Six Months with Child she's gone; with God there's nought, How strange soe're, but he can bring't about. The Conception it self. Behold, said she, the Handmaid of the Lord; Be it to me according to thy Word. For ever, Lord, thy Glorious Name be prais'd, Who, from a low and abject State hast rais'd And in renown exalted me, above The rest of Women, by this mark of Love. Mary's saluting Elizabeth. No sooner Gabriel had his Message done, But back he flew to Heaven's Glorious Throne; Up from her bended Knees the Virgin rose, And straightway went to Zacharia's house, Within Judeas hilly Country, where She found her Cousin, and saluted her. The welcome Greeting did no sooner sound Within her Ears, but she the Infant found To leap within her Womb; and straight her Breast With a Prophetick Spirit was possest, And thus she spake. Elizabeth's Exclamation. Blessed art thou, most lovely Maid, above The rest of Women in th'Almighty's Love; Blessed, for ever Blessed, is that Son Of the Great God, within thy Virgin Zone! O what a joy is it for me to see The Mother of my Lord to visit me! For loe, mine ears no sooner heard thy Voice, But in my Womb the Infant did rejoyce. Blessed art thou, because thou didst believe The Angels Message; it shall never grieve Thee, that thy Faith was so much wrought upon, For e're nine Months thou shalt bring forth this Son. Then Mary said, Magnificat. My Soul doth praise the Lord for evermore, And Spirit joyes in God my Saviour; For he regarded hath the low estate Of his poor Servant, and hath made her great. So great, that Generations henceforth shall Respect my name, and highly Blessed call. For he, that mighty is, great things hath done For me, beyond imagination. His Mercy is from Age to Age on them Who serve him; blessed be his Glorious Name. He with his Pow'rful Arm hath to the great And proud Designers given a Defeat: He from their Seats the Mighty hath put down, And rais'd the humble Soul unto a Crown. He hath the needy with good things supply'd; But to the proud his Mercies hath deny'd. He, in remembrance of his promise made To Abra'm and his Seed, hath now made glad, And holpen Isr'el; for within my Womb There lies inclos'd the promis'd Seed to come. S. John's Birth. Well nigh three Months within her Cousins House, Remain'd the lovely new betrothed Spouse Of Joseph; till she plainly did perceive Her Womb contain'd him who the World should save: Then she took leave, and forthwith to her home Poor and despised Nazareth did come. Some few days after of a lovely Boy Eliz'beth was deliver'd, to the joy Of all her Neighbours; her Relations were Glad, when they heard how God a Son and Heir Had given to her, and had Mercy shown, Making her pregnant, who was barren known. On the Eighth Day they all together came To Circumcise, and give the Child a Name: The bloody Act perform'd, they voted all Him by the name of Zachary to call; But when the Mother heard how they her Son Had Zachary nam'd, she gave the name of John. They told her none of her Relations were Call'd by that Name, as ever they could hear. Unto the Father they made signs to know How he would have him call'd, &amp; 't should be so: He made them signs to have a Book; which brought Within it John, unto their wonder, wrote. Which having done, his Tongue immediately From its restraint was set at liberty: And, in most thankful manner, the first thing Was the Almighty's praise which he did sing. When they heard this, who round about did dwell, A reverential fear upon them fell; Believing all, this Child in time would prove Some mighty man, whom Heaven so did love; Who in the Womb, and ever since hath been, By God so favour'd as was never seen. Old Zacharias, who was musing on What Gabriel said, of his and Mary's Son, A sacred flame arose within his Breast, And thus divinely sung the inspir'd Priest. Benedictus. Blest be the God of Isra'l, and esteem'd, Who hath his People visited and Redeem'd, And rais'd, within his servant Davids house, A mighty King and Saviour unto us; As by his holy Prophets mouths he spake, Which have been since he the vast World did make; That we should be delivered from all those Who are our secret, or our open Foes, To keep his mercy, which he promised To our Fore-fathers, and their num'rous Seed; The Oath he swore to Abraham on this wise, That he would free us from our Enemies; That we securely may devote our days, To do his Will, and sing his worthy praise. And thou, my Child, of the most High I know Shalt be a mighty Prophet; thou shalt go, Before the Christ, t'instruct the World how they May him imbrace and all his Laws obey: To teach them how, when they have evil done, Through him they may obtain Remission; All through the mercy of our God, whereby Christ hath to us descended from on high, To give them Light who do in Blindness sit, Within the Vale of Death, and guide our Feet Into the path of peace; which pleasant way Will lead us all to joys which ne're decay. Thus sung the aged Priest, unto his joy; In Spirit strong, and stature grew the Boy. John's Education. Within the Mountains of Judea, he Severely past his tender Infancy; There he abode, until the day wherein His Ministerial Function did begin. Now, in the forty fourth year of his Raign. The great Augustus Cæsar did ordain, And strictly charge, that all in every Town Within the Roman Empire, should set down Their Names, &amp; Fortunes, in those Cities where Their Ancestors were born, of whom they were: When this first Taxing was by Cæsar made, Cyrenius for his Province Syria had; To their respective Cities each one went To be enroll'd in Cæsar's Government. From Galilee, out of Naz'reth, Joseph came, With Mary big with Child to Bethlehem; Because they both of David's Princely Race Descended were, who born was in that place. It came to pass they were no sooner there, But Mary found the happy time drew near, Wherein she must her first born Son bring forth; The Word by whom God made both Heav'n and Earth. The Birth of Christ. Within the Inn no room she could obtain, Although she sought it o're and o're again; Into the Stable she was forc'd to go: Then on the ground her Knees did humbly bow, And in the midst of glorious thoughts, the Son Of the Most High brought forth without a groan. In Swadling-Cloaths she wrapp'd her First-born Child, And on the Straw she laid him; in the Field Were Shepheards, who by nightly turns did look Unto their innocent and wealthy Flock; When lo an Angel from the glittering Throne Of the Almighty came, and round them shone. The daz'ling brightness of his presence made The watchful Shepheards terribly affraid; The Publication of Christ's Birth. Fear not, said he, most joyful News I bring To you, and all the World; this day a King, And a Redeemer's born, the Christ is He: To Bethle'm haste, and your Salvation see. Yet, that you may not when you come mistake And for the Lord of Life, another take; Within a Stable you shall find him lye. With none but Joseph, and his Mother by. Then with the Angel of the Lord there stood An Host of heav'nly Spirits praising God, Singing this following Hymn—By those above, Angels, Archangels, to the God of Love Be glory given, for this Infants Birth; And to the good a lasting peace on Earth. Up from the Earth unto Heav'ns radiant Throne, This blessed Quire was no sooner gone; But that the trembling Shepheards, by consent, To see what they were told, to Bethle'm went: Thither they came, &amp; there the Child they saw Lye in the Stable on a heap of Straw With Joseph and his Wife, abroad they spread, What they had seen, and what the Angel said; And all who heard them with amazement were Seiz'd at the Story, which they did declare. But Mary ponder'd these things o're and o're, And grew in Faith, and knowledg more &amp; more. Back to their Flocks the joyful Shepheards went; And all the time of their returning spent In glorifying of th'Almighty's Name, For all those things which he reveal'd to them. The Circumcision. On the eighth day after the Child was born, The pious Joseph early in the Morn, With his Redeemer to th'Synagogue came, Who Circumcised was, and by the Name Of Jesus call'd; as Gabriel order gave Unto the Virgin, e're she did conceive. And when her forty days accomplisht were According to the Law, they did repair With the Messiah to Jerusalem; His Presentation in the Temple. Where, to the Priest, they both presented him. For by the Law, the First-born Male among The Jews, unto Jehovah did belong; E're since that fatal night wherein he smote Ægypts First-born, and thence his Isr'el brought. Two Turtle Doves she for her self did bring, Although a poor yet legal Offering: Unto the Lord, from out the bleating Flock, A Lamb she could not purchase with her Stock. Within the Town of Solyma liv'd one, Who just and pious was, call'd Simeon, Full of the Holy Ghost, attending there When Isr'els Consolation would appear: To him the Spirit did reveal, that he Should e're he dy'd the promis'd Blessing see. He by divine impulse to th'Temple came, Just as the Father and his pious Dame Arriv'd with the blest Off-spring of her Womb, To do for him what the strict Law did doom: Where in his presence they a tender made Of their First-born, and his cheap ransome paid; Then in his feeble Arms old Simeon took The heav'nly Babe, and thus divinely spoke.— Nunc Dimittis. Lord, let me now into the silent Grave In peace depart, since with mine Eyes I have Beheld the Christ, which thou hast long foretold, Whom now thy People in this place behold; A Light to those who do in Darkness dwell, And the great Glory of thine Israel. Joseph and Mary much surprized were, At those mysterious Truths the rev'rend Seer, Concerning Jesus, in that place declar'd; Such as before their Ears had never heard. Simeons Prophecy. Then Simeon blest them; and to Mary said,— Behold this Child of thine, thou lovely Maid, Is for the ruine of the Ungodly sent, And the redemption of the Penitent: And for a Sign in Isr'el he shall stand; 'Gainst whom the wicked of the World shall band; That all the thoughts of men which are conceal'd, Both of the good and bad, may be reveal'd. And thou, the Mother of this blessed Son, When thou behold'st their barb'rous cruelty, Shalt find thy Soul with sorrow over-run; Some great affliction it shall bring to thee. Anna's Prophecy. Into the Temple at this instant came, Of Asers Tribe, a Widdow, who by name Was Hannah call'd, who in her younger life, But seven years had liv'd a married Wife. Eighty and four years old, this woman was, A strict observer of the Jewish Laws; Who duly did the Temple-Prayers frequent, And every Week two days in Fasting spent. She likewise thank'd the Lord, and spoke of him, To all who dwelt within Jerusalem. Now when the Parents had the Law fulfill'd, Both unto Bethlem with the blessed Child Return'd again, where for a while they were, Till in a Dream th'Almighty did appear To Joseph, with a strict command, that he Should take the Child, and into Ægypt flee: There they remain'd until the Tyrant's death, And afterwards return'd to Nazareth. In Spirit strong and Stature Jesus grew, Whom God with mighty Wisdome did indue. When twelve years old the blessed Jesus was, His Parents who devoutly kept the Laws Of the great God, the time now drawing near To celebrate the annual Passover; Took this same hopeful Child along with them To keep this great Feast at Jerusalem: And when the days of it accomplisht were, Joseph and Mary homewards did repair, With their Acquaintance, and Relations, who In Naz'reth did dwell, or near thereto. Christ's stay at Jerusalem, and conferring with the Doctors. Onwards they travell'd, but ne're mist their Son, Who in Jerus'lem staid; to them unknown Until they had a whole days Journey gone. Then 'mongst their Kindred and their Friends they went, Inquiring for him, but no news they learnt. With thoughtful care for their neglect of him, They back return'd unto Jerusalem. After a three days search, their Child they found Within the Temple Porch, encompass'd round With the most noted Rabbies of the Jews, Asking such things which did the Scribes amuse; So that they all with wonder seised were At his wise answers, and discourses there. When 'midst the learned of the Jewish Land His Mother and her Husband saw him stand, Th'amazed Virgin to her Son did go; Jesus, said she, thou did'st unkindly do, To raise such fears within thy Fathers mind, And mine, as thou did'st by thy stay behind; But he reply'd, the fittest place for me Is where I am; know ye not I must be About my Fathers business? But they could Not this mysterious Speech of his unfold. However back to Nazareth he came, With his ore-joyed Parents: at that same Laborious Calling eighteen years he wrought, Which Joseph did profess, and him had taught; And to their just Commands was never known To shew himself a disrespectful Son. His Baptism. Up to the Age of thirty years being grown, He forthwith went to be Baptiz'd by John, (Who at the River Jordan was that time Baptizing sev'ral that did come to him;) But John this Office at the first did wave, Until the Ever-blest such Reasons gave To have it done, that, in the Peoples sight, He there conferr'd on him that sacred Rite. When lo, th'Eternal Spirit from above Hov'ring, descended on him as a Dove: And from the Clouds at that same time was heard, A thundring Voice, which these same words declar'd: This is my well-beloved Son, in whom I am well pleas'd; who from my self did come, On purpose to reveal my Will below, That all might know what 'tis they ought to do. Jesus indu'd with power from on high, Took on him now the publick Ministry: And taught the People Doctrines so Divine, The Sun not clearer than their Truths did shine; Confirming them with Wonders, such as ne're Eye saw before, nor ear did ever hear. MIRACLE I. Jesus his turning Water into Wine, at a Marriage Feast, in Cana of Galilee. The first he wrought was in a certain Town Of Galilee, by th'Name of Cana known. Where the blest Virgin to a Nuptial Feast, Was by the Bridegroom call'd to be a Guest. Jesus, and his Disciples, likewise were Bid with some others, and all present there. Down sate the Bridegroom chearful as the day, And by his side the blushing Bride, all gay. The welcome Guests around the Table sate, With sev'ral sorts of healthful Viands fraight. All Dinner while a diligent Slave did stand, With watchful Eye, and with a ready hand, Behind each Guest, to fetch what he did need, Not with a Leaden-heel, but nimble speed. No loose Discourses at the Table were, Civil the Guests were, no Buffoon was there. One who imagines he doth glory get, To be discoursive in the dregs of Wit; Yet harmless mirth, and flowing Goblets went Around the Board, till all the Wine was spent. Mary, who knew the Bridegrooms Store was gone, Unto her Son, the want of Wine made known, She told him 'twas a fit occasion now In publick his Mirac'lous Pow'r to show; By doing that they all would judge Divine, With an Almighty Word create more Wine. Jesus who knew his time of action best; Unwilling yet his Pow'r to manifest Unto the World, he gently did repress His Mothers too impatient forwardness; Yet he assur'd her, that the Guests should be Supply'd with Wine, but done so privately, That none but she, and his Disciples should, With those who serv'd, the Miracle behold. Straight to the Waiters did the Virgine go, And what he will'd commanded them to do. Within the Room six Cisterns stood, each one Holding three Firkins, all of Marble-stone. These in their order, on their sev'ral Stands, Were fill'd with Water, for to wash the Hands Of the invited Jews, an act prophane Esteeming it, to eat with hands unclean. Up to the Brim with Water Jesus bid The Servants fill these Vessels, which they did. Straight he commanded one of them to bear A full Glass of it to the Governour; Who when he tasted of the Work Divine, The Water turned into gen'rous Wine, He call'd the Bridegroom of the lib'ral Feast, And askt him why he had reserv'd his best Of Wines till last; all men, says he, at first Bring their best Liquors, but at last their worst. But thou the noblest Wine, of richest taste, After w' have freely drank, hast brought at last. This Wonder Jesus the Eternal Son Perform'd in Cana; and his Pow'r shone So bright in his Disciples Eyes, that they Own'd him the Son of God from that same day. MIRACLE II. His Cure of a Noble Man's Son, who lay Sick of a Feaver at Capernaum. In Galilee a Noble Man there was, Belonging unto Herod Antipas, Whose Son did Sick at Capernaum lye, Past all the hopes of Physick's remedy; Hearing that Jesus was to Galilee Out of Judea come, away went he To Cana, and besought him to come down Unto his house, and heal his dying Son. Now Christ, who knew the Galileans well To be of Tempers most inflexible, That to his Doctrin they would not be brought To give belief, except he wonders wrought, Resolv'd forthwith, from his tormenting pain, To raise this Courtiers Son to health again: But he, poor man! impatient of delay, Thinking his Son could not out-live the day, Importun'd Christ to come immediately, And work this Cure before his Son did dye. Jesus, who saw the faithful Parents Tears, Willing to rid him of his anxious fears, Told him he might unto his home retire, His Son was well, and that the raging Fire Which did inflame the Blood in every Vein, Was now extinguisht, and all calm'd again. Which when the Father heard he went his way, Fully believing what the Lord did say. Unto his house as he was trav'lling down, The welcome news of his recover'd Son Came to his Ears, brought by the nimble care Of some who his domestick Servants were. His Arms around the first Man's Neck he flung, Tell me, said he, tell me my Friend, how long 'Tis since the burning Feaver did depart From my recover'd Son, my dearest heart? Just at the seventh hour thy Son, said he, Whom we concluded past recovery, All on a sudden yesterday was well, And so we left him, as these here can tell; Who in the joyful news did all accord, So home they went with their rejoycing Lord. Arriv'd at length to his beloved Son, After a thousand kind expressions shown, He in the hearing of his Wife, and those Who of his houshold were, did straight disclose The wondrous manner of his Childs great Cure, And what great grief his fears made him endure; And then precisely reck'ning up the time Of's Sons being well, and Christ's so telling him, They all concluded, when these things they knew, To his Almighty Word the Cure was due; And with their Lord, to the great God did give Glory, and in his Son the Christ believe. This second Wonder Jesus wrought when he Came from Judea into Galilee. No doubt but sev'ral more were done by him, Both in Judea and Jerusalem, Only these two (as done the first year) stand Upon Record, writ by the faithful hand Of his beloved John, and now we go, To tell [illeg.]e next year he did do. MIRACLE I. In the second year of Christ's publick Ministry. The taking of a vast draught of Fish at the command of Jesus to launch out into the Deep, &amp;c. Assist me, Lord, while I the Wonders pen, Which thou hast wrought among the Sons of Men. Near to Gennes'reth's Lake as Jesus was Teaching aright the much abused Laws Unto the People, who long while had been Falsly instructed by their Priests therein; From neighb'ring Towns the Crowd did so encrease, That he was well nigh stifled in the Press. Close to the Shoar two Boats a float did lye, The one belong'd unto old Zebedee, And his two Sons his Partners, James and John, Andrew, and Peter, did the other own. These, all the night, a Fishing in the Lake Had toyling been, but ne're a Fish could take. And now upon the Shoar all tyred stood, Having made clean their Nets within the Flood. Jesus, who 'fore he taught, these Boats did see, With much ado, got from the Company, And went into the Boat which did belong To Simon Peter, from the gazing throng, And causing him to thrust it from the Land, The People taught, who on the Shoar did stand. When his discourse was ended, and each one Of the confused Rabble home were gone. Simon, said he, launch out into the Main, And cast your Nets, to try your Luck again, Into the watry Chambers of the Deep, And thence on Shoar the Scaly Dwellers sweep. But Simon told him, we have all the night Labour'd in vain, and on no Fish could light, And now at noon day, and a Sky serene, To think we shall be more successful than We yet have been, is a conceit so vain, That none who knows the Trade can entertain, Nevertheless at thy request we'll wet Once more our Nets, although no Fish we get. Then down into the deep they hopeless cast, Their fatal Engines, and inclos'd at last So vast a draught of Fish, both great and small, That their Nets brake, and they were forc'd to call To James and John, to come and help them take The flutt'ring Pris'oners forth the crystal Lake. Come to their help, with much ado they got Part of the loaden Net into the Boat, Still by degrees they more of it did pull, Till they had heap'd with Fish their Boat so full, That down into the deep they sinking were, At which the greedy Simon full of fear, Fell at the knees of Jesus, and besought Him to depart out of the sinking Boat, For Lord (said he) my Sins so num'rous are, They'l render me unfit to reap a share Of this great draught, so great as ne're was known, Which is a cause of admiration, To me, and my Companions, who before Ne're saw the like, nor ever shall see more. But Jesus bid him lay aside all fear, They were as safe as if on Land they were. Besides, said he, if thou and these will be, (Who are thy Partners) Followers of me, Ye shall have all by much a nobler Trade, Than this, of men ye shall be Fishers made, And with the Gospel-Net which you shall use, Millions of Gentiles ye shall take, and Jews; And through Death's Chambers safely to the Shore Of Life and Bliss bring them for evermore. Now when the four their Vessels safe had brought Unto the Shore, which once they never thought Alive they should have reacht, from that same time They forsook all they had, and follow'd him. MIRACLE II. The Cure of a Demoniack in the City of Capernaum. Jesus to Capernaum went straightway With his Disciples, on the Sabbath-day, When a great number of the City were Assembled in the Synagogue, to hear Their Rabbies, with a reverence profound, Erroneously Gods sacred Law expound. Jesus came in, and while they did unfold Their wronged Law, and strange Traditions told, His patient ear attentively did lend Unto their roving talk, till it did end. Then stretching, forth his Arm, th'eternal Son Of the great God his heav'nly Speech begun, Teaching the Jews sublimer Truths than they By their conceited Priests were taught that day; Preaching, as one Commission'd from above, Th'unheard of Mercies of the God of Love, With so much pow'r, that they wonder'd all, Having ne're heard the like from any fall. Now that same restless Spirit, who doth go Round the vast Orb, to work the overthrow Of Fallen Man, had then among the rest Of the assembled Jews, a Man possest; Who when he heard the ever blessed Lord Divinely teach, most hellishly he roar'd, And thus he spake,—Can't we be let alone, Since we are banisht from the heav'nly Throne, To have the freedom of this lower World, Must we from hence as from above be hurl'd, What have we, Jesus, for to do with thee, Are we not here from thy Dominion free? Art thou with pow'r come down to make us leave Those conquer'd Souls, which by our wiles we have Fetter'd, with a design to make them be Companions with us in our misery; I know thee, who thou art, and must thee own To be the mighty Saviour, and the Son Of that just God, whom, by our fatal Pride, We would have equall'd, but in vain we try'd. Then Jesus sharply did rebuke the Fiend, And to his saucy Questions put an end; Commanding him to hold his peace, and quit The captiv'd Body, and ne're argue it. Th'enraged Fiend, who durst no longer stay Within his conquer'd Tenement of Clay, All foaming threw him on the paved Floor, Beating his Face till 'twas imbru'd all o're With Froth and Blood, then with an hideous yell Forth sally'd the infernal Imp of Hell. Now when the Standers by beheld the deed, They all astonisht were, and all agreed That sure his Doctrin must be heav'nly, And that the Teacher more than Man must be, Whom the affrighted Devils do obey, Tremble when he commands, and sneak away. Then through the Coasts of Galilee his Name Tryumphing rode upon the Wings of Fame. MIRACLE III. The Cure of Peter's Wives Mother, who was sick of a Feaver. No sooner was the Sabbath-duty done, And to their homes th'amazed Jews all gone, But Jesus, James and John, with Simon, went, And Andrew, to their poor retirement; Where almost till the dawn of the next day, With the two pair of Brothers he did stay. Within the house sick at that time did lye, Simon's Wives Mother, at the point to dye, Whose aged blood, caus'd by a feav'rish flame, Boyl'd with such fury, that no Art could tame, Whom the Physitians had quite given o're, Knowing their skill could not her health restore. Peter, who just before had seen his Lord Effect a Cure, by his Almighty VVord, Upon a Man whom Satan had possest, Fell on his Knees, and humbly did request, That by his mighty Pow'r he would cure, His aged Mother's raging Calenture. Jesus, who ever ready was to give Relief to those who did in him believe, Came to the Bed, where the distemper'd Soul, Tortur'd with scorching heat, did toss and rowl, And in the view of ail who there did stand, He took the woman by the burning hand, And raising her upright, the Feaver straight Did by his Sov'raign touch its rage abate. So well she was, that forthwith she did go, And made Provision for her Guests below. MIRACLE IV. The Cure of divers sick persons in the Evening of that Sabbath. Now when the fiery Chariot of the Sun Had round this part of our Horizon run, Most of the City hearing of the Fame Of Jesus, to the door of Peter came, Bringing their Sick, their Blind, their Lame, and all Those whom the Devil had long held in thrall. Jesus, whose love no limits ever knew, When he beheld the sad diseased Crew, And heard their dying groans, and fearful crys, Arising from their various miseries, Out of a tender pity to Mankind, Cur'd the Possest, the Sick, the Lame, and Blind, And the infernal Fiends would not allow, Whom he cast forth, to say they did him know. MIRACLE V. The healing of several Sick and Diseased Persons, by Jesus as he went through Galilee, and more particularly the Cure of a Leper. Before the guilded Planet of the East Had from his watry Bed arose, and drest His nimble Body with a fulgent ray, Up Jesus got, and went aside to pray, Into a solitary place, when soon He was by Simon, Andrew, James and John Follow'd, and on his Knees upon the ground, With lifted hands in fervent Prayer found, Straight with the reasons of their coming out They did inform him, how his fame had brought, By those he had restor'd, as many more Diseased persons, round about the door, Who there attended to receive their doom, And would not thence depart till he did come. But he who came commission'd from the Throne Of the great God, to make his Gospel known, Askt them with him to th'neighb'ring Towns to go, For so his Father order'd him to do, That they his glorious Truths might likewise hear And Power see, and of them witness bear. Then with the four he went (such care had he) To preach the Gospel throughout Galilee. And dayly in their Synagogues he taught Th'abused People, and such VVonders wrought, In curing those whom Satan had possest, That his Almighty Pow'r was manifest. There was a Jew who a long while had been Vext with a Leprous Scab all o're his Skin, Who by the Priest was, by a rigid doom, Forbid within their Synagogues to come; He came to Jesus with an humble Soul, And begg'd, on bended Knees, to be made whole. For Lord, said he, I know if thou do'st please, 'Tis in thy pow'r to cure my foul Disease. The Son of Love, who of our Bodies here, As well as Souls hereafter, takes a care, Stretcht forth his Arm, and touching him, said he, My pleasure 'tis, that thou henceforth shalt be Freed from this Leprous Scab; and, as he said, All on a sudden he was healthful made. Then to the Priest he order'd him to go, (As by the Law he was oblig'd to do) And shew himself, and for his cleansing bring VVhat was requir'd for an Offering. But how he came to be restor'd, to none, No not unto the Priest, to make it known. Yet when he was departed, he began To publish it, that Jesus was the Man, VVho wrought this mighty Cure, &amp; though forbid To tell it, told them all he said, and did, So that with safety Jesus could no more Enter the City, as he did before, In publick, but a while withdrew aside To Desart places, where he did abide; But there the Galileans found him out, Flocking from every quarter round about. MIRACLE VI. The Cure of a Man sick of a Palsie at Capernaum. Jesus (though for a while he did refrain From Capernaum) came at length again Into the City, in the open day, And to the house of Simon went straightway. Long had he not been there, but a great Crew VVas met together, when they once it knew; A Crew so num'rous, that there was no room, No not about the door, for all to come. Jesus, who all occasions did embrace To teach the People, what their duty was, Arose, and sweetly the Almighty's will Into their itching Ears did there instil. But while amidst the Doctors of the Laws, His Fathers sacred Truths he teaching was, A Paralytick to the house was brought, To have a Cure by his great power wrought. But the ungovern'd press into the Room Would not permit the Bed-rid Wretch to come. When lo, his Friends bethought them of a wile, And, climbling to the top o'th' low built Pile, The Roof uncover'd; when they so had done, Into the Room they let the Palsy'd down. VVhen Jesus saw the strange unusual way, The Friends of the diseas'd had to convey The Paralytick to him, Son, said he, For thy great Faith, thy Sins forgiven be. Which when the Scribes and Pharisees, who were Sitting within the Room, with him, did hear, They thought within themselves, how dares this Man Blaspheme at this rate, since there's none that can Forgive our Sins, but that Almighty One, Who sits above in his Celestial Throne. Jesus, who by his Pow'r Divine could tell Those ranc'rous thoughts, which in their hearts did dwell, Looking upon the envious Scribes, did say, VVhy judg ye thus? Which is the easier way, To tell the Sick, thy Sins forgiven be, Or thou art cur'd of thine Infirmity? But that ye may the mighty Power know The Son of Man hath over all below, To make both Soul, and Body to arise Healthful, and free from all Infirmities. He stedfast look'd upon the Palsied Soul, And bid him rise, for he was now made whole, VVho straight obey'd, and taking up his Bed, VVent forth before them all, recovered. Now when the Jews beheld what Christ had done, They were amaz'd, having the like ne're known, And with their mouths gave glory to the Lord, VVho so impower'd his great Prophets Word. MIRACLE VII. The Cure of an Impotent Man, by the Pool of Bethesday. At Solyma there was a noted Feast, To celebrate the which, the ever-Blest, VVho ne're omitted what he ought to do, In all obedience to the Law did go. Within the Town there stood (just by the place Wherein the Jews did use to wash always The slaughter'd Bodies of their harmless Beasts, Which were to be the Victims at their Feasts) An House of Mercy, where the Blind and Lame, And Wither'd Persons lay, who thither came To be immers'd within this bloody Pool, In which who-e're was plung'd, was straight made whole. Under this Roof an helpless Wretch did ly, Bound with the Bands of an Infirmity Thirty eight years, expecting there to find Some pious Person, who would prove so kind, As him into this healing Bath to set, That he thereby might Strength and Vigour get; But this neglected He, could find not one (So little did they all his Case bemoan) That when the Waters troubled were therein, Would his assistance lend to put him in. The Son of Love, who all his life time spent In works of Mercy to the Impotent, Came to the place where the Diseas'd did lye, And looking on him with a tender Eye, Propos'd this question to the Bed-rid Soul, Whether he willing was to be made whole? Sir, said the Man, long have I waited here For this intent, but I am ne're the near; No Friend I have that when the VVaters be Troubled, their helping hand will lend to me, To put me in, others this blessing gain, (Through help of Friends) which I cannot obtain. Jesus, who knew the sad and helpless case Of the Diseas'd, and how he friendless was, Bid him arise, take up his Bed, and go Unto his house, for he was healed now. Then straight he rose, and taking up his Bed On which a long and sad Life he had led, Begun with it upon the Sabbath-day (On which the Cure was wrought) to go away. This when the Jews beheld, who did detest All violations of their Day of Rest, They were enrag'd, and told him what he did Upon that day, their sacred Law forbid, Which no laborious action would allow, And such was his, which he ought not to do. But boldly he reply'd, the Man who made Me whole this day, the same unto me said, Take up thy Bed, and walk, and so I will, Though in the very act you do me kill. Then they demanded of him, who he was, That durst command him to infringe their Laws, And break the rest of that same sacred day, Which he was strictly bound to keep alway; But unto this the man could nothing say; For then he knew not Jesus, who that day Had healed him, and to the Jews unknown VVas stept aside, and from their envy gone. After a while the ever-blessed Lord Found him i'th' Temple whom he had restor'd, VVho out of tender pity to the man Bid him be careful how he sinn'd again, Since of his tedious Sickness he was well, Lest a more fearful Judgment him befell. But straight unto the Jews this silly Soul Went and inform'd them Jesus made him whole, Therefore they sought the ever-Blest to slay, Because he heal'd him on the Sabbath-day. MIRACLE VIII. The Cure of one who had a wither'd Hand, wrought in Galilee. As Jesus travell'd through the Fields of Corn, With his Disciples, on the Sabbath Morn, His little Flock with gnawing Hunger took, T'appease its rage, the full-ear'd Corn did pluck. When this the formal Pharisees did see, (VVho no respect had to necessity) They told the ever-blessed Jesus, how His Follow'rs did what they ought not to do. They broke upon that Solemn Day their Fast, Before the publick Services were past, Which strictly by their Moses was forbid In his own Law, and which they never did. Jesus, who through this Vail their envy saw, And better knew the meaning of the Law Than these dissembling Zealots did, reply'd, Have ye not read what God's Anointed did, And his Companions, when from Saul they fled? How they did eat the consecrated Bread, Which to the Temple, and the Priests belong'd, And by this action thought the Law not wrong'd. And in the Law have ye not notice ta'ne, How that the Priests i'th' Temple do prophane The sacred Sabbath? And yet blameless are, Although the works they then performed were, But for the service of the Temple, not To be allow'd on that day to be wrought. Now if that David and his men, who were With Hunger pinch'd, might safely without fear The Shew-bread take, and without sinning eat Those hallow'd Loaves, for want of other Meat, Why may not my Disciples be allow'd (Since they were destitute of other Food) To pluck and eat the ripened ears of Corn, Although they did it on the Sabbath Morn? That which they did, being but to abate Their raging Hunger, which requir'd Meat, And in the Laws intention sure they are, No more blame-worthy, than the other were. Their Cases are alike, and therefore must Both sinful be, or both accounted just. And if th'appeasing Sacrifices may, Be by the Priests drest on the Sabbath-day, Why may not my Disciples crop the Corn, As they walk'd through it on the Sabbath Morn, Since holy days, as well as things, may be Prophan'd in cases of necessity? If inhumane ye were not, as ye are, And so unlike to God, who doth declare, That Mercy is more pleasing in his Eyes By far, than is the richest Sacrifice, You would (as 'twas your duty to have done) Put on this act the best construction: And not have charg'd my Follow'rs, for this deed, With an offence, 'cause what they herein did, Was but in order to my Service done, And with my liking, and permission, Who Lord am of the Sabbath, and so may Forgive the breach of that Religious day. This said, and having justify'd this Deed, And his Disciples from the Cavils freed, Of the most spightful Pharisees, the place He forthwith left, where the Contention was, And went another Sabbath day into Their Synagogue, and, as he us'd to do, The silly People most divinely taught, Where this ensuing Miracle he wrought. Among the great Assembly there did stand A poor disabled Person, whose right hand Was shrivel'd up, he hearing of the Fame Of Jesus, to be heal'd, unto him came. The baffled Scribes and Pharisees, who were Thirsty for an occasion to ensnare The blessed Jesus, waiting for him lay, To see him heal upon the Sabbath-day: A deed, which they accounted such a Crime, That 'twould condemn him in the Sanhedrim. But Jesus, who their thoughts did understand, Commanded him who had the wither'd Hand To rise, and in the mid'st stand forth of all Those who their Malice did Religion call; Straight he arose, and this command obey'd, Then Jesus, sternly looking on them, said— One thing I'le ask of you, who seem so wise To think all knowledge in your bosom lyes, Who so great Criticks in your Laws are known, Is good or evil lawful to be done Upon your Sabbath-days? Or is it fit To destroy Life, or else to rescue it? But they so puzzled were at what he said, That to his Queries they no answer made. Then went he on—Who is there of you all Shall have a Sheep, that by a chance shall fall Into a steepy-pit o'th' Sabbath-day, And will not take the liberty to lay Hold on it, and endeavour all he can To pull it out?—How much more is a Man Better than such a Creature? Wherefore know, Men may good actions on the Sabbath do. Then fiercely looking on the thronging Croud Who there around him (full of envy) stood, Griev'd at the very Soul, to find not one That had the Bowels of Compassion, He bid the Man who had the wither'd Hand, (And in the middle of the Throng did stand) To stretch it forth, who did as Jesus said, And whole that Hand was as the other made. MIRACLE IX. The Cure of several Persons by our Saviour, when he came down from the Mountain. Jesus, whose Soul was on Devotion bent, Having all night in fervent Prayer spent Upon a Mountain: when the Worlds great Eye Pierc'd through the sable Clouds, and made them fly: Call'd his Disciples to him, and of them Made choice of twelve for to attend on him. These he Apostles nam'd, because that he Purpos'd, so soon as they were fit to be Employ'd by him, to send them forth to Preach, Those right'ous Laws which he came down to Teach: But first in Jewry they were to make known, Th'eternal Precepts of the mighty One, And after that (when he was Thron'd on High) Throughout the World to Preach up Piety. Th'Apostles thus made choice of to fulfil, The pleasure of his just and sacred Will, He from the Leavy-Mountains shady Brow, On which he Pray'd, did with his Follow'rs go, Into the spacious Plain, and there he stood, As most convenient for the Multitude, Who with more ease might there his Doctrin hear, And to him come, those who diseased were. Being there, (besides the residue of those Who Jesus for their blessed Master chose) Great multitudes of People to him came Out of Judea and Jerusalem, And from the Sea-coasts of the stately Tyre And pop'lous Sydon: some with a desire To hear him Preach, and some, infirm that were, In hope once come, they should be healed there. Herein so gracious was the blessed Son Of the Almighty, that there was not one That mist his expectation, for he Preach'd The Gospel to them, and his Virtue reach'd To those who were Diseas'd. So good was he That through his mighty Love he set them free That came possest with Devils, and them cur'd Who any kind of Miseries endur'd, And did but touch him, such an healing pow'r, Then issuing from him, that the self same hour Unto as perfect Health, as e're before, He did their Bodies, and their minds restore. MIRACLE X. The Cure of a Leper by our Saviour, after he had ended his Sermon on the Mountain. Down from the Mountain Jesus did descend, Into the Plain, when he had made an end, Of his Discourse, and with him many were, Who came from places far remote, and near; Amongst the rest whom fame had thither brought, Hearing the wond'rous Cures which Christ had wrought, A poor infected Leper came, and layd Humbly himself at his blest Feet, and said,— Lord, if thou wilt my Cure but undertake, Thou can'st me clean of my Distemper make; Say but the Word, and I am well assur'd, So soon as it is spoke, I shall be cur'd. When Jesus saw his Faith, and likewise how He was assured what his Pow'r could do, Though his Disease was such as there was none Could heal, besides the ever blessed Son, Stretcht forth his hand, to shew how ready he Was to do good, and touch'd him presently. What legal Priest or Pharisee is there, Who durst in this case do, as he did here? Sure if a Leper had to any one Of them but come, and his Disease made known, And for his Cure as humbly made request To him, as this did to the ever-Blest, He would have loath'd the most deplored sight Of such a Wretch, and nimbly took his flight, For fear th'Infection which he carried, Might with a leprous Scab his Skin o're-spread. But Jesus, whose kind love doth over-flow, And knows no bounds to us poor Souls below, Dealt not, upon th'account of his Disease, So with this man, as he would in this case, But was so far from being inhumane, As to avoid the poor infected Man, When he came to him to be cur'd, that he Seeing his Faith and great humility, No otherwise beseeching from his hand His Health, than might with his good pleasure stand, Both touch'd him with his hand, &amp; likewise said, (To shew the mighty Power which he had) Because thou dost believe, and art most sure, That if I will I can effect thy Cure, I'le do it for thee, therefore from thy foul And leprous Scab be thou for ever whole. No sooner had the ever-blessed Lord This said, but so effect'al prov'd his Word, That it the Lepers Skin immediately Alter'd, and cleans'd him from his Leprosie. The Leper cleansed, Jesus bid him tell To no man who it was, that made him well: For if this should be to the Phar'sees known, Which I have for thee at this instant done, So spightful are they, and they hate me so, That what they could to blast this Cure they'd do, And on my Fall so firmly they are bent, They'd make me feel what Malice can invent, But go thou to the Priest, and to him show Thy self, as by the Law thou ought'st to do, And if he doth declare thee to be free, And throughly purged of thy Leprosie. As he hath hitherto, upon good ground, Judg'd thee infected, and a man unsound; Then offer him the Gift with thine own hand, Which God by Moses strictly did command; That he, by his receiving it of thee, May own thou'rt cleansed from thy Leprosie: That when the Multitude this thing shall know, That thou art clean, and by him judged so, They may believe, what now they will not own, That I am truly their Jehovah's Son, Since this great Cure I wrought on thee is such, As none could do, but by an heav'nly touch. MIRACLE XI. The Cure of a Centurions Servant in Capernaum, who was sick of a Palsie. Near to Genes'reth's Lake there is a Town, Within the known Precincts of Zabulon, And Nepthali, which all men by the Name Of Capernaum call, of noted Fame. Hither the holy Jesus often came, Because the place was populous, and so Gave him occasions oftentimes to do Many stupend'ous Wonders, and thereby Those sacred Truths he taught, to ratifie. As he was entring now into this place, It so fell out, that there a Captain was Whose faithful Servant had for sometime lain Sick of a Palsie, in such a horrid pain, That he was past all humane art to save, And now descending to the silent Grave. At this much troubled the Centurion was, And highly grieved for his Slave, because He dearly lov'd him, having found him just In all those things committed to his trust. Hearing therefore from sundry Jews the Fame Of Jesus, who were once both Sick and Lame, Whom he had healthful made, how happy he Was in the curing any Malady, That either was inflicted on the Mind, Or on the Body seiz'd, of any kind; Sent unto him the Elders of the Jews, To beg him in their Names not to refuse To come, and heal his Servant who had prov'd Faithful to him, and whom he dearly lov'd. Not with the least mistrust did he request This favour of them to the ever-blest, Thinking that if he personally came, Jesus unto him would not grant the same: But meerly out of great humility, And a most wise and bashful modesty, Knowing himself to be an Alien, And then a Souldier, both which kind of Men The Jews did for the greatest part abhor, As men of no Religion, thought therefore Himself unworthy for to come, and crave This favour of him for his faithful Slave. And this the Elders of the Jews did know, And therefore they, when begg'd by him to go To Jesus, with his humble suit to have Some speedy help for his poor dying Slave, Went forthwith to him, and with earnestness The holy Jesus for his Cure did press, And thus they said—Sir, we beseech thee, take No notice that the man, for whose kind sake We come unto thee, is a Stranger here, And more than that a Roman Souldier; And that the person we intreat to have Restor'd to health, is this same Souldier's Slave. For lo the Captain, whom this man doth serve, A worthy person is, and doth deserve In several respects (to us well known) To have as great a kindness to him shown As this, for which we are now come to thee; For he's our real Friend, and one that we Are well assured doth our Nation love, And this which he hath done for us doth prove, For we have by his bounty, at this day, And cost, a Synagogue wherein to Pray. When Jesus heard the sayings of these men, To shew that he despis'd no man, how mean Soever, if he truly did believe That he could help and succour to him give, Went with the Elders of the Jews straightway Towards the house where the sick Servant lay, And being not far distant from the place, Where the tormented Paralytick was, Some Friends of his the Captain did request To go with him, and meet the ever-Blest, Who with a lowly reverence drawing near, Did with these following words salute his Ear— Lord, trouble not thy self, for I am one Who am not worthy to have favour shown, So great a Favour as I ask of thee, Under my homely Roof thy Face to see. Wherefore I neither thought my self i'th' least Worthy to come to thee with this request; But let thy blessed lips but speak the word, And to his health my Slave shall be restor'd. For so all pow'rful art thou, I am sure Thou needs not present be, to work a Cure, But canst a Patient to his Health restore, Though absent, and by Sickness at Deaths dore. Besides this Cure's too mean, and much below Thy Majesty, to come thy self and do. Matters of small importance I transfer Unto those Persons, who my Servants are, And bearing rule, with me they never stand To argue, but obey my just command. For if I say to one man go, he go'th, And to another come, this thing he doth; And do but this unto my Servant say, Forthwith he doth it, without more delay. Now if such force in my Commands do lye, That they (though I sit still) as certainly Are executed by those men, who are Under my Rule, as if I present were, And did put all those things which they have done For me, my self in Execution. How much more shall thy Servants, Lord, fulfill What thou injoyn'st, and do thy sacred Will, Although thou do'st not stir to see it done, For such thy power is, that there is none That can for greatness equal it, and thou Can'st make them able, what thou wilt, to do. Thus spake the Captain, and his words were such That Jesus marvell'd at them very much, And turning him about did thus declare Unto the People, who him following were, So great a Faith as this, I freely say, I have not found in Isr'el to this day; And furthermore, I tell you, there shall come Many from all parts of the World, on whom You look and do abhor, as men who are Strangers and Aliens to your Nation here, Who shall by Faith admitted be into The Church of God, though now contemn'd by you, And in the Kingdom of that Holy One, With your Renowned Ancestors sit down, And for their Faith, as their dear Children be Own'd, and with them injoy felicity. Whereas the Children who from those did come, That promis'd were this Kingdom, and to whom It by the Virtue of the Cov'nant made, Had still belong'd, if foolishly they had Not forfeited their right by such a Life Which wicked was, and full of unbelief: I say, that none of these Children shall be, Admitted to this blest Eternity, But into utter Darkness shall be thrown, And there the loss of those blest Joys bemoan, And gnash their Teeth, that that felicity Which they were promis'd, and have mist, should be Conferred on them, whom they look'd upon As meerly Strangers to their Nation. When Jesus thus unto the Jews had spoke, He on the Captain cast a gracious look, And said unto him—Go thy way, and as Thou hast believ'd so it shall come to pass. And when they came unto the house they found, Just as the Lord had said, the Servant sound. MIRACLE XII. The raising of a Widow's Son to Life, who dwelt at Naim. The morrow, after the beloved Son Of the Most High, the wondrous Cure had done For the Centurion's Servant, who was just Crumbling again into his Mother Dust, He, with the rest who his Attendants were, To Naim went; and as they did draw near Unto the City Gate, with solemn pace, A num'rous Train from thence just coming was, Attending to the Grave the only Son, Of a discons'late Widow of that Town. Jesus, who saw as they did pass along, The grieving Parent 'mongst the mournful throng, Touch'd with compassion at the Tears she shed, For the lost Pledg of her once Nuptial Bed, Unto the sad and des'late Widow made, And thus aloud, these following words, he said,— Weep not, fond Woman, for thine only Son, Nor blame God's goodness, who this thing hath done, Though in thine eyes, this dealing seems severe, Such must be born with by his Creatures here; Who knows but God (who best knows what to do) Hath took this Child, thine only joy from you, Turning thy chearful day to dismal night, To discipline thee in his ways aright. Who didst perhaps more value fading Dust, Than the Almighty Father of the Just? Or how do'st know, but that he this did do, That he might to thee, and these Persons shew, The Sov'raign Power he hath over all To take, and back Man's Life again recall, That so your Faith might up to Heaven soar, And there be fixt, and never waver more? Then stepping to the Bier, he laid his Hand Upon it, and the Bearers did command Upon the Ground to set the breathless Load, When straight, the ever-blessed Son of God Call'd to the Youth, who with the fatal Chain Of Death was bound, to rise to Life again. Which words no sooner from his Lips did take Their flight, but that the Dead arose and spake. Him raised, Jesus to the Mother brought, Who over-joy'd was at the Wonder wrought, And all much marvell'd at the Mercy shown, And glory gave to the Almighty One: Professing that a mighty Prophet now His Isr'el had, to whom they all would bow. And straight the Fame of Jesus ran throughout Judea, and the Regions thereabout. MIRACLE XIII. Jesus's Cure of a Demoniack, who was Blind and Dumb, after his return to Capernaum; and of the difference and concertation between him and the Scribes about it. Wearied with Travel, and with Hunger spent, Into a House at Capernaum went Jesus and his Apostles, to appease Their craving Stomachs, and themselves to ease. Scarce were they entred in, but spreading Fame, Throughout the City, had divulg'd the same: Which brought the People in great numbers there, Where Jesus and his fainting Servants were; Who did the Cure of their Diseases press Unto him, with such moving earnestness, That neither he could so much leisure get, Nor his Apostles, as to take some Meat. Among the rest, who did to Jesus come, There was a poor Demoniack Blind and Dumb, Whose Friends did in an humble manner crave, That the poor Wretch his Sov'raign help might have. Jesus beholding with a tender Eye The sad Estate, in which the man did lye, Cast forth the Devil by his pow'rful word, Unloos'd his Tongue, and his lost sight restor'd; So that the blind and dumb man now was known To see, and talk to admiration. This wonder Jesus had no sooner done, But the amazed Multitude begun To entertain within their Breasts a thought Of just suspicion, that the man, who wrought Such famous Deeds, deserv'd no less a Name Than the Messias, that he was the same, The Son of David who was long foretold; And most there present this Belief did hold; But when the env'ous Pharisees, who were Haters of Jesus, did this saying hear, They then resolv'd their utmost skill to use, Behind the Back of Jesus, to traduce His Glorious Name, thinking thereby that they Might from him draw the peoples hearts away: But on himself they did not dare to set, Conscious that he would by the Contest get. Therefore, to bring their Hellish Plot to pass, (The rend'ring Jesus worthy of disgrace) They knew no better and no surer way Than this, to take—it cannot be (say they) That this same Fellow should be David's Son, (As ye suppose) who is of low Birth known: The Son of David, as ye all do know, Shall be a mighty Prince, shall great things do, Here in a Glorious Manner shall Command, And over us bear Rule, from whose strong hand We must expect deliverance from those Who are our potent and our deadly Foes; Whereas this Fellow is so mean a thing, So far from being such a Glorious King, That he deserves not to be thought on more, Being a Wretch so despicably poor. Besides, his Deeds most inconsistent are With the high Birth of David's Son and Heir; For with such Fellows he goes up and down As are of no repute, or learning known. Teaching such Doctrines which no Mortal Ear Before his coming did the like e're hear; Curing Diseases, in their Natures such As the most Sov'raign'st Drugs could never touch And casting Devils out of the Possest, By that Infernal Prince who sways the rest. Thus they asperst his ever-Blessed Name, And by this means thought to Eclipse his Fame; But what he did, or to his Charge was laid, His Friends, as yet, no Intimation had: Till at the length, unto their Ears was brought Both what he did, and by what means he wrought. And being then so generally known And talk'd of, they so credulous were grown, As to believe it true, and so instead Of clearing his good Name, they thought him mad, And out they went, with a resolved mind, Him, as one Frantick, with strong Chains to bind: But Jesus, who as they suppos'd was mad, Far other thoughts than his Relations had, Of what the Pharisees did go about, And had of him in secret given out: He knew they had in a most high degree Injur'd his Father, and notoriously Himself had slander'd, telling it about, The Pow'r, by which he cast the Devils out, Was to the Prince of the Infernal Club To be ascrib'd, The mighty Be'lzebub. Whereas the Pow'r by which he this did do, Did solely and of right belong unto His Father, who in Justice ought to have That Honour, which to Be'lzebub they gave. Calling therefore the Pharisees to him, Who to his Charge had laid so foul a Crime; And intimating to them, that he knew Their thoughts, and how behind his Back as true, They had reported that he went about, By Beelzebub casting Devils out; He plainly told them, that it could not well Be thought that he should those damn'd Fiends expell In such a manner as they said he did; Since Reason needs must such vain thought forbid: Because it could not in the least consist With Hell's Imperial Monarch's Interest, Herein to help him; for suppose he should Lend his Infernal Aid to him, it would Among his Subjects a division make, And the Foundation of his Empire shake, Laying the Pillars of his burning Throne In Fatal Ruine and Destruction. Herein his Kingdom being like unto Our Earthly Princes Kingdoms, which we know Cannot subsist, unless upheld they be By Concord, and among themselves agree. Again, those Men who do the Titles bear Of my Apostles, and your Children are, Do cast out Devils in my Name, and yet From you they meet with no reproof for it: If they such VVonders do, and in my Name, And by my Power, and receive no blame, VVhy then do ye so basely go about To censure me, for casting Devils out? Since in God's Name, and for his Glory too, And your Relief and Comfort this I do? VVere ye but with ingenuous Souls possest, Not Slaves to Envy or Self-Interest, You would not thus defame me as you do, But would ascribe my Miracles unto The pow'r of God, and by thus doing show, You own his Kingdom is now come to you. That this the time of the Messias is, VVhose Mission God hath testify'd with these Amazing wonders, which hee'd ne're have done, Had I not been his true but feigned Son. Besides I do not (as ye fancy) stand In need of Hells black Monarch's helping hand To cast out Devils, for let Reason sway, You must me free from this unlawful way; For I am stronger than he is, and so Into his closest dwelling-place can go, Bind him, and spoil his goods, when ever I Shall think it fit his sturdy force to try. His pow'r I know, compar'd to mine's so small, That let him use his utmost force, it shall Not hinder me from turning of him out Of them, he hath into's possession got. Once more, ye most ungrateful Wretches, I Declare unto you, that I work not by That Stygian Prince, for he's my mortal Foe, And truly merits to be reck'ned so: For who's not for me, must against me be, He being therefore so implacably Mine enemy, and no way to be brought And reconcil'd to me, it can't be thought Worthy of credit, that he ever should Help me to cast the Damned from their hold. So that, what ever Miracles I do, Must needs be own'd the work of God by you, And by his power wrought, who thinks not this, Thinks both of God and of my works amiss. Wherefore the causeless malice which you bear To me your Friend, let me no more of't hear, And don't, against your Consciences, defame My famous deeds, and my immortal Name; For seeing they were by the Spirit wrought Of the Eternal one, to go about To slander and oppose them, is a Crime So horrid, and so odious unto him, That if 'till death with an obdurate heart It meet, there can be no forgivness for't. And ye most justly merit to receive This rigid doom, since sland'rously ye have Imputed these my Miracles unto Man's restless Foe, and have affirmed too I work them by his Spirit, whereas I Do by his Spirit work, who's thron'd on High. For by so doing, if we must the Tree Judge by the fruit it bears, then surely ye Imply, that the eternal-Holy-Ghost, A Spirit is of the Infernal Host, Which is the highest blasphemy I know Can be immagin'd to affirm him so. Shall I (ye whited Sepulchers) declare, That ye a wretched sort of people are, And an infectious brood of Vipers? truly less I cannot, must not say of you than this, For what you are, your Language doth relate, Men of unhallow'd hearts and reprobate. Your words, which issue from them as the stream Doth from the Fountain, verifie this same. And as your words (which the true Tables are To show your hearts &amp; all that's treasur'd there) Are highly sinful, so by you they ought To be esteem'd as such, and think them not Too light or worthless (as ye seem to do) To be accounted for one day by you. For I declare, that ev'ry idle word That men shall speak, before the dreadful Lord Shall be computed for in that great day Of Judgment, when he will their Sins display; Much more shall they be to a reck'ning brought, Who have such words, as yours are, given out; Words full of Defamations and of Lies, Great slanders and notorious Blasphemies: For these they shall the dreadful doom receive Of the damn'd Spirits, and their Torments have, As they shall cleared and rewarded be For words that good are, to Eternity. Then, when the Scribes and Pharisees had heard These stabbing truths, which Jesus had declar'd, Dissembling in their hearts the deadly hate They bore unto him, humbly did intreat That he a Token would from Heaven give, Whereby they might upon good grounds believe, That the undoubted Christ of God he was, Sent from him to instruct them in his Laws. But Jesus, who did never guess amiss, Knowing they had a different end in this, That notwithstanding all their fair pretence, 'Twas but a snare to trap his innocence, That their chief cause in asking such a Sign Was but to take occasion to begin A quarrel with him, which with much more ease They might commence about such things as these, Than about them, which in their natures are Unto the outward Senses much more near. Thus said—A vile and wicked People call And seek for Signs, but there shall none at all, But that of Jonas, granted to them be, Who is a true and lively Type of me. For as three days and nights the Prophet lay (Excluded from a life-infusing Ray) Within his moving Scaly-Tomb shut fast, And was by God restor'd alive at last; So shall the Son of Man (of heav'nly Birth) Almost three days and nights within the Earth Entombed lye, and then again shall rise The third day, crown'd with lasting Victories; And they who by this means will not be wrought, And to conviction and repentance brought, Nor to the preaching of my Follo'wers give A willing ear, and what they teach believe, Shall by the Ninivites adjudged be, Because though they were in a high degree, Sinful, so sinful, that before the Face Of the great God came up their wickedness, Crying aloud, on them to shower down His dreadful vengeance from his sacred Throne: Yet, from the Prophets freedom from his Goal, The slimy Belly of the monst'rous Whale, And Preaching to them, they in Sack-Cloath went, And did sincerely of their Sins repent. Whereas against my Preaching you are now So stubborn, and so stifly bent, that though I am by much a greater Prophet known, Than Jonas, being the Eternal Son, God having testify'd of me this same By a loud Voice, which from the Heavens came; Yet to my Resurrection you'l not give Credit, nor be perswaded to believe What my Apostles by my Spirit shall Instruct you, so as to repent at all. That Famous Æthiopian Queen likewise, Shall up i'th' Judgment 'gainst this Nation rise, And it condemn, because she came from far, The Wisdom of King Solomon to hear: Whereas against me you have entertain'd So great displeasure, that you won't be gain'd To come and be inform'd of me, although To do't, you need no tedious Steps to go. And sure to most of you it must be known, That I am greater much than Solomon, And highly him in Wisdom do surpass, And therefore abler am, than e're he was, To give you both instructions, and advice, How to attain to be divinely wise. His Wisdom being in such things as here Occurr'd, and Natural and Humane were; Not such a Wisdom as was like to mine, Perfect in matters Sacred and Divine, And such a Wisdom, that would you but be Perswaded to embrace it heartily, Would make you wise, and so direct your feet, That you at last with endless Joys should meet. But as for you, and likewise for the rest Of this your Nation, who have been so blest With all-sufficient means to bring you to A timely Sorrow for your Sins, and who Have had so many Wonders 'mong you wrought, So many Fiends of the Possest cast out, And yet so far have hitherto been known From walking worthy of these Mercies shown, That ye the God of Love blasphemed have, By whom I Work, and who me Power gave, That let me tell you, ye are highly in A sad Condition through your wilful Sin, And that your State is much more hopeless now, By Satans second coming into you, Than 'twas before I liv'd among you here; Or than it would have been, if I had ne're Cast Satan out, for now he'll with him take (That he may safe his regain'd Conquest make) More, and worse Spirits, than he did before, To tempt you unto Sin, and make you more Wicked each day than other, until he Hath you involv'd in endless Misery. Many more Wonders than we here do write, Jesus perform'd in his Disciples sight: These are recorded, that you all might know Him, the Messiah, which was promis'd you; And that, believing him to be the same, You might have Life, through his Eternal Name. The Prayer of the Most Holy Jesus, before his Apprehension. Saint John. 1 Now when the great and glorious Son of Love Who for our Bliss forsook his own above, Had ended his Discourse, with lift up Eyes, And elevated Hands, to Heav'n he cryes, 2 Father the hour of my Death draws on For all Mankind, now glorifie thy Son, That I may be enabled to go through, The weighty business which I come to do. 3 And as my Power doth extend to All, To give Eternal Life, permit the fall Of none of those whom I came down to save, Let them the Merits of my Passion have. 4 All thou requirest to Enthrone Men there Where Joys most perfect and Eternal are, Is this, to own thee as the Supreme One, Thy Laws obey, and to embrace thy Son. 5 This I have publish'd since I came below, I have not fail'd thy sacred Will to show, Having now finish'd what I came for here, Attend, O heavenly Father, to my Pray'r. 6 When I have suffer'd what is due to Man, Receive me up unto thy Joys again, Give me that Glory which I had with Thee, Before the World was, from Eternity, 7 As for those Men, whom from their Callings thou Gav'st to attend me here, thy Will they know; From thee I did receive them, thine they were, My Will, as thine they have obey'd with care. 8 Those glorious things for which I did come down, I have not secret kept, but made them known, They have embrac'd that Message brought by me, Firmly believing that I came from thee. 9 For these peculiar Men to thee I pray, Confirm their Faith that no Temptation may Seduce their hearts, nor Terrors e're withdraw Their skilful Tongues from publishing thy Law. 10 For th'impenitent I no mention make, Let them the fruit of all their Sins partake; For them I pray, and for their constancy, Who are thy Gift, and who have served me. 11 These I commend unto thy gracious care, Now I am going hence, protect them here: I come to thee, O holy Father, keep From the devouring Wolves these harmless Sheep. 12 O let no Errour in their Doctrin be, Make them in that, as thou and I, agree, That in the end when they their course have run, They may sit down with an Immortal Crown. 13 While I was with them I have lost not one, But that same Rebel of Perdition, Of whom the Prophet Prophecy'd to be Ordain'd of Old, for this Apostacy. 14 But now I come to thee, yet, Lord, before I leave this World, I publickly implore That they may always, in my absence, have That joy and courage which my Presence gave. 15 They'l be expos'd, because they heav'nly are, To Perils and Afflictions, ev'ry where, Where they shall Preach that Faith they had from me, They'l find the World their mortal Enemy. 16 Yet I intreat thee not to take them hence, But keep them safe, and be their sure defence, That the approaching danger may not be Of force enough to shake their Constancy. 17 The World to them, as well as me, they'l find Will always prove most envious, and unkind; Yet sanctifie them so to Preach thy Word, That it may fruitful prove where-e're 'tis heard. 18 To preach thy Will into the World I came, I have impowr'd them to do the same; For them I intercede, and give to thee My Self, to fit them for the Ministry. 19 Yet pray I not for these alone, but all Who by the power of their Preaching shall Conform unto thy Word, that they, as we; May here be one, and in thy Faith agree. 20 That all who yet are unconverted, may Acknowledge thee, and all thy Laws obey, And of their gross Idolatries repent, And be convinc'd that I from thee was sent. 21 That Power, Father, which thou gav'st me here, Of working Wonders, my Disciples are Invested with the same, grant them to be No whit inferiour in their Works to Me. 22 That by those mighty Deeds which they shall do, When I am gone, the stubborn World may know. I came from thee, that thy affections are To them as great, as unto me they were. 23 Father, I will that all my Servants may Be where I am, for ever to injoy Thy gracious Love, that they may all behold The Glory which I had with thee of Old. 24 O Righteous Father, though the Worldly-wise Dis-own my Message, and thy Love despise, I know thy Will, my Servants know the same, From thy Eternal-Self they know I came. 25 Therefore those glorious Attributes of thine, And Will, I have, and will declare to mine; All things I'le give them which thou gav'st to me, Both Wisdom, Power, and Fidelity. On Jesus his Apprehension, Examination, Death, Resurrection and Ascension. When the Eternal Son these words had spoke, Unto the Mount of Olives o're the Brook Of Cedron, with his Followers he went, Where was a Garden, which they did frequent. Jesus, who knew the Tragedy of Sin, Must in that hallow'd-Plot of Ground begin, Bid his Disciples at the Door to stay, And thence not move, while he went in to Pray. Then taking with him Peter, James and John, (The three which once beheld th'Eternal Son, Cloath'd with a dazling-Cloud of shining Light Upon the Mount, that they the dismal Night Might see of Sorrow, which his Soul for Sin Was in that instant to be clouded in) Came to the place which he design'd should be, The doleful Theatre of his Agony. When to the three he freely did impart, What pungent Sorrows did assail his Heart, Commanding them upon their Guard to stand, And pray against the threatning Storms at hand; Not suffering Sleep upon their Eyes to creep, But a strict Watch over their Souls to keep, While he the troubles of an Innocent, And spotless Soul, in Pray'r to Heaven sent. Sad unto Death he found himself now brought, When he beheld the deadly bitter draught, The Cup of Vengeance, flowing to the Brim, Fill'd by the Hand of God, and reach'd to him. Then did the pressures of that monstrous Load, Our crying Sins, and the fierce Wrath of God, Cause his most guiltless Soul to groan and bow, Under the weight, and purple drops to flow Down his most sacred Body, through each Pore, Dying his Garments, and the Ground all o're. On which he thrice did fall, and thence sent up, As oft this Pray'r—Father remove this Cup— With such an humble Resignation still, That he submitted to his heav'nly Will. The careful Shepheard, whom no Sorrows could With-hold from looking to his little Fold, Betwixt the intervals of fervent Pray'r Went, and awoke them, who fast sleeping were. And twice the Three he gently did reprove, That they for him should show no greater Love, Amid'st his troubles, than they had exprest, Sleeping, while he with Sorrow was deprest. But at his third return, their fill of Sleep He bid them take, in vain it was to keep A Watch, since now what he had oft foretold Was come to pass, the Son of Man was sold Into the hands of Sinners, who were now Entring with that bold-Wretch, who this did do, His Apprehension. VVhen lo, the Traytor to the Garden Door VVas come, and enter'd with a number more Of armed Men, who by the Sanhedrim VVere order'd as a Guard to wait on him. Jesus, who this, and all things else foreknew, Instead of flying meets the armed Crew, And boldly asks them, wherefore they came out VVith Lights, and VVeapons, whom it was they sought? Straight as one Voice the servile Slaves do cry, Jesus of Naz'reth; Jesus made reply, I am the Man ye seek; no sooner he Had this confest, but they immediately Fell to the Ground, as if with Lightning strook At his Almighty Voice, and dreadful look; Grov'ling upon the Earth they speechless lay, Till he again the second time did say, VVhom do ye seek? At this they all arise, With trembling Limbs, and with distorted Eyes, And told him Jesus, Jesus, was his Name Who preach'd Sedition, and for whom they came. Lo, said the Holy Jesus, I am he, If you seek me, give these their liberty: Then had that saying of his, I lost not one Of all thou gav'st me, its completion. Now Simon Peter, all enraged drew His long-sheath'd-Sword, into the Crowd he flew With a most zealous Courage, void of fear, At the first stroke he cuts off Malchus Ear, And while his sturdy Arm was dealing blows On ev'ry hand amid'st his Masters Foes, Jesus calls out, and bids him sheath his Sword, His Fury stopt at his commanding Word, Peter, said he, shall I not drink the Cup Sent by my Father, yes I'le drink it up. Since 'tis determin'd, Souldiers come away, What Heav'n commands, I must, and will obey. Then came the Souldiers, and the sacred Hands Of Jesus bound, with their thrice-twisted-Bands. Unto the house of Annas (who then was Prince of the Sanh'drim, and to Cajaphas Father in Law) immediately they go, And with big looks their willing Captive show. His Examination. Forth of the env'ous-Crowd the Judg calls out The blessed Jesus, questions him about His Servants, and his Doctrin, why he taught In Corners, that which such dissention wrought. Jesus reply'd, what from my Lips hath fell, Most of this Nation can inform thee well, In the Assembly of the Jews have I Publish'd that Faith, for which I now must dye. Ne're in forbidden Corners did I sneak, But in their Temples publickly I spake; If these my Words no Credit can command, Ask them the Truth of this who here do stand. At this a Serjeant who was standing near, Up with his impious Fist, and on the Ear Gave him a rude Salute, asking him why Unto the Judg he talk'd so saucily! Jesus reply'd, if I have spoken ill, Prove then the Crime, but if no words have fell VVhich do deserve such a rebuke from thee, How comes it then to pass thou smitest me? Now Annas, who no Pow'r had to declare Judgment, except the Sev'nty present were, Fast bound unto the House of the High-Priest, To be examin'd, sent the ever-Blest. Him follows Peter, and his dearest John, The rest were trembling to their Houses gone, This last Disciple was to Cajaphas known. He with his Fetter'd Master 'mongst the rest, Enters the Palace of the Jews High Priest, But missing Peter in the num'rous Rout, Who at the Door stood Sorrowing without, Unto the Maid he goes, at his request, Simon admittance had among the rest. It being cold, within the Palace-Hall A Fire was made, the Souldiers round it all Stood warming of themselves, by the Hearths side, The pensive Peter stood while Christ was try'd. By a Divine-Impulse a Damsel goes And Simon asks, Art thou not one of those Who serv'd this Jesus, whom they here have brought? The daunted Servant said he knew him not. He who but even now had drawn his Sword In the Defence of his beloved Lord, That matchless Courage, by a Maid alone, VVas made to tremble, and his Lord disown. The Lamb of Life, who a long time had been Under the snaring Test o'th' Sanhedrim, VVhen they perceiv'd from his own Mouth they could Not force the least unwary word that would Give a pretence to bring his Death about, False Witnesses the murd'rous Villains sought. Sev'ral there came, who sundry things did bring, But none of weight, nor two that vouch'd one thing. At length a Pair of daring-Rogues were found, VVhose Souls ne're felt a penitential-Wound, That said, This Man affirm'd—Do you destroy The Temple which is now all Isr'els Joy, And from the Ground again I'le eas'ly raise Its Head (as now it stands) within three days. Then from his Seat arose the Jews High-Priest, With Eye-brows knit, and Eyes which Rage confest, Demanding sternly what his Silence meant, VVhether he Guilty was, or Innocent? But Jesus held his peace; which when he saw That from his Mouth his Threats could nothing draw, Cloathing his Face with a more peaceful Look, To a more cunning Wile himself betook; Adjuring him by a most sacred Oath, The living God, to tell the naked Troth, Whether the Christ he were, the Great God's Son, Who from the Clouds in Glory should come down. Jesus whose Tongue was never us'd to Lye, Knowing the hour of his Death drew nigh, Confest he was the same, and likewise told, That he whom now they did with Scorn behold, They Reassum'd into the Heav'ns should see, And Thron'd on the right Hand of Majesty, As visibly as at the Gen'ral-Doom, By those dire Judgments which on them should come. Then Cajaphas his Cloaths with Fury rent, And to's embosom'd Hellish-Flames gave vent; What farther need is there of Proof, said he, Since we have heard this horrid Blasphemy; Your Judgments, Sirs; Doth he deserve to Dy? The Vote was Death, and that deservedly. Then Jesus forth into the Hall was brought, Unto the Souldiers, to be set at naught; Upon whose Face the dev'lish Monsters spit, And on his sacred Sides their Cudgels split. Hood-Winck'd, they Beat him, on the Muffled Face, And bid him Proph'cy who the Smiter was. All the out-ragious Cruelties that Men Could Muster up, were Executed then On the most inn'cent Lamb, until the Light Drew back the Curtains of that grizly-Night. Peter, who boldly once resolv'd to Dye The worst of Deaths, rather than Christ deny, Who once already, by the Fire-side, The ever-Blest had cowardly denyed; And still there senseless stood, and saw the Jews The Worlds great Ransom barbarously abuse, Was by a Maid again, amid'st the Throng, Ask'd if he did not unto Christ belong; But he although forewarn'd, disown'd once more His lovely Service; as he did before. One of the High-Priests Servants, who was near Rely'd to Malchus, that had lost his Ear, To the forgetful Peter came, said he, Art thou not one of those which I did see With this Man in the Garden, tell me now? Simon for-swore it, then the Cock did Crow. When at that instant Jesus cast an Eye Upon his Servant, who immediately Struck both with Shame and Sorrow, forth did go, And by his Tears his true Repentance show. Thirsty for Blood, just at the dawn of Day, The Sanhedrim triumphingly away Their Pris'ner Led unto the Pretor's Hall; Come to the Door, they did for Pilate call; Within the Hall they would not set a Foot, Fondly conceiting that they should pollute Themselves, in mingling with the Heathen there, Being they were to eat the Passover. Pilate inform'd that at his Palace-gate, A great Convention of the Jews did wait, To speak with him, that they had Jesus brought, Straight he arose, and to the Jews came out. Jesus presented, Pilate ask'd the Jews, What was the Crime, for which they did accuse Him whom they brought, what evil he had done? Mov'd by a furious Zeal, the Scribes begun To tax him of Sedition, and that he Stirr'd up the People to a Mutiny. How that his Doctrin was against their Laws, And that no Tribute due to Cæsar was; That he declar'd himself the Christ to be, And saying so spoke horrid Blasphemy. He proudly vaunted that he was their King, And Death did merit for that only thing; Therefore they all made it their earnest Suit, That this Seducer he would Execute. Pilate perceiving more of Rage to be In their request, than ought of Piety; Take him, said he, and by your own Law try, Whether he doth deserve to Live or Dye. Thou know'st, said they, the Romans of this Right, Which once we had, have now depriv'd us quite, Leaving no pow'r in us to punish those With Death, who have transgrest against our Laws; To thee we come, and e're we'll stir from hence, We do expect thou'lt Judg this Man's offence. Back to the Judgment-Hall the Pretor went, Seated within the dreadful Chair, he sent One for the Pris'ner, who was straight brought in, With whom th'imperious Judg did thus begin. Tell me, said he, art thou the King o'th' Jews? Jesus reply'd, do they without accuse Me of this Crime, or doth this Question spring From thy own Brain, to say I am a King? Am I a Jew, said Pilate? Do I read Their Books, to know what they are promised, Or whom they do expect? Not I, but they Who are without, charge thee with what I say. Tell me the great Offence which thou hast done To make them bring this Accusation. The blessed Jesus, not at all dismaid, At this their Charge, unto his Judg thus said, As for an earthly Kingdom, I ne're sought, Had I done this, my Servants would have fought, And not have suffer'd what you see, these Bands, But rescu'd me from my Oppressors Hands. Now since they did not Fight in my Defence, You may conclude my Kingdom's not from hence. What dost thou own, said Pilate, unto me Thou art a King, and hast Authority. Jesus reply'd, 'tis true, a King I am, To be a Witness to the Truth I came Into the VVorld, the Pious do submit Unto my Rule, and never question it. Then Pilate ask'd him, what by Truth he meant, But waited not his Answer, out he went Unto the Jews, &amp; ask'd them why they brought This Man to him, in whom he found no fault. You know you have a Custom ev'ry Year, When you do celebrate your Passover, That I release a Pris'ner, whom ye chuse, Will ye that I set free the King o'th' Jews? Enrag'd at this; they all Barabbas cry, Barabbas we will have, let this Man dye. Now this Barabbas was a Robber known, And cast in Prison for a Murder done. Pilate much fearing that the stubborn Jews Would make an uproar, if he should refuse To punish Jesus, forthwith gave command Unto a Souldier of the Roman-Band, To Scourge the Pris'ner, hoping they would be Appeas'd with this, and Vote his Liberty. From Head to Foot the Villain strips him bare, And with his Scourge his tender Flesh doth tear, A Crown of Thorns the Souldiers wreath, which done, Upon his sacred Brow they crush it on. Pierc'd to the Skull, down trills the purple Goar, In trembling drops upon the blushing Floor. A purple Robe of Tyrian-dy they throw, Upon his Shoulders, with the Knee they bow, And thus salute him,—Hail great King o'th' Jews, His tender Sides with cruel Rods they bruise, Thus rudely us'd, Pilate goes forth again, And tells the Jews he finds no fault i'th' Man. Him follows Jesus with their marks of Scorn, A purple Robe, and Diadem of Thorn. Pilate presents him to them, lo, said he, What's here of Terrour, or of Majesty? Neither his Wounds, nor Tears of Blood, could move Their Savage-Breasts to show one spark of Love. The sight of them encreast their Thirst the more, After his Death, the Souldiers o're and o're, With the Chief Priests importunately cry, To have him judg'd to Death immediately. When Pilate found that nothing would asswage But Death, the burning Passion of their Rage, Take him, said he, for I profess I find No fault in him, and if you have a mind To have him dye, do you your selves the deed, I dare no farther in this Case proceed. We have a Law, and by that Law you may, Reply the Jews, the great Blasphemer slay; Who makes himself the Son of the Most High, As he hath done, ought by our Laws to Dye. The Son of God, the Jews no sooner said, But Pilate trembled, and was sore affraid; With hasty Steps unto the Judgment-Hall He goes again, and doth for Jesus call. The tortur'd Pris'ner was no sooner come, But he demands what Lineage he came from. To him no Answer Jesus doth afford, Long he expects, but doth not get one word. Wilt thou not speak, said Pilate, unto me, Who have the pow'r to kill, or set thee free? I own thy pow'r said Jesus, and submit Unto the Cross when thou shalt sentence it. Yet know, the power thou hast over me From God proceeds, 'tis he who gives it thee. Therefore the greater Sins the Jews commit, Who make thy power to their Wills submit, To crucifie the great Creator's, Son, Meerly because they will it should be done. Appall'd at this, from henceforth Pilate sought To free his Pris'ner, but the Jews cry'd out, Thou art not Cæsars Friend, nor do'st discharge Thine Office truly, should'st thou him enlarge; Who makes himself our King, and he doth so, Deserves to Dye, for he is Cæsar's Foe. Then Pilate hearing what the Jews did say, Into the place he went call'd Gabbatha. Down on the Seat of Judgment straight he sate, Commanding Jesus forthwith to be brought, This on the Preparation-day was done Of their great Feast, &amp; 'twas towards the Noon; Behold your King, said Pilate, they all cry, Away, away with him, and let him Dye. Will ye consent unto so foul a thing, Said Pilate, as to Crucifie your King? Cæsar's our King, no other King we'll own, For this bold Wretch who claims a Sov'raign-Throne, Reply'd the Jews, we know his Father's Name, And the despised Town from whence he came; And scorn to yield our Necks to such a One, Who a Blasphemer is, and Rebel known. His Death. Pilate, with this their Envy over-come, Past from his trembling-Lips the final Doom, Decreed by the great God, to drink the Cup, And then most vilely gave his Pris'ner up Unto their Rage, who to the Slaughter goes, Dumb as a Lamb mid'st his insulting Foes; Bearing his Cross, most of that tedious way As he ascended unto Golgotha. Where being come, and nail'd upon the Wood Through both the Hands and Feet, these Monsters stood, And with reproachful Terms did him revile; Though for their Sins his Wounds did bleed the while. Two guilty Villains one on either side, Of this most spotless Lamb they Crucify'd. Such an inglorious End to him they gave VVho had no Sin, but Sinners came to save. Over his Cross after the Roman Rite, Pilate his Accusation thus did Write, Jesus of Naz'reth the King of the Jews, In Syriack, Greek, and Latin, he did chuse To have it Writ, because the place was nigh To Salem, where this Victim hung on high. And many People were assembled there To celebrate the Feast and Passover. When the Chief Priests and Scribes the Title read They humbly begg'd to have it altered, And in the Room of it upon the Cross To write, he said, the King o'th' Jews he was. But Pilate told them what is writ, is writ, I am resolv'd, I will not alter it. Now when the Souldiers had their duties done, And crucify'd the great Jehovah's Son, Before his spotless Soul had took its flight, From its most pure abode, they in his sight Seiz'd on his Garments, to division went, And in four parts his under Vest they rent; Each took his share, but when the seamless Coat All of one piece, wove from the top throughout, They had well view'd, they judg'd 'twould useless be If it were torn, therefore they all agree, That he who with the Dice could highest throw, The whole entire Vest to him should go. These things they did that David's Prophecy, Which he foretold of them, fulfill'd might be. Now by the Cross of Jesus, full of grief The ever-blessed Virgin, with the Wife Of Cleophas were standing, and with them The pen'tent Mary, all in Tears for him. When Jesus mid'st his Tortures did espy These three, and John lamenting bitterly, He calls his Mother, and his dearest John, Woman, says he to her, behold thy Son; To the Disciple he did likewise say, Behold thy Mother; from that very day Unto his house she went, as if she were His aged Mother he did treat her there, With great respect, and tenderness of care. Jesus consid'ring that his work was done, Each Prophecy fulfill'd, but only one, That that might have its full completion. He said I thirst—well might that Tongue be dry, Whose Soul was scorch'd with such an Agony. VVho bore a Burden none could bear but him, The VVrath of God due to the VVorld for Sin. When lo the comfort which these Tygers yield, Ty'd to an Hysop-stalk a Spung they fill'd, Out of a Vessel which was standing near, Full to the top of Gall and Vinegar; This to his sacred mouth they put, which he No sooner tasted, but immediately He bow'd the Head, and bowing did commend His Soul to God, and so his Life did end. Then did the Sun, astonish'd at the sight, From twelve to three, obscure his glorious Light. O're all the Land th'affrighted Earth did quake, And made that stately Pile the Temple shake, So that its strong Partition-Wall of Stone Clave in two parts, with the Convulsion. The Graves were open'd, and the Saints arose From their cold Lodgings, and appear'd to those Within the City; the Centurion, Who guarded Jesus, seeing what was done; Trembling confest he was th'Almighty's Son. Yet the remorsless Jews would not relent, At these prodigious Signs, but joyntly went To Pilate, and maliciously request, That since the morrow was a day of Rest, And the great day of their unleaven'd Feast, He'd give command, their Legs first being broke, Down from the Cross their Bodies might be took. Pilate commands his Officers to do What they desir'd, to the first they go, And broke his Legs, they serv'd the other so. But when they came to Jesus, and perceiv'd How that already he his last had breath'd; They broke not his, but in his sacred Side, One of the Souldiers broach'd a Wound so That from the bloody Fountain gushing came wide, Unmixed Water, with the purple Stream. He who stood by, and saw these things doth give This true Relation, that ye might believe; With this do both those Prophesies agree, That in the Psalms, and that in Zachary. Now when this horrid Tragedy was done, And from the Cross the Son of God ta'ne down, Joseph of Arimathea, a devout But secret Follower of the Lord, besought Pilate to have the freedom to Inter The blessed Jesus, in his Sepulchre. Pilate consents, come where his Master lay, His sacred Body he removes away Unto a Garden of his own hard by, Where was a Tomb hew'n for himself to lye. Him follows Nicodemus, (who was one That in the night to Jesus oft was known To come) into the Garden with Perfumes, Of Myrrhe and Aloes, those embalming Gums. Which rich Perfumes were then among the Jews For the Interment of their Dead in use. With these in Linnen-Swaths upon the Ground, Joseph and he, their dearest Master wound, And then the Body both of them convey, Unto a Tomb wherein no man yet lay, Having no time, their Sabbath drawing near, To hew him out another Sepulchre. His Resurrection. Early upon the first day of the Week Unto the Tomb, just as the day did break, With Aromatick Spices Mary came The Body of her Saviour to embalm. When she perceiv'd (what she took care to have) The massy Stone roll'd from the mouth o'th' Grave, She stooping look'd into the sacred Vault, But found not him whom her Affection sought. Seiz'd with a dreadful fear, she nimbly run Unto the house, where Peter was, and John, And told them how some envious Jew away Had stole her Master, but where now he lay She could not tell, nor light of any one That could inform her, who the deed had done. Both the Disciples hearing what she said, In haste arose, and to the Garden made; But John the nimbler of the two did come, Long before Peter, to the empty Tomb. And stooping down, he look'd and did espy, Within the dreadful Grave the Swaths to lye, Yet went not in but trembling waited there, Till Simon came unto the Sepulchre. Who boldly entring saw upon the Ground, The Linnen-Swaths, which once his Master wound, And neatly folded up, by them he found The Napkin lying which his Temples bound. But in no Corner, as he idly thought, Could he perceive him in the silent Vault. Then forth he came, and John went in to view, Both saw, and both believ'd the Story true, Which Mary told, though they had heard him say, Often that he should rise on the third day, Neither to him, nor Scripture did they give So much regard, as either to believe. But to their homes they both, amaz'd to see The Body gone, return'd immediately. Now Mary Magdalene who did out-go, In an obsequious Love, the other two; Staid weeping at the Grave, and looking down, Within the Tomb she saw two men unknown, One at the Head, the other at the Feet, Sit where her Lord had lain, cloath'd all in White. Both ask'd the reason why she sorr'wing stood, And from her Eyes showr'd down that pearly Flood. Why should you ask me this, since him I lov'd, Who here was buried, they have hence remov'd; And what is now become of him, said she, Fain would I know, but none will tell it me. Why 'mong the Dead, should you suppose to find The Living, said the Angels, call to mind, Did he not tell you he would rise again On the third day, he hath perform'd the same. To his Disciples go, and tell them He Is risen, and will go to Galilee. As she was turning from the Sepulchre, Doubting the Truth of what they told to her, She saw the Person whom she weeping sought Standing behind her, but she knew him not; Jesus, who knew her Love, and saw her Tears, Willing to dry them up, and ease her Fears; Ask'd her why she lamented, and for whom She was in Search into the Garden come? Sir, if thou art the Gard'ner who do'st look Unto this place (said she) and hence hast took, The Body, tell me now but where it lyes, And it shall never more offend thine Eyes, For at my own expence I will take care To find for it another Sepulchre? Mary, saith Jesus; straight the Voice she knew, And cry'd Rabboni, Master, Is it you? Prostrate upon the earth to kiss his Feet, She threw her self, ravish'd again to meet Him rais'd to Life, whom she thought dead, but he VVould not allow her love such liberty. Forbear, said he, as yet I have not been Up with my Father, to my Brethren Haste, and assure them to my God I go, In Heaven to provide a place for you. Then to the place where the Disciples were, The joyful Mary came, and did declare How she had seen the Lord, and likewise what He did command, but they believ'd her not. When in the Ev'ning of that day, they were Assembled, with the Doors close shut, for fear Of the malicious Jews, in Jesus came They knew not how, and thus saluted them— Peace be unto you—when he had so said They trembling stood, most terribly affraid, Concluding that it could not Jesus be, But a delusion which they there did see. Yet when he show'd his Hands and wounded Side Those Marks which he receiv'd when Crucify'd, Their Souls rejoyc'd, and all with one accord Acknowledg'd him to be their Sov'raign Lord. He therefore to confirm their Faith, begun T'expound the Scriptures, which had long foreshown His cruel Death, and Resurrection. And by his Spirit made them plainly see The full import of ev'ry Prophecy. And now farewell, said he, yet 'fore I go, The same Commission I do give to you, Which I receiv'd, to plant a Church I came, Do ye succeed me, and compleat the same. Be of good comfort, to assist you here I'le send you down the blessed Comforter. But here attend ye, till he doth come down Then did he go, and breath on ev'ry one, And by so doing did his Followers fit For that unerring guide the Holy Sp'rit. Which at the Feast of Pentecost came down, And sate like flaming-Fire, on ev'ry one. He gave the Keys of Heav'ns glorious Gate Into their Hands, to Excommunicate The stubborn Sinner, to absolve or bind They Power had, as they just cause did find. But Thomas, called Dydimus, the Twin, Who was not with them when the Lord came in, Now being come, they up and told him how Jesus had with them been but even now. But he declar'd, unless his Eyes did see, And Hands did touch his Wounds, he'd faithless be. When his Disciples that day sev'nights were Met at their usual Place to joyn in Pray'r, The Lord of Life the second time did come, They knew not how into the close-shut Room. Thomas, said he, since you will not believe Your Fellow-Servants that I am alive, Except your Hands do touch, and Eyes do see, Those cruel Marks the Jews bestow'd on me; Behold my Wounds, thy Fingers thrust into This Side of mine, and be not faithless now. My Lord and God! said Thomas, now I know And am convin'd, the very God art thou. Had'st thou before believ'd what thou hast seen, Thy Faith, said Jesus, had then nobler been Than now it is, my blessing I do give To them who see me not, and yet believe. His Ascension. Full forty days th'Eternal Son of God, After he rose again, on Earth abode. Teaching his Followers what they ought to do, To make the World his Fathers Will to know, And now just ready to ascend his Throne, To take possession of his purchas'd Crown, He went unto Mount-Olivet with them, Sev'n Furlongs distant from Jerusalem. Upon whose lofty Brow with Hands lift high, Unto the sacred Throne of Majesty, He blessed them, which having done, a bright And shining Cloud convey'd him from their sight, Up to the glorious Seat of Bliss where He, Triumphant sits to all Eternity. On Christ's Sufferings. Lord, what is Man! that thou from Bliss, Where Love in full perfection is, Should'st send thy Son, thine only One, To be contemn'd, and spit upon, To be the abject and the scorn, Of ev'ry Villain, to be torn With cruel Rods, to be revil'd, And live as 'twere a life exil'd; And after all this ignomy, To hang on the accursed Tree. That the eternal God above Should chuse this way, to show his Love To such as we, who do return, Instead of gratitude, our scorn; That he his only Son should send, To suffer an inglorious end, And make the Innocent to be An Offering for Impiety, It raises wonder, but 'twas so, Jesus did all this undergo; Not by compulsion, 'twas his choice He suffer'd, that we might rejoyce. All this he did for to regain Lost Souls from an eternal pain. And, Jesus, shall not we express Our thanks to thee for happiness; Had'st thou not dy'd we had remain'd, As Satans Victims, ever chain'd; No act of ours could e're have wrought That Reconcilement, thou hast bought, With thy dear Blood; thou Heav'ns Rage Did'st fully with thy Death asswage. Such obligations, Lord, should move Our stony-hearts to melt with Love, And in the strictest duty bind To thee the Souls of all Man-kind. To the Eternal Three above, Father, Son, and Spirit of Love, By all the glorious Host in Heav'n, And Men on Earth, be Glory giv'n. EIGHTEEN OF David's PSALMS PARAPHRAS'D. By the same Hand. PSALM 22. My God, my God! Why am I left Helpless, in my distress bereft Of that protection I have had, Why are my Foes with Conquest clad? I call and weep both day and night, To thee, my God, to thee for right. But, O my Crys and Tears are vain, There's no redress, no ease of pain. All this shall not discourage me, Since I do know thou just wilt be; And true to ev'ry promise, Thou Hast bound thy Self to me by Vow. And though Thou let'st mine Enemys Insult, and deaf art to my Crys, Yet, Lord, thou holy art, and still Deserv'st the praise of Israel. Our Fathers they rely'd on thee, Thou, Lord, wast their security. When dangers did their Souls surround, To thee they call'd, and freedom found. But I my Foes most deadly scorn With patience hitherto have born; The vulgar and ignobler sort Do make my misery their sport, In an insulting way they cry, Let his Salvation now draw nigh, He trusted in the Lord, that he Would help him in adversity, Let him stretch out his arm and save, If either strength or pow'r he have. But, Lord, their scorn and cruelty, Shall not dismay or trouble me; Since I have always found thine arm Able to rescue me from harm; Since from the Womb I came, alone Thou hast been my Salvation; And from my Mothers tender Breast, My God, my hope wert, and my rest. Now be not far from me, but save, Permit not the triumphing Grave, Insatiate as my cruel-Foes, My Life untimely to enclose. Redeem my Soul, there's none, I know, Except my God, can help me now; For I am close besieg'd, and brought To that distress I can't get out. Like as a rav'ning Lyon doth, Roaring pursue with open mouth The helpless Creature, that he may Affrighted fall, and be his Prey; So do my Foes threaten, and rave, To bring my Soul unto the Grave. So week and feeble I am grown, Wasted to nothing, ev'ry bone Disjoynted, from its place doth start, Like Wax dissolv'd so is my Heart. And as a Potsheard so my strength Is dryed up, my Tongue at length Cleaves to my Jaws, my earthly-Frame Is now returning whence it came. For the blood-thirsty have beset And clos'd me round, my Hands and Feet They have transfixt, distended on The shameful Cross, I ev'ry Bone Can truly count, as if I were A Monster, they upon me stare. And having got me in their Toyl, They reckon all I have their Spoil. They part my Garments, but the Lot Is cast upon my seamless Coat; Contented rather than it tear The whole should go to one Mans share. But be not far from me, O Lord, My chiefest strength, thy help afford; And from these bloody-Men set free Thine only One, O rescue me! And as in former time thine Ear Hath open been unto my pray'r, Be ready now my Life to save, From the devouring Jaws o'th' Grave. Then in the Congregation I Will sing thy praise contin'ally, And to thy Faithful there declare, How great thy Love and Mercies are. Ye Seed of Jacob spend your days In Songs of Thanks, and hearty Praise, For he hath not despis'd my Pray'r When in Affliction, but his Ear Hath been attentive, and his Face He hath not vail'd in my disgrace. All my discourses Lord shall be Of these thy Favours shown to me; My Vows within thine House I'le pay, Among the Faithful, that they may Joyn in Devotion, and each one Send up their thanks unto thy Throne; Remembring that in times of want Thou evermore art pleas'd to grant Unto the poor, when they do call, Refreshments, to rejoyce them all. Those Nations who thy Laws do scorn, When they hear this, shall to thee turn, And joyntly yield with one accord To worship thee, as Supreme Lord, For thou art Governour of all, And all must to thy Footstool fall. Those thou hast fill'd with good shall bow And they who to the Pit do go, Who none of all thy VVonders know, Their Seed shall serve thee, they thy worth And righteousness shall warble forth, From age to age shall be made known This that thou Lord for me hast done. That all men may as well as I, Confide in thee for Victory. PSALM 23. 1 The Lord my Shepheard is, whose care Doth over me preside; No want, nor any tort'ring fear, Shall long with me abide. 2 He into flow'ry Meads doth bring Me, where I feed all day, And leads me to the bubling Spring, Where I my thirst allay. 3 His Spirit doth my Soul revive, And for his Name-sake he Doth gently lead me, while I live, In paths of Piety. 4 Though I should greatly be distrest, O're-whelm'd in deep despair, On thy protection, Lord, I'd rest, And would no evil fear. 5 For thou my Shepherd art, thy Sheep Thou never do'st neglect, My Soul thou wilt from danger keep, And safely me protect. 6 In presence of my envious Foes, Thou do'st my Table spread, My Cup with sprightly Wine o're-flows, Sweet Oyls anoint my Head. 7 Mercy and Truth in a full Tyde Shall ever follow me, Within thine House I will reside, And sing my praise of thee. PSALM 25. 1 My God, in deep distress, I lift my Soul to thee, There's none so timely can redress, As thou, my misery. 2 Since I my trust repose In thee my sure defence, Exalt my name, lest that my Foes Deride my confidence. 3 Shame none who love thy Laws, Let the perfideous be Cloath'd with contempt, who without cause contemn thy Saints, and Thee. 4 Each minute I implore Thy special Grace, O show Thy Servant how he evermore Thy sacred Will may do. 5 Keep me as thou hast done, In thine unerring way, Thou God of my Salvation, Permit me not to stray. 6 But call to mind that love And bounty I have seen, A God of tender mercies prove, As thou of old hast been. 7 As for those days I spent In Sins of high degrees, Remember not, now I repent Those grand impurities. 8 But as thy mercy's great, Let thy compassions shine Upon a wretched Profligate, Who humbly now is thine. 9 Thou art most good and just, And 'tis thy glory, Lord, To teach trasgressors how they must Conform unto thy Word. 10 All those who humble are, In Judgment he will guide, From vertuous paths he doth declare Their Feet shall never slide. 11 His mercy ever lives, His truth doth never dye, Of these the fruits he ever gives To his continually. 12 Forgive me then, O Lord, Those Sins of high degree, Which I have wrought, O loose the Cord Of mine Iniquity. 13 Who dreads to disobey, The Lord will not refuse To teach that man the saving way, His Soul should always chuse. 14 His Barns and Coffers shall Enjoy the richest store, His Seed shall here inherit all He leaves, and ten times more. 15 Nor will he e're conceal Those duties he should do, What is of moment to reveal He shall be sure to know. 16 So now what ever strait Attends my wandring Feet, On my Salvation I will wait, Who'l free me from the Net. 17 Thy help I now implore, Have mercy, Lord, on me, Make bare thine Arm as heretofore, For I have need of thee. 18 Free me in my distress, The pressures of my heart Do ev'ry minute, Lord, encrease, O show thy saving art. 19 Forgive those Sins which are The cause of all this hate, Which my malicious Foes declare, My case commiserate. 20 For dayly they encrease, And hate mine innocence, Unjustly they disturb my peace, Chastise their insolence. 21 And in thine arms infold My Soul which trusts in thee, Mine innocence, O God, uphold, As thou hast promis'd me. 22 O free thine Israel From troubles which inclose His habitations, make him dwell Secure amidst his Foes. PSALM 31. 1 In thee, O Lord, I place my trust, Bow down thine Ear, and from the Grave Preserve my Life, as thou art just, And shew thy mighty Arm can save. O let me never suffer shame For my affiance in thy Name. 2 Be thou my Rock, and Castle strong, When any threat'ning storms appear, Where I may rest secure from wrong, Till all the Clouds dispersed are. Direct and guide me all my days, Through all the Lab'rinths of my ways. 3 Into thy hands I do commit My very Soul, redeem'd by thee, Enlarge my Feet, from out the Net In secret laid to mischief me. Thou know'st, O Lord, thou God of truth, Thine I have been up from my youth. 4 In thee the Saviour of the Just, Not in the Gentile Vanities, I have repos'd my chiefest trust, Lord I abhor their practices; And always thought their Auguries, And Divinations to be lies. 5 All my delight and joy shall be To reckon up thy mercies shown, In Troubles thou hast thought on me, And set my Feet in a large room, Free from the rage of all my Foes, Whose malice did my Life inclose. 6 Yet I no end of trouble know, I sigh, and mourn, my years away, My Sins have brought me very low; For want of Flesh my Bones decay. Mine Eye it is consum'd with grief, Have mercy Lord, and send relief. 7 For I am made the mirth and scorn As well of Friends, as Enemies, They count me as a man forlorn, Because thou deaf art to my cries; Strangers and Friends, as men affraid, Fly from me, and withdraw their Aid. 8 Like as a man that's dead and gone, Or as a Potters broken Pot, Fit for no use I'm look'd upon, Thrown out of Doors and quite forgot; But show thy skill, and save my Soul, As thou hast broke, so make me whole. 9 Lord I have heard the slaundrous lyes, And scoffs of my invet'rate Foes, Up in Rebellion they devise To cut me off, but interpose, For I have put my trust in thee, Thou art my God, O rescue me. 10 Thou better know'st, O Lord, than I When is the fittest time to send Thy ready Succours, then draw nigh, To all my troubles put an end; Upon me make thy Face to shine, And save him who was ever thine. 11 For since I have addrest my Pray'rs To thee, thine honour lies at stake, To set me free from all my fears. The Wicked who thy Laws forsake Cut off, but Lord my Life defend, And let confusion be their end. 12 Silence the lying Lips of those Who in a proud and scornful way, Asperse thy Saints, the righteous, Before the Sons of Men, one day Thou wilt their injur'd Fames restore, To their full Shine they had before. 13 Under thy Wings they shall abide, Secure from the Oppressours wrongs, In thy Pavillion thou shalt hide, And keep them safe from strife of Tongues. Blest be my God, whose help I found, When num'rous Foes begirt me round. 14 Yet I was tempted in my flight, To think I should a Victim fall, Though thou had'st often shown thy might, Unto the furious Rage of Saul; But I no sooner did address My Pray'rs to thee, but found redress. 15 Let all his Saints with me adore, And love the Lord, who doth preserve The faithful, but doth evermore Reward the proud as they deserve; Courage like Men, but act your parts, And God shall strengthen all your hearts. PSALM 40. 1 Fully resolv'd with patience to attend, Until the Lord had granted my request, I found at length my Pray'rs obtain'd their end, He calm'd those fears which gave my Soul no rest. 2 And brought me safe out of that dreadful Pit Of misery wherein I long was held, As on a Rock he firmly set my feet, And all my goings afterwards upheld. 3 For these his Mercies I'le extol his Name, And will from day to day extol his praise, Many shall fear him when they hear this same, And render true obedience to his ways. 4 That Soul is blest who wholly doth rely Not in the strength of Man, whose frame is dust, Who dis-regards the Proud, and those that lye, Contemns their aid, but in the Lord doth trust. 5 Those gracious works which thou for us hast done, Should I endeavour to recount them all In order, Lord, I cannot set them down, Not the one half to my remembrance call. 6 I know full well thou do'st no pleasure take In Sacrifices, or Burnt-Offerings, These are but Shaddows and will prove too weak, To take away the guilt of all our Sins. 7 Thy Son must come, and then our sins they shall By an Oblation of himself, Lord, be For ever pardon'd, and thy Servants all From the observance of these Rites set free: 8 Lo he will come, O God, to do thy Will, To live a life most spotless in thine Eyes, Thy Laws he will most perfectly fulfill, And then give up himself a Sacrifice. 9 Thy Righteousness and Truth, as thou can'st tell, And thy Salvation, I have publish'd forth, To all thy Saints who in thy Courts do dwell, I have not hid but magnify'd thy worth. 10 Do thou, O God, my fainting heart preserve, Against those Foes who seek my overthrow, And though I justly for my Sins deserve Thy greatest Plagues, yet, Lord, thy mercies show. 11 Confound with shame all those who lye at watch To take away my life, do thou afford Thy timely succour, and their own lives catch In those same snares, which they have set, O Lord. 12 As for the bitter scoffs th'ave thrown at me, Return them on themselves, as their reward; Let me, O God, their speedy ruine see, And when they call let not their cries be heard 13 Then shall those pious Souls who trust in thee Rejoyce, that thou art just in all thy ways, Inflam'd with love they shall contin'ally Applaud thy Mercies, and sing forth thy Praise. 14 When I am low and in great misery, Thou art my Help, my Fortress, and my Stay, To thee, O God, for succour do I fly, To my Salvation haste, make no delay. PSALM 41. 1 Blest is the Man who takes a tender care, Of those who on the Bed of Sickness lye, He need not in his Visitation fear, But to find favour, and that speedily; In all his troubles God will interpose, For his relief, and bless him from his Foes. 2 When that Diseases on his Body seize, And on the Bed of Sorow he is cast, Where others tumble, and can find no ease, Rack'd with tortures of their actions past, Then will the Lord for mercies he hath shown Soften his Bed, and strengthen him when down. 3 I humbly therefore at the Throne of Grace, Beg that the guilt of all my Sins may be For ever pardon'd, hide not, Lord, thy face, But heal my Soul as thou hast promis'd me; Though I deserve thy Wrath, yet love express, And ev'ry thought and crooked act redress. 4 My Foes a thousand ways my ruine plot, Concerning me they speak maliciously; When will he dye, say they, and be forgot, Let his name perish to Eternity; Before my Face none more obliging are, Behind my back their hatred they declare. 5 Thus underhand they secretly combine To make me odious in the Eyes of all, Invention's rack'd to compass this design, And Slaunders are contriv'd to work my fall; Defam'd they think my Name shall never rise, Under the load of all their Calumnies. 6 My own familiar Friend who always eat At my own Board, and in my Bosom lay, Whom with the great'st endearments I did treat, My most retir'd Counsels did betray; But, Lord, restore me to my Throne, and Right, That their perfidious acts I may requite. 7 By this I guess thou hast a love for me, Because I find thy watchful Providence, Hath disappointed them of Victory, And hitherto preserv'd mine Innocence; For which both I, and all with one accord Will sing Eternal Hymns to Isr'els Lord. PSALM 51. 1 Cleanse me, O Lord, from that most horrid Sin Of guiltless Blood, which Lust hath brought me in, And from the boundless Ocean of thy Love, Let not my other sins my ruine prove; To such an high degree I have transgrest, That wheresoe're I go I find no rest. 2 And though no earthly Judge can claim a right To punish my Transgressions in thy sight, I stand arraign'd, and to thy Sentence must Or stand, or fall, as to a doom most just. If to eternal Flames, I must obey, No rescue thence, though I a Scepter sway. 3 Thou better knowest O Lord my frame, than I, How I was shapen in iniquity, When in my Mothers Womb I then put on The spotted-Garment of Corruption; But this is no excuse for this foul fact, Which my unbridled Lust hath made me act. 4 Full well I know, that in the inward-part, Thou lov'st a spotless, and a sincere heart; I have suffic'ent Grace from thee to know What to forbear, and what I ought to do; Yet into wilful Sin I headlong run, Against a clear and full Conviction. 5 Purge me with Hysop and I shall be clean, Whiter than is the purest Snow from stain, Let not Uriah's blood, which to thee cries For vengeance, Lord, to my confusion rise; But be thou reconcil'd, release from pain My tortur'd Soul unto her joys again. 6 Return once more unto thy wonted Love, And from thy sight for evermore remove My weighty Sins, and by thy work of Grace Within my heart each lustful thought deface, That I may never by a wanton glance Offend again, and so my Crimes enhanse. 7 Should'st thou for ever banish me thy sight, And from my Soul withdraw thy saving Light, I were undone, but Lord afford thy Grace, And vail not from mine Eyes thy glorious Face; With thy free Sp'rit me to those Joys restore Which once I had, and let me fall no more. 8 Then shall I Sinners by thy Grace convert, And make Transgressors in thy ways expert, Then shall my Tongue, when once my Soul is freed From the pollutions of this bloody deed, Declare thy Truth, my Lips and Mouth shall be From day to day employ'd, in praising thee. 9 Did'st thou a legal Sacrifice desire, Thousands of Bulls &amp; Rams consum'd with Fire, Upon thy flaming-Altar thou should'st see These offer'd up for my Adultery; A broken and a contrite heart for Sin, Is the burnt-Off'ring thou delightest in. 10 Do good to Sion, show thy Love to all Who tread her Courts, and on thy Name do call; Then shall the smoak of Bulls which we consume, Upon thine Altar yield a sweet Perfume, And with our Pray'rs and Praises reach thy Throne; And Blessings thence upon our Heads pull down. PSALM 55. 1 Almighty God, who evermore art near With thy Relief to those who injur'd are, Give ear unto my Pray'r, hear how I mourn, Thrust from my Kingdom, and pursu'd with scorn. 2 My Son and Subjects on my ruine bent, Tax me as guilty of mis-government, They do complot my final overthrow, With all the rancour that their hearts can show. 3 At this I tremble, and the dismal thought Of my apparent danger, Lord, hath brought Such apprehensions to my troubled mind, That all the Terrours of the Grave I find. 4 O that I had but Wings, then would I flee Into some desart place, where I might be Safe from the Storms and Tempests which my Son And Subjects raise, by their Rebellion. 5 But thou, O Lord, who always dost deride The Wisdom of the Wise, do thou divide Their Consultations, make them disagree In their rebellious projects against me. 6 For I have heard from a most faithful Friend, Hushai the Archite, whom I back did send, That strite &amp; violence is their whole discourse, Their Tutelars to whom they have recourse. 7 These guard the City day and night, the round They walk about the Walls, within is found Mischief and Wrong, and all the Cruelties That Villany can act, or wit devise. 8 Had my reproach and all this misery Proceeded from an open Enemy, I could have born it, sure I had foreseen, And so prevented this I now am in. 9 But it was thou whom I esteem'd above All other men, and as my Soul did love; Thou who did'st all my secret Counsels know, And with me to the house of God did'st go. 10 For this perfidous act of his he shall Not live to perfect his designs, but fall With all his horrid Crimes down quick to Hell, Since wickedness in all his thoughts doth dwell. 11 But as for me, I'le call in my distress, Thrice ev'ry day my Pray'r I will address, Unto his Mercy-Seat, and he shall hear, And from the danger save me which I fear. 12 Though this Rebellion with great strength and art Is manag'd and contriv'd, God takes my part, Who will in peace restore me to my right, Maintain my Cause, and all my Battels fight. 13 He will afflict them, and my Feet uphold, Ev'n that God who doth abide of Old; But they despise his Rod, because they are Successful in the courses which they steer. 14 The Laws of their Allegiance they have broke, They make, and at their pleasure Oaths revoke, Words smooth as Oyl were dropt, when all along They were inventing how to do me wrong. 15 But let their base designs be what they will, Never so wicked, my concerns shall still Be cast upon the Lord, who will no doubt Restore me to my Throne, though now thrust out. 16 But the Blood-thirsty, and the Perjur'd shall In their full strength into destruction fall, As for my self I'le put my confidence In thine Almighty-Arm for my defence. PSALM 73. 1 All who are sincere shall find God most gracious, just, and kind, Ever ready to reward Those who do his Laws regard. 2 Yet my Faith was well-nigh gone, When I saw the Wicked run In forbidden Paths at will, And escap'd unpunish'd still. 3 When as those who do obey Thy Commands, and seldom stray, Thine afflictive Rod do bear, While these Wretches prosp'rous are. 4 Full of Health, and likely long Here to live, of Body strong, None of all those Plagues they know Which others feel and undergo. 5 Rapine and Oppression As a Garment they put on, In such base unlawful means They more Pride, than in just gains. 6 They in Wealth and Grandeur grow Suddenly, and know not how, And are Masters of a Mine Which they never did divine. 7 To oppress is all their talk, Those who piously do walk, They prophanely take a pride God and goodness to deride. 8 Therefore when the godly see This their horrid Blasphemy, And those evils which they do, Some their Eyes with Tears o're-flow. 9 Thus they argue, can God see And permit such Sins to be Here unpunish'd, sure his Eye Can't discern Iniquity. 10 These in worldly-wealth encrease, Flourish here, and are at peace, In an even course they run Till their Web is almost spun. 11 But each Morning when I rise, Thou, O Lord, do'st me chastise; Under pressures sore I live, While the Wicked grow and thrive. 12 Wherefore then have I in vain, Kept my hands from unjust Gain, Been in all my ways exact, As to Thought, as well as Act? 13 Such sad thoughts did me confound, But I soon mine errour found, That it was a grand Offence To distrust thy Providence. 14 Yet I was perplext in mind, That the Wicked, Lord, should find So much favour, this to me Seem'd at first a Mystery. 15 Till I with my Feet drew nigh, Lord, unto thy Sanct'ary, Then I understood thy ways, And the end of these Mens days. 16 Sure on High thou do'st them set, That their fall may be more great, In a moment they come down Headlong in destruction. 17 O, those Horrours that possess Their sad Souls, who can express! Sins like Furies on each hand In most dreadful Forms do stand. 18 Thou shalt make their Shaddow fly In the twinkling of an Eye, Riches, Pleasures, and their All Vanish, and to nothing fall. 19 Then what Folly was't in me To conceive a slight from thee; Like a Beast to show dislike VVhen thy Rod did friendly strike? 20 For thou had'st a careful Eye Over me partic'larly, Free from danger did I stand By thine All-protecting hand. 21 Thou shalt me most safely lead Through those troubles which I dread, Bringing me to great Renown, And a never-fading Crown. 22 Than thy Self I do not know Any God that can do so, Thou the God art whom I love, Other Gods I don't approve. 23 For I find thou ever art, VVhen Afflictions seize my Heart, Always to me a strong Fort, Whereunto I may resort. 24 As for those who put their trust In another, 'tis but just That they should for ever dye, For their base Apostacy. 25 But for me I will adhere, Lord, to thee while I am here, And excite Men to a Sense Of thy gracious Providence. PSALM 49. Hear all ye People; my Discourse will be A Meditation fit for each degree; I'll treat of Wisdom, that both Rich and Poor, May gather Knowledg from her immense Store. When Death and the Distempers of old Age, Knock at my Door to leave this earthly Stage, Wherefore should I repine, and show more Love To this low Mansion than that blest above; Where I shall far more lasting Treasures find, In value greater than those left behind? They who in Riches trust, and do adore, Within their Iron-Shrines, their Idol Oar, Cannot with it themselves or others save, From the close Hug of the respectless Grave. Riches were never known to have that strength To rescue Men from Death, they must at length Turn to their Mother Earth, from whence they all Had their first Birth, and back again must fall. The VVise this Fate as well as Brutish have, Death takes not one, and doth the other leave; Yet do these Wretches live as if they were Exempt in this same Doom to bear a share; They heap up Riches, but their Treasures will Fly from their own, and others Coffers fill. For dye they must, and when they dye who knows But all their Stores go to enrich their Foes; Yet their Possessions by their Names they call, And fondly think their Dwellings firmly shall Last while the World remains, their Heirs we see Have the same thoughts of their Posterity; But Death will come, where in the Grave, that hold, They all must lye, as Flocks together fold, Until the Resurrection of the Just, Who with the Lord that day in Judgment must Help to condemn them; Lord, I hope that Morn Thou wilt my Temples with a Crown adorn. As for the Honours, and the large encrease Of the Ungodly, and his short-liv'd peace, None should be troubled, for that dismal night, In which he sets, his Glories take their flight. Though while he liv'd he thought himself most blest, And said unto his Soul, ‘Soul take thy rest, ‘For I have laid me up a lasting Store ‘Of Wealth &amp; Honour, which the World adore; ‘These high will raise me on the Wings of Fame, ‘And give me here a never-dying Name. ‘But when Death comes (in that same needful day) ‘These, like deceitful Friends, will slip away: ‘Nor can they (as thou think'st) an Arch of praise, ‘Upon their Airy-Bottoms for thee raise. ‘Nothing but heav'nly Wisdom can ensure ‘Praises unto thy Name, which shall endure. ‘Wisdom, which for the future doth take care, ‘And seeks for Treasures which immortal are. ‘Man that in Honour &amp; in Wealth doth grow, ‘And understands not whence these Blessings flow, ‘Than the dumb Beasts doth no more Wisdom show. Such Fools as he shall never have a sight Of those eternal Joys of the upright. PSALM 78. Attend ye Sons of Jacob, I'le unfold To you those Parables, our Fathers told To us, that we should to our Children show What mighty deeds God did for Isr'el do. That all succeeding Ages may sing forth His noble Acts, the greatness of his Worth. This duty God did lay on Israel, And strictly charge they should their Children tell, That Generations, which were yet unborn, Might know the wondrous-Work of their return, And not his Mercies and his Judgments scorn: And like their Fathers slight his easie Yoke, Contemn this God, and other Gods invoke. The Ephramites, well Arm'd with Swords and Bows, Able to Conquer, fled before their Foes; And why, they did forsake their chiefest stay, Forgot the Wonders done the other day. How God had brought them out of Pharoah's Land, From their hard Tasks by his All-conqu'ring hand; The Sea divided, and the Waters round As Bulwarks stood, they past through on dry ground: A Cloud did Vail them as they walk'd by day, I'th' night a Firy-Pillar show'd the way. He water'd them, as Shepheards do their Flocks, Not in hew'n-Cisterns, but from unhew'n Rocks; Streams from those craggy-Pyramids did flow, And step by step did with his Isr'el go. Yet still they murmur'd as they did before, And with fresh Sins provok'd him more &amp; more; They quarrell'd God, and did his care distrust, They ask'd for Meat, not for their wants, but Lust. Can God, say they, here furnish us a Table Of Flesh and Bread? he can't, he is not able; 'Tis true he quench'd our thirst from yonder Rock, But where's the Flesh to feed his hungry Flock? When God heard this, his wrath like Fire did burn, His long-try'd Mercy did to anger turn, Because they disbeliev'd what he had done, And gave no credence to's Salvation. Though he had shown such tokens of his Love, By op'ning all the Clouds of Heav'n above, And raining Manna that they all might eat, That heav'nly-Bread he gave them for their Meat; He fill'd and fed them with the Angels Food, And as the Waters when they make a Flood Come tumbling down, so Flesh showr'd on the ground Vast heaps of Quails, did all their Camps surround. Yet though at their requests he sent this Meat, They disbelieve him still, and murm'ring eat, Then was his Anger kindled, and the Chief Of all their Tribes he slew for disbelief. Though Plagues throughout their Camps like Lightning run, Their hearts were stubborn, and they would not turn; But still they Sinn'd, and sinning did declare They'd not believe, in vain his Wonders were; Therefore their Rebel-lives he made them waste In that same place, but two escap'd at last. But when exemplar punishments did fall, They then return'd, and on their God did call; Then they acknowledg'd that they were his Flock, He was their Saviour, and their mighty Rock; Their Tongues did this declare, their Hearts the while Were as before as hollow, and as vile. But God being full of Mercy did forgive Their feign'd Repentance, willing they should live; His Justice to his Mercy did give way, Unwilling to consume them in one day: For he remember'd what they were, alas, But as a Wind which soon away doth pass. Ten times their diffidence they did express, And long'd for Egypt in the Wilderness. So sensless were they that they never thought What there they suffer'd, nor how God had brought Them forth from thence, and by their Moses hand Destroy'd the Pride and Glories of that Land. He turn'd their wholesome Rivers into Blood, Vast Swarms of Flies, and Frogs devour'd their Food. The fruitful burdens of the Earth were lost, Their Vines with Hail were kill'd, their Trees with Frost. Their Cows, their Sheep, their Asses, and their Colts, Either with Hail were slain, or Thunder-bolts. So great his Anger was, his Wrath so fierce, He did his Plagues throughout the Land disperse. But while poor Egypt was thus sore opprest, To have their first-born slain of Man and Beast, His Mercies and his care did still attend On Israel, he did their All defend. He led them through the Sea as on dry ground, In which proud Pharoah, and his Hosts were drown'd. He led them all along, and Wonders wrought, Till at the length he them to Sion brought. Then dreadful Fears upon the Heathen fell, These Tribes o'recame them, in their Tents did dwell. They had not long possest, but soon were cloy'd, They wanted something, though they all enjoy'd; And as their Fathers did Apostatize, So they to Idols offer'd Sacrifice. When God heard this, he suffer'd Ark and all His chosen Ones in Heath'nish hands to fall. So sore displeas'd, and angry was the Lord, He gave them up to the devouring Sword; Their young-Men were destroy'd, their Virgins now Liv'd single lives by force, and not by Vow. Their sacred Priests did perish by their Swords, Their Wives exprest no sorrow by their words; But Grief sate lively painted on each Face, Such consternations were in ev'ry place; That God took pity, and arose at length, Gave their enfeebled-Hearts, and Arms fresh strength, He smote with Botches in their hinder parts The Philistims, and gave them tim'rous Hearts; Their Dagon-God, they in their Temple found, Before the Ark, lye shatter'd on the ground. So what they got they durst not now defend, But richly laded back again it send. Moreover Judah of all Jacobs race God chose, and Sion for his resting place. And this conspic'ous-Hill 'bove all he blest, Decreeing here his Ark should ever rest. He lowly-David from his Sheep did take, From that Employ, he made him undertake The care of all his People, which with skill He did perform, according to his VVill. He govern'd them with Wisdom, and with Art, Walking before his God with all his heart. PSALM 90. 1 Thou who art God from all Eternity, Long 'fore this Globe of Earth was form'd by thee. Thou who hast since, blest be thy glorious Name, Upheld both us, and this same earthly Frame, Hear thou the fervent Pray'rs, the hearty-Groans, That are sent up by thine afflicted Ones. 2 When Man, thine Image which thou did'st create, Apostatiz'd from his first happy State, Unhappy we by our Fore-fathers deed, Have an entail of Death upon our Seed; Our times are in thy Hands, and 'tis but just When thou command'st, we should return to dust. 3 Should we be suffer'd, Lord, to linger here A tedious Life, as our Forefathers were, That length of time Methusalah did see, What is it, Lord, to thy immensity? A thousand years are nothing in thy sight, As yesterday, or as a Watch i'th' night. 4 Death as a Torrent sweeps us clean away, And in a moment all our Joys decay, Like as the Grass i'th' Morn, so ev'ry one Doth flourish then, but is at Noon cut down. So vain are we, and of so short a time, That all our Glories wither in their Prime, 5 Thus are we snatch'd from off this worldly-Stage, In the full strength and verdure of our Age; For thou hast set before thy searching Eyes, As well our close, as known Apostacies; In thy displeasure all our days we spend, And as a Vapour so our Lives do end. 6 Threescore and ten is the computed length Of our Terrestrial Lives, but if through strength We do attain unto the fourthscore year; Then they are interwove with Grief and Care; Like as a Dream so soon they pass away, So fading are our Joys, so short's our stay. 7 And though thy Wrath is equal to our fear, Yet we so sensess are, and void of care, That we contemn thy Rod, and think we shall Inhabit here, and never dye at all; But teach us so to number all our days, That we may hate the Follies of our ways. 8 Return, O Lord, at length; how long wilt thou Look on thy Servants with an angry Brow? O give us now thine everlasting Love, And from our harrass'd-Souls do thou remove The sentence of Excision, long have we Expected, Lord, thy promis'd-Land to see. 9 Give days of Joys so many as may last, Longer than all those years of Sorrows past, Now magnifie thy glorious work of Grace, Not only unto us, but to our Race; Thy gracious Favour and thy Mercy show, And frame our Wills, thy sacred Will to do. PSALM 91. 1 He who his whole concern entirely flings Under the Shaddow of the Almighty's Wings, Shall find a pow'rful God, a faithful Friend, A certain Refuge to his Journeys end. 2 This never-failing Axiome makes me go To him, as to a Fort in which I know No bloody-Wars, nor sweeping Pestilence, Nor wit of Man, can snatch my Life from thence. 3 For as the stately Eagle guards from wrong, Under her spreading Wings, her helpless Young; So will the God of all the Earth be sure Under his care that I shall live secure. 4 Though Deaths empoyson'd Arrows take their flight, And slaughter thousands both by day &amp; night, Not one of all these deadly Shafts shall be So rightly levell'd, as to mischief me. 5 Yet I shall see the Wicked's just reward, Vast piles of those who did not fear the Lord, But in these heaps my Carkass shall not lye, Because I did upon the Lord rely. 6 For he his holy Angels shall command, When heavy Judgments post throughout the Land, That neither I, nor those within my Wall, Shall taste those evils on the Wicked fall. 7 The Lyon and the Adder, without dread, I shall encounter, on their Necks shall tread; The rav'nous Beasts like tame ones shall submit, And yield themselves as conquer'd at my Feet. 8 Because my whole delight was to fulfill. The Laws of God, and to obey his Will, Because I did respect his glorious Name, With honour he'll exalt me for the same. 9 I shall no sooner call but he will hear, And free me from those Judgments others bear, He'll crown my Life with length of days below, And me above will his Salvation show. PSALM III. 1 I'le ever bless the Lord, and praise His Name in secret with th'upright, And in his Courts extol his ways, Those Wonders done in Isr'els sight. 2 His VVorks so great and many are, They are a Meditation fit For the most Pious, and by far Than other studies, benefit. 3 He great and glorious things hath done, His Truth for ever shall abide, He made us, and to ev'ry one Hath been a Fort, and constant guide. 4 Those worthy deeds which he hath wrought VVithin each breast, have left behind Impressions, time can never blot, The Lord is merciful, and kind. 5 VVhat-e're it is the Faithful want, They never fail of a supply, He will perform his Covenant, To all his Servants faithfully. 6 The Vertue of his VVorks were shown Unto his People, in their sight The Heathen from their Lands were thrown, And Israel enjoy'd their Right. 7 His Actions just and righteous are, All his appointments stand so fast, And that exact uprightness bear, They never alter to the last. 8 From the Egyptian-Yoke he freed, As he did vow to Abraham, The Jews his own peculiar Seed, Holy, and Rev'rend his Name. 9 Then let us all his Laws obey, And of his Judgments stand in dread, These teach us VVisdom, and the way To our eternal Joys they lead. 10 And while we here a Being have, Let's celebrate our Makers praise, Translated hence we never leave To chant above the self same Lays. PSALM 134. Had not the Lord in a most signal way, Stood up against our Foes, may Isr'el say; Had not the God of Jacob set us free, VVhen held in Fetters of Captivity, The Torrent of their Fury had o're-run Our Souls, with ruine and destruction. But now his glorious Name be ever prais'd, He to renown our abject State hath rais'd; And hath preserv'd us from their cruel Rage VVhich nothing, but his Power, could asswage. Safely at length our Souls escaped are, Though late entangled, from the Fowlers Snare; Yet not our Strength, nor Merits do we own To be the Cause of our Salvation; It was the Arm of the Almighty Lord, Who Fought, and Conquer'd, and our Joys restor'd. PSALM 125. 1 Whoso on God relyes, stands fixt &amp; sure, As Sions holy Mount, which shall endure, Upon whose sacred Top the Lord declares He will reside, and hear his Servants Pray'rs. 2 As Salem's safe from storms on ev'ry hand, Fenc'd with those lofty-Hills which round her stand, So are the Faithful, in th'Almighty's Arms Impail'd secure from all destructive harms. 3 Yet for a while Oppression may take place, And prosper here, disturbing Isr'el's peace, But the ungodly shall not long bear sway, Lest that the Righteous prove as bad as they. 4 For God is good, his care is over those Who are sincere in heart, who do repose Their confidence in him, he'l Crown their Love With all those Joys the Blessed reap above. 5 As for those Souls who basely turn aside From all his Laws, and wont his Yoke abide; Whom none of all his Judgments can forewarn, In endless-Flames they shall for ever burn. While in perpet'al peace his Israel, That Her'tage of his own, shall ever dwell. PSALM 133. Lord, 1 How glorious in thine Eyes do those appear Who follow peace, and as Religion binds, In perfect union, and communion are, Having no discords in their ways and minds. 2 Such happy concord yields a fragrant smell, Like to that precious Oyntment which was shed Upon thy High Priests Crown, and downwards fell Upon his Beard, and o're his Garments spread. 3 As the refreshing-Dew did gently fall And cherish Hermon, and bless Sions Hill, So on the peaceful Heads of such Men shall The blessings of the Lord, each Morn distill. PSALM 140. 1 Defend me, Lord, from Malice and Deceit, From all those Snares, the Proud have laid in wait To catch my Soul, my ways they have beset VVith treach'rous Gins, and Nets my Life to get; But, Lord, their VViles, without thy leave I know, Cannot effect my wish'd-for overthrow. 2 Like as a Serpent from his poys'nous Tongue, Darts forth his Venome, so they all day long From their destructive Tongues, without just ground With slaund'rous Lyes, my spotless Life do wound; But thou my Shield art, under whom I dwell Secure, or in this Conflict I had fell. 3 Yet, Lord, lest these Men should exalted be, As sure they will, if that they should go free, Let their Device take no effect at all, Wherein they thought to make me, make them fall, And rise no more, let them in Flames expire, And with thy burning VVrath, Lord, Fan the Fire. 4 This fatal Doom let it for ever be The VVicked's Portion, that the Just may see Thou wilt maintain their Cause, and from thy Throne Confound the lying and backbiteing-Tongue; Then shall the Righteous flourish in thy sight, And Laud thy Name who do'st defend their Right. The end of the Psalms. THRENODIA: OR, THE LAMENTATIONS OF Jeremiah. PARAPHRAS'D. WITH A PRAYER FOR THE CHURCH. LAMENTATIONS. CHAP. I. 1. The miserable estate of Jerusalem by reason of her Sin. 12. She complaineth of her Grief. 18. And confesseth Gods Judgment to be Righteous. 1. How doth the City, she that once was known To have her Temples circled with a Crown, Sit with a mournful Wreath of Cypress now, Like a forsaken VVidow, on her Brow? She that was once among the Nations great, And as a glorious Princess ruling sate Among the lesser Provinces, is made Unto the Foe to bow her stately Head. 2. Down her pale Cheeks the pearly drops do trill Both Day and Night, which from her Eyes distill, Amongst her Lovers she hath found not one, That doth the troubles of her Soul bemoan, And that which adds fresh Fuel to her Woes, Is, that her Friends are now become her Foes. 3. Judah, for all those Cruelties which She Hath done, is gone into Captivity, She dwells among the Heathen, where her mind Doth no repose from all her Trouble find, All her Pursuers, who did for her look Have in the narrow ways her overtook. 4. The Ways of Sion mourn, because no Guests, As they were wont, approach her solemn Feasts: All her frequented Gates forsaken are, No more Oblations in her Courts appear: Because these fail, her Rev'rend Priests do grieve, Her lovely Virgins do in Sorrow live, And She who once an undisturbed Peace And plenty had, sits now in heaviness. 5. Her Foes the only Chief are, who command Within her Gates with an imperious Hand, They prosper, happy and successful are, While She the Judgments of the Lord doth bear, For her Transgressions, are her Children gone Captives before her Foes to Babylon. 6. From Sions Daughter all the lovely Grace Departed is, that once adorn'd her Face; Her Princes are with Hunger almost pin'd, Become like Harts that can no Pasture find; Vainly they think with fainting Limbs to fly Before the Hunter, but fall down and dye. 7. Jerusalem did to remembrance call When she afflicted was and made to fall, Those pleasant and delightful things which she Lost, when she went into Captivity. Her jeering Foes upon her Sorrows play'd, And May-Games at her sacred Sabbaths made. 8. Jerusalem hath sinned grievously, And is remov'd for her Impiety. All that ador'd her, do her now despise Having beheld her lew'd Adulteries: Sighing she turns her mournful Face aside, And vents her Sorrows in a Briny Tide. 9. Fill'd with Pollution, in her wanton mind Her fearful end could no admittance find: Therefore, when least she did of Judgment dream, Down from her fancy'd Bliss she headlong came In a most fearful manner, and no Eye Let fall a Tear at her Calamity. Behold, O Lord, the troubles of my Breast, And how they are by a proud Foe encreast. 10. His impious hand hath from her Eyes remov'd Those sacred things, which she so dearly lov'd: Within her Courts the Heathen have been seen, Who were forbad by Thee to enter in. 11. Her starving People for the want of Bread Do sighing sit, not to be comforted, All their delightful things they given have For Food, to save them from the noisome Grave: Behold, O Lord, consider how I now Am held in no esteem, and made to bow. 12. Have ye no sense of my afflicted case, Ye savage Monsters, who this way do pass? Stay but a while, and tell me if your Eyes Have seen such sad amazing Miseries, As my incensed God is pleas'd to lay Upon my Soul, in this his wrathful day. 13. He from above into my Bones hath sent Consuming-Fire, as a punishment: He for my Feet an unseen Net hath spread, Amid'st those sinful Paths I us'd to tread, And backwards turn'd me; so that now I lye Wasting, and fainting in my Misery. 14. He round my Neck hath put the heavy Band, Of my Transgressions with his angry Hand: And my Herculean Strength hath weaken'd so, That I am captiv'd by a feeble Foe; Nor shall I ever able be again To burst asunder my uneasie Chain. 15. The Lord hath trampled under foot the strong And valiant Men, which did to me belong: In fury he hath sent an armed Host To slay my Youth, and spoil my fertile Coast: As in a Wine-Press, the Almighty hath Trod Judah's Daughter, in his burning Wrath. 16. No downy Sleep can on mine Eye-lids creep, For these Afflictions day and night I weep; Adown my Cheeks the briny Tears do rowl, Because the Lord, who should relieve my Soul, Is far from me; my Children des'olate are, And Pris'ners made unto the Foe in War. 17. Sion for Succour hath her Hands stretch'd out, But all in vain; the Lord hath round about Girt Jacob with his Foes; Jerusalem Is as a menstr'ous Wretch, abhorr'd by them. 18. The Lord is Righteous, and his Judgments all, For my notorious Sins, do justly fall Upon my wanton head: I all my days Have been a Rebel to his sacred ways: Hear, I beseech you, all ye passers by, Look how forsaken I in Sorrow lye: My Maids, and young Men by a conq'ring-hand Are Captives led, into another Land. 19. I call'd on those, whom I my Lovers thought, To come and help me, but they help'd me not: My Priests and Elders in the Streets fell Dead; Famish'd with Hunger for the want of Bread. 20. Behold, O Lord, the Judgments of my Sin; My Bowels work, my heart can't rest within; Sad and dejected in the midst of Woes I trembling sit, to see the slaughtring Blows Of the devouring Sword abroad; the while Within my Gates pale Famine makes a spoil. 21. My treach'rous Friends have heard how sadly I Have mourn'd, but none would to my help draw nigh: My Foes have likewise all my Trouble known, And greatly joy at what thy Hand hath done: But thou wilt bring their stablish'd day at last, And plague them sorely, who have laid me waste. 22. Then let their Sins in their full measure come Before thy Face, and let them have their Doom; A Doom as sharp as I have found from thee, Do unto them as thou hast done to me: It's time, O Lord, that thou should'st take my part, And ease the Pains of my afflicted Heart. CHAP. II. 1. Jeremiah lamenteth the Misery of Jerusalem. 20. He camplaineth thereof to God. 1. How hath the Lord forsaken his delight, And mask'd his Sion in the Shade of Night, Took from her lovely Brow the awful Crown, And hath from Heav'n to Earth her Beauties thrown, Rememb'ring not in this his wrathful day The sacred Temple, where we us'd to Pray. 2. He ruin'd hath, and utterly destroy'd Those pleasant Tents, which Jacob long enjoy'd: Thrown down the Holds of Judah's Daughter round, And raz'd, and made them level with the ground: Yea as a thing unclean hath made the Land, And all her Princes in his Eye-sight stand. 3. He in his Fury Isr'els Strength hath quell'd, And his all-sisting-Arm from him with-held Before the Foe, in his consuming Ire Hath Jacob wasted with devouring Fire. 4. To its full bent, like a revengeful Foe, His sin'wy-Arm hath drawn the fatal Bow; And slew whate're in Sions Tent was known To be with pleasure, and delight look'd on. 5. He, as a Foe, hath Isr'els Land laid waste, And all his Forts, and Palaces defac'd: In universal sorrow Judah lies, Rending the gentle Air with mournful Cries. 6. He from his Temple hath his presence took, Like an unfruitful Garden it forsook: In Rubbish laid his hallow'd House, and those Scatter'd, who there to serve in Course were chose: Hath caus'd the solemn Feasts, and Sabbaths too Of Sion to forgotten be, and go Without their due observance; and in's Wrath The sacred King and Priest, despised hath. 7. No mounting Flames upon his Altar rise; His Temple hateful is unto his Eyes: Her Walls within whose Guards we us'd to stand, Are given up into the Heathens Hand: As in a solemn Feast, their Voices are Heard in our Courts to rend the sounding Air. 8. The Lord hath purpos'd level as the ground To lay the Walls that compass Sion round: And hath stretch'd out a Line, resolved on Her utter Ruine and Subversion: Therefore the shielding-Rampart, and the Wall Together sunk, and to the ground did fall. 9. Her Brass-Ribb'd Gates, (which none could ever wound,) And Iron-Bars lye broken on the ground: Her Kings and Princes, who in Purple sate Dispencing Justice in her peaceful Gate, Are Captives now among the Heathen gone; No Law nor Justice in her Gates are known, Her Prophets find no Vision from the Lord, Nor in his House sounds forth the sacred Word. 10. In a deep silence on the dusty ground The Elders sit, with Woes encompast round; With fulsome Dust strow'd on each hoary-Head, And with repenting Sack-cloath covered: The lovely Maids of Sion, who would not Within their Breasts admit a ruffling thought, Prest down with sorrow like the Aged go, With palsi'd Limbs and Heads that downwards bow. 11. My spungy Eyes, which from their Channels ne're Fail'd to assist me with a moistning Tear, Keep back their kind asswaging Dews from me, Now I should use them in my Misery: My Bowels tremble to behold the Fall, And fatal Ruine of my People all, To hear the little Sucklings make complaint, Seeking for Food, and as they seek it faint. 12. They to their Mothers say with mournful Voice, O where's the Corn and Wine that should rejoyce Our drooping Souls? In vain for Food they cry, Fainting they sink within their Arms and Dye. 13. Tell me, forsaken Sion, tell what thing Shall I to Witness take for thee, or bring, That can with thee compare? O how shall I Think on a way to ease thy Misery? No 'tis beyond my Art thy Wound to reach, For like the Sea, so wide and deep a Breach Thy Sins have made, that to close up thy Wound, And make it whole, no Balsome can be found. 14. Thy Prophets have been busied with the Wind, Taught thee according to thy wanton Mind, They have not as they ought display'd thy Sin, To turn thee from the Bondage thou art in; But have pronounc'd instead of Truths base Lyes, Which have ensnar'd thee in these Miseries. 15. All that pass by, insulting o're thy Bands, Do hissing wag their Heads, and clap their Hands; Saying, is this the City that Men call, The joy of the whole Earth, and chief of all? 16. Thy hellish Foes, joyful to see thy day, As they walk by, do gnash their Teeth, and say, What we have look'd for long, proud Sions Doom, Is on her now in all its rigour come: Now we her Judgments have both seen and found, Sion destroy'd, and levell'd with the ground. 17. VVhat God hath purpos'd in the days of Old, And by his Prophets long ago foretold, He hath fulfill'd: unto the Earth hath thrown Thy stately Buildings without pity shown: Nay, he hath made thee to thy Foes a scorn, And over thee exalted hath their Horn. 18. They cry'd unto the Lord, O Sions Wall, How art thou ruin'd and forsook by all? Let Tears, like an o'reflowing River, rowl Down from thy weeping Eyes, and to thy Soul Give no repose, no respite to thine Eye, Let it for ever flow, and ne're be dry. 19. Arise, and cry in the first Watch o'th' Night: Pour out thine Heart like water in the sight Of the Almighty; and with Hands lift high, Implore thy Sucklings Lives, that fainting lye VVith Hunger in the top of ev'ry Street; Beg till thou can'st with his Compassion meet. 20. See and consider, Lord, on whom it is, That thou hast laid so great a Plague as this: Shall Women eat the tender fruit o'th' Womb, Their Span-long-Children? Shall thy House a Tomb Both to the Priest and Prophet now become? 21. In ev'ry Street the youthful Heads are found, With the Gray-hairs to kiss the flinty ground: Thou hast my Virgins and my Young-Men all Slain, and made pit'less by the Sword to fall. 22. As in a Solemn Day thou hast call'd out Thy Terrours, and beset me round about, So that not one in this thy wrathful Day Remain'd, or could by Flight escape away: Those that I swadled, and brought up, the Foe Hath now, O Lord, consumed to my VVoe. CHAP. III. 1. The Faithful bewail their Calamities. 31. They acknowledge God's Justice. 1 I am the Man that hath Afflictions known, By that smart Rod which he hath sent me down. 2 Into sad darkness he my Soul hath brought, And from mine Eyes the chearful Light shut out. 3 Hath me forsaken, and hath turn'd his Hand Against me, that I now do trembling stand. 4 He hath my tender Flesh, &amp; Snow-white Skin Shrivell'd; and broken all my Bones within. 5 He hath Besieg'd me, that I can't get free, Walling me round with dreadful Misery. 6 In dark and hideous places hath me put, As are the Dead, who in the Grave are shut, 7 Hath round about me made so strong a Fence, So weighty made my Chains, I can't get hence. 8 When I with a loud cry assail his Ear, He shuts my Prayer out, and will not hear. 9 He hath block'd up my ways, made me forsake The beaten Road, and unknown Paths to take. 10 Like as a rav'ning Bear, he was to me, Or as a Lyon lurking secretly. 11 He stop'd me, and in pieces did me Tear, And left me mangled and unpityed there. 12 He bent his murth'ring Bow, &amp; made me stand, Like a most certain Mark to guide his Hand. 13 He caus'd the winged-Darts from's horned-Bow, With a swift flight into my Reins to go. 14 I was a scorn to all my People, they Made me the Subject of their Mirth all day. 15 He hath me fill'd with bitter things, and me Made drunk with Wormwood, to my Misery. 16 He hath me wounded with afflictions sore, And me with Ashes covered all o're. 17 He also hath my Soul remov'd from peace, And I forget my former happiness. 18 And said my Courage, and my strength is fled, And from the Lord my hope is perished. 19 When I remember all those Sorrows I Have undergone, and under which I lye. 20 My Soul keeps them in mind, and for all this She in my Bosome truly humbled is. 21 This gives me hopes, that the Almighty will Be my Defence, and my Preserver still. 22 And this must say, that of his Mercy 'tis, That we are not consum'd, because that his 23 Compassions fail not; dayly they increase, And great's to us his Love and Faithfulness. 24 The Lord my Portion is, and therefore I Will hope in him in all my Misery. 25 Good is the Lord, and gracious to those Who seek him, and their Trust in him repose. 26 'Tis good for Man to wait the leisure time Of Gods Salvation, and to trust in him. 27 'Tis good for Man, in's Youth his Neck to fit Unto the Yoke, and to Gods Laws submit. 28 Us'd to the Yoke, he doth no murmurs vent, But bears with patience Heaven's punishment. 29 Humbles himself, and doth with hopes attend, When the Almighty will his succour lend. 30 Reproach'd by those, who do his Ruine seek, Unto their Stroaks he gives his tender Cheek. 31 Knowing that God wont him forsake, but be A just Avenger of his Injury. 32 That though he send Afflictions, yet at last They, who them suffer, shall his Mercies taste. 33 He takes no pleasure to chastise at all, Or let Afflictions on his Creatures fall. 34 To crush the Fetter'd Pris'ner of the Earth Under his Feet, to whom he did give Birth: 35 To turn aside the Right of any one, That craves admittance to the sacred Throne: 36 To overthrow the Cause, that righteous is, The Lord doth not, nor will approve of this. 37 Who is't that says a thing, and when 'tis brought To pass, dares say, that Heaven will'd it not? 38 Out from the sacred Lips of God can't come Both Good and Bad, he gives a righteous Doom. 39 Why then doth Man repine, when struck by God? Wer't not for's Sin, he'd never feel his Rod. 40 Let's search and try our ways, let's turn unto Our angry God, and see what he will do. 41 Let's, with our Hands, lift up our Hearts on high, And thus bespeak the dreadful Deity; 42 We all have sinn'd, we all have Rebels been, Therefore thou hast us plagued for our Sin. 43 With Wrath thou hast o'rewhelm'd, and clos'd us all; And made us pit'less to thy Fury fall. 44 In a thick Cloud thou hast thy self inshrin'd, That through't our Prayers should no passage find. 45 We are by all men the Off-scouring deem'd, And look'd on as unfit to be esteem'd. 46 With open Mouths our Foes their Joys express, Glad to behold us plung'd in deep distress. 47 Fear, and a Snare are come on us, and we Destroyed are with great severity. 48 Mine Eyes with Rivers of salt Tears, gush out, For the Destruction on my People brought. 49 Adown my Cheeks they glide, and will not cease Till from my troubles he doth me release: 50 Till that the Lord in mercy will look down, They'l never stop, but Day and Night will run. 51 My very Heart with grief within me's torn, To hear the Daughters of my City mourn. 52 Like as a Bird, so am I chas'd by those, Who are, without just cause, my mortal Foes. 53 Into a Dung'on dark they have me thrown, And over-whelm'd me with a Massy-Stone. 54 Billows of Sorrows o're my Head did pass, Then I concluded that I ruin'd was. 55 I call'd upon thy Name, O Lord most high, Out of the Dung'on in my Misery. 56 Unto my Voice thou hast inclin'd thine Ear, With-hold not now, and be not deaf, but hear. 57 Thou, in the day when I did call, drew'st near, Did'st answer, and command me not to fear. 58 Thou, &amp; thou only, Lord, maintain'st my Cause, And did'st my Life redeem from Bloody Paws. 59 And now, O Lord, since thou hast seen my wrong, Judg thou my Cause, it doth to thee belong. 60 Thou hast with watchful Eye their Vengeance seen, And all their thoughts, that have against me been. 61 Thou hast, O Lord, both heard their Scoffs and known All, that against me in their hearts is done. 62 Unto those Lips, who do against me rise, Thou art no Stranger, nor to their device. 63 When they uprise, or when they lye along, I am the Subject of their mirthful Song. 64 Give them, O Lord, their due, and speedy Doom, Full Cups of Vengeance, let them flowing come. 65 Let killing Sorrow sit on ev'ry Heart; Let not thy Fatal Curse from them depart. 66 Pursue; and chase them in thine anger, Lord, And from the Earth destroy them with thy Sword. CHAP. IV. 1. Sion bewaileth her pitiful estate. 13. She confesseth her Sins. 1 How is the beamy-Gold grown dim as Night? How is the pure Gold chang'd, which was most bright? How are the Temple-stones with dirty Feet Defil'd, and scatter'd into ev'ry Street? 2 The Noble Men of Sion, lik'ned to The most fine Gold, how are they look'd on now? But as the Potters handy-work of Clay; No other Honour, or esteem have they. 3 The watry-Monsters ne're deny the Breast, But give their Young the Teat, when they request: My People cruel to their Young Ones are, Like th'unnatural Ostrich, void of care. 4 With scortching thirst the tender Suckling's Tongue, Cleaves to the vaulted Roof of's Mouth: the Young And harmless Infants, that can scarcely speak, Ask of their Parents Bread, but none they break. 5 They, who did use on choicest Food to feed, Perish i'th' Streets, and none their crys do heed: They who were Rob'd with Cloath of Tyrian-Dy, Naked upon a loathsome Dunghil lye. 6 My People for their Sins more chast'ned are, Than e're the People of lew'd Sodom were: Their City soon consumed was to th'Ground, And no appearing Foe Encamp'd it round. 7 Her Nazarites, who were more purely White Than is the Fleecy Snow, and Milk to sight, More Ruddy than the Rubies ever were, And than the polish'd Saphyr, shin'd more clear; 8 So changed are, as to their Faces, now That one them cannot for their Blackness know: Close to their Iv'ry-Bones their Skin is shrunk, And wither'd like a dead Trees Sapless Trunk. 9 Those, who are killed by the Sword, are far Better, than they, who slain by Famine, are: For these, when stricken by it, lingring lye, And by degrees doe pine away, and Dye. 10 The half starv'd Mothers forced were to Eat The Fruit of their own Wombs, for want of Meat, So much distress'd, and to this dismal pass Were they reduc'd, when Sion ruin'd was. 11 The Lord his furious Indignation hath Accomplish'd, and pour'd out his burning Wrath; He such a Fire hath in Sion made, As hath in Rubbish her Foundations laid. 12 The Crowned Heads, and those of meaner Birth, That trod the globous-Surface of the Earth, Would not have thought, that ever any Foe Should have on Sion seiz'd, and brought it low. 13 For the notorious Sins of those, who were Her Priests &amp; Prophets, all these Judgments are Upon her brought, they are the Cause of all The Purple Blood, that in her Streets did fall. 14 Defil'd with Blood, which in the Streets they shed, Like Blind Men up and down they wandered, And were so foul, that Men did them detest, And durst not come to touch their sacred Vest. 15 The Rabble with a loud Stentorean cry Call'd to the Priests, and bid them thence to fly; Depart, depart, ye are unclean, said they, Therefore they fled, and roved Night and Day: The Heathen follow'd with a dreadful Yell, And said they should no more in Sion dwell. 16 The Wrath of God hath them dispersed quite, He will no more abide them in his sight: Because they neither to their Priests did give A due respect, nor did their Ag'd relieve. 17 Whil'st we expecting look'd towards the Coast Of Egypt, waiting for a succ'ring Host, Our gazing Eyes were dim and weary grown, Looking for help, from whence we could have none. 18 From Street to Street they did pursue us so, That we could no where from their Fury go: Upon our Lives is past the fatal Doom, Our Days are finish'd, and our End is come. 19 Our deadly Foes in Flight much swifter are Than is the quick Wing'd Eagle of the Air: They have pursu'd us on the Mountains, and Have waited for us in the Desart Sand. 20 The Lord's Anointed in their Nets are tan'e, In whom we hop'd, &amp; by their Hands is Slain; Of whom we said, under his Shaddow we Shall live secure, and from our Fears be free. 21 Rejoyce, O Edom's Daughter, be thou joy'd, Who did'st insult, when Sion was destroy'd: Thou shalt e're-while the Cup of Fury taste, Be sham'd, as She was, and like her laid Waste. 22 Thy Woes, O Sion, are fulfill'd, no more Shalt thou be Captive made, as heretofore: But, O thou Edom, Heaven will begin To visit thine Offence, and show thy Sin. CHAP. V. A pitiful Complaint of Sion in Prayer to God. 1 Be mindful, thou, of all our Woes, whose Throne In Heaven is: on our reproach look down. 2 The Land, thou gav'st us to Possess, is Till'd By Heathens, and our Houses with them fill'd. 3 No King we have, our Cities all are left, As mournful Widows, of their Loves bereft. 4 We can't fetch Water from the Chrystal Spring, Nor Fuel get, unless its price we bring. 5 Our Necks are with a grievous Bondage prest, Wearied we are, and can obtain no rest. 6 We have for Bread implored Egypts Aid, And a firm League with wicked Ashur made. 7 Our Fathers have transgrest, and are no more; We their Transgressions, and our own have bore. 8 Servants have rul'd, and had o're us command; None would us free from their imperious Hand. 9 We ran the hazard of our lives for Meat, Because the Sword around did for us wait. 10 Our Skin did black (as is the Oven) look, Because lank-Famine rag'd in ev'ry nook. 11 They forc'd the Wives in Sion, and in wild, And burning Lust their lovely Maids defil'd. 12 They hang'd our Princes up, and had no care To honour them, who Priests or Aged were. 13 They made the Young-Men labour at the Mill, With weighty Burdens did the Children kill. 14 No Law-dispensing-Elder now doth sit In Sions Gate, nor's Musick heard in it. 15 The Joy and Pleasure of our Heart is fled, Our Daunce we now in mournful Measures Tread. 16 The State and glory of our Realm is gone, Wo to us, for our Sins have it undone. 17 For this our Hearts are Faint, our Griefs increase, And for these things our Eyes ne're Weeping cease. 18 But chiefly for that Sion (fam'd of Old To be thy Joy) is now the Foxes hold. 19 But why, O Lord, thou sole Eternal One, Who hast an everlasting settled Throne, 20 Do'st thou so long forget, and leave us here; And to our Out-cries wilt not lend an Ear? 21 Turn thou us, Lord, and we shall turned be, And let us have the Days, we once did see: 22 But thou hast cast us off; thine angry look Shows, that thou hast thy Sion quite forsook. CONCLUSION. Thus hath my Pen through various Troubles past, Traverst the Woes of Sion, and at last Unto the end of her Complaint is come: Grant that our Sion may not find her Doom. In Thee we hope, in Thee we Trust alone, To thee we fly, save us, Thou Mighty One: This Favour from our Princes can't be had; Thou only can'st preserve, and make us glad. A Prayer for the Church. Eternal God, to whom all Knees shall bow, Unto whose goodness we our Beings owe: How have we all from thy Commandments gone, Following our vain Imagination? Hast thou not seen thy Mercies slighted, all Thy Laws and Judgments in contempt to fall? And heard how we, with impious Mouths, have said, There is no God, no God who hath us made? I cannot, Lord, but tremble, when I muse On these our fearful Sins; nor can I chuse But burst into a sad and doleful Cry; What merit we for our Impiety? We here deserve to feel thy heaviest Doom; And those eternal Flames i'th' World to come. But thou, who art an ever gracious God, To anger slow, unwilling with thy Rod To grieve the Sons of Men: who ready art Fully to pardon the returning heart, But a consuming Fire, that will burn The Soul that will not be induc'd to turn; Make us sincerely sorrowful for all Make us sincerely sorrowful for all Our crying Sins, that for thy Vengeance call. Forgive us all our secret, and our known Transgressions, which we against thee done: And grant, that we may willingly no more Provoke thy furious Wrath, as heretofore. And since our Hearts are in thy Hands, O Lord, Make them obed'ent to thy Will and Word: Send into ev'ry Breast that peaceful Dove, Thy holy, and eternal Sp'rit of Love, To rule and lead us in the way of Peace; Whose end is everlasting Happiness. That, for the future, there may not arise Amongst us, baneful Animosities. Be gracious to thy Church, and scatter all That dayly seek and Plot to make her Fall. Make them to perish in their strange device, And never rise to work her Miseries. But let thy Goodness, and thy Mercies flow Upon her Head, &amp; with her always go. And since a dismal Cloud with frowning Brow, Hovers o're thy despised Sion now; O let thy Goodness, a quick piercing-Ray Send down, and chase this direful Cloud away; That it upon her may not fall, and we For our Offences thereby Ruin'd be. But chiefly, Lord, we here do thee invoke, To save her from Romes hateful hellish Yoke. Let not that Man of Sin, wh' exalts his Throne Above the Powers that on Earth are known, Subject her to his most imperious Sway, And make her to his Avarice a Prey. Infat'ate his Designs, and on him lay The Mischiefs purpos'd to Her day by day. Cover with thy out-stretched Wings the Great And Gracious Sov'raign of our Church &amp; State: In spight of those, who rage, and cursing stand, To see the Scepter flourish in his Hand; Preserve his sacred Life, and make them all, Who seek his Ruine, by his Hand to fall. Here Crown him with a long and blessed Peace, And, when he Dyes, with endless Happiness. Bless likewise those, who at thy Altar serve; Grant that their Lips may right'ous Truths preserve: Let both their Lives and Doctrins be sincere, And let them, like the Stars, shine bright and clear. Bless all inferiour Ministers of State, Fill them with wholsome Justice in the Gate; Let well weigh'd Judgment from their Mouths proceed, And not the name of Friend or Foe to heed. Be good to all thy People ev'ry where, And keep them in thy Faith, and in thy Fear; Convert the unconverted; make us all To own one Shepheard, and to know his Call. Then we thy People, who to thee belong, From day to day will with a thankful Song Set forth thy Praise, and to the World declare How great thy Goodness and thy Mercies are. POEMS ON SEVERAL Occasions. By the same Hand. The Sinners Wish. Ah could I, Lord, at thy blest Hands, Receive a Freedom from my Bands, From killing Sins and worldly-Cares, From future Torments, dismal Fears, Were I as certain of thy Love, As Angels that enjoy't above, Beauty with her bewitching-Smiles, VVhich Fetters Millions with her Wiles, Should ne're embrace me in her Arms, I'de stand unconquer'd at her Charms; Those wealthy Treasures of the Shoar, The costly Gems, the glitt'ring Oar, These I'de contemn upon this score; That I might Heavens Treasures know, And when I dye may thither go, Say, Lord, the Word and 't shall be so. On Lazarus rais'd. Lord! The Grave obey'd, Deaths Bands did fall Asunder, at thy pow'rful Call, And all those faithless Lookers on, Beheld his Resurrection, Such charming Rhet'rick's in thy Voice, The Dead Revive, the Sad Rejoyce, And the lov'd Laz'rus did return From the close Prison of his Urn. As thou was pleas'd to raise from dust His sensless Carkass, so I trust Thou'lt call my Soul from ev'ry Lust. And from this earthly Prison free It, to a glorious Liberty. To Death. 1 Since Adam sinn'd, and by that fatal Fall, Gave thee a Sov'raign Power over all, It is decreed, we must obey thy Call. 2 To thy dark Cell when thou command'st I'le go, Since my dear Lord, hath trod that Path, I know No Terrors I shall meet in th'Shades below. 3 Pale Fear adieu, go find some other Breast For thine abode, ne're think that thou shalt rest Within my Bosom, I'le have no such Guest. 4 And since it is decreed my Body must Return from whence it had it's Birth at first, Pronounce thy Sentence, &amp; discharge thy Trust. 5 But know thy conq'ring-Dart in time will fly Into thy cruel-Heart, then thou shalt dye, But ne're with me enjoy Eternity. 6 Yet I declare thou art my real Friend, Since from this earthly Prison thou dost send My Soul, unto those Joys which have no end. The Morning Sacrifice. 1 No sooner doth the chearful Light Dispel the Horrours of the Night, But like the Lark my Soul aloft Mounts to her God, in Notes most soft Recounts to Him with great delight, All her past Mercies of the Night. 2 And since thou, dearest Lord, do'st prize A thankful Heart, since in thine Eyes It is of value ev'ry day, This grateful Tribute I will pay, And 'twere a madness since no more Thou do'st exact, to run o'th' Score. 3 For, O my Soul, what more befits Thee to return for benefits, Than what the Angels do always? Chant forth his most deserved Praise, Who ev'ry dawn doth give new Birth To all thy solid Joys on Earth. On Reprobation. 1 I cannot think my God thou didst create Some Men on purpose for no happier State Than endless Torments, which shall know no date. 2 Nor dare I own a thought that Christ did dye Only for Some, not All intention'lly, These Doctrines I abhor most perfectly. 3 That Man the noblest of thy Works should be, By thee design'd for endless Misery, To shew thy Justice, and thy Sov'raignty. 4 My Soul shall never entertain a thought Of so much horrour, of that God who sought Our Restauration, and redemption bought. 5 When all along thou promises do'st make, To all Mankind who will their Sins forsake, Thou wilt forgive, shall I thy Word not take? 6 Yes, Lord, I will; though boldly some declare, Thy known and secret Will so diff'rent are, When thou say'st live, thou ne're intend'st to spare. 7 'Tis strange they should some few dark places wrest To speak their Sense, when, Lord, thou dost protest Such thoughts were never harbour'd in thy Breast. 8 How vile's that Man whose heart doth not agree With's Tongue, good God and just! how is't that we, What Man's asham'd of, attribute to thee? 9 What in my heart I think, to All I'le tell, Such contradictions sure can never dwell, With perfect Purity, their Mansion's Hell. 10 Were I to represent to th'publick-View A Devil, Hypocrite, or Trayt'rous Jew, I would delineate them, as these do you. 11 What strange presumption do these Gnosticks show, To make as if they did thy Secrets know, Which none can tell, who doth converse below? 12 In thy most sacred Writ 'tis manifest There's none excluded, all Men may be blest, If they are willing, with eternal Rest. 13 For thou art good and gracious unto all, Long-suffering to us Sinners, and dost call All to repentance, would'st have none to fall. 14 And for this purpose Christ for all did dye, He hath affirm'd this Truth who cannot lye, To doubt of which confronts Divinity. 15 Most safe it is to rest on this belief, Most satisfactory, it eases Grief, And yields a poor desponding Soul relief. A Meditation on Mans Folly. Lord, what a foolish thing is Man, How fond is he of Toys? How doth he spend that little Span Of his, in empty Joys? But for that precious Soul of his He takes no future care, To fit it for immortal Bliss, Such thoughts too serious are. Himself to ev'ry pleasure gives, And drowns his Soul in Lust, In all destructive Sins he lives, Till levell'd with the Dust. Give me, O Lord, that pious care And that obsequious love, That all my Actions may declare, I seek that place above, Where we from Sin exempt shall be, From Sorrow, and from Tears, And where no Trouble we shall see, Nor frighted be with Fears. A Vow. I vow, Lord give me grace, no beauteous smile, No Wedg nor Honor shall my Soul beguile From strict obedience, no not all the art Of the seducing Fiend shall tempt my Heart, Though all the Glories of the World should be Amass'd together in one Treasury, And by him tender'd, yet I would not bow To his damn'd Scepter, but I'de keep my Vow. Deus mi. Bless me with peace of Conscience, And in my Soul with innocence, Love of my God, and dearest Friends, And my Ambition hath its ends. This, Lord's the All, I must confess, I dare on Earth call happiness, I limit not thy Providence To act according to my sence: Dispose of me as thou think'st fit, And make my Will to thine submit. Domine Jesu. 1 The Vertue of that Balm which did distill From thy pierc'd side, infuse into my Will, That thy good pleasure here I may fulfill. 2 Make me to Thee as to the Center move, Each thought and act refine, inflame my love To all thy ways, that I may faithful prove. 3 And since to thee, the Cross must be my guide, That joy which made thee, make me to abide Its weight, till I in Paradise reside. To a young Person that was about to Vow Celibacy. 1 Tim. Chap. 5. Ver. 14. I will therefore that the younger Women marry, bear Children, guide the House, give none occasion to the Adversary to speak reproachfully. She who her Reason lays aside, And Superstition makes her Guide, Can never hope by that false Light, To do an action that is right. In all religious Duties know, Most principally, e're we Vow, Right Reason should be sought unto. Those which endure her rigid Test, Them to embrace and leave the rest. Then must thou love that state as best, Which God in Paradise hath blest, There Marr'age took its early Date, There they began to Procreate. A single Life He did foresee Gen. 2. 18. 1. 21. Was inconvenient, Multiply The great Creator did command, And what he Wills none should withstand. Had not his Wisdom lik'd by far The marryed Life, though link'd to care, As tending to a nobler end Than Celibacy can pretend, Thy Sex had never had its Birth, Thy Being was to Man the Earth, And not to live a strict Recluse Neither to God or Man of use. Is it in thee a pious part, The great Design of Heav'n to thwart, To vow a Virgin cloister'd Life, Since thou art fit to be a Wife? No, 'tis an impious act in thee, Being young, to vow Virginity; 'Tis, though Devotion's the pretence, 'Gainst God and Nature an offence. For, whatsoe're thou thinkest, sure Destructive Vows God can't endure; And none can more destructive be Than those of Cloister'd Chastity. Should all thy Sex be of this mind, The Peopled Earth would quickly find Its self bereft of either Kind. Of Millions now, a He, or She, In one short Age there would not be. Then think not on so rash a Vow, Which aims at Ruine, quickly now Be thou a Pros'lyte to that state, For which God did thy Sex create, And be not tempted to do ill, By a misguided Zeal, or Will, To undertake what cannot be Safely resolved on by thee. Perchance thou fondly think'st that they Who married are want time to Pray, And exercise their Piety; This is a great mistake in thee, They have their times of Vacancy. 'Tis true, so long they cannot be As Sanctimon'alists on the Knee, Because attended with more care, And bus'ness than the Cloyster'd are; Yet this their care their duty is, Time so imploy'd doth lead to Bliss, And is no bar to Happiness. Reiigion's active, hates a Drone, Who buzzing spends each day alone In Pray'r and Contemplation. Both fitting duties to be done, Great Pillars of Religion, But she who wholly rests on these, Though she may fancy what she please, Spends but her days in idleness. So lives the lazy Nun, the Wife Who truly virtuous is, a Life Devouter leads than any she Who vows Recluse Virginity. No sullen humour clouds her mind, Nor superstitious Zeal doth blind Her Reason, so much to despise That state, which Heaven dignifies. Her God she honours, honours too Her Husband, as she ought to do. Hazards with an undaunted mind, Her Life to propagate her kind. Shuns not the World, nor bus'ness here, But walks in both with so much care, That neither proves her Conquerour. And though Temptations do around Beset her Soul, she keeps her ground. Sure such a courage bears away The Palm from her who shuns the fray, And out of fear to be o'recome, Within close Walls her Life doth doom. Too tedious 'twere to tell the ways, And pious actions of her days, She loves, industrious is, obeys, Each morn she brings a Sacrifice Of Pray'r and Thanks, before her Eyes Close up at Night a holy Flame Dissolves her Soul in Pray'r again. Nor doth the duty of the day, From Heaven steal her heart away; For while her hands most busied are, In managing her house affair, She breaths a short, yet grateful Pray'r. Such grapple Blessings, prove more strong Than cloyster'd Pray'rs a whole day long, They mount, and with a quicker Wing To all her Wants fresh Succours bring Than a more tedious Offering. And for the good of all Mankind, As full and quick returns do find. Thus lives the virtuous Wife, and so Thou, being young, shouldst marry too, And live, as she's describ'd to do. For, 'tis not good to live alone, Two being better much than one Eccl. 4. 9, 10. In Health, or sad Affliction. In the chaste, blessed Nuptial Twine, Woman gives much a brighter shine, More good Examples in that State Shows, than the fruitless Celibate. To God more grateful presents gives, Holy'r, and full as chastly lives (If not much more) than any She Immur'd within a Nunnery. I'le say no more—but chuse that Life, Which God approves off, be a Wife. Justice. Justice should all our Actions steer, It our embodied-Souls will rear Above the reach of anxious Fear. When Death our earthly-Frame destroys, 'Twill crown our Souls with perfect Joys, 'Twill free our Bodies from the Grave, That they a Resurrection have, And safely seat us in that Bliss Which fades not, but eternal is. The Prodigal Son. 1 While lib'ral Fortune did dispense Her Favours, in great affluence, And his beloved God, his Chest, Deny'd his Ryots no request, He like a frantick-Beast did run The Stages of Destruction. 2 But when a total emptiness Did his consumptive Bags possess, His Belly pinch'd, his Treasure gone, He then consider'd what he had done, And to his Father goes in haste, Implores forgiveness for what's past. 3 Thus want a reformation wrought, And the luxurious Youth was taught, To chuse the good, with care to shun Those Follies he so doted on. O happy change! which made him know The danger which he ran into. Thou didst hide thy Face and I was troubled. When from my sinful Soul that glorious Sun, Thy blessed Spirit, Lord, was forc'd to run, Soon did the actions of my Life betray The want of that pure Light, then did I stray In those dark Regions, where no heav'nly Ray Affords one lightsom glance to guide my way. Immortal God! in what a dismal case Was my poor Soul, when thou withdrew'st thy grace? As in a Garden the enamell'd Flow'rs, When the Sun's mask'd with sullen Clouds or Show'rs, Close up their Leaves, and sad and pensive look To miss that warmth which from his Beams they took, Till he again doth dart a liv'ning Ray, Their Beauty fades, and sweetness doth decay; So when thy Beams of Mercy thou didst quite Vail from my Soul, what an Egyptian-Night Did cover it, how did its Beauty fade And Glory wither in that dismal Shade? But when again that Sun-shine did appear, Which doth inspirit all our actions here, My Soul forthwith reviv'd, and vows to sing Perpet'al Hallelujahs to my King. On Mary Magdelene weeping. The Scene is chang'd, that lovely Grace Which sate triumphing in her Face, Which whosoe're beheld, streight found The Darts of Love his Soul to wound, Grief hath o're-cast; those wanton Eyes, Whose Glances challeng'd Victories, Shed penitent Show'rs, and that Hair, Each Curl of which did prove a Snare To fetter Youth, dishevel'd lyes, And serves for Towels to those Eyes, Which over-flow with happy Tears, Whose drops gain'd Heav'n, and calm'd her Fears. On the ten Lepers made clean. The ten were heal'd, and all but one Unthankful prov'd, for what was done, You may as well confine the Wind To constancy, as think to bind With kindness an ungrateful Mind; Yet when afflictions prest them sore, How ready were they to implore Their Saviour's help, his Cross once o're They never thought upon him more. Good God! that mercies oft should prove Destructive Rocks to Shipwrack Love! Riches and Beauty are deceitful, but a faithful Friend is the Medicine of Life. 1 That glittering Idol most adore, Within her Temple others may Pay their Devotions, I ne're more Will Idolize what will destroy; What though she wealthy Treasures plead, Gold-Chains will unto Torments lead. 2 Beauty shall ne're my Soul debase, Under that form there oft do ly A rotten Soul, though lovely Face, Full of mis-shap'd deformity, Scarce one of thousands can we find Who lovely is, in Shape, and Mind. 3 'Tis not a Fabrick rear'd on high, Nor Riches that can ease the Mind, 'Tis not a lovely Face, nor Eye, Wherein we can contentment find, 'Tis none of all these things, that can Yield solid comforts to a Man. 4 It is a faithful-hearted-Friend, Whose kindness to me knows no date, Though Poverty should be my end, Scorns to convert his Love to hate, Who when I sin will always be A Faithful Monitor to me. 5 Unto whose breast I dare commit A secret, safe as in my own, Who ne're will in angry fit Betray his Trust to any One, Nor from my Interest will be Withdrawn by Frowns or Flattery. 6 If such a Friend I chance to find, I'le Center all my Joys in this— I have a Jewel to my mind, There's not on Earth a greater Bliss, Ambition may eck on desire, Mine here shall rest, and soar no high'r. The Sensualist. All that below this heav'nly Orb doth move, For Man was made, and so ordain'd above. What reason is there that he should deny Himself the Pleasure, to content his Eye? Woman that lovely Creature here was plac'd, For his delight to gaze on, and to taste That fragrant Balm which on her Lips doth grow, For him to wanton in her Vale below. All those rich Treasures both of Sea and Land, Were they not made to bow to his Command? And whatsoever his vast mind doth crave, Was he not freely his desires to have? Then where's the Sin, or how doth he amiss, If he doth use them as his pleasure is? Sure Man, by God, above the Brutes was grac'd With Reason, and for nobler ends here plac'd, As Soveraign over all, than to allow His Reason should to's Will and Passions bow: This never could be the Creator's thought, When out of Clay this curious piece he wrought; And none but Folly will pretend to own, This he design'd in his Creation. 'Tis true, that Woman by the lib'ral hand Of Heav'n was fram'd to be at Mans command, So as to make a loyal, loving Wife, And prove a Comfort in his tedious Life, But not to gaze on with a lustful Eye, Much less unmarryed in her Arms to lye. And though the Treasures of the wealthy Shoar, And Sea are subject to Man's lordly Pow'r, Yet can't he without yielding up his sense, And proving guilty of an high offence, Claim (as a Soveraign) with a wanton Hand, At will to rifle both the Sea and Land, And make them bow unto his boundless Lust, Then own the action not to be unjust. He had not his Dominion to abuse The things created for his needful use, But was to have a most regardful Eye, Not to enslave them to his Luxury. If so there's no Man but a Fool will say, He, as his pleasure is, may them enjoy. A Prayer. 1 Great God! whose providential Care Is over all, bow down thine Ear Unto my Pray'r, permit not Thou The Devil, my invet'rate Foe, To work my final overthrow. 2 So closely on our Souls he waits, With his bewitching-tempting-Baits, That straight our Sensual parts we please, Embrace a short and transient ease, And hazard all than Flesh displease. 3 With-hold not then thy saving-Grace From me, my God, one Minutes space, Lest this my brittle House of Clay, With my immortal Soul, a Prey Becomes to him the damn'd obey. 4 O let thy Love procure for me An easier Fate, than Misery, 'Tis just in thee, my God, I know, Since unto Satan's Lure I bow, Not to exalt, but cast me low. 5 Low as that Pit of Horrours, where The Damned Howl, and tortur'd are, Where 'midst those Flames which them torment, Which ever Blaze, but ne're are spent, They day and night their Curses vent. 6 Although my Sins these Flames deserve, Yet from their lasting Heats preserve My trembling Soul, this I implore; Except the same thing o're and o're, I know not what to ask Thee more. God's Goodness and Man's Folly. When trembling Dust with awful fear Unto thy Throne of Grace draws near, And in an humble posture brings To Thee his Catalogue of Sins; No sooner he imparts his Grief, But thou afford'st thy quick Relief, And with forgiveness ready art To ease the Sorrows of his Heart. Yet rather than we will forgo Some short-liv'd-Pleasures, endless Wo We fondly Court, and slight that Love Which will at length our Ruine prove. Whereas would we obey thy Will, Not suffering ours to have their fill; If we thy Laws would not refuse, Nor Favours willingly abuse, We should enjoy that happiness, The glorious Saints in Heav'n possess. An Admonition. 1 Soul let thy Contemplation be On Heaven and Eternity, To fix thy thoughts on this base Earth, Becomes not Thee of heav'nly Birth. 2 Since all these worldly-Glories quite, Will (like thy empty Dreams i'th' Night) Vanish e're thy bright Morn doth break, Why should'st thou pleasure in them take. 3 When the last dreadful Trump shall all (With its shril Voice) to Judgment call, Those who their God this World did make, Must not of heav'nly Joys partake. 4 The Crown of Glory only shall, As a Reward to Virtue fall, It never shall the Temples bind Of those, who earthly things did mind. The Penitent. 1 I who that precious time which thou hast lent, Have, dearest God! in sinful courses spent; I, who have chose to feed on Husks with Swine, Rather than live under thy Rules Divine; I, thy ungracious Son, unto thee, home With bleeding heart &amp; weeping Eyes do come, Asham'd that I so miserably have Mispent those Favours, which thy bounty gave. 2 And yet what reason have I to presume, That e're thy Lips will pass a gentle Doom On my rebellious Life, since it hath been wholly devoted to the ways of Sin? No, I in Justice cannot think thou'lt own, Such an ungrateful Wretch to be thy Son, Whose wanton Ear would never yield to hear, The wholsome counsels of a Parent dear. 3 But, O my Father! by that pow'rful word, Look on thy humbled Creature, and afford Some glimps of Comfort to my troubled mind; And as thou stil'st thy self to be a kind And gracious Father, be thou so to me, Forgiving him who truly turns to Thee. Look not upon me with a rig'rous Eye Of Justice, but of Mercy, lest I dye. A Prayer before the Sacrament. Thou, God, who always tak'st delight to be Conferring good on those who trust in Thee; Who from thy Bosome (by eternal Doom) Did'st send thy Son (from whence all Joys do come) To take our nature on him, and to dy Th'accursed death for our Impiety, Let me adore Thee for this mighty Love; For this, my Soul, do thou obedient prove. And grant, dear Lord, that I, who humbly now Approach thine Altar, to remember how, And what Christ suffer'd, may of Thee obtain Those dear-bought Mercies, which his Death did gain. I must confess, when I consider, Lord, How I have sinn'd against thy sacred Word, How oft I have refus'd to come and eat, When I was summon'd to this heav'nly Treat, I have not left within my troubled Breast, A glimm'ring hope to be a welcome Guest. Yet should I still absent, should I forbear T'approach thy Table, where such offers are, How can I ever hope, dear Christ, to be Partaker of thy Love and Victory? No I must never think thou'lt own me, when Thou sits in Judgment on the Sons of Men. Therefore to thee, my God, I come, and bring My Soul and Body, for an Offering. Vouchsafe that at thy Hands they may a kind And gracious entertainment this day find: And be enabled by thy Grace to move In the delightful Steps of holy Love. Let not my Sins of Youth, or riper Years, Engage thee to forsake me, to my Tears Have some regard, and let me now partake Of thy Sons Mercies, for his merits sake. Amen, and Amen. A Farewell to the World. Thou glorious Nothing, now adieu, I'le be no more a Slave to you: Hence forward all my time will I To a more serious Court apply. Heaven and all its Joys above Shall be the Object of my Love, And study of my Life each day, Till I my borrow'd Earth repay. And thou immortal God, who art The rightful Sov'raign of my Heart, Dispose my Thoughts and Actions now, Strictly to keep this sacred Vow. Thou know'st what mighty Foes they are, I must engage with in this War: The World, on one hand, will be sure To bring its Glories to allure; And its Temptations will combine To shake this firm Resolve of mine. My Flesh will all its vigour show, To make me to its Dictates bow. And the industr'ous-wily-Fiend, Against me all his Pow'rs will bend. Forces too great to be withstood, By a Compound of Flesh and Blood. Needs must I Faint, and be subdu'd, Unless with heav'nly force indu'd. Yet I am fully bent to try Their Strength, and Fight them till I dye, And do not doubt but at my Death, To have the never-fading-Wreath. SOLI DEO GLORIA. FINIS.</field>
