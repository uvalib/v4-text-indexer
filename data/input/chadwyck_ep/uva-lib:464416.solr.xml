      <field name="fulltext">HOSANNA, OR DIVINE POEMS ON THE PASSION OF CHRIST. VPON THE DAY OF OVR SAVIOVRS NATIVITY. This day's a riddle for the God that made This day, this day from his owne Creature had His making too; his flesh, and bone, and lim And breath from her, that had her breath from him. Th' unbribed Judge of Mans eternall doome This day was Pris'ner in a Virgins wombe: And the Lord Paramount of all the Earth Was wanting a poore Tenement at his birth, Into the Inne this meane guest must not come. Strange, he that fills all roomes should have no roome. The Sunne dropt from his spheare, and did decline His unshorne head to the Earth; his radiant shine Peep'd from the windores of the East, to breath New life on People in the shades of Death. Deare Sunne since from thy sphere thou once wert sent, Here is a Soule, make it thy firmament. Borne of a Virgin. Although the eye of Faith, not reason can Behold a Virgin Mother of a Man, Yet Natralists affirme some things may breed And have their propagation without seed. As that rich crop of Pease which Story sayes Made Orford famous in our Gransires dayes. Th' admir'd Phœnix which admits no paire In her persumed ashes leaves an heire. And this Maiola dares to justifie To be no fable, but true history. By seminall commixtion, I had bin Distain'd, and soiled with originall sin, Pure must the Pipe, pure must the Conduit bee That must convey water of life to mee. Our Sunne of righteousnesse when he would shine Vpon the world, choose Virgo for his signe. Borne in Augustus time. Now was the man of men great Iulius slaine, And with his blood had dy'd the chaire in graine Hee sate in, in the Senate: and the flood Which stream'd from civill warre dri'd in his blood; And now the milde Augustus sate above The Sphere of Rome like a propitious love. And with a milder influence clear'd the skies, And purg'd these exhalations which did rise From so much blood effused: or was sent Like some Apollo to Romes firmament; For in his sunnie dayes was learnings spring, All the Arts flourish'd, and each Muse did sing. The fulnesse of all time, who will not think't? When Peace and Learning were so fairly link't? When Wisdome had its flourish on the earth, Then had the Wisdome of the Father birth. And when the Olive branch of Peace was showne Then, not before, the Prince of Peace came downe! Borne in Winter. Phlegmatick Winter on a bed of Snow Lay spitting full of rhewme; the Sunne was now Inn'd at the Goat; the melancholique Earth Had her wombe bound, and hopelesse of the birth Of one poore flowre, the fields, wood, meads, and all Fear'd in this snowie sheet a funerall, Nor only senselesse Plants were in decay Man, who's a Plant revers'd, was worse then they. He had a spirituall Winter, and bereft Not of his leaves, but juyce; nay, nothing left His passive power to live was so abated He was not to be rais'd, but new created. When all things else were perished, and when No flowers were, but in their causes, then This wondrous Flower it selfe to act did bring, And Winter was the Flowre of Iesses spring. Borne in the Night. The heav'ns was now but mask'd, and now forbids His eyelike starres to looke out of their lids, For it had been a shame unto the night If but one starre had miss'd so great a sight. Or else it was muffled in silent shade, And dress'd in sullen blacks, and was afraid To let one starre gaze out, for had it seene This sight, it had for ever blinded been. There was a double night, a night of sinne, Darke Heav'n design'd the darknesse we were in, The darknesse, which through heav'n with silence roules Was the sad Emblem of our darkned soules. Now when the Sun, which daily rounds the skies Was gone to bed, this other Sunne did rise; For haply 'twas not fit there should appeare Two Suns at once, in the same Hemisphere. The Angels tell it to the Shepheards. There is a point of happinesse a time set Wherein felicity either must be met Or miss'd for ever; and that certaine now Is, when w'are at our Callings; from the Plow Rome painfull Quintus her Dictator makes. While Matthew gathers toule, and custome takes Hee's call'd to write a Gospell. At their Net The sonnes of Zebedee their conversions met. And while these men stand Centinells and keep Strict ward, and watch about their charge their sheep, They from themselves are rapt with sacred Hymnes; And ravish'd with a noise of Cherubimes, That sung this infants lullabie. The storie Hath some proportion with the Auditorie, They Shepherds were, to them the tydings came, And the first Gospel of the Holy Lambe. Of the Starres that appeared to the wise men. Astrologie hath this rule; Heav'ns seldome shine With idle fires; like Prophets they devine Stupendious events; That spark'ling beame That did so long in Cassiopia streame, And shot upon the world an angery glance, Shew'd in its lookes the Massacree of France. This Starre whose comming Balaam had profest, (From some wise men, thinke these wise men were guest) Not fram'd by Natures fingers, but the hand That framed Nature did not move and stand A non significant, but it selfe a wonder, Shew'd that a greater miracle lay under. How was th' eternall Sonne obscured here A Stable was his Heav'n, a Crib his sphere, Never had Sun such an Eclips as this, To want a Starre to shew men where it is. Of the wise men. Let them not boast, that they first saw this Starre, A brawnie brainlesse Clowne might goe as farre, The Starre in Cassiopea as I find Ticho confesse, was shew'd him by a Hinde. Wise though they were, they'd gone they knew not whether Had this Starre then been sent to lead them thither. So that the Starre which did before them goe Both shew'd them light, and shew'd their blindnesse too. But why a Starre? when God doth meane to woe us, He useth meanes that are familiar to us. Peter a fisher was, and with a draught Of many fishes was the fisher caught: These men were vers'd in Starres and well could read them Therefore a Starre is chosen out to lead them. How are men drawne to heaven the way they please, A fish tooke Peter, and a Starre takes these. Of the Innocents. Harke what is that I heare? O tis the sound Of Rachel! cause her children can'nt be found. Herod that Fox: so is his title good He slayes the tender Lambs, and sucks their blood. Strange tempered hearts whose edges would not yeeld Suppled with all the teares that day were spild; Hearts of the Rock which like to Diamonds must Be cut, or ne're be cut, with their owne dust. There a child giving death a lovely looke Smiles on his executioner; there another Asleep is slaine; Sleep chang'd to death his brother. Dennis who sweats to put on ranke and file Heav'ns Spirits by nine orders; doth beguile Himselfe and me; his memorie was too blame This order of the Innocents not to name. Of St. Stephen. Some names are ominous, wherein wise fate Writes in fare Characters mens future state; Hippolitus who scorn'd incestuous sports Was torne with horses, as his name imports. Stephen was a Crowne, which shew'd in time to come He should put on the Crown of Martyrdome. A Crowne enchas'd with stones, nay such a one Earth cannot boast, 'twas all of precious stone; The storme of stones which at this Martyr flew Recoild, inriched with an Orient hue. The meanest flint which at this Saint was throwne, Reflects a Rubie, or some richer stone. The stones advanced to a heap, become As first our Martyrs Crowne, so now his tombe. Muse, make a Pagan wonder: thus set down, Here lyes a man intombed in his crowne. Of our Saviours Circumcision, or New-yeares day. The seventh day from his birth, he did begin Obedience to the Law and pawnd his skin, He would fulfill it; when Ziskas houre was come He should expire, he bad them make a Drum Of's skin, conceited it would scare the foe 'Twas strange antipothie, if it would doe so. But this small peece of skin was such a spell It scar'd the sootie Regiments of Hell. It made the infernall Legions retreit And did indeed what Zisca but conceit. The drops this day effused, were but laid For his Good-Frydayes earnest, when he paid For our Redemption blood in full summes, Now it but drops, then in a tempest comes, The circumcision of this infant did Christen our New-yeares day: that blood was shed Did make a double Birth-day to appeare, One of our happinesse, one of the yeare. Vpon Our Saviours Passion. They put a Crowne of Thornes upon his head. The Earth and Wood, which did the Earth compact Had the same curse assign'd for the same fact. Adam did fall from the state he was in, The Earth and World beare thornes for Adams sin. When Isaack once, as mankind now, was laid A Sacrifice; a sheepe the ransome paid. See here that Sheepe caught in a Thorne, whose blood Stood then for Isaack, now for mankind stood. Hee as a Prince a Crowne like Princes weares, And Thornes are th' Emblemes of a Princes cares: The Church a Lilly amongst Thornes doth grow, And as the Churches head himselfe doth so. When Romes Dictators did a Conquest bring From some sackt Towne, or from some petty King Triumphing Palme, and Temples crowning Bayes Circling their browes shot from their head like rayes. Here Hell was captive, Death in Triumph borne. And yet the Victors head but crown'd with Thorne: Peace; 'twas no thorne, his blood had dide the twigs And chang'd them to a wreath of Corrall sprigs, Or stain'd the buds, so that their rosie blush Out-vied the English or the Province bush. They gave him Vineger and Gall, Mat. 27. And Wine mingled with Mvrrh, Mark 15. When one was on the cursed tree to die, They gave Narcotick drinke to stupifie And dull the motion of the active sense So to allay the racking violence Of his sharpe tortures, and the Rabbins say That these compounded potions were they Give Wine to men ready to quit their breath, Vineger is his preparative to Death; Hee must have nought but Vineger who hath Trod in the Wine-presse of his Fathers wrath. Those lips that once like honey combs distill'd Are now with gall in stead of honey fill'd. And he's presented with a draught of gall, Whose innocence before had none at all. One of the Wise-men that to Bethlem went To doe him homage, did him Myrh present. So they did here, but in a different case 'Twas there in honour, here in his disgrace. They compell'd Simon of Syrene to beare his Crosse. He could not beare his crosse, his crosse must try To beare the burthen of his Majesty, A burthen which the Legendaries write Made Christopher to stoope, maugre his might, Which maz'd him, till 'twas whisper'd in his eare He had borne him, that all the world did beare. His Yoke is easie; yet on him they lay A heavie crosse to carry; who dares say That this was just? yet thus we men requite Him, who professed that his burthen's light, But this 'twas made it heavie, there came in His Fathers wrath to boot, and the worlds sin. Poore Simon then comming out of the field Where haply he had plow'd, not us'd a Shield; Receives the crosse for's armes; no Herauld can Produce me such another Gentleman. So he walkes on to Golgotha, where hee Commends his Saviour to the fatall Tree Where Death and Life were wond in mutuall strife, It was his tree of death, our tree of life. Crucified. Those hands, which Heav'n like to a curten spred, Are spred upon the Crosse: those hands which did Consolidate the metals in the ground, One of those metals gave those hands the wound: See his hands spred, as if he meant to grace His Executioners with his last embrace, Nay, all the world: for if his fist can hold The winds, his armes can all the world enfold. See there Longinus with his ruder speare Peirce his Diviner side, from whence appeare Water and blood, whose white and red present Th' admitting and confirming Sacrament. See here his feet nail'd to the Crosse, which done Those feet with streames of purple did so runne, That in one sense it might be understood Our Saviours feet were swift to shed blood: His hands and feet thus forced to obey The cruell nailes command; may we not say The Starre that out of Iacob shin'd so farre Was then, or never made a fixed Starre? Crucified between two Theeves. What, reckon'd amongst rogues? mixt with the rabble Disvalu'd like the jewell in the fable Cast in the count 'mongst theeves? what coine is he In Jury stamp'd, yet there not currant be? They should not for inscription sake refuse Iesus of Nazareth King of the Iewes; A Peece so rich, no Angell that could make it So good, the Devill was content to take it. When mans arreareages for sinne were paid, And the whole ransome of the world defraid Those Moralists who anciently did dreame Vertue was not a meane, but an extreame, If they had seene him placed thus, would sweare Vertue was in the midst, for he was there, And by his presence made it plaine to try How Vertue look'd set by her contrary. And yet his glory had not an addition Of lustre lent it by this opposition; To set him off, he stood in need of none No foile was needfull for so rich a Stone. The Earth did quake. Rest is the property her creator gave her, But now a Palsey makes her veins to quaver: How cam't to passe, that windcholique strove In the Earths bowels, and did make her move. Shee once was built so firmely on her base Shee need not feare a shouldering from her place, 'Tis true; but was't not time to stirre, when hee That fastned her, was fastned to a tree. When he was in his lowest declination, Then dust and ashes had their exaltation. And the Earth rous'd her selfe, as if shee meant To be no more the lowest element. Or since his deaths-men did so bouldly dare, Shee taught them by example how to feare. The Earth did put on man, and trembling shooke, Man put on earth, and no amazement tooke; Sure this will aggravate those mens offence The Earth show'd reason, and the men no sense. The Sunne was in a totall Eclips, and not as naturally it should have been in the Sign with the Moon. Two Suns were seene, when Charles the Great deceast, Whose mighty wings ore-shaded all the West. But when this mightier King of Kings did die Not one appear'd to beautifie the skie: For when Great Charles did undergo his doome One Sunne seem'd added to supply his roome. But when the God of Natures selfe was gone Into a Passion, there was use for none. Nay, when the Sphere of light was puffed out How could the Sunne poore Taper looke about? Horrid Eclipse; for now the Moone by right Was not in the Sunes signe, but opposite; And the same way our sinnes eclips'd that Sun Upon the Crosse, by opposition. Miraculous Eclipse, how could the small And lesse circumference of the Moone hide all The larger Sunne, but that our darker sin To aide the Moone, did bring her forces in. The Graves opened, and many of the Saints arose. There was no Trumpet here to raise the dead, And call them from their graves, nor was there need, Though no Arch-Angell with a Trumpet cried, Yet now the Angell of the Covenant died. And dying cri'd with a loud voice; and those Mistooke it for the Trumpet, and arose. They rose, as if it had been their intents To give him choise of all their Monuments. And seeing that he must interment have, Each Saint did seeme to cry, pray take my grave. When he bow'd downe his head, the dead rais'd theirs And lookt out of their frighted Sepulchres. The soules shot out of heav'n in to the dead, And did a second time their bodies wed. And though they had not left their blessed thrones To reassume their ancient flesh and bones: Yet his last gaspe had been enough to have hurl'd Soules into all the bodies of the world. Buried in a Garden. After his spirituall death, first Adam's cast Out of the Garden, where he had been plac'd. After his Corporall, second Adam's put Into a Garden, and there closely shut. The first had not gone out but for his sin, And but for ours, the second not come in. Hee's in a Garden laid, not as one dead, But as a living Plant set in a bed: Set in the Spring, and without aid of showres Sprung in the spring-time, like to other flowres To which he gave the beauty that they have, And that's the reason, that the spring's so brave, Nay, wholesome as 'tis brave; for in that place Sprung up (if ever) that rich herbe of grace. Our Herbalists have writ that Serpents feare The vertue of that herbe, nor dare come neare Her soveraigne powre; I care not though they misse I'm sure th' old Serpent dares not come neere this. Buried in a new Tombe hewen out of a Rock. When Emperours were crown'd, Tomb-makers brought Severall stones, and what the Emperour thought Best in his choise, that stone was laid aside To be the Emperours Tomb-stone when he died. This Emperour was crown'd but choose no stone, Ioseph supplies that want, and chooseth one, And such a one, as might be censur'd fit For him that was to be inclos'd in it. That wondrous stone, which Daniel saith was cut Out of the Rock, that stone it selfe was put Into a stone, which lately had forsaken The rockie Quarrie, whence it had been taken. That for his Epitaph it might be read, Here in a stone, a stone lies buried. 'Twas a new Tombe, and was it not most fit For that pure body which was put in it? How like his Tombe and maiden Mother is, Man never lay with her, nor man in this. He that was taken from a Virgin Wombe Where should he lye but in a Virgin Tombe. The Mount of Olives. Hee's humble; and that humblenesse will show By th' Emblem; Nature plants the Olive low. But as presaging that from hence should bee The starting of a great ascention, shee Set these upon a Hill, as if shee meant They should have theirs, where he had his ascent, He's a King, and his Majesty will show By th' Emblem; Oyle annoints the royall brow Not liquors, unguents, nor rich Palmes we try, But Oyle; for Oyle denoteth Soveraignty. Blended with other liquors it will move In an ambition till it flowes above. In the compounding of a Majesty, A chiefe ingredient is humility. The heightned spirits would be too elate If humblenesse should not attemper state. In him like friended Elements they doe Commix; he was a Lambe, yet Lion too. Whit-Sunday: There was a noise from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind. When sad Elijah did by Horeb lye, A roaring wind so buffeted the skie As if the musterd vapours had combind To make one storme; God was not in the wind. But when th' Apostles by consent were met, After their parture from Mount Olivet A bellowing tempest vollied from the Sphere, And filled all the roome; and God was there. The spirit and the wind may seeme to bee Imploy'd in consort for their simpathie. When th' universe was made, and darknesse strove For place, the spirit did on the waters move; When the drown'd world was to be made agen The wind did move upon the waters then. Now when th' eternall Spirit was to blow And breath on them, he sent a wind, as though The uncreated Spirit had assign'd Th' other created spirit of the wind To usher him the way as he should come, Or be his Harbinger to take his roome. There appeared unto them Tongues. When Babel first rear'd her ambitious crest Upon the Plaine of Shinar, to contest With heav'n; a different language did beguile The Founders hopes, and stay the rising Pile, So when the Church was to be edified, The builders language was diversified; But difference of tongues had different power, It rais'd the Church and ruined the Tower. Th' Apostles were Ambassadors assign'd By the King of Heav'n to go to all Mankind; And 'twas both reason, and their Kings intent That they should know the tongues before they went. Yet they had none, but as the haste requir'd Their language was infused, not acquir'd. Unletter'd soules, poore Fisher-men that spoke Hardly more tongues, then the mute fish they tooke. He who's the Fathers word, a promise gave That he should send, and they a present have. This mission did the miracle afford, He sent the Tongues, who was himselfe the Word. Tongues of fire, and sate upon each of them. When fire like the Postilian was past Elijah; a soft language came at last. But here was no precedencie in either, The fire and language did come both together, For he who Father of all language is, Was in the Apostles fire, but not in his. That fierie apparition which did flame In Moses bush, and not enfire the same, Helpt not his tongues defect, nor did him store With any dialects unknowne before. Here it did both, here the divided blaze Refin'd their stile, and varied their phrase. The Prophet had not power to forbeare Because it was fire in his bones; 'twas here Fire in their tongues; they needs must silence breake Tongues tipt with fire, how can they choose but speak? The Prophets tongue once with a coale had bin Toucht at the Altar by a Cherubin; But here it were superfluous to require Coales for these tongues, these tongues themselves were fire, These tongues the Spirit would not represent In the drie, cold, or the moist Element, That temper were too languishing and weake, So powerfull an Embassie to speake. They must be fire, whose doctrine must be hurl'd Swift as the wings of lightning through the world, And worke th' effects of lightning; will not hit A heart of flesh, but gently passe by it. But grindes these hearts to dust, whose hardnesse dare Provoke a Nether Mill-stone to compare, And like the lightnings uncontrouled stroake Slides by a Reed, but ruinates an Oake; Like fire they were to separate the gold From the admixture of th' impurer mould, To take the masse of the whole rationall creature To fine, and quintessentiate their nature, And with the Alchimie of heavenly fire, Make the extracted spirits to aspire, Which with repeated heates they so refin'd That they drew out th' Elixar of Mankind. Steele-temper'd consciences, and hearts conflate Of sturdiest metals, as unmov'd as fate Were by the working of the fire made fit, Cœlestiall formes, and notions to admit. Their Sermons were not only heard but felt And made a leaden Auditory melt. Which being so dissolved they imprest Divine Ideas in the softned brest. Those parted blazes fix'd on them did shine Like prettie Commets, whence one might divine Some alteration; and there was; for then There was the change of soules, and change of men. Or else like Starres these little flames did slide With which th' Apostles were all stellified, And turn'd to the twelve Signs, through which the Sun Of Righteousnesse should as his Zodiack run, Or from the Phantasme which did then appeare, There was some order instituted there. The badge was fiery tongues, and they may bost Themselves of th' Order of the Holy Ghost. FINIS.</field>

AND William Cheyne Esquire the late Husband to That Vertuous and Mournefull Lady Lucie, Youngest Daughter of Sir Thomas Barington Knight and Baronet. THRENODES Consecrated To the pretious Memory OF The Lady Marsham. TO The Honourable Lady; Joanna, Lady Barington, the Relict of noble Sir Francis Barington, K?. and B??. 1 So have I seene the gray-eyed morning breake Into the beauty of a glorious Day, In whose faire Sunshine, Turtles bill and beake, And Shepherds sing, while their brisk Lambs do play When, at the length, a swarthy Cloud does fright The smiling Sunbeames hence, and cloathes our day with night. 2 So have I seene the dewy-brested Spring Suckling her blossomes, till the rising Fires Ripen her non-ag'd fruits, and Autumne bring Her downe-ripe dainties to the vast desires; When, at the length, a winter storme does chide And strike the wanton yeare: and cancels all her pride: 3 That Lampe, whose lustre glorifyed our Spheare, Whose radiant Beames did lately shine so bright, And made our Day the glory of the yeare, Is now obscured, and hath lost her light; Our Sunne is set, and all our pleasure lyes Ship-wreckt in shades of night, and drownd in flowing eyes: 4 That blessed Spring, whose sweetnesse, late, did suite And fringe the earth, embroydring all her Bowers With fruitfull pleasures, and with pleasing fruit, Is blasted now, nor bearing fruite, nor flowers; And black-mouth'd Boreas blasts have reveld here, And darkned all our Joyes, and deaded all our yeare! 5 Shee, whom the lavish Trump of fullmouth'd fame Could not belye, nor pens hyperbolize, Or make her more, than her own worth may clame, Or raise her merits up to higher skyes; Shee, shee is dead; whilst her surviving glory Finds mortall Quills too flat for her immortall story. 6 Had shee beene nothing but a Branch, that sprung From famous Broadoke, it had serv'd to fill Th' insatiate vastnesse of an Heraults tongue, And given full matter to an Essex Quill; Griefe neede no other Subject; This, alone, This, this had beene enough; She was a Barington. 7 A Branch of him, to whom his Country owes A life, at least; whose freedome, wealth and Blood, His zeale conceiv'd too little, to depose For Albions honour, and great Britaines good; Whose noble dust, and meritorious name Are treasur'd; That, in dust; This, in the Rolles of Fame. 8 To whose rich favours, in more speciall Bands, I stood oblig'd, a stranger to the earth, Who snatch'd me from the curse of Natures Hands, And was my Father, in my second birth; Witnesse that sacred Ewer, whereto he came With Blessings in his mouth, and stampt me with his Name. 9 But stay! Th' exuberance of my Pen commits A zealous Sacriledge against his glory; Which, cantling out his honour thus by bits, Gives him a Stanza, that deserves a Story; Excuse my red-hot zeale, which too too bold, Glaunces where it should strike; I cannot, cannot hold. 10 And thou sweet Saint, thou now sitst crownd &amp; drest With Him, in Robes of white Eternity, Pardon my sausy Quill, that hath digrest, And, for a Minit, lay'd thy Legend by: Excuse my zeale; who ever yet did see A Branch of dainty fruite, and not applaud the Tree? 11 She was no Branch of Sycamore, to please The Sun-burnt soule but with an empty shade; No fruitlesse Ash, whose unprolifique Keyes Obscurely flourish for a while, and fade: She was a clustred Branch of a rich Vine; Vnprest, delicious fruite; and prest, delicious Wine. 12 Her body was an Arke, where all supplyes Were fully made; where no perfection wanted: Her soule was a celestiall Paradise, Where all the seeds of sacred worth were planted: The Tree of Knowledge did so flourish here, That Serpents sued in vaine; No Serpent found an eare. 13 Heav'n was the object where she fixt her eye, And lov'd the Earth, but as of earth bereiven; The practise of her life was how to dye; Her Stage was earth, but yet her Sceane was Heaven: She had no Earth about her, but the shrine Wherein her Soule was Sainted: She was all divine. 14 But hold, my Pen! what mean'st thou thus to paint Perfection out? What needes thy idle Glosse Thus raise the Spirits of our dull complaynt, And magnifye the vastnesse of a losse? Is Flesh and Blood not prone enough t'encurre, The danger of Extreames, unquickned with a Spurre? 15 The Ocean-ploughing Merchant, having lost In stormy Seas, that wealth he could not hold, Findes but poore comfort, to recount and boast, How rich that Diamond was; how fine that Gold; But, in his secret thoughts, he does bewaile His Merchandize in grosse; He grieves not by Retayle. 16 Nor shall the Accent of our story touch Upon the severall Items of her worth; The Spring-tides of our flesh would flow too much If we should blazon every vertue forth; May this suffice; Our Universall Mother Will hardly ope her wombe, to let in such another: 17 Where let her honor'd Ashes rest, and make Short shaddowes, now deliver'd from the noyse Of sighes and groanes; Let her faire Soule partake With blessed Angels in Angelike Joyes; That when that great, uncertaine Trump shall sound, They may, in glory meet; with perfect glory, Crown'd. 18 Where, now, that widdow'd Soule, divorc'd from earth, Rapt up and mounted on Seraphicke wings, Fill'd with new pleasures of celestiall mirth, Defyes death-conquer'd Death; tryumphs &amp; sings; Sings and tryumphs in Joyes; which to unfold, Some Angell lend a tongue; or else remaine untold. FINIS. Threnodes On William Cheyne Esquire. TO My Honorable Friend Sir Thomas Barington of Hatfield Broadoke in the County of Essex Knight and Baronet. 1 Who ever saw when as the gloomy sky Hath drencht the Pilgrim with the hasty drops Of a malitious Cloud, how by and by, The wind-affrighted Welkin cleares, and stops Her watry flux; and with a noone-bright eye, Salutes the Earth, and gilds the mountaine tops, Where in the nimble progresse of an howre, The new clear'd Firmament begins to lowre, And drownes the reeking Pilgrim in a second shower. 2 Even so the burthen of our Childbed sorrow, Newly deliver'd of her infant teare, Finding some glimring twilight of a morrow, After a night of sadnesse, to appeare, Our griefe-bedabbled Muse began to borrow Some Joy, which Faith had whisper'd in her eare, But, loe! a new, unlook'd-for Birth constraines Another Misery, which entertaines Our wounded Soules afresh, and doubles all our paynes. 3 No sooner were the blessed Obsequies Of this rare Saint solemniz'd in our teares; (Whose rare Example (if this Age be wise) Will read brave Lectures to succeeding yeares) But, see! new sorrowes fill our empty eyes, And craves the freedome of your gentle eares; Sorrowes too strong for silent lips to smother In private sighs: How like a fruitfull Mother Griefe multiplies by griefe! One griefe brings forth another! 4 Ah! gentle Reader, how my palefac'd Quill Begins to faulter! How my twittring brest, Even moap'd with sadnesse, waxes cold and chill, Swoll'n bigge with language not to be exprest! The Flowre of Youth—Ah me! How it does drill My sorrow-wounded Soule to say the rest! The Flowre of Youth is dead: O, such a Flower As Phœbus lov'd; whereon his influous power So breath'd, that he became a Plant in Daphne's bower. 5 Within the Current of whose gentle vaine There ran a Spring-tide of Heroicke Blood, Untainted with the Epidemicke stayne; Whose down-weight Honor scorn'd to be allow'd The Heraults deare-bought Favour as a Graine To make the weight of his knowne Gentry good: But our sad Pencill, lists not to bewray The Gests of his faire Lineage, or display The auncient Honour of his Ensigne: Heraults may: 6 Nor doe we boast th' Allyance that he joyn'd With Noble Barington; from whose faire Tree He pluck'd a Siens, of so rare a kinde, That Phæbus Easterne eye did seldome see A Graft so hopefull; and, by Heaven, design'd To greater happinesse: But these things be The goods of Fortune, and may serve to Crown The Pageant of our Lives: We boast alone What we (in spight of Death) may justly stile his owne. 7 Nature (still emulous with her selfe) did vye With her best Workes, and striving to exceed, Charm'd all her starres, whose sweet benignity Joyn'd in one faire Aspect, whilst all agreed To make a Systeme of Philosophy, Abridg'd in one, for every eye to read: His structure was harmonious, built, and blest With Natures best endowments, trim'd and drest Fit for so faire a Soule, fit for so faire a guest; 8 A Soule, that had Divinity enough To light him from the vanity of earth, Which taught him how to prize that easy puffe Of ayery Joyes, and transitory Mirth: Which please a while, then languish with a snuffe, Which promise Day, but perish in the birth: A Soule, whose blessed motion was above The reach of Earth, and ever taught to move Betwixt the Poles of Peace, in the great Orbe of Love. 9 The Sparkles of his growing Youth began To glimmer in the blossome of his dayes; Which, ere his tender greennesse could write Man Brake forth in flames; (ah me! 'twas but a blaze) Alas! He liv'd not halfe his little span; Yet had he Intrest in the learned Bayes, As well deserv'd an Intrest, even as theirs That boast themselves the honorable Peeres Of great Apolloes Realme; who Crownes by worth, not yeares. 10 Nor was his Youth an Advocate, to pleade Or qualifie the guilt of ugly Crimes: He was more prone to judge than intercede And blanch the smooth delinquence of the Times; He did not stroake, but strike the Syrens head, And scorn'd the Musicke of her Magicke Rhimes: His Virgin-soule had fixt her safe desire On nobler joyes; and, being ravisht higher, Mounted on sacred Wings of more Heroicke fier. 11 But ah! what bootes it to be wise, or good? Endu'd with parts, full marrow'd, plump &amp; young? Of high Alyance, of Heroicke Blood? Potent in Purse; of Constitution, strong? Autumnes ripe fruite, and Aprils tender Bud, Roses, and Cankers sing the selfe-same song; All cry Mortality: the selfe same State Betides to all: All, all subscribe to Fate, And bide the selfe same Change, and beare the selfe same Date. 12 Else had our Cheyne conquer'd, in his strife Twixt Death, and Nature, and had won the field: Then had the fatall Dames too earely knife Strucke but in vaine; His worth had bin his shield, And Clotho'es hand had twisted up a life Too strong (if Death had made assault) to yeeld: But death, respects nor parts, nor strength, nor blood Nor Kinne, nor Youth, nor wealth, nor bad, nor good: Death must have Timber too, as well as Underwood. 13 But why? why name we Death, what meane we so To wash his milkewhite Memory in a Teare? He hath but done, what we have yet to doe (Alas) we know not when, we know not where, We whine for shells, and let the Kirnell goe: His better part tryumphs; yet we forbeare To sing an Iö, and like mortals turne Our sensuall eyes upon his senseless Urne, And where we should congratulate, ev'n there we mourne. 14 Had he beene straitned in his passage hence; Had want of Sea-room brought the rocks too neare And threatned Shipwracke, 'thad beene no offence To have giv'n his Vessell waftage with a teare: But having quit the shore; conveigh'd from thence With a full Tide; and being landed there Where all the glory of his Treasure lyes Possest by Him; O Reader, wipe thine eyes; He merits not thy Teares; keepe Teares for him that dyes.
