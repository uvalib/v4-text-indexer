      <field name="fulltext">TO THE TRVE TOVCH OF WITTE, IN THE SPIRIT of the best vnderstanding in a Gentlewoman (worthie of much honour) Mistris Anne Breton, of Little Catthorpe in Leicestershire, Nicho. Breton wisheth all eternall happines. OLD MAD-CAPS new Gally-mawfrey. 1. Mad-caps I will not. My wretched thoughts, ye wretched thoughts of mine, How shall my soule your secret essence see, That thus with passions makes my hart to pine, With sorrowes force, too forcible for me! But let me tell ye, whatsoe're ye be, I will haue helpe for all mine Agony, And tread vpon ye in your Tyranny. I will not care for Beauties clearest light, But shut mine eyes at such an idle looke, Nor Midas treasure shall bewitch my sight: I will not be with Gold, for God mistooke. This worlds best wisdome is a wicked booke, Whose greatest blisse shal neuer come aboord me, Nor will I care, for what it can affoord me. Youth, I will hold a posting kind of time, Age, when it comes, a care that will not tary, Honor, too high for quiet hearts to clime, Loue, but a bond of them that liue to marry, Power but a charge for conscience to carry, Time, but a course that neuer can be stayd, And Death, a Bug-beare to make fooles afrayd. What can I wish for may be worth my wishing, But I were (almost) better be without it? What can I fish for may be worth my fishing, When I haue lost both hooke and line about it? If ought auayle I greatly doubt it: What should I worke for, when in fine I know, My selfe and all, vnto the graue must goe? No, no, my thoughts, content your selues awhile; I know too well the tricks of all your trust: Ye shall no more my beaten brayne beguile, With seeking Diamonds in the Sea-coale dust. The Canker take the treasure that will rust. I haue no mind to any of your toyes, That, in Trueths iudgements, are mistaken ioyes. I will not learne to tell a shamefull lye, Because the Deuill is their damned Sire. I will not vse my tongue to blasphemy, For feare my soule doe find it in hell fire: I will no place of wicked pride aspire, For feare when I am at the height of all, A slipping foote doe breed a break-neck fall. I will not weare a Nose-gay in my hat, A picktooth in my mouth, flowres in mine eare, Nor hunt the Otter, nor the water-Rat, Nor haue an Ape sit nitting of my heare, Nor runne betwixt the Beareward and the Beare, The Bull-dogge, Ban-dogge, nor the Puppits play: None of these thoughts shall throw my wittes away. Nor will I learne to cogge and foyst a Dye, Nor pull all day at a Primero Card: Nor see a Cocke, to strike his spurre awry. From all these thoughts I am by reason bar'd. To follow play, I find the time too hard. No, let me sit alone and keepe my stake, While winners laugh, and losers hearts do ake. I take no pleasure in your sweete perfumes. The open ayre is healthfull vnto Nature, Which liueth long, while stuffed sence consumes Both mind and body into many a creature: Nor doe I loue a forced colour'd feature, But playne and pure milke-white and Cherry-red: These are the colours that are best in bed. I loue no leere, nor winke, nor wily looke, But straight fore-right, a penny in my face: I loue to read in no vngodly booke, For feare instruction breed me but disgrace: I loue to plead in no vnhonest case: No, no, the world such wickednesse doth breede, I know not (almost) what to loue indeede. What doe I care to see a Swasher swagger, With frounst Mustachios, and a staring eye? Alas the day, I neuer saw a bragger, But hardly scapes the Begger e're he dye, If that the Hang-man put not out his eye. No, no, I loue the ciuill kinde of iesture, Right on and plaine, both in my looke and vesture. What care I at a Countrey Wake to see A Fidler fumble on a wicked note? Or in a play, what can it pleasure mee, To see king Pippin in a paynted coate, Or heare a fellow tell a tale by roate, Or see a boy to play a wenches part? I cannot laugh at such an idle Arte. What if I chaunce to see a wench so paynted, That not a Plastrer in the towne can mend it? And if perhaps, her tutch withall be taynted, Let them that be her secret friends, defend it: I neither will defend it, nor offend it: No, let her goe along with her disgrace, I loue not her that weares not her owne face. And if I see a Miser munching Chuffe Furd with a forest round about his face, Clinging his clunsh-fist in a Calueskin cuffe, And lace his Ierkin with a letherne lace, Within a Church, to take a Chauncels place; Let him goe sleep out all the Sermon while, What doe I care for such a Iohn a stile? And if I see a crue of cunning knaues, Laying of plots to coozen single wittes, Let them alone, and come not neere the slaues, They wil be met with one day for their fits, When that the Hangman by the halter sits. Let them not touch my pocket, nor my purse, And, let them hang, I neuer wish them worse. What if I meet with Mistris Fiddle-strings, That maketh twenty faces in a day: I will not meddle with her Aperne strings: My date is out for plucking flowres in May, Such idle humours I must throw away, And say vnto my selfe, but what I see, Such prick me dainties are to proud for me. And if I meet a finicall fine youth, That weares his best clothes on a worky day, And makes a legge with yea forsooth, in truth, And learnes to lispe and looke the tother way, And knowes not well vpon what ground to stay: Alas poore fellow let the foole alone: What should I care for eyther Iohn or Ione? And if I meet a Mistris wide-mouth'd Malkes, And see her slauer like a filthy slut, And marke her when with Iohn a Nods she walkes Into the wood, to learne to crack a Nut, I will not teach a Sparrow to keepe Cut. Let them goe tumble till their bones be weary: Why should I trouble them vvhen they are merry? Away with all vnprofitable humours, Your huffe and snuffe, and swagger, sweare and swill, The fruites whereof are but vngracious rumours, That hatefull wit condemnes of heedlesse will, Which hunteth after nothing else but ill. Fye, fye vpon them all, I care not for them, And blest are they, that in their hearts abhorre them. What, shall a blessed beautious virgins face Beget a wicked humour in mine eye? Shall Reason so much runne into disgrace, As so to yeelde to Natures villany? If she be faire, must I be foule thereby? No, no, my thoughts, I'le quickly turne the case, I'le haue as fayre a soule, as she a face. Come not to me with an odde coyned Iest, Or prittle prattle of a puddings skinne: For Iests are stale, and Iesters at the best, Vnto the beggars are too neere a kinne, And idle prates I haue no pleasure in: Tell me of somewhat that may doe me good, And neuer hide your heads within my hood. Speake you of Newes? tis oddes they be not true; And if they be, pray God they be not ill: But good or ill, if that they be too newe, I pray you in your silence keepe them still. For too much speach doth prooue to little skill: But for all newes, vntil the truth be knowne, Rather heare twenty, then report of one. Is there a wench within your idle walke? Well, let her walke, I will not heare of her: I doe not like of such ill humour'd talke: I can your silence to such talke preferre: And my Conceit to better cares referre. Mine eyes grow dimme, eares deafe, and sences dull, I care not for a sheepe without her wooll. Tell not me of a horse, nor of a hound, The Iades will kicke, and Dogs wil fizzle all: Nor tell me of a song, nor of a ground, I haue no humour to bee musicall; Nor tell me of a vaine Poeticall: Verses are growne so common &amp; so course, They bring but small reuennue to the purse. Tell me not of a coate of cloth of gold, Or silke and siluer, pearle and precious stone, Tis ten to one the fashion will not hold, Besides, a Prince should by such robes be knowne: And though the world to a mad passe be growne, I will content me with good home-made cloth, That hath no harme, but onely by the moth. Tell not me of a dainty dish of meate, When poyson may be stolne into the broth, Nor in my Napry how to be too neate, I can content me with cleane lynnen cloth, And take my drinke, and blow away the froth, Looke in my purse to answere my expence, And make a vertue of experience. Tell not me of a pleasant cup of Wine, And Suger to it: what is that to me? That drinking smack shal touch no tongue of mine. Wine, Beere or Ale, I care not which it be: I loue the dyet that fits my degree: If it wil wet, and coole and quench my thirst, I care not who be last, so I be first. It may be, yee will thinke I loue a pie Of spice and plummes, but truly tis not so, My diet stands not vpon Spicerie. To Beefe and Mutton can good stomacks go. Hunger is the best sauce that I do knowe. Tis good for yong fine wiues that be a lust, To long for plummes, and pies, and pasticrust. A Tit-mouce rosted, and a Sparrowe stewde, Is meate for such as eate for fashion sake. And Beere or Ale, of running water brewde, Is good for them that feare the belly-ake. And crustie bread, or a hard Bisket cake, These are trimme victuals for some stomacks feeding, But such fine diet is not for my breeding. Tell me not of a fine and daynty booke, A Spanish slipper, or an Irish spurre: Giue me a shooe that well may fit my foot, I care not for a buskin made of furre, Tis good for those that euer feare the murre: Giue me a shooe or boote to keepe me dry, I care for no fantasticke foolery. Tell not me of a new-found peece of stuffe, That scarce will last a minute of an houre, Nor of a strange conceited Muffe nor Ruffe, That may beseeme a Swashers Paramoure. I do not care to sit in Venus boure. Cost is but lost that is so ill bestowd, And had I wist, is but a foole beshrowd. Bid mee not keepe my money in my purse, And pay no debts, let beggers lye and starue: I doe not meane to get my selfe a curse, With scraping for that may the present serue: I will not so from honest reason swarue: Let carelesse mindes their conscience forget, I thinke it is a hell to be in debt. Yet will I neuer count of coyne but drosse, And wish it but for necessary vse, To answere fortune in a froward crosse, And to auoyd the cunning of excuse, When lacke of faith might fall into abuse: For in respect of Loue, I care not for it: And as for Auarice, I doe abhorre it. 2. Mad-caps Oh the merrie time. Oh where is now that goodly golden time, When gold was counted but a needfull drosse, And Reason sought but by desert to clime, While few or none that feared gayne or losse, When patience bare the brunt of euery crosse, And no man lou'd his neighbour to an end, But once and euer, say and hold a friend: When one might haue a hundred egges a groate, And for three halfepence, halfe a strike of Rye, And for a shilling make himselfe a coate, To keepe him warme, &amp; many a Winter dry: And for a farthing, a good pudding pie, A good olde drawing Iade for halfe a crowne, And forty pence the best Cow in a towne: When youth would serue for meat &amp; drinke and cloth, And weare their best clothes but on Holydayes: And in a yeere you should not heare an othe: When Tut and stoole-ball were the Summer playes, And buffets made no sword and buckler frayes. No puntos nor stoccados were not knowne, When Iohn had nought to doe but with his Ione. When fine maid Marian in a Moris daunce, Could bride it like a millers ambling Mare, And euery blew-cote by his Cognisance, Made all the Countrey know whose cloth hee ware: And euery Farmer kept good houshold fare, And not a rich man would a begger rate, But he would giue him almes at his gate: VVhen pride did teach no Princocks to goe gay, Nor Pricke me daintie, picke her fingers ends, Nor lust could take the virgines loue away, Nor heedelesse wits were carelesse of their friends, Nor blessed spirits fear'd accursed fiends. But honest wits so neere to wisedome came, That nothing almost could be out of frame: VVhen Mistris Fubs that Fiddle faddle fusse, No colours knew to mend her coorse complexion, Nor Prancking Parnel like an idle pusse, Could gull a Nimph with an imperfection, But euerie Schole-boy knowes his Interiection, And had by heart a better part of speech, Then make a full point only in a Breech: When swearing Swapskin could not swash it so, But euerie Mule could point him for an Asse, Nor munching Miser could so closely goe, But men could note him for an Owliglasse, And make him hatefull wheresoe're he was. And not a whore, but is so woe begone her, That all the Countrie would crie out vpon her: When faith and truth was found in yea and nay, And words of wisedome had their worthy weight, When Sunne-shine beames did make the blessed day, And euerie stalke did beare her flower full streight, And such as saw them, ioy'd to see their height, And euerie Bird was bush't within the spring, When all were husht, when Philomen did sing: When all the day, the Connies kept their burrowes, And not a Lambe was troubled with a worme: The fearefull Hare was squat amid the furrowes, Till feare or hunger made her leaue her forme, And season'd Shepheards neuer fear'd a storme: And youth and beauty liu'd like Turtle Doues, VVhen age would not be angry at their loues: When Nymphs and Muses sweetly kept the woods, And olde Hob-goblin kept within the caues: The Farmer sought not for his neighbours goods. But Sam and Simkin were the merry slaues, That danced Trenchmoore on their graundsirs graues: And Su and Sib would trip it on the toe, As if they knew not on what ground to goe: When curds and creame were such a dainty dish, As made the Louers licke their lips for ioy: And youth as mery as their hearts could wish, When Cupid was so kinde a hearted boy, As neuer wrought a blessed thought annoy, But gracious Spirits were so well agreed, That truth was faire on euery face to reed: When Ale, and Beere was once olde English wine, And Beefe, and Mutton was good Countrie cheere, And bread and cheese would make the Miller dine: When that an honest neighbour might come neere, And welcome: Hoh maide, fill a pot of Beere, And drinke it soundly in a woodden dish, When wagges were merrie as their harts could wish: When not a Pedler walk't without his packe, And not a Tinker, but did sound his panne, And euerie Trades-man, by What do you lacke: And euery Tapster, by his woodden canne: And by his dealing euerie honest man: And euerie wife, was by her husband knowne, And then it was a blessed world alone. When Susan Sowre-face, that would sit and powt, For all the parish, was a pointing stocke: And Lazy Lobkin, like an idle lowte, Was made no better then a washing blocke: While the good husbands, that maintaynde the stock, And laide vp closely for a raynie day, Were they, that kindly bare the bell away: When no man kept a dogge but for an vse, The Mastise chiefly, for to hunt a hogge, The Hound to hunt the Hare out of her mewse, And for a piece, a fetching water-dogge, Or for to beate a Foule out of a bogge. A Horse to beare as easie as a cradle, And not to kicke, nor fling out of the saddle: When maidens wink't to see a Hen a tredding, And carefull Widdowes caried honest mindes, And Brides would blush to heare but of their bedding, And humours would not alter with the windes, But loue was it, that faith for euer bindes. And pitch, and pay, and take, and trie, and trust: When hearts were hatefull that were found vniust: The word of connicatching vvas not heard, The practise vvas so seld or ne're in vse, And vertues grace, vvas chiefly in regard, When iustice gaue redresse for all abuse, VVhile care of conscience suffered no excuse. But iudgement cut off vvicked vvilfulnesse, Or mercy vvrought repentance happinesse: Then honest husbands had the merrie liues, That saw their children well brought vp at schoole, And ioy in heart to see their honest wiues, Seldome or neuer, from their spinning stoole, When none was idle, but was held a foole. And he, nor she, could iustly be offended, When all amisse could quickly be amended: When vsurers were counted but as Iewes, And Parasites did goe in painted coates, And whores and drabs were kept but in the stewes, And Cuckowes might be sounded by their notes: While Farmers mixt no Rie among their Otes, But euerie Eare could shew what corne was sowne, And euerie wife was by her husband knowne: When Huswiues lou'd to talke of home-made cloth, The fine euen threed, and of the kindly whiting, And how to kill the canker and the Moth, And of my childrens reading and their writing, And of mine Vncles eldest sonnes inditing, As well in prose, as pleasing Countrie-rime, And chat, and worke, for feare of losing time: When men would meet on Sundayes at the Church, With true deuotion, not for fashion sake: When cunning wit would giue no foole the lurch, But in each cause, a kinde of conscience make, And with indifferent hand both giue and take: While all things were so common among friends, That good beginnings made as blessed ends: When maidens sate and neately milkt their Cowes, And Lambs and Rabbits skipped vp and downe: And little children marched with their bowghes In a May morning to a market towne: And Batchelers gaue wenches a greene gowne: And smouching yonkers gaue the gyrle a kisse, When all was wel, where nothing was amisse: When Cake and Pudding was no simple feast, And dealt about in bittes like holy bread, And ripe yong Rooks were taken in the neast, While Ruth and Rachel did the Rye loafe knead: When Kit would smile to see cocke Sparrowes tread, And Pipe and Taber made as merry glee, As at a May-pole one would wish to see: When Bride-cups with their dainty gay Bride-laces, The Bachelers with such a grace would carry, And maidens follow with such mincing faces, As would allure a man halfe madde to marry: And not a wagge nor wench without Rosemary, A Nose-gay, Napkin, and a paire of Gloues, These were the orders of the ancient loues: When the olde folkes went mannerly before, And the young people kindely followed after, The parents held the bason at the dore, T'one for my sonne, the other for my daughter: When all the Churchyard might be ful of laughter, And seruice done, the youth on euery side, Would runne to meet the Bridegroome with the Bride. When going home, in order as they went, The Fidlers played before them all the way: And not a maide that had her aperne rent, Her face cleane washt, and had not a cleane stay, Her shooes well blackt, was held a slut that day. When plummes and pies would fill the belly full, And nappy ale made many an addle skull: When many a Lad would lift the leaden heele, And daunce vntill he swet, and dropt againe, And winde his wench about him like an Eele, And tosse and turne her like a lustie swaine, While harmeles hearts were in a merrie vaine: And then a posset, and a spiced cup, And so good-night, to make the matter vp: When sheepes-eies winking first began the wooing, And hearts and hands did set on faith and troth, And then the matter was not long a dooing, When it was needelesse to deuise an oth, And for apparrell, good plaine home-made cloth. Shee in her haire, and he in that he had, Thus was the Lasse contented with the Lad. He had his fathers harrowe, and his plowe, A yong gray Fillie, and a curtold Mare, Shee had her Mothers blessing and a Cow, A milke-paile, and some woodden dayrie-ware, A stitch of Bacon for good houshold fare. He had a Cottage and a faire backe-side: And so did liue the Bridegrome and his Bride: When scarce they had beene maried fifteene houres, But he would to his worke, she to her wheele, And then looke what's my neighbours, what is ours, And carde, and spinne, and wind vpon the reele, And mixe the Iron kindly with the steele, And keepe some corne to fill the emptie sacke, For feare the begger catch them by the backe: Worke all the weeke for a good Sundayes dinner, And then as merrie as the day was long, When they might well afford their drinke the thinner. If that the meate did make the porridge strong, And all was right, where nothing did go wrong. But Sim and Sib so louingly agreed, That then it was a louing world indeed. When hunger was the sauce for euerie meate, VVhile early rising did good stomacks make, And labour was the bath to make men sweate, One with a forke, another with a rake: When Tom would worke a vie for Susans sake. And he that sung and whistled at the cart, With hay, and ho, did beare the merrie heart: VVhen Gammore Widginne would not lose a Lamb; And Goodwife Goose would see her Chickens fed, And Mother Midwife kindly where she came, With merry chat would bring the wise a bed, And take the childe and softly close the head: Then take the babe and bring it to the mother, God make you strong, to vvorke for such an other: When good olde tales vvere in the Chamber tolde, And not a man that might anewst come neere: But euery one, as vvell the young as olde, Might be content vvith all their hearts to heare, And Ale and Nutmegs made the merry cheere: Then take the babe, and to the father bring it, And he must kisse it, vvhile the nurse doth sing it. And then, good Lord, hovv like the father tis, Novv God Almighty blesse it, pretty soule: And euery gossip giues the child a kisse, When hearty vvelcome fils the Wassell-bowle, And tongues vvell tipt, fell merrily to trovvle. And if (by chance) the little Infant smilde, Then kisse, and crye, God blesse my pretty child: When at a Buriall, bring him to his Graue With a few Flowers strewde on his Winding sheete: And, make no more adoe, but let him haue One knot tyde at his head, one at his feete, And, cry a little when our kinred meete: But in a while, the Carkas would be rotten, And, by that time, the Man would be forgotten. When was no speach of Diamond spirit sparkes, That mount vp higher, then a man can see: Nor, in a Candell rosting legges of Larkes: Nor, painting faces with a new found blee, When honest hartes were from ill humours free: And Wood, and Earth, would as good liquor holde As purest Plate of Siluer, Pearle, or Golde. Oh when a man, might stand amid his groundes, And see his Cattle feeding round about him: And keepe him selfe so close within his boundes, That if he heard an idle fellow floute him, It pleas'd his soule, to thinke to liue without him: And yet withall, in charitie to pray, Vnthriftie wittes would take a better way. When honest mindes would neuer beat their braines To fetch out wordes a mile aboue the Moone: Nor frame their Wittes to loose a worlde of paines, To make a morning of an after noone: Nor wayte too long, nor yet to wish too soone: But worke their Willes and Wittes togither so, As met the winde where euer it could blow. Strange Wordes were Riddles vnto simple eares, New Fashions, Follies vnto Wisedomes eyes: And faythfull hartes, were voyde of idle feares, While true Plaine meaning sought no Pollicies: For till the Poets Figures did deuise To make men studie till their braines were mad, Trueth was much more in estimation had. Oh when mens Hartes lay bare vpon their Brestes, While Wordes and Deedes were all one in effect: And wicked Humours were not turn'de to Iestes, When Honor had to simple Trueth respect, And Wisedome would vngratious thoughtes reiect, And Loue was loue for Loue, and not for Gaine, Then was the Worlde in a true Golden vaine. Then was not borne that wicked Machauile, Whose Rules haue metaphormos'de many a minde. Nor Trueth would stande to study out a stile That were too high for honest wittes to finde. Nor Cunning trickes, the Carefull eye would blinde: But when the toung did speak, the hart would prooue Trueth was the substaunce of the speech of Looue. Then was (in deede) that true Nobilitie, That had respect to nothing but it selfe: When no infection in Gentilitie Could gull the minde with greedines of pelfe: Nor suffer Cupid play the peeuish elfe, Nor Venus pride, to match with Vulcans Croome, Nor wicked Midas steppe in Mars his roome. Then, was the Sheepe knowen easely by his brand, Cow by her lowe; and by his barke the Dogge: The neighbour iustly measur'de out his land, And helpt to pull his Horse out of the bogge: No Titles tride about a Timber-logge, But rather loose it, then to goe to Law, To spende a Sheafe of Corne about a Straw. And then was Law the onely rule of Loue, Where many hartes agreed all in one: And carefull Conscience did in Concord proue The blessed life of such an vnion: When Grace with Pride could not be ouergon, But humble, milde, and modest smiling eyes, Made the Worlde seeme a kinde of Paradise. But some will say, All those good dayes are past: Well, let them goe; as good may come againe: Time goes apace: but runne hee nere so fast, He may be ouertaken in the plaine. Such as haue Golde, are in the golden vaine, While that the poore must champe vpon the bit, And Fooles must fret, because they haue no wit. Hee that hath Money, may do many thinges, Yet all, as good as nothing, in the ende. And he that wantes, knowes what the spirit wringes, That goes to heau'ne, to seeke to finde a friende, While all in vaine, doth hee his spirit spende, That thinkes on Earth is any daintie hony, But that which Arte distilleth out of mony. 3 MAD-CAPS Out vpon Money. Oh Money, Money, tis a Monarch such, As makes men know not what th? selues may bee: It makes the churle his neighbors good to grutch And felles the Plant before it be a Tree. And makes the Miller through a Mil-stone see More cunning, towling in a Strike of Rie, Then can be found out by the Farmers eie. It makes a Wench as tawnie as a Moore, To seeme as faire, as shee were red and whighte. It makes a Rich man make him selfe as poore As hee that were not scarcely worth a Mighte: It makes a Cowarde quarrell with a Knight: Yea, and sometime, to giue him such a blow, As all his strength doth wholly ouerthrow. It makes a Rascall in his rogish pride, To thrust his Nose at random in the winde: And bringes a Groome a wooing to a Bride, That scarce would wish to let him looke behinde, Nor take a Trencher, till her Dogge had dinde: And yet that Subiect of all thoughts disgrace, Shall put a handsome Stripling out of place. Why? Money puts a Foole into some Wit, And makes a Wise man wary of his will: And puts on Roast-meate on the Beggers Spit: And makes a Bungler learne a better skill, Then take a Trade, and liue by losses still. Why, Money such a power in Mallice beares, As sets a Worlde togither by the eares. But, what of this? Be Money what it can, Tis but a kinde of purified drosse: The ouerthrow of many an honest Man, That hath not patience to endure a Crosse, While one mans gaine, doth breed an others losse: And therefore let them loue it that haue store, I would but haue to vse it, and no more. Is there no God, but Golde? nor good, but gaine? All Siluer Sainctes; that must high worship haue? Is there no Grace, but in the Golden vaine? Where, either be a King, or be a Slaue? No, tis for Fooles, which Fortune so to shaue: Tis Vertue onely bringes the truest wealth, Though Money may do well, to maintaine health. What reason is there Beautie should haue blame, Forgetting Money out of Follies handes? Or why should Money haue so ill a name, To lappe a Spend-thrift in vnthriftie bandes? Why, Money is a Monarch ouer landes, And must be sued too, when a Man doth lacke, Or els perhaps be put into a Sacke. Alas poore Money, how hee is misus'de: And yet I see not who can be without him: I neuer came yet where hee was refus'de, But Cappe and Curtsey, all that came about him: And hee that wantes him, all the world wil flout him: And though some haply finde him idle talke, Yet if hee haue no Money, hee must walke. Yet be it fit for neuer so good vses, Heede must be taken in the getting of it: For, against Law, there can be no excuses, When Iustice doth in sacred Iudgement sit, And knowes what is for all offences fit: And therefore better tis for to abhorre it, Then come before a Iudge to answeare for it. No, let no minde that meanes to liue at rest, Goe further for his good, then Law will guide him: But, in the meane, to thinke that musique best, That doth not let too high straines ouer-stride him, Least true Musitians happen to deride him: Vpon ynough, it is ynough to looke, And what is more, is quite beside the booke. Profite doth well, but Honestie is better: But, both doth well, and parted much amisse: Each sence is not according to the letter, The trueth in deede in the construction is, Where Wit may finde, that Will not walke amisse, In the true iudgement of Discretions eyes, A man may be both wealthy, kinde, and wise. But, since it is so hard a thing to doo, To gather Wealth with perfect Honestie: It is so strange a thing to come vntoo, With men of onely Worldes capacitie: Let me but labour for Necessitie, Feede, cloathe, and keepe the Begger from the dore, Pay that I owe, and I desire no more. For, let the Greedy-minde gape after Pelfe, Hee may be choaked when his throat is full: The Shippe may runne vnhapply on a Shelfe, That little doubted, when it lay at hull: What is the Sheepe that neuer lost his Wooll? Or what is hee, that must not leaue his Golde, How deere soeuer hee his Treasure holde? Vngodly Drosse, why should it so be-witch The mindes of men, to take away their mindes, As in too many that are too too rich? Where Catching-spirites Auarice so blindes, As in their Bagges, their begger comfort bindes: Oh hatefull Coyne, that can inuent such euill, As so from God, to sende men to the Deuill. But yet I thinke, I haue my selfe mistaken, Tis but the vse, that makes it good or ill: In an ill sence it ought to be forsaken; But in a good, it helpes a forward will: Then as I sayd, it is a blessed skill, So to conceiue, perceiue, to take and vse it, That Wit may haue no Reason to refuse it. For he that lookes vpon a World of Wealth, May hap be Subiect to this bagidge drosse: And when he thinkes on that vngodly stealth, That makes a gaine of many a thousandes losse: It may be to his Comfort such a Crosse, That he would wish for Iob his pouertie, Rather then Diues superfluitie. But let each Conscience commune with it selfe, And put off Passions with Discretions care: I leaue the Scraper to his scratching pelfe, And, wish the honest wealthy all wellfare: And, to my selfe but an indifferent share. That when Good fortunes lots doe kindly fall, I might haue some, although my some be small. But Wishers, Wise-men say, are idle woulders, And wish and would, is worth but little ware: And they, that are no better knowne housholders, Doe oft at dinner, keepe their Table bare, Where emptie dishes giue but hungry fare: And therefore let them wish for Wealth that list, I'le play the foole no more with Had-I-wist. What I can get, or keepe, or kindly saue, That's vp with fiue; well got, and well spent: A little Spade will make a Great mans Graue: And, hee liues happie, that can die content: And, hee accursed, that is passion rent With griefe, and feare to loose their comfortes heere, And lacke the Ioyes that to the soule are deere. But, let it goe; for tis a perlous thing For many a man almost to meddle withall: It makes some daunce within a wicked Ring, When that the Thiefe doth from the Gallows fall, And doth the Wittes of many a minde enstall: So that in fine, since such it is I see, Let them that list, gape after Golde for mee. And seeke the treasure of the Spirites wealth, Where no Corruption enters with Infection: But Holy-loue maintaines the truest health, And keepes the Sences in their best perfection: While Fayth is fed, but with the Soules affection: And in that Treasure to repose my trust, Which can not fayle, nor with the Canker rust.
