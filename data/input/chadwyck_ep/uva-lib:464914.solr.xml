      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I.—MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. PART I. A PASTORAL. I My Time, O ye Muses, was happily spent, When Phebe went with me wherever I went; Ten thousand sweet Pleasures I felt in my Breast: Sure never fond Shepherd like Colin was blest! But now she is gone, and has left me behind, What a marvellous Change on a sudden I find! When Things were as fine as could possibly be, I thought 'twas the Spring; but alas! it was she. II With such a Companion to tend a few Sheep, To rise up and play, or to lie down and sleep: I was so good-humour'd, so cheerful and gay, My Heart was as light as a Feather all Day. But now I so cross and so peevish am grown, So strangely uneasy, as never was known. My fair one is gone, and my joys are all drown'd, And my Heart,—I am sure it weighs more than a Pound. III The Fountain, that wont to run sweetly along, And dance to soft murmurs the Pebbles among, Thou know'st little Cupid, if Phebe was there, 'Twas Pleasure to look at, 'twas Music to hear. But now she is absent, I walk by its Side, And still, as it murmurs, do nothing but chide: “Must you be so cheerful, while I go in pain? Peace there with your bubbling, and hear me complain.” IV My Lambkins around me would oftentimes play, And Phebe and I were as joyful as they, How pleasant their Sporting, how happy their Time, When Spring, Love, and Beauty were all in their prime! But now, in their Frolics when by me they pass, I fling at their Fleeces an handful of Grass; “Be still, then,” I cry, “for it makes me quite mad To see you so merry, while I am so sad.” V My dog I was ever well pleasèd to see Come wagging his Tail to my Fair one and me; And Phebe was pleas'd too, and to my Dog said, “Come hither, poor Fellow,” and patted his Head. But now, when he's fawning, I with a sour look Cry “Sirrah,” and give him a blow with my Crook; And I'll give him another; for why should not Tray Be as dull as his Master, when Phebe's away? VI When walking with Phebe, what sights have I seen! How fair was the Flower, how fresh was the Green! What a lovely Appearance the Trees and the Shade, The Corn-fields and Hedges, and ev'ry Thing made! But now she has left me, tho' all are still there, They none of them now so delightful appear: 'Twas naught but the Magic, I find, of her Eyes Made so many beautiful Prospects arise. VII Sweet Music went with us both all the Wood thro', The Lark, Linnet, Throstle, and Nightingale too; Winds over us whisper'd, Flocks by us did Bleat, And “chirp” went the Grasshopper under our Feet. But now she is absent, tho' still they sing on, The Woods are but lonely, the Melody's gone: Her Voice in the Consort, as now I have found, Gave ev'ry Thing else its agreeable Sound. VIII Rose, what is become of thy delicate Hue? And where is the Violet's beautiful Blue? Does aught of its Sweetness the Blossom beguile? That Meadow, those Daisies, why do they not smile? Ah, Rivals! I see what it was that you drest And made your selves fine for,—a Place in her Breast: You put on your Colours to pleasure her Eye, To be pluckt by her Hand, on her Bosom to die. IX How slowly Time creeps, till my Phebe return, While amidst the soft Zephyr's cool Breezes I burn; Methinks, if I knew whereabouts he would tread, I could breathe on his Wings, and 'twould melt down the Lead. Fly swifter, ye Minutes, bring hither my Dear, And rest so much longer for't when she is here. Ah, Colin! old Time is full of delay, Nor will budge one Foot faster for all thou can'st say. X Will no pitying Pow'r that hears me complain, Or cure my disquiet, or soften my pain? To be cur'd, thou must, Colin, thy passion remove; But what swain is so silly to live without love? No, Deity, bid the dear Nymph to return, For ne'er was poor Shepherd so sadly forlorn. Ah, what shall I do? I shall die with despair; Take heed, all ye Swains, how ye part with your Fair! HOW TO MOVE THE WORLD. If a man do but keep himself sober and stout, The world as he'd have it must needs turn about. TUNBRIDGIALE, Being a Description of Tunbridge, in a Letter to a Friend at London. I Dear Peter, whose Friendship I value much more, Than Bards their own Verses, or Misers their Store: Your Books, and your Bus'ness, and ev'ry thing else Lay aside for a while, and come down to the Wells! The Country so pleasant, the Weather so fine, A World of fair Ladies, and delicate Wine! The Proposal, I fancy, you'll hardly reject: Then hear, if you come, what you are to expect. II Some sev'n or eight Mile off, to give you the Meeting, Barbers, Dippers, and so forth, we send to you greeting. Soon as they set Eyes on you, off flies the Hat: “Does your Honour want this? does your Honour want that?” That being a Stranger, by this Apparatus You may see our good Manners, before you come at us. Now this, please your Honour, is what we call Tooting, A Trick in your Custom to get the first Footing. III Conducted by these civil Gen'men to Town, You put up your Horse, for Rime's sake, at the Crown. My Landlord bids welcome, and gives you his Word For the best Entertainment the House can afford; You taste which is better, his White, or his Red, Bespeak a good Supper, good Room, and good Bed; In short,—just as Travellers do when they 'light;— So, to fill up the Stanza, I wish you Goodnight. IV But then the next Morning, when Phœbus appears, And with his bright Beams our glad Hemisphere cheers, You rise, dress, get shav'd, and away to the Walks, The Pride of the Place, of which ev'ry one talks. There, I would suppose you a-drinking the Waters, Didn't I know that you come not for any such Matters; But to see the fine Ladies in their Déshabille, A Dress that's sometimes the most studied to kill. V The Ladies you see, aye, and Ladies as fair, As charming, and bright as you'll see anywhere: You eye and examine the beautiful Throng, As o'er the clean Walks they pass lovely along; And if any, by Chance, looks a little Demurer, You fancy, like ev'ry young Fop, you could cure her; Till from some pretty Nymph a deep Wound you receive, And your self want the Cure, which you thought you could give. VI Not so wounded, howe'er, as to make you forget, That your Honour this Morn has not breakfasted yet. So to Morley's you go, look about, and sit down; Then comes the young Lass for your Honour's half-Crown; She brings out the Book, you look wisely upon her: “What's the Meaning of this?”—“To Subscribe, please your Honour.” So you write, as your Betters have all done before ye;— 'Tis a Custom, and so there's an End of the Story. VII And now, all this while, it is forty to one But some Friend or other you've happen'd upon: You all go to Church upon hearing the Bell,— Whether out of Devotion, yourselves best can tell;— From thence to the Tavern to toast pretty Nancy, Th' aforesaid bright Nymph, that had smitten your Fancy: Where Wine and good Victuals attend your Commands, And Wheatears, far better than French Ortolans. VIII Then, after you've din'd, take a View of our Ground, And observe the fine Mountains that compass us round; And, if you could walk a Mile after your Eating, There's some comical Rocks, that are worth contemplating: You may, if you please, for their oddness and make, Compare 'em—let's see—to the Derbyshire Peak; They're one like the other, except that the Wonder Does here lie above Ground, and there it lies under. IX To the Walks, about seven, you trace back your Way, Where the Sun marches off, and the Ladies make Day. What crowding of Charms: Gods,—or rather Goddésses! What Beauties are here! What bright looks, airs, and Dresses! In the room of the Waters had Helicon sprung, And the Nymphs of the Place by old Poets been sung, To invite the Gods hither they would have had Reason, And Jove had descended each Night in the Season. X If with Things here below we compare Things on high, The Walks are like yonder bright Path in the Sky, Where heavenly Bodies in such Clusters mingle, Tis impossible, Sir, to describe 'em all single: But if ever you saw that sweet Creature Miss K?y, If ever you saw her, I say,—let me tell ye, Descriptions are needless: for surely to you, No Beauty, no Graces, can ever be new. XI But when to their Gaming the Ladies withdraw, Those Beauties are fled, which when walking you saw; Ungrateful the Scene which you there see display'd, Chance murd'ring those Features which Heaven had made. If the fair Ones their Charms did sufficiently prize, Their Elbows they'd spare for the sake of their Eyes; And the Men too,—what Work! its enough, in good faith is't, Of the nonsense of Chance to convince any Atheist. XII But now 'tis high Time, I presume, to bid Vale, Lest we tire you too long with our Tunbridgiale; Which if the sour Critics pretend to unravel, Or at these our Verses should stupidly cavil,— If this be the Case, tell the Critics, I pray, That I care not one Farthing for all they can say. And so I conclude, with my Service, good Peter, To yourself and all Friends. Farewell, Muse; farewell, Metre! THE ASTROLOGER. I Fellow-Citizens all, for whose Safety I peep All Night at the Stars, and all Day go to sleep; Attend, while I shew you the Meaning of Fate In all the strange Sights we have seen here of late; And thou, O Astrology, Goddess divine, Celestial Decipheress, gently incline Thine Ears, and thine Aid, to a Lover of Science, That bids to all Learning but thine a Defiance. II For what Learning else is there half so engaging As an Art where the Terms of themselves are presaging; Which by muttering o'er, any gentle Mechanic May put his whole Neighbourhood into a Panic; Where a Noddle well turn'd for Prediction, and Shoes, If it can but remember hard Words, cannot choose, From the Prince on his Throne to the Dairy Maid milking, But read all their Fortunes in yonder blue Welkin? III For the sky is a Book, where, in Letters of Gold, Is writ all that Almanacs ever foretold; Which he that can read and interpret also— What is there, which such a one cannot foreshow? When a true Son of Art ponders over the Stars, They reflect back upon him the Face of Affairs; Of all Things of Moment they give him an Inkling, While Empires and Kingdoms depend on their Twinkling. IV Your Transits, your Comets, Eclipses, Conjunctions, Have all, it is certain, their several Functions; And on this Globe of Earth here, both jointly and singly, Do influence Matters most ástonishingly. But to keep to some Method, on this same Occasion, We'll give you a full and true Interpretation Of all the Phenomena we have rehearst. Of which in their Order: the first, of the first. V As for Mercury's travelling over the Sun, There's Nothing in that, Sirs, when all's said and done; For what will be, will be; and Mercury's Transit, I'm pos'tive, will neither retard, nor advance it. But when a Conjunction or Comet takes Place, Or a total Eclipse, that's a different Case: They that laugh at our Art may here see with their Eyes, That some Things, at least, may appear from the Skies. VI A Conjunction of Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars, You may turn, if you please, Gentlemen, to mere Farce: But what if it plainly appear, that three Men Are foretold by three Planets—what will ye say then? Now, to prove this, I'll only make one small Request, That is, that you'll all turn your Faces to th' East; And then you shall see, ere I've done my Epistle, If I don't make it out, ay, as clear as a Whistle. VII In the first Place, old Saturn, we very well know, Lost his Kingdom and Provinces some while ago; Nor was it long after old Saturn's Disgrace, That Jupiter mov'd to step into his Place; And Mars, we all know, was a quarrelsome Bully, That beat all his Neighbours most únmercifully; And now, who can doubt who these Gentlemen are, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars?—Sophy, Sultan, and Czar. VIII But to prove, nearer Home, that the Stars have not trifl'd, Pray have we not lost, cruel Star, Doctor Byfield? Alas! Friends at Richard's, alas! what a Chasm Will be made in the Annals of Enthusiasm! As soon as the Comet appear'd in the Sky, Pray did not the Doctor straight fall sick and die? I wonder how Folk could discover a Comet, And yet never draw this plain Consequence from it. IX The death of the Regent might show, if it needed, Why they saw it in France fo much plainer than we did; And how well it forebodes to our Nobles and Princes, That its Tail was here shorter by several Inches. But so near to the Eagle this Comet appear'd, That something may happen, it is to be fear'd: Great Men have been known by the Arms which they bore, But “God bless the Emperor,”—I say no more. X And now for th' Eclipse, which is such an Appearance As perhaps will not happen this many a Year hence. The King of France died, the last total Eclipse, Of a Mortification near one of his Hips; From whence by our Art may be plainly made out, That some great Man or other must die at this Bout; But as the Eclipse is not yet, nor that neither, You know 'tis not proper to say more of either. XI Yet two that are false I shall venture to name, Men of Figure and Parts, and of unspotted Fame; Who, all Parties will own, are and always have been Great Ornaments to the high Station they're in, Admir'd of all Sides; who will therefore rejoice, When, consulting the Stars, I pronounce it their Voice, That, for all this Eclipse, there shall no Harm befall Those two honest—Giants, that are in Guildhall. XII So much for great Men;—I come now to predict What Evils in gen'ral will Europe afflict: Now, the Evils that Conjurers tell from the Stars, Are Plague, Famine and Pestilence, Bloodshed and Wars, Contagious Diseases, great Losses of Goods, Great Burnings by Fire, and great Drownings by Floods; Hail, Rain, Frost and Snow, Storms of Lightning and Thunder: And if none of these happen,—'twill be a great Wonder.

I The Hedge-hog for his Arms, I would suppose, Some Sire of ours, beloved Kinsfolk, chose, With aim to hint Instruction wise and good To us Descendants of his Byrom Blood: I would infer, if you be of his Mind, The very Lesson that our Sire design'd. II He had observ'd that Nature gave a Sense To ev'ry Creature of its own Defence,— Down from the Lion with his tearing Jaws To the poor Cat that scratches with her Paws: All show'd their Force, when put upon the Proof, Wherein it lay,—Teeth, Talons, Horn, or Hoof. III Pleas'd with the Porcupine, whose native Art Is said to distance Danger by his Dart, To rout his Foes, before they come too near, From ev'ry Hurt of close Encounter clear: This, had not one Thing bated of its Price, Had been our worthy Ancestor's Device. IV A Foe to none, but ev'ry Body's Friend, And loth, altho' offended, to offend,— He sought to find an Instance, if it could By any Creature's Art be understood, That might betoken Safety when attack'd, Yet where all Hurt should be a Foe's own Act. V At last the Hedge-hog came into his Thought, And gave the perfect Emblem that he sought. This little Creature, all Offence aside, Rolls up itself in its own prickly Hide, When Danger comes; and they that will abuse, Do it themselves, if their own Hurt ensues. VI Methinks, I hear the venerable Sage: “Children! Descendants all thro' ev'ry Age! Learn from the prudent Urchin in your Arms, How to secure yourselves from worldly Harms! Give no Offence,—to you if others will, Firmly wrapt up within yourselves, be still. VII “This Animal is giv'n for outward Sign Of inward, true Security Divine. Sharp on your Minds let pointed Virtues grow, That, without injuring, resist a Foe; Surround with these an honest, harmless Heart, And He that dwells in it will take your Part. VIII “Whatever Ills your christian Peace molest, Turn to the Source of Grace within your Breast; There lies your Safety. O that all my Kin May ever seek it, where 'tis found,—within! That Soul no Ills can ever long annoy, Which makes its God the Centre of its Joy.” A LETTER TO R. L., ESQ. If Senesino do but rift, “O caro, caro!” that flat fifth: I'd hang if e'er an Opera Witling Could tell Cuzzoni from a Kitling! I Dear Peter, if thou can'st descend From Rodelind to hear a Friend, And if those Ravish'd Ears of thine Can quit the shrill celestial Whine Of gentle Eunuchs, and sustain Thy native English without pain, I would, if t'ain't too great a Burden, Thy ravish'd Ears intrude a Word in. II To Richard's and to Tom's full oft Have I stept forth, O Squire of Toft, In hopes that I might win, perchance, A sight of thy sweet Countenance; Forth have I stept, but still, alas! Richard's, or Tom's, 'twas all a Case: Still met I with the same Reply— “Saw you Sir Peter?”—“No, not I.” III Being at length no longer able To bear the dismal Trissylláble, Home I retir'd in saunt'ring Wise, And inward turning all my Eyes, To seek thee in the friendly Breast Where thou hast made a kind of Nest, The gentle Muse I 'gan invoke, And thus the Neck of Silence broke: IV “Muse!” quoth I, treading on her Toes, “Thou sweet Companion of my Woes, That whilom wont to ease my Care, And get me now and then — a Hare: Why am I thus depriv'd the Sight Both of the Alderman and Knight? Tell me, O tell me, gentle Muse, Where is Sir Peter, where is Clowes?” V “Where your Friend Joseph is, or goes,” Reply'd Melpomene, “Lord knows; And what Place is the fairest Bidder For the Knight's presence—. Let's consider: Your wandering Steps you must refer to Rehearsal, Op'ra, or Concerto; At one or other of the three You'll find him most undoubtedly.” VI Now Peter, if the Muse says true, To all my Hopes I bid adieu; Adieu, my hopes, if Op'ramanie Has seiz'd on Peter's Pericranie, Drunk with Italian Siren's Cup! Nay then, in troth, I give him up: The Man's a Quack, whoe'er pretends he Can cure him of that fiddling Phrenzy. EPIGRAM ON THE FEUDS BETWEEN HANDEL AND BONONCINI. Some say, compar'd to Bononcini, That Mynheer Handel's but a Ninny; Others aver, that he to Handel Is scarcely fit to hold a Candle. Strange all this Difference should be 'Twixt Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee! A LETTER TO R. L., ESQ., On His Departure from London. I Dear Peter, whose Absence, whate'er I may do In a Week or two hence, at this Present I rue: These Lines, in great Haste, I convey to the Mitre, To tell the sad Plight of th' unfortunate Writer. You have left your old Friend so affected with Grief, That nothing but Riming can give him Relief; Tho' the Muses were never worse put to their Trumps, To comfort poor Bard in his sorrowful Dumps. II The Moment you left us, with Grief be it spoken, This poor Heart of mine was as thoff it were broken; And I almost faint still if a Carriage approach That looks like a Highgate or Barnet Stage-coach; And really, when first that old Vehicle gap'd To take in Friend Pee—so the Fare had but scap'd, If I did not half wish the Man might overturn it, And swash it to Pieces, I am a sous'd Gurnet. III The Rhenish and Sugar, which at your Departure We drank, would have made me, I hop'd, somewhat heartier; Yet the Wine but more strongly to Weeping inclin'd, And my Grief by the sugar was double-refin'd. It is not to tell how my Breast fell a-throbbing, When at the last Parting our Noses were bobbing! Those sad farewell Accents—I think on 'em still— “You'll remember to write, John?”—“Yes, Peter, I will.” IV You no sooner was gone, but this famous Metropolis, That seem'd just before so exceedingly populous, When I turn'd me towards it, seem'd all of a sudden As if it was gone from the Place it had stood in. But for Squire Hazel's Brother, sagacious Jack, I should hardly have known how to find my Way back; How he brought me from Smithfield to Dick's I can't say, But remember the Charter-House stood in our Way. V At Dick's I repos'd me, and call'd for some Coffee, And sweeten'd, and supt, and still kept thinking of ye; But not with such Pleasure as when I came there To wait 'till Sir Peter should chance to appear. There, while I was turning you o'er in my Mind, “Doctor, how do you do?” says a Voice from behind; Thought I to myself: “I should know that same Organ;”— And who should it be but my Friend Doctor Morgan? VI The Doctor and I took a small walk, and then He went somewhere else, I to Richard's again. All Ways have I try'd the sad Loss to forget. I have saunter'd, writ Short-hand, eat Custard, et cet. With honest Duke Humphrey I pass the long Day, To others, as yet, having little to say; For indeed, I must own, since the Loss of my Chum, I am grown, as it were, a mere Gerund in Dumb. VII But, Muse! we forget that our Grief will prevent us From treating of Matters more high and momentous. Poor Jonathan Wild!—Clowes, Peer Williams and I Have just been in waiting to see him pass by: Good law! how the Houses were crowded with Mobs, That lookt like Leviathan's Picture in Hobbes, From the very ground Floor to the Top of the Leads, While Jonathan past thro' a Holborn of Heads. VIII From Newgate to Tyburn he made his Procession, Supported by two of the nimble Profession: Between the unheeded poor Wretches he sat, In his Night-gown and Wig, but without e'er a Hat; With a Book in his Hand he went weeping and praying, The Mob all along, as he pass'd 'em, huzzaing; While a Parcel of Verses the Hawkers were hollowing, Of which I can only remember these following: IX “The cunning old Pug ev'ry Body remembers, “That, when he saw Chesnuts a roasting i'th' Embers, “To save his own Bacon, took Puss's two Foots, “And so out o'th' Embers he tickl'd his Nuts. “Thus many a poor Rogue has been burnt in the Hand, “And 'twas all Nuts to Jonathan, you understand; “But he was not so cunning as Æsop's old Ape, “For the Monkey has brought himself into the Scrape.” X And now, Peter, I'm come to the end of my Tether; So I wish you good Company, Journey, and Weather, When Friends in the Country enquire after John, Pray tender my Service t'em all every one, To the Ladies at Toft, Legh of High-Legh, To the Altringham Meeting, if any there be, Darcy Lever, Will Drake, Cattell and Cottam,— An excellent Rhime that, to wind up one's Bottom! Richard's Monday Night May 24, 1725. P.S. What News? Why the Lords, if the Minutes say true, Have past my Lord Bolingbroke's Bill three to two,— Three to one, I would say; and resolvèd also That the Commons have made good their Articles—ho! And To-morrow, Earl Thomas's Fate to determine, Their Lordships come arm'd both with Judgment and Ermine; The Surgeons, they say, have got Jonathan's Carcase, If so, I'll go see't, or it shall be a hard Case. EXTEMPORE VERSES Upon a Trial of Skill Between the Two Great Masters of the Noble Science of Defence, Messrs. Figg and Sutton. I Long was the great Figg by the prize fighting Swains Sole Monarch acknowledg'd of Marybone Plains; To the Towns, far and near, did his Valour extend, And swam down the River from Thame to Gravesend; Where liv'd Mr. Sutton, Pipe-maker by Trade, Who, hearing that Figg was thought such a stout Blade, Resolv'd to put in for a Share of his Fame, And so sent to challenge the Champion of Thame. II With alternate Advantage two Trials had past, When they fought out the Rubbers on Wednesday last. To see such a Contest the House was so full, There hardly was room left to thrust in your Skull. With a Prelude of Cudgels we first were saluted, And two or three Shoulders most handsomely fluted; Till, wearied at last with inferior Disasters, All the Company cry'd: “Come, the Masters! the Masters!” III Whereupon the bold Sutton first mounted the Stage, Made his Honours, as usual, and yearn'd to engage; Then Figg, with a Visage so fierce and sedate, Came and enter'd the List with his fresh-shaven Pate. Their Arms were encircled by Armigers two, With a red Ribbon Sutton's and Figg's with a blue. Thus adorn'd, the two Heroes, 'twixt Shoulder and Elbow, Shook Hands, and went to't, and the Word it was “Bilbo.” IV Sure such a Concern in the Eyes of Spectators Was never yet seen in our Amphitheátres: Our Commons and Peers, from their several Places, To half an Inch Distance all pointed their Faces; While the Rays of old Phœbus, that shot thro' the Sky-light, Seem'd to make on the Stage a new kind of Twilight; And the Gods, without doubt, if one could but have seen 'em, Were peeping there thro' to do Justice between 'em. V Figg struck the first Stroke, and with such a vast Fury, That he broke his huge Weapon in Twain, I assure you; And, if his brave Rival this Blow had not warded, His Head from his Shoulders had quite been discarded. Figg arm'd him again, and they took t'other Tilt, And then Sutton's Blade run away from its Hilt. The Weapons were frighted, but as for the Men, In Truth they ne'er minded, but at it again. VI Such a Force in their Blows, you'd have thought it a Wonder Every Stroke they receiv'd did not cleave them asunder; Yet so great was their Courage, so equal their Skill, That they both seem'd as safe as a Thief in a Mill: While in doubtful Attention Dame Victory stood, And which Side to take could not tell for her Blood, But remain'd, like the Ass 'twixt two Bottles of Hay, Without ever moving an Inch either way. VII Till Jove to the Gods signified his Intention In a Speech that he made them, too tedious to mention; But the Upshot on't was, that, at that very Bout, From a Wound in Figg's Side the hot Blood spouted out. Her Ladyship then seem'd to think the Case plain; But Figg stepping forth with a sullen disdain, Shew'd the Gash, and appeal'd to the Company round, If his own broken Sword had not given him the Wound? VIII That Bruises and Wounds a Man's Spirit should touch, With Danger so little, with Honour so much!— Well, they both took a Dram, and return'd to the Battle, And with a fresh Fury they made the Swords rattle; While Sutton's Right Arm was observèd to bleed By a Touch from his Rival,—so Jove had decreed,— Just enough for to shew that his Blood was not Ichor, But made up, like Figg's, of the common red Liquor. IX Again they both rush'd with so equal a Fire on, That the Company cry'd: “Hold, enough of cold Iron! To the Quarter Staff now, Lads.” So first having dram'd it, They took to their Wood, and i'faith never sham'd it. The first Bout they had was so fair and so handsome, That, to make a fair Bargain, 'twas worth a King's Ransom; And Sutton such Bangs to his Neighbour imparted, Would have made any Fibres but Figg's to have smarted. X Then after that Bout they went on to another,— But the Matter must end on some Fashion or other: So Jove told the Gods he had made a Decree, That Figg should hit Sutton a stroke on the Knee. Tho' Sutton, disabled as soon as he hit him, Would still have fought on, but Jove would not permit him. 'Twas his Fate, not his Fault, that constrain'd him to yield: And thus the great Figg became Lord of the Field. XI Now, after such Men, who can bear to be told Of your Roman and Greek puny Heroes of old? To compare such poor Dogs as Alcides and Theseus To Sutton and Figg would be very facetious. Were Hector himself, with Apollo to back him, To encounter with Sutton,—zooks! how he would thwack him! Or Achilles, tho' old Mother Thetis had dipt him, With Figg—odds my Life! how he would have unript him! XII To Cæsar and Pompey, for want of Things juster, We compare these brave Boys; but 'twill never pass Muster. Did those mighty Fellows e'er fight Hand to Fist once? No, I thank you; they kept at a suitable Distance. What is Pompey the Great, with his Armour begirt, To the much greater Sutton, who fought in his Shirt? Or is Figg to be pair'd with a Cap-a-pee Roman. Who scorn'd any Fence but a jolly Abdomen? THE DISSECTION OF A BEAU'S HEAD. From The Spectator, No. 275. I We found by our Glasses, that what at first sight Appear'd to be Brains was another Thing quite; A heap of strange stuff fill'd the holes of his Skull, Which, perhaps, serv'd the Owner as well to the full. And as Homer acquaints us (who certainly knew), That the Blood of the Gods was not real and true, Only something that was very like it: just so, Only something like Brain is the Brain of a Beau. II The Pineal Gland, where the Soul's Residénce is, Smelt desperate strong of Perfúmes, and Essénces, With a bright horny Substance encompast around, That in numberless Forms, like a Diamond, was ground: Insomuch that the Soul, if there was any there, Must have kept pretty constant within its own Sphere; Having Bus'ness enough, without seeking new Traces, To employ all its Time with its own pretty Faces. III In the hind part o'th' Head there was Brussels and Mechlin, And Ribands, and Fringes, and such kind of Tackling; Billet-doux and soft Rimes lin'd the whole Cerebellum, Op'ra songs and prickt Dances, as 'twere upon Vellum. A brown kind of Lump, that we ventur'd to squeeze, Disperst in plain Spanish, and made us all sneeze. In short, many more of the like kind of Fancies, Too tedious to tell, fill'd up other Vacáncies. IV On the Sides of this Head were in several Purses, On the Right, Sighs and Vows,—on the Left, Oaths and Curses. These each sent a Duct to the Root of the Tongue, From whence to the Tip they went jointly along. One particular place was observèd to shine With all sorts of Colours, most wonderful fine; But when we came nearer to view it, in Troth, Upon Éxamination 'twas nothing but Froth. V A pretty large Vessel did plainly appear In that part of the Scull 'twixt the Tongue and the Ear; With a spongy Contrivance distended it was, Which the French Virtuosos call Galimatiás, We Englishmen, nonsense: a Matter indeed That most Peoples Heads are sometimes apt to breed. Entirely free from it, not one Head in twenty; But a Beau's, 'tis presum'd, always has it in plenty. VI Mighty hard, thick, and tough was the Skin of his Front, And, what is more strange, not a Blood Vessel on't; From whence we concluded, the Party deceast Was never much troubled with Blushing at least. The Os Cribriforme as full as could stuff Was cramm'd, and in some Places damag'd, with Snuff: For Beaux with this Ballast keep stuffing their Crib, To preserve their light Heads in a true Æquilib. VII That Muscle, we found, was exceedingly plain, That helps a Man's Nose to express his disdain, If you chance to displease him, or make a Demand, Which is oft the Beau's Case, that he “don't understand.” The Reader well knows, 'tis about this same Muscle That the old Latin Poets all make such a Bustle, When they paint a Man giving his Noddle a Toss, And cocking his Nose, like a Rhínocerós. VIII Looking into the Eye, where the Musculi lay Which are call'd Amatorii, that is to say, Those Muscles, in English, wherewith a Man ogles, When on a fair Lady he fixes his Goggles, We found 'em much worn; but that call'd th' Elevator, Which lifts the Eyes up tow'rds the summit of Nature, Seem'd so little us'd, that the Beau, I dare say, Never dazzled his Eyes much with looking that way. IX The outside of this Head, for its Shape and its Figure, Was like other Heads, neither lesser nor bigger; Its Owner, as we were inform'd, when alive, Had past for a Man of about thirty-five. He ate, and he drank, just like one of the Crowd; For the rest, he drest finely, laught often, talkt loud; Had Talents in's way; for sometimes at a Ball The Beau shew'd his Parts, and outcaper'd 'em all. X Some Ladies, they say, took the Beau for a Wit; But in his Head, truly, there lay—deuce a bit. He was cut off, alas! in the Flow'r of his Age By an eminent Cit, that was put in a Rage: The Beau was, it seems, complimenting his Wife, When his éxtreme Civility cost him his Life; For his Eminence took up an old paring-Shovel, And on the hard Ground left my Gem'man to grovel. XI Having finish'd our Work, we began to replace The Brain, such as 'twas, in its own proper Case. In a fine Piece of scarlet we laid it in State, And resolv'd to prepare so extraordinary a Pate; Which would eas'ly be done, our Anatomist thought, Having found many Tubes that already were fraught With a kind of a Substance he took for Mercurial, Lodg'd there, he suppos'd, long before the Beau's Burial. XII The Head laid aside, he then took up the Heart, Which he likewise laid open with very great Art; And with many Particulars truly we met That gave us great insight into the Coquette. But having, kind Reader, already transgrest Too much on your Patience, we'll let the Heart rest; Having giv'n you the Beau for To-day's Speculation, We'll reserve the Coquette for another Occasion. A Full and True Account of an Horrid and Barbarous Robbery, Committed on Epping Forest upon the Body of the Cambridge Coach. In a Letter to M. F., Esq. Arma Virunque Cano. I Dear Martin Folkes, dear Scholar, Brother, Friend, And Words of like Importance without End: This comes to tell you, how in Epping Hundred Last Wednesday Morning I was robb'd and plunder'd. Forgive the Muse, who sings what, I suppose, Fame has already trumpeted in Prose; But Fame's a lying Jade: the turn of Fate Let poor Melpomene herself relate; Spare the sad Nymph a vacant Hour's Relief, To rime away the Remnants of her Grief. II On Tuesday Night, you know with how much Sorrow I bid the Club farewell: “I go To-morrow.” To-morrow came, and so accordingly Unto the place of Rendezvous went I. Bull was the House, and Bishopgate the Street, The Coach as full as it could cram: to wit, Two Fellow-Commoners de Aulâ Trin., And eke an honest Bricklayer of Lynn, And eke two Norfolk Dames, his Wife and Cousin, And eke my Worship's self, made half a Dozen. II Now then, as Fortune had contriv'd, our Way Thro' the wild Brakes of Epping-Forest lay: With Travellers and Trunks, a hugeous Load, We hagg'd along the solitary Road; Where nought but Thickets within Thickets grew, No House nor Barn to cheer the wand'ring View; Nor lab'ring Hind, nor Shepherd did appear, Nor Sportsman with his Dog or Gun was there; A dreary Landscape, bushy and forlorn, Where Rogues start up like Mushrooms in a Morn. III However, since we, none of us, had yet Such Rogues but in a Sessions Paper met, We jok'd on Fear; tho', as we past along, Robbing was still the Burden of the Song. With untry'd Courage bravely we repell'd The rude Attacks of Dogs—not yet beheld, With val'rous Talk still battling, till at last We thought all Danger was as good as past. Says one,—too soon, alas!—“Now let him come: Full at his Head I'll fling this Bottle of Rum.” IV Scarce had he spoken, when the Brickman's Wife Cry'd out “Good Lord! he's here, upon my Life!” Forth from behind the Wheels the Villain came, And swore such Words as I dare hardly name; But you'll suppose them, Brother, not to drop From me, but him—: “G?d d?n ye, Coachman, stop! Your Money, Z?ds, deliver me your Money! Quick, d?n ye, quick: must I stay waiting on ye? Quick, or I'll send,”—and nearer still he rode,— “A Brace of Balls amongst ye all, by ?!” V I leave you, Sir, to judge yourself, what Plight We all were put in by this cursèd Wight. The trembling Females into Labour fell; Big with the sudden Fear, they Pout, they Swell; And soon, deliver'd by his horrid Curses, Brought forth two Strange and Preternatural Purses, That look'd indeed like Purses made of Leather;— But let the sweet-tongu'd Maningham say whether A common Purse could possibly conceal Shillings, Half-crowns, and Half-pence by piece-meal. VI The Youth, who flung the Bottle at the Knave Before he came, now thought it best to wave Such Resolution, and preserve the Liquor, Since a round Guinea might be thrown much quicker. So, with impetuous Haste he flung him that, Which the sharp Rascal parried with his Hat. His right-hand Man, a Brother of our Quill, Prudently chose to shew his own good Will By the same Token, and without much Scruple Made the Red-rugg'd Collector's Income duple. VII My Heart (for Truth I always must confess) Did sink—an Inch exactly—more or less. With both my Eyes I view'd the Thief's Approach; And read the Case of—Pistol versus Coach; A woeful Case, which I had oft heard quoted, But ne'er before in all my Practice noted. So, when the Lawyers brought in their Report, “Guinea per Christian to be paid in Court:” “Well off, thinks I, “with this same Son of a ?, “If he prefers his Action for no more! VIII “No more! why, hang him, is not that too much, “To pay a Guinea for his vile High-Dutch? “'Tis true, he had us here upon the hank “With Action strong, and swears to it point blank; “Yet why resign the yellow One Pound One? “No, tax his Bill, and give him Silver, John.” So said, so done, and, putting Fist to Fob, I flung th' apparent value of the Job, An Ounce of Silver, into his Receiver, And mark'd the Issue of the Rogue's Behaviour. IX He, like a thankless Wretch that's overpaid, Resents, forsooth, th' Affront upon his Trade; And treats my Kindness with a—“This won't do: Look ye here, Sir, I must ha' Gold from you.” To this Demand of the ungrateful Cur Defendant John thought proper to demur. The Bricklayer, joining in the White Opinion, Tender'd five Shillings to Diana's Minion; Who still kept threatning to pervade his Buff, Because the Payment was not prompt enough. X Before the Women with their Purses each Had Strength to place Contents within his reach, One of his Pieces, falling downwards, drew The Rogue's Attention hungrily thereto. Straight he began to damn the Charioteer: “Come down ye Dog, reach me that Guinea there!” Down jumps th' affrighted Coachman on the Sand, Picks up the Gold, and puts it in his Hand, Missing a rare Occasion, tim'rous Dastard, To seize his Pistol, and dismount the Bastard. XI Now, while in deep and serious Ponderment I watch'd the Motions of his next Intent, He wheel'd about, as one full bent to try The Matter in Dispute 'twixt him and I, And how my Silver Sentiments would hold Against that hard Dilemma, Balls or Gold. “No Help,” said I, “no Tachygraphic Pow'r “To interpose in this unequal Hour? “I doubt—I must resign—there's no defending “The Cause against that murderous Fire-Engine.” XII When lo! descending to her Champion's Aid, The Goddess Short-Hand, bright Celestial Maid, Clad in a letter'd Vest of silver Hue, Wrought by her fav'rite Phebe's Hand, she flew. Th' unfolded Surface fell exactly neat, In just Proportions, o'er her Shape complete; Distinct with Lines of purer flaming White, Transparent Work, Intelligibly bright; Form'd to give Pleasure to th' ingenious Mind, But puzzle and confound the stupid Hind. XIII Soon as the Wretch the Sacred Writing spy'd, “What Conjuration-Sight is this?” he cry'd. My Eyes meanwhile the Heav'nly Vision clear'd; It shew'd how all his hellish Look appear'd. (Heav'n shield all Travellers from foul Disgrace, As I saw Tyburn in the Ruffian's Face! And, if aright I judge of human Mien, His Face ere long in Tyburn will be seen.) The Hostile Blaze soon seiz'd his miscreant Blood; He star'd,—turn'd short,—and fled into the Wood. XIV Danger dismist, the gentle Goddess smil'd Like a fond Parent o'er her fearful Child, And thus began to drive the dire Surprise Forth from my anxious Breast in jocund wise: “My Son,” said she, “this Fellow is no Weston, “No Adversary, Child, to make a Jest on. “With Ink Sulphureous upon Human Skin “He writes, indenting horrid Marks therein; “But—thou hast read his Fate—the halter'd Slave “Shall quickly sing his Penitential Stave. XV “Pursue thy Route; but when thou tak'st another, “Bestride some generous Quadruped or other. “Let this enchanted Vehicle confine, “From this Time forth, no Votaries of mine; “Let me no more see honest Short-hand Men “Coop'd up in Wood, like Poultry in a Pen. “And at Trin. Coll. when e'er thou art enlarging “On Epping-Forest, note this in the Margin: ‘Let Cambridge Scholars, that are not quite bare, ‘Shun the dishonest Track, and ride thro' Ware.’” XVI “Adieu, my Son! resume thy wonted Jokes; “And write Account hereof to Martin Folkes.” This said, she mounts; the Characters divine Thro' the bright Path immensely brilliant shine.— Now safe arriv'd, first for my Boots I wrote; I tell the Story, and subjoin the Note; And lastly, to fulfil the dread Commands, These hasty Lines presume to Kiss your Hands. Excuse the tedious Tale of a Disaster; I am Your Humble Servant and Grand-Master. THE POETASTER. I When a Poet, as Poetry goes now-a-days, Takes it into his Head to put in for the Bays, With an old Book of Rimes and a Half-pint of Claret To cherish his Brains, mounted up to his Garret, Down he sits with his Pen, Ink and Paper before him, And labours as hard as his Mother that bore him. II Thus plac'd, on the Candle he fixes his Eyes, And upon the bright Flame on't looks wonderful wise; Then, snuffing it close, he takes hold of his Pen, And, the Subject not starting, he snuffs it again; Till perceiving at last that not one single Thought, For all his wise Looks, will come forth as it ought, With a Bumper of Wine he emboldens his Blood, And prepares to receive it, whenever it should. III Videlicet: first, he invokes the nine Muses, Or some one of their Tribe for his Patroness chooses; The Girl, to be sure, that of all the long Nomine Best suits with his Rime, as for instance, Melpomene. And what signifies then this old Bard-beaten Whim? What's he to the Muses, or th' Muses to him? Why, the Bus'ness is this: the poor Man, lack-a-day, At first setting out, don't know well what to say. IV Then he thinks of Parnassus and Helicon Streams, And of old musty Bards mumbles over the Names; Talks much to himself of one Phœbus Apollo, And a Parcel of Folk that in's Retinue follow; Of a Horse namèd Pegasus that had two Wings, Of Mountains, and Nymphs, and a hundred fine Things: Tho' with Mountains and Streams, and his Nymphs of Parnáss, The Man, after all, is but just where he was. TO HENRY WRIGHT OF MOBBERLEY, ESQ. On Buying the Picture of Father Malebranche at a Sale. I Well, dear Mr. Wright, I must send you a line:— The purchase is made, Father Malebranche is mine; The adventure is past which I long'd to achieve, And I'm so overjoy'd, you will hardly believe. If you will but have patience, I'll tell you, dear friend, The whole history on't, from beginning to end. Excuse this long tale,—I could talk, Mr. Wright, About this same picture from morning to night. II The morning it low'r'd, like the morning in Cato, And brought on, methought, as important a day too. But about ten o'clock it began to be clear; And, the fate of our capital piece drawing near, Having supp'd off to breakfast some common decoction. Away trudgèd I in all haste to the Auction. Should have call'd upon you, but the Weaver Committee Forbade me that pleasure,—the more was the pity! III The clock struck eleven as I enter'd the room, Where Rembrandt and Guido stood waiting their doom, With Holbein and Rubens, Van Dyck, Tintoret, Jordano, Poussin, Carlo Dolci, et cet. When at length in the corner perceiving the Père, “Ha!” quoth I to his face, “my old friend, are you there?” And methought the face smil'd, just as tho' it would say: “What, you're come, Mr. Byrom, to fetch me away!” IV Now, before I had time to return it an answer, Comes a Short-hander by,—Jemmy Ord was the man, Sir:— “So, Doctor! good morrow!”—“So Jemmy! bon jour! Some rare pictures here!”—“So there are, to be sure. Shall we look at some of them?”—“With all my heart, Jemmy!” So I walk'd up and down, with my old pupil wi' me; Making still such remarks as our wisdom thought proper, Where things were hit off in wood, canvas, or copper. V When at length, about noon, Mr. Auctioneer Cox With his book and his hammer mounts into his box: “Lot the first, number One.” Then advanced his upholder With Malebranche,—so Atlas bore Heav'n on his shoulder. Then my heart, Sir, it went pit-a-pat, in good sooth, To see the sweet face of The Searcher of Truth. “Ha!” thought I to myself, “if it cost me a million, This right honest head, then, shall grace my pavilion.” VI Thus stood Lot the first,—both in number and worth, If pictures were priz'd for the men they set forth. I'm sure, to my thinking, compar'd to this number, Most lots in the room seem'd to be but mere lumber. The head then appearing, Cox left us to see't, And fell to discoursing concerning the feet: “So long, and so broad!—'Tis a very fine head! Please to enter it, gen'men,”—was all that he said. VII Had I been in his place, not the stroke of a hammer, Till the force had been tried both of rhet'ric and grammar. “A very fine head!”—Had thy head been as fine, All the heads in the house had vail'd bonnets to thine!— Not a word, whose it was; but, in short, 'twas a head— “Put it up what you please.” So, somebody said: “Half-a-piece,” and so on. For three pounds and a crown, (To sum up my good fortune) I fetch'd him me down. VIII There were three or four bidders,—I cannot tell whether,— But they never could come two upon me together; For as soon as one spoke, then immediately, pop! I advanc'd something more, fear the hammer should drop. I consider'd, should Cox take a whim of a sudden, What a hurry 'twould put a man's Lancashire blood in! “Once—twice—three pounds five”—so, nemine con., Came an absolute rap, and thrice happy was John. IX “Who bought it?” quoth Cox. “Here's the money,” quoth I, Still willing to make the securest reply; And the safest receipt that a body can trust For preventing disputes, is “Down with your dust!” So I bought it, and paid for 't; and boldly I say, 'Twas the best purchase made at Cadogan's that day: The works the man wrote are the finest in nature; And a most clever piece is his genuine portraíture. X For the rest of the pictures, and how they were sold, To others there present I leave to be told. They seem'd to go off, as at most other sales, Just as folk's money, judgment or fancy prevails, Some cheap, and some dear. Such an image as this Comes a trifle to me, and an odd wooden Swiss Wench's head—God knows, who?—forty-eight guineas, if her Grace of Marlborough likes it:—so fancies will differ. XI When the bus'ness was o'er, and the crowd somewhat gone, Whip, into a coach I convey Number One. “Drive along, honest friend, fast as e'er you can spin.” So he did; and 'tis now safe and sound at Gray's Inn; “Done at Paris,” it says, “from the life by” one “Gery,”— Who that was, I can't tell, but I wish his heart merry,— “In the year Ninety-eight,”—sixty just from the birth Of the greatest divine that e'er liv'd upon earth. XII And now, if some evening, when you are at leisure, You'll come and rejoice with me over my treasure, With a friend or two with you, that will in free sort Let us mix Metaphysics and Short-hand and port: We'll talk of his book, or what else you've a mind Take a glass, read or write, as we see we're inclin'd; Such friends and such freedom!—What can be more clever? Huzza! Father Malebranche and Short-hand for ever! ADVICE TO THE Rev. Messrs. H? and H? to Preach Slow. I Brethren, this comes to let you know That I would have you to preach slow; To give the Words of a Discourse Their proper Time, and Life, and Force; To urge what you think fit to say, In a sedate, pathetic Way, Grave and delib'rate, as 'tis fit To comment upon Holy Writ. II Many a good Sermon gives Distaste By being spoke in too much Haste; Which, had it been pronounc'd with Leisure, Would have been listen'd to with Pleasure; And thus the Preacher often gains His Labour only for his Pains; As (if you doubt it) may appear From ev'ry Sunday in the Year. III For how indeed can one expect The best Discourse should take Effect, Unless the Maker thinks it worth Some Care and Pains to set it forth? What! does he think the Pains he took To write it fairly in a Book, Will do the Bus'ness?—Not a Bit: It must be spoke as well as writ. IV What is a Sermon, good or bad, If a Man reads it like a Lad? To hear some People, when they preach, How they run o'er all Parts of Speech, And neither raise a Word, nor sink: Our learned Bishops, one would think, Had taken School-boys from the Rod, To make Ambassadors of God. V So perfect is the Christian Scheme, He that from thence shall take his Theme; And Time to have it understood, His Sermon cannot but be good. If he will needs be preaching Stuff, No Time indeed is short enough; E'en let him read it like a Letter: The sooner it is done, the better. VI But for a Man that has a Head, (Like yours or mine, I'd like t' have said,) That can upon Occasion raise A just Remark, a proper Phrase: For such a one to run along, Tumbling his Accents o'er his Tongue, Shows only that a Man at once May be a Scholar and a Dunce. VII In point of Sermons, 'tis confest, Our English Clergy make the best. But this appears, we must confess, Not from the Pulpit, but the Press. They manage, with disjointed Skill, The Matter well, the Manner ill; And, what seems Paradox at first, They make the best, and preach the worst. VIII Would they but speak as well as write, Both Excellences would unite: The outward Action being taught To show the Strength of forward Thought. Now, to do this, our Short-hand School Lays down this plain and general Rule: “Take Time enough;”—all other Graces Will soon fill up their proper Places. TO THE SAME. I To Haddon John, and Heyward Thomas, greeting! On Friday next there is to be a meeting At ancient Bufton's, where the brethren, Wright, Baskervyle, Swinton, Toft's facetious knight, [And] Lancaster, and Cattel, if he can, And, on the same terms, Clowes the alderman, Have all agreed to hold, upon the border Of Altrincham, a Chapter of the Order. II Now then, sagacious brethren, if the time Suits with convenience, as it does with rime, I hope we safely may depend upon The representatives of Warrington. See that no business contradict your journey; If any should, transact it by attorney; On Friday morn be ready spurred and booted, That your convenience may not be non-suited. III Moreover, brethren, if the time permit, Bring something in your pockets neatly writ; For thus it was agreed by all our votes, That ev'ry member should produce his notes. “Bring every man some writing of his own That we mayn't meet for theory alone,” Said the Grand-Master, “but for practice also;”— To which the general answer was: “We shall so.” IV Could but I once a country congress fix, Before the winter calls me up to Dick's, And tie therewith, as with a shorthand tether, My Lancashire and Cheshire sons together: Then, emulation would perhaps inspire, And one example set the rest on fire; So should my sons of Lancashire and Cheshire Work ev'ryone at shorthand like a thresher. V Yea, meet, my sons; appoint a shorthand feast Each fortnight, three weeks, or each month at least; Lest it be said by longhand men profane, We caught so many clever folk in vain! Be not discouraged, then, if one by one— Dull solitude!—you go but slowly on: For, when you meet together in a bundle,— Adzooks! you cannot think how fast you'll trundle! VI So saith the simile: we mortal people Are like the bells that hang within a steeple; Where one poor, solitary, single bell Working alone, prolongs a dismal knell; But all together, with one common zeal, Join merrily enough to ring a peal. VERSES SPOKEN EXTEMPORE At the Meeting of a Club, Upon the President's Appearing in a Black Bob-Wig, Who usually wore a White Tie. I Our President, in Days of Yore, Upon his Head a Caxen wore; Upon his Head he wore a Caxen, Of Hair as white as any Flaxen: But now he cares not of a Fig; He wears upon his Poll a Wig,— A shabby Wig upon his Poll, Of Hair as black as any Coal. II A sad and dismal Change, alas! Choose how the Deuce it came to pass! Poor President! what evil Fate Revers'd the colour of his Pate? For if that lamentable Dress Were his own choosing, one would guess, By the deep Mourning of his Head, His Wits were certainly gone dead. III Sure, it could ne'er be his own choosing To put his Head in such a Housing. It must be ominous, I fear; Some Mischief, to be sure, is near. Nay, should that black, fore-boding Phiz Speak from that sturdy Trunk of his, One could not help but think it spoke Just like a Raven from an Oak. IV A Caxen of so black a Hue, On our Affairs looks plaguy blue. We do not meet with such an Omen In any Story, Greek or Roman; A Comet, or a blazing Star Were not so terrible by far. No, in that Wig the Fates have sent us Of all Porténts the most portentous. V Who does not tremble for the Club, That looks upon his Wig so scrub? Without a Knot! without a Tie!— What can we hang together by? So scrub a Wig to look upon,— How can the dire Phænomenon Be long before it has undone us? Oh! 'Tis a cruel Bob upon us. VI The President, when's Wig was white, He was another Mortal quite; Nay, when he sprinkled it with Powder, No Man in Manchester talk'd louder. How blest were we! but now, alack! The wearing of a Wig so black Such a Disgrace has brought about— Burn it! 'twill never be worn out. VII Thou art a Lawyer, honest Joe, I prithee, wilt thou let us know, Whether the black Act won't extend, So as to reach our worthy Friend? What! can he wear a Wig so shabby, When Folks are hang'd from Waltham Abbey, For loving Ven'son, and appearing So like that Head there, so like Fearing? VIII You're a Divine, Sir: I'll ask you, Is that a Christian, or a Jew, Or Turk? “Aye, Turk, as sure as Hops, You see the Saracen in his Chops.” And yet these Chops, tho' now so homely, Were Christian-like before, and comely. That wicked Wig! to make a Face So absolutely void of Grace! IX You, Master Doctor, will you try Your skill in Physiognomy? Of what Disease is it a Symptom? Don't look at me, but look at him, Tom. Is it not Scurvy, think you?—“Yes; If any thing be Scurvy, 'tis.” A Phrenzy? or a Periwigmanie That over-runs his Pericranie? X “It seems to me a Complication Of all Distempers, o' some Fashion; It is a Coma, that is plain, A great Obstruction of the Brain. A Man to take his Brains, and bury 'em In such a Wig!—a plain Delirium! I never saw a human Face That suffer'd more by such a Case. XI “If you examine it, you'll see 'tis P?burnt: that shows a Diabetes. Bad Weather has relaxt, you see, The Fibres to a great Degree; Certès, the Head, in these black Tumours, Is full of vitiated Humours,— Of vitiated Humours full, Which shows a Numbness of the Scull. XII “So of the rest.”—But now, Friend Thomas, The Cure will be expected from us; For while it hangs on him, of course, It will, if possible, grow worse. “Habit so foul! there is, in short, Nothing but Salivation for't.” But what can Salivation do? It has been fluxt, and refluxt too. XIII But why to Doctors do I urge on The Bus'ness of a Barber-Surgeon? Your Barber-Surgeon is the Man It must be cur'd by, if it can. Ring for my Landlord Lawrenson; Come, let's e'en try what can be done; A Remedy there may be found, Provided that the Brain be sound. TO THE REV. MESSRS. H? AND H? On Preaching Extempore. I The Hint I gave sometime ago, Brethren, about your preaching slow, You took, it seems; and thereupon Could make two Sermons out of one. Now this Regard, to former Lines Paid so successfully, inclines To send Advice the second Part: “Try if you cannot preach by Heart.” II Be not alarm'd, as if Regard To this would prove so very hard. The first Admonishment you fear'd Would so turn out, till it appear'd That Custom only made to seem So difficult in your Esteem What, upon Trial, now procures Your Hearers' Ease, and also yours. III Do but consider how the Case Now stands in fact in ev'ry Place, All Christendom almost around, Except on our reformèd Ground. The greatest Part, untaught to brook A Preacher's reading from a Book, Would scarce advance within his reach, Or then acknowledge him to preach. IV Long after preaching first began, How unconceiv'd a reading Plan! The rise of which, whatever Date May be assign'd to it, is late;— From all Antiquity remote The manuscriptal reading Rote; No Need, no Reason prompted then The Pulpit to consult the Pen. V However well prepar'd before, By pond'ring, or by writing o'er What he should say, still it was said By him that preach'd,—it was not read. Could ancient Memory, then, better Forbear the poring o'er the Letter, Brethren, than yours? If you'll but try, That Fact I'll venture to deny. VI Moderns, of late, give Proofs enow (Too many, as it seems to you), That Matters of religious Kind, Stor'd up within the thoughtful Mind, With any Care and Caution stor'd, Sufficient Utterance afford To tell an Audience what they think, Without the Help of Pen and Ink. VII How apt to think too, is the Throng, A Preacher short, a Reader long! Claiming itself to be the Book That should attract a Pastor's Look. If you lament a careless Age, Averse to hear the Pulpit Page, Speak from within, not from without, And Heart to Heart will turn about. VIII Try it; and if you can't succeed, 'Twill then be right for you to read; Altho' the Heart, if that's your choice, Must still accompany the Voice. And tho' you should succeed, and take The Hint, you must not merely make Preaching extempore the View, But ex Æternitate too. ON CLERGYMEN PREACHING POLITICS. To R? L?, Esq. I Indeed, Sir Peter, I could wish, I own, That Parsons would let Politics alone! Plead, if they will, the customary Plea For such like Talk, when o'er a Dish of Tea; But when they teaze us with it from the Pulpit, I own, Sir Peter, that I cannot gulp it. II If on their Rules a Justice should intrench And preach, suppose, a Sermon from the Bench, Would you not think your Brother Magistrate Was touch'd a little in his hinder Pate? Now, which is worse, Sir Peter, on the total,— The Lay Vagary, or the Sacerdotal? III In ancient Times, when Preachers preach'd indeed Their Sermons, ere the Learnèd learnt to read, Another Spirit and another Life Shut the Church Doors against all Party strife. Since then, how often heard from sacred Rostrums The lifeless Din of Whig and Tory Nostrums! IV 'Tis wrong, Sir Peter, I insist upon't; To common Sense 'tis plainly an Affront. The Parson leaves the Christian in the Lurch, Whene'er he brings his Politics to Church. His Cant, on either Side, if he calls Preaching, The Man's wrong-headed, and his Brains want Bleaching. V Recall the Time from conquering William's Reign, And guess the Fruits of such a preaching Vein: How oft its Nonsense must have veer'd about, Just as the Politics were in or out;— The Pulpit govern'd by no Gospel Data, But new Success still mending old Errata! VI Were I a King (God bless me!) I should hate My Chaplains meddling with Affairs of State; Nor would my Subjects, I should think, be fond, Whenever theirs the Bible went beyond. How well, methinks, we both should live together, If these good Folks would keep within their Tether! THE PLEASURES OF CHESS. Checkmate, dear Doctor! Well, I do profess, It is an admirable game, this chess,— A sweet device; whoever found it out, He was a clever fellow, without doubt. BONE AND SKIN. AN EPIGRAM. Bone and Skin, Two millers thin, Would starve the town, or near it;— But be it known To Skin and Bone, That Flesh and Blood can't bear it. CONTENTMENT, OR THE HAPPY WORKMAN'S SONG. I I Am a poor Workman as rich as a Jew,— A strange sort of Tale, but however 'tis true; Come listen a while, and I'll prove it to you So as Nobody can deny, &amp;c. II I am a poor Workman, you'll easily grant; And I'm rich as a Jew, for there's nothing I want; I have Meat, Drink, and Cloaths, and am hearty and cant, Which Nobody can deny, &amp;c. III I live in a Cottage, and yonder it stands; And while I can work with these two honest Hands, I'm as happy as they that have Houses and Lands, Which Nobody can deny, &amp;c. IV I keep to my Workmanship all the Day long, I sing and I whistle, and this is my Song: “Thank God, That has made me so lusty and strong,” Which Nobody can deny, &amp;c. V I never am greedy of delicate Fare; If He give me enough, tho' 'tis never so bare, The more is His Love, and the less is my Care, Which Nobody can deny, &amp;c. VI My Clothes on a Working-day looken but lean; But when I can dress me—on Sundays, I mean,— Tho' cheap, they are warm, and tho' coarse, they are clean, Which Nobody can deny, &amp;c. VII Folk cry'n out “hard Times,” but I never regard, For I ne'er did, nor will set my Heart upo'th' Ward; So 'tis all one to me, bin they easy or hard, Which Nobody can deny, &amp;c. VIII I envy not them that have thousands of Pounds, That sport o'er the Country with Horses and Hounds; There's nought but Contentment can keep within bounds, Which Nobody can deny, &amp;c. IX I ne'er lose my Time o'er a Pipe, or a Pot, Nor cower in a Nook like a sluggardly Sot; But I buy what is wanting with what I have got, Which Nobody can deny, &amp;c. X And if I have more than I want for to spend, I help a poor Neighbour or diligent Friend; He that gives to the Poor, to the Lord he doth lend, Which Nobody can deny, &amp;c. XI I grudge not that Gentlefolk dressen so fine; At their Gold and their Silver I never repine, But I wish all their Guts were as hearty as mine, Which Nobody can deny, &amp;c. XII With Quarrels o'th' Country, and Matters of State, With Tories and Whigs, I ne'er puzzle my Pate; There's some that I love, and there's none that I hate, Which Nobody can deny, &amp;c. XIII What tho' my Condition be ever so coarse, I strive to embrace it for better and worse; And my Heart, I thank God, is as light as my Purse, Which Nobody can deny, &amp;c. XIV In short, my Condition, whatever it be, 'Tis God that appoints it, as far as I see; And I'm sure I can never do better than He, Which Nobody can deny, &amp;c. A SONG. [Why, prithee now, what does it signify] I Why, prithee now, what does it signify For to bustle and make such a Rout? It is Virtue alone that can dignify, Whether clothèd in Ermine or Clout. Come, come, and maintain thy Discretion, Let it act a more generous Part; For I find, by thy honest Confession, That the World has too much of thy Heart. II Beware, that its fatal Ascendancy Do not tempt thee to mope and repine; With an humble and hopeful Dependency Still await the good Pleasure Divine. Success in a higher Beatitude Is the End of what's under the Pole; A Philosopher takes it with Gratitude, And believes it is best on the whole. III The World is a Scene, thou art sensible, Upon which, if we do but our best, On a Wisdom That's incomprehensible We may safely rely for the rest: Then trust to Its kind Distribution; And, however Things happen to fall, Prithee, pluck up a good Resolution To be cheerful and thankful in all! CARELESS CONTENT. I I Am Content, I do not care, Wag as it will the World for me; When Fuss and Fret was all my Fare, It got no ground, as I could see: So, when away my Caring went, I counted Cost, and was Content. II With more of Thanks, and less of Thought, I strive to make my Matters meet; To seek, what ancient Sages sought, Physic and Food in sour and sweet; To take what passes in good Part, And keep the Hiccups from the Heart. III With good and gentle-humour'd Hearts I choose to chat where'er I come, Whate'er the Subject be that starts; But if I get among the Glum, I hold my Tongue to tell the Troth, And keep my Breath to cool my Broth. IV For Chance or Change, of Peace or Pain, For Fortune's Favour, or her Frown, For Lack or Glut, for Loss or Gain, I never dodge, nor up nor down; But swing what Way the Ship shall swim, Or tack about, with equal Trim. V I suit not where I shall not speed, Nor trace the Turn of ev'ry Tide; If simple Sense will not succeed, I make no Bustling, but abide: For shining Wealth, or scaring Woe, I force no Friend, I fear no Foe. VI Of Ups and Downs, of Ins and Outs, Of “they're i' th' wrong,” and “we're i' th' right,” I shun the Rancours, and the Routs; And, wishing well to every Wight, Whatever Turn the Matter takes, I deem it all but Ducks and Drakes. VII With whom I feast I do not fawn, Nor if the Folks should flout me, faint; If wonted Welcome be withdrawn, I cook no Kind of a Complaint,— With none dispos'd to disagree; But like them best, who best like me. VIII Not that I rate myself the Rule How all my Betters should behave; But Fame shall find me no Man's Fool, Nor to a Set of Men a Slave; I love a Friendship free and frank, And hate to hang upon a Hank. IX Fond of a true and trusty Tie, I never loose where'er I link; Tho', if a Bus'ness budges by, I talk thereon just as I think: My Word, my Work, my Heart, my Hand, Still on a Side together stand. X If Names or Notions make a noise, Whatever Hap the Question hath, The Point impartially I poise, And read or write, but without Wrath: For, should I burn or break my Brains, Pray, who will pay me for my Pains? XI I love my Neighbour as myself, Myself like him too, by his Leave; Nor to his Pleasure, Pow'r or Pelf, Come I to crouch, as I conceive; Dame Nature doubtless has design'd A Man the Monarch of his Mind. XII Now taste and try this Temper, Sirs, Mood it and brood it in your Breast; Or, if ye ween, for worldly stirs That Man does right to mar his Rest, Let me be deft and debonair: I am Content, I do not care. A DIALOGUE ON CONTENTMENT. J. What Ills, dear Phebe, would it not prevent, To learn this one short lesson: “Be content!” No very hard Prescription, in effect, This same Content; and yet, thro' its neglect, What mighty Evils do “we human Elves,” As Prior calls us, bring upon ourselves! Evils that Nature never meant us for, The Vacuums that she really does abhor. Of all the Ways of judging Things amiss, No Instance shows our Weakness more than this: That Men on Earth won't set their Hearts at rest, When God in Heaven does all Things for the best. What strange, absurd Perverseness! P. Hold, good Brother! Don't put yourself, I pray, in such a Pother; “'Tis a fine Thing to be Content;” why, true; 'Tis just and right, we know as well as you; And yet, to be so, after all this Rout, Sometimes has puzzled you yourself, I doubt. Folks in the Vigour of their Health and Strength May rail at Discontent in Words at length, Who yet, when disappointed of their Wishes, Will put you off with surly “Humphs” and “Pishes.” “Let's be content and easy!”—gen'ral Stuff! Your happy People are content enough. If you would reason to the Purpose, show How they who are unhappy may be so; How they who are in Sickness, Want, or Pain, May get their Health, Estate, and Ease again; How they— J. Nay, Phebe, don't go on so fast; Your just Rebuke now suits yourself at last. Methinks you wander widely from the Fact: 'Tis not how you or I or others act That we are talking of, but how we should. A Rule, tho' ill observ'd, may still be good. Nor did I say that a contented Will Would hinder all, but many Sorts of Ill. This it will do, and, give me Leave to say, Much lessen such as it can't take away. You said your-self, 'twas just; I think you did— P. Yes, yes; I don't deny it— J. Sense forbid That e'er you should! Its Practice then, perchance, Is monstrous hard in many a Circumstance? P. “Monstrous?” why Monstrous? Let that Word be barr'd, And I shan't stick to say, I think it “hard,” And very hard; nay, I could almost add That, in some Cases, 'tis not to be had. J. “Not to be had?” Content? It costs'us naught; 'Tis purchas'd only with a little Thought; We need not fetch it from a distant Clime, It may be found at Home at any Time; Our very Cares contribute to its Growth, It knows no Check but voluntary Sloth; None but ourselves can rob us of its Fruit; It finds, whene'er we use it, fresh Recruit; The more we gather, still the more it thrives, Fresh as our Hopes and lasting as our Lives: “Not to be had” is wrong;—but, I forgot, You did not say quite absolutely “not,” But could “almost” have said so; the “almost” Perhaps was meant against a florid Boast Of such Content as, when a Trial came Severe enough, would hardly own its Name. P. Perhaps it was; and, now your Fire is spent, You can reflect, I find, that this Content, Which you are fond of celebrating so, May, now and then, be difficult to show: So difficult that— J. Hold a bit, or ten To one the Chance, that I shall fire again! “'Tis just and right,” you own as well as me. Now, for my Part, I rather choose to see The Easiness of what is just and right, Which makes it more encouraging to Sight, Than scarecrow Hardships that almost declare Content an un-come-at-able Affair, And consequently tempt one to distrust For Difficulties what is right and just. Thus I object to Hardship; if you please, Show for what Reason you object to Ease. P. Why, for this Reason:—tho' it should be true That what is just and right, is easy too, Such Ease is nothing of a talking kind, But of right Will, that likes to be resign'd, And cherishes a Grace which, with regard To the unpractis'd, may sometimes be hard. You treat Content as if it were a Weed Of neither Cost nor Culture; when indeed It is as fine a Flower that can be found Within the Mind's best cultivated Ground; Where, like a Seed, it must have light and Air To help its Growth, according to the Care That Owners take, whose philosophic Skill Will much depend upon the Weather still. Good should not make them careless, nor should bad Discourage— J. Right, provided it be had. I'll not dispute, but own, what you have said Has hit the Nail, directly, on the Head: Easy or hard, all Pains within our Pow'r Are well bestow'd on such a charming Flow'r. ON PATIENCE. Written at the Request of a Friend. PART I. I “A verse on Patience?” Yes; but then prepare Your Mind, Friend H?c?t, with a reading Share; Or else 'twill give you rather less than more, To hear it mention'd, than you had before: If mine to write, remember, 'tis your Task To bear the Lines which you are pleas'd to ask. II Patience the Theme.—A blessèd Inmate this, The nursing Parent of our Bosom Bliss: Abroad for Bliss she bids us not to roam, But cultivate is real Fund at Home,— A noble Treasure, when the patient Soul Sits in the Centre, and surveys the whole. III The bustling World, to fetch her out from thence, Will urge the various, plausible Pretence; Will praise Perfections of a grander Name, Sound great Exploíts, and call her out to Fame; Amuse and flatter, till the Soul, too prone To Self-activity, deserts her Throne. IV Be on your Guard; the Bus'ness of a Man Is, to be sure, to do what good he can,— But first at Home: let Patience rule within, Where Charity, you know, must first begin; Not money'd Love is fondly understood, But calm, sedate Propensity to Good. V The genuine Product of the Virtue, Friend, Which you oblige me here to recommend; The Trial this of all the rest beside, For, without Patience, they are all but Pride; A strong Ambition shines within its Sphere, But proves its Weakness when it cannot bear. VI There lies the Test; bring ev'ry thing to that; It shows us plainly what we would be at: Of gen'rous Actions we may count the Sum, But scarce the Worth, till Disappointments come. Men oft are then most gen'rously absurd: Their own good Actions have their own bad Word. VII Impatience hates Ingratitude, forsooth! Why? It discovers an ungrateful Truth: That, having done for Interest or Fame Such and such doings, she has lost her Aim; While thankless People, really in her Debt, Have all got theirs, and put her in a Fret. VIII Possest of Patience, a right humble Mind At all Events is totally resign'd; Does good for sake of good, not for th' Event, Leaves that to Heav'n, and keeps to its Content; Good to be done or, to be suffer'd, Ill, It acts, it bears, with meek, submissive Will. IX “Enough, enough! Now tell me, if you please, “How is it to be had, this mental Ease?” God knows, I do not, how it is acquir'd; But this I know: if heartily desir'd, We shall be thankful for the Donor's Leave To ask, to hope, and wait till we receive. PART II. I “Virtues,” you say, “by Patience must be tried; “If that be wanting, they are all but Pride.” “Of Rule so strict I want to have a Clue.” Well, if you'll have the same Indulgence too, And take a fresh Compliance in good Part, I'll do the best I can, with all my Heart. II Pride is the grand Distemper of the Mind, The Source of ev'ry Vice of ev'ry Kind. That Love of self, wherein its Essence lies, Gives Birth to vicious Tempers, and supplies; We coin a world of Names for them, but still, All comes to Fondness for our own dear Will. III We see, by Facts, upon the triple Stage Of present Life, Youth, Manhood, and old Age, How, to be pleas'd, be honour'd, and be rich,— These three Conditions commonly bewitch. From young to old, if human Faults you weigh, 'Tis selfish Pride that grows from green so grey. IV Pride is, indeed, a more accustom'd Name For quest of Grandeur, Eminence, or Fame; But that of Pleasure, that of Gold betrays What inward Principle it is that sways; The Rake's young Dotage, and the Miser's old, One same enslaving Love to Self unfold. V If Pride be thus the Fountain of all Vice; Whence must we say that Virtue has its rise But from Humility? and what the sure And certain sign, that even this is pure? For Pride itself will in its Dress appear, When nothing touches that same Self too near. VI But when provok'd, and, say, unjustly too, Then Pride disrobes; then, what a huge ado! Then, who can blame the Passion of a Pride, That has got Reason, Reason of its Side? “He's in the wrong, and I am in the right;— Resentment, come! Humility, good Night!” VII Now, the Criterion, I apprehend, On which, if any, one may best depend, Is Patience; is the “Bear” and the “Forbear,” To which the truly virtuous adhere; Resolv'd to suffer, without Pro and Con, A thousand Evils rather than do one. VIII Not to have Patience, and yet not be proud, Is Contradiction not to be allow'd: All Eyes are open to so plain a Cheat, But of the blinded by the Self-deceit; Who, with a like Consistency, may tell That nothing ails them, tho' they are not well. IX Strict is the Rule, but, notwithstanding, true, However I fall short of it, or you: Best to increase our Stock, if it be small, By dealing in it with our Neighbours all; And then, who knows but we shall, in the End, Learn to have Patience with ourselves,—and mend? A HINT TO A YOUNG PERSON, For his better Improvement by Reading or Conversation. I In reading Authors, when you find Bright Passages that strike your Mind, And which perhaps you may have Reason To think on at another Season: Be not contented with the Sight, But take them down in Black and White. Such a Respect is wisely shown That makes another's Sense one's own. II When you're asleep upon your Bed, A Thought may come into your Head, Which may be of good use, if taken Due Notice of when you're awaken. Of midnight Thoughts to take no heed Betrays a sleepy Soul indeed; It is but dreaming in the Day To throw our nightly Hours away. III In Conversation, when you meet With Persons cheerful and discreet, That speak or quote, in Prose or Rime, Things or facetious or sublime, Observe what passes, and anon, When you come home, think thereupon; Write what occurs, forget it not; A good Thing sav'd's a good Thing got. IV Let no remarkable Event Pass with a gaping Wonderment,— A Fool's device: “Lord, who would think!”— Commit it safe to Pen and Ink, Whate'er deserves Attention now; For, when 'tis pass'd, you know not how, Too late you'll find it, to your Cost, So much of human Life is lost. V Were it not for the written Letter, Pray, what were living Men the better For all the Labours of the Dead, For all that Socrates e'er said? The Morals brought from Heav'n to Men He would have carried back again: 'Tis owing to his Short-hand Youth That Socrates does now speak Truth. ABSENT FRIENDS. What! be a Niger? No, my absent friend! Whoever talks against him, I'll defend. POWDER WITHOUT SHOT. For sixty-five if sixty-eight were laid, A compliment to Bentley would be paid; Like to a Prince, to celebrate whose birth The rusty cannons are stuck deep in earth; Well-primed, they fire; give ev'ry year a stroke And so discharge their powder and their smoke. EPILOGUE TO HURLOTHRUMBO, OR, THE SUPERNATURAL. Enter Hurlothrumbo. Ladies and Gentlemen, my Lord of Flame Has sent me here to thank you in his Name. Proud of your Smiles, he's mounted many a Story Above the tip-top Pinnacle of Glory: Thence he defies the Sons of Clay, the Critics,— “Fellows,” says he, “that are mere Paralytics, With Judgments lame and Intellects that halt, Because a Man outruns them, they find fault.” He is indeed, to speak my poor Opinion, Out of the reach of critical Dominion. [Enter Critic. Adso! here's one of 'em. Cr. A strange odd Play, Sir; [Enter Author; pushes Hurlothrumbo aside. Au. Let me come to him! Pray, what's that you say, Sir? Cr. I say, Sir, Rules are not observ'd here— Au. Rules, Like Clocks and Watches, were all made for Fools. Rules make a Play? that is— Cr. What, Mr. Singer? Au. As if a Knife and Fork should make a Finger. Cr. Pray, Sir, which is the Hero of your Play? Au. Hero? Why, they're all Heroes in their Way. Cr. But, here's no Plot!—or none that's understood. Au. There's a Rebellion, tho'; and that's as good. Cr. No Spirit, nor Genius in't. Au. Why, didn't here A SPIRIT and a GENIUS both appear? Cr. Poh! 'tis all Stuff and Nonsense— Au. Lack-a-day! Why, that's the very Essence of a Play. Your Old House, New House, Opera, and Ball,— 'Tis NONSENSE, Critic, that supports'em all, As you yourselves ingeniously have shown, Whilst on their Nonsense you have built your own. Cr. Here wants— Au. Wants what? Why now, for all your canting, What one Ingredient of a Play is wanting? Music, Love, War, Death, Madness without Sham, Done to the Life, by Persons of the Dram.; Scenes and Machines, descending and arising; Thunder and Lightning;—ev'rything surprising! Cr. Play, Farce, or Opera is't? Au. No matter whether; 'Tis a Rehearsal of 'em all together. But come, Sir, come! Troop off, old Blundermonger, And interrupt the Epilogue no longer! [Author drives the Critic off the Stage. Hurlo, proceed! Hurlo. Troth! he says true enough; The Stage has given Rise to wretched Stuff. Critic or Player, a Dennis or a Cibber, Vie only which shall make it go down glibber. A thousand murd'rous Ways they cast about To stifle it; but, Murder-like, 'twill out. Our Author fairly, without so much Fuss, Shows it in puris Naturalibus; Pursues the Point beyond its highest Height; Then bids his Men of Fire and Ladies bright Mark how it looks, when it is out of sight. So true a Stage, so fair a Play for Laughter, There never was before, nor ever will come after,— Never, no never! Not while vital Breath Defends ye from that long-liv'd mortal, Death. “Death!”—Something hangs on my prophetic Tongue; I'll give it Utterance, be it right or wrong: “Handel himself shall yield to Hurlothrumbo, And Bononcini too shall cry ‘Succumbo;’”— That's, if the Ladies condescend to Smile: Their Looks make Sense or Nonsense in our Isle. THE THREE BLACK CROWS. A TALE. I. “Tale?” That will raise the Question, I suppose: “What can the Meaning be of the three black Crows?” It is a London Story, you must know, And happen'd, as they say, some Time ago. The Meaning of it Custom would suppress, Till at the End;—but come, nevertheless, Tho' it may vary from the Use of old To tell the Moral till the Tale be told, We'll give a Hint, for once, how to apply The Meaning, first—and hang the Tale thereby. II. People full oft are put into a Pother, For want of understanding one another; And strange, amusing Stories creep about, That come to Nothing, if you trace them out; Lies of the Day, or Month perhaps, or Year, That serve their Purpose and then disappear; From which, meanwhile, Disputes of ev'ry Size, That is to say, Misunderstandings, rise, The Springs of Ill, from Bick'ring up to Battle, From Wars and Tumults down to Tittle-Tattle: Such as, for Instance (for we need not roam Far off to find them, but come nearer Home) Such as befall by sudden misdivining On Cuts, on Coals, on Boxes, and on Signing, Or (may good Sense avert such hasty Ills From this Foundation, this Assembly),—Mills! It may, at least it should, correct a Zeal That hurts the public or the private Weal, By eager giving of too rash Assent, To note, how Meanings that were never meant Will fly about, like so many black Crows, Of that same Breed of which the Story goes. III. Two honest Tradesmen meeting in the Strand, One took the other briskly by the Hand; “Hark-ye,” said he, “'tis an odd Story this About the Crows!”—“I don't know what it is,” Replied his Friend.—“No? I'm surprised at that; Where I come from it is the common Chat. But you shall hear:—an odd Affair indeed! And, that it happen'd, they are All agreed. Not to detain you from a Thing so strange, A Gentlemen, that lives not far from 'Change, This Week, in short, as all the Alley knows, Taking a Puke, has thrown up Three black Crows.” IV. “Impossible!” “Nay, but it's really true; I have it from good Hands, and so may You.” “From whose, I pray?”—So, having nam'd the Man, Straight to enquire his curious Comrade ran. “Sir, did you tell”—relating the Affair— “Yes, Sir, I did; and if it's worth your Care, Ask Mr. Such a-one, he told it me;— But, by the Bye, 'twas Two black Crows, not Three.” V. Resolv'd to trace so wond'rous an Event, Whip, to the third the Virtuoso went. “Sir”—and so forth;—“Why yes; the Thing is Fact, Tho' in regard to Number not exact: It was not Two black Crows, 'twas only One: The Truth of that you may depend upon. The Gentleman himself told me the Case.” “Where may I find him?”—“Why, in such a Place.” VI. Away goes he, and having found him out: “Sir, be so good as to resolve a Doubt.” Then to his last Informant he referr'd, And begg'd to know, if true what he had heard; “Did you, Sir, throw up a black Crow?”—“Not I!” “Bless me, how People propagate a Lie! Black Crows have been thrown up, Three, Two and One; And here, I find, all comes at last to None! Did you say Nothing of a Crow at all?”— “Crow? Crow?—perhaps I might, now I recall The Matter over.”—“And, pray Sir, what was't?”— “Why, I was horrid sick, and, at the last, I did throw up, and told my Neighbour so, Something that was—as black, Sir, as a Crow.” VERSES On the Danger and Impropriety of Hastily Attaching Wrong Ideas to Words or Epithets. I. 'Tis not to tell what various Mischief springs From wrong Ideas fix'd to Words or Things, When Men of hasty and impatient Thought Will not examine Matters, as they ought, But snatch the first Appearance, nor suspect, What is so oft the Case, their own Defect. II. Defect—which, if occasion offers, makes The most absurd, ridiculous Mistakes, To say no worse;—for Evils to recite Of deeper kind is not our Task to-night, But just to versify a case or two That grave Divines relate, and, when they do, Justly remark that, in effect, the prone To hasty Judgment make the case their own. III. When Martin Luther first grew into fame, His Followers obtain'd a double Name: Some call'd 'em Martinists, and some again Express'd by Lutherans the self-same Men. Meaning the same, you see, and same the Ground; But mark the force of Diff'rence in the Sound. IV. Two zealous Proselytes to his Reform, Which then had rais'd an universal Storm, Meeting by chance upon a publick Walk, Soon made Religion Subject of their talk; Its low Condition both dispos'd to own, And how corrupt the Church of Rome was grown. In this preliminary Point indeed, Tho' Strangers to each other, they agreed; But, as the Times had bred some other Chiefs, Who undertook to cure the common Griefs, They were oblig'd, by further hints, to find, If in their choice they both were of a Mind. After some winding of their Words about, To seek this secondary Problem out, “I am,” declar'd the bolder of the two, “A Martinist, and so, I hope, are you.” “No,” said the other, growing somewhat hot, “But I'll assure you, Sir, that I am not; I am a Lutheran; and, live or die, Shall not be any thing beside, not I.” “If not a Martinist,” his Friend replied, “Truly, I care not what you are beside.” Thus Fray began, which, Critics may suppose, But for Spectators would have come to Blows; And so they parted, Matters half discuss'd, All in a huff, with mutual disgust. V. The prose Account of Dr. More, I think, Relates the Story of two Clowns in Drink. The Verse has cloth'd it in a different strain; But, either way, the gentle Hint is plain, That 'tis a foolish Bus'ness to commence Dispute on Words, without regard to Sense. VI. Such was the case of these two Partizans; There is another of a single Man's Still more absurd, if possible, than this Must I go on, and tell it you? (Chorus:) “Yes, Yes.” VII. A certain Artist, I forget his Name, Had got for making Spectacles a Fame, Or “Helps to read,”—as, when they first were sold, Was writ, upon his glaring Sign, in Gold; And, for all Uses to be had from Glass, His were allow'd by Readers to surpass. There came a Man into his Shop one Day: “Are you the Spectacle-Contriver, pray?” “Yes, Sir,” said he; “I can, in that Affair, Contrive to please you, if you want a Pair.” “Can you? pray, do then!” So at first he chose To place a youngish Pair upon his Nose, And Book produc'd, to see how they would fit; Ask'd how he lik'd 'em. “Like 'em? Not a bit.” “Then, Sir, I fancy, if you please to try, These in my Hand will better suit your Eye.” “No, but they don't.” Well, come Sir, if you please, Here is another Sort, we'll e'en try these; Still somewhat more they magnify the Letter: Now, Sir?” “Why, now—I'm not a bit the better.” “No? Here, take these that magnify still more; How do they fit?” “Like all the rest before.” VIII. In short, they tried a whole Assortment thro', But all in vain; for none of them would do. The Operator, much surpris'd to find So odd a Cast, thought, sure the Man is Blind! “What sort of eyes can you have got?” said he. “Why, very good ones, Friend, as you may see.” “Yes, I perceive the clearness of the Ball; Pray, let me ask you: can you read at all?” “No, you great Blockhead; if I could, what need Of paying you for any Helps to Read?” And so he left the Maker in a Heat, Resolv'd to post him for an arrant Cheat. THE APE AND THE FOX. A FABLE. I Old Æsop so famous was certainiy right In the Way that he took to instruct and delight, By giving to Creatures, Beasts, Fishes, and Birds, Nay to Things, tho' inanimate, Language and Words. He engag'd by his Fables th' Attention of Youth, And forc'd even Fiction to tell them the Truth; II Not so quickly forgot, as the Mind is more able To retain a true Hint in the shape of a Fable; And Allusions to Nature insensibly raise The Reflection suggested by fabular Phrase, That affords less exception for Cavil to find, While the Moral more gently slides into the Mind. III Thus, to hint that a Kingdom will flourish the most, Where the Men in high Station are fit for their Post, And disgraces attend both on Person and Station, If Regard be not had to due Qualification, He invented, they tell us, this Fable of old, Which the Place I am in now requires to be told. IV The Beasts, on a Time, when the Lion was dead, Met together in Council to choose them a Head; And, to give to their new Constitution a Shape Most like to the human, they fix'd on the Ape; They crown'd, and proclaim'd him by Parliament Plan, And never was Monkey so like to a Man. V The Fox, being fam'd for his Cunning and Wit, Was propos'd to their Choicc, but they did not think fit To elect such a Sharper, lest, watching his Hour, He should cunningly creep into absolute Pow'r; No fear of King Ape, or of being so rid: He would mind his Diversion, and do as they did. VI Sly Reynard, on this, was resolv'd to expose Poor Pug, whom the Senate so formally chose; And having observ'd in his Rambles a Gin Where a delicate Morsel was nicely hung in, He let the King know what a Prize he had found, And the Waste, where it lay, was his Majesty's Ground. VII “Show me where,” said the Ape; so the Treasure was shown, Which he seiz'd with Paw Royal, to make it his own; But the Gin, at same time, was dispos'd to resist, And clapping together caught Pug by the Wrist, Who perceiv'd, by his Fingers laid fast in the Stocks, What a Trick had been play'd by his Subject the Fox. VIII “Thou Traitor!” said he, “but I'll make thee anon An Example of Vengeance”; and so he went on, With a Rage most Monarchical. Reynard, who ey'd The Success of his Scheme, gave a Sigh, and reply'd: “Well, adieu, Royal Sir! 'twas a cruel Mishap, That your Majesty's Grace did not understand Trap!” DULCES ANTE OMNIA MUSÆ. I Of all Companions that a Man can choose, Methinks the sweetest is an honest Muse, Ready, the subject proper and the Time, To cheer Occasion with harmonic Rime. Of all the Muses (for they tell of nine), Melpomene, sweet flowing Mel., be mine! II Her's the judicious and the friendly Part To clear the Head, to animate the Heart; Their kindred Forces, tempering, to unite; Grave to instruct, and witty to delight; With Judgment cool, with Passions rightly warm, She gives the Strength to Numbers and the Charm. III Her Lines, whatever the Occasion be, Flow without forcing, natural and free: No stiff'ning of 'em with poetic Starch, Whether her Bard is to be grave or arch: Of diff'rent Topics which the Times produce She prompts the fittest for the present Use IV She decks, when call'd, when honour'd to attend On sacred Piety, her best lov'd Friend, Decks with a Grace, and arms with a Defence, Religion, Virtue, Morals, and good Sense; Whatever tends to better human Mind Sets Mel. at Work, a Friend to all Mankind. V A Foe, but void of any Rancour, Foe To all the noisy Bustlings here below; To all Contention, Clamour, and Debate That plagues a Constitution, Church, or State, That plagues a Man's ownself, or makes him will His other Self, his Neighbour, any Ill. VI Life, as Mel. thinks, a short, uncertain Lease, Demands the fruits of Friendship, and of Peace. “Arms and the Man” her sister Clio sings; To her she leaves your Heroes and your Kings, To sound the Present, or to act the Past, And tread the Stage in Buskin and Bombast. VII With Nymphs and Swains fond Mel. would strew the Fields, With Flocks and Herds, instead of Spears and Shields; Recall the Scenes that blest a golden Age Ere mutual Love gave way to martial Rage; And Bards, high soaring above simpler Phrase, To genuine Light preferr'd the glaring Blaze. VIII She scorns alike ignobly to rehearse The spiteful Satire, or the venal Verse; Free in her Praise, and in her Censure too, But Merit, but Amendment, is her view; A rising worth still higher to exalt, Or save a Culprit from a future Fault. IX No sour, pedantical, abusive Rage, No vicious Rant defiles her freest Page; No vile, indecent Sally, or profane, To pleasure Fools, or give the Wise a Pain; Her Mirth is aim'd to mend us, if we heed, And what the chastest of her Sex may read. X She looks on various Empires, various Men, As all one Tribe, when she directs the Pen; She loves the Briton, and she loves the Gaul, Swede, Russ, or Turk,—she wishes well to all: They all are Men, all Sons of the same Sire, And must be all belov'd, if Mel. inspire. XI It would rejoice her Votaries to see All Europe, Asia, Africa agree; “But the New World, New-England's dire Alarms? “Should not Melpomene now sing to Arms?”— No, she must ever wish all War to cease; While Folks are fighting, she must hold her Peace; XII Content to hope that, what Events are due Will bless New-England, and old England too; Friend to fair Traders and free Navigation, And Friend to Spain, but Foe to Depredation; And Friend to France, but let heroic Clio Demolish French Encroachments at Ohio. XIII Safe from all foreign, and domestic Foes Be all your Liberties in Verse or Prose! Be safe Abroad your Colonies, your Trade, From Guarda-costas, and from Gasconade: At Home your Lives, your Acres and your Bags; And Plots against ye vanish all to Rags! XIV But much of Safety, let concluding Line Observe, depends upon yourselves;—in fine, Home, or Abroad, the World is but a School, Where all Things roll to teach one central Rule: That is: “If you would prosper and do well, Love one another, and remember Mel.” THE COUNTRY FELLOWS AND THE ASS. A FABLE. I A Country Fellow and his Son, they tell In modern Fables, had an Ass to sell. For this intent they turn'd it out to play, And fed so well, that by the destin'd Day They brought the Creature into sleek Repair, And drove it gently to a neighb'ring Fair. II As they were jogging on, a rural Class Was heard to say: “Look! Look there, at that Ass And those two Blockheads trudging on each Side, That have not, either of 'em, Sense to ride! Asses all Three!”—And thus the Country Folks On Man and Boy began to cut their Jokes. III Th' old Fellow minded nothing that they said, But ev'ry Word stuck in the young one's Head; And thus began their Comment thereupon: “Ne'er heed 'em Lad!” “Nay, Faither, do get on!” “Not I, indeed!”—“Why then, let me, I pray!” “Well, do; and see what prating Tongues will say!” IV The Boy was mounted; and they had not got Much further on, before another Knot, Just as the Ass was pacing by, pad, pad, Cried: “O! that lazy Looby of a Lad! How unconcernedly the gaping Brute Lets the poor aged Fellow walk afoot!” V Down came the Son on hearing this Account, And begg'd and pray'd, and made his Father mount; Till a third Party, on a further Stretch, “See! See,” exclaim'd, “that old hard-hearted Wretch! How like a Justice there he sits, or Squire, While the poor Lad keeps wading thro' the Mire!” VI “Stop!” cried the Lad, still deeper vexed in Mind, “Stop, Father, stop! let me get on behind!” Thus done, they thought they certainly should please, Escape Reproaches, and be both at Ease; For, having tried each practicable Way, What could be left for Jokers now to say? VII Still disappointed by succeeding Tone: “Hark ye, you Fellows! Is that Ass your own? Get off, for Shame, or one of you at least! You both deserve to carry the poor Beaft, Ready to drop down dead upon the Road, With such an huge, unconscionable Load!” VIII On this, they both dismounted and, some say, Contriv'd to carry, like a Truss of Hay, The Ass between 'em.—Prints, they add, are seen With Man and Lad, and slinging Ass between; Others omit that Fancy in the Print, As over-straining an ingenious Hint. IX The Copy that we follow says: the Man Rubb'd down the Ass, and took to his first Plan; Walk'd to the Fair, and sold him; got his Price, And gave his Son this pertinent Advice: “Let Talkers talk; stick thou to what is best: To think of pleasing all—is all a Jest.” “IN NOVA FERT ANIMUS MUTATAS DICERE FORMAS CORPORA.” —Ov. Metam., i. 1–2. Spoken on the Same Occasion. I. Pythagoras, an ancient Sage, opin'd That Form, and Shape were Indexes of Mind; And Minds of Men, when they departed hence, Would all be form'd according to this Sense; Some Animal, or human Shape again, Would shew the Minds of all the former Men. II. Let us adopt this Transmigration-plan, And mark, how Animal exhibits Man. Tyrants, for instance, (to begin with those Who make the greatest noise, the greatest woes) Of their Dominion Lions are the Key, That Reign in Deserts now, and hunt their Prey. Sometimes, dethron'd and brought upon a Stage, Or coop'd, like Bajazet, within a Cage, For Six-pence, safe from all tyrannic harms, One may see Kings, perhaps, at the King's Arms; See savage Monarchs, who had shown before The tusky Temper of the wildest Boar, Vested in proper Shape, when they are dead, Reviv'd, and caught, and shown at the Boar's Head. III. In some tam'd Elephant our Eyes may scan The once great, rich, o'ergrown, half-reas'ning Man. My Lord had Sense to wind into his Maw All within reach, that lay within the Law; What would have fed a thousand Mouths was sunk, To fill his own, by hugeous length of Trunk; He grew to monstrous Grandeur, liv'd a Show, And Stones high rais'd told where he was laid low: By Transmigration it appears, at least, That such great Man is really a great Beast. IV. From Animals that once were Men, to pass To Men of now almost ambiguous Class: Players, and Harlequins, and Pantomimes, Who sell their Shapes to mimick Men and Times, With all the servile, second-handed Tribe Of Imitators, endless to describe,— In their own Figures, when they come to range, With small Transition into Monkeys change: For now Men-Monkeys have not in their view What should be done by Men, but what they do. V. Of Tempers, by inferior Forms express'd, And seen for nothing, something may be guess'd. When the sly Fox ensnares the silly Geese, Who does not see that Mind is of a piece With former Lawyers, who devour'd by far The sillier Clients, drawn into the Bar? VI. “Why not Physicians?” hear the Lawyer say; “Are not they too as wily in their way?” Why, yes, dear Barrister; but then they own The Shapes in which their cunning Arts are shown: Serpents confess, around the Rod entwin'd, Wily or wise the Æsculapian kind. VII. “Why not Divines?” the Doctor may object; “They have Devourers, too, in ev'ry Sect.” True; but if one devour, there is for him A Transmigration more upon the grim: In human Shape when he has spent his Years, Stript of Sheep's Clothing, real Wolf appears. VIII. Plain in four-footed Animals, let's try Instance that first occurs in such as fly. The Parrot shews by its unmeaning prate Full many a Talker's metamorphos'd Fate; Whose Tongue outstrips the Clapper of a Mill, And still keeps saying the same nothing still. As full the City, and as full the Court, As India's Woods with Creatures of this sort. If rightly the gay-feather'd Bird foretells The future Shape of eloquenter Belles Or Beaux, transmigrated, the human Dolls Will talk, and shine caress'd in “pretty Polls.” IX. Belles you may see pursue a Butterfly With painted Wings, that flutter in the Sky And, sparkling, to the Solar Rays unfold Red mix'd with purple, green with shining Gold. Nor wonder at the fond Pursuit; for know That this same Butterfly was once a Beau And, dress'd according to the newest Whim, Ran after them, as they run after him. X. Footed or flying, all decipher Men;— Enough to add one other Instance, then: One from a Courtier, a creeping Thing; He takes new Colours, as there comes new King; Lives upon airy Promises, and dies; His Transmigration can be no surprise: Chameleon-shape by that he comes to share, Still changes Colours, and still feeds on Air. XI. By his ingenious Fiction, in the End, What could the wise Pythagoras intend? Too wise a Man not to intend a Clue To change, hereafter, literally true. The Solar System of our boasted Age Was known of old to this enlightned Sage; So might his Thoughts on Man's immortal Soul, Howe'er express'd, be right upon the whole: He meant, one need not scruple to affirm, This real Truth by Transmigration Term. XII. Our Tempers here must point to the degree In which hereafter we design to be. From Vice in Minds, undoubtedly, will grow More ugly Shapes than any here below; But sacred Virtue, Piety, and Love— What beauteous Forms will they produce above! VERSES Intended to have been Spoken at the Breaking-up of the Free Grammar School in Manchester, in the year 1748, when Lauder's charge of Plagiarism upon Milton engaged the Public Attention. THE MASTER'S SPEECH. I Our worthy Founder, Gentlemen, this Day Orders the Youth an Hour's poetic Play,— Me, on its annual Return, to choose One single Subject for their various Muse, That you may see how Fancy will create Her diff'rent Image in each Youngster's Pate. II Now, since our Milton, a renownèd Name, Had been attack'd for stealing into Fame; I told 'em: “Lads, now be upon your Guard; Exert yourselves, and save your famous Bard! He's call'd a Plagiary: 'tis your's to show The vain Reproach, and silence Milton's Foe. III “The Point,” said I, “at which ye now take Aim, Remember, as ye rime, is Milton's Fame,— Fame as a Poet only, as attack'd For plund'ring Verses. Ne'er contest the Fact; Defend your Bard, tho' granted; and confine To three times six, at most, your eager Line.” IV Then lend a fav'ring Ear, whilst they rehearse Short and almost extemporary Verse; A Thought work'd up, that came into the Mind, With Rimes the first and fittest they could find. Such was their Task. The Boys have done their best; Take what you like, Sirs; and excuse the rest. FIRST LAD. I Milton pursu'd, in Numbers more sublime, Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rime. 'Tis said: “The Bard did but pretend to soar; For such and such attempted them before.” II 'Tis now an Age ago since Milton writ: The rest are sunk into Oblivion's Pit; A Critic diving to their Wrecks, perhaps, Has, now and then, brought up some loosen'd Scraps. III We'll not dispute the Value of them now, But say one Thing which Critics must allow, Which all the Nations round us will confess: “Milton alone—attempted with Success.” SECOND LAD. I When Milton's Ghost into Elysium came To mix with Claimants for poetic Fame, Some rose, the celebrated Bard to meet, Welcom'd, and laid their Laurels at his Feet. II “Immortal Shades,” said he, “if aught be due To my Attempts, 'tis owing all to you,” Then took the Laurels, fresh'ning from his Hand, And crown'd the Temples of the sacred Band. III Others, in Crowds, stood muttering behind; “Who is the Guest? He looks as he were blind;— O! this is Milton, to be sure, the Man That stole from others all his rimeless Plan;— IV From those conceited Gentleman, perchance, That rush to hail him with such Complaisánce. Ay, that's the Reason of this fawning Fuss. I like him not,—he never stole from us.” THIRD LAD. I “Crime in a Poet, Sirs, to steal a Thought?” No, that 'tis not, if it be good for aught. 'Tis lawful Theft; 'tis laudable to boot; 'Tis want of Genius if he does not do't. The Fool admires, the Man of Sense alone Lights on a happy Thought, and makes it all his own; II Flies, like a Bee, along the Muses' Field, Peeps in, and tastes what any Flow'r can yield,— Free, from the various Blossoms that he meets To pick, and cull, and carry Home the Sweets; While, saunt'ring out, the heavy, stingless Drone Amidst a thousand Sweets makes none of 'em his own. FOURTH LAD. I A Critic once to a Miltonian made Of Milton's Plagiarisms a long Parade, To prove his Work not owing to his Genius, But to Adamus Exul and Masenius; That he had stol'n the greater Part by much, Both of his Plan and Matter from the Dutch; II “His Abdiel, his fine Charactérs, he took, And heav'nly Scenes, from such and such a Book; His hellish, too, the same; from such a one, He stole his Pandemonium,—and so on;— Till Milton's Friend cry'd out, at last, quite giddy: “Poh! hold thy Tongue! he stole the Devil, did he?” FIFTH LAD. I When Oxford saw in her Radclivian Dome Greek skill and Roman rivall'd here at Home, Wond'ring she stood, till one judicious Spark Address'd the Crowd, and made this sage Remark: “The most unlicens'd Plagiary, this Gibbs! Nothing in all his Pile, but what he cribs! II “The Ground he builds upon is not his own; I know the Quarry whence he had his Stone; The Forest, too, where all his Timber grow'd; The Forge wherein his fusèd Metals flow'd;— In short, survey the Edifice entire, 'Tis all a borrow'd Work, from Base to Spire.” III Thus with our Epic Architect he deals, Who says that Milton in his Poem steals;— “Steals” if he will; but “without Licence?” no! Pedlars in Verse unmeaningly do so: Him Phœbus licens'd, and the Muses Nine Help'd the rare Thief to raise up—a Design. SIXTH LAD. I Lauder! thy Authors Dutch and German There is no need to disinter, Man! To search the mould'ring Anecdote For Source of all that Milton wrote. We'll own, from these, and many more, The Bard enrich'd his ample Store. II Phœbus himself could not escape The Tricks of this poetic Ape: For, to complete his daring Vole, From his enliven'd Wheels he stole, Prometheus-like, the Solar Ray That animated all his Clay. III Prometheus-like, then, chain him down; Prey on his Vitals of Renown; With critic Talons, and with Beak, Upon his Fame thy Vengeance wreak: It grows again, at ev'ry Hour, Fast as the Vulture can devour. SEVENTH LAD. I Miltonum Vir, O facinus nefarium! Exagitavit tanquam Plagiarium. Miramur, hanc qui protulisset Thesin, Quid esse, Momus, crederet Poësin. Num, quæso, vult ut, hâc obstetricante, Dicendum sit quod nemo dixit ante? II O admirandam hominis versuti Calliditatem, quâ volebat uti! Dixisset ipse, nimium securus, Quod nemo dicet præsens aut futurus, Dum Felis ungues persequentur murem Miltonum, scilicet, fuisse Furem. III Exulent ergo, (ejus ex Effatis) Quicunque Nomen usurparint Vatis; Nullum vocemus prorsus ad Examen Eorum Sensum, Vim, aut Modulamen: Furantur omnes;—habeamus verum Poetam, exhinc, unicum Lauderum! THE NIMMERS. Two Foot-companions once in deep Discourse,— “Tom,” says the one, “let's go and steal a Horse!” “Steal!” says the other, in a huge surprise, “He that says I'm a Thief, I say he lies.” “Well, well,” replied his Friend, “no such affront; I did but ask ye: if you won't, you won't.” So they jogg'd on, till, in another Strain, The Querist mov'd to honest Tom again. “Suppose,” says he, “for Supposition's sake,— 'Tis but a Supposition that I make,— Suppose that we should filch a Horse, I say?” “Filch! Filch!” quoth Tom, demurring by the Way; “That's not so bad as downright Theft, I own; But—yet—methinks—'twere better let alone. It soundeth something pitiful, and low; Shall we go filch a Horse, you say? why, no; I'll filch no filching; and I'll tell no lie; Honesty's the best Policy, say I.” Struck with such vast Integrity quite dumb, His Comrade paus'd; at last, says he: “Come, come! Thou art an honest Fellow, I agree,— Honest and poor; alas! that should not be, And dry into the Bargain, and no Drink! Shall we go Nim a Horse, Tom?—What dost think?” How clear Things are when Liquor's in the Case! Tom answers quick, with casuistic Grace: “Nim? yes, yes, yes, lets Nim with all my Heart; I see no harm in Nimming, for my Part. Hard is the Case, now I look sharp into't, That Honesty should trudge i'th' Dirt afoot; So many empty Horses round about, That Honesty should wear its Bottoms out! Besides, shall Honesty be chok'd with Thirst? Were it my Lord Mayor's Horse, I'd nim it first! And, by the by, my Lad, no scrubby Tit! There is the best that ever wore a Bit Not far from hence.” “I take ye,” quoth his Friend, “Is not yon Stable, Tom, our Journey's End?” Good Wits will jump: both meant the very Steed, The Top o'th' Country, both for Shape and Speed. So to't they went, and, with an Halter round His feather'd Neck, they nimm'd him off the Ground. And now, good People, we should next relate Of these Adventurers the luckless Fate. Poor Tom!—but here the Sequel is to seek, Not being yet translated from the Greek. Some say, that Tom would honestly have peacht, But by his blabbing Friend was over-reacht; Others insist upon't, that both the Elves Were, in like Manner, halter-nimm'd themselves. It matters not:—the Moral is the Thing, For which our purpose, Neighbours, was to sing. If it should hit some few amongst the Throng, Let 'em not lay the Fault upon the Song! Fair warning, all: He that has got a Cap, Now put it on, or else beware a Rap! 'Tis but a short one, it is true, but yet Has a long reach with it, Videlicet: 'Twixt right and wrong, how many gentle Trimmers Will neither steal nor filch, but will be plaguy Nimmers. THE POND. “At qui tantuli eget, quanto est opus, is neque Limo Turbatam transit aquam, neque vitam amittit in Undis” Hor. Sat. I., i. 59-60. Once on a Time a certain Man was found That had a Pond of Water in his Ground,— A fine large Pond of Water fresh and clear, Enough to serve his Turn for many a Year. Yet, so it was, a strange, unhappy Dread Of wanting Water seiz'd the Fellow's Head. When he was dry, he was afraid to drink Too much at once, for fear his Pond should sink. Perpetually tormented with this Thought, He never ventur'd on a hearty Draught; Still dry, still fearing to exhaust his Store, When half-refresh'd, he frugally gave o'er; Reviving, of himself reviv'd his Fright: “Better,” quoth he, “to be half-chok'd than quite.” Upon his Pond continually intent, In Cares and Pains his anxious Life he spent, Consuming all his Time and Strength away, To make the Pond rise higher ev'ry Day. He work'd and slav'd, and oh! how slow it fills! Pour'd in by Pail-fuls, and took out—by Gills. In a wet Season, he would skip about, Placing his Buckets under ev'ry Spout; From falling Show'rs collecting fresh Supply, And grudging ev'ry Cloud that passèd by; Cursing the dryness of the Times each Hour, Altho' it rain'd as fast as it could pour. Then he would wade thro' ev'ry dirty Spot, Where any little Moisture could be got; And when he had done draining of a Bog, Still kept himself as dirty as a Hog; And cried whene'er Folks blam'd him: ‘What d'ye mean? It costs a World of Water to be clean!” If some poor Neighbour crav'd to slake his Thirst, “What!—rob my Pond? I'll see the Rogue hang'd first! A burning Shame, these Vermin of the Poor Should creep unpunish'd thus about my Door! As if I had not Frogs and Toads enow, That suck my Pond, whatever I can do!” The Sun still found him, as he rose or set, Always in quest of Matters that were wet; Betimes he rose to sweep the Morning Dew, And rested late to catch the Ev'ning too. With Soughs and Troughs he labour'd to enrich The rising Pond from ev'ry neighb'ring Ditch; With Soughs, and Troughs, and Pipes, and Cuts, and Sluices, From growing Plants he drain'd the very Juices; Made ev'ry Stick of Wood upon the Hedges Of good Behaviour to deposit Pledges; By some Conveyance or another still Devis'd Recruits from each declining Hill; He left, in short, for this beloved Plunder, No Stone unturn'd that could have Water under. Sometimes, when forc'd to quit his awkward Toil And, sore against his Will, to rest a while, Then straight he took his Book, and down he sat To calculate th' Expenses he was at: How much he suffer'd, at a mod'rate Guess, From all those Ways by which the Pond grew less. For, as to those by which it still grew bigger, For them he reckon'd not a single Figure: He knew a wise old Saying, which maintain'd That 'twas bad Luck to count what one had gain'd. “First, for my Self, my daily Charges here Cost a prodigious Quantity a Year; Altho', thank Heaven, I never boil my Meat, Nor am I such a Sinner as to sweat. But Things are come to such a Pass, indeed, We spend ten Times the Water that we need. People are grown with washing, cleansing, rinsing, So finical and nice, past all convincing; So many proud, fantastic Modes, in short, Are introduc'd, that my poor Pond pays for't. “Not but I could be well enough content With what upon my own Account is spent; But those large Articles from whence I reap No Kind of Profit, strike me on a Heap. What a vast deal each Moment at a sup, This ever thirsty Earth itself drinks up! Such Holes and Gaps! Alas! my Pond provides Scarce for its own unconscionable Sides. Nay, how can one imagine it should thrive, So many Creatures as it keeps alive, That creep from ev'ry Nook and Corner, marry! Filching as much, as ever they can carry. Then, all the Birds that fly along the Air 'Light at my Pond, and come in for a Share. Item, at ev'ry Puff of Wind that blows, Away at once the Surface of it goes; The rest, in Exhalations to the Sun: One Month's fair Weather, and I am undone!” This Life he led for many a Year together, Grew old and grey in watching of his Weather, Meagre as Death itself, till this same Death Stopt, as the saying is, his vital Breath. For as th' old Fool was carrying to his Field A heavier Burden than he well could wield, He miss'd his Footing, or somehow he fumbled In tumbling of it in,—but in he tumbled. Mighty desirous to get out again, He scream'd, and scrambled, but 'twas all in vain; The Place was grown so very deep and wide, Nor Bottom of it could he feel, nor Side: And so—i'th' Middle of his Pond—he died. What think ye now from this imperfect Sketch, My Friends, of such a miserable Wretch?— “Why, 'tis a Wretch, we think, of your own making. No Fool can be suppos'd in such a taking; Your own warm Fancy”—Nay, but warm or cool, The World abounds with many such a Fool. The choicest Ills, the greatest Torments, sure, Are those which Numbers labour to endure. “What? For a Pond?”—Why, call it an Estate: You change the Name, but realise the Fate. ON INOCULATION. Written when it first began to be practised in England. I I heard two Neighbours talk, the other Night, About this new Distemper-giving Plan, Which some so wrong, and others think so right; Short was the Dialogue, and thus it ran: II “If I had twenty Children of my own, I would inoculate them ev'ry one.”— “Ay, but should any of them die, what Moan Would then be made for vent'ring thereupon!” III “No; I should think that I had done the best, And be resign'd, whatever should befall.”— “But could you really be so quite at Rest?” “I could.”—“Then, why inoculate at all? IV “Since, to resign a Child to God, Who gave, Is full as easy, and as just a Part, When sick and led by Nature to the Grave, As when in Health, and driv'n to it by Art.” MINCE-PIE. Comical Sir, The answer I give, Shall be 'firmative, So get ready your platter; For my tutor and I Shall come to your pie Without mincing the matter. Yours, J. B. DRINK. You ask me, friend, what cause can be assigned For all the various humours of mankind; Whence, in opinions, tempers, manners, mien, Thought, speech and act, such diff'rence should be seen? Why, in one word to tell you what I think: The cause of all these various things is — Drink! Ay, you may laugh; but, if it may suffice In men and manners to believe one's eyes, Drink, I do say it, is the subtle matter That makes in human engines such a clatter That gives account mechanical and true Why men from men should differ as they do, Account of ev'ry passion, system, strife,— In short, of all the incidents of life. For what is life? Life, as a man may say Is but the moisture of the human clay, That holds the soul united to its tether, And keeps the dusty particles together. Cantábs, they say, Oxonian bards outshine, That is, in other words, have better wine; Change but the liquor, and, you'll see Cantábs Will be the minnows, Oxford men the dabs. Why do the doctors, in consumptive cases, Advise in better air to wash our faces? Do not the doctors know, who thus prescribe, That air's the liquor which our lungs imbibe? Well the sagacious health-smiths point the way To stir life's fire and make the bellows play; The tainted lobe, regaled with fresher dew, Heaves and ferments the dregs of life anew, And, with fresh dew fermenting thus his dregs, A man once more is set upon his legs; He that before was down among the dumps, Looks up again, again bestirs his stumps, Pays off the doctor, and begins to think What place will yield him fittest air to drink. When our distempers did their names receive, (One instance more, good doctors, by your leave,) Some chronic matters, such as gout and stone, That would the force of no arcana own, To save their credit, these, the learned dons Cried out, were fix'd hereditary ones: If a man's father, grand-or great-grand sire Had had the same, 'twas needless to enquire; Plain was the case, and safe the doctor's fame; The poor old ancesters bore all the blame. Now, I'll appeal to common sense and you, If such a flam as this can e'er be true? Judge if our thesis does not solve such failings Better than twenty Hippocrates' or Galens. Let these old gentlemen say what they please, 'Tis the same drink creates the same disease: The same bad milk which through two children passes, May send 'em both in time to that of asses; If one survives the other for a season, 'Tis intermediate drinking is the reason. Father and son did one consumption strike? Truth is, they drank consumedly alike. What wonder is't, if when relations hap Oft to claim kindred by the self-same tap, That he who like his father topes about Should, like his father, suffer from the gout? Causes alike alike effects impart; Then, what occasion for new terms of art, “Stamens,” and “embryos,” and “animalcules,” And suchlike fixed hereditary calcules? It is so hardly to be understood That all men's toes are made of flesh and blood. In grave Divinity should it be sung How diff'rent sects from diff'rent drinkings sprung, You'll find, if once you enter on the theme, Religion various, but the cause the same. Now, therefore, Calvin's meagre jaws compare With Luther's count'nance, ruddy, plump and fair; Imagine them alive, and tell me whether These godly heroes ever drank together? If not, according to our present system, We may of course in diff'rent parties list 'em. England indeed preserved the happy mean Betwixt the fat Reformer and the lean; And yet, in England, num'rous sects prevail, Such is its great variety of ale. Hence Presbyterians, Independents, Quakers, And such-like prim salvation-undertakers; Hence Anabaptists, Seekers and what-nots, Who doubtless suck in schism with their pots. Were't not for this, the whole fanatic fry Might come to church as well as you and I. Who can believe that organs and a steeple Should give offence to any Christian people? Does reason, think ye, tell these righteous folks That sin's in gowns and purity in cloaks? Or do their saints, by gospel truth's command, Reject the surplice and receive the band? No, no! 'tis Drink that makes the men so fickle ('Tis Drink that builds the sep'rate conventícle) Form to themselves a thousand diff'rent shams, Which they call scruples, but, I say, are drams. THE WOODEN HORSE. Old Troy was a town of high renown, As we [read] in ancient story. Would you hear how it was quite turned to Greece, Attend and I'll lay 't before ye. The Greeks they say At that time of day Were folks of their own opinion. Now, these Greeks they did boast That Troy town they would roast, As a man would roast an onion. Many tricks had been tried By the Greeks, on which side To obtain the command of the town;— But to make a short tale, They came off with a fall, And their [?] all fell down. UPROUSE YE, THEN. Ye men that came from Brazen Nose Into Bridgnorth upon your toes, Pray, on your beds no longer lie, If you would see fair Shrewsbury. THE STATUE IN CHEAPSIDE. Be easy, citizens, about the statue; Nor mind this noisy fellow's hideous din. What need you wonder at his bawling at you, When he's employed, you say, to rail it in. LINES TO STEPHEN DUCK. Dear Duck. This comes to wish thee joy of thy good luck, Thy yearly pension and thy country-seat, So well bestowed upon thee by the great. Thy verses, which have come to Lancashire, We read, and we commend, and we admire In heart a thousand and a thousand times. We thank thee, Stephen, for thy honest rhymes, Wherein thou shew'st a native genius bright, And poetry upon its legs set right, Which others with their vicious works and scurvy Mostly endeavour to turn topsy-turvey: Rare poets, truly! who in Christian times Can sanctify the foulest pagan crimes; Can from a Cæsar's or a Cato's tomb Revive the old rascalities of Rome; Preposterous Wits! that labour to set forth A vain ambitious rebel Tyrant's worth, Or canonise a sour self-murd'rer's pride, And make a hero of a suicide! Stephen, I vow it were a better thing For such as them to thresh, and such as thee to sing! FATHER JERDAN. One Father Jerdan once bestowed a gun Upon a poor man passing through the town. The poor man straight into an ale-house went And, having sold the gun, the money spent: To whom the Father answer'd in this fashion: “I'd rather lose my coat than my compassion.” A LADY'S LOVE. A lady's love is like a candle-snuff, That's quite extinguish'd by a gentle puff; But, with a hearty blast or two, the dame, Just like a candle, bursts into a flame. ON THE WHIG WORKHOUSE BILL. I “This Manchester affair, at last,” Says Plumptre, visiting Sir Harry, “When we all hoped it should have passed, Plague on't! has happened to miscarry!”— II “Why then, Sir Robert, I must say, Has used as ill,” replies the Knight. “What! When he might have gained the day. Sneak off and leave us! Was that right?”— III “Why, people said, it was a job,” Says Plumptre — as indeed it was! “And so, on second thoughts Sir Bob Could not in conscience let it pass.”— IV “Conscience!” replies Sir Harry, still Angered the more at such expressions; “He makes a conscience of my Bill! I'm sure I voted for ? When at the Common's bar Byrom, the Doctor, stood And told of matters what he could, Plumptre stood up, and said with front severe: “Pray, let me ask, how came you here?”— “How came I here?” thought he; “how came I hither?”— “You must say something!”—“Why, Sir I walked thither.”— “Walked thither, Sir! Pray, speak to my intention: What right claim'd you to be at that convention?”— “What right? Why, Sir, the right of every man To do his neighbour service where he can. Pray, did the persons there advance a claim Present to be in any but that same? I would not injure, sir, nor yet define The rights of others; but this claim is mine.” Thus it appears, that questions put at random Were answered right. Quod erat demonstrandum. ON SPECIOUS AND SUPERFICIAL WRITERS. How rare the Case, tho' common the Pretence, To write on Subjects from a real Sense! 'Tis many a celebrated Author's Fate To print Effusions just as Parrots prate. He moulds a Matter that he once was taught, In various shapes, and thinks it to be Thought. Words at Command he marshals in Array, And proves whatever he is pleas'd to say; While Learning like a Torrent pours along, And sweeps away the Subject, right or wrong, One follows for a while a rolling Theme, Toss'd in the middle of the rapid Stream, Till out of Sight, with like impetuous Force Torn from its Roots, another takes the Course; While Froth and Bubble glaze the flowing Mud, And the Man thinks all clear and understood. A shining Surface, and a transient View, Makes the slight-witted Reader think so too. It entertains him, and the Book is bought, Read, and admir'd without Expense of Thought; No Tax impos'd upon his Wits, his Cash Paid without Scruple, he enjoys the Trash. THE PASSIVE PARTICIPLE'S PETITION TO THE PRINTER OF THE GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE. I Urban, or Sylvan, or whatever Name Delight thee most, thou foremost in the Fame Of Magazining Chiefs, whose rival Page With monthly Medley courts the curious Age,— Hear a poor Passive Participle's Case, And, if thou can'st, restore me to my Place! II Till just of late, good English has thought fit To call me written, or to call me writ. But what is writ or written, by the vote Of Writers now, hereafter must be wrote; And what is spoken, too, hereafter spoke; And Measures, never to be broken, broke. III I never could be driven; but, in spite Of Grammar, they have drove me from my Right. None could have risen to become my Foes; But what a World of Enemies have rose! Who have not gone, but they have went about; And, torn as I have been, have tore me out. IV Passive I am, and would be; and implore That such Abuse may be henceforth forbore,— If not forborne; for, by all Spelling-book, If not mistaken, they are all mistook; And, in plain English, it had been as well If what has fall'n upon me, had not fell. V Since this Attack upon me has began, Who knows what Lengths in Language may be ran? For, if it once be grew into a Law, You'll see such Work as never has been saw; Part of our Speech, and Sense, perhaps, beside, Shakes when I'm shook, and dies when I am died. VI Then, let the Præter and Imperfect Tense Of my own words to me remit the Sense; Or, since we two are oft enough agreed, Let all the learnèd take some better heed, And leave the vulgar to confound the due Of Præter. tense, and Participle, too! FROM A GENTLEMAN TO HIS BARBER. THREE FRAGMENTS. Fragment I. O thomas, did you see my Beard, So long, so white, and eke so hard, Which thus afflicts a suffering Sinner, You would ere now have sent a Trimmer. Fragment II. Thomas, I hope this short Epistle, Will serve the purpose of a Whistle, And bring you hither in a Minute, When you shall see what's written in it. Fragment III. From under my Lime-Tree, May 23rd, 1736. Thomas, Methinks, 'tis wondrous strange How some Folks' constitutions change! When I was young, and went to School, I thought a poet a stark fool. As I grew up a taller Lad, I bolder grew, and thought him mad, And ne'er vouchsaf'd to read one once;— So, left the School, and turn'd out Dunce; And, thus equipp'd, from them was hurl'd Into a noisy, bustling World, Where in no time, nor in no Season, I e'er could meet with Rime or reason. THE BEAU AND THE BEDLAMITE. I A patient in Bedlam that did pretty well, Was permitted sometimes to go out of his Cell. One Day, when they gave him that Freedom, he spied A beauish young Spark with a Sword by his Side With an huge Silver Hilt, and a Scabbard for Steel, That swung at due Length from his Hip to his Heel. II When he saw him advance on the Gallery Ground, The Bedlamite ran, and survey'd him all round; While a Waiter suppress'd the young Captain's Alarm With: “You need not to fear, Sir, he'll do you no Harm.” At the last he broke out: “Aye, a very fine Show! May I ask him one Question?” “What's that?” said the Beau. III “Pray, what is that long, dangling, cumbersome Thing, That you seem to be tied to with Riband and String?” “Why, that is my Sword.” “And what is it to do?” “Kill my Enemies, Master, by running them thro'.” “Kill your Enemies? Kill a Fool's Head of your own! They'll die of themselves, if you'll let them alone.” ST. PHILIP NERI AND THE YOUTH. Saint Philip Neri, as old Readings say, Met a young Stranger in Rome's Streets one Day; And, being ever courteously inclin'd To give young Folks a sober Turn of Mind, He fell into Discourse with him; and thus The Dialogue they held comes down to us.— St. “Tell me what brings you, gentle Youth, to Rome?” Y. “To make myself a Scholar, Sir, I come.” St. “And, when you are come, what do you intend?” Y. “To be a Priest, I hope, Sir, in the End.” St. “Suppose it so,—what have you next in view?” Y. “That I may get to be a Canon, too.” St. “Well; and how then?” Y. “Why then, for aught I know, I may be made a Bishop.” St. “Be it so;— What then?” Y. “Why, Cardinal's a high degree, And yet my Lot it possibly may be.” St. “Suppose it was,—what then?” Y. “Why, who can say But I've a Chance for being Pope one Day?” St. “Well, having worn the Mitre, and red Hat, And triple Crown,—what follows after that?” Y. “Nay, there is Nothing further, to be sure, Upon this Earth, that Wishing can procure. When I've enjoy'd a Dignity so high As long as God shall please, then—I must die.” St. “What! ‘Must’ you die, fond Youth, and, at the best, But wish and hope, and ‘may be’ all the rest? Take my Advice: whatever may betide, For that which must be first of all provide; Then think of that which may be; and indeed, When well-prepar'd, who knows what may succeed, But you may be, as you are pleas'd to hope, Priest, Canon, Bishop, Cardinal, and Pope?” MOSES' VISION. Moses, to whom, by a peculiar Grace, God spake (the Hebrew Phrase is) “Face to Face,” Call'd by an Heav'nly Voice, the Rabbins say, Ascended to a Mountain's Top one Day; Where, in some Points perplex'd, his Mind was eas'd, And Doubts concerning Providence appeas'd. During the Colloquy Divine, say they, The Prophet was commanded to survey And mark what happen'd on the Plain below. There he perceiv'd a fine, clear Spring to flow Just at the Mountain's Foot, to which, anon, A Soldier on his Road came riding on; Who, taking Notice of the Fountain, stopt, Alighted, drank, and, in remounting, dropt A Purse of Gold; but, as the precious Load Fell unsuspected, he pursued his Road. Scarce had he gone, when a young Lad came by, And, as the Purse lay just before his Eye, He took it up, and, finding its Content, Secur'd the Treasure, and away he went. Soon after him a poor, infirm old Man, With Age and Travel weary quite and wan, Came to the Spring to quench his Thirst, and drank, And then sat down to rest him on the Bank. There while he sat, the Soldier on his Track, Missing his Gold, return'd directly back; Lit off his Horse, began to swear and curse, And ask'd the poor old Fellow for his Purse. He solemnly protested, o'er and o'er, With Hands and Eyes uplifted to implore Heav'ns Attestation to the Truth, that he Nor Purse nor Gold had ever chanc'd to see;— But all in vain; the Man believ'd him not, And drew his Sword, and stabb'd him on the spot. Moses, with Horror and Amazement seiz'd, Fell on his Face. T he Voice Divine was pleas'd To give the Prophet's anxious Mind Relief, And thus prevent expostulating Grief: “Be not surpris'd, nor ask how such a Deed The World's Just Judge could suffer to succeed. The Child has caus'd the Passion, it is true, That made the Soldier run the old Man thro'; But know one Fact, tho' never yet found out, And judge how that would banish ev'ry Doubt: This same old Man, thro' Passion once as wild, Murder'd the Father of that very Child.” THE CENTAUR FABULOUS. I Zeuxis of old a Female Centaur drew, To show his Art, and then expos'd to View. The human Half with so exact a Care Was join'd to Limbs of a Thessalian Mare, That, seeing from a different Point the Piece, Some prais'd the Maid, and some the Mare, of Greece. II Like to this Centaur, by his own Relation, Is Doctor Warburton's Divine Legation; Which superficial Writers, on each Hand,— Christians and Deists,—did not understand; Because they both observ'd from partial Views Th' incorporated Church and State of Jews. III Th' ingenious Artist took the pains to draw, Full and entire, the Compound of the Law; The two Societies, the civil Kind And the religious, perfectly combin'd; With God Almighty, as a Temp'ral Prince, Governing both, as all his Proofs evince, IV Without the Doctrine of a future State.— Here with Opponents lies the main Debate. They cannot reconcile to serious Thought God's Church and State, with Life to come untaught; With Law or Gospel cannot make to suit Virgin of Sion sinking down to Brute. V Zeuxis the new, they argue, takes a Pride In Shapes so incompatible allied; And talks away, as if he had portray'd A real Creature, mixt of Mare and Maid. All who deny th' Existence of the Pad, He centaurises into Fool and Mad. VI If one objected to a Maiden Hoof,— “Why, 'tis an Animal,” was all his Proof; If to an Animal with human Head,— “Oh! 'Tis a beauteous Woman,” Zeuxis said. “What! Animal and Woman both at once?” “Yes; that's essential to the whole, ye Dunce.” VII His primary and secondary Sense, Like Mare and Maid, support his fond Pretence: From joining-spot he skips to each Extreme, Or strides to both, and guards the motley Scheme; Solving with like centauriformal Ease Law, Prophets, Gospel, quoted as you please.— VIII Thus both went on, long-labour'd Volumes thro'.— Now, what must fair, impartial Readers do? Must they not grieve, if either of them treat On Law or Grace with Rudeness or with Heat? Of either Zeuxis they allow the skill, But that—the Centaur is a Fable still. THOUGHTS ON THE CONSTITUTION OF HUMAN NATURE, AS REPRESENTED IN THE SYSTEMS OF MODERN PHILOSOPHERS. I Strong Passions draw, like Horses that are strong, The Body-Coach of Flesh and Blood along; While subtle Reason, with each Rein in Hand, Sits on the Box, and has them at Command; Rais'd up aloft, to see and to be seen, Judges the Track, and guides the gay Machine. II But was it made for nothing else beside Passions to draw, and Reason to be Guide? Was so much Art employ'd to drag and drive Nothing within the Vehicle alive? No seated Mind, that claims the moving Pew, Master of Passions, and of Reason too? III The grand Contrivance why so well equip With strength of Passions, rul'd by Reason's Whip? Vainly profuse had Apparatus been, Did not a reigning Spirit rest within; Which Passions carry, and sound Reason means To render present at pre-order'd Scenes. IV They who are loud in human Reason's Praise, And celebrate the Drivers of our Days, Seem to suppose, by their continual Bawl, That Passions, Reason, and Machine, is all; To them the Windows are drawn up, and clear Nothing that does not outwardly appear. V Matter and Motion, and superior Man By Head and Shoulders, form their reas'ning Plan. View'd and demurely ponder'd, as they roll, And scoring Traces on the Paper Soul, Blank, shaven white, they fill th' unfurnish'd Pate With new Idéas, none of them innate. VI When these Adepts are got upon a Box, Away they gallop thro' the gazing Flocks; Trappings admir'd, and the high-mettl'd Brute And Reason balancing its either Foot; While seeing Eyes discern, at their Approach, Fulness of Skill, and emptiness of Coach. VII 'Tis very well that lively Passions draw, That sober Reason keeps them all in Awe,— The one to run, the other to control, And drive directly to the destin'd Goal. “What Goal?”—Ay, there the Question should begin: What Spirit drives the willing Mind within? VIII Sense, Reason, Passions, and the like, are still One self-same Man, whose Action is his Will; Whose Will, if right, will soon renounce the Pride Of an own Reason for an only Guide; As God's unerring Spirit shall inspire, Will still direct the Drift of his Desire. TO R. L., ESQUIRE, On his Sending the Author a Hare, according to an Annual Custom. I What! another Hare, Peter? Well, so much the better! I acknowledge myself to be doubly your Debtor; Should ha' thank'd you indeed for the last afore now, But the Forelock of Time has been short, of somehow. I hope you won't take it, Sir, as an Affront; 'Twas an excellent good one, for what there was on't. But since by your Favour here two at a Time, Let that be for Sense, and this other for Rime. II Indeed, when old Jackson, your Namesake and Neighbour, Had brought what you call'd there “the Fruits of your Labour,— Of a whole Day's whole Labour:” so labour'd the Mountain, (Thought I), and when got to the End of her Counting, While the Neighbours all round her, with Wonder struck dumb, Stood to see what huge Monster was coming to come, At last, and with much ado, brought forth a Hero, When drest, would have made much the same Bill of Fare-o! III Not that I lik'd your Present one Penny the worse! No, if you think so, you are out of your Course. Your Intention had had the same Courtesy in't, if The Fruits of your Labour were ne'er so dimin'tive; Nor should I have fail'd of my Thanks, if old Jackson Had not told me that he was oblig'd to go back soon. I began once to write, but I could not proceed in't, And indeed, as it happens, 'tis well that I didn't. IV Had I answer'd your Minor, perhaps 'tis a Wager Whether ever or no I had heard of your Major; But now, having laid down your Premises twain, The Conclusion is good, and the Consequence plain. For, as old Aristotle said, some Time agone, Two Hens and two Bacons are better than one: Second Hares are the best, as a Body may say. D'ye take, Sir, the Force of the Argument—hey? V But as after your short Hare you sent a long Ditto, So you should by your Letter, and lengthen out it too. You made me to cry, with your bit of a Scrawl, Like our Trinity Friend—you know who,—“Is this all?” I expected to find an Account of Miss Puss As long as my Arm,—and to fob me off thus! I thought, when a Cheshire Squire sent a Hare hither, That at least he'd ha' sent the Hare's Pedigree with her. VI Sir Peter of Chester would ne'er have been hind'red From searching of Writings to find out their Kindred; The Field they were in he'd ha' blazon'd, I trow; And ha' show'd if your Hares had been Co-heirs, or no; With many such Questions, so nice and so knotty, Of which you have said not a Syllable,—; Yet you fancy that I should have somewhat to say t'em,— As if I had an'thing to do, but to eat 'em! VII “Dr. John, 'tis long since I receiv'd any Poë- “try: Argol, I've sent Hare and Service untó ye.” Very good, Master Peter; you think, I suppose, That Verses, with me, are as common as Prose. “I send you a Hare; send you me a Conceit;”— Is the old Grammar Rule then gone out of your Pate? Did your Master ne'er tell you, amongst other Stories, The Diff'rence betwixt Lep?res, and Lep?res? VIII The last Time, indeed, that you sent me a Hare, My Fury was mov'd with another Affair; And the Creature arriv'd just as I had my Head full Of a Butcher-Hall Challenge, so dire and so dreadful. But, now our dear Friend is remov'd to Cheapside, With right Hand, and left Hand, and Pen laid aside; And, for fear I should take his Bread from him, has fled straight From Butcher-Hall Lane to the Corner of Bread-street. IX Having put our Antagonist therefore to Flight, I return to the Hare here;—adzooks! what a Weight! The last that you sent us was presently gone; But this, o' my Word, is a Whopper o' one! Adzookus, whene'er we begin to see th' End on't, We'll remember, old Arnold, thy worthy Descendant; With Knives, and with Forks, and with Spoons we will thump her, And then, “to the Ladies of Toft” in a Bumper! TO THE SAME. In Answer to the following Letter: “Toft, 13th November, 1761. Friday-night. “Dear Byrom, I have sent you a hare that was alive this day. You must remember that formerly a Toft Hare would have produced a copy of Verses, and I hope that you still like Hares as well as I do Verses. Be that as it will, I shall be glad to hear in Verse or Prose that you are as well as I could wish you to be. I grow old, stir little from home, and lament that I am not able to put myself in your way s' oft as in former days. “With kind love to yourself and family, I remain, yours most affectionately, R. Leycester. “You find K. George and Mr. Pitt are the present darlings of this nation. Such strange alterations happen everywhere that I shall be surprised at nothing. To Dr. Byrom, at Manchester.” “Killed 13th November.” I Dear Peter, this tells you as soon as it could, That the Hare, which you sent us, was tender and good; And we send you thanks for it.—You say, “a Toft Hare Was wont to produce a Verse-copied Affair:” Which is true in the main; but Philosophers oft Give Effects to wrong Causes. It neither was Toft Nor Hare that was really productive of Metre, But,—as here you may see by Self-evidence,—Peter. II The Hare was no more than occasional Item, That if Verses were willing, one might as well write 'em; And Toft, tho' within but a few Mille Passus, Was as fit for the Purpose as foreign Parnassus. Its good-natur'd Owner was proximate Cause Of the free-flowing Rime and its modified Pause,— The Phœbus, at whose Innuendo the Muse Her Assistance, jam nunc, knows not how to refuse. III Still, it seems, “you like Verse, as you hope I like Hare.” Ay, for Intercourse' sake; not the worth of the Ware! Shops would answer your Taste with a much better Line, And Shambles with full as good Provender mine. Nay, if one should reflect upon Cruelty's Source In the Gentlemen Butchers, the Hunt, and the Course, 'Twere enough to prevent either Pudding or Jelly From storing such Carcass within a Man's Belly! IV Still I think of old Elwall, invited to sup At your Chester Abode, when a Hare was cut up, How he gave me this Answer, concerning this Prog: “Dost thou ever eat Hare?”—“Dost thou ever eat Dog?”— Don't think that hereby one intends to degrade The Presentment, Sir Peter, which now you have made; I would only suggest that the Thanks which I render, Stand up on their Feet not to Hare, but Hare-sender; V Whose Case you describe so exactly like mine, That it runneth almost in a parallel Line. You “grow old:”—I grow older;—“stir little from home:”— I less, and abroad more unable to roam;— You “lament that you cannot come in a Friend's way, As you formerly could:”—the same also I say. Now, the Case being common, how should it affect us, Seeing, “Aliter non fit avite Senectus?” VI With Gratitude, first, as I take it;—a Truth Which is common, indeed, both to Age, and to Youth. But, if Youth has neglected to fill up that Page, —My case!—it belongs to Executor Age To supply the defect which, tho' negligent, still We suppose the said Youth to have had in its Will. Old Senectus is tied, then, for Benefits lent us, To pay the just Debts of Testator Juventus. VII With Temperance, next;—since if Gratitude binds, For the sake of past Youth, our Senescenter Minds, They must, in a Body more subject to Phthisic, Guard against all Excess, and turn Food into Physic. One sees how corpuscular Eating and Drinking Make Youth in its Mentals so stout and unthinking; Age, therefore, altho' not so paunchful or pateful, Will be much better off, being sober and grateful;— VIII Two Helps, without which the mere animal Pow'r In young or old Blood grows insipid or sour. If the two Ventilators of Life do not mix, Old Age would, I find, be as cross as two Sticks. O grant me, ye Pow'rs both of Verse and of Prose, To be thoughtful and thankful, choose how the World goes,— Not, tho' the old Man should become twice a Child, To be peevish and fretful, but placid and mild! IX Now, as touching K. George, and his Pensioner Pitt, Your two present Darlings of national Wit, And the strange Alterations that seem in your Eyes So great, as if nothing henceforth could surprise:— If you have not yet seen Men and Matters so vary, As to bring you, before, to a “Nil admirari” In this changeable Island, one need not be told That you are but a Youngster, but newly grown old. X What a Pleasure to come has our Coming to Age, To emancipate Thought from so shifting a Stage; And to fix it on Matters that will, in all Cases, Stand firm on their solid, immoveable Bases,— Real Objects! Your Epitaph, else, on the Hare, “Kill'd November 13th,” is but one of a Pair With a poor hunted Peer's, “Decollat. such a Day;” What more than the Puss has the Peerage, I pray? XI It would else be too true, what comes into my Mind, How our old Master Bentley divided Mankind. He was talking of Short-Hand, and how an erroneous “Natare” the Blockheads had made Suëtonius To write, for “Notare;”—the World, he then said, Was made up of two Sorts, “Worriérs, Worriéd.” Dick, he told me, should learn, and amidst the World's Hurry, As the potenter Choice, be a Lawyer and “worry.” XII You see now, old Friend, how intentional Aim Sets out to comply with your Copyhold Claim; And how Age would run on, if the Muse did not fix The Rhythmus of Dactyls to ninety-and-six, And prompt, what the Household requires me to add: That to hear of Toft Welfare they always are glad, Being always possess'd of a competent Stock “Of the best of good Wishes for all your whole Flock.” “THE ART OF ACTING.” I The Art of Acting, Sir, by Aaron Hill, Shows that the Man has a poetic Quill,— A lively Turn of Thought, that could afford Of Rimes and Epithets a plenteous Hoard; That could the Subject, which he had in View, Thro' ev'ry Maze of winding Wit pursue. II Nevertheless,—with Freedom may I speak? Yes, to be sure, to R?n or F?ke!— I would have chosen, had I been to choose, Another Subject for Friend Aaron's Muse; And left to manage for itself the Stage, The Nonsense, Folly, Madness of the Age. III Tho' one may praise the Verse, one grieves to feel A Bard's Invention rack'd upon the Wheel To show the muscular Effect of Thought In Looks and Features, Nerves and Sinews, wrought,— For what? To teach his Buskin-footed Fools How to belie their Want of Sense by Rules! IV The Soul, it seems, what passes by observes From some snug Place behind the Optic Nerves; If pleas'd with Objects, she dilates the Brow; If not, contracts, to frown them out, somehow; And then the Muscles of the Face and Neck, Contiguous, take their Bias from her Beck. V Thus, in progressive Impulse, thro' the Whole, Each Part obeys the Meaning of the Soul; Thought shapes the Look, Look Muscles, Muscles Mien; One Chain of Action runs each Step between; While Voice and Movement, Gesture, and the like, All in one Concert are oblig'd to strike. VI This is the System, if I take it true,— The Art which, as he says, is Nature too. Grant it,—'tis what his Muse in tuneful Lays, Tho' now and then a little harsh, displays; Yet all this while, this Art of Looks and Limbs Is ill-bestow'd upon Theatric Whims. VII Actors and Actresses, I say again, Are not the Pupils worthy of his Pen. That Muse, which histrionic Wits applaud, The Wise will think no better than a Bawd. What “Heliconian Nymph” but would disdain To dangle after those of Drury-Lane? VIII But, “Hold!” says mine.—“Why, what's the matter, Dame?”— “Matter? Why, do you think you can reclaim This agèd Bard, so eager as to call The Censure upon Players Cant's low Crawl?”— “No, Madam; I can hardly hope for that.”— “No? Then, what is it that you would be at?”— IX “Only, to tell a certain Friend of mine That put it in my Head, what I opine.”— “A certain Friend? What! He, who in plain Prose Without our Help has ventur'd to expose Vice in its odious colours, and to paint In his Clarissa's Life and Death a Saint?”— X “Yes.”—“Why, then, hush! and spare the Playhouse Bard! We must maintain our Poor, and Times are hard. The Tragic Jades cry: ‘What becomes of us, If prosing Fiction may distribute thus All that is worth the Notice in a Play?’”— “Well, my dear Muse,—I have no more to say.” PART II. DIALOGUES IN THE LANCASHIRE DIALECT. I. A LANCASHIRE DIALOGUE, OCCASIONED BY A CLERGYMAN PREACHING WITHOUT NOTES. James. Wus yo at Church o' Sunday Morning, John? John. Ay, Jeeams, I wus, and wou'd no' but ha' gone For ne'er so mich. What, wur no' yo theer then? James. Nou; and I ha' no' mist, I know no' when. John. Whoy, yo had e'en faoo Luck on't. James. So I hear; 'At maes me ask ye, whether yo wur theer. They tell'n me that a Pairson coome, and took His Text bi Hairt, and preacht withaoot a Book. John. He did, for sartin, and hauf freeten'd mee, And moor besoide; but he soon leet us see He wanted noane. James. Whoy, could he do withaoot? John. Yoi, better, Mon, bi hauf, for being baoot. It gan me sich a Notion: for my Pairt, I think 'at aw true Preaching is by Hairt. Sich as we han I do not meean to bleeame, But conno' caw it, fairly, bi that Neeame. A Book may do at Whooam for Larning seeake, But in a Pilpit, wheer a Mon shid speeake, And look at th' Congregation i' their Feeace, He conno' do't for Pappers in a Keease. He ta'es fro' them what he mun say, and then Just looks as if he gan it 'um again. It is i'th Church; or one cou'd hairdly tell But he wur conning summat to himsel. Monny a good Thing, theer, I ha' hard read oo'er, But never knew what Preeaching wus befoor. James. And prei ye, John, haoo done ye know it naoo? John. Lukko, this Mon has tou't it me, sumhaoo. James. A ready Scholar! John. “Scholar?” Whoy, a Dunce May see, beloike, what's shown him aw at wunce. James. It ma'es me think,—yo're allivated soa— O' one that's gloppen'd, 'at has seen a Shoa. John. Wou'd yo had seen and hard as weel as I,— And if I shid say “felt,” I shid no' lie— Whot it wus moy good Luck to hyear, and see! Yo'd a bin gloppen'd too, as weel as me. James. Happen, I meeght; but con I understond Onny thing on't, good John, at second Hond? Yo han this preeaching Seeacret at a Hit: Con yo remember haoo it wus, a Bit? John. “Con yo remember?” Comes into mi Hyead Yoar telling once o' whot yoar Lowyer said Agen ou'd Hunks, the Justice o'the Peeace 'At wou'd ha' ta'en away yoar Faither's Leease: Haoo yo discroib'd him,—what a Mon o'th Lows! What a fine Tungue! and haoo he geet the Coaze: Haoo thooas 'at wur not at the 'Soizes too Cou'd no' believe t'one hauf o' whot wus true! James, “Remember?” Ay! and shall do, while I'm whick, Haoo bravely he fund aoot a knavish Trick. He seeav'd my Faither monny a Starling Paoond, And bu' for him I had no' bin o'th' Graoond. That wus a Mon worth hyearing; if yoar Mon Cou'd tauk loike him, I shid be gloppen'd, John. But, lukko' me, theeas Lowyers are aw tou't To speeak their Nomminies, as soon as thou't: Haoo done yo think wou'd Judge and Jury look, If onny on 'um shid go tak a Book Aoot of his Pockett—and so read away? They'd'n soon think, he had no' mich to say. Aoor honest Lowyer had my Faither's Deed; But, Mon, he gan it th' Clark o'th' Coort to read, And then—he spooak! and if yo had bu' seen, Whoy, th' Judge himsel cou'd ne'er keep off his Een; The Jury gaupt agen,—and weel they meeght; For e'ry Word 'at he had said wus reeght. John. Weel, Jeeams; and if a Mon shid be as wairm Abaoot his Hev'n, as yo abaoot yoar Fairm, Dunno' yo think, he'd be as pleeast to hear A Pairson mak his Reeght to houd it clear, And show the De'el to be as fause a Foe As that ou'd Rogue the Justice wus to yo? James. Naoo, John, I see what you been droiving at, And I'm o' yoar Oppinion as to that. I shid no' grutch at takking a lung Wauk To hyear a Clargyman, that cou'd bu' tauk As that Mon did, cou'd sarch a Thing to th' Booan, And in good yarnest mak the Coaze his ooan. I seeldom miss a Sunday hyearing thooas 'At preeachen weel enugh, as preeaching gooas; But I ha' thou't, sometimes, haooever good, A Sarmon meeght be better, if it wou'd; 'At, if it cou'd no' make Folks e'en to weep, It sartinly mit keep 'um aw fro' Sleep. Yet I ha' seen 'um nodding, Toimes enoo, Not ooanly Childer, but Church-Wairdens too. Cou'd yoar foine Preeacher — Morning wus too soon — Ha' kept Folks wakken, John, i'th' Afternoon? John. I wish he wou'd ha' tried; — and, I dare say, That Morning meeght have onswer'd for aw Day. He must ha' ta'en a pratty Dose, I think, 'At could ha' gen that Afternoon a Wink. Sich looking, and sich list'ning! One mit read In e'ry Feeace: “Ay, heer's a Mon indeed!” Some meeght ha' slept, if he had com'n agen, Befoor he spooak;—I'm shure they could no' then. James. They wurn, its loike, whaint fond o' summut new. John. Nea, nea; that winno' hou'd a Sarmon throo. Aw they that listen'd when he first begun, Kept list'ning moor and moor till he had done. Had he gone eend away, I gi' mi Word, He had me fast bi th' Ears; I'd not ha' stirr'd. Naoo, yo mun think 'at he taukt weel, at leeast, And passing weel, 'at Eich-body wur pleeast. They wou'd no', loikly, give him aw their Vooats Ooanly becose o' Preeaching withaoot Nooats. James. Whoy, but according to my Thinking, John, It gi's a hugeous Vontidge to a Mon To preeach withaoot Book, if he con bu' do't, And he mun needs be better hard to boot. Aoor Lowyer had noane; and I hauf con feel, It wus the Reeason whoy he spooak so weel. Yet, as yo sen, “that ooanly winno' do;” For th' Mon agen him praited like a Foo. John. Jeeams, its e'en haird upon a Lowyer's Tungue, They hoirn it aoot to oather reeght or wrung. A diff'rent Keease to that o' Pairsons woide: They are,—or shid be,—aw o' the same Soide. It makes, mayhap, aoor Lowyers reeadier far To pleead withaoot Book, til aoor Pairsons are. James. It's loike it duz; for Folks will larn to speeak Sannner bi hauf for Contradickshon seeak; And specially, if when their Tale is tou'd I' Truth or Loies, they mun be paid i' Goud. Pairsons are paid; and, if they win, may pay Thir Curates, John, to preeach for 'um, or pray; And, then, they do not, when they ma'en a Raoot, Tungue it so mich as fling thir Book abaoot. Yet Word o' Maooth, if it be reeght, 's no Sin: Whoy conno' Pairsons preeach by't, if they win? John. I know no'; Custom's druven to Extreeams: This may be one 'at they han getten, Jeeams. Some feeamous Fellies meeght, at first, begin, And aw the rest han follow'd 'um e're sin. When a Bell-Weather leeaps but o'er a Stray, At that same Pleck aw th' rest mun jump away. James. Marry, I wish 'at Pairsons, one i' ten, Wou'd bu' jump back into th' oud Way agen. Some han great Books enoo to fill a Cairt; Straunge 'at they conno' lay a Thing to Hairt, Sich as they loiken best, and ha' the Paoor To dray it fro' within, for one hauf Haoor! Haoo coome this Mon to do't? John. I conno' tell. Do it he did so yeeasy to himsel, And yet wi' so mich Yarnestness, and Fooarce, Of Tungue and Hond and Look, and good Discooarse, Aw smooth and clear and, 'ery turn it took, Still woinding to't like Weater in a Brook; 'At onny Mon o' Larning, takking Aiam, Meeght ha' larnt fro' him to ha' done the saiame. James. “Larning!” when Preeachers first coome in, they sen, They wurn no' monny on 'um larnèd Men, Nor Gentry nooather,— John. Whoy, and they sen true; But in aoor Days I daoot it woono' do, To ha' thooas preeach 'at comn so meeghty short O' th' first Beginners, so weel fitted for't. Wou'd but aoor Gentlemen o' Larning troy To preeach fro' th' Hairt, and lay their Pappers bye: We shid no' think warse on 'um for thir Kin, Nor loike 'um less, haooever larn'd they bin; Aoor Folks i' Church Toime wou'd be moor devaoot, And moin'd the Bus'ness 'at they wurn abaoot: And thooas good Sarmons 'at mooast o'n 'em ma'en, By aw good Folks wou'd be mich better ta'en. Witness this Gentlemon, o' Sunday Morn, The best 'at I e'er hard sin I wur born! But come, I'll say no moor; yo'st hear him first: I wish with au my Hairt he wur the worst. James. Ay, yo may wish;—but will he preeach agen? Haoo ar yo shure o' that? John. Nay, soa they sen; Yo're loike to tak yoar Chaunce, as weel as I. James. If onny comes, I'll tak it.—John, Good bye! II. A DIALOGUE BETWEEN SIR JOHN JOBSON AND HARRY HOMESPUN; OCCASIONED BY THE MARCH OF THE HIGHLANDERS INTO LANCASHIRE IN THE YEAR 1745. Sir John. Was ye not sadly frighten'd, honest Harry, To see those Highland Fellows? Harry. Not I, marry. Sir J. No? How comes that? H. Whoy, Sur, I conno' see What theer wur in 'um that shid freeten me. Sir J. So many armèd Ruffians as came here,— Was there not cause enough for all to fear? H. Aw whoa, Sur John? It, happen, mit be so Wi' sich foine loardly Gentlemen as yo; But we poor Foke— Sir J. Why, prithee, poor or rich, Is it not much the same? H. Nou; not so mich. We warken hard, as't iz, for meeat and clooas, And connot eem to be so feert, God knooas. Sir J. But, Harry, to see Fire and Sword advance! To have such Enemies as Rome and France! Should not this move alike both Rich and Poor, To drive impending Ruin from their Door? H. As for the Rich, Sur John, I conno' tell; But for the Poor, I'll onser for mysel. If Fire shid come, I ha' nout for it to brun, Nor wark to find for oather “Swooard” or Gun; For “France and Rome” my feering is no greater: They lyen, I think, o'th' tother Side o'th' Weater. Sir J. You don't consider what may be the End Of such a strange Indifference, my Friend. Pray, whether you have more or less to lose, Would you not guard your Country from its Foes? H. “My Country,” Sur? I have, yo' understond, In aw the Country not one Inch o' Lond. They that wood'n feight, and ha' Mon's Blood be spilt, May, if they win;—but whoy mun I be kilt? Sir J. Your Country, Friend, is not the Ground alone; There is the King that sits upon the Throne; The Protestant Succession lies at Stake That bloody-minded Papists want to shake. Now, you have some Religion left, I hope, And would not tamely give it to the Pope. H. He wou'd no' have it, happen, if I wou'd; Th' oud Mon beloike mit think his ooan as gud; And true Religion, Sur, if I have onny, No Mon i'th' Ward con tak it fro' me, con he? Sir J. If you but knew, Friend Harry, what a Scene Of Mischiefs happen'd in King James's Reign: How, but for Orange's immortal Prince, The Protestants had all been kill'd long since; If I should tell you— H. Nay, we aw, Sur John, Known weel enough that yo're a larnìd Mon; So was my Gronfayther, and ore his Ale Monny a Toime has toud another Tale; And I darr say mi Gronfayther toud true; For, lukko me, th' oud Felly wus no Foo, Nor Rebbil noather,— Sir J. And what was't he toud? H. Whoy, moor a deeal than my Brainpon con houd. Its like yo known as haoo, Sur, th' Oliverians Cut off th' King's Hyead? Sir J. Yes. H. And haoo th' Presbyterians Turnt aoot his Son, and maden a Rebelution? Sir J. They did it, Man, to save the Constitution; 'Twas Churchmen too that brought King William in As well as they— H. Whoy, be they whoa they win, One Egg, he sed, wus ne'er moor loike another Than thooas two mak o' Foke wurn loike tone tother: They wurn at aw toimes En'mies to th' blood Royal, And naoo woud'n ha' it that none but hom are loyal: Haoo con that be, Sur? Sir J. Why, I'll tell thee how— H. Nay, but yo connot. Sir J. Well, but hear me now, Our Kings are Stewards— H. Sur, yo meean they wurn; For Things, yo known, han tan another Turn: The Stuarts' Race is— Sir J. Poh! thou takes me wrong. H. Haoo mun I tak o'reet? Sir J. I say, so long As Kings are our Protectors,— H. Luk ye theer! Oud Oliver agen— Sir J. Nay, prithee, hear, And keep thy Nonsense in, till I have done,— H. Weel, Weel; I'zt hear yoars first then, if I mun. Sir J. The People, Harry, when they all agree— H. Aw, Sur? Sir J. Be quiet!—choose them a Trustee, And call him King. Now, if he break his Trust, They have a Right to turn him out, and must, Unless they would be ruin'd: dost thou think For one Man's swimming all the rest should sink? H. Yo lov'n a King, Sur, waintly; sink or swim, No Mon, I foind, is to be draoont but him. This chozzen King mit, happen, draoon yo furst; Then yo mit sink him after, an yo durst. If Folks may tak whot Kings they han a Moind, Whot Faut wi' all theese Scotchmen con yo foind? Sir J. Hang 'em all!—Have they not a King already That keeps his Contract with the People steady? Rebels! H. Whoy, ay, that's reet, for they wur byetten; They lost the Feight; but, haoo, if they had getten, Wou'd yo ha' lik't it, Sur, if an Heelonder Had toud oo,' Sauce for th' Goose wur Sauce for th' Gonder? Sir J. Thou'rt a sly Tyke; I'll talk with thee no more. H. Whoy, if yo pleeasen, then, Sur, ween give ore, Wishing that e'ry Mon may have his Reet, Feight as feight winn;—and so, Sur John, good Neet! Sir J. Thou'lt look, I find, to thy own Carcass still. H. Yoi, Sur, as lung as ere I con, I will. III. A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE SAME, ABOUT COMPELLING A PERSON TO TAKE THE OATHS TO THE GOVERNMENT. Sir John. Why so grave, Harry? What's the matter, pray? What makes thee look so sorrowful To-day? Harry. Whoy, Sur, I geet sore trubbl'd i' my Moind At what yon Folk han tou'd me, wheer I doin'd. Sir J. Prithee, what's that? H. They touden me, Sur John, That ye han sent a Summons to a Mon To tak an Ooath, a meety long on' too; An' they aw sen it's moore till he con doo. Sir J. Do, or not do, what Bus'ness is't of thine? H. “Bus'ness?” Whoy, he's a Naibor, Sur, o' mine; An' ye han hard, beloike, aoor Pairson tell, 'At one mun love their Naibor as theirsel;— Besoides 'at he's a sarviseable Felly As onny 'at we han o'th' Bus'ness, welly. And, then, an Ooath ye shanno' hyear come aoot O' that Mon's Maooth, Sur John, the year abaoot; An' if he be i'th' Moind 'at he has been, Yo'n foind it mich ado to cram one in. Sir J. Harry, that Matter we shall soon discuss: Trial of Skill is now 'twixt him and us. We must, and will subdue him, if we can, He's a seditious, réfractory Man. H. Nay, if ye bin for giving aoot o' Hond Hard Words, Sur, 'at one connot understond, I'll say no moor;—or else I ha' ta'en a Wauk, That yo and I mit'n have a Bit o' Tauk. But, happen, naoo yo're not i'th' Humour— Sir J. Yes; Talk what thou wilt! H. And yo'n no' tak't amiss? Sir J. No. H. Then I'll tell 'oo, Mester, whot I think. Sir J. Sit thee down first; wilt have a little Drink? H. Nou; nor yo noather! We'n be soaber booath, God willing, Sur, and tauk abaoot this Ooath. Sir J. What dost thou know about it? H. Whoy, no' mich; That's true enough,—thank God! I'm no' so rich. But I con guex abaoot it weel enough: Foke 'at han tan it, sen it's weary tough. There's monny a one that wou'd ha' gen a Craoon With aw his Heart, he neer had leet it daoon. Sir J. But it shall cost this Fellow more than so, If he don't take it;—that I'll let him know. H. Win ye, Sur? Sir J. Yes, I will. H. And if yo win, Sur John, yo're guilty of a wicked Sin. Sir J. Am I? How so? H. Whoy, dunnot yo maintain That Mon may tak God's Holy Name i' vain? Sir J. No, indeed, don't I; 'tis what I abhor. H. Then, pray ye, naoo, whot is this Summons for? Is it not sent to make a Mon to swear Summot abaoot the King, and his reet Heir? And are not yo weel satisfy'd, to boot, 'At he mun tak God's Name i' vain to do't? Sir J. That's his Affair to look to, and not ours; We act according to the legal Pow'rs. If private Conscience slight the public Call, It must e'en take the Consequence,—that's all! H. Marry, enough o' Conscience! And, good Feeake, Too mich by hauf, if Consciences may speeak! What mak' han yo', to mak' another Mon T' swear agen his? What cawn ye that, Sur John? Sir J. We cannot make him, Man, unless he will. H. Sur, Sur! It comes to the same Mischief still,— Or warse, if oather; for, if he fears God, And winno' fwear, then yo tan up the Rod. Here's a Commandment kept that God has spokken; And he mun pay for one o' yo'rs that's brokken. I say agen that, shift it haoo yo win, Sur John, yo're guilty of a wicked Sin. Sir J. Harry, as Justice of the Peace, I'm tied For public Peace and Safety to provide; So are my Brethren. Now, with this Intent, The Law directs our Summons to be sent. If disaffected Persons will not give The Constitution under which they live Proper Security, they must be made To feel the Force of what they would evade. If we should suffer these non-juring Knaves, We shall in Time be Papists all, and Slaves. H. “Papists and Slaves?” Whoy, good Sur John, the Pope, — The Deel himsel, con do no moor, I hope, Then tempt a Mon to utter with his Tung, I'th' Name o' God whot he believes is rung. Mun we be Papists, if we dunnot make A Mon belie his Maker for aoor Sake? Mun we be Slaves, except we forcen Foke To come and put their Necks into aoor Yoke? Sir J. Thou dost, not, Harry, understand the laws. H. Whoy, han they, Sur, sich desperate lung Claws, That a Mon's Conscience, hid within his Hairt, Mun be scratch'd aoot on't by 'um? For my Pairt, Laws or noa Laws, I'm sure we shidden do As we aw wishen to be done unto. Sir J. Good Faith, thou preachest tolerably well; But would'st thou have thy Neighbour to rebel? To make Disturbances in Church and State, And not be punish'd till it is too late? Magistrates, Man, must have a Care in Time, And in the Bud must nip the sprouting Crime. H. Nip it i'th' Bud? And so, it mun be doon, Yo thinken then, by punishing too soon? Magistrates, Sur, so haesty and so hard, Ma'en aw th' Rebellions 'at thir ar i'th' Ward. Let Foke be quiet; when they are so, Sur, And noather Church nor State will mak a Stur. But to be made to pay, or be forswaurn, Vexes 'em booath, as sure as yo are baurn. Whoy mun yo mak my Naibor pay sich Scores? His Sowl is his, as weel as yoars is yoars. Sir J. The Law, not I, obliges him to pay. H. Whoy win yo tak that Law agen him, hay? If yo mun do't, whether yo win or not, Are yo a Papist, or a Slave, or whot? Tell me, if this faoo Play be not yoar ooan, Whot mun yo pay for letting him alooan? Sir J. I pay? No Law obliges me to that. What is it, Harry, that thou would'st be at? H. Whoy, Sur, at this:—when Laws ma'en mich adoo, Monny a wise Mon is made into a Foo; Freeten'd, o'th' sudden, aoot of his reet Sense, He'll sell his Wits and aw, to save his Pence. But, pray, whot Mon, with hauf o' yoar good Thout, Wou'd do his Naibor an ill Turn for Nout? When he himsel gets nere a Farthing by't But shaum of hurting aoot of arrant Spite? This is the Wark, if yo'n consider weel, Not of a Mon, Sur John, but of a Deel. If one cud tak a Look i' that Mon's Breast, We shudden see him what they cawn “possest.” Sir J. Thou mak'st a Devil of me;—very well! H. Nou, nou; it's yo that ma'en one o' yo'rsel. I'd make a Mon o' ye, Sur, if I coud,— A gradely Mon, that seeches to do good, And not to labbor Books, and sarch a Cawse For hately Doings in hard-favord Laws. Sir J. Thou “sarches” me, I'm sure! Where hast thou had This same Book-searching Information, Lad? We have, 'tis true, been studying in what Shape We best might catch thy Neighbour in a Scrape; But, by thy Talking, we might spare the Pains, And better Bus'ness might employ our Brains. H. Ay, marry, meeght it! Thooas that letten aoot Their Breeans to Mischief mit as weel be baoot; Whoile they done so, it con be no greeat News That Fokes shid caw 'um summat warse then Foos. Sir J. Harry, thou'rt got into a talking Cue. H. Yo gin me Leeaf, Sur, do not ye? Sir J. I do.— Now, prithee, tell me then, and talk away, Nor mince the Matter: what do People say? H. I'll tell o', Sur. “Aoor Justices,” they sen, “That tan themsels to be sich loyal Men, Makken moor Enemies to th' King and Craoon Till onny Twenty Men besoide i'th' Taoon. They praisen mich this Government of aoors, Becose it has no ‘harbittary Paoors;’ For ‘Trade, Religion, Liberties enjoy'd, It sheds aw th' Governments i'th' Ward besoide: His ooan Oppinion e'ry Mon may take; Noa Parsecution in't for Conscience' Sake:’ Monny sich Words they han, as smooth as Oyl,— And Deeds as sharp as Alegar aw th' whoile. They getten to a corner by 'umsels, And there they done, i'th' Ward o' God, nowt elz But tan their Books, their Bacco, and their Beer, And conjurn up poor Fellows to appear; And then the gost'ring—what'n ye caw it?—Corum, Mun huff, and ding, and carry aw before 'um.” Sir J. A fine Description, truly, and quite free! But, Harry, how did it appear to thee? Could'st thou not find, where thou hast been to dine, One Word to say for an old Friend of thine? H. Yoi, Sur, I said as mich as e'er I coud; But whaint ado I had to mak it good. This Summons, Sur, this Summons! fie upon't! Whot argufi'd my Tung agen yoar Hondt? Whene'er they thrutten that into my Dish, It strick me dumb aootreet as onny Fish. Had I gooan on,—I know, Sur, what I know,— They'd soon ha' said I wur as bad as yo. Yo conno' think,—if I may be believ'd,— Yo conno' think, Sur, haoo my Heart wus griev'd! I'd fain ha' yo belov'd, Sur, in yoar Turn, As aw your Anciters before ye wurn; And I believe that none o' th' Race before, Be who they win, cou'd e'er desarve it moor; If thooas good Qualities that God has gin ye, Mit but appear withaoot, as they are in ye. But i' this one faoo Pleck, I need mun say, Yo generaten fro' 'um quite away. I hope you tan it i' good Part, Sur John; I meean to sarve ye,— Sir J. Honest Lad, go on! I think thou dost; thee I shall sooner heed Than twenty prating Wiseacres. Proceed! H. Whoy then, Sur John, if I may be so boud, Good-Will, when getten, is as good as Goud. Yoar Faither left ye here a foine Estate, He sout his Naibors Love, and not their Hate; His Principles wurn of another Mak' From thooas 'at yo han been advois'd to tak'. This greeat lung Ooath he ne'er coud understond; If yo bin wiser, naoo yo han his Lond, Better for yo; and yet I conno' skill Haoo it shid happen;—but be that as't will, Yet for yoar Faither's Seeake 'at's deead and gone, Yo shid'n consider wi' yoar sel, Sur John, Whether it's hondsom for his Son and Heir To foorce loike-moinded Men to come and swear. Monny han said that seen ye so behave: “Sur John here tramples on his Faither's Grave.” If, when th' oud Mester wur alive himsel, The Justices, for Fear he shid rebel, Had usen'd him as yo done other Foke, Yoar Wheels had wanted monny a pratty Spoke! Had he been made, agen his ooan Consent, A Papish, Sur, by Act o' Parliament, Yo woud'n ha' caw'd 'um by their proper Name That did the Thing, tho naoo yo done the same. Th' oud Mon's hard yoozitch woud ha' raisd yoar Blood— Sir J. So really, Harry, I believe it would; I should not quietly have sitten still, Had any of 'em us'd my Father ill. H. Whoy, Sur, and conno' yo think at it, then, And show some Marcy naoo to other Men? Suppose this Mon, becose he conno' think Just as yo done, had nooather Meeat nor Drink; Coud no', becose 'at Laws ma'en sich a Paoose, Wark in his Bus'ness and maintain his Haoose; But aw his Children wurn to beg i'th' Street,— Wouden yo think it sich a blessèd Seet? Woud no' yo say, at seeing Rags and Ruin: “The Deel wus in me! What wus I adoing?”— Yo gan me Leeaf to tauk, Sur,— Sir J. So I did, And must confess that I am fairly chid. Thy honest Bluntness oft has made me smile, Harry, but I ne'er hed thee all the while; Now, I believe that thou hast gain'd thy End And I, a better Temper tow'rds thy Friend. H. Eh, Sur? God send it! If yoar Heart wur oppen'd To loving Thouts, haoo Naibors wou'd be gloppen'd! Before this Justicing made sich a Pother, Haoo naiburly we liven'd with t'one t'other! But naoo,— Sir J. Well, Harry, thou hast said enough; I hope, I shan't hereafter be so rough; Nor sharpen, when they come within my Sphere, Laws of themselves sufficiently severe. When thou shalt see him, tell thy Friend from me, If he'll be quiet, quiet he shall be. Tell all thy Neighbours that the Thing is done: The Father's Memory shan't reproach the Son. Tho' all his Thoughts and mine were not the same, His Worth and Virtues shall direct my Aim. And, now I have confest to thee, Friend Harry, We'll call another Cause, if thou canst tarry; This thou hast richly merited to win.— Here! Who's in waiting? bring a Tankard in! H. Nay, Sur, yo mun excuse me, if yo pleeasen; Yoar Kindness here in harkening to Reeason Has made my Hairt (dry as a Kex, Sur John), Weeter and leeter till good Likkor con. I'll go my Ways, Sur, whooam afore it's dark, And let aoor Naibors know o' this Day's Wark; I lung to see 'um feeling whot I feel, At present, Sur, God bless ye, and farewell! VERSES CONTRIBUTED TO THE CHESTER COURANT. I. TOM THE PORTER. As Tom the Porter went up Ludgate-Hill, A swingeing Show'r oblig'd him to stand still. So, in the Right-hand Passage thro' the Gate He pitch'd his Burden down, just by the Grate, From whence the doleful Accent sounds away: “Pity—the Poor—and Hungry—Debtors—pray.” To the same Garrison from Paul's Church-yard An half-drown'd Soldier ran to mount the Guard. Now Tom, it seems, the Ludgateer, and he Were old Acquaintance, formerly, all three; And as the Coast was clear, by cloudy Weather, They quickly fell into Discourse together. 'Twas in December, when the Highland Clans Had got to Derbyshire from Preston Pans, And struck all London with a general Panic;— But mark the Force of Principles Britannic! The Soldier told 'em fresh the City News, Just piping hot from Stockjobbers and Jews: Of French Fleets landing, and of Dutch Neutrality; Of Jealousies at Court amongst the Quality; Of Swarston Bridge, that never was pull'd down; Of all the Rebels in full March to Town; And of a hundred Things beside, that made Lord May'r himself and Aldermen afraid,— Painting with many an Oath the Case in View; And ask'd the Porter what he thought to do? “Do?” says he, gravely; “what I did before; What I have done these thirty Years, and more: Carry, as I am like to do, my Pack, Glad to maintain my Belly by my Back. If that but hold, I care not, for my Part, Come as come will, 'tshall never break my Heart. I don't see Folks that fight about their Thrones, Mind either Soldiers' Flesh, or Porters' Bones. Whoe'er gets better, when the Battle's fought, Thy Pay nor mine will be advanc'd a Groat.— But, to the Purpose! Now we are met here, I'll join, if t'will, for one full Mug of Beer.” The Soldier, touch'd a little with Surprise To see his Friend's Indifference, replies: “What you say, Tom, I own, is very good, But—our Religion!” and he d?n'd his Blood— “What will become of our Religion?”—“True!” Says the Jail-Bird; “and of our Freedom too? If the Pretender,” rapt he out, “comes on, Our Liberties and Properties are gone!” And so the Soldier and the Pris'ner join'd To work up Tom into a better Mind. He staring dumb, with Wonder struck and Pity, Took up his Load and trudg'd into the City. II. ON TESTS. This contrast of Dissenter and Nonjuror Shews, to be sure, which Side is much the surer: Strong the Dissenter's, the Nonjuror's weak, Who vainly for himself attempts to speak. Says he—“That all Men by an equal Right Judge for themselves, according to their Light; That no Man's Conscience should be rul'd by Force, Which needs not good ones, and makes bad ones worse; That to impose however true a Creed, Is what the World calls Popery, indeed; That all, by Turns, lament the common Grief Of Penal Laws to punish Men's Belief.” All these are Arguments (it is confest) With a Dissenter—that won't bear the Test. III. MISS ?'S OBSERVATION UPON THE LATIN MOTTO. Folks are grown witty upon one another; But what's the Meaning of that Latin, Brother, That stands a-top there of the lowest Wit? “Why, ‘Indignation makes the Verse.’”—“That's it. But, pray now, if one turn the Observation, What's Latin for ‘The Verse makes Indignation?’” IV. LOVERS OF LIBERTY. “Balbus, methinks, the Friends of Liberty Who preach up Freedom should let all be free.”— “Aye, so think I; but you mistake the name: These are not Friends, but Lovers of that same; And Lovers are, you know, such selfish Elves, They always keep their Mistress to themselves.” V. DE FACTO LOYALTY. Success the First begot Success the Second; And then, when Queen Majority had reckon'd, Success the Third was born; when he was dead, Success the Fourth was crownèd in his stead. So on, by Arithmetical Progression, The Numbers christen'd give the true Succession. Hats, Caps, and Bonnets do but talk at Random; This is the Fact.—Quod erat demonstrandum. VI. ON THE NATURALISATION BILL. Sir, in my Mind, this is but half a Bill; There wants the proper Tally to it still: “Provided also, That We home-bred Caitiffs Do clear the Coast for these Outlandish Natives.” Let, for our Country's sake, this Clause remain, And it shall have no Subject to complain. Establish then, O Wisdom of the Nation, For Foreigners a Naturalisation; For English, Welsh and Scotch—a general Transportation. VII. ON THE SAME. Come, all ye foreign strolling Gentry; Into Great Britain make your Entry; Abjure the Pope, and take your Oaths, And you shall have Meat, Drink and Clothes. VIII. ON THE SAME. So Romulus his Empire founded whilom, And made for Foreign Helpmates an Asylum; By whose Assistance, you may read in Livy, O'er all the country round he rid Tantivy; From ev'ry Quarter sturdy Villains ran, And crown'd his Naturalisation-Plan. IX. ON THE SAME. With Languages dispers'd, Men were not able To top the Skies, and build the Tow'r of Babel; But, if to Britain they shall cross the Main, And meet by Act of Parliament again,— Who knows, when all together they repair, How high a Castle may be built in Air? X. ON THE SAME. This Act reminds me, Gen'men, under Favour, Of old John Bull, the Hair-Merchant and Shaver. John had a Sign put up, whereof the Writing Was strictly copied from his own inditing, Under the painted Wigs, both Bob and Full: “Moast Munny paid for living Here.— John Bull.” XI. ADVERTISEMENT UPON THE SAME. Now upon Sale, a Bankrupt Island, To any Stranger that will buy Land.— The Birthright, note, for further Satis- Faction, is to be thrown in gratis. XII. THE RUMP PARLIAMENT: A HISTORICAL QUESTION. Since Philalethes will indite no more, John English comes to smooth the Blunder o'er. He writes about it, and about it writes; What he has read, and never read, recites; Much vers'd in History, he ends his Puff: “I might myself have made it.”—Like enough! 'Tis oft the case of learnèd Heretoforians, Who read much History,—but no Historians. XIII. ON THE SAME. Hotspur was very ready to turn out, And write irregularly Rump about; But when his Trash Correctors came to read, They altered “Jackanapes!” to “Pert indeed!” Passing by Nonsense in all other Shapes, Why should they turn thee out, poor Jackanapes? XIV. THE GHOST OF THE RUMP. The Ghost of Hamlet! Was that Ghost a Rump? Then, make in Shakespeare one Correction plump; And in its Speech to Hamlet, Sir, be bold To spell aright: “I could a Tail unfold.” XV. TO MISO-MANC. AND COMPANY. Slain is the good old Cause, when Philaleth., A Rumpish Martyr, blunder'd to his Death; The Fight renew'd by English Jack and Hal, They worse confound the matter than Philal. With three such Champions sure the Cause will thrive,— One dead, and Two that are not yet alive. XVI. HOW DIFFERS HISTORY, PRITHEE, FROM HISTORIANS? Why, thus, dear Miso, deep in Hist'ry read: You contradicted what Historians said; By Proof, then, plain as one can well desire, Your Hist'ry differs from Historians, Squire. When your great Hist'ry-Reader makes a Blunder. Another time be wiser, and knock under! XVII. WHITWORTH'S VICARIOUS SUFFERINGS. Whitworth's Soliloquy Thereupon. Yes! I do suffer for the Jackanapes,— For more than one, that lead me into Scrapes; In Paper-War they blunder, huff and vapour. De'el take the Wars,—they'll ruin the poor Paper! Answer Thereunto. Why for poor “Jackanapes” should Whitworth suffer,— For what belongs to “English Hal” the Huffer? A true Original the Printer shielded: He did not suffer; but alas! “poor De'el” did. XVIII. BIRDS OF A FEATHER. Answer Thereunto. “Dear me! has Wit and Verse, at last, no more 'Gainst Rump and Commonwealth to say in Store? 'Gainst Whig Opponents—” 'Tis all one, you see, To say a Word 'gainst any of the Three,— Rump, Commonwealth or Whig.—Birds of a Feather, Proverb and Poet show, will flock together. XIX. OAK-APPLE DAY. A Stranger, once, on Restoration-Day Rode through a Town, and then asked where it lay? When, having learned that he came through the Place, He turned his Horse; and, pondering the Case: “Come through it?” says he; “so I thought I should, But missed my Road in riding through that Wood.” XX. THE CONTRAST BETWEEN TWO EXECUTED LORDS. I. As Crowds attended when the fatal Blow Took off Kilmarnock and Balmerino, Men were surpris'd that Warriors on a Side Should in the common Field of Death divide. By the same Path descending to the Grave, In the same Cause so widely to behave! What turns of Anger, Pity, Censure, Praise, Did such a Contrast of Deportment raise! II. One, struck with Horror at Rebellion's Crime, Seeks by Repentance to redeem the Time; Begs of offended Majesty the Grace, That future Conduct may the past efface; Would live, but only till his Blood be spilt In such a Cause as may atone for guilt; Would die, if such shall be his Sovereign's Doom; And, praying for his Race, approach the Tomb. III. Approach he must, and be the first to bleed; The Scene beheld, 'tis terrible indeed!— The sable Scaffold, Coffin, Axe, and Block, And circling Eyes on him concenter'd, shock, Yet not confound. Instructed to prepare, He meets with Death too serious to dare; Receives, his Crime avow'd, and Mercy clos'd, Th' impending Stroke, reluctantly compos'd. IV. The other, firm and steady in the Cause Of injur'd Monarchs and of ancient Laws, By change of Conduct never stain'd his Fame,— Child, Youth, and Man, his Principles the same. How greatly generous his last Adieu, That from his Friend one more Confession drew! He clears his Prince's Honour and his own, And only sorrows not to die alone. V. “Pledge me,” he cries, “one Step to Heav'n, my Friends!” And, in his wonted Dress, thereon ascends; Scorning, when past through Life with Conscience clear, In Death to play the Hypocrite, and fear. His Head adornèd with the Scottish Plaid, His Heart confiding upon God for Aid, He, as a Guest, invites his welcome Fate, Gallant, Intrepid, Fearless, and Sedate. VI. What shall we say?—If both of them were bad, The one was Coward, and the other Mad. If one was wrong, the other in the Right, The which,—'tis plain to ev'y Party-Wight. If each obey'd the Dictates of his Breast, And of true Worth Sincerity be Test; Then, to Kilmarnock's Penitence give Quarter, And write Balmerino a valiant Martyr. XXI. A GENUINE DIALOGUE BETWEEN A GENTLEWOMAN AT DERBY AND HER MAID JENNY, IN THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER, 1745. Mrs. Jenny, come here: I'm told that you have been To see this Man. Jen. What Man? Mrs. Why, you have seen The young Pretender, Hussy, at his Lodging. Is it not so?—Come, tell me without dodging! Jen. Why, really, Madam, I was passing by, Thinking no harm, not in the least, not I; And somebody or other that I met— Mrs. What somebody? Jen. Indeed now, I forget;— Said what a handsome Man he was; and so, Begging your Pardon, Madam, I did go; But had no ill Intention in the Thing. A Cat may look, as Folks say, at a King. Mrs. “King” do you call him, ye rebellious Slut? Jen. I did not call him so, good Madam, but— Mrs. But me no butting; not another Day Shall any Rebel in my Service stay; I owe you Twenty Shillings,—there's a Guinea; Pack up, and go about your Business, Jenny! Matters are come indeed to a fine Pass! The next Thing, I suppose, you'll go to Mass. Jen. “To Mass?” What Road? For I don't know the Place, Nor could I tell which Way to turn my Face. Mrs. “Turn?” You'll turn Papist, and believe Black's White. Jen. Why, bless me, Madam, I han't lost my Sight! Mrs. And then the Priest will bid you cut my Throat. Jen. Dear loving Mistress; how you talk by Rote! I would not hurt a Hair of your dear Head, Were all the Priests in Mass to kill me dead; And,—I don't say it with Design to brag,— Since I've been with you, you han't lost a Rag. I “cut your Throat” because I saw the P?e, And never thought of “Black” or “White” e'er since! Mrs. Good! This is you that did not call him K?g; And is not P?e, ye Minx, the self-same Thing? Jen. You are so hasty, Madam, with your Snarls! Would you have me call the Gentleman plain Ch?s? Mrs. “P? Ch?” again! Speak out your Treason Tales: “His R?l H?s Ch?s the P? of W?s!” Jen. Oh, Madam! You say more of him than me; For I said nothing of his Pedigree. Mrs. “Pedigree!” Fool! What would the Wench be at? What Pedigree has any Bastard Brat? Jen. Nay, I'm no Harold; be he what he will, He is a charming Man to look at still. When I was got in there, amongst the Throng, His R?l H?s— Mrs. Hussy, hold your Tongue! Jen. You call'd him so yourself but just e'en now. Mrs. Yes, so I did; but then, the Manner how? Jen. And will you turn a Servant out o' Doors, Because her Manners ben't so fine as yours? Mrs. Jenny! I say, you had no Business neither To see the Creature, or go near him either. Jen. “Creature?” Nay, Pardon, Madam, he's no Creature. But a sweet comely Christian, ev'ry Feature. Mrs. “No Creature!” Would you worship him, you Dunce? Jen. I would you were to see his Worship once! Mrs. How can the Girl cross Questions like a Fool! Or think that I should go and see the Tool! Jenny! tho' you have done so much amiss, I pity such an Ignorance as this. If you'll go mind your Work as heretofore, And keep at home, I'll pass the Matter o'er. Jen. Ah, Madam! you're so good! Let me but speak My simple Mind, or else my Heart will break! I've such a strange foreboding in my Heart: If you but saw him once, we should not part: Do see him once! What harm is there in seeing? If after that there be not an agreeing, Then call me twenty Rebel Sluts: if you, When you have seen him, ben't a Rebel too. Now, whether Jenny did persuade her Dame, Is not, as yet, betrumpeted by Fame: Sometimes there happen to be secret Views, That are not put into the public News: But, by Report, that private Rumour gives, She'll never part with Jenny while she lives. XXII. VERSES SPOKEN EXTEMPORE BY A SOLDIER THE DAY AFTER HE RECEIVED A FLANNEN WAISTCOAT, THROUGH THE BOUNTY OF THE QUAKERS. This friendly Waistcoat keeps my Body Warm; Intrepid now I march, and fear no Harm. Beyond a Coat of Mail, a sure Defender; Proof against Pope, the Devil, and Pretender! The Highland Plaid of no such Pow'r can boast; Arm'd thus, I'll plunge the foremost in their Host, Exert my utmost Art, my utmost Might, And fight for those whose Creed forbids to fight. XXIII. ONE THING WANTING. When, once, a King enquir'd (no Matter who), How many Requisites in War would do, The Monarch thought the Statesman had been funny, Who answer'd: “Three, Sir: Money, Money, Money.” But right he answer'd, as Affairs went then, If Money would procure Allies and Men. But modern Ministers keep up the Tune And “Money, Money, Money!” cries each One. But here the Diff'rence is: these modern Great Buy only Promises whene'er they treat. Tho' Money once suffic'd, we must allow, Some further Requisite is wanting now, Some higher Quality, to play our Part.— Say, P?m, is it Honesty, or Art? AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND, Occasioned by a Sermon intituled “The False Claims to Martyrdom consider'd; a Sermon preach'd at St. Anne's Church, Manchester, November 2nd, 1746, being the Sunday after All Saints' Day, by Benj. Nichols, M.A., Assistant Curate of the said Church, and Chaplain to the Right Honourable the Earl of Uxbridge.” Dear Sir,—I'm really sorry, that our Friend So far th' ungrateful Subject should extend. No Stranger He to Nature's tender Ties: And fewer Words, he tells us, might suffice, But that the Character of Martyrdom Had been disgrac'd—poor Panic Dread! by whom? This groundless Fancy swimming in his Head, He neither spares the Living nor the Dead. Careless of Accuracy, Place, or Time, He blackens All,—Life, Principle, or Crime; Pursues th' Unfortunate beyond the Grave, With low-plac'd Hints of Saving,—not to save. Heav'n's lowest Place he argues to forbid, Unless they died—not as he knew they did. When he bestow'd this generous Adieu, Their last and dying Sentiments he knew; And making such as he embrac'd the Test Of Happiness, all Hope of being blest, By a new Priestly Pow'r to loose and bind, To Penitence impossible confin'd. Happy for them if so and so they died! This was to mock Repentance, and deride. May he repent—or whither must we trace The saving Ifs that never could take Place? What Obligation to the Public draws His forward Zeal beyond the public Laws? Ev'n rigid Laws, when they condemn, condole, And pray to God for Mercy on the Soul. Does then the Gospel, Sir, in his Account, Or does the Saviour's Sermon on the Mount, The Gospel's Gospel, does the chosen Bliss Lead him to more Severity than this? O Divine Sermon! little understood, If they who preach thee, not content with Blood, Justly perhaps, perhaps ???????? shed, (Do Thou determine, Judge of Quick and Dead!) By this devoted Earth's all transient Scene Measure the Glories of eternal Reign; Adjust its martyr'd Ranks, and seem to fear, Lest Heav'n should err—and Jacobites be there! I am surpris'd, that one of his good Sense Should write so harshly on a mere Pretence; Or think of banishing a Soul from Heav'n, Because a Name had not been rightly giv'n. Say, that the Living misapply the Word,— To judge the Dead is shockingly absurd. Martyr, 'tis granted, has a sacred Use; And yet, sometimes, a Meaning more diffuse. Preachers don't scruple (I could name the Page) To talk of Martyrs to tyrannic Rage, On dignified Improvements to insist, And make Additions—to no Romish List. What then? Must ev'ry Papist needs expel The whole mistaken Calendar to Hell? Or such unchristian Fury, if they did, Should not a preaching Protestant forbid? Is he oblig'd to imitate the worst That Rome can practise, and pronounce Men curst? Can diff'rent Politics, or diff'rent Faith, Afford a Plea for such enormous Wrath? No; but against an Inference so hard He did, it seems, particularly guard. Pray, when his warm Invectives he dispens'd, What Applications did he guard against, Lest Parent, Child, or Widow's Heart should ache, Such as no Mortal could forbear to make. What Ground for griev'd Relations to resent? Why understood they what the Preacher meant? Why knew they not, that touching his Repute Was the true Meaning of—to persecute? That gave him Right to comment on the Text, And claim the great Beatitude annext. Ye Friends, who wish'd his Reputation safe, Say, why advise him to this printed Chafe? If the Resentments of the meekest Men Rise against those, according to his Pen, Who through inhuman Prejudice divest Of ev'ry tender Sentiment the Breast: Why renew theirs, who felt in his Harangue Of ev'ry height'ning Epithet the Pang? Who heard the righteous Oratory stretch To “Rebel”—“Traitor”—“Malefactor”—“Wretch,”— To Phrases only accurate to stain Dead Memory, and give the Living Pain? Sure tender Sentiments forbid the Gust Of “Executions”—“necessary”—“just”— Yea, even “merciful”—for such, it seems, Ours, as he calls them, the good Preacher deems. Had one, who, nicely sensible of Fame, Counts many Deaths a Trifle to his Name, Whom the most natural Resentments grate, With gentler Mention touch'd unhappy Fate; Had that Regard, which he would seem to own, To Bosoms big with recent Griefs been shown; On Dead, on Living, had he thrown less Dirt: Nor Truth, nor Christian Charity, were hurt; Nor would Intention's Honesty be spoil'd, Though even Enemies were less revil'd. But amongst them, who never wish'd him harm, In his own Flock, to be so desp'rate warm; In his own Flock, the Objects of his Love, Where once he aim'd to please and to improve; Nothing for native Pity to forbear, To dwell relentless on the Theme severe,— Alas! how Zeal of Knowlege gets the start, When once the Head is warmer than the Heart! Then is perceiv'd the Popery of those Who are, in Tongue, the keenest of its Foes; Rail at Ambition, Bigotry, and Rome, And hate abroad what they caress at home. Their Congregations legally are teaz'd, And all is Clamour, if they are not pleas'd. False, gross, indecent, ev'ry Thing they say; Each Word iniquitous, but—print away! Their Lessons, thus advisedly imprest, Must lay the People's Prejudice to Rest: Their Passions cool, they will be work'd upon, To read with Pleasure, what they heard with none: Praise or Rebellion, the Dilemma now; Their Teacher's Reas'ning they must needs allow; Be mov'd, when Things in their true Light are shown, To take his Conscience, and give up their own; To like, in Pulpits, Arbitrary Pow'r, And Seats subdued to Tyrants of an Hour. Had some State Holyday—Thanksgiving, Fast— Put him in Mind of cooking such Repast, He might have pleaded this Excuse, at least, They need not come, who shall dislike the Feast. But wherein lies of that Excuse the Force? “The Sermon fell in with the common Course Of Preaching,”—how fell in? What, of itself? No; it had lain compos'd upon the Shelf, Ready prepar'd for Numbers forc'd to hear The Bar-like Sounds, and shed the helpless Tear. 'Twas not a sudden Fit of Complaisance; It fell in—by premeditated Chance. Free to have spar'd an Audience, wherein Not to renew their Sorrow was no Sin, He chose, as one to whom it did belong, For social Peace to irritate the Throng. Laymen might hide of Laity the Woes; The Clergy's Office is to interpose. He acts in Character, while he confines Both Heav'n and Earth to what himself opines; Points the dire Stroke at Persons not alive, And then, at all who pity and survive. This kind of Conduct,—from Affairs of State, And Temp'ral Laws, to fix eternal Fate,— Did Christ and his Apostles, to apply His own plain Question, ever justify? “They never meddled with the Rights of Kings.” How comes He then to meddle with such Things? “Nor they nor any ancient Martyr died, A Crown's disputed Title to decide.” No;—nor to such a titular Dispute The sacred Function did they prostitute. For sceptred Rule they neither drew the Sword, Nor of an earthly Kingdom preach'd the Word. If the Religion of these Days persuade The Christian Priests to drive this worldly Trade, In, with such Wrangling, if the Pulpit chimes, How are we fall'n off from the ancient Times? 'Tis true, they preach,—but how? As Pleaders bawl; Not as the Ancient Christians did, at all. They preach, but what Religion? Of a Throne, By Christ and His not meddled with, they own; For such Attachment to a reigning Mode, As Christ, Apostles, Martyrs, all explode. How was it possible to think of them, And raise such Wrath about a Diadem? Of Christ the Love and Meekness to recall, Who bore the Sins and Suff'rings of us all, And then directly, with unbearing Zeal, One half the Sermon with one half repeal? Here Gospel-Pity and Compassion shines; Law, Death, and Judgment, fill succeeding Lines. First is display'd the Doctrine of the Cross; That of the Gibbet then supplies its Loss. How Heav'n alone Men's Consciences can try, And He Himself condemns them by-and-by. Here in one Page the Living Saints are priz'd, And in the next the Dead ones villainis'd. One while Religion, to obtain its Ends, On its own native Energy depends: Worldly Dominion, and the Lust of Rule, Reverse the Doctrine of the Christian School: Our meek and holy Lord had no Intent To found His Church on such Establishment; The Force of Truth, persuasive of the Will, Was, and must be, Religion's Armour still. These Things the Preacher had no sooner spoke, But thus his next immediate Words revoke: “It is oblig'd, in order to enforce It's own intrinsic Pow'rs, to have Recourse To Civil Pow'r”—Adieu, then, Force Innate, By which the Church did once convert the State; By which blind Heathen, persecuting Jew, And the great Antichrist, it overthrew; By Beauty, Truth, and passive Virtue then, Self-recommended to the Hearts of Men, With its Blest Founder's Spirit once endued, Firmness of Soul, and Christian Fortitude; Spite of the World, it conquer'd worldly Pow'rs: —Now free, thank God, from Danger under Ours! Yes, to be sure—look round about, and name The Civil Pow'r, that does not say the same; The Bigot Priest, that does not thus maintain His Church of Rome, Geneva, France, or Spain: In Times and Places though they differ quite, Pulpit-Possession makes all Doctrines right. 'Twas this that kindled the religious Blaze Of Heretics, so call'd, in Marian Days; And here, by one of Wording false afraid, Martyrs without the Church's Office made; By one, whose Pages after that refer, For real Martyrs and their Lives to her; Who bids us learn from her Injunctions too, To whom the Honour of that Name is due. Let Protestants attend then, as they ought, To her Injunctions, and be better taught. Whom has she so distinguish'd, and enjoin'd Her Sons to call their Martyrdom to mind? What canonisèd Villains, in the List Of Romish Martyrs, has the Church dismist? So often met with in a rambling Charge, Brought against Martyrologies at large,— Unprov'd—no matter!—'tis the taking Style: Papists at random, right or wrong, revile! Christianity itself in them is Fraud; Bigots are pleas'd, and Infidels applaud. For such rash Judgment, for such mean Abuse, The Church affords her Children no Excuse. She blames the Virulence of ev'ry Sect, But pays all pious Characters Respect. Whilst she endeavours, by all loving Arts, To heal Divisions, and unite Men's Hearts, They through the widen'd Breaches rush to storm, And ruin what she labours to reform. Her just Design their frantic Zeal supplants, She left the Sinners, and they leave the Saints. Of Saints so far from seeking the Disgrace, 'Twas their Example that she sought to trace. She has, indeed, the Preacher might have shown, Had he thought fit, a Martyr of her own, A Royal Martyr—though his fatal Hour Was fixt by those, who only could have Pow'r; Though he, to use the Language of the Times, By public Justice died for public Crimes, When, bent against his Subjects to rebel, On his own Head the just Resentment fell. The Church, however, mov'd by other Laws, Regarded not the Suff'ring, but the Cause; Approv'd of his, unmindful of the Rights Of all the Worthies whom our Author cites; Of Marian Ancestors forgot to sing; Her only Martyr was a Stuart King. Had but our Friend, Sir, lent the Church his Voice, And will'd, in earnest, to defend her Choice; His Text had rather led him to expose The real Falsehoods of Fanatic Foes; Nor had he left her publicly defam'd To talk of Claims that never had been claim'd. With cool Formality, in gen'ral Terms, The Church's Judgment feebly he affirms, Waves her distinguish'd Act, and passes by All those who give both Church and King the Lie; Permits unnotic'd the Sectarian Crew To urge her Falsehood, and her Martyrs too. While for his own imagin'd Motto's sake, What wild “Perhaps's” is he forc'd to make! Of Honours that feign'd Advocates allot, Of loading, gilding, colouring, and what not? The Proof against these Nemo's, and their Traps, And Reparations—is the poor “Perhaps.” Had all been true, should a good-natur'd Man Form of such posthumous Revenge the Plan? And after Hangmen had perform'd their Parts, Pronounce the Character, rip up the Hearts Of those who suffer'd, guiltless they at least Of what the Living say at the Deceas'd? Admit, that “Martyrdom” is not the Case Of them who suffer for a Martyr's Race; For Prince and Country if they die, admit “Hero” and “Patriot” to be Words more fit: Must not a Clergyman be much at Ease To ventilate such Niceties as these; To play the Critic, when the poor Misled —To answer all his Arguments—were dead? But outward Rev'rence shewn to their Remains Excites the Preacher's seasonable Pains. Poor, weak Pretence, unworthy of the Gown! The Fact is known to ev'ry Child in Town, However cloak'd with disingenuous Hints, The stupid Nonsense of the lying Prints. Custom, that teaches how to treat dead Foes, India to scalp, and Europe to expose, The mildest Strokes of Justice to pursue, Fixt up deluded Suff'rers Heads to view. Some tender Persons the Remains so fixt Behold with Horror and Compassion mixt. A Widow or an Orphan, passing by, Paid them the Honours of the weeping Eye;— A Father, to sum up the whole Affair, Put off his Hat, perhaps preferr'd a Pray'r. From hence, the wond'rous second-sighted Ken Of late Rebellion rising up again: Hence, the strange Fancies of our Friend who hears Unutter'd Notions sounding in his Ears. The public Danger, from Attempts all quash'd, Requires the slain Offenders to be lash'd; Haunted by Rebel Ghosts, the Common-weal Still hangs upon th' Assistant-Curate's Zeal. Important Task! The Pulpit of St. Anne's Never so flourish'd under Hooles and Bannes. Poor aged Rectors They, whose utmost Speed Seldom out-ran the common Christian's Creed! True to their Office, but unskill'd to broach The Secret of Political Reproach, They took th' old-fashion'd Methods to increase Of Social Life the Welfare and the Peace. They did not end the Church's Common Pray'rs With fierce Dispute of secular Affairs; Not first the Saviour's Life and Words relate, And then go preach the Bigotries of State; Of Gospel-Love submissive to the Yoke, They never sought their Hearers to provoke; Whoe'er aspers'd them, they could bear it still Nor ask the Type to justify the Quill. May Age, Experience, and impartial Truth, To reach their Mildness prompt succeeding Youth! May he, whose Honesty I question not, Though other Mens, too hasty, he forgot, And forc'd a Friend's expostulating Lines, See his Mistake, and match those meek Divines; Leave to the low-bred O?ns of the Age Sense to belie, and Loyalty to rage,— Wit to make Treason of each Cry and Chat, And Eyes to see false Worship in a Hat; Wisdom and Love to construe Heart and Mien, By the new Gospel of a Magazine! To such Excess let wild Fanatics run, And deeper Thought direct the Church's Son,— Such as old Hammond, here before me, fir'd, And pitying Love for Enemies inspir'd! This learnèd Church-man, loyal and devout, When told of Traitors that were put to Rout, Found in his Charity for them a Share: “Poor Souls! May God forgive them!” was his Pray'r. His Charity nor Laws nor Rights confin'd, Nor Politics unchristianis'd his Mind. The faithful Subject his Allegiance kept; The Christian Priest for routed Rebels wept. Many the Instances of such-like Love,— One, that, perhaps, if any can, may move: If outward Rev'rence to a Father's Name From one united to the Child may claim, He will forbear hereafter to out-brave The known Example which that Father gave. Two Men, condemnèd for the self-same Crime, Have suffer'd Death, though at a diff'rent Time. Both their Remains distinguishèd alike,— Father's and Son's—were stuck upon the Spike. The first as guilty as the other, sure, Whom filial Motives might perhaps allure! Yet the good Rector, by whose pious Care He was for Death instructed to prepare, Pronounc'd him, though he never could repent Of what he died for, a true Penitent; Maintain'd his Credit, whom he saw refuse The strong Temptation falsely to accuse, To wrong his Neighbours by no Proffers brib'd. His solemn Word who doubted, hear describ'd “Of Christian Charity quite destitute:”— Common Humanity disowns the Brute. He thought, though Men as Malefactors died, They might persist, where Conscience was the Guide; The Marks of true Sincerity not want, And unconvincèd safely not recant. He did not see th' unpardonable Sin Of that Opinion which the Man was in,— Not held from obstinate perverse Despite, But just Regard to what he thought was right. Fruitless Attempts to change the constant Mind Of one so full persuaded he declin'd; All other Crimes right heartily confest, He left that Point to God and his own Breast. Great the Regard to Conscience, when sincere; To this both Priest and Penitent adhere. The Penitent, though in their Prince's Name They differ'd, hop'd their Saviour was the same; Begg'd that the Sacrament of Christian Love Might be his Passport to the Realms above. The Priest, believing that a legal Death Forbade not Blessing from the Living Breath, Will'd a declarèd Rebel to partake Of His Who died for ev'ry Sinner's sake. See here by Friendship of a closer Band, Than what the World's Distinctions could command, The Clergy's Office dignified throughout, Nor unabsolv'd a dying Man devout! This unexceptionable Instance, Sir, To some Respect a Son-in-Law may stir. To what sage Rectors have maturely writ, Novicial Warmth in Curates may submit. Worthy indeed th' Example to prevail, And teach, at least, our Teachers not to rail; Too oft descending into Civil Prate, To make the Church a Fact'ress for the State! O that the gen'rous Temper may descend Along with outward Blessings to our Friend! The Father's Judgment may the Son revere, Be to his Fortune, and his Virtues, Heir: And, ev'ry Prejudice worn off, be brought To teach the Gospel, as it first was taught; To breathe the Spirit which His Martyrs breath'd, Whose Kingdom wants no civil Sword unsheath'd; Whose Church from killing Sentences of Law Her mitred Chiefs still teaches to withdraw,— Not, sure, in sacred Places to maintain That which forbade their Presence in profane! They from the Prince of Peace should, sure, derive The Meek, the Gentle, and the “Not to strive!” From Him the Clergy's Mission and Employ, Who came to save Men's Lives, not to destroy. So may he learn, Sir, to possess entire His hearty Wish, and his sincere Desire; To be with Pleasure and Improvement heard, When to rash Zeal true Candour is preferr'd, And spread, without Exception or Offence, Good Will to all, good Manners, and good Sense! SIR LOWBRED O??N, OR, THE HOTTENTOT KNIGHT. I When Lowbred of Rochdale, good People, sat down To encounter the Faction at Manchester Town, Like old Brother Quixote, he thought it but right, That at first setting out they should dub him a Knight! Derry down down, hey derry down. II Quoth he, “Master-Tool, it comes into my Head, Of an Order of Knighthood I somewhere have read, Which Hottentots—upon gladly embrace; And so will I too, for—that's my very Case. Derry down, &amp;c. III “Then let the Nonjurors and Jacobites all, The true British Hottentots, come and instal; And when they have liquor'd me duly and greast, I hope they will call me Sir Lowbred, at least. Derry down, &amp;c. IV “This done, Sir, I'll answer your Verses and Tricks In Pages one Hundred and Fifty and Six; Nor will I stand much upon Reason and Sense, For without, it shall cost you—a good Eighteen Pence. Derry down, &amp;c. V “And, Sir, I must tell you that Lowbred is worse Than impudent Puppy for me to impurse, That Son of a ?, and that Son of a ?, Would never have struck me—so quite to the Core. Derry down, &amp;c. VI “In your six Rebel Lines if that Word had been mute, The rest I should never have gone to confute; For I found that I could not, tho', since they came out, Never Hottentot twisted his Guts so about. Derry down, &amp;c. VII “Pray why, Master-Tool, when you knew not my Person, Would you venture my Works to entail such a Verse on? And all, I beseech you, for what mighty Crimes? —Because that I would not speak Truth at all Times! Derry down, &amp;c. VIII “Tho' I rail'd at your Townsmen without Fear or Wit, And first abus'd you, Sir, for what you ne'er writ, Yet ranting or raging, whoe'er I belied, I must tell you, Sir, 'twas—on the Government Side. Derry down, &amp;c. IX “So since you provoke me, Sir, into the Field, I dare let you know, that I never shall yield; To your fugitive Hero I am not akin, For I shall not endanger—one Inch of a Skin. Derry down, &amp;c. X “I dare let you know, too, my humble Opinion Of a Person that went to Bologne, or Avígnon, Or I cannot tell whither; but what he did there, I took an Account of—from th' Old Chevalier. Derry down, &amp;c. XI “I dare let you know too, that Birds of a Feather, Nonjurors and Jacobites, should flock together; When in the same Centre I make them conjoint, You cannot deny but—I speak to the Point. Derry down, &amp;c. XII “And now I have told you, Sir, what I dare do, I'll attack your Friend D?c?n by writing to you; So then, if you please, you may stand by and look, And mark how I empty my Commonplace-Book. Derry down, &amp;c. XIII “I'll mention my Authors both Latin and Greek, And all to what Purpose, I'll leave you to seek: Paracelsus, Weigelius, and eke your Friend Behmen You'll hear of, and wonder—for what I brought them in. Derry down, &amp;c. XIV “Both Oculist Taylor and Mountebank Green Shall lend me a Query to humour the Spleen; I'll quote from old Essays, Hicks, Boulter and Baddam, And beyond all Exception will prove—that I had 'em. Derry down, &amp;c. XV “As my Book, Sir, your Principles freely examines, I'll talk about Mussulmans, Hindoos, and Bramines; At Pegu and Goa your Pranks I'll display, And quite rout the Jacobites—of Paraguay. Derry down, &amp;c. XVI “I'll eke out my Pages with Stories and Tales, To amuse the kind Reader when Argument fails, And upon the Nonjurors so rarely will Joke, I'll teach them to laugh—at a Man of my Cloak. Derry down, &amp;c. XVII “When I battle old Churches, and Fathers and Saints, Who furnish your Friend with his primitive Rants; I'll shew from their Doctrines, their Manners and Rites, They were all Knaves and Fools, and in short—Jacobites. Derry down, &amp;c. XVIII “I'll prove, that old Christians could never say true; That he who believes 'em, his Gospel is new; I'll silence whatever Tradition he vaunts With Legends, and Fables,—and Travellers Traunts. Derry down, &amp;c. XIX “On Sacraments, Mysteries, Miracles all You'll see with what decent Expression I fall; The High-flying Churchman altho' it should shock, What signifies that—if it please my own Flock? Derry down, &amp;c. XX “Pray, what were these Fathers that make such a Fuss, But the merest old Mothers and Children to us, Who without a Succession have learnt to succeed, And to save our new Converts without an old Creed? Derry down, &amp;c. XXI “An honest good Protestant freely will ask, What Bus'ness the Church has to set him a Task, Since he can be sav'd without so much ado, Tho' a Stranger to her—and an Infidel too. Derry down, &amp;c. XXII “I'll prove that your Friend is the Pope's younger Brother, Because they both militate one against t'other; That, for the same Reason, your Church's best Friends Are they that will fight for Non-Con. Reverénds. Derry down, &amp;c. XXIII “As I am of the Gospel a Minister made, Of Smut and Profaneness he'll think I'm afraid; But thro' my whole Book the blind Bigot shall see, That under King George we are totally free. Derry down, &amp;c. XXIV “I'll print in great Letters his Majesty's Name, And who then but Rebels can think me to blame? He must be a Felton or French Ravaillac, That falls upon such a prime Minister's Back. Derry down, &amp;c. XXV “To give to a Church or a Priest any Gift, I'll prove is not saving or Protestant Thrift; To give not at all is a Sign of good Sense; True Sterling Devotion—ne'er parts with the Pence. Derry down, &amp;c. XXVI “Queen Anne for poor Clergy establish'd a Pension, And the Consequence future I—dread, Sir, to mention; For should it last always unto the World's End, It will all come to you and your Catholic Friend. Derry down, &amp;c. XXVII “'Tis enough that amongst a huge fabulous Host. I have brought in St. Grat to provide you a Post; The Rats all around he exórcis'd away, And furnish'd my Letter with—something to say. Derry down, &amp;c.

How she would clear us of Hanover Rats! Derry down, &amp;c. XXIX “Then Britain would bargain with France's old Dupe, And we all should be ruin'd as round as a Hoop; Our Wives, Money, Conscience, Estates they would rifle; Were it but the Wives only—that is but a Trifle! Derry down, &amp;c. XXX “And now, Master-Tool, I'll begin to conclude With a Touch on your Rimes, now your Friend is subdu'd; To Prynne in the Dunciad I'll match you at once, And give in my Notes all the Proofs—of a Dunce. Derry down, &amp;c. XXXI “Many different Cities disputed full hard Which of them gave Birth to the Grecian blind Bard; But this Poetaster one cannot disrank, Whose plaguy Prose-Verses have made me look blank. Derry down, &amp;c.

XXXV Now who could refuse such a Challenge as this? The Mill it has ground, and the Verse here it is; And the Zealot of Rochdale, whene'er he thinks proper, May write on, and throw himself—into the Hopper. Derry down, &amp;c. XXXVI In spite of all Mischief that he can contrive, Let Peace and good Neighbourhood flourish and thrive, So—blest be the Hearts of all Manchester Men, And adieu! the Knight Scribbler, Sir LOWBRED O??N. Derry down, down, hey derry down! AGAINST AN UNGALLANT MODERN ROUNDHEAD. Well, Sirs! such a rimer, so horribly stupid, Sure never bore quills against Venus and Cupid. In his hints when the ladies no meaning could find, Now at last in plain terms he has told 'em his mind. “Down with th' Rump” is the business;—whereof the mere letter Has robbed of all patience this impotent fretter. How the spring and the stars make the maggots engender, And wade through the wits of this shallow pretender! 'Tis the year forty-nine too,—so wonder no more At the nonsense revolved of the Roundheads of yore! TO THE EARL OF HARRINGTON: AN APPEAL FOR MERCY. A Fragment. I Applauded Vicerory of Ierne's isle, Spare, for your brother's sake, the poet's style, If an extempore address like this Should aught contain presumptuous or amiss! II Your courteous and obliging turn of mind, With that of other candid nobles joined, Has struck an eager Muse, who cannot yet The joyous talk of yesterday forget. III Three brothers—I shall only speak the truth,— Three brothers, hurried by mere dint of youth, Incautious youth, were found in arms of late, And rushing on to their approaching fate. IV One, in a fever, sent up to be tried, From jail to jail delivered over, died; Sick and distressed, he did not long sustain The mortal shocks of motion and of pain. V The third was then a little boy at school, That played the truant from the rod and rule; The child, to join his brothers, left his book And arms, alas! instead of apples took. VI Now lies confined the poor unhappy lad— For death mere pity and mere shame forbad,— Long time confined, and waiting Mercy's bail Two years amidst the horrors of a jail. VII I spare to mention what, from fact appears, The boy has suffered in these fatal years; Pity, at least, becomes his iron lot;— What ruin is there that a jail has not? VIII He is my countryman, my noble lords, And room for hope your genius affords. Be truly noble; hear a well-meant prayer, And deign my fellow-citizen to spare! IX Think, what the Sovereign Lord of all demands, The King of kings, from His vicegerent's hands; His Will, as ages after ages run, His Holy Will eternally be done! X God grant to every nation every bliss, But, Britons, more especially to this; Lastly, in health and wealth and peace and rest, Thy people, parent Manchester, be blest! TO LADY B? W?, Upon her presenting the Author with the Moiety of a Lottery-Ticket. I “This Ticket is to be divided”.—Well; To Lady Betty let these Presents tell How much I value, Chances all apart, This gentle token of her friendly Heart! Without regard to Prizes or to Blanks, My Obligation is immediate Thanks; And here they come as hearty and as free, As this unlook'd-for Favour came to me. II “Five Thousand Pounds, perhaps, a handsome Sum!” Ay, but in Specie Five may never come! That, as you please, Dame Fortune! In my Mind I have already taken it in kind; Am quite contented with my present Lot, Whether you're pleas'd to second it, or not. Chance is but Chance, however great or small; The Spirit of a loving Gift is all. III Three Tickets offer'd, to make choice of one, And write the Memorandum thereupon, Spread in successive order as they lie:— “May all be Prizes, for her sake,” thought I. That upon which my Fancy chose to fix, Was (let me see) Four hundred fifty-six: Four, five, and six—they are, if I can read, Numbers that regularly should succeed. IV Thou backward Fortune, that in Days of Yore Hast read from six to five, from five to four, Once, for the Lady's sake, reverse thy Spite, And trace a luckier Circle to the right! If thou art angry that I should despise Thy Gifts, which never dazzl'd much my Eyes; Now speak me fair, nor let th' Occasion slip Of such an honourable Partnership! V Stand still a Moment on thy Bridge's Pier, And the Conditions of Success let's hear; Say what the Bard shall offer at thy Shrine,— Any thing less than Worship,—and 'tis thine! If not so quite (as they relate thee) blind, See both our Names, which thus together join'd, I'd rather share Ten Thousand Pounds, I own, Than court thee for ten Millions alone! VI “Thousands and Millions, Sir, are pompous Sounds For Poets, seldom conversant in Pounds.”— Yes; but I'm only looking on th' Event As corresponding to a kind Intent. Should it turn out its Thousands, more or less, I should be somewhat puzzl'd, I profess, And must upon a Case so new, so nice, Fly to my Benefactress for Advice. VII “What shall I do with such a monstrous Prize?” But we'll postpone the Question, till it rise; Let its Tomorrow manage that!—Today, Accept the Thanks which I am bound to pay: Enrich'd, if you permit me still to share Your wish of Welfare, and your gen'rous Care! The greatest Bliss, if I have any Skill, Of human Life is mutual Good-will. VIII This, without Question, has your Hand confest; This, without Flatt'ry, warms a willing Breast; So much good Nature shown with so much Ease, Bestow your Sums, Dame Fortune, where you please! That kind of Satisfaction which I feel, Comes not within the Compass of your Wheel; No Prize can heighten the unpurchas'd Grace, Nor Blanks the grateful Sentiments efface. THOUGHTS ON RIME AND BLANK VERSE. I What a deal of impertinent Stuff at this Time Comes out about Verses in Blank or in Rime, To determine their Merits by critical Prose, And treat the two Parties, as if they were Foes!— Its allotting so gravely, to settle their Rank, All the Bondage to Rime, all the Freedom to Blank, Has provok'd a few Rimes to step forth, and repress The pedantical Whim, grown to such an excess;— II Not to hinder the Dupes of this fanciful Wit From retailing its Maxims, whene'er they think fit; But to caution young Bards, if in danger to waste Any Genius for Verse on so partial a Taste, That, allowing to Blank all the real Pretence To what Freedom it has, if supported by Sense, For Words without any, they may not neglect Of as free flowing Rime the delightful Effect. III Here are two special Terms which the Sophisters mingle, To be Sauce for the rest,—to wit, Fetters, and Jingle; And, because a weak Writer may chance to expose Very ill-chosen Words to such Phrases as those, The unthinking Reflecters sit down to their Rote, And pronounce against Rime th' undistinguishing Vote. Sole Original this, in the petulant School, Of its idle Objections to Metre and Rule! IV For to what other Fetters are Verses confin'd, Whether made up of blank or of metrical Kind? If a Man has not Taste for poetical Lines, Can't he let them alone, and say what he designs Upon some other Points in his unfetter'd Way, And contemn, if he will, all numerical Lay? But the Fashion, forsooth, must affect the Sublime, The Grand, the Pathetic, and rail against Rime. V Blank Verse is the Thing;—tho', whoever tries both, Will find of its Fetters a plentiful Growth; Many Chains to be needful to measure his Ground And keep the Sublime within requisite Bound. If a laudable Product in Rime should, perhaps, Extort an Applause from these exquisite Chaps, They express it so shyly, for fear of a Fetter: “Had the Rime been neglected, it would have been better.” VI And so they begin with their Jingle or Rattle (As some of them call it) the delicate Battle; “The Sense must be cramp'd,” they cry out, “to be sure, By the Nature of Rime, and be render'd obscure.” As if Blank, by its Grandeur and magnified Pause, Was secure in its Freedom from any such Flaws; Tho' so apt in bad Hands to give Readers Offence, By the rattling of Sound and the darkness of Sense! VII All the Arguments form'd, as they prose it along, And twist them and twine against metrical Song, Presuppose the poor Maker to be but a Dunce; For, if that be not true, they all vanish at once. If it be, what Advantage has Blank in the Case From counting bad Verses by Unit or Brace? Nothing else can result from the critical Rout, But “A Blockhead's a Blockhead, with Rime or without.” VIII It came, as they tell us, from ignorant Moors, And by Growth of fine Taste will be turn'd out o'Doors;— Two insipid Conceits, at a Venture entwin'd, And void of all Proof both before and behind! Too old its Reception to tell of its Age; Its Downfall, if Taste could but fairly presage, When the Bees of the Country make Honey no more, Will then certainly come,—not a Moment before. IX Till then it will reign;—and while, here and there spread, Blank Verse, like an Aloë, rears up its Head, And, fresh from the Hot-house, successfully tow'rs To make People stare at the Height of its Flow'rs, The Variety, Sweetness, and Smoothness of Rime Will flourish, bedeck'd by its natural Clime With numberless Beauties, and frequently shoot, If cherish'd aright, into Blossom and Fruit. X But stuffing their Heads, in these classical Days, Full of Homer, and Virgil, and Horace, and Plays, And finding that Rime is in none of the four, 'Tis enough; the Fine-tasters have gotten their Lore. And away they run on with their Words in a String, Which they throw up at Rime with a finical Fling; But to reach its full Sweetness nor willing, nor able, They talk about Taste like the Fox in the Fable. XI To the Praise of old Metre, it quitted the Stage, In Abhorrence of tragical Ranting and Rage, Which, with Heights and with Depths of Distresses enrich'd, Verse and Prose, Art and Nature, and Morals bewitch'd; All the native Agreements of Language disgrac'd, That theatrical Pomp might intoxicate Taste; Still retaining poor Blank, in its Fetters held fast, To bemoan its hard Fate in romantic Bombast. XII 'Tis the Subject, in fine, in the Matter of Song, That makes a blank Verse or a Rime to be wrong. If unjust or improper, unchaste or profane, It disgraces alike all poetical Strain; If not, the Possessor of tunable Skill Unfetter'd, unjingled, may take which he will,— Any Plan, to which Freedom and Judgment impel,— All the Bus'ness he knows, is to execute well. AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND On the Art of English Poetry. Part I. The Art of English Poetry, I find, At present, Jenkins, occupies your Mind; You have a vast Desire to it, you say, And want my Help to put you in the Way; Want me to tell what Books you are to read; How to begin, at first, and how proceed. Now, tho' in Short-hand I may well pretend To give Directions, my Salopian Friend, As having had the Honour to impart Its full Perfection to that English Art,— Which you, and many a sagacious Youth, By sure Experience, know to be the Truth;— Yet how in Matters of poetic Reach, Untaught myself, shall I pretend to teach? Well I remember, that my younger Breast The same Desire, that reigns in yours, possess'd. Me, Numbers flowing to a measur'd Time,— Me, sweetest Grace of English Verse, the Rime,— Choice Epithet, and smooth descriptive Line, Conspiring all to finish one Design, Smit with Delight, full negligent of Prose, And, thro' mere liking, tempted to compose; To rate, according to my Schoolboy Schemes, Ten Lines in Verse worth half a hundred Themes. Without one living Person to consult, The Years went on, from tender to adult; And, as for poring to consult the dead, Truly, that never came into my Head. “Not Homer, Virgil, Horace?” if you ask, Why, yes, the Rod would send me to the Task. But all the Consultation that came out, Had its own End: to scape the whipping Bout. Beside, if Subject wanted to be sung, The Muse was question'd in the vulgar Tongue: Who, if she could not answer well in that, Would hardly mend herself in Greek or Lat. But poor Encouragement for you to hope, That my Instructions will attain the Scope! Yet, since the Help which you are pleas'd to seek, Does not concern the Latin or the Greek,— In ancient Classics tho' but little read, I know, and care as little, what they said— In plain, familiar English for your sake This untried Province I will undertake, And Rules for Verse as readily instil, As if Ability had equall'd Will; Fair Stipulation first on either Side, In Form, and Manner, here annex'd, implied. Conditions are: that, if the Muse should err, You gave th' Occasion, and must pardon her, If aught occur, on sitting down to try, That may deserve the casting of your Eye; If Hint arise, in any Sort, to suit With your Intent—you shall be welcome to't. You may remember, when you first began To learn the truly tachygraphic Plan, How tracing, Step by Step, the simplest Line, We grounded, rais'd, and finish'd our Design; How we examin'd Language and its Pow'rs, And then adjusted ev'ry Stroke to ours; Whilst the same Method, follow'd in the main, Made other Matters more concisely plain; Made English, French, Italian, Hebrew too, Appear the clearest in a Short-hand View,— Which, in all Points where Language was concern'd, Explain'd how best, and soonest, they were learn'd; Shew'd where to end, as well as to commence: At that one, central, point of View—Good Sense. There fix your Eye, then, if you mean to write Verse that is fit to read or to recite! A Poet, slighting this initial Rule, Is but, at best, an artificial Fool; Of learning Verse quite needless the Expense: Plain Prose might serve to show his want of Sense. But you who have it, and would give to Prose The Grace that English Poetry bestows, Consider how the Short-hand Scheme, in Part, May be applied to the poetic Art. To write or read in that, you understood, There must be Sense, and Sense that must be good; The more that Words were proper and exact In Book or Speech, the more we could contract. The Hand, you know, became a kind of Test, In this Respect, what Writings were the best. If incorrect the Language or absurd, It cost the fuller noting of each Word; But, when more apt, grammatical, and true, Full oft a Letter for a Word would do. Form to yourself, directly, the Design Of so constructing a poetic Line, That it may cost in writing it our Way The least Expense of Ink, as one may say; That Word, or Phrase, in Measure that you please, May come the nearest to prosaic Ease! You'll see the Cases from the Rule exempt, Whilst it directs, in gen'ral, your Attempt, How Word or Sentence you may oft transpose, And Verse be still as natural as Prose. “As natural”: for, tho' we call it Art, The Worth in Poetry is Nature's Part. Here “Artis est celare artem”; here Art must be hid, that Nature may appear; So lie conceal'd behind the shining Glass, That Nature's Image may the best repass; All o'er, indeed, must Quicksilver be spread, And all its useless Motion must lie dead. The Art of Swimming—next, that comes to Mind— Perhaps may show you what is here design'd. A young Beginner struggling you may see With all his Might—'twas so at least with me— With all the Splutter of his Limbs to swim, And keep his Brains and Breath above the Brim; Whilst, the more eager he to gain his Art, The sooner ev'ry Limb is thrown athwart; Till by Degrees he learns with less Ado And gentler Stroke the Purpose to pursue. To Nature's Motions poising he conforms, Nor puts th' unwilling Element in Storms; Taught, as the smoother Wave shall yield, to yield, And rule the Surface of the wat'ry Field. Soon as you can, then, learn to lay aside All wild Endeavours against Nature's Tide; Which Way she bends take Notice, and comply; The Verse that will not, burn, or throw it by! Maybe, the Subject does not suit your Skill,— Dismiss, dismiss, till one comes up that will! If Sense, if Nature succour not the Theme, All Art and Skill is Strife against the Stream; If they assist to waft your Verses o'er, Stretch forward, and possess the wish'd-for Shore. 'Twas from a certain native Sense and Wit That came “Poeta nascitur, non fit,”— Adage forbidding any riming Blade, That was not born a Poet, to be made. For, if to sing, in Music, or to hear, Require a natural good Voice or Ear,— If Art and Rule but awkwardly advance, Without a previous, pliant Shape, to dance: Well may the Muse, before she can inspire, Versatile Force of supple Wit require. Of this if Critics should demand a Sign, Strong Inclination should be one of mine. A fair Desire is seldom known to spring, But where there is some Fitness for the Thing. Tho' by untoward Circumstances check'd, There lies a Genius, but without Effect. Many a fine Plant, uncultivated, dies, And worse, with more Encouragement, may rise. “Des Mecænates,”—what had Maro been, Had not Mecænas rais'd the Muse within? Yours, honest Pupil, when you are inclin'd, May versify, according to your Mind. She has no Reason, to no Patron tied, To prostitute her Favours to a Side; Nor to false Taste, if any such the Age Shall run into, to sacrifice her Page; Much less, with any vicious Topic vile, An Art of chaster Offspring to defile. All Verse unworthy of an English Muse Of Short-hand Race she may, and must, refuse. Ancient and modern Aptitude to run Into some Errors, which you ought to shun, Will now and then occasion, I foresee, In Place or out, a Præcipe from me. When this shall happen, never stand to try The Where of its Appearance, but the Why: Lest by Authorities, or old or new, You should be tempted to incur them too; Since the most celebrated Names infer No Sort of Privilege in you to err,— Far from it! Even, where they may excel, Barely to imitate is not so well. Much less should their Authority prevail, Or warrant you to follow, where they fail. 'Tis not to search for Precedents alone, But how to form a Judgment of your own. In writing Verse, that is your main Affair, Main End of all my monitory Care,— Who hate Servility to Common Law That keeps an equitable Right in Awe; By Use and Custom justifies its Lot, Its Modes and Fashions, whether right or not; Cramps the free Genius, clips the Muse's Wing, And to one Poet ties another's String; Producing, from their hardly various Lines, So many Copies and so few Designs. By neither Names nor Numbers be deterr'd; Nor yield to mix amongst the servile Herd; Exert the Liberty which all avow, Tho' Slaves in Practice, and begin just now! Begin with me, and construe what I write, Not to preclude your Judgment, but excite; Just as you once examin'd what I taught, From First to last, with unaddicted Thought: So, while at your Request I venture here To play the Master, see that all be clear; Preserve the Freedom which you always took, Nor, if it teach amiss, regard the Book! Thus, unencumber'd, let us move along, As Road shall lead us, to the Mount of Song; Still keeping, so far by Agreement tied, Good Verse in Prospect, and good Sense for Guide! Part II. Sense presuppos'd, and resolute Intent, To regulate thereby poetic Bent, Let us examine Language once again, As erst we did to regulate the Pen; And then observe how the peculiar Frame Of Words in English may assist your Aim! The End of Speech, vouchsaf'd to human Kind, Is to express Conceptions of the Mind. By painted Speech, or Writing's wond'rous Aid, The Lines of Thought are legibly display'd; In any Place, at any Time, appear, And silent Figure speaks to mental Ear; Surprising Permanence of Meaning found For distant Voice and momentary Sound. Whether by Heav'n at first the huge Effect Reveal'd, or by inventive Wit,—reflect What good may follow, if a Man exert The Talent right, what Ill, if he pervert; And to Exertion, whether good, or bad, What Strength engaging Poetry may add; That, if successful in your present Drift, You may not risk to desecrate the Gift! You see, in speaking, or by Sound or Ink, The grand inceptive Caution is—to think; To measure, ponder, ruminate, digest,— Or Phrase whatever that betokens best A due Attention to make Art and Skill Turn all to Good, or least of all to Ill; Never to give, on any warm Pretence, To just Observers Cause of just Offence. To Truth, to Good, undoubtedly belong The Skill of Poets and the Charms of Song. In Verse or Prose, in Nature or in Art, The Head begins the Movement, or the Heart. If both unite, if both be clear and sound, Then may Perfection in a Work be found; Then does the Preacher, then the Poet shine, And justly take the Title of Divine. By common Sense the World has been all led To make Distinction of the Heart and Head,— Distinction worthy of your keenest Ken In passing Judgment upon Books and Men,— Upon Yourself, before you shall submit To other Judges what Yourself has writ. The Heart, the Head, it may suffice to note, Two diff'rent Kinds of Poetry promote: One, more sublime, more sacred, and severe, That shines in Poetry's celestial Sphere; One, of an useful, tho' an humbler, Birth, That ornaments its lower Globe of Earth. These we shall here ascribe, if you think fit, One to good Sense, the other to good Wit, And grant, that, whichsoever be display'd, It must have something of the other's Aid. Without some Wit, Solidity is dull; As bad the sprightly Nonsense, to the full. To clothe them both in Language, and by Rule, Let us again revise the Short-hand School, And trace the branching Stamens of Discourse From their most plain and primerly Resource! Four Parts of Speech, you know, we us'd to make The best Arrangement, for Enquiry's Sake; And how spontaneous, to determine those, The Noun, the Adnoun, Verb, and Adverb rose! Occurring Hints, but to no Stiffness tied Of formal Method, let these four divide! They do, in Fact, partition out, you know, The Sense of Words, as far as Words can go; For, of a Thing the clear ideal Sense,— The Properties that really spring from thence, Actions, and Modes of Action, that ensue, Must all unite to make the Language true. If false, some one or other of these four Unveils Delusion ent'ring at its Door.— But wonted Lessons I shall here pass by, Trusting to your Remembrance,—and apply. The Noun, the Name, the Substantive, the Thing, Let represent the Subject that you sing,— The main essential Matter, whereupon You mean to set the Muse at Work anon! Ere you begin the Verse that you intend, “Respice finem,”—think upon its End! One single Point, on which you are to fix, Must govern all that you shall intermix; Before you quest for Circumstances round, Peg down, at first, the Centre of your Ground; Each periodic Incident when past, Examine gently whether that be fast! How can you help, if it should e'er come out, Mistaking quite the Point you are about; How, with no Tether fix'd to your Designs, Help incoherent, loose, unmeaning Lines? You need not ask of classic Rome or Greece Whether your Work should all be of a Piece. The Thing is plain, and all that Rule can tell Is—Memorandum to observe it well: To frame, whatever you shall intersperse Of Decoration, well-connected Verse, That shall, whatever may across be spread, From End to End maintain an equal Thread; That Botch, or Patch, or clumsy, awkward Seam Mar not poetic Unity of Theme. This Theme, or Subject, for your English Muse Belongs of right to you and her to choose. Your own unbiass'd Inclinations best The freeer Topics for a Verse suggest. All within Bound of Innocence is free, And you may range, without consulting me, The just, delightful, and extensive Sphere; All else,—what need of Caution to forbear? None;—if the Bards, and some of them renown'd, Had not transgrest and overleapt the Bound. This may indeed bid you to have a Care,— Me, to renew the Warning to beware. While unrestrain'd you set yourself the Task, Let it be harmless, and 'tis all I ask. Some, to be sure, more excellent and grand, Your practic'd Genius may in Time demand. To these in View, no Doubt, you may, in Will, Devote at present your completer Skill; And whilst in little Essays you express, Or clothe a Thought in versifying Dress, On fair Idéas they may turn, and just, And pave the Way to something more august. If well your earlier Specimens intend, From small Beginnings you may greatly end, Write what the Good may praise, as they peruse, And bless, with no unfruitful Fame, the Muse. A youthful Muse, a sprightly one, may crave To intermix the Cheerful with the Grave. Indulge her Choice, nor stop the flowing Stream, Where Verse adorns an inoffensive Theme! Unwill'd Endeavour is the same as faint, And Brisk will languish, if it feel Constraint. From Task impos'd, from any Kind of Force, A stiff, and starch'd Production comes, of course; Unless it suit, as it may chance to do, The present Humour of the Muse, and you,— Sooner, so ask'd, that willing Numbers flow, The more acceptable and àpropos. Tho' prompt, if proper the Occasion rise, Her nimbler Aid no gen'rous Muse denies; But, if a fair and friendly Call invite, Speeds on the Verse to opportune Delight; Cuts all Delays to Satisfaction short, When Friends and Seasons are in Temper for't: As by this present Writing one may see, Dear Muse of mine, is just the Case with thee. A gen'rous Muse, I must again repeat, Disdains the poor, poetical Conceit Of poaching Verse for personal Repute, And writing only to be thought to do't, Without regarding one of its chief Ends,— At once to profit and to pleasure Friends. Tho' to the Bard she dictate first the Line, The Readers Benefit is her Design. Mistaken Poets seek for private Fame; 'Tis gen'ral Use that sanctifies the Name. Be free, and choose what Subject, then, you will, But keep your Readers in Remembrance still,— Your future Judges, tho' 'tis in your Choice In what Committees who shall have a Voice! Their Satisfaction if the Muse prefers, And their Esteem, who justly merit hers, They who do not, however prompt of Throat, Stand all excluded from the legal Vote. Verse, any Readers for whom Verse is writ, May to the Press or to the Flames commit. A Poet signs the Judgment on his Verse, If Readers worthy to be pleas'd rehearse; But, when the Blockheads meddle in the Cause, Laughs at their Blame, and smiles at their Applause. 'Twill add to future versifying Ease To think on Judges whom you ought to please; To fancy some of your selected Friends Discussing Points to which a Subject tends; By whom you guess it would be well discuss'd, And Judgment form'd that you might safely trust. If you conceive them sitting on the Bench, Hints, what is fit to add or to retrench, Anticipating Fancy may supply, And save the Trouble to the real Eye; Judgment awaken'd may improve the Theme With righter Verdict,—tho' the Court's a Dream. THE ORIGIN OF POETRY. ?Poetry at first began And with God's power exhilarated man. A DEFENCE OF RIME. Dear Sir, Tho' friend to rime which you explode, Nevertheless I thank you for your Ode, And Preface also. For my part I choose A plain, familiar, honest, riming Muse, And prize her members far beyond all blanks. Excuse the freedom, and accept the thanks! Musing, moreover, on your printed sheet, Respect suggested that it was but meet, In rime's defence, a rime or two to write,— Lest haply silence should be deem'd a slight: Not with a captious, critical design,— That, Sir, is far from any thought of mine; But in a print of this poetic kind You may expect a man to speak his mind; To own the Justice of the reasons, why You would extirpate rime,—or else reply. 'Tis your permission, then, that I invoke, To guard the Muse from such a fatal stroke. Her aid invok'd in any other task, In this—'tis mine that she is pleas'd to ask; The poet now must lend the Muse an aid And save the right of the melodious maid. You send me here an elegance quite new, A plan from Horace, and well copied too,— As far as chosen epithet and pause Harmonious modulate the lyric clause; As far as native scene thro' ev'ry line Of Roman or of British bard can shine; As far in short as ev'ry grace but one Bedecks the theme that either writes upon,— The Country Life: which Horace in his way, And you in yours, so lyricly display. That one, however, is a special Grace, Tho' Roman Horace could not give it place. His Latin language, fill'd with many more, Wanted not Rime to grace its ample store. But in our own—tho' one should dare to match With Roman Horace British C?,— It would be too too partial to the tongue To say that Rime was needless in the song; Which, tho' in pompous buskin verse declin'd, Is quite essential to the oral kind. Your own attempt—and if another man Thinks he can better your Horatian plan, Let him attempt it!—you, I say, have shewn That lyric pause will hardly do alone, With all the force of emphasis and choice Of word and stop, to pre-engage the voice. Still they who read, and they who hear it read, Hang in suspense—if to be sung or said? Some that I show'd it to, intent to read, Have well begun, but could not well proceed. Well they begun; but, as they went along, They found their prejudice to Rime too strong; Each other grace, when that did not appear, Displeas'd the long-habituated ear; All varied rests, and all descriptions pat Could not compénsate them for want of that. With prefatory page to introduce The new endeavour to correct old use: I doubt you cannot Britishly exempt Lyrics from Rime—tho' welcome the attempt. To old improvements one may give their due, Yet like a genius that but hints at new, In verse or prose to hint one now-a-days I count a matter of no servile praise; Tho' for the reasons that you urge in print I cannot yield to your ingenious hint. The leading maxim which is here embrac'd,— To wit, that rime is certainly false taste,— Is one, to which, if you appeal to me, I cannot yet by any means agree. To this, reserving all the due respect For better information, I object. “Rime is false taste”; and then you add beside: “And what the learnèd ancients all avoid.” What “learnèd ancients”? Let me ask, what “all” Into this taste were so afraid to fall? For, as to those of Greek and Roman stem Avoiding rime,—why, rime avoided them! Nature of language upon riming feet Forbad the two antagonists to meet. This is no more a reason to defame Our rimes in English, than for us to blame The several idioms which those tongues have got And we avoid,—that is, we have them not. “Sameness of measure constantly pursued, And close of periods that still conclude With the same sound, is irksome to the ear,”— This is the reason next asserted here. But are not measures in our Common verse The very same which you yourself rehearse: The soft Iambic—in your phrase—and these The English language falls into with ease. Give, then, to measure, whilst you take the same, Its easy, natural, unirksome claim; Make fair appeal, nor guiltless rime assault For measur'd sameness of Iambic fault; And then let ears decide this single doubt: “Are lyrics irksome with them—or without?” “With them,” you think, “blank metre far excels,” And bring a plain comparison from bells. “Rimes are extremely irksome,”—so you say,— “As bells are irksome, rung the common way; From which, in changes if the ringers ring, Variety and harmony would spring.” Now, bells, when rung in changes, if you will May show in ringers a superior skill; But for the music of their various change Give me the simple tuneful octave range,— Of steepled sounds the plain harmonious part! The rest is all but janglement of art,— Less apt, as hearers I have heard complain, To please an ear, than to disturb a brain. Of this allusion one may then admit, And Rime not suffer, I conceive, a bit. Why recommend, for reasons of this kind, To men of genius, and of vacant mind, To banish rimes in General—to decree The British muse “from Gothic fetters free?” These Gothic fetters all the muses seek In all the tongues but Latin and but Greek: Where verse excels, because they both are blest With fetters more than any of the rest; Can yield to more and stricter rules, in fine, That grace and strengthen the poetic line. Our too neglected language has too few; Yet, as if more were in it than enow, You banish rime,—bid vacant minds provide To lay its chief prerogative aside; That one peculiar beauty you decry Which modern muses are distinguish'd by. Poets, for their encouragement, you paint Less subject now to quantity's restraint Than were the ancients: “to be thus untied Is our advantage on the modern side.” Whereas, in all poetical respect, This one advantage is one great defect,— One source of ruin to the minor clan, Who think verse good verse when they words can scan: By this “advantage” they run hobbling on,— Yea, men of sense sometimes, like Dr. Donne,— With woeful proof what benefit is gain'd By being less to quantity restrain'd. Of all restraints the justest heretofore Less tied the modern bards,—at present more; More ev'ry harsher freedom they coerce, And consequently write much better verse. 'Tis true, they don't in Greek and Latin sort Fix by unvaried rules the long and short Of syllables; but a judicious bard Pays to their quantities the same regard, In length and brevity exact and clear; He wants no precepts, while he has an ear; Wants no advantage, having no complaint Of being subject to the same restraint, Which they who are not subject to, I doubt, For muse and metre, will suppose too stout. What poet, then, would any rime dismiss For such a blank advantage, Sir, as this? You add another, not at all confin'd To hasty dactyle of ignoble kind;— So Dionysius and so Mason term Poor Dactyle's measure, and so you confirm. Severe enough! Imagine he that lists, Wherein its ignobility consists! What I would ask is, why of ancient folks Impose on us their freedoms or their yokes,— Of ancient folks, whose language and its pow'rs Must have so oft a diff'rent turn from ours? 'Tis our own language, Sir, when understood, That tells what freedom, what restraint, is good. 'Tis Mason's task ignobly to asperse The British Muse, who in her dactyle verse, Subjects and measures properly applied, Exerts a grace to Greece and Rome denied. Or inattentive he, or injudicious, To blame her dactyle from his Dionysius! Or say—of metre that you please prefer!— What Dionysius had to do with her? He knew her not; and 'tis a learnèd whim To think that she knew anything of him; Or, if she did, that she would go to seek The rules for English, that he wrote in Greek. Young bards that write most promisingly well, And might in native sense and sound excel, Are oft by ancient pedantry, at last, Lost in the blank of tragical bombast. Who would not wish that they might take in time The grand preservative, the British Rime?— Not to forbid excursion such as this Which you present, nor takes the Muse amiss; But, when you chain her lyrics to your laws, Then she looks blank, and there she makes a pause; As well she may,—if all her stock you vest In blank Iambic, and its varied rest! One edict further if your preface goes, Adieu to poetry, and all is prose; Nor Goth nor Vandal has the muse undone, But you, alas, her rime-distasting son! By fetters, as you call them, Goths design'd Not to enslave, but to relieve the mind; By due recurrence of a kindred sound To give their verse its true harmonious bound; Or, in their sacred or historic rimes, Best to record the work of ancient times; Best to instruct and edify the throng, Or cheer their hearts with memorable song. Tho' rough their speech, and its improvement small, It gave them Rimes, and made amends for all. What language, Sir, in European Sphere, Does not this Gothic force of sound revere? What poet is there whom this critic's haste, Does not condemn for certainly bad taste? Not that I plead prescription, but excuse For not consenting to destroy its use,— Secure of candour in you to dispense With what occurs in honest rime's defence. The vacant minds that come into your views, And think to rescue, will but rob the Muse; If what you call a fashionable chain Is no encumbrance, as you here maintain, But an advantage, which the muse must teach,— A varied rest that ancients could not reach. By your account of Rime one would suppose That the same sound all periods must close. This may be irksome,—but 'tis not the case; For varied rime affords a varied grace. No need of sameness to recur so oft, As does the pause of your Iambic soft; Which tho' you ring no artful changes thro' (The bells for lyric measures are too few); Tho' justly quite and pausingly belyr'd,— The rime is wanting and the ear is tir'd, Tho' tied to quantity,—as if it saw No dispensation for so just a law. Your Country Life will suffer no neglect But that of Rime; yet what is the effect? Why, that without it all the arts beside Cannot resist the torrent of the tide. Descriptive beauties that with Horace vie In British lyrics, want the British tie; All are dispers'd without this tie across, And ev'ry scatter'd beauty mourns its loss,— A loss which, if you think it worth your care, A skill like yours can easily repair. (Distaste of rime if you can once get o'er, And then retract, to “certify” no more,) Can leave to plays and fictions blank sublime, And take your Virgil's glowing warmth and rime. If still averse, consider, Sir, how hard From rime it is to wean a riming bard; The danger too that partly you foretell Of an affected pomp and painful swell,— Too plain at present, and too likely lot Of future blank attempters;—but, if not, Who will assist the poor Goth-fetter'd muse, If you yourself cry rescue—and refuse? Who will support your sentiment, if true, Or give a fairer sample than you do? Or true or false, whatever one may say, Fairly proposed, it ought to have fair play. One thing, in fine, we both of us may think: “Let rime, if reason be against it, sink. But, if on reason rime bestows a grace, Flourish the verse that gives them both a place!” Thus, Sir, with freedom and without disguise, I speak my simple notions as they rise,— Less willing to object against your plan, Than to receive conviction, if I can. But where a friend requires, I think it just To play the critic and fulfil the trust; And then, for fear of being prepossest, I leave the judgment to my friend's own breast. P.S.— Since this, as yours, induced me on the book Of ancient Horace to bestow a look,— Led like a packhorse by preceding chimes, To tread the tract, the beaten tract, of rimes,— I pick'd up such as lay upon the road, To fit the gen'ral topics of his Ode, To please the sense, while in her riming cue, Not with intent to vie with him or you; For you may find much greater fault in this, Than I in yours.—However, here it is. I Happy the mortal who can now, Like men of ancient set, With his own oxen acres plough Paternal, clear of Debt! II He neither hears the trump of war, Nor dreads the raging main, The clamours of the noisy Bar, Nor haughty Cit's disdain. III Shoots of his own luxuriant vine With poplars pleas'd to wed, Useless to lop, or, if they pine, Plant happier in their stead; IV To view his lowing herds that roam Around the valley deep; To press the honey from the comb, Or shear his languid sheep. V Now, stretch'd some agèd oak beside, Now, in th' imprinted grass, While from the rocks the waters glide, He hears the feather'd class. VI Woods echo still their plaintive song; Brooks murmur through the fields; To gentle slumbers, laid along, The happy rustic yields. VII Soon as th' autumnal Year prepares The weather's wint'ry store, With many a dog to destin'd snares He drives the bristly boar; VIII Or net suspends in slender poles, To catch delightful game: The tim'rous hare, or bird that prowls Voracious, wild or tame. IX While thus amus'd, and thus employ'd, Who is there that would heed, Would all the mischiefs dire abide, That love is wont to breed? X Or, if a chaste, endearing wife His rural bliss shall share, She cheers the neat domestic life, Sweet prattling babes her care. XI With smoth'ring warmth prepared to burn, The dry old log she lays, And, if her weary spouse return, Revives the focal blaze. XII Of folded flocks, from dales and hills, The milky treasure stor'd, Fresh clean-brew'd wine she draws, and fills With cheer unbought the board. And here, the Muse, retiring, bid me note, The rural Epode ends that Horace wrote. This, Sir, to me, I must confess, was new, Strange at first thought, but upon second true. “Non me Lucrina juverint conchylia,” Looks of his muse so like another filia, That, if you turn to Horace, you may find Sufficient reasons to be of my mind. Another verse, tho' both for measure twins, On “fenerator Alfius” begins. “Beatus ille” had completed quite, The rural day's description with its night; Too late, too botching on a fair survey, The forc'd and stiff transition to—“Non me”; Where Horace paints an usurer grown warm About his own, and not another's form. His “oves, boves, vernae, lares,” all Bespeak the landlord at his country hall, Struck with a sudden sense of homely bliss, That avarice soon taught him to dismiss. Another topic and another style Begins your own: “Great Britain, plenteous isle!” Just imitator, fairly you forbore To force coherence with what went before; “My fleecy care,” as rightly you explain, “My wearied oxen,” and “my vassal train,” Give a distinctive hint, from whence to date The speech relating to the miser's fate. More likely, then, that to a diff'rent song “Beatus ille” and “Non me” belong. In one, the poet on description bent, The country life exhausted his intent: A fair sufficient and well finish'd theme, Take it without the “fenerator” seam. Another subjeet was the money'd squire, When gentle satire touch'd the poet's lyre, Play'd off a speech more suitably concise To a short fruitless interval of vice. And yet, in length (for here, one may forebode Objection) equal to the following Ode; Same measure too, or, if insisted on, Some other reasons why the Ode is one. They best account for the mistake, who threw Into one Ode what Horace meant for two. Brief,—to the miser his “Non me” award, His own “Beatus ille” to the bard! VERSES ON THE ATTACK UPON ADMIRAL BYNG IN THE “MONITOR.” Wednesday, March 16th, 1757. I What Monitor's here! What a British Freeholder! Of judgment and death what a merciless moulder! Whether Admiral Byng has been guilty or not, Has deserv'd to be spar'd or deserv'd to be shot, No British freeholder who holds himself free, Is oblig'd to determine before he can see, And pursue him with keen British foxhunter's hurry, Who, when he gives law, is determin'd to worry. II To soften law's rigours by equity's plan Humanity often admonishes man; Too apt to forget his own shortness of breath, And to hasten, for others, the sentence of death,— Very seldom oppos'd, when the crime is so plain That the known to be guilty deserve to be slain; But when it is doubtful, all freedom and sense Will, before execution, choose proper suspense. III If the name of a paper can make a man wiser, Of “British Freeholder,” or “Night Advertiser,” Byng must be dispatch'd; and it does mighty well, For the mob to be pleas'd, and the paper to sell. But, if justice, and wisdom, and value for laws Whose sounds are so urg'd in so killing a cause, Are to have their true meaning, the Monitor's haste In the British freeholders will raise a distaste. IV What sense in his motto? Though, choosing of that, To be sure Overshooter would seek the most pat. “'Tis a sample of wisdom that guarded the King And secur'd his good subjects”;—apply it to Byng! “Our laws,” says the motto, “shall suffer no change.” Now, if Byng must be shot, sure the logic is strange; For nothing condemn'd him, his judges all saw, But a change that had lately been made in the law. V Though oblig'd to interpret the article thus By “Summum” (or “Summa injuria”) “jus,” Their notion of justice (which ought to be, still, The intent of the law, though its letter should kill) Which conscience inspir'd in so hard an affair, Occasion'd from them an unanimous pray'r, That a mercy so just in his case might be shown, And themselves be reliev'd by the voice of the Throne. VI Will the treating of conscience, and of the Court-martial, In the Monitor's strain, as if all had been partial, Forbid one to see, in this Admiral's case, A reason sufficient for respiting grace? How oft does an object, whom judges report Who yet have condemn'd him, find mercy at court? “A comméndable attribute this, to be sure!”— Why, then, when a Court so desires, it abjure? VII If not to be shown to so strong a request, When must it prevail in monarchical breast? A King, it should seem, has express'd a desire, On the fairest occasion, for time to enquire,— And a Monitor comes, with his duty turn'd sour, To talk to freeholders of absolute pow'r; That mercy may yield to the voice of the crowd, Not because it is right, but because it is loud. VIII And what proof has he brought for the merciless side? “Why, the people condemn'd him, before he was tried! Their resentment was just at the very first brunt; But the Court, if it durst have acquitted, had done't, For private acquaintance,” the Monitor knows, “They proceeded to hazard the public repose, And the union of King and of subjects so good”: Whose cement, as it seems, was the Admiral's blood.— IX Now, had it been true that this laudable nation Was never misled by misrépresentation, It were something; or else, why should Admirals die To secure the repose of a popular cry? The one single fact for which mercy's denier Can quote this harangue of a popular cryer, Who measures the wisdom of nation and throne By cruel conceits which he has of his own! X Whether sailors condemn'd an unfortunate brother, Because, as he hints it, they durst do no other; Whether urging of conscience was wrong, or was right, Though, according to him, it had reason to smite; Whether twenty surmises that readers may meet, When a man must amuse them and fill up his sheet, Have a ground or no ground whereupon to believe: What chance for the knowing, without a reprieve? XI Should mercy rekindle so gentle a spark Will the man run away, thinks he, from the Monarque? Or will justice be hurt, if a proper delay Should banish all doubt that he had not fair play? “But a merciful turn will be thought somewhat worse In the ages to come.”—What a notion to nurse! Of human condemners all history's pages Secure, to the slow, the applause of all ages. XII So much for the Monitor, sent yesterday, And reflexions upon it that fell in one's way! As a servant came for it this morning, perhaps, It has pass'd through the hands of more politic chaps; Who change not their laws, but will hear the man teach How to snatch at a sentence—but just within reach; Though the freehold belongs, of so legal a snatch, No none but the race of—Johannes de Catch! REMARKS ON DR. BROWN'S ESTIMATE. Written in the Character of a Lady. I The Book appears, to my perusing Sight, So rambling, scrambling, florid, and polite, That, tho' a manly skill may trace the Clue, A simple Female knows not what to do:— Where to begin Remark, or where to close, Lost in a thousand—Beauties, I suppose. II One seeming Proof of such a Coalition Of num'rous Beauties is—a fifth Edition; As, reading Authors, I have just now found In the Whitehall: “Price Three and Six-pence, bound.” Many a good Book, but less of Print concise, Less clean of Margin, sells for half the Price. III So that the Nation grows in Books, 'tis plain, “Luxurious, effeminate and vain”: That is, the Purchasers,—or, if I durst, I would have said the Writers of 'em first; And the “luxuriant” Framer of this Plan, First of the first, should be the leading Man. IV Somewhere, before the Middle of the Book, It seems, the Author, whom I really took But for a Politician, was in fine, To my Surprise, a Protestant Divine,— A Protestant Divine, in whose high Flight The “Question capital” is: “Who shall fight?” V Not, “Who shall pay?”—as some Divines have plann'd, One has heard tell, “the capital Demand”;— Both needless Questions, when Divines arose Who neither sued their Friends, nor fought their Foes. Now, what more “vain, effeminate, luxurious,” Than Parson's Talk, so “capitally” furious? VI Truly, the Works of Distaff and of Needle Are worth whole Volumes of courageous Tweedle, With the Sum total: “Britons! all be free; “Take the Brown Musket up, and follow me; Let us be strong, be hardy, sturdy, rough; Till we are all beatified in Buff.” VII With Manners just the same, as we are told, Men are effeminate, and Women bold. If aught like Satire, or like Ridicule, Should seem to rise, we must apply this Rule To solve the Case—and so, I think, we may— “It comes from Folly's natural Display.” VIII Person and Dress is left us to apply, And little else, to know the Sexes by. Characteristics, formerly made out, Are now confounded by a present Rout: All would be lost, if, as the Cassock warm, With Rage as just the Petticoat should arm. IX But while Men fight, both clergyfied and lay, Who left but Women to cry: “Let us pray!” While Men are marshalling in Prose Pindaric Religion, Virtue, Warburton, and Garrick, Women must pray, that Heav'n would yet annex Some little Grace to the Talk-valiant Sex. X “Love of our Country” is the manly Sound That clads in Armour all the Virtues round. Where is this lovely Country to be sought? Why, 'tis Great Britain in their little Thought; And the two States, which these Divines advance, The Heav'n of England, and the Hell of France. XI Women must pray; and,—if Divines can reach No higher a Theology,—must preach. This World—this Sea-bound Spot of it—may seem The central Paradise, in Men's Esteem, Who have great Souls; but Women, who have none, Have other Realms to fix their Hearts upon. XII If such there be, the only certain Scheme To guard against each possible Extreme Is to put on, amidst the World's Alarms. With a good Heart, our real Country's Arms: Faith, Hope, and Patience, from the Tow'rs above, All-bearing Meekness, and all-conqu'ring Love. REMARKS ON A PAMPHLET ENTITLED EPISTLES TO THE GREAT, FROM ARISTIPPUS IN RETIREMENT In a Letter to Dr. S?. Doctor, this new poetic Species Semel may do, but never decies: For a Chapelle, or a Chaulieu, The new-devis'd Conceit may do; In rambling Rimes La Farre and Gresset, And easy Diction, may express it; Or Madam's Muse, Deshoulières, Improve it farther still than theirs; But, in the Name of all the Nine, Will an epistolary Line In English Verse and English Sense Admit, to give them both Offence, The Gaul-bred Insipiditee Of this new fangl'd Melodee? Indeed, it won't.—If Gallic Phrase Can bear with such enervate Lays, Nor “Pleasure,” nor “Pain-pinion'd Hours” Can ever suffer them in ours, Or, “Ivy-crown'd,” endure a Theme “Silver'd with Moonshine's Maiden Gleam;” Not tho' so “garlanded,” and “flow'ry,” So “soft,” so “sweet,” so “Myrtle-bow'ry,” So “balmy,” “palmy,”—and so on,— As is the Theme here writ upon; Writ in a Species that, if taking, Portends sad future Verse-unmaking. Brown's “Estimate of Times and Manners,” That paints Effeminacy's Banners, Has not a Proof in its Detail More plain than this, if this prevail. Forbid it sense, forbid it Rime, Whether familiar, or sublime; Whether ye guide the Poet's Hand To easy Diction or to grand; Forbid the Gallic Namby-Pamby Here to repeat its crazy Crambe! One Instance of such special Stuff, To see the Way on't, is enough,— Excus'd for once; if Aristippus Has any more within his Cippus, Let him suppress, or sing 'em, He, With “gentle Muse, sweet Euterpee;” Free to salute her, while they chirp, For easier Riming “sweet Euterp.” It is allow'd, that Verse, to please, Should move along with perfect Ease; But this coxcombically mingling Of Rimes unriming, interjingling, For Numbers genuinely British, Is quite too finical and skittish, But for the masculiner Belles, And the polite He Me'moiselles; Whom “Dryads,” “Naiads,” “Nymphs,” and “Fauns,” “Meads,” “Woods,” and “Groves,” and “Lakes,” and “Lawns,” And “Loves,” and “Doves,”—and fifty more Such jaded Terms, besprinkl'd o'er With compound Epithets uncouth, Prompt to pronounce 'em Verse, forsooth! Verse let 'em be; tho', I suppose, Some Verse as well might have been Prose, That “England's common Courtesy Politely calls good Poetry.” For, if the Poetry be good, Accent at least is understood: Number of Syllables alone, Without the proper Stress of Tone, Will make our Metre flat and bare, As Hebrew Verse of Bishop Hare. Add, that Regard to Rime is gone, And Verse and Prose will be all one; Or, what is worse, create a Pother, By Species neither one nor t'other; A Case, which there is Room to fear From Dupes of Aristippus here. The fancied Sage, in feign'd Retreat, Laughs at the Follies of the Great, With Wit, Invention, Fancy, Humour Enough to gain the Thing a Rumour. But if he writes, resolv'd to shine In unconfin'd and motley Line, Let him pindaric it away, And quit the lazy labour'd Lay; Leave to La Farre, and to La France, The warbling, soothing Nonchalance!— When will our Bards unlearn, at last, The puny Stile, and the Bombast; Nor let the pitiful Extremes Disgrace the Verse of English Themes; Matter no more in Manner paint Foppish, affected, queer, and quaint; Nor bounce above Parnassian Ground, To drop the Sense, and catch the Sound,— Except in writing for the Stage, Where Sound is best for buskin'd Rage; Except in Operas, where Sense Is but superfluous Expense? Be then the Bards of sounding Pitch Consign'd to Garrick and to Rich; To Tweedledums and Tweedledees The singy-songing “Euterpees!” REMARKS UPON DR. AKENSIDE'S AND MR. WHITEHEAD'S VERSES, WHICH WERE PUBLISHED AND ADDRESSED TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND, IN THE YEAR 1758. I “Whither is Europe's ancient Spirit fled?” How came this Query in the Doctor's Head? “Whither is Britain's?”—one had sooner guess'd, In Ode to his own Countrymen address'd; But, as outlandish Rivers soon infer it, (Six, in three Lines) it must be Europe's Spirit. II Of “valiant Tenants of her Shore,” 'tis said, “Who from the warrior Bow the strong Dart sped;”— Let Bow be “Warrior,” and let Dart be “strong,” Verse does not “speed” so speedily along; “The strong Dart sped”—does but go thump, thump, thump, That quick as thrown should pierce the Liver plump. III “And with firm Hand the rapid Poleaxe bore.”— If it had been “the rapid Dart” before, And “the strong Poleaxe, here, it had agreed With a firm Hold as well, and darting speed. Whither are fled from Ode-Versification The ancient “Pleasures of Imagination?” IV Really these fighting Poets want a Tutor To teach them “Ultra crepidam ne Sutor;” To teach the Doctor, and to teach the Laureate, “Ex Helicone sanguinem ne hauriat;” Tho' Blood and Wounds infect its limpid Stream, It should run clear before they sing a Theme. V Ye “Britons rouse to Deeds of Death!”—says one; “Whither,” the next, “is Europe's Spirit gone?” While real Warriors think it all a Farce For them to bounce of either Mors or Mars; Safe as one sacks it under bloodless Bay, And sure as t'other even Death must pay. VI But you shall hear what Captain ????? said, When he had heard both Ode and Verses read: On Mottos “Versibus exacuit” And “Proles militum” he mus'd a bit; Then, having cast his hunting Wits about, In quest of Rimes, he thus, at last, broke out: VII “Poh! Let my Serjeant, when his Dose is taken, “Britons strike Home!” with moisten'd Pipe rehearse: To “Deeds of Death” 'twill sooner much awaken, Than a Cart-Load full of such Ode and Verse. “If these two Bards will by a tuneful Labour Show, without sham, their Love to killing Life, Let Akenside go thump upon the Tabor, And Whitehead grasp th' exacuating Fife!” ON THE PATRON OF ENGLAND; In a Letter to Lord Willoughby, President of the Antiquarian Society. I Will you please to permit me, my very good Lord, Some Night when you meet upon ancient Record, Full worthily filling Antiquity's Throne To propose to your Sages a Doubt of my own,— A certain moot Point of a national Kind? For it touches all England to have it defin'd With a little more Fact, by what Kind of a Right Her Patron, her Saint, is a Cappadox Knight? II I know what our Songs and our Stories advance, That St. George is for England, St. Denys for France; But the French, tho' uncertain what Denys it was. All own he converted and taught 'em their Mass; And most other Nations, I fancy, remount To a Saint, whom they chose upon some such Account, But I never could learn, that for any like Notion, The English made Choice of a Knight Cappadocian. III Their Conversion was owing (Event, one would hope, Worth rememb'ring at least) to a Saint and a Pope,— To a Gregory known by the First, and the Great, Who sent, to relieve them from Pagan Deceit, St. Austin the Monk; and both Sender and Sent Had their Days in old Fasti that noted th' Event. Now, my Lord, I would ask of the Learn'd and Laborious, If Ge-orgius ben't a Mistake for Gregorius. IV In Names so like-letter'd it would be no Wonder If hasty Transcribers had made such a Blunder; And Mistake in the Names, by a Slip of their Pen, May perhaps have occasion'd Mistake in the Men. That this has been made, to omit all the rest, Let a Champion of yours, your own Selden, attest: See his Book upon Titles of Honour, that Quarter Where he treats of St. George and the Knights of the Garter. V There he quotes from Froissart, how at first, on the Plan Of a Lady's blue Garter, blue Order began, In one thousand three hundred and forty and four. But the Name of the Saint in Froissart is Gregore: So the Chronicle Writer or printed or wrote For George, without Doubt, says the marginal Note. Be it there a mistake!—But, my Lord, I'm afraid That the same, vice-versâ, was anciently made. VI For tho' much has been said by the great Antiquarian Of an Orthodox George, Cappadocian and Arian: “How the Soldiers first came to be Patron of old, I have not,” says he, “Light enough to behold.” A Soldier-like Nation, he guesses (for want Of a Proof that it did so) would choose him for Saint; For in all his old Writings no Fragment occurr'd That saluted him Patron, 'till Edward the Third. VII His Reign he had guess'd to have been the first Time, But for old Saxon Prose and for old English Rime, Which mention a George, a great Martyr and Saint, Tho' they say not a Word of the Thing that we want. They tell of his Tortures, his Death, and his Pray'r, Without the least Hint of the question'd Affair: That Light, I should guess, with Submission to Selden, As he was not the Patron, he was not beheld in. VIII The Name in French, Latin, and Saxon, 'tis hinted, Some three or four Times, is mis-writ or mis-printed; He renders it George;—but, allowing the Hint, And the Justice of Change both in Writing and Print, Some George by like Error (it adds to the Doubt) Has turn'd our Converter St. Gregory out. He, or Austin the Monk, bid the fairest by far To be Patron of England, till Garter and Star. IX In the old Saxon Custom of crowning our Kings, As Selden has told us, amongst other Things They nam'd in the Pray'rs which his Pages transplant, The Virgin, St. Peter, and one other Saint, Whose Connection with England is also exprest, And yields in this Case such a probable Test, That, a Patron suppos'd, we may fairly agree Such a Saint is the Person, whoever it be. X Now, with Mary and Peter, when Monarchs are crown'd, There is only a Sanctus Gregorius found; And his Title Anglorum Apostolus too, With which a St. George can have nothing to do. While Scotland and Ireland and France and Spain claims A St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Denys, St. James, Both Apostle and Patron—for Saint so unknown Why should England reject an Apostle her own? XI This, my Lord, is the Matter. The plain simple Rimes Lay no Fault, you perceive, upon Protestant Times. I impute the Mistake, if it should be one, solely To the Pontiffs succeeding, who christen'd Wars holy,— To Monarchs, who madding around their round Tables, Preferr'd to Conversion their Fighting and Fables. When Soldiers were many, good Christians but few, St. George was advanc'd to St. Gregory's Due. XII One may be mistaken, and therefore would beg That a Willis, a Stukeley, an Ames, or a Pegge,— In short, that your Lordship and all the fam'd Set Who are under your Auspices happily met, In perfect good Humour—which you can inspire, As I know by Experience—would please to enquire, To search this one Question, and settle, I hope: “Was Old England's Old Patron a Knight, or a Pope?” AN EPISTLE TO J. BL?K?N, ESQ., Occasioned by a Dispute concerning the Food of St. John the Baptist. I The Point, Mr. Bl?k?n, disputed upon,— “Whether Insects, or Herbs, were the Food of St John,”— Is a singular Proof how a learnèd Pretence Can prevail with some Folks over natural Sense,— So consistent with Herbs, as you know was allow'd. But the Dust that is rais'd by a critical crowd Has so blinded their Eyes, that plain, simple Truth Is obscur'd by a Posse of Classics, forsooth! II Diodorus and Strabo, Solinus and Ælian, And Authorities down from the Aristotelian, Have mention'd whole Clans that were wont to subsist, In the East, upon Locusts as big as your Fist. “Ergo, so did the Baptist.”—Now, were it all true That Reporters affirm (but not one of them knew),— What follows but Hear-say how Savages eat, And how Locusts sometimes are Necessity's Meat? III If, amongst their old Tales, they had chanc'd to determine That the Jews were accustom'd to feed on these Vermin, It would have been something; or, did they produce Any one single Hermit that stor'd them for Use, Having pick'd 'em and dried 'em, and smok'd in the Sun, (For this, before eating, they tell us was done), The Example were patter than any they bring To support such an awkward, improbable Thing, IV Hermitical Food the poetical Tribe Of Classics have happen'd sometimes to describe: And their native Descriptions are constantly found To relate, in some Shape, to the Fruits of the Ground. If exception occurs, one may venture to say, That the Locust Conceit never came in their Way,— Or let its Defender declare, if he knows, Any one single Instance, in Verse or in Prose! V “But the Word which the Text has made Use of,” 'tis said, “Means the animal Locust, wherever 'tis read,— Of a Species which Jews were permitted to eat. There is therefore no Need of a plantal Conceit, Of Tops, Summits, or Buds, Pods, or Berries of Trees; For to this,” the sole Proof is, “no Classic agrees; And the Latin ‘Locustæ’ came only from want Of Attention to signify ‘Tops of a Plant.’” VI It would take up a Volume to clear the Mistakes Which, in this single Case, classic Prejudice makes, Thro' Attachment to Writers who pass a Relation Which others had sign'd without Examination;— As the Authors have done who have read and have writ That Locusts are Food which the Law did permit; And the Place which they quote for a Proof that it did, Is one that will prove them expressly forbid. VII I appeal to the Hebrew, and for the Greek Word To the twenty-first Iliad, where once it occurr'd, And where the old Prince of the Classics, one sees, Never once thought of Insects, but Branches of Trees, As the Context evinces; tho', all to a Man, Translators adopt the Locustical Plan. How the Latin “Locustæ” should get a wrong Sense Is their Business to prove who object the Pretence. VIII But the classical Greek, tho' it often confirm, Cannot always explain, a New Testament Term, Any more than an Old one; and, therefore (to pass All Authorities by of a paganish Class) Let them ask the Greek Fathers, who full as well knew Their own Tongue and the Gospel, which Meaning is true? But for “Insects” to find a plain Proof in their Greek Will cut a Librarian out Work for a Week. IX For “Herbs” here is one, which, unless it is match'd, Ought to carry this Question as fairly dispatch'd. Isidorus, Greek Father of critical Fame, Has a Letter concerning this very Greek Name, Dismissing the Doubt which a Querist had got, “If the Baptist did eat Animalcules or not?” “God Forbid,” says the Father, “a Thing so absurd! ‘The Summits of Plants’ is the Sense of the Word.” X Such an ancient Decision, so quite à propos, Disperses at once all the Classical Show Of a Learning that builds upon Africa's East And the Traunts, how wild People were fabl'd to feast Upon fancied huge Locusts, which never appear— Or huge or unhuge—but five Months in the Year, To be hoarded, and pickled in Salt and in Smoke.— How Saint John is employ'd by these critical Folk! XI Where the Locust could feed, such an abstinent Saint Of Food for his Purpose could never have Want. If the Desert was sandy and made such a Need, How account for the Locusts descending to feed? In short, Mr. Bl?k?n, they cannot escape The Charge of “absurd,” in all Manner of Shape. If they can, let them do it! Meanwhile, I conclude That St. John's was the plantal, not animal, Food. XII Thus, Sir, I have stated, as brief as I'm able, The friendly Debate that we had at your Table; Where the kind Entertainer, I found, was inclin'd,— And acknowledge the Pleasure,—to be of my Mind; Having only to add, now I make my Report, That, howe'er we may differ in Points of this Sort, Our Reception at Orford all pleas'd we review, And rejoice in the Health of its Master.— Adieu! THREE EPISTLES TO G. LLOYD, ESQ., ON THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE IN HOMER: ?????? ??? ?????? ???????, ??? ????? ??????. ????? ?????? ??????? ????? ????????? ?????? ?????, ???? ?? ????? ?????? ??????? ???????. Iliad. A, vv. 50–52. He first attacked (with his darts) the mules and the swift-footed dogs. But next sending forth against (the men) themselves his piercing missile he smote them, and frequent pyres were constantly being lit for the dead. EPISTLE I. I Thus Homer, describing the pestilent Lot That among the Greek Forces Apollo had shot, Tells how it began, and who suffer'd the first, When his ill-treated Priest the whole Army had curst,— Or rather, what suffer'd; for Custom computes That Apollo's first Shafts fell amongst the poor Brutes, Instructing both Critics to construe and Schools “????? ???????” “the Dogs,” and “??????” “the Mules.” II Now, observing old Homer's poetical Features, I would put in one Word for the guiltless dumb Creatures,— And the Famous blind Bard; for, as far as I see, The learn'd in this Case are much blinder than he. At the Mules and the Dogs, in his versified Greek, Nor Phœbus nor Priest had conceiv'd any Pique; And I doubt, notwithstanding the common Consent, That the Meaning is miss'd which Mæonides meant. III Why the Brutes were first plagu'd, an Eustathius and others Have made a great Rout, with their physical Pothers Of the Nature, and Causes, and Progress of Plague,— And all to the Purpose quite foreign, and vague. But be medical Symptoms whatever they will, Such Matters I leave to Friend Heberden's Skill, And propose a plain Fact to all cunninger Ken: “That the ‘Mules,’ and the ‘Dogs,’ in this Passage, are ‘Men.’” IV Just then, as they rise, to explain my Ideas:— Let the Lexicon tell what is meant by ??????; In plain common-Sense, without physical Routs, “The Grecian Outguards, the Custodes, or Scouts.” The Word may be “Mules” too, for aught that I know, For my Scapula says, “'tis, Ionicè, so;” And refers to the Lines above quoted from Homer, Where “Mules,” I conceive, is an arrant Misnomer. V If a Word has two Meanings, to critical Test That which makes the Sense better is certainly best. The Plague is here plainly describ'd to begin In the Skirts of the Camp, then to enter within, To rage, and occasion what Iliad styles “Incessantly burning their funeral Piles;” Which the Greeks, I conjecture, were hardly such Fools As to burn, or erect, for the Dogs and the Mules. VI The common Greek Word, the Homerical too, For “Mules” is “‘???????,” where it will do; And there was, as it happened, no Cause to coerce Its Use in this Place, for it suited the Verse. Whereas a plain Reason oblig'd to discard, If this was the Point to be shown by the Bard, That first to the Parties about the main Camp Apollo despatch'd the vindicative Damp. VII Thus much for “??????.”—The meaning of “?????” Is attended, I own, with a little more Newness; For the Sense, in this Place, will oblige us to plant A meaning for “?????” which Lexicons want. And, if that be a Reason for some to reject, 'Tis no more than Correction, tho' just, may expect; “But if it be just,” the true Critics will add, “'Tis a Meaning that Lexicons ought to have had.” VIII Both “Canes” in Latin, and “?????” in Greek, And the Hebrew Word for them, if Critics would seek, Should be rendered, sometimes, in Prose-writers or Bards, By “Slaves,” or by “Servants,” “Attendants,” or “Guards:” “??????” and “?????” have here, in my Thought, Much a like Kind of meaning, as really they ought; The Diff'rence, perhaps, that, for Camp-Preservation, One mov'd, or patroll'd, while the other kept Station. IX “??????,” which is “white,” in the commonest Sense, To describe the Dogs here has no Sort of Pretence; Nor here will the Lexicons help a dead Lift, That allow the odd Choice too of “slow,” or of “swift.” If the Dogs were demolish'd, 'twill certainly follow That “white, slow,” or “swift,” was all one to Apollo; Whose fam'd Penetration was rather too deep Than to take Dogs for Soldiers, as Ajax did Sheep. X Why them, or why “Mules”? For Description allows That he shot at no Horses, Bulls, Oxen, or Cows, With a Vengeance selecting, from all other Classes, Poor Dogs of some Sort, and impeccant Half-Asses. Now, granting, what Poem shows plainly enough, That Homer abounds with nonsensical Stuff, Yet it should, for his Sake, if it can, be confin'd To the Pagan, and not the Poetical, Kind. XI The “Mules” and the “Dogs,” being shot at, coheres No better with Sense, than the Bulls and the Bears. To excúlpate old Homer, my worthy Friend Lloyd, Some Sort of Correction should here be employ'd; And, for Languages' Sake,—in which Matters are spread Of a greater Concern, if old Writers are read,— Where it seems to be wanting, the Critics should seek To make out fair English for Latin or Greek. XII If the Words have a Meaning both human and brute, Where Homer describes his Apollo to shoot, Tho' “brute” in the Latin possesses the Letter, I take it for granted that human is better. Do you think this a fair Postulatum?—“I do; “But you only affirm that the ‘human’ is true.”— That's all that I want in this present Epistle; In the next I shall prove it, as clear as a Whistle. EPISTLE II. I. Your Consent, I made bold to suppose, in my last, To a fair Postulatum had readily pass'd: “That a mulish Distemper, or that a caníne, Neither suited Apollo's nor Homer's Design, Like making the Subjects who felt its first Shock, To be Men like their Masters, tho' baser of Stock.” Now, Proof at the present comes under the Pen, That “??????,” and “?????,” may signify “Men.” II. You'll draw the Conclusion so fair and so just, That if they may do it, they certainly must. It would look with an unphilosophical Face, And anti-Rawthmelian, to question the Case. Tho' the Proofs of this Point, which I formerly noted, Have slipt my Remembrance and cannot be quoted, From Homer himself it may chance to appear, As I promis'd to make it, no Whistle more clear. III. That ?????? are “Guards” in Iliadal Lore, You may see in Book Kappa, Line eighty-and-four; Where the wise Commentators confess in their Rules, That “Here it is ‘Guards,’” not “???????,” “Mules.” Being join'd with “???????,” “Companions,” they knew As “???????” were Men, that ?????? were too. Now let us illústrate the combated Place, As near as we can, by a Parallel Case. IV. Plain Sense as I take it, if once it is shown That Homer opposes to “being alone” Having two “????? ?????” along with an Hero, Will call 'em “Companions,” not “Dogs,” in Homero. Turn then to his Odyssey, Beta, Line ten, Where “Dogs,” as they call 'em, are certainly “Men,” Attended by whom (he will second who seeks) Telemachus went to a Council of Greeks. V. With his Sword buckl'd on, and a Spear in his Hand, He went (having summon'd) to meet the whole Band; So bravely set forth, so equipt, and so shod, That, as Homer has phras'd it, “he look'd like a God:” “Not alone”—to enhance the Description of Song,— “But he took with him two ‘????? ??????’ along,”— “Two swift-footed Dogs?” Yes! Two Puppies, no Doubt, That Apollo had sav'd from the general Rout! VI. One can but reflect how we live in an Age That scruples the Sense of all sensible Page, Any Kind of old Nonsense more pleas'd to admit, If in Homer, or Virgil, or Horace 'tis writ. But yet, to do Justice to these, and the rest Of the poor pagan Poets, it must be confess'd, That Time, and Transcribing, and critical Note Have father'd much on them, which they never wrote. VII. This Place is a Proof, how the Critics made bold To foist their own Sense into Verses of old; For instead of two Greeks here, attending their Master, And footing a Pace neither slower nor faster, They have made in some Places to follow his Track Of their swift-footed Dogs an indefinite Pack; The Son of Ulysses unskilfully forcing To go to a Council, as Men go a-Coursing. VIII. “??? ????, ??? ???,” for Master and Dame, “Not alone,” to interpret by Homer's true Aim: There are Places enow to evince that Attendants Were Men or were Maidens, were Friends or Dependants. Thus Achilles “??? ????,” Omega rehearses, Had two “??????????,” both nam'd in the Verses “Automedon, Alcimus;” whom, it is said, “He valued the most, for Patroclus was dead.” IX. Penelope thus, in First Odyssey Strain, Two “?????????” follow'd,—two Women, 'tis plain,— When the Dame was “??? ???,” and mention'd anon, How they stood to attend her, on either Side one. Had “?????????” signified “Cats” in the Greek, Would not Sense have oblig'd us new Meaning to seek? And two Dogs as unfit as two Cats you will own, To describe Man or Woman “not being alone.” X. To close the plain Reasons that rise in one's Mind, Take an Instance from Virgil of similar Kind: Where in fair Imitation of Homer, no doubt, He describes King Evander to dress and march out; And discern, by the Help of his Mantuan Pen, How “Custodes” and “Canes” were both the same Men, Where “Canes” are “Dogs,” as all Custom opines. See Virgil's eighth Book;—come, I'll copy the Lines: “Nec non et gemini custodes limine ab alto Procedunt, gressumque canes comitantur herilem.” XI. “????? ?????” in Homer were then in his View, When Virgil in Latin thus painted the two, And the “Canes” in him are the very “Custodes,” Most aptly repeated, dignissime Sodes. Did ever Verse yet, or Prose ever, record Any literal Dogs that kept Pace with their Lord? “Proceeding,” “attending”: how plain the Suggestion That “Dogs,” in the Case, are quite out of the Question! XII. And now I appeal to all critical Candour, If Homer's young Hero, or senior Evander, Had Dogs for Companions, to honour their Gressus, As Translators in Verse and in Prose would possess us? The Moderns, I think (tho' a Lover of Metre), Should manage with Judgment a little discreeter, Than to gape and admire what old Poets have sung If it will not make Sense in their own Mother-Tongue! EPISTLE III. I Having shown you the Passage, one cannot avoid An Appendix so proper, kind Visitant Lloyd, To the Mules and the Dogs, which a little while since Were Guards and Piquets, as Verse sought to evince. Whether “?????” attended, two-footed or four, Upon Heroes and Kings, let the Critics explore; But “??????” for “Mules,” in old Homer's Intent, I suspect that his Rhapsodies never once meant. II The Word is twice us'd, in the twenty-third Book, In the Space of five Lines, where I made you to look. I'll refresh your Attention.—Achilles, know then, Had desir'd Agamemnon, the Monarch of Men, To exhort 'em to bring, when the Morning appear'd, And prepare proper Wood, for a Pile to be rear'd For the Purpose of burning, as Custom instill'd, The Remains of Patroclus, whom Hector had kill'd. III When the Morning appear'd with her rosyfied Fingers, Agamemnon obey'd, and exhorted the Bringers, “The Mules and the Men,”—as Translation presents,— Exhorted them all to come out of their Tents. So the “Men” and the “Mules” lay amongst one another, If this be the Case, in some Hammocks or other; And the “Men,” taking with 'em Ropes, Hatchets, and Tools, Were conducted, it seems, to the Wood by the “Mules!” IV For “the Mules went before 'em,” the Latinists say: Which, a Man may presume, was to show 'em the Way; Or, since there was Danger, the Mules going first Might, perhaps, be because the Men none of 'em durst. For they all were to pass, in their present Employ, To the Woods of Mount Ida, belonging to Troy; And if Trojans fell on them, for stealing their Fire, The Men, in the Rear, might the sooner retire. V However, both mulish and well-booted Folks Came safe to the Mountain, and cut down its Oaks, And with more bulky Pieces of Timber cut out They loaded such Mules, as were Mules without doubt. When you found in the Latin so certain a Place, Where the loading Description show'd Mules in the Case, Your Eyes to the left I saw rolling, to seek If the Word for these “Mules” was “??????” in Greek? VI And had they discover'd that really it was, Conjecture had come to more difficult Pass; But since it was not, since “???????” came, What else but the Meaning could vary the Name? Why should Homer, so fond (as you very well noted), Of repeating the Words which his Muse had once quoted, Make so awkward a Change, without any Pretence Of a Reason suggested by Metre or Sense? VII “???????,” “Mules,” tho' a masculine Ender, Is always in Greek of the feminine Gender; But “??????,” you'll find, let it mean what it will, Never is of that Gender, but masculine still. How ridiculous then, that “??????,” the He's, Should become by their Loading “???????,” She's! In a Latin Description would Poetry pass, That should call 'em “Mulós,” and then load 'em “Mulás?” VIII Both the Word and the Sense, which is really the Bard's, Show the Masculine “Mules” to be certainly “Guards.” Any Mules I desire any Critic to name, If Jacks in the Gender, that are not the same. One Place, which I hinted at, over our Tea, May be offer'd, perhaps, as a masculine Plea; But, if Folks were unbiass'd, they quickly would find A Mistake to be there of the very same Kind. IX The Trojans met Priam at one of their Gates, With the Corps of his Hector, Omega relates; Whom they would have lamented there all the Day long, Had not Priam, addressing himself to the Throng, Made a Speech: “Let me pass with the Mules,”—and so on; For Mules drew the Hearse which the Corpse lay upon. Now, the Words that he said at the Entrance of Troy Were: “??????? ????????? ?????? ???.” X Priam said to the People still hurrying down: “Let me pass thro' the Guards,”—to go into the Town. This is much better Sense, by the Leave of the Schools, Than for Priam to say: “Let me pass with the Mules.” For Idæus directed the Mulish Machine, While Horses drew that in which Priam was seen; Who thought of no Mules, but of reaching the Dome, Where they all might lament over Hector at Home. XI The Mules had been nam'd very often before In the very same Book, Times a Dozen or more; And the proper Term for 'em had always occurr'd; It is only this once that we meet with this Word. That it signifies “Guards,” it is granted, sometimes, As I instanc'd, you know, in the Baguley Rhimes; And will Critics suppose that the Poet would make Variation for mere Ambiguity's Sake? XII That Apollo should plague, Agamemnon exhort, These irrational Creatures is stupid, in short; Where no Metamorphosis, Fable, or Fiction, Can defend such Abuse of plain, narrative Diction.— Perchance, as a Doctor, you'll think me unwise, For poring on Homer, with present sore Eyes; But a Glance the most transient may see, in his Plan, That a Mule is a Mule, and a Man is a Man. CRITICAL REMARKS IN ENGLISH AND LATIN UPON SEVERAL PASSAGES IN HORACE. I. AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND, PROPOSING A CORRECTION IN THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE “Si non Acrisium Virginis abditæ Custodem pavidum, Jupiter et Venus Risissent. —Lib. iii., Od. 16, vv. 5–7. If Jupiter and Venus had not laughed at Acrisius, the affrighted keeper of the concealed virgin.” So then, you think Acrisius really sold His Daughter Danae, himself, for Gold; When the whole Story of the Grecian King Makes such a Bargain so absurd a Thing, That neither Poetry nor Sense could make The Poet guilty of the vile Mistake! No, Sir; her Father, here, was rich enough; Satire on him, for selling her, is Stuff. Fear was his Motive to a vast Expense Of Gates and Guards to keep her in a Fence; But some dull Blockhead, happ'ning to transcribe When half asleep, has made Him take the Bribe, Which Jupiter and Venus, as the Bard Had writ, made use of to corrupt the Guard. All the Remarks on Avarice are just, But 'twas the Keeper that betray'd his Trust. Passage from Virgil which you here select us, How Gold is “cogent of mortale pectus,” And from Euripides, that “Gold can ope Gates”—unattempted even by the Pope— Show Money's Force on Subjects that are vicious; But what has this to do with King Acrisius, Who spar'd no Money to secure his Life, Lost, if his Daughter once became a Wife? He shut her up for fear of Death, and then Sold her himself?—All Stuff! I say again. Death was his dread; nor was it in the Pow'r Of Love's Bewitchment, or of Money'd Show'r, Of Venus, Jupiter, or all the Fry Of Homer's Heav'n, to hire the Man to die. Where is his Avarice, of any Kind, Noted in all the Fables that you find, Except in those of your inventing Fashion That make him old, and Avarice his Passion,— To hide the Blunder of Amanuenses, Who, writing Words, full oft unwrit the Senses? Fact that in Horace, in a World of Places, Appears by irrecoverable Traces; On which the Critics raise a learned Dust, And, still adjusting, never can adjust; Having but one of all the Roman Lyrics To feed their Taste for slavish Panegyrics; The more absurd the Manuscriptal Letter, They paint from thence some fancied Beauty better; Hunting for all the Colours, round about, To make the Nonsense beautifully out; Adorning richly, for the Poet's Sake, Some poor hallucinating Scribe's Mistake. Now, I would have a Short-hand Son of mine Be less obsequious to the Classic Line, Than, right or wrong, to yield his Approbation, Because Homeric, or because Horatian; Or not to see, when it is fairly hinted, Either original Defect or printed. Not that it matters Two-pence, in Regard Of either Grecian or of Roman Bard, If Schools were wise enough to introduce Much better Books for Education's Use! But since, by force of Custom or of Lash, The Boys must wade thro' so much Traunt and Trash To gain their Greek and Latin, they should learn True Greek, at least, and Latin to discern; Nor, for the sake of Custom, to admit The Faults of Language, Metre, Sense, or Wit. Because this blind Attachment by Command To what their Masters do not understand, Makes Reading servile, in the younger Flock, Of riming Horace down to prosing Locke; Knowledge is all mechanically known, And no innate Idéas of their own. But, while I'm riming to you what comes next, I shall forget th' Acrisius of the Text. Your Reasons, then, why this “Custodem pavidum” Should not be chang'd to “Custodemque avidum,” Turn upon Avarice. You think the Father, Fond of the Bribe,—I think, the Keeper rather, Who had no Fear from Danaë, the Wife Who could receive the Gold and lose no Life,— Must needs be he; and that, without the Change, The Verse is unpoetically strange. You make Acrisius to have been the Guard, And to be “Pavidus.”—Extremely hard To make out either! For what other Place Shows that the King was Jailer in the Case? And is not “Pavidus” a dictum gratis? Was not his Danaë, “munita satis,” “Safe kept enough?” If “pavidus” come after, The “Dear Joy” Horace must provoke one's Laughter, Plain common Sense suggesting, all the while: “Not Fear, but fancied Safety gave the Smile.” Safe as Acrisius thought himself to be, The “Custos avidus” would take a Fee; A golden shower, they knew, would break his Oath, And Jupiter and Venus laugh'd at both. II. A DIALOGUE. ““Sume Mæcenas Cyathos Amici Sospitis centum. —Lib. iii., Od. 8, vv. 13–14. Take Mæcenas, a hundred cups with thy friend who is now in safety.” I What! must Mæcenas, when he sups With Horace, drink a Hundred Cups? A Hundred Cups Mæcenas drink! Where must he put them all, d'ye think? Pray, have the Critics all so blunder'd, That none of 'em correct this “Hundred?” II “Not that I know has any one “Had any Scruple thereupon; “And for what Reason, pray, should you? “The Reading, to be sure, is true; “‘A hundred Cups:’ that is to say: “‘Mæcenas! come, and drink away!’” III If that was all the Poet meant, It is express'd without the “Cent.” “Sume, Mæcenas, Cyathos” Does it full well without the Dose,— The monst'rous Dose in Cup or Can, That suits with neither Bard nor Man! IV “Nay, why so monst'rous? Is it told “How much the ‘Cyathus’ would hold? “You think perhaps it was a Mug, “As round as any Johnian Jug. “They drank all Night; if small the Glass, “Would ‘Centum’ mount to such a Mass?” V Small as you will, if 'twas a Bumper, “Centum” for One would be a Thumper. Its Bulk Horatian Terms define: “Vates attonitus” with nine; “Gratia” forbidding more than three. They were no Thimbles, you may see. VI “Not in that Ode; in this they might “Intend a more diminish'd Plight; “And, then, Mæcenas and the Bard “That Night, I warrant ye, drank hard; “‘Perfer in Lucem,’ Horace cries; “To what a Pitch might Numbers rise!” VII A desperate long Night, my Friend, Before their hundred Cups could end! Nor does the Verse invite, throughout, Mæcenas to a drunken Bout: “Perfer in Lucem” comes in View With “procul omnis clamor” too. VIII “Was it no Bout, because no Noise “Should interrupt their Midnight Joys? “Horace, you read, with annual Tap, “Notes his escape from dire Mishap: “Must he, and Friends conven'd, be sober, “Because 'twas March, and not October? IX “Sober or drunk” is not the Case, But Word and Meaning to replace, Both here demolish'd. Did they, pray, Do nothing else but drink away? For Friends conven'd had Horace got No Entertainment but to sot? X “Yes, to be sure; he might rehearse “Some new or entertaining Verse; “Might touch the Lyre, invoke the Muse, “Or twenty Things that he might choose. “No doubt but he would mix along “With Cup and Talk the joyous Song.” XI Doubtless, he would; and that's the Word, For which a “Centum” so absurd Has been inserted, by Mistake Of his Transcribers, scarce awake; Which all the Critics when they keep, Are, quoad hoc, quite fast asleep; XII For that's the Word!—“What Word d'ye mean? “For Song does ‘Centum’ intervene? “Song would be—O, I take your Hint: “‘Cantum,’ not ‘Centum,’ you would print, “‘Sospitis Cantum,’—but the Clause “Can have no Sense with such a Pause.” XIII Pause then at “Sospitis,” nor strike The three Cæsuras all alike; One Cup of Helicon but quaff, The Point is plain as a Pikestaff: “The Wine, the Song, the Lustre's Light,”— The Verse, the Pause, the Sense is right. XIV “Stay, let me read the Sapphic out “Both Ways, and then resolve the Doubt: “Sume Mæcenas cyathos Amici Sospitis centum, et vigiles Lucernas Perfer in Lucem; procul omnis esto Clamor et Ira!” “Sume Mæcenas cyathos Amici Sospitis; Cantum, et vigiles Lucernas Perfer in Lucem; procul omnis esto Clamor et Ira!” “Well, I confess, now I have read, “The Thing is right that you have said; “One Vowel rectified, how plain “Does Horace's Intent remain!” III. [Ye Poets, and Critics, and Men of the Schools] “Nonumque prematur in Annum. —De Art. Poët. v. 388. And let it be suppressed till the ninth year.” I Ye Poets, and Critics, and Men of the Schools, Who talk about Horace and Horace's Rules, Ye learned Admirers, how comes it, I wonder, That none of you touch a most tangible Blunder? I speak not to servile and sturdy Logicians, Who will, right or wrong, follow printed Editions; But you that are Judges, come, rub up your Eyes, And unshackle your Wits,—and I'll show where it lies! II Amongst other Rules which your Horace has writ To make his young Piso for Poetry fit, He tells him, that Verses should not be pursued When the Muse (or Minerva) was not in the Mood; That, whate'er he should wish, “he should let it descend To the Ears of his Father, his Master, his Friend, And let it lie by him,”—now prick up your Ears!— “Nonumque prematur in Annum,”—“nine years.” III “Nine Years,” I repeat; for the Sound is enough, With the Help of plain Sense, to discover the Stuff. If the Rule had been new, what a Figure would “nine” Have made with your Piso's, ye Masters of mine? Must a Youth of quick Parts, for his Verse's Perfection, Let it lie for “nine Years” in the House of Correction? Nine Years if his Verses must lie in the Leaven, Take the young Rogue himself, and transport him for seven! IV To make this a Maxim that Horace infuses, Must provoke all the Laughter of all the nine Muses. How the Wits of old Rome, in a Case so facetious, Would have jok'd upon Horace, and Piso, and Metius, If they all could not make a poetical Line Ripe enough to be read, till the Year had struck nine! Had the Boy been possest of nine Lives, like a Cat, Yet surely he'd ne'er have submitted to that! V “Vah!” says an old Critic, “Indefinite Number To denote many Years”—(which is just the same Lumber); Quotes a Length of Quintilian for Time to retouch; But wisely stops short at his blaming too much. “Some took many Years”; he can instance, in fine, “Isocrates ten, Poet Cinna just nine;”— Rare Instance of taking, which, had he been cool, Th' old Critic had seen, never could be a Rule. VI “Indeed,” says a young one, “nine Years, I confess, Is a desperate While for a Youth to suppress. I can hardly think Horace would make it a Point; The Word, to be sure, must be out of its Joint; Lie by with a ‘Nonum’!—Had I been his Piso, I'd have told little Fatty, mine never should lie so. Had he said for nine Months, I should think them enow. This Reading is false, Sir; pray, tell us the True!” VII Why, you are not far off it, if present Conjecture May furnish the Place with a probable Lecture; For by Copies, I doubt, either printed or written, The Hundreds of Editors all have been bitten. Nine Months you allow?—“Yes.”—Well, let us, for fear Of affronting Quintilian, e'en make it a Year: Give the Critics their “numque,” but as to their “no”— You have one in plain English more fit to bestow. VIII I take the Correction: “unumque prematur” “Let it lie for one Twelvemonth.”—“Ay, that may hold Water; And Time enough too for consulting about Master Piso's Performance, before it came out! What! Would Horace insist, that a Sketch of a Boy Should take as much Time, as the taking of Troy? They that bind out the young one, say, when the old Fellow Took any Time like it, to make a Thing mellow. IX Tho' correct in his Trifles”!—Young Man, you say right, And to them that will see, it is plain at first Sight; But Critics that will not, they hunt all around For something of sameness, in Sense or in Sound; It is all one to them so attach'd to the Letter, That to make better Sense makes it never the better. Nay, the more Sense in Readings, the less they will own 'em; You must leave to these Sages their mumpsimus “Nonum.” X “Do you think,” they cry out, “that with so little Wit Such a World of great Critics on Horace have writ? That the Poets themselves, were the Blunder so plain, In a Point of their Art too, would let it remain?” For you are to consider, these critical Chaps Do not like to be snubb'd; you may venture, perhaps, An Amendment, where they can see somewhat amiss; But may raise their ill Blood, if you circulate this. XI “It will circulate, this, Sir, as sure as their Blood, Or, if not, it will stand, as in Horace it stood. They may wrangle and jangle, unwilling to see; But the Thing is as clear as a Whistle to me. This “Nonum” of theirs no Defence will admit, Except that a Blot is no Blot, till it's hit; And now you have hit it, if “Nonum” content 'em, So would, if the Verse had so had it, “Nongentum.” XII You'll say, “this is painting of Characters”;—true; But really, good Sirs, I have met with these two:— The first, in all Comments quite down to the Delphin, A Man, if he likes it, may look at himself in; The last, if you like, and, along with the Youth, Prefer to “Nonumque” poetical Truth, Then blot out the Blunder, now here it is hinted, And by all future Printers “Unumque” be printed! IV. [By “Campus,” and by “Areæ,” my Friends] “Nunc et Campus et Areæ, Lenesque sub noctem susurri Compositâ repetantur horâ. —Lib. i. Od. 9, vv. 18–20. Now let both the Campus Martius, and the open squares, and soft whispers be resorted to again, at the hour of assignation.” I By “Campus,” and by “Areæ,” my Friends, The Question is, what Horace here intends? For such Expression with the current Style Of this whole Ode is hard to reconcile; Nay, notwithstanding critical Pretence, Or I mistake, or it can have no Sense. II The Ode, you find, proceeding to relate A Winter's Frost in its severest State, Calls out for Fire, and Wine, and Loves, and Dance, And all that Horace rambles to enhance; But how can this fair-Weather Phrase belong To such a wintry, saturnalian Song? III A learned Frenchman quotes these very Lines As really difficult; and thus refines: “We use these Words,” says Monsieur Sanadon, “For nightly Meetings, hors de la Maison; “But 'tis ridiculous, in Frost and Snow “Of keenest Kind, that Horace should do so.” IV Right, Monsieur, right; such incoherent Stuff Is here, no Doubt, ridiculous enough. The Campus Martius, and its active Scenes, Which Commentators say th' Expression means, Have here no Place; nor can they be akin To Scenes not laid without Doors, but within. V “‘Nunc’ must refer,” proceeds the French Remark, “To ‘Donec—Puer,’ Age of Taliarque; “Not to the Frost, for which the Bard, before, “Design'd the two first Strophes, and no more; “As Commentators rightly should have taught, “Or inattentive Readers else are caught.” VI Now “inattentive” Critics too, I say, Are caught, sometimes, in their dogmatic Way. United here, we must divide, forsooth, The Time of Winter from the Time of Youth, When all Expressions of Horatian Growth Do, in this Ode, 'tis plain, refer to both! VII Youthful th' Amusements, and for frosty Week; From drinking, dancing, down to hide and seek; But “Campus” comes, and “Areæ,” between, By a Mistake too big for any Screen; And how nonsensically join'd with Lispers, “By Assignation met,” of “nightly Whispers”! VIII Strange, how Interpreters retail the Farce, That “Campus” here should mean “the Field of Mars”! When in their Task they must have just read o'er Contrast to this, the very Ode before; Where ev'ry manly Exercise disclos'd To Love's Effeminacy stands oppos'd. IX In this, no thought of any Field on Earth, But warm Fire-side and Roman Winter's Mirth; No thought of any but domestic “Ring,” Where all Decembrian Customs took their Swing, And where—but come, that Matter we'll suppress; There should be something for Cantábs to guess! X I'll ask anon, from what has now been said, If Emendation pops into your Head; Or if you'll teach me how to comprehend That all is right, and Nothing here to mend.— Come, sharpen up your Latin Wits a bit; What are they good for else, these Odes that Horace writ? V. [This Phrase of “Riches built on high”] “Cedes coëmptis saltibus, et domo; Villâque, flavus quam Tiberis lavit, Cedes; et exstructis in altum Divitiis potietur heres. —Lib. ii. Od. 3, vv. 17–20. You shall leave your purchased lawns, and your house; you shall retire from the villa, which is washed by the yellow Tiber; and an heir shall enjoy your riches high piled up.” I This Phrase of “Riches built on high” Has something in it, at first Sight, Which, if the Latin Language try, Must needs appear not to be right. Produce an Instance, where before 'Twas ever us'd,—I'll say no more! II Talk not of “Riches pil'd on Heaps,” To justify the Latin Phrase; For if you take such critic Leaps, You jump into Dog-Latin Days; And I shall answer to that Trick: “In meâ mente non est sic.” III That “Lands” were here the Poet's Thought, And “House along the River's Side,” And “lofty Villa,” built or bought, Is much too plain to be denied. These “high-extructed Spires” he writ That mortal Dellius must quit. IV “Well, Sir, supposing this the Case, “And ‘Structures’ what the Poet meant: “How will you fill the faulty Place “With Phrase that suited his Intent; “Meaning and Metre both arrange, “And small, if possible, the Change?” V Smaller and better, to be sure, Into their Place Amendments fall; What first occurs will here secure Meaning and Meter, Change and all. May it not be that for “Divitiis” Th' Original had “Æ-dificiis?” VI If you object that sep'rate “Æ” Makes in one Word an odd Division, Horace, I answer to that Plea, Has more than once the like Elision. In short, upon Correction's Plan, Give us a better, if you can. VI. [This Passage, Sirs, may put ye, one would think] “Non est meum, si mugiat Africis Malus procellis, ad miseras preces Decurrere, et votis pacisci, Ne Cypriæ Tyriæque merces Addant avaro divitias mari. Tum me biremis præsidio scaphæ Tutum per Ægæos tumultus Aura feret geminusque Pollux. —Lib. iii. Od. 29, vv. 57–64. It is no part of my concern, if the mast be cracked by African storms, to descend to piteous entreaties, and by my vows to make an agreement that my Cyprian and Tyrian wares shall not augment the treasures of the greedy ocean. Then, under the safe-guard of a two-oared skiff, the breeze and the twin-brother Pollux will waft me safely through the Ægean tempests.” I This Passage, Sirs, may put ye, one would think, In mind of him, who, in a furious Storm Told that the Vessel certainly would sink, Made a Reply in the Horatian Form: “Why, let it sink then, if it will!” quoth he; “I'm but a Passenger,—what is't to me?” II So, “non est meum,” Horace here cries out, To purchase Calm with wretched Vows and Pray'rs; “Let them who freight the Ship be thus devout,— I'm not concern'd in any of its Wares!” May not one ask, if common-Sense will read, Was ever Jest and Earnest more agreed? III Nay but you see the Reason, 'tis replied, Why he rejects the Bargaining of Pray'r: His little Skiff will stem the raging Tide With double Pollux, and with gentler Air. “This is his Moral,” say his Under-pullers: “The Poor and Innocent are safe in Scullers.” IV Why, so they may be, if they coast along, And shun the Winds that make “a Mast to moan!” But here, according to the critic Throng, Horace was in the Ship, tho' not his own. Suppose a Sculler just contriv'd for him, When the Ship sunk, would his “Biremis” swim? V Can you by any construing Pretence,— If you suppose, as Commentators do, Him in the Ship,—make tolerable Sense Of his surviving all the sinking Crew? With Winds so boist'rous, by what cunning Twist Can his clear Stars and gentle Air resist? VI “The Gifts of Fortune Horace had resign'd, “And poor and honest his just fancied Case: “Nothing to do had he with ‘stormy Wind,’ “Nor in ‘Ægæan Seas’ to seek a Place. “How is it likely then, that he should mean “To paint himself in such an awkward Scene?” VII Why, but “Tum me biremis” must suppose, By “then” escaping, that he sure was in't; And “feret,” too, that comes into the close In all the Books that we have here in Print.— Both Words are wrong, tho', notwithstanding that; “Tum” should be “Cum,” and “feret” be “ferat.” VIII The Sense, or Moral, if you please, is this: “Henceforth be Probity, tho' poor, my Lot! “The Love of Riches is but an Abyss “Of dangerous Cares, that now concern me not. “Caught in its Storms, let Avarice implore; “I thank my Stars, I'm rowing safe to Shore.” VII. [Whene'er this Horace comes into one's Hand] “Ludit herboso pecus omne campo Cum tibi Nonæ redeunt Decembres; Festus in pratis vacat otioso Cum bove pagus; Inter audaces lupus errat agnos; Spargit agrestes tibi silva frondes; Gaudet invisam pepulisse fossor Ter pede terram. —Lib. iii. Od. 18, vv. 9–16. All the cattle play upon the grassy plain, when the Nones of December to thee return; the festive village is at leisure in the meadows with the idle ox; the wolf wanders among the dauntless lambs; for thee the wood scatters small leaves; the digger rejoices to have beaten the hated ground in a triple dance.” I Whene'er this Horace comes into one's Hand, One meets with Words full hard to understand. If one consult the Critics thereupon, Some Places have a Note, some others none; And, when they take interpretating Pains, Sometimes the Difficulty still remains. II To you that see, good Friends, where I am blind, Let me propose a Case of either Kind: Premising first,—for both relate to Weather,— That Winter and December come together; The Romans, too, as far as I remember, Have join'd together Winter and December. III In Book the Third of Horace, Ode Eighteen, “Ad Faunum,” these two Sapphics here are seen: “Ludit HERBOSO pecus omne campo, Cum tibi Nonæ redeunt Decembres; Festus in Pratis vacat otioso Cum bove Pagus. Inter audaces lupus errat Agnos; Spargit agrestes tibi Silva Frondes; Gaudet invisam pepulisse fossor Ter pede terram.” Now, in December, if we reason close, Are Fields poetically call'd “herbose?” Is that the Month, tho' Faunus kept the Fold, For “daring Lambs” to frisk about so bold? IV “Leaves,” I would add too; but the learn'd Dacier Has made this Point elaborately clear, As one that artful Horace interweaves: “The Trees in Italy then shed their Leaves; “And this the Poet's Artifice profound: “The Trees themselves for Faunus strew'd the Ground.” V It is, we'll say, a fine Horatian Flight; But is the Herbage,—are the Lambs, so right? Is there in all the Ode a single Thing That makes the Winter differ from the Spring? Nones of December are indeed hibernal, But all the rest is absolutely vernal. VI “Lenis incedis per APRICA rura”— Does this begin like Winter?—But quid plura? Read how it all begins, goes on, or ends: Nothing but “Nones” is winterly, my Friends; Neither in human nor in brutal Creatures One Trace observ'd of Winter's stormy Features. VII May not there be, then, tho' the Critic make No Hesitation at it, a Mistake? The Digger's Dancing, too, has somewhat spissy: “Gaudet INVISAM terram pepulisse.” “He in Revenge” (say Comments) “beats the Soil, Hated,” because it gave him so much Toil. VIII As oft the Diggers, whom we chance to meet, Turn up the Ground, and press it with their Feet, Horace himself, perhaps we may admit, “Inversam terram,” not “INVISAM” writ. But this at Present our Demand postpones:— Pray, solve the Doubt on these “Decembrian Nones”! VIII. [Horace, “an Infant” (here he interweaves] “Ut tuto ab atris corpore viperis Dormirem et Ursis. —Lib. iii. Od. 4, vv. 17–18. How I could sleep with my body secured from black vipers and bears.” I Horace, “an Infant” (here he interweaves In rambling Ode, where no Design coheres), “By fabled Stock-Doves cover'd up with Leaves, “Kept safe from black skinn'd Vipers, and from Bears;”— But, passing by the incoherent Ode, I ask the Critics where the “Bears” abode? II The Leaves indeed, that Stock-Doves could convey, Would be but poor Defence against the Snakes, And sleeping Boy be still an easy Prey To black Pervaders of the thorny Brakes; The Bears, I doubt too, would have smelt him out, If there had been such Creatures thereabout! III The Snakes were black; the Bears, I guess, were white, (Or what the Vulgar commonly call Bulls) Bears had there been; another Word is right That has escap'd the criticising Skulls, Who suffer Bears as quietly to pass, As if the Bard had been of Lapland Class. IV A Word, where Sense and Sound do so agree, That I shall spare to speak in its Defence, And leave Absurdity, so plain to see, With due Correction, to your own good Sense. 'Tis this in short in these Horatian Verses: For “Bears” read “Goats”: pro “Ursis,” lege “Hyrcis!” IX. [This is one Ode, and much the best of two] “Romæ, principis urbium, Dignatur soboles inter amabiles Vates ponere me choros. —Lib. iv. Od. 3, vv. 13–15 The children (inhabitants) of Rome, the queen of cities, deign to place me among the amiable band of poets.” I This is one Ode, and much the best of two, Fam'd above all for Scaliger's Ado. “I rather would have writ so good a Thing “Than reign,” quoth he, “an Aragonian King.” Had he been King, and Master of the Vote, I doubt, the Monarch would have chang'd his Note, And, loading Verses with an huge Renown, Would still have kept his Aragonian Crown. II This Ode, howe'er, tho' short of such a Rout, He show'd some Judgment when he singled out. Compar'd with others, one is at a Stand To think how those should come from the same Hand. For, if they did, 'tis marvellous enough, That such a Muse with such a Breath should puff,— That such a delicate harmonious Muse Should catch the Clouds, or sink into the Stews. III But Fame has sold them to us in a Lot, And all is Horace, whether his, or not. For his, or whose you will, then, let them pass; What signifies it who the Author was? “Dunghill of Ennius,” as we are told By ancient Proverb, “might afford some Gold;” And that's the Case of what this Horace sung: Some Grains of Gold with Tinsel mix'd, and Dung. IV We'll say this Ode, allowing for the Age That Horace writ in, was a golden Page,— The Words well chosen, easy, free, and pat, The Lyric Claim so manag'd,—and all that;— What I would note is, that no Critic yet, Of them, I mean, whose Notes my Eyes have met, Has seen a Blemish in this finish'd Piece, Outdone, they say, by neither Rome nor Greece. V Yet there is one, which it is somewhat strange, That none of 'em should see a Cause to change, But let a great Indelicacy stand, As if it came from Horace's own Hand: To “vatum choros” join'd “Amabiles,” When, what he meant was “lovely soboles.” Meo periculo, Sirs, alter this: If Taste be in you, read “amabilis.” VI If ye refuse, I have no more to say; Keep to flat Print, and read it your own Way; Let Fear to change a Vowel's Rote dispense With jingling sound, and unpoliter Sense! I don't expect that Critics, with their Skill, Will take the Hint,—but all true Poets will. Be it a Test, at Present, who has got The nicer Taste of liquid Verse, who not! Latin verse has been omitted. XIII. [The whole Design of this Horatian Strain] “?Thure placaris et hornâ Fruge Lares avidâque porcâ. —Lib. iii. Od. 23, vv. 3–4. And thou shalt have appeased the household Gods, by an offering of frankincense, and fruits of this year's growth, and a greedy swine.” THE FOREGOING CRITICISM, IN ENGLISH VERSE. Latin verse has been omitted. I The whole Design of this Horatian Strain Is so exceeding obvious and plain, That one would wonder how correcting Eyes Could overlook a Blot of such a Size As “avidâque Porcâ,” when the Line, So read, quite ruins Horace's Design. II He, as the Verse begins, and as it ends, This Point to rustic Phydile commends: That Innocence to Gifts the Gods prefer, And frugal Off'rings would suffice from her; That want of Victims was in her no Fault; She might present Fruit, Incense, Cake, and Salt. III With what Connexion could he add to these A “greedy Swine” in order to appease Those very Deities, whom Ode is meant To paint with cheap and bloodless Gifts content, From pious Hands receiv'd, tho' e'er so small? But “avidâque Porcâ” spoils it all. IV What Moral meant, if they requir'd, in fine, From rustic Phidyle, a great fat Swine? Why little Gods and little Matters nam'd, If such a Sacrifice as this was claim'd? “Porcâ” is wrong, Sirs, whether we regard The Gods, the Countrywoman, or the Bard. V What must be done in such a Case as this? One must amend, tho' one should do't amiss. I'll tell you the Correction, frank and free, That upon reading first occurr'd to me, And seem'd to suit the Bard's Intention better, With small Mutation of the printed Letter. VI Tho' “avidâque Porcâ” runs along With Verb, and Case, and Measure of the Song, Yet, if the Poet is to be renown'd For something more than mere Italian Sound,— For Life and Sense, as well as Shell and Carcass, Read: “Fruge Lares, avidasque Parcas.” XIV. [Have ye no Scruple, Sirs, when ye rehearse] “Vile potabis modicis Sabinum Cantharis. —Lib. i. Od. 20, vv. 1–2. Thou shalt drink weak Sabine wine in little cups.” I Have ye no Scruple, Sirs, when ye rehearse This hissing Kind of an Horatian Verse? To me, I own, at Sight of triple “is,” Suspicion said that something was amiss; And, when one reads the triple Sapphic thro', 'Tis plain that what Suspicion said was true. II Critics, as Custom goes, if one shall bring The plainest Reason for the plainest Thing, Will stick to Horace, as he sticks to Print, And say, sometimes, that there is Nothing in't.— Or, here, Mistake perhaps, may be my Lot; Now, tell me, Neighbours, if 'tis so or not? III This Ode, or (since apparently Mishap Has lost the true Beginning of it) Scrap, Informs Mæcenas that poor Sabine Wine Shall be his Drink, in Horace's Design,— Wine which the Poet had incask'd, the Day That People shouted for the Knight away. IV This is the first Thing that it says. The next, Without one Word of intervening Text, Says, he shall drink (and in poetic Shape Wine is describ'd) the very richest Grape: “My Cups Falernian Vintage, Formian Hill,” (Is all that follows after) “never fill.” V These, and these only, in the printed Code, Are the two Periods of this pygmy Ode; And how they stand in Contradiction flat, Whoe'er can construe Latin must see that! The Critics saw it, but forsook their Sight, And set their Wits at work, to make it right. VI How they have done it, such as have a Mind To know their Fetches, if they look, may find, And smile thereat. One Ounce, that but coheres, Of Mother Wit, is worth a Pound of theirs; Who having, by their Dint of Learning, seen That Moon is Cheese, soon prove it to be green. VII 'Twill be enough to give ye just a Taste, From Delphin here, of criticising Haste: “Mæcenas, setting on some Journey out, “Sent Horace word, before he took his Rout,— “As Cruquius, Lubin, Codex too pretend,— “That he would sup with his assured Friend. VIII “Horace writes back—and this, it seems, the Ode:— “‘'Tis mighty kind to take me in your Road; “But you must be content with slender Fare, “Such as my poor Tenuity can spare: “Vile potabis,—Sabine wine the best— “As learnedly Theod. Marcil. has guess'd.’” IX So far, so good.—But why should Horace, slap, Say: “You shall drink the Wines of richest Tap?” “That is,” quoth Margin of the Delphin Tome, “‘Domi potabis’—‘you shall drink at Home;’ ‘Hæc vina quidem bibes apud te,’ Says Note; ‘non ita vero apud me.’” X “Certè,” it adds, “as Pliny understood, “The Knight's own Wine was exquisitely good;”— Good, to be sure, tho' Pliny had been dumb; But how does all that has been said o'ercome The Contradiction?—Why, with this Assistance: 'Tis plain they supp'd together—at a Distance! XI One easy Hint, without such awkward Stirs, Dissolves at once the Difficulty, Sirs: Let Horace drink himself of his own Vinum: “Vile POTABO modicis Sabinum “Cantharis, and Mæcenas do so too;— “Tu bibes Cæcubum;” and all is true. XII No verbal Hissing spoils poetic Grace, Nor Contradiction stares ye in the Face; But Verse-Intention, without further Tours: “I'll drink my Wine, Mæcenas, and you yours.” Should not all Judges of Horatian Letter Or take this Reading, or propose a better? LINES ON A CONTESTED ELECTION TO A FELLOWSHIP OF THE MANCHESTER COLLEGIATE CHURCH. I Sirs, I've no Taste for a contesting Pother The Church on one Side, and the Town o' th' other. If any Meeting on one Side could bring Both to agree, it were another Thing; But I'm afraid that Zeal, in a One-sider, Will only tend to make the Diff'rence wider. II You would have Clayton carry this Election. So would I too, if there be no Objection,— None strong enough, in Justice, to cashier A Chaplain serving in his eighteenth year, Who should succeed, if “cæteris” be “paribus” By all the Laws of “Propria quæ maribus.” III If any Doubts arise about the Matter Apply Solution, but without a Clatter! Urge all the Reasons that you have, but still With proper Temper and down-right Good-will! For Pow'r to think, as far as I can see, Belongs to all, as well as you and me. IV “They don't think right, if they reject his Claim.”— That may be true; but Choice is still the same, When once 'tis past,—the same to all Intent, Tho' they themselves should happen to repent. Since what is vacant is a Fellow's Stall, The Fellows must supply it, after all. V As to their Taste,—if one may here disclose The Secrets, Sirs, which ev'ry Body knows: Put Ashton heartily desirous down To serve the Church, and to oblige the Town; And hope that him two Fellows, whom he chose, Will not be fond of Reasons to oppose. VI Moss is for Parker, as you all agree; I tell you this, because you told it me. But, whether Youth, with an ingenuous Fame, Will change for Heats of a contested Claim An Independence likely to do well,— That I don't know; because you did not tell. VII Foxley is disengag'd, entirely free But to the right, that right appears to be. Your Jealousy supposes that the Two Have laid their Scheme;—perhaps, it is not true. Do not proceed, as if the Town or Church Were really hurt by an imagin'd Lurch! VIII Perhaps both Foxley, in this Case, and Moss Really and honestly are at a Loss; Have certain Matters fairly to discuss Not quite so proper to be told to us. “Why can't they tell 'em?”—Why, perhaps they may; But 'tis their Time that you and I must stay. IX Your End, methinks, is sooner brought about By friendly Force, by Reason, than by Rout, On such an offer'd Season to begin And bring the ancient, constant Custom in; For, till of Late, the Chaplains (as they tell us) From the Foundation have been chosen Fellows. X If they regard experienc'd Ashton's Voice, As Griffith was their own applauded Choice, Good-natur'd Warden, Fellows all agreed, Chaplains that do their Duty to succeed, The People to be pleas'd, and Peace ensue.— This I conceive to be the Point in View. EPITAPH ON WILLIAM OF WYKEHAM. Here William lies, of Wykeham by Surname, This Church's Bishop, who repair'd its Frame. How great in Bounty, rich and poor depose; How wise in Council, all the Kingdom knows; By founded Colleges his pious Breast Oxford and Winchester will both attest. Pray for such Worth, ye who behold his Tomb, And wish Eternal Life to be its Doom! PLURAL AND SINGULAR. “We are the Men,” is the contentious Cry. Now, give the Quakers and each Sect the Lie: With any Person of a plural Clan Prefer your Singular: “I am the Man.” AN ANSWER TO THE FOLLOWING LETTER, . Requesting the Author's Solution of a Rebus, commonly ascribed to Lord Chesterfield Letter and Chesterfield's “Rebus” have been omitted. I Paucis, Friend Aphanus, abhinc Diebus, With no small Pleasure, I receiv'd a Rebus. Not that the Rebus gave it, understand, But old Acquaintance Benjamin's own Hand! For all the Blessings due to mortal Men, Rebus in omnibus, I wish to Ben. II At his Request I sought for ancient City, That lay conceal'd in cabalistic Ditty. So did we all,—for, when his Letter came, Some Friends were chair'd around the focal Flame,— But Rebus out not one of all could make; Diaphanus himself was quite opaque. III Tho' pleas'd with pleasing, when he can do so, His Ingenuity he loves to show; If such a Thing falls out to be his Lot, He is as free to own when it does not. Here he had none, nor any Succedaneum, That could discover this same Herculaneum. IV Altho' it seem'd to ask, when it appear'd, No great Herculean Labour to be clear'd; So many different Wits at work, no doubt, The City's Name would quickly be found out. But, notwithstanding variorum Lecture, The Name lay snug without the least Detecture. V You stand entitl'd, hereupon, to laugh At hapless Genius in your Friend Diaph. But in excuse for what he must confess, Nor Men, nor even Ladies here could guess; To Variorum seen, or Variarum, No more of ancient City than old Sarum. VI One Thing, however, rose from this Occasion: It put an End to Fears of French Invasion; And Wits, quite frighten'd out of Dames, and Men, When Rebus came, came into 'em again. Tho' little skill'd to judge of either Matter, Yet the more pleasing Puzzle was the latter. VII You'll think, I'm thinking, upon second Thought, That, tho' we miss'd of City that was sought, We might have told you somewhat of the Guesses Of luckless Neighbours, and of Neighbouresses. So, let us try to give you just an Item; For it would take a Volume to recite 'em. VIII “I can't divine,” said Chloe, “for my Part, What the Man means by ‘noblest Work of Art:’ From Clock to Temple, Pyramid, and Ship, And twenty diff'rent Handiworks you skip. Now, I dare say, when all your Votes are past, City, or Work,—'tis Dresden at the last.” IX “Nor I,” said Phillis, “what the Man can mean By his next Hint of ‘Nature's brightest Scene.’ Amongst so many of her Scenes so bright Who can devise which of 'em is the right? To name a Word where brightest Scene must lie, And speak my own Opinion, Sirs,—'tis Eye.” X “Peace,” said a Third, of I forget what Sex, “Has ‘well known Signal’ that may well perplex. It should be Olive-Branch, to be well known, But Rebus, unconfin'd to that alone, May mean Abundance, Plenty, Riches, Trade;— Who knows the Signal that is here display'd?” XI Thus they went on; but, tho' I stir its Embers, It is not much that Memory remembers. Two Ladies had a long disputing Match, Whether “Charm-adding Spot” was Mole or Patch; While none would venture to decide the Vole:— One had a Patch and t'other had a Mole. XII So, “Wife's Ambition” made a parted School; Some said “to please her Husband;” some, “to rule.” On this moot point, too, Rebus would create, As you may guess, a pretty smart Debate; Till one propos'd to end it thus with Ease: “The only way to rule him—is to please.” XIII Hold! I forgot:—One said, “a Parson's Dues” Was the same Thing with riming “Badge of Jews,”— And “Tithe” was it,—but “Corn,” or “Pig,” or “Goose,” What Earth, or Animals of Earth produce, From Calf and Lamb to Turnip and Potatoe, Might be the Word;—which he had nought to say to. XIV Made for Excuse, you see, upon the whole, The too great Number of the Words, that poll For Correspondency to ev'ry Line, And make the meant one tedious to divine! But we suspect that other Points ambiguous, And eke unfair, contribute to fatigue us. XV For, first, with due Submission to our Betters, What ancient City could have eighteen Letters? Or more,—for, in the latter Lines, the Clue May have one correspondent Word, or two? Clue should have said, if only one occurr'd, Not “correspondent Words” to each, but “Word.” XVI From some Suspicions of a Bite, we guess The Number of the Letters to be less; And, from Expression of a certain Cast, Some Joke, unequal to the Pains at last. Could you have said that all was right and clever, We should have tried more fortunate Endeavour. XVII “It should contain, should this same Jeu de Mots, Clean-pointed Turn, short, fair, and à Propos,— Wit without Straining, Neatness without Starch, Hinted tho' hid, and decent tho' 'tis arch; No vile Idea should disgrace a Rebus.” Sic dicunt Musæ, sic edicit Phœbus. XVIII This, Aphanus, tho' short of Satisfaction, Is what Account occurs of the Transaction,— Impertinent enough; but you'll excuse What your own Postcript half enjoin'd the Muse. She, when she took the sudden Task upon her, Believe me, did it to “oblige” your Honour. TIME PAST, FUTURE, AND PRESENT. Time that is past thou never can'st recall; Of time to come thou art not sure at all; Time present only is within thy Pow'r: Now, now, improve, then, whilst thou can'st, the Hour! LOOK AT HOME! Set not the Faults of other Folks in View; But rather mind what thou thyself should'st do; For twenty Errors of thy Neighbour known Will tend but little to reform thy own! DISARMING AN ENEMY. Safer to reconcile a Foe, than make A Conquest of him for the Conquest's Sake; This tames his Pow'r of doing present Ill, But That disarms him of the very Will. ANGRY REPROOF. To give Reproof in Anger, to be sure, Whate'er the Fault, is not the Way to cure. Would a wise Doctor offer, dost thou think, The Sick his Potion scalding-hot to drink? THE EFFECTS OF MANNER. A Graceful Manner and a friendly Ease Will give a “No,” and not at all displease; And an ill-natur'd or ungraceful “Yes,” When it is giv'n, is taken much amiss. THE WICKEDNESS OF REVENGE. But small the Diff'rence, if Tertullian's right, To do an Injury, or to requite: “He is,” said he, “who does it to the other, But somewhat sooner wicked than his Brother.” THE SELF-SUBORDINATION OF REASON. My Reason is I, and your Reason is You, And, if we shall differ, both cannot be true; If Reason must judge, and we two must agree, Another, third Reason must give the Decree, Superior to ours, and to which it is fit That both, being weaker, should freely submit. Now, in Reason submitting is plainly implied That it does not pretend, of itself, to decide. THE QUID AND THE QUIS. In Truths that Nobody can miss, It is the Quid that makes the Quis; In such as lie more deeply hid, It is the Quis that makes the Quid. A QUERY. Should a good Angel and a bad between Th' Infirmary and Theatre be seen,— One going to be present at the Play, The other where the sick and wounded lay: Quære, were your Conjecture to be had, Which would the good one go to, which the bad? VERSES DESIGNED FOR A WATCH-CASE. Could but our Tempers move like this Machine, Not urg'd by Passion, nor delay'd by Spleen, But, true to Nature's regulating Pow'r, By virtuous Acts distinguish ev'ry Hour: Then Health and Joy would follow, as they ought, The Laws of Motion and the Laws of Thought,— Sweet Health, to pass the present Moments o'er, And everlasting Joy, when Time shall be no more. AN ADMONITION AGAINST SWEARING. Addressed to an Officer in the Army. Oh! That the Muse might call, without offence, The gallant Soldier back to his good Sense,— His temp'ral Field so cautious not to lose, So careless quite of his eternal Foes! Soldier, so tender of thy Prince's Fame, Why so profuse of a Superior Name? For the King's Sake, the Brunt of Battles bear, But, for the King of Kings' Sake, do not Swear! TO THE SAME, EXTEMPORE. Intended to allay the Violence of Party-Spirit. God bless the King,—I mean the Faith's Defender; God bless—no Harm in blessing—the Pretender! But who Pretender is, or who is King— God bless us all! that's quite another Thing. ON PRIOR'S SOLOMON. An Epigram. Wise Solomon, with all his rambling Doubts, Might talk two Hours, I guess, or thereabouts; “And yet,” quoth he, “my Elders, to their Shame, Kept Silence all, nor Answer did they frame.”— Dear me! what else but Silence should they keep? He, to be sure, had talk'd them all asleep. AN ANECDOTE. The French Ambassador had been to wait On James the First, in Equipage of State. Bacon was by; to whom the King began: “Well now, my Lord, what think you of the Man?” “He's a tall, proper Person, Sir,” said he. “Aye,” said the King; “that anyone may see. But what d'ye think of Head-piece in the Case? Is he a ‘proper Person’ for his Place?” My Lord, who thought he was not, I suppose, Gave him this Answer, as the Story goes: “Tall Men are oft like Houses that are tall: The upper Rooms are furnish'd worst of all.” END OF VOL.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II.—SACRED POEMS. PART I. A DIVINE PASTORAL. I The Lord is my Shepherd, my Guardian, my Guide; Whatsoever I want He will kindly provide; Ever since I was born, it is He that hath crown'd The Life that He gave me with Blessings all round. While yet on the Breast a poor Infant I hung, Ere Time had unloosen'd the Strings of my Tongue, He gave me the Help which I could not then ask; Now therefore to thank Him shall be my Tongue's Task! II Thro' my tenderest Years with as tender a Care My Soul like a Lamb in His Bosom He bare; To the Brook He would lead me, whene'er I had need, And point out the Pasture where best I might feed. No Harm could approach me; for He was my Shield From the Fowls of the Air and the Beasts of the Field; The Wolf, to devour me, would oftentimes prowl; But the Lord was my Shepherd, and guarded my Soul. III How oft in my Youth have I wander'd astray, And still He hath brought me back to the right Way! When, lost in dark Error, no Path I could meet, His Word like a Lantern hath guided my Feet. What wond'rous Escapes to His Kindness I owe, When, rash and unthinking, I sought my own Woe! My Soul had long since been gone down to the Deep, If the Lord had not watchèd, when I was asleep. IV Whensoe'er, at a Distance, He sees me afraid, He skips o'er the Mountain, and comes to my Aid; Then leads me back gently, and bids me abide In the midst of His Flock, and feed close by His Side. How safe in His keeping, how happy and free, Could I always remain where He bids me to be! Yea, blest are the People, and happy thrice-told, That obey the Lord's Voice, and abide in His Fold! V The Fold it is full, and the Pasture is green; All is Friendship and Love, and no Enemy seen. There the Lord dwells amongst us upon His own Hill, With the Flocks all around Him awaiting His Will; Himself in the Midst with a provident Eye Regarding our Wants, and procuring Supply; An Abundance springs up of each nourishing Bud, And we gather His Gifts, and are fillèd with Good. VI At His Voice or Example we move or we stay; For the Lord is Himself both our Leader and Way. The Hills smoke with Incense where'er He hath trod, And a sacred Perfúme shows the Footsteps of God. While blest with His Presence, the Valleys beneath A sweet smelling Savour incessantly breathe; The Delight is renew'd of each sensible Thing, And beheld in their Bloom all the Beauties of Spring. VII Or, if a quite different Scene He prepare, And we march thro' the Wilderness, barren and bare, By His wonderful Works we see plainly enough, That the Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulness thereof. If we hunger and thirst, and are ready to faint, A Relief in due Season prevents our Complaint; The Rain at His Word brings us Food from the Sky, And Rocks become Rivers, when we are a-dry. VIII From the fruitfullest Hill to the barrenest Rock, The Lord hath made all for the Sake of His Flock; And the Flock, in Return, the Lord always confess In Plenty their Joy, and their Hope in Distress. He beholds in our Welfare His Glory display'd, And we find ourselves blest in Obedience repaid; With a cheerful Regard we attend to His Ways; Our Attention is Pray'r, and our Cheerfulness Praise. IX The Lord is my Shepherd,—what then shall I fear? What Danger can frighten me, whilst He is near? Not, when the Time calls me to walk thro' the Vale Of the Shadow of Death, shall my Heart ever fail; Tho' afraid, of myself, to pursue the dark Way, Thy Rod and Thy Staff be my Comfort and Stay; For I know, by Thy Guidance, when once it is pass'd, To a Fountain of Life it will bring me at last. X The Lord is become my Salvation and Song; His Blessing shall follow me all my Life long. Whatsoever Condition he places me in, I am sure 'tis the best it could ever have been. For the Lord, He is good, and His Mercies are sure; He only afflicts us in order to cure. The Lord will I praise, while I have any Breath, Be content with my Life, and resign'd at my Death! A THANKSGIVING-HYMN. I O come, let us sing to the Lord a new Song, And praise Him to whom all our Praises belong; While we enter His Temple with Gladness and Joy, Let a Psalm of Thanksgiving our Voices employ; O come, to His Name let us joyfully sing; For the Lord is a great and omnipotent King: By His Word were the Heav'ns and the Host of them made, And of all the round World the Foundation He laid! II He plac'd in the Centre yon beautiful Sun And the Orbs that about him due Distances run; To receive, as they haste their vast Rounds to complete, Of a Lustre so dazzling the Light and the Heat. What Language of Men can the Brightness unfold Of His Presence, Whose Creature they cannot behold? What a Light is His Light! Of Its infinite Day The Sun by his Splendour can paint but a Ray. III The Sun in the Evening is out of our Sight, And the Moon is enlighten'd to govern the Night. His Power we behold in yon high-archèd Roof, When the Stars in their Order shine forth in its Proof. While the Works, so immense, of Thy Fingers we see, And reflect on our Littleness, Lord, what are we? Yet, while 'tis our Glory Thy Name to adore, Even Angels of Heav'n cannot boast any more. IV Praise the Lord, upon Earth, all ye Nations and Lands, Ye Seasons and Times, that fulfil His Commands; Let His Works in all Places His Goodness proclaim, And the People who see them give Thanks to His Name! For the Good, which He wills to communicate, brings Into visible Form His invisible Things; Their Appearance may change, as His Law shall ordain, But the Goodness That forms will for ever remain. V What a World of good Things does all Nature produce, Which the Lord in His Mercy hath made for our Use! The Earth, by His Blessing bestow'd on its Soil, By His Rain and His Sunshine, gives Corn, Wine, and Oil. Let Men to adore Him, then, thankfully join, When fill'd with His Bread, or made glad by His Wine; As in Wealth, so in Gratitude, let them abound, And the Voice of His Praise be heard all the World round! VI They that o'er the wide Ocean their Bus'ness pursue, Can tell to His Wonders what Praises are due. When, tost to and fro by the huge swelling Wave, They rise up to Heav'n, or sink down to the Grave; Dismay'd with the Tempest, that mocks at their Skill, They cry to the Lord, and He maketh it still. His Works in Remembrance, ye Mariners, keep, And praise Him Whose Judgments are like the great Deep! VII He stilleth the Waves of the boisterous Sea, And the Tumults of Men, more outrageous than they. Thy Goodness, O Lord, let the People confess, Whom Wars do not waste, nor proud Tyrants oppress; And devoutly contémplate Thy wonderful ways, Thou that turnest the Fierceness of Men to Thy Praise! Then Lands, in due Season, shall yield their Increase, And the Lord give His People the Blessings of Peace. VIII The Lord He is high, far above all our Thought,— How then shall we worship Him so as we ought? What Tongue can express, or what Words can shew forth, The Praise which is due to His excellent Worth? Ye Righteous, and ye that in Virtue excel, Begin the glad Task which becomes you so well! The Lord shall be pleas'd when He heareth your Voice, And in His own Works shall th'Almighty rejoice. IX The Lord hath His Dwelling far out of our View, And yet humbleth Himself to behold what we do; To His Works all around Him His Mercies extend; His Works have no Number, His Mercies no End. He accepteth our Thanks, if the Heart do but pay; Tho' we never can reach Him, by all we can say. How just is the Duty, how pure the Delight, Since, whilst we give Praises, we Honour Him right! X Praise the Lord, O my Soul! All the Pow'rs of my Mind, Praise the Lord, Who hath been so exceedingly kind; Who spareth my Life and forgiveth my Sin, Still directeth the Way that I ought to walk in! When I speak, let me thank Him; whenever I write, The Remembrance of Him let the Subject excite; Guide, Lord, to Thy Glory my Tongue and my Pen; Yea, let ev'ry Thing praise Thee!—Amen, and Amen! A HYMN ON THE DIVINE OMNIPRESENCE. I O lord, Thou hast known me and searchèd me out; Thou see'st at all Times what I'm thinking about When I rise up to Labour, or lie down to Rest, Thou markest each Motion that works in my Breast. My Heart has no Secrets but what Thou can'st tell; Not a Word in my Tongue but Thou knowest it well; Thou see'st my Intention before it is wrought; Long before I conceive it, Thou knowest my Thought. II Thou art always about me, go whither I will; All the Paths that I take to, I meet with Thee still. I go forth abroad, and am under Thine Eye; I retire to myself, and, behold! Thou art by. How is it that Thou hast encompass'd me so, That I cannot escape Thee, wherever I go? Such Knowledge as this is too high to attain; 'Tis a Truth which I feel, tho' I cannot explain. III Whither, then, shall I flee from Thy Spirit, O Lord? What Shelter can Space from Thy Presence afford? If I climb up to Heav'n, 'tis there is Thy throne; If I go down to Hell, even there Thou art known; If for Wings I should mount on the Morning's Swift Ray, And remain in the uttermost Parts of the Sea,— Even there, let the Distance be ever so wide, Thy Hand would support me, Thy right Hand would guide. IV If I say, “Peradventure, the Dark may conceal What Distance, tho' boundless, is forc'd to reveal,”— Yet the Dark, at Thy Presence, would vanish away, And my Cov'ring, the Night, would be turn'd into Day. It is I myself only who could not then see,— Yea, the Darkness, O Lord, is no Darkness to Thee; The Night and the Day are alike in Thy Sight, And the Darkness to Thee is as clear as the Light. GOD THE ONLY TRUE TEACHER. A Fragment. The Lord is my Light; by His Teaching I learn With a right Understanding His Works to discern. While I dwell in His Presence, 'tis then that I live, And enjoy a Content which He only can give. In all other Things I have labour'd to find That Truth which might fill an intelligent Mind; But I labour'd in vain; for it is He alone That can give me Instruction, and make Himself known. A PARAPHRASE ON THE LORD'S PRAYER. Our Father which art in Heaven. “Father”—to think of His paternal Care Is a most sweet Encouragement to Pray'r. “Our Father”—all Men's Father — to remind That we should love, as Brethren, all Mankind. “Which art in Heaven”—assures an heav'nly Birth To all His loving Children upon Earth. Hallowed be Thy Name. “Name”—is expressive of a real Thing, With all the Pow'rs of which it is the Spring. “Thy Name”—is therefore to be understood: “Thy Blessèd Self, Thou Fountain of all Good.” “Be Hallowèd—be lov'd, obey'd, ador'd, By inward Pray'r habitually implor'd. Thy Kingdom come. “Kingdom”—of Grace at present, Seed and Root Of future Glory's everlasting Fruit. “Thy Kingdom”—not the World's War-shifted Scene Of Pomp and Show, but Love's all-peaceful Reign. “Come”—rule within our Hearts, by Grace Divine, Till all the Kingdoms of the World be Thine. Thy Will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven. “Thy Will”—to ev'ry Good that boundless Pow'rs Can raise, if we conform to it with ours. “Be done in Earth,”—where Doing of His Will Promotes all Good, and overcomes all Ill. “As 'tis in Heav'n,”—where all the Blest above Serve with one Will the Living Source of Love. Give us this Day our daily Bread. “Give us”—implies Dependence, whilst we live, Not on ourselves, but what He wills to give. “This Day”—cuts off all covetous Desire Of more, and more than real Wants require. Our daily Bread—whatever we shall need, And rightly use, to make it Ours indeed. And forgive us our Trespasses. “Forgive”—betokens penitential Sense, And Hope for Pardon, of confess'd Offence. “Us”—takes in all, but hints the special Part Of ev'ry one, to look to his own Heart. “Our Trespasses,”—which the forgiving Grace, By our sincere Conversion, must efface. As We forgive them that trespass against Us. “As We forgive,”—because the fairest Claim To Mercy pray'd for is to shew the same, And we who pray should all be minded thus To pardon them—“that trespass against Us.” Without forgiving, Christ was pleas'd to add, Our own Forgiveness never can be had. And lead us not into Temptation. “Temptation”—rises in this World, the Field Of Good and Evil, and incites to yield. “Lead us not into it”—becomes the Voice Of all, who would not go to it by Choice; Whose Resignation, mix'd with meek Distrust Of their own Strength, is more securely just. But deliver Us from Evil. “But”—when Temptation will, of coursè, arise, The Hand that leads can minister Supplies. “Deliver Us”—instructs the Soul to place Its firm Reliance on protecting Grace. “From Evil,”—from the greatest Evil, Sin; The only one not to be safely in. For Thine is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory. “Thine is the Kingdom,”—the essential Right To sov'reign Rule and Majesty and Might. “Thine is the Pow'r”—to bless and to redeem; All else is weak whatever it may seem. “Thine is the Glory,”—manifestly found In all Thy Works, the whole Creation round. For Ever and Ever. “For Ever”—from an unbeginning Source Almighty Love pursues Its endless Course. Through all its Scenes, Eternity displays New Wonders to our Heav'nly Father's Praise. King, Father, Leader, Judge, His Hallow'd Name Was, is, and ever shall be, still the same Amen. “Amen”—is “Truth,” in Hebrew; and “Consent To Truth receiv'd” by its long Use is meant. Jesus, Himself the Truth, the Living Way, The Faithful Witness, teaches us to pray. Again should we be learning and again, Till Life becomes a practical “Amen.” THE COLLECT FOR ADVENT SUNDAY. A lmighty God, Thy Heavn'ly Grace impart, And cast the Works of Darkness from our Heart; Send us Thy Light, and arm us for the Strife Against all Evils of this mortal Life, O'er which our Saviour Jesus Christ, Thy Son, With great Humility the Conquest won: That, when in Glory our Victorious Head Shall come to judge the Living and the Dead, We may thro' Him to Life immortal spring, Wherein He reigns, the Everlasting King; The Father, Son, and Spirit may adore, One glorious God Triune, for evermore! A HYMN FOR CHRISTMAS DAY. I On this auspicious, memorable Morn, God and the Virgin's Holy Child was born; Offspring of Heav'n, Whose Undefilèd Birth Began the Process of redeeming Earth,— Of re-producing Paradise again And God's lost Image in the Souls of Men. II Adam, who kept not his first State of Bliss, Render'd himself incapable of this; Nor could he, with his outward Helpmate Eve, This pure, angelic, virgin Birth retrieve: This, in our Nature, never could be done, Until a Virgin should conceive a Son. III Mary, prepar'd for such a chaste Embrace, Was destin'd to this Miracle of Grace; In her unfolded the mysterious Plan Of Man's Salvation, God's becoming Man; His Power, with her Humility combin'd, Produc'd the Sinless Saviour of Mankind. IV The Height and Depth of such Amazing Love Nor can we measure, nor the Blest above; Its Truth whoever reasons right will own: Man never could be sav'd by Man alone; Salvation is, if rightly we define, Union of Human Nature with Divine. V What Way to this, unless it had been trod By the new Birth of an Incarnate God? Birth of a Life, That triumphs over Death, A Life inspir'd by God's Immortal Breath; For which Himself, to save us from the Tomb, Did not abhor the Virgin Mother's Womb. VI O may this Infant Saviour's Birth inspire Of real Life an humble, chaste Desire; Raise it up in us, form it in our Mind, Like the Blest Virgin's, totally resign'd! A mortal Life from Adam we derive; We are in Christ eternally alive. A HYMN FOR THE SAME. Christians, awake! Salute the happy Morn Whereon the Saviour of the World was born! Rise, to adore the Mystery of Love, Which Hosts of Angels chanted from above; With them the joyful Tidings first begun Of God Incarnate, and the Virgin's Son. Then to the watchful Shepherds it was told, Who heard th' Angelic Herald's Voice: “Behold! I bring good tidings of a Saviour's Birth To you and all the Nations upon Earth; This Day hath God fulfill'd his promis'd Word; This Day is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord. In David's City, Shepherds, ye shall find The long-foretold Redeemer of Mankind; Wrapt up in swaddling-clothes, the Babe Divine Lies in a Manger; this shall be your Sign.” He spake, and straightway the Celestial Choir In Hymns of Joy, unknown before, conspire; The Praises of Redeeming Love they sung, And Heav'ns whole Orb with Hallelujah's rung. “God's highest Glory” was their Anthem still, “Peace upon Earth, and mutual Goodwill!” To Bethlehem straight th' enlightened Shepherds ran To see the Wonder God had wrought for Man; And found, with Joseph and the Blessèd Maid, Her Son, the Saviour, in a Manger laid. Amaz'd, the wond'rous Story they proclaim, The first Apostles of his Infant Fame; While Mary keeps and ponders in her Heart The heav'nly Vision which the Swains impart. They to their Flocks, still praising God, return And their glad Hearts within their Bosoms burn. Let us, like these good Shepherds, then, employ Our grateful Voices to proclaim the Joy; Like Mary, let us ponder in our Mind God's wond'rous Love in saving lost Mankind. Artless and watchful as these favour'd Swains, While Virgin Meekness in the Heart remains, Trace we the Babe, who has retriev'd our Loss, From His poor Manger to His bitter Cross; Treading His Steps, assisted by His Grace, Till Man's first heav'nly State again takes Place! Then, may we hope, th' Angelic Thrones among, To sing, redeem'd, a glad Triumphal Song. He That was born upon this joyful Day Around us all His Glory shall display; Sav'd by His Love, incessant we shall sing Of Angels and of Angel-men the King. ON THE EPIPHANY. I Led by the Guidance of a living Star, The Eastern Sages travell'd from afar To seek the Saviour, by prophetic Fame Describ'd to them as “King of Jews” by Name; Whose Birth to Gentiles worthy of His Sight Was now declar'd by this angelic Light. II To its full Height th' Expectancy had grown Of what the learnèd Foreigners made known, When at Jerusalem the sacred News Was spread by them to Herod and the Jews. “Where is He born? For by His Star,” they said, “Thus far to worship Him have we been led.” III Herod, who had in his tyrannic Mind No Thought of Empire but of earthy Kind, Jealous of this new King of Jewish Tribes, In Haste assembl'd all the Priests and Scribes; Where Christ was to be born, was his Demand. “In Bethlehem,” they said, “in Judah's Land.” IV He call'd the Magi privately again, To learn from them the Time precisely, when The Star which had conducted them appear'd; And, having all his wily Questions clear'd, Bade them to seek the Child, and from the View Come, and tell him, that he might worship too. V They journey'd on to the appointed Place, Which Jewish Priests from Prophecy could trace, Cheer'd by the Star's Appearance on the Way, That pointed where the Infant Saviour lay. Meekly they stepp'd into His humble Shrine, And fell to worshipping the Babe Divine. VI The Virgin Mother saw them all prefer Their Off'rings, Gold, and Frankincense, and Myrrh; But warn'd of God, His Father, in a Dream, They disappointed Herod's murd'rous Scheme; And, having seen the Object of their Faith, Sought their own Country by another Path. VII Does not Reflexion justly hence arise, That in the East, so famous for the Wise, The truest Learning, Sapience and Skill Was theirs, who sought amidst the various Ill Which they beheld for that predicted Scene, That should on Earth commence an heav'nly Reign? VIII These true Enquirers into Nature saw That Nature must have some superior Law, Some righteous Monarch, for the Good of all, To rule with Justice this disorder'd Ball; Their humble Sense of Wants, o'erlook'd by Pride, Made them so worthy of the Starlike Guide. IX We read how, then, the very Pagan School Was fill'd with Rumours of a Jewish Rule. Tho' Jews themselves, as at this present Day, Dreamt of a worldly domineering Sway, The truly wise, or Jew or Gentile, sought A Christ, the Object of an happier Thought. X They best could understand prophetic Page, Simple or learn'd, the Shepherd or the Sage; Their Eyes could see, and follow a true Light, That led them on from Prophecy to Sight; Could own the Son, Who by the Father's Will Should reign a King on Sion's holy Hill. XI Of Treasures which the Wise were mov'd to bring, If Gold presented might confess the King, Incense to his Divinity relate, And Myrrh denote his bitter, suff'ring State,— They offer'd Types of the Theandric Plan Of our Salvation, God's becoming Man. XII In this redeeming Process all concurr'd To give sure Proof of the prophetic Word; Jesus, Emmanuel, the Inward Light Of all Mankind who seek the Truth aright, Forms in the Heart of all the Wise on Earth The true Day-Star, the Token of His Birth. MEDITATIONS FOR EVERY DAY IN PASSION-WEEK. MONDAY. God in Christ is all Love. I Behold the tender Love of God! Behold The Shepherd dying to redeem His Fold! Who can declare it? Worthy to be known, What Tongue can speak it worthily? His Own. From His Own Sacred Lips the Theme began, The glorious Gospel of God's Love to Man. II So great, so boundless was It, that He gave His Only Son,—and for what End?—To save, Not to condemn. If Men reject the Light, They, of themselves, condemn themselves to Night; God in His Son seeks only to display In ev'ry Heart an everlasting Day. III “God hath so shown His Love to us,” says Paul, “Even yet Sinners, that Christ died for all;” Peter, that God's All-gracious Aim is this, By Christ, to call us to eternal Bliss. Of all th' inspir'd to understand the View, Love is the Text, and Love the Comment too. IV The Ground to build all Faith and Works upon; For “God is Love,” says the belovèd John,— Short Word, but Meaning infinitely wide, Including all that can be said beside; Including all the joyfull Truths above The Pow'r of Eloquence, for “God is Love.” V Think on the Proof that John from Jesus learn'd: “In this was God's Amazing Love discern'd, Because He sent His Son to us, that we Might live thro' Him!” How plain it is to see That, if in this, in ev'ry other Fact, Where God is Agent, Love is in the Act; VI Essential Character (whatever word Of diff'rent Sound in Scripture has occurr'd) Of all that is ascrib'd to God, of all That can by His Immediate Will befall: The Sun's bright Orb may lose its shining Flame, But Love remains unchangeably the same. TUESDAY. How Christ quencheth the Wrath of God in us. I The Saviour died, according to our Faith, To quench, atone, or pacify a Wrath. But “God is Love;” He has no Wrath His Own; Nothing in Him to quench or to atone. Of all the Wrath that Scripture has reveal'd, The poor fall'n Creature wanted to be heal'd. II God, of His own pure Love, was pleas'd to give The Lord of Life, that thro' Him it might live,— Thro' Christ; because none other could be found To heal the human Nature of its Wound. This great Physician of the Soul had, sure, In Him, Who gave Him, no Defect to cure. III He did, He suffer'd ev'ry Thing, that we From Wrath, by Sin enkindled, might be free,— The Wrath of God in us, that is, the Fire Of burning Life without the Love-Desire, Without the Light which Jesus came to raise, And change the wrath into a joyful Blaze. IV The Wrath is God's, but in Himself unfelt; As Ice and Frost are His, and Pow'r to melt. Not even Man could any Wrath, as such, Till he had lost his first Perfection, touch; God has but One Immutable Good-will, To bless His Creatures and to save from Ill. V Cordial or bitter a Physician's Draught, The Patient's Health is in his ord'ring Thought; God's Mercies or God's Judgments be the Name, Eternal Health is His all-saving Aim. “Vengeance belongs to God,”—and so it should, For Love alone can turn it all to Good. VI All that in Nature by His Act is done, Is to give Life, and Life is in His Son. When His Humility, His Meekness finds Healing Admission into willing Minds, All Wrath disperses, like a gath'ring Sore; Pain is its Cure, and it exists no more. WEDNESDAY. Christ satisfieth the Justice of God by fulfilling all Righteousness. I “Justice demandeth Satisfaction.”—Yes, And ought to have it where Injustice is. But,—there is none in God; it cannot mean Demand of Justice where it has full Reign: To dwell in Man it rightfully demands, Such as he came from his Creator's Hands. II Man had departed from a righteous State, Which he at first must have, if God create. 'Tis therefore call'd “God's Righteousness,” and must Be satisfy'd by Man's becoming just; Must exercise good Vengeance upon Men, Till it regain Its Rights in them again. III This was the Justice for which Christ became A Man, to satisfy Its righteous Claim; Became Redeemer of the Human Race, That Sin in them to Justice might give Place. To “satisfy” a just and righteous Will Is neither more nor less than to “fulfill.” IV It was in God the loving Will that sought The Joy of having Man's Salvation wrought; Hence, in His Son so infinitely pleas'd With Righteousness fulfill'd and Wrath appeas'd— Not with mere Suff'ring which He never wills, But with mere Love That triumph'd over Ills. V 'Twas tender Mercy,—by the Church confess'd, Before she feeds the sacramental Guest, Rememb'ring Him Who offer'd up His Soul “A Sacrifice for Sin, full, perfect, whole, Sufficient, satisfactory,”—and all That Words (how short of Merit!) can recall. VI And when receiv'd His Body and His Blood, The Life enabling to be just and good,— Off'ring available thro' Him alone, Body and Soul a Sacrifice her own, From Him, from His,—so, Justice has Its due, Itself restor'd, not any thing in Lieu. THURSDAY. Christ the Beginner and Finisher of the New Life in Man. I Dead as Men are in Trespasses and Sins, Whence is it in them that new Life begins? 'Tis that, by God's great Mercy, Love and Grace The Seed of Christ is in the Human Race,— That inward, hidden Man, that can revive And, “dead in Adam, rise in Christ alive.” II Life natural and Life Divine possess'd Must needs unite, to make a Creature bless'd,— The first, a feeling Hunger and Desire Of what it cannot of itself acquire; Wherein the second entering to dwell, Makes all an Heav'n that would be else an Hell. III As only Light all Darkness can expel, So was His Conquest over Death and Hell The only possible, effectual Way To raise to Life what Adam's Sin could slay. Death by the falling, by the Rising Man The Resurrection of the Dead, began. IV This Heav'nly Parent of the human Race The Steps that Adam fell by could retrace; Could bear the Suff'rings requisite to save; Could die, a Man, and triumph o'er the Grave. This for our Sakes Incarnate Love could do; Great is the Mystery, and greatly true. V Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs and the Choir Of holy Virgin Witnesses conspire To animate a Christian to endure Whatever Cross God gives him for his Cure,— Looking to Jesus Who has led the way From Death to Life, from Darkness into Day. VI Unmov'd by earthly Good or earthly Ill, The Man Christ Jesus wrought God's Blesséd Will; Death, in the Nature of the Thing, that Hour Wherein He died, lost all its deadly Pow'r; Then, then was open'd, by what He sustain'd, The Gate of Life, and Paradise regain'd. FRIDAY. How the Sufferings and Death of Christ are available to Man's Salvation. I With Hearts deep-rooted in Love's Holy Ground Should be ador'd this Mystery profound Of God's Messiah suff'ring in our Frame, The Lamb Christ Jesus—blessed be His Name!— Dying in this Humanity of ours, To introduce His own Life-giving Pow'rs. II Herein is Love! Descending from His Throne, The Father's Bosom, for our Sakes alone, What Earth, what Hell, could wrathfully unite Of Ills, He vanquish'd with enduring Might; Legions of Angels ready at Command, Singly He chose to bear and to withstand:— III To bear, intent upon Mankind's Relief, Ev'ry Excess of ev'ry Shame and Grief,— Of inward Anguish past all Thought severe, Such as Pure Innocence alone could bear. Dev'lish Temptation, Treachery, and Rage, Naked, for us, did Innocence engage. IV Nail'd to a Cross It suffer'd, and forgave; And show'd the Penitent Its Pow'r to save; Its Majesty confess'd by Nature's Shock, Darkness and Earthquake, and the rended Rock, And opening Graves,—the Prelude to that Pow'r Which rose in Suff'ring Love's momentous Hour. V No other Pow'r could save, but Jesus can; The Living God was in the Dying Man; Who, perfected by Suff'rings, from the Grave Rose in the Fulness of all Pow'r to save, With that one blesséd Life of God to fill The vacant Soul that yieldeth up its Will. VI To learn is ev'ry pious Christian's Part From his great Master this most Holy Art; This our high Calling, Privilege, and Prize: With Him to suffer, and with Him to rise,— To live,—to die,—meek, patient, and resign'd To God's good Pleasure with a Christ-like Mind. SATURDAY. How Christ by his Death overcame Death. I Jesus is crucified,—the previous Scene Of our Salvation and His glorious Reign—. Mysterious Process,—though by Nature's Laws, Such an Effect demanded such a Cause; For none but He could form the grand Design, And raise anew the human Life Divine! II No less a Mystery can claim Belief Than what belongs to our Redeeming Chief. Divine and Supernatural indeed The Love that mov'd the Son of God to bleed; But what He was and did, in each Respect, Was real Cause producing its Effect. III Children of Adam needs must share his Fall, Children of Christ can re-inherit All. This was the One, and therefore Chosen, Way For Love to manifest its full Display. Absurd the Thought of arbitrary Plans; Nature's one, true Religion this,—and Man's! IV All that we know of God, and Nature too, Proves the Salvation of the Gospel true; Where all unites in One Consistent Whole, The Life of God renew'd within the Soul,— Renew'd by Christ: He only could restore The Heav'n in Man to what it was before; V Could raise God's Image, clos'd in Death by Sin, And raise Himself, the Light of Life, therein,— The One Same Light that makes angelic Bliss; That spreads an Heav'n thro' Nature's whole Abyss,— The Light of Nature, and the Light of Men, That gives the Dead His Pow'r to live again. VI “The Way, the Truth, the Life,”—whatever Terms Preferr'd, 'tis Him that ev'ry Good affirms The One True Saviour; all is Dung and Dross In saving Sense, but Jesus and His Cross. All Nature speaks, all Scripture answers thus: “Salvation is the Life of Christ in us.” EASTER COLLECT. Almighty God, Whose Blessèd Will was done By Jesus Christ, our Lord, Thine Only Son,— Death overcome, and open'd unto Men The Gate of everlasting Life again,— Grant us, baptis'd into His Death, to die To all Affections but to Things on high; That when, by Thy preventing Grace, we find The good Desires to rise within our Mind, Our Wills may tend as Thine shall still direct, And bring the good Desires to good Effect Thro' Him, the One Redeemer from the Fall, Who liv'd and died and rose again for all! EASTER DAY. I The Morning dawns; the third approaching Day Can only show the Place where Jesus lay. Angels descend:—“Remember what He said! He is not here, but risen from the dead: ‘Betray'd into the Hands of sinful Men, The Son of Man must die, and rise again.’” II So sang the Prophets ever since the Fall; Of Rites ordain'd the Meaning this thro' all. This, by the various Sacrifice of old, Memorial Type and Shadow, was foretold; Even false worship, careless what it meant, Gave to this Truth an ignorant Consent. III Christ is the Sum and Substance of the whole That God has done or said to save a Soul, To raise himself a Church; when that is done, The World becomes the Kingdom of his Son, An Heav'n restor'd to the redeem'd, the born Of Him Who rose on this auspicious Morn. IV He That was dead, in order to restore, Behold, He is alive for evermore,— An heav'nly Adam, full empow'rd to give The Life that Men were first designed to live; Fountain of Life, come whosoever will To quench his Thirst, and freely take his Fill! V Mankind in Him are Life's predestin'd Heirs, His rising Glories the First-fruits of theirs. Hearts that renounce the Slavery to Sin, Feel of His Pow'r the living Warmth within, Of strength'ning Faith, of joyous Hope possest And Heav'n-producing Love within the Breast,— VI The Breast,—the Temple of the Holy Ghost, When once enliven'd by this heav'nly Host. His Resurrection, the sure Proof of ours, Will there exert His Death-destroying Pow'rs; Till all his Sons shall meet before His Throne In glorious Bodies, fashion'd like His Own. AN HYMN FOR EASTER DAY. I. The Lord is risen! He who came To suffer Death, and conquer too, Is risen! Let our Song proclaim The Praise to Man's Redeemer due:— To Him Whom God in tender Love, Always alike to bless inclin'd, Sent to redeem us from above; To save, to sanctify Mankind! Chorus. Worthy of all Pow'r and Praise HE Who died and rose again, Lamb of GOD, and slain to raise MAN, to Life redeem'd!—Amen. II. That Life which Adam ceas'd to live, When to this World he turn'd his Heart, And to his Children could not give, The Second Adam can impart. We, on our earthly Parent's Side, Could but receive a Life of Earth; The Lord from Heaven, He liv'd, and died, And rose, to give us Heav'nly Birth. Cho. Worthy of all Pow'r and Praise, &amp;c. III. This mortal Life, this living Death, Shows that in Adam we all die; In Christ we have Immortal Breath And Life's Unperishing Supply. HE took our Nature, and sustain'd The Mis'ries of its sinful State; Sinless Himself, for Us regain'd To Paradise an Open Gate. Cho. Worthy of all Pow'r and Praise, &amp;c. IV. As Adam rais'd a Life of Sin, So Christ, the Serpent-bruising Seed, By God's Appointment could begin The Birth in Us of Life indeed. He did begin, Parental Head;— As Adam fell, so Jesus stood; Fulfill'd all Righteousness, and said, “'Tis finish'd!” on the Sacred Wood. Cho. Worthy of all Pow'r and Praise, &amp;c. V. Finish'd His Work, to quench the Wrath That Sin had brought on Adam's Race; To pave the Sole and Certain Path From Nature's Life to that of Grace! For Joy of this, God's Only Son Endur'd the Cross, despis'd the Shame, And gave the Victory so won, For imitating Love to claim. Cho. Worthy of all Pow'r and Praise, &amp;c. VI. To tread the Path that Jesus trod, Aided by Him, be our Employ; To die to Sin, and live to God, And yield him the fair-purchas'd Joy; To all the Laws that Love has made Stedfast, unshaken to attend!— He died, He rose, Himself our Aid, “Lo! I am with you to the End.” Chorus. Worthy of all Pow'r and Praise HE who died and rose again, Lamb of GOD, and slain to raise MAN, to Life redeem'd!—Amen. ON WHITSUNDAY. I Jesus, ascended into Heav'n again, Bestow'd this wond'rous Gift upon good Men: That various Nations, by his Spirit led, All understood what Galileans said. He gave the Word, Who form'd the list'ning Ear, And Truth became in ev'ry Language clear. II One Country's Tongue, to His Apostles known, To ev'ry pious Soul became its own; The well-dispos'd, from all the World around, With holy Wonder, heard the Gospel-Sound, Their Hearts prepar'd to hear it; God's Command No Obstacle in Nature could withstand. III Nature itself, if ev'ry Heart was right, All jarring Languages would soon unite. Her's is but one, intelligible Guide; But Tongues are numberless, where Hearts divide. The Babel-Projects bring them to their Birth, And scatter Discord o'er the Face of Earth. IV The Prince of Peace now sending from above His Holy Spirit of Uniting Love, By Its Miraculous Effusion show'd, How great a Pow'r He promis'd and bestow'd,— Pow'r to reverse Confusion, and impart One living Word to ev'ry honest Heart. V Deaf to its Influence the Wicked stood, And mock'd the just Amazement of the Good, For want of Sense ascribing to new Wine Their joint Acknowledgments of Grace Divine. The World's devout Epitome was taught, And hid from Pride the Miracle, when wrought;— VI Known to the Meek, but from the Worldly-Wise, From Scoffers, hid the wonderful Supplies Of God's good Spirit, now as near to Men Whose Hearts are open to the Truth as then. Blest, in all Climates, all Conditions, they Who hear this inward Teacher and obey! ON TRINITY SUNDAY. I Co-equal Trinity was always taught By the Divines most fam'd for pious Thought. The Men of Learning fill'd, indeed, the Page With dissonant Disputes, from Age to Age; But with themselves, so far as one can read, About their Schemes are not at all agreed, When they oppos'd, by Reason or by Wrath, This grand Foundation of the Christian Faith. II For what more fundamental Point, or grand, Than our ascending Saviour's own Command: “Go and baptise all Nations in the Name”— Of Whom, or What? (For thence the surest Aim Of Christian Doctrine must appear the most)— “The Name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost?” Our Lord's Interpretation here we see, Of, “Thou shalt have no other Gods but Me.” III For can the Phrase, so Highly Sacred, show The Name of God to be omitted? No! By its essential Trinity exprest, It show'd what Faith Christ will'd to be profest. One God the Jews had own'd, and one Supreme, With others lower, was the Pagan Theme; How One was true, and how Supreme profan'd, Our Lord's baptismal Ordinance explain'd. IV The One Divinity of Father, Son, And Spirit, teaches Christian Thought to shun Both pagan and rabbinical Mistake, And understood what holy Prophets spake Or in the Ancient Writings or the New, To which this Doctrine is the sacred Clue; That so conducts us to the saving Plan Of true Religion as no other can. V For, were the Son's Divinity denied, The Father's must, of course, be set aside, Or be a dark one.—How can It be Bright, But by Its own Eternal, Inborn Light? The Glory of the Father is the Son, Of all His Powers begotten, or begun, From all Eternity; take Son away, And what the Father can delight in, say! VI The Love, Paternally Divine, implies Its proper Object whence It must arise, That is, the Son; and so the Filial, too, Implies Paternal Origin in View; And hence the third distinctly glorious Tie Of Love, which Both are animated by. All is one God, but He contains Divine, Living Relations, evidently Trine. VII So far from hurting Unity, that hence The Fulness rises of Its perfect Sense, And ev'ry barren, spiritless Dispute Against Its Truth is pluck'd up by the Root. The Faith is solid to repose upon: Father, Word, Spirit, Undivided One; By Whom Mankind, of Threefold Life possest, Can live and move and have its Being blest;— VIII Not by Three Gods,—or One supremely great With two Inferiors,—or the wild Conceit “God, Michael, Gabriel,”—or aught else, devis'd For Christians in no Creature's Name baptis'd; But of the whole inseparable Three Whose Fertile Oneness causes all to be, And makes an Heav'n thro' Nature's whole Abyss By its Parental, Filial, Spirit Bliss. ON THE SAME. I “One God the Father.”—Certainly, this Term Does not a barren Deity affirm Without the Son,—without the Native Light, By which Its Fiery Majesty is Bright,— Without the Spirit of the Fire and Flame Of Life Divine, eternally the same. II More One than any Thing beside can be, Because of Its inseparable Three; Which Nothing can diminish, or divide, Tho' it should break all Unity beside. For This, as self-begetting, self-begot, And to Itself proceeding, It can not. III This total Oneness of Its Threefold Bliss, Life, Light, and Joy of Nature's vast Abyss, No Tongue so well can utter; but the Mind That seeks for somewhat to object, may find No End of Questions, if we must contest A Truth by Saints of ev'ry Age exprest. IV The Church did always, always will, agree In its one Worship of the Holy Three,— As taught by Christ, that Unity Divine Was full and perfect, that is, Unitrine. He said: “Baptise all Nations, and proclaim Of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the Name!” V The “Holy! Holy! Holy!” of the Host Of Heav'n is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; Not “Holy! Holier!” and “Holiest!” But One Tri-une, Same Holiness confest,— One God, One Loving and Belovèd Love, On Earth below ador'd, in Heav'n above.— VI One Living Fulness of all Perfect Good, Its own Essential Fountain, Stream and Flood. And when, according to the Christian Creed, Men worship God in Spirit, Word, and Deed, Faith, Hope, and Love's Triunity of Grace Will find in their true, single Heart a Place. ATHEISM THE ONLY GROUND OF DISCONTENT. If Reason does each private Person bind To seek the public Welfare of Mankind; If this be Justice and the Sacred Law That guards the Good and keeps the Bad in Awe; If this great Law but op'rates to fulfil One Vast Almighty Being's Righteous Will; And if He Only, as we all maintain, Does all Things rule and all Events ordain:— Then, Reason bids each private Man t' assent That none but Atheists can be discontent. A CAUTION AGAINST DESPAIR. I Despair is a cowardly Thing, And the Spirit suggesting it bad; In spite of my Sins I will sing, That Mercy is still to be had. II For He that has shown it so far, As to give me a sensible Heart, How heinous soever they are, Delights in the merciful Part. III By Affliction, so heavy to bear, He searches the Wound He would cure; 'Tis His to be kindly severe, 'Tis mine by His Grace to endure. IV O comfort thyself in His Love, Poor sinful and sorrowful Soul, Who came, and still comes, from above To the Sick that would fain be made whole! V Who said, and continues to say, In the Deep of a penitent Breast: “Come, Sinner, to Me come away: I'll meet thee, and bring thee to Rest.” VI A Refusal to come is absurd; I'll put myself under his Care; I'll believe His Infallible Word, And never, no, never despair. A PENITENTIAL SOLILOQUY. I What tho' no Objects strike upon the Sight,— Thy Sacred Presence is an inward Light. What tho' no Sounds should penetrate the Ear,— To list'ning Thought the Voice of Truth is clear. Sincere Devotion needs no outward shrine: The Centre of an humble Soul is Thine. II There may I worship, and there may'st Thou place Thy Seat of Mercy and Thy Throne of Grace; Yea, fix, if Christ my Advocate appear, The dread Tribunal of Thy Justice there! Let each vain Thought, let each impure Desire Meet in Thy Wrath with a consuming Fire! III Whilst the kind Rigours of a righteous Doom All deadly Filth of selfish Pride consume, Thou, Lord, can'st raise, tho' punishing for Sin, The Joys of peaceful Penitence within. Thy Justice and Thy Mercy both are sweet That make our suff'rings and Salvation meet. IV Befall me, then, whatever God shall please! His Wounds are healing, and His Griefs give Ease; He, like a true Physician of the Soul, Applies the Med'cine that may make it whole. I'll do, I'll suffer whatsoe'er He wills: I see His Aim thro' all these transient Ills. V 'Tis to infuse a salutary Grief, To fit the Mind for absolute Relief, That, purg'd from ev'ry false and finite Love, Dead to the World, alive to Things above, The Soul may rise, as in its first-form'd Youth, And worship God “in Spirit and in Truth.” FOR THE DUE IMPROVEMENT OF A FUNERAL SOLEMNITY. I A round the Grave of a departed Friend If due Concern has prompted to attend, Deep on our Minds let the affecting Scenes Imprint the Lesson which Attendance means; For who can tell how soon his own Adieu The solemn Service may for Him renew? II “He that believes on Me” (what Christ had said The Priest proclaims) “shall live tho' he were dead.” To ev'ry Heart This is the gracious Call, On which depends its everlasting All; The ever-hoping, -loving, -working Faith That saves a Soul from Death's devouring Wrath. III The patient Job, by such a Faith within Strength'ning his Heart, could say: “This mortal Skin Destroy'd, I know that my Redeemer lives.” In Flesh and Blood, which His Redemption gives, Job from the Dust expected to arise, And stand before his God with seeing Eyes. IV The royal Psalmist saw this Life of Man, How vain, how short, at its most lengthen'd Span. Conscious in Whom the Human Trust should be, “Truly my Hope,” he said, “is ev'n in Thee,” And pray'd for its recover'd Strength, “before He went from hence, here to be seen no more.” V The mystic Chapter is rehears'd wherein Paul sings the Triumph over Death and Sin,— The glorious Body, freed from earthy Leav'n, Image and Likeness of the Lord from Heav'n; For such th' abounding in His Work shall gain,— “Labour,” we know, “that never is in vain.” VI Hence comes the sure and certain Hope, to rise In Christ; tho' Man, as born of Woman, dies. True Life, which Adam died to at his Fall, And Christ, the Sinless Adam, can recall, By a New, Heav'nly Birth from Him revives, And breathes again God's Holy Breath of Lives. VII A Voice from Heav'n bade hearing John record: “Blest are the dead, the dying in the Lord!” In them the Pray'r which Man's Redeemer will'd That Men should pray, is perfectly fulfill'd. This perfect Sense the Words that we repeat Require, to make the pray'd-for Good complete. VIII Thanks, then, are due for all the faithful dead, Departed hence to be with Christ their Head, And Pray'r unfainting for His: “Come, ye blest; Come, ye true Children, enter into Rest; Live in My Father's Kingdom and in Mine, In Grace and Love and Fellowship Divine!” VERSES WRITTEN UNDER A PRINT REPRESENTING THE SALUTATION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN. I See represented here, in Light and Shade, The Angel's Visit to the blessed Maid,— To Mary, destin'd, when the Time should come, To bear the Saviour in her virgin womb,— Explaining to her the mysterious Plan Of Man's Redemption,—His becoming Man. II When ev'ry previous Wonder had been done, The Virgin then was to conceive a Son; And, to prepare her for the grand Event, From God His Father Gabriel was sent, To hail the chosen Organ of His Birth,— Of “God with us,” of Jesus upon Earth. III Unable to express celestial Things, Imagination adds expanded Wings To human Form exact and beauteous Face Which Angels have, but with angelic Grace, Free from all Grossness and Defect, nor seen But with a pure chaste Eye, Divinely keen. IV Such Mary's was, whose Posture here design'd The most profound Humility of Mind, Modestly asking how the Thing could be, And saying, when inform'd of God's Decree: “Behold the Handmaid of the Lord! His Will Let Him, according to thy Word, fulfill!” V What fair Instruction may the Scene impart To them who look beyond the Painter's Art! Who in th' angelic Message from above See the Revealing of God's Gracious Love To ev'ry Soul that yields itself to all That pleases Him, whatever may befall! VI Whatever Circumstance of heav'nly Grace Might be peculiar to the Virgin's Case, That holy Thing that saves a Soul from Sin Of God's good Spirit must be born within; For all Salvation is, upon the whole, The Birth of Jesus in the human Soul. VERSES WRITTEN UNDER A PRINT REPRESENTING CHRIST IN THE MIDST OF THE DOCTORS. I Engag'd amidst the Doctors, here behold In deep Discourse a Child of twelve Years old; Who show'd, whatever Question they preferr'd, A Wisdom That astonish'd all who heard, And found in asking or in answ'ring Youth Of Age so Tender such a Force of Truth! II Observe His Mild, but Penetrating Look; Those bearded Sages poring o'er their Book; That meek old Priest, with placid Face of Joy; That pharisaic Frowner at the Boy; That pensive Rabbi, seeming at a Stand; That serious Matron, lifting up her Hand! III A Group of Heads, as painting Fancy taught, Hints at the various Attitude of Thought In diff'rent Hearers, all intent upon The Wond'rous Graces That in Jesus shone; Each Aspect witnessing the same Surprise, From whence His Understanding should arise? IV We know, at present, what the learnèd Jew, Disputing in the Temple, little knew: That, thro' this Child, in every Answer made God's Own Eternal Wisdom was display'd; That their Messiah, then, the Truths instill'd, Which, grown to Man, He perfectly fulfill'd. V We know that His Corporeal Presence then On Earth, as Man, was requisite for Men; That, by His Spirit, He is present still, And always was, to Men of upright Will. To saving Truth, whatever Doctors say, His inward Guidance must assure the Way. VI Whether His Actions therefore be portray'd In printed Letter or in figur'd Shade, The Books, the Pictures that we read or see, Should raise reflexion in some due Degree, And serve as Memorandums to recall The Teacher Jesus in the Midst of All. HUMILITY. Profound Humility! Of every grace That virtue of a God made Man takes place,— Wise as an old man, simple as a child, Like a youth courageous, like a suckling mild; Which is exalted by the deepest fall, Seeks its own nothingness, and enjoys them all. Fountain of every pure untainted joy, Spring of perpetual sweets that never cloy! True liberty of spirit fills the breast, With all the riches of Heaven's Kingdom blest. THE POOR IN SPIRIT. He that [but] spoke it truly, brother John, Possesses all beatitudes in one: True poverty of spirit fills his breast, With all the riches of Heaven's Kingdom blest. LESLIE v. BOURIGNON. True, Leslie was a great divine, but yet I think he quite mistakes my friend's intent; And, with submission to so great a name, His conduct is exceedingly to blame. What has she done to merit all this rage? Why, you shall hear. First, here's the title-page For which this book must be condemned at sight. What is 't? “'Tis blasphemously called ‘The Light,’” Says Leslie, “‘of the World.’” Now, cannot I One jot of blasphemy herein descry; But great divines can with their learned labours See further into mill-stones than their neighbours. PHEBE'S FAN. I. What worship is there in the bended knee, If worldly thoughts transport the mind from Thee? Will Heaven regard uplifted hands and eyes, Whilst on the earth the grovelling spirit lies? If on my person any stander-by Should cast forgetfully his wandering eye, Plant at that time such powerful charms therein, As may convince the mortal for his sin, That, by reproving looks to me unknown, He quit my gestures and compose his own! II. What, though no sounds shall penetrate the ear! To listening thought the Voice of Truth is clear. What, though no object strike upon the sight, Thy Secret Presence is an Inward Light; The mind's devotion needs no outward screen: The centre of [the] humble soul is Thine. There may I worship, and there may'st Thou place Thy Seat of Mercy and Thy Throne of Grace! Yea fix, if Christ our Advocate appear, The Dread Tribunal of Thy Justice there! Let each vain thought, let each impure desire, Meet in Thy Wrath with a consuming fire! The mind, restored to everlasting youth, Shall worship Thee in Spirit and in Truth. TE DEUM. I O thou, Whose Powerful Word gave birth To this vast frame of Heaven and earth; Father of Angels and Mankind; Thou Life of every living mind; At Whose command we sprang from naught, Conscious and capable of thought; Just, Good and True in all Thy ways: Let every creature give Thee praise! II Fix'd on Thy Everlasting Throne, And Happy in Thyself Alone In Pure Communicative Love, Thy Spirit [operates] to [prove] Thy [Mercy] Infinite in Own Self-executed Orders shown; And through the deep abyss of space The beauteous universe takes place. DENOMINATIONS. Churchmen are orthodox, Dissenters pure, But Quakers are God's people to be sure; The Lutherans follow Evangelic Truth, But all the Elect are Calvinists, forsooth; The Baptists only have Regeneration, While out of them there can be no Salvation. We form a Church [compacted?] of the seven;— “Lo, here is Christ! lo, here the way to Heaven!” Thus do the sons of England, Rome, Geneva, Adjure by Jesus like the sons of Sceva,— Wanting the Love that should enforce the Call. An evil spirit overcomes them all. FALSE HAPPINESS. That never can be called true happiness Which fools admire and wicked men possess. RESIGNATION. Behold the secret of the Grace Divine Involv'd in that mysterious word “Resign!” In the full meaning of this single sound Are all Religious duties to be found: The several virtues which adorn the soul Unite to form the one substantial whole. GOD'S LOVE TO MAN. What is more tender than a Mother's Love To the sweet Infant fondling in her Arms? What Arguments need her Compassion move To hear its Cries, and help it in its Harms? Now, if the tend'rest Mother were possest Of all the Love within her single Breast Of all the Mothers since the World began,— 'Tis nothing to the Love of God to Man! THE ETERNAL PROMISE OF GOD. Wholly and solely to rejoice in this: That God for ever will be what He is! AN HYMN TO JESUS, From the French. I Come, Saviour Jesus, from above, Assist me with Thy Heav'nly Grace; Withdraw my Heart from worldly Love, And for Thyself prepare the Place! II Lord, let Thy Sacred Presence fill And set my longing Spirit free, That pants to have no other Will, But Night and Day to think on Thee! III Where'er Thou leadest, I'll pursue Thro' all Retirements or Employs; But to the World I'll bid adieu And all its vain delusive Joys. IV That Way with humble Speed I'll walk Wherein my Saviour's Footsteps shine; Nor will I hear, nor will I talk Of any other Love but Thine. V To Thee my longing Soul aspires; To Thee I offer all my Vows: Keep me from false and vain Desires, My God, my Saviour, and my Spouse! VI Henceforth, let no profane Delight Divide this consecrated Soul! Possess it Thou Who hast the Right, As Lord and Master of the Whole! VII Wealth, Honours, Pleasures, or what else This short-enduring World can give, Tempt as they will, my Heart repells, To Thee alone resolv'd to live. VIII Thee one may love, and Thee alone, With inward Peace and Holy Bliss; And when Thou tak'st us for Thy Own, Oh, what a Happiness is this! IX Nor Heav'n nor Earth do I desire, Nor Mysteries to be reveal'd; 'Tis Love that sets my Heart on Fire; Speak Thou the Word, and I am heal'd! X All other Graces I resign, Pleas'd to receive, pleas'd to restore. Grace is Thy Gift; it shall be mine The Giver only to adore. A FAREWELL TO THE WORLD, From the French. I World, adieu, thou real Cheat! Oft have Thy deceitful Charms Fill'd my Heart with fond Conceit, Foolish Hopes and false Alarms. Now I feel as clear as Day, How thy Follies pass away. II Vain thy entertaining Sights, False thy Promises renew'd! All the Pomp of thy Delights Does but flatter and delude. Thee I quit for Heav'n Above, Object of the noblest Love. III Farewell, Honour's empty Pride! Thy own nice, uncertain Gust, If the least Mischance betide, Lays thee lower than the Dust; Worldly Honours end in Gall, Rise to Day, To-morrow fall. IV Foolish Vanity, farewell! More inconstant than the Wave; Where thy soothing Fancies dwell, Purest Tempers they deprave: He to Whom I fly from thee, Jesus Christ, shall set me free. V Never shall my wandering Mind Follow after fleeting Toys; Since in God alone I find Solid and substantial Joys,— Joys that, never overpast, Thro' Eternity shall last. VI Lord, how happy is a Heart, After Thee while it aspires! True and Faithful as Thou art, Thou shalt answer its Desires; It shall see the glorious Scene Of Thy Everlasting Reign. AN HYMN, From the French. I How charming to be thus confin'd Within This lovely Tow'r; Where with a calm and quiet Mind I pass the peaceful Hour! Stronger than Chains of any Kind Is Love's Enduring Pow'r. II These very Ills are my Delight; My Pleasures rise from Pains; The Punishments that most affright Become my wish'd-for Gains; Whatever Torments they excite, Pure-sighing Love remains. III Pain is no Object of my Fear, Tho' Help is not in View; Sure as I am, from Evils here That Blessings will ensue, To Sov'reign Beauty it is clear That Sov'reign Love is due. IV I suffer, but along with Smart Is Grace and Virtue sent; Presence of God, Who takes my Part, So sweetens all Event. He is the Patience of my Heart, The Comfort and Content. THE DESPONDING SOUL'S WISH. I My Spirit longeth for Thee Within my troubled Breast; Altho' I be unworthy Of so Divine a Guest. II Of so Divine a Guest Unworthy tho' I be, Yet has my Heart no Rest, Unless it come from Thee. III Unless it come from Thee, In vain I look around; In all that I can see, No Rest is to be found. IV No Rest is to be found, But in Thy Blessèd Love; O let my Wish be crown'd, And send It from Above! THE ANSWER. I Cheer up, desponding Soul! Thy Longing, pleas'd, I see; 'Tis Part of that Great Whole Wherewith I long'd for thee. II Wherewith I long'd for thee, And left My Father's Throne, From Death to set thee free, To claim thee for My Own. III To claim thee for My Own I suffer'd on the Cross. Oh! Were My Love but known, No Soul could fear Its Loss. IV No Soul could fear Its Loss; But, fill'd with Love Divine, Would die on its own Cross, And rise for ever Mine. AN HYMN TO JESUS, From the Latin of St. Bernard. I Jesu! The Soul that thinks on Thee, How happy does it seem to be! What Honey can such Sweets impart, As does Thy Presence to the Heart! II No Sound can dwell upon the Tongue, Nor Ears be ravish'd with a Song, Nor Thought by pondering be won, Like that of God's Belovèd Son. III Jesu! The Penitent's Retreat, The wearied Pilgrim's Mercy-Seat: If they that seek Thee are caress'd, How are the Finders of Thee blest! IV Jesu! the Source of Life and Light, That mak'st the Mind so blest and bright; Fulness of Joy Thou dost inspire Beyond the Stretch of all Desire. V This can no Tongue that ever spoke Nor Hand express by figur'd Stroke; It is Experience that must prove The Pow'r of Jesus and His Love. ARMELLE NICOLAS' ACCOUNT OF HERSELF. From the French. I “To the God of my Love, in the Morning,” said she, Like a Child to its Parent, when waking, I flee; With a Longing to serve Him and please Him, I rise, And before Him kneel down, as if seen by these Eyes; I resign up myself to His Absolute Will, Which I beg that in me He would always fulfil; That the Pray'rs of the Day, by whomever preferr'd, For the Good of each Soul may be also thus heard. II “If, oblig'd to attend on some household Affair, I have scarce so much Time as to say the Lord's Pray'r, This gives me no Trouble: my dutiful Part Is Obedience to Him Whom I have at my Heart As well at my Work as retiring to pray; And His Love does not suffer in mine a Decay: He has taught me Himself, that a Work which I do For His Sake is a Pray'r very real and true. III “I dress in His Presence, and learn to confess That His Provident Kindness supplies me with Dress. In the midst of all outward Employment I find A Conversing with Him of an intimate Kind. How sweet is the Labour! His Loving Regard So supporting one's Mind, that it thinks nothing hard; While the Limbs are at Work, in the seeking to please So Belov'd a Companion, the Mind is at Ease. IV “In His Presence I eat and I drink, and reflect How Food of His Gift is the growing Effect; How His Love to my Soul is so great and so good, Just as if it were fed by His own Flesh and Blood. What a Virtue this Feeder, His Meat, and His Drink Has to kindle one's Heart, I must leave you to think. He alone can express it; no Language of mine, Were my Life spent in speaking, could ever define. V “When, perhaps, by hard Usage or Weariness prest, I myself am too apt to be fretful at best, Love shows me forthwith how I ought to take Heed Not to nurse the least Anger by Word or by Deed; And He sets such a Watch at the Door of my Lips, That of hasty cross Words there is nothing that slips. Such irregular Passions as seek to surprise, Are crush'd and are conquer'd, as soon as they rise. VI “Or, if e'er I give Place to an Humour so bad, My Mind has no Rest till Forgiveness be had; I confess all my Faults, as if He had not known, And my Peace is renew'd by a Goodness His Own In a Manner so free as if, after my Sin, More strongly confirm'd than before it had been. By a Mercy so Tender my Heart is reclaim'd, And the more to love Him by its Failing inflam'd. VII “Sometimes I perceive that He hideth His Face, And I seem like a Person depriv'd of all Grace. Then I say: ‘'Tis no Matter; altho' Thou conceal Thyself as Thou pleasest, I'll keep to my Zeal; I'll love Thee, and serve Thee, however this Rod May be sent to chastise, for I know Thou art God.’ And with more Circumspection I stand upon Guard, Till of such a Great Blessing no longer debarr'd. VIII “But a Suff'ring so deep having taught me to try What I am in my Selfhood, I learn to rely More firmly on Him Who was pleas'd to endure The severest Extremes, to make way for our Cure. To conform to His Pattern, as Love shall see fit, My Faith in the Saviour resolves to submit; For no more than my Self (if the Word may go free) Can I live without Him, can He help loving me. IX “Well assur'd of His Goodness I pass the whole Day, And my Work, hard or easy, is felt as a Play; I am thankful in Feelings, but, Pleasure or Smart, It is rather Himself that I love in my Heart. When they urge me to Mirth, I think, ‘Oh! were it known How I meet the Best Company when I'm alone!’ To my dear Fellow-creatures what ties me each Hour Is the Love of my God, to the best of my Pow'r. X “At the Hour of the Night when I go to my Rest, I repose on His Love, like a Child at the Breast; And a sweet, peaceful Silence invites me to keep Contémplating Him, to my dropping asleep. Many Times a good Thought, by its gentle Delight, Has withheld me from Sleep a good Part of the Night, In adoring His Love That continues to share To a poor, wretched Creature so Special a Care. XI “This, after my Heart was converted at last, Is the Life I have led for these twenty Years past. My Love has not chang'd, and my innermost Peace, Tho' it ever seem'd full, has gone on to increase: 'Tis an Infinite Love that has fill'd me, and fed My still rising Hunger to eat of Its Bread,— So satisfied still, as if such an Excess Could have Nothing more added than what I possess.” REFLEXIONS ON THE FOREGOING ACCOUNT. How full a Proof of Heav'ns All-present Aid Was good Armelle, a simple Servant-maid! A poor French Girl, by Parentage and Birth Of low and mean Condition upon Earth; By Education ignorant indeed: She all her Life could neither write nor read. But she had that which all the Force of Art Could neither give nor take away,—an Heart, An honest, humble, well-disposèd Will, The true Capacity for higher Skill Than what the World with all its learnèd Din Could teach. She learn'd her Lesson from within,— Plain, single Lesson of essential Kind: The Love of God's Pure Presence in her Mind. Her artless, innocent, attentive Thought Was at the Source of all True Knowledge taught. There she could read the Characters imprest Upon the Mind of ev'ry human Breast,— The native Laws prescrib'd to ev'ry Soul, And Love, the One Fulfiller of the Whole. This Holy Love to know and practise well Became the sole Endeavour of Armelle. Of outward Things the Management and Rule She wisely took from this internal School. In ev'ry Work well done by such a Hand, The Work was servile, but the Thing was grand. There was a Dignity in all she did, Tho' from the World by meaner Labours hid,— If mean below, not so esteem'd above, Where all the Grand of Labour is the Love. In vain to boast Magnificence of Scene; It is all Meanness, if the Love be mean! TO HIS WIFE. I Partner of all my joys and cares, Whether in poverty or wealth, For thee I put up all my pray'rs, Well-heard if answer'd by thy health; II Long absence, cruel as it is, Content still longer to endure If aught conducive to thy bliss The tedious torment could procure! III Joyous or grievous my employ, Absence itself would give relief, Could I but give thee all the joy, And bear myself alone the grief. IV Lost in this place of grand resort, Though crowds succeeding crowds I see, Quite from the city to the Court 'Tis all a wilderness to me! V Amidst a world of gaudy scenes Around me glittering I move; I wander, heedless what it means, Bent on the thoughts of her I love. VI Still I usurp that Sacred Sound, Too often and too long profan'd;— When shall I tread the happy ground Where Love and Truth may be obtain'd? VII Let me and my belovèd spouse With mutual ardour strive to quit False, earthly, interested vows, And Heav'n into our hearts admit! VIII There let th' endearing hope take place, Though parted here, to meet above In a perpetual chaste embrace, United, Jesu, in Thy love! AN HYMN ON SIMPLICITY, From the German. I Jesu! Teach this Heart of mine True Simplicity to find,— Child-like, innocent, Divine, Free from Guile of ev'ry Kind; And since, when amongst us vouchsafing to live, So pure an Example it pleas'd Thee to give; O let me keep still the Bright Pattern in View, And be, after Thy Likeness, right simple and true! II When I read, or when I hear Truths that kindle good Desires; How to act, and how to bear What Heav'n-instructed Faith requires: Let no subtle Fancies e'er lead me astray, Or teach me to comment Thy Doctrines away; No Reas'nings of selfish Corruption within, Nor Sleights by which Satan deludes us to Sin. III Whilst I pray before Thy Face, Thou Who art my Highest Good, O confirm to me the Grace Purchas'd by Thy Precious Blood; That, with a true filial Affection of Heart, I may feel what a Real Redeemer Thou art; And, thro' Thy Atonement to Justice above, Be receiv'd as a Child by the Father of Love! IV Give me, with a Child-like Mind Simply to believe Thy Word, And to do whate'er I find Pleases best my Dearest Lord; Resolving to practice Thy gracious Commands; To resign myself wholly up into Thy Hands: That, regarding Thee simply in all my Employ, I may cry “Abba! Father!” with dutiful Joy! V Nor within me nor without Let Hypocrisy reside; But whate'er I go about, Mere Simplicity be Guide! Simplicity guide me in Word and in Will; Let me live,—let me die,—in Simplicity still; Of an Epitaph made me let this be the Whole: “Here lies a true Child, that was simple of Soul!” VI Jesu! Now I fix my Heart, Prince of Life and Source of Bliss, Never from Thee to depart, Till Thy Love shall grant me this! Then, then, shall my Heart all its Faculties raise, Both here and hereafter to sing to Thy Praise! Oh joyful! My Saviour says “So let it be!” Amen, to my Soul,—Hallelujah, to Thee! A SIMPLE CONFESSION. Dear Christian brother, I confess I am a wretched sinner; If you know more and I know less, Instruct a young beginner! AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO EARNEST AND IMPORTUNATE PRAYER. “And he spake a Parable unto them, to this End, that Men always ought to pray, and not to faint.”—St. Luke, xviii. 1. I A blessèd Truth for Parable to paint, That “Men should always pray, and never faint!” Just the Reverse of this would Satan say, That “Men should always faint, and never pray.” He wants to drive poor Sinners to Despair,— And Christ, to save them by prevailing Pray'r. II The Judge who fearèd neither God nor Man, Despis'd the Widow when she first began Her just Request; but she, continuing on The same Petition, wearied him anon; He could not bear to hear her praying still, And did her Justice, tho' against his Will. III Can Perseverance force a Man unjust To execute, however loth, his Trust? And will not God, Whose Fatherly Delight Is to save Souls, so precious in His Sight, Hear his own Offspring's persevering Call, And give the Blessing which He has for all? IV Yes, to be sure, He will; the lying “No” Is a downright Temptation of the Foe, Who first emboldens Sinners to presume, As if a righteous Judgment had no Room; And, having led them into grievous Faults, With the Despair of Mercy then assaults. V Dear Soul, if thou hast listen'd to the Lies Which, at the first, the Tempter would devise, Let him not cheat thee with a second Snare, And drag thee into Darkness by Despair; Pray against all his Wiles; for God will hear, And will avenge thee of him, never fear! VI He gives the Grace to sorrow for thy Sin, The Sign of kindling Penitence within. Let not the Smoke disturb thee; for, no doubt, The Light and Flame will follow, and break out; And Love arise to overcome Restraint: That Thou may'st “always pray, and never faint!” A SOLILOQUY, On reading the 5th and 8th Verses of the 37th Psalm. “Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: fret not thyself, else shalt thou be moved to do evil.”—Psalm xxxvii. 8 (Prayer-book Version.) I In Psalm, this Evening order'd to be read, “Fret not thyself,” the Royal Psalmist said. His Reason why, succeeding Words instil: “Or else,” says he, “'twill move thee to do ill.” Now, tho' I know that Fretting does no Good, Its evil Movement have I understood? II “Move to do Evil.”—Then, dear Soul of mine, Stir it not up, if that be its Design! Its being vain, is Cause enough to shun; But, if indulg'd, some Evil must be done, And thou, according to the holy King, Must be the Doer of this evil Thing. III Men use the ill;—that Fault is theirs alone; But if thou use thyself ill, that's thy own. Meekness and Patience is much better Treasure: Then, “leave off Wrath,” and “let go all Displeasure;” Tho' thou art ever so ill-treated, yet Remember David, and forbear to “fret!” “Commit thy way unto the Lord, and put thy trust in Him: and He shall bring it to pass.”—Ib., v. 5. “Commit thy Way unto the Lord;”—resign Thyself entirely to the Will Divine. All real Good, all Remedy for Ill Lies in conforming to His Blessèd Will. By all Advice that Holy Books record, Thou must “commit thy Way unto the Lord; V “And put thy Trust in Him;”—all other Trust, Plac'd out of Him, is foolish and unjust. His Loving-Kindness is the only Ground Where Solid Peace and Comfort can be found. What other Prospects either sink or swim, Do thou stand Firm, “and put thy Trust in Him; VI “And He will bring thy Way to pass.”—The whole Of all that thou can'st wish for to thy Soul, He wills to give it, and thy seeking Mind By Faith and Patience cannot fail to find. To Him, whatever good Desire it has, “Commit and trust, and He will bring to pass!” AN EPISTLE FROM THE AUTHOR TO HIS SISTER, With the foregoing Soliloquy included. I Dear Sister, If Soliloquy conduce (Meant, as the Name declares, for private Use) To your Contentment,—if such Kind of Fruit Pleases your Taste, you're very welcome to't; Tho' pluck'd one Day in April from the Ground, It keeps in Pickle all the Seasons round. II 'Tis Summer now, and Autumn comes anon; Winter succeeds, and Spring when that is gone. But be it Winter, Summer, Autumn, Spring, To nurture Fretting is a simple Thing; A Weed so useless to the Use of Reason Can absolutely never be in Season. III Without much Nursing that the Weed will grow, I wish I had some Reason less to know; Some less to see, how Folly, when it grew In my own Ground, could cultivate it too,— Could hedge it round, and cherish, and suppose That, being mine, the Thistle was a Rose! IV You know the Saying, of I know not whom, “Little Misfortunes serve till greater come;” And Saying, somewhere met with, I recall, That “'tis the greatest to have none at all.” Rare Case, perhaps; they reach, we often see, All Sorts of Persons,—Him, Her, You, or Me. V “This being, then,” Experience says, “the Case, What Kind of Conduct must a Man embrace?” My 'Pothecary, as you think, replies: “Pray take 'em quietly, if you be wise! Bitter they are, 'tis true, to Flesh and Blood; But if they were not, they would do no Good.” VI One Time, when 'Pothecary Patience found That his Persuasion got but little Ground, He call'd in Doctor Gratitude, to try If his Advice could make me to comply. “I recommended Patience, Sir,” said he; “Pray will you speak, for he regards not me.” VII “Patience! a Custard-Lid!” said Dr. Grat.; “His Case wants, plainly, something more than that. 'Tis a good Recipe; but Cure is longer Than it should be. We must have something stronger. A creeping Pulse!—Bare Patience will not do; To get him Strength, he must be thankful too. VIII “He must consider,”—and so on he went To show Thanksgiving's marvellous Extent, And what a true Catholicon it was; And what great Cures it had but brought to pass; And how best Fortunes, wanting it, were curst; And how it turn'd to good the very worst. IX Oh! What a deal he said!—And, in the Light Wherein he plac'd it, all was really right; But like good Doctrine of some good Divine, Which, while 'tis preach'd, is admirably fine, When Doctor Gratitude had left the Spot, All that he said was “charming,”—and forgot. X Your Doctor's Potion,—Patience and the Bark,— May hit both mental and material Mark. One serves to keep the Ague from the Mind, As t'other does from its corporeal Rind. There is, methinks, in their respective Growth, A fair Analogy betwixt 'em both. XI For what the Bark is to the growing Tree, To human Mind that Patience seems to be: They hold the Principles of Growth together, And blunt the Force of Accident and Weather; Bar'd of its Bark, a Tree, we may compute, Will not remain much longer on its Root. XII And Mind in Mortals that are wisely-will'd, Will hardly bear to have its Patience peel'd. Nothing, in fine, contributes more to Living, Physic or Food, than Patience and Thanksgiving. Patience defends us from all outward Hap; Of inward Life Thanksgiving is the Sap. PASCAL'S CHARACTER OF HIMSELF. I I love and honour a poor humble State, Because my Saviour Jesus Christ was poor, And Riches, too, that help us to abate The Miseries which other Men endure. II I render back no Injuries again, Because I wish the Doer's Case like mine, In which nor Good nor Evil, as from Men, Is minded much, but from an Hand Divine. III I aim sincerely to be just and true, For my Good-will to all Mankind extends; A Tenderness of Heart, I think, is due Where stricter Ties unite me to my Friends. IV Whether in Conversation or alone, Still to my Mind God's Presence I recall; My Actions wait the Judgment of His Throne, And 'tis to Him I consecrate them all. V These are my Thoughts, and briefly thus display'd; I thank my Saviour for them ev'ry Day, Who of a poor, weak, sinful Man has made A Man exempt from Vice's evil Sway. VI Such is the Force of His Inspiring Grace, For all my Good to That alone I owe; Since, if my own corrupted Self I trace, I'm Nothing else but Misery and Woe. ST. CECILIA'S HYMN. I O born of a Virgin most lowly and meek, Thou, sent of Thy Father lost Creatures to seek, Vouchsafe, in the Manner that pleaseth Thee best, To kindle Thy Love in my virginal Breast; Let the Words of my Mouth and the Thoughts of my Heart Obey the sweet Force which Thy Grace shall impart; Whilst Angels assist me to offer my Vows To the God of my Life, my Redeemer and Spouse! II My Life I esteem, O Creator Divine, As a Loving Impression out-flowing from Thine,— As an act of Thy Bounty that gives us a Part Of the Light, Love and Glory Which Thou Thyself art. May I always as little Thy Pleasure oppose, As the pure simple Nature from whence I arose; And by Thee and for Thee created, fulfil In Thought, Word and Deed Thy adorable Will! III By this Blessèd Will, howsoever made known, With a dutiful Joy will I govern my own; And, deaf to all tempting Enchantments of Sin, I will hearken to Thee, my Redeemer within. Thy Words will I ponder by Night and by Day, And the Light of Thy Gospel shall mark out my Way; Till at length I arrive at the Honour I claim, To live like a Virgin baptis'd in Thy Name. A LETTER TO A LADY, OCCASIONED BY HER DESIRING THE AUTHOR TO REVISE AND POLISH THE POEMS OF BISHOP KEN. I Your Book again, with Thanks!—Of worthy Men One of the worthiest was Bishop Ken. Without Offence to Authors,—far above Ten Men of Learning is one Man of Love. How many Bishops and Divines renown'd, Time after Time, the Catechism expound,— And which of all so help it to impart Th' essential Doctrine, Purity of Heart? II His Choice of Poetry, when civil Rage O'erturn'd a Throne the last revolving Age; When Churches felt, as well as States, the Shock That drove the pious Pastor from his Flock,— His Choice of Subjects, not of Party-kind, But simply fit for ev'ry Christian Mind,— Are Proofs of gen'rous Virtue and sublime, And high Encomiums on the Force of Rime. III His Rimes,—if those of Dryden or of Pope Excel on Subjects of a diff'rent Scope, It is because they only chose the Mould Where Ore shone brightest, whether Lead or Gold. He, less concern'd for superficial Glare, Made Weight and Worth his more especial Care; They took the Tinsel of the fabl'd Nine, He the substantial Metal from the Mine. IV His Phrase (sometimes same sentence may be pass'd On theirs) might have more artificial Cast; But, in the main, his Pieces, as they stand, Could scarce be alter'd by a second Hand. Patchwork Improvements, in the modern Style, Bestow'd upon some venerable Pile, Do but deface it. Poems to revise That Ken has writ, another Ken must rise. V The Dedication, where the Case is shown Of a Greek Saint of old, so like his own,— The Preface, Introduction, and the View To Jesus,—Point which all his Works pursue,— Arise to Mind, and tempt to try the Case Of representing the imperfect Trace; To make, as Memory can best recall Its leading Thoughts, one Preface out of all. VI Imagine, then, the good old Man reclin'd On Couch or Chair, and musing in his Mind, How to adjust the Prefatory Hint To all the Lines that he gave Leave to print; Thinking on Gregory, whose former Fate Bore such Resemblance to his own of late; Thinking on Jesus and, oppress'd with Pain, Inditing thus th' apologising Strain: VII “In all my Pains I court the Sacred Muse; Verse is the only Laudanum I use,— Verse, and the Name of Jesus in the Line, The Christian's universal Anodyne. To hymn His saving Love to all Mankind Softens my Grief, and recreates my Mind. Thy Glory, Jesu, while my Songs intend, May Thy good Spirit bless them to that End! VIII “Like destin'd Jonah, cast into the Deep To save the Vessel from the stormy Sweep, And wafted providentially to Shore, I risk the boist'rous Element no more. But whilst alone I tread the distant Strand, Safe o'er the Waves that all may come to Land Whom once I call'd Companions on the Sea, I pray to Jesus, Whom the Winds obey. IX “Thus Nazianzen Gregory of old, Whom Faction drove from his belovèd Fold, Could will a Jonah's Lot,—to be cast o'er, If his dismission might the Calm restore. However short of this illustrious Saint, Yet I can find, from Virtues that I want, A Cause to pray that reigning Feuds may cease, To hope in Jesus for a calming Peace. X “The Saint, expell'd by a tumultuous Rage, Cheer'd with Diviner Songs his drooping Age; With Will resign'd in his retir'd Abode On Christian Themes compos'd the various Ode. Thus, to my Closet prompted to retire, Nothing on this Side Heav'n do I require, Employ'd in Hymns, tho' with unequal Skill, To consecrate to Jesus all my Will. XI “With Pain and Sickness when the Saint was griev'd, His anxious Mind a Sacred Song reliev'd; Oft, when oppress'd, the Subject which he sang, Mix'd with Devotion, sweeten'd ev'ry Pang. So, being banish'd by unruly Heat, With Hymns I seek to solace my Retreat. Be my Confinement ever so extreme, The Love of Jesus is a Special Theme. XII “When the Apostate Julian decreed That Pagan Poets Christians should not read, The Saint, who knew the subtle Edict's Cause, Made Verse to triumph o'er the Tyrant's Laws. May I, while Poetry is unrestrain'd, Tho' more in these than pagan Times profan'd, Show that what real Charms it has belong To Jesus, Founder of the Christian Song! XIII “When Gregory was forc'd to leave his Flock, He chose in Verse the Gospel to unlock, That flowing Numbers might th' Attention gain, So long forbidden to his preaching Strain. My Care for them whom I was forc'd to leave, Taught and untaught what Doctrine to receive, Would hint in Rimes to all whom they shall reach, What Jesus only in themselves can teach. XIV “For sake of Peace did Gregory withdraw, And wish'd more Leaders to observe that Law By which Resigners of Dominion here Purchase much greater in the Heav'nly Sphere. In Hopes of Peace, more joyfully I shook Preferment off than e'er I undertook; For all the Flock, and banish'd Head beside, My Comfort is that Jesus can provide. XV “When worldly Politics and Lust of Rule Prevail'd against him in a Christian School, The Saint retir'd, and labour'd to disperse Ungrateful Discord by harmonious Verse. Sharing his Fate, I share in his Desire Of Discord drown'd and of an hymning Lyre, To tune the Hopes of Peace and in the Name Of Jesus, rightly hop'd for, to proclaim. XVI “This Prince of Peace, This Origin Divine, Vouchsafe to aid the well-intended Line,— To teach the Reader's Heart and by His Grace Make these poor Labours useful in their Place! O might they raise in any single Soul One Spark of Love, one Glimpse of the great Whole, That will possess it when by Thee possest, Jesus, th' Eternal Song of all the blest!” A HINT TO CHRISTIAN POETS. I Where now the Jove, the Phœbus, and the Nine, Invok'd in Aid of Greek, and Roman Line; The Verse-inspiring Oracle and Stream, Delphos and Helicon, and every Theme Of charming Fictions, which the Poets sung, To shew the Beauties of a reigning Tongue? II The Wars of Gods and Goddesses and Men Employ'd an Homer's and a Virgil's Pen; An Epicurus taught that with this Ball The Gods at Ease had no Concern at all; And a Lucretius follow'd, to rehearse His Greek Impieties in Latin Verse. III Such were the Bibles of the Pagan Age, Sung at the Feast and acted on the Stage,— Transform'd to pompous or to luscious Ode, As Bacchus, Mars, or Venus was the Mode,— Dumb Deities, at Wit's profuse Expense Worshipp'd with Sounds that echoed to no Sense. IV The Christian Bard has, from a real Spring Of Inspiration, other Themes to sing: No vain Philosophy, no fabled Rime, But Sacred Story, simple and sublime, By holy Prophets told, to whom belong The Subjects worthy of the Pow'rs of Song. V Shun then, ye born with Talents that may grace The most important Truths, their hapless Case! From ranting, high, theatrical Bombast To low Sing-song of meretricious Cast, Shun ev'ry Step by which a Pagan Muse Could lead her Clients to the Stage or Stews! VI Let no Examples tempt you to profane The Gift, abhorrent of all hurtful Strain; Contemn the vicious, tho' prevailing, Fame That gains by prostituting Verse a Name; Take the forbearing Hint, and all the rest Will rise spontaneous in your purer Breast! ON THE DISPOSITION OF MIND REQUISITE FOR THE RIGHT USE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES. I To hear the Words of Scripture or to read With good Effect, requires a threefold Heed; If incomplete, it only can produce Hearings and Readings of no sort of Use. II The first, Intention;—or, a fix'd Design To learn the Truth concerning Things Divine. If previous Disposition be not good, How shall a serious Point be understood? III The next, Attention;—not the outward Part, But the fair List'ning of an honest Heart. Sound may, and Figure, strike the Ear and Eye, But Sense and Meaning to the Mind apply. IV The last, Retention;—or, the keeping pure From hurtful Mixtures what is clear and sure. In vain the Purpose and the Pains have been To gain a Good, if not secur'd within. V Without Intention, Truth no more can stay Than Seed can grow upon a public Way; The more it is affecting, plain and grand, The less will heedless Persons understand. VI Without Attention, 'twill have no more Fruit Than Seed on stony Ground, for want of Root, That makes a Show with hasty Shoots awhile, And then betrays the Barrenness of Soil. VII Without Retention, all is lost at last, Like Seed among the Thorns and Briars cast. So worldly Cares and worldly Riches both May mix with Truth, and choke it in its Growth. VIII As Ground produces goodly Crops of Corn, If good and free from Footstep, Stone or Thorn, That of good Hearts has Properties as plain To seek the Truth, receive it and retain. ON THE SAME SUBJECT, In a Letter to Mr. Ponthieu. We ought to read, my worthy Friend Ponthieu, All holy Scriptures with a Scripture-View. Writ for our Learning, as their Aim and Scope Is Patience, Comfort and the blessèd Hope Of everlasting Life, a Reader's Aim, To understand them right, should be the same. The Prosecution of this happier Quest If Doubts and Difficulties shall molest, And huge Debates on Passages obscure Be suffer'd to eclipse the plain and sure: The more he reads, the more this rambling Art Will fill his Head, but never touch his Heart; With controversial Circumstances fill, On which the Learnèd have employ'd their Skill With such Success, that scarce the plainest Text Can be produc'd, but what they have perplext In such a Manner that, while all assign To Scripture-Page Authority Divine, The Compliment is rather paid for Sake Of such Constructions as they please to make. Down from the Pope to the obscurest Sect, Too many Proofs are seen of this Effect,— Of making one same Scripture a Retreat For ev'ry Party's opposite Conceit. Profaner Wits, observing this, mistook, And laid the Fault upon the Bible-Book,— Taking the same Variety of Ways, By fancied Meanings for its ancient Phrase, To cry it down, as Sects were wont to use To cry it up for their peculiar Views. As this Excess from Age to Age has grown To such a monstrous Height within our own, What a sincere, impartial, honest Mind In Search of Truth does it require to find! What calm Attention, what unfeign'd Desire To hear its Voice does Truth itself require! In Scripture Phrase, what an “unceasing Pray'r” Should for its sacred Influence prepare! Because, whatever Comments we recall, The Disposition of the Mind is all. 'Tis in this Point, undoubtedly the main, That Sacred Books do differ from profane. They do not ask so much for letter'd Skill To understand them, as for simple Will. For as a single or clear-sighted Eye Admits the Light like an unclouded Sky, So is the Truth, by Scripture-Phrase design'd, Received into a well-disposèd Mind By the same Spirit, ready to admit The written Word, as they possess'd who writ,— Who writ, if Christians do not vainly boast, By Inspiration of the Holy Ghost. In Books so writ this great Advantage lies, That the First Author of them never dies, But is still present to instruct, and show To them who seek Him what they need to know,— Still by His chosen Servants to unfold, As He sees fit, the Mysteries of old; To re-confirm what any Sacred Pen Has writ, by Proof within the Hearts of Men. This is the true and solid Reason why No Difficulties, now objected, lie Against the Volumes writ so long ago, And in a Language that few People know,— Subject as Books to Errors and Mistakes Which oft transcribing or translating makes; While Manners, Customs, Usages or Phrase, Well-known of old, but not so in our Days, For many obvious Reasons must elude The utmost Force of criticising Feud. Still, all Editions verbally contain The simple necessary Truths and plain Of Gospel-Doctrine; and the Spirit's Aid, Which is the chief, is not at all decay'd. Nor can it hurt a Reader to suspend His Judgment, where he does not comprehend A darker Text; however it appear, He knows it cannot contradict a clear. So that with all the Helps of ev'ry Kind The shortest and the surest is to mind, When read or heard, and inwardly digest The plainest Texts as Rules to all the rest; To pray for that Good Spirit, which Alone Can make Its former Inspirations known,— The Promis'd Comforter, th' Unerring Guide, Who by Christ's Word was always to abide Within His Church, not only in the past, But in all Ages, while the World should last,— A Church distinguish'd in the Sacred Code By His Perpetual Guidance and Abode. Such is the Teacher Whom our Saviour chose, And writ no Books, as human Learning knows,— Loth as it is, of later Years, to preach That by This Teacher He will always teach; Bless all the Means of Learning, or the Want, To them who after His Instructions pant. Of reading Helps, what holy Men express'd, When mov'd to write, are certainly the best; But for the real, understanding Part The Book of Books is ev'ry Man's own Heart. ON THE CONVERSION OF ST. PAUL. I In Paul's Conversion we discern the Case Of human Talents wanting Heav'nly Grace. What Persecutions, till he saw the Light, Against the Christian Church did he excite! By his own Reason led into Mistake, Amongst the Flock what Havoc did he make; Within himself when verily he thought, That all the while he did but what he ought! II His Use of Reason cannot be denied, Nor legal Zeal, nor moral Life beside,— Blameless as any Jew or Greek could claim Who show'd Aversion to the Christian Name. His Fund of Learning some are pleas'd to add; And yet, with all th' Endowments which he had, From Place to Place with eager Steps he trod, To persecute the real Church of God. III When to Damascus for the like Intent With the High Priest's Authority he went, Struck to the Ground by a Diviner Ray The “reas'ning, legal, moral Zealot” lay; To the plain Question put by Jesus, “Why Persecute Me?” had only to reply, “What shall I do?”—His Reason and his Wrath Were both convinc'd, and he embrac'd the Faith. IV His outward lost, his inward Sight renew'd, Truth in its native Evidence he view'd. With three Days Fast he nourish'd his Concern; And, a new Conduct well prepar'd to learn, Good Ananias, whom he came to bind, Was sent to cure and to baptise the Blind. A destin'd Martyr to his Jewish Zeal Of Christian Faith confers the sacred Seal. V Of nobler Use his Reason, while it stood Without a Conference with Flesh and Blood, Still and submissive; when within begun The Father's Revelation of the Son; Whom, till the Holy Spirit rise to show, No Pow'r of Thought can ever come to know. The Saving Mystery, obscur'd by Sin, Itself must manifest Itself within. VI Thus, taught of God, Paul saw the Truth appear To his enlighten'd Understanding clear. The Pow'r of Christ Himself, and nothing less Could move Its Persecutor to profess; He learn'd and told It from the Real Ground, And prov'd to all the Christian World around, That true Religion had its true Foundation Not in Man's Reason, but God's Revelation. AN EPISTLE TO A GENTLEMAN OF THE TEMPLE, Occasioned by two Treatises, wherein the Fall of Man is differently Represented; viz. (1) Mr. Law's Spirit of Prayer; (2) The Bishop of London's Appendix: showing that, according to the plainest Sense of Scripture, the Nature of the Fall is greatly mistaken in the latter. Sir, upon casting an attentive Look Over your Friend the learned Sherlock's Book, One Thing occurs about the Fall of Man, That does not suit with the Mosaic Plan, Nor give us fairly, in its full Extent, The Scripture Doctrine of that dire Event. When tempted Adam, yielding to Deceit, Presum'd of the forbidden Tree to eat, The Bishop tells us, that “he did not die.” Pray, will you ask him, Sir, the Reason why? Why he would contradict the sacred Text, Where Death to Sin so surely is annext? “The Day thou eatest,” are the Words, you know; And yet, by his Account, it was not so; Death did not follow, tho' it surely would.— How will he make this hardy Comment good? “Sentence,” says he, “was respited.” But, pray, Where does the Scripture such a Saying say? What Word that means to “respite” or “revoke” Appears in all that God or Moses spoke? It will be said, perhaps, that it appears, That Adam liv'd above Nine-hundred Years After his Fall.—True; but what Life was that? The very Death, Sir, which his Fall begat. The Life that Adam was created in Was lost the Day, the Instant, of his Sin. Just as the rebel Angels, when they fell, Were dead to Heav'n, altho' alive to Hell: So Man, no longer breathing heav'nly Breath, Fell to this Life, and died the Scripture Death. While in the State of Innocence he stood, He was all living, beautiful, and good; But when he fed on the forbidden Fruit, Whereof Corruption was the latent Root, He died to Paradise and, by a Birth That should not have been rais'd, he liv'd to Earth; Fell into bestial Flesh and Blood and Bones Amongst the Thorns and Briars, Rocks and Stones. That which had cloth'd him, when a Child of Light, With all its Lustre was extinguish'd quite; Naked, asham'd, confounded and amaz'd, With other Eyes on other Scenes he gaz'd, All Sensibility of heav'nly Bliss Departing from him;—what a Death was This! His Soul, indeed, as an immortal Fire Could never die, could never not desire; But, Sir, he had what glorious Angels claim,— An Heav'nly Spirit, and an Heav'nly Frame; Form'd in the Likeness of the Sacred Three, He stood immortal, powerful, and free; Image of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, The destin'd Sire of a new Heav'nly Host; Partner of Their Communicated Breath, A living Soul, unsubjected to Death. Since, then, he fell from this sublime Estate, Could less than Death have been his real Fate? No; as in Life he chose not to abide, It must be said, that Adam surely died. Say that he died not, as it was foretold, But when Nine hundred Years and Thirty old,— And then, if Death be Sentence for a Fall, How proves the Bishop that he died at all? For if the Death he talks of be this last, How does that answer to the Sentence pass'd? Was his Departure from this World the Time That our First Father suffer'd for his Crime? One rather should believe, or hope at least, That (so be it!) his Sufferings then ceas'd; And that the Life, which had been lost at first, Was then regain'd and he no longer curst. If on the Bishop's Scutcheon, when he dies, (Long be the Time deferr'd!) the mourning Eyes Should read “Mors Vitæ Janua,” in Paint, What must they think him,—Sinner, then, or Saint? Must not these Words direct them to suppose An End of all a Christian Bishop's Woes, Who, like to Adam, Father of Mankind, Has pass'd his Time of Penitence enjoin'd; Who, like to Christ, the Second Adam too, Had always had Redemption in his View; Had taught himself and others to revive From “dead in Adam” to “in Christ alive;” Had been as true a Shepherd to his Flock, As the poor Hind that really wears a Frock; So trod this earthly Passage that, in Sum, “Death” was to him “the Gate of Life” become? Gate of what Life? Undoubtedly the same That Adam fell from, when he first became A Creature of this World; when first he fell,— Thanks to Divine Fore-goodness!—not to Hell, But to this Earth,—this State of Time and Place, Where, dead by Nature, Man revives by Grace; Where, tho' his outward System must decay, His inward ripens to eternal Day,— Puts off th' old Adam, and puts on the New,— And, having found the First sad Sentence true, Now finds the Truth of what the Second said: “The Woman's Seed shall bruise the Serpent's Head.” Again;—to urge the Instance that I gave, Attend we this good Bishop to his Grave! The Priest comes forth to meet the sable Hearse, And then repeats the well-appointed Verse, —Verse, one would think, that might decide the Strife— “I am the Resurrection and the Life.” What “Life” is That Which Jesus is, and gives, In and by Which the true Believer lives? That of this World? Then, were it most absurd To a dead Bishop to apply the Word! 'Tis that which human Nature had before; Which, being Christ's, Christ only can restore. What Meaning is there touching the Deceas'd, Now from the Burden of the Flesh releas'd, But that his Soul is going to be clad With heav'nly Flesh and Blood, which Adam had, Before he enter'd into that which Paul “Body of Death” might very justly call? A Flesh and Blood, that, as he hints elsewhere, “Not born from Heav'n can never enter there;”— Mass of this World, whose Kingdom Christ disclaim'd, The Life whereof is but a Life so-nam'd,— A Life of Animal and Insect Breath, That in a Man is rightly styl'd a Death. Thus, Sir, throughout the Burial Office run, You'll find that it proceeds as it begun. Read any Office,—Baptism, if you will,— From first to last, you'll find the Reason still Why any or why all of them are read,— Reason of all that's either sung, or said,— Is by this one great solemn Truth explain'd Of “Life in Adam lost, in Christ regain'd;”— Lost at the Fall,—not at the End of Years That Adam labour'd in this Vale of Tears, When Death thro' Christ was happy, 'tis presum'd, And vanquish'd that to which he first was doom'd;— Doom'd,—not by any Act of Wrath in God,— A Point wherein the Bishop seems to nod. No Death of pure, of tainted Life no Pain Did His Severe Inflicting Will ordain. He is all Glory, Goodness, Light, and Love,— Life that from Him no Creature can remove; But from itself it may, as Adam did, If it will choose what Light and Love forbid. Truly fore-warn'd of what would truly be, His Life was poison'd by the mortal Tree: He ate—he fell—he died:—'tis all the same,— One Loss of Life under a triple Name. No Test was made by positive Command, Merely to try if he would fall or stand, Like that, the serpentine Satanic Snare, Of which the Man was bidden to beware. “Eat not thereof, or thou wilt surely die,” Was spoken to prevent, and not to try; To guard the Man against his subtle Foe, Who sought to teach him what 'twas Death to know;— Death to his pristine Spirit-life Divine, And Separation from its Sacred Shrine,— The Pure, Unmix'd, Incorruptible Throne, Wherein God's Image first Embodied shone. Tho' form'd to rule the new-created Scene, Built from the Chaos of a former Reign, To bring the Wonders of this World to View, And ancient Glories to an Orb renew, He also had, as being to command, See and be seen in this new-formèd Land,— This intermediate temporary Life, Where only Good and Evil are at Strife,— Outward, corporeal Form, whereby he saw And heard and spoke and gave to all Things Law, They none to him. His far superior Mind Was, as he pleas'd, united or disjoin'd,— So far united that all Good was gain'd; So far disjoin'd that Evil was restrain'd. It could not reach him, for before his Fall Nothing could hurt this human Lord of All,— No more than Satan or the Serpent could, If in his First Creation he had stood. Such was his blest Estate, wherein is found Of Adam's happy Ignorance the Ground. His outward Body and each outward Thing, From whence alone both Good and Ill could spring, Could not affect, while he was free from Sin, The Life of the celestial Man within. Glorious Condition! Which, howe'er, implied, That Man, at first plac'd in it, must be tried Not from God's Will or arbitrary Voice;— His Trial follow'd from his Pow'r of Choice. God will'd him That, himself was to re-will, And the divine Intentions to fulfil,— To use his outward Body as a Means Whereby to raise in Time and Place the Scenes That should restore the once angelic Orb, And all its Evil introduc'd absorb;— Evil, that prior to the Fall of Man From him, whose Name in Heav'n is lost, began. Moses has plainly hinted at the Fiend, Whose Malice in a borrow'd Shape was screen'd; Who, under Reason's plausible Disguise, Taught our First Parents to be worldly-wise. Succeeding Lights have risen up to show Of God and Man more openly the Foe. He, once a thron'd Archangel, had the Sway Far as this Orb of our created Day; Where, then, no Sun was wanted to give Light, No Moon to cheer yet undiscover'd Night. Immensely luminous his total Sphere, All Glory, Beauty, Brightness, ev'rywhere,— Ocean of Bliss, a limpid crystal Sea, Whose Height and Depth its Angels might survey, Call forth its Wonders, and enjoy the Trance Of Joys perpetual thro' its whole Expanse. Ravishing Forms, arising without End, Would in Obedience to their Wills ascend, Change, and unfold fresh Glories to their View, And tune the Hallelujah Song anew. If, when we cast a thoughtful, thankful Eye Towards the Beauties of an Ev'ning Sky, Calm we admire thro' the ethereal Field The various Scenes that even Clouds can yield,— What huge Delight must Nature's Fund afford, Where all the rich Realities are stor'd Which God produces from its vast Abyss To His own Glory and His Creatures' Bliss! His Glory, first, all Nature must display; Else how to Bliss could Creatures know the Way? Order thro' all Eternity requires That to His Will they subject their Desires; That, with all Meekness, the created Mind Be to the Fountain of its Life resign'd; Think, speak, and act, in all things for His Sake. This is the true Perfection of its Make. Both Men and Angels must have Wills their own, Or God and Nature were to them unknown. 'Tis their Capacity of Life and Joy Which none but they can ruin or destroy. God in Himself was, is and will be Good, And all around pour forth th' enriching Flood. From Him—'tis Nature's and Religion's Creed,— Nothing but Good can possibly proceed. That Creature only, whose recipient Will Shuts itself up within itself, is ill: Good cannot dwell in such an harden'd Clay, But stagnates and evaporates away. Thus, when the Regent of th' angelic Host That fell, began within himself to boast; Began, endow'd with his Creator's Pow'rs That nothing could resist, to call them Ours; To spread thro' his wide Ranks the impious Term, And they, their Leader's Doctrine to confirm,— Then Self, then Evil, then apostate War Rag'd thro' their Hierarchy wide and far; Kindled to burn what they esteem'd a Rod, The Meekness and Subjection to a God. Resolv'd to pay no hymning Homage more, Nor in an Orbit of their own adore, All Right of Heav'n's Eternal King abjur'd, They thought One Region to themselves secur'd,— One out of Three, where Majesty Divine Shone in Its Glorious Outbirth Unitrine; Shone, and will shine eternally, altho' Angels or Men the Shining Bliss forego. Straight, with this proud Imagination fir'd, To Self-Dominion strongly they aspir'd; Bent all their Wills, irrevocably bent, To bring about their devilish Intent. How ought we Mortals to beware of Pride, That such great Angels could so far misguide! No sooner was this horrible Attempt From all Obedience to remain exempt Put forth to Act, but instantly thereon Heav'n in the Swiftness of a Thought was gone. From Love's beatifying Pow'r estrang'd, They found their Life, their Bliss, their Glory chang'd; That State wherein they were resolv'd to dwell, Sprung from their Lusting and became their Hell. Thinking to rise above the God of All The Wretches fell with an eternal Fall In Depths of Slavery without a Shelf;— There is no Stop in self-tormenting Self. Just as a Wheel, that's running down a Hill Which has no Bottom, must keep running still, So down their own Proclivity to wrong, Urg'd by impetuous Pride, they whirl along; Their own dark, fiery working Spirits tend Further from God and further to descend. He made no Hell to place His Angels in; They stirr'd the Fire that burnt them by their Sin, The Bounds of Nature and of Order broke, And all the Wrath that follow'd them awoke. Their own disorder'd Raging was their Pain; Their own unbending, harden'd Strength their Chain; Renouncing God with their eternal Might, They sunk their Legions into endless Night. Meanwhile, the glorious Kingdom where they dwelt Th' Effect of their rebellious Workings felt; Its clear Materiality and pure Could not the Force of raging Fiends endure; Its Elements, all Heav'nly in their Kind, In one harmonious System when combin'd, Were now disclos'd, divided and opaque; Their glassy Sea became a stormy Lake; The Height and Depth of their angelic World Was nought but Ruins upon Ruins hurl'd. Chaos arose, and with its gloomy Sweep Of dark'ning Horrors overspread the Deep; All was Confusion, Order all defac'd, Tohu and Bohu, the deformèd Waste. Till the Almighty's Gracious Fiat came And stopp'd the Spreading of the hellish Flame; Put to each fighting Principle the Bar, And calm'd by just Degrees th' intestine War. Light at His Word th' abating Tempest cheer'd; Earth, Sea and Land, Sun, Moon and Stars appear'd; Creatures of ev'ry Kind and Food for each, And various Beauties clos'd the various Breach. Nature's Six Properties had each their Day, Lost Heav'n, as far as might be, to display, And in the Sev'nth, or Body of them all, To rest from, what they yet must prove, a Fall. For had not this disorder'd Chaos been, Had not these Angels caus'd it by their Sin,— Nor had compacted Earth, nor Rock, nor Stone, Nor gross Materiality been known. All that in Fire or Water, Earth or Air, May now their noxious Qualities declare, Is as unknown in Heav'n as Sin or Crime, And only lasts for purifying Time,— Till the Great End, for which we all came here, Till God's Restoring Goodness, shall appear. Then, as the rebel Creatures' false Desire Awak'd in Nature the chaotic Fire, So, when Redeeming Love has found a Race Of Creatures worthy of the Heav'nly Place, Then shall another Fire enkindled rise, And purge from Ill these temporary Skies,— Purge from the World its Deadness and its Dross, And of lost Heav'n recover all the Loss. Why look we, then, with such a longing Eye On what this World can give us or deny,— Of Man and Angel fall'n the sad Remains? It has its Pleasures, but it has its Pains. It has what speaks it, would we but attend, Not our design'd Felicity,—an End. Sons of Eternity, tho' born on Earth, There is within us a Celestial Birth,— A Life that waits the Efforts of our Mind, To raise itself within this outward Rind. This Husk of ours, this stately stalking Clod, Is not the Body that we have from God. Of Good and Evil 'tis the mortal Crust; Fruit of Adamical and Eval Lust; By which the Man, when heav'nly Life was ceas'd, Became an helpless, naked, biped Beast, Forc'd on a cursèd Earth to sweat and toil, To Brute a native, him a foreign Soil; And, after all his Years employ'd to know The Satisfaction of a Life so low,— Nine-hundred, or Nine-hundred-thousand,—past, Another Death to come and Hell at last,— But for that new, mysterious Birth of Life, That promis'd Seed to Adam and his Wife, That quick'ning Spirit to a poor dead Soul,— Not Part of Scripture Doctrine, but the Whole; Which Writers, figuring away, have left A mere dead Letter, of all Sense bereft,— But for that only Help of Man forlorn, The Incarnation of the Virgin-born. This Serpent-Bruiser, Son of God and Man, Who from the first His saving Work began, Revers'd, in full Maturity of Time, In His Own sacred Person, Adam's Crime; Brought human Nature from its deadly Fall, And made Salvation possible for All. Without acknowledging that Adam died, Scripture throughout is, in Effect, denied; All the whole Process of Redeeming Love, Of Life, of Light and Spirit from above, Loses by Learning's piteous Pretence Of Modes and Metaphors its real Sense; All the glad Tidings in the Gospel found Are sunk in empty and unmeaning Sound. If by the First Man's Sin we understand Only some Breach of absolute Command Half-punish'd, half-remitted by a Grace Like that which takes in human Acts a Place,— The more we write, the more we still expose The Christian Doctrine to its reas'ning Foes. But, once convinc'd that Adam by his Crime Fell from eternal Life to that of Time; Stood on the Brink of Death eternal too, Unless created unto Life anew,— Then, ev'ry Reason teaches us to see How all the Truths of Sacred Writ agree; How Life restor'd arises from the Grave; How Man could perish, and how Christ could save. Man perish'd by the deadly Food he took, And needs must lose the Life that he forsook, Not unadvis'd. The Moment he inclin'd To this inferior Life his nobler Mind, God kindly warn'd him to continue fed With Food of Paradise, with Angels' Bread; To shun the Tree, the Knowledge, whose sad Leav'n Would quench in him the Light and Life of Heav'n; Strip him of that angelical Array Which thro' his outward Body spread the Day; Kept it from ev'ry Curse of Sin and Shame, From all those Evils that had yet no Name,— That prov'd—alas!—when he would not refrain, The Loss of Adam's proper Life too plain. Who can suppose that God would e'er forbid To eat what would not hurt him if he did; Fright His lov'd Creature by a false Alarm; Or make what in itself was harmless, Harm? O how much better he from whom I draw, Tho' deep, yet clear, the System,—Master Law! “Master” I call him; not that I incline To pin my Faith on any One Divine; But, Man or Woman, whosoe'er it be, That speaks true Doctrine, is a Pope to me. Where Truth alone is Interest and Aim, Who would regard a Person or a Name; Or, in the Search of it impartial, scoff Or scorn the meanest Instrument thereof? Pardon me, Sir, for having dar'd to dwell Upon a Truth already told so well; Since diff'rent Ways of telling may excite In diff'rent Minds Attention to what's right, And Men (I measure by Myself) sometimes, Averse to Reas'ning, may be taught by Rimes,— If, where One fails, they will not take Offence, Nor quarrel with the Words, but seek the Sense. “Life,” “Death,” and such-like Words, in Scripture found, Have certainly an higher, deeper Ground, Than that of this poor perishable Ball, Whereon Men doat as if it were their All,— As if they were like Warburtonion Jews, Or Christians nam'd, but still no higher Views; As if their Years had never taught them Sense Beyond, “It is all one a Hundred hence!” 'Twas of such Worldlings that our Saviour said To one of his Disciples, “Let the Dead Bury their Dead,—but do thou follow Me!” It makes no more Distinction, Sir, you see, But that with Ref'rence to a Life so brute The speaking Carcases interr'd the mute. Life, to conclude, was lost in Adam's Fall, Which Christ, our Resurrection, will recall; And, as Death came into the World by Sin, Where One begun the Other must begin. Why will the learned Sages use their Art, From Scripture Truth so widely to depart? But above all, a Bishop, grave and wise, Why will he shut against plain Text his Eyes,— Not see that Heav'ns Prediction never lied; That Adam fell by eating, sinn'd, and died A real Death, as much as Loss of Sight Is Death to ev'ry Circumstance of Light? Tho' a blind Man may feel his Way and grope, Or for recover'd Eyes be made to hope, We might as well set Glasses on his Nose, And Sight from common Helps of Sight suppose, As say, when Adam's Heav'nly Life was kill'd, That Sentence was not instantly fulfill'd! Persuade your Mitred Friend, then, if you can, To re-consider, Sir, the Fall of Man; To see and own the Depth of it: because. Till that is done, we may as well pick Straws, As talk of what and who the Serpent was That brought the Fall, not understood, to pass. One Thing he was, Sir, be what else he will,— A Critic that employ'd his fatal Skill To cavil upon Words, and take away The Sense of that which was as plain as Day. And thus the World at present by his Wiles, Tho' not in outward Shape, he still beguiles, Seeking to turn, by Comments low and lax, The Word of God into a Nose of Wax; To take away the Marrow and the Pith Of all that Scripture can present us with. May Heav'n deliver from his winding Tours The Bishop, and us all! I am, Sir, Yours. A PRAYER, FROM MR. LAW'S SPIRIT OF PRAYER. O heav'nly Father! Gracious God above! Thou Boundless Depth of Never-ceasing Love! Save me from Self, and cause me to depart From sinful Works of a long-harden'd Heart; From all my Great Corruptions set me free; Give me an Ear to hear, an Eye to see, An Heart and Spirit to believe, and find Thy Love in Christ, the Saviour of Mankind! Made for Thyself, O God, and to display Thy Goodness in me, manifest, I pray, By Grace adapted to each wanting Hour Thy Holy Nature's Life-conferring Pow'r; Give me the Faith, the Hunger and the Thirst After the Life breath'd forth from Thee at first,— Birth of Thy Holy Jesus in my Soul, That I may turn thro' Life's succeeding Whole From ev'ry outward Work or inward Thought Which is not Thee, or in Thy Spirit wrought! ENTHUSIASM; A Poetical Essay. In a Letter to a Friend in Town. ?? ??? ?? ????? ????? ????? ? ???? ???????, ?? ?? ???? ?? ????? ??? ???????????? ???? ??? ???????????, ? ???? ?? ???????? ?????? ??????. —S. Dionys. Areop. de Eccles. Hier., cap. 2. “Fly from Enthusiasm! It is the Pest, Bane, Poison, Frenzy, Fury,—and the rest.” This is the Cry that oft, when Truth appears, Forbids Attention to our list'ning Ears; Checks our first Entrance on the main Concern, And, stunn'd with Clamour, we forbear to learn; Mechanically catch the common Cant, And fly from what we almost know we want,— A deeper Sense of something that should set The Heart at Rest, that never has done yet; Some simpler Secret that, yet unreveal'd, Amidst contending Systems lies conceal'd. A Book, perhaps, beyond the vulgar Page, Removes at once the Lumber of an Age; Truth is presented; strikes upon our Eyes; We feel Conviction, and we fear Surprise; We gaze, admire, dispute, and then the Bawl: “Fly from Enthusiasm!” That answers all. Now, if my Friend has Patience to enquire, Let us a while from noisy Scenes retire; Let us examine Sense as well as Sound, And search the Truth, the Nature and the Ground. 'Tis Will, Imagination and Desire Of thinking Life that constitute the Fire,— The Force, by which the strong Volitions drive, And form the Scenes to which we are alive. What tho', unsprouted into outward Shape, The Points of Thought our grosser Sight escape, Nor bulky Forms in prominent Array Their secret cogitative Cause betray? Once fix the Will, and Nature must begin T' unfold its active Rudiments within; Mind governs Matter, and it must obey; To all its opening Forms Desire is Key; Nor Mind nor Matter's Properties are lost,— As that shall mould, this must appear emboss'd. Imagination, trifling as it seems, Big with Effects, its own Creation, teems. We think our Wishes and Desires a Play, And sport important Faculties away. Edg'd are the Tools with which we trifle thus, And carve our deep Realities for us. Intention, roving into Nature's Field, Dwells in that System which it means to build, Itself the Centre of its wish'd-for Plan; For where the Heart of Man is, there is Man. Ev'ry created, understanding Mind Moves as its own Self-bias is inclin'd. From God's free Spirit breathèd forth to be, It must of all Necessity be free; Must have the Pow'r to kindle and inflame The Subject-matter of its mental Aim. Whether it bend the voluntary View Realities, or Fictions, to pursue,— Whether it raise its Nature or degrade, To Truth substantial or to phantom Shade,— Falsehood or Truth accordingly obtains; That only which it wills to gain, it gains,— Good, if the Good be vigorously sought, And Ill, if that be first resolv'd in Thought. All is one Good, that nothing can remove, While held in Union, Harmony, and Love. But when a selfish, separating Pride Will break all Bounds, and Good from Good divide, 'Tis then extinguish'd, like a distant Spark, And Pride self-doom'd into its joyless Dark. The miscreant Desire turns Good to Ill In its own Origin, the evil Will;— A Fact, that fills all Histories of old, That glares in Proof, while conscious we behold The Bliss, bespoken by our Maker's Voice, Fixt or perverted by a Man's own Choice. Now, when the Mind determines thus its Force, The Man becomes Enthusiast of course. “What is Enthusiasm?” What can it be But Thought enkindled to an high Degree, That may, whatever be its ruling Turn,— Right or not right,—with equal Ardour burn? It must be therefore various in its Kind, As objects vary that engage the Mind. When to Religion we confine the Word, What Use of Language can be more absurd? 'Tis just as true, that many Words beside, As “Love” or “Zeal,” are only thus applied. To ev'ry Kind of Life they all belong; Men may be eager, tho' their Views be wrong. And hence the Reason why the greatest Foes To true religious Earnestness are those Who fire their Wits upon a diff'rent Theme, Deep in some false enthusiastic Scheme. One Man politely, seiz'd with classic Rage, Dotes on old Rome and its Augustan Age,— On those great Souls who then, or then-abouts, Made in their State such Riots and such Routs. He fancies all magnificent and grand Under this Mistress of the World's Command. Scarce can his Breast the sad Reverse abide: The Dame despoil'd of all her glorious Pride; Time, and old Goth, advancing to consume Immortal Gods and once eternal Rome; When the plain Gospel spread its artless Ray, And rude uncultur'd Fishermen had Sway, Who spar'd no Idol, tho' divinely carv'd, Tho' Art, and Muse, and Shrine-Engraver starv'd; Who sav'd poor Wretches, and destroy'd, alas! The vital Marble and the breathing Brass. Where does all Sense to him and Reason shine? Behold, in Tully's Rhetoric divine! “Tully?” Enough; high o'er the Alps he's gone, To tread the Ground that Tully trod upon; Haply, to find his Statue or his Bust, Or Medal green'd with Ciceronian Rust; Perchance, the Rostrum,—yea, the very Wood Whereon this elevated Genius stood, When forth on Catiline, as erst he spoke, The Thunder of “Quousque tandem” broke. Well may this Grand Enthusiast deride The Dulness of a Pilgrim's humbler Pride, Who paces to behold that Part of Earth Which to the Saviour of the World gave Birth; To see the Sepulchre from whence He rose, Or view the Rocks that rended at His Woes; Whom Pagan Reliques have no Force to charm, Yet ev'n a modern Crucifix can warm,— The Sacred Signal who intent upon, Thinks on the Sacrifice That hung thereon. Another's heated Brain is painted o'er With ancient Hieroglyphic Marks of yore; He old Egyptian Mummies can explain, And raise 'em up almost to Life again; Can into deep antique Recesses pry, And tell of all the Wherefore and the Why; How this Philosopher and that has thought, Believ'd one Thing, and quite another taught; Can Rules of Grecian Sages long forgot Clear up, as if they liv'd upon the Spot. What Bounds to Nostrum?—Moses and the Jews Observ'd this learnèd Legislator's Views, While Israel's Leader purposely conceal'd Truths, which his whole Economy reveal'd; No Heav'n disclos'd, but Canaan's fertile Stage, And no For-ever, but a good old Age; Whilst the well-untaught People, kept in Awe By meanless Types and unexplainèd Law, Pray'd to their local God to grant a while The Future State of Corn and Wine and Oil; Till, by a late Captivity set free, Their destin'd Error they began to see, Dropt the Mosaic Scheme, to teach their Youth Dramatic Job and Babylonish Truth. To soar aloft on Obeliskal Clouds; To dig down deep into the Dark—for Shrouds; To vex old Matters chronicled in Greek, While those of his own Parish are to seek,— What can come forth from such an antic Taste, But a Clarissimus Enthusiast, Fraught with Discoveries, so quaint, so new, So deep, so smart, so Ipse-dixit true? See Arts and Empires, Ages, Books and Men, Rising and falling, as he points the Pen; See Frauds and Forgeries, if aught surpass Of nobler Stretch the Limits of his Class, Nor found within that Summary of Laws,— Conjecture, tinsell'd with its own Applause! Where Erudition so unblest prevails, Saints and their Lives are legendary Tales; Christians a brainsick, visionary Crew, That read the Bible with a Bible-View, And thro' the Letter humbly hope to trace The living Word, the Spirit, and the Grace. It matters not, whatever be the State That full-bent Will and strong Desires create. Where'er they fall, where'er they love to dwell, They kindle there their Heaven or their Hell. The chosen Scene surrounds them as their own; All else is dead, insipid or unknown. However poor and empty be the Sphere, 'Tis All, if Inclination centre there. Its own Enthusiasts each System knows, Down to lac'd Fops and Powder-sprinkled Beaux. Great Wits, affecting what they call “to think,” That deep-immers'd in Speculation sink, Are great Enthusiasts, howe'er refin'd, Whose Brain-bred Notions so inflame the Mind That during the Continuance of its Heat The Summum Bonum is its own Conceit. Critics, with all their Learning recondite; Poets, that sev'rally be-musèd write; The Virtuosos, whether great or small; The Connoisseurs, that know the Worth of all; Philosophers, that dictate Sentiments, And Politicians wiser than Events,— Such, and such-like, come under the same Law, Altho' their Heat be from a Flame of Straw,— Altho' in one Absurdity they chime: To make religious Entheasm a Crime. Endless to say how many of their Trade Ambition, Pride and Self-conceit have made. If one the chief of such a num'rous Name, Let the great Scholar justify his Claim! Self-love, in short, wherever it is found, Tends to its own enthusiastic Ground. With the same Force that Goodness mounts above, Sinks, by its own enormous Weight, Self-love. By this the wav'ring Libertine is prest, And the rank Atheist totally possest. Atheists are dark Enthusiasts indeed, Whose Fire enkindles like the smoking Weed; Lightless and dull the clouded Fancy burns, Wild Hopes and Fears still flashing out by Turns. Averse to Heav'n, amid the horrid Gleam They quest Annihilation's monst'rous Theme, On gloomy Depths of Nothingness to pore, Till All be none, and Being be no more. The sprightlier Infidel, as yet more gay, Fires off the next Idéas in his Way,— The dry Fag-ends of ev'ry obvious Doubt, And puffs and blows for fear they should go out. Boldly resolv'd, against Conviction steel'd Nor inward Truth nor outward Fact to yield,— Urg'd with a thousand Proofs, he stands unmov'd, Fast by himself, and scorns to be out-prov'd. To his own Reason loudly he appeals,— No Saint more zealous for what God reveals! Think not that you are no Enthusiast, then! All Men are such, as sure as they are Men. The Thing itself is not at all to blame; 'Tis in each State of human Life the same, The fiery Bent, the driving of the Will, That gives the Prevalence to Good or Ill. You need not go to Cloisters or to Cells, Monks or Field-Preachers, to see where it dwells. It dwells alike in Balls and Masquerades; Courts, Camps, and 'Changes it alike pervades. There be Enthusiasts who love to sit In Coffee-houses, and cant out their Wit. The first in most Assemblies would you see, Mark out the first Haranguer, and that's He! Nay, 'tis what silent Meetings cannot hide; It may be notic'd by its mere Outside. Beaux and Coquettes would quit the magic Dress, Did not this mutual Instinct both possess. The Mercer, Tailor, Bookseller, grows rich, Because fine Clothes, fine Writings can bewitch. A Cicero, a Shaftesbury, a Bayle,— How quick would they diminish in their Sale! Four-Fifths of all their Beauties who would heed, Had they not keen Enthusiasts to read? That which concerns us, therefore, is to see What Species of Enthusiasts we be; On what Materials the fiery Source Of thinking Life shall execute its Force: Whether a Man shall stir up Love or Hate From the mix'd Medium of this present State; Shall choose with upright Heart and Mind to rise, And reconnoitre Heav'n's primeval Skies, Or down to Lust and Rapine to descend, Brute for a Time and Demon at its End. “Neither, perhaps,” the wary Sceptics cry,— And wait till Nature's River shall run dry; With sage Reserve not passing o'er to Good, Of Time, lost Time, are borne along the Flood,— Content to think such thoughtless Thinking right, And common Sense enthusiastic Flight. “Fly from Enthusiasm?” Yes, fly from Air, And breathe it more intensely for your Care! Learn that, whatever Phantoms you embrace, Your own essential Property takes Place; Bend all your Wits against it,—'tis in vain: It must exist, or sacred or profane. For Flesh or Spirit, Wisdom from above Or from this World an Anger or a Love, Must have its Fire within the human Soul. 'Tis ours to spread the Circle or control,— In Clouds of sensual Appetites to smoke, While smoth'ring Lusts the rising Conscience choke; Or from ideal Glimmerings to raise, Showy and faint, a superficial Blaze, Where subtle Reasons with their lambent Flames, Untouch'd the Things, creep round and round the Names;— Or, with a true celestial Ardour fir'd, Such as at first created Man inspir'd, To will, and to persist to will, the Light, The Love, the Joy, that makes an Angel bright,— That makes a Man in Sight of God to shine With all the Lustre of a Life Divine. When true Religion kindles up the Fire, Who can condemn the vigorous Desire That burns to reach the End for which 'twas giv'n,— To shine and sparkle in its native Heav'n? What else was our Creating Father's View; His Image lost why sought He to renew? Why all the Scenes of Love that Christians know, But to attract us from this poor Below,— To save us from the fatal Choice of Ill And bless the free co-operating Will? Blame not Enthusiasm, if rightly bent,— Or blame of Saints the holiest Intent, The strong Persuasion, the confirm'd Belief, Of all the Comforts of a Soul the Chief, That God's Continual Will and Work to save, Teach and inspire, attend us to the Grave; That they who in His Faith and Love abide, Find in His Spirit an Immediate Guide. This is no more a Fancy or a Whim, Than that “we live, and move, and are in Him.” Let Nature, or let Scripture, be the Ground,— Here is the Seat of true Religion found. An Earthly Life, as Life itself explains, The Air and Spirit of this World maintains; As plainly does an Heav'nly Life declare An Heav'nly Spirit and an Holy Air. What Truth more plainly does the Gospel teach, What Doctrine all its Missionaries preach, Than this: that ev'ry good Desire and Thought Is in us by the Holy Spirit wrought? For this, the working Faith prepares the Mind, Hope is expectant, Charity resign'd; From this Blest Guide the Moment we depart, What is there left to sanctify the Heart? “Reason and Morals?”—And where live they most? In Christian Comfort, or in Stoic Boast? Reason may paint unpractis'd Truth exact, And Morals rigidly maintain—no Fact; This is the Pow'r that raises them to Worth, That calls their rip'ning Excellences forth. “Not ask for this?”—May Heav'n forbid the vain, The sad Repose! What Virtue can remain? What Virtue wanting, if within the Breast This Faith, productive of all Virtue, rest: That God is always present to impart His Light and Spirit to the willing Heart? He who can say, “My willing Heart began To learn this Lesson,” may be christen'd Man;— Before a Son of Elements and Earth, But now a Creature of another Birth, Whose true regenerated Soul revives, And Life from Him That ever lives derives. Freed by compendious Faith from all the Pangs Of long-fetch'd Motives and perplex'd Harangues, One Word of Promise stedfastly embrac'd, His Heart is fix'd, its whole Dependence plac'd; The Hope is rais'd, that cannot but succeed, And found Infallibility indeed. Then flows the Love that no Distinction knows Of System, Sect or Party, Friends or Foes, Nor loves by halves; but, faithful to its Call, Stretches its whole Benevolence to All,— It's universal Wish th' Angelic Scene: That God within the Heart of Man may reign, The True Beginning to the Final Whole Of Heav'n and Heav'nly Life within the Soul. This Faith and this Dependence once destroy'd, Man is made helpless, and the Gospel void. He that is taught to seek elsewhere for Aid, Be who he will the Teacher, is betray'd; Be what it will the System, he's enslav'd: Man by Man's Maker only can be sav'd. In this One Fountain of all Help to trust, What is more easy, natural, and just? Talk what we will of Morals, and of Bliss, Our Safety has no other Source but this. Led by this Faith, when Man forsakes his Sin, The Gate stands open to his God within: There, in the Temple of his Soul, is found Of inward central Life the Holy Ground,— The Sacred Scene of Piety and Peace, Where new-born Christians feel the Life's Increase, Blessing and blest, revive to pristine Youth, And worship God “in Spirit and in Truth.” Had not the Soul this Origin, this Root, What else were Man but a two-handed Brute,— What but a Devil, had he not possest The Seed of Heav'n, replanted in his Breast,— The Spark of Potency, the Ray of Light, His Call, his Help, his Fitness to excite The Strength and Vigour of Celestial Air, Faith, and the Breath of living Christians, Pray'r;— Not the Lip-Service, nor the mouthing Waste Of heartless Words without an inward Taste, But the true Kindling of desirous Love, That draws the Willing Graces from above,— The Thirst of Good that naturally pants After that Light and Spirit which it wants, In Whose blest Union quickly coincide To ask and have, to want and be supplied? Then does the faithful Suppliant discern More of True Good, more of True Nature learn Than from a thousand Volumes on the Shelf In one meek Intercourse with Truth Itself. All that the Gospel ever could ordain, All that the Church's daily Rites maintain, Is to keep up, to strengthen and employ This lively Faith, this Principle of Joy,— This Hope and this Possession of the End Which all her pious Institutes intend, Fram'd to convey, when freed from wordy Strife, The Truth and Spirit of an inward Life, Wherein th' Eternal Parent of all Good By His own Influence is understood; That Man may learn infallibly aright, Blest in His Presence, seeing in His Light, To gain the Habit of a Godlike Mind, To seek His Holy Spirit,—and to find. In this Enthusiasm, advanc'd thus high, 'Tis a true Christian Wish to live and die. THE FORCE OF TRUTH. O force of Truth, beyond suppression great By human wit, skill, cunning or deceit,— Let men attack her in what shape they please, She by herself defends herself with ease! REMARKS ON DR. MIDDLETON'S EXAMINATION OF THE LORD BISHOP OF LONDON'S DISCOURSES CONCERNING THE USE AND INTENT OF PROPHECY. This Passage, Sir, which has engag'd of late So many Writers in such high Debate About the Nature of Prophetic Light, Has not, I think, been understood aright; Nor does the Critic Middleton's new Tract Relate the Meaning fairly or the Fact. Peter, you know, Sir, by his own Account Was with our Saviour in the holy Mount; Where he and two Apostles more beheld The Shechinah, or Glory that excell'd; Saw that Divine Appearance of our Lord Which Three of the Evangelists record, His Face a Sun, and Light His Whole Array,— Prophetic Glimpse of that Eternal Day Wherein, the Glance of Sun and Moon supprest, God shall Himself enlighten all the blest; Shall from His Temple, from the Sacred Shrine Shine forth of human Majesty Divine. To this Grand Vision, which the chosen Three Were call'd before they tasted Death to see, Was added Proof to the astonish'd Ear, That made Presential Deity appear; And by a Voice from God the Father's Throne His Well-beloved Son was then made known. Now, search of Mysteries the whole Abyss, What more entire Conviction, Sir, than this? Of human Reason search the wide Pretence, What more miraculous and plain to Sense? But Reason oft interprets past Event Just as the human Heart and Will is bent. The Doctor, whom his own Productions call No hearty Friend to Miracles at all, Disguises this, to bring his Point about, As if both Sight and Hearing left a Doubt,— Left some Perplexity on Peter's Mind, Quite against all that he himself defin'd: “This wond'rous Apparition, Sir, might leave “Something too hard precisely to conceive, “And Circumstances raise within his Soul “Suspense about the Nature of the whole.” What Kind of saunt'ring Spirit could suggest Such groundless Cavil to a Christian Breast? What Christian Priest, at least, would choose to paint His Saviour's Glory in a Light so faint?— But, let this suit the Priesthood, if you will;— Pray, what Foundation for his critic Skill, For Peter's doubting what he saw and heard, For Scruples first imagin'd, then inferr'd? The Reason here assign'd is “Fear and Dread, “So great that Peter knew not what he said; “He, and his Partners in the Vision too, “Fell on their Faces at Its Awful View, “Nor durst look up, till Jesus at the last “Came to and rais'd them, when 'twas overpast.” O vain Suggestion! Could they see and hear Without an Adoration, without Fear? If they were struck with more than mortal Awe, Their very Fear was Proof of what they saw; For Strength to see and Weakness to sustain Made both alike the Heav'nly Vision plain; Nor has he once attempted to devise What else should strike them with so great Surprise. If, overcome with reverential Dread, Th' amaz'd Apostle wist not what he said, Unbiass'd Reason would itself confess A Greater Light, diminishing its less. Thus, in the Sacred Books if we recall The first recorded Presence since the Fall, Themselves from God when our first Parents hid, It might be said they wist not what they did. Yet were they taught their comfortable Creed, The Promise of the Woman's Conqu'ring Seed; As here th' Apostles were empower'd to see That Jesus, God's Belovèd Son, was He. If, when God spake, each fell upon his Face, How oft, in ancient Times, was this the Case! What Prophet, Sir, to whom He spake of Yore, His Voice or Vision unsupported bore? Moses himself, when unawares he trod On holy Ground and heard the Voice of God, Tho' turn'd aside on purpose to enquire What kept the Bush unburnt amidst the Fire, Stopp'd in his Search by the Divine Rebuke, Straight “hid his Face,” and was “afraid to look.” Abram, the covenanted Sire of all Who in his Faith upon the Lord should call, When he receiv'd the Seal of it, the Sign Of Circumcision, from the Voice Divine, Fell on his Face;—and must we then conceit His Proofs, that God talk'd with him, incomplete? Read how Isaiah thought himself undone, When he had seen God's Glory in his Son, Until the Seraph with a living Coal From off the Altar purg'd the Prophet's Soul. Read how Ezechiel too with like Surprise, When Heav'n was open'd to his wond'ring Eyes, Fell on his Face at the same Glorious Sight, Till by God's Spirit made to stand upright. Thus, Daniel prostrate; thus, the great Divine Who saw th' Apocalyptic Scenes;—in fine, Thus human Strength alone could never stand, When God appear'd, unaided by His Hand. To urge a Reason then from Fear, to doubt The glorious Fact that could not be without, Only befits a feeble, faithless Mind, To heav'nly Voice and Vision deaf and blind. The learnèd Prelate, against whose Discourse This Gentleman has aim'd his present Force, Thought it absurd in any one to make St. Peter for his own Conviction's Sake Say that old Prophecies should be preferr'd To God's Immediate Voice which he had heard. Such a Comparison, he thought, became No sober Man, much less the Saint, to frame; Concluding it impossible, from hence, That this could ever be St. Peter's Sense. Tho' “'tis not only possible,” it seems, “But weak, moreover,” as the Doctor deems, “To doubt it,—a Comparison so just “Peter not only might have made, but must.”— And then he cites rabbinical Remarks, To prove the Parodox from learned Clerks. Not that he minds what any of them writes, But most despises whom he chiefly cites. Lightfoot's Authority,—to instance one,— Is first, and last, and most insisted on; “The Soundness of whose Faith,” he interjects, “And Erudition Nobody suspects.” Or, if the Reader wants a full Display Of these Endowments:“Lightfoot shows the Way “How, by assuming Liberty to take “For granted straight what Premises we make, “Whatever Notions or Opinions tend “To favour that which we would recommend “We may demonstrate by such Arts as these “A Doctrine true, Divine, or what we please.” This, Sir, is his Description of sound Faith; Let us now see what Argument it hath. This trusty Evidence, amongst the rest, Is call'd to prove a Voice from Heav'n a Jest, The Jews' Bath-Kol a cunning acted Part, A Fable, Phantasy or Magic Art, Voice of the Devil or of Dev'lish Elves, To cheat the People and promote themselves. And hence th' Apostle, is the Inf'rence drawn, “That claims the special Notice of the Lawn,” That comes to clear this famous Prelate's Sight, With Reason good preferr'd prophetic Light. So, introduce an Hebrew, foreign Term, Take all for true that quoted Lines affirm, And then assume that the Apostle too Just thought and argued as these Critics do,— And we may prove, from Peter's own Design, That God the Father's Voice was not Divine! But should the Prelate think it mere Grimace To talk of Fable in St. Peter's Case, Whose Words exclude it and expressly speak Of Heav'nly Truth,—how frivolous and weak In his more sober and sedate Esteem Must all this Patchwork Erudition seem! How will a Christian Bishop, too, conceive Of what the Doctor's Margins interweave Touching that Scripture, where our Saviour pray'd, And Heav'n the glorifying Answer made? While from his Note, Sir, nothing can be learn'd But casual Thunder or Bath-Kol concern'd. Will he not ask:“Is it this Author's Aim Under his Bath-Kol Figments to disclaim All Faith in Voices of an heav'nly Kind? Is that the Purpose of his doubting Mind? You see, th' Apostle is extremely clear That such a Voice himself did really hear; He also had such wondrous Proofs beside, That Voice concurrent cannot be denied. And, when our Lord had been baptis'd, there came A Voice from Heav'n in Words the very same. Here, in his answer'd Prayer,—tho' by Mistake Some said “it thunder'd,” some “an Angel spake,”— We have His own Authority Divine: “This Voice,” said He, “came for your Sakes, not Mine.” Would not the Bishop rightly thus oppose Plain Scripture Facts to Learning's empty Shows? What signifies it then upon the whole How poor blind Jews have talk'd about Bath-Kol; What jarring Critics of a later Day Or Lightfoot, here thrice ridicul'd, may say, Or Middleton himself, whose pious Care For giftless Churches prompts him to compare Voices from Heav'n in his assuming Page To Miracles beyond th' Apostles Age, Taking for granted without more ado His wild Hypothesis about them too. Prodigious Effort! See obstructed quite The Gospel Promise and the Christian Right; Cut off at once miraculous Supply; All Healing ceases, when Apostles die; No Tongue inspir'd, no Demon dispossest,— With them the working Spirit went to rest; Forgot the Prophecies that Christ had made, And left Believers without signal Aid. Altho' no Limit in what Scripture saith Be put to Miracles but want of Faith; Altho', without one, foolish to pretend To know their Nature or to fix their End: Yet, if a daring Genius advertise That all but Scripture Miracles are Lies, What Crowds embrace the new Belief and Hope! It suits their Taste,—and saves them from the Pope. Others contend that wond'rous Gifts survive The first three Centuries, or four, or five. Then, Sir, they close their jealous, partial View And grudge Diviner Influence Its Due; Take diff'rent Stations in the Doctor's Track, Blaming and backing his more close Attack: All Miracles beyond his earlier Fence Are Want of Honesty or Want of Sense; All Faith in Bishops, Confessors and Saints Who witness Facts, a Christian Priest recants: They must,—he says they must,—be Fables all That pass the Bounds of his gigantic Wall. Such strange Delusion if a Man embrace, Without some Voice, some Miracle of Grace, It is in vain to Reas'ners of the Cast To urge the Evidence of Ages past. With Minds resolv'd to disbelieve or doubt Small is the Force of History throughout. Freedom of Thought exerted and of Will, To claim the Privilege of judging ill, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs cannot move, Nor Holy Church throughout the World disprove. But, to return.—How does his first Assault On Miracles defend a second Fault; Or Rabbis, or rabbinical Divines, Help Lightfoot's Comment or his own Designs? Lightfoot, without detracting from his Skill, Wrote in this Instance with a careless Quill; Such Inf'rence else had never been annext. He must have seen that the Apostle's Text Could not with Reason either good or great Compare the Prophets with a dev'lish Cheat. This learnèd Writer, Sir, did not attend To Peter's Meaning, or not apprehend; Or, if Excuse may for his Haste atone, He did not well, perhaps, express his own. Since by his present Citer here you see How quite forgetful learnèd Men may be; For, after all the Scraps he had amass'd And this triumphant Inference at last, “The Text,” he says, “had in St. Peter's Views “No Ref'rence to himself, but to the Jews;”— Not, in his Haste, aware that what he said Knock'd all the Bath-Kol Pedantry o' th' Head; That what he thought his borrow'd Pages won, His own gave up, as soon as he had done. For, if St. Peter's Words do not imply What he himself was most persuaded by, But only show what Arguments were fit For their Attention, Sir, to whom he writ,— The Bishop's Reas'ning, which he strives to cloud, Is not unanswer'd only, but allow'd; The very Thing pretended to be shown Is by his own Confession overthrown. Do but observe the Point in Question, Sir, On which the Doctor makes this learned Stir: How he, who talks of “its perpetual Change “By others,” takes the Liberty to range. When a Comparison was judg'd absurd, “Peter could make no other,” was the Word; Then, by a Contradiction plain and flat, “Peter's Comparison could not be that;” And then, again: “supposing that it could;”— Thus he attempts to make the Matter good. “Let Peter be himself assur'd,” says he, “As fully as 'twas possible to be “Of ev'ry Circumstance that pass'd, he might “Have still preferr'd the old prophetic Light. “This was a standing Evidence, and lay “Open to cool, delib'rate Reason's Sway,— “A firmer Argument that brought along “Conviction, Sir, more permanent and strong “To Men of sober Senses and sedate, “Than could the Vision which his Words relate.” Set the perplext Equivocation by That's here involv'd, how easy the Reply To Reasons void, if we distinguish right Betwixt a real and reported Sight! For be the Proof that Prophecies procure More, to the Jews, comparatively sure, As oft the Text is commented upon (Thro' a Mistake, as will appear anon),— Yet his Conviction vácates the Pretence Of Reason, Argument, and sober Sense; Because the Prophets, here to be compar'd As Evidences of what God declar'd, Could but originally hear and see, And be as fully satisfied as he. The Use of Reason has, I apprehend, When full Assurance is attain'd, an End. When we are certain that we see and hear, And ev'ry Circumstance is plain and clear, What can Examination teach or learn? By what Criterion, Sir, shall we discern, When Reason comes to be so deadly cool, The sage Deliberator from the Fool? Conceive St. Peter, if you can, entic'd— Eye-Witness of the Majesty of Christ; Of what the Father in the Mount had done By showing forth the Glory of the Son,— To disbelieve his Senses, and to pore Some ancient standing Evidences o'er; To see if that which, on the holy Spot, He saw and heard, was seen and heard, or not:— Would such a cool deliberating Plan Have made him pass for a more sober Man? If so, then Middleton has hit the White; Sherlock, if not, is thus far in the right, And well may say that no Man in his Wits Could be attack'd by such cold reas'ning Fits. But thus the frigid Argument is brought, Why Peter might in full-persuaded Thought Prefer Predictions in the ancient Law To what himself most surely heard and saw: “For, after all the full convincing Scene “Which he had witness'd, how did he demean?— “With Faith infirm, he shamefully denied “His Master, seen so Greatly Glorified.” Yes, so he did; and gave an humbling Stroke To human Confidence in Reason's Cloak,— Enough to lay all Syllogising Trust In bare Conclusions only in the Dust; An ample Proof that in a trying Hour Ev'n Demonstration loses all its Pow'r; That without Grace and God's Assisting Hand In Time of Need no Evidence can stand. Suppose a Person of the clearest Head, In Logic Arts well grounded and well read,— If, with a selfish Love to Truth alone, He arm himself with Weapons all his own, When a Temptation comes, alas! how soon The valiant Reas'ner turns a mere Poltroon! Peter, tho' void of Learning and of Art, Had a courageous, had an honest Heart; Had natural Abilities beyond All those of which the Critics are so fond; Had hidden Qualities beyond their Ken: They fish for Words; he was to fish for Men. His Faith in outward Evidence was such That Peter trusted to himself too much. When his Denial plainly was foretold, What should have humbled made him grow more bold: “Tho' all should be offended, yet not I! “Not Death itself shall tempt me to deny!” We see in him, Sir, what the utmost Height Of boasted Reason, Evidence and Light, Of Courage, Honesty and even Love Could do without Assistance from Above. It could to humbler Thoughts resist the Call; It proudly could prefer itself to all; It could, in short, upon Conclusions true Do all that Numbers upon false ones do,— Rest on itself, be confident and bounce; And, when the Call to Suff'ring came,—renounce. As human Resolution, Courage, Skill. Conviction, Evidence, or what you will, Can in their Nature only reach so far As Things are subject to an human Bar,— All these, tho' actuating Peter's Zeal, To Christian Doctrine could not set the Seal. God-like Humility, the Sacred Root Whence ev'ry Virtue branches into Fruit, Lays the Foundation of the Christian Life, As Reason governs that of human Strife. And I appeal, Sir, setting Grace aside, How oft is human Reason human Pride, Human Desire of Victory or Fame A Babel tow'ring to procure a Name, A Self-assurance, an untutor'd Boast, That can but form Intention, at the most; Which, tho' directed right, must humbly ask Divine Assistance to perform its Task! This Peter fail'd in, and a Servant-maid Made him, with all his bold Resolves, afraid; With all his sure Convictions, he began To curse and swear, and “did not know the Man.” Till, for a Lesson wond'rously addrest To sink full deep into his humble Breast, The Cock pronounc'd by an awakening Crow Peter the Man whom Peter “did not know.” But how, Sir, did his coward Speech betray Doubt of his Maker's Glorious Display? By what Account in Hist'ry are we taught That e'er it came into its frighted Thought? Or, since 'tis certain that he did deny, What Prophecy did he “prefer” thereby? 'Tis, then, a cold Absurdity to draw From Peter's Weakness this pretended Flaw; To hint Delusion in the God-like Sight, Because the Man was put into a Fright. If from Distrust of Evidence his Fears, From whence his bitter penitential Tears? Whence was it that the Holy Pris'ner shook The Soul of Peter, with One Gracious Look? No Glory then to credit or distrust; And yet th' Apostle's Penitence was just, And he himself but Proof, upon the whole, That Grace alone can fortify a Soul. 'Tis urg'd that “on the other Hand we find, “With Faith confirm'd and with enlighten'd Mind “After the Mission of the Holy Ghost, “That Argument which he applied the most “Was what he calls” (for so the Doctor too Takes here a vulgar Error to be true), “This “more sure Word of Prophecy,” the chief “Of all his Motives to enforce Belief; “From whence he prov'd that Jesus was of old “Describ'd by all the Prophets, and foretold.” Peter's Condition, Sir, is that of all Who from the Heart obey the Christian Call. They by Experience have the triple Sight Of Weakness, Penitence, and heav'nly Light. While others wrangle about outward Show, Nature and Grace and Miracle, they know. Tho' not inspir'd like Peter and th' Eleven, Or struck like walking Paul by Voice from Heav'n, They meet, what others foolishly evade, The real Mission of celestial Aid; Of which, howe'er the Tokens are perceiv'd, No faithful Soul can ever be bereav'd. What does the Share of it that Peter had To all the Doctor's forc'd Refinements add? Might not the Bishop justly give him back Some Compliments bestow'd in his Attack? Such as the “nothing but an empty Strain “Of Rhet'ric, insignificant, and vain;”— The “choosing not to see, of any Theme,” “More than may suit his pre-adopted Scheme;— The “passing over what he should confute, With Matters foreign to the main Dispute;”— And such-like Flow'rs, upon his Pages thrown, That full as well become the Doctor's own. For has the Bishop in his Book denied That Prophecy was properly applied? No; but that Peter did a Thing so odd As to prefer it to the Voice of God. This was the Point requir'd to be explain'd In Contradiction to what he maintain'd; That which the Doctor undertook to clear, And make the Pref'rence of the Saint appear. But while we look'd what Reasons he would bring For so incomprehensible a Thing As common Sense must reckon an Appeal From what th' Almighty should Himself reveal,— Shifting the Circumstances, Time and Place, In short the Question, to another Case, He tell us, not of Prophecy preferr'd To Voice from Heav'n, which he had just averr'd, But, how the Saint applied in his Discourse Prophetic Words to give the Gospel Force; How Peter argued from them, he relates, And proves full well—what Nobody debates. How gravely, Sir, from Fallacy so crude, He prompts th' amusèd Reader to conclude “That any Man, especially a Jew, (As Peter was) might think the Pref'rence due; And what himself had heard th' Almighty speak Might be esteemed comparatively weak!” Under the Millstone oft the struggling Page Bestirs itself, but cannot disengage. “At all Events resolving to confute,” (To use his Logic) “or at least dispute, “Its Author shows great Spirit and great Art, “And well performs the contradicting Part.” But in his subsequent Remarks we find How lamely Confutation limps behind. Fully resolv'd, and singly, to maintain A Paradox so quite against the Grain, The learnèd Antithaumatist must choose “Not to instruct his Reader, but amuse;” Whene'er he touches a prophetic Clause, “Not to illústrate, but perplex the Cause;” To speak some Truth that shows the favour'd Side, And that which gives the whole Connexion hide. Why else a total Silence on the Head Of Miracles in what St. Peter said? How could recited Prophecies alone Prove to the Jews that Jesus was foreshown, Had not there been that other previous Proof To ev'ry thoughtful Jew in His Behoof; Had not such wond'rous Facts struck up the Light, That show'd their Application to be right? Trace the Quotations, Sir, that Peter made, “And see their Force impartially display'd; “See what Solution stated Fact supplies “Without contriv'd Evasion or Disguise!” The first Occasion which th' Apostle took To cite a Passage from a Prophet's Book, Was at that public, wonderful Event, Upon the Blessèd Spirit's first Descent. The faithful Flock that met with one Accord To wait the Gifts of their Ascended Lord, Soon as the Tokens of His Presence came, The Sound Celestial and the Sacred Flame, Began to speak, with holy Ardour fir'd, In various Hymns by Heav'n Itself inspir'd. This joyful Voice of a Diviner Laud Was spread thro' all Jerusalem abroad; And pious Jews from ev'ry distant Clime, Residing there that providential Time, Devout Epitome of all Mankind, Were drawn to witness that which God design'd. His Wondrous Works as Galileans sung, All understood the Spirit-utter'd Tongue; Of Language, then, was no Confusion known: Each heard this one, and heard it as his own. God gave the Word Himself, and all the good Shar'd in the promis'd Gift, and understood; Tho' then astonish'd at the wond'rous Theme, Prepar'd to spread it to the World's Extreme. Others, insensible of Grace Divine, Mock'd at its Influence, and talk'd of Wine: Themselves intoxicated with that Pride By which the deaf in Spirit still deride. 'Twas then that Peter, standing up to show Th' absurd Reproach, gave all of them to know That what these Mockers call'd a drunken Fit Was God's Performance of what Joel writ Of Days then dawning, when He would impart His Gospel Gifts to ev'ry faithful Heart; Pour out His Heav'nly Spirit, and refresh Not single Nations only, but “all Flesh;” All should partake that would of richer Grace, Now fully purchas'd for the human Race. For this was what St. Peter then, inspir'd, Went on to show, and Argument requir'd. The Jews all knew, Messiah was to come; That this of all Prediction gave the Sum;— The Question was, if it had been fulfill'd In Jesus, Whom their wicked Hands had kill'd? Now, to prove this, th' Apostle first applies The Miracles perform'd before their Eyes; God's Approbation of Him, he defines, Was manifest by Wonders and by Signs Done in the midst of them.—See here the Ground Prepar'd, before he offer'd to expound By Arguments of such immediate Force, So plain, so striking, that they must, of Course, Make secondly to such as should take Heed, The Word of Prophecy more sure indeed. And then he shews how the prophetic Word With its exact Accomplishment concurr'd: “What David had prophetically said Jesus fulfill'd in rising from the Dead; Whereof we all are Witnesses.”—Here lay The strength of all that any Words could say; When Numbers present could the Fact attest, Thousands of Souls th' Accomplish'd Word confess'd, That This was He, the Lord, the Holy One, Whom David fix'd his Heart and Hopes upon, And so describ'd as only could agree To Him Whose “Flesh should no Corruption see.” His Resurrection, you perceive, it was That show'd the Prophet's Word now come to pass; That made th' Apostle's Intimation clear: “He shed forth this which we now see and hear.” Again; when Peter had restor'd the lame To perfect Soundness in our Saviour's Name, He told the wond'ring Throng that they had slain The Prince of Life Whom God had rais'd again. “Whereof we are the Witnesses,” says he; Then shows how all the Prophecies agree: “All have successively foretold these Days, And mark'd the Prophet whom the Lord should raise.” So, when the Priests and Sadducees, aggriev'd That such increasing Multitudes believ'd, Ask'd by what Pow'r he acted, Peter said: “By that of Jesus, risen from the Dead; By Him this healing Miracle is wrought;” Then quotes:“The Stone which ye have set at naught, On this, rejected by the Builders' Hands, As a sure Basis all Salvation stands.” No Priest was then so impotently skill'd As to suggest the Passage unfulfill'd; All by the wond'rous Cure were overcome; The living Proof was there, and struck them dumb. In vain a Council then, as well as now, To silence Miracles or disavow: Peter and John could neither be deterr'd; They needs must speak what they had seen and heard. Nor Charge, nor Chains, nor meditated Death Could stop to God's Commands th' obedient Breath; His final Argument still Peter brings: “We are His Witnesses of all these Things.” This, you may read, Sir, was the real Path That Peter trod in his confirmèd Faith; That all the Preachers of the Gospel trod, When they explain'd the Oracles of God; Preach'd what themselves, without a learnèd Strife, Saw, heard, and handled of the Word of Life, When in their Days so mightily it grew, And wrought such Proofs that Prophecy was true: Which, tho' it pointed to the future Scene And oft prefigur'd the Messiah's Reign, Yet gave a Light comparatively dim, That ow'd its Shining Certainty to Him. Thus, Sir,—to come directly to the Text With which the Critics are so much perplex'd; Whereof the real Meaning, fairly trac'd, Lay heaps of Paper printed on it waste,— Had they adverted that St. Peter still From what he saw upon the Holy Hill Argues Apostles not to have surmis'd, Or follow'd Fables cunningly devis'd, But to have witness'd only what they knew From their own Sight and Hearing to be true, And to have justly gatherèd from thence A sure Completion of prophetic Sense; To which the Jews did rightly to attend, Till they themselves should see it in the End;— Had they consider'd this, they would have found Of all their wide Perplexities the Ground; Have soon perceiv'd that in the various Brawl A wrong Translation was the Cause of all. Peter makes no Comparison between Prophetic Word and what himself had seen, As if he thought the Vision in the Mount Less sure to him upon his own Account. This is a Stretch by which the Doctor meant “Of public Patience, sure, to try th' Extent;” Or (still to copy so polite a Clown) “To try how far his Nonsense would go down. “To say the Truth, his Pages indevout “Have furnish'd Matter of Offence throughout; “But here, from knowing what the World would bear, “Grown without Ceremony quite severe,” He would oblige his Readers to admit A thing that shocks or plain or critic Wit,— That dark old Prophecy, in Peter's Choice, Was held more sure than God's Immediate Voice. They must admit, or else they must be weak, Something more sure than Truth Itself could speak! Nor does St. Peter, as the learnèd gloze, Speaking to Jewish Converts here suppose That they would think comparative Distrust Of an Apostle's own Experience just. No true Construction of the Text can guide To such Suspicion, Sir, on either Side. His Words import directly, if you seek Their genuine meaning of the vulgate Greek And mind the previously related Scene,— His Words, I say, most evidently mean: “We saw the Glory, heard the Voice, and thus Have the prophetic Word made sure to us; Which ye do well to follow as a Spark That spreads a Ray through Places that are dark; Till ye with us enjoy the perfect Light And want no Prophecies to set you right.” An English Reader may be led, indeed, To think that, as th' Apostle's Words proceed With “we have also,” it was something more, Some surer Proof than what had gone before. But “also,” tho' without Italics read, Is an Addition to what Peter said. It only shows how our Translation fail'd And made the Blunder that has since prevail'd; Which, tho' sufficiently provok'd to mend, The learned still choose rather to defend. A Writer,—whose freethinking Schemes incite The Bishop and the Doctor both to write; Who had, it seems in Prophecies a Rule First to extol, and then to ridicule,— Took, Sir, his Stand on this corrupted Place, From whence he both might heighten and disgrace. One Point the vulgar Error gain'd alone; While for the other he employ'd his own. Ingenious Authors answer'd him apace, But got no Triumph in this knotty Place. Good Sense oblig'd them wholly to reject St. Peter's Pref'rence in his own Respect; Collins himself th' Absurdity forbore; That Height was left for Middleton to soar. But still some other they suppos'd there was,— Something that Prophecy must needs surpass. What it was not, they easily could see; But what it was, scarce two of them agree. Intent some kind of Pref'rence to provide, Which “also” plainly and “more sure” implied, All by an Error, which the simple Thought Of const'ring right had rectified, were caught. In this Mistake the Bishop too has shar'd, Asserting Prophecy indeed compar'd And by St. Peter to the Voice preferr'd Which he himself upon the Mount had heard. “Yet not,” says he, “as that Freethinker meant; The Words relate but to that One Event That stands upon prophetical Record, To wit, the Glorious Coming of our Lord.” But, one or all, to make a surer Word Than Heav'nly Demonstration is absurd And glaring in the Instance that he chose, Because that Coming, as the Context shows, Was of “such Majesty” as Peter knew That Christ was really cloth'd with in his View, And therefore could not possibly say “We Have also something surer than to see: We were Eye-Witnesses of what we preach, Yet think more certain what the Prophets teach.” He contradicts, in splitting on the Shelf Of our Translation, Peter and himself: The Saint,—by such Restriction of his own As was by him unthought of and unknown; Himself,—who says that Peter in this Place, Admitting Gospel Truth to be the Case, Far from preferring the Prophetic Test, Has manifestly said 'twas not the best. And of all Gospel Truths that you can name This “Glorious Coming” is the one great Aim, The Sum and Substance with Respect to Man Of Heav'nly Purpose since the World began. Divine Intention could no more have been For Christ to suffer, than for Man to sin; Tho', since that fatal Accident befell, Incarnate Love would save him from a Hell; Whereas His “Glorious Reign” amongst Mankind Might from their first Existence be design'd, And, since his Suff'ring, Saving Advent past, What Sense of Justice can deny the last? “His Reigning Glory,” were the Prophets dumb, All Things in Nature cry aloud, “will come.” Besides, what better does the Text afford, To any tolerable Sense restor'd,— Compare, prefer, or construe how you will,— Than that Divine Appearance on the Hill; That ascertaining in a Heav'nly Light Our Saviour's Glory by a present Sight; That Record which the Father thereupon Gave of His Son to Peter, James and John, So full of Proofs that, let what will be chief, Doubt is too near akin to Disbelief? The Doctor says, “'tis surely no Offence “To true Religion or to common Sense, “To think that, tracing Circumstances out, “Perplext Apostles might be left in Doubt.” Yet may a serious Reader think it is From one plain Circumstance, and that is this:— When they descended from the Sacred Place After partaking of this Heav'nly Grace, Our Saviour charg'd them that they should not tell To any Man the Vision that befell, Till He Himself was risen from the Dead. The Vision, then,—if He knew what He said,— Was true and real; while, if you complete The Doctor's Hints of possible Deceit, To give his rash Reflexions any Force, Our Lord Himself must be deceiv'd, or worse. Such Things would follow;—but the horrid Train Is too offensive even to explain. In fine, these Comments which the Learnèd make On Peter's Words, are owing to Mistake; Those which the Doctor has been pleas'd to frame Upon his whole Behaviour, are the same. Nor is more Learning needful in the Case Than to consult the untranslated Place. The Phrase, you'll see, asserts what I assert, And leaves no Critic Room to controvert. Grotius, whose Paraphrase the Doctor quotes, Gives it this Meaning in his learnèd Notes: “The Word of Prophecy we all allow To be of great Authority, but now With us much greater, who have seen th' Event So aptly correspond with its Intent.” This paves the Way to a becoming Sense And overthrows our Author's vain Pretence: “Vain Art and Pains employ'd upon the Theme, “To dress up an imaginary Scheme: “Of which, the whole New Testament around, “Nor Foot nor Footstep, Sir, is to be found.” Tradition—tho' of Apostolic Kind, Such as was Enoch's Prophecy—you find Contemptuously call'd “I know not what,” Tho' by St. Jude so plainly pointed at. Because, if Jude's Authority be good, Prophets existed long before the Flood; That glorious Advent, set so oft in View, Both in the ancient Scriptures and the new, Of Him Who first was promis'd at the Fall, Hope of all Ages, was foretold in all. If Enoch and if Noah preach'd away, Was Adam, think ye, silent in his Day? Had he no Loss to tell his Children then, No Saving Righteousness to preach to Men? Did God ordain two Saviours, in the Case Of ante- and of post-diluvian Race? Let oral mention or let written fail: If good,—that is, if christian—Sense prevail, It never can permit us to reject Consistency of Truth for their Defect. One God, One Saviour and One Spirit still Recurs, let Bookworms reason as they will. Whatever saves a Man from being curst, What Man can say, God hid it from the first? Or, if he does, and talks as if he knew, Will want of Writings prove that he says true? With or without them Fancy can take aim; If wanting, triumph, or, if not, disclaim;— Let them abound, no Miracles make out; Let them be silent, make Apostles doubt. The two main Pillars of his whole Discourse Whereon the Doctor seems to rest its Force, And begs the Reader, Sir, to recollect In his Conclusion, are to this Effect: “That Gospel Proofs on Prophecies relied, “Singly and independently applied; “And that the first, from whom its Preachers draw “Their Proof of Christ, is Moses in the Law.” Both which St. Peter's Evidence, again, Shows to be Slips of his too hasty Pen. For when th' Apostle at the Temple Gate Restor'd the Cripple to a perfect State, And took Occasion from the healèd Lame To preach the Gospel in our Saviour's Name, Thus he bespake the People that stood by: “God by the Mouth”—(observe the Sacred Tie!)— “Of all His Prophets hath foreshown His Son, Jesus, by Whom this Miracle is done.” Which of them singly then did Peter cite, What Independency, where all unite; Where all predicted, as one Spirit bid, That “Christ should suffer,” as He really did;— “And enter into Glory;”—for that next The Preacher speaks to in the following Text: Where, in his Exhortation to repent, “Jesus,” he tells them, “shall again be sent; Heav'ns must receive Mankind's Appointed Head, Till Time hath done whatever God hath said By all His Prophets since the World began;—” For so the Sense, without curtailing, ran? Of which the Doctor quoting but a Part, Has yet dissolv'd the Charm of all his Art; Since all the Prophets—let the World begin With Moses, if he will,—are taken in And, join'd together, must, whate'er he thinks, Produce a Chain, however few the Links. 'Tis true, he afterwards begins to quote; And, first, “the Prophet of whom Moses wrote;” Adding, that “all who in Succession came Had likewise spoken of the very same.” “The same;”—see how prophetic Words conspire,— God's Own, predicted to the Jewish Sire; “And in thy Seed,” so Peter's Words attest, “Shall all the Kindreds of the Earth be blest.” Proofs of our Saviour Christ you see him draw From in, from after, from before the Law. What can be said in Answer, Sir, to this? The Fact is plain, tho' Peter judg'd amiss; For, “such defect,” he scruples not to own, “Collins against th' Evangelist has shown: “The very Gospels have some Proofs assign'd Of loose, precarious, and uncertain Kind.” This Unbeliever,—in the shocking Terms, In which his Cause a Clergyman confirms,— “Has Arguments unanswerably strong “To prove their Manner of applying wrong; “Altho', whatever Difficulties lie “Against the Way wherein they shall apply, “It is the best which, of all other Ways, “The Case affords;”—so runs his rev'rend Phrase! So Deist and Divine, but both in vain, Seek to unfasten the prophetic Chain! Should the New Testament be treated so By one whose Character we did not know, Might not the Language miss its aim'd Effect, And rather tempt the Reader to suspect That some presumptuous Mocker and self-will'd Had Enoch's, Jude's, and Peter's Words fulfill'd? To clear a tortur'd Passage from abuse This good Effect may possibly produce: That when a Writer of the modern Mode Shall cast Reflexions on the Sacred Code, Men will not merely upon sudden Trust In bold Assertions take them to be just; Since it may be that he has only made Of great Mistakes a critical Parade; Has only spoken Evil of those Things Of which he does not really know the Springs; Has met with Matters high above his reach, And, scorning to be taught, presum'd to teach, Raising about them an affected Cry, That ends in nothing but a “Who but I?” “Bare Prophecy,” the Doctor has profess'd, “Admits Completion only for its Test; “Th' Event foretold by it must also be “What human Prudence never could foresee, “Nor human Power produce; or else no Sign “Could thence appear of Agency Divine.” Prophecy, then, as his Descriptions own, Can be made sure by Miracles alone: It is what he himself is pleas'd to call, While unfulfill'd, no Evidence at all. How is it, then, in his repeated Term Of “standing Evidence” more sure and Firm? How is this consonant to “standing” still As none at all, till Miracles fulfil? If it has none till they are overpast, Is not the Evidence from them at last? From them prophetic Word, before obscure, Becomes an Evidence confirm'd and sure; Its Truth is first demónstrated, and then Reflects its Light on Miracles again. A hungry Question, therefore, to enquire, Of two great Proofs that actually conspire Which is the best; when, with united Light, They both produce an Evidence so bright. But the Freethinker, “with a crafty View,” (If what his learn'd Assistant says be true) “Had rais'd prophetic Credit to Excess, “In order more securely to depress; “And for this Cause his Lordship undertook “To write, it seems, at all Events, a Book.” This being, then, the Motive which he had, A Reader asks “What is there in it bad?” With what Decorum does a Priest accuse A Bishop writing against “crafty” Views,— Views of an Enemy to Gospel Truth? Is the defending of him less uncouth? Does such Defence, with such a Rudeness writ, The Priest, the Bishop or the Cause befit,— So interlarded with that loose Reproach Which want of Argument is wont to broach; So deeply ting'd the Ciceronian Style With, what the Critics commonly call Bile, That they, who thought it worth their while to seek The Author's Motive, judg'd it to be Pique. Soon as you enter on the Work, you see An instant Sample what the whole will be. First, “being jealous of the Bishop's Views, “His Book for Years he dar'd not to peruse, “Afraid to trust so eminent a Guide, “For fear his Judgment should be warp'd aside;” Tho' quite secure;—“for he had ever found “Authority to be a treach'rous Ground; “And even this—this capital Affair,” That was to lead his Judgment to a Snare, “He found—and just as he expected too, Who fear'd before a Bias from his View,”— When graciously inclin'd to see it since,— “Quite of a Kind that never can convince;” Which, to be sure, afforded Reason good To write a Book against it, lest it should. Had any other Author, less polite, With vulgar Phrase attempted thus to write, And thus begun so fine a Scheme to spin, “The Reas'ners of this World had broken in, “Rudely unravell'd all his fine-spun Scheme,” And sent him forth to seek another Theme. How suited this to any good Design That should engage a Christian, a Divine! But what are Names, if “not a single one Be worth Regard, for sixteen Ages gone;” If “to enquire what any of them say Be,” as he thinks, “but wasting Time away;”— Himself excepted in the modest Creed, Unless he writes for Nobody to read? Sure, of all treach'rous Guides, the greatest Cheat Is that of wild, unchristian Self-conceit! Possess'd by this domestic, inbred Pride, The wise Freethinkers scorn the Name of Guide. Their own Sufficiency with Eyes their own Clearly beheld, they trust to that alone, Resolv'd no other Maxims to imbibe Than what their Reason and their Sense prescribe,— That is, Themselves; for what a Man calls his In such a Case is really what he is; Choose how refin'd an Egotist may be, His Reason, Judgment, Mind, and Sense is he. In such Confinement if he sits enthrall'd,— No Matter by what Title he is call'd,— Blind as a Sadducee to Heav'nly Light, He will believe his own Conceptions right; No Prophecy to him can seem more sure, Nor Miracle attested work his Cure. That of Conversion from his own dark Mind Must first convince him that he once was blind; Then may he see with salutary Grief The dire Effects of wretched Unbelief. Looser and looser from all sacred Ties, To what strange Heights a self-taught Sophist flies! Friendship to Doctor Middleton sincere Must, if exerted, wish him to forbear A Kind of writing on the Christian Cause, That gains him no desirable Applause; That, whether meant or not, may unawares Involve a Reader in freethinking Snares,— Involve himself. If frequent the Relapse, A Teacher of Divinity, perhaps, May run the Risk of being quite bereft, Of having nothing but the Habit left. May that which teaches rightly to divide The Word of Truth, be his petition'd Guide; Or, if resolv'd at present to pursue At future Leisure a mistaken Clue, May future Leisure—an uncertain Date,— If granted, find him in a better State! PETER'S DENIAL OF HIS MASTER. I “Tho' all forsake Thee, Master, yet not I; I'll go to Prison with Thee, or to die,” Said Peter;—yet how soon did he deny! II A striking Proof, that even to good-Will The Help of Grace is necessary still To save a Soul from falling into Ill. III His Master told him how the Case would be; But Peter could not see himself, not he! Till Grace withdrew, that he might come to see. IV Peter, so valiant on a selfish Plan, Quite frighted by a Servant-maid, began To curse and swear, and “did not know the Man!” V 'Twas thus that “Satan sifted him like Wheat,” And made him think his Courage was so great; While Jesus pray'd that he might see the Cheat. VI High-minded in himself, he fell,—how low, The Cock instructed him, foretold to crow: His real Self then Peter came to know. VII He that “would die with Him, tho' all forsook,” Dissolv'd in Tears, when Jesus gave a Look, And learn'd Humility by Love's Rebuke. VIII Lesson for us is plain from Peter's Case, That real Virtue is the Work of Grace, And of its Height Humility the Base. FAMILIAR EPISTLES TO A FRIEND, UPON A SERMON ENTITLED THE OFFICE AND OPERATIONS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, BY THE REV. MR. WARBURTON. LETTER I. A strange Discourse in all impartial Views This which you lent me, Doctor, to peruse. Had you not ask'd, a Subject of this Sort Might of itself a few Remarks extort, To show how much a very learnèd Man Has been mistaken in his preaching Plan. Preaching—a Talent of the Gospel Kind,— By “preaching Peace through Jesus Christ” defin'd, Should, one would think, in order to increase The Gospel Good, confine itself to Peace; Exert its milder Influence, and draw The list'ning Crowds to Love's united Law. For, should the greatest Orator extend The Pow'rs of Sound to any other End, Regard to healing Sentiments postpone, And battle all that differ from his own: Tho' he could boast of Conquest, yet how far From “Peace through Jesus” through himself is War; How widely wanders from the true Design Of preaching Christ the bellicose Divine! If amongst them who all profess Belief In the same Gospel such a warlike Chief Should in the Pulpit labour to erect His glaring Trophies over ev'ry Sect That does not just fall in with his Conceit, And raise new Flourish upon each Defeat,— As if, by dint of his haranguing Strain, So many Foes had happily been slain: Tho' it were sure that what he said was right, Is he more likely, think you, to invite, To win th' erroneous over to his Mind, By Eloquence of such an hostile Kind, Or to disgrace, by Arts so strongly weak, The very Truths that he may chance to speak? Like Thoughts to these would naturally rise Out of your own occasional Surprise, When, purchasing the Book, you dipt into't And saw the Preacher's Manner of Dispute: How, Man by Man, and Sect by Sect display'd, He pass'd along from Preaching to Parade; Confuting all that came within his Way, Tho' too far off to hear what he should say. Reason, methinks, why Candour would not choose, Where no Defence could follow, to accuse; Where gen'rous Triumph no Attacks can yield To the unquestion'd Master of the Field, Where Names, tho' injur'd without Reason why, Absent or present, can make no Reply To the most false or disingenuous Hint, Till Time, perchance, produces it in Print; When, we may take for granted, it is clad In its best Fashion, tho' it be but bad! This one Discourse is printed, we are told, The Main of sev'ral Sermons to unfold. For one grand Subject all of them were meant,— The Holy Spirit, Whom the Father sent; Th' Indwelling Comforter, th' Instructing Guide; “Who was,” Christ said, “for ever to abide With and in His Disciples here below,” And teach them all that they should want to know. A glorious Theme,—a comfortable one For Preachers to exert themselves upon, First taught themselves, and fitted to impart God's Truth and Comfort to an honest Heart! Some such at least imagine to have been Amongst the Flock that came to Lincoln's Inn, With a sincere Desire to hear and learn That which became a Christian's chief Concern; Pleas'd with the Preacher's Text, with Hopes that he Might prove an Instrument in some Degree Of their Perception of an holy Aid, Fruit of that Promise which the Saviour made; Might help them more and more to understand How near true Help and Comfort is at Hand; How soon the Spirit moves upon the Mind, When it is rightly humbled and resign'd: With what a Love to ev'ry Fellow-soul One Member of the Church regards the Whole; Looks upon all Mankind as Friends, or shares To heartiest Enemies his heartier Pray'rs. I might go on; but you, I know, will grant, Such is the Temper that we really want; And such, if Preachers ever preach indeed, If Pastors of a Flock will really feed, They will endeavour solely to excite, And move divided Christians to unite, If not in outward Forms that but supply A loftier Babel without inward Tie, Yet in a common Friendliness of Will, That wishes well to ev'ry Creature still; That makes the Centre of Religion's Plan A God-like Love embracing ev'ry Man. LETTER II. No Office seems more sacred and august Than that of Preachers who fulfil their Trust, Working with God, and helping Men to find The Prince of Life, the Saviour of Mankind, Who “came Himself a Preacher from on high Of Peace to all, the distant and the nigh.” So said the Saint, whose preaching was the same To Jew, to Greek,—Salvation thro' His Name,— Who taught thro' Him to preach immortal Life, Avoiding Questions that engender Strife; Patient, and meek, and gentle unto all, Instructing ev'n Opposers without Gall, If peradventure God might give them Grace The Truth, when kindly offer'd, to embrace. If these Conditions Preaching may demand, What must we think of the Discourse in Hand? Which, when we read, is apter to suggest A diff'rent Temper in the Preacher's Breast; A Text perverted from its native Scope, A Disappointment of all hearing Hope? Here is a long Dispute, in his first Head, About what Doctor Middleton had said; That “when the Gift of Tongues was first bestow'd, “'Twas but an instantaneous Sign that show'd “The Gospel's chosen Minister; and then, “That Purpose signified, it ceas'd again; “So was its Type, the fiery Tongue, a Flash “Of Light'ning quickly vanish'd,”—and such Trash; To which a Minister, who knew the Press, Ill chose the Time when preaching to digress; To take a Text affording thro' the Whole Such grounds of Comfort to a christian Soul, And then neglect, to preach a poor Debate That could but shine at pamphleteering Rate; That from the Pulpit must disgust the Pew Of sager Bench, and sober Students too. You may, hereafter, if you choose it, see How they mistook, both Middleton and he, The Gift of Tongues; how little quite throughout They knew, tho' learnèd, what they were about. In present Lines, I shall but just relate One Instance of the not uncommon Fate Of learnèd Men who, in deep Points exact, Forget sometimes the most apparent Fact. Th' Apostles, gifted by the Holy Ghost, Began to speak with Tongues at Pentecost; “But did not,” so the Preacher says, “begin To speak, before the Multitude came in.” He urges roundly how in this Respect “The learned Middleton did not reflect, “That in a private Room they all were set, “And Tongues not spoken till the People met.” Now, if you read the Pentecostal Facts, As you will find them written in the Acts. From his Reflexion tho' the Point lay hid, The Text affirms expressly that they did. No Learning wanted to determine this; 'Tis what a reading Child could never miss. This very Gift, it is exceeding clear, Was that which brought the Multitude to hear: “Speaking with Tongues” foregoing Words proclaim, The next, “when this was nois'd abroad, they came.” Scarce to be thought that, studying the Case, With formal Purpose to explain a Place, A Man so learnèd and acute could make, Could preach, could publish, such a flat Mistake. But 'tis the Fate of great and eager Wits To trust their Memory too much by Fits. To prove that Middleton's Dispute was wrong Takes up the Pages, for a Sermon, long. Soon after this you'll see another start, To fill his First Division's Second Part. For, having touch'd upon the Names of all The Gifts enumerated by Saint Paul, Then, in what Sense the Scripture was inspir'd, Higher or lower, comes to be enquir'd. The high he calls “organical;” the low “Partial and true,” as he proceeds to show. This is the Summary of what is said Touching the Holy Ghost in his first Head, As “Guide to Truth” and aiding to excite, To clear, to give the Understanding Light. What makes it Sermon is the Text prefixt, Tho' scarce a Word of it is intermixt;— Consistently enough, for it has none Which suit the Topics that he dwells upon,— Topics without a Dignity to grace Text, Office, Audience, Person, Time, or Place! But, were this all, and did not what he spake Lead by Degrees to serious Mistake, Taking a Text for Form's Sake, to prepare The Church to hear some Shop-renown'd Affair— Too oft the Turn of the polite Divine!— Would hardly merit your Regard or mine. But, Sir, it is not only misapplied, This glorious Text, but in effect denied Or misconceiv'd; and therefore, cutting short At present Errors of less fatal Sort, Let us pursue this Subject in the next, And from the Sermon vindicate the Text. LETTER III. You wonder'd much why any Man of Parts Would use in Preaching low, invective Arts; By which the vain Disputings that infest The Christian World have seldom been supprest, But often heighten'd, and that use destroy'd For which fine Talents ought to be employ'd. If one can judge from reading this Divine,— Whose Parts and Talents would be really fine, If juster Notions of the Heav'nly Grace Taught but the earthly not to quit their Place,— If one can judge, I say, from stated Laws In his Discourses what should be the Cause Of such Perversion of a lively Wit In erudite Possessors, this is it: They think that now Religion's sole Defence Is Learning, History and critic Sense; That with Apostles as a needful Guide The Holy Spirit did indeed abide; But, having díctated to them a Rule Of Faith and Manners for the Christian School, Immediate Revelation ceas'd, and Men Must now be taught by apostolic Pen; Canon of Scripture is complete, and they May read, and know what Doctrine to obey. To look for Inspiration is absurd; The Spirit's Aid is in the written Word: They who pretend to His Immediate Call, From Pope to Quaker, are Fanatics all. Thus, having prov'd at large to Christians met What no one Christian ever doubted yet, That the New Testament was really writ By Inspiration, which they all admit, He then subjoins that “this inspir'd Recórd “Fulfill'd the Promise of our Blessed Lord;”— Fulfill'd it “eminently,” is the Phrase;— “For tho' the Faithful, in succeeding Days “Occasionally find in ev'ry Place “The Spirit's ordinary Help, and Grace, “His Light Supreme, His constant, fixt Abode, “Is in the Scriptures of this Sacred Code. This was the Sense, not easy to explore, When, reck'ning up the Spirit's Fruits before, “Scripture,” said he (which this Account explains) “Does not record them only, but contains,”— “CONTAINS,” in Capitals: as if he took The Scripture to be something more than Book,— Something alive, wherein the Spirit dwelt, That did not only tell His Fruits, but felt. “The sure Deposit of the Spirit's Fruits “In Holy Scripture,” he elsewhere computes, “Fulfill'd the Saviour's Promise in a Sense “Very sublime.”—So it should seem from hence, That “eminently,” and “sublimely,” thus The Holy Spirit should abide with Us. If I mistake him, or misrepresent, You'll shew me where, for 'tis not with Intent. I want, if possible, to understand A Sentence coming from so fam'd a Hand. Tho' plain the Words, 'tis difficult to solve What christian Sense he meant them to involve; In ev'ry Way that Words and Sense agree, 'Tis perfect Bibliolatry to me. No Image-Worship can be more absurd Than idolising thus the written Word, Which they who wrote intended to excite Attention to our Lord's Predicted Light,— To that same Spirit, leading human Thought, By Which themselves, and all the good were taught Preaching that Word, which a Diviner Art, Which God Himself had written on the Heart. How can the best of Books,—for 'tis confest That of all Books the Bible is the best,— Do any more than give us an Account Of what was said, for Instance, on the Mount; Of what was done, for Instance, on the Cross, In order to retrieve the human Loss? What more than tell us of the Spirit's Aid, Far as His Fruits by Words can be display'd? But Words are only the recording Part; The Things contain'd must needs be in the Heart. Spirit of God no more in Books demands To dwell Himself, than “Temples made with Hands.” “Fruits of the Spirit,” as St. Paul defin'd, “Are Love, Joy, Peace,”—the Blessings of the Mind, The Proofs of His “Abiding.”—Who can brook A meek, a gentle, good, long-suff'ing Book; Or let true Faith and Temperance be sunk To Faith in Writings, that are never drunk? In fine, whatever Pen and Ink presents Can but contain historical Contents; Nor can the Fruits of Spirit be in Print In any Sense, but as recorded in't. Plain as this is, and strange, as you may think, The learnèd Worship paid to Pen and Ink, It is the main Hypothesis, you'll find, On which are built Discourses of this Kind; Which yet can give us for a Scripture Clue What contradicts its very Letter too, As this has done—be shown, as we go on, By these important Verses of St. John! LETTER IV. The Gospel's simpler Language being writ, Not for the Sake of Learning or of Wit, But to instruct the pious and the meek,— When its Intent mere Critics come to seek, We find on plain intelligible Text The variorum Comments most perplext. Such is the Text before us, and so plain The Saviour's Promise which the Words contain, That Men for modern Erudition's Sake Must read and study to acquire Mistake; Must first observe the Notions that prevail Amongst the famous in their Church's Pale,— Firm in the Prejudice, that all is right Which Books or Persons most in Vogue recite; Then seek to find how Scripture coincides With each Decision of their knowing Guides. Without some such Preparatives as these, How could the forc'd Interpretation please That makes a Sacred Promise to bestow Perpetual Aid exhausted long ago, In one short Age? For God's Abiding Guide Withdrew, it seems, when the Apostles died, And left poor Millions ever since to seek How dissonant Divines had construed Greek. In graver Writers one has often read What in Excuse of Book-worship is said: “It is not Ink and Letter that we own “To be Divine, but Scripture's Sense alone; “We have the Rule which the Apostles made, “And no Occasion for immediate Aid.”— Suppose, for once, the gross Delusion true,— What must a plain and honest Christian do? The Spirit's Aid how far must he extend, To bring his Saviour's Promise to an End? This he perceives Discourse to dwell upon, And yet “for ever to abide” has none. He for the Sake of Safety would be glad To have that Spirit which Apostles had; Not one of them has writ but says, “he may;” That “tis the Bliss for which he ought to pray:” That “God will grant it him,” his Saviour said, “Sooner than Parents give their Children Bread.” If reading Scripture can improve a Soul, This is the Sum and Substance of the whole, And gives it Value of such high Degree. For, tho' as Sacred as a Book can be, 'Tis only so, because it best revives Thought of that Good which animated Lives; Because its Authors were inspir'd to write, And saw the Truth in Its own Heav'nly Light; Because it sends us to that Promis'd Source Of Light and Truth, Which govern'd their Discourse, The Holy Spirit's Ever-present Aid, “With us, and in us”—so the Saviour pray'd— That, when He left the World, the Holy Ghost Might dwell with Christians, as an Inward Host; That Teaching, Truth, and Comfort in the Breast Might be secur'd by this Abiding Guest. “Yes; with Apostles.”—Sunk by such a Thought Th' inestimable Treasure down to Naught! An History of Sunshine may as soon Make a blind Man to see the shining Noon, As Writings only without inward Light Can bring the World's Redemption into Sight. Jesus, the Christ, the very Book has shown, Without the Holy Spirit none can own;— In Words, they may; but, what is plainly meant, They cannot give a real Heart-Consent. What Friend to Scripture, then, Sir, can displace This Inward Witness of Redeeming Grace, And rest the Gospel on such outward View, As any Turk may rest his Koran too? Nay, he can own a written Word or Work That Christians do, and yet continue Turk. Why do the Christian Disputants so fill The World with Books of a polemic Skill, When 'tis the Sacred, and acknowledg'd one That all their jarring Systems build upon,— But that the Spirit does not rule their Wit, By Which at first the Sacred one was writ, Of Whose Support great Scholars stand in need As much as they who never learnt to read? Unhappy they, but for that Living Guide, Whom God Himself has promis'd to provide,— A Guide, to quote the blessèd Text again, “For ever to abide” with Christian Men! Fond of its Books, poor Learning is afraid And higher Guidance labours to evade. Books have the Spirit in Supreme Display; Men but in lower, ordinary Way! This strange Account of Men and Books is true, It seems, “according to the Promise” too! Such wild Conceits all Men have too much Wit, Or learnèd or unlearnèd, to admit; But, when some Interest or Custom rules And chains obsequious Wills to diff'rent Schools, The wisest then, Sir, will relinquish Thought, And speak like Parrots just as they are taught.— What this should be, what spends in vain the Fire Of brisker Tempers, let us next enquire. LETTER V. When Christians first receiv'd the joyful News, “Messiah come,” unmixt with worldly Views; When the whole Church with Heav'nly Grace was blest, And from the Spirit Comforter possess'd One Heart, one Mind, one View to common Good: Then was the real Gospel understood. “Then was the Time,”—to cite what you will find The Preacher noting—“when the World combin'd “Its Pow'rs against it, but could not destroy; “When holy Martyrs with enraptur'd Joy “Encounter'd Death, enabled to sustain “Its utmost Terror and its utmost Pain. “At such a Juncture Heav'n's uncommon Aid “Shone forth, to help Humanity display'd. “But now”—his Reason for abated Grace Diff'rence of primitive and present Case,— “Now, Ease and Honour” (mind the Maxim, Friend!) “On the Profession of the Faith attend. “At first establish'd by Diviner Means, “On human Testimony now it leans; “Supports itself, as other Facts must do “That rest on human Testimony too; “Sufficient Strength is the Conviction there, “To make the present Christian persevere. Here lies the Secret that may soon unfold Why modern Christians fall so short of old; Why they appear to have such diff'rent Looks, The Men of Spirit and the Men of Books. When Racks and Gibbets, Torment and Distress Attended them who ventur'd to confess, They had, indeed, a fixt and firm Belief, To die for One Who suffer'd like a Thief; Stretch'd on the Wheel, or burning in the Flame, To preach a Crucified Redeemer's Name. Courage like this compendious Proof supplied Of Heav'ns true Kingdom, into which they died. Thus was the Wisdom of the World struck dumb, And all the Pow'rs of Darkness overcome; Gospel prevail'd by its internal Light, And gave the Subject for the Pen to write. But when the World with a more fatal Plan To flatter what it could not force began; When “Ease” and “Honour,” as the Preacher saith, Attended the Profession of the Faith: Then wrought its Mischief in the too secure The secret Poison, slower, but more sure. Commodious Maxims then began to spread, And set up Learning in the Spirit's Stead; The Life diminish'd, as the Books increas'd, Till Men found out that Miracles were ceas'd; That, with respect to Succours more sublime, The Gospel Promise was but for a Time; That Inspiration amongst Men of Sense Was all a mere fanatical Pretence,— And divers like Discoveries, that grant To “Ease” and “Honour” just what Faith they want;— Faith to profess that wond'rous Things of old Did really happen, as the Books have told; But with a Caution, never to allow The Possibility of happ'ning now: For, as the World went on, it might affect An honourable Ease in some respect, To own celestial Comfort still inspir'd, And suff'ring Courage as at first requir'd,— Quite proper then, but equally unfit, When once the sacred Canon had been writ. For upon that (is gravely here averr'd) Part of the Spirit's Office was transferr'd; Books once compos'd, th' Illuminating Part He ceas'd Himself, and left to human Art To find within His Scriptural Abode Th' Enlight'ning Grace that Presence once bestow'd. These Suppositions if a Man suppose, You see th' immediate Consequence that flows: That Men and Churches afterwards attack'd Are pre-demolish'd by asserted Fact; Which, once advanc'd, may with the greatest Ease Condemn whatever Christians he shall please; Owing to his Forbearance in some Shape, If aught th' extensive Havoc shall escape. With such a Fund of Learning, and a Skill To make it serve what Argument he will; With choice of Words for any chosen Theme; With an Alertness rulingly supreme,— What, Sir, can single Persons or a Sect, When he is pleas'd to preach at 'em, expect? Just what they meet with in the present Case: All the dogmatic Censure and Disgrace That a commanding Genius can exert, When it becomes religiously alert,— With narrow Proofs, and Consequences wide, Sets all Opponents of its Rote aside; The Papists first, and then th' inferior Fry, Fanatics, vanquish'd with a “Who but I?” These are the modish Epithets that strike At true Religion and at false alike; Of these Reproaches Infidels are full, Their Use in others verging down to dull.— How one, who is no Infidel, applies The hackney'd Terms, may next salute your Eyes. LETTER VI. By “Reformation from the Church of Rome” We mean, “from Faults and Errors,” I presume. Against her Truths to prosecute a War Is protestant Aversion push'd too far; In them, should “Ease” and “Honour” not attend The fair Profession, one should be her Friend. She thinks that Christ has given to His Bride, His Holy Church, an Ever-present Guide; By Whose Divine Assistance she has thought That Miracles sometimes were really wrought; That by the Virtue which His Gifts inspire Great Saints and Martyrs have adorn'd her Quire. Now, say the worst that ever can be said Of that Corruption which might overspread This Church in gen'ral; cast at her the Stone They who possess Perfection in their own;— Yet, were instructive Volumes to enlarge On bright Exceptions to the gen'ral Charge. They that love Truth, wherever it is found, Would joy to see it ev'n in romish Ground; Where, if Corruption grew to such a Size, The more illustrious must Examples rise Of Life and Manners;—these, you will agree, Are true Reformers, wheresoe'er they be. Of all the Churches, justly loth to claim Exclusive Title to a Sacred Name, What one, I ask, has ever yet denied The Inspiration of the Promis'd Guide? Our own—to which the Def'rence that is due Forbids no just Respect for others too— Believes, asserts, that what Reform she made Was not without the Holy Spirit's Aid. If to expect His Gifs, however great, Be popish and fanatical Deceit, She in her Offices of ev'ry Kind Has also been fanatically blind. What Form of her composing can we trace Without a Pray'r for His Unstinted Grace? Taught by the Sacred Volumes to infer A Saviour's Promise reaching down to her, Greatly she values the recording Books; But for fulfilling in herself she looks. That she may always think aright and act By God's Good Spirit, is her pray'd-for Fact,— Without His Grace confessing, as she ought, Her Inability of Act or Thought. Nor does she fear fanatical Pretence, When asking Aid in a sublimer Sense. Where she records amongst the martyr'd Host A “Stephen, fillèd with the Holy Ghost,” She prays for that same Plenitude of Aid By which the Martyr for his Murd'rers pray'd; That she like him, in what she undergoes, May love and bless her persecuting Foes. Did but one Spark of so Supreme a Grace Burn in the Breast, when Preaching is the Case, How would a Priest, unpersecuted, dare To treat, when mounted on a sacred Chair, A Church of Christ, or any single Soul By Will enlisted on the Christian Roll, With such a prompt and contumelious Ire As Love nor Blessing ever could inspire? Altho' untouch'd with a Celestial Flame, How could an English Priest mistake his Aim,— So far forget the Maxims that appear Throughout his Church's Liturgy so clear; Wherein the Spirit's ever Constant Aid Without a feign'd Distinction is display'd,— Without a rash attempting to explain By Limitations foolish and profane When, and to whom, to what Degree and End, God's Graces, Gifts and Pow'rs were to extend,— So far withdrawn that Christians must allow Of nothing “extra-ordinary” now,— The vain Distinction which the World has found, To fix an unintelligible Bound To Gospel Promise,—equally Sublime, Nor limited by any other Time Than that, when Want of Faith, when earthly Will, Shall hinder Heav'ns Intentions to fulfil? If, not confining any promis'd Pow'rs, The Romish Church be faulty, what is ours? Does our own Church in her ordaining Day, Does any consecrating Bishop say, When on the future Priest his Hand is laid: “Receive the Spirit's ordinary Aid?” Do awful Words, “Receive the Holy Ghost!” Imply that He abides in Books the most,— Books, which the Spirit Who first rul'd the Hand, They say themselves, must teach to understand? His Inspiration, without Limits too, All Churches own, whatever Preachers do; Not even Miracles, tho' set aside In private Books, has any Church denied.— How weak the Proofs which this Discourse has brought To justify the fashionable Thought, That Gospel Promises of any Kind By Spirit or by Scripture are confin'd To apostolic or to later Times, May be the Subject of succeeding Rimes. A STRICTURE ON THE REV. MR. WARBURTON'S DOCTRINE OF GRACE. I Writing or Scripture, Sacred or profane, Can only render History more plain Of what was done or said by God or Man, Since the Creation of the World began. Tho' ev'ry Word in Sacred Page be true, To give Account is all that it can do. II Now an Account of Things, as done or said, Is not a living Letter, but a dead,— A Picture only, which may represent, But cannot give us, what is really meant. He that has got a Map into his Hand May use the Name, but knows it is not Land. III So, in the Bible when we come to look, (That is, by way of Eminence, The Book) We must not fancy that it can bestow The Things themselves which we desire to know. It can but yield, however true and plain, Verbal Directions how we may obtain. IV Tho' a Prescription be directly sure Upon the Patient's taking it to cure, No one imagines that the worded Bill Becomes itself the Remedy for Ill. The Med'cines taken, as the Bill directs, Procure the salutiferous Effects. V Who, then, can place in any written Code The Holy Ghost's, the Comforter's, Abode? “Constant Abode,—supreme Illumination,”— What Copy can be This, or what Translation? The Spirit's Dwelling, by th' attesting Pen Of all th' inspir'd, is in the Hearts of Men. VI Were Books his constant Residence indeed, What must the Millions do who cannot read? When they who can so vary in their Sense, What must distinguish true from false Pretence? If they must follow where the learnèd guide, What diff'rent Spirits in one Book abide! VII Genius for Parodox, however bright, Cannot well justify this Oversight. Better to own the Truth, for the Truth's Sake, Than to persist in such a gross Mistake! Books are but Books: th' illuminating Part Depends on God's good Spirit in the Heart. VIII “The Comforter,” Christ said, “will come again, Abide with, dwell in”—not your Books, but—“you.” Just as absurd an Ink-and-Paper Throne For God's Abode as one of Wood and Stone! If to adore an Image be Idolatry, To deify a Book is Bibliolatry. AN ANSWER TO SOME ENQUIRIES CONCERNING THE AUTHOR'S OPINION OF A SERMON PREACHED AT ? UPON THE OPERATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. I “Say to the Sermon?”—Why, you all were by, And heard its whole Contents, as well as I. Without discussing what the Preacher said, I'll tell you, Sirs, what came into my Head. II While he went on, and learnèdly perplext The genuine Meaning of his chosen Text, I cast my Eyes above him, and explor'd The Dove-like Form upon the Sounding-board. III That Bird, thought I, was put there as a Sign What Kind of Spirit guides a good Divine, Such as at first taught Preachers to impart That pure and simple Gospel to the Heart;— IV A perfect, plain, intelligible Rule, Without the dark Distinctions of the School That, with a nice, sophistical Disguise, Hide the clear Precepts from the People's Eyes. V Whatever Doctrine in one Age was true Must needs be so in all succeeding too; Tho' Circumstance may change, its inward Aim Thro' ev'ry outward State is still the same. VI No thinking Christian can be pleas'd to hear Men who pretend to make the Scripture clear, With low Remarks upon the Letter play, And take the Spirit of it quite away. VII Be Time, or Place, or Person, or what will, Urg'd in Support of such a wretched Skill, It all amounts but to a vain Pretence, That robs the Gospel of its real Sense. VIII Taught by the Saviour and by holy Men, 'Tis now the very same that it was then, Not to be alter'd by unhallow'd Pains. The World may vary, but the Truth remains. IX In consecrated Phrases one would think That Priests and Pulpits were not made to sink. Profaner Wits can do it that Disgrace;— What need of holy Orders in the Case? X The modish, critical Haranguer heard May be admir'd,—may be perhaps preferr'd,— Who sinks the Dictates of the Sacred Page Down to the Maxims of the present Age. XI But o'er his sounding Canopy why bring The Harmless Dove to spread Its Hov'ring Wing? How in the Church by such a Shape exprest Fulness of Brain and Emptiness of Breast! XII Of Heads so fatten'd and of Hearts so starv'd A different Emblem'should, methinks, be carv'd: The Owl of Athens, and not Sion's Dove,— The Bird of Learning, not the Bird of Love. ON PREACHING; An Epigram. The specious Sermons of a learnèd Man Are little else but Flashes in the Pan; The mere Haranguing upon what they call “Morality” is Powder without Ball; But He who preaches with a Christian Grace Fires at our Vices, and the Shot takes Place. FOUR EPISTLES TO THE REV. MR. L?, LATE VICAR OF BOWDON, UPON THE MIRACLE AT THE FEAST OF PENTECOST. EPISTLE I. Baguley, August 12, 1756. I Our Folks gone a-visiting, Reverend Sir, Having left me at home here, less able to stir, I am thinking on Matters that lovingly pass'd Where the Squire of the House and I visited last,— At the Vicar's of Bowdon, old Friend of us two And a lover of Learning fair, honest and true; Especially such as shall make to appear Any Passage of Scripture more easy and clear. II The Scripture was writ, and is oft understood, By Persons unlearnèd, but pious and good, Who have much better Helps than mere Learning can yield, Which may yet be of use in its own proper Field;— If it be but to mend its own Faults in a Brother, And correct in one Man the Mistakes of another; Or to combat our Scruples and fix a true Thought, When the Head shall confirm what the Heart has been taught. III One Thing, I remember, that fell in our Way, Was the speaking in Tongues on the Pentecost Day; Which our Friend the Divine had conceiv'd in a Light That, however so thought, does not seem to be right. All the Comments, 'tis true, that one ever has met, Concur with his Notions about it; but yet The Mistake is so plain that I wish by some Means To obtain his Review of those wonderful Scenes. IV It is not my Thought; for I first was appris'd Of the Thing by a Jacob, too greatly despis'd; Dipping into whose Writings, which little I knew, Some Expression like this was presented to View: “All Languages spoken by Peter in one;”— A Truth which the Moment I enter'd upon, All the Force of Simplicity, Fitness and Fact Extorted assent that I could not retract. V If the honest old Vicar, our visited Friend, To St. Luke's own Account will be pleas'd to attend, I cannot but think that the current Conceit Will yield to Solution so clear and complete Of a Number of difficult Points, that arise Upon viewing the Text with unprejudic'd Eyes;— If “Speakers” were more than Apostles, and “spoken” But to one in fifteen was a sensible Token. VI For the Names to that Number, if rightly I count By a Baguley Bible, of Nations amount; Who all understood what a Peter or John, Or whoever he will, was discoursing upon,— And to all at one Time; for how plain to be seen That Persons nor Place could admit of fifteen; When Parthians, and Medes, Elamítes, and the rest, Must be too intermix'd to be singly address'd! VII “Are not these,” said the Men, the devout of each Land, “Galileans that speak, whom we all understand?—” As much as to say,—“By what wonderful Pow'rs Does the Tongue Galilean become, to us, ours?” While the good were so justly astonish'd, the bad, Whose Hearts were unopen'd, cried out, “They are mad.” Unaccountable Charge, if we do not recall That in one single Tongue the Apostles speak all! VIII For separate Speakers and Tongues, it is clear, Good and bad without Madness might equally hear; And surprise in the bad would be equally keen, How illiterate Men could speak all the fifteen. But the Miracle, wrought in the simplest of Ways, In both good and bad well accounts for Amaze. One was sensibly touch'd with a Gift so Divine; One stupidly rais'd the Reproach of “new Wine.” IX When St. Peter stood up, and to all the whole Throng Show'd the Truth in a Sermon so good and so long, But to one fifteenth Part was it only then shown,— To the worst, the Jerusalem Scoffers alone; Whilst all the good Strangers, not knowing one Word, Stood unedified by?—This is greatly absurd. God pour'd out his Spirit—that answers all Mock,— And spake by St. Peter to all his whole Flock. X The vulgar Objection which commenting Strain Has made to a Thing so exceedingly plain, Is: “The Miracle then would not be in the Speaker, It would be in the Hearers.”—Now, what can be weaker? For the Gift in this case had a twofold Respect, And must needs be, in both to produce its Effect,— To account for the Fact, which the Comments forgot, Why the pious could hear what the Mockers could not. XI It is nowhere affirm'd that th' Apostles acquir'd Any Tongue but their own, tho' Divinely inspir'd. St. Peter, St. John are soon mention'd again, And describ'd as unlearnèd and ignorant Men.— But enough,—or too much! For the Shortness of Time Gives a hint to set Bounds to th' Extension of Rime. Our Friend will acknowledge, tho' hasty the Letter, This Question's Solution,—or give us a better. XII So I shall not here touch upon Hebrew and Greek; Where a Rabbi so able, if minded to seek, May observe other Points in which Learning, that makes Many Things clear enough, has occasion'd Mistakes. Whether this be one Instance, I only desire That a suitable Leisure may prompt to enquire; For to me it appears, that the Miracle done Was all by one Language, as clear as the Sun. EPISTLE II. November 30, 1756. I Many Thanks have been order'd this Day to attend The Receipt of your Letter, Dear Vicar and Friend; Which at first, being left to your Leisure to frame, Was sure to be welcome, whenever it came. The Point which the Muse had a Mind to propose In her free-spoken Rimes, you have handled in Prose. All fair on both Sides; because, say it or sing, Truth alone in the Case is the principal Thing. II But I cannot but marvel, that much better Sight Than my own should not see so Meridian a Light As that of the speaking at Pentecost Time By the Spirit of God to the good of each Clime In one single Tongue, by that Spirit inspir'd, Whose Assistance did all that could then be requir'd; Whose Power, it is certain, could make itself known, By a Number of Tongues or by one Tongue alone. III So needless the Many, so simple the One, That I wonder what Judgment can hesitate on, Or a learnèd Enquiry that finds, if it seek, That the Tongue might be one in Construction of Greek; Which, as Comma takes Place, as old Gregory said,— Nazianzen I think—either way may be read. “They speak in our Tongues;” or, as Crystalline clear The Fact is to my Understanding, “We hear.” IV I sent you some Reasons from Baguley why The Tongue was but one, which you choose to pass by, And to comment St. Luke in a many-tongu'd Way That darkens the Light which I took to be Day. And Day it is still; for Account that you give “So plain and so obvious” is Water in Sieve; Which seems to be something at first-looking View, But by Holes “plain and obvious” it quickly runs through. V “The Tongues which appear'd, and which sat upon each, “All cloven and fiery,” you argue, “may teach, “And by Notice symbolical make it discern'd, “That they spake in such Tongues as they never had learn'd.” Need I tell an Hebræan, that “Tongue” is the same In Relation to Fire, as the English Word “Flame Which appears to be cloven;” and Proof that is spun From the Tongues or the Flames—has too much of the Pun? VI When you ask, “Pray, what Reason can else be assign'd “For Tongues?” I ask you, “Pray, what Reason for Wind?” Not to shun a fair Question; but “Tongue” being “Flame” May have answer'd already your questioning Aim. I think that an Air, that a Flame from Above, Both is and betokens the Life and the Love;— Which if Christians were blest with, one Language would do, And, their whole Body fill'd with, there could not be two. VII But let them be Symbols, the Tongues, if you will, Of the Grace which the Spirit was pleas'd to instil,— His Gift is as Good, if, in speaking their own, Men made the same Truth in all Languages known. This Effect you will grant the Good Gift to intend. Now, supposing two Ways of atttaining one End, Is that Explication less likely or just, Which takes the more simple, more plainly august? VIII Your Account is quite new in one Thing that I meet, That is, “That the Speakers went into the Street, Or went out of the House to the Multitude met.” For of this going-out I have never read yet; Or, if ever I did, have forgotten the Book, And can find nothing said in th' Account of St. Luke But what should imply both profane and devout Coming into the House, and not them to go out. IX May one ask what Authority, then, you have got For the Scene and Succession which here you allot To the speaking Disciples, in Number fifteen, By an Order well-fancied, but not to be seen In the Acts or elsewhere the New Testament through; Nor—what I shall just give a Hint of to you,— Will you find an Apostle, not even a Paul, In a Tongue not his own ever preaching at all. X I agree, that “the Mockers who mock'd with the Throng Knew only their vulgar, Jerusalem Tongue.” But when you say, further, what cannot but strike, “That the Nations, too, all understood it alike,”— Your order'd Confusion of speaking a Store To a Crowd out of Doors is more puzzling and more. In the midst of such Darkness if you can see Light, You need not complain of the Want of Eye-sight. XI Thus, my dear old Acquaintance, I run thro' your Plan, And defend my Conviction as well as I can. As to what a Bengelius or Wesley may raise From twelve hundred and sixty prophetical Days,— As the Book is not here, if it otherwise could, My Skill in the German can do you no good; But the Part that you mention, my Author foretells Will be put in our Tongue by a Doctor at Wells. XII So writes younger Wesley, who call'd here and din'd; And to him I subscrib'd for it;—tho', in my Mind, What Prophets have written, it's Learning in vain Without some prophetical Gift to explain. Nay, in Points that are clear, beyond any fair Doubt, It is fifteen to one that the Learnèd are out. This Ratio, I find, in one Instance is true; Excuse the Presumption!— Dear Vicar, Adieu! EPISTLE III. I I hope that the Vicar will pardon the Haste, With which an Occasion once more is embrac'd Of getting some Knowledge in Points that I seek From one so well vers'd both in Hebrew and Greek, In a Question of Fact where a friendly Pursuit Has the Truth for its Object, and not the Dispute,— Which, tho' Haste should encroach upon metrical Leisure, Will be sure, if it rise, to be kept within Measure. II It would save much voluminous Labour sometimes, If Disputes were tied down to dispassionate Rimes, As well as to Reasons.—But, not to digress, Having weigh'd his Responses both larger and less, I resume the same Subject, same Freedom of Pen, To entreat for some small Satisfaction again In Relation to Points which, appearing absurd, Have extorted poetical Favour the third. III Three Things are laid down in Prose Favour the last, And Regard to his Thoughts would have none of them pass'd. To his first it was paid, to his future shall be; But let “Veritas magis amica” be free!— First, “manage the Comma,” says he, “how you will; “Speak or Hear, the same Sense will result from it still.” Yes, the Sense of the Context, “????????? ??????” “While they speak in their Tongue, we all hear in our own.” IV “The Hebrew word ‘,’ or ‘Tongue,’ says he next, “Whene'er it is us'd by itself in a Text, Never signifies ‘Fire,’ never signifies ‘Flame;’” And believing it true, I say also the same. But in joint “,” “Tongue of Fire,” or “a Blaze,” Foreign Languages claim no Symbolical Phrase. Tho' “Tongue” may occasion Mistake to befall, It has here no Relation to Language at all. V “Short Issue,” he thinks, “the Dispute will admit,” And desires me to answer this Query, to Wit: “Were the ‘Tongues,’—the ‘new Tongues,’ which a Promise was made That Disciples should speak, as St. Mark has display'd,— New Languages such as have never been got By learning before-hand to speak them, or not?” To which for the present, till Somebody show That it must have this Meaning, my Answer is: “No.” VI Now, this, if he can, I could wish he would do, And prove the Construction “new Languages” true In the Sense that he means; for, when all understood One Person who spake, it was really as good As if Numbers had spoken, or Promisèd Grace Were interpreted “Languages” here in this Place. The Effect was the same, and may answer the Pith Of all that his Second has favour'd me with. VII Still difficult, then, if we carefully sift, Is the Vulgar Account of the Pentecost Gift, Which the Learnèd advance, and establish thereon What the Vicar has built his Idéas upon, With Additions thereto which, as far as I see, Not one of the Learnèd has added but he. For Example, if some, very few, I presume, Have describ'd the Disciples as quitting the Room. VIII But let them be many;—what Reason, what Trace Do we find of their leaving the sanctified Place? Of a Wind from above did they fear at the Shake, And the House, thro' a Doubt of its falling, forsake? Or did they go forth to the gathering Quire, Lest the many bright Flames should have set it on Fire? If a Thought could have enter'd of going away, What Circumstance was not strong Motive to stay? IX Then again: “that the Foreigners, all of them, knew The Language then us'd at Jerusalem too.”— For the Miracle's Sake one would here have demurr'd, Which is render'd so needless, improper, absurd, That Jerusalem Mockers would really have had A Pretence to allege that the pious were mad. For of speaking strange Tongues what accountable Aim, Or of hearing fifteen, when they all knew the same? X Add to this: the Disciples, the Hundred-and-twenty, Spake amongst one another strange Tongues in like Plenty;— “One by one,” says the Vicar, who very well saw What Confusion would rise without some such a Law As the Text has no Hint of; which says, “they began To speak by the Spirit,” not “Man after Man.” Could Time have suffic'd for so doing, yet why Speak the Tongues of such Men as were none of them by? XI The Vicar saw, too, that this could not attract Any Multitude thither, supposing it Fact; And so he conceiv'd that “a Rumour was spread By the Men of the House,”—of whom nothing is said. Now, when Men of his Learning are forc'd to find out Such unchronicl'd Salvos to dissipate Doubt, One is apt to infer a well-grounded Suspense, And the more to look out for more natural Sense. XII I wish my old Friend would consider the Case, And how ill it consists with Effusion of Grace To speak Parthian, and Median, and so of the Rest, To none but themselves, being present, address'd! Unless he can grant, on revolving the Point, That indeed there is something not rightly in Joint, Or solve one's Objections, or show one the Way How to clear up the Matter,—what can a Man say? EPISTLE IV. I I have, with Attention, dear Vicar, repass'd Your obliging Reply to the Lines in my last; Am sorry 'tis final; yet cannot but say That your Patience to hear me has gone a great Way, And extinguish'd all Right to require any more, If I “put you to prove ‘Two and Two to make Four;’”— Very difficult Task, as one cannot deny, When there's Nothing more plain to demónstrate it by! II But if “Two and Two, Four,” I am thinking, has claim To self-evident Truth, has this Comment the same: “The New Tongues which are mention'd in Promising Page Are the Old ones, subsisting for many an Age?” Is it really as plain, as that Four is twice Two, That in no other Sense they could ever be “new” But as new to the Speaker, John, Peter, or Paul, While the Tongues in themselves had no Newness at all? III Were this a true Thesis and right to maintain, Yet “Two Halves are one Whole” is, however, more plain, Till the Proof, which is wanted, shall make it appear How the two Propositions are equally clear. “This Proof may be had from the Chapter,” you say, “Which relates what was done on the Pentecost Day,— The best of all Proofs.”—But, to do the fair Thing, Give me Leave to examine what Reasons you bring! IV “That ‘???????’ is ‘Languages’ oft, if you seek “In the Septuagint or the New Testament Greek, “Acknowledge you must.”—Yes; 'tis really the Case.— “‘???? ????????? ????????’ in this very Place “Must mean, ‘in our Languages.’ Sense, you must own, “Is the same as in ‘?? ???????? ????,’— “‘In our Languages,’ or ‘in our Dialect.’”—Yes, “Two and Two making Four” is not plainer than this. V But how it flows hence, that in cited St. Mark It has no other Meaning, I'm quite in the dark. Few Words of a Language are always confin'd To a Meaning precisely of just the same Kind. For the Roots of the Hebrew in Hutchinson's School, I remember, they had such a Kind of a Rule; But the Reach of its Proof has been out of my Pow'r, Tho' I've talk'd with their Master full many an Hour. VI I believe that by Grace, which the Spirit instill'd, “They shall speak with New Tongues” was exactly fulfill'd In our Saviour's Disciples; that, Grace being got, They did so “speak in Tongues,” as before they could not. With respect to good Strangers partaking of Grace, For “speak with new Tongues” “with new Languages” place, And the Promise fulfill'd we may very well call By one Spirit-form'd Tongue which instructed them all. VII If the bold Alexandrian Stroke of a “No” Had been “Yes,” in my Last—and it would have been so, If the Facts had requir'd it,—what could it have shown, Tho' the Text had this Meaning, if not this alone? For how do all Languages, spoken in One, Disagree with the Promise insisted upon? I allow it fulfill'd; let the Vicar allow The Fulfilling, itself, to determine the How. VIII God's Wonderful Works when Disciples display'd, And spake by the Spirit's Omnipotent Aid, Ev'ry one understood in a Language his own “Loquentibus illis,”—“????????? ?????,”— “While they spake,”—at the first; for good Greek and good Sense Forbid us to form an unwritten Pretence For dividing of Tongues, when the Spirit's Descent Gave at once both to speak and to know what was meant. IX But thus to interpret, it seems, you forbid By placing the Stop as old Gregory did, Who thought as you think; tho' you bring, I agree, At least a more plausible Reason than he, From a Passage that suits with your Meaning alone: Acts the 10th, “for they heard”—“?????? ??? ????? ?????????,” “them speaking,”—and “????????”—“in Tongues;” Where, indeed, to that Greek that Construction belongs. X By transposing two Words the grammatical Lot Shows when they are absolute, when they are not. But be it “them speaking,” as you would collect, “In our Languages” still it will never affect The Force of those Reasons, from which 'tis inferr'd That at once they were spoken, at once they were heard; Nor of those which deny that “Tongues,” quatenus “new,” Mean always precisely what “Languages” do. XI That Evidence, Vicar, which here you have brought, Cross-examin'd, will certainly favour this Thought. For Cornelius converted, and Company too, Without Intervention of Languages new,— How can any one think, but from Prejudice bred, Tho' honest, from what he has often heard said, That then they were all on a sudden inspir'd To speak with strange Tongues, when no Reason requir'd? XII But now, being got to the End of a Tether Prescrib'd to your Trouble, I leave to you whether “Tongues” anywhere else in the Sense you assert Were spoken to Purpose, that is, to convert,— Or whether your Patience can bear to excuse A Reply to your Hints on the Sense that I choose? In the mean Time I thank you for Favours in Hand And, speaking or silent, am Yours to Command. A LETTER TO A FRIEND, UPON THE MEANING OF ST. PAUL'S EXPRESSION OF “SPEAKING WITH TONGUES,” 1st Corinthians, ch. xiv. If you remember, Rev'rend Sir, the Talk That pass'd betwixt us in the Garden Walk, The “Gift of Tongues” was mention'd; when I thought That Notion wrong which learnèd Men had taught, And that this Gift was not at all concern'd With that of speaking Languages unlearn'd. St. Paul, I said, in his Corinthian Charge, Had treated on the Subject more at large; From whose Account one plainly might deduce The genuine Gift, its Nature and its Use; And make appear from Passages enow The vulgar Notion not to be the true; But that to “speak in Tongues,” or “speak in Tongue,” Was meant of Hymns which the Corinthians sung. This is the “Gift” which the Apostle paints, And lays its Practice under due Restraints. You know the Chapter.—First, then, let us see How “Tongues” do there with “Languages” agree; Then, how with “Hymns;” and let which better suits Th' Apostle's Context regulate Disputes. First: “he that speaketh in a Tongue”—“unknown,” Translators add for Reasons of their own— “Speaketh to God, and speaketh not to Men;”— Peculiar Tokens of an Hymn! Again: “For no Man understandeth him.” From hence 'Tis plain that “Languages” was not the Sense. Would he rise up who had them at Command, To speak in one that none could understand? What can be more unlikely to suppose? Yet thus the learned Commentators glose, As their Mistake about the Gift implied The Christians guilty of this awkward Pride! Such Fact they make no Scruple to advance, As would appear absurd in a Romance. One in his softer, one his harsher, Terms, The same miraculous Disgrace affirms; All from the Difficulty try some Shape, Whilst there is no escaping, to escape. Whereas to “Hymns” all Phrases correspond. Of them Corinthian Converts were too fond; And Paul, who will'd them really to rejoice, But more with Heart affected than with Voice, Authority with Reason mix'd employs, Not to repress, but regulate their Joys. The Benefit of Hymns he understood; But, most intent upon the Church's Good, The “Gift prophetic” more expedient found,— That is, to preach the Gospel, or expound— Than to sing Hymns. “The Prophet speaks,” says Paul, “To Men; instructs, exhorts and comforts all.” “Speaking in Tongue,” or Hymning (to proceed), “May edify the Singer's Self indeed; But Prophecy, the Church;” a private Soul Should always yield the Pref'rence to the Whole. Consistent all, if “Hymning” he explains; If “Languages unknown,” what Sense remains? Would Paul affirm, that speaking might do good In foreign Languages, not understood, To a Man's Self? Would he so gently treat Such a suppos'd enormous Self-conceit? Would he vouchsafe to pay, the Chapter thro', Respect to “Tongues,” if taken in this View? Would he allow, nay choose it?—For that next Is said of Tongues in the succeeding Text. “I will you all to speak with Tongues.” To sing Makes this a plain, intelligible Thing. The other Meaning which they spread about, No Commentators have, or can make out. That he should will them all to sing was just, And properly to use the Gift, or Trust; For his Intention was not to reduce Singing itself, but its improper Use. It was the good Apostle's great Concern To preach the Gospel so that most might learn; This was the Gift in which he rather will'd Such as had been converted to be skill'd. “Speaking in Tongue” was good; but this, he knew, Was the more useful Talent of the two; “Greater its Owner,” but with an “Except,” That shows the Justice for an Hymner kept, The Matter sung who if he could express To edify the Hearers, was not less; “Interpretation” render'd them alike. But does not this absurd Supposal strike, That in plain Speaking on some Christian Head One should interpret what himself had said; First, use a Language to the Church unknown, Then, in another, for his Fault atone? What Reason possible can be assign'd, Why the known Tongue should be at first declin'd? This Difficulty, and so all the rest, The Nature of an Hymn explains the best. “Now, should I come amongst you,” says the Saint, “Speaking with Tongues”—should only come to chant— “What shall it profit you, except I preach,— Some Revelation, Knowledge, Doctrine teach?” And here the vulgar Meaning of the Word For Apostolic Use is too absurd; He scarce would “if” the speaking in a Tongue Unknown to Christians whom he came among; Nor would a Question find with him a Place About their Profit in so gross a Case. He plainly hints a Coming, not design'd To please their Ear, but to instruct their Mind,— The real Profit which he pointed at; And Hymns themselves were useless without that. That such a Speaking, as is mentioned here, Was musical, is evidently clear From the Allusion which he then propounds, To “Pipe,” and “Harp,” and instrumental Sounds; Which none can urge with Reason to belong So properly to Language as to Song. Tho' it may serve for both in some respect, Yet here one sees to which it must direct: “If Pipe or Harp be indistinctly heard, No Tune or Meaning can be thence inferr'd; If an uncertain Sound the Trumpet yield, How shall a Man make ready for the Field?” Thus of dead Instruments.—Of them that live, “So ye,” th' Apostle adds, “except ye give Words by the Tongue, that Men can apprehend, Ye speak, but as to Hearers to no End; And”—what with hymning Posture seems to square— “Will be like Men who speak into the Air. “So ye,” to show how Tune and Song agree, “Except ye utter with the Tongue,” says he, “Words that are easy to be understood,”— Which in a foreign Tongue they never could,— “How shall the Thing be known to any one That ye have spoken”—that is, sung—“upon?” And—what with hymning Posture seems to square— He adds, “for ye shall speak into the Air.” “Except ye utter with the Tongue”—“unknown” Translators here thought fit to let alone; “Unknown, and easy too to understand,” That could not be: “unknown” they must disband. It was enough to show them their Mistake, To see what Incoherence it would make; Yet they, not minding, just as they think fit, Sometimes insert it, and sometimes omit. But if the Epithet at first be right, Why is it kept so often out of Sight? Do not Omissions carry all along Tacit Confession of its being wrong,— Tacit Confession, which is open Proof How little can be said in its Behoof? “They who shall speak in Tongue, and they who hear, Unless the Meaning of the Voice be clear,”— The Sense not being “within mutual Reach,”— “Will be,” says Paul, “Barbarians each to each,”— Or “Foreigners;”—“and, therefore,” is his Drift, “With all your Fondness for the speaking Gift, Have the whole Church's Benefit in View; Let him who speaks in Tongue interpret too!” Can such Concession, such Allowance made Suit with that insupportable Parade And Show of Gift which Commentators vent, Giving a Meaning that could scarce be meant? While Zeal for Hymns, a natural Effect In Novices, tho' wanting to be check'd, Accounts for checking, for allowing Phrase, For ev'ry Motive that St. Paul displays,— His placid Reas'ning and his mild Rebuke, For which no Insolence of Gift could look? No Insolence, I say, of such a Kind As Commentators rashly have assign'd To the first Christians; which the latter now, Suppose it offer'd, never would allow. “For if I pray in Tongue,” St. Paul pursues, “My Spirit prayeth; but no Fruit accrues To them who do not understand my Pray'rs.”— And what the Remedy which he prepares? Why, it is this: “I will so”—sing or—“pray, That all may understand what I shall say.” Plain the two Phrases in the Verse proclaim, That “praying” here and “singing” is the same; That some Corinthians so display'd their Art That none but they themselves could bear a Part. Hence “to interpret Hymns” his Words ordain, Or else “to sing intelligibly plain;”— Praying, or praising. “For,” says he again, “How shall unlearned Persons say ‘Amen’ To thy Thanksgiving, if, when thou shalt bless, They understand not what thy Words express? Thou verily hast given Thanks, and well; But this, unedified, they cannot tell.” The common Benefit is still his Aim,— True, real Glory of the Christian Name. In Languages unknown was Pray'r and Praise Perform'd by Christians in th' Apostles Days? Was that a Time, or was the Church a Place, For gifted Ostentation to disgrace? [Cætera desunt.] A DIALOGUE BETWEEN RUSTICUS, THEOPHILUS AND ACADEMICUS, ON THE NATURE, POWER AND USE OF HUMAN LEARNING IN MATTERS OF RELIGION. (From Mr. Law's Way to Divine Knowledge.) Rusticus. Yes, Academicus, you love to hear The Words of Jacob Behmen made so clear; But the Truth is, the fundamental Good At which he aims you have not understood. Content with such good Notions as befit Your learnèd Reason and your searching Wit To make a Talk about, you gather still More ample Matter for your Hear-say Skill. You know yourself as well as I, that this Is all your Joy in him; and hence it is That you are so impatient, ev'ry Day, For more and more of what his Pages say,— So vex'd and puzzled, if you cannot find Their Meaning open'd to your eager Mind, Nor add new Notions and a stronger Force, To heighten still your Talent of Discourse. With all your Value for his Books, as yet This Disposition makes you to forget How oft they tell you, and how well they show, That this inordinate Desire to know,— This heaping up of Notions, one by one, For subtle Fancy to descant upon, While Babel, as you think, is overthrown,— Is building up a new one of your own. Your Babylonish Reason is the Pow'r That seeks Materials to erect its Tow'r; The very Scriptures under such a Guide Will only nourish your high-soaring Pride; Nor will you penetrate with all your Art Of Jacob's Writings the substantial Part. The Works of Behmen would you understand? Then, where he stood, see also that you stand! Begin where he began; direct your Thought To seek the Blessing only that he sought,— The Heart of God; that by a right true Faith He might be sav'd from Sin and Satan's Wrath. While thus the humble Seeker stood resign'd, The Light of God broke in upon his Mind; But you, devoted to the Pow'r alone Of speculative Reason, all your own, Would reach his Ladder's Top at once, nor try The Pains of rising Step by Step so high.— But on this Subject, by your Looks, I see You'd rather hear Theophilus than me. Theophilus. Why, really, Academicus, the Main Of all that Rusticus, so bluntly plain, Has here been saying, tho' it seem so hard, Hints Truth enough to put you on your Guard. Much in the same Mistake your Mind has been, That many of my learnèd Friends are in; Who, tho' Admirers to a great Degree, Of Truths in Jacob Behmen which they see, Yet of all People have the least Pretence To real Benefit receiv'd from thence. Train'd up in Controversy and Dispute, Accustom'd to maintain or to refute All Propositions only by the Light Of their own Reason judging what is right, They take this Guide in Truths of ev'ry Kind, Both where it sees and where it must be blind; So that in Regions where a Light Divine Demonstrates Truth, and Reason cannot shine, The real Good is hidden from their View, And some such System rises up in Lieu, As Birth or Education, Mode or Place, In Course of Life has led them to embrace. Thus with the learned Papist in his Creed The learned Protestant is not agreed;— Not that to either Truth and Light have taught To entertain so opposite a Thought; But Education's contrary Supplies Have giv'n them protestant, and popish Eyes; And, Reason being the accustom'd Light Of both the Parties and of either Sight, Decisions protestant, and popish too, Can find it Work enough and Tools enow To shape Opinions of a diff'rent Growth; Whilst Learning is an open Field to both, And of its Harvest the inur'd to reap With greater Skill can show the greater Heap. Academicus. So, then, I must, as I perceive by you, Renounce my Learning, and my Reason too, If I would gain the necessary Lights To understand what Jacob Behmen writes. I cannot yield as yet to such Advice, Nor make the Purchase at so dear a Price. I hope the Study of the Scripture Text Will do for me, and leave me unperplext With his deep Matters.—Little did I know That Learning had in you so great a Foe. Theophilus. Be not uneasy; Learning has in me No Foe at all, not in the least Degree,— No more than has the Science or the Skill To build an House to dwell in or a Mill For grinding Corn. I think an useful Art Of human Things the noblest, for my Part. Knowledge of Books or Languages, or aught That any Person has been duly taught, I would not ask him to renounce, or say They might not all be useful in their Way; I would not blame, within its proper Place, The Art of throwing Silk, or making Lace, Or any Art confin'd to its own Sphere: But then, the Measure of its Use is there. Some we call liberal, and some we call Mechanic; now, the Circle of them all, Does that show forth in its most perfect Plan The natural Abilities of Man,— The Pow'rs and Faculties of human Mind, Whether the Man be well or ill inclin'd? The most unjust and wicked Debauchee, Regarding neither God nor Man, may be In any one or more of all the Train Of greater Skill than others can obtain. But now, Redemption of the human Race By Christ, with all its Mysteries of Grace, Is in itself, as it has always been, Of quite another Nature, nor akin To Art or Science, which for worldly Views The natural or outward Man can use. It is an inward Fitness to revive That heav'nly Nature which was once alive In Paradise,—that blissful Life within The human Creature which was lost by Sin. It breathes a Spark of Life, to re-create The poor fall'n Man in his first happy State; By which, awaken'd into new Desires, After his native Country he enquires; How he may rise above this earthly Den, And get into his Father's House again. This is Redemption, or the Life Divine, Off'ring itself, on one Hand, with Design That inward Man who lost It to restore To all the Bliss which he was in before; And on the other, 'tis the Man's Desire, Will, Faith and Hope, which earnestly aspire After that Life,—the Hunger, Thirst and Call To be deliver'd by It from the Fall. Now whether Man in this awaken'd Strife Breathe forth his Longings after this good Life In Hebrew, Greek, or any English Sound, Or none at all but silent Sigh profound, Can be of no Significancy; he That knows but one, or uses all the three, Neither to him more distant or more near Will this redeeming Life of God appear. Can you conceive it more to shine upon Men of more Languages, than Men of one? He who can make a Grammar for High Dutch, Or Welsh, or Greek, can you suppose, as such, In Faith and Hope and Goodness will excel A Man that scarce his Mother Tongue can spell? If this Supposal, then, be too absurd, No Hurt is done, no Enmity incurr'd, To Learning, Science, Reason, critic Wit, By giving them the Places which they fit Amongst the Ornaments of Life below, Which the most profligate as well may know,— One of the most abandon'd vicious Will, As one who, fearing God, escheweth Ill. Therefore, no Truths concerning this Divine And Heav'nly Life can come within the Line Of all this Learning, as exalted far Above the Pow'r of Trial at its Bar; Where both the Jury and the Judges too Are born with Eyes incapable to view. Living and moving in this World's Demesne, They have their Being in another Scene, The Life Divine no abler to descry Than into Heav'n can look an Eagle's Eye. If you, well-read in ancient Books, my Friend, To publish Homer's Iliad should intend Or Cæsar's Commentaries, and make out Some Things more plain,—you have the Skill no doubt, As well provided for the Work, perhaps, As one to make his Baskets, one his Traps. But if you think that Skill in ancient Greek And Latin helps you of itself to seek, Find and explain the Spirit and the Sense Of what Christ said, it is a vain Pretence And quite unnatural,—of equal Kind With the Endeavour of a Man born blind, Who talks about exhibiting the Sight Of diff'rent Colours, beautifully bright. Doctrines wherein Redemption is concern'd, No more belong to Men as being learn'd, Than Colours do to him who never saw The Light that gives to all of them the Law. From like unnatural Attempt proceeds That huge Variety of Sects and Creeds, Which from the same true Scripture can deduce What serves each diff'rent Error for its Use: Papist or Protestant, Socinian Class Or Arian, can as easily amass The Texts of Scripture and by Reason's Ray, One as another, urge the endless Fray; Retort Absurdities, whenever prest; Prove its own System, and confute the rest: Just as blind Men in their Disputes can do Each others' Notions of red, green, or blue. The Light of the celestial inward Man That died in Paradise, when Sin began, Is Jesus Christ; and, consequently, Men By Him alone can rise to Life again: He in the Heart of Man must sow the Seed That can awaken Heav'nly Life indeed; Nothing but this can possibly admit Return of Life, or in the least be fit Or capable, or sensible of Pow'r From Jesus Christ in His redeeming Hour. The Light and Life which He intends to raise, Have no Dependence upon Word and Phrase. Life in itself, be it of Heav'n or Earth, Must have its whole Procession from a Birth. Would it not sound absurdly in your Mind, That, if a Man be naturally blind, Care must be had to teach him Grammar well, Or in the Art of Logic to excel; That he will best obtain, when this is done, Knowledge of Light and Colours from the Sun? Yet not one Jot is it the less absurd To think that Skill in Greek or Hebrew Word, Of Man's Redemption can explain the Whole, Or let the Light of God into his Soul. This Matter, Academicus, if you Can set in a more proper Light,—pray do! A CONTRAST BETWEEN HUMAN REASON AND DIVINE ILLUMINATION, EXEMPLIFIED IN THREE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS. I An humble Christian, to whose inward Sight God shows the Truth, and then inspires to write, Because of deeper Certainties declar'd Than what the Mind perceives when unprepar'd,— From them who measure all on which he treats By the fix'd Standard of their own Conceits, Meets with Contempt; and very few will own The real Truths, which he has really shown.— II A sharp Philosopher, who thinks to find By his own Reason, his own Strength of Mind, Sublimer Things, that lie so far beyond The Scenes to which such Forces correspond,— From them who love to speculate like him, And think all Light but that of Reason dim, Meets with Admirers; tho' he reasons wrong And draws the Dupes, if plausible, along.— III Now, tho' a Searcher should no more despise The use of Reason than he should of Eyes; Yet, if there be a still superior Light Than Faculty of Reason has or Sight,— Which all Religion seems to pre-suppose That God on such as rightly seek bestows,— In higher Matters how should he decide Who takes his Reason only for his Guide? IV Such Words as Nature, Reason, Common Sense, Furnish all Writers with one same Pretence; Altho' in many an acknowledg'd Case They must fall short without Superior Grace; So that in Things of more momentous kind Nature itself directs us not to mind,— If Sacred Truth be heartily desir'd,— The greatest Reas'ners, but the most inspir'd. V Whence comes the Value for the Scripture Page, So justly due, so paid thro' ev'ry Age;— Not writ by Men of Learning and of Parts, But honest, humble and enlighten'd Hearts, Who, when they reason'd, reason'd very well; But how enabl'd, let their Writings tell? Not one of all, but who ascribes the Force Of Truth discover'd to an Higher Source! VI Take these three Men, so diff'rent in their Way, For Instance, Behmen, Bolingbroke and Hay. They all philosophise on Sacred Themes And build on Reason, the two last, their Schemes. The first affirms, that his Principia flow From what God's Spirit gave him Pow'r to know,— As much a promis'd as a certain Guide, With Christ's Disciples ever to abide. VII If Bolingbrokian Reason must prevail, All Inspiration is an idle Tale; Writers by that, from Moses down to Paul, I spare to mention how he treats them all. Now, if he err'd, whence did that Error spring? His Reason told him there was no such Thing,— Foundress, in her philosophising Cast, Of all his first Philosophy, and last. VIII Hay, better taught, and more ingenuous Spark, Gropes with his Reason betwixt Light and Dark; Now, gentle Glimmerings of Truth displays; Now, lost in Fancy's intricater Maze, A motley Mixture of such Things has got, As Reason could discover, and could not; Which all the Builders on its boasted Plan Prove to be just as manifold as Man. IX This Behmen knew, and in his humble Way Became enlighten'd by a steadier Ray; First, taught himself by what he heard and saw, Of Grace and Nature he explain'd the Law. That Sacred Spirit from which both arose, Taught him of both the Secrets to disclose To them, who, using Eyes and Reason too, Were fit for Truth in a Diviner View. X He does not write from Reason, nor appeals, Of course, to what that Faculty reveals. Yet, if the common Privilege be mine, Reason may see that Something more Divine Lies hid in what the Books of Behmen teach, Tho' it surpass its apprehensive Reach; May see from what it really apprehends That all mere Reas'ners Behmen far transcends. XI Fond of his Reason as a Man may be, He should confess its limited Degree, And by its fair Direction seek to find A surer Guide to Things of deeper Kind. The most sharp-sighted seek for other Men Who may have seen what lies beyond their Ken; And in religious Matters most Appeals Are made by Men to that which God reveals. XII How is it possible to judge aright Of Heav'nly Things but by an Heav'nly Light,— Contemn'd by Bolingbroke, by Hay confess'd, By Behmen, possibly at least, possess'd? Truly inspir'd, as pious Minds have thought, Jacob was known to live as he had taught, And at his last departing Moment cried, “Now I go hence to Paradise,”—and died. SOCRATES' REPLY CONCERNING HERACLITUS' WRITINGS. I When Socrates had read, as Authors note, A certain Book that Heraclitus wrote. Deep in its Matter and obscure beside, Ask'd his Opinion of it, he replied: “All that I understand is good and true, And what I don't is, I believe, so too.” II Thus answer'd Socrates, whom Greece confess'd The wisest of her Sages and the best, By Justice mov'd and Candour of a Piece With that Philosopher's Repute in Greece,— Worthy of Imitation, to be sure, When a good Writer is sometimes obscure. III All the haranguing, therefore, on the Theme Of deep Obscurity in Jacob Behme Is but itself obscure; for he might see Further, 'tis possible, than you or me. Meanwhile, the Goodness of his plainer Page Demands the Answer of the Grecian Sage. IV The “Stuff and Nonsense, Labyrinth and Maze, Madness, Enthusiasm,” and such-like Phrase, Its quick Bestowers are oblig'd to own, Ought not to move us by its eager Tone More than they ought in Reason to be mov'd, Should we so paint a Work which they approv'd. V He whom the fair Socratical Remark Describes, was call'd “?????????,” or “the dark.” Yet his wise Reader from the Good in View Thought that his darker Passages were true; He would not judge of what as yet lay hid, By what he did not see, but what he did. VI The Books of Behme, as none are tied to read, To blame unread they have as little need; As they who read them most, the most commend, Others at least may venture to suspend, Or think with ref'rence to such Books as these Of Heraclitus and of Socrates. THOUGHTS UPON HUMAN REASON, OCCASIONED BY READING SOME EXTRAVAGANT DECLAMATIONS IN ITS FAVOUR. I Yes, I have read them;—but I cannot find Much Depth of Sense in Writers of this Kind. They all retail, as they proceed along, Or superficial Sentiments or wrong; Of “Reason! Reason!” they repeat the Cries, And “Reason's Use,”—which Nobody denies. II All Sharers in it follow, I suppose, Each one his Reason, as he does his Nose, When he intends to reach a certain Spot, Whether he finds the Road to it, or not. With equal Sense a Postulatum begs The Use of Reason, as the Use of Legs. III Full well these rational Adepts declaim On Points at which their Reason can take Aim; But when they talk beyond them, what Mistakes Of various Kind their various Reason makes! All are for one same Rule, and in its Use All singly clear and mutually abstruse. IV What plainer Demonstration can be had, That their original Pretence is bad Who say, their own or human Reason's Light Must needs direct them to determine right? What greater Proof of a superior Skill Needful to Reas'ners, reason how they will? V Sense to discern and Reason to compare Are Gifts that merit our improving Care, But want an Inward Light, when all is done, As Seeds and Plants do that of outward Sun. Main Help neglected, tasteless Fruits arise, And Wisdom grows insipid in the Wise. VI Tho' all these Reason-Worshippers profess To guard against fanatical Excess, “Enthusiastic Heat”—their fav'rite Theme— Draws their Attention to the cold Extreme; Their Fears of torrid Fervors freeze a Soul; To shun the Zone they send it to the Pole. VII The very Sound of rational and plain Contents, where Sense is neither of the twain, A World of Readers, whose polite Concern Is to be learnèd without Pains to learn. To please their Palates with a modish Treat, Cheap is the Cost, and here is the Receipt: VIII “Let Reason, first, Imagination, Passions “Be clean drest-up in pretty-worded Fashions; “Then let Imagination, Passions, Reason “Change Places round at each commodious Season; “Till Reason, Passions and Imagination “Have prov'd the Point by their complete Rotation.” ON FAITH, REASON, AND SIGHT, CONSIDERED AS THE THREE DISTINCT MEDIUMS OF HUMAN PERCEPTION. I There is a threefold correspondent Light That shines to Faith, to Reason, and to Sight. The first, Eternal,—bringing into View Celestial Objects, if the Faith be true; The next, Internal,—which the reas'ning Mind Consults in Truths of an ideal Kind; The third, External,—and perceiv'd thereby All outward Objects that affect the Eye. II Each Light is good within its destin'd Sphere; Nor with each other do they interfere. Faith does not reason, Reason does not see, Nor Sight extend beyond a fixt Degree; Yet Faith in Light of a superior Kind Cannot be call'd irrational or blind; Because an Higher Certainty display'd Includes the Force of all inferior Aid. III As Body, Soul and Spirit make a Man, Each has the Help of its appointed Plan; Sight, Hearing, Smell, and Taste and feeling Sense What the corporeal Nature wants, dispense; Thinking, Comparing, Judging, and the whole Of reasoning Faculties, assist the Soul; Faith, and whatever else may be exprest By Grace Celestial, makes the Spirit blest. IV To heal Defect, or to avoid Excess, The Greater Light should still correct the less, And form within the right obedient Will A seeing, reas'ning and believing Skill; While Body moves as outward Sense directs, And Soul perceives what Reason's Light reflects, And Spirit, fill'd with Lustre from Above, Obeys by Faith and operates by Love. V A sober Person, tho' his Eyes are good, Slights not the Truths by Reason understood Nor just Conclusions, under the Pretence Of Contradiction to his seeing Sense. Knowing the Limits too that Reason hath, He does not seek to quench the Light of Faith; But rationally grants that It may teach What human Stretch of Reason cannot reach. VI As Sight to Reason in the Things that lie Beyond the Ken of the corporeal Eye Unhurt, uninjur'd, yields itself of course, So well-taught Reason owns a Higher Force. By Faith enlighten'd, it enjoys a Rest In clearer Light to find its own supprest,— Suff'ring no more, for want of its Display, Than Moon and Stars in full meridian Day. VII To make the reas'ning Faculty of Man Do more or less to help him than it can, Is equally absurd; but worse to slight Or want the Benefits of Faith than Sight. If he who sees no outward Light be blind, How dismal dark must be the faithless Mind! The one is only natural Defect; The other wilful, obstinate Neglect;— VIII Pretence of Reason. For it is Pretence Foolish and fatal in the saddest Sense; For Reason cannot alter what is true, Or any more prevent, than Eyes can do. Both by the Limits which they feel proclaim The real Want of a Celestial Flame;— How is it possible to see, in fine, The Things of God without a Light Divine? VERSES DESIGNED FOR AN INFIRMARY. I Dear loving Sirs, behold, as ye pass by, The poor sick People with a pitying Eye! Let Pains, and Wounds, and Suff'rings of each Kind, Raise up a just Compassion in your Mind; Indulge a gen'rous Grief at such a Sight, And then bestow your Talent or your Mite! II Thus to bestow is really to obtain The surest Blessing upon honest Gain; To help th' afflicted in so great a Need By your Supplies is to be rich indeed: The Good, the Pleasure, the Reward of Wealth Is to procure your Fellow-creatures Health. III In other Cases Men may form a Doubt, Whether their Alms be properly laid out; But in the Objects here before your Eyes No such Distrust can possibly arise; Too plain the Miseries, which well may melt An Heart sincerely wishing them unfelt. IV The Wise consider this terrestrial Ball As Heav'n's design'd Infirmary for all. Here came the Great Physician of the Soul, To heal Man's Nature, and to make him whole,— Still by His Spirit present with all those Who lend an Aid to lessen human Woes. V A Godlike Work! Who forwards it is sure That ev'ry Step advances his own Cure; Without Benevolence the View to Self Makes worldly Riches an unrighteous Pelf; While, blest thro' Life, the Giver for his Love Dies, to receive its huge Reward above. VI To them who tread the certain Path to Bliss, That leads thro' Scenes of Charity like this, Think what the Saviour of the World will say: “Ye blessèd of My Father, come your Way; “'Twas done to Me, if done to the distrest: “Come, ye true Friends, and be for ever blest!” PART II. A POETICAL VERSION OF A LETTER FROM THE EARL OF ESSEX TO THE EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON. My lord, Untaught by Nature or by Art To give the genuine Dictates of my Heart The Gloss of Compliment, I never less Than now should aim at that polite Excess,— Now, that my wand'ring Thoughts are fix'd upon Not Martha's many Things, but Mary's one. 'Tis not from any ceremonious View, But to discharge a real, needful Due From Friend to Friend in Absence, that I write To mine, secluded from his wonted Sight; By Force oblig'd to give, and to receive A long—perhaps, a last departing—Leave; For small, by ev'ry Test of human Ken, The Hopes of meeting in this World again. Under such Circumstances I recall My Friend, whose Honour, Person, Fortune, All, So dear to me, make Bosom-Wish to swell, That he may always prosper and do well, Where'er he goes, whate'er he takes in Hand, Under the Favour, Service, and Command Of His protecting Providence, from Whom All Happiness, if truly such, must come. My Friend's Abilities and present State Of natural Endowments how I rate,— To God what Glory, to himself what Use, The best Exertion of them might produce,— I shall not here express. Enough to note That, at such Times as I was most remote From all dissembling, Witnesses enow Can vouch my speaking what I thought was true! The Truths which Love now prompts me to remind Your Lordship of, are of the following Kind: First,—that whatever Talents you possess, They are God's Gifts, Whom you are bound to bless; Next,—that you have them, not as Things your own, Tho' for your Use, yet not for yours alone, But as an human Stewarty or Trust, Of which Account is to be giv'n, and just. So that, in fine, if Talents are applied To serve the Spirit of the World in Pride And vain Delights, as he who rules the Scenes Of guilty Joy, the Prince of Darkness, means,— It is Ingratitude, Injustice too, Yea, 'tis perfidious Treachery in you. For, if a Servant of your own should dare To use the Goods committed to his Care To the Advantage of your greatest Foe, What would you think of his behaving so? Yet how with God would you yourself do less, Having from Him whatever you possess, And serving with it, in the Donor's Stead, That Foe to Him by Whom the World is led? A serious Thought if you can ever lend To Admonition from your truest Friend; If the Regard due to your Country sways, Which you may serve so many glorious Ways; If an All-ruling, Righteous Pow'r above Can raise your Dread of Justice or your Love; If you yourself will to yourself be true, And everlasting Happiness pursue Before the Joys of any worldly Scheme, The short Delusions of a pleasing Dream; Of which, whatever it may represent, The Soul, soon wak'd, must bitterly repent; If these Reflections, any of them, find Due Estimation in your prudent Mind:— Take an Account of what is done and past, And what the Future may demand, forecast; The Leagues, whatever they import, repeal, To which good Conscience has not set the Seal; And fix your Resolution firm, to serve Him from Whose Will no loyal Thought can swerve,— That Gracious God from Whom in very Deed All your Abilities and Gifts proceed, Whether of bodily or mental Trace,— Without, within,—of Nature, or of Grace! Then He Who cannot possibly deny Himself, or give His Faithfulness the Lie, Will honour His true Servant, and impart That real Peace of Mind, that Joy of Heart, Of which until you are become possest, Your Heart, your Mind, shall never be at Rest; And when you are, by having well approv'd The one true Way, it never shall be mov'd. “This,” I foresee, your Lordship may object, “Is Melancholy's vaporous Effect;” That I am got into a Pris'ner's Style; Far enough from it all the jocund While That I was free like you, and other Men; And, Fetters gone, should be the same again. To which I answer: “Say it tho' you should, Yet cannot I distrust a God so Good; Or Mercy failing me, so greatly shown, Or Grace forsaking, but by Fault my own. So deeply bound to Him, my Heart so burns To make His Mercy suitable Returns, That, not to try, of all th' Apostate Class Worse should I be than any other was. I have with such repeated, solemn Stress, Avow'd the Penitence which I profess,— From time to Time so call'd on not a few To witness and to watch, if it was true, That of all Hypocrites, if found to lie, That e'er were born, the hollowest were I.” But should I perish in my Sins, and draw Upon myself my own Damnation's Law, Will it not be your Wisdom to embrace God's offer'd Mercy, of a Saving Grace,— To profit by Example, if you see The fearful Case of miserable Me? A longer Time was I a Slave to Sin And a corrupted World than you have been; Had many a too-too slowly-answer'd Call That made still harder my Return from Thrall. To come to Christ was requisite I knew; But softer Pace, I flatter'd me, would do. The Journey's End contented I remain'd To see and own, tho' still 'twas unattain'd. Therefore, the same Good Providence that call'd With a kind Violence, has pull'd and haul'd,— As public Eye may, outwardly at least, Have seen,—and dragg'd me to the Marriage-Feast. Kind, in this World, Affliction's heaviest Load, That, in another, Bliss might be bestow'd; Kind the repeated Stripes, that should correct Of too great Knowledge a too small Effect. God grant your Lordship may with less Alloy Feel an unfeign'd Conversion's inward Joy, As I do now; and find the Happy Way Without the Torments of so long Delay! To the Divines (and there were none beside That nam'd Conversion to me) I replied: “Could my Ambition enter, and possess Your narrow Hearts, your Meekness would be less; Were my Delights to which it gives the Rise Tasted by you, you would be less precise.” But you, my Lord, have the momentous Hint From one that knows the very utmost Stint Of all that can amuse you, whilst you live, Of all Contentments which the World can give. Think then, dear Earl, that I have stak'd and buoy'd The Ways of Pleasure, fatally enjoy'd, And set them up, as Marks at Sea, for you To keep true Virtue's Channel in your View; Think, tho' your Eyes should long be shut and fast, They must, they must, be open'd at the last! Truth will compel you to confess, like me, That to the wicked Peace can never be. With my own Soul, that Heav'n may deign to aid My Heart's Address, this Covenant is made: My Eyes shall never yield to Sleep at Night Nor Thoughts attend the Bus'ness of the Light, Till I have pray'd my God, that you may take This plain, but faithful Warning for my Sake With a believing Profit. Then, in you Your Friends, your Country will be happy too, And all your Aims succeed. Events so blest Would fill with Comfort not to be express'd Your Lordship's Cousin and true Friend,—so tied That worldly Cause can never once divide,— ESSEX. AN ITALIAN BISHOP. An Anecdote. There is no Kind of a fragmental Note That pleases better than an Anecdote Or Fact unpublish'd, when it comes to rise, And give the more agreeable Surprise. From long Oblivion sav'd, an useful Hint Is doubly grateful, when reviv'd in Print. A late and striking Instance of this Kind Delighted many an attentive Mind; This Anecdote my Task is to rehearse, As highly fit to be consign'd to Verse. There liv'd a Bishop, once upon a Time,— Where, is not said, but Italy the Clime,— An honest, pious Man, who understood How to behave as a true Bishop should; But thro' an Opposition, form'd to blast His good Designs by Men of diff'rent Cast, He had some tedious Struggles and a Train Of rude Affronts and Insults to sustain,— And did sustain; with calm, unruffled Mind He bore them all, and never once repin'd. An intimate Acquaintance, one who knew What Difficulties he had waded thro' Time after Time, and very much admir'd A Patience so provok'd and so untir'd, Made bold to ask him, if he could impart Or teach the Secret of his happy Art. “Yes,” said the good old Prelate, “that I can; And 'tis a plain and practicable Plan. For all the Secret that I know of, lies In making a right Use of my own Eyes.” Begg'd to explain himself, how that should be, “Why, in whatever State I am,” said he, “I first look up to Heav'n, as well aware, That to get thither is my main Affair. I then look down upon the Earth and think, In a short space of Time how small a Chink I shall possess of its extensive Ground; And then I cast my seeing Eyes around, Where more Distress appears on ev'ry Side Amongst Mankind than I myself abide. So that, reflecting on my own Concern, First,—where true Happiness is plac'd, I learn; Next,—let the World to what it will pretend, I see where all its Good and Ill must end; Last,—how unjust it is, as well as vain, Upon a fair Discernment, to complain. Thus, looking up and down and round about, Right use of Eyes may find my Secret out: ‘With Heav'n in view,—his real Home, in fine,— Nothing on Earth should make a Man repine.’” ON RESIGNATION. To a Friend in Trouble. Dear Child, know this, that He Who gave thee Breath, Almighty God, is Lord of Life and Death, And all Things that concern them, such as these,— Youth, Health, or Strength; Age, Weakness, or Disease! Wherefore, whatever thy Affliction be, Take it as coming from thy God to thee! Whether to teach thee Patience be its End; Or to instruct such Persons as attend, That Faith and Meekness, tried by Suff'rings past, May yield Increase of Happiness at last; Or whether it be sent for some Defect, Which He, who wants to bless thee, would correct,— Certain it is, that if thou dost repent, And take thy Cross up patiently, when sent, Trusting in Him Who sends it thee, to take For Jesus Christ His Son, thy Saviour's, Sake, Wholly submitting to His blessed Will, Whose Visitation seeks thy Profit still,— All that thou dost, or ever canst endure, Will make thy everlasting Joy more sure! Take therefore what befalls thee in good Part, As a Prescription of Love's Healing Art! “Whom the Lord loveth He chastiseth too,” Saith Paul, “and scourgeth with a Saving View.” It is the Mark by which He owns a Child, Without it not so honourably styl'd. Fathers according to the Flesh, when they Correct them, Children rev'rence and obey; How much more justly may That Father claim, By Whom we live eternally, the same! They oft chastise thro' Humour of their own, He always for our greater Good alone,— Chast'ning below, that we may rise above, Holy and happy in our Father's Love. These Things, for Comfort and Instruction fit, In Holy Scripture for our Sakes are writ, That with a patient and enduring Mind In all Conditions we may be resign'd; And, rev'rencing our Father and our Friend, Take what His Goodness shall be pleas'd to send. What greater Good, considering the Whole, Than Christ's Own Likeness in a Christian Soul By patient Suff'ring? Think what Ills, before He enter'd into Joy, our Saviour bore; What Things He suffer'd to retrieve our Loss, And make His Way to Glory thro' the Cross The Way for us; He wanted none to make But for the poor lost human Sinner's Sake; For them He suffer'd more than Words can tell, Or Thought conceive. Reflect upon it well, Dear Child, and whether Life or Death remains, Depend on Him to sanctify thy Pains; To be Himself thy strong Defence, and Tow'r; To make thee know and feel His saving Pow'r! Still taught by Him repeat, “Thy Will be done” And trust in God thro' His Belovèd Son. A POETICAL VERSION OF A LETTER FROM JACOB BEHMEN TO A FRIEND, ON THE SAME OCCASION. I Dear Brother in our Saviour Christ! His Grace And Love premis'd in your afflictive Case, I have consider'd of it and have brought The Whole with Christian sympathetic Thought Before the Will of the Most High, to see What it would please Him to make known to me; II And, thereupon, I give you, Sir, to know, What a true Insight He was pleas'd to show Into the Cause and Cure of all your Grief And present Trial; which I shall in brief Set down for a Memorial, and declare For you to ponder with a serious Care. III First, then, the Cause to which we must assign Your strong Temptation, is the Love Divine, The Goodness Supernatural, above All Utt'rance, flowing from the God of Love,— Seeking the creaturely and human Will, To free it from Captivity to Ill. IV And, then, the Struggle with so Great a Grace In human Will, refusing to embrace, Tho' tender'd to it with a Love so pure,— It seeks itself and strives against a Cure. From his own Love to transitory Things, More than to God, the real Evil springs. V 'Tis Man's own Nature, which in its own Life, Or Centre, stands in Enmity and Strife, And anxious, selfish, doing what it lists, (Without God's Love) that tempts him, and resists; The Devil also shoots his fiery Dart, From Grace and Love to turn away the Heart. VI This is the greatest Trial; 'tis the Fight Which Christ, with His internal Love and Light. Maintains within Man's Nature, to dispel God's Anger, Satan, Sin, and Death, and Hell; The human Self, or Serpent, to devour, And raise an Angel from it by His Pow'r. VII Now if God's Love in Christ did not subdue In some Degree this Selfishness in you, You would have no such Combat to endure; The Serpent, then, triumphantly secure, Would unoppos'd exert its native Right, And no such Conflict in your Soul excite. VIII For all the huge Temptation and Distress Rises in Nature, tho' God seeks to bless; The Serpent feeling its tormenting State, (Which of itself is a mere anxious Hate,) When God's amazing Love comes in, to fill And change the selfish to a God-like Will. IX Here Christ, the Serpent-bruiser, stands in Man, Storming the Devil's hellish, self-built Plan; And hence the Strife within the human Soul,— Satan's to kill, and Christ's to make it whole; As by Experience, in so great Degree, God in His Goodness causes you to see. X Now, while the Serpent's Head is bruis'd, the Heel Of Christ is stung, and the poor Soul must feel Trembling and Sadness, while the Strivers cope, And can do nothing but stand still in Hope; Hardly be able to lift up its Face, For mere Concern, and pray to God for Grace. XI The Serpent, turning it another Way, Shows it the World's alluring, fine Display; Mocking its Resolution to forego, For a new Nature, the engaging Show; And represents the taking its Delight In present Scenes as natural and right. XII Thus, in the Wilderness with Christ alone, The Soul endures Temptation of its own; While all the Glories of this World display'd, Pleasures and Pomps, surround it, and persuade Not to remain so humble and so still, But elevate itself in own Self-will. XIII The next Temptation, which befalls of Course From Satan and from Nature's selfish Force, Is, when the Soul has tasted of the Love And been illuminated from Above; Still in its Self-hood it would seek to shine, And as its own possess the Light Divine. XIV That is, the soulish Nature,—take it right, As much a Serpent, if without God's Light, As Lucifer,—this Nature still would claim For own Propriety the Heav'nly Flame, And elevate its Fire to a Degree Above the Light's Good Pow'r, which cannot be. XV This domineering Self, this Nature-Fire, Must be transmuted to a Love-Desire. Now, when this Change is to be undergone, It looks for some own Pow'r, and, finding none, Begins to doubt of Grace, unwilling quite To yield up its self-willing Nature's Right. XVI It ever quakes for Fear, and will not die In Light Divine, tho' to be blest thereby: The Light of Grace it thinks to be Deceit, Because it worketh gently without Heat; Mov'd too by outward Reason, which is blind, And of itself sees nothing of this Kind. XVII Who knows, it thinketh, whether it be true That God is in thee, and enlightens too? Is it not Fancy? For thou dost not see Like other People, who as well as thee Hope for Salvation by the Grace of God, Without such Fear and Trembling at his Rod. XVIII Thus the poor Soul, accounted for a Fool By all the Reas'ners of a gayer School, By all the graver People who embrace Mere verbal Promises of future Grace, Sighs from its deep internal Ground, and pants For such enlight'ning Comfort as it wants; XIX And fain would have,—but Nature can, alas! Do Nothing of itself to bring to pass,— And is thro' its own Impotence afraid That God rejects it, and will give no Aid; Which with regard to the Self-will is true; For God rejects it, to implant a new. XX The own Self-will must die away and shine, Rising thro' Death, in Saving Will Divine; And from the Opposition which it tries Against God's Will such great Temptations rise; The Devil too is loth to lose his Prey, And see his Fort cast down, if it obey. XXI For, if the Life of Christ within arise, Self-Lust and false Imagination dies,— Wholly, it cannot in this present Life, But by the Flesh maintains the daily Strife,— Dies, and yet lives; as they alone can tell In whom Christ fights against the Pow'rs of Hell. XXII The third Temptation is in Mind and Will, And Flesh and Blood, if Satan enter still; Where the false Centres lie in Man, the Springs Of Pride and Lust, and Love of earthly Things, And all the Curses wish'd by other Men, Which are occasion'd by this Devil's Den. XXIII These in the Astral Spirit make a Fort, Which all the Sins concentre to support; And human Will, esteeming for its Joy What Christ, to save it, combats to destroy, Will not resign the Pride-erected Tow'r, Nor live obedient to the Saviour's Pow'r. XXIV Thus I have giv'n you, loving Sir, to know What our Dear Saviour has been pleas'd to show To my Consideration. Now, on This Examine well what your Temptation is! We must “leave all, and follow Him,” He said, Right Christ-like poor, like our Redeeming Head. XXV Now, if Self-Lust stick yet upon your Mind, Or Love of earthly Things of any Kind, Then, from those Centres in their working Force Such a Temptation will rise up of Course. If you will follow, when it does arise, My Child-like Counsel, hear what I advise! XXVI Fix your whole Thought upon the bitter Woe Which our Dear Lord was pleas'd to undergo; Consider the Reproach, Contempt, and Scorn, The worldly State so poor and so forlorn, Which He was so content to bear; and then, His suff'ring, dying for us sinful Men. XXVII And thereunto give up your whole Desire And Mind, and Will, and earnestly aspire To be as like Him as you can; to bear (And with a Patience bent to persevere) All that is laid upon you, and to make His Process yours, and purely for His Sake; XXVIII For Love of Him, most freely to embrace Contempt, Affliction, Poverty, Disgrace,— All that may happen, so you may but gain His Blessèd Love within you, and maintain; No longer willing with a Self-desire, But such as Christ within you shall inspire! XXIX Dear Sir, I fear lest something still amiss, Averse to Him, cause such a Strife as this. He wills you, in His Death, with Him to die To your own Will, and to arise thereby In His Arising, and that Life to live Which He is striving in your Soul to give. XXX Let go all earthly Will, and be resign'd Wholly to Him with all your Heart and Mind! Be Joy or Sorrow, Comfort or Distress, Receiv'd alike, for He alike can bless, To gain the Victory of Christian Faith Over the World and all Satanic Wrath! XXXI So shall you conquer Death and Hell and Sin, And find, at last, what Christ in you hath been. By sure Experience will be understood How all hath happen'd to you for your Good. Of all His Children this hath been the Way; And Christian Love here dictates what I say. ON RESIGNATION. A Fragment. I O happy Resignation That rises by its fall; That seeks no exaltation But wins by losing all; II That conquers by complying, Triúmphing in its lot; That lives when it's a-dying, And is when it is not! ON BEARING THE CROSS. A Dialogue. I Take up the Cross which thou has got, For Love of Christ, and bear it not As Simon of Cyrene did, Compell'd to do as he was bid! II “Pray, am not I, who cannot free “Myself, compell'd as much as he? “I cannot shun it, and of Course “Must bear this heavy Cross by Force.” III What dost thou get then by Disgust At bearing that which bear thou must? Nothing abates the Force of Ill Like a resign'd and patient Will. IV “'Tis true; but how shall I obtain “Such an Abatement of my Pain? “Compulsion tempts me to repine “At Simon's Case becoming mine.” V Look then at Jesus gone before; Reflect on what thy Saviour bore,— Bore, tho' He could have been set free: Death on the Cross, for Love of Thee! VI “He did so.—Lord, what shall I say? Do Thou enable me to pray, If 'tis not possible to shun This bitter Cross, ‘Thy Will be done!’” A SOLILOQUY ON THE CAUSE AND CONSEQUENCES OF A DOUBTING MIND. I I muse, I doubt, I reason, and debate;— Therefore, I am not in that perfect State In which, when its Creation first began, God plac'd His Own Belovèd Image, Man; From whose high Birth, at once design'd for all, This ever-poring Reason proves a Fall. II Whilst Adam stood in that immortal Life, Wherein pure Truth excluded Doubt and Strife, He knew, he saw, by a Diviner Light, All that was good for Knowledge or for Sight. But when the Serpent-Subtlety of Hell Brought him to doubt, and reason,—then he fell. III Fell,—by declining from an upright Will, And sunk into a State of Good and Ill. The very State of such a World as this Became a Death to his immortal Bliss,— Bliss, which his Reason gave him not before The Loss ensued, nor after could restore. IV From him desending, all the human Race Must needs partake the Nature of his Case; Just as the Trunk, the Branches, or the Fruit, Derive their Substance from the parent Root. What Life or Death into the Father came, The Sons, tho' guiltless, could but have the same. V If I am one, if ever I must live The blissful Life which God design'd to give, As Reason dictates, or as some Degree Of higher Light enables one to see,— It cannot rise from being born on Earth Without a second, new, and Heav'nly Birth. VI The Gospel-Doctrine, which assures to Men The joyful Truth of being “born again,” Demands the free Consent of ev'ry Will That seeks the Good, and to escape the Ill; In all the sav'd right Reason must allow Such Birth effected, tho' it knows not how. VII Such was the Faith in Life's Redeeming Seed, Of poor fall'n Man the Comfort and the Creed; Such was the Hope before and since the Flood, In ev'ry Time and Place, of all the good; Till the new Birth of Jesus from above Reveal'd below the Mystery of Love. VIII His Virgin Birth, Life, Death and Re-ascent Explain what all God's Dispensations meant. God give me Grace to shun the doubting Crime, Since nothing follows intermediate Time But Life or Death, eternally to rule A blessèd Christian, or a cursèd Fool! A PLAIN ACCOUNT OF THE NATURE AND DESIGN OF TRUE RELIGION. I “What is Religion?”—Why, it is a Cure Giv'n in the Gospel gratis to the Poor By Jesus Christ, the Healer of the Soul; Which all who take are sure to be made whole; And they who will not, all the Art of Man May strive to cure them, but it never can. II “Care for what Malady?”—For that of Sin, From whence all other Maladies begin. It had its Rise in Adam first of all; And all his Sons, partaking of his Fall, Want a new Adam to beget them free From Sin and Death; and Jesus Christ is He. III “How it is giv'n?”—By raising a new Birth Of Heav'nly Life, surviving that of Earth; Which may at any Time,—at some it must,— Return its mortal Body to the Dust; And then the Born of God in Christ again Will rise immortal, true angelic Men. IV “Why in the Gospel?”—Gospel is, indeed, In its true living Sense, the Holy Seed, By God's great Mercy first in Adam sown, And first in Christ to full Perfection grown,— Fulness, from which all holy Souls derive, And Bodies too, the Pow'r to be alive. V “Why gratis giv'n?”—Because the Love-desire Of God, in Christ, can never work for Hire. Its Nature is to love for Loving's Sake, To give itself to ev'ry Will to take; To them it brings amidst the darkest Night Its Life and Immortality to Light. VI “Why to the Poor?”—Because they feel their Want, Which Trust in Riches is so loth to grant. The Rich have something which they call their own; The Poor have nothing, but to Christ alone They owe Themselves, and pay Him what they owe, And what Religion is They only know. ON THE TRUE MEANING OF THE SCRIPTURE TERMS “LIFE” AND “DEATH,” WHEN APPLIED TO MEN. I True Life, according to the Scripture Plan, Is God's Own Likeness in His Image, Man. This was the Life that Adam ceas'd to live, Or lost by Sin, and therefore could not give; So that his Offspring, all the born on Earth, Want a New Parent of this Heav'nly Birth. II This, Christ alone, God's Image Most Express, The Second Adam, gives them to possess,— Becoming Man, reversing human Fall, And raising up the First, True Life in all; Healing our Nature's deadly Wound within, And quenching Wrath, or Death, or Hell, or Sin. III For all such Words describe one evil Thing, Or Want of Good, that has one only Spring,— The Love of God in Christ, which form'd at first A blessèd Adam and redeem'd a curst By his own Act; Good only was design'd For Adam, and in him for all Mankind. IV He fell from Good, misusing his free Will, Into this World, this Life of Good and Ill; From whence the willing to be sav'd revive, Thro' Faith and Penitence in Christ alive. A second Death succeeds, if they refuse; For choosing Creatures must have what they choose. V For bare Existence, when we go from hence, Is Immortality in Scripture Sense; For thus alike immortal are confest The good, the bad,—the ruin'd and the blest; Whose inbred Tempers hint the Reason why They live for ever, or for ever die. VI God's Likeness, Light and Spirit in the Soul Make, as at first, its blest, immortal Whole. 'Tis Death to want them. Vain is all Dispute; The Gospel only reaches to the Root. All the inspir'd have understood it thus: “Immortal Life is that of Christ in Us.” ON THE GROUND OF TRUE AND FALSE RELIGION. I Explain Religion by a thousand Schemes, Still God and Self will be the two Extremes! In Him the one true Good of it is found; In Self, of all Idolatry the Ground. False Worship, paid at all its various Shrines, One same Departure from His Love defines. II By Love to Him blest Angels kept their State; Which the Apostate lost by cursèd Hate; Setting up Self in the Almighty's Room, It sunk them down into its dreadful Gloom. On Separation from His Love, the Source Of all Felicity was lost, of Course. III By Love to Him the first created Man Was highly blest till Selfishness began Thro' Serpentine Delusion to arise, And tempt above God's Wisdom to be wise. When he had chosen to prefer his own, The naked, miserable Self was known. IV Hence we inherit such a Life as this, Dead of itself to Paradisic Bliss; Hence, all our Hopes of a Diviner Birth Depend on Christ and His Descent on Earth; Subduing Self, as Adam should have done, And loving God thro' His Belovèd Son;— V The Mediator betwixt God and Men, Who brings their Nature back to Him again, Sav'd from all sinful Self, or deadly Wrath, Or hellish Evil, by the Pow'r of Faith Working by Love, of which It is the Strength, And must attain the Full, True Life at Length. VI Born of this Holy Virgin-Seed Divine To a new Life within this mortal Shrine, The faithful breathe a Spirit from above, And make of Self a Sacrifice to Love. By Christ redeem'd, they rise from Adam's Fall, From Earth to Heav'n, where God is All in All. ON THE CAUSE, CONSEQUENCE AND CURE OF SPIRITUAL PRIDE. I Suppose an Heater burning in the Fire To be alive, to will and to desire, To reason, feel and have upon the whole What we will call “an understanding Soul,”— Conscious of pow'rful Heat within its Mould, And Colour bright above the burnish'd Gold! II Suppose that Pride should catch this Heater's Heart, And from the Fire pursuade it to depart; To show itself, and make it to be known That it can raise a Splendour of its own,— An own rich Colour, an own potent Heat, Without Dependence on the Fire complete! III It leaves, in Prospect of so fine a Show, The fiery Bosom where it learnt to glow; Cools by Degrees, till all its golden Hue Is vanish'd, and its Pow'r of heating too. Its own, once hidden, Nature domineers, And the dark, cold, self-iron Lump appears. IV Transfer this feign'd, imaginary Pride To that which really does too oft betide, When human Souls, endued with Grace Divine, Become ambitious of themselves to shine, And, proud of Qualities which Grace bestows, Forsake Its Bosom for self-shining Shows; V And thence conceive the natural Effects Of Pride in either single Men or Sects, That for Variety of selfish Strife Forsake the One, True Cause of all true Life,— The Heav'nly Spirit-fire of Love, within Whose Sacred Bosom all their Gifts begin; VI From which, if Reason, Learning, Wit, or Parts, Tempt their Ambition to withdraw their Hearts, There must ensue, whatever they may mean, The Disappearance of the glowing Scene, From the most gifted vanishing of Course, When dis-united from its Real Source! VII As only Fire can possibly restore The Heater's Force to what it was before; So That of Love alone consumes the Dross Of wrathful Nature, and repairs its Loss; It will again unite with all Desire, That casts itself into the Holy Fire. THE BEGGAR AND THE DIVINE. In some good Books one reads of a Divine Whose memorable Case deserves a Line; Who, to serve God the best and shortest Way, Pray'd for eight Years together every Day, That in the Midst of Doctrines and of Rules, However taught and practis'd by the Schools, He would be pleas'd to bring him to a Man Prepar'd to teach him the compendious Plan. He was himself a Doctor, and well-read In all the Points to which Divines were bred. Nevertheless, he thought, that what concern'd The most illiterate as well as learn'd To know and practise, must be something still More independent on such kind of Skill; True Christian Worship had within its Root Some simpler Secret, clear of all Dispute; Which, by a living Proof that he might know, He pray'd for some Practitioner to show. One Day, possess'd with an intense Concern About the Lesson which he sought to learn, He heard a Voice that sounded in his Ears: “Thou has been praying for a Man eight Years; Go to the Porch of yonder Church, and find A Man prepar'd according to thy Mind.” Away he went to the appointed Ground; When at the Entrance of the Church he found A poor old Beggar, with his Feet full sore And not worth Two-pence all the Clothes he wore. Surpris'd to see an Object so forlorn, ‘My Friend,’ said he, ‘I wish thee a good Morn.’ “Thank thee,” replied the Beggar, “but a bad I don't remember that I ever had.” ‘Sure, he mistakes,’ the Doctor thought, ‘the Phrase; Good Fortune, Friend, befall thee all thy Days!’ “Me, said the Beggar, many Days befall, But none of them unfortunate at all.” ‘God bless thee; answer plainly, I request.’ “Why, plainly then, I never was unblest.” ‘Never? Thou speakest in a mystic Strain, Which more at large I wish thee to explain.’— “With all my Heart.—Thou first did condescend To wish me kindly a good Morning, Friend; And I replied, that I remember'd not A bad one ever to have been my Lot. For, let the Morning turn out how it will, I praise my God for ev'ry new one still. If I am pinch'd with Hunger or with Cold, It does not make me to let go my Hold. Still I praise God; Hail, Rain, or Snow, I take This blessèd Cordial, which has Pow'r to make The foulest Morning to my Thinking fair; For Cold and Hunger yield to Praise and Pray'r. Men pity me as wretched, or despise; But whilst I hold this noble Exercise, It cheers my Heart to such a due Degree, That ev'ry Morning is still good to me. “Thou didst, moreover, wish me lucky Days, And I, by reason of continual Praise, Said that I had none else; for, come what would On any Day, I knew it must be good, Because God sent it; Sweet or Bitter, Joy Or Grief, by this Angelical Employ Of praising Him my Heart was at its Rest, And took whatever happen'd for the best; So that my own Experience might say, It never knew of an unlucky Day. “Then didst thou pray, ‘God bless thee,’ and I said I never was unblest. For, being led By the Good Spirit of Imparted Grace To praise His Name, and ever to embrace His Righteous Will, regarding That Alone With total Resignation of my own, I never could in such a State as this Complain for want of Happiness or Bliss,— Resolv'd in all Things that the Will Divine, The Source of all true Blessing, should be mine.” The Doctor, learning from the Beggar's Case Such wond'rous Instance of the Pow'r of Grace, Propos'd a Question, with Intent to try The happy Mendicant's direct Reply: ‘What wouldst thou say,’ said he, ‘should God think fit To cast thee down to the infernal Pit?’ “He cast me down? He send me into Hell? No! He loves me, and I love Him too well. But put the Case He should, I have two Arms That will defend me from all hellish Harms,— The one, Humility; the other, Love. These I would throw below Him, and above; One under His Humanity I'd place, His Deity the other should embrace; With both together so to hold Him fast, That I should go wherever He would cast;— And then, whatever thou shalt call the Sphere,— Hell, if thou wilt,—'tis Heav'n if He be there.” Thus was a great Divine, whom some have thought To be the justly-fam'd Taulerus, taught The Holy Art,—for which he us'd to pray; That to serve God the most compendious Way Was to hold fast a loving, humble Mind, Still praising Him and to His Will resign'd. FRAGMENT OF AN HYMN ON THE GOODNESS OF GOD. I O goodness of God, more exceedingly great Than Thought can conceive, or than Words can repeat! Whatsoever we fix our Conceptions upon, It has some Kind of Bounds, but Thy Goodness has none. As It never began, so It never can end, But to all Thy Creation will always extend; All Nature partakes of its proper Degree, But the Self-blinded Will that refuses to see. II Whensoever new Forms of Creation began, Thy Goodness adjusted the Beautiful Plan; Adjusted the Beauties of Body and Soul, And plac'd in the Centre the Good of the whole, That shone like a Sun the Circumference round, To produce all the Fruits of Beatified Ground; To display in each possible Shape and Degree A Goodness Eternal, Essential to Thee. III Blest Orders of Angels surrounded thy Throne, Before any Evil was heard of or known; Till a Self-seeking Chief's unaccountable Pride Thine Immutable Rectitude falsely belied; And, despising the Goodness that made him so bright, Would become independent and be his own Light, And induc'd all his Host to so monstrous a Thing As to act against Nature's Omnipotent King. IV Then did Evil begin, or the Absence of Good, Which from Thee could not come,—from a Creature it could, Who, made in thy Likeness, all happy and free, Could only be good as an Image of Thee. When an Angel profan'd his angelical Trust, And departed from Order, most Righteous and Just, Self-depriv'd of the Light, that proceeds from Thy Throne, He fell to the Darkness, by Nature his own. V For Nature itself is a Darkness express, If a Splendour from Thee does not fill it and bless,— An Abyss of the Pow'rs of all creaturely Life, Which are in themselves but an impotent Strife Of Action, Re-action and Whirling around, Till the Rays of Thy Light pierce the jarring Profound; Till Thy Goodness compose the dark, natural Storm, And enkindle the Bliss of Light, Order, and Form. VI Thy Unchangeable Goodness, when Wrath was begun, Soon as e'er It beheld what an Angel had done, Exerted Itself in restoring anew A Celestial Abode and Inhabitants too; Made a temporal World in the desolate Place, And Thy Likeness, a Man, to produce a new Race; That the Evil brought forth might in Time be supprest, And a new Host of Creatures succeed to be blest. VII When the Man, whom Thy Counsel design'd to have stood, Fell into this Mixture of Evil and Good, And, against Thy Kind Warning, consented to taste Of the Fruit that would lay his own Paradise waste: Thy Mercy then sought his Redemption from Sin, And implanted the Hope of a Saviour within,— Of a Man to be born, in the Fulness of Time, To supply his Defect and abolish his Crime. VIII All the Hopes of good Men, since the Ruin began, Were deriv'd from the Grace of This Wonderful Man. His Life, in the Promise, has secretly wrought Its Intended Effect in their penitent Thought, Who believ'd in Thy Word, in whatever Degree They knew, or knew not, how His coming would be. A true Faith in a Saviour was one and the same, Both before His Blest Coming, as after He came. IX Patriarchal, Mosaic, prophetical Views, The Desire of all Nations, or Gentiles or Jews, Who obey'd in the midst of their natural Fall The Degree of His Light Which enlighten'd them all, Still centred in Him, the Messiah, the Man Who should execute fully Thy Merciful Plan; And impart the True Life, which Thy Goodness design'd By creating a Man to descend to Mankind. X When This Son of Thy Love was Incarnate on Earth, And the Word was made Flesh by a Virginal Birth, The Angelical Host usher'd in the great Morn, With the Tidings of Joy that a Saviour was born,— Of Joy to all People who round the whole Ball Should partake of the Goodness That came to save all; To erect, upon Earth, a true Kingdom of Grace, And of Glory to come, for whoe'er would embrace. UNIVERSAL GOOD THE OBJECT OF THE DIVINE WILL, AND EVIL THE NECESSARY EFFECT OF THE CREATURE'S OPPOSITION TO IT. I The God of Love, delighting to bestow, Sends down His Blessing to the World below; A grateful Mind receives it, and above Sends up Thanksgiving to the God of Love. This happy Intercourse could never fail, Did not a false, perverted Will prevail. II For Love Divine, as rightly understood, Is an Unalterable Will to Good,— Good in the Object of His Blessèd Will, Who never can concur to real Ill; Much less “decree, predestinate, ordain,”— Words oft employ'd to take His Name in vain. III “But He permits it to be done,” say you;— Plain, then, I answer, that He does not do; That, having will'd created Angels free, He still permits or wills them so to be. Were his Permission ask'd before they did An evil Action, He would soon forbid. IV Before the Doing He forbids indeed, But disobedient Creatures take no heed. If He, according to your present Plea, Withdraws his Grace, and so they disobey, The Fault is laid on Him, not them at all; For who can stand whom He shall thus let fall? V Our own Neglect must be the previous Cause, When it is said, “the Grace of God withdraws;”— In the same Sense as when the brightest Dawn, If we will shut our Windows, is withdrawn; Not that the Sun is ever the less bright, But that our Choice is not to see the Light. VI Free to receive the Grace, or to reject, Receivers only can be God's elect; Rejecters of it reprobate alone Not by Divine Decree, but by their own. His Love to all, His Willing none to sin, Is a Decree that never could begin. VII It is the Order, the Eternal Law, The True Free Grace, that never can withdraw. Observance of it will of course be blest, And Opposition to it self-distrest; “To them who love its gracious Author, all Will work for Good,” according to St. Paul. VIII An easy Key to each abstruser Text That modern Disputants have so perplext With arbitrary Fancies on each Side, From God's Pure Love or Man's Freewill denied; Which in the Breast of Saints, and Sinners too, May both be found self-evidently true! ON THE DISINTERESTED LOVE OF GOD. I The Love of God with Genuine Ray Inflamed the Breast of good Cambray, And banish'd from the Prelate's Mind All Thoughts of interested Kind. He saw, and Writers of his Class (Of too neglected Worth, alas!) Disinterested Love to be The Gospel's very A. B. C. II When our Redeeming Lord began To practise It Himself as Man, And for the Joy then set before His Loving View such Evils bore, Endur'd the Cross, despis'd the shame,— Had He an interested Aim? Surely the least Examination Shows that the Joy was our Salvation. III For us He suffer'd, to make known The Love That seeketh not Its Own,— Suffer'd what nothing but so Pure A Love could possibly endure. No less a Sacrifice than this Could bring poor Sinners back to Bliss, Or execute the Saving Plan Of reuniting God and Man. IV This Love was Abram's Shield and Guard, Was his exceeding great Reward; This Love the patriarchal Eye And that of Moses could descry; In this disinterested Sense They sought Reward or Recompense, City or Country, Heav'n Above, The Seat of Purity and Love. V This the High Calling, this the Prize, The Mark of Paul's so steady Eyes; For, with the self-forgetting Paul, Pure Love of God in Christ was all. The Text of the belovèd John Has all, that Words can say, in one; For “God is Love,”—compendious Whole Of all the Blessings of a Soul! VI What Helps to this a Soul may want, Pure Love is ready still to grant, But with a View to wean it still From selfish, mercenary Will. Of all Reward, all Punishment, This is the End in God's Intent: To form in Offsprings of His Own The Bliss of loving His Alone. VII Sole Rule of all Affection due Both to ourselves and others too; Meaning of ev'ry Scripture Text, By interested Love perplext; Promise or Precept, Gospel Call Or legal Love, fulfils them all,— From Base arising up to Spire, Superior both to Fear and Hire. VIII Love of Disinterested Kind,— The Man who thinks It too refin'd May by ambiguous Language still Persist in metaphysic Skill. Even the justly-fam'd Cambray In such a Case could only pray, That Love Itself would only dart Some feeling Proof into his Heart. ON THE SAME SUBJECT. I I love my God, and freely too, With the Same Love that He imparts,— That He to Whom all Love is due Engraves upon pure, loving Hearts. II I love; but this Celestial Fire, Ye starry Pow'rs, Ye do not raise; No Wages, no Reward's Desire, Is in the purely shining Blaze. III Me nor the Hopes of heav'nly Bliss Or Paradisic Scenes excite; Nor Terrors of the dark Abyss,— Of Death's eternal Den,—affright. IV No bought and paid-for Love be mine; I will have no Demands to make; Disinterested and Divine Alone that Fear shall never shake. V Thou, my Redeemer from Above, Suff'ring to such immense Degree, Thy Heart has kindled mine to Love, That burns for Nothing but for Thee; VI Thy Scourge, Thy Thorns, Thy Cross, Thy Wounds— And ev'ry one of them a Source From whence the Nourishment abounds Of Endless Love's Unfading Force. VII These Sacred Fires with Holy Breath Raise in my Mind the gen'rous Strife; While, by the Ensigns of Thy Death Known, I adore the Lord of Life. VIII Extinguish all Celestial Light, The Fire of Love will not go out; The Flames of Hell extinguish quite, Love will pursue Its wonted Route! IX Be there no Hope, if It persist, Persist It will, nor ever cease; No Punishment, if 'tis dismissed, What caus'd It not will not decrease. X Should'st Thou give Nothing for Its Pains, It claims not anything as due; Should'st Thou condemn me, it remains Unchang'd by any selfish View. XI Let Heav'n be darken'd, if It will,— Let Hell with all its Vengeance roar,— My God Alone remaining, still I'll love Him, as I did before. ON THE MEANING OF THE WORD “WRATH,” AS APPLIED TO GOD IN SCRIPTURE. I That “God is Love,” is in the Scripture said; That He is Wrath, is nowhere to be read; From which by literal Expression free “Fury,” He saith Himself, “is not in me.” If Scripture, therefore, must direct our Faith, Love must be He or in Him, and not Wrath. II And yet the Wrath of God in Scripture Phrase Is oft express'd, and many diff'rent Ways: His “Anger,” “Fury,” “Vengeance,” are the Terms Which the plain Letter of the Text affirms; And plain, from two of the Apostle's Quire, That “God is Love,”—and “a consuming Fire.” III If we consult the Reasons that appear To make the seeming Difficulty clear, We must acknowledge, when we look Above, That God, as God, is Overflowing Love; And wilful Sinners, when we look below, Make what is call'd the Wrath of God to flow. IV “Wrath,” as St. Paul saith, “is the treasur'd Part Of an impenitently harden'd Heart.” When Love reveals Its Own Eternal Life, Then Wrath and Anguish fall on evil Strife,— Then Lovely Justice, in Itself all Bright, Is Burning Fire to such as hate the Light. V If Wrath and Justice be indeed the same, No Wrath in God is liable to blame. If not,—if righteous Judges may, and must, Be free Themselves from Wrath, if they be just,— Such Kind of Blaming may with equal Sense Lay on a Judge the Criminal's Offence. VI God, in Himself Unchangeable, in fine Is One Eternal Light of Love Divine. “In Him there is no Darkness,” saith St. John; In Him no Wrath,—the Meaning is all one. 'Tis our own Darkness, Wrath, Sin, Death and Hell, Not to love Him Who first lov'd us so well. THE FOREGOING SUBJECT MORE FULLY ILLUSTRATED, IN A COMMENT ON THE FOLLOWING SCRIPTURE “God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have ever-lasting life.” —St. John, iii. 16. I “God so loved the World.”—By how tender a Phrase The Design of His Father our Saviour displays! Love, according to Him, when the World was undone, Was the Father's sole Reason for giving His Son. No Wrath in the Giver had Christ to atone, But to save a poor perishing World from its own. A Belief in the Son carries with it a Faith, That the Motive Paternal was Love, and not Wrath. II “Ev'ry good, perfect Gift cometh down from above, From the Father of Lights,” thro' the Son of His Love. As in Him there is “no Variation or Change,” Neither “Shadow of turning,”—it well may seem strange That, when Scripture assures us so plainly that He, His will, Grace, or Gift, is so perfectly Free, Any Word should be strain'd to incúlcate a Thought Of a Wrath in His Mind, or a Change to be wrought. III All Wrath is the Product of creaturely Sin. In Immutable Love it could never begin;— Nor, indeed, in a Creature, till opposite Will To the Love of its God had brought forth such an Ill,— To the Love That was pleas'd to communicate Bliss In such endless Degrees thro' all Nature's Abyss. Nor could Wrath have been known, had not Man left the State In which Nature's God was pleas'd Man to create. IV He saw, when this World in its Purity stood, Ev'ry Thing He had made, and, “behold, it was good;” And the Man, its one Ruler, before his sad Fall, As the Image of God had the Goodness of All. When he fell, and awaken'd Wrath, Evil and Curse In himself and the World, was God become worse, Who so lov'd the World still that, when Wrath was begun, To redeem the lost Creature, He gave His own Son?— V Freely gave Him,—not mov'd or incited thereto By a previous “appeasing,” or payment of Due To his “Wrath,” or His “Vengeance,” or any such Cause As should satisfy Him for the Breach of His Laws. This Language the Jew Nicodemus might use, But our Saviour's to him had more Excellent Views: “God so lovèd the World,” (are His Words) “that He gave “His Only-Begotten” in order to save. VI Love's prior, unpurchas'd, unpaid-for Intent Was the Cause why the Only-Begotten was sent, That thro' Him we might live; and the Cause why He came Was to manifest Love, ever One and the Same,— Full Conquest of Wrath ever striving to make, And blotting Transgressions out for Its own sake; Wanting no Satisfaction itself but to give Itself, that the World might receive It and live;— VII Might believe on the Son, and receive a new Birth From the Love That in Christ was Incarnate on Earth, When a Virgin brought forth, without help of a Man, The Restorer of God's True, Original Plan,— The One Quencher of Wrath, the Atoner of Sin, And the “Bringer of Justice and Righteousness in;” The Renewer in Man of a Pow'r and a Will To satisfy Justice,—that is, to fulfil. VIII There is nothing that Justice and Righteousness hath More opposite to it than Anger and Wrath,— As repugnant to all that is equal and right, As Falsehood to Truth, or as Darkness to Light. Of God in Himself what the Scripture affirms Is “Truth,” “Light,” and “Love,”—plain significant Terms. In His Deity, therefore, there cannot befall Any Falsehood, or Darkness, or Hatred at all. IX Such Defect can be found in that Creature alone Which against His Good Will seeks to set up its own. Then, to God and His Justice it giveth the Lie, And its Darkness and Wrath are discover'd thereby. What before was subservient to Life in due Place, Then usurps the Dominion, and Death is the Case; Which the Son of God only could ever subdue By doing all that which Love gave Him to do. X If “the Anger of God,” “Fury,” “Wrath, waxing hot,” And the like human Phrases that Scripture has got, Be insisted upon, why not also the rest, Where God in the Language of Men is exprest In a Manner which all are oblig'd to confess, No Defect in His Nature can mean to express? With a God Who is Love ev'ry Word should agree,— With a God Who hath said, “Fury is not in Me.” XI The Disorders in Nature,—for none are in God,— Are entitled “His Vengeance,” “His Wrath,” or “His Rod;” Like “His Ice,” or “His Frost,” “His Plague, Famine, or Sword,” That the Love Which directs them may still be ador'd;— Directs them, till Justice, call'd His or call'd ours, Shall regain, to our Comfort, Its Primitive Pow'rs,— The True, Saving Justice, that bids us endure What Love shall prescribe for effecting our Cure. XII By a Process of Love from the Crib to the Cross Did the Only-Begotten recover our Loss, And show in us Men how the Father is pleas'd, When the Wrath in our Nature by Love is appeas'd;— When the Birth of His Christ, being formèd within, Dissolves the dark Death of all Self-hood and Sin; Till the Love That so lov'd us becomes once again, From the Father and Son, a Life-Spirit in Men. THE TRUE GROUNDS OF ETERNAL AND IMMUTABLE RECTITUDE. I Th' Eternal Mind, ev'n Heathens understood, Was Infinitely Pow'rful, Wise, and Good. In their Conceptions, who conceiv'd aright, These Three Essential Attributes unite. They saw that, wanting any of the Three, Such an All-perfect Being could not be. II For Pow'r from Wisdom suff'ring a Divorce Would be a foolish, mad and frantic Force. If Both were join'd, and wanted Goodness still, They would concur to more pernicious Ill; However nam'd, their Action could but tend To Weakness, Folly, Mischief without End. III Yet some of old, and some of present Hour, Ascribe to God an arbitrary Pow'r, An absolute Decree, a mere Command, Which Nothing causes, Nothing can withstand; Wisdom and Goodness scarce appear in Sight; But all is measur'd by resistless Might. IV The verbal Question comes to this, in fine: “Is Good or Evil made by Will Divine, Or such by Nature? Does Command enact What shall be right, and then 'tis so in Fact? Or is it right, and therefore we may draw From thence the Reason of the Righteous Law?” V Now, tho' 'tis Proof indisputably plain, That all is right which God shall once ordain,— Yet, if a Thought shall intervene between Things and Commands, 'tis evidently seen That Good will be commanded. Men divide Nature and Laws, which really coincide. VI From the Divine, Eternal Spirit springs Order and Rule and Rectitude of Things, Thro' outward Nature, His Apparent Throne, Visibly seen, intelligibly known,— Proofs of a Boundless Pow'r, a Wisdom's Aid, By Goodness us'd, Eternal and Unmade. VII Cudworth perceiv'd that what Divines advance For Sov'reignty alone is Fate, or Chance,— Fate, after Pow'r had made its forcing Laws; And Chance before, if made without a Cause. Nothing stands firm or certain in a State Of fatal Chance or accidental Fate. VIII Endless Perfections after all conspire, And to adore excite and to admire; But to plain Minds the Plainest Pow'r Above Is Native Goodness to attract our Love; Centre of all Its various Pow'r and Skill Is One Divine, Immutable Good Will. ON THE NATURE AND REASON OF ALL OUTWARD LAW. “The Sabbath was made for Man; not Man for the Sabbath.” —St. Mark, ii. 27. I From this true Saying one may learn to draw The real Nature of all outward Law. In ev'ry Instance, rightly understood, Its Ground and Reason is the human Good; By all its Changes, since the World began, Man was not made for Law, but Law for Man. II “Thou shalt not eat,”—the first Command of all— “Of Good and Ill,” was to prevent his Fall. When he became unfit to be alone, Woman was form'd out of his Flesh and Bone. When both had sinn'd, then Penitential Grief And sweating Labour was the Law Relief. III When all the World had sinn'd, save one good Sire, Flood was the Law that sav'd its Orb from Fire; When Fire itself upon a Sodom fell, It was the Law to stop a growing Hell; So on,—the Law with Riches or with Rods, Come as it will, is Good; for it is God's. IV Men who observe a Law, or who abuse For selfish Pow'r, are blind as any Jews; On Sabbath, constru'd by rabbinic Will, God must not save, and Men must seek to kill. Such Zeal for Law has pharisaic Faith, Not as 'tis good, but as it worketh Wrath. V Jesus, the Perfect Law-fulfiller, gave The Victory that taught the Law to save; Pluck'd out its Sting, revers'd the cruel Cry: “We have a Law by which He ought to die.” Dying for Man, this Conquest He could give: “I have a Law by which he ought to live.” VI Whilst in the Flesh, how oft did He reveal His Saving Will, and God-like Pow'r to heal! They whom Defect, Disease or Fiend possess'd, And pardon'd Sinners, by his Word had Rest; He, on the Sabbath, chose to heal and teach, And Law-proud Jews to slay him for its Breach. VII The Sabbath, never so well kept before, May justify one Observation more. Our Saviour heal'd, as pious Authors say, So many Sick upon the Sabbath-Day, To shew that Rest and Quietness of Soul Is best for one who wants to be made whole;— VIII Not to indulge an Eagerness too great Of outward Hurry or of inward Heat; But, with an humble Temper and resign'd, To keep a Sabbath in a hopeful Mind, In Peace and Patience meekly to endure, Till the Good Saviour's Hour is come,—to cure. DIVINE LOVE, THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTIC OF TRUE RELIGION. I Religion's Meaning when I would recall, Love is to me the plainest Word of all. Plainest,—because that what I love, or hate, Shews me directly my internal State; By its own Consciousness is best defin'd Which way the Heart within me stands inclin'd. II On what it lets its Inclination rest, To that its real Worship is address'd; Whatever Forms or Ceremonies spring From Custom's Force, there lies the real Thing; Jew, Turk or Christian be the Lover's Name, If same the Love, Religion is the same. III Of all Religions if we take a View, There is but one that ever can be true,— One God, One Christ, One Spirit, none but He. All else is Idol, whatsoe'er it be,— A Good that our Imaginations make, Unless we love it purely for His Sake. IV Nothing but gross Idolatry alone Can ever love it merely for its own. It may be good, that is, may make appear So much of God's One Goodness to be clear; Thereby to raise a true, religious Soul To Love of Him, the One Eternal Whole;— V The One Unbounded, Undivided Good, By all His Creatures partly understood. If therefore Sense of its apparent Parts Raise not His Love or Worship in our Hearts, Our selfish Wills or Notions we may feast, And have no more Religion than a Beast. VI For brutal Instinct can a Good embrace That leaves behind it no reflecting Trace; But thinking Man, whatever be his Theme, Should worship Goodness in the Great Supreme; By inward Faith, more sure than outward Sight, Should eye the Source of all that's Good and Right. VII Religion, then, is Love's Celestial Force That penetrates thro' all to Its True Source; Loves all along, but with proportion'd Bent, As Creatures further the Divine Ascent, Not to the Skies or Stars, but to the part That will be always uppermost,—the Heart, VIII There is the Seat, as Holy Writings tell, Where the Most High Himself delights to dwell; Whither attracting the desirous Will To its true Rest, He saves it from all Ill, Gives it to find in His Abyssal Love An Heav'n within,—in other Words, Above. ON WORKS OF MERCY AND COMPASSION, CONSIDERED AS THE PROOFS OF TRUE RELIGION. I Of true Religion Works of Mercy seem To be the plainest Proof in Christ's Esteem; Who has Himself declar'd what He will say To all the Nations at the Judgment Day: “Come,” or “Depart,” is the predicted Lot Of brotherly Compassion shown, or not. II Then, they who gave poor hungry People Meat, And Drink to quench the thirsty Suff'rer's Heat; Who welcom'd in the Stranger at the Door, And with a Garment clothed the naked Poor; Who visited the Sick to ease their Grief, And went to Pris'ners, or bestow'd Relief:— III These will be deem'd religious Men, to whom Will sound: “Ye blessèd of my Father, come, Inherit ye the Kingdom, and partake Of all the Glories founded for your Sake; Your Love for others I was pleas'd to see, What you have done to them was done to Me!” IV Then, they who gave the hungry Poor no Food; Who with no Drink the parch'd with Thrift bedew'd; Who drove the helpless Stranger from their Fold, And let the Naked perish in the Cold; Who to the Sick no friendly Visit paid, Nor gave to Pris'ners any needful Aid;— V These will be deem'd of irreligious Mind; And hear the: “Go, ye Men of cursèd Kind; To endless Woes, which ev'ry harden'd Heart For its own Treasure has prepar'd, depart; Shown to a Brother of the least Degree, Your merciless Behaviour was to Me!” VI Here, all ye learnèd, full of all Dispute, Of true and false Religion lies the Root. The Mind of Christ, when He became a Man, With all Its Tempers, forms its real Plan, The Sheep from Goats distinguishing full well;— His Love is Heav'n, and Want of It is Hell. THE SOUL'S TENDENCY TOWARDS ITS TRUE CENTRE. I Stones towards the Earth descend; Rivers to the Ocean roll; Ev'ry Motion has some End;— What is thine, belovèd Soul? II “Mine is, where my Saviour is; There with Him I hope to dwell. Jesus is the Central Bliss, Love the Force That doth impel.” III Truly, thou hast answer'd right. Now, may Heav'ns Attractive Grace Tow'rds the Source of thy Delight Speed along thy quick'ning Pace! IV “Thank thee for thy gen'rous Care! Heav'n That did the Wish inspire Through thy instrumental Prayer Plumes the Wings of my Desire. V “Now, methinks, aloft I fly; Now, with Angels bear a Part. Glory be to God on High, Peace to ev'ry Christian Heart!” A PARAPHRASE ON THE PRAYER USED IN THE CHURCH LITURGY “FOR ALL SORTS AND CONDITIONS OF MEN.” I It will bear the repeating again and again, Will the Pray'r for all Sorts and Conditions of Men; Not to this or that Place, Name or Nation confin'd, But embracing, at once, the whole Race of Mankind; With a Love Universal instructing to call On the One Great Creating Preserver of All: That His Way may be known upon Earth, and be found His true saving Health by the Nations all round! II He Who willeth all Men to be sav'd, and partake Of the Bliss which distinguish'd their primitive Make,— To arise to that Life, by a second new Birth, Which Adam had lost at his Fall upon Earth,— Will accept ev'ry Heart, whose unfeignèd Intent Is to pray for that Blessing, which He Himself meant, When He gave His own Son for whoever should will To escape, by His Means, from the Regions of Ill. III But tho' all the whole World, in a Sense that is good, To be God's House or Church may be well understood, And the Men who dwell on it His Children, for whom It has pleas'd Him that Christ the Redeemer should come,— Yet His Church must consist, in all saving Respect, Of them who receive Him, not them who reject; And His true, real Children, or People, are they Who, when call'd by the Saviour, believe and obey. IV Now this excellent Pray'r, in this Sense of the Phrase, For the Catholic Church more especially prays: That it may be so constantly govern'd and led By the Spirit of God, and of Jesus its Head, That all such as are taught to acknowledge its Creed And profess to be Christians, may be so indeed; May hold the one Faith in a Peace without Strife, And the Proof of its Truth a right practical Life. V No partial Distinction is here to be sought; For the Good of Mankind still enlivens the Thought. Since God by the Church, in its Catholic Sense, Salvation to all is so pleas'd to dispense, That the further her Faith and her Patience increase, More Hearts will be won to the Gospel of Peace; Till the World shall come under Truth's absolute Sway, And the Nations, converted, bring on the great Day. VI Meanwhile, tho' Eternity be her chief Care, The Suff'rers in Time have a suitable Share; She prays to the Fatherly Goodness of God For all whom Affliction has under its Rod; That, inward or outward the Cause of their Grief,— Mind, Body, Estate,—He would grant them Relief, Due Comfort and Patience, and finally bless With the most happy Ending of all their Distress. VII The Compassion here taught is unlimited too, And the Whole of Mankind the petitioning View. As none can foresee, whether Christian or not, What Afflictions may fall in this World to his Lot; The Church, which considers Whose Providence sends, Prays that all may obtain Its Beneficent Ends And, whenever the Suff'rings here needful are past, By Repentance and Faith may be sav'd at the last. VIII The particular Mention of such as desire To be publicly pray'd for, as made in our Quire, Infers to all others God's Merciful Grace. Tho' we hear not their Names, who are in the like Case, It excites our Attention to Instances known Of Relations, or Neighbours, or Friends of our own; For the Pray'r in its Nature extends to all those, Who are in the same Trouble, Friends to Us or Foes. IX All which she entreats, for His Sake, to be done, Who suffer'd to save them, Christ Jesus, His Son,— In respect to the World, the Redeemer of All; “To the Church of the Faithful, most chiefly,” saith Paul; And to them who shall suffer, whoever they be, In the Spirit of Christ, in the highest Degree. How ought such a Goodness all Minds to prepare For an hearty “Amen” to this Catholic Pray'r! X The Church is indeed, in its real Intent, An Assembly where Nothing but Friendship is meant; And the utter Extinction of Foeship and Wrath By the Working of Love in the Strength of its Faith. This gives it its holy and catholic Name, And truly confirms its apóstolic Claim; Showing what the One Saviour's One Mission had been: “Go and teach all the World,”—ev'ry Creature therein. XI In the Praise ever due to the Gospel of Grace Its Universality holds the first Place. When an Angel proclaim'd Its glad Tidings the Morn That the Son of the Virgin, the Saviour, was born, “Which shall be to all People,” was said to complete The angelical Message, so good and so great, Full of “Glory to God,” in the Regions Above, And of “Goodness to Men,” is so Boundless a Love. XII This short Supplication, or Litany, read When the longer with us is not wont to be said, Tho' brief in Expression, as fully imports The Will to all Blessings, for “Men of all Sorts,”— Same brotherly Love, by which Christians are taught To “pray without ceasing,” or limiting Thought; That Religion may flourish upon its true Plan Of Glory to God and Salvation to Man. THE PRAYER OF RUSBROCHIUS. I O merciful Lord! by the Good Which Thou art I beseech Thee to raise a true Love in my Heart For Thee, above all Things, Thee only,—and then To extend to all Sorts and Conditions of Men;— Religious or secular, Kindred or not, Or near or far off, or whatever their Lot; That be any Man's State rich or poor, high or low, As myself I may love him, Friend tó me or Foe; II May pay to all Men a becoming Respect, Not prone to condemn them for seeming Defect; But to bear it, if true, with a Patience exempt From the proud, surly Vice of a scornful Contempt. If shown to myself, let me learn to endure, And obtain by Its Aid my own Vanity's Cure; Nor, however disdain'd, in the spitefullest Shape, By a sinful Return ever think to escape! III Let my pure, simple Aim in whatever it be, Thro' Praise or Dispraise, be my Duty to Thee; With a fixt Resolution still eyeing that Scope To admit of no other—Fear be it or Hope,— But the Fear to offend Thee, the Hope to unite In Thy Honour and Praise with all Hearts that are right; Wishing all the World well, but intent to fulfil, Be they pleas'd or displeas'd, Thy Adorable Will! IV Preserve me, Dear Lord, from Presumption and Pride, That upon my own Actions would tempt to confide; Let me have no Dependence on any but Thine, With a right Faith and Trust in Thy Merits Divine; Still ready prepar'd, in each requisite Hour, Both to will and to work as Thou givest the Pow'r; But may only Thy Love flame thro' all my whole Heart, And a false selfish Fire not affect the least Part! V To this End let Thine Arrow pierce deeply within, Letting out all the Filth and Corruption of Sin; All that in the most secret Recesses may lurk, To prevent or obstruct Thy Intention or Work! O give me the Knowledge, the Feeling and Sense Of Thy All-blessing Pow'r, Wisdom, Goodness Immense,— Of the Weakness, the Folly, the Malice alone, That, resisting Thy Will, I should find in my own! VI Never let me forget, never, while I draw Breath, What Thou hast done for me,—Thy Passion and Death; The Wounds and the Griefs of Thy Body and Soul, When assuming our Nature Thou madest it Whole; Taughtest how to engage in Thy Conquering Strife, And regain the Access to its True Divine Life; Let the Sense of such Love kindle all my Desire, To be Thine my Life thro', Thine to die and expire! VII To Hearts in the Bond of Thy Charity Knit Ev'ry Thing become easy to do or omit; The Labour is pleasant, the sharpest Degree Of Suff'ring can find Consolation in Thee. That which Nature affords, or an Object terrene, When it does not divert from a pérfecter Scene, Is receiv'd with all Thanks, if Thou pleasest to grant, By a Mind, if Thou pleasest, as willing to want. VIII The Amusements on which it once set such a Store, Are now as insipid as grateful before; With a much greater Comfort it gives up each Toy Than the fondest Possessor could ever enjoy. If e'er I propos'd such unsuitable Ends To the Thought of religious or secular Friends, Expel the vain Images, Fancies of Good, And in their Heart and mine make Thyself understood! IX Extinguish, O Lord, let not any one take, A Complacence in me which is not for Thy Sake; In me, too, root out the Respect of all Kind Which does not arise from Thy Love in my Mind; No Sorrow be spar'd, no Affliction, no Cross, That may further this Love or recover Its Loss! This is always Thy Meaning; O let it be mine, To confess Myself guilty, repent, and resign! X With a real Contempt of all Sélf-seeking Views. To embrace for my Choice what Thy Wisdom shall choose; Looking up still to Thee, to receive all Event Which It wills or permits, with a thankful Content; Not regarding what Men shall do tó me, or why, But the provident Aim of Thine all-seeing Eye; Ever watchful o'er them who persist, in each Place, To rely on Its Presence,—O give me Thy Grace! XI Tho' unworthy to ask it (poor Sinner!) I trust In the Merits and Death of a Saviour so just; Whom the Father, well pleas'd in His Satisfied Will, The Design to save Sinners saw rightly fulfil. In me let Thy Grace, O Redeemer within, Re-establish His Justice and purge away Sin; That, freed from its Evils, in me may be shown The Effect of Thy All-saving Merits alone! XII May Death, and its Consequence, still in my Eyes So remind me to live that it may not surprise; May the horrible Torments excite a due Dread, Which impenitent Sinners bring on their own Head; May I never seek Peace, never find a Delight, But when I pursue what is good in Thy Sight! Whatsoever I do, suffer, feel to befall, Be Thou the Sole Cause, the One Reason of all! ON ATTENTION. Sacred Attention! True effectual Prayer! Thou dost the Soul for Love of Truth prepare. Blest is the Man who, from Conjecture free, To future Knowledge shall aspire by thee; Who in thy Precepts seeks a sure Repose; Stays till he sees, nor judges till he knows;— Tho' firm not rash, tho' eager yet sedate, Intent on Truth can Its Instruction wait; Aw'd by thy powerful Influence to appeal To Heaven, Which only can Itself reveal; The soul in humble Silence to resign, And human Will unite to the Divine; Till, fir'd at length by Heaven's Enlivening Beams, Pure, unconsum'd the faithful Victim flames! A PRAYER, USED BY FRANCIS THE FIRST, WHEN HE WAS AT WAR WITH THE EMPEROR CHARLES THE FIFTH. Almighty Lord of Hosts, by Whose Commands The guardian Angels rule their destin'd Lands, And watchful at thy Word to save or stay Of Peace or War administer the Sway! Thou Who against the great Goliah's Rage Didst arm the Stripling David to engage, When with a Sling a small unarmèd Youth Smote a huge Giant in Defence of Truth,— Hear us, we pray Thee, if our Cause be true; If sacred Justice be our only View; If Right and Duty, not the Will to War Have forc'd our Armies to proceed thus far! Then, turn the Hearts of all our Foes to Peace, That War and Bloodshed in the Land may cease; Or, put to Flight by Providential Dread, Let them lament their Errors, not their Dead! If some must die, protect the righteous all, And let the guilty, few as may be, fall! With pitying Speed the Victory decree To them whose Cause is best approv'd by Thee; That, sheath'd on all Sides the devouring Sword, And Peace and Justice to our Land restor'd, We all together with one Heart may sing Triumphant Hymns to Thee, th' Eternal King! A COMMENT ON THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE, IN THE GENERAL CONFESSION OF SINS USED IN THE CHURCH-LITURGY: “ACCORDING TO THY PROMISES DECLARED UNTO MANKIND IN CHRIST JESU OUR LORD.” I “According to Thy Promises”—Hereby, Since it is certain that God cannot lie, The truly Penitent may all be sure That Grace admits them to Its open Door; And they, forsaking all their former Sin, However great, will freely be let in. II “Declar'd”—By all the Ministers of Peace God has assur'd Repentance of Release. An intervening Penitence, we see, Could even Change His positive Decree, As in the Ninivites. If any Soul Repent, the Promise is the sure Parole. III “Unto Mankind”—Not only to the Jews, Christians or Turks in Writings which they use; Writ on the Tablet of each conscious Heart: “Repent; from all Iniquity depart!” Not for no Purpose; for the plain Intent Is Restoration, if a Soul repent. IV “In Christ”—By Whom true Scripture has assur'd Redeeming Grace for Penitents procur'd. The fainter Hopes, which Reason may suggest, Are deeply by the Gospel's Aid imprest. 'Twas always hop'd for, was the Promis'd Good, But by His Coming clearly understood. V “Jesu”—Jehovah's Manifested Love In Christ, th' Anointed Saviour from Above. The Demonstration of the Saving Plan For all Mankind is God's becoming Man; No Truth more firmly ascertain'd than this: “Repent, be faithful, and restor'd to Bliss!” VI “Our Lord”—Our New and True Parental Head, Our Second Adam, in the first when dead; Who took our Nature on Him, that in Men His Father's Image might shine forth again. Sure of Success may Penitents implore What God through Him rejoices to restore. ON CHURCH COMMUNION In seven Parts; from a Letter of Mr. Law's. PART FIRST. I Religion, Church-Communion, or the Way Of public Worship that we ought to pay, As it regards the Body and the Mind Is of external and internal Kind,— The one confiding in the outward Sign, The other in the Inward Truth Divine. II This Inward Truth, intended to be shown So far as outward Signs can make it known, Is that which gives external Modes a Worth, Just in Proportion as they shew it forth,— Just as they help, in any outward Part, The real, true Religion of the Heart. III Now, what this is, exclusive of all Strife, Christians will own to be an Inward Life, Spirit and Pow'r—a Birth, to say the Whole, Of Christ Himself, brought forth within the Soul; By this all True Salvation is begun And carried on, however It be done. IV Christianity that has not Christ within, Can by no Means whatever save from Sin; Can bear no Evidence of Him, the End On Which the Value of all Means depend. Christian Religion signifies, no doubt, Like Mind within, like Show of it without. V The Will of God, the Saving of Mankind, Was all that Christ had in His Inward Mind; All that produc'd His Outward Action too, In Church Communion while a perfect Jew,— Like most of His Disciples, till they came At Antioch to have a Christian Name. VI If Christ has put an End to Rites of old,— If new recall what was but then foretold,— The One True Church, the Real Heav'nly Ground Wherein alone Salvation can be found, Is still the Same, and to its Saviour's Praise His Inward Tempers outwardly displays; VII By hearty Love and correspondent Rites Ordain'd, the Members to the Head unites And to each other. In all stated Scenes The Life of Christ is what a Christian means; Tho' Change of Circumstance may alter those, In This he places and enjoys Repose. VIII Church Unity is held, and Faith's Increase, By that “of Spirit, in the Bond of Peace, And Righteousness of Life;” without this Tie Forms are in vain prescrib'd to worship by, Or Temples modell'd; Hearts as well as Hands An Holy Church and Catholic demands. PART SECOND. I If once establish'd the essential Part, The Inward Church, the Temple of the Heart Or House of God, the Substance and the Sum Of what is pray'd for in “Thy Kingdom come,”— To make an outward Correspondence true, We must recur to Christ's Example too. II Now, in His Outward Form of Life we find Goodness demónstrated of ev'ry Kind. What He was born for, that He show'd throughout; It was the Bus'ness that He went about, Love, Kindness and Compassion to display Tow'rds ev'ry Object coming in His Way. III But Love so High, Humility so Low, And all the Virtues which His Actions show,— His doing Good and His enduring Ill For Man's Salvation and God's Holy Will, Exceed all Terms: His Inward, Outward Plan Was Love to God express'd by Love to Man. IV Mark of the Church which He establish'd, then, Is the same Love, same Proof of it to Men. Without, let Sects parade it how they list, Nor Church, nor Unity can e'er subsist; The Name may be usurp'd, but Want of Pow'r Will shew the Babel, high or low the Tow'r. V And where the same Behaviour shall appear In outward Form, that was in Christ so clear, There is the very Outward Church that He Will'd all Mankind to shew, and all to see; Of which whoever shews it from the Heart, Is both an inward and an outward Part. VI What Excommunication can deprive A pious Soul that is in Christ alive, Of Church-Communion, or cut off a Limb That Life and Action both unite to Him, For any Circumstance of Place or Time, Or Mode or Custom, which infers no Crime? VII If He be That Which His belovèd John Calls Him, “the Light Enlight'ning ev'ryone That comes into the World,”—will He exclude One from His Church, whose Mind He has renew'd To such Degree as to exert, in fact, Like inward Temper and like outward Act? VIII Invisible and visible Effect Of true Church Membership in each Respect Let the One Shepherd from Above behold! The Flocks, howe'er dispers'd, are His one Fold; Seen by their Hearts, and their Behaviour too, They all stand present in His gracious View. PART THIRD. I A local Union, on the other Hand, Tho' crowded Numbers should together stand, Joining in one same Form of Pray'r and Praise, Or Creed express'd in regulated Phrase, Or aught beside,—tho' it assume the Name Of Christian Church, may want the real Claim. II For if it want the Spirit and the Sign That constitute all Worship as Divine, The Love within, the Test of it without, In vain the Union passes for devout. Heartless and tokenless if it remain, It ought to pass, in Strictness, for profane. III At first, an Unity of Heart and Soul, A Distribution of an outward Dole, And ev'ry Member of the Body fed, As equally belonging to the Head, With what it wanted, was without Suspense True Church Communion in full Christian Sense. IV Whether averse the Many or the Few To hold Communion in this righteous View, Their Thought commences Heresy, their Deed Schismatical, tho' they profess the Creed. Ways of distributing, if new, should still Maintain the old communicative Will. V Broken by ev'ry loveless, thankless Thought, And not behaving as a Christian ought,— By want of Meekness, or a Show of Pride Tow'rds any Soul for whom our Saviour died,— While this continues, Men may pray and preach In all their Forms, but none will heal the Breach. VI Whatever Helps an outward Form may bring To Church Communion, it is not the Thing, Nor a Society, as such, nor Place, Nor anything besides Uniting Grace; They are but Accessories at the most To true Communion of the Holy Ghost. VII This is th' essential Fellowship, the Tie Which all true Christians are united by; No other Union does them any Good But that which Christ cemented with His Blood As God and Man: that, having lost it, Men Might live in Unity with God again. VIII What He came down to bring us from Above Was Grace and Peace, and Law-fulfilling Love; True Spirit-Worship, which His Father sought, Was the sole End of what He did and taught; That God's Own Church and Kingdom might begin, Which Moses and the Prophets usher'd in. PART FOURTH. I “The Church of Christ, as thus you represent, And all the World is of the same Extent. Jews, Turks, or Pagans may be Members too; This, some may call a dreadful mystic Clue, A Combination of the Quaker Schemes With latitudinarian Extremes.” II They may; but Names, so ready at the Call Of such as want them, have no Force at all To overthrow momentous Truths and plain, The very Points of Scripture and the main; Such as distinguish in the clearest View Th' enlighten'd Christian from the half-blind Jew. III What did the Sheet let down to Peter mean, Who call'd the Gentiles common, or, unclean? Let Peter answer: “God was pleas'd to show That I should call no Man whatever so; In ev'ry Nation he that serves Him right, Is clean, accepted, in His Equal Sight.” IV If Peter said so, who will question Paul? He, in a Manner, made this Point his all. The real Sense of what has here been said In mystic Paul is plainly to be read; Nothing but obstinate Dislike to Terms Obscures what all the Testament affirms. V The Jews objected, to his Gospel Clue, A, “What Advantage therefore hath the Jew;” Or, “Of what Use is to be circumcis'd?” So may some Christians say, “to be baptis'd;” May form like Questions, like Conclusions draw, And urge the Church, as they did, and the Law. VI Th' Apostle's Reas'ning from the common Want Of God's Free Grace, its Universal Grant By Jesus Christ, its Reach to all Mankind For whom the same Salvation was design'd,— Shows that His Church, as Boundless as His Grace, Extends Itself to all the human Race. VII With pious Jews of old “our King” implied The one true King of all the Earth beside; Whose regal Right, tho' He was pleas'd to call Jacob His Lot, extended over all. Tho' Israel gloried in acknowledg'd Light, Its Virtue was not bounded by their Sight. VIII So will a Christian Piety confess A Church of Christ with Boundaries no less; Will speak, as ev'ry conscious Witness ought, To what it knows, but scorn the partial Thought Of Grace, or Truth, or Righteousness confin'd To Modes and Customs of external Kind. PART FIFTH. I The Church, consider'd only as possest Of England, Rome, Geneva and the rest,— Notion of Church so popularly rife, Such Cause of endless Enmity and Strife,— Did but arise in a succeeding Hour, When Christians came to have a worldly Pow'r. II The first Apostles spread from Place to Place The Gospel News of Universal Grace; Inviting all to enter by Belief Into the Church of their Redeeming Chief;— Entrance accessible in ev'ry Part, And shut to Nothing but a faithless Heart. III But when the Princes of the World became, And Kings, Protectors of the Christian Name, Pow'r made ambitious Pastors, Ease remiss, And Churches dwindl'd into that and this; The one, divided, came to want of course Supports quite foreign to its native Force. IV Contentions rose, all tending to create Still new Alliances of Church and State, Form'd and reform'd, and turn'd and overturn'd, As Force prevail'd and human Passion burn'd. Old Revolutions, when by new dissolv'd, Both Church and State accordingly revolv'd. V Such is the Mixture of an human Sway In all external Churches at this Day,— To the same Changes liable anew, That Forms of Government are subject to; While the one Church, in its true Sense, in Name And Thing remains unchangeably the same. VI The private Christian, bearing Christ in Mind, Whose Kingdom was not of a worldly Kind, Has little, or has no Concern at all, With these external Changes that befall. Let Providence permit them or prevent, With Truth and Spirit he remains content. VII Not that he thinks that Evil, more or less, Is in its Nature alter'd by Success; The Good is good, tho' suff'ring a Defeat, The Bad but worse, if its Success be great; He measures neither by th' Event that's past, For what they were at first they are at last. VIII But, by the Spirit of the Gospel free, Whatever State of Government it be That God has plac'd him under, to submit, So in the Church he thinks the Freedom fit; Whilst, on Occasion of the outward Part, He can present what God requires,—an Heart. PART SIXTH. I The Heart is what the God of it demands, Who “dwelleth not in Temples made with Hands.” When Hands have made them, if no Hearts are found Dispos'd aright to consecrate the Ground, Vainly is Worship said to be Divine, While in the Breast its Object has no Shrine. II But if it has, in that devoted Breast A right Intention surely will be blest; Tho' Forms, prescrib'd by Pastors in the Chair, Should be adjusted with less perfect Care; Tho', in some Points, the Services assign'd Differ from those of apostolic Kind. III What outward Church, or Form, shall we select, That is not chargeable with some Defect? Each is prepar'd in all the rest to grant A Superfluity, or else a Want, Or both,—a Distance from Perfection wide, Retorted on itself by all beside. IV What safer Remedy than pure Intent To seek the Good by any of them meant, Which He Who mindeth only what the Heart Brings of its own, is ready to impart? No human Pow'r, should it enjoin amiss A ceremonious Rite, can hinder this. V Even in Sacrament, what frequent Storms Has Superstition rais'd about the Forms! In Rites baptismal, which the true Result? Immersion, Sprinkling? Infants, or th' adult? In the Lord's Supper, does the Celebration Make Trans-, or Con-, or Non-substantiation? VI These, and a World of Controversies more, Serve to enlarge the bibliothecal Store; While Champions make Antiquity their Boast, And all pretend to imitate it most,— Prone to neglect for criticising Pique Essential Truths eternally antique. VII Thus inward Worship lies in low Estate, Opprest with endless Volumes of Debate About the outward; soon as old ones die, All undecided, comes a new Supply Of needless Doubts to a religious Soul, Whose upright Meaning dissipates the Whole. VIII Clear of all worldly, interested Views, The one Design of Worship it pursues; Turns all to Use that public Form allows, By off'ring up its ever private Vows For the Success of all the Good design'd By Christ, the Common Saviour of Mankind. PART SEVENTH. I A christian, in so catholic a Sense, Can give to none but partial Minds Offence, Forc'd to live under some divided Part, He keeps entire the Union of the Heart,— The sacred Tie of Love; by which alone Christ said that His Disciples would be known. II He values no Distinction, as profest By way of Separation from the rest,— Oblig'd in Duty and inclin'd by Choice In all the Good of any to rejoice; From ev'ry Evil, Falsehood or Mistake To wish them free, for common Comfort's Sake. III Freedom,—to which the most undoubted Way Lies in Obedience (where it always lay) To Christ Himself Who with an inward Call Knocks at the Door, that is, the Heart of all. At the Reception of this Heav'nly Guest All Good comes in, all Evil quits the Breast. IV The free Receiver, then, becomes content With what God orders, or does not prevent. To them that love Him, all Things, he is sure, Must work for Good; tho' how, may be obscure; Even successful Wickedness, when past, Will bring to them some latent Good at last. V Fall'n as divided Churches are and gone From the Perfection of the Christian one, Respect is due to any that contains The venerable, tho' but faint, Remains Of ancient Rule, which had not in its View The Letter only, but the Spirit too. VI When that Variety of new-found Ways Which People so run after in our Days, Has done its utmost; when “Lo here, Lo there,” Shall yield to inward Seeking and sincere,— What was at first, may come to be again The Praise of Church-Assemblies amongst Men. VII Meanwhile, in that to which we now belong, To mind in public Lesson, Pray'r and Song, Teaching and Preaching, what conduces best To true Devotion in the private Breast,— Willing increase of Good to ev'ry Soul,— Seems to be our Concern upon the whole. VIII So God and Christ and holy Angels stand Dispos'd to ev'ry Church in ev'ry Land, The Growth of Good still helping to complete Whatever Tares be sown amongst the Wheat. Who would not wish to have and to excite A Disposition so Divinely right? A DYING SPEECH; From Mr. Law. In this unhappily divided State That Christian Churches have been in of late, One must, however catholic the Heart, Join and conform to some divided Part. The Church of England is the Part, that I Have always liv'd in, and now choose to die; Trusting, that if I worship God with her In Spirit and in Truth, I shall not err; But as acceptable to Him be found, As if, in Times for one pure Church renown'd Born, I had also liv'd in Heart and Soul, A faithful Member of the unbroken Whole. As I am now, by God's good Will, to go From this disorder'd State of Things below; Into His Hands as I am now to fall, Who is the Great Creator of us all,— God of all Churches that implore His Aid,— Lover of all the Souls that He hath made; Whose Kingdom, that of Universal Love, Must have its blest Inhabitants above. From ev'ry Class of Men, from all the good, Howe'er descended from one human Blood:— So, in this loving Spirit, I desire, As in the midst of all their sacred Quire, With Rites prescrib'd and with a Christian View Of all the World to take my last Adieu; Willing in Heart and Spirit to unite With ev'ry Church in what is just and right, Holy and good, and worthy in its Kind Of God's Acceptance from an honest Mind; Praying, that ev'ry Church may have its Saints And rise to that Perfection which it wants. Father, Thy Kingdom come! Thy Sacred Will May all the Tribes of humam Race fulfil; Thy Name be prais'd by ev'ry living Breath, Author of Life and Vanquisher of Death! A COMMENT ON THE FOLLOWING SCRIPTURE “In the Beginning was the Word.” —St. John, i. 1. I “In the Beginning was the Word,” saith John,— “The Life,” “the Light,” “the Truth,” for all are One,— One All-creating Pow'r, All-wise, All-good, In Which at first the whole Creation stood; Moving and acting in the Pow'r Alone;— How bright, how perfect and, no Evil known, How blest was Natures universal Plan, And the fair Image of his Maker, Man! II The Word, the Pow'r, is Christ; th' Eternal Son Of God, by Whom the Father's Will is done. Each is the Other's Glory, and the Love From Both the Bliss of all the blest above. Angels in Heav'n stand ready to obey, And, as the Word directs them, so do they. So must we Men, born here upon this Earth, If ever we regain the Heav'nly Birth;— III Lost by poor Adam in the fatal Hour Of lusting after Knowledge without Pow'r; When, yielding to Temptation, tho' forbid To eat what was not good for him, he did. The Pow'r of Life consenting to forego,— For what was told him would be Death to know,— He died to his Celestial State, and then Could but convey an earthly one to Men. IV From which to rise, and in true Life to live, What but the Word, wherein was Life, could give,— Engrafted as an holy Seed within, And born to save the human Soul from Sin? The Word made Man by Virgin-Birth, and free From Sin's Dominion, Jesus Christ is He; Whom, of Pure Love, the Father sent to save, And finish Man's Redemption from the Grave. V This Second Adam, Healer of the Breach Made by the first, nor Sin nor Death could reach. He conquer'd both; and, in the glorious Strife, Became the Parent of an endless Life To all who ever did, or shall, aspire To Life and Spirit from this Heav'nly Sire, And cultivate the Seed which He hath sown In ev'ry Heart, till the new Man be grown. VI The old, we know, must die away to Dust, And a new Image rise amongst the just; When at the End of temporary Scene Christ shall appear, eternally to reign In all His Glory, Human and Divine; When all the born of God in Him shall shine, Rais'd to the Life that was at first possest, And bow the Knee to Jesus, and be blest. VII Since, then, the Cause of our eternal Life Is Christ in us, what need of any Strife In His Religion,—of “Lo Here! Lo There!” When to all Hearts He is Himself so near, With Pow'r to save us from the Cause of Ill, A worldly, selfish, unbelieving Will; To bless whatever tends to make the Mind Meek, loving, humble, patient, and resign'd? VIII The Mind to Christ so far as God shall draw By Nature, Scripture, Reason, Learning, Law, Or aught beside,—so far their Use is right, Proclaiming Him, and not themselves the Light. From first to last His Gospel is the same; And of all Worship that deserves a Name, The Word of Life by Faith to apprehend That was in the Beginning,—is the End. A MEMORIAL ABSTRACT OF A SERMON PREACHED BY THE REV. MR. H? ON PROVERBS, Ch. XX. v. 27. I The human Spirit, when it burns and shines, “Lamp of Jehovah” Solomon defines. Now, as a Vessel, to contain the Whole, This “Lamp” denotes the Body, Oil the Soul (As H?observes) which, tho' itself be dark, Is capable of Life's enkindling Spark; But, as consider'd in its own dark Root, Still wants the Unction and the Light's Recruit. II Brighter than all that now is look'd upon, This “Lamp of God” at its Creation shone; The Body, purer than the finest Gold, Had no Defect in its material Mould; The Soul's enkindled Oil was heav'nly bright, Till evil Mixture darken'd its good Light, And hid the supernatural Supply That fed the Glorious Lamp of the Most High. III That fatal Poison quench'd in human Frame The Spirit flowing from the vital Flame. Adam's free Will consenting to such Food, Death in its natural Effect ensued: True Life departing left him naked, blind And spiritless in Body, Soul, and Mind. Dead to his paradisic Life, a Birth From Sin began his mortal Life on Earth. IV His Faith, his spiritual Discernment gone, He fell into a poring, reas'ning one; Into a State of Ignorance he fell, Which brutal Instincts very oft excel. What his Self-seeking Will would know was known,— The Light on this terrestrial Orb alone, Dark in Comparison, when this was done, As Moon or Star-light to meridian Sun. V What Help, when lesser Light should vanish too, And Death discover a still darker View, Had not the Christ of God, Sole Help for Sin, Rais'd up Salvation as a Seed within, That, sprouting forth by Penitence and Faith, Could pierce thro' Death and dissipate its Wrath; Till God's true Image should again revive, And rise, thro' Him, to its first Life alive? VI This Parent Saviour, God's Anointed Son, Begets the Life that Adam should have done; Reforms the Lamp, renews the holy Fire, And sends to Heav'n its flaming Love-Desire. 'Tis He, “the Life that was the Light of Men,”— Who fits them to be Lamps of God again; Restores the Vessel, Oil, and Light, and all The Spirit-Life that vanish'd at the Fall. VII Reason has Nothing to proceed upon, Without an Unction from this Holy One; Without a Spirit, to dispel the Damp Of Nature's Darkness, and light up the Lamp: Nothing whatever but the Touch Divine, Can make its highest Faculties to shine,— All just as helpless in their selfish Use As Lamps their own enkindling to produce. VIII All true Religion teaches them to trim The Lamp, that must receive its Light from Him; From Him, the Quick'ning Spirit, to obtain The Life that must for ever Blest remain. The Life of Christ arising in the Soul, This, this alone makes human Nature whole; Makes ev'ry Gift of Grace to reunite, And shine for ever in Jehovah's Sight. ON THE UNION AND THREEFOLD DISTINCTION OF GOD, NATURE AND CREATURE. PART FIRST. I All that comes under our Imagination Is either God, or Nature, or Creation. God is the Free Eternal Light, or Love, Before, beyond all Nature, and above; The One Unchangeable, Unceasing Will To ev'ry Good, and to no Sort of Ill. II Nature without Him is th' abyssal Dark, Void of the Light's beatifying Spark; Th' Attraction of Desire, by Want repell'd, Whence circling Rage proceeds, and Wrath unquell'd: But by the Light's All-joyous Pow'r th' Abyss Becomes the Groundwork of a Threefold Bliss. III Creation is the Gift of Light and Life To Nature's Contrariety and Strife; For without Nature, or desirous Want, There would be nothing to receive the Grant; Nor could a Creature or created Scene Exist, did no such Medium intervene. IV Creature and God would be the same; the Thought Which Books inform us that Spinoza taught, Would then be true, and we be forc'd to call Things good or bad “the Parts of the great All.” In whatsoever State itself may be, Nature is His, but Nature is not He. V Like as the Dark behind the shining Glass By hind'ring Rays that of themselves would pass Affords that Glimpse of Objects to the View Which the transparent Mirror could not do,— So does the Life of Nature in its Place Reflect the Glories of the Life of Grace. VI Of ev'ry Creature's Happiness the Growth Depends upon the Union of them both, And all that God proceeded to create Came forth at first in this united State. No evil Wrath or Darkness could begin To show itself but by a Creature's Sin. VII And were not Nature separate, alone, Such a dark Wrath, it could not have been shown; Its hidden Properties are Ground as good For Life's Support as Bones to Flesh and Blood; The false, unnatural, ungodly Will That lays them open, is sole Cause of Ill. VIII When it is caus'd, renouncing, to be sure, All such-like Wills contributes to the Cure; That Nature's wrathful Forms may not appear, Nor what is made subservient domineer; But God's Good Will all evil ones subdue, And bless all Nature, and all Creature too. PART SECOND. I This Universal Blessing to inspire Was God's Eternal Purpose or Desire,— Desire, which never could be unfulfill'd; Love put it forth, and Heav'n was what It will'd; And the Desire had in Itself the Means From Whence the Love could raise the Heav'nly Scenes. II Hence, an Eternal Nature, to proclaim By outward, visible, majestic Frame The Hidden Deity, the Pow'r Divine, By Which th' innumerable Beauties shine, That by Succession without End recall A God of Love, a Present All in All. III From Love, thus manifested in the Birth Of Nature and the Pow'rs of Heav'n and Earth, The various Births of Creatures at the Voice Of God came forth to see and to rejoice; To live within His Kingdom, and partake Of ev'ry Bliss adapted to their Make. IV For as, before a Creature came to see, No other Life but that of God could be,— No other place but Heav'n, no other State: So, when it pleas'd th' Almighty to create, From Him must come the Creature's Life within; Its outward State from Nature must begin. V Oh! What angelic Orders, what Divine And Heav'nly Creatures, answer'd the Design Of God's Communicative Goodness, shown By giving Rise to Offsprings of His Own! With God-like Spirits how was Nature fill'd And beauteous Forms, as its Great Author will'd! VI Thus in its full Perfection then it stood, Seeking, receiving, manifesting Good By Virtue of that Union which it had With Him Who made no Creature to be bad, But highly blest and with a potent Will So to continue, and to know no Ill. VII Nature's united Properties had none. Whence, then, the Change that it has undergone But from the Creatures striving to aspire Above the Light which their own dark Desire Quench'd in themselves, and rais'd up all the Storms Of Nature's wrathful, separated Forms? VIII So Lucifer and his proud Legions fell, And turn'd their Heav'nly Mansion to an Hell,— To that dark, formless Void wherein, the Light Ent'ring again with Nature to unite, The new Creation of the World began, And God's Own Image Lord of it,—a Man. ON THE ORIGIN OF EVIL. I Evil, if rightly understood, Is but the Skeleton of Good, Divested of its Flesh and Blood. II While it remains without Divorce Within its hidden, secret Source, It is the Good's own Strength and Force. III As Bone has the supporting Share In human Form Divinely fair, Altho' an Evil when laid bare; IV As Light and Air are fed by Fire, A shining Good, while all conspire, But,—separate,—dark, raging Ire; V As Hope and Love arise from Faith, Which then admits no Ill, nor hath; But, if alone, it would be Wrath; VI Or any Instance thought upon, In which the Evil can be none, Till Unity of Good is gone; VII So, by Abuse of Thought and Skill The greatest Good, to wit, Free-will, Becomes the Origin of Ill. VIII Thus, when rebellious Angels fell, The very Heav'n where good ones dwell Became th' apostate Spirits' Hell. IX Seeking, against Eternal Right, A Force without a Love and Light, They found and felt its evil Might. X Thus Adam, biting at their Bait Of Good and Evil when he ate, Died to his first thrice-happy State; XI Fell to the Evils of this Ball, Which in harmonious Union all Were Paradise before his Fall; XII And, when the Life of Christ in Men Revives its faded Image, then Will all be Paradise again. A FRIENDLY EXPOSTULATION WITH A CLERGYMAN, CONCERNING A PASSAGE IN HIS SERMON RELATING TO THE REDEMPTION OF MANKIND. 'Twas a good Sermon; but a close Review Would bear one Passage to be alter'd, too; Because it did not in the least agree With the plain Text (as it appear'd to me), Nor with your Comment on what God had done To save Mankind by His Redeeming Son. You did, if I remember right, admit That other Means, if He had so thought fit, Might have obtain'd the salutary Views As well as those which He was pleas'd to choose; That it was too presumptuous to confine To those alone th' Omnipotence Divine,— As if a Wisdom Infinite could find No other Method how to save Mankind; Tho' that, indeed, which had been fix'd upon, Was in effect become the only one! Now, this, however well design'd to raise An awful Sense by its respectful Phrase,— An Adoration of the Boundless Pow'rs Of the Almighty, when compar'd with ours; To sink in humble Rev'rence and profound All human Thoughts of fixing any Bound To an Unerring Wisdom, Which extends Beyond what finite Reason comprehends; Yet, if examin'd by severer Test, It is at least incautiously express'd, And leaves the subtlest of the Gospel's Foes, The Deists, this Objection to propose,— To which they have, and will have, a Recourse, And still keep urging its unanswer'd Force. “If there was no Necessity,” they say, “For saving Men in this mysterious Way, “What Proof can the Divines pretend to bring— “While they confess the Nature of the Thing “Does not forbid,—that the Celestial Scenes “Will not be open'd by some other Means? “What else but Book-authority at best “Asserts this Way exclusive of the rest,— “Of equal Force, if the Almighty's Will “Had but appointed them to save from Ill;— “This Way, in which the Son of the Most High “Is by His Father's Pleasure doom'd to die “For Satisfaction of Paternal Ire; “Which when they make Religion to require, “Confounds all Sense of Justice by a Scheme “The most unworthy of the Great Supreme? “As other Ways might have obtain'd the End, “Nature and Reason force us to attend “To huge Absurdities which follow this, “And, since it was not needful, to dismiss.” This is the Bourdon of deistic Song, Which rising Volumes labour to prolong. Take this away, the rest would all remain As flat and trifling as it is profane; But, this remaining, hither they retreat, And lie secure from any full Defeat. But when the Need most absolute is shown Of Man's Redemption by the Means alone, The Birth, and Life, and Death, and Re-ascent, Thro' which the One Theandric Saviour went, To quench the Wrath of Nature in the Race Of Men,—not God, in whom it has no Place: Then, Scripture, Sense, and Reason coincide, And all conspire to follow the One Guide,— Of Possibilities to waive the talk In which it is impossible to walk, And raise the Soul to seek and find the Good By this one Method, which no other could. Then, true Religion, call it by the Name “Christian” or “Natural,” is still the same,— From Christ deriv'd as Healer of the Soul, Or Nature, made by His Re-entrance whole; Who is in ev'ry Man th' Enlightning Ray, The Faith and Hope of Love's Redeeming Day,— The Only Name or Pow'r that can assure Nature's Religion, that is, Nature's Cure. But, if Salvation might have been bestow'd By other Means than what the Sacred Code Declares throughout, the Deists will soon say, “The Means that might be possible, still may; And, led to think that Scripture is at Odds With Nature, take some other to be God's. Thus may a “no Necessity,” allow'd, Tend to increase the unbelieving Crowd. As Adam died, and in him all his Race, Not to the Life of Nature, but of Grace; There could be no new Birth of it or Growth But from a parent Union of them both,— Such as in ev'ry possible Respect Jesus Incarnate only could effect. From Him alone Who had the Life, could Men Have it restor'd, renew'd, reviv'd again.— But I am trespassing too much, I fear, And preaching, when my Province is to hear.— Millions of Ways could we suppose beside, This, we are sure, which Saving Love has tried, Must be the best, must be the straightest Line Of Action, when consider'd as Divine: This Way alone then must as sure be gone, As that a Line, if straight, can be but one. ON THE SAME SUBJECT; Written upon another Occasion. I “Mankind's Redemption,” you are pleas'd to say, “By Jesus Christ was not the only Way That could succeed; indefinitely more Th' Almighty's Wisdom had within Its Store; By any chosen one of which, no doubt, The same Redemption had been brought about. II “For who shall dare,” you argue, “in this Case, To limit the Omnipotence of Grace; As if a finite Understanding knew What the Almighty could, or could not, do;— Though, since He chose this Method, we must own That our Dependence is on This alone?” III Now, Sir, acknowledging His Pow'r Immense, Beyond the Reach of all created Sense,— Does it not seem to follow thereupon, That His True Way must be directly One? To save the World He gave His Only Son; Therefore, by Him alone it could be done. IV Variety of Ways is the Effect Of finite View, that sees not the direct; But the Almighty, having all in View, Must be supposed to see and take it too,— To see at once, tho' we are in the dark, The one straight Line to the intended Mark. V Saint Paul's Assertion of “No other Name Giv'n under Heav'n,” appears to be the same With this: “No other Name or Pow'r could save But that of Jesus, which Jehovah gave.” More Sons, more Saviours, as consistent seem As more effective Methods to redeem. VI “I am the Way,” said Christ. There could not be, By just conclusion, any, then, but He. “I am the Truth.” Whence it appears anew, That no Way else could possibly be true. “I am the Life;” to which, as Adam died, Nothing could bring Mankind again beside. THOUGHTS ON IMPUTED RIGHTEOUSNESS, OCCASIONED BY READING THE REV. MR. HERVEY'S DIALOGUES BETWEEN THERON AND ASPASIO. A Fragment. “Imputed Righteousness!”—Belovèd Friend, To what Advantage can this Doctrine tend, If, at the same Time, a Believer's Breast Be not by real Righteousness possest; And if it be, why Volumes on it made With such a Stress upon “imputed” laid? Amongst the Disputants of later Days, This, in its Turn, became a fav'rite Phrase; When, much divided in religious Schemes, Contending Parties ran into Extremes. And now it claims th' Attention of the Age, In Hervey's elegant and lively Page; This his Aspasio labours to impress, With ev'ry Turn of Language and Address; With all the Flow of Eloquence that shines Thro' all his (full enough) embellish'd Lines. Tho' now so much exerting to confirm Its vast Importance, and revive the Term, He was himself, he lets his Theron know, Of diff'rent Sentiments not long ago; And Friends of yours, it has been thought, I find, Have brought Aspasio to his present Mind. Now, having read (but unconvinc'd, I own,) What various Reason for it he has shown, Or rather Rhetoric,—if it be true In any Sense that has appear'd to you, I rest secure of giving no Offence, By asking how you understand the Sense; By urging in a Manner frank and free What Reasons, as I read, occur to me, Why “Righteousness” for Man to rest upon Must be a “real,” not “imputed,” one. To shun much novel Sentiment and nice, I take the Thing from its apparent Rise. It should seem, then, as if “imputed Sin” Had made “imputed Righteousness” begin; The one suppos'd, the other, to be sure, Would follow after—like Disease and Cure. Let us examine, then, “imputed Guilt,” And see on what Foundation it is built. As our first Parents lost an heav'nly State, All their Descendents share their hapless Fate, Forewarn'd of God, when tempted, not to eat Of the forbidden Tree's pernicious Meat; Because incorporating mortal Leav'n Would kill of course in them the Life of Heav'n. They disobey'd, did Adam and his Wife, And died of Course to their true heav'nly Life. That Life thus lost, the Day they disobey'd, Could not by them be possibly convey'd. No other Life could Children have from them But what could rise from the parental Stem,— That Love of God alone Which we adore The Life so lost could possibly restore; Their Children could not, being born to Earth, Be born to Heaven but by an Heav'nly Birth. God found a Way, explain it how we will, To save the human Race from endless Ill; To save the very disobeying Pair; And made their whole Posterity His Care. Has this great Goodness any thing akin To God's “imputing” our first Parents' Sin To their unborn Posterity?—What Sense In such a strange and scriptureless Pretence? For the Men feel—so far we are agreed— The Consequences of a sinful Deed; Yet where ascrib'd by any sacred Pen But to the Doers is the Deed to Men; Where to be found in all the Scripture thro' This “Imputation,” thus advanc'd anew? Adam and Eve, by Satan's Wiles decoy'd, Did what the kind Commandment said “avoid.” To them with Justice, therefore, you impute The Sin of eating the forbidden Fruit; And ev'ry Imputation must in Fact, If just, be built on some preceding Act; Without the previous Deed suppos'd the Word Becomes unjust, unnatural, absurd. If, as you seem'd to think the other Day, All Adam's Race in some mysterious Way Sinn'd when he sinn'd, consented to his Fall,— With Justice then impute it to them all! But still it follows, that they all contract An Imputation founded upon Fact; And “Righteousness of Christ” in Christian Heirs Must be as deeply and as truly theirs, An Heav'nly Life in order to replace As was the Sin that made a guilty Race; So that “imputing” either Good or Ill Must presuppose a correspondent Will; Or else “Imputers” certainly must make Thro' Ignorance or other Cause Mistake. Old Eli thus, not knowing what to think, “Imputed” Hannah's silent Pray'r to Drink; Little supposing that it would prepare A Súccessor to him, her silent Pray'r. There may be other Meanings of the Phrase, To be accounted for in human Ways; But God's “imputing” to the future Child The Sin by which his Parents were beguil'd, Seems to establish an unrighteous Blame That brings no Honour to its Maker's Name. God's Honour, Glory, Majesty and Grace, I grant, is your Intention in the Case; But wish revolv'd in your impartial Thought, How far the Doctrine tends, when it is taught, To such an honest Purpose, and how far Justice and Truth may seem to be at War, If God “impute” to guiltless Children Crimes, Committed only in their Parents' Times. Pious Aspasio, I imagine, too, Had God's “resistless Sov'reignty” in View; The Charge of Puritan or other Name He scorn'd aright and, making Truth his Aim, Found it, he thought, in eminent Divines, Of whose Opinion these are the Outlínes.— They think, at least they seem to represent, That God in Honour upon Sin's Event Could not forgive the Sinners that had stray'd Without a proper Satisfaction made To His Offended Justice, and, because Upon their Breach of the Almighty's Laws None else was adequate to what was done, The Vengeance fell on His Belovèd Son, Who gave Himself to suffer in our Stead, And thus to Life again restor'd the dead; Because consistently with Justice then God could bestow His Mercy upon Men. Man had contracted in that fatal Day Debt so immense, that Man could never pay; He Who was God as well as Man, He could, And made the Satisfaction thro' His Blood,— Paid all the just Demand, “imputed” thus Our Sin to Him, His Righteousness to us.— This sets the Doctrine, if I take aright Their Words and Meaning, in the plainest Light. Now, since accounting for the Truth amiss May give Distaste in such an Age as this, And be a stumbling-block to them who might Receive an Explanation that was right,— Not as a captious Foe, but hearty Friend, May one entreat such Teachers to attend, And reconcile their System, if they can, To God's Proceeding with His Creature Man,— To that Paternal, Tender Love and Grace Which at Man's Fall immediately took Place,— That Inward, Holy Thing, inbreathèd then, Which would re kindle Heav'n in him again? Does “Wrath,” or “Vengeance,” or a “Want” appear “Of Satisfaction” or “of Payment” here In Man's Creator? For Mankind had He A purchas'd Grace, which contradicts a Free? Is it not plain, that an Unalter'd Love Sent Help to poor fall'n Creatures from Above, Unbargain'd, Unsolicited, Unmov'd But by Itself, as Its Exertion prov'd;— No foreign Promise, no “imputed” Ease, But Remedy as Real as Disease, That would, according to true Nature's Ground, Bring on the Cure, and make the Patient sound? That Christ, that God's becoming Man, was it, Your Friends with highest Gratitude admit; Whose utmost Talents are employ'd to show The Obligations that to Him we owe,— To press the Object of our Faith and Trust, Christ all in all, the Righteous and the Just, The “True Redeeming Life,”—essential this To ev'ry Christian who aspires to Bliss! Why not subjoin—I cite the Hero Paul, And make Appeal to Christians—“in you all,”— Form'd in you, dwelling in you, and within Regenerating Life, dethroning Sin; Working in more and more resignèd Wills The gradual Conquest of all selfish Ills; Till the true Christian to true Life revive, “Dead to the World, to God, thro' Him, alive?” What num'rous Texts from Paul, from ev'ry Saint, Might furnish our Citations, did we want, And could not see that Righteousness or Sin Arise not from without, but from within; That “Imputation,” where they are not found, Can reach no further than an empty Sound,— No further than “imputed” Health can reach The Cure of Sickness, tho' a Man should preach With all the Eloquence of Zeal and tell How Health “imputed” makes a sick Man well! Indeed, if Sickness be “imputed” too, “Imputed Remedy,” no Doubt, may do; Words may pour forth their entertaining Store, But Things are—just as Things were just before. In so important a Concern as that Which good Aspasio's Care is pointed at, A small Mistake which at the Bottom lies May sap the Building that shall thence arise. Who would not wish that Architect so skill'd On great Mistake might not persist to build, But strictly search and for sufficient While, If the Foundation could support the Pile? This “Imputation,” which he builds upon, Has been the Source of more Mistakes than one. Hence rose, to pass the intermediate Train Of growing Errors and observe the main, That worse than pagan Principle of Fate, Predestination's partial Love and Hate; By which, not tied like fancied Jove to look In stronger Destiny's decreeing Book, The God of Christians is suppos'd to will That some should come to Good, and some to Ill,— And for no Reason but to show, in fine, Th' Extent of Goodness and of Wrath Divine. Whose Doctrine this? I quote no less a Man Than the renownèd Calvin for the Plan; Who having labour'd with Distinctions vain “Mere Imputation” only to maintain, Maintains, when speaking on another Head, This horrid Thought, to which the former led: “Predestination here I call,” says he, Defining, “God's Eternal, Fix'd Decree, “Which having settl'd in His Will He pass'd,— “What ev'ry Man should come to at the last.” And lest the Terms should be conceiv'd to bear A Meaning less than he propos'd severe: “For all Mankind,” he adds to Definition, “Are not created on the same Condition;”— (“Pari Conditione” is the Phrase, If you can turn it any other Ways;)— “But Life to some eternal is restrain'd, “To some Damnation endless pre-ordain'd.” Calvin has push'd the Principle, I guess, To what your Friends would own to be Excess; And probably Aspasio, less inclin'd To run directly into Calvin's Mind, Would give “imputing” a more mod'rate Sense, That no “Damnation” might arise from thence; But how will mollifying Terms confute The fam'd Reformer's Notion of “impute”? If it confer such arbitrary Good, The dire Reverse is quickly understood,— So understood, that open Eyes may see 'Tis Calvin's Fiction, and not God's Decree,— Not His Whose Forming Love and Ruling Aid Ceaseless extends to all that He hath made; Who gave the Gift which He was pleas'd to give, That “none might perish, but that all might live,”— His Only Son, in Whom the Light That guides The born into the World to Life, resides,— A real Life, that by a real Birth Raises a Life beyond the Life of Earth In all His Children.—But no more to you, Better than me who know it to be true. And, if Aspasio's really humbl'd Soul Be by a touch of Garment-Hem made whole, He might, as I should apprehend, be sure That “Imputation” could not cause the Cure. When the poor Woman, in the Gospel, found “Touch of the Saviour's Clothes” to make her sound, We know the Virtue did from Him proceed That mix'd with Faith restor'd her, as we read. “Gone out of Him” obliges to infer, That 'twas by Faith attracted into her. A CONTRAST BETWEEN TWO EMINENT DIVINES. Two diff'rent Painters, Artists in their Way, Have drawn Religion in her full Display; To both she sat.—One gaz'd at her all o'er; The other fix'd upon her Features more: Hervey has figur'd her with ev'ry Grace That Dress could give;—but Law has hit her Face. ON THE NATURE OF FREE GRACE, AND THE CLAIM TO MERIT FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF GOOD WORKS. I Grace, to be sure, is in the last Degree The Gift of God, Divinely pure and free; Not bought or paid for, merited or claim'd, By any Works of ours that can be nam'd. II What Claim or Merit, or withal to pay, Could Creatures have before creating Day? Gift of Existence is the Gracious one Which all the rest must needs depend upon. III All “boasting” then of Merit, all Pretence Of Claim from God, in a deserving Sense, Is in one Word “excluded” by St. Paul: “Whate'er thou hast, thou hast receiv'd it all.” IV But, sure, the Use of any Gracious Pow'rs Freely bestow'd may properly be ours; Right Application being ours to choose, Or, if we will be so absurd, refuse! V In this Respect what need to controvert The sober Sense of Merit or Desert? “Works,” it is said, “will have,”—and is it hard To say “deserve,” or “merit”—“their Reward.” VI Grace is the real saving Gift; but then Good Works are profitable unto Men. God wants them not; but, if our Neighbours do, Flowing from Grace, they prove it to be true. VII When human Words ascribe to human Spirit “Worthy,” “Unworthy,” “Merit” or “Demerit,” Why should Disputes forbid the Terms a place, Which are not meant to derogate from Grace? VIII All comes from God Who gave us first to live And all succeeding Grace; 'tis ours to “give To God Alone the Glory,” and to Man, Empow'r'd by Him, to do what Good we can. A SOLILOQUY ON READING A DISPUTE ABOUT FAITH AND WORKS. I What an excessive Fondness for Debate Does this dividing Faith from Works create! Some say, “Salvation is by Faith alone, Or else the Gospel will be overthrown;” Others for that same Reason place the Whole In Works, which bring Salvation to a Soul. II Gospel of Christ, consistently applied, Unites together what they both divide; It is itself indeed the very Faith That works by Love and saves a Soul from Wrath. A new Dispute should some third Party pave, Nor Faith, nor Works, but Love alone would save. III The Solifidian takes a Text from Paul, And “Works are good for Nothing, Faith is all;”— Doctrine which his Antagonist disclaims, And shows how Works must justify, from James. A Third in either soon might find a Place, Where Love is plainly the Exalted Grace. IV There is no End of jarring System found In thus contending not for Sense, but Sound,— For Sound, by which th' Inseparable Three Are so distinguish'd as to disagree; Altho' Salvation in its real Spring,— Faith, Work, or Love,—be one and the same Thing;— V One Pow'r of God, or Life of Christ within, Or Holy Spirit washing away Sin,— Not by Repentance only, or Belief Only that slights a penitential Grief And its meet Fruits, and justifies alone A full conceiv'd Assurance of its own;— VI Nor by Works only;—nor, tho' Paul above Both Faith and Works have lifted it, can Love Have, or desire to have, th' exclusive Claim In Men's Salvation to this only Fame. By All together Souls are sav'd from Ill, Whene'er they yield an unresisting Will. VII God has a Never-ceasing Will to save, And Men by Grace may savingly behave. This would produce less Fondness for a Sect, And more Concern about the main Effect; Then, Faith alone might save them from the Fall, As one good Word in Use that stood for all. VIII By native Union all the Blessèd Pow'rs Of Grace That makes Salvation to be ours, One in another, spring up in the Breast; No Soul is sav'd by one without the rest. Since, then, they all subsist in any one, Division ceases,—and Dispute is gone. THOUGHTS ON PREDESTINATION AND REPROBATION. A Fragment. Flatter me not with your “Predestination,” Nor sink my Spirits with your “Reprobation!” From all your high Disputes I stand aloof,— Your Pre-'s and Re-'s, your Destin-, and your Proof, And formal Calvinistical Pretence That contradicts all Gospel and good Sense. When God declares so often that He wills All sort of Blessings and no sort of Ills; That His Severest Purpose never meant “A Sinner's Death, but that he should repent;” For the whole World when His Belovèd Son Is said to do whatever He has done,— To become Man, to suffer, and to die, That all might live, as well as you and I,— Shall rigid Calvin after this, or you, Pretend to tell me that it is not true; But that eternal, absolute Decree Has damn'd beforehand either you, or me, Or anybody else; that God design'd, When He created, not to save Mankind, But only some? “The rest,” this Man maintain'd, “Were to decreed Damnation pre-ordain'd.”— No, Sir; not all your metaphysic Skill Can prove the Doctrine, twist it as you will. I cite the Man for Doctrine so accurst In Book the third, and Chapter twenty-first, Section the fifth,—an horrid, impious Lore That one would hope was never taught before. How it came after to prevail away, Let them who mince the “damning” Matter, say, And others judge, if any Christian Fruit Be like to spring from such a pagan Root. “Pagan,” said I? I must retract the Word; For the poor Pagans were not so absurd. Their Jupiter, of Gods and Men the King, Whenever he ordain'd an hurtful Thing, Did it, because he was oblig'd to look And act, as Fate had bid him in a Book. For Gods and Goddesses were subject then To dire Necessity as well as Men,— Compell'd to crush an Hero or a Town, As Destiny had set the Matter down. But in your Scheme 'tis God that orders Ill With Sov'reign Pow'r and with Resistless Will; He, in Whose Blessèd Name is understood The One Eternal Will to ev'ry Good, Is represented, tho' untied by Fate, With a Decree of damning to create Such as you term “the Vessels of his Wrath,” To “show his Pow'r,” according to your Faith. Just as if God, like some tyrannic Man, Would plague the World, to show them that He can; While others, (they, for Instance, of your Sect) Are “Mercy's Vessels,” precious and elect, Who think, God help them! to secure their Bliss By such a partial, fond Conceit as this! Talk not to me of Popery and Rome, Nor yet foretel its Babylonish Doom; Nor canonise reforming Saints of old, Because they held the Doctrine that you hold! For if they did, altho' of Saint-like Stem, In this plain Point we must reform from them. While freed from Rome, we are not tied, I hope, To what is wrong in a Geneva Pope; Nor what is right should Sirname supersede Of Luther, Calvin, Bellarmine, or Bede. Rome has been guilty of Excess, 'tis true,— And so have some of the Reformers too. If in their Zeal against the Roman Seat, Plucking up Tares, they pluck'd up also Wheat, Must we to Children, for what they have said Give this Predestination-Stone for Bread? Sir, it is worse, is your Predestination, Ten thousand Times than Transubstantiation. Hard is the Point that Papists have compil'd With Sense and Reason to be reconcil'd; But yet it leaves to our Conception still Goodness in God and Holiness of Will,— A Just, Impartial Government of all, A Saving Love, a Correspondent Call To ev'ry Man and, in the fittest Hour For him to hear, all offer'd Grace and Power; Which he may want, and have, if he will crave From Him Who willeth Nothing but to save. Whereas, this Reprobation Doctrine here Not only Sense and Reason would cashier, But take by its Pretext of sov'reign Sway All Goodness from the Deity away; Both Heav'n and Hell confounding with its Cant, Virtue and Vice, the Sinner and the Saint; Leaving by irresistible Decree And Purpose absolute, what Man shall be, Nothing in Sinners to detest so much, As God's Contrivance how to make them such! That ever Christians, blest with Revelation, Should think of His decreeing Men's Damnation,— The God of Love, the Fountain of all Good; “Who made,” says Paul, “all Nations of one Blood To dwell on Earth, appointing Time, and Place;”— And for what End this Pre-ordaining Grace? That they might seek, and feel after, and find The Life in God which God for Man design'd. “We are His Offspring;”—for in that Decree, The pagan Poet and St. Paul agree;— “We are His Offspring.”—Now, Sir, put the Case Of some great Man and his descending Race; Conceive this Common Parent of them all As willing some to stand and some to fall,— Master, suppose, of all their future Lot, Decreeing some to Happiness, some not; In some to bring his Kindness into View, To show in others what his Wrath can do; To lead the chosen Children by the Hand, And leave the rest to fall—who cannot stand. I might proceed, but that the smallest Sketch Shows an absurd and arbitrary Wretch, Treating his Offspring so as to forbid To think that ever God Almighty did,— To think that Creatures who are said to be “His Offspring” should be hurt by His Decree; Which had they always minded, Good alone, And not a Spark of Evil, had been known. For His Decree, Appointment, Order, Will, Predestinating Goodness, Pow'r and Skill, Is of Itself the Un-beginning Good, The pouring-forth of an Un-ending Flood Of Ever-flowing Bliss, which only rolls To fill His Vessels, His created Souls. Happy Himself, the true Divine Desire, The Love that flames thro' that Eternal Fire, Which generates in Him th' Eternal Light, Source of all Blessing to created Sight, Longs with an Holy Earnestness to spread The boundless Glories of Its Fountain Head; To raise the possibilities of Life Which rest in Him into a joyful Strife,— Into a feeling Sense of Him from Whom The various Gifts of various Blessings come. To bless is His Immutable Decree, Such as could never have begun to be; Decree (if you will use the word “decreed”) Did from His Love eternally proceed, To manifest the hidden Pow'rs that reign Through outward Nature's universal Scene; To raise up Creatures from its vast Abyss, Form'd to enjoy communicated Bliss; Form'd in their sev'ral Orders to extend Of God's Great Goodness Wonders without End. Who does not see that Ill of any Kind Could never come from an All-perfect Mind; That its Perception never could begin But from a Creature's voluntary Sin, Made in its Maker's Image and imprest With a free Pow'r of being ever blest,— From ev'ry Evil in itself so free That none could rise but by its own Decree? By a Volition opposite to all That God could will did Evil first befall, And still befalls; for all the Source of Ill Is Opposition to His Blessèd Will, And Union with It plainly understood To be the Source of ev'ry real Good. To certain Truths, which you can scarce deny, You bring St. Paul's Expressions in Reply; Some few obscurer Sayings prone to choose, Where he was talking to the Roman Jews. You never heed the num'rous Texts and plain, That will not suit with your “decreeing” Strain, Confirming God's Unalter'd Will to bless In Words as clear as Language can express. “Who willeth all Men to be sav'd,” is one, Too plain for Comment to be made upon; So that, if some be not the same as all, You must directly contradict St. Paul, Whene'er you push to its direct Extreme Your wild, absurd Predestination Scheme. Paul's open, generous, enlighten'd Soul Preach'd to Mankind a Saviour of the Whole, Not Part of, human Race; the blinded Jew Might boast himself in this conceited View,— Boast of his Father Abraham and vent The carnal Claims of Family Descent; But the whole Family of Heav'n and Earth, Paul knew, if blest, must have another Birth; That Jew and Gentile was in ev'ry Place Alike the Object of a Saving Grace. Paul never tied Salvation to a Sect; “All who love God” with him are “God's Elect.” This plain, good Maxim he himself premis'd To those fam'd Chapters which were so disguis'd By studied Comments of a later Day, When Words were prest to serve a partial Fray, And Scripture turn'd into a Magazine Of Arms for sober or for frantic Spleen. “All who love God;”—how certain is the Key, Whate'er disputed Passages convey! In Paul's Epistles if some Things are read, “Hard to be understood,” as Peter said, Must this be urg'd to prove in Men's Condition Their “Pre-election” and their “Præterition,” Or “Pre-damnation?” For that monstrous Word, Of all absurd “Decree” the most absurd, Is into formal Definition wrought By your Divines,—unstartled at the Thought Of Sov'reign Power decreeing to become The Author of Salvation but to some;— To some, resembling others, they admit, Who, are rejected,—why? “He so thought fit; “Hath not the Potter Pow'r to make his Clay Just what he pleases?”—Well, and tell me, pray, What Kind of Potter must we think a Man, Who does not make the best of it he can; Who, making some fine Vessels of his Clay, To show his Pow'r, throws all the rest away, Which in itself was equally as fine? What an Idéa this of Pow'r Divine! Happy for us, if under God's Commands We were as Clay is in the Potter's Hands; Pliant and yielding readily to take The proper Form which He is pleas'd to make! Happy for us that He has Pow'r; because An equal Goodness executes Its Laws, Rejecting none butsuch as will behave So as that no Omnipotence can save! Who can conceive the Infinitely Good To show less Kindness than He really could,— To pre-concert Damnation and confine Himself, His own Beneficence Divine? An Impotency this, in evil Hour Ascrib'd to God's Beatifying Pow'r By bitter Logic and the sour Mistake Which overweening Zeal is apt to make,— Describing Sov'reignty as incomplete, That does not show itself less Good than Great! Tho' true in earthly Monarchs it may be That Majesty and Love can scarce agree, In His Almighty Will, Who rules above, The Pow'r is Grace, the Majesty is Love. What best describes the Giver of all Bliss, Glorious in all His Attributes, is this; The Sov'reign Lord all Creatures bow before, But they who love Him most, the most adore. From this one Worship if a Creature's Heart, Fixt on aught else, determines to depart, There needs no “pre-determining” the Case; Idolatry ensues, and Fall from Grace. Without, and contrary to, God's Intent, Its own Self-ruin is the sure Event; The Love forsaken Which alone could bless, It needs must feel Wrath, Anger and Distress,— The Sensibilities that must arise, If Nature wants what Sacred Love supplies. [Cætera desunt.] THE POTTER AND HIS CLAY; An Hymn Ascribed to Dr. Watts. THE CONTRAST. I Behold the Potter and the Clay! He forms His Vessels to His Mind; So did Creating Love display Itself in forming human Kind. II Th' Almighty Workman's Pow'r and Skill Could have no vile, but noble, Ends; His One Immutable Good-Will To all that He hath made extends. III This Gracious Sov'reign Lord on High By His Eternal Word and Voice Chose all to live, and none to die; Nor will He ever change His Choice. IV Not by His Will, but by their own, Vile Rebels break His Righteous Laws, And make the Terror to be known Of which they are themselves the Cause. V His All-electing Love employs All means the human Race to bless, That Mortals may His Heav'nly Joys By re-electing Him possess. VI Shall Man reply, that “God decreed Fall'n Adam's Race not to be blest; That for a few His Son should bleed, And Satan should have all the rest?” VII Do thou, poor sinful Soul of mine, By Faith and Penitence, embrace Of Doubtless, Boundless Love Divine The Free, the Universal Grace! VIII Let God within thy pliant Soul, Renew the Image of His Son; The Likeness marr'd will then be Whole, And show what He in Christ has done. AN ARGUMENT FOR DAVID'S BELIEF OF A FUTURE STATE, INFERRED FROM BATHSHEBA'S LAST WORDS TO HIM UPON HIS DEATH-BED. I If David knew not of a future Life, How understood he Bathsheba his Wife; Who, when he lay upon his Death-bed, came To plead for Solomon's succeeding claim; And, having prosper'd in her own Endeavour, Said: “Let my Lord, King David, live for ever?” II What real Wish was Bathsheba's Intent, If Life hereafter was not what she meant? Say, that “for ever” to a King in Health Meant a long Life, Prosperity and Wealth,— To one that lay a-dying, you must own, 'Twould be a mere Burlesque upon his Throne. III If she had pray'd for David's mild Release, Or, “Let my Lord the King depart in Peace,”— Tho' even then 'twere difficult to stint Her utmost Thought to so minute a Hint,— The short-liv'd Comment might have some Pretence; But “Live for ever” has no Sort of Sense;— IV Unless we grant her Meaning to extend To future Life, that never has an End. Piety will, and Reason must, confess That her Intention never could be less. “King, live for ever,” and “God save the King,”— Old or new Phrase,—Salvation is the Thing;— V No poor Salvation to be quickly past, And with a deadly Exit at the last,— To which when David was so near, what Share Could he enjoy of “Live for ever” Pray'r, Had he not known what Bathsheba design'd,— A Life to come of everlasting Kind? VI Tho' num'rous Proofs might readily be brought That this was always holy David's Thought,— Yet, since by learnèd and long-winded Ways Men seek to break the Force of ancient Phrase, I single out this plain, familiar one.— Now, give as plain an Answer thereupon! AN EXPOSTULATION WITH A ZEALOUS SECTARIST, WHO INVEIGHED IN BITTER TERMS AGAINST THE CLERGY AND CHURCH INSTITUTIONS. No, Sir; I cannot see to what good End Such bitter Words against the Clergy tend, Pour'd from a Zeal so sharp, so unallay'd, That suffers no Exception to be made; While the most mild Persuasions to repress The bitter Zeal still heighten its Excess. Its own relentless Thought while it pursues, What unrestrain'd Expressions it can use! Places of Worship, which the People call Churches, are “Synagogues of Satan” all; At all liturgic Pray'r and Praise it storms, As “Man's Inventions, Spirit-quenching Forms;” And, from baptismal down to burial Rite, Sets ev'ry Service in an odious Light; All previous Order, with regard to Time, Place, or Behaviour, passes for a Crime. Of “Pharisaic Pride” it culls the Marks, To represent the Bishop and his Clerks; Who are, if offer'd any gentler Plea, “The Devil's Ministers,” both He and They; “Blind Guides,” “false Prophets,” and a lengthen'd Train Of all hard Words that chosen Texts contain. These are the Forms which, when it would object To those in Use, it pleases to select, Repeated by its Devotees at once As like to Rote as any Church Response. Nor is a Treatment of this eager Kind To this or that Society confin'd, Sect, or Profession,—no, no Matter which, “Leaders” or “led,” all “fall into the Ditch;” None but its own severe Adepts can claim Of Truth and Spirit-Worshippers the Name. In vain it seeks by any sacred Page To justify this unexampled Rage. Prophets of old, who spake against th' Abuse Of outward Forms, were none of them so loose As to condemn, abolish or forbid The Things prescrib'd; but what the People did, Who minded nothing but the mere Outside, Neglecting wholly what it signified,— At this Neglect the Prophets all exclaim'd. No pious Rites has any of them blam'd; Their true Intent was only to reduce All outward Practice to its inward Use. The World's Redeemer, coming to fulfil All past Predictions of prophetic Quill,— Who more amidst the Jewish priestly Pride Than He with all Mosaic Rites complied? Say, that the Christian Priests are now as bad As those blind Leaders which the Jews then had;— Was Zacharias', Simeon's, Anna's Mind, Any good Priest, or Man or Woman, blind To offer Incense, or to bear a Part In Temple Service with an upright Heart? Can then the Faults of Clergymen or Lay Destroy Heart-Worship at this present Day? Will Pray'r, in vain by Pharisees preferr'd, Not from repenting Publicans be heard? Will the devout amongst the Christian Flock Not be accepted, tho' the Priest should mock? If they do right in their appointed Spheres, His Want of Truth and Spirit is not Theirs. Our Lord's Apostles, with an inward View To reconcile the Gentile and the Jew, To Faith in Him made ev'ry outward Care The most subservient to that main Affair. The greatest Friend to Christian Freedom, Paul, Intent to save, was “ev'rything to All.” To keep, whatever Forms should rise or cease, “Union of Spirit in the Bond of Peace,” Th' Effects of hasty, rash, condemning Zeal He saw, and mourn'd, and labour'd to repeal. Succeeding Saints, when Priest or Magistrate Became tyrannical in Church or State, Reprov'd their evil Practices, but then Rever'd the Office, tho' they blam'd the Men. They gave no Instance of untemper'd Heat That roots up all before it, Tares or Wheat,— As if, by humanly invented Care Of Cultivation, Wheat itself was Tare. 'Tis true, all Sects are grown corrupt enough, But Zeal so indiscriminately rough May well give others Reason to suspect Some want of Knowledge in a Novel Sect (If such there be) that seems to take a Pride In satanising all the World beside, Without the least Authority yet known, Or Species of Example but its own. One Mischief is, that its unguarded Terms Hurt many sober Truths which it affirms. “Worship in Truth and Spirit” suffers too By being plac'd in such a hostile View. “Oh, but all self-will Worshipping is wrong!”— True; but to whom does that Defect belong? Is the Obedience to a Rule or Guide, For Order's Sake, fair Proof of such a Pride? If it be none at all for Men to broach Rude, harsh and undistinguishing Reproach, With Resolution to repeat it still,— Pray, by what Marks are we to know Self-Will? ON THE FALL OF MAN; Occasioned by the following Representation of that Event: —“Neither can it seem strange, that God should lay Stress on such outward Actions, in their own Nature neither good nor evil, when we consider, that in all his Dispensation to Mankind he has done the same. What was it he made the Test of Adam's Obedience in Paradise, but the eating of a Fruit? An Action in itself perfectly indifferent, and from which, if God had not forbidden it, it would have been Superstition to have abstained.” (A Persuasive to Conformity, addressed to the Quakers by John Rogers, D.D., p. 28.) I Of Man's Obedience, while in Eden blest, What a mere Trifle is here made the Test,— An outward Action, in itself defin'd To be of “perfectly indiff'rent” Kind; Which, but for God's Forbidding Threat Severe, It had been “Superstition” to forbear! II A strange Account, that neither does nor can Make any Part of true Religion's Plan, But must expose it to the Ridicule Of Scoffers, judging by this crooked Rule! Its Friends, defending Truth, as they suppose, Lay themselves open to acuter Foes. III To say that “Action neither good nor bad, From which no Harm in Nature could be had, Was chang'd by Positive, Commanding Will, Or Threat Forbidding, to a deadly Ill,” Charges by Consequence the most direct On God Himself that Ill and its Effect. IV Language had surely come to a poor Pass, Before an Author of distinguish'd Class For shining Talents could endure to make In such a Matter such a gross Mistake,— Could thus derive Death's Origin and Root From “Adam's eating of an harmless Fruit!” V “From Adam's eating?—Did not God forbid The Taste of it to Adam?”—Yes, He did.— “And was it harmless, must we understand, To disobey God's positive Command?”— No, by no Means; but then the Harm, we see, Came not from God's Command, but from the Tree! VI If He command, the Action must be good; If He forbid, some Ill is understood. The Tree, the Fruit, had dreadful Ills conceal'd Not made by His Forbidding, but reveal'd; That our first Parents by a true Belief Might know enough to shun the fatal Grief. VII The dire Experience of a World of Woe Forbidding Mercy will'd them not to know; Told them what Ill was in the false Desire Which their free Wills were tempted to admire; That of such Fruit the Eating was “to die.” Its “harmless” Nature was the Tempter's Lie. VIII To urge it now, and to impute the Harm Of Death and Evil to the kind Alarm Of God's Command, so justly understood To will His Creatures Nothing else but Good, Is for a Babel Fiction to resign Right Reason, Scripture and the Love Divine. ON JONATHAN EDWARDS' ENQUIRY CONCERNING FREEWILL. “Jonathan Edwards, by this book's edition, Appears to be a dry metaphysician.” (In Mr. N.'s own letter.) — Well might I Be disappointed by a book so dry,— So sapless dry,—who cherish no opinion Of Calvinistic cobwebs, or Arminian! “To sweep away the last was the design Of this distinguished, favourite divine,— His principal intention.”—Be it so; This was no part of my concern to know,— No part of my expectancy to find,— Whose hopes, though faint, were of a diff'rent kind. Something, I fancied, worth attending to Might probably enough occur to view Within a work which so sincere a friend To what he thought was right did so commend. If, when for want of time to reconcile Our thoughts in one short conversation, while I asked what author he supposed, if read, Would best explain his notions, he had said,— “I'll send you one of the New-England sages, Who in four hundred full octavo pages Has by his dry and metaphysic skill Demolish'd ev'ry meaning of Free-Will, But brought in dire Necessity's behoof Less obvious, less experimental proof,— Leaving in this attempt the usual way Of writing which his other books display:”— Such a description (and his words contain No less, you see, if suffer'd to speak plain,) Might have diminish'd the profound surprise Which in my mind would naturally rise Without the help of such a previous hint From dry Enquiry's metaphysic print. Without disparaging the works unknown, I really could not relish this, I own; Nor cease to wonder how your neighbour could Who had himself said many things so good In sermons far surpassing, if one looks, All such polemically wither'd books.— In this, too oft instead of the divine The wrangling soph. appears along the line,— The trifling shuffler of distinctions round; All sense of words still fashion'd to confound All obvious thoughts concerning good and ill Through mere aversion to a man's Free-Will; Which, oft confess'd in phrases tantamount, The tedious page still rambles to discount Its metaphysical conceits among, Dry as the cobwebs which they sweep along. “The book has been in print for many years, And yet no answer, 'tis observ'd, appears.” But would our honest friend consider why, Its very dryness might forbid reply; And metaphysics, such as it pursues, Require some patience even to peruse. Want of an answer he could scarce object, Since by their own voluminous defect Some books may possibly be deem'd too bad For any formal answer to be had. But, take the book, who likes it?—Mr. N. Himself, for me, has much the better pen; And were his better sense but once untied From partial systems upon ev'ry side, He would soon see that gratitude of mind Did not require God's Grace to be confin'd, And not to show like favour in like case, In order more to magnify the Grace;— As if it wanted, for a foil, to doom Its equal needers to eternal gloom! “If I had been,” says he, “but for the pow'r Of Grace bestow'd, blasphemer to this hour,— This Grace to me if God is pleas'd to grant, Not to some others who have equal want,— I am, I think, in equal case of need Peculiarly favour'd; which indeed I rather would admire than dispute. And after all what harm can be the fruit Of happy change ascribed to Him alone, And to His Goodness rather than my own?” Doubtless all praise to God Alone is due For happy change; but is it therefore true That this Good God refuses to admit The change in others, in all points so fit For such a blessing? Will This Father leave One child without, that can or will receive? Is a self-righteousness so much amiss, That makes man's merit greater than it is, And a self-favour'dness from danger free That, clinging to its own peculiar me, Cries, “God, I thank Thee, that I am supplied With Grace, to other men like me denied?” Let Mr. N. consider what is done— It is his own allusion—by the sun! Unchang'd itself, it shines with equal day On equal fitness to receive its ray. All Calvinistic or Arminian strain Is cobweb search; a principle so plain Sets this, on which he goes, in its true light: “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” MISCELLANEOUS PIECES, CONSISTING OF THOUGHTS ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS, FRAGMENTS, EPIGRAMS, &amp;c. The Ways of God. With peaceful Mind thy Race of Duty run; God Nothing does, or suffers to be done, But what thou would'st Thyself, if thou could'st see Through all Events of Things as well as He. Natural Knowledge and Heavenly Wisdom. Natural Knowledge is a Moonshine Light, And dreaming Sages still keep sleeping by't; But Heav'nly Wisdom like the rising Sun Awakens Nature,—and good Works are done. Repentance. Let thy Repentance be without Delay!— If thou defer it to another Day, Thou must repent for a Day more of Sin, While a Day less remains to do it in. The Cost of being Religious. To be religious, something it will cost,— Some Riches, Honours, Pleasures will be lost; But if thou countest the Sum total o'er, Not to be so will cost a great deal more. Works without Love. He that does Good with an unwilling Mind, Does that to which he is not well inclin'd. 'Twill be Reward sufficient for the Fact, If God shall pardon his obedient Act. Disappointments. If outward Comforts without real Thought Of any inward Holiness are sought, God disappoints us oft,—and kindly too; To make us holy is His Constant View. Desire. Think, and be careful what thou art within; For there is Sin in the Desire of Sin. Think, and be thankful, in a diff'rent Case; For there is Grace in the Desire of Grace. Prayer. Pray'r does not ask, or want, the Skill and Art Of forming Words, but a devoted Heart. If thou art really in a Mind to pray, God knows thy Heart and all that it would say. Content. Content is better, all the Wise will grant, Than any earthly Good that thou canst want; And Discontent, with which the Foolish fill Their Minds, is worse than any earthly Ill. The Rewards of the Contented. Two Heav'ns a right contented Man surround,— One here, and one hereafter, to be found: One in his own meek Bosom here on Earth, And one in Abraham's at his future Birth. Faith and Charity. No Faith towards God can e'er subsist with Wrath Tow'rds Man, nor Charity with want of Faith. From the same Root hath each of them it's Growth; You have not either, if you have not both. Faith, Hope and Love. Faith is the burning Ardour of Desire; Hope is the Light arising from its Fire; Love is the Spirit That, proceeding thence, Completes all Virtue in a Christian Sense. Faith and Works. Nor Steel nor Flint alone produces Fire; No Spark arises till they both conspire. Nor Faith alone, nor Work without, is right; Salvation rises, when they both unite. Zeal and Meekness. Zeal without Meekness like a Ship at Sea To rising Storms may soon become a Prey; And Meekness without Zeal is like the same, When a dead Calm stops every sailing Aim. Procrastination. If Gold be offer'd thee, thou dost not say, “To-morrow I will take it, not To-day.” Salvation offer'd, why art thou so cool, To let thyself become To-morrow's Fool? True and False Inspiration. “An heated Fancy or Imagination May be mistaken for an Inspiration.”— True; but is this Conclusion fair to make, That Inspiration must be all Mistake? “A Pebble-stone is not a Diamond.”—True; But must a Diamond be a Pebble too? Hypocricy. Hypocrites in Religion form a Plan That makes them hateful both to God and Man: By seeming Zeal they lose the World's Esteem,— And God's, because they are not what they seem. Abasement. An humble Man, tho' all the World assault To pull him down, yet God will still exalt; Nor can a proud by all the World's Renown Be lifted up,—for God will pull him down. The Recompense of Charity. He is no Fool, who charitably gives What he can only look at whilst he lives,— Sure as he is to find, when hence he goes, A Recompense which he can never lose. Interest upon Charity. If giving to poor People be to lend Thy Money to the Lord, who is their Friend, The highest Int'rest upon Int'rest sure Is to let out thy Money to the Poor. The Season for Watching. When Grief or Joy shall press upon thee hard, Be then especially upon thy Guard! Then is most Danger of not acting right; A calmer State will give a surer Light. Worldliness. If we mind nothing but the Body's Pride, We lose the Body and the Soul beside; If we have nothing but the Earth in View, We lose the Earth and Heav'nly Riches too. Sinners. “He is a Sinner,” you are pleas'd to say. Then love him for the Sake of Christ, I pray. If on his gracious Words you place your Trust,— “I came to call the Sinners, not the Just,”— Second his Call; which if you will not do, You'll be the greater Sinner of the two. The Spirit of Prayer and Thanksgiving. Pray'r and Thanksgiving is the vital Breath That keeps the Spirit of a Man from Death; For Pray'r attracts into the living Soul The Life That fills the universal Whole; And giving Thanks is breathing forth again The Praise of Him Who is the Life of Men. A Deaf and Dumb God. To own a God who does not speak to Men, Is first to own and then disown again; Of all Idolatry the total Sum Is having Gods that are both deaf and dumb. The Love and the Fear of God. Love does the Good which God commands to do; Fear shuns the Ill which He prohibits too. They both describe, tho' by a diff'rent Name, A Disposition of the Mind the same. The Mote and the Beam. I Why should I be so eager to espy The Mote that swims upon my Brother's Eye, And still forget, as if I had not known, The dark'ning Beam that overspreads my own? II O let me play the Hypocrite no more, But strive to cure my own obstructed Sight; Then shall I see much clearer than before To set my undiscerning Brother right! On the Epicurean, Stoic and Christian Philosophy. I Three diff'rent Schemes Philosophers assign,— A Chance, a Fate, a Providence Divine. Which to embrace of these three sev'ral Views, Methinks, it is not difficult to choose. II For, first: what Wisdom, or what Sense, to cry, “Things happen as they do,—we know not why?” Or how are we advanc'd one Jot, to know, “When Things once are,” that “they must needs be so?” III To see such Order, and yet own no Laws,— Feel such Effects, and yet confess no Cause,— What can be more extravagant and odd? He only reasons who believes a God. An Epigram, On the Blessedness of Divine Love. Faith, Hope and Love were question'd what they thought Of future Glory which Religion taught.— Now, Faith believ'd it firmly to be true, And Hope expected so to find it too; Love answer'd, smiling with a conscious Glow: “Believe? Expect? I know it to be so.” TRANSLATED VERSE. THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL. BOOK THE FIRST. Brute Creatures upon Earth enjoy the Store That Nature yields, and never seek for more. Sagacious Man, with huge Desire to know Whence Things, their Causes and Connexions flow, Takes a vain Course;—Death with black Wing is near, And stops him in the Midst of his Career. Why this, if God created naught in vain? Why should the Mind the Seeds of Heav'n contain, Not to produce the Fruit? What Profit brings To search, to understand the Cause of Things,— Thro' all below, thro' all above, the Sky, Sun, Moon, and Stars, to penetrate,—and die? If Death be all that follows Life's Parade, Better to fool with Phyllis in the Shade; To take the jovial Glass, the merry Dance; To banish Care—and trust ourselves to Chance! All Sense of Past, all Fear of future, Day Let Wine, Diversions, Banquets drive away; Let Cloë sing, Neæra touch the Lyre,— Snatch present Joys, nor what's to come enquire! In vain, alas, the Precept to enjoy; Scarce do we taste the Pleasures, but they cloy. Let Trifles, then, be seriously dismiss'd; Have Wealth as great, or glory as you list,— Ambition prosperous as it can be,— Surrounding Crowds attend at your Levee,— What more you please:—'tis all but one same Call To cry: “Alas! What Vanity 'tis all!” Where must we go then? To what friendly Shore? So, pent in Bodies, Minds would fain explore Where Truth's eternal Mansions may be found, Whither (so Nature tells them) they are bound. Mind was not made for transitory Joys, But Bliss congenial that no Change destroys,— Bliss, like itself, for ever to endure. Take Courage then—the Works of God are sure, Nor wrought in vain; nor shall the Limits bind Of this corporeal mortal Clay the Mind! Clear she shall flourish from terrestrial Stain,— For ever flourish, free'd from ev'ry Chain; Her kindred Heav'n th' old Native shall review, And drink of Truth's eternal Spring anew,— The vital Draught nectareous, and recruit Her deathless Vigour with perennial Fruit. Here,—in this Life, if it deserve the Name This—in the Husk of a corporeal Frame— Unspread her Wing, unrous'd her vivid Force, Yet much the Token of her ancient Source,— How does she so remember, how deduce, From Things dispos'd such Order and such Use? So rich a Treasure, so immense a Train, Corporeal Stowage little could contain, Less reproduce; such Privilege the Part Of Mind—Inventress of the various Art— That taught to needy Life Grace and Defence, Gave Names to Things, and tied a vocal Sense To Letters; brought the wild dispersed Clowns From brutish Rambling to abide in Towns; Tam'd them by Laws, united by Consent. What, by all this, but Force Diviner meant,— But Sense Ethereal, Spirit above Death; Virtue excited by Celestial Breath? What Pow'r enlivens eloquent Discourse To flow, to thunder, with such rapient Force? Is it not, think ye, more than mortal Fire? The Bards—what animates their sacred Quire? For whether Verse well turn'd, canorous, clear, With varied Sweetness lapse into the Ear, Or imaging the Truth by Fiction's Aid, With fabl'd Wonders winningly display'd, Rove thro' the inmost Heart—the Bard meantime Breathes nothing little, nothing not sublime. Whilst here on Earth the things that we behold, All in the same revolving Circle roll'd, Tell not the Mind that looks for ampler Dues; The sacred Bard presents sublimer Views,— A fairer Scene, of ev'ry Wish the Sum,— The Hope, the Presage of a Life to come. If skill'd celestial Motions how to solve, How the huge Planets round the Sun revolve,— Thro' the vast Void to trace the Comet's Line, When other Suns on other Planets shine,— Is not this high, this Heav'n-pervading Mind Come down from Heav'n, from Heav'n again design'd? Plain, in these Efforts of the Mind to see A Force innate, from Dregs material free; Self-conscious Will too, Love and Hatred shown, Fear, Hope, Joy, Grief, are plainly all her own,— No lumpish Properties; she can compare Or sep'rate things by merely mental Care; Can gather distant Truths and reunite The scatter'd Portions in one friendly Light: Draw hence the Cause of Things and the Design, And in fair Order Arts with Arts combine, More near to Truth still rising and more near, Till the whole causal Serïes appear. The Chain descending from th' Almighty's Throne, From Heav'n to Earth—Ideas, too, her own— She can inspect, and inward Notice take Whence, how, they rise—and almost know her Make. Is Pow'r corporeal such? Machines, do they Know their own Strength, or on what Food to prey? For Body is but mere Machine alone, Mov'd by external Impulse—not its own. Judge not by vulgar Men the noble Mind, But such as Worth to future Praise consign'd; As Rome or Greece,—ev'n now illustrious dead— Or England, unsurpass'd by either, bred;— The Nurse of Heroes, in her better Times, What Bards have blest her with diviner Rimes; With Laws what Sages; how many renown'd For Eloquence, for Science, has she found, Tho' brought to Light by Culture late begun; When Bacon, rising like th' ethereal Sun, First taught the Path of Arts,—first made appear Philosophy from idle Figments clear; And tracing Step by Step the faithful Ray, Where the sure Guide Experience led the Way, To Newton, born her Treasures to command, He show'd the Track and gave the Torch in Hand! Illustrious Souls! May your Example move Britannia's Sons still further to improve; To high Attempts th' awaken'd Mind to raise, And by true Virtue merit ancient Praise! Not without Heav'n, with Genius so sublime, Could Man be born;—but God, in ev'ry Time, Has here and there, like Stars amidst the Night, Besprinkl'd Minds of more Resplendent Light; That a degen'rate Age might catch the Flame And own from what High Origin Man came. Besides, a Something for us is confest, When we are dead, in ev'ry conscious Breast; 'Tis shown within 'tis ancient Learning's Thought; 'Tis public Voice—no Nation so untaught As all beyond the Grave to disregard! Hence Oaks, slow-growing, posthumous Reward, Are sown for Grandsons' Profit; hence appears The Pyramid that braves the gazing Years; Hence all the Care about a living Name, When Men are dead; so valued future Fame, That who excels in any Thing will run Thro' evr'y Danger, no Fatigue will shun, If only some fair Prospect of Renown Flatter, from Age to Age descending down! Do not we see that Convicts, doom'd to die, Confess their Guilt, sometimes perhaps deny At instant Death—why willing, or why loth? The Future only can account for both; While Penitents discern, and dread the Lot, The harden'd Rogue has all but Fame forgot: 'Tis Nature's Instinct, or obscure or plain, Of more than Dust and Ashes to remain! Why about Funerals such anxious Care What means of Tombs the operose Affair? Some lay the bloodless Carcass in the Ground, And deck the Grove with Flow'rs, each annual Round Renewing Rites that Ashes scarce require,— Some rear the Pile, and burn it in the Fire; Then place the Relics of the Friend they burn To last for Ages in the faithful Urn. Where Nile's rich Flood the fertile Grounds o'erflow'd, Neither to burn nor bury was the Mode. They fill'd th' unbowell'd Chest and emptied Scull With thick, bituminous Confection full; In spicy Pitch when thus embalm'd they roll'd The Corpse with close drawn Fillets, many a Fold; Preserv'd the Shape, or what they could at least, And on the Surface pictur'd the Deceas'd. Such inbred Hope and Trust in Men alive, That something after Death is to survive; One Truth exprest by ev'ry outward Art: Nor Time, nor Fate, can kill our better Part. See in the Realms where Indian Ganges rolls A Race of Men with too too eager Souls, Of Life impatient, rush into the Fire, Or at their Idol Shrines from Life retire. Tho' blind, to Hopes of quiet Seats they run Of Spring perpetual and unclouded Sun. Not less renown'd in Fame, the Eastern Wives To their dead Husbands sacrifice their Lives. Their Loss no womanish Complaint proclaims; They mount the Pile, and join them in the Flames: Each hopes, Companion to her dear-lov'd Spouse In other Regions to renew her Vows. See in the North with equal Ardour glow Unconquer'd Nations in eternal Snow; Whom, with untam'd Contempt of Living fierce, Nor Foe can vanquish nor can War coerce! They love their Country,—Love's Reward their Aim, Thro' Fires and Swords they push the patriot claim. Add what old Times of Fields Elysian spake, Of Phlegethontic Wave and Stygian Lake,— Fictions of Priestly Fraud—be that the Case; 'Twas inbred Notice that gave Fraud a Place; Sure of the Future tho' imperfect View, All Fiction builds on Something that is true. Because 'tis difficult to think of Mind From Body and from grosser Sense disjoin'd, Corporeal Form to it the Vulgar give, And Looks, and Limbs, and Place wherein to live,— To wonted Likeness fashioning their Schemes; Which others holding for delirious Dreams, (The How not known of its surviving state) Deem it extinguish'd by one common Fate,— Or that they care not for much Cost of Thought, Or shame to own their Ignorance of aught! If true from false not easy to discern, Shake off all Sloth then, nor refuse to learn, For any Tales that Fraud has interspers'd Or some vain Poets petulantly vers'd! What! Is not God's Existence own'd by all,— Consent, which rightly Nature's Voice they call? And yet, what false unworthy Notions fram'd,— Sex, Passions, Vices; Gods a Number nam'd; Scarce any Object of their Hopes or Fears But what Men deified in former years! Such as they lik'd for Gods propitious pass'd, Sinistrous else; till Madness, at the last, With reptile Deities their Temples stor'd, And even Leeks and Onions were ador'd. Pond'ring these Ills, the great Athenian Sage Foretold His Coming in the destin'd Age, (He came, desir'd; the Nations, since He came, The Help and Advent of a God proclaim) Whose Divine Light should give dark Minds the Day Guide them to Truth and mark the certain Way. Meanwhile, full many Signs of Truth to Sight Had Nature shown, tho' through obscurer Light. Let us then, see how far Conjectures rise, Nor Reasons Help, if it can give, despise! Body and Mind agree, I don't deny, In many Things—it is their mutual Tie: But Mind in many differs, that define Her Nature different and her Race Divine. We often see to Body firm and strong, Healthy, robust, a feeble Mind belong; To weak, full oft one of surprising Force; If Death together kill them both, of Course They both should sicken in the same Degree,— Reverse again of what we often see; That, when Death comes, the cold approaching Hour Sharpens the Mind and warms with entheous Pow'r. What Eloquence have dying Men, what Fire! They speak prophetic Words—and then expire. If Mind like Body elemental, whence, Tho' Sleep shut up the Inlets of all Sense, Without external Objects can the Mind On inward Scenes expatiate unconfined; Just as a Bird, uncag'd, takes Wing to fly, Mounts upward and exults in open Sky? Mind of corporeal Nature, it is plain, Must Parts in Number infinite contain, Each one of which will have its Sense and Soul, And many diff'rent Minds distract the Whole. In such a System, grant it to exist, Say how can Truth and Equity subsist,— How Life's one Tenor in the jarring Host, And this same conscious Virtue that we boast? Perhaps this Mind, this Matter's Force occult, May from its Figure and its Site result? As if the Square was wiser than the Round! Parts you may add, diminish, or compound; But Site, and Figure, for the mental Track No more accounts than Colour, white or black. Motion may do't—what will not Motion do? Yes—Reason, Speech, and Will, and Wisdom too, Is all but Rope and Pulley—proper Size,— And last, his Top, the Lad will make it wise! So will the Liquor, boiling in the Pot, With flowing Eloquence grow richly hot. But whence comes Motion? Mind is the one Thing, Not passive Body, that is Motion's Spring: As God the World, so its corporeal Frame Mind agitates, and inward moving Aim. Cease then to wonder, when the Body's gone, That living Mind continues to live on! What Death, I rather wonder, with what Darts, Can e'er destroy it, since it has no Parts? It cannot perish by external Blow; It is the Mover of itself, we know; And that which Motion to itself can give, Leaves not itself—it must for ever live. But who can well conceive a Thing to be, From certain Shape and Situation free? What then is Deity? The Mind Divine, Far as we know, no Figure can confine Or Place contain,—unless you will suppose That God Himself is Matter;—if He knows, Pure Simple Spirit, Grossness of no Kind, No more does God's fair Image, human Mind. Mark its Self-Pollency; what greater Sign Of Breath Ethereal, Progeny Divine? Ev'n here, while tether'd to this mortal Shape, Oft, on the Stretch, it meditates Escape; Like a strange Guest on Earth, from foreign Ties Springs up and longs to reach its native Skies. Go now, admire a World of fading Things; Fly, busy Insect, with thy gilded Wings; Feed on its Dews and flutter in its Air; Soon to be Nothing, of aught else despair! Is this the whole of Life,—thus void of Hope, Of all its flatt'ring Promise this the Scope? How much more real that, that Life of Man, Where truth at once discovers all its Plan; Not by Degrees, thro' long Deductions drawn, Clear Intuition sees the cloudless Dawn! You'll say, perhaps, that Mind to Body link'd Cannot perceive when Senses are extinct; With them it grows, and ceases when they cease;— How then gives Mind to Senses an Increase? For their Defect by Help of Art it clears; And Eyes to Eyes it adds, and Ears to Ears. Hence, higher rais'd than human Lot's Purlieu, It calls the Stars of Heav'n to nearer View; Great Earth's hid Treasures mast'ring, it descries, And pores in Systems too minute for Eyes; New Worlds of Wonder Wit brings forth to Light, And mends the Seeing with superior Sight; Of Form, and Bulk, and Distance it decides, And judges rightly, where the Sense misguides. Shows not all this a Pow'r from Sense sejunct,— Ethereal Science? Body then defunct, These short Excursions indicate the Mind, For more unbounded Range of Truth design'd. How will it be?—That Knowledge is to come, No Part of ours; the Life within the Womb, Know you what 'twas? Knows he that was born blind Delights of Colour?—No; but he can find That others know them, tho' himself does not. So knows the Mind in this her present Lot, Amidst the Scenes unequal to her Care, That some unknown, eternal Forms, and fair, Are shown to Minds more vig'rous and sublime; To these she gives her Wishes, and her Time. Fine Beauty's Absence, absent, she deplores, And smit with secret, conscious Love adores; Shuns human Haunts and seeks the silent Wood, To meditate alone th' Eternal Good; To sooth her Cares with Thought of future Things And Verse, to make them present while she sings. That Man I reckon to have liv'd indeed, Who having seen how all Things here proceed, With equal Mind and constantly good Aim Returns, contented Guest, to whence he came. Whether you count an hundred Years or few, The same old Scenes come round and round anew. The World has nothing better to bestow; Deem then this transitory State below A public Market or a Spacious Inn; Where for a while when floating Life has been With Cares and Trifles tost of ev'ry Sort, Who leaves it first, is first got into Port! Haste thither then; contract the daring Sail; Steer into Harbour, lest Provisions fail; Haste! The Disease, the Death of the dear Friend, Th' infirm old Age,—what Ills on Life attend! Where do I run? We must and ought to stay, Till He Who plac'd us here, call hence away. Thro' Hopes, thro' Fears, this Leader we can trust; He bids us bear—and therefore bear we must. But, were I sure that this poor Life was all, My eager Wish would be a sudden Call To go where sooner, later, from the Stage All Actors drop,—to sleep an endless Age. Nay, Youth renew'd, if it were giv'n to choose, Or cradl'd Infancy, I would refuse. Not all the Blessings of the Life, not Health, Wit, Elocution, Prudence, Manners, Wealth, Unenvied Honour, num'rous Issue, known Both by their Fathers Virtues and their own;— Not for all this Reward would I compound To run again a Race of mortal Round! The Mind's Expectance just as well as high Nothing can equal;—that can never die.</field>
