      <field name="fulltext">SONNET. Leaning against the window, rapt in thought, Of what sweet past do thy soft brown eyes dream That so expressionlessly sweet they seem? Or what great image hath thy fancy wrought To wonder round and gaze at? or doth aught Of legend move thee, o'er which eyes oft stream, Telling of some sweet saint who rose supreme From martyrdom to God, with glory fraught? Or art thou listening to the gondolier, Whose song is dying o'er the water wide, Trying the faintly-sounding tune to hear Before it mixes with the rippling tide? Or dost thou think of one that comes not near, And whose false heart, in thine, thine own doth chide? A LAMENT. OLIVER MADOX BROWN. Born 1855. Died 1874. I My friend has left me, he has gone away; Before his time—so long before—he went. Bright was the dawn of his unended day; But love might not, yea, nothing might prevent The hand of death from striking. Oh fair Art! First mistress of his intellect and heart, Of this our common sorrow bear thy part, Bow down and weep now for the words I say. II His lips are mute, and stilled is the great brain, The strong heart beats no more, the strife is done; So near the goal, he reached it without pain, We crowned him, then he went beyond the sun. But though he has gone out from us, his name Shall lessen not with time, and his young fame Shall burn for ever, an enduring flame, A stedfast light that may not wax or wane. III Lo, this first work whereby we bowed to him, Calling him master, though he was so young, Shall intervening centuries make dim? Those sea-tossed lovers who together clung What time they had for common enemies The blasting tropic suns, and treacherous seas, And torture of long thirst they might not ease, Till hearts began to fail, and brains to swim. IV The years which might have been I seem to see; I know the great work ended, and I hear Rumours of storms and voice of waves that flee; I breathe a fierce and fervid atmosphere. I see strong warriors meet, and armed for war, I see each helmet shining like a star, I hear the shock of weapons near and far, And in the densest of the strife is he. V My friend, my friend, he strikes with confident hand, I hear the blows ring on opposing shields, And none I know his prowess may withstand; I know the shield he bears, the sword he wields; Before his strength I see his foes give place, And in my heart I see a spectre race Look with glad eyes upon his lifted face, They who inhabit now the flowerless land. VI Defoe and Richardson and Scott, and those Two sisters whose fair names shine ever clear, Charlotte, and patient Emily who chose To take a path where none might follow her; Like him she left one work for monument, And songs that keep the keen sweet heather-scent, And like him too before her time she went, To be where quiet is and deep repose. VII Oh friend and brother, if this thing might be, That souls live after death, the great elect Should throng the portals to give hail to thee; And they thy wandering footsteps should direct, Should take thee where the fairest gardens glow, Should take thee where the deepest rivers flow; Should point thee o'er the faces thou shouldst know, And linger with thee by the jasper sea. VIII But perfect rest is now thy heritage, And though the labour of thy hand and brain Had made thy life triumphant, none engage To point the world new paths without the strain Of long and arduous fighting. Oh my friend, Not thine, our loss this unimagined end. Life is not sweet, but sharp with thorns that rend; And the soul's thirst, what springs in life assuage? IX Fame is not always good,—remember this, All ye with whom I mourn—who mourn with me; Nor is love always a sure path to bliss, And time works many changes sad to see. And 'twixt the dearest friends estrangements rise, Across wide gulfs they look with longing eyes; But they have done with questions and replies, And sad and very hard to bear this is. X London I never loved for London's sake, Her crowds oppressed me more than solitude; But some far music his fine ear could take, Mine failed to catch; yea, since he found her good, Loved the strong ebb and flow of fluctuant life, The night's uneasy calm, the day's loud strife, Found all her ancient streets with memories rife, Shall I not love her too, asleep, awake? XI Oh friend, my friend, there is so much to tell Since that September night we met on last, Dreams have passed by and hopes have said farewell. Oh love that lives, and life that soon is past! From where he is he may not make reply, Too far away he is to hear my cry, Love weeps for us, for him love may not sigh, And grief saith but one word irreparable. XII We talked about our future many times, Planned work together, jested, and were grave, And now he will not listen to my rhymes. My sorrow breaks above me in one wave, For he has left me, he has gone away To lands that do not know the night from day, Where men toil not, neither give thanks nor pray, Where come no rumours from the sounding chimes. XIII Oh men and women, listen and be wise, Refrain from love and friendship, dwell alone, Having for friends and loves the seas, the skies, And the fair land, for these are still your own. The sun is yours, the moon and stars are yours, For you the great sea changes and endures, And every year the spring returns, and lures: I pray you only love what never dies. XIV For life hath taught me with much diligence That bitterest sorrow springs from things most fair: Remorseless death that calls those loved ones hence Who living gave us strength our cross to bear, The failure of high purposes, the death Of fairest inspiration, the quick breath, The ebbing light, and the last words one saith, The dust and sleep and death for recompense. XV I know it was of his a favourite creed That when the body dies the existing soul Of other souls becomes a fruitful seed, Changing, existing through the years that roll; Flashing continually from state to state, Not ceasing with the lives that terminate, A part of life, of destiny, of fate, The germ and the fulfilment, thought and deed. XVI Here, where I stumbled, he walked sure of foot; And here more clear than mine his spirit's sight; His high thought sprang from no uncertain root; His intellect was like the broad noon-light; He stemmed the tide of passion strong and deep, He walked most confidently up paths most steep, And by the way he loved he fell asleep, And of his life we gather now the fruit. XVII I clasp another sorrow in my soul, I take another memory to keep, To love and cherish while the seasons roll, To think of while I wake or fall asleep. The weary winter-time shall pass, and spring, The patient earth at last revisiting, With soft and flowerlike skies, and birds that sing, Shall come most hearts to gladden and make whole. XVIII But mine she shall not gladden; I for one By all her sweets will not be comforted. The summer days shall come with stress of sun, The placid light of summer stars be shed; With dew at eve the roses shall be sated And all the earth by slumber softly weighted; But love shall keep its sorrow unabated Till all the fears and pains of life be done. XIX And now I bring to sweeten thy repose All rarest odours wed to delicate tints, Chrysanthemums, and violets, and rose, With laurel leaves, and the wild hyacinths; And I have kissed the flowers and bade them be My messengers of love to speak for me, The last, last gift that I shall give to thee, Unwitting now of any flower that blows. XX Alas! what can be said? What can we do? Ah me! we have no words,—we can but wait,— Wait and remember where the years wear through. Life is at longest but a brief estate; As a flower of the field, the Psalmist saith, It blooms and the fashion of it perisheth; We cannot tell when we may chance on death, To be resolved into the light, the dew. XXI Oh friends! who sit together well content, Throwing your personal news out pleasantly, Or meeting hotly in some argument, Or interchanging deepest sympathy, Prize well the precious moments, for indeed You cannot tell when you may sorely need The friendly talk and counsel. Take good heed Your lips let through no word they might repent. XXII Sleep well, my friend, the sleep that no dreams break, I too some day of sleep shall take my fill; But now I live, and work for mere work's sake, Missing the strength of thy controlling will. I know my soul through all shall thirst and fret For thee, for thee whom time may not forget; And when I see dear friends together met, I know my heart will fail in me and ache. Philip Bourke Marston.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO ALL ETERNITY, AND OTHER STANZAS AND VERSES. TO ALL ETERNITY. (A FRAGMENT). Incutiens blandum per pectora amarum. God! what a soul that woman had! Ah me! My own grows chill within me! There's no standard In heaven above or hell beneath, o'er which A woman's soul may not predominate— May not aspire to—or degrade itself! Once she was almost beautiful. Her eyes Shone glittering; twin stars plucked from the abyss Of God's most fathomless soul; twin mysteries, So deep your drowned brain whirled in them, so bright That even their colour seemed a mystery— Whence the emotional keen spirit flashed forth Its scintillant electricities. Her eyes Kindled and shone like flames blown in the wind That day when first we met—For [] they made A boy's soul luminous, where now they burn The grown man's soul to death! Ah love! love! love! Whose unintelligible promptings lure Earth's mightiest nerves to thraldom—whose deep magic, Too swift for timorous afterthought, too deep For present doubt, makes blind the brain—whose hands Mould this man's heaven from that man's hell—whose gaze Infatuates—whose wind-shod feet resume The joys its hands disperse—whose yearnings storm Heaven with their high intentions, ere God paves Hell's wildest depths with them! Oh love! love! love! My soul and thine were even as one with hers When first that glance met mine. That day the sun Smote round our ivy-clad old hall till all Its redolent green turned grey. The floodland meadows Sultry and odorous sickened me, and I, Tired of the sunlight too, with all my brain Plunged in some nameless ecstasy, sought refuge Deep in the sheltered hollows of a wood Full of melodious silence and soft whispers Of wind-lent life among still boughs, that fringed The foot of the hills beyond . . . The stillness grew So deep at last that I could hear my heart Throb like an echoing footfall. Once a thrush Broke through the brambles with wild amorous cries; And as I marked its startled flight, the trees Reeled in my sight till all their foliage Seemed whirling in a dream. How long I wandered Dreaming my soul out thus, I know not; only I think a sudden rustle underfoot Broke up my reverie at last, and I Stepped back o' the instant. Stretched across my path Swift-striped and sibilant-fanged a viper crawled From one stone to another, and disappeared Even as I watched it. Oh my God! had I Only but known that sign for what it meant! But that same instant a low tremulous sound Passed like a sigh in the wind—which faltering (Like to the first drops of an April shower) Died quite away: only to recommence, Until at last its sweetness reached a pitch So sweet—so incommunicably sweet, That all my blood turned fire within my veins, And my heart sank within me. Then I knew It was a woman's voice that sang. The wood Grew thinner thereabouts—for presently I broke into a glade where the warm sun Pierced through at random, and, just slipping round The weather-beaten trunk of a huge oak, Stepped out into the light. How shall I tell What happened there? For first I stood half dazed In one great blaze of sunlight. Then there came A sharp stroke on my side, and I reeled back Breathless and stupefied; whilst a shrill scream Rang in mine ears. Just hovering past my face I saw the suspended figure of a girl Nigh grown to womanhood mount high i' the air Some moments yet ere she could stay herself. She had been swinging as she sang, her rope Fast to the boughs o'erhead; and I it seemed Had stepped before her unawares, her song Still on her lips low-lingering; till it changed Into that frightened scream. And now she stopped, Sprang to the earth, and disappeared ere I Could gain my feet again; I only caught One brief glance of her face—then she was gone. SONNET FOUND PREFIXED TO THE FIRST MS. OF THE ‘Black Swan.’ No more these passion-worn faces shall men's eyes Behold in life. Death leaves no trace behind Of their wild hate and wilder love, grown blind In desperate longing, more than the foam which lies Splashed up awhile where the showered spray descries The waves whereto their cold limbs were resign'd; Yet ever doth the sea-wind's undefin'd Vague wailing shudder with their dying sighs. For all men's souls 'twixt sorrow and love are cast As on the earth each lingers his brief space, While surely nightfall comes where each man's face In death's obliteration sinks at last As a deserted wind-tossed sea's foam-trace— Life's chilled boughs emptied by death's autumn blast. SONNET WRITTEN AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN FOR A PICTURE BY MRS. STILLMAN. Leaning against the window, rapt in thought, Of what sweet past do thy soft brown eyes dream That so expressionlessly sweet they seem? Or what great image hath thy fancy wrought To wonder round and gaze at? or doth aught Of legend move thee, o'er which eyes oft stream, Telling of some sweet saint who rose supreme From martyrdom to God, with glory fraught? Or art thou listening to the gondolier, Whose song is dying o'er the waters wide, Trying the faintly-sounding tune to hear Before it mixes with the rippling tide? Or dost thou think of one that comes not near, And whose false heart, in thine, thine own doth chide? GIPSY SONG. “I love very well The first blossoming (I love well I ween) That blooms in the spring; Its purple and green Seem meet for some queen, To bind in her hair's loosening. “I should love well to match me! (The light of high heaven Burns in my eyes!) And I love well,” she cries, “The young men to watch me,— But ah! who can catch me? For I run with feet fleeter than wind through the skies.” DEVONSHIRE CHILDREN'S SONG. A dwalling drumble-drone ie' th' ruets, An apple-dreane aboo, Th' yapple-dreane sturtled and stugged ie' th' fruits, Th' drone ie' th' yavil flew. T'ould coo cuddled agin th' colt, Th' puss-cat scrudled a-vigging her claw, For th' yangles wert just beginning ter moult Sae the yearth wert laden wi' snaw. An apple-dreane an' a drumble-drone Wert aw' ther' wert to zee, Th' drumble-drone lay deed ie' th' snaw, And ter yapple-dreane i' th' dree! GIPSY SONG. The growth of love's fruit is Most meet to eat; Yet a snare where the root is Entangles the feet. To passion no stop is When true love hath sinned; But the flower that love's crop is Droops dead i' the wind. FRAGMENT OF BALLAD. Woe to the unborn sons of the Tracies! (Say what redemption is left through all time) O could they reach to the land where God's grace is, Baffled and faint with the storm-wind's embraces, (The wind that wails for their forefather's crime With ever the wind and rain in their faces,— Never again till the end of time. ZINGALI SONG. La chenda di clais And re mi claise Camela Camela La bastarda broh jugi Di brotomuchi Clonel a badnoi. SONG. [Lady, we are growing tired!] Lady, we are growing tired! Lo! our faltering breath, Once with new-born love inspired, Holds the love we once desired, as weary unto death. Lady, Love is very fleet, All too fleet for sorrow: But if we part in time, my sweet, We'll overtake Love's flying feet,— If we part to-day, my love, we'll find new love to-morrow. SONG. [Sing away, Oh sing away!] Sing away, Oh sing away! My father's ship sails swiftly home: O'er the wind-blown waves a-foam What gifts will be bring away? A golden coif to bind my locks— Sing away, Oh sing away!— Or else two white-and-silver smocks. But if he drift on the sea's rocks What gifts will he bring away? SONG. [Love is a desultory fire] Love is a desultory fire, Blown by a wind made musical with sighs, A void and wonderfully vague desire, Which comes and flies. Of once-sown seed, who knoweth what the crop is? Alas! my love, Love's eyes are very blind! What would they have us do? sun-flowers and poppies Stoop to the wind. STANZAS. [What sweet lips are reddening] What sweet lips are reddening In the void beyond to-morrow? Ah! what cause for joy or sorrow May the coming seasons bring? Nay! they're all too sweet, those days, for our imagining. Many a youth is fain for love, Many a maiden's heart is yearning: Oh hasten while you can to prove The thoughts wherewith your souls are burning. Life is all too short for sorrow, Yesterday died beckoning the unreluctant morrow. LAURA'S SONG. [Alas! who knows or cares, my love] Alas! who knows or cares, my love, If our love live or die,— If thou thy frailty, sweet, shouldst prove, Or my soul thine deny? Yet merging sorrow in delight, Love's dream disputes our devious night. None know, sweet love, nor care a thought For our heart's vague desire, Nor if our longing come to nought, Or burn in aimless fire; Let them alone, we'll waste no sighs: Cling closer, love, and close thine eyes!</field>
