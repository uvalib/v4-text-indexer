      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I.Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. Portraits of the Author and his Brother. Thus to Posteritye; when wee (return?d To our cold Principles) wander, in scorn?d Atomes, vnknowne; perhaps, these figures, may Vs, to a Time vnheard of yet, convay; Or, should they faile our purpose; can wee blame Fortune at all? when Nature doth the Same? Necessitie, (which noe Care, can prevent,) Makes man a foole, and frustrates his intent; Dec?. Die Iulij: 1.6.4.7. POEMS Written upon Severall Occasions. Pascitur in vivis Livor: post fata quiescit, Cum suus ex merito quemque tuetur honos. [Ovid, Amores, 1. 15. ll. 39–40.] Coat of Arms and Portrait. This Shadow, overshadowed, is a Tipe Of my full Selfe; if you (who see't) are ripe To Iudge of Art, behold: a twofold grace In one Small Draught; my Fortune, and my Face; Tis all the Pencill could; for only Men Can draw their inward Selves, w?? their owne Pen; But our Pens flatter; and wee stranglie raise False beauties, in the mind; as in the face The mercinarie Hand; and sometime put A gracefull mole, for a dull morphew?d Spot; Soe neare, is man himself; that to his owne Self, he dissembles, and will not be knowne; Thus wee deluded are; yet, let me Say; If wee know not our selves; none other may: G. Daniel: 23 martij: 1646. An Addresse By the Author: not impertinent to the following Poems. Au Lecteur. Phancies are but our owne; and though wee give 'Em birth, perhaps they have noe right to Live; Why? doe wee wast our Inke and oyle, in vaine? Wasting our Nights and Dayes in fruitles paine To bring a Monster forth? a Prodigie? Or strange Chimæra, of our Fantasie? What End have wee in this? Is't not Enough If to our Selves, wee our owne Follies know? If wee poure out, for other Men to Eat They'r full, as well as wee, with their owne Meat; The World's a tottring Stage; and Mankind All Is but one Antike Individuall; From time to Time, the Same; noe Age can boast The better Interlude; for what wee most Admire, (before our Selves;) or what we lest Can Iudge of, (After) has nor worst, nor best. This Mockshow, this Coloss', this Maister-peice Of Nature, (as wee call it, when wee please Our partiall frailties) is that bruitish Thing,— Degenerate, Foolish, giddy, wavering, Voluptuous, Bloodie, Proud, Insatiate Lump of Corruption,—which they wondred at Twelve Centuries a goe; and Time shall bring To its last point, iust such another Thing. There is noe wonder, if within the Sphere Of Nature, ought Irregular appeare: Wee, are that odde Incorrigible peice Of Error; tis within vs, the Excess, Defect, or what wee call Deformitie To hinder Nature's first made Harmonie. This, when I looke at, and my Atome take (A Sand of the rude Heape,) I seeke to make It cleane; and Softly rubbe away the Slime; I sleeke it Faire; and weare it, for a Time My Boast, my Iewell; or more Ideot-like I sett it in my Cap, where all Eyes Strike Vpon it; and I, foole, am pleas'd to heare Them rate it high; as though this Graine did beare Proportion to a Piramid; this, clawes My Nature, for a while; but Time, (which drawes All Things to Irksomenes;) brings in a packe Of Vanities, whil'st I forgett this Knacke; Careles, I lay it by; whil'st the rude Heape, (Which rolleth ever) it away doth Sweepe, Into the wombe of that insatiate Gulph Which Lethe, some doe call.— Then I run on, forgetting All had past; And my poor Sand, lyes mixt, and gravell'd fast; Chips, Strawes, and Feathers, Bulrushes, and Flowers, Then take me vp; and make my dayes but Howers; But as a Child,—not pleas'd with any long,— To get a Rattle, these away are flung. What shall I next? what next shall please my Eye; For All is nothing, but Varietie; Thus roll I Sisyphean Stones, and play (Which he can never) all my time away. Late by the Streame, thus did I playing Sit With Cockle-Shells, (a Pas-time not vnfitt To my Discretion): Some, as wise as I, Had Shittle-cockes; (and made them finely flye) Another sort, had Whirligigs; and Some At Cheek-stones play'd, or Cherry-pit; of Foame Others would blow a Sphære, from out a Shell, And run to catch it, like a Starre when't fell; Thus Severally; but I, as Serious As any, to my Folly; Glorious At each Encounter; and a Victorie I priz'd, to all my Ioye's Monopolie; When in the height of All, as Shells must breake, Mine broke; and I discountenaunct, goe seeke A fresh one on the Shore; where one I found, And hot for the Encounter, dress it round; I washt and Scratcht, and tooke a mightie paine (For it was worth All that;) till not one graine Of Sand, or Dirt, was Easy to be seene; Not Troian Hector, in his Armour Sheene, Appear'd more Glorious; then my Champion was Fitt for the Lists, and I to leave the place, Where I to such high purpose, had bene toyling; When some kind Influence, (greived at y? oft foyling Of weake mortalitye) told me, I tooke Ioy, in my owne Destruction; bade me looke To what I had bene doing; for that Mudde I threw away, was my owne Slime; and Stood All that remain'd, of what I valued once My dearest Part; gather againe, what Chance And Providence, are pleas'd to give; once more Be thy owne Keeper; from this dismall Shore Not many doe returne.—It ceas'd; I stood A verie Statua, dull as my owne Mudde; Not Flint-wrapt Niobe, more stone did rise: My blood was Corral, and my Breath was Ice; Extasied from all Sence, to thinke what low Delusions drew me; and I knew not how; For all the Sordid Follyes, which I sought With Earnestnes, were now before me brought, A Spectacle of Horror; I must breake This marble of my Shame, my Shame to Speake. What can I doe (Alas)? but gather in The little Dirt, which formerly was mine; A fixèd bodie, orient and bright; Now a foule mixture, darke in my owne Sight; As to my Reason, the first Chaos was. I must goe on; Man, while he has in chase The world, and obiects vaine, looseth himselfe; And his poore Sand, turnes wreck't into the Shelfe Of bruitish Appetite; the Labour's over If from this Syrte's wee our Sand recover. Where am I now? enveloped as Deepe To my owne wonder, as my Shame can creepe; The vast Abisse of nature's vnsearch't wombe (Mother to Reason, Ignorance's Tombe) Were a prodigious Title, to enhance My numbers weighty, and my Name advance; This might blow vp a Spirrit of that fire Who loves to Speake, what others but Admire; For who can Speake, what cannot be exprest? Readers, know little, and the writer Least. Love is noe more a Ray, from that devine Flame, then this Fish-scale, Phœbus, is from thine; Tis a low bruit Affection, now, which binds In Sensuall Fetters, lowe Earth-seeking minds; Gold, and Desire, is Love; let minde and Face Warme Cottages, and be the milkmaid's Grace; Wee higher tend; Fruition, of that all- Compounded Evill, is the thing wee call Love, not improperlie;—and is not witt Worthy a name? that can be Parasit'? Clawe my yong Lord, or make my Ladie smile, With quaint Devises, worthy well her while? Getting a goodly deale of patronage; And my Lord's word, The wonder of his Age. Soe are they both—: but Witt, is growne, of Late Like the Trunke-hose, laught at, and out of Date. The Drum, beats loud, to fright our Villages, Swords are the Pens, which everie Day encrease; Our Laws, are writt in Blood; and carv'd with Steele, Worthy the Authors—: but I hope wee feele Some ghostly Comfort yet; Religion Has put of late, her best Apparell on; And wee are all a wooeing fitt to ride, Who should bring in this faire one, fitt for Bride: Well; wee have tryed Enough, and rifled Each Below the Cloaths vnto the naked breech; And left em Soe; and soe alas they goe, Poore Ladies, to this Day, and Like to doe; What Age has ever yet bene free of these? Tis true, the last King was a man of Peace; Yet sawcye Qvills would note some blemish int; And his fam'd Predecessors, though in print, And painted Cloath, they make her verie fine; Yes, and her Sister, who did love to Dine On woodcocke Christians, roasted for the nonce With Gutts and All;—or if wee should Advance To bugbeare Harrie, whose imperious breath Was Law enough;—Oh the fine Dagger sheath! And Codpeice of that King!—Let Nero rise Iustified, in his strange Impieties. Scoure of[f] the Rust; and set an Edge on Witt, Let each Line sparkle Courage; till wee Sitt Constellated with Cæsar, in our owne Or other's Flatterie; let Vertue (growne Long out of vse) adde some graines to the Skale Of what wee claime to; how shall it availe? What doe wee see applauded, everie Day? Vice in a vizard goes the safest way; The goodly masques, of Faith, and Conscience, Are worne to thrive by; be't without offence I know none Honest, but to his owne Sight In his owne Cause, is a Strange Hypocrite. The Great Aurelius, had a flight beyond This Region, in the Sphære of his owne mind; And I admire his Dictates, as they are To him selfe-Precepts; what a Noble care It is in man, to give that Seasoning From his owne Fountaine, shall preserve the Spring. (Through all the Ambages of Life's Affaire) Backe to its liveing Source, vnmixt, and Cleare! I can be pleas'd, when Lucian laughs at Witt, And makes Philosophie, a Dizzard sitt; Crack-brain'd Menippus, wisely did discerne They taught the Things which they would never learne. I'me Slow in my owne Nature; Dull, and Rude; Indifferent, in my humor; Solitude Affects me cheifly; bashfull, have noe feat Nor iocund humour, to ingratiate; Yet not Averse, but rather hammer out What I approve, then Carry mirth about; I commend freedome; Mirth, I love, beyond My Genius, and Adore it in my mind; But cannot be Facete; some Gesture sitts Still in my Face, which noe full mirth befitts; And when I force it in, it comes as patt To make me Laugh, because I know not what I first meant, should be Ieast; a thousand things Passe, with the Garbe, when the maine Storie brings Little to Iudgement; now let me recite Things not vnworthy, and I spoyle 'em quite. I have noe gracefull Meine nor faire Accost, Noe Foyle; Even Diamonds grow dim, in my Dust. In my Discourse I'me common; but can keepe A trusted Secret, as the Centre deepe, Within my Bosome; I could never love One Individuall Atome, much above Another; I admire; to all I am Each severall Species; for the glorious Name Of freindship and Affection, though it draw My Nature aptly, yet I find it rawe And but a Phlegme, where I would most expresse: Now tis a Flame within me; and I lesse Consider my owne Interest, then the Claime Another has vnto me, in that Name. Now whether Education, or what else I doe not know, perhaps from principles Of Constitution, some vnwonted Awe, Something, vnder what Name I doe not know, Strikes me, in maiestie; and though I praise All Government, as Government; I raise My Selfe, with more Delight, to looke vpon A monarch's Scepter, then the Axe, or Gowne. This, when I wondring fixe at; I behold Our Royall master, in Afflictions old; But vig'orous in vertue, and Dispred In all his Princelie Rayes; not hindered As the Eclipsèd Sun, by the moon's dull Hydropticke bodie, to obscure him full; But Charles, whose more illustrious Beams strike throw' The giddie planet, that the world may know Tis but her Errant motion; Hee, the Same Light, to the world; Health and Life-bringing Flame: Soe Father Saturne, by his Sawcie Son, Seaven yeare agoe, was interpos'd; tis Runne I hope out, in our Iland; Meteors must After a while, burne out, and dye ith' Dust: But the great Luminaries carrie Flame T' enrich the world, and make it worth a Name. Freedome, and love of Truth, is all I boast; I know but little, Hee that knowes the most Is not an Inch beyond me; I can Sitt Pleased in my owne; Hee's plungèd in his witt; For Knowledge is a Qvicksand; where wee can Not free our selves, till wee the burthen, man, Devest; our Flesh, the Scales which doe obscure Our Intellectuall Eyes; and Death's the Cure: Then chang'd, wee move another Nature; See And know things trulie, as they truly bee In their owne Causes; till when, wee pursue A Wildgoose-Chase, to what none ever knew; Hee that knew All, knew nothing; or at least Knew, all Hee knew was Follie with the rest. Then bring me wine; Call in the merrie Crue, Let petty Sphæres their heightned Peggs vp-Scrue To rival with the greater; and disperse Our frolicke Ioyes, to all the vniverse; Soe Poets are themselves; let Dulnes Sitt On the dry brow; wee live in mirth and witt; Be sprightly, as the morne; Anticipate Time, in his motion; and Astonish Fate To make our owne; while the dull Sisters winke And passe our Threds, Halfe-drunke, to see vs Drinke. Are there noe Females in the house come in? Coy Modesties, where have you Absent bene? From what, your Wishes rectified, prefer To our Desires; A Day, has bene a Yeare; Strike vp a louder Note while wee advance Preparatoryes, to our Daliance. Me thinkes, againe I thirst; Swell me a Boule, Lesse Emptie, then the Ayre; Let misers howle At their slow Incomes; tis a Noble prize To laugh at fortune and the World despise. This hideous Peice of madnes has perchance, I th' Scæne, less Envie, and lesse Arrogance Then some wee call Discretions; perhaps lesse Impietie; but Sin, who can Expresse? Tis all within vs; and our Thoughts scarce know What tis wee would, or what wee would not Doe; Soe then wee whine, vpon our Errors past, And Swimme our Brains in Follye to the Last. Our Fancies are our Follies; and our Boast Is all our Crime; Strange Paradox! almost To Stifle Reason; yet it is most true I've found it, in my Selfe; and Soe may You: Ut Surgam Cado. Munitus, et clausus, contra externa intra me maneo; a curis omnibus Securus, praeter vnam, vt fractum, subactumq: hunc animum, rectæ Rationi, ac Deo subiiciam; et animo coeteras res humanas. To his honoured friend y? authour vpon his Poems. When w'th thy gallant Warwick thou begins, Cosen, thou masters Muse, a style y? wins oratorie to admiration of verse; Degraded prose, vnflidg'd yet to reherse an honourable note, soares not to Say Nevil, who made them Kinges was more then they: Whiles that great Courage w? disposèd them, both gaue &amp; tooke y? dandled Diadem. more by thy quainter pen y? armie bleeds and frisher farr than their heroick deedes. But when thy Missalanie doth disband thy strickter Sence (deare freind) w??? doth com?nd Varietie to ramble here &amp; there, Flowers bandy sent, birds they inchant y? aire: This w? is paradox I boldly give Thy memory; when thou art dead thou'lt Live. Tho: Crompton. Vpon a Reviewe of Virgil, translated by M?. Ogilby. This, not to Virgil, whom I did Admire; Not led by Custome, but a secret fire Shot through my Soule, from his abundant Ray; And not by Votes, led to what others Say; I did, and doe admire Him; and I thought A brave Adventure 'twas, who ever brought Him, to speake current English, in the rate Our Langvage carries now; but I may Say't (Without a Boast) vpon this second veiwe, This Qvill has done All that, and doth pursue The heights of fancye, equall to his owne, In a quicke flame, and full expression; In weight, and number, great as the first Soule inflamèd Virgil; moveing on the whole Bodie, with the same Sinnewes, not a Nerve Lost, to its vse; (lest Life, &amp; Blood might Sterve Within obstructed Channels;) everie veine Rises, as High, and to be seene as plaine. May wee beleive the Rants, some Chimists make, To consume Bodies, which againe shall take Being and forme; (a Resurrective Tipe From dust &amp; Ashes,) th' individuall, ripe To all its former beauties, they can raise Numerically iust, to what it was; These Curiosities layd out, may please Yonge Heads; &amp; profit old Huniades, Who has found out y? true Elixir; which T' attempt, makes others poore, has made Him, rich. But Wee, who move beyond Philosophye In these Experiments, will credit thee Great Oracle of Samos; and averre Soules are not lost, or Dye, but doe transfer; And the great Genius of y? Mantuan, fir'd In a fit Clay, now breaths the same admir'd Accents, which never any durst assay To imitate, or open, to this Day; But one, who with a rude &amp; tedious Qvill Doth wound his Readers, &amp; his Author, Kill; Virgil is dull &amp; Lost; and only Phaer Resolves his words, verball Interpreter. Such, in a Prose, to duller Heads, may Stand With honest meaning; But let noe bold hand Attempt a Poet, 'cause he learnèd once To construe Latin; and soe caught, by chance, A Flye, in yawning; ther's a rule beyond Your Syntax; tis a Sympathie of mind; A Soule enricht with sacred flame, to all The Author's Spirrit, in th' originall; A Genius, to the primitive conceit; Con-centricke wheels, with motion, to y? great Idea fixt; not Skip &amp; catch by turnes, Or make his owne, while the rack'd Author mourns, Tortur'd, in clumsie fingers; White Hands may Open y? folds, and draw the veile away; Some, now tormented thus; for all Soules have Not Rest, when their cold Bodies kisse the Grave; But Sensible in some things, suffer to The iniuries Posteritie may doe Vpon their Labours; Some, (in those blest Shades Lost to their owne, by what noe time invades As they bequeath'd it; in another tongve Another Note, they know not what they Sung;) Frequent the Corners &amp; ashamèd sitt Vnder vnverdant Trees; their Hands commit Outrage on holy boughs; for through y? Place Is nothing witherd: but still-virent Bayes Narcissus, Hyacinth, Sweet Asphodel, (And what our Langvage may not reach to tell) Appeare, and make Elizium but one Grove; Only y? Skirts, some Soules (less happie) rove; Whose Relicts, handled by foule Thumbs, have lost Their native Lustre; These, (who left, to boast Numbers, which not vnworthily have plac'd Them in Elizium, yet) on Earth disgrac'd Would beg a Pasport, (but, who can convey Soules, happie-seated) to revisit Day; There, they must vexe; at lest, not there posses Entire fruition, of a perfect Peace; Till Time, (which fitts the Earth, to make one place Of many orbes) shall throw away his Glasse; Or raise another Qvill, to vindicate The Author, and enthrone him in his State; Here (till repairèd thus) they not inherit; The weed, they would put on, they cannot weare it; Triflers, on Earth, are tugging at y? Sleeves, Ruffle y? folds, and the full Skirt vpheav's. Soe this restorèd Maro, for a while (Time is not measur'd there) pinch't, in y? toyle Of all his Glorie, suffer'd; now, hee treads Free, as Musæus, &amp; y? clearest Heads Of that blest confine; if a Limit may Be set, where nothing bounds; for Place, they Say Is but our Image; high, &amp; purgèd Soules Leave Time &amp; Place, to dull earthporing fooles; There, like Himselfe, in his first Station Hee moves, vnchangèd in y? version; All Hee now doth, (&amp; not w?? care) is but To Harbinger his learnèd name, who put New Robes of Glory on his great Remains; Radiant, as Light; &amp; Truth-like, free from Stains; There, Hee prepares them, to receive a Gvest Worthy their Harmony, their Ioy, their Rest; And frames loud Pæans, Him to gratulate, Worthily plac'd neare to his owne high Seate. Soe did Great Homer, and Theocritus Take Qvarters vp, for Virgil's living Muse; Though to a different Honour Homer sung, He caught his from Him, not to doe him wrong; And Hesiod there, who sung of Ceres most, Gave his Corne-Chaplets, Virgil's better boast, When Hee arriv'd; Hee now his owne hath torne In equall parts, equally to adorne His freind; for 'tis vnlawfull any (but Virgill's owne Selfe) another's wreath on putt; They may participate, Soe share it there, As they have Rivall'd in their fancyes here. What more, may not be told; tis only left To those who shall enioy those Ioyes, a gift; Mean-while, iust Admirations may raise Merit, on Earth; to give desert, a place Beyond y? mouth of Envie; thus I yeild My double Tribute; Hee that cannot weild Armes, must confer his Power another way; All cannot all things dexterously assay; And that I may not end, without a breath From Virgill's mouth; take it, as I bequeath It to y? world, in Honour of this Pen, Who made Him speake, a Dialect, for men To wonder at; a worke worthy his Bayes See; now Ascanius keeps an Equall pace. July 2?? 1647. G. Daniel: A Vindication of Poesie. Truth Speakes of old, the Power of Poesie; Amphion, Orpheus, Stones and Trees could move; Men, first by verse, were taught Civilitie; 'Tis knowne, and granted; yet would it behove Mee, with the Ancient Singers, here to Crowne Some later Qvills, Some Makers of our owne. Who has not heard Mæonides' loud Straine? Macedon's Envie? who did never yet (That has of Numbers heard, but) heare againe The Ascrean Pipe? or great Musæus' witt? Who has not heard of Heroes, Demigods? Of Centaurs? Cyclop's? Sacred ffounts, and woods? See antique Rome; and though you see her plaine, In honest Ennius; can you but admire Pious Æneas? or the Mantuan, As Sweet in feilds, as statelie, in Troies' fire? Not Euxine Pontus, nor the Tirant's Lust Shall make Fame be less glorious, Fate lesse Iust. For after Death, dyes Envye; all men find Honour due to their merits; this, he taught And this, he found; live Ovid (vnconfined) To better mention; beyond a Thought Of o cur vidi; never more exclaime; Hee wrong'd his owne, and added to thy Name. Loe yet another; he who has not heard Pharsalia's Trumpet, never knew his ffate; Corduba's Glorie; see the Poet smear'd In guiltles Blood, triumph in Neroe's hate: His name shall live; and he, that cannot raise A verse to Lucan, dye without his praise. A noble Store, doth Italie produce, Which hap'lie may advance, their fame as great; Danazar, Petrarch, Tassoe's honored Muse: Swift Arne, the Thuscan Soile, noe more shall beat, Nor Swan-clad Po run Sweet, nor fame be Iust If Dant forgotten be, or Arïost': Nor shall the Muse of that French Eagle dye, Devine Sire Bartas; and the happie writt Of Bellay, here shall live eternallie, Eternizing his name, in his owne Witt; From hence, by a Short passage, wee are come To veiw the Treasure of our witts at home. I am not bound to honour Antique names; Nor am I led, by other Men to Chuse Any thing worthy, which my Iudgment blames; Heare better Straines, though by a later muse; The Sweet Arcadian Singer first did raise Our Langvage Current, and deserv?d his Baies; That Lord of Pen'herst; Penherst whose sad walls Yet mourne their Master, in the Belgicke fray Vntimelie lost; to whose deare ffuneralls The Medwaie doth its constant Tribute paye; But glorious Penherst, Medwaie's waters once With Mincius shall, and Mergeline advance. The Shepherd's Boy, best knowen by that name, Colin; vpon his homely oaten Reed With Roman Titirus may share in ffame; But when a higher path hee seems to tread, Hee is my wonder; for who yet has seene Soe Cleare a Poeme as his Faierie Queene? The Sweetest Swan of Avon, to y? faire And Cruel Delia, passionatelie Sings; Other men's weaknesses and follies are Honour and Witt in him; each Accent brings A Sprig, to Crowne him Poet; and Contrive A Monument, in his owne worke, to live. Draiton is sweet and Smooth; though not exact Perhaps, to stricter Eyes; yet he shall live Beyond their Malice. To the Sceane, and Act, Read Comicke Shakespeare; or if you would give Praise to a Iust Desert, crowning the Stage See Beaumont, once the honour of his Age. The reverent Donne, whose quill God purely fil'd Lives to his Character; &amp; though he claime A greater glory, may not be exil'd This comm?wealth; y? entrance of his fame Thus as y? Sun, to either Hemisphere Still y? same Light Hee movèd w? vs here. But as a Poet; all y? softnesses The Shadow, Light, y? Ayre, &amp; Life, of Love; The Sharpnes of all Witt; ev'n bitternes Makes Satire Sweet; all wit did God emprove 'Twas flamed in him, 'Twas but warm vpon His Embers; He was more; &amp; y? is Donne. Here pause a little; for I would not Cloy The curious Eare, with recitations; And meerly looke at names; attend with Ioy Vnto an English Qvill, who rivall'd once Rome, not to make her blush; and knowne of late Vnenvied ('cause vnequall'd) Laureate. This, this was Ionson; who in his owne name Carries his praise; and may he shine alone; I am not tyed to any generall ffame, Nor fixèd by the Approbation Of great ones; But I speake without pretence, Hee was, of English Drammatickes, the Prince. Be glad, illiterate English; y? y? may, Heare Lucan, in your best of Langvage speake; Lucan, y? mouth of Story, Sung by Maye, To y? his owne; his owne, soe truly like The Roman Genius, as you cannot say, This was by Lucan done, or y? by Maye. Let Naso sing his best; and once lament That best, did want his last life-giving hand; His works, our Sands, though now in banis?nt A Stranger, in a wild &amp; remote Land, Has polisht out, &amp; imps his wing, to flye, Beyond Rome's Eagles, &amp; her Emperye. Now leaves he there; but as he had Disdaigned Her witt, or Empire, confind to his reach; The holy Ground, he treads; w? though they gaind They never got; he did; &amp; now doth teach To vs dull Ilanders, y? inspirèd Layes Which David sung; &amp; w? y? Preacher sayes. The noble Overburie's Qvill, has left A better Wife, then he could ever find; I will not search too deep, lest I should lift Dust from the dead; Strange power of womankind, To raise, and ruine; for all he will claime Is from that Sex; his Birth, his Death, his Fame. But I spin out too long; let me draw vp My thred, to honour names of my owne time, Without their Evlogies, for it may Stop With Circumstantiall Termes, a wearie Rhime; Suffice it if I name 'em; that for me Shall stand, not to refuse their Evlogie. The noble ffalkland, Digbie, Carew, Maine Beaumond, Sands, Randolph, Allen, Rutter, May, The Devine Herbert, and the ffletchers twaine, Habinton, Shirley, Stapilton; I stay Too much on names; yet may I not forget Davenant, and Suckling, eminent in witt. Waller not wants y? glory of his verse; And meets a noble praise, in every Line; What should I adde in honour? to reherse Admirèd Cleaveland! by a verse of mine? Or give y? glorious muse of Denham praise? Soe with'ring Brambles stand, to liveing Bayes. These may suffice; not only to advance Our English honour, but for ever crowne Poesie 'bove the reach of Ignorance; Only dull fooles vnmov?d, admire their owne Stupiditie; and all beyond their Sphere Is Madnes, and but tingling in the Eare. Great Flame (whose raies at once, have power to peirce The frosted Skull of Ignorance, and Close The mouth of Envie); if I bring a verse Vnapt to move, my admiration fflowes With humble Love, and Zeale in the intent To a Cleare Rapture, from the Argument. To Time and Honour. Faire Albion, of the world thou fairest Ile! And thou Deare Yorkshire, thou my native Soyle, My Nurse, my Mother; oh, how can I pay My Gratitude? Muse! teach me what to Say; How shall I praise thee most? let me looke backe To former Ages, and I heare 'em Speake With almost wonder; what prodigious name Can boast he Saw, he went, and overcame, ffurther then some of ours? Third Edward's Son, Son of brave Sire! how did he overrun The face of ffrance? and Victorie Create In his owne fortune; pardon, if I say't, Hee was not Second to those names wee heare Pronounc'd with Admiration and ffeare; Not that Great Alexander, nor the name Of Punicke Hannibal, nor Cæsar's ffame, Outshine his Glories; had he seene a Day As large in Time, he'd beene as great as they; Him Shall I praise? or his brave father most? Or his great Grandsire? or of Richard boast? That Richard Lion's-heart; and from that Stemme Bring downe the Glorie, to fifth Harri?'s name, Or the fowerth Edward; these and many more (Though not in ffame) in Blood-inferior, Might I repeat; but better let them goe To swell huge Chronicle in ffolio. How shall I praise thee most? in thy full peace! Thy nat'rall Bounties, and the large increase Which everie yeare forth brings; thy inborne wealth, Thy selfe-existence, where wee need noe Stealth Of Marchants to enrich vs; but might rest Safe in our Selves, with native bounties blest; Shall I praise one, or All? for All are thine. Noe more will I admire the Southerne Shine, Nor Easterne perfumes, nor the wealth o'th' west; But thinke thee fairest, Sweetest, richest, Best; fforgetting Chaucer, and Dan Lidgate's Rhime; Loe here, the Glorie of our modern time, A learnèd Age; Since great Eliza?'s reigne And peace came in; the proud Italian And iustly proud in Poesie, will allow The English (though not Equall) next him now. The noble Sidney, crown'd with liveing Bayes; And Spencer, cheif, (if a peculiar praise May pass, and from the rest not derogate) The learnèd Jonson, whose Dramaticke State Shall stand admir'd Example, to reduce Things proper, to the light, or buskind Muse. Many the present Age afford, of which Heare ffalkland, Digbie, Beaumond, Carew, Rich, In their Composures Severall; with whom Maye, Allein, Randolph, Shirley, Rutter come; Sons of thy wombe all these; with whom may I (Though in a weake and humble Poesie) Thy glories Celebrate, and quitt the Score Nature obligeth me; I aske noe more. Not that I covet fame; let those high names Inherite all the Glorie of their Thames, And live to many ages, though I fall, In scornèd Dust, and have noe name at all: Suffice it I may sing vpon thy flood, Neglected Humber; or my Muse (lesse proud) Sport in the Sedges of my neighbouring Streame, Poore as my verse, neither deserving name. And may the village where I had my birth Enclose as Due, my Bodie in her Earth. A Pastorall Ode; The Eglogue is Lost. Come leave the Citie's strife And chuse a Countrie Life, There place my Ioyes; and let my wandring mind Be fixt, and there confin'd; There, with my lovèd Sheepe, And my owne Silvia, I as prince, can keepe, Crown?d Monarch, in her Brest, Equall loving, equall Blest; Come, come away, my thoughts, be fixèd here, ffor greater pleasures have y? greater Care. What though I doe not find My Galleries, there Lin?d With Atticke hangings, nor Corinthian Plate, (Ensignes of greater State Plac?d for more ornament) Is't in these vanities to find Content? I doe not Covet these; An humble Roofe may please An humble mind; and who can tell? there may Be troubled Thoughts in Downe, as well as Hay. Though Gray or Russet be My height of Gayetie, Though I nor Plush, nor gaudie Sattin have; Enough, I doe none Crave: What though, my Backe, or Thigh, Not Cloathèd be with Woole, in Tirian Dye! Nor Beaver's ffleece enrich My Browes! tis not the Itch Of Glorie takes me; I can often find In Garments trimme, a Discomposèd mind. The Colchian Bird's to mee Noe baite of Luxurie, Nor doe I seeke th' Ionian Partridge, more Then Hens, from my owne Doore; The Lushious oyster is, And Lobster, though of treeble price Not moveing; neither seeke I Spanish Wines, or Greeke, To Stirre my Spirrits: I can gladly bee Sated with lesse, and Shun the Luxurie. What tho' perhaps I want Beauties, and have no hant Where I may wanton, and quench lustfull fires; Noe need; for those desires I doe not harbour; Soe I flye the Sin, and the occasion too; ffor Silvia is to me More then varietie; In her deare Eyes I ioy, and can take thence A fflame of Modestie and Innocence. Noe Lustfull Raptures me Hold in Captivitie; I seeke noe wanton mistress, I can Spend (And wish time might not End,) Daies, and Years, with Silvia; Shee, to my pleasèd Thoughts, is more then they Can fancie, in their Dreams; I would, these foule extreames, Not less then Scylla, or Charibdis Shun; There is an Isthmus, I would fixe vpon. The gaudie Citie's pride, Nor what they boast beside, Nor their full Treasures, nor their furnisht roomes, Where Silken Madam comes; Not all the Cloaths they weare Nor their high feastings, and luxurious fare; Not Madam's selfe, can make Mee, countrie Life forsake; Noe; let them riot, revel, feast, and vant Their garments rich as these, the Sin I want. Ile shun Court Care, and the proud Citie's strife, Center my Ioyes, in a poore Countrie Life. The Spring. Now the Springe enters; now the Sun doth Cheare The quick'ned Earth; and trees by Cold made bare Now gin to bud; the Earth doth now begin To flourish, in her Sweet and glorious Trimme; The Silver Streams bound vp by winter's Cold Glide fairly, where they murmurèd of old; The goodly meadowes, russet late, and Dead, In a fresh Dresse, are now apparelled; The mountaine tops are bar?d, and where the Snow Late covered, the Spring begins to Shew. Thither, the Lads, dull'd with the winter's rest, To ioy in wonted Sports, doe gladly hast; Now Ioyes the Industrious Bee, and the Ant now (Embleme of Providence) her selfe doth Show, Warme in her winter's Store; doth now againe Labour, and make provision, to sustaine Her little bodie, for the after-day; Now flyes the maggot, in her paintings gay, (Signe of faire weather) and doth now invite Decrepit years, to tas't the Spring's delight. I will not call the Cuckooe, with the Spring, (Vnnatural foolish Bird) let her voyce ringe T' affright the Citie, and an Omen carrie Of ffate, to fooles, and old men, when they marrie; But here the Redbrest and gray Linnets Singe, The poore wren flutters with an Eager wing, To gaine yond' highest Sprig, and there doth pay A Ceremonious Himne, to welcome day; Whilst from that Grove, the haples Philomel Sweetly, though Sadly, doth her Storie tell; The little Dazies, shake their Deawie Locks, The ambitious woodbine climbs againe, and mocks The tardie Gilliflower; the lillye in Her liveing Robe of Innocence, doth Shine; ffor those of Cost and Art, to me are poor: Nature is Rich, and Curious in her Store; And this same Marigold, or violet here, To the transplanted Tulip, I preferre; Loe, where the Larke, borne on her active wing, Pouers forth her Song of Ioy, vnto the Spring; Lambs ioyous friske, and play now each with other, Neglect the Teate, and leave the Ewe, their mother; Inspirèd with the Time, may my Muse frame Notes with the Larke, be Sportive with the Lambe. The Difference. I knew him here alive, whose everie Breath Was Health, and med'cine 'gainst Disease and Death; Kept constant Times of Sleepe, and could not Eate But at set times, and of such kind of Meat; This, was grosse feeding, th' other, was foule &amp; nought; And such men, to infirmities that brought; This, full of Humor, that, decayed the Blood; This, was a binder; th' other was not good; Hee kept a Diet in his drinke, nor would Hee tast this, t'was too hot; and that, too cold; This, too too searching was; and that, did bring Inevitable Death, or a worse thing; But ffeumotorie, Wormewood, Sage, Rosemarie, Bettonie, and such moe, as make me wearie In the recitall; tunn'd in Liquor vp Each, to his Season; and that soveraigne Cup Of Antimonie cheifly (which he taught With as much Zeale as he from whom 'twas bought:) Hee kept 'em in a booke, the Cures 't had done, Of Sores, and Sicknes, all beneath the Sun; ffrom Raging ffeavers, even to that wee call A Beggar's Ague,—why, it Cures 'em all; ffrom the poore Village Scabbe, to the hot Pox, And all the Sores tooke from vnwholsome Smocks; It cures (almost a Miracle to see), The new-found Rickets, halfe-lost Leprosie; Wer't possible, 't would bring a Maidenhead Backe to the Partie, and revive the Deade; ffor 't has, from such an one, tane halfe a Score Odde doting years; from such, as many more; It has made an old Crazèd vsurer be seene Neglect his twenties, dote vpon fifteene; It has done feats, such as the Bath nor Spau Ere boasted; Such as England never Saw; Some, in his owne Experience; Some, he tooke ffrom worshipfull good Credit; and his Booke, It was the Best, he ever knew; and Hee Had read from Galen, downe to Alestree; Hee'd tell me soe; and say, he oft could take Things from th' Posteriors of an Almanacke, Very behoofull to the Regimen Of health; the Times, and Seasons, How and when Wee should apply all med'cine, in an Hower Soe Criticall, it might our Health assure; When best to Bath, and when 't was fitt to bleed, By way of Nature, or by way of need; When everie nat'rall office most prevailes; Knew when to blow his nose, or pare his Nailes; In everie thing precise; now, this he'ed eat, And the next meale, th' other was wholsome meat; ffruits, Some were waterish; windye Some; and then These, taken moderately, were good agen; To bedward, take this; next your heart, tomorrow, Eat this, or Drinke, and it will heale you thorow; This may your breakefast be; thus you may dine; Sup thus; but take a glass of this betweene; In anie Case, thus would he talke, and Strive With Cost, and Care, to keep himselfe alive; Hee Studied Med'cine, and obsequiouslye Ador'd his Custome; Yet I saw him Dye. When loe, another; in a Careles kind Gurmonds his Meat, and takes as he can find; Hee neer examines Health, but as he needs, Hee eats, or Drinkes; he never recks what breeds Humors, or Bloods; Sweating, and Broyling hot, Hee drinks cold water, and not knows a Iott Of Cold, or Sickness for it; he can goe Clad as in Summer, soe in frost and Snow; Neer knew the Cup, nor needs it; and the hard Names of Infirmities, make him more feard Then any sickness, in it selfe; for these Hee knowes, as Incident; and noe Disease Has soe much Terror to him, soe much ill, As an Apothecarie's misticke Bill; ffears Death not more then Phisicke; and the Time Observ'd by Star-gazers, concernes not him; The moone he values not, nor much the Signe, Vnles when virgo doth with Scorpio ioyne; His Zodiack's Gemini; and then he reck's Her thirteene Changes but to forty weeks; Tis Venus Yeare, let Luna?'s paler shine Gvild Nunneries, and all her Months vntwine, ffor poor despairing widdowes, that they may Cherish fresh hopes of a new wedding Day. And why are these lesse happie (but much more) Then the poore Milksop, you have seene before? Who like the Sottish Ape, with too great Care, Looseth his dearling Cub, his health, vn'ware; And then is glad to hug the hated whelpe, Infirmitie: I doe not scorne the helpe Of Phisicke, but contemne the rule, which some Put themselves in, a Liveing Martirdome; ffor who soe mad! (to Chuse,) would love disease, With Trouble, rather then his Health, with Ease; Yet some Men doe't: such wee can not wish worse Then still to suffer in their owne made Curse And may they langvish; for ev'n Charitie ffaints to give Selfe-Sold Slaves their Libertie. Parted, per pale. Whilest some Men Honours raise, from Dust and Sweat; And others labour to attaine the Seate Of ffavour, with a Prince; and others strive By grov?ling Industrie, but low to live; I thanke my Equall Starrs, which soe dispose, I'me neither Scorne nor Envie to my foes; I am noe Extract of a Prince's blood; Nor can I bring a line downe from the flood; I can not reach from Brute, nor bring my name Addition to the antique Brittish ffame; The Norman Conquest pussles my dispute; I dare not stand the tryall, in a suite; Nor say, from such a Knight, or such a Lord, I am deriv'd, and give a Herald's word. I will not bring an Ancestor againe ffrom such a Harrie, such an Edward's reigne; Reputed then a Squire; nor buy a Roll To boast my Predecessors by the Poll; Or shew the severall Matches blazon?d faire, Baron, et ffemme, and tell you how they beare Gules, or, vert, azure,—heathen words for Red, Yellow, green, blue; how fairly am I sted By fortune, that the Colours, which I claime Hereditarie, to my house and Name, Are but the Same, whereon, and with, I write, And which I love,—poor Common Blacke and White. I neither boast, nor Skorne, a faire discent, Noble, and Herald-vouchèd Ancient; But I contemne the vanitie of these As I doe Infamie; I would not please Arrogance, in a Sillable; but stand Ioy?d, to behold the honor and the Land, (Drawne from a noble Ancestrie) survive, And by a worthy Nephew, kept alive. I was not borne soe low; but would I bring Wind, to swell out the Bladder whence I spring, It would appeare as Eminent, as high, As those, who boast a longer Pedigree; And if not burst by malice of this Age, May stand as long; but, why should I presage A Ruine to my selfe? when those who now Put vp of late, and beare a hopefull brow May die forgotten; when those, yet to spring, Are fall'n, and none to speake of such a thing. When those, who glorye Heralds bookes, and all The Sin they sprung from, shall to nothing fall, I may survive; But what! is Poetrie Come to be Larded, with ranke Heraldrie? Soe some Cookes spoile good Meat; yet not amisse, ffor divers Palats; some like that, some this: And much good as they relish, may they finde, A Phesant, bacon-farc'd, or pure, in kind. Woman Charactred. Chast, as an aged Hermit, at his Death; ffaire, as the morning, sweeter then the Breath Of Violets; and as the Turtle, true; Where She affects, never enquiring new; And (seing the world 'counts it an ornament) She Shall be rich sufficient to Content; Not starrs, but equall Sunns, are her faire Eyes, Dressing the Sphere, where all perfection Lyes; Soe sweetly modest, as in either Eye (Without a gvide) men might read Chastitie; The common Praise, of Lillie, and the Rose, ffresh as in Iune, here in December growes; Her necke, her brest, her wast; (for lower, I Not dare to fall,) might ravish everie Eye; To adorne these, Motion, which in soe faire state Shee doth Expresse, Iuno might imitate; Sober, to speake, but when her Accents come, Minerva present, would be stricken dumbe; A Mind beyond Expression; vertuous, more Then Anchorit?s, ev?n in their Dying Hower; All these, in Woman; but which, which is Shee? All women, are soe; or at least, should Bee. Silvia revolted. When I, vnto the fameles Devia, now Vtter my song, the emptie winds disperse My Laboured Numbers, and let noe man know Their So?d: ah! there have I, in mightie verse, Had better Audience, of my fellow peeres; The proud Amintas did not scorne, to bow And give Attention; nor disdaine to ioyne His verses, with the notes which then were mine. When hee, the bright Vrbana magnified; And I my Silvia sung, in Equall Sound; Silvia, the fairest, mortall ever Eyed; But ah! my griefe! there is my heart's great wound. Sylvia, whom once I almost Deified, Revolted is; and newer Loves hath found. Ah faithles Silvia; whether shall I flye, ffor Passion, to enrage my Poesie. Whither! but to the Eyes of Silvia false? And dash my bitter Inke against their shine; Defame that glorious feature; which exalts Her name, to wonder, in some verse of mine; Crie recreant, and recant what ever calls Her faire, or worthy; Draw another Line And what I said, vnsay; or shall I keepe In modest limits; and let Passion Sleepe. I will not wrong her Name, which gave mine Life In a Cleare Mention; She to whom I sung A Thousand Sonnets, and brought Numbers rife, To Celebrate her Glories; She who hung My browes with virgin Chaplets; never greife Shall blind my Iudgment, with soe foule a wrong; But Silvia, in my verse, shall keepe a Seat, Though me she Scorne, and happilie forget. Though me She Scorne; and give her love away To proud Penandro; and the guiltie Crue Rivall her favours; I may see a Day, She will be glad to grace my love anew; Meanwhile, in Libertie, I will Assay My fancie (taught by her) and re-accrue My Thoughts into their Station; and then Scorne Her faith retracted, old, and overworne. Scorne returned. Are you the only faire, false Silvia? noe: 'Twas I that gave the lustre to your Eyes; And sung your Beauties greater farre &amp; moe Then Nature gave, or all the flatteries Of your deluding Glasse could ever Show. I plac'd a liveing Rose On either Cheeke; and drest Those Lipps faire, which disclose Pearles, in their liveing Nest. I drest, with polish't Ivorie that brow, And to your lockes put all the Sorceries Of Nature; 'twas I, brought All perfect Lineaments vnto your fframe; And in huge Numbers taught A Character of Beautie, in your Name. Then are you fond, to flye your owne desert; And your neglect, may bring my Love to Scorne; Ile chuse another, who in everie part Shall have more Sweets; farewell, oh false forsworne; Ile bring an Æthiope, and with small endeavour Raise better feature there, then you had ever. Supplanted. Disloyall Silvia; See What now your Scorne has done; I have my Libertye: Goe follow you your owne. I sing another Name, and sing her faire; Loe, where she Comes, with thousand Cupids sett In either Eye; and all the Sweets, which were Your beautie's prize, in her againe are mett; You were but what I sung you; when I call My verses backe, your Beauties vanish All. See; (to torment your soule) Who has tooke vp your place; I must Confesse, a foule Deformèd, Sootie face; Darke as the Night, her Eyes; her haire vndrest, Like Adders on her Curbèd Shoulders fall; Her Limnes Distorted, and her name profest, Leud Prostitute to Everie Stranger's call; Yet, in a liveing verse, I will transforme Her faults perfection, and her name adorne. Splitt your proud heart with greife, To know, another must Gaine, by my verse, a Life; When yours, hid in the rust Of Sad Decay, noe mention shall find; My deare Nicotiana is more true And not soe Common; (though with every wind She varie Love) and ffairer much then you: This Common Strumpet of the Times, to you Is ffaire, and Chast, (and though still changeing) true. To Nicotiana. A Rapture. Come, my Nicotiana; weele renew Our free delights, and Appetite pursue; Wee fearles will Enioy those reall Ioyes Lovers would paint, in their fantasticke toyes; And boldly Iustifie what wee have done, Though thousand Curious Eyes were looking on. Come; with a hundred Blandishments weele trye Strange Subtleties, in Love's great misterie; In varied formes, thy pliant Limbes shall cast Their knots, at once about my necke and wast; Thy poudred Tresses, over mine shall spread, And strangelye mixt, make it but all one head; Close, as the power of Love can Ioyne vs, then Wee will new Ioyes invent; such as the Pen Of wanton Poets pussle; my free hand Noe bashfull blush shall ever Countermand, But in a Thousand formes, thy Tresses part And slide along, with vncontrollèd Art, Thy daintie Bodie; not to fear a frowne, ffor soyling of thy new white Sattin Gowne; My willing Lips shall part, to catch thy Breath, Sweet, as the Hony-deaw, which Hybla hath. There will I hang; and all my veins inspire With Ardent Wishes, taken from thy fire; Hard on my Lips, thy wanton tongue shall press, And by new Chimistrie in Wantonnes, Send the rich Qvintessence of all I seeke, In Dalliance through that faire Alimbecke: There will I sucke, with Cunning Industrie, Thy Spirrits Extracted by Love's Alchimie. When we 'are be-qualm'd, that long imbraces has Made dull Desire, and wee shall only passe ffaint breathings, I will summon a fresh Store Of Vigour, farre more Active, then before; And with neat Tittilations, new provoke Decaied fire in thee, to the full Stocke; Invent new postures, &amp; out-doe the old ffictions, to make 'em Storie; when with bold Vncurbèd flames, wee grapple; and not part, But to renew our Action, and our Art. Let fooles be modest; and the novice say Hee did the Act, where no Eye could betray; Such pettie fears, our gen?rous Thoughts despise, Our pleasure is made rich by many Eyes; And with an Equall glorie, wee dare vye, In Artfull Sleights, to all the Standers by; Such Confidence is manly; doth appeare Worthy all Titles, wee can glorie here; Thus, my Nicotiana, wee will move Careles who see; fearles who know our Love. The farewell. Thus could I foole away my Time, in Toyes; And paralel her Name (Obscure) to all your fame; Create a Harmonie, to all the Ioyes I had, in Love, of you; draw threds of praise Into a Volume; and Erect A Trophie, to out-shine you, many waies; But know, I doe neglect Trifles of ffemale Love; I will not draw A line, to Eyther, more then idle howers Permit; (when I releasèd from the Awe Of Sober thoughts) if lighter ffancie Skowers Like wanton Hobbies, at a Dore; then well In Skorne and Mockage, of your falshood, tell Perhaps I may: Farewell. An Epode. Farre, from the Cittie's Strife; as far from fame, I wish to keepe my name: Careles of popular vote, or vaine Applause, To mine, though for Iust Cause; Let the bright Inke, which Phebus doth distill Through everie Noble Qvill, Run in a Clearer path; had I bene borne Below my fate; the Scorne Of other men; and had noe more extract Then what my selfe could Act; Yet in this obscure fortune, had I ben Capable of a Pen; I would have Squar?d a way, for my owne verse, As void of vulgar fears, As overborn by Selfe opinion; I would have made my owne Iudgment, an Equall Arbiter, to Define The worth of everie Line; And let ffastidious Censures of the Times Gvild loose and borrowed Rhimes; Such, who or want or what they have, betray To the most Sordid way Of Ignorance. Such as affect the vote Of Stentor-follie's Throte, Or ravil out the Loome of all their witt, To play Court-Parasit'. These waies I hate and Scorne; if what I penn'd ffell to soe base an End, My gviltye Qvill would splitt, my Inke would rise Into my face and Eyes. Iudge, Great Apollo! if I have done ought With a presumptuous Thought, That any name could make my numbers flye Beyond their Poesie. To noe Collossus could I ever bend, Or at the Court attend, With my owne Sin and ffollie in a Sheet; To prostrate at the feet Of painted greatnes. Not a Lord, one drop Of my Iust Inke, shall hope Beyond his merit: I dare not abase Soe much, my free-borne Muse; But vtter Truth. It is not in their ffate To raise, nor Terminate, A true Composure. Wee admire the Good, Without Alloy of Blood; And Iustly praise them, beyond all the Date Of Brass or marble State. We adde to them, if Either, and doe give Their Vertues breath, to live, In Mention; and the honour of one Name Shall nere be old with ffame. But 'tis Enough; I hate a Servitude Either to Might, or to the Multitude. To the Memorie of the most worthy and excellently vertuous Ladie The Ladie Alford. Obijt: 1.6.3.6. An Elegie. Say not the Marble's hard, nor those Seas cold Where Winter, vndisturb?d, his Court doth hold. Noe more the Steele needs Hammers; harder farre Then Stone or Steele; colder then North Seas are, Or Scythian Snow; some say, a heart is found. Let that heart hear this verse &amp; it will wound Him to the Qvicke; for marble drops to Dust, Christall resolves, Steele softens in his Rust, To hear't; or let me speake; for (She commands Who ballanceth the world with vnbrib?d hands). Iustice commands my Qvill, &amp; bids me tell The Erring world, it never knew her well. I might Speake Miracles: should those who stray In Libian wasts and sad Hircania Repeat her Storie, Tigers would be mild, Lions forget their hunger; the still wild Indomitable Ounce, instead of blood, Would licke their Tears, &amp; weepe another flood. Should men (then Beasts more Savage) such as are Arabian Theeves, or Cham's curst ofspring, heare Such a Divinitie, in Nature taught; Thei'd leave their Barbarisme, &amp; be brought Glad Penitents to vertue: Her Name might Informe a Scythian; the dull Muscovite, Bound in the Ice of Servile Thoughts, might take A fflame from Honour, and all Rapture speake. How then may I (who gather not from ffame, Vertues, which give the Lustre to her Name, But one who knew her Such) while I should here Give her vp to the World, but turne all Feare? Ah! might some better Qvill, with better Art, Sing her a patterne; whilst my opprest Heart Might rue the Losse in Silence, and shee Bee Safer Committed to Posteritie. Ah, might it be! but since it must not be, I tender here, my Zealous Elegie; To say She was, (what everie Pen can Say) Vertuous in Particulars; wee may Dilate 'em Severallie; but if I shall Expresse her trulie, Shee indeed was All. But looke not here to finde her. See her name And read her Storie in the Booke of Fame; There hap'lie you may find it. Oh! recant; Draw backe that word. How narrow, and how scant Fame gives a vertue? Ah, her lavish Breath Is but to let the world know of some Death Or novel ffarley. Presentlie Shee Dyes; A false and weake record of Memories; ffor Envie lackies Fame, &amp;, as she will, Takes from the good, and gives it to the Ill. Oh looke not there to find her; she was farre Too good for Fame to tell, or Men to heare. Noe, cast thy Eyes vp yonder; put away Thy foule Corruptions and thy Weights of Clay. Strip, Strip thy Soule, light as the Aire, and pure As Innocence, to quitt the Earth, and veiw her, Seated in Glorie. Oh, there looke and read Her Name and vertues, fairlie Charactred. Melt, Stonie Hearts and Eyes; come weep with Mee; Ne're had wee cause, till now, of Elegie. Now, if your Passions will give leave, weele ioyne Our Stupid Brains, and Drop, perhaps, a Line To her, or Word; or if not soe, our Tears Shall speake a Sorrow, though wee want a verse. Nor that while Thames has water, or can vant One Swan or Cignet, can She ever want, Though mine should faile; (but ffate forbids to dye The verse which stands to keepe her Memorie). ffor there, first Ayre She breathed; hither Sent To the Dull North, to be our ornament; And give a Splendor, which wee may admire, And blesse, now Dead; whilest at the Hallowed fire, I light my Taper, and am told to bee (Soe farre as now my greife gives Libertie,) Her Poet in my best. But ah! my Teares Qvench my Dimme Taper, and conclude my verse. To: D: i .1.6.3.7. Rare Mirror of the Age, who dost present All formes to Life, and all Time represent In its owne Colours; dost aright discerne Twixt vertue and ostent; whence Men may learne To vndeceive themselves, in their Surmise Of former Times, more vertuous or more wise. Wee'r mad; Mad All; Our grandsires mad as wee; Their ffathers mad; Mad from all Ancestrie. ffrom high'st to lowest, from the worst to the best; ffrom Kings to Pesants, from the Sordid Nest Of Infamie, to where the Eagle builds. From Groves to Cities; &amp; from thence to feilds. Who's free? Not Broome-men, nor the baser sort, Who dress the Citie, and defile the Court. Not Hee, whose Acres gave his Father Witt. They carrie ffate; Hee shall run Mad with it. Not he, whose birth's his Boast; nor Hee, whose blood Was drawne from Dunghills, or the fearfull wood: Who calls a Halter Heraldrie, and Swears His father found Armes where he lost his Ears. Lend me thy Spirrit, that I may pronounce Power, Povertie, Pride, Basenes mad at once. Bring in the Antique fopperie. Loe here A Civicke Garland, which was bought too Deare. Bring in the Paphian Shrub, by soft hands knitt Into a Chaplet; or sad Willow gett. Th' Athenian olives bring; bring Atee's wreath; Roses or Cypress, Mariage or Death. Bring Grasse or Ivie, or the Laurel hither, Bound in a faggot; mad, mad Altogether. Burne 'em for Shame, and let vs rather Chuse Long nose-bell'd Horses, such as Children vse; Cimbals for Dinne; and Shittle-Cocks for play; The Peacock's Tayle, to make our ffrontlets gay; All Bedlam-witted, walke in Bedlem wise, With long-eard Caps, and Bells to make a noise. Wee're mad at home, as if wee should repaire To China, for Digression of Ayre; Mad beyond Cure. 'Tis well. Let's All together, Poets and Poleticks, no matter whither, T' our long-lost Ithaca, hoise sailes, away, ffor Hellebore, to the Anticyra. Ha! ha! Democritus; let's laugh to see Bedlam the gen'rall Vniversitie. Wee have gain'd a freedome, in what others lost; And Poets are but Equall mad at most. What is it that the world will now advance? All Learning, vanitie; and vertue, Chance. One's mad to lavish out; He?'s mad to Spare; That with a Numerous Issue; this noe Heire. Some, Shaddowes please; another banns his ffate. Hee's rapt; another rages Desperate. This loves an outward forme; that fashion loath's. Be'it but in clean-washt hands or well-made Cloathes. Hee'le Dance; another Doats. This Sings, that's Sad. Lines tending to a Centre all; They'r Mad. There are Degrees of Madnes in our Schoole; ffrom wisedome's Chaire, to the cold Porch of ffoole. Deep Plotts are Madnes; Mirth Distraction; One's talking Mad, another more in Action. This great Intruder will not let alone Religion. Oh, it makes Religion A Thousand ffaces vnder one selfe Hood: And Each is best, where but one can be good. Some are precise; Some their owne thoughts pursue; One keeps the old; that, runs to everie new. This makes Religion for me &amp; nothing else; That loves the Steeple, but he hates the Bells; Makes Schisme Zeale; takes Doctrines from a Dreame; And tears the Coat, because it had no seame. Organs fright some; another hee's not able To heare the Altar called more then Table. Soe painted Windows were defac'd, and All Salisburie Church was thought Apochriphall. S?, Had I langvage, I would Court the flame Of your abundant thought, and give a Name, Yong in the world, your Rivall. I have beene Sometimes admitted, and in Raptures seene (That Empresse of Humanitie, who rules Vs in our Selves, the Monarchie of Soules:) Your owne Ægeria. S?: let vs be free, (As dying Hermits on Earth-pillowes bee) ffree from the fate of Rivalls, to repine Her too much being Yours, too little Mine. Let foolish Lovers who bring viols in To Lust's hot Qveene of well-apparell'd Sin; Who sleepe in Silken Laps, on Roses tread, And know noe fate beyond a Maidenhead; Let them be iustly Iealous for the Cause, And Cruciate themselves by their owne Lawes. Not that I hope to Live by Verse, or seeke To gaine my Name an Inch by what I speake. Not that I'me poor, or proud; or hope, or feare, To Dye, or Live, with or without a Teare; Write I this Paper only that I might Let the world know how I receiv?d your Light; That I might Shew how much I doe Admire; (I dare not Envie Say) such a retire. But that's a Common fate, and may be tooke The way to Sordid Ends. I love your Booke, The harvest of your Time; through which I trace Vnited Rapture with diffusive Grace. But let not, S?, my lost words take you from Your better Thoughts. Ile rather stay at home, A willing hearer, and my owne Thoughts please Vpon your Labours, to my vse and Ease. To the Memorie of the Best Dramaticke English Poet Ben: Ionson: .1.6.3.8. Great Flame of English Poets gon! how shall Wee strew our flowers at thy Funerall? What obsequies performe! what rites prepare Vnto thy Herse? What Monument but were Too narrow to Containe Thee! or what State But were beneath the honour of thy fate? Noe, rather, wee (remaining of the Tribe, Sad Orphans) can but wish what wee ascribe Vnto thy Merit. All wee bring to thee, Is but our Tears, our filial Pietie. Great Lord of Arts, and Father of the Age! The first and best Informer of the Stage! How shall wee speake of him? what Numbers bring T' empassionate, and worthy Orgies Sing? What Shall we Say? Shall wee in a Iust Zeale, Rebuke the Age of Ignorance, and tell Aloud his Merits? Shall wee weepe, or boast His worth? or Losse? shall wee say, when wee lost Him, a sad Night of follie did orespread This Iland, as wee see, and wee are dead, Rather then Hee wee weep for? For Hee still Lives to instruct the Age with a Strong Qvill. And as he did from Ignorance reduce Th' abusèd Stage, Soe has he left to vs, (Who act vpon this greater Theatre) Grave morall Pandects, Strong, &amp; yet soe Cleare Hee is his owne Expositor; and wee (If sottishly not blind or worse), may see Vertue in Act; and everie gracefull Step She treads may be our Path; but wee all Sleepe, Vncapable of what Hee taught; or how To valew what Hee left vs. I could bow (And would the Age might doo't without offence) To name him, with a Modest Reverence. For Shall wee kneele to Titles? and observe fformalities to those, who nought deserve? (More then their Name or painted outside give) And shall My Lord have a prerogative ffor vertue, in his Ancestors? (though hee Perhaps the Shame of all his Pedigree;) And our Great Lord of witt, where vertue in Her Sphere did move; where Art and Iudgment Shine, (Inseparable) bee with Common Men, And vulgar Mention named? oh! the Pen Of Witt and Truth forbid it! Rather let The worthles present Age his Name forget. For wee are Emulous fooles, and will admitt Noe Rivalls in the Claime wee lay to witt. But After-Ages, (more Iudicious, Vswaied by Passion, only Sedulous To honour vertue,) shall, (I will not Doubt) Advance his Name; when the despisèd Rout (His Scorne) shall perish, in the filthy Smoake Of their owne Follies. Then, all Eyes shall looke With Ioy and Admiration, to receive A Light their Fathers could not. I will leave Only this little: Iudgment shall Allow, (When Men have Eyes to see &amp; witt to know Who merit most) the greatest Eulogie, For Langvage, Art, and all Dexteritie Of Witt, to Him: and happ'lie were the flame Extinct, wee might recover't in his Name. A Charme soe stronge, Who ever shall reherse Ben: Ionson, cannot chuse but make a verse. Vpon Ben Ionson's Booke. Bee not Deceiv'd (Dull world) Hee is not Dead; Rumor is false; open His Booke, and read. It is Himselfe; there, Everie Scene affords Words above Action; Matter beyond Words. If, Readers, what I say, will not suffice T' evince your follies, I dare bid you twice What yet you have not Done; open and Read; Recant, or else 'tis You, not Hee, that's Dead. To my Muse. Awake, awake! See through thy Curtains Spred, Aurorae blushes, having left the Bed Of old Tithonius. How She quitts the place, With hairs Discheveld ore her ruddie face! Rise, and salute her, crie a haile vnto her, Prevent Appolloe, her more Active wooer: See, how he brisks himselfe, within yond Clovd, Readie to Enter. Now the Horses proud Breath fire, &amp; trample with a furious heat, To hurrie in the Splendent Chariot. Yet Open thy Eyes (Dull Muse) and let in Day, Th' hast, as well as Hee, a word to Say. Now tis too late; th' hast lost (ah rue the fate) A Time, which even the God, would Emulate. Wounded. See, how my Goddess, from her well-stored Qviver, Did take a Shaft, and how She hast'ly sent it At a poor Hart, (poor Heart) and peircèd never; And therfore, happilie, She rather ment it: But whither 'twer by Chance, or witting done, Shee, shee can only tell: But with the blow he fell; And thrill'd by her keen Shaft, laments and greiv's alone. The gallant Heard, (proud heard,) and happie Heard, Who never yet were peirc'd; how stately they Pace ore the fertile Launds! vnhurt, vnfeard: How now this wounded Heart they drive away, Who whilome was the fairest Beast impal'd, The fforsters cheife delight; By hap, or rather Spight Pines, Langvishes, and now is Dead, ere he knew what Hee ayld. The Dedication of a Poem, now lost; written in the Royall Expedition against the Scotts. To the King. All fitt to serve you, in this great Designe, Where Action fires brave Minds, to entertaine Bright hopes of honour; and your Subiects stand A Gvard to you, a Glorie to your Land; Where Armes are only vsefull. Sir, excuse (When now Bellona thunders) a Sad Muse, Who can noe other way her Tribute bring; But a weake forme of words, the offering Of a neglected Poet, who to Fame, Bequeaths his Numbers, rich in your great Name. Tho' Sir; if I were happie, this might live A Time beyond what all your Annalls give; And when the brasen Trumpe of Historie Shall splitt with Time, and to Posteritie Give scarce the Names of your dead Ancestors; When Statues, Monuments, and high-rear'd Towers Shall drop to Dust, and lye forgotten, in A heape of Ruines; when the mouth of Sin Shall spitt vpon Iust vertues and deface The Light of Truth, and Maiestie disgrace; When all the world shall suffer, in her Iawes; Wee stand Secure, and doe not feare the Lawes Of Surly fate, nor the Decrees of Time; Confident in the force of mighty Rhime. But Franticke Poets erre: 'tis you can give A Life to verse. The great Prerogative Of Numbers cannot stand without the Breath Of Maiestie; that only frees from Death, Creates a Poet, and gives verse her wings; This, Sir, wee know; and thus this Poet Sings. This was plac?d in the End of the Same Poeme. To the King. Thus, S?: againe I kneele. May heaven blesse Your high Designes, with Glorie and Successe. May victorie Attend you. But how low Imperfect Wishes fall, to what wee owe? May you be great and Happie, and Survive Glorious to ffame; that Poets may derive (Poets long Ages hence), from your great Name All their Invention, all their Art, their Flame. I need not wish (what Heaven ordains) the Glorie Immortall, when y'have past this Transitorie. I would not live to See the Change; though once I know it must. Long, long 'bove fate, or Chance, May you reigne here; and then I wish as much Glorie as Immortalitie can touch. Enough! and if these Accents strike your Ears With the least pleasure, I will bring a verse To your Great Name, shall be an Emulation To all the haughtie Poets of your Nation. My hopes live in your Breath: and to your Eyes My Numbers fall. The Poet lives or dies, As you pronounce. Sir: you may raise a Name From obscure Nothing, to the Best of Fame. A Name in nothing happie, but to Sing The Glories of soe Great, soe Good a King. One desiring me to read, but slept it out; Wakening. Nay, doe not Smile: my Lips shall rather dwell For ever on my Pipe, Then read to you, one word, or Sillable. You are not ripe To Iudge, or Apprehend Of Witt. Ile rather Spend Six howers together in Tobacco-taking, Then read to you, and cannot keep you wakeing. One boasting himselfe Iudge of pure Witt. Are you the Judge of Witt? Dread Monarch, haile! What haughtie Poesie Comes with vn-humbled knee To pay due homage? Willinglie I vaile The faire pretences which I might alledge. Dread Monarch, Haile! Are you the Iudge? Wee cannot fayle In our expectancies. How iustly fitt, From Nettles to the Bay, He will dispose? Noe way T' evade his Castigations. I would Spitt A little Rheume before my Triall come. Adiourne thy Court, one hower at lest; For be it knowne, I now am prest Vpon a Sad Designe: That done, I prostrate all the little Mine Vnto thy Doome. Reversed Noe, noe, Ile rather suffer all the brand Of Infamie Envie or Ignorance can thrust, than stand To any Hee For Iudgment. Hee, that would assume the Chaire, Is sway'd beyond The strength of his owne Mind, By vulgar Passions. Had he kept the Square Of Equall Reason, I had bin A vassall to his vote: But when I saw Follie creep in, Applauded for his Coat; I sate me downe, and rather chus'd to give My verse to Everie Eye, then by him Live. For him I valued, as a man, refin?d From all the Drosse Of Time, or Fashion of a Steddie Mind; Brought to noe loss With Envie, nor exalted with the Name Of high-borne witt; Knew all the Rights were fitt In a true Poesie; could distingvish Flame; But oh! vnequall Iudge! none more Was in Affection blind, Proud, bitter, Envious: &amp; noe power To rectifie his Mind. This when I saw, Thought I, who cannot gvide His owne Affections, How shall I be try'de? Ænigma. A crabbèd Stumpe: yet Sillie Husband's Care, (Too much Indulgent, to the great impaire Of his more profitable Howers), did dresse And Manure it; more valewing encrease From this vnhopefull Impe, then all the Store Hee had beside; and he had many more: And what his Art, or Industrie, could bring To make it fresh, he did, in everie Thing; Still was it Seir. Noe Leafe would ever peepe Or Blossome Spread; but Nature as asleepe Continued in the Trunke. The Husband (wed To his first vndertakings), Cherishéd The hopeles Stocke, with more then common Care; And, to a better Soyle and better Ayre Transplanted it; yet could he gather small Or little Hopes that it should beare at All; Only a liveing Sap it did retaine, (Without all verdure: thus it did remaine Thrice Seaven Summers, without any Show To repay his great Care. At last one Bough, Without or Leafe or Blossome) did produce A ffruite, of bitter and vnsavorie Iuice. Some who did tast it, wormewood would compare Vnto its relish; and some others Sweare Henbane had lesse of venome; for in Strange Tumors it blister'd; and the blood did range With an vnwonted Heate and violence, Through the infected Bodies. Such offence Came in its first production: still the fond Artificer would hope something beyond; Though the Cheife Gard'ner would have had it cast Into the ffire, (or throwne out with the wast.) Hee, with a Cultivating Hand, doth give It all the Rites, for which, perhaps, in five, Sixe, or Seaven yeare (though Leafe, nor other green It ever had the least), there has bene Seene Some fruite, which I, in Curiositie Once tasted: tis a harsh one, and a Drie; Worse then a Medler; but more Calme, more Safe Vnto the Palat, then the first by th' halfe. Loe here, the Issue, of his hopes. And now Againe it is declin'd; for such as know Fruit by appearance, thinke the last year's fruite Deadlie, a Aconite; and in the root Some say a Canker lyes; to gnaw, and wast The tree, vnverdant from the first to the last. Nor is it Strange (and take the Sence togither;) The Thing, which never flourished, should Wither. Fame. Mortall, wouldst thou wooe a Feature In a glasse? or please thy Eye With a Shadow, for a Creature; Or bring all thy hopes to Dye In the Earlie Spring of Nature, For a breath of vanitie? Or resigne what you may claime To the vogue of vulgar ffame. Qvickly Come, and here behold The Strange Mirror she presents: Earth and Ashes, Seeming Gold, To enrich your Monuments. Frees from Envie, keeps from old The feature of your faire intents; Publisheth in liveing Storie All that can adde to your Glorie. Would you be thought rich or wise? Valiant? or be ever yong? Handsome? nothing Shee denies, That has being from the Tongve. Were you odious for your vice, Infamous, as could be Sung; Time should keepe your Monument Vertue's liveing ornament. But noe more, let Sence retire, And with Reason's Eye Survay The vast Shadow you admire, Waneing, wasting, with the Day. Time is false and Fame a Liar: Vertue only, fixt, and may Create, beyond the breath of fame, A Thousand Honours to your Name. Agonie. Oh, I am Cold: the wombe of Earth may thaw My frost; not waters in their Current draw Such Chillnes: I am Cold As the Sad house of winter, or the ffeet Of Rocks involvéd where the waters meet; And yet I am not old. Oh, I am Sad; as virgins, when they loose Their pregnant hopes of him they meant for Spouse; Or widdowes, in their Fate. Sad, as a Parent for his hopefull Heire; Or as a Prince depriv?d of Crowne and Chaire; Yet hardly know for what. Oh, I am wounded: deeply strucke, and beare The fatall Iaveline, with me everie where; Into the Marrow thrill?d, A Thousand Dolours now assaile my hart, Of which, Alcides hardly knew a part; And yet I am not kill'd. Oh, I am Sicke: as women in their throes, Or men in rageing feavers; to my woes The Gout and Stone are Ease; Fire in my Brest, and Poison fills my veins; Bane in my Breath, and Frensie in my brains; Yet know not my Disease. Oh, I am Dead: if it be death to dwell In Shades of night, in Mansions next to Hell, In fears and Miserie; In Darknes, where noe hope of Light can enter; In greifs vnpittied, as though in the Center; And yet I cannot Dye. An Essay; Endeavouring to ennoble our English Poesie by evidence of latter Qvills; and reiecting the former. Shall I be onlye Hereticke in Witt? Forbid Appolloe, rather let me Splitt My lab'ring Qvill to Death. Noe, when I first Enterd a Poet, Modestie (the worst Companion of Sedition), brought me on In tremblings and faint Sweats. I did not run To Snatch the Laurel and vsurpe the wreath To my owne Browes; but dasht with everie Breath Of a supposéd Censure, happilye, lost The Glorie of my Youth. Then be it most Abhorring to my Thoughts, to lay a New Foundation, or varie from the true Vndoubted Rites of Poesie; or bring But Cleare and pregnant Reasons, any Thing. This Ingenuitie and Candor must Allow of fforce; and if a Schisme thrust In all my verse, a monstrous Horne, or foot Cloven, to light of Iudgment, blot me out Of fair opinion; and my Name Ile give Vp, Witt's Apostate, ever more to live. Nor would I yet be bitter, or engage My selfe in Controversie to the Age, With Sword and Buckler Langvage; but, withall The Modestie of Truth and Reason, call A long-spread Error backe; and ratifie Some proofes to free me from this Heresie. Shall wee, who are made Iudges then, and keepe Minerva?'s holie Balance, fall asleepe? And let the giddie Rout give weight and poise To Indesert? For Shame; let vs arise And yet informe the Age. Shall wee derive Our English fflame, our Glories Primitive From antique Chaucer? Blesse me witt, if right Were onlie right, I feare a present night Would cover all his Credit. This I wage Onlye for Truth; in reverence to the Age Wherein he writt. But to the proof, and see Her firme Records, kept by Mnemosyne. See, antique Greece, and see her in her Spring, Verdant and glorious; not lesse flourishing At her first rise then after. Heare the String Of sacred Orpheus, or hear Linus Sing; Or to the Prince of All, Mæonides, Attend with reverence. Tell me, were not these When (Learning hardly Crept) bright Suns? and Shine Even to these Times of ours, with Light Devine? ffull in exalted Rapture, Poesie Appeares in them almost a Prodigie. Survay the Catalogue of Splendent Rome; Cæsar-supported Maro; yet by whom Has he bene Equall'd for a Steddie verse? Wonder at Ovid, when Hee doth reherse The Change of Things. What mightie flame doth fill His varied ffancie, to enrich his Qvill? A Thousand moe, in her bright Roll appear?d Of everie Nation; Poets who have rear'd The Laurel famous; whom we iustlie Call The learned Fathers of Apolloe's Hall. And shall the seelie Age? (with noise, and Stuffe Like his owne writings) blow at Chaucer's Snuffe? To light our English fflame? Where doth he rouse The fresh prun'd ffeathers of an Active Muse? Where doth he stretch a Wing? or kicke his Clod? But still his Fancie is his greatest Load. How liveles his Conceipts? He doth not rise Like ancient Poets, in huge Extasies Of vncontrolléd ffancie, to Survay Inestimable Nature. I might say Much more to vindicate this Argument; That in-authenticke Chaucer's furnishment, Adds nothing to our Poesie, in his Store; Nor let vs call him Father anie more. And you (who hardly out of Iudgment) would Seeme to defend him; cause you have bene told Your Grandsires Laugh'd once at his Baud'rie Laid out in Rime; (forsooth rare Poetrie!) But where he comes the nearest what you meane, You'r wearie, there your selv's, and leave him Cleane. Perhaps you'le say, (as you have heard some say) He was a glorious Poet at that day. And why that Day? was ffancie in a Cage? Rapture impounded? 'twas in the Darke Age; (As you would call it) when the former Sung; Scarce then had witt more then her mother tongve. And yet they gain'd the Sphere, from whence wee bring Our Cheifest Flowers, our best Embellishing. Forget Third Edward's raigne; They did not write In that Age with the Spirrit they could fight. For then I'de yeild; (and in my Conscience wee Vse Pens, as well as Swords;) Suffice it, Hee Was disadvantagéd of naught in Time But Langvage; which wee never made a Crime. Why may not wee better exempt his Name Then vse it? adding nothing to our ffame; And take the Radix of our Poesie To honour more in this last Centurie, The noble Sidney; Spencer liveing Still, In an abundant fancie; Ionson's Qvill Ever admir'd; these iustly wee may call Fathers; high-placed in Apolloe's Hall. But then wee want Antiquitie, as well Dan Geoffrie wants his Age; for wee might tell Of antique Brittish Druids, and bring in A hundred Rhiming Fellowes, that have bin Tall Men at Meeter. One there was that Sung I know not in what Number, nor what tongve; A gallant Storie of Giganticke ffeats, Inchanted Castles, onsetts, and retreats Innumerable; of a flying Bull And six blue dragons. Oh most worshipfull! Bring in these ffopperies, because they Smell Mustie and antiquated, therefore well. Come to a Clearer Light: doe not delude Your selves (heroicke English) to intrude His name, the Cheif, in your faire pedigree: Worthe is still worthy in it selfe; were Hee (Good Man) alive to heare it, sure as ought Hee'd thinke you lost more then he ever taught; To heare the Crue come in with open Mouth And Crye, oh Chaucer! Chaucer has a Tooth; Oh perilous! and soe he had a Tongve: Read him againe, heele shew you how it hung. But let not me, my first Designe out goe; (Which was vpon Sound Arguments) to Shew A Spring more worthy; whence wee may derive With greater Honour, the Prerogative Of English Poesie; and Clearlie evince Noe Age can be call'd Darke to a Cleare Sence, As in the Ancients. This I doe, and must ffreely averre, which, if the Age will thrust Vpon me, as an Heresie, how Cleare Stand I to Iudgment? I can never feare Such Censure from the wise; and I contemne Loud ffollie in a Thousand: fitteth them, And Mee with them, better to let it fall, And please them in a Canterburye Tale. Prevention! Twas Late and Cold; when with a mightie Flame Possest, I, to my quiet Studie came; Rich in a high-pitch'd Rapture, well-compos'd In every Facultie: my thoughts dispos'd In sober Contemplation, of a Brave Designe in witt, a Fancie which might save A Name to Honour, and almost create Eternitie, and Time anticipate. Qvicke forméd in each part; soe strong, soe pure, I could not wish a better; and Ime sure The pregnant Age, a richer could not boast; Which surelie might, (had Poesie bene lost), Have rais'd a liveing flame, but (oh, the Sad Curse of Posteritie) when now I had Survaied it true, in all Dimension, Of perfect feature, and the holie Crowne Had kist with humble Reverence, which then I thought vnrivall'd Mine, and kist agen; I had the rich Idea in my braine, Soe livelie fitt, so prest to entertaine My willing Qvill, and had my pen soe neare, I thought it done; but was prevented here. The harvest of my Time, in which I thought To reare my liveing Name, now fell to nought; ffor busie, how to thawe my Iet, to Inke, It fled my thought before I ought could thinke: That Peice for which I thought from future Times T' have gain?d whole Hecatomb?s of Tribute Rhimes, Lost in a Cloud, I know not how, nor where, Nor doth a Member of that forme appeare. Starrs inauspicious never knew to Crosse Our prosperous Muses with a greater Losse; When, manie years hence, I this verse shall read, 'Twill Splitt my soule with greife, when I am dead: Depriv?d Posteritie shall teare this Sheet, Distracted in the ffate, to thinke how great A flame might once have warm'd 'em. I could teare A Rheme to Atomes, and all Qvills forsweare, While I repeat it. Had the greedie fflame Snatcht all my Trifles, and but left my Name This Trophie, I had stood above all rage Of present Malice, or an ignorant Age. This glorious fruite! halfe-ripened! to be lost, In the Cold bowells of a greedie ffrost, Has raised in me a fire of Rage, to thawe The Articke Circle, and make void all Lawe Of winter, to the Russian. I could melt Those ever Rocks of Ice, which never felt One ray to warme them; make a Sea to fflow Within the Continent of Alpine Snow. But I am blind in Furie, and transgress, All modest rules; loosing, in Emptiness Of Passion, future Glories; and almost, In Error, has my fantasie more lost, Then late, in Accident; Yet will I Charme Thy Subtle power, fearing a future harme. Let Winter dwell vpon the Island Shore, And with his breath bind Shallow waters ore; Fetter, in Gviues of Christall, the full Streams Of Tanais or Volgha; whilst our Thames Runs with vntroubled waters, in a Cleare And even Course. Thou hast noe Title here; Why on my Standish, Tirant, didst thou fall? Thou hast not right to freeze an Vrinall; Doth not the bright-haird God in glorie Shine (Throughout this Ile to crush all Power of thine) Phebus, assistant to all brave designe? Ah then, why did he suffer this of mine To perish? sure Hee is not as of old (When Witt Succeeded) antique Poets told, Soe much a freind vnto the harmonie Of Numbers, and true ayme of Poesie. Either he never was, or he has lost, Latelie, the Soveraigntie which they All boast. Or if he be the nourisher of witt, Why would he suffer Ice to smother it? Noe! Phebus is my foe, or he has Swore, Since Ionson Dyed, t' allow his Heirs, noe more: I know not what to Iudge; but if I live, Ile trye this Fancie fled, how to revive. The many Scurrile Pamphlets (going vnder the name of Poems,) frequently printed; occasion'd this. Shall I be Silent? cause I am not heard In the full Croud? noe; let the Pile I rear'd, Tumble vpon my head, ere stand to be An obiect of their Praise or fflatterie. I must Confes, a Novice in the world, I Courted her Applause, &amp; my verse hurl'd Into her Lappe; and my Ambition Was, not to be a Poet, but soe knowne; And have my Name made ffamous: this, I sought, And gain'd. But ah, I wish all this were nought: I now retract my follyes, and Contemne The vulgar in their Noise. I would not seeme To be at all from them; nor did I seeke Opinion meerely, when I was most weake; But to the Modest flights of a yonge Muse Encouragement; not Praise, but an Excuse. And this I did, not to the vulgar Crue, But to the Serious head and Sober Brow. Drawne out by whom, I ventur'd on the Stage Of Censure, with my Poems to the Age; And found Enough of Candor, to the Ayme Of what I hop?d. Thus entred into ffame, I trode a larger Step, and ventur'd on A higher Pitch, where noe opinion Was lost to my Endeavours; therefore, may This vindicate my Spleene. I doe not say I hate the world, or I contemne her praise, Because I wanted any: many waies I had beyond my Merit, and Suspect My owne, for her applause; to see how deckt In her Encomions ffollie doth appeare, And Ignorance, it Selfe, is famous here. This when I see, I must Confesse I rise With Indignation, and her vote despise; Torture my Selfe, a Poet, in the Name: And count my ornament my greife, my Shame. To looke vpon the Age, and see what things Come vailed, vnder the adulterate wings Of Poesie. Oh; I could splitt my Qvill, Forget my Manhood, if it were not Ill; To see that pure fflame fall, a prostitute; And Coiture of Ruffians, cause her ffruite; When to the Twang of meeter, Poesie Shall fall to Sordid Groomes; and Infamie Attends the Name; oh, let vs teare, the bright Lawrel of Phebus, in a iust-raisd Spight. Dull Age of Ignorance! and shall I steere My vessel to thy Compasse? noe; I here Loudlie profes it to the world, I Claime The honour of a Poet, and the Name, With all the Title Modestie can vrge. I am a Poet; and I bring as large A Stocke as may suffice to keep witt in Her native Colours. What I loose or win To bloat opinion, that below my fate I ever value: come it soone, or late. Vpon a late printed Booke Entituled: Pittie my Ignorance; I must confes I could not fathome it. Beyond my reach; and all I knew, was gvess. Why should I boast my witt, Against my knowledge? Trulie in the Scope I was to seeke; and could but blindly grope At the intent, By my owne Sence; vnapt to Apprehend Any true ffigure, by the worke you penn'd. Astonishment Supris?d my Iudgment, and I was afraid That either I was sottish, or you mad. Perplexed thus, 'till second Thoughts (which wee Often account the best) Came in vpon me; then I plainelye see Abundant Rapture, prest Vpon a great Designe; deepe Misterie Strangely involved; and a Fantasie, I know not how, Borne, in the Region, of a troubled Zeale; And all things Nothing: For ought I can tell, I doe not now Write, what I write; nor live, nor stand, nor breath, Nor See, nor Read, the Booke which you bequeath. This is my Sence; nor thinke I wronge The honour of your Booke; That I a weake pretender, and but yonge, Vnseasonéd, to looke, With a Discerning Eye, into the Darke Wombe of your ffancie, and apply your worke By my weake witt. Bee yet appeas'd, to satisfye your Feare; Stay, take the Secret with you, in your Eare— I know't not yet. And if you write a Second, youle engage Mee, and the world, to Cleare it in each page. A Strange Maye. The Earth, in her best verdure; and the Spring As glorious as antique Fame, did Sing Her constant Tempe; all the Meads were sett With bright Enamel; and the feilds were fitt Allmost, for the keene Sickle; which might seeme, Iustly, a wonder, if wee doe esteeme Our colder Latitude. For who shall Say (Without reproofe), the Harvest is in Maye? Now Maye it was. What vast Hyperbole Will serve but to speake truth? the blooming Tree Crack't with its weight of ffruite; and wee almost Might, by the Season, August have Suppos'd: All Eares were fill'd, and everie tongve could prate Of Prodigie; and gvesse, I know not what. Some wiser, left it in the Misterie, And from the Cause, look'd what th? effects might be. The avaritious Husband claw'd his Eare, And deem'd to have two Harvests in a Yeare. Thus stood the Earth, to Miracle almost; When, the more Miracle, a biteing frost, With a bleake northerne wind, orerun the feilde, And nipt the Swelling Graine, the fruits it kill'd; The painted Meadowes, chilléd in their pride, Grow wan; and flowers run backe agen, to hide Themselves, in warmer Crannies of the Earth. Never was such a Change, since the great Birth Which Chaos teem?d; and though it Ruine threat, Who knowes? but when the Sun, in better Heat, Shall mount his Throne in Cancer, with his rayes May quicken them, and give a new encrease; Soe satisfye our Hopes, that men may Say, The Sun, in Iune, Conquer'd the Storme in May. When the Cloud of Calamitie, had somewhile overspread vs, and the whole Kingdome plunged in warre 1.6.4.1. Noe more let's part, Deare Muses; high in Mirth, I left inviting Freinds, to give a Birth Of timelie fancie Light. How often did I frame excuses? how more often Chidde ffor my retirèd howers? You, my delight, My Life, my honour; you, who more invite My Soule, then all the world; whom I more prise Then all my fortune, or the triviall Tyes Of Nature, or blind Chance; for haveing You 'Tis Light, ioy, Health, to me; I never knew A Day too long to serve you, or a night Soe tedious or Dull, I wisht for Light. The howers are fleet, and Time, me thinkes, has wings, When my enfranchis?d Soule doth fixe on things Soe beyond groveling Nature, as you teach. Mortalitie has a short date to reach The perfect notion of Things, how they are Or how they ought; yet many things appeare Well-formed in your Glasse, which to the Eyes Of vulgar Sence, in vgly Chaos lyes. I doe not blush to serve you; but I boast (If I may Glorie ought) that being tost Vpon the Billow of a rageing time, I can repose my selfe; &amp; bring a Rhime ffrom an vntroubled thought; still soe secure Is Innocence. Oh! when within the Mure Of my lov?d Studie sett, bright rapture heaves My fancie from the Earth; my Sence then leaves Inferior obiects, and without dismay Dare looke in Danger's face; &amp; tread the way Of freedome, vnappall'd; my chosen Muse Leads me to Truth; but ah! it was but thus. Time is noe more; now stormie daies disperse Composed fancies, and distract all verse. Alas, our Muses frighted from their rest, Run giddilye about, with hairs vndrest; And mantles torne, throwne Careleslie, to hide Hardlie those parts of follie, men deride. What but vnpolite fformes, and ffancies raw, Can such a time produce? Yet let vs draw Something to tell Posteritie wee might Have done it better, in a clearer Light. Yet Silver-footed Peace may blesse our feilds; And (though the present season hardly yeilds One Sparke of such a Hope) I'me confident To see Astrea call?d from Banishment. Once ere I dye, Ile see Apollo Smile; And all the Muses frolicke in our Ile. Ile force from yonder Hill, a Helicon Purer then Greece or Rome have ever knowne; And Cope with the fam?d Poet of the South, Who from the Royall patronage tooke growth; Though now his ffeathers Summ?d, he shoot his Qvills When Hee, perhaps Maye wither. My Store fills From vnexhausted Arsenals. Not then To our late honored Laureat' shall my Pen Doe homage for a Line; but rise as high In a firme Rapture, and full Poesie. Then, my dear muses, wee may meet and Sing In Peace Secure, the fears, which wee now bring. After a storme, going a hawking. This was written before the foregoing Poeme though here placed after. Long bound in Ice and horrid Hills of Snow Such as the fur-clad Russians ever know; Wee are releiv?d now, by a gentle raine, And take the pleasures of the feild againe. The Restive Horse, now knowes the dexterous hand Of his old Rider; runs to his Command; The gentile Greyhound, (in his Ease growne high) Frisks with Delight, to see his lord applye The Collar to his Necke; and hopes againe To triumph, in the blood of poor Watt slaine; The generous ffalcon, (heavie, with her Ease) Plyes her firme ffeathers; and doth boldly seize The trembling Qvarrie; or Enue the ffowle Halfe dead with feare; others (more brave) controule The lofty Heron's flight; and venture all Their Life and Honour, with him in the ffall, Vndaunted; yet, with such a cautious flight They almost teach a Rationall to fight. For can wee thinke it lesse, to see her arm'd And haughtie foe fall dead? her selfe vnharm'd: A Glorious victor in his Blood, and, proud Of Conquest, scatters all his plumes abroade. Such ioyes the Season doth to Men present And (yet) a peace gives freedome, but content, In my retiréd Cell. I rather Chuse More solid recreations, with the Muse Which I have Chosen; and my thoughts revolve To everye Chord of Passion, and resolve Some time the Hardest, braver pleasure farre, To give bright reason wing, into the Spheare Of Truth, her Region; where the foole is Still In our protection; give her way to kill The Harpie She has ruff't; for I dare say She has earn'd her Bells, to bring downe such a prey. But wee are all ill Falconers, and Strive Against our pleasure. If wee keepe alive The Bird, wee are better pleas'd, and take her downe With a false Qvarrie; but the Lure is knowne, And she disdains to stoope; but (madded) tries Her wing at everye lesser Bird that flyes; Another such a Checke, and though you boast Your Care and Cunning; shee's for ever lost. Such Bunglers are wee all; and if wee can Abuse our selves, wee glorie in't. Oh, man, How art thou wise? In what can Iudgment claime Her right? or vertue, In what more then name? Hurried away, by vanitie and Sence; Proud, in all Sin of Disobedience; To everie Passion subiect; and more fraile Then rotten Sea-tost barkes, without a Saile. Oh God! what is thy Creature? he, who once (Equall almost, to Angels), did advance His glorious Crowne. Oh whither is he sunke: ffrom that perfection? as a Shadow Shrunke From his Creation. This were thought enough To busye all men, were wee wise to know Our owne Necessities; but this wee keepe Our burthen Still, and in these fetters sleepe; Which wee make light with Fancie; and esteeme Rather as bracelets, ev?en to glorye them. But wretched that wee are, insensible Of our owne ruine; though wee doe not feele The weight and mischeife; 'tis apparant in Our members, worne and fretted to the Skinne; And privilie the rust our marrow gnawes. Inevitable Ruine sadly drawes Vpon vs, careles of our overthrow; And often fall, before wee feele the blow. But ah, desist fond Qvill; the Inke thou hast spilt Runs to thy Shame, and argues thy owne gvilt. Freedome. I blesse my Starrs, I am vnfitt for noise; And busines allmost shuns me, to my Choice; I sitt retir'd, while other men are high In State-Employments; 'tis a peircing Eye Sees thorough Men, to dispositions; And sorts fitt Agents to Occasions. This with its Spectacles, Authoritie Can Cull 'em by the head; and why should I Repine? I glorie rather, and can Sitt, T' emprove by them, what may be Iust, or fitt. I'me happie, I'me exempt; that I may play With my owne thoughts, vnvext, my howers away. I am not in Commission of the Peace; Noe Constable, the greater, nor the lesse; I'de nothing Glorie, if I had ben made Poll' gatherer of the Groats; I should evade, Truly, to be a Parish warden; or A domineering Elder, with the power Our well-affected Parliament can give. Fitt Men shall have Emploiment fitt. I live Obscure; Blood, Tears, nor oppression Burden my Soule; my Gvilt is but my owne; Whilest higher Sin, attends the higher place; Sin of Participation in the Case. I'me as I am, Content; and free, to pittie The faction of the Countrie, Fraud o'the Cittie. Sometime I'le take my Stone-bow or my Gun, With my true Servant, readie still to run, And fetch the Qvarrie from the Brooke or Bush,— The Mallard, Teale, the Sparrow, or the Thrush. With these innocuous pleasures (I can rest In my selfe quiet; and display the brest Of all my Crime, vnto my selfe); Wee live Gviltye, I hope of lesser Sins. I strive Not now t' exaggerate others Crimes, nor here To make our owne lesse then in Truth they are; This, if the rigour of the times allow I am content; if they will not, I know A pleasure, 'bove their Malice; and the close Barrs of a prison, cannot hinder those My owne free thoughts; where I some time may have A visit from the Muses, which shall save My Name from Envie and oblivion. Soe being lest my selfe, I'me most my owne; And what, by them, was put, as a restraint, Is by my patience, turned t' a Complement. Vanitie. Soe Time but turnes his Glasse; and the same Sand Consummates his full Period; though wee Stand Fixéd on former Ages,—happier farre As wee suppose,—Alas, alas, they are But the same Miserie; they knew the greife As well as wee, which follows humane Life; Ambition, Envie, Iealousie, Distrust Was then, as well as now; and ever must (While Men have their Corruptions &amp; desires) Delude the world. Hee scornes what thou admires; What thou Contemn'st, he glories in; and all The Ioyes of men are follie. What wee call Felicitie, is but a Shadow, toste Vpon the Fancie, and in Fancie lost. Light as the breath wee trust to, is our Ioy; Our Pleasure, trouble: &amp; our Boast, a Toy; Wee only aime at Trifles, and present Thin formes to gvide vs, in the banishment Of a depravéd Nature; oh, the Sad Anxietie of Passion; I am made, Some time, a Thousand Men, in my owne Brest. Againe Contracted; and if one, the least And most imperfect Shred from Nature's loome. A despis'd Atome, in her rayes. To whom Shall I appeale for wisedome? and get light Of Iudgment, to informe my erring Sight? In the Darke Maze of Error, whether run My giddie feet? What never-resting Sun Can tracke the path of Mortalls? or disperse One Beame, beyond our follies and our fears. Good God! what is our Glorie? Wee surmise Only at truth! &amp; though wee are not wise, Wee are proud to boast our wants; and all our owne Is ever best. Oh God, wee are vndone In our owne proiect; and our glorie is A Lumpe of Pride, a Shop of vanities; Our learning (fairest Light) wee make a bait To ruine Sence: and reason captivate In gvives of Error. Into what immense Inextricable Laberinths wee drench Our vnderstandings! and the Charter, which Nature gave absolute and free, wee pitch Into a Model, with restriction, And Artfull rules, when Reason wanted none; For how is She Eclips'd! and Limited To the proportion of another Head! As though another Hercules had plac'd Witt's great Ne vltra, never to be pass'd. This is not the least Follie; through wee stray As farr from Truth, in the Contrarie way. Oh vanitie of Mortalls! to bequeath Your Labours to Posteritie, in Death. How doe wee Covet Glorie! and contrive Our Being to the Future! Shall I give My Name! and what I ever purchaséd With Industrie, to the vncertaine head Of a Supposéd Time? How madly spend Wee then our oyle! Is this our Ayme? our End? Ah, too too well, I see, in everie Line, Wee tread this Path; and this poor verse of mine Stands record to my Shame, that I intend Somewhat to raise by it, and to some End: Perhaps, to doe a greater worke then praise Can flatter Witt into; perhaps it Strayes With ffollie, more then I my selfe can feare; For tell me, who are Equall Iudges here? Alas, wee but deceive our Selves; what witt Will here resigne? what Follye will Submitt? Thus, discontented Fooles, wee spend the oyle Of a Sad Life; Incessantlie All Toyle. Proportion. Man, (Screen'd, by Flesh and Blood, and wrapt within Th' impenetrable Curtaine of his Skin), How shall wee pourtray out? what antique Qvill, Or famous Moderne, boasts of such a Skill? Not great Apelles, nor fam'd Titian Had anie Colour for the inward Man: Much Celebrated Angelo could give Life to his worke almost, in perspective; And our late honoured Vandike may raise Himselfe a Trophie, from another's Face; But this exceeds their Cunning; all wee know Of this, rests in our Selves, &amp; what wee owe Vnto Philosophie; whose gentle hand Can put aside the vaile; and then wee Stand Naked and plaine; As in the outward face, and all the parts Exterior. Each severall imparts A diverse ffeature; &amp; noe two can bee Soe like in Face, such Twinns in Symmetrie, But a discerning Eye may eas'ly find A difference. Soe is it in the Mind; Noe two, in the same Mold; and vnto Each, (As in the Bodie Naturall), his pitch Is limited, and not one Inch can adde In Stature, to the measure that he had; Nor Change his Face to a Complexion Fairer then that which Nature made his owne. Soe is the diverse Face of Reason; and The vnderstanding, cannot put a hand, Beyond that Reine. It now appeares, as plainly to my Eye, The Mind and Intellectuall Phisniomie, As the Corporeall Shape; and I perceive The same Discordances which wee conceive In all exterior formes; and Each man best Suits with his proper owne. Can I divest My Swartie Hewe? and put vpon my face A better Tincture? or new features place Where the old were imperfect? Neither may I put away my Reason, though it Stray And be a Monster to another's Eyes! Yet knitt soe Close vnto my ffaculties It cannot part; noe more, then heat from fire;— A Qvalitie Inherent and Entire: It is the Same, In vnderstanding, given severallie To the proportion; &amp; shall therefore I Despise my selfe? because my Stature is Perhaps an Inch or Cubit below his. Because he (with a longer Arme) can reach That thing, with Ease, which I with all my Stretch Cannot attaine. There is a height beyond His vtmost. Man, is all of Pigmey kind; And though our Giant vnderstandings reare Themselves on Tiptoes, to the wishéd Sphere, How are they lesse then Nothing? &amp; his leape Is but to fall againe; whilst others reape A larger Harvest, with a lesser Toyle. But noe man has the Stocke; noe Inke, nor oyle, Can bring a Name, Beyond his Circumscribéd Power. Wee All Have proper Motions; and they rise, to fall Vnpittied, who adventure on a path Of soe much ruine, as noe lesse then Death Attends each Step. Yet man, in Time, be wise; Bee thy owne Mirror; See Deformities As well as Beauties; and correct them there, With as much Diligence, and as great Care, As in a glass, thy face, should'st thou perceive A Spott, to lessen Beautie. 'Tis, beleive, More worth thy Care, to rectifye this part Then all thy Face; Bee happie, as thou art; That is, Bee pleaséd with thy owne; and See Some Creatures Creepe, as well as others Flee. The Userper. I saw the World, and wond'red at the Sight; (For I was rais?d above the common Light Into that Region, where wee eas'lye see All formes at once, mixéd or diverslie;) Hence I look'd downe, and saw the Creatures, All ffixt in theire Causes, and made Severall To their distinct and single Motion; Which wee distingvish strangely, to our owne Capacities; and Rationall prefer, Proper, alone to Man; the Beasts (more nere Then Plants, or Trees,) wee call but Sensitive; And those, by Vegetation, meerly live. Or wee are blinded, or wee quite mistake The Square, which wee our selves, our gvide would make: If it be rationall, to move, and live A part, t' assist the whole, and each part give His proper furtherance; and who most faile To advance it, are most irrationall. Man cannot boast of Reason, (nor dispose Defects or Eminencies, vnto those Inferior Creatures), Lordinge ore the rest, Forfeit to his prerogative: the least And most vnprofitable member in His Motion. Oh, how often have I bene Dash't to the pit of Shame? To thinke man, made His great Creator's Image, and array'd With Glorie next to Angells; and beyond All other Creatures, both in Face and mind, Had Reason then, or what wee would define By severall Notions, to that gen'rall Line; Made Lord of all the world, to vse, and know: A Thing soe sordid and ignoble now Wee cannot speake him, and the Creatures vye fforces and foyle him; they, imperfectlye Move to their End; Hee, from perfection, To this low step, is fall'n. Oh! haples Son Of humane frailtye, yet in Time recall Thy Birth-right, noble in th' originall; And tis not lost to thee; leave of to speake His Ruine; and his Reparation make. The Magazine. Rise with the morne, and gather vp the Deaw; Flye to the East, And rifle all the Sweets the Phenix drew Into her Nest; Plunder the west, Nature's Exchequer; Search the Subtle wombe Of waters for their Wealth, and bring 'em home. These, are not of Content but of Desire; Wee are our owne Treasure, and wonder, if wee but Admire What w?? have not knowne: These over-blowne Will wast to nothing; but the living Store Rests in our Selves, not seeking any more.

THE END OF THESE FIRST POEMS. Love Platonicke A Small Poeme; First Written 1642: by the same Author; Taken from the originall into this place copied; .1.6.4.6, Non est forma Satis, nec, quæ vult bella videri; Debet vulgari more placere Sibi; Dicta, Sales, lusus, sermonis gratia, risus, Vincunt Naturæ candidioris opus; Condit enim formam, quicquid consumitur artis, Et nisi velle subest, gratia tota perit. To Cinthia; coying it. Noe longer Cinthia! have I spent My time, but for a Complement? Have I read all The Solemne Dictates of a noble Love? Taught all the Misterie which doth behove A naturall Pure fflame to exercise? And you in Heresies Yet wander! noe more vexe Your Selfe, in the Stale Error of your Sex. Not any doctrine, in our Schoole, Tends to the ruine of a Soule. You may be bold To follow all our Precepts, and observe A Stricter Modestie then those who sterve Love, in the old Mantles of Mother witt; They doe not know the fitt Freedome of Nature, in That Passion of the Soule, without a Sin. Come, let me gather a new Flame From thy bright Eyes; the old is lame; And I forget The better Principles, while I dispute You into Faith. Come, 'tis a modest Suite, And might be writt, A vestall Canon. Fye, 'Tis meere Simplicitie To hinder your owne blisse! Would you Assent, there were noe ioy to this. The bruitish Passions of Lust, Wee doe not know; nor the vniust Power of the will. Our blood is Calme and Cold; and all the root Of Nature is Corrected; here, noe doubt Can move that Ill, Your Ignorance suggests: Wee have more open brests, And thinke but what we say; And doe the Same, in the same free cleare way. May I not yet enioy the free Possession of my Selfe, in Thee? Let Men Suspect By their owne gvilt, our Sin; it shall not move Our Innocence. Daigne yet an Equall Love; Prize noe respect, To that Beautitude, Wise Mortalls have pursu'd, With Free and Chast desires; Warm?d with the best (now call?d) Platonicke fires. To Cinthia Converted. Come my Cinthia, gladly fixe Thy bright and Chaster Eyes on mine; Yet be free, and let vs mixe, In noe base Corporeal twine; But in the freedome of our Soules embrace, Knitt by the mutuall Glance of Either's Face. Happie are the Minutes, which Wee Spend and keepe in this enioying; Tainted with noe Sordid Itch Of sensuall Pleasures, ever Cloying; Wee freely move within our Selves; and Eyther Moves in the other, one and both together. My better selfe, in all the tye Of Chast Affection, thinke I prise Noe Ioy to this Societie: Not all the Treasure of thy Eyes Was such a forcive Character, to bind My Love, as this great Sympathie of Mind. Nor let the vulgar blame vs in Their owne surmises, fond and weake; Wee are not gviltye of that Sin, Which they are bold to doe and Speake; Let them Enioy their Active heat, whilest wee With Soules Combinéd, in our Selves are ffree. Deare Cinthia, breath thy Innocence Into the Closet of my heart; Whilst in a mixt Intelligence Wee Ioyne the Soule in every part; Soe generate new Loves; and keepe entire The ffaculties, vnstainéd with Desire. Cinthia confirmed. Can it be love, which the rude Action Of Nature may Compleat? Or can the Sences' Satisfaction Proceed from noble heat? Can Love at once Create and Ruine? or an Ayme intend To an ignoble End? And yet advance A Face of vertue? Love can never bend Two wayes at once. To the Platonicke pretender. Dull ffoole, to mock a flame Beyond thy Fate; Thou canst but prate Of Common Love, veil'd in another Name. The word Platonicke pleases thy Conceit; And some new thing Thou would'st have others vnderstand in it; But canst not bring One Accent, to evince It, from the Common Sins Of Appetite and Naturall Desire. The word is all thy Flame! Dull Sinner! doe not blame These Iust reproaches, if a Zealous fire Let the world see, A strange Hypocrisie. For in Platonicke Love thou canst doe more With yeilding Females, then in Lust before. Ladies beware, he will deceive you, in That Face of vertue, to the Act of Sin. Pure Platonicke. Not Roses, ioyn'd with Lillies, make Her ffaire; nor though her Eyes be blacke And glorious, as th' Etheriall Qveene, Are they my wonder; I have seene Beautie, and scorn'd it, at fowerteene. Not to have a Skin as smooth As Christall; nor a Lip, nor mouth, Bright Cytherea's ornament; Move me at all. Let them invent A Dresse, to move new blandishment; I am not taken. Not the Faire Enchantments of well-order'd haire; Not a Leg, nor Foot, nor hand; Nor the parts wee vnderstand Most attractive, mee command. Though I give all Beautie prise To the value of my Eyes; Yet I doe not love a Face, Nor dote vpon the outward grace; These respects can have noe place. Wee distingvish nothing to The outward fforme, as Lovers doe; Nor value by the rule of Sence; Wee know noe Sexe's difference, Equall in Pre'eminence. To the Sympathising mind, Neither hinder, neither bind; But in either's brest wee move, And Affections Equall prove: This is pure Platonicke Love. Court-Platonicke. Oh, be free, as Equall ayre; Though not soe gen'rall (my Faire;) Beautie doth attract the Eye, In rayes of the best Sympathye; Here I live Eternallye. The darkest Day were richly Spred In the full Treasure of your head; The Earth vnverdant may goe seeke Her Flowers in Winter; but your Cheeke Has all, and more then wee can Speake. Sabæan Gummes flye in your Breath, To recall Life, and ruine Death; See it in me; for I noe more Am living man, then in the power Of what your Kisses doe Secure. The Tirant layes his Scepter by, Commanded by your awfull Eye; And dares not Strike, if you but will To have me Live; Oh, yet awhile, Secure your Servant in your Smile. Something moves within my Brest; Something not to be exprest; Nature wills, when two agree, Some nearer ioyn?d Societye Then a discoursive Harmonye. Let vs perfect all our worke; Nature's fires should never lurke; And the Act alone can Seale Mutuall Ioyes; which to reveale Were Treason—and I will not tell. Anti-Platonicke. Noe longer torture Mee, in dreams Of reservations and Extreams; Nature, never yet, in Two Such a Calmenes did bestow, As you would pretend vnto. Give me buxome Youth, and Blood Qvickned in the vnderstood Caution of Love; a free desire To meet with mine, in Equall Fire, And doe the Act, wee both Conspire. In the free and Common way, I would all my heats allay; I have little Skill in love, Little leasure to Emprove; But by Nature's precepts move. In everie Step, I tread that path, And to new Dictates want a Faith; If I see her yonge and Faire, Fresh, and Blith, and fitt to payre; I have whol'some wishes nere. My blood burnes, I cannot hold; Strong desires make vs bold: I must vtter all I thinke, Not in a Qvestion, or a winke: Such mustie follies ever stinke. But I vrge and presse it close, All I know, or you suppose; Women are noe longer Chast Then vntempted; they would tast Men, with Equall Heat and Hast. To the Sweet feminine Platonicks. Ladies, (for only to the Feminine Wee breath these gentle Ayres;) it resteth in Your power to raise vs, (beyond all the right Wee claime, to Poet,) in this present Flight; For love Platonicke is a Dreame; (a Dull Imperfect glance of the most beautifull Obiect our nature claim's to;) wanting you Who make that vp an Act, was but a Show. THE END. Vervicensis: A Poeme; Written by the same Author: 1.6.3.9. Vixere Fortes ante Agamemnona Multi; sed omnes illachrimabiles Vrgentur, ignotique longa Nocte; carent quia vate sacro. Vervicensis. The Argument and Apologie to the Poeme. V: V: arwicke appears: a Sullen Ghost V: nto this Poet. Seemes to boast L: awles rebellion; and make good I: niustice. To be vnderstood M: ore clearlie, the first ground was laid I: n Confidence the Royall Head V: V: ould be remisse. Vnhappie Those V: V: ho worke theire Ends where they suppose L: enitie an Encouragement. I: n all this Scene, our Argument I: s not to move pretences, how D: esignes may be revivéd now. M.D.L.L.V.V.V.V.V.V.V.I.I.I.I. A fleeting Shadow, in the horrid Vale Of Erebus, comes to revisit Light, In hope of Comfort. I am set to waile In the darke Confines of Eternall Night; And, Mortall! know I must, if thou now faile, In Charitie, t' enlarge my haples Spright,— Wander vpon the grislye Stigian Shore, Vnheard, vnpittied; mourning Evermore. What have I done? ah, what have I misdone? Am I forgot on Earth? where once I stood, A Second Atlas, to support the Throne; And gvide the Kingdome, as my selfe thought good; Is that great Power forgotten? Will there none Revive my glories? Shall I sinke in mudde Of dismall Lethe? and my Glorie fall To Time a Spoile? as I had none at all. What boot's it then to be of Noble race? What to be Wise? What to be valiant? Or what to stand in Fortune's highest grace? Seeing, in Death they fall. I, who could vant Her favours with the best, must now give place. Vnhappie that I am, thus long to want My Convoy over the infernall Foorde; Where happie Soules get waftage, with a Worde. The Surlie Ferriman denies mee passe, And twitts my great Name with disgracefull words; Tells me (to vexe my Soule) how great I was. Once able to Engage ten thousand Swords, And Create victorie; rul'd by the glasse Of poasting Time, a Suppliant at his Foords; I only hang vpon the Lipps of Fame, Vnworthy of my once renownéd Name. Oh the Decree (I dare not say vniust) Of Fate! which gvides the vniverse, and gives To some Men greater Favours vpon trust. Am I the only Abiect? Shall my griefes Bee lost in Ayre? Must, must, ah never must I hope to be a partnerre in the lives Of happie Names? Shall my afflicted Soule Bee fixéd here, Eternally to houle? This only rests: a Poet must reherse Mee to the world, and offer vp my name In the bright Colours of immortall verse; A Sacrifize to a ne're-dying Fame: Here rest my hopes; for only these can peirce Rutheles Infernalls; these, can only tame Hell's Bandog, in his furie, and command Charon to waft mee to that happie Land. Could I obtaine this, I were happie Ever; Then might I freelie Solace in the feilds Of bright Securitie, where Death comes never; Where everie obiect all Contentment yeilds; Where God-like Heroes reioyce together; And All in vnion live; where Iustice weilds An vncontrolléd Scepter, and disposeth In Equall parts, that none can say, he looseth. Some gentle Muse, (in pittie of my Tears) Make it your Taske, my bright and active Storie; I Envie none you did or doe reherse, But I esteeme mine Equall to their glorie. Scarce anye, but they gaine the Life of verse, Vnask't, vnsought for; yet (alas) implore I, And find noe Ayde; I who could once have had Liveing, ten thousand Hands, now want one Dead. One hand to save me from the gapeing Iawes Of blacke oblivion; and my name preserve By force of Numbers, which revert the Lawes Of Destinie. Doth not my Name deserve A place of mention? Oh, what Envie drawes Or what Affection gvides you, that I sterve Neglected? Loe, they live, whose bones are rotten; Only Great Warwicke's Name you have forgotten. In the Domesticke Iarrs, the Civill broiles Of Faction, you may read of Warwicke's Name, In bloodie Letters written; where the Spoyles Of a Sad Kingdome fills the mouth of Fame With giddye Rumor; and the haples toyles Of Natives, stand distracted, as they came, How to resolve. In midst of these, descrye Great Warwicke's Name; which Warwicke once was I. I was a Yorkist, and I gave the fire To this great Clap; my Youth and Spirrit then Tooke an Occasion, that I might aspire Into the good Opinion of Men; 'Twas I that first gave hope to his desire, And made the Action live; rais'd him vp, when Hee would have Slept, and let his Title fall; I was his Strength, his hope, his All in All. The King neglects his Title; whilest wee wrought Vpon the Anvile of his patience; And Secret Plotts now into Action brought; But yet, to give our Treason some pretence Of Iustice, Yorke averrs he only sought Publicke redress against the vile offence Of Somerset and others; thus he Came An humble Suppliant, in the People's Name. For that he should (as manie would suggest) Ayme at the Scepter, or old Titles bringe, To gull the Multitude; his loyall brest Would rather breake, then harbour such a thing: Noe! thinke not, Harrie, (saies he) but I Reste With a pleas'd Soule, to looke vpon my Kinge. This gave it varnish to the world, and tooke The good King, who iudg'd onlie by the looke. Thus satisfied, Hee thinkes it is but iust His Cozen Yorke should orderlie proceede, When Somerset steps forth. Great Sir, and must Your Actions fall to Censure? let me bleed; I feare not death, to serve you; but I trust You cannot fall, to let a Rebell tread In your dishonour; let him know your power,— His pride,—to stand the King's Competitor. Not Sir, but I dare suffer in a Cause Where all my fault is but my Zeale to you; I gladly fall vnto your Equall Lawes, In verdict of my Peers; but you may know Another reach; see how his Title drawes. My Leige, 'tis too apparent; either goe And cut him Short, depising his faire offer, Or (my Soule's-torment) in dishonour suffer. Buckingham vrges it, in the same way; You are a King; or be soe, or be none. Meet him with all your power, and let a Day Stand Arbiter betwixt you, for the Throne; Give, give him Battle, all the Lords now Say. The King stands in Dilemma of his owne; Hee would, yet would not grant; he would refuse But not denie; till they inforce it thus. For Shame, S?, see the danger; what a Staine Vnto your Blood! what a nere-dying taint (Shall it to all Posteritie remaine In your remissnes,) to the Line of Gant! Wee loose our words, whilest they come on amaine: Meet the Stout Rebel, make proud Yorke recant His follie. Sir, you trifle. Thus the King, Will he, or nill he, they to battle bring. But it were tedious, if I should relate The Circumstance of everie Action. I only glance at these, and rather treat, In my owne Storie, what my selfe have done; How once I merited the name of great; What fame I got, what victories I won; How once I gave, and tooke, (not prettie things But) Crownes and Scepters; made and vnmade Kings. Wittnes St. Alban's, in the overthrowe Of Harrie's forces; wittnes, in the fall Of Mignion Somerset. Historians know If Warwicke be forgotten here: you all Have gull'd Posteritie; I gave the blow; And let me tell you, Yorke himselfe would call My Arme his victorie, and say I stoode A Bulwarke to the Title in his Bloode. The King retires, his Armie put to rout; And Yorke (pretending it to be in Zeale), Seekes an attonement, having found him out. Hee takes it kindlie, and accounts it well, To purchase Qviet, and secure his doubt; But Yorke had higher Aymes. The weake King fell Into a second Non-age. Yorke must sitt As Lord Protector; and Hee suffers it. But the Virago Qveen, (who could resent A lesse indignitie,) doth aggravate Th' aggreivéd Lords, and to their discontent Adds a disgrac'd King, a deforméd State. (Women are moveing orators,) she Spent Her words to purpose; and determins straight, By force, to right the greivance; and once more T' enthrone the King, Sole Monarch, as before. She cannot suffer what the Husband can; And my great Name was horror to her Soule; (But set beyond the measure of her Span;) She cannot suffer Warwicke. 'Twas a foule Dishonour to the Realme, to let a man, An Enemie, have govern'ment and rule. Shall Yorke sitt Regent? and proud Warwicke keepe The strength of Callice? meacocke King, you sleepe. She vrges him againe, and makes him take, Once more, the feild, against the power of Yorke. The Second Time they meet; now like to make A finall End of all, and seale the worke. Now Yorke and Lancaster are at the Stake! Oh, horrid fate! Can such a Treason lurke In Trollop's heart? Ah, he's revolted, lost In Coward Thoughts, whom once I trusted most. And thus wee lost the Day. The Iollye Qveene Thinkes the Storme past; and by a Parliament Repeals, restores, as best to her was seene; Confers place, Honour, office, Government, At her owne likeing; and with others, mine; Which Somerset must have, to that end sent. But Stay, yonge S?: carrie your Mrs: word, You cannot have it; ther's a stronger Sword. Againe the Fire breakes out, and in the Claime Of Yorke, I take the feilde, well furnishéd With able Souldiers; to whom dailie came Supplies from everie Qvarter; whether led By faction, or to gratulate my name, (Which glorious then to all the world was spread,) I know not; but I then stood in the feild 'Bove twice twelve thousand, that did weapons weild. The Qveene against me came, with all her Power; (For the good King had almost lost his Name;) The Armies meet, (in an vnluckie hower) Nere to Northampton. Now the Blab of ffame Magnifies Warwicke; and that Action sure Had bene Enough to give all valour fflame. Hearke, musicke to my Soule, the Soldiers crye Warwicke for Yorke, Warwicke and victorye. The Qveene flyes North-ward; Yorke, in Parliament, Vrges his right in blood; againe is made Protector of the Kinge; and by consent Proclaim'd heir to the Crowne. The Qveen gets ayde Once more, to trye the Hazard of Event. Yorke gives her battell, to his Losse; way-layd And misinforméd of their Strength, he tryes The chance of Battle; Crown's the worke, and Dyes. Dyed, and with him my noble Father fell. Ah, then where was I? where was Warwicke then, When Reiner's Daughter triumph't? Oh the Hell Of Destinie! Shall I be absent, when I were most vsefull? Shall proud Marg'ret tell Her Boasts in Salisburie? that Man of Men. Noe, know proud Qveene, these stand to doe the worke: Warwicke, and March, for Salisburie and Yorke. March tryes his Freinds, and in his Father's right, Vrges his owne; Ormund, and Wiltshire ioyne With Penbroke, to surprise him, if they might; Or vanquish his small forces. In a plaine They meet yonge Edward, resolute to fight; (Brave Spirrit! who soe yonge begins to shine;) Hee stands a victor; and the Earles (who might In Power have grasp't him) make a shamefull flight. This fired my Rage; let it enflame thy verse, T' empassionate for me. Shall Yorke's cold vrne In a warme Ocean of Scarlet Tears Be drench't, by pious March, and I but mourne My equall Losse with Sighs, or woman's Tears? I blush to thinke it: noe, let Warwicke burne In a brave heat, and to my father's Name Thunder Revenge on that imperious Dame. Be I vnworthy of my Name or Birth? Vnworthy an Opinion with Men? Bee I by Heaven accurst, disgrac'd on Earth? All Miserie befall me, (that the Pen Of Skillfull Wizards blot vpon the Hearth Of Destinie,) if this blood-gviltie Qveene Survive, in Peace; and in the fatall Storie Of Salisburie, erect her Envie's glorie. And let the readie Ministers of fate Record my vow, for ever permanent, Vpon a brazen Pillar. You who waite In the high Court of Truth, and doe frequent The vncorrupted Barre, at Iudgment's Seat; You, whom I most admire; you innocent Spirrits of Ioy and Light, be instant now, And Chardge me gviltie, if I breake my vow. The furious Qveen shall know he had a Son; She knowes that else, but She shall know the price Of a rash Murder; and not she alone. May Heaven forget me, if my ffather Dyes Vnsatisfyed in blood; the Royall Throne Shall not exempted be; when my Lord cryes In Dust, Revenge! Warwicke, revenge my blood! I'de to his Deare Name sacrifize her Broode. But know, proud woman, Warwicke cannot pay His Debt, with threats, nor chatter out in words His Anger; you shall know, another Day, What he allowes for Current; when bright Swords Shall Advocate; when barbéd arrowes play, Vpon the Helmes of your Lancastrian Lords. Brave Rhetorique! when bloodie Clifford shall Appease poore Rutland's Ghost, in his owne fall. But these were dreams of Passion. In this heat I brought fresh forces, to affront the Qveene, Strong in her Northerne Ayde; and now wee Mett; With equall resolution, both are seene. Till by a freind's foule Treason, all our great Designes were frustrate. How oft have I bene Betraied by freinds? 'tis Treason must doe that Which fforce or ffortune could not; hardly Fate. We are betraied; and Warwicke who would stand The Mouth of Thunder, in his Honour's right, Must flye for Safetie. All our men disband, To secure Life, by a disgracefull flight. Th' vnluckie King, brought thither by our hand, Is left without retinue, to the Night. Ah, my false Dreams! Shall Marg'ret once againe Triumph in Yorke, and my great father Slaine? Ah noe! they will have Iustice; can she stand, And their Iust blood, soe heavie on her head? Her Glorie, my Confusion; Warwick's hand Is seiz?d with palsey; vseles, he'es a foole A Coward ffoole, to suffer her command. Were he not Lead, or Ice, as Coldly dull; Hee would breake out in ffurie, make Yorke shine, And quite extingvish the Lancastrian Line. It cannot stand with Honour, nor my Name, To suffer it; Great Warwicke, once admir'd, Valour's heroicke Genius; the true fflame Of Action; with Scandall, is retir?d Into the Ebbe of a disgracefull ffame. Death to my Soule! breake Spirrit; I am fir'd Beyond another Treason. March shall rise King of this England, or else Warwicke dyes. Thus Iniuries adde to the fire of Rage, And Rage vsurps the Seat of Reason now; Th' enflam'd Sence is readie to engage A man for all things, to his over throw. Blame not my Passion, if I too much wage The fruitles warre of words; for you all know “Iniuries press the Thoughts; prest Thoughts will Speake: “Hee wants noe remedie, that none will Seeke. And though, perhaps, this vanitie of words Appeare in me too weake and feminine; Heare me thus much. When miserie affords Noe other way, how glad are wee to speake! And when our pungent greifes, (more sharpe than Swords Of Enemies,) doe violentlie breake Vpon vs; who wants Langvage to discusse His owne to what he would? as thus, or thus. Soe did I mine; and all that I could Say Was little to the Cause; for some time prest With Thought of Treason, now another way; ffresh pregnant Hopes surprise my willing brest. But then, againe, my Rage doth soone allay These Dreams. My murd'red ffather, and the rest, Crye Blood and vengeance. These would seem to rend A Rocke of ffortitude; when my best freind, The brave victorious March, (who strucke me mute With Shame, to thinke of my lost Enterprise,) Breakes in vpon me, with a kind Salute; My Noble Cozen, Action seldome dyes, In Plots of Treason, though they hang in doubt; Wee have not lost our Spirrits; Warwicke, rise; Rise my Life's freind; let Lovelace dye, thy Scorne; Baselye forgotten, as he was forsworne; Contemne his ffollie, and pursue the Claime, (An obligation to Posteritie;) The dull King sleeps, and is it not a Shame, Wee should be slav?d by Pride and Beggerie? She, who brought nothing with her but her Name, And Bug-beare Titles of high Ancestrie. The Kingdome suffers, and the Scepter stands, A distaffe, in a froward woman's hands. Succeed our Hopes, for doth not Edward's dust, (Our mightye Grandfire Edward, Hee who once Made Valois tremble,) rise and crye vniust Vpon our Heads? and that brave Scourge of ffrance, (Whose Name was Terror, and whose ffame may boast All the true Glories which can Man advance,) Doe they not breake their Marble, in a grone? That such a Nephew should posses the Throne. Was not my Grandsire, Lionel of Clare, Before the hope of Lancaster? and thus His Daughter married was to Mortimer. Mortimer's Heir doth now survive in vs; And I, from him am March, noe more then Heire To England's Crowne! of Blood ambitious; Thus, I vnseele a Subiect's Eyes, to looke Vpon a Throne, vsurp't by Bolinbrooke. Only, my faithfull Cozen, let me have That Arme, to gvarde it, which begun the Claime; Let the trivmphant Beare and Ragged Staffe, A Trophie Stand, t' enrich the breath of ffame, In Edward's Title; and I shall be safe, Maugre the malice of that haughtie Dame. And let it be my Ioy, when Starrs attend Our better ffortunes, to call Warwicke freind. Suffice it, Cozen, rather now to bring Our Strength to vindicate our right in Blood; And to the Dust of Yorke, enthrone a King. May his pleas'd spirrit triumph in our good: Loe, where the Cittie comes! oh, happie thing, If by a gen'rall voice, yonge Edward could The Royall Throne ascend; without the gvilt Of soe much Christian Blood, as may be spilt. Thus hopefull March: when with a louder voice, I greet the people. You, in whom wee trust; Brave Citizens, in whom our Action ioyes; How stand your Thoughts? Loe, Edward to the iust Scale of your vertues, lets it fall to Choice. His right in Blood; you know the Title. Must The old King raigne? or will you now proclaime Your wishes to the hope of Edward's name? If you Delight in fetters, and approve A woman's Rule! If Pride and insolence Endeare your thoughts! If you can basely love Your Servitude! you need noe other Prince. But ffreinds, wee know you groane; and to remove Your Burthen, Edward labours. Innocence Attends on Truth, and Iustice would restore You to the freedome you have knowne before. When ‘Edward, Edward! all the people Crye; Long live King Edward!’ oh the sickly tast Of giddie-headed Popularitie! Shall they not, one day, crie him downe as fast? Can Yorke's proud Son only on them relye, And be secure? Oh transitorie blast! I can see humane Errors now, and trace The steps of ffollie into everie place. Thus was he King; and thus I made him King; Nor would Hee blush to Say, it was my hand That seated him. For the light hummering Of People, did but as the Colour stand To the Designe, and carried vp the Thing. I layed the ground, I entred, and I mann?d His Title with my Blood. It was not ffate But Warwick's Arme, enthron'd him in his State. ffor thus Hee said; If ever I survive A King in Storie, let them know, I am Supported by his Hand, who did it give, Sole vnder Heaven. I carrie but the Name; The glorious Title, I with ioy derive, As a light Sparke, from the resplendent flame Of Warwicke; let it stand thus in my Storie; Edward's the Crowne, but Warwicke's be the Glorie. However ffreinds, heare you what I confes: This Man, my ffather Yorke, would often Say, Gave Life to Action; Action, Successe; And would revenge his Cause another Day. ffixe on him, then, with me, in the Excesse Of Ioy and Gratitude. Oh never may My hopes succeed! May I accurséd stand When I forget to honour Warwick's hand. Mean-while the Qveen, not Idle in the North, Leavies a mightie Armie, to bring downe The great opinion of yong Edward's worth, And once againe restore her Husband's Crowne; Now let fame triumph, with her wings stretch't forth; Let now her trumpet publish the renowne Of Warwicke; I may speake it without boast I did Create the Day, which once was lost. The Day was Lost, the passage almost won; Our heartles Soldiers at the point of flight; When, (as the beames of the resplendent Sun Chaseth away the vglie ffoggs of Night, And glads the world,) I to the People run. Warwicke! I Crye; once more, doe Warwicke right! Hee falls not baselie, that with Warwicke dyes; Chardge brave Companions; be he curst that fflyes. Let, let, that fatall Day record my Name, In bright vermilion Letters; that Sad Day, Where thrice twelve Thousand fell; besides, of ffame, Northumberland, Lord Beaumont, Dacres, Gray; That Day, the saddest Day that ever came To Lancaster; and some are bold to say, That England ever Saw. Let that Day stand A Trophie, to enrich great Warwicke's hand. Victorious Edward, now the way made Cleare, In the late overthrow, was crownéd King; Which to secure, he seekes how to Endeare The people first; then as a Strength, to bring Alliance to adorne the Regall Chaire, And give a better Colour to the Thing. How great ones stand vnsure! how Crowns of State Obnoxious are to the rude whirle of ffate. But wee are Happie now; almost Secure; Our worke is done. Edward and Warwicke stand Above all ffate. We but deride her power, Ioyn'd in the Sacred and religious band Of our owne Thoughts. Hee was a King noe more Then Warwicke's freind, and Warwicke's mightie hand Was noe more vsefull, then to serve the ffame Of Edward's Glorie, in a Loyall Name. Wee liv?d but Each in Either, as the freind Of his own bosome; trusted with his Soule. I goe for ffrance, a Proxie, to commend Affection; and as I erst did rule In Campes, soe now in Courts; I got the End Of my owne wishes; though a Ladie's Scoule (I must confes,) more danted Warwicke's heart, Then the big face of Warre, or warlike Smart. And let me tell you, though I gave my Name A Sacrifize vnto the Coales of Warre, And rather sought the Merit then the ffame Of Souldier; though I be known afarre A Surly warriour; as who never came To the sweet Court of Ladies. Oh you are Abuséd in the Report! Slav?d by a fface I have bene oft; by Warre I never was. Thinke not I was a Novice; nor Suppose Mee ignorant or Rude in way of Court, Despising Love or Beautie: like to those Who put on Sullen lookes, and grumble short: Who Snuffe poore Women vp, with a hot Nose. Such was I never; for I must report My selfe a Courtier; Active, Qvicke, and Stronge, A gracefull Person, and a pleasing Tongve. This, Edward knew; this, knew the Court of ffrance; This, Ladie Bona knew; but what of this? Edward, at home, tooke by a fface, a Glance, fforgets himselfe, his Honour; Warwicke is Abus?d in his Court-Errand. He can Dance With bright-Ey?d Ladie Grey, and toy, and kisse. Sitt Warwicke, with the Shame; and ffrance, the Gall; He keepes his Mistres, and in her, keeps All. Iniurious Edward! to engage thy freind, And take another way. Can Warwicke brooke Such a Contempt? May all Disgrace attend My Memorie: may I be ever Spoke The Scorne of men, if here I make an End. I have a feeling Soule; and Eyes to looke Vpon the wrong. Am I disgrac'd, abus?d? Neglected, Scorn?d, Betraied where I was vs?d? Am I forgotten for a fface or looke? Neglected, for a woman's witching Eyes? Am I disgrac'd, in what I vndertooke? Lewes may thinke me base, if Edward prise My Name with Scorne. I now stand Thunder-strooke, To my Dishonour. What new thoughts could rise To please the King, that I should suffer in The Iawes of Scandall, to secure his Sin? Or say, proud Edward, though I were as tame As thou could'st fancie me; as coldly Dull As the slav?d Russian; 'tis not Warwicke's ffame That only suffers. France and Savoy, full Of Iust Displeasure, will pursue thy Name. Are Princes Stales? and Warwicke made the Gull? It fires my Soule with Rage; I was not borne Ignoblie to retire; or Live in Scorne. Dare Yorke's proud Son forget himselfe soe farre, To abuse my service? Was I sent to play With ffooles, or Children? I could ruin Dare ffor ever, to his follie. But I may Wrong my owne Honour, ere I be aware. Suffice it, he has Married Ladie Gray, Past all recure. Yet thus much let him thinke, Warwicke perhaps not Sleeps, when he may winke. Incenséd thus,—for haughtie Spirrits can Not brooke repulse;—with Clarence I conspire, To restore Harrie,—now a forlorne Man— And bring downe Edward. Hee from this takes fire And vrges it to me. Once backe againe, Wee Ioyne, and make a partie more Entire. Two vowes t' assure it; yet he breakes 'em both, The word of honour, and his Marriage oath. ffrom whisperings, wee breake to open words; (But words detract from Noble action;) And now wee come, prepar?d with thirsty Swords, To seeke an honorable Satisfaction. Nor were wee Despicable; many Lords And Men of Worth came to assist the ffaction, And adde to the Designe, which hopefull grew; As Lincolne, Wells, Dymocke, and Montague. One blow wee gave, and Pris'ner tooke the King; But he escapes, and moves vs to a Peace. Hardlie can painted Apples wise Men bring; Good words take women, and may Children please; But I too well knew words; Soe wolves, will Sing; I knew I went too farre againe to cease. “Revolts are never reconcil?d”; I knew Old policies too well, too well, to hazard new. And now the Spirrit of my iniur?d freind, Heroicke Wells, breakes out, against the Power Of Edward; too too weake to gaine the End Of Victorie; but his great fire no more Would suffer him to pause, or re-attend More pregnant hopes, or the King's gracious hower. Hee thinkes that Maiestie and ffortune Smile; Both, to a purpose, often to begvile. How farre doth Passion blind vs! How was Hee Hurried beyond his Reason! Oh, the Sad And bitter Thought of such an Iniurie! A ffather's Death makes my great ffreind halfe Mad. Brave Spirrit of Wells! Oh, might thy fortune be As glorious as thy Cause! Can Iustice adde Nothing to vertue? Number will prevaile, And turne the pin of bright Astrea?s Skale. Ah, pitty that it should! Soe fell my freind, Carried by ffurie to a brave revenge; Regardles of his Strength, but of the End. Shall, shall, saies he, the faithles King infringe His Roiall ffaith? the promise he did send To my dear ffather? Oh revenge, revenge! I run, to sacrifize my Pietie To the King's murder, Rage, and Tirranie. Nor can I suffer, in a Cause soe good. Religion bids me goe. All good Men Crie Revenge! revenge thy noble ffather's blood. And shall I trifle? Let me rather Dye A thousand Times. What poore and abiect moode Hath thus long seiz?d me, that I doe not flye Vpon the Tirant, and pursue the wrong As ffemale Lions, who have lost their yonge? Enragéd thus, he fell; thus our Designe Suffred extreamlie. Wee to ffrance retire; And in a firme Confederacie, ioyne With the late Qveen, who burnt with inward ffire. Nor does shee now at Edward's Name repine, But to th? occasion subiects her Desire. With her, the Prince, Oxford, and Pembroke Sweare To ioyne with Harrie, for the Regall Chaire. Our hopes Succeed; wee enter once againe, And put King Edward to a hastie flight; Hee leaves the Land, with a Distracted traine. Wee labour here at home in Harrie's right, And give him freedome; but hee (holye Man) Neglects his fortune; of a modest spright: A Soule beneath a King, and rather fitt In a cold Eremit, or vow?d Anchorit. For ev?n that Day the People had run backe, To Edward's part, if I, for the weake King, Had not stood vp; and Cryed, with Ioy awake, Dear Countrimen; and to your Soveraigne bring Your vowes of faith! And knowing it would take Better, I tell 'em, Warwicke did the Thing. Warwicke is Harrie's ffreind, to live or Dye; When ‘Warwicke, Warwicke,’ all the People Crye. Warwicke and Harrie! Long live Harrie King! The giddie people Crye. He takes their voice As neither glad nor greivéd at the Thing; Yet rather by Co-action then Choice. How humane Natures scarce show whence they spring! Son of brave ffather! who admir'd the noise Of Action! great Soule! who tooke the Crowne Of Haughtie ffrance, and left it to thy Sonne. Great Soule, whom I admire, whose active glorie Shall shine in Truth's bright Annals, and Survive To all Posteritie, in happie Storie; When Brasse and Marble faile, when Mortalls give Vp interest of all their Transitorie; Then shall thy vertues shine, thy Actions live, And Time shall bring a Poet to reherse Thy liveing Glories, in a deathles verse. Loe, I have done the worke; Loe, where I stand, A King, or more. Harrie but wears the name, The Honour mine; the fface Hee, I the Hand; Now Warwicke stands, the ornament of ffame. Brave Soveraigntie! not vassalls to command, And tirranise with Slaves; but to vnframe The Seat of Kings, and have bright Scepters fall Before my feet; to make and vnmake All. Did Edward thinke I slept? Has he forgott, Ingratefull Boy, this hand? Could he surmise Warwicke should feele the ffire and not be hot? Was my Complexion made for Iniuries? Where, where has Edward soe much cunning got To see my Phlegme, or Atra bilis rise? You are mistaken, Prince, and ere this, know You were mistaken, to vse Warwicke soe. 'Tis not your fflemings that can now restore You to your Kingdome; nor your Brother's witt Betray vs, with faire promise, to your Power; Glocester! who like a brooding witch, doth Sitt On plotts of Mischeife! you pretend noe more Then right of birth, the Dukedome; and 'tis fitt, A modest Claime; but Warwicke can noe more Bee fool?d with words, nor trust you, though you swore. I come to crosse your hopes, and give an End To your Ambition; set a period ffor ever to the worke. Oh, pardon, ffreind; Pardon, great Soule of York! with whom I stood; Pardon, my father's Ghost! if I offend; 'Tis not for Marg'ret, nor her Sickly brood, I leave the Partye, but 'gainst Edward's faith I ioyne with Her, to satisfye my wrath. fforgive me, Equall Heavens! if I preserve My honour, dearer then a thousand Lives, To my Life's hazard. Let the Scithian sterve In chains of Ice, and voluntarie Gviues Adorne the Muscovite; I would deserve A noble ffreedome; and though Edward Strives T' eclipse my name, with infamous disgrace, Know, Edward's ffollie made me what I was. But I am growne Discoursive. Rather now Hear how I fell; (but thus I fell before,) Treason must worke, (what hardlie fate could doe,) Great Warwicke's ruine. Hee, who latelie Swore Noe fate should ever seperate vs two, Revolted is, with Shame. Oh Clarence! more Accurst in this, then thy owne Thoughts can bring Of Hell; who broke with God, to serve a Kinge. But not your Cittye freinds, in whom you trust, Nor the bright London Dames, your better ffreinds; Shall serve to voice you King; nor the vniust Revolt of Clarence. While yet Warwicke stands, Warwicke opposeth it; and, S?, you must Grapple with sturdie Limnes and Sinnewie hands. Noe silke-wrapt wantons here; but Soldiers' steele Shall graspe Luxurious Edward, till Hee feele. This Day must stand an Arbiter to both; (Pardon if I offend,) this blesséd Day, In memorie whereof I would be loath My Sacrifize, in humane blood to pay; It better fitts with holie Christian oath The vowes of Peace and Innocence, to lay Vpon the sacred Stone; and solemnize This Day to Rest, when God and Man did rise. When the World's Saviour, God and Man, did rise From the darke Confines of vnsounded Deepe, A Miracle of Ioy to humane Eyes; Shall I profane the memorie? Oh, weepe, Weepe, stonie Eyes, and let my Soule in Cryes Of true Contrition, this good Easter keepe. Oh let Religion keepe my Courage in! Ill thrives the Action that was lay'd in Sin. ffor though I prise a Iust acquiréd Glorie Before the best of Life; yet I am taught There is a Life, beyond this transitorie, To which Life, Honour, Name, should stand as nought. That I expect; that happines adore I, Eternall Ioyes, which ravish mortall thought. There wee must give account; all Actions there, Iudg?d, and rewarded shall be, as they were. Oh, then I tremble! and this Heart, which never Could stoope to feare, is frozen in my brest; Then I collect my Soule, then I endeavour To put of Man, and ffrailtie to divest. My honour, Blood, and Name I quitt, for ever; I am a Christian; and be that the best Of all my glories; and to that dear Name This Day, I would not fight, my Glorie's Shame. But pardon, Edward comes with the big fface Of warre against me; I must take the feild: Necessitie compells. Thou fatall place, Vnluckie Barnet; boast not if I yeild To supreme ffate; I fall not with disgrace, But as I liv?d, with Honour; I was kill'd In a brave Service; and my Name, which stood The Boast of ffame, I varnish't with my Blood. Thus Warwicke fell, and that great Name, which once Was heard with Terror, they pronounce with Scorne; That Hand, which did support or ruine Thrones, Is vseles; and great Warwicke lyes forlorne, Mingled in Dust with base and abiect bones. Soe all men Dye, as had they not bene borne, Like summer flowers; and serve but as a prey To greedie Time, and merciles Decay. Let this Suffice my Hopes; I now may passe The horrid waves of Acheron, and give The world a Knowledge of what once I was; Soe may the Name of Warwicke ever live, In forcive Numbers. Let me to my place Of Peacefull Freedome, Thou who didst revive A wretched Soule, and re-erect my Name; Ioy, in thy Thoughts, I vanish as I came. The Ende. To the Memorie of the great Earle of Warwicke Richard Nevile: Repose, Heroicke Dust; thy better part Inherit Glorie. Thus my little Art Can give noe more; but when this verse of mine, (How long soever Muses grant it Shine And shadow out thy Storie,) shall decay; Rise brighter to Posteritie! and may Diligent Poets of another Age New dress thy Glories in a high-borne Rage; Equall to antique Greece, or Rome's owne fire. Vnprofitable Muses can aspire In wishes onlie: but I doe thee wrong; Live, till men thinke true Glorie lives too long; Ev?n till thy owne Name can noe more be Sung. The End. Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori. “The Genius of this Great and glorious Ile.” A Poem, By the same Author: This was first Written 1637: the originall Coppie was lost; this is taken from an imperfect Transcript, by a freind preserved. ? et nunc, puerilia monstro Haud tamen erubui: ? Fallitur; egregio quisquis sub principe credit Servitium: numquam Libertas gratior extat Qvam sub Rege pro. ? Ex Cl: Claud: in laud. Stil: lib 3?: “The Genius of this Great and glorious Ile.” By the Sweet Streame, with pleasant Mirtles crown?d, Sweeter then those in the Idalian grove; And then these, Sweeter noe where can be found; Here Zephir's calmer breath doth ever move; Never did it rough Boreas' furie prove; Nor ever did the winter drissle here; The Earth still clad, the Trees were never bare. Perpetuall Spring; that it not differ could (Vnles excelling that which ffame doth Sing) ffrom the Sweet vale of Tempe, where of old, The Gods ffrequented; nor the ffaméd Spring Of Thessalie, where all the Muses sing; Could boast soe pure a Head, soe cleare a Streame: Equall in All, if 'twer adorn?d by them. Come then, Come hither, Muses; Come, you Gods; Blesse, and be happie, in this fragrant vale. If such Divinities may keepe aboads Vpon our Earth, then let me now prevaile. Come all you Graces, doe not feare to dwell With vs; here Paradice on Earth is now, But 't will be Heaven in All, when blest in you. The wood-nimphs here shall waite you; here the ffawnes And prick-ear'd Satires shall your Groves frequent: Sporting themselves over your fertile lawnds, The Naiades in Azure vestiment, With Hairs vnbound, the willing Sand shall print; ffaire-facéd Sirens shall the sences Charme To a Delight, and doe noe further harme. More to delight you: when you but looke vp Into the Grove, what diverse Carrolling Doth there entice you? Here vpon the Top Of a sharpe Hollie, Philomel doth Sing; Her, Cheif I name; but all the rest doe bring Their sev?rall Notes; the thrush and Linnot here, The ffinch, and owsle, caroll all the Yeare. But Stay, noe further my vnsteddie verse. Let better Pens give the Expression trulie; Lest I detract more, I noe more reherse Such Beauties; I, too bold and too vnrulie, Doe too much take from, and doe too much sullie. This in my praise; Silence, my Muse, and rest Thee, on the banke with flowerie Mirtles drest. Solace thy Selfe to see blue Tritons friske, And how they Skulke, the weake inferiour frye; Whilst Neptune, to court Amphitrite doth briske, And heav?s his Trident. How obsequiouslie The waters calme! how readilie they hye In! when the Ruler of the Seas doth play; The fishes Ioy, and Sport, and yet obay. But whither ramble I? doe I not see The Goddes on the Shore? expecting there Great Neptune, great Commander of the Sea; Her tardie Lover there; and, or I heare Shrill Tritons to give notice, and make cleare The path, or else my Sences doe mistake; See where they ride, how now the Billowes breake. But let me nearer goe, to discerne plaine If I have Err'd, or if yond same be shee; There better may I see the Entertaine. But I'me amaz?d! Certaine divinitie! Such glorious obiect never strucke my Eye; The Port of Iuno; but such feature tells, Thou art bright Citherea, and none else. Or I mistake; doth not the pluméd Caske Speake thee, the Issue of Iove's pregnant braine? I'certaine thou art Shee; profane to aske, Or doubt at all; pardon a fearfull Swaine. But Stay; the Qviver doth of right pertaine To the Chast Huntress: who did heretofore Chase in these woods the Stag, or feircer Bore. Art any these? I am astonied. She now approaches. Can my feeble Eyne Not sinke into my browes? or can my head Direct the organs in such glorious Shine? I am but weake; thou certaine art devine. Nor can wee have such nearnes. Oh! but See, She beckens hitherward, and calls on mee. I am a Stranger here, she Sayes; be not At all Dismaied; I noe Celestiall am; Nor am I Sea nor Wood-nimph. Doe not doubt What I shall say; my best part is my Name. In this forme I appeare; I rather came. Know then, I am, blest am I in't, the while, The Genius of this Great and glorious Ile. Nor wonder; I, who seldome ever saw The Sun, but shrouded lay in shades of Night, Frighted, beyond my selfe; ne're did I draw A breath of Comfort, 'till before that light Which in the North broke late, Aurora bright; For soe I count that Qveene, and soe I may, The faire forerunner of this happie Day. How long before did Mourning cover me? What have I knowne? And yet my selfe nere knew Till this faire Day; which I with Ioy may see; At first, the Romane Servitude I rue, Then the devided Governments,—which grew From proud Ambition,—what the Saxons did; Whose Spoile and Conquest in me yet are read. Still am I made the Feild of blood, the Stage Where Death was in cheife Action; the Danes Now entred, to subdue the Saxon's rage; Whilest of the Time many deepe wound remaines; 'Till now the Crowne and Realme this last obtains: And then the Norman Conquerour here lands, Who got the Government into his hands. See yet the Scarrs which in my Face appeare, And See the Miserie of those tragicke times; To tell particulars I stand not here. Fall then, my Muse, and may my weaker Rhimes Follow the path which onlie she assignes. But from the Norman Conquest to these Ages, How manie wounds! how manie bloodie Stages! Thou of the Nine the Saddest, helpe me Sing; Melpomene! leave the faire Sisterhood; Bring but thy Tears, and I will matter bring; Here, here run out for everie Teare a flood; And leave thy Inke behind, I'le give thee Blood, To write in Characters, what shall be read With Terror, to all Times, soe registred. Rufus and Beau-clarke, with those other Nine, I passe; nor doe I tell what I did beare Vnder those paire of Harries; thoug? their Times To me, were full of Danger, and of feare. Wittnes the wounds which in my face I beare; But these (too great) cannot be mentionéd, When as these after Iarres are told or read. Repeat thy Sorrow then: Sixt Harrie, now Crown?d King, a Child; enioy'd it, when a Man; A Man indeed; nor can I but allow, His vertues infinite; yet then grew on The Miseries of Mee, Poore Albion. 'Gainst him, his Cozen Yorke pretends a right; Hee, a mild King, more fitt for praier then fight. But dwell not here too long, tell onlie how Thou wert devided; how in doubt did stand Thy selfe, ev'n at thy selfe; nor didst thou know To which of them to yeild, or which withstand. Now doth the Red, then the White-Rose command; 'Till with the Deluge of the blood was shed, The Red Rose pal?d, the White was soil?d in red. Can I forget, (though a Cheif Actor in This vprore) Warwicke? not t' ascribe a praise Vnto his Actions, but for ever Sing His Courage and high Spirrit; Hee it was Did first pull downe, and then good Harrie raise Vp, to the Regall Throne; but whither? Stay! Particulars wee take not in our way. To name the Severall Battles and the Feilds, I not intend; for rather let me say, I was all Death and Blood. Noe place but yeilds Sad witnes of this long-continued fray. Brother the brother, Son the Sire did slay; Rivers of mingled blood run downe, and where The Spring should boast her green, doth red appeare. Oh, what a Sorrow 'twas, to be devided Thus in my Selfe! one limme against another; (For soe it was) without all order gvided; Make warre; whilst I, in this smoaking pother, Had sole the want; they fell but Each with other, And everie Single; but I, wanting all My Limbes, the heavie Bodie needs must fall. Here now hant Kites, and Ravens fill the plaine; Whole Shoales of Carren Crowes, to Cloud the Skye, Paddle in the warme blood of people slaine; This on a Rib doth tier, that peck?s an Eye; And if I may give it more dreadfullie; The dogs of Villages those bodies eate, Who fed them once, and in their bloods grow fatt. Let it not fright thee: Wrath now glutts himselfe In blood, and boasts the onlie Victorie; Goblets of blood he Qvaffes; and everie Gulp'e Steam's in his cankred throte; whil'st gloriouslie Hee fills still fresh ones; 'till swolne vp soe high Hee could noe more, he bursts; whose fruitfull Sperm Springs in an instant; Cause of greater harme: Of greater Harme! if greater there could be. But what more could I suffer? Yet 'twas more, 'Cause a renewing of my Miserie; And fresh addition to my greif before. How did my Meadowes overflow with gore; The incestuous Earth was cloy'd; the insatiate, Chardg?d Beyond her Measure, wish'd her wombe enlarg'd. Here the red Sea was; if I soe may call, And if soe high, I may compare with them, The Egiptian Multitude who there did fall; Those, but in water; these in the hot Steime Of their owne bloods. Nor can poore infants seeme To hope a safetie; onlie borne to bee Equallie instruments of Miserie. How many Ages did continue thus, Muse, now relate; but better I may rue. I know the minutes, were they numerous Tenfold; for Sorrowes minutes Ages shew. But ah, how fast they flye when wee pursue Obiects which please! Enough to say they were Too much in that; the Time, to tell forbeare. Looke, looke vpon this Caske, and see old blowes; See the deepe Dints which warre in it hath made; Read in my quarter'd face, what speech not showes: What I can least expresse, thou here maiest read. Though time, in something hath recoveréd The gashes of that foule and fatall warre, Yet while time is, I cannot want the Scarre. O Dulce Bellum! but they doe not know The fears and Dangers which on it attend, Who vtter thus. I in my selfe can show A Contradiction: for my forward mind Bore me to Battle; butt too late I find My Error. Youthfull Thoughts and active Limbes May thinke warre sweet, but know not what she brings. See here the Ensignes of that bloodie Warre; See, see the white now bears Vermilion Dye. Muse, now declare the Discords which appeare Betwixt the Brothers; and the Subtletye Of Crook-back'd Richard; till the victorie Was gain'd by Richmond; who conioyn'd in one The bloodie Factions in the English Crowne. Here was a hope of Peace; and here I thought T' have seen noe more the Miseries of warre; But Fate is various; the Son haveing got The Diadem; what his wise Sire with Care Had Treasur?d vp, Eight Harrie doth not Spare; His Will, his Spirritt, 'bove Advice or Feare, Wasts all the Treasure in a forreigne warre. France feeles the force of Potent Harrie's arme, In vast Expences, both of warre and Peace. Hee gain'd a Glorie, but I reape the harme; And more and more, my miseries increase. Hee made me Naked as I ever was; And the late miseries I felt by warre; Worse by my Povertie renewéd are. The Spoyle of Holie Things, Monasticke wealth, Enrich his Coffers; Sacred Vtensils Are made a prey, in this prodigious Stealth, This Roiall-Sacriledge.— Altars are not Exempt, nor the Preist, whiles Hee at the Altar stands; what can suffice A profane Tirant in his avarice? The Glorie, which to other Nations, I Had long preserv?d, he ruin's, in his rage; And fatts himselfe with ranke impietie, Beyond Example; spares nor Sex, nor Age, Where but his Will, or wrath doth him engage. Shame! not alone to be, but to persist A Profane, Profuse, Proud Polygamist. Hee Dyes, and leaves my Crowne vnto his Son, A Child, who dyes ere he to Age attaine. Marie succeeds her Brother in the Throne; Next her—oh speak't with Ioy!—for then began My happines and peace, vnder the Raigne Of blest Eliza. Sacred be that Name, And deare for ever, to her Endles Fame. But, Muse, noe further; for these Times vnsuite, Hide thy darke browes, for ever, in the Shade Of Night; and let this Glorie strike thee mute. Come now, Calliope, thou fairest Maide, What I can Ioy, by thee let it be saide. Begin then (dearest Muse,) and let there bee Force in thy words, to Charme Posteritie. Tell boldlie what I say; and let the Times Take notice from thy writt, it was my voice. Applye thy sluggard Qvill, and in thy Rhimes Speake it, that I may see my selfe reioyce. Hast to thy Paper; dictate on the wise I shall declare; this Qveen's most glorious Raigne Great Iames his Peace, to our now Charlemaine. Elizabeth, (whose name is ever praise) Gave Life to me; and from my gloomie Cell, Call?d me to Glorie, in those Halcion Daies; For I, a meagre wight, long time did dwell, Disconsolate, soe as I dare not tell; I in my selfe did carrie my owne Hell, And greedie Vultur?s on my Liver dwell. A Cave there is, where never Eye durst peepe, Digg?d through the Stonie Entrails of a Rock; Seem?d Morpheus, or Pluto there might keepe: The walls are Sootie, and the Light is Smoake; Certaine, the very hell is not more blacke, Nor can it have more Horror; reaking Steames Of Sulphur vexe the Sence, but give noe flames. For Light would give a Comfort, though of Fire; They feeling more then paine of Fire, who dwell Haples, within this mansion; and t' enquire The number, vnto infinite would Swell. Here Scrauling wretches, too, too bad to tell, Endure a Torment; here blacke vipers feast And glut themselves, from still-reneweing brest. Here dwell the Furies; here the feigné Hags May well be said; noe voice but horror sounds Through the Darke vault; and yellings teare the Crags. Here to old Sores inflicted are new wounds; Enough, to say here Miserie abounds. Here did I stay a Time, too long to say, Buried in Shades of Night, past hope of Day. But I forget this now, viv?d by the Beams Of such a maiestie; and strive to tell Her Raigne and Glories. Come, you boasted Dames, Attend her State; for ever I could dwell Vpon her vertues. But She did excell. Bee that Enough; for not impaire I may, And to dilate at full, I cannot Stay. Yet let vs tell, (if words can reach the height Which I aspire) the inimitable Sway Of my aw?d Scepter; now all things delight And blesse the Shine of such a happie day. Nor Warre, nor bug-beare Rumor, did affray Mee in her Raigne, to speake of; for I here, Knowing soe great before, these lesse forbeare. The Invincible Armado, Spaine's Device, I hardlie name; that word of Eightie Eight, And Yeare, I passe; the North Rebellion dyes, And pettie Insurrections I not write. Gnatts may as well be spoke with Eagles' flight; These quick'ned with the Sun, grudge at his Shine, Soe they, in Her too happie, did repine. Now pleasant verdure cloaths my fertile Meads; And Sun-burnt Ceres crownes the Plowman's toyle; The birth which from Iove's pregnant thigh proceeds Boasts now his fulnes; all the Graces smile; Latona?'s Twins inhabit Earth the while; Apolloe brings the Muses from their Spring, And blest in Qviet, teach them better Sing. As erst, Admetus' herd he did Attend, Soe now he daigns to visit Earth againe; And from his radiant Summit doth discend To blesse the Peace. In like, the virgin traine, Fearles, pursue the Chase, o're Hill, and Plaine; Not dreading further harme, the rest come downe To blesse the Peace and Glorie of her crowne. The Swains may safelie pipe, and safelie Sing May now the Muses, in my vnknowne shades; They now inhabite Thames, and leave the Spring They wont to hallow; here my harmeles Lads Applye their Skill; whilst all the pleasant glades Frequented are; and all the Swans of Thame Resound full glories to Eliza?'s Name. Nor could imperiall Tiber ever boast A nobler Store, as when her Still-great Lord Snaffled the well-rid world. Had all ben lost Of Rome, or what the Witts of Greece afford; This Age had ben Enough, Enough t' have stor?d Time bankrupt; to Set up and raise a Pile, Bright as the brow of honour, to this Ile. My vnfrequented Groves, (where but of late, Foxes and Weasles haunted,) where the owle And yelling Screitch, (full of portent and Fate) Late kept; where wolves and hungrie dogs did houle; (Where Night, and dismall Horror erst did Scoule,) Are now the places of delight and Sport; Thither the Muses and the Lads resort. Foxes are banisht thence; nor harmfull beast, Nor Beast at all, our feilds doe now frequent, Vnless some nimble Squirrel; or the rest Of them doe vse, which wee call innocent; The fearfull Hare, Embleme of Discontent; The well-clad Cunnie, and the harmles Sheepe, Here graze; and in full flocks the Hills doe keepe. These on the Downs; birds cherup in the woods, And mingle Notes, all Ears of force t' entice: The Tritons Ioy and sport vpon my floods; All things now Ioy; and Each new Ioy devise, This happie time, with me to solemnize. Each did express their best; but mine the Summe Nigh over-prest my Spirits, and strucke me Dumb. For what I tell thee, thinke is but the least Of what I would; nor can I hope to tell Such Glories, as can never be exprest: 'Bove vtterance, fitts Admiration well; Which more I Strive, but yet I could not Dwell In Silence ever: noe, the world shall see, Although my weaknes, yet my Pietie. But now containe thy Passion, oh, my spright! Now gaze wee to the North, and Expect thence A glorious Sun; whose heat and spreading Light Qvickens my drooping Head; but oh, my Sence, Be not transported in the Confluence Of Ioyes; this Time be regist'red by Fame, Happie to me, and Sacred to his Name. Sing then, Caliope, (above the Skye) His name, Oh sing! here blessed vnion springs; Here comes (admire) the peacefull Maiestie, Ioyning, what govern?d was by severall Kings. Treat then of him, and passe by Lower things; Here Warre and foule Dissentions, were forgott, 'Twixt vs twin-Sisters, English and the Scott. Invested with the Royall Diadem, What Acclamations and what Shouts of Ioy Flye through the Ayre, with Glorie to his Name! How are they full? Yet (ah!) how niggardlye To his Desert, such wasting praises flye! What should be writ in Brasse, is lost in Ayre; But when that falls, the world shall find him there. To looke into my selfe, and see of old, The miserable State; my tears and blood, My dangers and my fears; I cannot chuse But blesse the Times, vnder a King, how good! Our Dayes are Crown?d with Peace; and Plentie's flood Runs high within me. Sacred ever be The Mem'rie of this King; thrice happie Hee. His happie Raigne, his long and happie Raigne, To give in the particulars, as now, Time not allowes: suffice it, he did gaine The Crowne in Peace, and wore it on his brow, Without or Shocke or Change; oh! blesséd thou, Great Iames, for ever! which, what fire nor Sword Could ever win, doest in thy raigne accord. The Muses all are dumbe; nor can they Sing, Soe farre by him excell'd in their owne Skill: But I mistake! see they Attend their King. What Palseye hand doth not employ his Qvill? Apollo thus vpon the Sacred Hill Inspires the Muses; 'Tis not everie Daye, Nor in an Age, that Phœbus daignes to Playe. My frozen witts, who late but felt the heat Of Phebus, where the Muses scarce were knowne, Enlivened by a Splendor far more great, Have vnus?d Raptures; nor was ever Showne Then now, a greater store; and Fame hath blowne Them 'bout the world, for ever to remaine The ornament of Peacefull Iames his Raigne. More then Augustus, Patron to a Muse, A Muse thy Selfe; or rather the Apollo, Whence springs all Science; whose prolificke deawes Doth the drye braines of other Poets Hallow; Thy selfe the gvide, who will not Ioy to follow? Let Poets tell of Phebus, but to thee Time shall record the fire of Poesie. What have I said? or nothing have I said? How doe my Ioyes distract my feeble Sence? Soe, to the Ocean pettie Runnels glide, And loose themselves. Recall thy footings thence, Wander not in Darke waies! For what pretence Have I in this? or what can excuse seeme? Not fitt to trifle in soe high a Theame. What Either askes an Age, in thee doth Shine; A King and Poet; here, the powerfull Gods Iove and Apollo, ioyntlie doe combine, And Strive a victorie; the doubtfull odds Resolve (my Muse): but 'tis above our road; Equallie give him thus; as Fame shall Sing A Peerles Poet and a Perfect King. A Peerles Poet and a Perfect King; Fat'ning my feilds, with Qviet of thy Raigne; How shall I pay my Zeale; how shall I sing My gratitude? that in the smallest, can Be seen thy Glories? Sacred Spirit! daigne T' accept these Accents, as the humble Test Of what I owe, but cannot be exprest. How shall I thinke the Word, which I must Say? Pronounce it not (my Muse,) ah, can he dye? With him, might I for ever fall away: Never can I hope such Felicitie. Must he needs Dye? Oh terrible Decree! Inexorable Fates! See, now hee falls, Whilst I attend, to rue the Funeralls. Rest, Happie Soule, in Peace, and now Enioye Thy better Crowne of Glorie, and amid Troupes of triumphing Angels, ever Ioy: Whilest treeble Wreaths of Glorie on thy Head, Give lasting Splendour; Soe thou art not Dead; But in a better State dost raigne and Live, Whose Life in me, a Life to me, did give. But Stay! my too much Passion; how farre Vnbounded, would'st thou ramble? See, oh see, How I have erred? Looke vp (to stay thy feare) Vpon the Beams of sacred maiestie; What! art strucke blind, my Sence? This, this is Hee (Sprung from that glorious Stemme) shall bee to mee Cheife ornament to all Posteritie. Straine here, Caliope, a louder Note Then has bene heard; bring all the Sacred Qvire Of Muses hither; and let everie throte Resound the praise of what I most admire: Here goe beyond your Selves; oh, Sing him higher, That all the Earth may stand amazed to heare it; Yet, (oh) how short will this fall to His Merit. And now the Glorie tell; for this I came From my Aboade; to give my Pietie, And pay due homage to his sacred Name; That Sacred Name, in which, Posteritie Shall read all vertues ioyn?d with Maiestie. More then I could expect what heaven could give; Blest in the Raigne of Charles, I ioy and Live. Doe I not now enioy the All I have From thee, and in thee? What in mee but Thine? 'Tis but a Due to owe't to him who gave; Which with a willingness I doe resigne; Nor breath's within mee hee that will repine: Can Murmure dwell within Mee? Noe, I fall Before thy feet, and tender here my All. Oh, can Hee tread vpon the Earth, that Man Who grudgeth at thy Pleasure? Might Hee be Vnworthy of this Ayre; ever remaine In some darke Desart; and noe Memorie Bee knowne of Him, but breathing Infamie; There let him be forgot. But why should I Make a Surmise of what can never bee? But (ah) too well I see, what I now feare; See, how the Male-contents doe Mutinie; A worthles Broode, they not my Children are; How they dislike the rule of Maiestie? And mutter Treason, and thinke villanie Against their Prince? Oh, be it vnto them Confusion, and Dye in their owne Shame. Degenerate Issue, borne to be my Shame; Why doe you murmure, 'gainst your Lawfull Prince? Why doe you seeke (Dishonour to your Name) My Ruine? you, who should be my Defence. Yet fall, and beg a Pardon for offence; Come to your Selves (your Mother calls) and be Subiects to Him, and Children vnto mee. Leig-men to him, and Children vnto Mee, Who am but His: be His, and you are mine; 'Tis not at all to Say, in Pietie Wee are bound, with the Common-wealth to ioyne; 'Tis a pretence, ridiculous and vaine. Can it implye a Common Safetie, where Power and Maiestie neglected are? I am that Common-wealth you seeme t' adore, 'Tis true I am your Mother, and from you May challenge your Endeavours; and the Power You all can vse, fall but in me as Due; But no Glorie can vnto me Accrue From Seperations; be asham?d to tell, What's 'gainst the King, is for the Common-weale. Noe! what you have is mine, 'tis true; but what I am, or can be, I must pay the King; Hee is my Gvide: Why should I derogate From my owne right? 'Tis noe Discoursive thing, High Maiestie; but vnder heaven doth bring An awe, and more; a distant Reverence, Beyond dispute claiming obedience. Fitts it with you? everie low, private Man, To looke into the Prince, and his Designes? Must Kings fall to Examination? I greive to thinke it; certaine you would Clime (Which you can nere) to heav?n; and the devine All-potent Godhead Qvestion. Sacred be, Vnder that Power, the Power of Maiestie. Can you with Common Thoughts, soe much as Touch The hemme of Maiestie? or would you Looke Vpon that Splendour with or frowne or grutch? Correct th? Impietie; Kings doe not brooke Such neernes; and to all Times they have bene spoke Sacred. Oh, Touch him not, nor looke vpon The Royall Throne, but with Devotion. Could I expresse my Zeale to maiestie, Or could I here the Power of Princes tell! But neither can I: Sacred Roialtie Can know noe Limits, neither can my Zeale. Hee is my King; I am his Common-weale, Subiects to him; whilest from his Princelie Brest Commands are knowne, obedience fitts me best. But take, in leiw, these Accents, whilst I here Give some advice to my Rebellious Sons And thy more glorie. Make their Shame appeare Who (with profane thoughts) dare aspire at Thrones. Come (though my Children) yet, you luckles ones; Heare mee (your Mother) who doe thus Convince Your haughtie Spirrits, too medling with your Prince. What have I said before, of former Ages? The miseries which then I sufferéd. Peace knew noe dwelling here: the manie Stages Which then I saw of blood are regist'red. See to those times; how full of feare and dread They livéd then; and see your now Estate: Then may your selves condemne your selves ingrate. But not soe farre I draw you; instant Times Are better Light. Let but awhile your Eye, Leave your owne homes, and looke on neighbour Climes. Looke now vpon my Sister Germanie; The Seat of Warre, the Scite of Miserie; See the rent Eagle, and looke backe againe, To your owne qviet home, and blesse the Raigne. See into France; See all the world in broyle; And then examine trulie how you are. Certaine, you cannot but with Feare recoyle At what you mutter'd; but how sweet is warre To giddie Faction! and all Change how deare! Leave such an obstinacie; and recollect Better, your selves, to see, what you neglect. See, here at home, the numerous Confluence (If not too much) of People; but to you What neede I speake, thus much? Doth not from hence The world take wonder? and admire, to veiwe What Happines, noe Nation ever knew? See, how they fixe; yet you, nor recke nor See, The Good y' enioy, vnder Such Maiestie. See there the Spoiles, the ruines read of warre; What Wasts appeare! See, Banners broad displaied; See slaughter?d Men; See townes in Smoke and ffire; Revenge and wrath, See there in Scarlet clad; See, the distracted Dwellers, how appaied; See, all the World, with noise and warre, how hott; Looke if not wilfull blind, and fixe on that. When you Enioy, at home, (or may at lest) Peace, Heaven's great Blessing, and what else content The World can give; with Plentie crown?d and blest; Safelie you live within me; and frequent, Without all Dread, what way your wills are bent. Turne in your Squinted Eyes, and Seriouslie Learne how to prize the blessing you enioye. Looke, looke on me, your Mother, and Behold My Beauties; Looke with an impartiall Eye; See now my Glories, see my Greifes of old; Compare, and see your Cleare Tranquillitie, Vnder the Rule of this great Maiestie. Happie 'bove Hope; for what of miserie You thinke, 'tis in your Selves; the State is free. And can you be too gratefull for this Peace, My blinded brood? For had you to your King A Tirant, (as you now have nothing lesse) What's yours? or you your Selves but vnder him? Bee wise in Time; lest, happilie, you bring Your owne feare's Truth, and your Endevours fall: A Presse, to grinde the Interests of All. But you who live blest vnder such a King, As Time could never glorie, and yet strive To Curbe his Easie claimes; what shall I bring To blush you into Shame? Doe not deceive Your selves, to fancie freedom. You may live To wonder at your Selves; for certainlie, Contingencies but make Necessitie. And this must be; I only can lament The Disobedience of my Rebell Sons; Never was yet soe blest a government To silence Envie; and the venom?d tongves Of Malice cannot want Detractions To blast on purest vertues; 'Tis the Fate Attending Government, and everie State. But Eagles doe not recke the Wren's weake flight, Nor doe they feare the hummering of Gnats; Soe these, vnworthy are to stand in sight, These abiect Spirrits, these Degenerates; With the high Name, which Iustly gvides my State. Long may he soe, to the full Admiration Of all the world, and good of his owne Nation. Let me not run too fast, and be ingrate, While I rebuke them; Come, Caliope, Take thy firme Qvill, and write. Never too late Can wee Endeavour this; though never be Expressive there. Yet to Posteritie, Tokens of Zeale may in these words appeare: Oh, be they forcive, as they Zealous are. Come Poets hither; you who best can sing, Why labour you Inventions? when you may Know all perfection, in your gracious King. Leave far-fet fiction, and in truth display A vertue, 'bove what Fancie e're could say. Goe here, beyond your selves; let Poesie here 'Bove Fiction, in a higher Truth appeare. You, who would Limne out vertues, and Expresse (With all your Art) Idea?s, which but give Weake Lights of Patterne; though you seeke to dress With height of Skill, your fancyes, you may strive In this, to render Iustice; and Derive (To give it Lustre) what in Art you may, Or gleane from what Antiquitie can say. Here, you would Fortitude, there, Prudence strive; In this, you would discover Clemencie; Soe of the rest; for Poets onlie give Crowne and perfection (where they best agree) To vertues; and but give 'em severallie, Single in the perfection: for wee read But one Pandora, full accomplishéd. Loe, how you trifle here, and give sometimes But weakly, what you would, with greater Ease (And greater Honour, to your happie Rhimes;) Read 'em all ioynéd in his Princelie Face; And what you see there, strive in all t' expresse; Soe may you Sing to After times, the Glorie Of all Perfection in his sacred Storie. You, who advance Deade Kings and Potentates; Who breath, in loftie Numbers, Death and Warre; Or you, who tell the Pompe of Antique States; Correct, and bring your verse, with ioy and feare; To vtter Truth of him; which shall appeare More worthy praise, vnto Succeeding Ages, Then your proud heights, or all your bloodie Pages. For here the Muses' ioy, the Hill of Peace, Is the Pernassus; and the faméd well Of Helicon, cheiflie in Safetie is. Soe best, the Muses may be said, to dwell In the Hesperides,—this happie Ile; Hence light a Flame, that all your Nephews may Admire the Glorie of this happie Daye. From him proceeds, what ever you can boast; Soe sing him ever; the Encouragement And onlie Life, to what had else bin lost; Pay then to him (your Hope, your ornament;) What you can give; and may you still frequent (While Time shall be) my feilds; that I may know The Peace for ever which I glorie now. Sing the French Lillies, in the English Crowne, To future Times: as faire, as I now see't: And now (the while) prostrate, vpon the ground, Your Skill, and humblie kisse her sacred Feet; The Royall Mother of the Hopes I greet; Fixe there, with admiration, and Survay Perfections more then you can ever Say. Here move the Graces, in their proper Spheres; High Iuno gives attendance on her State; See, Hebe smiles; Each Goddes now appears, Officious; Pallas and Dice, wait On her Designes; but this, may fall too late; She shall appeare best spoken in her Name; A name for ever Sacred vnto Fame. Here see, in All, my more then happines; For this, I came to visit Earth once more; To see my Beauties, and the Authors blesse, Of a more Glorie then I knew before. Heaven be Auspicious ever, I implore, To the high Maiesties; and from them Spring To lasting Ages, one Shall be my King. But let not this transport me; Minutes hast, And I must to my home; else I could dwell For ever here; but see, the Sun falls fast; Record thou to the world, what now I tell; Whilst I must leave thee, and goe to my Cell. There fixe vpon these Glories; and admire In Silence most, for words but more impaire. And Soe she vanisht, ere I well could know That She was gon; whither noe Eye could See; Peace still Attend her; and suffice it now, I have obey?d the Chardge impos?d on me. Here shade I then my Browes; and Solace thee, My Muse, in the fresh Grove; and Fame shall Sing In Louder straine, the Glories of my King. The End.

Some Poemes; Written vpon Severall occasions, By the Same Author. To the Tombe of Thomas Earl of Strafford. Reader, ere you pass this Herse, Looke vpon our Shame. Our wonder, Worthy all your Tears, Lyes with liveing honours, vnder This proud Marble; and my verse But anticipat's the Thunder Of a bolder Fame, which might Have overcome a feeble Spright. This, This was Hee, who knew aright To gvide the high Affaires of State; Whose prudent Counsells were y? Light Of Monarchy. Our Monarch's Fate Was twist in his. Clear Pens might write Wonders in Storie; but too Late: Qvills are prevented; and the Sword Writes Blood, for Inke; &amp; wound, for word. Vnhappie Age, Vnhappie Ile; Without a Genius, in his fall; Whose Third made onlie both yours smile, And was the liveing Fount of All: If Genij be be? (as wee revile Antiquity, if wee should call It into Doubt) the greatest Flame Expired in Him;—And to his Name Vnder Devotions, wee may pay Our best Performances, and place His, as the cheif State-Martir's Day, Of all our Rubricke. Hee who was The Arch-Collossus, (if I may Soe call him) suffers in disgrace, And falls to rubbish, by the rude Rage of a barbarous Multitude. Let the Westerne Iland tell To her Maister, if he did More then Iust, or less then well. Shee knew much; yet I dare bid Her, (leaving Malice &amp; that Hell, Vulgar Clamour) boldly read All his Storie, that She knew And fright Envie from her heiw. Make her blush; or would you hear It better? Aske the King awhile, Who made the haughtie Scotts to feare? Who Stood y? Spirit of his Ile? Whisper Strafford in his Eare; Vrge it boldly, and revile The Nation; for in him they lost All their honour, all their boast. Much could I more: enough to bring An invndation of Tears. Stay Readers, I am full; goe wring Your hands vpon Another herse; His noble Ashes need noe thing But his owne blood; enough to peirce The Clouds, drawne vp by Iustice Sun, A Minant Exhalation. And it will fall, vpon all those Who lick'd it warme w?? greedie gust; Like Sulphur Shewers; their overthrowes Shall be more terrible. How Iust Is heaven at length! Strafford repose, Happie in thy dire Fate; which must Stand, to Ennoble all thy Storie; Thy Nation's Greife; thy Nation's Glorie. An Elegie To the Memorie of the trulie Noble and my worthie Freind, S? William Alforde K??: of Meaux in Holdernesse. I am noe Common Mourner, neither Croud To Funeralls, and vent my Tears abroad, In Elegies; or put my Witt in Print: A better Poet then a Penitent, I have noe Ends in verse; but keep the path Of plaine Simplicitie. It is noe Death Of Great Ones gives my Numbers ever Life; But I am iust to vertue, and would Strive To honour worthines, in everie Line; And make my Poesie in these Colours shine. Which to Adorne, and Crowne with better Fame, I now am brought to Celebrate the Name Of Alforde; whose iust Merits, were they writt By a cleare Pen, might challenge right to Sitt Enthron?d in Honour's Theatre; to bring His Praise in Catalogve, were but to Singe A forcéd orgie; and would much impaire The lustre due to his full Character. Let Common Pens, who make a Trade of Rime, Racke vertue in her Shapes, vnto the Chime Of mercenarie Number; I am free, And bring my Iudgment with my Elegie; Which is at once, to pay the Debt I owe His Memorie, and give the world to know Some Light of his Deservings. Though it be Knowne to the present Age, Posteritie May want Him, and th? Example; when, this weake Tribute I pay his Memorie may Speake. Indeed he was, (I speake not in the Art Of Passion, but with an open Heart;) A man of a Cleare Soule; and full in all The accomplishments of man, in generall. A mind as large as Bountie, and a Brest Where Loyaltye prevail'd with Interest; For his owne Private, or his private freind, Hee could not value to soe base an End. The rest, let Meux record, and Holdernes, There pay in all its Tears, to his Decease; Whilst wee interre him by his Ladie's Side; So ioyn?d againe, whom Death did once devide; And I, (their Poet) Celebrate their Fames Glorious, to Time, and Equall in their Names. To honour the Memorie of Loyaltie &amp; Courage eminentlie glorious in: Sir T: M Tears are the orphans of Distresséd Care; I will not blot his Mention with a Teare, Whose name deserves a Trophie; though he fell Vntimelie, to his freinds, he dyed soe well, It were a Sin to Honour, to lament Him in his Fate, his Life's best ornament. That Day, that Day of Blood, which Fame shall write Red in her Annals, knowes how farre he might Claime all I would ascribe.—He could not live To better purpose, then his bodie give A willing Sacrifize, vnto the Cause Hee valued Dearer;—for he knew noe pause; Noe Limitation, would his Zeale allow. Hee valued Death but as he found it now, Reward, vnto his Services.— How many that sad Day can make a Storie Of what they did? Romanc?s of vaine Glorie; But scarce a Tongve can tell of Him, whose Zeale Transported Him beyond All they could tell. Noe doubt Each did his part; but it can fall A wrong to None, to write a Truth of All. His liveing Name and Honours are compleat, And fitt for Storie, in his glorious Fate. It might have bene a brave Ambition in A Common Man—(but he could never Sin, In Second Ends)—to run vpon the Edge Of a consider?d Ruine; where the pledge Was his owne Countrie, and the Glorie more Then all his Actions could have bene before; This might have moved another, but he weigh'd His Loyaltie meer motive; nothing Swaied By vulgar hopes of Fame, or the ostent Which Some (perhaps) had framéd ere they went. Hee, these Contemn?d; and all he had of Ayme, Was but to right his Master; though his name Had bene a Thing forgot. But Fate is Iust And proper in Rewards;—soe vertue must Triumph in her owne progress; and the Crowne Of honour falls to her Each Action. I will not mourne for him, nor bid at all The dull Astonisht world one teare let fall; I will not Sin soe much against my faith. Where he is nigh a Martir in his Death, It were vnmanlie to his Memorie To bring such low and whineing Elegie. Such for vncurrant Knights or new-coyn'd Squire Might Suite; and straine the Poet to his hire; But like himselfe, let vs attend his Herse, With Masculine Expressions, in a Verse, True to his Honour; wee a little proud Soe to record Him; but I am not loud Enough, to publish what the stronger Breath Of Fame takes from Mee here; His Life, His Death. To the honour of S?: M: L: Commrd: in Ch': at the Releife of P'. Where Common Soules are startled, (and the Low Channels in Sordid Cowards dare not flow, But everie Drop lyes throbbing at the heart, And Strikes a Palsey thorough everie part) There, the heroicke Spirrit, vntroubled, moves, And Danger (as the worthiest obiect) loves. Each Common Action has its Common Praise; But onlie great Designes are fit to raise Immortall Trophies to Adorne a Name, And Crowne Desert, in the full breath of Fame. Soe may this Action stand, where (not alone Successe was doubted, in opinion, But) men who value number, had decreed A certaine Ruine; and (though instant need Presse the designe) are cold, and cannot Spye A seeming Face of Probabilitye, In the Attempt. Here Magnanimitie Lookes on the Act, in the Necessitie Of a distresséd Freind; not led in Heat Of Frenzye, nor inspired with the Feat To other Ends then Noble. Some, surmize Iudgment scarce warranted the Enterprize: Oh, Pardon me; for men of Honour breath A purer Ayre; and somewhat neare to faith, Moves to their vndertakings; something hid Lyes to encourage vertue.—What once bid The mightie Cæsar, in all Exigents Persist? What Reason had his Confidence? Some great Instinct (which Cowards will not know) Qvickens and gvideth Vertue. Hee dare doe What the dull frighted Pilote dares not thinke: Thou Carriest Cæsar! Cæsar cannot Sinke; Be bold in Cæsar's Fortune; who Reserv?d To better Fate, has bene till now preserv?d; And if the gviding Influence here faile Him to protect, it is enough, to fall With Cæsar, in his Fate.—Each noble brest Has this inhærent Fire. What Hee exprest Vertue still pleads; and fortune oft Attends A Resolution pitch't on noble Ends. Soe here, though mark't for Slaughter, by the vote, And Sacrifized to Ruine, in the Thought Of Some (who were Freinds to the Enterprize,) The Action prospers;—Boast not victories Too Loud, vncertaine Fame! Truth only tell The honour of the Action; which may well Erect a Piramid.—But Blood &amp; Slaughter scarce Support y? Name of honour. Hee Appears Lesse glorious in the Crimson of that Day, (Where Hee, his Numbers treebled, beat away; Where many Deaths of Enemies, and All The Spoile of Armes, to Him (as victor) fall), Then in the hearts of liveing Men. Soe farre Humanitie enforces, beyond warre, In the Sterne Rape of Power. Live, mightie Soule, To perfect many Such, whilst I enroll In a darke verse thy Fame; till (by thy Sword The Age reduc'd) I may bequeath a word, Fit to enforme Posteritie what Name Wee owe our Peace to; when the better Flame Of Poesie (now Shaded) may by thee Again b' inspir'd to Truth and Libertie. Till when, my Numbers doe noe further spread; I will not Write what others may not Reade. Vpon an excellent Treatise Written by T: B: D: M: called Religio Medici I have not seen, (let me speake modestlie,) A finer Peice of Ingenuitie, Then in these Leaves laide out. When I survay This Bodie, I am rapt, and loose my way With wonder and Delight; soe caught, soe tyed I have noe Power to Change, to looke aside. For who can fixe vpon a vulgar Face To such a beautie? whose abundant Grace Strikes each Beholder. In such Similies Wee humor Sence, and raise but Fantasies. I now decline 'em here, and would not fill This Page with varnish of a trifling Qvill; But give a cleare round Sence; for 'twer in Mee An Error sure (almost Impietye) To be reserv?d; and that I may not blanch My owne Conceptions (though with Ignorance Perhaps Enough) take it in Short: I find The livelie Image of a free-borne mind Speake, in a Stile soe Cleare, a Sence soe full, I hardlie know an Equall; nothing Dull, But with a Spirrit, the same still; though in All I cannot ioyne; but to the rationall Exception, as each Genius intends A severall way, and vnto severall Ends; Let me but varie, to my owne, as hee To his owne Reason bends, (and certainlie Hee limitts noe man) and I cannot fall For Distances in Some, to leave in All This Authour; whom I honour much, and prise His generous Attempt; who would make wise Deluded Men, and from Infirmitie, Erect a Structure of Abilitie. Who sees his wants is wise; Hee more, who can Supplye his owne, and bring a Stocke to man; Man-generall; from whence in full repaires A Strong-built Edifice, Each man appears. These are the Fruits of his industrious Pen; T' vnvaile himselfe and informe other men; Soe naturallie plaine, so simply cleare, I know him by his Booke, as were Hee here; For it must bee Himselfe; and 'tis Enough Reading this Booke, the Man himselfe to know; To which great Character, what Man dares thinke (Fondlie Audacious) to adde with Inke? Hee is above the vanitie of Praise; And what wee add?, below him manie waies. I know he has a Mind soe free, soe full, Hee onlie writes Himselfe, and would not pull Any of Force to follow in the Tracke Hee paceth out; nor keeps Hee any backe; But Each may move within his proper Sphere, And bee with Him as free as Hee is here With all the World. Then with enlargéd Minds, Receive a worthie Gvest; but my Sence binds Onlie my Selfe; and I should preiudice You, (Equall Readers); all Capacities May (to their Strengths) Iudge others witt; and none Is limited by my Opinion, Or by the Square I move by: I am free To Truth, to Honour, and to Industrie; And what I raise, is not to bring my owne Name, as a Second or Intruder, on Fame's Theatre; and more securelie sitt Vnder the Pent-house of another's witt. I have noe End, noe Ayme, beyond the free Acknowledgment, how it hath taken Mee. And all I thinke on, is but what to Say To such a Freind as I can never pay. It is beyond my Stocke, and all I can Alledge Excuse, is, I'me but a poor Man. Is is Enough, I know, for that hee'le spare me; I have it vnder's Hand within to cleare me. 'Tis time I make an End; Each, as he list Pursue his Thoughts, and wander, in the mist Of his Affections; I am pleas?d to looke At men, in the cleare Mirror of this Booke. Augusti 1? Die: 1646. To my honored Cozen P: Cr: Esq?. an Affectionate Invitation If Flesh and Blood, or Prudee's name could charme, You might appear at Beswicke; but I'le arme You with more preiudice then you suspect. Our Feilds are barren; three daies, full erect, (Pardon the word) in Expectation T' have seene you here; the purest Distillation Our villages are proud of, is broke through The double Limbecke; and ther's none for you. Tom, if you Laugh, Ime angrie; to appease That Furie, let me meet you, where you please; I hope our Lockinton may yet produce Some thriftie Chimist's Store; something of Iuice Which (though not Spirrit) may a Spirrit raise. You know in diverse Men, how manie waies; In mee, noe fire, can mount, beyond that Sphere I place my best freinds in; and you are there: This hastilie, from Dear Cozen: G. D. Februaij: 26: 1646. To the Memorie of the Excellent Dramatique English Poets; Mr. Fra: Beaumont &amp; Mr. Io: Fletcher; Vpon the Impresssion of their Severall Comedies, Tragidies, &amp;c: I knew you not; therefore, what I may say Is free from Passion; other People may Distingvish in your workes; which vnto mee Appears like Sizors of Impietie, To part the Webbe, which you still kept intire And lov?d it Soe. As in the Globe, noe higher Nor lower, properlie is vnderstood; Soe in your orbéd witt, I know noe Flood To drowne the other's Earth; noe Element But was soe pois'd, it made one Excellent Equallie-moveing Sphere; others, who knew Your severall parts, may give, as they thinke due; For me, I am forbid. What you thought fitt To ioyne (Your Selves?) I will not Sever itt. Fletcher and Beaumount! Who shall ere devide These noble Twinn's? Twins, by the Surer side; Crossing the vulgar mouth, who gape and yawne; Credit, or Kindred meerlye by the Spawne; And can see nothing higher. Mother witt Was still their Charter, and they claime by 't yet. You, Sons of Phebus; (bright as his owne Light Vnto our Ile, late wrapt vp in the Night Of Ignorance, where witt might but appeare Like owles, in Twilight) have redeem'd vs here; And like those happie Fires (Auspicious still To Navigators, ioyn'd, if Single, ill And Fate-portending;) you revivéd have Witt's Barke, long tost vpon a dangerous wave; And Shine, to gvide and Comfort those who trye That ocean, for some new Discoverie. If there be any world beyond what you Have given maps for; Straights which none yet knew, Yet some shall vndertake; Your ioyné Flames Direct 'em; who, to Celebrate your Names, Shall Pillars raise, inscribéd, by what Light They past the false Fires; &amp; arrivéd right In the safe Port, of ?. Thus to you Future Endeavours must be ascribéd too. Soe long as Socke or Buskin treads the Stage, Beaumont and Fletcher shall enrich the Age; Or Should the Malice of hot mouths proceed To Silence Theaters; let ev?n Witt bleed To death in Catharrs, and the raging fire Of Envie Swallow truth; when they expire. November 15, 1647. G. Daniel. Sent to my dearest Brother Sexto Septemb?, 1648: by Rt: Ta Though I can nothing Say, that may accrue To vindicate Discretion; take a new Way betwixt vs, of intercourse: Oh God! Why should I write in verse? Where I am proud I write soe ever. 'Tis a Facultie I doe not boast, but Love it Modestlie. What, should I write? I will not speake of Feats, High Stories, to out-rant our dull Gazetts. Wee have noe Cause to boast; Enough, let me Write to a Brother; if that Notion be Not neare Enough, I would y? world might know Vs, by what Hee merits, what I owe. I speake of Freindship then; your Freind (my dear Nephew,) has honored Mee; Hee knowes how farre I am from Sence now; but (to You, I speake Had it not bene to him, I hardlie breake My Reservation, though our Yorkeshire Ayre Infects both Men, and Beast, Cheape in a Fayre, Yet) let me Say, had not that freind (whom I Prize, to your Character) soe handsomelye Oblig?d me, for your Selfe and for my owne Now late Acquaintance; I had hardlye gone Out of my old dull Prose; I might have writt Something of Sence; but I pretend to Witt; Now fir?d (at lest) with Love, to see your freind, And with a little wine; but let me End Vnder this Caution; if this whole Amisse Seeme foolish, to your Sober Eyes; 'tis His Who now is (not Soe, But) Dear Brother, Yours, entirelie Affectionate; G. Daniel. An Ode Vpon the incomparable Liricke Poesie Written by Mr. George Herbert; Entituled The Temple: Lord! yet how dull am I! When I would flye Vp to the Region of thy Glories! where Onlie true formes appeare; My long-brail'd Pineons, (clumsye and vnapt) I cannot Spread; I am all dullnes; I was Shap't Only to flutter in the lower Shrubbs Of Earth-borne follies. Out, Alas! When I would treade A higher Step, ten thousand thousand Rubbs, Prevent my Pace. This Glorious Larke, with humble Honour, I Admire and praise; But when I raise, My Selfe, I fall asham'd, to see him flye. The Royall Prophet, in his Extasie, First trod this path. Hee followes neare, (I will not Say, how nigh;) In flight, as well as faith. Let me asham'd, creepe backe into my Shell; And humbly Listen to his Layes. 'Tis preiudice, what I intended Praise; As where they fall so Lowe, all Words are Still. Our vntun'd Lirecks, onlie fitt To Sing our Selfe-borne-Cares, Dare not, of Him; or had wee Witt, Where might wee find out Ears Worthy his Character? If wee may bring Our Accent to his Name! This Stand, of Lirecks, Hee, the vtmost Fame Has gain'd; and now they vaile, to heare Him Sing; Bocace in voice, and Casimire in winge. Decembr: 8?: 1.6.4.8: G. Daniel. END OF VOL. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. Scattered Fancies; Formerlie Written, in severall loose papers, now drawne vp in a Liricke Poesie; 1645. By the Same Author: ? me tantum dicere Mea Nunc iuuat: ? Carmen Protrepticon; Lectori Men looke on Poems, but they doe not reade Them to the Sence; which makes the Fancie deade, And circumscribes the Author in a fewe Smooth running Words. But if you passe a Due Censure on Writer's ayme, at iudging well; Weigh everie word and everie Sillable: And though you read 'em twice, and something find To strike your Fancie, thinke there is behind Another Sence, worth all that you have knowne; The Poet made 'em Such, and that's His owne. ODE I [When I am gone, and these of mine remaine] When I am gone, and these of mine remaine, If these, or ought which I call mine, shall Stay; Read over what I leave, and you againe Adde to the Sand of Time; and give my Day As glorious Life as when I stood to breath: Hee Dyes not, who Surviv?s his Dust in Death. I doe not Beg a Life beyond my Fate, Or aske the Courtesie you would not give; 'Tis neither You nor I can set a Date To written Numbers, if a Muse bid live; And these may Live; who knowes, when winds disperse My Earth in Atomes, Men shall read this verse? ODE II [How much a verse deceives] 1 How much a verse deceives Vnhappie man! who weaves His hopes vpon it? Thinking to gaine a grace From some light wanton's face, With lighter Sonnet; His Thoughts, his Hope, his Fate hang all vpon it. 2 To Titles, or great Name, One brings an Epigram, Yet scarce knowes why; Another, comes too late, Deploreing humane ffate, In Elegie; Praising a Name, to Raise his owne more high. 3 Some, Souce in bitter Inke, The venome which they thinke, To taxe the Times; Write Satire, to betray Selfe-gvilt, whilst they display The Age's Crimes; And vindicate their owne with biting Rhimes. 4 Some, in a higher Straine, Must Annalize the Raigne, Of Cæsar's Glorie; Breath big, and thunder State, Lest he Extenuate, And dimme the Storie; Which, his Muse tells him, is not Transitorie. 5 Another, doth prefer To the full Theater, His giddie verse; Now, in a Comicke Stile, Hee wantons; in a while, Growne big and feirce, The buskin'd Muse comes out, in Blood and Tears. 6 How much the verse deceives Our hopes! Like Autumne leaves, They blow away; The time wee spent, is lost, And onlie Time can boast, In our Decay; Our verse forgot, not one Line, left to Say. 7 Great Monster! Shall wee gaine Our Labour for our paine? And noe more wage? I'le bring, to stop thy Iawes, And Cancell all thy Lawes Of Right or Rage; A Verse too Stronge for Envie or for Age. ODE III. [Give me the Sober Muse and Simple Thought] 1 Give me the Sober Muse and Simple Thought, To furnish out my Loome; Let others come, As they affect, in finer garments Clad; Happilie farder fett and dearer bought. If I had sought such, Such I could have had, At the same rate, But I decline that State; Give me the Sober Muse, and Simple Thought. 2 Expect noe fine Thing here, noe gaudie knacke; But Course and Common Things. Our Larum rings Not to the giddie Eare who seekes the Chime Of Scurril Langvage; or affects the Smacke Of Brothel-feats, laid Centinel in Rime, How to betray Soules to a Sad Decay; Expect noe fine Thing here, noe gaudie knacke. 3 Oft have I bene deceived; but ofter you Whose Ioy, in firéd blood You make your good; And pant, to see a Fancie Set to light, That may blow vp old fire, or adde a New Vnmanlie itching, to the feeble Spright. Let your thoughts move, To somewhat worthie of your Love; Oft have I bene deceiv?d, but ofter you. 4 Repent it, ere too late, Repent in Time, The Error of your witt; Thinke it vnfitt For high-borne Man, soe poorlie to decline; Scorne sordid Earth, and Ioy, in the Sublime Raptures of Truth, clad in the liveing Shine Of modest Fire; And hate your old Desire: Repent it, ere too late, Repent in time. 5 Goe, learne the better Arts of Innocence; Which will instruct you how To scorne, what now You sought with Eagernes; and to your Soule, Propose a richer prize, at lesse expence; Where the true pleasure lives, without controule Of doubt or Feare; One other Step will bring you there: Goe, learne the better Arts of Innocence. 6 Error has many waies t' entrap a Soule; A thousand more Then wee Account her Store; Changing to everie Sence, with what they please. Now Light, now fixed, Sometime seeming foule Vnto the Sence; when She the Sence doth seize With greater might, And with as great Delight; Error has many waies t' entrap a Soule. 7 Depart, false seeming-Ioyes. fond Mirth, Depart; Treachers of old, Growne in our Age more bold; Light hopes and feirce Affections, quit the place; Lay by your Tirant Scepter; for my heart Is free to Truth, disdaining Servile waies Of blinded Sence, And Passions' large pretence: Depart, false seeming-Ioyes, fond Mirth, depart. 8 Am I not Sworne a Denizon to Truth? A free Associate, Within that State, Where heaven-bred Peace is Qveene? Onlie to her I vow the remnant of my halfe-Spent youth; And never lend false Smiles, an Eye nor Eare; Noe more Suggest Your pleasures to my brest; Am I not Sworne a Denizon to Truth? 9 Nere may my Thoughts Swerve from their fixéd home; But here in Raptures dwell, Which none can tell, Who, blind with Error, run in Sensuall waies; And though the blood-fir?d Ruffian, rageing come With Scorne against my verse; and Spend his praise In Balladrie, Defending Luxurie; Nere may my Thoughts Swerve from their fixéd home. 10 Iust now he frownes, to Strike the Poet dead, If Eyes could wound, or kill; And calls them Ill, The verses he has read; and Sweats, and Swears A brain-sicke Frensie, overburdenéd, Has run a Larum to abuse his Eares; And bring a Cold Ere years, to make him old; Iust now he frownes, to Strike the Poet dead. 11 Erect that drowsie head, and yet see Day. See, the bright Skies Would Shoot into thy Eyes, With Glorie, to informe misgvided Sence. Yet be a Man, and heare what all men Say. There is a way of Truth and Excellence, Where Ioy and love, Will teach the Soule to move: Erect that drousie head, and yet see Day. 12 Let others Sing of Love and loose delights; My sober Qvill has vow?d (Though vnderstood Perhaps by few) to vse her Inke, in praise Of glorious vertue; this, the irksome nights Shall melt; and be the labour of my Dayes; This Sacred Straine, My howers shall entertaine; Let others Sing of Love and loose Delights. ODE IV. [Our Muses, not exil?d, with Sober Feet] 1 Our Muses, not exil?d, with Sober Feet, Draw forth Sad numbers, to a heavie Straine; And entertaine Some Sparke of hope, they may renew the heat, Of Rapture yet. Though frequent Sorrowes from Iust Causes spring; Some little Ayre raises my numméd wing; And Nature, not yet old in Years, Would Stop the torrent of my fears, To strike the Liricke String. 2 The thick Ayre hangs in Fogs about my head, And many Thoughts make my Sad Heart as Dull; My brest is full Of mists and Clouds; my Fancie cannot Spread, (Ore-burdenéd.) Her features, to the Life, I did intend: When I begin, it dyes, and makes an End; In broken grones, abruptly closing, A Thousand of her beauties loosing; Beauties which none can lend. 3 Come, yet a little; let our Thoughts forgett Theire torture; and some pettie Solace find. If a sad Mind Can but a little calme her Sorrowes, let The Muses' heat Breath gentle Rapture, interposing Fears, And Sing our deep Cares, vnto patient Ears; Who wounded, will not scorne our End, Well-leveil'd; though (ill Shott) it bend In a Distracted verse. ODE V. [Where, where resides content?] 1. Where, where resides content? The ioy which mortalls faigne: 'Tis neither in Extent Of Power, nor full-mouth'd gaine; Nor in the Emptie Shade Of honour; nor in Trade, Nor in vast riot, nor in Swelling boules; Nor what wee pleasure call, Diversified. The wall Of Pallaces are emptie as the holes Of Scornéd Peasants. Wee may looke The universe, in everie nooke; And Cherish giddie Fancie, that wee shall Find, what is not at all. 2. For wee may apprehend Full ioy, in the pursuit Of our desires; which End, Before they come to fruit. Soe doe I often borrow My pleasures from the morrow; It comes, and yet my Ioy has noe more Life; For what can Time produce, But moveing? Never thus Will I be Slave to Transitorie Strife; I will propose vnto my Soule, A Pleasure beyond Time's controule; A Path, where Innocence shall teach my Muse The Raptures she would Chuse. 3. And there find out, what mortalls, with their Sweat, Could never gett; And in the Sober heights of vertue, Clime To goodlie ravishment; Vntouch't by Envie, vnimpair?d by Time; For to be free, with a heart Innocent, Is onlie true Content. ODE VI. [Noe more!] 1 Noe more! Let me awhile be free, To my dear Muses; exercise your power On other men, not me; I am a freeman; know, I am my Selfe; and you Can but pretend, (at best) for what you fight; Long vsurpation cannot give you right. 2 'Tis mine, The heart you would Subdue, And Challenge, by prescription, in a twine Of many years, to you; I will, in the high Court Of Iustice, make report, Of my Sad Case, and beg, on bended knees, I may have right, from Him who all wrong Sees. 3 'Tis true, You entred by a sleight, Vpon my simple nonage; for you drew A faire pretext of right; Few freinds (God wot) I had, To give advice or ayde; But I must yeild my Earlie years, to those Who strangers were, and were, indeed, my foes. 4 Now, Man, Shall I be Slavéd Still? And kept a Child, with Trifles? Noe, I can Not Soe forget the Skill By nature lent; my years Are now past Childish fears, And my free Spirrit scornes to obey your power: Goe seeke an orphan, I am yours noe more. ODE VII. [Loe, where Hee comes! the Monarch of the Earth] 1 Loe, where Hee comes! the Monarch of the Earth, In Royall Scarlet Clad; Such obiects make me Sad; Is this a Time for Glorie, or for Mirth? 2 With azure wings, and golden Diadem, A thousand vassalls waite Vpon his goodlie State; And giddilie, the Rout, his Shadowes hemme! 3 Who this Should be, the Iudging Reader knowes; Ah, sadlie I dare say, Hee did attend, this Day, Vpon the Monster, if he bend his browes. 4 For in the front of his Retinue Stands Bold Ignorance, the first; And Ostentation nurst By the same brest, and swath?d in the same bands. 5 These misinforme the gaping Multitude, And Chatter out his Praise To them, a thousand waies; What Scepters he has won, what Lands Subdu?d. 6 For doubtles, great Hee is; though greater farre Hee be, in their report, Who limitt out his Court, To the wide Gire of Heaven's still-moveing Carre. 7 Let not their golden Sonnets Credit gaine, In your Iudicious Eyes; He has, in shamefull wise, Bene baffled oft, and may be soe againe. 8 A Shepheard's Boy, who heard him proudlie boast, Bearded the Monster late; (And triumpt in his Fate) Whose lookes, erewhile, had Cow?d a mightie Hoast. 9 Yet Still he lives; for he can never Dye, Till Time and motion Cease; Till then, he shall increase, In all the Glories of his Tirrannie. 10 A thousand, thousand Times, Hee has bene foyl?d; And where he most doth raigne, Hee formerlie was slaine, By weaker hands, of a small Infant Child. 11 This, this is hee, of whom old Poets sung; Who, more then once, was slaine, And still reviv?d againe; Nor could Hee dye, vpon his Mother flung. 12 There is an Art taught, where true Arts are taught; (For 'tis not strength alone Prevailes against his bone) Will foyle him soone, and bring his strength to naught. 13 Then be not danted, my amazéd Soule; The Giant, (were Hee more Then his owne vants) were poore, To Cope with Boyes, instructed in this Schoole. 14 Thither will I betake me, and there trye What Sleights will most prevaile, To make his Footing faile; Till I be perfect in the Misterye. 15 Then Muster vp, Collossus, to affright Stupid and retchles Men; Who know nor how nor when Nor why, they yeild their exercise, thy might. 16 And I will Sing away my common Cares, With everie Sand of Time; Where Rapture shall Sublime My new-borne Soule in an immortall verse. ODE VIII. [Oh, how I wander, oh, where shall, at last] 1 Oh, how I wander, oh, where shall, at last, My wearied feet have rest? My mind repast? Where shall I find the wishéd Port of rest, To Strike away the Fears which have opprest My wounded Brest? 2 Long Dayes I travell; bitter nights I wake; Till Heart and Head, with over-watching ake; I count the Atomes of Time's running Glasse; And thinke the Howers, (which once did fleetly passe;) Slow as an Asse. 3 I wonder Time can be soe patient; My bowells burne till all his glass be spent. The night brings horror, day gives noe releife, To my Affliction; one continued greife Weares out my Life. 4 Some pious Hand direct me! I have gone From Pole to Pole, and left where I begun. I tooke the wings which for the Day were drest, Survaied the orient, to the vtmost west; But found noe Rest. 5 Yet, yet, at length, let my spent Bodie find A short repose. Oh, would you be soe kind, You who can onlie perfect Man's desire, And give that Rest to which I now Aspire; A Rest entire. 6 Then should my Soule in mightie Raptures move: Where Sacred Rapture fires it all in Love; And ioyne my String to that Celestiall Qvire Whose Harmonie is one vnited Lire, Of Sacred Fire. 7 There Centred, Rest in all her Ioyes doth Rest; Full in her Peace; with Ioy and Glorie Blest; Still may wee travell out our Age, in Feare, To find that vpon Earth, which is noe where; But onlie there. ODE IX. [Goe, dote, fond Lover; Seeke] 1 Goe, dote, fond Lover; Seeke (To smooth lascivious Rhime) Some beautie, where Sublime Graces adorne the Cheeke; Court Lips, or Eyes, Or what you prise, With most Affection, as you can devise. 2 And see how long they please The flitting Sence, with Ioy; Either they kill or Cloy, And aggravate Disease; Noe reall good Is vnderstood, Where the maine obiect is but Flesh and Blood. 3 But if you would behold A Beautie to Entice; Revert your pur-blind Eyes; Too blind, and yet too bold. I'le Shew you here, In her true Sphere, Perfection, crownéd in a golden Chaire. 4 'Gainst which the Rage of Time Could never yet prevaile; Nor doth She want the Haile Of Poets, in a Rhime; Remaining yonge, Although she sprunge Ere Time, the Chaos into Forme had flung. 5 Nor Shall you need to bring Attributes to her praise; For her Aspect will raise A Store too vast to Singe; Such as would pose Art to disclose In any verse, and fill a Rheme of Prose. 6 This is that Beautie which Strikes dead all humane Sence; From whose sole Influence, All Creatures are made rich; And what wee praise, Soe manie waies, Are but light Sparkes, shot from these liveing raies. 7 Bring, bring the loftie verse, And Sonnet out your Dayes; Let everie word be praise, And everie Accent peirce The Ears of Men With wonder; when You faile, goe to this Source and fill your Pen. 8 Here, never Ending Love, Runns in a liveing Streame; Peace sitts vnder the Beame Of Glorie; all that move Is holie here: Pale Doubt and ffeare Exiléd are, and Envie comes not neare. 9 The witts who sung of old Their feilds of lasting pleasure, Meant this; though in some measure, (Perhaps) it would not hold; For humane witt Can onlie ffitt, The Sence with Ioy; Soe much they fail?d of it. 10 Bring in fresh Chaplets: Crowne Her, worthy all your praise; And mightie Rapture raise To sing her Name; lay downe Your brittle Theame, Caught in a Dreame, And raise a Character, in her great name. ODE X. [The Day was Darke, and Heaven his bright face Shrouds] 1 The Day was Darke, and Heaven his bright face Shrouds, In Sable Clouds; The gaudie Sun, in his Meridian Light, Was darke as Night; And horrid Stormes came rolling on the Skye. The Thunder Strucke, the Lightning feirce did flye; The Ayre incenséd, all her Streames let fall; The Cataracts of Heaven theire Doores set ope; Whose gushing Torrents call Fresh ffloods, to crosse the avaritious Hope Of men, to looke it should be faire at all. 2 My Sober Muse can say how it did wound My Sinnew-bound Vnvsefull Members; how my Sence was dull, And my Soule full Of horror and amazement; I had lost The nearest faculties that life could boast; Strucke with the Feare, into an Extasie Of Feare, like Death; indeed halfe dead with Feare; Yet knew noe reason why: I summond all my Sences in, to beare; But they were Dead, with my Soule's Agonie. 3 When loe! a glance of heaven's Immortall ray, Found out a way, (Through the vast mure of Night, into my Soule; And did controule My Stupid Sences, putt away my Feare, Made stronge my frailtie, and my doubts made cleare; That recollecting all my Thoughts made new, And weighing the late cause of this Affright; Vntroubled Heavens I veiwe; The Sun vnclouded, and the Welkin bright; Onlie the Storme was in my bosome true. For vnto him that hath a troubled Spright, Time has noe Ioy, nor Heaven's bright fface noe Light. ODE XI. [And now 'tis Faire; how shall wee Spend the Day?] 1 And now 'tis Faire; how shall wee Spend the Day? Manage the lustie Steed? Or see the Eager Hounds pursue the pray; And laugh to see him bleed? How shall wee run the ling'ring howers away? 2 Goe see the Gallant Falcon, from her wings, The Qvarrie Strike? Or stay to heare Hermogenes, who Sings Soe Angel-like? Or see the ffouler lay his treacherous Strings? 3 Or with the baited Hooke, in Devia?'s Streame, Begvile the simple Trout? Or rather take a Gun, and warre proclaime To all the Birds about? Or Sitt and talke, and make the Times our Theame? 4 And where wee faile, the pleasures of the House Shall our Discourse supplie. Plumpe Bacchus makes the heart glad, when he flowes In Cups not niggardlie: Or shall wee wage, what wee fear not to loose? 5 Some toy at Dice or Cards? Or will you tosse A Ball att Tenis? Or Let's boule an hower or two, with the same losse; Our Time wee loose, noe more. Or Billiards? or what Else you will propose? 6 Come, shall wee wanton with a Ladie's Eye, And Appetite provoke? Or keep the Round of good Societie, In high-pris'd Indian Smoke? And let the novice breake the Pipes, lye by? 7 Let's this, or any these; which you like best Pursue. The Day growes old: The Sun is halfe his Iourney to the west; But if to-morrow hold, With better Pleasures wee will be refresht. 8 Were we but now made dull with Stormie Ayre? And shall wee use it thus? That Day which (Doubtles) heaven did prepare, To fitt vs, in an vse More Noble; which wee Loose, ere wee'are aware. 9 Come, take thy Qvill along, my Sober Muse, And wee will find a place Where wee may freelie Sing, and shade our Browes, Vnder some Mirtle base; Such humble Shrubs my Thoughts doe rather Chuse. 10 Or shall wee, vnder crooked Hawthorne Sitt, And our Sad ffancies dresse? Or rather chuse our lovéd Elme, and fitt Notes to our heavinesse? Not Emulous of ffame, nor Glorious of witt. 11 However, where wee Sitt, or what wee Sing, The Day shall be made short, In sober recreations; when the wing Of ffancie flyes to sport, Heaven, Ayre, Earth, Water, all their beauties bring. 12 And be the Day or Clear or cloudie Dull, Our pleasure is the Same; To-morrowe's Expectation cannot gull Our Thoughts, in their true Ayme; Nor take from what wee seeke, in obiects full. 13 Thus then, he pleasure only doth enioy, Whose pleasure is not tyed, In change of time, to quicken or destroy; But, more securely ride, All winds and weathers, with a Constant Ioye. Him, nor the Angrie Heavens can Affright, Nor Serene Skies please, with a better Light. ODE XII. [Contented I to frame a rurall ode] 1 Contented I to frame a rurall ode, In humble Shades; Admire those Swains who in bright Southerne Glades Doe make abode; And Caroll high to Fame, with mounting Qvill: My obscure Groves best suit my humble Skill. 2 Let me vnto the fameles Devia?'s Shore, Low Accents frame; Vnenvied in my ffate, or in my ffame; And raise my Store ffrom noe man's Harvest; but a Stocke produce ffrom native bounties, to enrich my Muse. 3 And run, with changing Chords, as ffancie gvides, To everie new Obiect of Chance; which wee will more pursue, The more it slides; And gather a fresh Stocke, from all wee see; Our numbers Chargéd in varietie. 4 My Temples bound, not in a wreath of bay; (For be it farre From my free Thought, soe high Attempt to dare) But humble Hay; May rest secure; and if I be content My ffate is better, ffame as Eminent. 5 There will I sing, vast Nature in her Store; And sing the Power Which gives to Nature all her wealth; the bower Of All (and more) Perfection; where all fullnes doth remaine; Parent to Nature, who doth All sustaine. 6 Nature, made faire in all her best Attire, Brings it from hence; Her weakest Ray, her beames of Excellence, Shoot from one fire; And not her lest production but doth Stand A powerfull wittnes of his mightie Hand. 7 As Life and fforme did from his breath proceed, In the same way Comes Sence-depriveing Death, and Sharpe Decay. Wee doe not tread But a fresh wonder rises, to display Its beauties; Sparkes from the Eternall Ray. 8 A thousand Times I contemplate his Store, In earthlie Things; I yet rise higher, and my Iudgment brings A Thousand more; Yet treebled, and I looke vpon the Sun To gather new, and end where I begun. 9 There is noe Day soe Sad, noe night soe Dull, But I can meet Ten miriads of wonder; and forget That I am full; From nothing (be it scorn?d) but I can gather, A Praise vnto this vniversall Father. 10 Hee rules the ruleing Monarchs of the Earth, And Peasants poore; The crawling Emmets have from him their Store; Lions their Birth; The Royall Eagle flyes but by his might; And Hee secures the Sillie Sparrowe's flight. 11 The mightie Cedar getts from him his Sap; And Shrubs their Iuice; The Rose and Lillie flourish by his Deawes; Nettles, by hap, Come not to seed, but by the Influence Which He, to everie Creature, doth dispence. ODE XIII. [Soe powerfull Nature, doth in Things appeare] 1 Soe powerfull Nature, doth in Things appeare, To this Great Rector's will; Some things live but a Day, and some a yeare; Some, many yeares fullfill; Some, which in Nature were thought strong enough, Doe soone Decaye; And the weake Spray Which yeilds to everie wind, is sometimes tough. 2 The long-liv?d Raven sometime knowes a Date Short as the Sparrowe's Life; The Stagge and Sheepe may be co-terminate, In Nature's finall Strife; The mightie Elephant and Mouse may run An Equall race; And in this case, The Heliotrope may live with the last Sun. 3 That wonder; is it Nature's? that a Flower Observing all his path, Should change the Station with Him everie Howre, And feele a kind of Death, When his Flame quencht, to westerne waves doth fall; Againe inspir?d, When he is fir?d; When in his South he rides, spred most of All. 4 Or, be it Nature's worke, who gave her Power? The word is the mistake; You call it Nature, but I call it more; That which did Nature make. For what is Nature? but the Creature All Seal?d by his hand; And cannot Stand Without his ayde, nor yet without Him fall. 5 For not the Elements whereby we live, Can Challenge ought in this; Hee made them Strong, or wasting; he did give The breath, which still is His, To everie Creature; Soe that wee can find Noe Shape at all; For what wee call Nature, but his Impression in the Kind. 6 Thus I agree, and thus I dare avow Nature our Strongest Light; For the Thing men call Art, I doe not know A Thing more Sleight; For what bold Impudence dare boast a Trade? Or vndertake More strong to make, The Creature, the Creator perfect made? 7 This mightie Idoll, which fond men adore, Is but a Shadow vaine; Boasting of Knowledge, knoweing nere the more; But makes an Easie plaine Path, intricate and rugged; to invite By silken Clue Such as pursue Her winding Steps, to an Eternall night. 8 The Knowledge men would know, if they could tell What their own thoughts/Soules would know, Is Nature's Patent, Stampt with Heaven's Great Seale; Which, well surveigh'd, will Show Large Misterie, and Misterie vnfold: Then doe not Strive (Fond men,) to give Your ffreedome to a Zanie, blind and bold. 9 It is the great Imposture of the world; A Snare to ruine Sence; A pitt where glorious witts have often hurl'd Their brightest Excellence; Where Sober Knowledge and the Light of Truth Were never heard; But Hee who rear'd His ffollie loudest, with a high-rais'd mouth. 10 And doubtles, thus the Earth with Iove made warre: When man shall vndertake To Circle mightie Nature in the Sphere Which groveling Fancies make; What is it This, but to their power, to raise A mound, to Scale Th? Olimpicke wall, And deprive the Creator of his praise? 11 But mightie Nature, (provident in All) Did this of old foresee; And sett before the Face of Truth a wall, Beyond Discoverie; Lest Man, too bold in veiwing her bright Shine, Might proudlie vant Hee did not want Of the Perfection iustly call'd Devine. 12 Soe fell the Angells; soe did Man, at first, And soe doth often fall; For soe bold Crime how iustlie was Hee curst; Who seeking, lost it All. And if there be a parcell of that Fire Not yet put out; It is, noe doubt, From the first Flame, who gave it first entire. ODE XIV. [Nothing in Nature can be certaine fixt] 1 Nothing in Nature can be certaine fixt, But to the mover's will; All varie, in their Motions strangelie mixt; Nothing but changeth Still. And what wee 'count in Nature monstrous, Is nothing lesse; It is to vs; But is a true production, to expresse The Maker infinite, to noe rules Tyed; And 'tis his Power to be Diversifyed. 2 Is there a certaine growth in any Tree? Or Shrub, or humble plant? Are wee made Iudges which most perfect be, Or which perfection want? Shall wee assume vnto the giddie Sence, What is beyond All the pretence Of humane Reason, certainlie to find? Perhaps the crooked Hawthorne (to the Eye Of Nature) is as right as Cedars high. 3 'Tis the same hand which clad the blushing Rose, Which did the Henbane dresse; The fragrant violet by his bountie growes, And loathsome weeds noe lesse; Hee makes the various Tulip please the Eye; And yet his Care Doth not denye To the poore Dazie, happilie as deare; And sure the vulgar marigold may Cope, In Nature, with the faméd Heliotrope. 4 Nor did he bid, what wee account most faire, The Apple, Plumme, or Grape, Be cherisht more, in Nature's equall Care, Then her less-valued Heape. The Crab and Sloae, he doth alike protect; Nor brambles base Doth he neglect; But as the supreme Rector in Each place, Doth the whole Creature with his bountie fill: Thus Nature is Expression of his will. 5 How is a Camel better in his Shape Then the despiséd Gnat? Why doe wee wonder at the Mimicke Ape? Or the Rude Parrot's chat? The Squirrel is as worthy, and the wren A better note: Is not the Hen And her brave Husband, in his golden Coat, Fair as the Phasiant? or in Nature's Eyes Perhaps as dear as Birds of Paradice. 6 The Sea, of Water cannot onlie boast; Nor doth his hand Sustaine Onlie great Rivers, or the great ones most; For Hee who gvides the maine, Is the same Providence to the least Spring; Not only Thames, But where I sing, The fameles Devia, equall bountie claimes: There will I shade my browes, and bring a Store Of better verse, to Sing his wonders ore. ODE XV. [Vnsatisfyed with Earth] 1 Vnsatisfyed with Earth (Where Greife and thousand Troubles intermixe With some poor seeming Mirth) I put on wings, and mounting higher, fixe On fairer obiects. See the great Rector of nature and the vniverse His gifts disperse, In everie kind; and all his bounties meet, To make a Harmonie compleat. 2 This Power, which Nature rules, And the whole world, is the great God of Power; The God, which antique Schooles Have aymed at; the God which wee Adore; Whose Misterie, Stupendious height, Includes the obiect of our Faith alone; For he were none, If Reason could vnfold him to our Sight; And to fraile Sence display that Light. 3 Oh Infinite! beyond the Qvill Of Nature, or her Servant, to display: Whose Power is but to will; To whom, the Earth, the Sea, and Heavens obay; How shall I dare to bring a verse Before thy Throne of Glorie? Oh, despise Not what shall rise From a full Soule; though Sinfull Lips reherse The Tenor, doe not shut thy Ears. 4 Oh, doe not shut thy Ears, Offended with my Song; but let my Zeale Thy Anger and my Fears Prevent; let thy indulgent Mercie heale The boyling vlcer of my Sin. And yet in Time, repaire the Soon-decay Of thy wrought Clay; A despis?d Shred of mankind, who has bin Made clean before; oh cleanse agin. 5 Then will I bring to thee My Himnes of Praise; and Celebrate thy Name, In the best Poesie, My humble Thoughts, or Zealous fires can frame; This, all the Tribute I can bring; And though it be above all Taske of verse, I must reherse Something to thee. The widdow can but fling Her Mites; nor I, alas, but Sing. 6 Naught have I else to give, Nor can I give it; onlie thine repay, Whose breath first made me Live, And gave me Being, in noe obscure way; Noe vegetable, Plant, nor Beast, But noblest of thy Creatures, made me man, And Christian; Borne in the Light of Truth, where glories feast The Soule, in Sempiternall Rest. 7 Thou hast redeeméd Mee From double Death; and the Strict covenant Is cancelléd by thee; Wee have a freedome which old Times did want; Thou hast secur?d me from the wombe Vnto this minute; that I now may praise For all the Dayes I have compleated, and the Time to come, Thy mercie, to the Tombe. 8 Then let my Qvill Aspire In mightie Numbers, and thy Mercies Sing; A Himn, the Soule to fire In ioyfull Rapture. Oh! could frailtie bring Those liveing heights of Poesie, Which Fancie faine would flatter witt into; Here they might flow; But wee are Silent; all our Streames are Drye; Our Qvills are Stopt, or Idlye Lye. 9 Yet, will I once assay, To honour thee, in Straines of humble Rhime. Suffice it, if I pay A gratefull Tribute. Hee, who gvides the Time Expects from Man, some howers t' applye His worke; indeed his owne. For what wee give To Him, shall live, Our richest Store; when our fraile Bodies Dye, And in the Grave, forgotten lye. ODE XVI. [Now faire and Cleare, the Heavens are pleas'd to Smile] 1 Now faire and Cleare, the Heavens are pleas'd to Smile; The purgéd Ayre doth rise, Full, in her Balme and Spice; Spiknard and Cassia breath, to reconcile Opposéd Elements; Aurora faire Spreads all the Treasure of her haire, T' envite the Active Phebus more away, And glad the Creatures in a well-come day. 2 The night is fled, and Daye's best Chorister Kickes his feild-Bed with Scorne; In livelie Rapture, borne To those Etheriall Courts of wonder, where His Liricke notes, left fyled, Preservéd are, vnsoyled; The Royall Eagle, in the welkin towers, And for his prey, with mightie pineon Scowers. 3 The manly Cocke, has long his Bugle shrill?d; And thriftie villagers Have long since shak?d their Ears; Each busie in the Labour he is Skill'd; Their frugall wives Assay The offices of Day; The night-pent flockes vnbound, spread ore the Hills, And Coridon, their Swaine, his loud Pipe Shrills. 4 Only I slug it, with a careles Head; And my free Genius Steepe In the wide Gulph of Sleep; And loose my Spirrits in a tempting Bed. My Limbes, vnapt to vse, And all my Ioyes, my Muse, Forgot in Slumbers; and my heavie Eyes Invite fresh Dreames; I have noe will to rise. 5 Yet let not vertue leave me; I will Shake Those fetters into Ayre; And my quick Thought prepare, For free and active Rapture. I will make Rich Nature open All Her treasures; which shall fall A harvest, to enrich my sober Qvill; And purgéd Ears, with gratefull Accents fill. 6 Forsake me, you dull ministers of Sleepe, And let me Raise my Qvill, To Court th' Olimpicke Hill, With Earlie praises; and Survay the Heape Of Nature's bounties. Then If I (soe bold) may Pen Something to praise Him, whom I most admire My God, my Glorie; I have my Desire. ODE XVII. [When I would bring] 1 When I would bring One verse, to Sing Thy Name, how Dull am I! Should I reherse Some toy in verse, My giddie Fancie then would flye; Wretch that I am! How glad I am of this poore trade, This Sillye Rime! Yet when I would endeavour To Celebrate the giver, In a well-weigh'd Iudicious Poesie, how lesse Sublime My numbers move then ever. 2 When I my Clod Would kicke, oh God, How am I fetteréd; At either heele, Me think's I feele A plummet, heavier far then Lead; Or like the Falcon, knit Vnto the Perch, I flitt, And make a bayte; I picke my Iesses; and assay For Libertie, in everie way; But cannot hitt. I toyle and flutter; faine would breake the grate, Where I am mewed, of Clay. 3 I may, Sometime, In halfe a Rime, Hop from the Turfe; but when I would attempt A raveshment, T' enrich my drye and drousie pen; Check'd by my bonds, I fall, And lime my Selfe, in all The muite and Slime. The more I would Aspire, The more (Alas) I tire; Enforc'd to call My Clog, to be my Stay; and pant a Time Vpon my Bed of mire. 4 Poore helples Man, What number Can Expresse thy weaknesse? Had All Qvills bene bent, To this intent, How were it more then yet a Shade? There is a Dismall Screene Of Earth and Sin betweene Vs and the bright Obiects wee would discerne. How farre are wee to learne The yet vnknowne Beauties of Truth? and onlie hope a Light For which our Bowells yerne. 5 Leave me awhile, Officious Qvill; For I have a great Thought Vnforméd yet; Nor can I fitt It to the better Formes I ought. Let me awhile retire, Till warm?d with Sacred Fire, My Active nerves Secure a stronger flight, To gather (from that Light Which I admire) Some ray; (alas) till then the Sinner Sterves, In a Sad winter's night. ODE XVIII. [Thus wee deceive our selves, and Everie Day] 1 Thus wee deceive our selves, and Everie Day Creates another hope: as wee might Say Time is not ripe, when our Time flyes away. 2 Were but to-morrow come or next Day here, Wee should be happie; or some seaven yeare Hence, wee'le have Peace, and dwell noe more in Feare. 3 How hardly are wee pleas'd, how less content In present fortunes? And wee still prevent Our Ioyes, in Expectation of Event. 4 One Day's too long, another is too Short; Winter is Cold, Summer vnfitt for Sport; The Spring is bitter, and the Autumne Smart. 5 But for the frost, (God knowes) what wee'd ha' done; Now wee crye out of Raine; and now the Sun Shines too too hot, when other fault is none. 6 What wee'd hav? done! if this Thing had not bene; Still one mischance or other comes betweene Vs and our Hopes; or else, the world had seene 7 A Trophie, to convince Posteritie Of our great Diligence and Industrie; Our Prudence, Iustice, and our Pietie. 8 But ah! wee are not happie; never since Some Day of ffate, (as we would make pretence) Has the same Starre had his owne Influence. 9 Oh God! how mad are men! and I not lesse Then he the maddest; in the emptines Of Hope I loose my Youth, I must confesse. 10 And Delatorie Causes still invent, To my owne preiudice; in the intent I would pursue most to my owne content. 11 Else why should I, this Day, my Qvill forbeare? Noe Day noe Line; but in the Kalender This is a Day, though shortest in the yeare. 12 And am I therfore tyed, (because the Sun Is not with vs Eight howers,) to leave vndone The Daye's worke? for a morne or Afternoone. 13 Such students are too regular, and make A Toyle of their Endeavours; let them take Their nine for bed-time, and their five to wake. 14 Such method, yet I know not: though I be A-bed at Ten, I tarrie vp till three, Next morning; then I watch as much as Hee. 15 For 'tis nor Day, nor night, nor any Time That can Deterre a Muse, in the sublime Raptures of Fancie. Had I now a Rhime 16 Of worth and price; this short December Day, It would spin out, to make my Readers say, Long Barnabie was never halfe soe Gay. ODE XIX. [I doe not feele the Storme] 1 I doe not feele the Storme Which vexes you in the too soone Decay Of your fair garden's verdure; where noe Spray Lookes green, noe Flower But run into his root. Your fruit trees lower; You cannot set your foot In all your Garden on a liveing worme. 2 The glorie of your Toyle, The high-pris'd Tulip, has noe Colour now; The Gilly-flowers are dead; the Rose can show Nor Red nor Smell, T' envite the willing Sence. Who now can tell The violet's residence? The Sweet-briar drye, the Lillie has noe foyle. 3 When I, beyond the Rage Of Time, or winter's malice, now can Show A liveing Paradice, and lead you through Greene Alleys, set With ever-verdant flowers; The violet Wants odour to the worst of ours; Trim Nature stands here in firme Equipage. 4 I have a Rose, will keepe Its Secret and beautie to another Spring; (Nor wonder that I say it) I can bring, This verie Day, (Dead winter haveing nipt Yours into Clay) A goodly Tulip, Stript In Gold and Purple; Nature not asleepe. 5 How doe they drop away! Your flowers and Ioyes together? Goe with me Into Apolloe's Garden, you shall see To mocke at yours, And frustrate all your Thought, A bed of Flowers, Into quaint Mazes wrought; The Muses' bower, vnder the liveing Bay. ODE XX. [What mad men are wee of the versing trade!] 1 What mad men are wee of the versing trade! To give our witt To Everie Censure! And, noe doubt, A Thousand to the Common Eye has Strayed, Ere one has hit; And vs, the workmen, fooles, they flout. 2 An Epicke is too grave, a Satire Sharpe; Sonnet is Light, Elegie Dull; in Epigram Wee want our Salt; and Ignorance will carpe, Although we write A Region beyond All they claime. 3 Yet Silly men are wee; and here I should Desist from all My Exercise of witt, if sure I knew an able Iudge to read, that could But Errors call, Which Errors were; and know what's pure. 4 I durst not put my witt vnto the Test Of such a Man; I find a gvilt, with my owne Eyes, A partiall Father; yet not soe possest Of my owne braine But I can see Deformities, 5 Perhaps a fault, where the good Reader huggs My verie Name. And let him Ioy in all he found; Where I am proud of witt, perhaps he Shruggs; And Sighes, 'tis Lame; Soe 'twer, if I to him were bound. 6 But let me give Advice. Doe not pretend To iudge of witt; It is an Emmett in a Cloud; And you have but dimme Eyes, my honest freind. If wee Submitt, Your Sence may make this Ant a Toade. 7 Then will I not sitt downe with this Rebuke; But once againe Ioy with the Muses; innocent In my designe; adventuring to looke In noe man's braine For witt, beyond his Argument. ODE XXI. [When Ease and Sleepe, the busye world has husht] 1 When Ease and Sleepe, the busye world has husht; And Sixe howers cold, the Sun, our Hemisphere Has left in Darke; I with the Muses Ioy, and freely there Expostulate my Fancies, to the Iust Ayme of their marke. 2 A Thousand obiects flitt within my braine; Some slip, as Shadowes; some like Columnes stand To fixe vpon; Which I survay, and with a serious hand Delineate; cheiflie to entertaine My selfe alone. 3 And though my Body hardly well allowes These frequent watchings, I am soe much wed To my Delight, When Ease and Health would move me to my bed; And (free from gvilt) with vnperplexéd browes, Might sleepe the night; 4 Yet rather Chuse I, to my Health's impaire, With gentle Muses, to bestow my Time, In the weake blaze Of a Sad Lampe; and free from greater Crime, Sing to my selfe the Fancies I prepare, A Thousand waies. 5 And I will Sing great Things; perhaps to please The Iudging Reader, and to pussle those Who pretend more. But Stay! my carefull Leech noe more allowes; Checks my Disorder; and has stay'd, to dresse Mee, a long Hower. 6 For, I must now observe Him; but when Time M'imposthum'd Members shall againe make light; I will be free, In midnight Revels to the Appetite Of my owne Genius, in the purest Rhime And Poesie. ODE XXII. [Cleare, as vntroubled waters from their Spring] 1 Cleare, as vntroubled waters from their Spring, And pure, as Innocence her Selfe can Sing; Modest, as virgin Brides, Whose gentle blushings hides What they expresse; Sweet as the blooming Rose; Faire, as the Earlie Morning, when she Showes Her golden fface, and Deawie Lockes doth tye In azure Fillets; Such be my Poesie, 2 Not bound to flatter Titles, or let loose To vulgar passions, in the Times' abuse; Not limited, not Free, Further then modestie Can warrant, in Each Syllable; not led To Sooth opinion, neither soe much wed To my owne Sence, but I all formes may See In proper orbes; Such be my Poesie. 3 Such be my Poesie, that Number may In Clear expressions, all my Thoughts display; Such Rapture fill my Thought, As I may vtter nought, Beneath the dignitie of a free Muse; And gvided by my Genius, Chuse Obiects sublime; adoreing God, the high Author of Truth; Such be my Poesie. ODE XXIII. [Poore bird! I doe not envie thee] 1 Poore bird! I doe not envie thee; Pleas'd in the gentle Melodie Of thy owne Song. Let crabbéd winter Silence all The wingéd Qvire; he never shall Chaine vp thy Tongve: Poore Innocent! When I would please my selfe, I looke on thee; And gvess some sparkes of that Felicitie, That Selfe-Content. 2 When the bleake Face of winter Spreads The Earth, and violates the Meads Of all their Pride; When Saples Trees and Flowers are fled, Backe to their Causes, and lye dead To all beside; I see thee Sett, Bidding defiance to the bitter Ayre, Vpon a wither'd Spray; by cold made bare, And drooping yet. 3 There, full in notes, to ravish all My Earth, I wonder what to call My dullnes; when I heare thee, prettye Creature, bring Thy better odes of Praise, and Sing, To pussle men: Poore pious Elfe! I am instructed by thy harmonie, To sing the Time's vncertaintie, Safe in my Selfe. 4 Poore Redbrest, caroll out thy Laye, And teach vs mortalls what to saye. Here cease the Qvire Of ayerie Choristers; noe more Mingle your notes; but catch a Store From her Sweet Lire; You are but weake, Meere summer Chanters; you have neither wing Nor voice, in winter. Prettie Redbrest, Sing, What I would speake. ODE XXIV. [It is Enough to me] 1 It is Enough to me, If I her Face may see; Let others boast her Favours, and pretend Huge Interests; whilst I Adore her Modestie; Which Tongves cannot deprave, nor Swords defend. 2 For could She ffall, To what we call Censure; how weake and vulgar were her Fame! Not Ignorance would hold Till his long Tale were told; Though scarcelie he has ever heard her Name. 3 If wee might read Her truly Charactred: It were enough, Error to vindicate, To warme the Stupid wretch, (Who onlie lives to stretch His frozen nerves) with Rapture, 'bove his Fate. 4 But while I bring My verse to Sing Her Glories, I am strucke with wonder, more; And all the Formes I see, But Emptie Shadowes bee, Of that Perfection which I adore. 5 Be silent then, All Tongves of Men, To Celebrate the Sex; for if you fall To other Faces, you Wander, and but pursue Inferior obiects, weake and partiall. ODE XXV. [My Dear Pudora, though the greedie Flame] 1 My Dear Pudora, though the greedie Flame Has Swallowed all the Inke Which I (the weake Adorer of thy name) Once lavisht out; yet thinke A second Store, Tooke from thy Graces, may to better Light Celebrate thee; I am not ban'rupt Qvite; And were I poore To the Extreame of Ignorance, that Fire Still liveing in your Eyes, would Heat inspire. 2 Doe not, oh doe not, (Goddes of my Muse) Thinke I have lost that Zeale My former Qvill profest; nor thinke I chuse Of lower Things to tell; Forbid it, all My better Fate! noe, rather may I pine In my owne Ioy,—my verse,—if my designe Did ever fall Vnto another obiect; but I still Steer'd by your Eyes; Starrs to direct my Qvill. 3 Nor blame some looser Sheets, if (when I lackt Your Light) my verse might Stray From the precise Path, which your Steps had track't; I cannot, dare not Say; But I have gone Sometimes aside; yet take, in leiu of All My follies, this Acknowledgment; 'tis small The wrong I ha' done; Pardon, where I Nicotiana Sung; And I dare say, I never did you wrong. 4 For though, in Silvia, I my selfe might please; 'Twas but at once to bring, Vnder that name, a double Species; And where I loudest Sing, With all my Praise, To honour Her, I but derive a Sparke From your more radiant Flame, which is the marke Of all my Bayes; But Shee, revolted like her Selfe, can claime Nothing in all my Poesie but Name. 5 This may Suffice; Great Rectres of my Thought, Daigne once againe to smile On my Endeavours; and I will not doubt To vindicate our Ile From all the blast Of Envie or Detraction; I will raise Huge Monuments of wonder, manye-wayes; Which shall outlast The rage of Time, and stand the Boast of Fame; My verse Eternized, in Pudora?'s name. ODE XXVI. [How am I lost! though some are pleas?d to say] 1 How am I lost! though some are pleas?d to say My mossy Chops estrange All former Knowledge; and my Brother may, At distance interchange Discourse, as to a man he nere had knowne; It cannot be, perswade Your Selves; for when you made Me take a Glass, I knew my Face my owne. 2 The verie Same I had three years agoe; My Eye, my Lip, and nose, Little, and great, as then; my high-slick't Brow, Not bald, as you suppose; For though I have made riddance of that Haire, Which full enough did grow, Cropt in a Zealous bow, Above each Eare; these but small changes are. 3 For wer't my worke, I need not farre goe seeke The Face I had last yeare; The growing Frindge but swept from either Cheeke, And I as fresh appeare, As at nineteene; my Perru'ke is as neat An Equipage as might Become a wooer, light In thoughts as in his Dresse; but I forget; 4 Or rather I neglect this Trim of Art; And have a Care soe small To what I am in any outward part, I scarce know one of All; 'Tis not that Forme I looke at. Could I find My inward Man, compleat In his Dimensions! let Mee glorie Truth, the better part's behind. ODE XXVII. [Soe should you have my Picture, would it change] 1 Soe should you have my Picture, would it change And varie to the Time; But when I see Art permanent and Nature fade, how Strange Would it appear to me! And twitt my Slime As weake Materialls, to the Painter's stuffe. There youthfull Still, in my Selfe bald or rough, With Age and Time enough. 2 'Twould trouble me, when I, with frosted hairs, Should looke at what I was, And see my selfe Sangvine and fresh, my Eyes there quicke and Cleare; And I, a Sordid Elfe. What a sweet Glasse Were this to make me mad! and love againe My youthfull Follies, and but change the Straine; Doating, for Light and vaine. 3 Noe, would you see me better, you who presse To have my Picture tooke, Beyond all Art; I leave it here, my selfe; it will expresse More then the formall looke Or outward part. A better draught I leave you; doe not Strike My Feature to the Cunning of Vandyke; This, this is farre more like. 4 Here looke vpon Me, as I am in Truth; Let everie Leafe present Some severall part; And draw 'em into forme, to the iust growth Of my intendement; To pussle Art, In her loud boast, and something leave behind Vnto my Freinds; that whosoe lookes, may find Th? Effigies of my Mind. 5 And though, perhaps, the Colours are but poore, And some defects appeare To the strict Eye; You will not Censure want of Cunning more, To pourtray Truth, if I Have bristlie haire, Or my head bald, or beard in Cop'ses grow; Will Art soe trim me, that they must not show? Who then my Face could know? 6 Had I bene more exact, I had bene lesse; And though I might have put More varnish on; It had bene Time ill spent, and might expresse More fine proportion; But, without doubt, Lesse to the Life; and I would now appeare In my Iust Symmetrie: though plaine, yet Cleare; Soe, may you see me here. ODE XXVIII. [What a Strange Thing is Man!] 1 What a Strange Thing is Man! How weake in his Designe, His Wisedome! For I can See others now in mine; How Dull! how lost! To what he Studied most. 2 Wee cannot looke vpon Our inwarde selves, but find Man generall; for one Is all and everie Mind, In some Degree; Seeing our Selves, wee others see. 3 The same our Common Cares; Our Passions are alike; Our causeles Hopes and Fears At the same obiects strike; And all our Store Of Follies, less or more. 4 Our Frailties, our desires, Our Policies, our Plots, Are fed from Common Fires: Not wisedome, in her knots, But cunning hands, May, by his owne, loose others' bands. 5 This Image. which wee reare Vnto our Selves, is not Soe radiant and Clear As wee suppose; the lot Is free to All: And diverse things, by the same name, we call. ODE XXIX. [This Dullnes is improper to the Day] 1 This Dullnes is improper to the Day; And I am Sad, not in a common way; My Fancie, Darke as night, And fixéd; all the Light Of Reason fled; And I am dead Vnto my selfe; I seeke A Thousand waies to breake The Cloud which doth involve me, and invade With a strange Mist, the little light I had. 2 I cannot speake what I would strive to say, And what I most would doe, I most delay; I doe not know my Thought; Or rather I thinke nought Which can be knowne; I'me not my owne Disposer to the poore Follies of everie howre; And common Things I can noe more intend, Then grave Designes; but from all purpose bend. 3 How am I Stupid? How below my thought? Am I to Sottishnes and nothing brought? I doe not breath as once, But clos?d in Ignorance I seeme to dwell, As in a Shell; Where my close-breathing tires My Lungs, in oft respires; And fainting, all my Spirrits loose their vse: Why am I choack'd? why am I stifled thus? ODE XXX. [The Sprightlie Larke, vpon yond Easterne Hill] 1 The Sprightlie Larke, vpon yond Easterne Hill, His early vowes Has pay?d; and summons vp my Lazy Qvill, Againe to rouse, And in Cleare notes, like her owne Harmonie, Salute the Day; But I, Dull Sinner, Stay, And her third Himne perform?d: How dull am I! 2 The golden beames of bright Apollo long Has warm?d the Earth, And got his morning draught. I have a Tongve, And noe such Dearth Of ffancie, to be meerlie silent, when All Creatures bring Somewhat for offering; Why should I sleepe? or not enlarge my Pen? 3 It were but soe, had still the Power of Ice In Ebon walls, It Pris'ner kept; I will awake, arise, When Vertue calls. Shame were it to prefer a Pillow, soft With Ease and Sin; To her resplendent Shine: I better Feathers take, and mount aloft. 4 Emu'lous of the Larke, in her vprise, And in her Song, I quitt this dunghill Earth; let it suffice, If I, among The other Creatures, a small Tribute bring; One verse or note, Though from a harsher throte: The poore wren Cherups what the Larke doth Sing. 5 In a Consort of Praise all Creatures ioyne; The Squallid owle Twitters a midnight note; though not soe fine, Yet with a Soule As gratefull as the nightingale's cleare Song; The vniverse Doth the great Himne reherse; I only bear my part the rest among. 6 Then, with fresh Pineons drest, I will assay My part to raise; And celebrate his Name, who to this Day, Hath many waies Preserved me. Oh, God! I have a Qvill, Muddled and lame, To magnifie thy Name; Asham'd, I lay it by, I've done soe much soe ill. ODE XXXI. [Welcome, my Lampe! awhile] 1 Welcome, my Lampe! awhile, I may enioy thy oyle, Without Disturbance; and allay The foule distempers of the Day, With sober recreations of the night; All Eyes are clos?d, of Ignorance and Spight; For it is late; My watch doth prate Of twelve or one. Deare Muses, wee may yet Solace an howre. For ever may he gett The name of Sluggard, who doth grutch A midnight hower for witt, too much. For me, I would allow All time, one Day to you. 2 Yet rather let vs keepe Our howers, and mocke at Sleepe. For safest, when the Sun is downe, From noise and Croud wee are our owne; Nor yet auspicious Phebus can produce Effects more glorious from the lab'ring Muse, Then Luna pale; Noe idle tale Of giddie wits perplex her serious howers; Noe loud day-noises, when the Cittie doores Are all lockt vp; but onlie such As ever have a Key too much. Shee takes her wing. But stay, The Cocke has summon'd Day. ODE XXXII. [Are onlie Poets mad?] 1 Are onlie Poets mad? 'Tis an vnluckie trade; Our moderne, and the old Democritus, Saw all the world were Lunatickes with vs; And if I (partiall) may The present Age survay; I am afraide Wee are not onlie, or not the most mad. 2 See to the Politicke Is not Hee partly Sicke? Are his Designes vnmixt with Drosse and Loame? Has he not some respects he brought from home? Are all his Counsells weigh'd? His Actions ballancéd Within the right Skale of cleare Iudgment, and not one found light? 3 See all the world vnfram'd, Strangelie disioynted, lam?d; And Common Men, (who have noe proiect to Advance their Fortunes,) run a-madding too; Sneake in their ffollies; prye At Madnes, Misterie; And wee may See The infection spread to All, in some degree. 4 Not least, where often most Sound Faculties they boast: This saw, of old, much-seeing Lucian; And 'tis but now the same; for everie Man Is bound to his owne heart; Not blanching any part Of his owne Sence; And strives to gvild all Follie with pretence. 5 The learning of the time Is sicke; and the Sublime Notions of Men are sunke; our Industrye Not meerlie simple) has its Subtletye; All Men have in their waies Distraction; Pride and Praise, Makes the world Mad; The Poet sings, the Polititian's Sad. ODE XXXIII. [Oh, doe not breath too loud; though greife sometimes] 1 Oh, doe not breath too loud; though greife sometimes In rude Expressions, and disordred Rhimes Appeare; It is not safe to sigh, too loud, when wee Deplore, such tender Cases; Poesie Must here Curbe her free Qvill, and couch a big intent In the darke folds of a faign?d Argument. 2 But Danger onlie gvilt attends; I bring White Thoughts, and never learnéd how to sing Of more Then Truth and Iustice in each Line might seale; Vnbyasséd with Spleene, or too much Zeale. How poore Should I my selfe account! Had I bene swaied, By these fraile Passions, this or that t' have said! 3 Then may I boldly vtter my free Thought; And to the Age, poure all my Bosome out. I will Noe longer Swell and pinch my throbbing brest, With ffears and Fancies, to my owne vnrest. Poor Qvill! Yet thou art free, and Iust to all my Care; I am befreinded Still to have thee neare. 4 And though, perhaps, I privilie expresse The summe of all my Thoughts, when nothing lesse Is read; I write what I intend, and rather Chuse Such Intricacies; though not soe abstruse As need An Index to informe me what the Ayme Was, when I laied the plott or rais?d the frame. ODE XXXIV. [It is not worth your Care] It is not worth your Care: My better Poems, which the greedie Flame Devour'd; 'tis true, they might have kept my name More glorious and faire Vnto Posteritie, then I can hope From these remaining Trifles; and perhaps Have giv?n a Light to those who can but grope The way, and Stumble; or surpris?d in Trapps Of Cunning, fall to Ruine. This, and more, They might have done; But I am one, Who value nothing of my private Store. Who knowes, but they determin'd were, to fall Part of a greater Ruine? and vnfitt To give such Light to future Times as shall Brand our owne Age in witt, for want of witt? I doe not yet despaire, When silver-wingéd Peace againe shall Shine, To raise a Poesie in everie Line, As high, as full, as faire. ODE XXXV. [Poor Clod of Earth, Despise] 1 Poor Clod of Earth, Despise Thy Slime, and yet be wise. Thou art vnable to attaine That Pitch, And knowing it, not to refraine Were madnes; yet desist; Though with a greedy fist And Itch, Thou covet it. Leave of to clime That Hill which will vpbraid thy Time. 2 Though fir?d with glorie; all Motives of Honour call Thee vp to this sublime Endeavour; Yet know The golden Anadem is never Designéd for thy head. A Thousand, thousand, led As thou, With selfe-surmises, yet appeare Examples, others to deterre. 3 And though the Goale were won Thou dost propose, vndone Were yet the greater worke: it is Beyond Thy manage, were it taught; to this My feeble Lampe, as much Might fire Heaven's greatest Brouch; And find Perpetuall Fuell, to Adorne Th' Horizon better than the Morne. 4 Away, presumptuous wretch! 'Tis set beyond thy reach. With humble Admiration fall, And kisse Thy mother Earth; farewell to all Thy follies bid; and see Its state, and thy degree; Soe misse Thy certaine ruine. Soe the Sun Wee see best, in reflection. 5 Invert thy Eyes and see Its State, and thy degree; Where many formes appeare, and all The hid Causes in Nature rise or fall, To what wee apprehend, Which is not true; vnbend That thred Of Fancie, knit before; and See, Truth onlie meets Humilitie. ODE XXXVI. [Huge weight of Earth and Sin] 1 Huge weight of Earth and Sin, Which clogs my lab'ring Thoughts in their vprise; I am not wise Enough, to breake my Chaine, or cast my Skin, With prudent Adders. Could I slip From my old Slime, how would I skip! In my new Robes of Innocence, and veiwe Things in their Causes, absolute and true. 2 Then, in a scornfull heat And brave Disdaine, enfranchis'd would I flye, To kisse that Skye, Wee now admire; and find a fixéd Seat Above the lower Region; where Th' attractive Earth, I need not feare; But move without my Load, and, at one Step, As eas'ly mount the orbe as downward leape. 3 There could I see and scorne The busie toyle of Mankind in their waies: Their Nights and Dayes How fruitles to the End; as were they borne To satisfye their Lust and Pride, To their owne Sence diversifyed; And added nothing to the gen'rall frame, But a meer thing, put in, to have a name. 4 How everie other Thing Applies its part, and has a Motion! Which (though vnknowne) Doubtles, it doth aright performe; and bring Its little to maintaine the whole: Man onlie, who should have a Soule More noble and refin'd, by Nature made Surveiour of the worke, doth nothing Adde. 5 Diverted from the charge, Entrusted to him meerly, as beyond, In face and mind, The other Creatures; with a Thought as large As all the orbes, and wider too; Truth (whose vast Circle none can know) Was onlie bigger; and the Light of Truth, Met full and radiant here, from North to South. 6 Thus once; but now, alas, The most despiséd obiect of the world; From all this hurl'd; A Slave to Passion and his owne disgrace; Baited by Follie, and Surpris?d In the great Snare, which Hee devis?d, Of pleasant vanitie; and all the boast Hee had of Dignitie and worth is lost. 7 Poor Sand of Earth! how lost To thy owne ruine, art thou, in thy will; And plotting Still Further destruction! as though all were lost Of thy Creation, in thy Selfe; Now made a wracke, vpon the Shelfe Of Ignorance. Hop?st there thy selfe to Save From vtter Death, and the devouring wave? ODE XXXVII. [Looke above, and see thy wonder] Looke above, and see thy wonder; Downward looke, and see it vnder; Vpon thy Right hand, see it shine; And meet thy Left, in the same Line; Survay the Earth, and sound the deepe; From those that flye, to those that Creepe, In everie Creature: and behold, From the base Mirtle, to the old Maiesticke oke; veiwe everie plant, Herbe, root, or flower; none wonder want. Consider Springs, and as you passe, Meet wonder in the smallest grasse. Let ev?n Dust and Atomes rise, To strike new wonder in thy Eyes. Observe the rapid orbes, and see A Cloud beyond Discoverie. See all about thee, and display Thy vnderstanding to the ray Of this combinéd Flame. This tongve Of vniversall praise has sung To a Deafe Eare. All obiects stand To teach, but wee not vnderstand. Are these obscure? or too remote? Beyond thy notion, or thy note? Looke at thy selfe, and wonder more; Nature contracted in her Store. ODE XXXVIII. [Rapt by my better Genius, beyond] 1 Rapt by my better Genius, beyond The power of Earth; I sitt, And see all humaine follye in its kind. Not what wee fancie witt, But has its blemish there; or Arrogance, Or selfe-opinion, Or Impudence, or Flatterie, or Chance, Or blind Affection, Support the maine. These set away, What common Things wee doe or Say. 2 Poor crauling Emmetts! in what busie toyle Wee slip away our Time? Our glorious Daylight and our midnight oyle Spent to enlarge our Crime. What a prodigious Spectacle I veiwe! When I from hence looke downe Vpon the Common Earth, which once I knew, And made my proper owne! With as much Zeale, as were my Fate Chain?d to the whirle of her Estate. 3 Now got above the mist of flesh and blood, I am inform'd aright, In all the Misterie of Bad and Good: A never-fadeing Light Surrounds me, that to Iudge I cannot erre. What have I rashly said? Arrogant foole! my Taper went out here, And left me halfe-dismai?d, To thinke how it a Tipe might be Of the great Light put out in Mee. ODE XXXIX. [Never to be at Ease, never to rest] 1 Never to be at Ease, never to rest; What brest Is strong enough? What braine, if it were double, Could beare vnmov?d, the assaults of soe much trouble? Tost on the wave of Chance, I loose my better Selfe; Where Ignorance Cast vp a Shelfe, To ruine all my vertue; I forgot My manhood, and the Treasure which I putt A Sure And constant rescue from all hands impure. 2 Taught by Example, and the precepts which From rich Antiquitie I gather?d; I was made Fortune-proofe in her malice; not afraide To cope with Danger, in All Formes She could put on. But lost within Opinion, I was surpris?d; and ere I could collect Disperséd Notions, by an indirect Strange way, Passion prevail?d; I knew not what to Say. 3 Fortified in my Reason, once I thought (But nought Availes our owne Surmises) that the power Of fortune could not Storme me. Ah! noe more Let woman's Son be proud In his owne brest or braine. For soe I stood To entertaine All hazard vnappall'd; and had within As great a Force, as full a Magazin, As might Have flatter?d you to the Same oversight. Man is not Strong at all; nor wise, nor Fitt, His owne to manage with his proper witt; Then least, when borne by Selfe-opinion, Hee Stops the Light, and wanders in his owne Darke Principles and notions; hee attains Nearest Perfection, who his owne restrains. ODE XL. [I cannot dwell in Sorrow, neither please] 1 I cannot dwell in Sorrow, neither please My Selfe with Shadowes. Though I live at Ease, I cannot laugh away The trouble of the Day; Nor yet soe much oppress my Spright, In Tears to linger out the Night. I cannot make my Case Discourse for everie place; Nor meerlie rest, In my owne brest, Silent. I am not proud in Miserie Nor Sordid in my Hope's vncertaintie. 2 I cannot breake into an Extasie Of Passion, Danted with my Miserie; Nor make my owne Cares more Then Some have bene before. My Sufferings are noe greater then The feelings of a Thousand Men, Perhaps as Innocent; Why then should I lament The pettie losse Of goods or Drosse? Shall these, which are but casuall, subiect all My better Treasures to their Rise or Fall? 3 I cannot fall soe low; though I sometimes May looke into the glasse of these Sad Times; And 'mongst those Shadowes, See One that resembles me; Naked, and nere to ruine, in His Fortune. Yet I cannot Sin Soe much to Providence, As for the pangve of Sence, Exclaime and rave, Or wish the Grave Might end him, with his Sorrowes, or invent Fears to him, for a further punishment. 4 I cannot safelie looke at my owne Sore, Nor search too deepe, lest I should make it more. Soe, the vnknowing Leech Tortures the bleeding wretch Vnder his Cure. I am not blind To my owne Danger; neither find Soe great a Burthen in This miserie of mine; But I may Stand, And vnderstand It as the Common Lot, by my owne Share; Soe prevent Fortune, ere She be aware. ODE XLI. [I doe not glorie in my Fate.] 1 I doe not glorie in my Fate. Nor prise it at an vnder rate. I doe not boast Anything I possesse. I am not tyed Against my Iudgement, vnto any Syde; Nor am I lost Soe much to reason, that I chuse Supported Error, and refuse Neglected Truth; Contented to abide Her votarie, against the vulgar mouth. 2 Let the full Pens of vanitie Contend In what they please; And gaine the Ende Of their owne seeking, humane Praise; Lost, with the Breath wherein it straies. I cannot fall To flatter Pride and Follie in her Ease; But speake my knowledge, though it should displease The common-Hall Of Ignorance; and if I meet Death, I have found my winding Sheet. 3 I am a Man; in everie Step Of Life I tread, and cannot leape Above that name; Nor can I grovell, in a bruitish way, Lost to my nature. This is all. I say I am that Same Vnsteddye thing wee call a man; Limited in my Selfe; and can Neither deface Nor yet array That Image; 'Tis my Glorie, my Disgrace. ODE XLII. [Goe, make a Rape on Fancie; and bring downe] 1 Goe, make a Rape on Fancie; and bring downe All formes disperséd in that Region, Vnto our Common Light; Then, with a cunning Hand, collect the Parts, And make a Bodie, to astonish Arts. Draw your owne Face aright; Give common Man his Symmetrie, in all Dimensions of the mind; This were a worke to bind The indebted world, a Slave perpetuall. 2 But what thin Shadowes flitt within the Braine? What obscure notions move to entertaine Men in their owne Conceite? Wee looke at Passions through the Subtill glasse Of Selfe-conceit; and follow them, in chase, With the loud noise of witt. Wee run our Selves aground vpon that Shelfe Our Reason bids vs Shun: How soone is man vndone, Who carries his owne Ruine in Himselfe! 3 I cannot reach nor Span my Selfe within My owne Dimensions. I have often bin Busie to draw my owne To my owne Power; and with all Diligence The dispers'd Fragments of Intelligence I gladlie would have knowne; And vs'd, as in my Power, the Facultie Of everie Sence. The Reach Of Reason I would fetch Into the Circle of Capacitie. 4 I would have seen my Selfe, as in a Sheath, Within my Selfe; and, as my owne, bequeath Each part to proper use; My conquer'd Reason, to submit her Power. My Sence, corrected in Exterior Obiects, alone, to chuse What I propose; then doe not aske, what part I would have gvide the rest; I would have everie brest Capable of the rule of his owne Heart. 5 Thus could wee Draw our Selves, the worke were done; Knowledge were perfected, and truth were won. Then all our toyle had End, Our Parts reduc'd Each to his Station; And wee might live, in re-Creation. But who shall yet ascend That great Scientiall orbe, and bring away The wreath of victorie? What humane Industrie Knowes how to Doe? What witt knowes what to Say? ODE XLIII. [Walke noe more in those Sweet Shades] 1 Walke noe more in those Sweet Shades, Where Roses canopie your Heads; And the fragrant violet spreads, A purple Tapistrie; Where all the Qvire had wont to Sing Their earlie notes; and everie thing Was pleasure to entrance a King, Beyond his Destinie. Ah! now noe more, Frequent those Shades, you knew or lov?d before. 2 Goe to the horrid vale of Care, And tread the Maze of your owne Feare; There grow noe Bayes nor mirtles there, But the Sad dismall Yeiugh. Day birds are banishéd this grove, The monstrous Batt alone doth rove; And the dire Screich-owle, percht above Your over-clouded Brow; Shall make you Sad Beyond the Cause of Sorrow which you had. 3 There, horrid Croakings sound; and sad Accents of Death,—vntimelie made,— Rend humane Eares; oh! Dismall Shade, Why am I curst to Chuse In thy Sad Alleyes to weare out My Youth? in all my Ioyes forgot. To thy vnhappie walkes I brought A more vnhappie Muse; But a Muse fitt To ioyne with thy Inhabitants, and Sitt 4 Vpon the Bankes of thy Sad Poole, Where Frogs and loathsome Toads doe houle; Where all their Spaune, with yellings foule, Fill the corrupted Ayre. To these, my Accents well may Suite; My harsher grones will strike 'em mute; And teach 'em to draw ruder out, Deeper, and worse by farre; For they are free Of that ranke venome which imposthumes Mee. 5 With these, then, will I ioyne my verse; And everie Accent vnto theirs Shall double grones. Let me reherse Noe more the tunéd Lay, To liveing waters; bid Farewell To all the Silver birds, which dwell Vpon their Streams: and never tell Of my owne Devia. Farewell to all Wee Ioy, or Peace, or Light, or Pleasure call. ODE XLIV. [Away!] Away! Fond man, thy braine is Sicke, thy Qvill doth stray; There is noe Cause of Discontent, Soe farre should move thee to lament. Distresséd Fancie doth obscure Thy Reason, in the Calenture Of Passion. Erect thy vnderstanding to The Cause imagin?d of thy woe; Which is noe cause, but a pretence; Which Reason Sicke, vnto the Sence Doth Fashion. In Sober numbers, sing away Thy Sorrowes; or at lest allay The Apprehension of thy Ill. Take, take againe, thy modest Qvill; And yet retaine the Libertie thy Muse Would Chuse. ODE XLV. [Each Day another Man, another mind] 1 Each Day another Man, another mind; And wee our Selves forget. Chang'd in opinion, all wee left behind Is lost. What once was witt To our owne tast, Wee relish not; but in each newer find More Ioy; and gladlie hast Through Follie's Zodiacke, from the first to th' Last. 2 Wearie in everie Action, wee pursue, Ere wee can perfect anye; Sicke of the old, vnsatisfyed with new, And greedie after manye; Never at Ease, To our owne Thoughts; and what wee ought t' eschew, With Scorne and Bitternes, Wee hug, our Glorie; and grow fat in these. 3 Glad in all present madnes; and can looke Noe further then the Time Enioyed to the purpose. Let the booke Of Conscience babble Crime To the gray haire, Whose blood is cold, and Sinnewes palsey-strooke; Let him grow Dead with Feare, And langvish minutes till he meet the Beere. 4 But wee are yonge; and though wee doe not Love To hear our Follies read; Wee yet Act what wee please, and freely move In everie Step wee tread; Wee will not See Backe, to Committed on?s; nor yet reprove Our owne Debilitie; In the pursuit of a fresh vanitie. 5 Though I confes, when I with Iudgment scan My Actions, and pervse My Selfe, in all the frailtyes of a Man; I doe not much refuse To see the past Errors of youth, and Iudge 'em, as I can; Some please, and some distast, Some I am proud of, Some away I cast. 6 Though, in a rigid Sence, I must confesse All humane Actions are Madnes and Follie; yet this foolishnes Has made me to appeare, To my owne Eyes, My owne full Image; where without all dresse Of ornamentall Lyes, I am not blind to my Deformityes. ODE XLVI. [I grovell Still, and cannot gaine] 1 I grovell Still, and cannot gaine The orbe I flutter at in vaine. My Thought is narrow, and my Langvage weake, To give my Smaller Comprehensions plaine. Something it is, I faine would speake, But as my Fancies rise, they breake. 2 Wrapt in my native weed of Sin, I cannot cast; but search within The folds, and would a better raiment find; Starved in the old Mantle, now worne thin; This beggar's Coat deiects my mind, In all Attempts I have design?d. 3 Raggs doe not fitt a Court; nor can Man, in this Motley, meerlie man, Stand in the privie Chamber of his heart; Where Knowledge keeps the doore; and Truth doth raigne, Empresse of all; and everie part Bound to noe Rule, nor forme of Art. 4 When I (encouragéd by Some Waiters at large) would nearer come, To wonder at the Glorie of her State; I sneak'd, abash'd, into another Roome; And like Court-gazers, I can prate Of something seen, but know not what. 5 Thus, Silly man! I am content To get a Sight, although I went, Never, beyond the Threshold of her Court; Enough, I thought I saw her, in her Tent; And gvest the greatness of her Port, By what some others did report. 6 But who can tell aright her State? Forbid to humane Eyes. Of late I heard one of her nearest Servants Say, These bold Intruders sate without the Gate, Ignorant gazers, and did Stay For Almes, there given, everie Day. 7 Then, with the rest, why may not I, Talke of gay Sights and braverie, To make the world esteeme me wise and brave? But I am Conscious, and well-pleas'd to see The greatest Priviledge I have, An equall Man, an Earth-borne Slave. ODE XLVII. [Be not too Zealous. I, ere this, have seene] 1 Be not too Zealous. I, ere this, have seene A Pangve as hot, a votarie as keene, Dye in its height of Flame; Where everie word has beene A Panegericke; all Addresses came To Celebrate the Glorie of one name. 2 A Qvill, inspiréd with noe vulgar heat, Made great in Numbers; in his ayme more great; Supported in his choice; And honoréd to meete Acceptance, in a Patron; now in noyse Of the litigious Rout, has lost his voice. 3 His Zeale is now noe more. His frequent vowes Are all forgott. The honour of his browes, His Laurel, witheréd; His Qvill, perfidious, Dabbles in common Cisternes; ruinéd To his first vertue, calls backe what he sed. 4 And runs a-madding, with the vulgar Crew, Retracting his old Principles, for new And vndetermin'd things. Poor man! I sett to veiwe Thy common frailties, in his waverings. Be calme! for Passion tires, on her owne wings, 5 And falls in Dirt; a Spectacle of Scorne To other men. Be constant; but not borne With a blind violence, To stand noe more then turne, To the Suggestions of imperfect Sence: Who builds on Sands, has noe safe residence. ODE XLVIII. [Soe am I slav?d by Time] 1 Soe am I slav?d by Time, I modulate my Rhime, To the soft Liricke; though I rather Chuse, Had I the ancient Libertie, my Muse Has seen and knowne; To breath in bigger notes, and raise a Stile To the Heroicke Number; but my Qvill Is not my owne. 2 I once had to produce A wittnes, that my Muse Was noble in her Choice, and had a wing Worthy the Subiect; but, alas! I bring This to my Shame, My Poems are noe more, noe more to boast; For in the heape of Ruine they were lost, Lost, to my name. 3 Let me confesse a Truth; The honour of my Youth Was in those leaves; and if I had a Pride, It was in them, more then in All beside. And I may Say (Retaining modestie) they were not in The Common Ranke; few of this Age have bin Soe pure as they. 4 I would not be my owne Herald; but this is knowne To many of cleare Iudgment, who have bene Passionate in the losse. Pardon the keene And tender Zeale Of an indulgent Father; if it rise To Frensie, blame not water in my Eyes: It suits me well. 5 Abortives doe not lacke Their Tears; and dismall blacke Attends the Funerall; and may not I, Oblig?d, in a Paternall Pietie, To my best Child, Vtter a Truth vntax'd? Noe matter tho' Ignorance blatter Follie, it shall goe As it was Stil?d. 6 Sleepe in thy Ashes; live, Beyond all I could give; Live in thy Fate, and everie Eye shall pay Its Tribute to thy vrne, and sadlie Say, Here is interr'd A Father's Ioy; who cannot want a Teare From anie Eye, who sees this Sepulchre Which Ruin rear?d. 7 This Storie of thy Fate, These Tears shall vindicate; And yet I doubt not but againe to bring Numbers of weight, and mightie Epicks Sing; When Time shall raise Industrious Qvills to meritt. I, till then, Weare out my Time, with an vnsteddye Pen, A thousand waies. 8 My better Hopes here fixe, That I shall intermixe, One Day, when Peace againe our Feilds shall tread, Something of worth, for all the world to read. How farre the reach Of Poesie, enfranchis?d in her Ayme, May (iustlie warranted by vertue) claime! What high things teach! 9 Till when, my numméd Feet, In ragged Sockes, forget Those statelie measures; and contented, I Draw Slender Odes, to the varietie, Of Chance and Time. With these I please my selfe, and sing away My weight of Cares, to linger out the Day, In Liricke Rhime. ODE XLIX. [I am not limited to a precise] 1 I am not limited to a precise Number, in what I write; Nor curbe my owne delight Of Freedome, to be thought more formall wife. Nor doe I meerlie Strive To change; but take the next Which falls to Sence. The Live Formes of an honest text Seekes little to Illustrate its intent, And wrests in Nothing from the Argument. 2 Though in these Scattered Fancies I can boast Noe proper Treatise; for I catch at everie hower, And onlie glance at things; I am not lost To Studies of more weight; But Shadow out, by these, What I would chuse to write, Were I secure in Ease. And often touch the String I would Applye, Would Time allow, to its full Harmonye. 3 I cannot Subiect my Designe to Rhime; That is, I cannot fall Meerlie to Rhime, and all My notions hang to any certaine Chime; But to the nearest Sence I take a Number fitt, And hardlie, for pretence Of finer, loose my witt; For who that has his Passions subdu?d, Can bind his Reason to that Servitude? 4 Man (Lord of Langvage, great Distingvisher Of Forme, to what is fitt) Looseth, if he submitt To Custome, his Prerogative; may cleare All Scruple, and dispose Of them, by Edict, to What ever heele propose. They loose their title, who Necessite a Forme, or dwell in words; Soe are they vassalls made, who were borne Lords. 5 Some (who pretend to witt), (Some, I have knowne) Imagine all the height Of witt in the Conceipt Of formall Trifles; these are often Showne To common Eyes; who, for It pussles them, admire, And get a Copie; more To sooth, then to Desire Anything tasting witt. These frequent are, In this witt-venting Age, where none want Share. 6 How some racke all their Faculties, and Squeese The Iuice of all their Braine! In a fastidious Straine Of words, to pussle men; and can but please Them selves, with a thin Ayre. What trifle can wee name, Soe barren, or soe bare? Be it an Anagram, To stifle all the Life of common witt; But busies some Men to be proud in it? 7 Of these, not three I ever saw has hit Within the roade of Sence. Nay give 'em their pretence, The Latitude they aske. How below witt They Stand, I dare not Say; Lest I be challengéd Vncapable, that way. For I am soe indeed; And 'tis a Qvalitie I not admitt Within the Region of a noble witt. ODE L. [Oh! Doe not warrant Sin in your Applause.] 1 Oh! Doe not warrant Sin in your Applause. Indeed, I saw your Heart; And you abhorr?d the Face on't. Her witt was Beyond a woman's part; You hardlie had an Art To keepe backe blushes, Conscious in her Cause. 2 Fye! doe not Say you love that Spirrit in The Sex; your heart saies noe; You cannot valu?t as a Common Sin; It is a monster; though You would a vizard throw Vpon such Gestures, as more Masculine. 3 What Man but hates a woman bold and proud? The vertues which beseeme That Sex, and makes the few good, that are good; Are Silence, Disesteeme Of their owne witt, in them; And Modestie, where All is vnderstoode. 4 Such Petulancies as you would Contend Are pittifull; more then Prais-meriting (alas!) and you discend Below your Iudgement, when You did applaud it. Men Sometimes praise ill, where reproofe will not mend. Oh! Doe not Flatter Her, to her owne Sence; Custome will make her Errors Impudence. ODE LI. [The Coopéd Lion has broke through his Grate] 1 The Coopéd Lion has broke through his Grate, And forages abroad; Whilst frighted villagers of Danger prate, In their amazement woode. Consider, what Annoyance may succeed; Hee thirsts for Blood. 2 Soe doth the Ruffian, (fetteréd in the Brow Of awfull modestie) Pursue his Lusts, when women but allow Familiaritie. You hardly know What Mischeife followes, in his Libertie. 3 Make Short his Fetters, by your powerfull Eye, And keepe him yet a Slave; Chain?d by (your Beautie's Honour) Modestie; Your Tirrannie is Brave; Ladies, I doe not see How he can iniure you without your Leave. 4 For Modestie keeps still, inviolate, The Honour of a Name; And who dare presse vpon that prettye State Which Innocence doth frame? Noe Tongve dares prate To wrong your Honour or traduce your Fame. 5 Forgett the Fashion of the Times, and Chuse Waies proper to your Sex; Avoid those franticke Habits which abuse Your Creditts, and perplex You in the vse; For Fame, will strangelie Glosse vpon the Text. And 'tis too much Presumption of your Shame That you are falne, to be Iudg?d in Fame. ODE LII. [Ill suits that froward Scorne] 1 Ill suits that froward Scorne Your Sexe; I am not tyed To woman, in a Forme, Or a Face mortifyed; Though I confesse Some things are ornament, Some nothing lesse. 2 Your Silence doe not Change By vowel, to the worse; Be free, butt doe not range In the frequented Course, Of Appetite; And rather trust your vertue then your Witt. 3 Something within you knowes How to informe you best; Conforme your outward browes, Vnto your inward Brest; And then appeare, To informe Men, beyond all Character. ODE LIII. [Be not Deceiv?d; I know it by my owne] 1 Be not Deceiv?d; I know it by my owne: Great Bodies are great Burdens, and incline More to the Earth; participating in A larger Measure, what proportion Soever please your Sence; Bignes extenuates Its proper Faculties, with weights; And Smaller Bodies have more Excellence. 2 Like to the Servile Drudge, some noble man, Has plac?d in a great Castle; and you come To see the Building, and find everie Roome Vseles to Him; an end is All he can Manage; or some remote Parlour his Familye May comprehend; whilest others lye Vnswept till the States come, and wast and rott. 3 Soe am I, in my Selfe; whilst I admire Lesse Bodies, where a man is sett soe near In all his Parts, contracted, as it were, To a Conveniencie; and the Entire House he keeps warme and Full, With his owne proper Store; Each office, Hee, with Ease, lookes ore; And lives to vse it All; in noe Roome Dull. 4 Reallie, (it may be my owne Disgrace, But) I am Confident, wee bigger men Have Faculties lesse knitt, lesse able, then Weaker Appearances. I doe not praise Meer Littlenes, nor from All Larger derogate; But by my owne I see, and say't, I could Lye warmer in a lesser Roome. ODE LIV. [Soe flitts the trembling Needle round about] 1 Soe flitts the trembling Needle round about The Compasse, till it fall Into its lovéd North; soe clings vnto't, And will not move at all; Then with a Mutuall Force these Lovers meet, In a Magneticke Chaine. Strange Simpathie! and though wee doe not see't, 'Tis in our Selves as plaine. Nor let vs wonder why, The Attractive Power should fixe The Iron to its point; soe may wee vexe Our Selves perpetuallye. Rather see everie Creature pointing forth Its proper obiect, as this meets the North. 2 'Tis seene by everie Eye, in Common things, How apt and Eagerlie They ioyne themselves; Everie occasion brings Proofe to this Propertie. 'Tis not alone the Adamant can boast This strange Affinitie; Not Flowers, nor Trees, nor Birds, nor Beasts are lost; But Each, respectivelie, Have hidden Flames, and move By a strange innate Cause, To its cheife End; insensible what drawes Soe neare a tye of Love; But loose all Choice, and their Cheife Sence devour In the strange force of this magneticke Power. 3 These secret workings in all Bodies are; And All, at once, are mett In Man, whose motion, more irregular To all the points doth flitt; Yet as Affection's obiects still propose, Hee bends vnto the Point; And though he varie much, and oft, in those, Some Qvalitie of Constraint, Vrges him to incline, Hee knowes not how, nor why; But Hee must bend to that darke Simpathie, Which, yet vnseen, doth shine Vpon his Heart; and passionat'lie move Him to behold, or Seeke, desire, or Love. ODE LV. [Slip on, Sad Infants, of a groneing Time] 1 Slip on, Sad Infants, of a groneing Time, Till all your Sand be Spent; Poor Minutes! flye, And yet be innocent; Or man will Apprehend you to his Crime, And filthilye, Abuse you, to the lust of his intent. 2 Or might your carefull Mother rather ioy In an Abortive brood; Then have you live Gviltye of Tears and Blood In your first Light; and live but to destroy What you should give; Order, in all the Creature, as it Stood. 3 Rather pull in your fearfull Heads, and shrinke, Nameles, backe to her wombe, Then breath this Light; Let Chaos be a Tombe To close you, yet vnknowne; let Motion winke; And all the bright Glories of Day run backe from whence they come. 4 Ah man, vnhappie man! the Infant Day Peep?s with a blubber'd Eye, To looke vpon The Night's dire Tragedie; Sad for our Sins. The Night, in Darke dismay, Puts mourning on For our Day Crimes; more Sensible then wee. 5 How many Tears for vs fall everie night! Besides those of the Day. If Pittye faile, Terror might vs Affray; Correcting winds, and Thunder's horrid Light. But these availe Not man to Stop, one foot, in his owne way. ODE LVI. ['Tis not to make a Partie, or to ioyne] 1 'Tis not to make a Partie, or to ioyne With any Side, that I am what I am. All Faction I abhorre, all Sects disclaime; And meerly Love of Truth, vnto the Shyne Of Reason, which I have, Gvides me; for had I sought to other Ends, I could have bene as popular, as brave, And had as many freinds, To support all I vndertooke, as they, Who move beyond me now, and more display. 2 For Hee who setts a valew on his Heart, May what he lists Atcheive; I am as free To either Side, or Anie, as I see Truth to the Skale incline. I have noe part Beyond the Naturall Free vse of Reason; and I cannot bend To any blast of Time; nor Stoop, nor fall To a sinister End; But must encounter where my Reason gvides, The Puissance of Any, Either Side. 3 And I am fixt, but yet not rooted in Opinion, to the hazard of a haire. I am not limited to anie Square, But free to any better; I have bin, Perhaps, not ever thus; And am as Apt, if a Cleare Motive draw My Reason, yet to Change. I'me free to chuse, And doe not care a Straw How others Censure; for I must incline To Truth, as my Faith gvides, in her best Shine. 4 And as I stand, all Reason I yet know Warrants the Path I tread in; all I heare In controverted Causes, makes it cleare; For 'tis not Force of Argument can bow Mee to another forme; But a cleare Evidence of Truth, which must Shoot liveing raies, to qvicken and informe The Soule; and wee may trust Her secret workings. If wee loose this mind, She doth not faile to worke; but wee are blind. 5 How cleare I stand to Truth! and doe not breath To any purpose, if I let her goe; Had I ben Mercenarie, there was no Second respect, but stood to tempt my faith. I might have sitt vpon The wheele of Action, high and Eminent. I am not meerlie Dull; I could have done, By a safe President, As well as other Men; and had I made But that my End, it had bene noe ill trade. 6 Had Politicke respects invited mee, You cannot thinke I would have gon this way. I am derided; and you will not say, I can grow wealthy. Scorne and Povertie Attends each Step I tread; Yet am I fixt. I doe not value Life, Nor name, nor Fortune; neither am I led By a Demonstrative Rule in the Case; nor willinglie admitt Humane Devices, Subtletye of witt. 7 Though further be it from me to Affect That obstinacie, which I must confesse, Is not in nature void; that frowardnes Many assume, meerlye to contradict I am not in the List, Truth be my wittnes; but I looke on things With a cleare Eye, a Iudgment not possest; For preiudice still brings A Moat for Either; but I doe my part, To all I am; with a Clear single Heart. 8 If Single Love of Truth, if Innocence, If to neglect opinion, not to Strive For popular Applause; if to beleive, From principles which in themselves convince, Be to be factious; if To labour for an inward Peace, and Sitt A sad Spectator of the common greife; If to renounce my witt, And looke on Qviet meerlie, be a Crime! I am not wise Enough to observe the Time. ODE LVII. ['Tis noe new thing, but a worne Maxime in] 1 'Tis noe new thing, but a worne Maxime in The Schoole of Politickes; A Subtle opposition; wee have seene Many of these state trickes. Oh! 'tis the way to rise! And wee contemne all morall obstacles: Give me but Power, I looke at nothing else; I'me iust, and wise: Let the dull honest Christian labour in His Tracke of vertue; 'tis a Noble Sin. 2 Stay, whither am I gone? the Time's abuse Wee never made our Theame; The Misteries in State concerne not vs. Alas, I did but dreame. Mee, Innocence and Truth Gvide in cleare Paths, without all preiudice Or rancour. Fancie erring! how it flyes! And takes a growth, To a strange height. I should have ravill'd out A loome of this, had I not lookt into't. 3 Alas! our Sober numbers never knew To taxe men in their Crimes; Our Muse (vnapt to Censure) ever flew A pitch below the Times. Wee are vncapable To sound a Misterie, or dive into The ocean for a Pearle; a Peeble, too, Suits vs as well. These, yeild the common feilds: these wee may gather Without offence; and these, would I chuse rather. 4 Let me be free, though in a meane Estate; And live to vse my owne, Vnenvied in my Fortune; rather waite, Then meet a Ioy too soone; Direct and true in all My purposes; Safe in the brazen tower Of my owne brest; let Fortune laugh or loure, I cannot fall. Iealous of my owne Passions, free to Truth, And Sway?d by nothing, or to sleight, or Sooth. 5 But pleas?d in my retire, my Selfe survay, And Studie my owne Heart; Turne over a new leafe for everie Day, And many things impart, Which Common Sence and Eyes Oft see not. 'Tis a Speculation More pleasant then all else I yet have knowne; And Hee that tryes With a Discerning Light, shall weare the Spoyles Of a Selfe-Conquest, fitt to crowne his Toyles. 6 Then kicke the world, and all Selfe-Interest; Reiect all Hopes and Fears; Abandon humane witt; and doe not rest In the thin Characters, Of weake and emptie words. Beare vp and resigne all, to re-assume A greater Libertie. Oh! Let me come! My will accords To gaine that freedome; I will loose Each part Of Man, to see my Selfe, in my owne Heart. ODE LVIII. [Poore Man! I am as Dull as dull can be] Poore Man! I am as Dull as dull can be; Dull in my Selfe, with Sin; For Sin is heavie. I am darke within, And cannot see My selfe. Poor Man! a Cloud has Spred vpon My Soule, and I am lost; I am vndone. Huge vapour flyes Betwixt me and my selfe; all Light is gon. I am a Chaos growne: Rise! Sun of Glorie, yet at length arise! Dispell these Mists, that I, at once, may See My selfe, in my owne Heart; and All, in Thee. ODE LIX. [Not though wee keepe a Soft] 1 Not though wee keepe a Soft Low number; scorne to read our verse. Strong Pineons flye aloft, And haughtie Qvills high Things reherse. Mee better suits to Creepe, Then with Icarian winge, Contrive a scornéd Ruine. To the Cheape Ayre of opinion will I never Singe. I cannot weepe, Nor Laugh to Please; I can doe noe such Thinge. 2 Shall I soe farre Submitt My Reason, perhaps to one lesse? Or prostitute my witt, To a more Customarie Dresse? I am not borne a Slave; If Fortune worse contrive, Nature intended better. Yet I have Somewhat She cannot take, She did not give. There am I brave: A Monarch free, though I in fetters Live. 3 Ah! but I must resigne; For I am not my owne, to Say, Or Doe. Nothing of mine But I submitt, to the worne way Of Custome; I will write Full Panegerickes to Celebrate Iustice in our Age; make white Foule Crimes; and tell Posteritie, wee owe To those that fight Soe good a Cause, all wee can Say or Doe. 4 Yes, I will say it! and Put off my Nature, for a while; My witt, to anie hand Entrust; and sing, for a State Smile, Or potent Countenance! 'Tis wisedome to forgett, Sometimes, our Interests; wise men make Chance A Deitie. 'Tis madnes to love witt; May disadvance A further reach; I'me taught; and I submitt. 5 Were I an Atome, in The Age's Glasse, I must run free, Or stop the passage. Men Are Sands, and run Successivelie, Each in his way and Place. If any make a Stop, The rest want Motion; Each graine, to the Masse Contributes, to the consummating vp Of the full Glasse; And, as the lowest Slide, soe sinkes the Toppe. 6 But thus I trifle out, In weake Surmises, all my Inke; And loose my better thought, Whilest I of Time, or customes thinke. My Numbers not Enthrall?d, I will noe longer Span, By that vncertaine Measure; I have fail'd And let some better Liricke, if he can, Prove it Entail?d, From Theban Lire, and Sweet Dircean Swan. Goe from me now, for many Daies; perchance Ere I expect, my Qvill and I may meet On safer Termes, with Honour to advance Raptures of wonder, to the Royall Seat. Goe from me far, till then; which if my Song Erre not with Time, shall not be absent Long. Deare Muses, wee must part; yet let me give A verse to Time, in charge of my Desire. Noe hand, if I am Dead, and these shall live, Iniure a Line, or word, I you require. Enioy with Freedome, all your owne conceit, Let mine not be infring'd, but Equall Great: For Poets sometimes Fancies bring, When Readers nothing can discerne; And they, perhaps, may find something Shall sett him, in his owne, to learne. And, happilie, a hidden Flame Of Honour rests, which never came Within the Reach of Either; yet more true Then both, to Iudgement. Neither I nor You Must Iudge our owne. Adieu. The Ende. A Postscript. These Poems are the onlie remaining Testimonie of some howers which the Author gave vp to the muses; many others from the same Pen, of more consideration, are lost. Hee invites noe man to the expence of his monie or Time, vpon these Fragments; which were intended not to the publike Eye, but his owne retired Fancies, to make Light that burthen which some grone vnder; and had not the request of an endeared Freind prevailed, they had not Exceeded his intention; nor the world (perhaps) in anie Sence pittyed Him. Iuly 17, 1647. FURTHER POEMS. To Mr. Ogilby: Vpon his Accurate Translation of incomparable Virgil. Bee it without offence, that I may give My humble Verse, with Virgil's name to live; My verse, which but in Northerne Groves yet sung, (Cold as the Climate) falters on the Tongve. Those who enrichéd are with brighter flame, May Sing a louder Note; I have noe Name, Nor facultie in Numbers, but what Sad Thoughts now may vrge, within a private Shade. Yet, may I say, I was not borne soe dull, Nor soe Disloyall am; Soe without Soule; But if my hand be calléd, by this Prince Of Poets, 'Tis my Witt's Allegiance. For be Hee Rebel ever to the Chaire Of Sacred Muses, who can see appeare His Maister, (long an Exulate) come in, To claime his proper Right, and doth not bring His Hand t' assist, and Seat Him in his owne. All Langvage is but witt's Dominion; And Virgil doth as gloriouslye advance To Brittain's now, as to the Romans once. This to the Conduct of learn'd Ogilby Wee must Ascribe, who fix'd him happilye In his prædestin'd Chaire. Now Troians All, Wee know Æneas, and Him Father call. If I have err'd, S?; 'tis but to admire Virgil, as radiant in this Attire As in his Romane garbe; and (might I give Freely my owne) I thinke Hee did not Live Happie in English Letters, whose Swift fate Call'd, ere This Poet had attain'd This State. G. Daniel. June 29th, 1.6.4.9. The Author; Scriptorum chorus omnis, amat nemus, et fugit vrbe's. Thus calmly did the Antique Poets frame Felicitie, and gloried in the name Of Grove-frequenters; thus old Orpheus sate By fatall Hebrus, when his suddaine fate (Convai'd by franticke women) did Surprize Him, in the flight of Sacred Extasies. How much vnsafe is Solitude! what Ioye Has Groves or Cities? but Each Equallye Capable in Idea. Not the Lire Which Phebus strung (Phebus was Orpheus' Sire,) And gave it him, nor his owne verse, nor voice— Sweet as his Mother's—(for noe other choice Might ever equall't,) could at all deterre These possest Beldams, from the Massacre. That voice which taught disperséd Trees to move Into an orderlie and well-pitch'd Grove; Stopt headie Currents, and made them run sweet; Gave centred Rocks a Life, &amp; mountains feet; Not voice, nor Harpe, which brought againe to Life From Hell, Euridice, his ravisht wife; And did soe Charme Hell's treeple-headed Hound, Hee could not vse one tongve or tooth, to wound, Or wonder, at our Poet; what nor Hell Nor Furies durst Attempt, (I Shame to tell,) Women must Act; but Women none durst doe A crime soe impious, soe vnequall too; But Lust &amp; wine in women can produce Such monsters onlie; be it their excuse. The water (yet proud) Sings, (if Fame not Lye,) And runs to him, a Constant Elegie. Such was the fate of Orpheus.—Calme my verse And softer Numbers Spin, whilst I reherse Titirus sitting vnder Beechie Shade, Pleasing his Fancie, in the Ioy he made. For soe he made it his; as what might want There to delight or please, his verse did plant. Here, oft (more pleas'd then in Augustus Shine) Hee did enioy himselfe, and here vntwine The Clewe he twisted there: thus Hee in groves. Next, see in-imitable Colin, moves Our Admiration; Hee, poore Swaine, in bare And thin-Set Shades did Sing; whil'st (ah) noe care Was had of all his Numbers; numbers which Had they bene sung of old, who knowes how rich A Fame had Crown'd him? Had he livéd when. Phillip's Great Son (that prodigie of men) Spread like Aurora in the Easterne light; Hee had not wish'd a Homer for to write His Storie; but ev'n Peleus' Son had sate A step below in Fame as well as Fate. But Hee, poor Man! in an vngratefull Age Neglected liv?d; still borne downe by the Rage Of Ignorance. For 'tis an Easier Thing To make Trees Leape, and Stones selfe-burthens bring (As once Amphion to the walls of Thæbes,) Then Stop the giddie Clamouring of Plebs; Hee poorlie Dyéd, (but vertue cannot Dye) And scarce had got a Bed, in Death to lye; Had not a noble Heroe made a Roome, Hee'd bene an Epitaph without a Tombe. For that Hee could not want, whilst verse or witt Could move a wing, they'd bene oblig?d to it; Or Say, the bankrupt Age could none Afford: Hee left a Stocke sufficient, on Record. Let me, then, vnder my owne Shades content, Admire their Flights. Hee who lives Innocent Is wise Enough. Where Innocence and Witt Combine, what wonders in that brest are mett? The Trumpet's Clangor, nor the ratling drum, Noises of warre, nor the more troublesome Rage of the Souldier, nor the Golden Spundge, Where Harpies licke the Iuice, nor all the plundge Of Apprehension; shakes or enters on The temper of that true Complexion. Vertue is ever Safe, and wee may See Loyaltie prizéd, and depress'd Maiestie Enthron?d, as glorious as wee whilome have. These, wee may see; if not, the well-met grave Will shew vs more. Hee who considers that A Losse, is ignorant to value Fate. Bring out the Engine quicklie, to vndoe The Partie; triumph in the overthrow Of Truth and Iustice. You the seamles Coat Have torne; and dipt the Fleece without a Spott, In Cisternes of Profanesse. Ring the Bells! Y'have done, y'have done the worke. Hee happie dwells, Who more remote may looke vpon the Age As his owne Mirror, and applye the Rage Of Tumults to his Passions; Rebells all To monarch Reason. These things when I call Vnto my private, then I easilie See Monarchs are Men; each Man's one Monarchie. Phlegme, my Complexion, here has plung?d me in A Qvick-sand, to disorder the Designe Of my first Thoughts; and all what I have said Is but a Ramble, from a Running head: Perhaps a Rheugme. For 'tis vnnaturall In the most Sangvine, nere to run at All. Who knowes Witt, knowes somewhat of Madnes Still (Distempers not, but) tempers the best Qvill. Man in his little world, is more, by much, Then the great world; who knowes Him, knowes him Such; A Composition of the same mixt Stuffe, Which who can temper but is Wise Enough. 1.6.4.7. [Portrait of the Author.] ? nobis placeant, ante omnia Silva. Wee are deceiv?d, and Francie is not fitt To frame a happines, nor humane witt To Iudge at all. You looke vpon Mee now Retir?d and Calme, and thinke (perhaps) I doe Enioy all you Imagine; that I, here, Nothing of Earth doe hope, &amp; much lesse feare: That Noise and Busines doe not press vpon My thoughts; but thus compos?d, I'me All my own; That I Philosophise, or Something higher, Which Wise men Envie, and which fooles admire; And Scorne, or Pitty, Equall Natures, who Run the tumultuous Gire of humane woe. I must be free; that Shade has nought of Coole, Nor the Ayre pleasure, to a greivéd Soule; The purling Streame, w??: you imagine may Wash my Feet, cannot wash my Cares away; My mantle is not weather-proofe; yet farre Safer than my owne Resolutions are. All the varietie of this Retire Is nothing to vnsatisfyed Desire. Something wee would arrive at; but wee All Trifle in Dust to Dotage; and but call Things by the Name our Fancie makes appeare; Which if it be Soe, I am HAPPYE here. ???????????

Apud Brantingham: An Ecloge Spoken by Amintas and Strephon. ? nec erubuit Silvas, habitare Thalia. AMINTAS. And why, my Strephon, are thy Thoughts soe wed To the dull Country? whose free Lustie-hed Might challenge higher place to raise thy Name; Leave it, for shame; and wanton on the Thame. STREPHON. 'Tis well, Amintas; wherein were I more Or good, or happie, then I was before? I doe admire your Thames; but let my mind And bodie to the Countrie be confin'd. Here safelie can I sitt vnder a Hill, Tending my flocke, and take my Pipe, at will; My Pipe, which pleases me, and gives to none Matter of grudge or Emulation. AMINTAS. Alas! that matters not; what thing can be (If it deserve soe much) from Envie free? Envie (Selfe-poison) hurts the brest from whence It doth proceed; Wee gaine fresh Courage thence. What best, but Envy strikes it? Envy brings Her Bodie,—Toade; but Eagle, Eye and Wings; Aymes at the highest, fixeth on the Sun: Give me a Verse, for Emulation. STREPHON. 'Tis true; but yet it better pleaseth Mee To sing in Shades, from Spight and Envy free; Not that I feare the Monster; I despise Her Spurious Bratts, Slander and Calumnies; But (my Amintas) I desire to rest Private at Home, in a poor Qviet blest. AMINTAS. Ah, doe not say soe; thou art then ingrate Not more to Nature then thou art to fate. Why should not what Heaven gives (a gift devine; And given to vse) in a full glorie shine? See to the City once againe, and trye (If a meere doltishnes not bleare thy Eye,) What odds!—Oh, heaven! let me be patient, In all things but this Madnes—if Content Be in abundant Pleasures; if the Springe Want Sweet in Yours, to what our Autumnes bring; If to All this, and All wee can Adde more, (If there may be Addition to that Store Which Nature, prodigall, hath here layed out,) You put your Iudgment; let me never doubt, You can forsake the Citye to Converse With Earth and Iuments.— STREPHON. —Be not yet too feirce, My deare Amintas; though I doe admire To what you say, the Cittie, perhaps higher Then you have meant to; yet, I must be free To my owne private; for, felicitie Wee bound to our Conceptions; this you call Pleasure or Happines; which I doe fall To see our owne securitie; I more Value my want then what you 'count your Store; For I am rich, not you; though Gemms or Coyne I doe not boast; I need 'em not; all mine A narrow Roome contains— AMINTAS. —Narrow, indeed; I almost blush to feare my freind should reade Some punie Stoicism's; dear Strephon, give Thy nobler Nature wing to flye; and Live To that Intention. Wee converse with Men, Which setts new Edge on witt; the richest Pen Of fancie here finds Inke; the glorious Names Of Ionson, Beaumont, Fletcher, live with Thames, And shall outlive his waters. Had they crept In mudled remote Streams, their worth had slept; And those great Fancies which all men Admire Had flowen, but in the Smoake of their owne fire. 'Tis Fame gives Life; Iudgment gives Life to Fame; Iudgment moves here; then be noe longer Shame Vnto thy Genius; wast noe more thy witt With Hinds, whose palats cannot relish it. STREPHON. Had I what you are pleas'd to say; could I Flatter my Selfe into a facultie I love but have not; could I truelie boast A flame attendant to those names I most Admire; I should not seeke beyond the Sphere, I move in now. Are there noe Iudges here? 'Tis true, wee doe not stretch Hyperbolees To Crowne our Names, but give a modest praise. Modest is Iust; and if noe praise it gaine, Wee rest contented well, to Entertaine Our Selves with our owne Thoughts. Who writes to please Or get a Name, flyes lowe; yet some of these, Wee see how forc'd, are thrust vpon the Stage Of your great Theatre, where witts engage. Write what I will or where, 'tis but my owne, Perhaps my Shame, not worthy to be knowne; If more it merit, Fame and Time are Iust; Soe some are dead, Alive; Some Live in Dust. Must only names live with the nobler Streames? Are wee All tyed to the ingrossing Thames? Swans Sing in shallow waters. Avon, Trent, And Medway have bene heard. One Eminent To cope with its devourer, and, perchance, Poor Devia, fameles now, may yet Advance Something to memorie, and create some new Glorie vnto her Current; knowne by fewe. Soe to his native Mincius, Maro vowed His Qvill, though by Imperiall Tiber wooed. AMINTAS. Too much to blame; yet rather I'le perswade, Then chide from Error. Reason may invade Where Passion moves not. Doe you thinke the low Water which slides into the more fam'd Po, Or Po it Selfe, had bene enough to reare That verse which pleas'd the greatest Cæsar's Eare? That verse which Tiber claimes, more glorious Then Po, constellated Eridanus. Verses are Insects, which the common Sun Makes craule or flutter; but to move and run On steddie feet, needs a particular Influence: for such, our severall Poems are; Like nobler Creatures, from the Imperiall Eye Witt takes a growth, and getts full wings to flye; Whilst grosser heads bring forth their dunghill brood, Vnform'd, to dye againe, in Earth and mud. I wonder, Strephon, you, (who have a Mind Able to manage all you have design'd; Who know Great Things, and may arrive at more Then narrow Soules can fathome:) thus should Soare. With Kites and lazie Puttocks; when wee know You have a wing of Strength, might toure into The purest Region fancie breaths, and Scorne These Shamble-seeking birds. Wee can but mourne, Perswade, and pittye you. A man may speake Stronge Reason to himselfe, which seemes but weake Where it should worke; and sometimes it may fall, Where wee intend not wee move most of All. If what I spoke have moved! if, what I meant (For freinds, may often see a freind's intent,) Were Love and Zeale, (to have my Strephon live Worthy himselfe, and his Endeavours give A Sacrifise to Honour, or his Name Stand to all Time, in an vnblemisht Fame,) Hee will not blame Mee; let me read Consent To my perswasion, and thy owne Content. STREPHON. Doe you ioyne these as one? which I can never, But like the Poles, at vtmost distance Sever. If you perswade to see the Court, the Towne; Feast me with nothing, garnisht with my owne Content; you say A word, and perhaps All Your Selfe has found yet. Oh! why should I fall From the bright Region where I move and Live, To any lower flight? Court-glasses give False Light, and take the foolish bird (that dares At painted Shadowes,) often vnawares. The nobler Larke flyes high, himselfe to veiwe In the Celestiall Mirror, where all true Reflections are. Amintas, 'twere as good From fier, heat to sever, Life from blood, As ioy to mee, from what my selfe propose; A private Countrie Life. I blame not those Who (more Ambitious) Citties doe frequent; Bee it their Ioy; it were my punishment. I rather here with Silvia chuse to sitt, And Sing of harmles Love and Sober witt; Of Innocence, of Truth, of Peace, or what Calme fancie moves; then chatter to the rate Of my Lord's bountie; wildlie ramping downe Hideous Chimara's, to affright the moone. Did not, of old, Great Orpheus and the rest Of Citie-builders love the Countrie best? Soe through all Times; what is't they All admire? A mind and bodie sound, in safe retire. 'Tis true, there is noe ioy but to the Mind; You, yours in Citties; I, mine here doe find. AMINTAS. You are too bent, and I but pitty can The Losse of such a Mind, of such a Man; When happie Names shall fill the mouth of fame, Noe breath shall move to thee; but in thy name Dye, like a thing vnborne; thy verse may creepe To Chimneyes, or watch-women till they sleepe; Or please, when drinkings' done, the Countrie Squire; Who least can Iudge, though happilie Admire. This be thy fate, though farre below thy verse, Meriting better Author, better Ears. I could be Angry, but our freindship shall Not breake vpon the Circumstantiall Ayre of opinion. Cast yet backe an Eye Vnto the Cities full varietie; I pitty thy retire, and doubly greive, That thou wilt here, and I must from thee Live. I cannot move, fetteréd in the Eye Of bright Vrbana?'s powerfull Maiestie. Vrbana, She whose glories may envite Monarchs to wooe, and everie muse to write. STREPHON. Such Splendor might Astonish my weake Sence; My Silvia pleases me; her Innocence Is all her praise. Alas! She singlie sitts Vpon some humble Hillocke, and there fitts Grasse to her Strephon's browes; and, to make fine, Puts in a Dasie or an Eglantine; A Sprig of Mirtle, or, perhaps, a Rose, On festivalls; for wee observe still those: Though daies with you are Equall. These, though poore, Are high enough for him who seeks noe more. My deare Amintas, doe not thinke the bright Zenith of London carries onlye Light. Let Yorkshire have some ray from the great flame, Which warmes you there. What doe wee want to name, That you abound with, needfull? Perhaps more And better wee might bring, accounted poore. AMINTAS. Noe longer, Strephon: I have heard too much, And blame thee, partiall, to Compare or touch Our Southerne Ayre with Yorkshire clouds. What heat, But moves from vs to you? How weather-beat Your meadowes are! Your feilds halfe bare appeare; Your fruit-trees scarcelie bloome, when ours ripe here; Noe winter chills our Earth, when you lye bound Vnder the frozen Circle, or else drown'd In Swelling waters; such as might perswade A Second Deluge, 'gainst the promise made. STREPHON. Well, 'tis enough; yet looke vpon our feilds, As faire as yours; indeed our Season yeilds To you somewhat in Time; our loadned trees Beare equall Burthens; but noe more of these; These, the full hand of Providence has spred Largelie to all the Ile. Yet, if I did Waver in Choice, and tooke the whole Survay Of North and South, noe Countrie everie way More pleases me; and I am glad you fall To allow the Countrie pleasant is at all. Amintas, 'tis; (if humane nature can Arrive at what may make a happie man) The Summe of All; to enioy, without feare, What heaven layes out to blesse vs every yeare; In such abundance, such varietie, That were wee Blind to it, the Motts would see To praise the giver; were wee mute, the Stones Would sing to him; and All the Hills at once Leape like yonge Kidds. What need wee witt or Skill, When these informe our brains, and leade our Qvill, Beyond all Conversation? Men and Bookes But trouble Him who at the Creature lookes. AMINTAS. 'Tis a new doctrine, and perhaps may sound Well to your Selfe; but shall wee then be bound To frustrate Providence? Who made man fitt, Communicative; not like owles, to sitt And pore out day-light, in a silent Muse; They see the Creature, and their organs vse To praise this maker; and they know the end Of Nature, in themselves; and may extend Further then our Philosophie allowes, In Contemplation; for, Alas! who knowes? The Age is full of new; and to contend, In this, what boot, when Strephon is my freind? And being fix'd, I will not now dehort Thy setled Mind; but must be sorrie for't. Mayest thou enioy thy Thoughts; secure and free, Silvia; and if noe trouble, thinke of mee. Soe freinds may Live together, whilest I beare Thy memorie, and Muses equall Deare. STREPHON. Dearest Amintas, be thou happie in Vrbana?'s Love, whilst Silvia is mine; And when Vrbana shines in all her State, Prize not my Silvia at an vnder-rate Oh doe not thinke but She may be as faire, In nature's bounties, with vnborrowed haire; As wise, as happie, in an innocent Heart, As thine with all the Complements of Art. Wee, in our Selves, are Happie; Fate shall be Emulous of our Ioy; and when you see, From the scorch't South, our pleasures; then yow'l say Noe Life to this, noe Paire soe blest as They. AMINTAS. May it be soe; whilest in Vrbana?'s Lap I sing of thee; and let no hower escape To gratulate thy Ioye; which to my owne I shall prefer. Farewell: let me be knowne Worthy thy Verse; and sometimes daigne a Line To thy Amintas: Farewell.— STREPHON. What of mine Is worthy to record a Freind soe Deare? Soe much himselfe, yet to his Freind soe neare. Wee will not be devided; once again, Let me hope, oft weele meet; and entertaine Our Selves with what wee fancy, to the full Of all our Thought. Farewell: if I be dull 'Tis to leave thee. To thy Vrbana goe, Whilst I, with Silvia, my Time bestow. Maiest thou be happie ever; may what all Good wishes tend to, in thy bosome fall: At thy loved London, may thy Ashes lye; In Yorkeshire may I Live, in Yorkshire Dye. THE SONGE. Happie the Life of Sheapheard Swaine, Who lives in All contented; With his lov?d Phere, a vertuous Dame, From Scorne and Pride exempted. She spinns him russet for his weare, Whilst Hee, on downes is singing; 'Neath Mirtle Shade, by River cleare, The Eccho sweetlie ringing. Here, Cutt his Dog, vpon a Hill, Brings in the Sheepe that Straye; And with his Eye or hand, at will, The Curre doth him obeye. The Muses are his constant freinds, And Hee, doth sweetlie vse them, To his Delight, noe second End; His thoughts dare not abuse them. Thus all the Day, he spends his Time, Amongst his Equall Swains; Where Consort Sweet, they keep in Rhime, And intermingle Strains. At Even-tide, he homeward wends, And finds a loveing Wife; Most-equall-loveing-happie Freinds; Which crowns the Shepheard's Life. Happie in All, poore Shepheards are; At home, they Qviet sleepe; Abroad, they know nor Court nor Care; But Love and tend their Sheepe. Thus doe they Live, thus doe they dye, Belov?d of all their Peers; Who pay their last rites, Elegie, In their vnfaignéd Tears. Their Corps are Covered with green Peats, The place full sett with flowers; And then have Shepheards equall Seats, With Kings and Emperours. The End. An Ecloge: Spoken by Mælibeus and Dorilus. Pastorem ? pingves Pascere oportet oves, deductum dicere Carmen. MELIBEUS. The North lookes grisly blacke; our Ewes new-Shorne, Hast to the Covert of yond' thick-set Thorne; Presage of Storme: goe wee, while angrie clouds Threaten our flocks, into the well-made Shrouds Of the neare Grove. Lambs, sooner wise then wee, Have got the Hedge, and now stand Weather-free. DORILUS. Poore Innocents! who take noe further Care Then to prevent distemperatures of Ayre; Happie beyond our Envie; I have oft, Deare Melibæus, in a serious thought, Bene pleas'd to see our flocks, how gladlie they Live in their Nature, pleas'd (as wee may say) With Providence; and lesson to vs men, In their faint bleatings, precepts, which the pen Of Schooles is not soe cleare in. I can see More resignation, more humilitie, In this poore Lambe, and practise by Him, farre Beyond the highest Lectures that I heare. MELIBEUS. Ah Dorilus! 'tis Soe: our retchles Swains Are idle All, and have Lethargicke Brains; Nature inverted, Starts to see the Change; And man the onlie Ideot, in a Strange Posture of Dreaming. Whether tends this dull Stupiditie vnto? May wee not pull The Syllie-Hoe (which binds vp our best Eye From its deare obiect of Tranquillitye) Away? but tarrie Infants, in the wombe Of Ignorance, till it become our Tombe? DORILUS. Men are but Children ever; what wee know, Or what wee say wee know, wee doe not Soe; Wee may intend at Something, and arrive In Ken of the faire Port at which wee drive; But there the Sands immure vs. If wee seeke By force to tugge her in, wee either leake, (Fraile vessels can noe more) or hemm'd about, Wee're lost; not to get in, nor can get out. MELIBEUS. Wee seeke Destruction with a willing hast, And boast to be vndone. How madlie fast Wee run into Selfe-ruine! All our Pride Is to out-foole our Selves! Some few are tyed To the dull precepts of Antiquitie; I call 'em dull, as dull to them who see Not to the force, but trifle in the word; Which to the height they tend to but afford, A Glimpse of Light. Hee in a mist doth stray To Knowledge, who by words would find his way. Yet Somewhat must be Spoke; and much is said, By which the riper Intellect is made Able to know its obiect by the Sight; This but to few, though All pretend to Light. And bad men, in our bold Age, now dare boast New knowledges to vs; and bring the lost Exploded errors of all former Ages, Iustified, to the world, in their full Pages. Now, nothing from the peasant, Groome is heard, But Subtle Doubts, &amp; Selfe-sprung doctrines rear'd. Who has not heard lewd Blotos in a fitt, Defame All wee thinke Truth? And make it witt To laugh things Sacred into all Contempt; Not ev?n Divinitie itselfe exempt. Vnheard of Arrogance, to question All Wee move by, from our Earth's originall. The ranke Impieties of mortalls rise From burning Entrails, sulphurous Blasphemies; And to convince themselves they ever beare Their Hell with them, which they seem not to feare. Oh! the Anxietie of such a Soule! Beleive it, Dorilus, the Furies houle Still in that Bosome; all imagin'd fears And reall feinds, vnto that Eye appears; And though Hee (blushles false) seeme to perswade Nothing of Heaven or Hell, his Thoughts invade; Hee dare doe All, or neglect, as he List, Pietie or Profaneness; and persist Incorrigible; Laugh at all beside, The follie of the world; and his owne pride, Is Reason; Reason, God; Or what wee call Divinitie; and Hee to Himselfe is All. I tremble to repeat it; yet I've knowne Him Stupid in his fears, and oft, alone, Afrighted Start, and Stare, and broken Speake To the darke Goblins his owne fancies make; Yet still impenitent, had rather dye Rack'd by his fears and foule impietie, Then seeme to retract any of his will; Obstinate Miscreant to his Error still. These, the Contagion, not of families, But Commonwealths, and humane Policies; What Thought abhors not? Hammers to beat downe All bonds of Peace, of Love, Religion. DORILUS. These, Melibæus, now soe frequent are, Hee sitts a Dizzard to the world that dare Not impious be, and with a saucy taunt Affront Divinitie; as 't wer a want Of witt or Courage, not to be profane. Man should dare anything; Shall the inane Terrors of Death and Hell, the forgéd dreame Of Heaven, be made a bridle vnto them? I cannot, dare not, Speake, what even this Eare, From such foule Mouths, has gvilty bene to heare. Sence pleasing fallacies! But wherefore should Wee wander in these waies? Vnles wee could Reduce them stray'd; a Thing in vaine to trye: Leave we to speake what None can remedie. MELIBEUS. Leave wee't to Him who made and can restore All Hearts; Him, th' only Maker, to Adore. That obiect only worthy our desires, To whom noe Thought can reach; nor the Enquires Of humane Industrie can ever gaine; Leave it to Him. It fitts the humble Swaine Better to see himselfe, or Sing his owne Notion of things, or ravill out th' vnknowne Series of naturall Causes; and be free With fellow-Creatures. Here, can nothing be Obstructive to our faith; and if wee misse, 'Tis but in Iudgment, which no Error is. DORILUS. That, wee can scarce Allow; though it may hitt, Perhaps, with some new Meta-phisicke witt. Philosophie and Reason have their Sphœre, Though in a lower orbe, and Truth is there. A firme and setled Being doth not move Or floate with humane fancies, as they rove; Some thing is Truth; and though the diverse head Of man, from One, has manie seeming made; Wee may not grant; for then, might everie braine Boast its validitie, though nere soe vaine; And those strange Pseudo-doxal fancies be Which Maladolon gives Philosophie. Thinke not, by this, I to old principles Am meerly tyed, and blow away what else, By latter Qvills, has worthilie bene taught. Where pregnant proofes and Reasons have bene brought. To vindicate their Teachings, there I'me free, And at my owne Election left to be; Though 'twer a Thesis by the Stagerite Left as inviolable. If I might Put in my humble Iudgment, to the high Flyings of others in Philosophie; And give my Approbation, (though alas I know soe little, yet all Praise will pass). Lately, a noble Shepheard made appeare Philosophie, in Garments fitt to weare; Which I admire, and truelie must allow It weight and Current; though, perhaps, I know, The Schooles, and Some who would Schoole-learning vant, Explode it, false, defective, Arrogant. Truly, with those Heads shall I never ioyne; But kisse that honoréd Hand, in everie Line Of his elaborate Treatise, and confesse Hee has taught more to me, then I could gvesse By all I knew before— MELIBEUS. that learned Knight Has left a worke of price, worthy the Spight Of such an Ignorance as vndertooke To cavill it, and the most worthy Booke Now extant; where, me thinks, I read againe Man from his Principles, to perfect Man. But let such Impudence discover what Malice would doe, if 'twer within his fate; A Qvill soe low, soe yet vndipt, to cope With these well-mention'd worthyes. What mad Hope Could soe encourage Him! Ill may his Inke Run, to revile him. I dare hardlie thinke Madnes it selfe could hope to merit fame From such light Pasquills; if not with the name Of his great opposites Hee thought to find Some soon-caught Reader, for their Sakes, soe kind. DORILUS. You can be bitter; as indeed, I blame Not much your Zeale to vindicate the name Of honour, from the Envious breath of those Who detract Truth, and run with Saucie Nose To everie neighbour feast; and gather All The Qvelq-chose or the Scraps, which are let fall Perhaps to that End. Give the Curre a bit Or bone, to stay his Canine Appetite. But, Melibæus, Some, who would appeare Sober and Solid, iudge that Booke, I heare, And passe it, in a Character, which sounds Frightfull to Sence; and weaker Iudgment wounds. MELIBEUS. Some, who put on grave Browes, have shallow Brains; Whose face, their Stocke of wisedome still maintains. These are Austere, and put a sullen brow Of Censure to all freedome they not know; Seeme startled (they confin'd) at fuller ayres, Which from Enlargéd Minds expression bears: Where, to name Providence, were to denie Our faith, and raise some heathen Deitie. Though higher Soules, full with Cœlestiall fruits, See God and know Him by his Attributes. Love, Peace, Truth, Light, and Fire; (expressions, which Hee daigns;) to them, sounds nothing but an itch And levitie in words; weake Soules may feare; And 'tis a vertue, in them, to forbeare. Though, doubtles, Some minds may expatiate With as much Innocence, to all the height Their Notions are made Capable: they, free In their owne Thoughts, may vse this Libertie. For still shall Man be foole? or soe much Slave To words? whose worth or weight, (if ought they have) Hee gives; and may not Hee vse to his owne Idea, the most apt expression? Some words are flat and low, and halt to bring Forth great intentions; want the relishing Which fluent Qvills and full Thoughts ever give; Somewhat beyond the words, which makes 'em Live. DORILUS. And in that Hee is Happie; all his Sence Soe poinant is, soe vnstrain'd his Eloquence, Hee steales vpon the Soule, and apts the Mind To all the Proiect which he has design'd; His words are soe Himselfe; so everie man That will but speake Himselfe; as nothing can Be clearer to an Eye not meerlie led By its owne Meteors. Let the swimming Head Floate in a Sea of Phlegme, whilst Knowledge towers, With wings vncurb'd, to ioyne with its great Source; There lives a flame combin'd, never to fall, Made one, whence first it had originall. How diversly the mind of Man may frame Its owne Beatitude, vnder the Name Of Knowledge! Each, within himselfe possest, Hee has the ray, still liveing in his brest. And sure Each has Enough to his owne End; What Providence did equallie intend, Nature, ill organized, may faile to spread; Or parts, by Accident enfeebled, May hinder it, to the exterior Sence: But in its Light, its Seat of Excellence, The Soule is cleare and perfect; when wee shall Move Intellects meere in-organicall. MELIBEUS. What Strange wild Paradoxes, humane Witt Oft teem's with! and dare boldlie vtter it, Strong Reason! Doe you thinke that all Soules be Equall in their first Cause? or Equallie Move to the End? Are vessels of one Size, Or in proportion? or in dignities? And but the interposure of our flesh, Doth difference, to make it more or lesse, Active or cleare? Pardon, if I dissent, Or if I say 'tis not yet evident, This Same-proportion; though the Arteries, And organizéd flesh may faculties Perhaps obstruct; or sometimes mure the way, Where Reason should make Sallye. But you say All minds are forméd Equall, and that All Shall equall move, One with th' originall. I doe beleive and know the flesh a weight; And duller organs hinder the great flight Our vnderstanding tends to, that Wee now Not apprehend the least, what wee shall know. And ev'n that Mind which wee see drench't in mire, Shall looke at Glorie, freed from its attire Of Earth; but with a differencéd Light To those, who liveing saw that flame more bright. Else, to the Ideot better portion falls Then to the wise; and what all Wisedome calls A Blessing, is not soe; but soe much worse; A Torture, a Disease, perhaps a Curse. DORILUS. I cannot yet retract: my Reason must Vse her owne wing, in this, rather then trust The borrowed feathers from another's braine; And what I have said once, must speake againe. Soules equall are, and Equallye doe move, In Glorie, to the height of Knowledge, Love. This, if it be a Paradox to you, I blame not; to my Iudgment it sounds true; And truelie, could wee speake our owne thoughts cleare, Or make full-form'd Conceptions appeare To others in the Light to vs they Stand, Wee should not differ; for wee vnderstand Things now by halfes, and hardlie see the End Propos'd, or whether the Discourses tend; Things in their Causes hid, and set beyond The vtmost fathome of the extended Mind; Noe wonder if in words they darke appeare, Hard to Another's Intellect and Eare. For, what wee know and See, what Sence perswades Is not well ever told; how lesse, the Shades Of our Imaginations sett to veiwe? How least, of faith? which noe man ever knew, Or could display, beyond the fixéd Light Resident in him; to informe his Spright. The brightest Notions which our Reason heav's From Fancie's hindge, imperfectlie wee leave To the then forme of words; the beautie rests Still hid, perhaps; but what, to our owne brests Was borne within vs, pleases still the mind; Though hearers nought of Satisfaction find. But, Melibæus, see, the Storme is ore, Our flocks now fall to feeding, as before; Cease wee of this, till further time; and keepe Committed trust; Love wee, and tend our Sheepe. MELIBEUS. The great Cloud breaks, and Titan, with his ray Obliquelie glanc'd, seems to revive the day; A merrie wind whistles through all the Grove, And clears the Ayre; the welkin Smiles above; Our glad flocks Spread the Hill; the Lambs, made bold In warmer Ayre, forget the Storme and Cold. DORILUS. Then goe wee to the Hill, and lead 'em out To fresher Herbage, ere the evening Shutt: The Sun declines, to lave his fierie Carr In westerne Seas, and rouse the Evening Starr. Shepheard, applie thy Pipe, whilst Sober Layes Begvile our Steps, in these oft-trodden waies. THE SONGE. Welcome to Shepheards, Shades of night; As welcome as the more-prais'd Light; And thou pale Taper, whose weake ray Calme thoughts delight in, more then day; Now Sober fancie takes her flight, Welcome to Shepherds, Shades of night. Drye braines burne out the glorious Day, In weake and emptie fumes away; But high and Contemplative Soules Can find a Light beneath the Poles; And with firme feathers rise to see That Light which makes the Sun to bee. Day is not cleare nor Night obscure, But to the Mind, bright or impure; They raise but Shadowes of distrust To gvilty thoughts of fears vniust; Innocence safely treads her way, In blackest night as brightest Day. The End. An Ecloge: Spoken by Halon and Eudœmon At madidus Baccho sua festa Palilia pastor Concinet. Tibb: 2 lib: Eleg: 5: 100. li. HALON. The rageing wolfe, which made our flocks his Prey, Hath bled his Last; Eudœmon, yesterday Five iolly Swains, with dogs to that End bred, Hunted him ore the Hills, with eager Speed; Though Long, at last he fell; noe longer wee Need feare our foldes should broke or frighted bee. EUDŒMON. Ill fitts that word the mouth of any Swaine; Are wee secure because the wolfe is Slaine? There may be moe; or were there none but Hee, What Spell have wee from foxes to be free? Are not our Lambs to Badgers yet a prey, Perhaps were we but Absent halfe a day? Noe, Halon, were these all remov?d, the Swaine That loves his flocke doth still his care retaine. HALON. 'Tis an vnnecessarie precept, wee Derive from worne Leavs of Antiquitie; But wiser Shepheards now have better Taught; Danger remov?d, why should wee care for Naught? Wee loose our Selves in a perpetuall Toyle, And are made Slaves to what's not worth the while. EUDŒMON, Fye, Halon, doe not say soe; if you knew The value of your Chardge, or had the true Vsing of flockes, which everie Shepheard ought; It were a Care, ev?n worthy all your Thought. But (ah) the Libertie of this leud Age Spreads as a deluge, even to engage All in the Gulph; and newer pleasures now Shepheards enthrall, which Shepheards did not know. The Simple Merrie-make of older Swains Was Innocent, and rurall Entertains Had noe ill-meanings. Halon, I have bene In either Age, and both their Customes seene. HALON. Eudœmon, noe; your Age of lesse then mine May speake, for time; and may my best Ramme pine, If ere I knew it otherwise then now, Good frolicke Sportings vs?d; alas, I know Our carefull Sires would tell a Time of old, When all was good; such as Eudœmon would Now fancie to himselfe; but, Swaine, I know Thow think'st the times were ever as they're now. EUDŒMON. Indeed! I thinke our fancies doe gvild ore, Somewhat, the face of Ages gon before; But certaine, Halon, better then wee now Live in to see, your selfe and I did know. HALON. To me, 'twas ever thus; but I not came To talke of Times or Customes; they're the Same. My errand was my first; tomorrow shall A day of Mirth be kept. Eudœmon, All Expect your Companie; the rest did make Mee now their Messenger, to come and Speake. EUDŒMON. Though, Halon, noe man then my Selfe, more Ioyes At others Happines, or in this prize, The luckie Swains brought home; I must refuse To meet, to-morrow: Carrie my Excuse. HALON. Excuse you! now I doubt ther's something more Troubles Eudœmon, then I thought before. Are wee not All Concern'd? You must appeare; You will be thought on stranglie, if not there. EUDŒMON. Noe: they will pardon it.— HALON. Noe pardon can Fall vnto such a Crime. Eudœmon, man, Whither away! How art thou dully Lost From thy once Selfe, and what thou lovedst most? Not meet! Wee must be merry; Cups shall Crowne Our Ioyes, and make the Conquest full our owne. 'Tis not a Life, our Dayes wee but vntwine; Save Time a Labour, and our Genius pine In Silent Musings, to noe good, which wee Our Selves intend, or other Men can See. Societie! the Best of All, our Boast; Without which, Life it Selfe were not ill-Lost. What need I more perswade? To Him who once Could bring a Thousand motives to advance Designes of Drinking; which, forsooth wee Name Modestlie, meetings. Fye vpon this Shame! EUDŒMON. Why, Halon, thou art almost rapt to thinke Of this great meeting. Let them goe to drinke, Whose Last night's Surfet call fresh Cups, t' allay The Stomacke-Stretchings of the former Day; I am resolv?d: for, Halon, I have seene Enough of Madnes; and too often bene A franticke Actor in the foolish rites Of bloat-fac'd Bacchus; now noe more delights But Tortures to my Thought; to see how deepe My better part was shrunke into the heape Of follie and forgetfullnes.— HALON. —And now A Satire feirce! How long? I prithee, how Many, or dayes or howres? For weekes! who can (That has a Throat,) one Single weeke abstaine? How long hast thou pin'd in this dolefull plight Of Sobernes? Or how long shall wee see't Continue? Dearest, tell me, some fond vow! And limited, I warrent! Faith say how. EUDŒMON. Noe vow it is, nor yet a vulgar Tye, Made ore a Posset, for the Maladie Of many Cups; nor a Conversion, made From Crop-Sicke Qvalms or Giddines of Head; But a well-made Resolve; which Dayes nor Howers, (But Time alone when Hee my Selfe devours) Shall ever forfeit. Prithee, Halon, tell The ioy thou takest (for thou lovest Drinking well) In the strange Swilling of vnnumbred Cups? By whole-Sale Flaggons, or retailing Supps! What is the End to which your proiects drive? To make you Longer, Merrier, Better Live? For one or All of these I cannot see (Soe sordid now doth it appeare to me,) What any man can Say; I have forgot What 't was my Selfe would Say, when I, a Sott, Durst vindicate my ill-spent howers; or please My fancy in such franticke mirths as these. HALON. Holla, Eudœmon! Yet I hope to see Your reconversion for Cup-Libertie; Which I prefer as Conscience; and had rather Then seale vp Lips, they'd Sowe my Soule together. I recke not what they make of forme or faith; Nor would I be a Martir, vnles death Were to be drunke; in that, let Law be free, And make Religion what they list, for mee. EUDŒMON. Indeed, such expectations, such desires May fitlie suite; how happie are the fires Which Sober Fancie kindles in y? Mind! How strange these Fumes appeare! of wine and wind! HALON. Yet, let my little Reason,—for in troth I doe not boast of much; I should be loath To vse it, if I had, as words, ill Spent T' enforce this All-convincing Argument: Let me, (I say) perswade a little; once Pledge a full Glasse; suppose it may advance The Health of him wee honour; to denie Such a Request were want of Loyaltie; To morrow, This the widest Goblet swells; Such as refuse it, meerlie Infidells, Can hardlie hope Salvation; not vnlesse They fill three bigger, and their Zeale expresse To Mirabella; or, with bended knee, Swoope of a vessel bigger then all three. To our bright Hopes, the riseing Shepheard's Starre, What Loyall Heart can drinking these forbeare? And here the frolicke seems but to begin; Our Mistresses are call'd, and they come in; Number the letters in her name, by Boules; Old Martial lives againe; Wee have our rules, And keepe a due Decorum; firéd thus, Each Brain becomes his proper Pegasus. EUDŒMON. Poor Halon, how I pitty thee; and then, Your reeling God is Chariot-drawne, by Men Transform'd to Tigers, and to Panthers; bruit, As ounce, or Pard'; and well the Chariot Suit. The Women in the house, (for women must Still close the Draught; wine ever ends in Lust,) Like yauling Mœnades, their Ioo?s send To the full-fraught, lest drinking there should End. There my once sung Nicotiana keeps Still the hearth warme, till panch-swolne Bromius sleeps; And her Health-giveing odours madlie wasts, To scalded palats, who have lost their tasts. Iocosa there, the light-heel'd giddie Dame, Must be another, or your mirth were Lame. Poore drenched, drowned Soules; hardly to hope That Eye (drinke-closéd still) can ever ope. Have you said All, Halon? or you intend Another Panegyricke? I attend; For Since I was my selfe, I dare let out My Ears to any thinge, yet keepe my Thought. HALON. Eudœmon, you mistake; the frantick rites Of Bacchus were soe kept, in the dull nights Of Ignorance; but drinking now, emprov?d, Is growne an Art: and orgies, which behoov'd A Thing soe necessarie, added are; The old Abolisht and the new made cleare. Fitt Ceremonies vsed, of Cap &amp; knee, That drinking now devotion seems to be; Whilst (a new rite) Nicotiana's bound, From purgéd Censers, to throw incense round; Spreading her roabes, like many-folded Skyes, Whilst all men busie are to sacrifize Vnto the Ivie-crown'd; and wishes breath Vpon his Altars, to bring Life or Death; Courage and Witt, inspir'd by hidden means, From his bright Flame, the Head and Heart attains. Nothing soe difficult, or soe abstruse Can be to Man, but easie is to vs; And all the Subtle Knotts, which crabbéd Heads Have twist, fall loose before vs into threds; The Heavens make all things hard to thirsty Soules, And only wine, encroaching Care controules. EUDŒMON. Soe the mad Roman, who to make more fine His Platan Trees, drencht them in Shewers of wine; Or as the late-past Summer, whose excesse Of wett ruin'd those fruits calme deawes refresh; You soake your soules, and by too large a flood, Thistles and weeds grow, where the corne had Stood. I will not say but wine may sometimes adde Vnto the Genius of a Sober Head, In Cups not lavish, by the well-made vse Of Creatures, to that End, bestowed on vs; Yet would you say? for I dare safely heare All you can Adde of frenzy to this Eare; Vnmoved, I sitt happie now, to see My freedome to my fore-past vanitie; Now, now I move; as whilome, in the bud Of Innocence; and glide vpon the Flood Of Life, with Pleasure; noe rude Stormes affright My new-rigg'd vessel; noe distemper'd night Now tears my brains; noe morning penitence Belches the folly of my last offence; But when the morning Spreads her dewey wings, My Larke dare rise, to pay her offerings; For now I live, to vse my selfe, and find My Constitution to Health inclin'd; A constant Temper dwells within my blood, And I am all my owne, beyond the woo'd Temptations you can bring; I now, possest With calme Thoughts, boldly open all my brest: What hinders Sober man to speake his heart? And even the Secrets of his Soule, impart? But drunkards, certaine none dare impious be; They fatt themselves in their impietie, And dare with horrid Arrogance pronounce The glorie of their Sin; not wicked once, But leudlie boasting it from time to time, Make ev?n theire Many, one-continued Crime. I have bene gviltye, and he lives not free, Who sold to his owne Lust and Infamie, Dare goe a little further; ev?n from thence Cups come to Custome; Custome, Impudence. Let me abhorre the Stupor of this Sin; Which were enough, if nothing else came in, To make it hated to a Soule that loves Its owne felicitie, a mind that moves, Worthy of its Creation, in the Light Of Sober Reason, not bruit Appetite. HALON. These two, to me are one, or interchang'd, Either is other; by the fancie rang'd To the proportion and worth they seeme To carry, in our varied esteeme. What you in me call Appetite, Desire, Is all my Reason; I see nothing higher; That I submit to as my gviding Light, And call it Reason, you call Appetite. Whether shall wee appeale? the Iudgment binds But from the Selfe-Tribunall of our Minds. EUDŒMON. Such Taverne-teachings please the wine-sprung mind And giddie fancie roves about, to find Excuses and evasions, to secure Our dearling faults, though never soe impure. What profuse wast and profane wishes rend Immortall Ears! and sober minds offend In lavish Cups! noe memorie retaining Of what wee are; or ought of man remaining; The Soule surpris'd in all its faculties; Iudgment is Error; Witt, Velleities; The vnderstanding, nothing but a Thin Shadow of what wee once were happie in; All the prærogative which Nature gave Is swallowed in a Hogshead, now the grave Of that immortall fire, which might be knowne A Light to all the world, if kept our owne. HALON. Eudœmon, still you measure by the Square Of your owne fancie, and in Small-beer ayre Flutter with feeble wings; for who will thinke You can be witty, that have left to drinke? Bacchus, the great inspirer of our Soules Has thus decreed All Water-Drinkers fooles. 'Tis wine, the Ioy of Life, the Strength of witt, The fire of fancie, Edge of all Conceipt; And Hypocrene it Selfe is but a Tale To countenance dull Soules who drinke not Ale; Our Brittish Bacchus; the true fountaine which The Muses Love, and makes the fancie rich, The Horse-hoofe never rais'd; but humane heeles Make spring, when full-Swolne grapes their burthen feele; Here will I sip, and to the Sacred Hest Of Bacchus, offer with a gratefull brest, The Tribute due; for All I have or know, Or can desire, from his bright fountains flow. EUDŒMON. Dulnes it selfe might now ashaméd sitt, To vtter such a follie; and is witt Then drawne from Spiggots? or the Sacred flame Of Rapture, set a Candle, to the Steame Of drinke-washt tables. Let me rather pine Witles and water-drinking, then love wine, To make me seeme what I know I am lest, A Witt. Oh, heaven! how happie doe I rest, Free from the Clamour or Applause of such, Who cannot praise Witt, and yet praise too much. What things passe there for Witt! Scurrilitie Runs there; the Mirth and Iest, Impietie; Such heats I envie not. My water still Affords me Health, and gives a readie Qvill To vtter my free thoughts; though meanly clad, My Genius suits; to which wine cannot Adde. HALON. Eudœmon, these faint pleasures cannot fire, My Sangvine inclinations to desire The happines you speake on. I almost Misknow my selfe, to see how thou art lost. May not a Beard appeare but still to preach? I Apprehend it now, thou hopest to hatch The goodlie Egge of Temperance, within The full growne feathers of thy Cheekes and Chin; And it may prove a Chicke worth all thy Care. Keepe thy selfe warme with holines and Haire; I know a fitter raiment to my backe; The Misterie of all-Sufficing Sacke. EUDŒMON. Soe please thy follie-drenchéd Soule, to sitt In drinke still warme, and never-wanting witt; Nurse there a Sacke-sprung Basiliske, to slay The foole which foster'd it, another day; Then, all too late, the Ideot sees, his owne Glorie, his Shame; his Ioy, destruction. But trulie, Halon, if a Serious heart Be worthy to advise, in time depart From the bewitching Sottishnes of Sin. That Follie, of the rest, if words might win I could perswade; or if example might Informe another, I have done thee right. HALON. Dost hope I may be recreant to my first Dear principle of Drinking? I was nurst, I thinke, begot, with wine; on Nisa bred, And with the noble Bacchus fosteréd; Shall I then be Apostata to all My Education? Or the naturall Instincts still pressing? 'Tis a good dull way The posture you are in; but never may I live to tread it. 'Twas an ill begun Discourse of ours; for neither yet has won Vpon the other; though I am afraid Were not tomorrow next, thy words have made Some fond Impression. Deare Eudœmon, see, The Sun growes low; let not my coming be Meerlie in vaine; to morrow you will meet; And then thy Power, oh Bacchus! Let me see 't. EUDŒMON. Say to the Swains, Eudœmon is become Himselfe againe; and means to stay at home; Not Envie to the glorie of the preye, But stricter Resolutions make him Stay; For Hee, who such full meetings doth frequent; Though he be free, can scarce be Innocent. HALON. Morall Philosophie! Come, let vs goe Homeward apace; the night begins to grow Vpon that Hill, and spreads an Eager arme To involve vs all, by necessarie Charme. Yet let vs not walke Silent; give your Song, Eudœmon now, (or else you doe me wrong) To vindicate your absence; whilst I bring My verse to Bacchus; and his praises sing. EUDŒMON. Halon, if that be all, I dare excuse Retirement, with a warrantable Muse; Then lead wee out our flocks, and homeward wend, Whilst the refracted West some Lights yet lend. Eudœmon's Songe. 1 Goe to the Cristall Streame and quench thy thirst, Poor Shepheard, goe; And tast of Nature's bounties, which at first She intended Soe; This with noe raging fires, Intemperate Desires, Our brains doth fill; But calme and chast, as it is cold, Our fancies rise, in manifold Idea?s Still; And nothing wants to fitt a willing Qvill. 2 Witt is Enough, where wee have witt to see Our selves aright; And live a part of Nature's Harmonie, Is true delight. To value nought beyond A free and quiet mind; And make that ours, Is all wee happie call, or good; A Ioy some few have vnderstood, Whose abler powers Could maister flesh; a Ioy noe Time devours. 3 For Time is not within the Sphere of Peace, And Peace wee seeke; But fondlie shape a Coate the moone to please; So everie weeke Our obiect is a new Something wee never knew, But ayme at ever. Only retiréd thoughts may See The rayes of such felicitie; And by the giver Of All Peace, make his owne, if Hee persever. Halon's Songe. 1 Dull Shepheards, who in water, Seeke To wash your Shallow brains; Your fancyes, Phlegmaticke and weake, Run coldly in their Strains. Pittifull Poets! such as bring Their verses from the mountaine spring, And with false muses cozen Themselves into a trance, Of selfe-sought ignorance; Poor fooles, alas, your Helicon is frozen. 2 Wee, in a better Age, have found The true Pierian Spring; Which all the Muses circle round, And there delight to Sing. Here the plumpe God doth smiling sitt, The Light of Ioy, the Life of witt, And all true flame infuses; Had I but now, one boule, To rince my thirsty Soule, Ide rise in notes to ravish all the Muses. 3 Dear fountaine, Sacke, whose liveing Streame Sad Spirrits doth revive; Health to the Sicke, Strength to the Lame, Doth in an instant give; Can Ideots with witt inspire, And carrie witt three Stories higher Then what it ever aymed! This be the liveing Well To make all fancye Swell, The Source of Witt, weele have noe other named. The End. An Ecloge: Spoken by Damon and Amintas. Non canimus Surdis, respondent omnia Silvæ. DAMON. Amintas! (who our northerne feilds makest proud; Whose Eye, then Phœbus more prevents that cloud, Now, from the Southeast threatning,) ah, how long? How many Summers since thy glorious Songe Our Ayre enricht! growne foggie, since the time Strephon contending, in an humble Rhime, His Silvia prais'd, to thy Vrbana?'s Eyes. Deare Shepheard, now, (if our Societies Seeme not vnworthy thee) that pipe assaye, Which has made Short ev?n the Longest Daye. AMINTAS. Damon, that Pipe is broke, and Numbers now Amintas can noe more; my Braine and Brow Is but one Cloud; if, Damon, I may heare Thy better Notes, I lend a willing Eare. DAMON. My deare Amintas, Say what may it be, (If a freind may partake) that troubles thee? Are thy flockes faint? or doth Alexis faile In freindships to thee? or (more Sad then All) Is thy Vrbana false? a feare I durst Scarce feare! but Love is Apt to feare the worst. Say, Shepheard, to thy freind, what Torture may Soe scorch thy Soule, to wash thy Eyes away. AMINTAS. If, Damon, my weake Spirrits may not beare Soe great a Burthen, doe not blame a Teare; Your feare, alas, is but too safe, too Iust; Vrbana is,—is false, and strangelie Lost To her first vowes; a prostitute or more, To the Grand Paillard, proud to be his whore. This but a part, though, ah! too much by this; The rest I cannot Speake; for, Damon, 'tis Soe beyond wonder, such a Prodigie, It starts a Horror, everie Thought in Mee. DAMON. May it not Adde Affliction, to lay out All thy mishap, my deare Amintas doe't; Whilest I, with open Ears, thy Sorrowes gather Into my brest; wee better suit together; Let me (at lest in this) thy Rivall prove; 'Tis fitt, hee Share thy greife, whom thou dost Love. AMINTAS. The Storie's Long and Sad, but may Appeare Perhaps, not tedious to a tender Eare: You, Damon, are concern'd; your Loyaltie Makes you a partner in the miserie; And the strict tye of freindship 'twixt vs two Emboldens me to vtter what I know. Thus then it is; our folds and flocks, whileere To Pan made Sacred; and his Steward here, Next vnder Him wee honour; and noe knee But vnto him did bend in fealtie; His Ivorie Hooke; (made glorious by his Hand) More then a Scepter, shinéd ore the Lande; And wee inferiour Swains were taught to bring Our Tribute-Lambes, and our fleece-offering To this Great Shepherd; part of the increase Which Hee preserv?d soe many yeare in Peace; This was: but, Damon! now, wee may noe more Performe or paye the Duties vs'd to fore. DAMON. Is Pietie a Sin? or Loyaltie Now made a Crime? vnriddle it to mee; For since I can remember, I was taught To honour the Great Shepheard; and have brought My frequent Tributes, with a willing Hand; Who now soe bold, dare his iust rights withstand? AMINTAS. Ah Damon! latelie to another, Hee Imparted Somewhat of his Roialtie; A Cozen of the Blood, of Sex vnfitt For Soveraigntie; yet Hee allow'd her Sitt Next to his Throne; vnheeding what, too Late Hee now repents; her ill-bestowéd State. For when She now, by favour of his Eye, Seem'd to the world a part of maiestie; The giddie Heads who still delight in Change, Fixe vpon Her the Light, and put a Strange Glorie vpon Her; yet, it was but Ayre And her owne Pride, made her appeare so faire; For all the Nobler Shepherds were afraid Her Rule might ruine what the other made; Still our Great Shepherd, to him selfe Secure, Is pleas'd with new Addresses made vnto Her: From everie corner of this Iland flye Papers, to establish her yonge Maiestie; Hee, all the while remisse, is well content To see how she can manage Government; Lull?d by her Sugred Sayings and the oft Repeated vowes, which (ah) She never thought; Hee from his owne Hand gives his Ivorie hooke, Which even His Father and Himselfe had tooke Of Pan, with Solemne vow; and now begins Proud Zephirina to augment her Sins; For what She only wisht, and durst not Act, Power gives her Right, and Iustifyes the fact: Now, by himselfe forsaken, many Swains Leave him (alas) whom kind Shee entertains; Still her power Spreads; the Axe is now put downe Vnto the Roote; the ruine falls,—a Crowne: Now those who were freinds, or in favour high, To the Great Sheapherd, fall; for Royaltie Admitts noe Rivall; and Supreme Estate Nothing Approves but what it did Create. What need I tell, Philarchus lost his Head? Or Mirabella, strangelie banishéd? Or how Penandro, now her Minion growne, Must not by him be call'd in Qvestion For highest Crimes? To offer it, were more Then Regicide it Selfe had bene before; And even those few which did attend Him then, Rebells denounc't; Himselfe the worst of Men; That now (alas!) he's forc'd (Soe powerles left) In this remoter Countrie, thus to Shift. DAMON. Oh the Sad Day! Amintas, wee have seene The former Glories of a King and Qveene; Then Zephirina hardly had a Name; At most, below any pretence of Claime; Alas! what Safetie can our feilds Afforde To Him, they must acknowledge yet their Lord? Hee thinlie fenc?d with Loyall Hearts, may Stand, But they (alas) want Armes to the strong Hand Of Zephirina now. Our Townes are weake, Our Numbers few, and farre away to seeke. This Sought in Time, might have some Refuge bene, When His owne Troopes were full amongst vs seene; When noe Power visible could animate Aspiring Treasons; now it is too late; Now Matho, with an Iron yoake, has prest Our Loyall Shoulders; now, Hee stands possest Of that strong Towne, which by a King once rear'd, May be another's Ruine to be fear'd: What can his Hopes Suggest vnto Him here? Wee All are Cowed, even Stupifyed with feare. AMINTAS. Soe is the Nation all; or rather lost, In his neglect. They Careles are, almost, And let the Threat'ning Billow over-run Their fortunes, willing soe to be vndone; A retchlesnes has now Seiz'd everie Mind, Or a strange Tumor, newer things to find: For never greater Disproportion dwell'd Amongst Minds; All are Sunke, or overswell'd. Hither our Maister, confident of Some Yet Loyall Hearts, encourag'd was to come; Far from the Reach of Zephirina's power, Which everie day encreases more, and more; Her late imperious Summons She hath sent, And if it fayle, by force She will Attempt His Sacred Person; 'tis alreadie done. Her 'Complices in this Sedition, Bring in their willing Armes, their Purses ope, T' exasperate her Rage, and vrge a Hope Of her Establishment. Leavies are made, And Voluntarie Troopes goe to Her Ayde; That now her forces in the feild Appeare A formidable Armie; and Wee heare Cornigerus, the Generall of the rout, Must bring that Proiect speedilye about. DAMON. Alas! what Counsels may our Maister have To avoyd this Torrent, and his Honour save? Our Numbers are too weake, our wealth exhaust, To Cope with such a numerous and vast Army, as they are made to vs by fame; Amintas, Say! what Succours can Hee frame? AMINTAS. 'Tis (ah) but Small yet all Hee can pursue; Necessitated thus, Hee, with the fewe Willing to serve him, Westward now intend; Where they perswade Hee will have many a freind; However, he resolves at once to run The hazard of his Life, with Losse of Crowne. There, his Imperiall Standard will he place, (If yet it be soe powerfull as it was,) To call in everie Heart, and everie Hand, T' assist his Right, and her rude force withstand: This, his last Refuge, a wan hope, to bring Himselfe to former Glories of a Kinge. DAMON. I doe not See what Succours can be brought, Worthy of his Necessities or Thought; For Zephirina everie Countie awes With Edicts Strange, and never heard of Lawes; Her Ministers, throughout the Kingdome spred, Are Active to advance her late-rais'd Head; All Mouths are full of Her; and everie Tongve In her Name's Priviledge, can not speake wrong; When our Great Maister but a By-word Stands, And Groomes dare make a Iest of his Commands. But Say, Amintas, for the Evening calls, How comes thy bright Vrbana, to be false? AMINTAS. That, as a part of Sorrow, to the rest Then may I adde, and poure out all my brest; When Zephirina, in her obscure Cell Livéd erewhile, Vrbana lov?d her well; And though She cunning kept it from my Eare, She wish'd her ever, what wee All now see her; And her Ambitions did foment to all Strange vndertakings; that I doe not Call 'Em worse, for worst they are. Noe sooner was This Zephirina in the Royall place, But false Vrbana, all her vowes made Light; Her many former vowes, which Shee had plight, And with new Oaths seal'd, for the single Sway Of this Vsurper ioynes; and everie day Adds to her rule. Vrbana Sweeps the round Of all her Streets, for Ruffians to be found; And all the Dregs of Men, by numerous Polls, Swarme in, to fill vp Zephirina?'s Rolls; These Polymorphus leads in, to assist The new-rais'd Tirranie of What they List; And thus Vrbana, (not to her owne Lust But Zephirina?'s Baud,) has quitt her Trust. What shall I more? What you imagine more, Vrbana is of wicked. Thus the Sore You now have seen, which wounds Amintas' brest: What else remains can never be exprest. DAMON. Though further Wee remov?d, not lesse concern'd As some have taught; a Dictate never learn'd By loyall Minds; who know noe Limit to Their Zeale, or a proportion to their vow; My brest is full as thine, with the same fire, And what I can not vtter, I admire; With Horror wounded, a darke Extacie Runs through my Soule, in everie facultie. AMINTAS. Ah, Damon! though wee bleed, yet thinke, how more The Arrow wounds our Maister. Wee are poore; And though our Indyviduall Selves may seeme Near in our Eyes, wee are of noe Esteeme; Poore Shepherds may be ruin'd everie Day, Without a Noyse, and noe Man left to Say 'Twas pittye; for their narrow Motions are But in the Sphære of a Particular. Princes are set a Step beyond their fates; They never suffer Single; forméd States, The Structurs of well-setled Polities, And changéd Government; their Exequies Are ever made; and not the meanest Hee But falls a Part in ruin'd Monarchye. DAMON. What may wee doe? the Shepheard is not free To Sing his Thoughts, vnder the Tirranie Of this expected Rage; our humble verse Now carries Danger to still Iealous Ears; Wee must retract what wee have sung before, And Numbers raise (which Muses all abhorre) To Celebrate the Glories of a late Vsurpéd Power, and most deforméd State. Sing let me never, Phœbus, if I raise To thriving Treasons any note of Praise. AMINTAS. Noe matter, Swaine, Apollo?'s Harpe vnstrunge, Was seen the other Day, and careles hung Vpon the Willowes. Pan, his Syrinx made A pipe, has throwne away, and left the Trade. The Muses Silent, everie Swain strucke mute, And Verses now fall, like vntimely fruite; For what is left to Sing? Our Glorie's gon, Our Loves are Lost, or not worth thinking on. DAMON. More happines have wee: (though Miserie Surround vs All) yet in our Loves wee're free; And Shepheard's humble Loves wee not the least Of happines determine, if not Best. AMINTAS. Had Such bene mine, Soe had I happie liv?d, My flocks still kept their fold, and I had greiv?d Noe Strumpet's loosenes; then my Pipe had Still Bene pleasant; now, a worne and wearied Qvill: Damon, noe more, for longer Shadowes fall From Westerne Hills, and Shepheards homeward call. THE SONGE. 1 Vnshorne Apollo, throw away That wreath thy Tresses crowning; Thy Daphne withers from a Bay To some poore Shrub; not owning Her former verdure; Wee now bring A Chaplet of our gathering. 2 The Bramble and the wood-bine (liv?d Not halfe a day,) are twisted, Some nettles mixt; as who beleived Thy Glorie still existed; Or, to make finer, wee will trim With Marigolds, thy Anadem. 3 For Ioy is Dead, and Glorie faint; Witt's banishéd our feilds; Say, Great Protector! if wee may n't Give as the Season yeilds? Or, wouldst thow still Bay-crownéd Sitt? Restore vs Ours; weele give thee it. The End. An Ecloge: Spoken by Hilas and Strephon. Quis, talia fando? temperet a lachrimis? HILAS. If, Strephon, yet our Sorrowes doe not presse Too deepe; applye that Pipe, which has, ere this, Enricht y? proudest Groves, &amp; taught delight To dullest Soules; that Power which vanquisht quite The coy cold brest of Cœlia; did surprize Fixt Galatea, to whose brow all Eyes Pay'd their iust Homage; to all Passions cold, Rapt by thy verse, Shee could noe longer hold; That Power may yet availe; not Stones &amp; Trees May only be enliv'né Destinies Are not inexorable to the cleare Proportion of our Thoughts, when they appeare In well-weighd Numbers; yet, if not too late, Repeale the Doome of a Dire Threat'ning fate. STREPHON. Too late will fall our best Endeavours now; 'Twas but when easie Peace made Smooth y? Brow, And soft Pipes might be heard; that Love and Witt Gave Verse a Charter, soe too infinite. The Dreams of Fancie lull'd our idle Brains And form'd a privilidge, which but remains A meteor now, t' Astonish weaker Eyes; But wiser Heads admit noe prodigies. Let rather Silence seize all Tongves, then bring One Accent not to gratulate the King, The Lord of All wee are; whose Equall Rule Made Muses pleasant to the noble Soule; And did inspire Each brest, informe each braine, With flame, in wonders of his happie Raigne; But now, the Time is Come All wee can Say, Sounds like the Horrors of Departed Day. HILAS. Then, in this Night of Sorrow, let vs bring Our Grones to the Disasters of the King; Sigh out a Storie to y? pious Ears Of Men, who when wee're dead, may read this verse. The high-soul'd Eupathus dare now disclose A Storie iust to Truth, in (his owne woes,) His Maister's many Sorrowes; y? Swolne rage Of this Rebellion, and affront the Age With a cleare Pen; a hand by Truth led on, White as her Brow; vnswai'd by Passion; For 'tis a Crime noe Time shall put away To place Affection where sole Truth should Sway; T' insert our Interests, or wand'ring be In Selfe-borne Hoti'es, from the Historie. STREPHON. Ah, Hilas, but that Qvill! what Hand but must Erre in the Storie? manie Things of Trust, Some byasséd by Passions, wee relate; Some wee inforce, Some wee extenuate; Too sensibly severe or too remisse, Wee shall but wander; be the Glorie His. HILAS. Leave wee the lofty Elme &amp; spreading Plane, This crooked Alder better fits our Straine; Here, in the Nettles, stung more by our owne Still-seeding Sorrowes, wee may greive and grone. Say, Strephon, since our Maister went, what may Conduce to bring on this vnhappie Day? STREPHON. Dire, as y? Smiting Haile to new-ean'd Lambs, Or Summer Shewers vnto their late-shorne Dams, This Scourge has followed vs; Thunder alone Not strikes the Cædar; Shrubs are overthrowne In this strange Clap; Brambles &amp; Thistles are In the Concussion not exempt their Share. Ill, therefore, did Antiquity discourse Security, to this all-swallowing force; Though, to y? Pine, a thousand Shrubs may be Vn-valued, yet they fall, as well as Hee. Nor may wee safely say, when winds impent, Make Pelion tremble to Astonishment, The minor Hills are free; their little wombes Feele the same Collicke, pinch't in narrower rooms; But who observes the Dazye's rise or fall? The Royall Tulip stands y? Care of all; And Everie Eye markes its progressive threds, To give an Estimation as it spreads; When Hyacinths and common Lillyes spring, To Dye againe, as were there noe such Thing. HILAS. This Banke our Couch, wee may discus the sad Event of Things. The Glories wee once had Are witheréd: our Ioy, Anxietie; Our empty Stalls now speake our Povertie. Who boasts of heards or flocks? y? mazors which Our pious Sires left, not to make vs rich, But to remember them; these Legacies Were counted Sacred; I, my Selfe, have twice Recover'd y? carved Boale my grand sire left, At a great price; yet now againe bereft. STREPHON. Trifles ill fitt our verse, though our verse be It selfe a Trifle, to the Dignitie Of what wee would report. Our humble Qvill Our owne mishaps may vtter; but what Stile Carries a Buskin deep enough to Sing Royall Distresses and lament a King? Call Suckling from his Ashes, reinspir'd With an Elizian Trance; soe fitly fir'd To Sing a Royall orgie. There Soules move Without their Passions, how to feare or Love; Enraptur'd with divine Beatitude, Beyond our Earth. Hee, while he liv'd, pursu'd Those noble flights, as might become the name Of Maiestye; made greater in his flame. Now, might he rise, earth-freed! His only Qvill May write of this; Panacean Asphodil And fresh Nepenthe (yet a while set by The second Course vnto mortalitie) Can but infuse what wee in fancie gleane From barren mountains, horse-rais'd Hyppocrene. Oh! he might Speake, or Ionson's numerous Soule (Now great as Pindar's) might these Gests enroll; But then, alas, the greife is where it lay; They sing too high; wee know not what they Say; For earth is dull, and may not comprehend Those heights of wonder which they else have pen'd: How should wee stupid be? how meerlie mud, Below our generation? when the flood Of devine fury, might enscale our Ears T' astonishment! For verse there, is not verse; 'Tis more then all our fancy can attaine; A measur'd Idiome, to make cleare and plaine What here, in confus'd Notions, wee descrye, By iarring Accents; a iust Harmonye. I am but where I was, lost in my Selfe With thought of Somewhat; I have found y? Shelfe Still fatall to my over-haughty Qvill; The Syrtes of my Thought confounds my will. Noe, Hilas, wee, though happily as great In Loyaltie, for numbers have no seat; Farre from the Sun, &amp; him whose rayes shoote more True Life to numbers then all Phœbus power; Let vs of lower things report. Who knowes Our late-made Laureate, (constant to his vowes) Has done what wee intend? to which our notes Would sound more harsh then plash-full marish throats; Or Cleveland, full in fancy (whose Sole praise Is but his fault) to these great flights might raise A wing, for everye eye to fixe vpon, And breath a Note worthy Attention. For mighty Epicks are not worthilye By all attempted; &amp; may rather I Suffer to creepe, then striving how to flye, Fall in the rise, to greatest infamye; For every thing is happie in its first Existence given; &amp; only but accurst As from its Nature it may turne or slide, Whether above, below, too strict, or wide. All minds have their dimensions, as all things: Some belly-sweep the Earth, &amp; some, have wings To cut the purer Ayre; Some, midly move, Scorne what's below, &amp; envie what's above, Though ignorant in both; &amp; did wee know Perhaps it were but as I thinke it now, Each in his Station blest; &amp; something may Disturbe each in the progresse of his way. Let me not fill you therefore with my owne Strange fancies, which exceed proportion, To what I apprehend. If a Slow Muse May Sing her owne, 'tis well; if not, excuse My wanderings; Let stronger pineons trye A flight into the Sphere of Maiestie! Me, peace-surrounded, mirtles may secure; But thistles now my burning Browes immure. Let, let those healthfull Temples w?? maintaine Daphne still verdant, high thoughts entertaine; And gaine y? Glorie of a great pursuite. Wee envie not, because wee can't doo't; But what our Admirations may Adde, To their Endeavours, shall be truly paid. HILAS. May Still his Ears be Adder-stung, who not Attends thy Song; where man is not forgot; For he has gain'd enough who hears thy verse; Not selfe, not man, but All things to reherse. This, willingly I heare, and who soe well Can Sing his owne, I must expect can tell Worthily, what may Adde vnto the Glorye Of our dread Maister, in his dismall Storye. STREPHON. Thus, then, may Pietie enforce vs make Expressions, where noe Tongve can rightly speake; Soe may the Ant, by her short Steps, contrive To scale the Summit of Mount Tenerif, And perch within y? Clouds; as our verse send One Accent fitt to what wee Apprehend. How many Times deluded by our owne Weake hopes, though careles how to bring 'em on, Have wee expected, with too confident A Challenge, the King's re-establishment, From probable coniectures? When his low And vnprovided Army made them bow At Keinton; vndisturb'd he did posses Himselfe of Oxford, with a faire encrease Of many Noble Triumphs; Towns &amp; forts Surrendred daylie, to enlarge his Courts; Great Battles fought, where, though noe victorie Can be reported, yet Equallitye Stands not against a Scepter. Rebell Powers, Till All be vanquisht, are noe conquerours. But the Convincing Right, which Princes bring, Secures them victors, in not suffering. Brought from a King to nothing, Hee, of Late, From Nothing had attain'd his former State; And Rebell mouths, (who speake noe truth, vnles Evicted 'bove their Rage) did then confesse Him master of y? feild, and seem t' encline, (Enforc'd beyond their power) to a designe (Which plausible enough) did more invade Then Armes could doe; They sev'rall Treaties made: This must subvert; for Princes, in their course Of Victories when staied, run backe, of force. Here once to vndertake &amp; not proceed, Is to retire. In Pleurisies to bleed Gives a Recoverie; but let it rise One very little, &amp; the partye Dyes. Still our great Maister, willing to compose These fatall Iarres, accepts what they propose, As farre as stood with honour or his oath, Beyond his Interest. Oh the strange growth Of Treasons! Like to Adders, hid in Brakes, Are feeble wormes; new-clad, destroying Snakes; They lurke, and they appeare, act, or contrive To bring on the designe at which they drive; And ever, in compliance, they renew Their Scales &amp; Strength; enabled to subdue Th' vnwarie opposite; recovered in These Slye advantages, againe begin They to appear themselves, &amp; then contemne What they propos'd, or what Hee offer'd them. Now, strong in Armes, they strangely iustifye Their Actings Lawfull; and from Loyaltie (Their first-borne plea) they now put in their owne Interests, without Qualification. Thus thriving Treasons still are Insolent; Rebellion treads beyond a President; And State-Subverting Magicke has a feate Beyond all Rule was ever spoken yet. The Florentine prescribes to duller fooles; But Stronger flow from all relaxéd Soules. What may I adde? Where force could not prevaile, Phillip's ne'r-failing Batterie must assaile; Honour made merchandice; &amp; Loyaltie Was set to price; these Bag-Granadoes flie Still to Advantage Garrisons' Revolt; And their feild Armies march, without a Halt. The King, this while growne weake; his party all Distracted, from their first and generall Engagement of obedience; now pursue Their private Ends; Honour &amp; profitt drew Some in to serve; Ambition, Place, &amp; Power Made others Loyall; till (alas, noe more Wee now see left Him; then the Stragling few Which into severall Garrisons he drew; For nothing else is left, &amp; ev'n the cheife Strictly beseig'd, expecting noe releife, Must yeild of force; where (ah), (why must I say What I abhorre?) his sacred Person may Be captivated theirs. Not may, but must, Inevitably fall, to their vniust Tirrannous wills. What then will be too small For them to doe, when they have gotten All? Ah, Hilas! I am full; my passions breake Vpon my Reason, that I cannot Speake. HILAS. 'Tis Lamentable Sad; and doth display A certaine Ruine in Phœnomena. Some men Sad fates attend; &amp; to be borne A Prince is not secure; the certaine turne Of Destinie's darke wheele involveth All; And Scepters, to prœordred Ends must fall. But Strephon, yesterday Amintas told The King's escape from Oxford, as a bold And certaine Truth; how Hee, with other two Whom he might trust, came out; Himselfe in low Condition, as a Servant did attende, To secure better what Hee did intende; And now before beseiged Newarke, Hee Is with the Scotts; in what Capacitie, Hee did not Say; but vpon overture Formerly made, he hopes to be Secure; And to engage that Nation, who has bene The Greatest Cloud his Glories yet has seene. From this, Some expect wonders; others hott Boyle out proverbiall fears—A Scott's a Scott. What may be y? event, Time will produce; And wee all gape to heare y? next daye's newes. STREPHON. Wee can expect from thence but little good; A nation branded faithles, who have stood Opposite ever to his rule; they first Blew vp the Embers which wee now see burst A flame too great to quench. Yet ere I stray Too farre, t' asperse that Nation; by the way Let me exempt Montrose's glorious hand, The Loyall Gourdons, &amp; brave Craford's band; Mac-donnel's Puissance, which still maintain'd The Royall Cause; and All who (never stain'd) Have suffer'd for their master; humbly low As I can fall, to these my selfe I bow; Who have recall'd my enrag'd Qvill, which might Have printed deepe to Time; for to recite The frauds in Cambel, or the periuries Of Hamiltons, the Lesley's Subtleties, Might move a better temper; though noe doubt Some of these Names not suffer in the Blot Their Cheifs have spread vpon their families; May they, the gverdon of their Loyalties Have from a better Pen; and now, the King Is pleas'd to refuge there; may ev'n these bring The long-spred Calumnye of a loud fame, A Sin on those who shall traduce their name; Yet let vs feare, and I doe feare, he not Shall be a lyar made, who has that thought. HILAS. 'Tis but too probable their Ends may be Their Interest. But, Strephon, certainly Some Invitations, with assurance, must Make the King give his Person to their trust, Though they be false as Hell? And how a man Of his high Reason, (once deceiv'd) ere can Againe be brought to trust 'em, I not see; Being insnar'd by former periurie, To this now falling ruine; may it not Be his too much Affection to the Scott Enieopards him? But rather from a ground In Iudgment he may trust 'em! Had he found Former performances, and not a Stale Made of things Sacred to their owne availe, Something might move; at lest, wee more remote (This granted) feare, what cannot be forgot. STREPHON. This Great King! this Good Man! For he was both, Till Treason cropt the one, to give a growth More visible to his more valued fruite; And this Hee is, even in their Repute. This Good King Saw a Sphere beyond our Sence, His Iudgment is almost Intelligence; And what wee, groveling, may surmise, he reads Distinctly Acted. Why he thus proceeds Let not vs question. In a wracke wee trust A Sayle-yard, or a Planke of broken Chest, To carrie vs. When ere wee put to Sea, We'd know how kauk'd &amp; trim'd y? Ship may be. Extremity, one hazard, must assay, And fate determines but the better way. But, Hilas! ere aware, the Sun declines, And longer Shadowes make yond Poplars, Pines; Home let vs hast, &amp; what remains reherse To our Sad Pipes, in an alternate verse. THE SONGE. HILAS. 'Tis Sad, What wee must Sing; A Storie made To pussle verse; For (ah) what number can reherse The Sorrowes of the King? STREPHON. Oh, Sing noe more, But throw away your oaten Reeds. What voice or Qvill Can reach this note? the Thistle seeds Where Roses sprung before, And Lillyes grac'd y? Hill. HILAS. Then farewell Softer Layes! This Sullen Straine Is musicall, and worthy praise. When wee complaine, Wee may be loud; And Greife disord'red is not rude. STREPHON. Let Love &amp; Witt Polish smooth Accents, &amp; affect a Cleare Current in Numbers; Sorrow here Is all our Muse; &amp; what may fitt So deepe a Passion, wee now bring, Tears, Grones, &amp; Sighes, attendants to the King. CHORUS. Then breake our Pipes, while wee forgett All verse, And make it out in Sighs, in grones, and Tears. The End. Eclesiasticus: OR, The Wisedome of Iesus, the son of Syrach; Paraphrased. A te Principium, tibi desinet, accipe iussis Carmina cœpta tuis, atque hanc sine tempore Circum Inter victrices hederam tibi serpere Lauros. XI Ianij: Anno Domini CIC.ICC.XXXIX. By G: D: The Induction to the worke. Loe, this the Muse who variously did sing And soar'd at Randome, with an Idle wing; Told younger yeares the Passions of Love, In broken Accents, as sick thoughts did prove; First the disdaine, then sung the Solemne rites To Himen's tryumph,—nuptiall delights. Who now (transform'd) put on a Satyr's brow, And touch't the vices which the Times did know. Sometimes, with better Thoughts, has sung a storie, In holy Rapture, of Cœlestiall glory; Of worldly vanities, brought somewhat lower, Has sung the beauties of devine Pudore; His second Love, the Darling of his soule, Charginge the waters Neighbouring as they roule, To sound her Name vnto the After-times, Least she might be forgotten in weake rimes; Rimes far vnworthy to record her Name, But they shall Live, &amp; she surviue to Fame. Hath wept the Funeralls of Buckingham, And Herbert's Death, with some of lower Name, Recorded vertuous; &amp; hath paid a verse To Iohnson's vrne, &amp; wept vpon his Herse; Ioyn'd with the Muses, Strongly to defend The force of Numbers; w?? a select freind, Worthy Amintas, in an easie strife; This for the Citty, That a Country Life. Lastly, (as Tribute) to Great Brittaine's King, Did as his vertues, soe his Glories sing; With his faire Queene, our hopes, their happie Ioyes; In English Roses, and the French De-Liz. Now fixeth here: and as a Pilgrim sent A holy voyage, w? devout intent I tread these Steps; &amp; ere I fall to write Am Ceis'd w? admiration and delight; I am afraid of shadowes in the Land, Where I a Pilgrim and a stranger stand; I looke to this, &amp; see, on th' other side, A diverse way; alas, I want a Gvide! The Morneing calls mee early from my Rest, I see the sun, I fix vpon the East; Yonder I thinke to goe to; but ere I, A while haue gone, I am led diversly; I wander with the sun, at Night return, (With fruitles Labour) where I was at Morne. O Lead mee, Lord! in this soe anxious Maze, Revert my feet into the perfect waies; And be my Conduct in a Land Remote, Where men are Monsters, People know mee not; To the sweet Hills, the Hills of Solima', Where the bright morneing doth her wings display; Soe to the Holy Cittie, which doth now (Ingratefull Citie) lye like ruines low; To thy belovéd Sion, where of Old Thy Prophets have their Revelations told; Where Ishai's son did to thy Musique frame Loud songs of Praise, to Celebrate thy Name; Vnto the doore of that fal'n Temple which His son erected, beautifiéd with rich And curious workemanship; where that wise King, (Wise in the Misterie of every Thing; Who had tried all the waies to give content Follye could prompt, or wisedome could Invent,) Re-call'd Himselfe. O what, what haue I done? What new thing is there to the King vnknowne? What Mundane thing? What? but the King did trie, Yet all is vanitie, meere vanitie. Where Syrach's son, (a second Solomon For teaching vertue &amp; Instruction) Did vtter these. Oh, thither bring mee once, That I, with Ioy, may kisse the sacred stones, That I may know to Render in our tongue The Lessons which he to the Hebrewes sung; Vnfold darke sayings, Hidden things recall Vnto our Light, from the Originall. Ah! deare, I faint: can only this vnsolve, The sentences which wisedome doth involve? Noe other way must I needs Syon see? Lord, thou art Sion; thou art all to Mee! Thou art all Language, every tongue is thine; Shed in my Soule thy Rayes; a Heart Divine Into my fancye, soe apt euerie word, It may be vsefull, and with Truth accord. Let my Imperfect Accents Strike the Eares Of Men who scorne the Harmony of verse; Let them confess that verse may Comprehend Fullnes of Matter; and not, Madly Blind, Persist in Error; that there cannot be Those heights of Wisedome seene in Poesie; Not that I seeke a Glory in the Thing; Far be it from Mee, but that I may bring More honour to thy Name. Oh, let mee Call It noe more Mine, I would Resigne it all; May I not thinke it, as the Thing I did But as a Stranger, soe fall to &amp; read; Not looke vpon it w?? the Partiall Eye Of blind Affection or Proprietie; Quash my Affections, &amp; Subdue my thought, That I may value all my owne as nought. Be it enough, 'tis done to Glorifie Thy Name, &amp; reinforme Posteritie The way to Goodnes; I can aske noe more, But lay an humble offering at the doore. Seale I my vowes then, and depart in Peace; For though I vtter more, I might Speak less. Cap. i. God only wise, Wise Ever; and shall be Full in his Wisedome, to Eternitie. Who can account with nice Arithmeticke The Sands which floore the Sea? or who can seeke, With curious Inquisition, eyther what Drops fall in showers? or give the world a Date? Or what more subtle Art can rightly give The height of Heaven? or more then vainly strive To Specifie the Earth? how must it be Or in the breadth, or the Profunditie? The wisedome of the Lord who can attaine, W?? hath beene Ever, and shall Ever shine? When nothing was, then Wisedome only was, And only there where yet she is in place. The Spring of Wisedome and the source of All Is in the word of God Misteriall; And the Eternall Pandicts which he writt, Stand as the Gate or Entrance vnto it. Who knowes the Root of wisedome? Or who can Catch at the Raies of Knowledge? Or what Man Can apprehend the Sacred Misteries Of Wisedome? Or but where the Entrace is? There is One Wise, and there is only one, Ev'n the Most High, who sitts vpon the Throne, The Almighty King of Power; He is the Lord, Who did create her by his mighty word. Hee, only Hee, hath seene her; and survayed Her true dimensions, and her Light displaied In all his worke. How much resplendent She! How lucent in all flesh! and graciously, In an aboundant Measure, he doth store All such as love him, and his Name Adore! The feare of God is glory and Content, Filling a Soule with Sacred Ravishment; It is a Crowne of Honour, &amp; doth give Felicitye &amp; Ioy to Attend Long Life. Thrice happie Hee, and more than happy thrice, Who feares the Lord; him will not he despise, But Bless, and favour, when the time shall come, With a mild Sentence, and a gracious Doome. The Love of God doth dignifie a Name With Wisdome, to a never-dying Fame. The Iust are seasonéd with a Holie feare Of God, ev'n in the wombe; which, as it were, Gives them Admittance to the Notion Of Misteries in Knowledge; it is on Selected Woemen; and is ever knowne, With the Iust Man to Admiration. The Feare of God is holy knowledge; which Shall not preserve but Iustifie as much; Adds comfort to the Heart, and maketh whole A contrite Spirit, &amp; a wounded Soule: Prosperitie, his Life shall ever Blesse; And when he dyes, he shall depart in Peace. The Feare of God is full fruition Of Wisedome, and it is in that alone; She fills the house with Ioy, and she doth Blesse The Garners with a full &amp; large encrease; Which both are gifts of Heaven. It is the Crowne Of Wisedome, and a true Perfection, To feare the Lord; it giueth health and Peace. Hee numbred hath and seene her, what she is; She showers downe knowledge, and doth apt the Mind For vnderstanding, in the fullest kind; Honour attends her Steps: and Honour must (Soe Heaven is pleaséd) gratifie the Iust. The root of Wisedome is to feare the Lord, And her Spred branches shall long Life afford; Wisedome gives perfect knowledge, and doth bring Right vnderstanding; truly seasoning And purgeing minds from Error's filthy blot; Thus is she Faire, but Sinners love her not. Where a true feare of God is, there shall Sin Vanish away, nor ever enter in; When she is present, Wrath and Anger shall Noe more be seene, but glide away and fall; For 't cannot Stand with Anger to be wise, And Death Attends where wrath doth Tyrranize. But loe, the patient Man endures a Time And the Reward of Ioy shall fall to Him; His Lips are Sealed to Anger, and his Name Shall stand vnspotted in an Ample Fame. In Wisedome, hidden secrets and darke things Are seene and knowne; but yet the Sinner brings Opprobious taunts t' obscure (if it might be) Her Light, and hates th' Immortal Dietye. If Wisdome thou desire, and seeke her waies, Observe the Law; he is not Wise that Straies; Keepe the C?mandments, and she shall be, In a full Measure, giv'n by God to thee; For to feare God is full fruition Of Wisedome; Him whose pleasure is alone In faith and Meekeness: Be not then to Him Rebellious, nor obstinate in Crime; Nor come vnto Him with a double Heart, Who knowes thy Zeale, a vaine fantastick Art; Dissemble not with God, nor feigne a Zeale To Him, from whom thou canst not ought conceale; Thence may come Scandall to the world, and then, As th' art despis'd by God, th' art scorn'd by Men. Doe not alledge thy merit, nor Exalt Thy selfe to God, least for that only fault Thy Soule fall to dishonour, and Hee, wroth, Discover secret Sins, which thy owne Sloth Or arrogance forgotten had; and thou Refuseing Mercy, fall in Iustice now, A Spectacle of Scorne and Miserye; Neglecting God, and loveing vanitie. Chap. ii. If thou would'st serve the God of Heaven (my Son) Love Righteousnes; with resolution Prepare thy selfe t' endure the strong Assaults Of slye Temptation; scorne the poore Revolts Of humane frailtye; Let thy Passions be Subdu'd and Conquer'd by thy Constancy. Be still attent to wisedome, and when ere Sorrowes assaile thee, Hope in God, with Feare; Expect from Him, and patiently attend, That thou mayest be rewarded at thy End; Abide what happen shall, with Fortitude, And though Afflictions Change &amp; be renew'd, Let not thy Soule be troubled; for as 't is To Gold and Silver, in hot furnaces, An exact way of tryall, and doth render The Mettall pure, giveing it worth and Splendor; Soe Man is tryed and valu'd, as he can Resist the Batteries of Affliction; Adversitie the Manners doth refine, And Adds to Vertue an Immortall Shine. Be constant in the God of Heau'n, confide, Hee will assist thee, and thy footsteps gvide: Continue firme in thy Resolues of feare, And let it Shine vpon thy Silver Haire. You that Feare him, wait, and expect with Ioy, For Mercy; neither waver, lest you dye: Trust in him, you that feare him, and you may Expect a blessing, which he vowes to pay. Oh, yo? that trust in him, let your desires Be purged in the bright &amp; holy fires Of Innocence and Vertue, and your Eyes Fixt on his Mercye and Eternall Ioyes; And you that Feare him, Love him; which shall give Ioy to the Heart, in fullnes, whil'st you live. Looke backe to former Ages, and then stay, T' examine well, and seriously Survay If thou was ever one, Iust and vpright, Of Life vnblemish't, and of humble Spright, Zealous to God-ward; If ere such a One: Know Death at all, or saw Confusion: Whom, whom, hath he forsaken, that but hath Trusted in him? Or on whom ha's this wrath Of Heav'n falne, if he to God haue beene Devout in soule, in hands vnspotted, Cleene? For God is gratious, and doth looke vpon The offence of Mankind with Compassion; Preserveth Sinners in Temptation; Is a Support and true Salvation. Woe vnto Them, they many woes shall find, Who haue a Devious and a froward Mind; To those of Lying Lips and bloodie Hands, And to the Sinner that 'twixt two waies stands. Woe to the Reprobate! whose timerous soule Vpon the Waves of Doubts and Passions roule; Hee not beleiveth, therfore shall he be, (Renouncing Heav'n) vext with Impietye. Woe vnto you, perverse in Manners, and You of a bitter Soule, who tott'ring stand, In a darke Slippery way; what will yo? doe, When God in Iustice comes to visit you? They will not be repugnant, nor Dissent, Who feare the Lord, from his Commandement; And such as him Adore, Sin cannot move Them, in the Waies of Ioy, of Peace, of Love. Those that feare him will bend their faculties To doe the things are pleasing in his Eies; And those that Love him, and in Truth abide, Shall stand before him and be Iustified. They that feare him, will, with Sobrietye Prepare their hearts, and in Humilitye New vest their Soules; before him they will be Constant in faith with true Integritye; And wait his pleasure; Saying, if wee shall For Sin be impenitent, we doe not fall Into the Hands of Men, but God shall see, And wee must fall to his Severitie; Yet as he is in Iustice, soe he can Have mercy, and be gratious to Man. Chap. iii. The Iust are full in wisedome, and doe move With Sober steps of Dutie and of Love. Children, Submit your Wills t' Antiquitie, And let your Actions show Conformitie To the Instructions which your fathers have Declar'd to you, that soe you may be safe; For it is that which God expects to see, That by their Children Fathers honored be; And to their Mothers humble; for to him That gives the Father Reverence shall Sin Not be imputed; neither shall he fall To vice, but see felicitye in All; And he y? feares his Mother, waits her Pleasure, Shall have a blessing in an Ample Measure; As he his Father honored, soe shall His Children with Ioy vnto him fall, And when he Prayes, it shall not be in vaine; Hee shall be heard, and heard, he shall obtaine. Who honoreth his Father, in his waies, Shall see felicitie and length of daies; His mother shall be blest in him, and see Ioy Crowne her Daies, and Prosperitie. He that feares God, will give a Reverence To Parents, and a true Obedience; Nor Doe, nor Say, t' offend them; nor in thought Grudge at their pleasure, or repine at ought: Soe shall the dew of Heaven fall on thy haires, And Bless with ioy and Plenty all thy yeares; For 'tis the Father's blessing that shall be Vpon the House, to all Posteritie; Shall give it strength, and Life; Strength to Endure, And Life to flourish in the Successour; Thus to the Iust. But where the fatall curse Of the Dead Mother hangs, it shall goe worse; The Walls shall Drop to Dust, and he shall be Scorn'd in himselfe; Curst in his Progenie. Make not a laughter of thy Father's Shame, For it can be noe honour to thy Name; Being that the Son has glory in the Thing His Father did of honour; and the Sting Of Shame and Infamie shall his soule vex, Whose Mother had not vertues to her Sex. When feeble Limnes shall speake thy Father old, Be pious to his Moods; Let not the Cold Blood in his shallow veines against thee burne; Let not the cause of Anger on thee turne; And if the Imperfections of Old Age Shall be in him, (as testy Passion, Rage, Weake Memory, or Dullnes, incident To venerable Eld,) be thou content, Nor scorne his weakenes; tho' in strength thou be, He was as thou art, thou maiest be as Hee; He is thy Father; and his praiers have Obtain'd a Blessing for thee, which Shall Save Thy Soule from Damage; and thy Mother's crime Shall not be laied to thee, at any Time; And when Affliction is, God from on Hye, Shall see, and Save thy Soule, from Ieopardie. As doth the Ice melt, 'fore the Sun's keene raye, Soe shall thy Sins vanish and fall away. But Hee that leaves his Father, 'tis a Crime Shame shall Attend, and Death follow him; And the Iust Anger of a Mother shall Bring down a curse, which heavily must fall. My son, fly Arrogance, and doe not boast Thy Actions worthy, least the worth be lost; But leave its estimation to the vote Of a cleare ffame, which cannot be forgott. Let thy Humilitie, in all things be The more, the more thou art in dignitie; Many Renown'd and Noble wee may veiw, But secrets are reveal'd to th' humbler few; For Great the Power of God is, and his Feare Is precious to those that humble are. Be not inquisitive, nor too high wise, Nor seeke to Discerne things beyond thy Eyes; But what thou art Capable, what God has bid, That thinke vpon, with Reverence and Heed. Prye not into his secrets; 'tis a nice And foolish Itch, to Curiosities, To dispute Misteries and things forbid; Which, for they are not needfull, they are hid. In an aboundant knowledge be not vain; For many things may be beyond thy Braine And reach of frailtie; Many have fal'n thus, Into a Laberinth contiguous Of Doubts and fears, and have Perishéd. With hasty steps, by their owne Error led. Without thy Eyes, though Heaven's Glorie be At full displaied, yet it is darke to thee; Therfore be wise, in Modest Silence, and Speake not of what thou dost not vnderstand; A Stubborne Heart shall know he has done ill, And the nice Scepticke, his owne feares shall kill. A Double Heart seekes to a Double way, And finding neither, wanders still astray; And the perverse and obstinate shall be His owne destruction, prest with Miserie. The wicked Man takes pleasure in his Crime, And adds continually to ruine him. The scornefull Proud shall find as proud a Scorne, And Die forgot, as had he not beene borne; For Sin is deepe in him, and he shall be, Or never Nam'd, or Nam'd with Infamie. The wise Man shall be seene in Misteries, And neare Attent to Sacred Knowledges; A Wise Man will not sin; soe shall he be Blest in his Actions with Prosperitie. Soe water quenceth fire as Almes well done, Take away Sin, as if there had beene none; And hee that Sees the Heart, and knowes it, will Reward the Act, as it is good or ill; That in the day of Tribulation, hee Shall find a Harbour of Securitie. Chap. iv. Doe not extort from Povertie, nor stay The Needie, with a frivolous delay; Vex not a Soule perplexéd, with thy Taunts, Nor make a scorne of any Man in wants. Doe not exasperate a greivéd mind, Nor Mocke Necessitie in any kind; Scorne not the praier of one in Miserie, Nor turne away thy face from Povertie; Let not thy Anger at the needy burne, Least thy owne fury to a curse returne Vpon thy selfe; for if he iustly shall Pronounce a curse, sent from the very Gall Of a greiv'd Spirit, certainly his praier Shall have access to the Creator's Eare. Contemne not Povertie, and let thy will Submit to a more venerable Skill; Honour the Magistrate, and let him claime Respect from thee who has a Noble Name; Be patient to the nedy-man's complaint, And pay thy Debt with freindly Complement; Protect the Innocent from the Strong Clawes Of Black Oppression and Subverted Lawes; Iudge not at all; but Iudge with sound advice, And let not Trifles move thy sentence twice; Releive the Orphan; Pitty Widdowes' Teares, Redress her wrongs, Support her, in her Feares; Soe God shall be thy Father: he will be More tender then thy Mother over thee. Wisedome Inspireth Life, and fills the Mind With holy Rapture, and doth goe beyond Error's foule mist, to the aboundant Raies Of Knowledge, where she doth prescribe her waies: Hee that loves wisedome, loveth Life as much; And hee that loveth Life shall never touch Death's dismall threshold, but be in full ioy; Who keepeth her, envy shall not destroy The glory of his Name, but he shall be Consideréd and blest aboundantlye. They that esteeme her shall not serve in vaine, But God shall be the gverdon of their paine; They shall be servants to the Lord aboue; For such as love her, them he vowes to love. The wise shall Live, and Nations shall Submit To what he thinketh Iust, and Iudgeth fitt: Hee shall inhabite in the Tents of Ioy, And in his Seed be blest aboundantlye; For she will lead him by Ambiguous waies, And through the corners of a Dismall Place, Where feare lurkes privilye, and doth assay, With a strict discipline and every way, To prove his Soule; which being now found true, She brings him to the direct Path, to show Him now deepe Misteries and holy things; And to attaine true Knowledge, she gives wings Of perfect vnderstanding: but if Hee (Carried by Humor, Will, &amp; Vanitie,) Wander in the darke waies of Doubt and Error, She leaves him to his Shame and Soule's Terror. Lavish not out thy dayes nor let Sin Court Thy easie Soule; (she dyes, without support From thy owne Will) erect a Cheerfull face, To Witnes Truth, though in the Doubtfull Case Of thy own Life; for 'tis a greater Shame To Spurne at God, and Reprobate thy Name To his Eternall Truth, then to be thought Worthless by Men: the Shame of ffeare has brought Sin to attend; the other though he died,— A word, to Men,—he shall be Iustified. Let thy owne Conscience gvide thee, 'bove the strong And quaint perswasions of another's tongue; Let not his Art betray thee, lest it be Perhaps a trap to take thee privilye, And point out thy Ruine; soe thou fall A prey to tirrany, a Scorne to All. Give thy advice, and let it be in time, To prevent, or recall a Man from Crime; Doe not withold thy wisedome, when 't may be, For others vse, or honour vnto thee; Wisedome is seene in words, and Actions crowne A perfect wisedome, in a full renowne; Dare not at all, a Truth to contradict, But Blush to see and know thy owne defect. Gladly Confesse thy Sins; and doe not Strive Against the Current of the Streame to strive; Hate a foole's Government, and be not tooke, (Soe fooles are taken) by a lofty looke; Love Truth with fervency, and let thy blood Be shed for Iustice; in a Cause soe good, God is Accounteable, and vowes to be To thy foes vengeance, Honour vnto thee. Let not thy Tongue demonstrate thy owne worth, But doe the thing for others to set forth; Insult not vpon Weaknes; doe not seeke To Tyrranise vpon the humble Necke Of Servitude; Seeke not a Glorie in Soe poore a Conquest; let thy Bountye shine In all thy Actions, and the iust Equallitye Of thy desires shall Crowne thy Liberallitye. Chap. v. Trust not in Riches, with a vaine Ostent Of Fullnes, for 'twill not be prevalent In the Sad Day; let thy Affections be Restrain'd by Reason, Curb'd by Pietye. Boast not thy strength or Power, in the Progresse Of ill-spent Dayes, to live in wickednesse, Secure or irresponsable. Noe! know God will have vengeance, though he suffer now. Say not I Live, and ravill out my daies In Libertie; I trye the many waies Of Sin, to Death, and yet I cannot see, In this, nor that, but I'me as blest as Hee That followes vertue and observes the law: (Thus vtter fooles) but though thy Maker draw Awhile his Anger back, at last he shall Showre downe his wrath, to crush thee in the fall. Expect the wage of Sin for what is done, And let thy care prevent Addition. Say not, the Mercy of our God is great, He can forgive My Sins, and expiate My Manifold transgressions. Oh! beware Of such presumption, for they equall are In him, Mercy and Wrath; and Sinners must Fall in his Fury; for he will be Iust. Præfix noe time to Goodnes; let the Day Of Reformation hang in noe delay; For he will come in thy securitye, And Iudge the Soule in its Impuritie. Trust not in wicked Riches; they shall be, When the Day cometh, of noe vse to thee. Be fixt, and swerve not to a doubtfull way; For soe the finner doth himselfe betray. Let thy Resolves be firme in holy waies Of Knowledg, loveing Righteousness and Peace; Heare, and submit to what the learnéd say, In holy Misteries, that thy heart May Have satisfaction; rectifie thy word, Strictly to say what may with truth accord. Be prompt and Sedulous, good things to heare, Thy Life vnspotted, and thy Manners cleare. Satisfye Questions, if thou vnderstand, If Ignorant, let Reason countermand Silence to thy desires, lest thou maiest fall In thy owne Errour,—made a scorne to all. Honour &amp; shame attends on what wee say, And oft the Tongue brings to a sad Decay. Make not thy Name a scandall to thy Mouth, Of a darke ffame; for Levitie, love Truth, And wait not for another's Preiudice, To thy advantage; for such evill is Never vnpunish't; hee shall fall to shame, The Subtle Teacher, and his spotted Name Survive with Infamie, and be a scorne To those that are, and those that are not borne. Be Circumspect and Iust, let nothing sway Thee, more or lesse on this or th' other way Beyond Integritie; to great &amp; small Alike Enclin'd, severely Iust to All. Chap. vi. Where once thou wast a freind, let nothing move Thee to desist, or turne away thy Love; For shame attends such falsehood; it shall be A foule reproach to all Posteritye. Glory not in the strength of thy owne Mind, Least as a Bull of feirce and savage Kind, Thy Soule fall on thee, and eate vp thy prime, Destroy thy fruit; and thou, in little time, Be as a wither'd stocke or saples tree; For soe the wicked perish,—foolishlie; Trusting his owne strength, a scorne to his foes, To himselfe Horror, and Eternall woes. A Good word gaineth freinds and keepeth peace, And words well-ordered in discourse, doe please; Be freind to All, but one thy bosome-freind, Familiar to thy thoughts, as thy owne Mind; But rashly credit not; first try him sure, By circumstance; ffor some noe more endure Then they have vse; and when thy needs shall fall, Leave thee to want, Shame, Miserie, &amp; All; And some are seeming friends, who privilie Betraies thy secrets to thy Enimie; Plots thy destruction, and in thy disgrace, Will blushles tell thy Follies to thy face. Another, for his Belly, is thy freind, And on thy Smileing fortunes doth attend; Is what thou art, and takes a Libertie Over thy servants, as himselfe shall See; But if the bright Sun of thy Plenty be Choak'd in the fogs of want and Miserie, His vowes are Cancell'd; he noe longer can Attend on want, or serve a needy man. Converse not with thy Foes, beware thy freind: For many seeme who nothing doe intend; A prouéd freind is firme at all assaies, Of precious worth, and Iust in all his waies Beyond all paritie; vnto his faith Iewels want lustre, Treasure wanteth weight. A faithfull freind is a preservative 'Gainst Fate or Envy; and the Lord shall give To those that feare him, himselfe for a freind: Such Love, Chance changeth not, nor shall death end. Attend Instruction from thy tender yeares, Soe maiest thou find in it thy frostie haires; Attend with diligence; with greater Ease, She soe is gotten, and w?? more encrease; How is she bitter to the ignorant, Nor can he keepe her that doth iudgment want. Shee only proves him, as the stone doth Gold, And he flings her away he cannot hold; For many, many, have the Ayerie Name Of Wisedome, in a full and swelling fame; But few, and very few, (if any one,) Have seene her Beauties and her secrets knowne. With those that know her she shall be of price, And stand an obiect to Eternall Eyes. Attend, (my Son) my discipline receive, And listen to the Counsell which I give; Submit thy wild affections to her thrall, And let thy head-strong will to councell fall; Be patient to sustaine her, not despise Her yoke, nor quit thee from Captivities; Let thy heart Ioy to meet her, and her waies Be the example how to gvide thy Daies; Be diligent to seeke her, she shall be Reveal'd and open'd what she is, to thee; And when thou hast her, swerve not from her waies, For at the last, she will adde many Ioyes; And then her fetters will be a defence, And in her Chaines, thou shalt have Excellence; For in her, there is precious Ornament, Her bands are Easie Laws, with the Ostent, Of a rich Dye; in her, thou art arraied As in a Robe which honour hath displaied; She will bring health, and dignifie thy Name, And Crowne thee with a Ioyfull Diadem. My Son, if willing, thou shalt have advice, And if thou seeke Knowledge thou shalt be wise; Attend and treasure vp what thou shalt heare, Wisedome is best attainéd by the Eare; Converse with Learnéd Men, and doe not thou Dissent from what Antiquitie doth know; Let thy discourse be holy, and thy Heart Glad to receiue what Knowledge doth impart; Hast to a Man of Knowledge, and frequent Often his doores; let thy thoughts be intent Vpon God's Law; soe shall thy Heart be blest, And thy desires with Wisedome full Possest. Chap. vii. Fly Sin, and live secure; performe thy part, Sin not remaines, but with a willing heart; Let not thy good fall to the pregnant Slime Of wickednes, least thou reape seven times; Covet not too high Dignities, nor bring Important suits, to beg it of the King; Adde not to Merit, nor Extenuate Thy Crime to heav'n, fondly to vindicate Thy conscious Soule; for God doth know &amp; see Thy heart, thy sin, thy sin of Secresie. Boast not thy wisedome to a Royall Eare, Nor seeke to sitt in Iudgment, least thou Erre; Sway'd or by faction; or the sullen frowne Of some great Man deterre thee from thy owne Integritie. Let not the vulgar be Thy malice, nor admit Communitie, But at a distance. Let not double Crime Defile thy Soule; for in one there is shame. Say not I'le repeat my offence to heauen, With my oblations, and what I have given, God will accept. Be fervent in thy praier, Frequent in Almes, and full in pious care. Deride not Miserie; for God doth see, And he can exalt him, and ruine thee. Let not thy brother suffer in a Lye, To staine thy soule, and raise him Infamie: Forbeare to Lye at all, not in a thing Indifferent; falshood can never bring Ioy to thy Soule, or honour to thy Name, But growes to Coustome, ends to thy owne shame. Vse Modestie in speech, let not the vaine Ostent of words swell thee to vrge againe Thy once repeated praier; doe not despise An honest labour, nor with haughtie Eyes Disdaine a Rustick lownesse. Doe not vant Thy selfe familiar and Conversant With the wild Crew; nor Glory in thy witt, To thinke how rarely thou hast compass'd it. Let not the Memory of a darling Sin Please thy gray haires, nor let wishes in; But thinke, oh thinke, there once will be a time When thou must satisfie for all thy crime. Be of an humble soule; for to the proud, Fire, and the gall of Conscience is allow'd. Value thy freind 'bove all, and let the gold Of Ophir, for thy Brother's love be Cold. Cleave to the vertuous Woeman; she is given Thee as a portion, by the hand of Heaven: Her vertue is full Dower, and Modestie Adornes her more than wealth or Dignitye. Let a good servant have a due respect Of Love from thee; let not supine neglect Creepe in to his deservings; let him find Thy Care &amp; bountie, as he was inclin'd To doe thy pleasure; now grant his desire, And satisfie the Labourer with hire. If thou hast Cattle, tend them with a care, Keepe or forgoe, as to thy vse they are. If blest with sons let not the blessing die, Give them Instruction from their Infancye; Let them know rule: if Daughters, let them be In thy owne keep, admit noe libertie: Be strict, and curbe them w?? an austere brow, Nor let them ever thy Indulgence know. Marry thy Daughter, by discreet advice; For it a Matter much Important is, Redundant to thy glorie &amp; her good. Let him be wise, and of vntainted blood, Whom thy choice makes a son. If (happy thou) To thy soule's Ioy, &amp; thy owne wish, haue now A Wife; be fixt there, let not lewdnes smile To tempt thy frailty, &amp; thy soule beguile. Honour thy father w?? a pious feare, And pay thy dutie to a mother's care; But thinke from them thou wert, &amp; but for Them, Where hadst thou beene, in being or in Name? What can requite? what's thy obedience? Thy Love, feare, Honour? a poore recompence. Feare God in Soule, &amp; let his preists from thee Have honour due vnto their Dignitie; Love thy Creator, with thy Strength, thy Life, And let thy eare be to the Iust man's greife; With all thy Soule fear God, &amp; venerate His owne anointed, &amp; his Consecrate, His holy Preists; give them their Due, thy Debts, Thy first-borne fruits, Purgings, &amp; to Expiate Thy Sin with Sacrifice. To God be these, Erected hands, pure heart, with humbled knees; These be the Offerings, the sacrifice, And first-fruits of value in his Eyes. Give to the poore, soe God the state will bless; And in their Praier, thou shalt expire in Peace. Charitie is of worth in all men's eyes; And let the Dead not want for Obsequies; Comfort the Sad; Mourne with a troubled Mind; Visit the Sicke; thy gverdon thou shalt find; In all thy vndertakings, weigh the End, Soe shalt thou neuer vnto Death Offend. Chap. viii. Neuer contend with power, least hee, too strong, Oppress thee; weaknes cannot suffer long; Differ not with the Rich, whose treasure can Compose or rule the Law, 'gainst any Man; For Golden Sizzors clip Astrea's wings, And hath subverted ev'n the hearts of Kings. Be not in strife, nor have at all to doe With Men who vtter much, and little know. Converse not with the foole, lest it may be To thy dishonour in Posteritie. Despise not him who now reformes his waies, Nor Speake it to his Shame, what is his praise. Mock not at Eld, w?? Scurrill taunts &amp; vaine, 'Tis that which wee can but hope to Attaine. Let not thy foe's Death thee Exhilirate, For to all Mortall, 'tis an Equall Fate. Attend the Iudgments of Antiquitie; And prize her wisedome as the Nurserie Of Knowledge how to rectifie thy waies In vnderstanding, and to live with Praise. Goe not from what they teach, for 'tis to them Tradition, which from their Fathers came; They shall give knowledge in the fullest kind, And thou, their sayings in thy need shalt find. Rebuke a Sinner, doe not Arrogate His Crime; Sin vrg'd, not Seldome bringeth hate; Stand vp to accuse noe Man, Lest he may Returne it Backe, in somewhat thou shalt say. Lend not to Men in State or Dignitie Above thy selfe; or if thou gloriouslye Wilt soe court greatnes, let thy second thought Repent thy follye, and esteeme it nought. Be bond but to thy power; for if thou say, I will be bond, make full account to pay. Differ not with the Iudge in point of Law; For to himselfe the Honour he will draw. Admit with rash Men noe Societie; Rashnes presumeth on Sobrietie, To give offence; for he knowes only Will; And through his folly, thou art sure of ill. Contend not with the furious, neither be Vrg'd by his Scorne, to admit privacie; For blood he valews not, &amp; thou shall fall To his good Arme, haveing noe help at all. Advise not with the foole, he will betray Thy Secrets, in what ever thou shalt say. Let not a Stranger privacies attend; Hee sees &amp; knowes, but thou not knowst his end. Make not the Vulgar privy to thy Mind; (For Popularitie is Still inclin'd To freedome) soe, thy secrets are betraide, And thou a Scandall to the world art made. Chap. ix. Harbour noe Iealous feares against thy Wife, Nor give to her suspition, by thy Life. Let not a Woeman too much Captivate Thy life, lest she betray thee to the hate Of enemies. Avoid the Company Of blushles Woemen, lest thou fall and Die. Let not a voice, nor exact Motion Betray thee to thy owne Confusion. Detract not from a Virgin's Modestie, To fixe vpon her with a fervent Eye. Fall not a Prey to wantons, nor be tooke By a lasciuious Iest, or winning looke; Lest it, perhaps, redound to thy Shame, And leave a blott vpon thy house &amp; Name. Walke not to looke on Beauties, nor enquire After faire Woemen, to provoke desire; Reverse thy burning Eye from the desir'd Obiect of Beautie, though to be admir'd; For many have fall'n soe; 'tis by thy Eye, The fire is kindled to vnchastity. A sinfull Woeman shall be trod as dung, And have a bitter Scorne from every tongue; Many have fal'n to Sin, in a Strange looke, Fixt on her Eyes, taken with what she spoke. Allow not freedome with another's Spouse, Vse not with too much frequency her house; Let, Let, the curbe of Modestie restraine Her bed to thee, though in an Entertaine, Intended Civill; and the needless stay Of Banquetting admit not; lest there may In vaine protractions, such occasions be As may entice thy will and ruine thee. Leave not a provéd freind; for an Ignote Comes but at hazard, seldome proves in ought Like him who was; but as in Wine new-prest, Time proves it good, and then wee drinke it best. Ayme not at Honours, nor in thought Aspire, To be as yon'd full Man; he shall expire But ev'n as thou, Charg'd with a greater debt; And what he is, nor you nor he knowes yet. Affect not wickednes, as Sinners doe, But thinke, thy Account needs must greater grow. Keepe from the Man of Blood; soe shalt thou be Safe from the feare of Death or Iniurie; But if thou happen soe, give noe offence To stir his fury; thinke, without defence, Thou art Surround in danger; every Side Snares to entrap thee; &amp; thou dost bestride Horror in every space; thou maiest fall downe To certaine Ruine, ignorant how soone. Be ware thy Neighbour's malice, and enquire Counsell of Wise men; quicken thy desire To have converse with Men who can afford Sacred Instructions, how to serve the Lord. Let Iust Men be thy Guests, let thy Ioy Be only in the feare of the Most High. Artists are pris'd and prais'd by what they doe; And the Wise Prince, in his owne word shall know The Gen'rall suffrage. Wise Men valued are Not for fine words, but for the Sence they beare. A Man of many words doth breed debate, And hee that bolts at all, the World shall Hate. Chap. x. An vnwise King the People shall Lament, But where there is a goodly government, Where vpright Men sit in Authoritie, Then, shall the Cittie see Prosperitie. God doth dispose of Rule, and in his Eyes How despicable are Iniquities; And though he suffer now, at his good time, The Rulers shall be Iust, &amp; free from Crime. The fate of Man is in th' all-gvidinge hand, He makes the learnéd in his honour stand. Forgive thy Neighbour's trespass, and let not Thy thoughts be busie in a wicked Plott. Pride before God and to an Equall Man, Is in both Sin; hate all, in Each as One. Crownes are dispos'd, and often have translation From this to that, from that to th' other Nation; Because of wrongs, Iniustice, wrested lawes, Oppressions, Tyrrannies, or some such cause. Nothing less worthy, in the highest eyes, Then Man, besotted on his avarice. Why art thou proud? oh! thou of humane birth! Thou art but Ashes, or at the best, but Earth; There is not, cannot be, a viler thing, Then to love Money; such a Man would bring His Soule to Mercate; for his Life, his Name Are gone, in being Slave to his owne shame. Tyrrany raigns not long: as the disease Pussles the Doctor, difficult to Ease, Hee tries a desperate Cure in such a need; Soe, hee, to-Day a King, to-Morrow, Dead; Why (Dust), then, art thou Proud? when Man doth fall, Hee falls to Serpents, Beasts, to Wormes; and All The beginning of Man's Pride is to decline ffrom God, and make a Iest of things devine; Pride is the fount, but rises at the streame, And still growes higher, till in the Extreame It overflowes, &amp;, like a Torrent's vent, Doth ruine such as stand to try the Event. Smear'd in the foulnes of his Sin, the advice Of wicked Men shall perish in a trice. God hath cast downe the thrones of Maiestie And haughty Kings, t' advance humilitye; The Proud of Nations he doth Contemne, And gives the lowly to inhabite them; He hath subverted where the Heathen lurke, And vtterly demolishéd their worke; They wither in his sight and fall away, Nor shall their Memorye any longer stay. The Proud Man's soule shall perish, only he Of humble Soule shall shine in Dignitie. In Men Pride was not ever, neither hath The weaker Sex beene still accite to Wrath. Children that feare God shall haue honour in Their Daies; &amp; such shall suffer in their Sin, As doe reiect his Lawes; for as the place Conferreth Honour, soe doth ever Grace. Crownes flourish in the feare of God, Decline Where Pride and Tyrranny doe madly Ioyne. His feare is Glory to the Greatest Name, Not less then to a Man of Obscure ffame. Shall Povertie obscure an able Mind? Or 'cause another's wealthy, shall he find Honour and praise of Wisedome? he, a foole? This can not stand to an Indifferent Soule. The King, the Iudge, and the Gown'd Magistrate, Are honourable, but there's none more Greate Then he that fears God, Vnto Servitude. Free-men, attend, if Gracious &amp; Endued With Knowledge. Hee who knowes will not disdaine Councell; but fooles noe honour can attaine. Necessity admits of noe delay, Be resolute, though in a cumbrous way. Better the Drudge, who in his Plenty stood, Then the Gay man that wanteth for his food. Let thy humility adorne thy Browes, And thinke thy selfe noe better then thou knowes. Who will account him iust that wrongs him selfe? Or honour him who thrusts his Soule on Shelfe Of Preiudice? The Poore, 'cause he is wise Is honor'd; &amp; the rich, Men will despise, For what he has. How more then worthy hee Whose honour Shineth in his Povertie, When he shall be of State! &amp; how much more Shall he be Abiect, when he is but Poore, Whose wealth was all his vertue! Then his Name Dyes with his story, perisheth as it came. Chap. xi. Wisedome exalts the humble, gives him place With Men of Honour. For the outward face Let not a Man be praiséd, nor despise A Man deforméd; for he may be wise; For loe, the Bee, a despicable thing, Almost the least of Creatures haveing wing, Yet in her fruit most faithfull. Bee not thou Proud of gay Rags, nor beare a haughty Brow, When th' art in Place of honour; for alone The workes of God are Glorious and vnknowne. Tirants haue fal'n, &amp; to possess the Throne, Hee, from obscuritie, hath chosen One. Great Men have fal'n to Shame, &amp; he of Note Hath beene deliver'd to a Stranger's vote. Rashly blame noe man; but with mature heed, Iudge and reforme it. Be not blindly led To give thy vote ere the cause be full told; And patiently heare both, nor hott, nor Cold; Intrude not for a faction, or to raise Vnheard of Doubts. What boots a sinfull praise? Intend not diverse things. Shun busines Almost at all; at least, hate the Excesse; For if thou profit, all thy gaines not gott, Thou art corrupted, or at least soe thought; Thou shalt not keepe thy Reputation free, In Eyther way, to follow or to flee. Those come of God, Attend vpon his breath: Prosperous or adverse fortunes, Life or Death; Riches &amp; Povertie; Wisedome is his, And the right vse of Sacred Knowledges. Love &amp; good-Workes of him are precedent, Error &amp; Darknes Sinners circumvent; And they that Magnifie their follies done Wax Gray in Sin, past all recurement gone. The Iust inherite blessings, which shall be Vpon thy house, to all Posteritye. Some Man is rich by his owne Miserie, And that's the wages he shall ever see; In that he wanteth it his owne acquist, Nor thinketh further; ffond Man! whither is't Sin drives thy Soule? Behold the Time is nere, That thou must leave it All; thou knowest not where, Nor less, to whom. Feare God, &amp; entertaine Thy Age in a good Worke, nor have a vaine Inquisitive Eye to others; what they Doe 'Tis not at all to thee; but Iustly goe In thy owne way. By the full hand of Heaven Wealth to the needy suddainly is given. The Iust shall prosper and shall live in Peace, With an aboundant Store &amp; large encrease. Be not then you too wise, in [vanitye] With heaven to say, what either shall it be, Profit or Pleasure? what shall I expect, Another day, gverdon to my respect? I swim in Pleasure, I have wealth at will, 'Tis not in ffate, that I can suffer ill. Ah, ffoole! collect thy selfe, &amp; thinke there may Darke Clouds of want invelope the bright Day. Be not deiect in Miserie, for know God can give succour, &amp; can give it now. In greatest need, the small time of an houre, To Man, if but his fortunes seeme to lowre, Is tedious; he falls beneath the Load, But 'tis the End that Crown's the Labour Good. Iudge noe Man happie till he be declin'd, Then see and Iudge as he hath left behind; In them he shall suruiue. Be Hospitable But not to All; some Man is sociable To get advantage on thee; in his breath Rise many vapours, Noxious to the Death. As secure Innocence, not dreading harme, The Silly Partridge run's into the Charme The fouler sett; or as the Hind is ta'ne In the strong Toyle, soe waits the sinfull Man To see thy fall; and laies his Machine at Thy fame; and from thy worth doth derogate, With feirce invectives. Sparkes ingender fire And Shame encreaseth, tho? rais'd by a Lyar; And he still aggravates. O, Son! beware And Shun the Wicked Man, who setts a snare How to surprise thee; if too intimate Thou with an Alien be, repent it late; In his Seditions, in thy owne vnrest And greife, to See him of thy state Possest. Chap. xii. In Almes respect to whom, that a reward May waite thy Charity. Be still prepar'd To Succour the Iust Man; this shall accrue To treble recompence, &amp; find it's due; Though not perhaps from him, it shall be giv'n, (Heaven being engaged) by the hand of Heav'n. What can of good come to the Waiward Man, Practis'd in Mischeife? or what evill can Be absent in Oppression? Let thy hand Be stretcht to assist vertue; but withstand The vrgencyes of Sinners. Help the Meeke; And let the impious want of what they seeke. Draw back thy willing hand, fraught w?? an Almes, Withold thy Charitie; (lost in the Calmes Of Secure Innocence, thou safely rideing; The gust of Sin, may Stir a Surly tiding, In Seas pacificke) he will lye in waite, For thy destruction; Quiet thy love with hate. Give to the Good (such Almes are never vaine) But let the Wicked aske, &amp; not obtaine. In the bright day of Plenty, every Man Will be a freind; 'tis difficult to Scan Who truly are soe; but in the darke Cloud, Of Adverse ffortunes' when as wants doe shrow'd Men in the Mists of Povertie, 'twill be Apparent Who's a freind, who Enimie. For when a Man in Plenty is, then those Maligne &amp; grudge his fortune who are foes; And in the Day, the black &amp; Dismall Day, Of Want and Miserie, hardly freinds will stay. Be circumspect &amp; Cautele to thy foe; For like as Iron rusteth, Ev'n soe His Soule is tainted, though he carry faire In all deportments; yet (My Son) beware; Be not too free to him, least he supplant Thy Iust designes; let not him, Arrogant, Sit on thy Right Hand, as pre-eminence; And he, soe bladder'd, doe not spare offence, To thy preiudice, &amp; vsurpe what's thine; And thou (too late) recall these words of mine, Into thy Memory; &amp; thy vext Soule Find torture in thy rashnes. For what foole Soe tender pitties, if the Charmer be Stung by a Serpent? or the temer'tie Of Such as, willing, will assault the Wild Of furious Bruits, Although he should be kill'd? Ev'n such a one is he, who doth attend The Sinner in his waies; &amp; shall he find A Pittie more? Sinners south thee in Sin, But they fall off, if ever thou begin To shrinke the least. As Honey, or more sweet And melting, Are the words of ffraud &amp; Spight, But inwardly as Gall: his Eyes shall be Stor'd w?? false tears, in remorse of thee; But if he find (what cannot Malice find!) His opportunity to goe beyond Thy honest reach, ought to thy preiudice; Then, then, he falls, &amp; blood will not Suffice. Happ'ly in adverse fortunes, he will be Pretending help, but plotting treacherie; Then, in derision, will he shake his head, And Clap his hands, Applauding what he did; Whisper to thy dishonour, &amp; his face fforméd to revile thee, in thy owne disgrace.

Hee that doth handle Pitch cannot be free, But pertake of its foulenes; neither hee Whose Intimate is proud, &amp; of a mind Haughty &amp; scornfull, but will be enclin'd Or possest with it wholly. Never seeke A burthen 'bove thy Power; doe not recke Thy selfe the wiser, to b' Associate With those who are beyond thee in Estate; For with what safety doe those Vessells stand, The Chaldron &amp; a pot of Earth? A hand By accident but stirring Each to Each, Needs must the Brittle suffer in the Breach. The Rich man he has done an Iniurie, Yet stands vpon his Act Imperiouslie, And threatens more; but the Poore is wrong'd And yet he Supplicates to be atton'd. If vsefull to thy great freind, thou art his, But if vnnecessary, hee'le despise Thy very Name; hee'le feast it at thy Table, And take thy Spoile; but when thou art not able To subsist longer, 'twill not be his care, To pitty or give comfort or repaire; If he have need, oh! then he smooth's his brow, Hee fawn's &amp; smiles, and askes thee, what want'st thou? Promises mountaines, brings thee to his feast, And doth subvert thy Reason, in thy Tast; Till twice or thrice, or till at least th' art worne In his occasions; then thou art his Scorne; Hee knowes thee not, will shun thee on his way, And shake his Head, scorning what thou dost Say. Beware the words of Greatnes, lest thou fall Ignorant of their plots; or, if thou shall Suffer the Court of Greatnes, and be prest With many Invitations, as his Gvest; Keepe at thy Guard of distance, and the more He shall Importune what he sought before; Press not vpon him, lest thou be his Scorne, Nor stand too distant, least thou be forlorne: Seeke not with him to vse the libertie Of Speech, nor have too much Credulitie Vnto his many words; for w?? the vaine Emptines of much Speech hee'le entertaine And hold thee Captive; or, as nothing were, Sift from thee what thou knowst, w?? a Cheere, Intending honesty, and search thy Heart Thorough w?? Smiles; then leaue thee where thou art, In the thick chase of Ignorance, that while Hee takes advantage, and doth seeke to Spoile Thee in thy owne; and at another Day, Thou art the Author of what he shall Say. Be Circumspect; for 'tis an anxious way, And let thy Soule listen to what I say: “While thou hast Life, love him, the gratious giver, “And Invocate salvation thence for ever. Beasts seeke and love in kind; &amp; Amitie Cometh to Men from their Proximitie. All Creatures Ioy in Kind, &amp; Man w?? Man; For what Alliance, what relation Hath the gant Wolfe w?? the Innocent Lamb? Soe Sinners w?? the Righteous the same; What 'twixt those ferals of Societie, Hiena and the Dog? or what can be Betwixt the Rich &amp; Poore? As the wild Asse Stands but a Prey in the great Wildernesse, To surly Lyons; soe the Rich devour The Innocent, &amp; tread vpon the Poore. As the Proud Man the humble soule doth hate, Soe doth the Rich the needie Execrate. A Rich Man, though in something he decline, Has freinds t' assist, but the poore in vaine May expect the ayde of freinds; for he has none. A Rich man taxéd, he has every one Readie to vindicate him; he dare say Forbidden things, and haughtily display His words to Treason; yet hee's Iustified. The poore, he Slipt, &amp; every tongue could chide, And give a sharpe reproofe. How often has Hee vtter'd wisedome? yet could gaine noe place. All Men are silent to a rich Man's voice, And they extoll his wisedome to the Skyes; But if a poore Man speake (oh, abiect state! And in opinion, how vnfortunate!) Every Man darts at him in Spight, and say What fellow's this? and if he stumble, they Rush to his overthrow. Good, doubtles, are Riches to those, (if such?) as doe not share In Evill that attends it. What disgrace Doe Sinners put vpon a poore Man's case! The disposition of the heart is read Vpon the forehead; for the heart is glad, Lends a bright aspect, and doth give the Eye Language t' Express a Man's Prosperitie. The sence of hidden Misteries to find, Is difficult, and to a Troublous Mind. Chap. xiv. Thrice happie he who has not beene betray'd To sin by vanitie, in what he said; Whose Soule is Innocent, whose Conscience Doth truly Iustifie; whose Confidence Is fixt in his Creator. How vnmeet And vnproportionable is the sweet Fruition of much treasure to a Mind Penurious and Enviously enclin'd! The vniust vsurer shall have an heir To lavish out the wealth he bought soe deare, Still vex't in the sad Mortgage. Vnto whom Can he be freind, who to himselfe is none? “Slaveing his Soule, &amp; euen his wealth shall be “(Though hap'ly fullnes) noe felicitie. There is none worse then he, whose ranc'rous Spleene Falls on himselfe, the gverdon of his Sin; For what he doth of Good (if good at all May rise from Sin) 'tis preiudiciall To him the more, being against his will; And he, i' th' end, shall know his good was ill. The Envious Man hath a Malignant Eye, Despiseth others, turnes his face awrye, In a detracting Scorne. What mountaines can Of vnsumm'd Treasure satisfie the Man Of Avarice? an obiect, 'bove Expence Is not sufficient for his outward Sence To fixe vpon; till ev'n his Soule shall be Wither'd and drie, in his Iniquitie. A Wicked Eye doth grudge his bread to Men, And gives a faint, if any Entertaine. My son Attend: According to thy Power be thy owne ayde, And paye thy vowes which thou to God hast made; For thinke 't must be, &amp; thou not knowest how soone, The houre of Death, when thy flesh shall goe downe Into the Pit; and thou art ignorant, What shall be sentence there. Be adiuvant, When it is acceptable, to thy freind, When thou yet art; and before thou discend, Let the Poore have an Almes. Oh! doe not thou Neglect the good day, but when Time is, now, Take all occasion that thy workes may be Thy owne availe; for can Eternitie Be here at all? Shall't thou not one day fall? (Ah dismall Day) and leaue thy store of All Vnto another? And then shall he not Devide thy sweat and Travell by a Lot? Give and Receiue, &amp; let thy soule be blest In thy good Deeds, ere yet thou goe to Rest; For in the Grave they End. All flesh shall be Old as a garment; for 'tis the decree (Irrevocable sentence) which heaven hath Ordain'd for ever, Thou shalt Dye the Death. “As on a Tree, the verdant Leaves Dispred, “Some Spring and flourish, some are witheréd “And fall to nothing; soe Mortalitie “Hath revolutions: now subsisteth he “In Excellence and strength, but cannot long; “He dyes, another comes, as ffaire, as strong: “Thus Ages passe; and everie Action “Decays in Time, as he, the Actor's gone. Happie then Hee, who doth Contemplate things Of Wisedome, and adds to his Reason Wings (Strong Wings) of faith, to attaine Misteries Of Sacred Knowledge. He that in her waies. Doth rectifie his heart, shall seeke her Light Through Ambages, as one that lyes in waite. Be curious in her search,—try every way, Prye through the windowes, at the Doore stay. Hee that doth truly seeke her, with Attent And serious Care, shall flourish in a Tent Adioyning her bright Mansion; and shall rest His head vpon a Couch, for ever blest; His Children shall surviue vnder her sheild, And lodge in the Coole Shade her branches yeild; In her shall he be blest, and leave his Name Exemplar to the World, Glory to ffame. Chap. xv. “Workes are the perfect Index to a Mind; He that fears God will ever be inclin'd To performe Acts of Mercy; and the Iust Shall attaine Knowledges. As to the lost Son of her Wombe, a Mother runs w?? Ioy, Soe will she meet him; or as lovingly As doth the virgin Bride, whose Chaster Eye ffix't with her thoughts, hates all varietye. The Bread of Vnderstanding shall be 's food, And he shall drink, drawne from the precious flood Of Wisedome, flowing Cups; in a firme Rocke She will support him, 'gainst the thund'ring shock Of Malice; he shall trust to her, and she shall be A safe-guard; give him Dignitie, 'Bove other Men; and teach him what to say, When Euerie Eare gapes in a solemne Day. His Browes shall beare a Ioyfull Diadem, And he surviue in an Immortall ffame. But not the Sinner thus: for he shall ne're (Much less Possesse her) stand in veiw to see her; For (ah) how distant shee! How far remote From Pride is she, and strangers know her not. For in the Mouth of Sin, 't doth not accord With Wisedome,—she proceeding from the Lord. For Man in Wisedome speaketh sentences Tending to goodnes, which the Lord will blesse. “Accuse not God as Author of thy Sin, “'Tis hatefull to his Soule; say not agin “He did subvert thy frailtie; for noe vse “Standeth the sinfull-Man to, in his house; Hee sin despiseth, and he loves it not,— “The Man that feares his Maker as he ought. “God at the first made Man, &amp; did Commit “Him to his Counsell, Reason, Will, and Witt; “To walke in his waies of Truth, at his owne will; “To Chuse or this, or that, or good, or ill. “Loe he hath giv'n thee freedome to thy Choice; “Water or ffire, take thy owne advice: “Soe Life and Death are thine alike, and shall “Be at thy likeing given; for beyond All, “The Wisdome is of God; his power as great; “And seeing all things from his glorious Seat, “To Such as feare him hath a tender Eye. “He knowes the workes of Men, the privacye “Of every heart. Sin is not by his will; “He nor Commands it, nor allowes of ill. Chap. xvi. Desire not many Children; if they be Vngodly, thinke it noe felicitie To have such store; for some are only giv'n, True blessings, when they feare the Lord of Heauen: Let not thy hopes live in them; better farre Is one Son Iust then Multitudes w?? are Froward and sinfull. Better 'tis to Die Summed in himselfe, then leave a Progenie Of Wickednes: for one of Wisedome shall Populate Nations, but the Wicked fall To Nothing suddenly; Ev'n these, my Eyes, Have seene such things; but greater far then these, Our Fathers have reported. In the Congresse Of Sinners, fire shall flame &amp; never cease. Wrath shall Devour the haughty Nation, As ruthles fire. Those Men of high renowne, Giants in Ages past, who fell away In folly of their owne strength, they, ev'n they, Have knowne his fury: neither was againe That City Spar'd, where Lot did entertaine Two Angells; but aboundant vengeance was, In ffire and Brimstone, rainéd on the Place, The City Sodome. His vnrelenting Eye Did see the wicked fall away and Dye; That mighty hoast, (sixe hundred Thousand Men) Despising Heauen, summonéd to profane The power of God; yet they haue felt his wrath. And if but one in thousands of a faith Repugnant, he shall not for ever be Vnpunishéd; for these are, Equally “In him, Mercy &amp; Wrath: he can forgiue “Beyond all Crime; but if the sinner live “Obstinate in Offence, his Clemencie “Is then reverst; he thunders, &amp; they die. “Both equall in him, and both Infinite, “Rewarding Men, as they doe wrong or right. The Man of Rapine shall not have his prize Secure for euer; but the Iniuries Which he did, Whilome, shall be iudgéd now: The Righteous, contrarie, shall one day know Reward for all his suff'rings: ev'n the least Of Charitie shall have reward; for Blest “Or Reprobate, God finds Mortalitie “In their good-workes, or their Iniquitie. Hee made obdure the heart of y? proud King Pharoh, that his more Glory thence might Spring, To all the World, with terror seen and knowne; Vnseene by him, unknowne by him alone. Full in his Mercy t' euery liveing thing, He did his Light, from shades of darknes bring. Say not, oh say not thou! I will obscure, In desart place, my selfe, and be secure From vengeance. Shall God remember mee From Heaven? Poore Atome of Mortalitye! Shall I (noe I will 'scape) amongst soe many Be mark't for Iustice? &amp; from his Eyes can I Not slip away? In such a throng of Soules Mine is not seene to. Thus the voice of Fooles! But, loe! the Heauens, and those Imperiall Skyes, The Sea, the Earth, and all that therein is, Shall tremble when he cometh; Mountains Shall, And Hills Inferior, the foundations all Of Earth, be rent with horror, when his Eye Shall fix vpon them. Noe heart Worthylye Can conceiue these things. Who of humane birth Can apprehend his waies? or who set forth? 'Tis as a Tempest w?? Man cannot see; For his workes most are in obscuritie. Who can (meer Dust and Ashes) set to Light His workes of Iustice? or sustaine the waight, Who can, the strongest? for his Covenant Is a farre off, beyond the Arrogant Designe of Mortalls; the exact probation Of vertue knowne is in the Consamation. Hee that wants Knowledge will be busied In triviall things, and the foole, Misled, Runs headlong on. My Son, heare what I Say; Give Serious Attention, let thy heart weigh And prize my words; I will give documents Of great availe, and to the diligent Propose an exact lesson. See from first The workes of God in Iudgment are rehearst; And from the Instant of Creation, He gave the parts their disposition. Hee did adorne his workes; and in his hand, Eternally doe their beginnings stand; They flourish ever, by the breath of heaven; They never sweat to live, but have it given, Without or toyle, or Travell; none of them Disturbeth other; they are still the same; They grudge not Heaven's decree. After this done, The Great Creator graciously look't downe Vpon the Earth, and by his Powerfull breath, Hee gave an Ample Blessing; coveréd hath Her face with liveing Creatures, from Earth borne, And shall (soe God ordain's) to earth returne. Chap. xvii. From Earth, God forméd Man, and shall Convert Him into Earth againe; his Life is Short, Haply but a few dayes; he gave him power Over all things, which were on Earth before; He gave him strength in Bodie, as in Mind: Form'd him to his owne Image; all the Kind Of Birds &amp; Beasts in his Dominion, Or what soe els, to fall to him alone. He gave him perfect vse of every sence, And Reason, beyond All, for Excellence; Discourse t' express himselfe; he did impart Councell to him, &amp; Eyes &amp; Eares; a heart To vnderstand; which heart he then did fill With Knowledge; shew'd them what was good, what ill. He set his Eye vpon their hearts, that he Might more Illustrate soe, &amp; dignifie His workes vnto them; that to them 't might be Perpetuall glorie, and a Memorie For Ever, of his Power; &amp; they, the Choice, Shall praise his Name for Ever, with a voice Of gladnes. Knowledge he to them doth give; And for an Heritage, the Law of Life. He made a Covenant with them for ever; Shewed them his Iudgments; did, in like, discover The greatnes of his glorie to their Eyes; And with their Eares they heard his glorious voice, Instructing thus: Beware oppression And all Iniustice. He gave euery Man A rule of Charitie; vnto his sight Their waies are open, secrets stand in Light. Man, in the blossome is addict to Sin, Nor can they make for stony hearts agin, Their hearts of flesh. To every Nation he Has given a Ruler, but as his owne ffee, He hath reseru'd his Chosen, Israel: These there he Blesseth, ev'n there will he dwell. Perspicuous as the sun in his full shine, All humane Actions are to him; his Eyne Are fixt vpon their waies; nothing of wrong Is hid to him; the Crimes that doe belong To all Mortalitie, what Man has done, Hee knowes &amp; sees; but in Compassion, Hee being Infinite, Ineffable, And looking downe vpon the Despicable And worthless thing call'd Man, w?? tender Eye, Doth know his Creature; &amp; his Miserie Doth move remorse in him; of greater worth Then the broad Engine, which displaied forth, Argueth Dignitie. To God shall be Pure Almes, the seales of perfect Charitie. Neare as the Apple of the Eye, and Deare To God, the goode-Workes doth, of Man, appeare. His Sons and Daughters shall not fall away; But for the good-workes done, God shall repay Abundant Blessing. To the penitent He will be gracious; and the Patient Shall not for ever suffer. Oh! returne, Turne to the Lord, forsake thy sins, and mourne The folly of thy dayes; address thy praier To him alone, and rectifie, with Care, The remnant of thy Life. Oh! turne agin To the Most High, &amp; turne away from Sin: For he will bring thee from Cimmerian shade Of Error, where thou wast envelopéd, To the bright Raies of Knowledge, &amp; of Ioy; Therfore detest sin. Who, to the Most High, Involvéd in the womb of Earth, shall sing A Song of Praise? there being noe such thing In that Sad Mansion: Therfore, now alive, While now Time is, let prompt desires giue Expressions to his Praise. In what yo? doe, How doth the Lord his loueing kindnes show To humane frailtie! hath Compassion To their offences; for perfection The Mortall is not: Imortalitie Is only perfect. What can the strong Eye See brighter then the Sun? Yet in God's Sight It is but Dim. How then those Acts of Night, Those Horrid Crimes of Mortalls Shall appeare Vgly and Monstrous, vile, deform'd, vncleare? Hee veiwes the Host of Heaven; Man, dust &amp; Earth, Hee knowes to be fraile, ever from his Birth. Chap. xviii. Hee who was ever first, made every thing; Hee only Iust is; He's the invict King, Who guides the vniverse: What Man shall dare To speake his Power? Who can his Acts declare? How farre beyond the Tongue of flesh to say His Glories? or his Mercies to display? Great in his workes, vnspeakeable; and Man May not impaire or Derogate; nor can He (Blamelesse) amplifie; for 'tis inscrute: His power, 'bove reach of Mortall to find out; When Man has done, then doth he but begin; And when he leaves, ten thousand doubts come in, To oppose his resolves. What, what is Man? Or to what vse ordain'd? what good can In him at all be? What's his good? what ill? Vncertaine date of Mortalls, w?? but will Allow at most (and ah how many feares Crosses and Dangers waite!) a hundred yeares: As to the boundless waters of the Sea, One Drop; or as to th' Sands Infinitie, A Peeble is; soe (if it soe much be) A thousand years are to Eternitie. Therfore God Patient is, &amp; doth dispence Aboundant Mercy in his præscience. He saw Man's frailtie, did Commiserate His Miserie. Man but forbears to hate (If soe) his Neighbour, and 'tis Charitie, He thinkes, Sufficient. If our God should be Rigorous to Mankind, who, what flesh could stand? But as in all, soe Mercy at his hand Is Infinite; to All as vnto one, (If they implore,) without Distinction; He doth rebuke, Correct, &amp; Teach, as doth (But with a Heauenly care) the Sheepheard (loath To see) his straying flocks revert their course To his owne Downes; soe Hee, he hath remorse Vnto the Humble; loves the Penitent, And those who in his worke are diligent. Let not thy Manners blemish thy good Deeds; Give gladly of thy store to him that needs, Without a Taunt. Doth not the dew allay The violence of Heat? soe alsoe may A word remunerate, &amp; sometimes more Then will thy gift; hap'ly then all thy store: I, 'tis of value more; but Equall these Proceede from Iustice; only fooles not Cease T' vpbraid Povertie; &amp; the froward Eye Of Envie grudgeth his owne Charitie. Know ere thou Speake; &amp; take the Cordiall To prevent Sicknes; In-antidotall Protraction, makes it; Ere the Day be yet Of Iudgment, trye thy Soule &amp; open it; That in the Day, the Day of visitation, God may looke on thee w?? Propitiation. Be ever humble, lest at vnaware Sicknes surprise thee; let noe Time deferr Thy Penitence: Let, let noe vaine delay Hinder thy vow, w?? thou hast yet to pay. Labour, while 'tis now Day; doe not Suspend Thy Reformation to the Last, thy End. Pray, but prepare thy selfe readie to Pray; Precogitate thy vowes; &amp; doe not Say “From a fantastick humor, what will rise; “Such vaine Hypocrisies, doth God despise. “Thinke (in securitie,) the Day will come “Of wrath, when thou shalt vndergoe the doome “Of Heaven. Remember, sated, there may be “A Time of Hunger. In prosperitie “Forget not penurie; for, (ah) how soone, Ere morneing-Sun attaine the height of Noone, Strange alterations! but the shortest thought Of Time sufficient is, when God has brought His Power to Act. A wise Man will observe A rule of Order, Time, and still preserve His Soule vnspotted, in the Day of Sin; But fooles Consider neither how nor when. A Wise Man taketh Wisedome from the tongue Of other Men; and gives, as doth belong, Glory to him, &amp; praise to what he said; Allowes Equallityes, and therby, made In himselfe stronger, can now vtter things, High things, of Wisedome. Curbe the wandrings Of thy vnbridled will; let thy desires Fall to thy Nobler Reason, which aspires, Nere to perfection. If thy Soul, vncurb'd, Run in thy follies, solace vndisturb'd, Vnder the shade, vnder the spreading shade, Of fond affections; then thou art betray'd, A Scorne to such as hate thee. Never be A Skillfull Glutton; let not Luxurie Soe farre inthrall thee, to preiudicate Thee by the Wasting of thy owne Estate. 'Tis too too costly fin! Oh, Moderate That sensuall folly when 'tis not too late; Lest to thy selfe thou fall, &amp; falling, Dye, And Dye, forgotten but to Infamye. Chap. xix. Hee who doth earne his liveing in his Sweat, And is a Drunkard, certaine shall not get Riches at all; and he who small things shall Not value, will even by those littles fall. Wine, and the allurements of the weaker Sex Subvert the Wisest; but he who doth prefix A Ioy in sinfull Woemen, to his thought, He shall be Reprobate, &amp; fall to nought; He shall be worne with ranke Infirmities, Corrupt, and made Exemplar to the Eyes Of other Men; Contagion in his Breath; Fear waits him liveing, Horror at his Death. The Credulous, the Easie Credulous, Is of a wauering soule, &amp; what he does Of Sin, is 'gainst his owne soule. Who delights In wickedness shall fall; but the vpright, Whose soule despiseth pleasure, he shall be Crown'd in his daies, with true felicitye. “He that can curbe and Moderate his tongue “Shall live in Peace, &amp; from contention “Be still exempt. Doe not at all rehearse “What thou hast heard from others, &amp; thy fears “Shall neuer multiply; Whether it be “Vnto thy bosome freind, or Enimie, “Descant not vpon others, nor reveale “His Life, or Manners, to detract at all; “For he will heare it, and to thy disgrace “(Soe times may vary) he will read thy Case. “If thou hast heard of ought 'gainst any Man, “Let it Dye with thee, vtter 't not againe. A Foole is full, and laboureth with a word, As Woemen that bring forth; even as a sword Or Dart infixéd, Mortall, it shall rest A Torment to the Foole in his owne Breast. “Advise thy freind, it may prevent his Crime, “And rectifie his life; admonish him, “Hap'ly he yet not said it; or it may “Prevent to Itterate what he did say; “Still be a freind and giue thy freind advise; “ffor many times a slander may arise. “Trust not to every Rumor; he may be “Belied in Malice, wrong'd iniuriouslye. “The tongue may wander often, when the heart “Is innocent, not guilty to a part. “For who? what Man of Earth can vindicate “What he hath Spoken? Whose Tongue neuer yet “Hath beene Irregular? Reprove, but Spare “To threaten any Man; and let thy Care “Be to the law of God; to feare him right Is the first Step of entrance to his Sight: For this is Wisedome; This shall gaine his Love. The Notion of his Law doth make Man move In the bright Sphœre of Life; &amp; happie they Who not transgress his Law, but doe and say Things to his pleasure congrous; they shall be Blest in the fruit of Immortalitie. The feare of God is fullnes; in it, is The Law performéd. If a servant rise Obstinate to his Master, and denys To performe his Commands, yet, happilye Vpon a second thought, doe it, shall not The Master frowne, &amp; haue a troubled thought? Wicked Experience neuer maketh wise; Nor to be frequent at the Priuacies Of Sinfull Counsell shall a Man attaine Discretion. There is a Sin shall gaine A Curse for ever; and there is a foole Defective to the point; yet ev'n that foole, If he feare God, is better, ten times better, Then a Wise Man, if he transgress the letter Of God's Eternall Law. There is a Witt Of Subtletie, pregnant &amp; Exquisite, Which Sinners have; in like, there is one Wise, Whose Life is Iust. There is, who hangs his Eyes, Seeminge disconsolate and penitent, But his heart nothing less; his browes are bent In Sullen wrinkles, &amp; can faine him Deafe To all thou saiest; yet, ere thou perceiue, Hee will lay hold on thee, and though he be Not able then to doe thee Iniurie, Yet at the Time he shall. A Man may be Knowne by his looke, &amp; he of Prudencie Is by the Face discoueréd. The Attire How it is fitted, and the riseing higher Of foolish Passion, and the outward Iest; These please the Man, &amp; these express him best. Chap. xx. There is Rebuke; but 'tis beyond Rebuke, Which turnes to Wrath; advice should neuer looke With angry Eyes. There is who can containe, And he is Wise. 'Tis better to be plaine And give a faire reproofe, then to Maligne. He that Confesseth Sin shall have a Digne And full Reward; he shall not Suffer in His guilt, nor fall beneath the weight of Sin. As when an Eunuch burnes to satisfie His Lusts in wrack of some virginitie; Soe, soe Imperfect, doth that Iudgment stand When will pronounceth, ffury doth C?mand. How good a thing 'tis to be Penitent After reproofe! soe shalt thou not assent To Sin of Coustome. Some are slow to Speake, And provéd Wise; Another, he will breake Madly at all, e'ne to his owne Disgrace; And some Man silent is, because he has Not vnderstanding; and another, he Stayes till he find fitt oportunitie; Soe will the truly wise; but Idle heads Observe noe time, but as blind folly leads. The Babler is a Treacher to his Soule, And he whose vaine Ambition takes the sole Seat to himselfe of Honour, shall not be Secure in what he has. How happilye Designes of mischiefe prosper! but the Thing Found (a clear Treasure) doth not alwaies bring Its benefit entire; there may accrue A triple Damage in accounts of Due. Not everie guift behoofefull, some there are Repayed double. Some man doth impaire His proper Glorie in a faire pretence, But 'tis to gaine his name more excellence; Another, he pure in humilitye, Whose reall vertue gaines him Dignitie. Some Man for Small, doth purchase much &amp; boast His happie pennyworth, ere he know the Cost, To be repaied seven times. A wise man shall In his Discourse, gaine the Applause of All; But the vaine follies of the ignorant Shall be his Shame for ever. Doe not want Profitt in a foole's guift. Let not the Strong Ret'ricke of Envie, press a bounty on Thy Easie Nature; for his petty thing Engageth thee, and doth not seldome bring Seavenfold encrease; in broken sentences He will vpbraid thee, for his Courtesies; His Mouth glowes as a fire, he will, today, Lend voluntary, but he calls to pay The Morrow after, to thy preiudice: But such a Man is hatefull to the Eyes Of God &amp; Man. The foole shall have noe freind; His goods availe him not, for he doth Spend His bread to Schycophants: How oft! how oft! And by how many shall his name be Scoft! For though he live in an aboundant Store, He wants the vse, &amp; therfore is but poore. Safer to fall precipitate among Disordered stones, then wander with the Tongue; Soe wander the vnwise. A precept shall (If spoken by a foole) to nothing fall; For he considers neither Time nor Place, How it may come for Honour or Disgrace. Poverty hinders, want w?? holds from Sin, Els the desire is good to many Men; Yet such (ev'n for their wishes) when alone Shall have vnquiet Soules. Another one In his owne folly hurts his Soule, to be Familiar with the great ones. Courtesie Inviteth some to promise to a freind; Failing in which he gaineth at the End An Enimie. How shamefull is a Lye With any Man, yet is it frequently In a foole's Mouth. Better of the two ills A Thrift is, then a Man who daylie fills His Lips with falshood; but the portion Shall be to both, Death &amp; Destruction. A Lyar is vniust of Soule, and beares His shame still with him, but the wise man reares Trophies of Honour to himselfe, in what He vtteréd, and pleaseth men of State. The carefull husband seldome wanteth bread, But ioyes himselfe in the encrease he had, From gratefull Soyle. He that doth live vpright Shall be exalted. He who doth delight Great Men, shall mittigate his owne offence. Rewards &amp; Guifts obscure the nimble Sence Of the most Wise, &amp; binds the rageing Iawes Of Iustice, though to violate the Lawes. Wisedome conceal'd &amp; Treasure vnder barres What profit is in either? It appears More worthy in the Ignorant to be Silent, then when a sound abilitie Warrants Expression. Patience shall be crown'd, But him of stubborne Soule will God confound. Chap. xxi. Hast thou beene thralléd to the bonds of Sin? Quit thy Captivities; serve not agin Soe hard a Bondage, but repent in Time Which was mispent, that for thy former Crime Thou maiest remitted be; fly, fly away From Sin, as from a Serpent; if thou stay Too neare, it will devoure thee as the Iawes Of hungry Lyons, prompted by their Mawes; Such are the Tooth of Sin, strong to devour The Soules of Men, with an insatiate woure. Sin is a two-Edg'd Sword, which gives a wound Mortall to Death, and cannot be made sound. Contention is a Canker which doth wast The greatest store. The haughty shall not last For ever glorious; but the poore man's Praier Shall have accesse to the Eternall Eare; He shall avenge his cause. Who doth despise Reproofe or Councell standeth in his dies; But he whose Soule is season'd w?? a feare Of holy Things, his Conscience shall be cleare And vpright ever. The proud Orator And Subtle-Tongu'd Man, may be knowne a-farre Vpon his Tiptoes; but the truly Wise Sees when he falleth. He whose buildings rise From others' ruines, laboureth as doth he Who gathers stones his sepulture to be. The Assembly of the wicked are as flax Wrappéd together; and their End shall wax As an vnquenchéd fire. How plaine, how smooth Seemeth the way of Sinners, as he doth Repair it! but, alas, 'twill not prevaile! 'Twas but Hypocrisie; the End is Hell, Horror, &amp; Torment. He can governe best His Life &amp; Manners, who doth only rest To the Eternall Word; for holy feare Encreaseth Wisedome. He can never beare The yoke of Discipline who is not wise. There is an vntaught Wisedome whence shall rise The gall of Bitternes: but he shall be The truly wise, encreast aboundantlye In Knowledges like swelling Torrents; and His Councells permanent shall ever stand, Like a pure Spring of Life; as an vnsound And Leakeing vessell shall the foole be found; Ev'n to his heart, vncapable and weake To apprehend the sayings wife men Speake. A wise Man will allow another's word Of Truth &amp; wisedome; praise it, &amp; afford What ere he can t' encrease it; but the foole, He values nought, detracts, and gives a Scoule, In Scorne of Wisedome; he allowes nought good But what he Spoke, &amp; Noe Man vnderstood. How tedious is the Tongue of Ignorance, And hard to bear! but there is Excellence In what the wise man vtters; how intent The People are! how throng they to frequent The place where he shall Speake! &amp; treasure all He spoken has, that not a word shall fall. As is a house laied in her Ruines low, Wisedome vnto a foole is ev'n soe; And what he knowes, (if he know ought at all) He vtters without order, as 't shall fall. As fetters to the feet, or stricter bonds, Clapt furiously, &amp; Ioynted to the hands, Soe to a foole Instruction is; a foole Will stretch his Lungs, &amp; let his Passion roule In the rude garbe of Laughter, when he Speaks; But the Wise Man discoursing, hardly breaks A Simile in Secret. Learning doth adorne A wise Man more then all the Iewells worne By Princes at a Tryvmph. The rash foot Of folly presses in to Strangers, but A wise man knowes to visit, and will be Strict to his honour; the vntaught will see At every Chink or Crannie to the house, But the well educate will not doe thus. Illiterate folly listens at the doore, But the wise Man will scorne soe poore An Act, foe worthles of him; he will be Troubled to thinke of such Indignitye. A forward tongue will please to vtter things Impertinent, but (loe) the Wise Man brings His words to purpose. In their Mouth the heart Of fooles is ever, but a Wise Man's Art Ioynes to heart his Mouth. Vngodly Men, When they Curse Satan, vtter it agen To their owne Soules. The Mouth of bitternes And black detraction spitteth filthines Vpon his owne Soule, lives Contemn'd by all, And curséd to himselfe; But he who shall Be slow to Speak, &amp; of a perfect Mind, Hee shall be praiséd; He shall honour find. Chap. xxii. What profit hath the sluggard but disgrace, The stones of Scorne fall heavy on his face; He shall be soiled in the vnsavory Slime ffrom Dunghills gather'd; all Men yerne at him. Children are blessings; but if ill, the worst Of Miseries, to make a Father curst. That Woeman brings a Dower Sufficient Who bringeth Wisedome, the best Ornament. Impudence is not proper to the Sex, Nor Acts of boldness less; these shall perplex The Soule, &amp; stand the Iear of Infamie, To Father, &amp; to Husband Equallie; Her Name shall be disgrace, &amp; ev'n her freind, Her nearest freinds, shall hate her, in her end. As Sprightly Musiq? to the Sable Hearse When Hearts are Sad, ev'n soe the Tale appears, Vnaptly vtter'd: Wisedome doth direct Words to the Season, with a due respect. He that would teach the foole, his labour's lost As he that glews a pottsherd, broke to dust; Or he who calls a Man bound in the strong Fetters of Sleep, to listen to his Tongue. The vertue of a Child shall put away The Infamye of Parents; but if they Be haughty &amp; vntaught, they are disgrace (If Nobly borne) ev'n to the Noblest race. As he who tells grave counsells, secret things, To one asleep, soe laboureth he who Sings To a rude Eare; for when the Tale is done He askes the Matter, as if not begun. “Weep for the Dead, for he hath lost the light; “Weep for the foole, he vnderstands not right. “Vnto the Dead let not thy greife be much, “For he has gain'd his rest: but Life is such “Vnto the foole, soe poore, soe deplorable, “His Death is happines &amp; profitable. “Exequies to the Dead will but require “Seaven daies; but for the foole, till he expire: “His state is lamentable. Doe not partake In conference with ffolly, neither make Thy visits to the Ignorant, least thou Be priuie to his Sin. Depart &amp; goe Far from his Dwellings; soe thou shalt have rest, Nor shall the Noise of follie thee Molest. What is soe Dull? what heavier then lead? Only the foole is ev'n as Dull, as Dead. Sand, Salt, &amp; Iron, better are sustain'd Then the vnwise, or him who hath profan'd The Eternall God-head. As the ioynt doth make The Building strong, of Timber, 'bove all Shake Of violence to move it; Soe the heart Which firmed is by what the Wise impart, Fear cannot daunt: as Reeds vpon a Hill, Or Cimment vnpreparéd, never will A surly Storme resist, noe more a foole,— Whose heart surmiseth dangers,—have the rule Of his owne Passions, but gives way to fear, And often falls in thought of what they were. Who wounds the Eye brings tears, &amp; likewise he Who pricks the Heart brings forth the secresie. A stone directed to 'em, feares the Birds; Soe bitter Speeches violate the Cords, The Cords of Amitie. If Madly rash, Thou drewest a Sword against thy freind, to quash His very Life, fear not to be atton'd, And restored to his bosome. Hast thou Conn'd What Envy can Imagine, Malice Speake, Perfectly to thy lesson? &amp; soe breake To Scandall him? fear not, Implacable Freindship can never be, vnless thou bable Vniust reproaches, scornefull taunts, or be Haughtie, beyond familiaritie; Reveale his Counsells, or betray his Thought: These beyond freindship are; &amp; but these Nought. Be firme, in the low Ebb of Povertie, Vnto thy freind, that in Prosperitie Thou maiest reioyce w?? him; let not the Tide Of Tribulation move thee from his side, That thou maiest be with him, (&amp; soe the more As once in trouble) partner, now in store; For Povertie is not Contemptible In every Man; nor good, nor admirable, Is a foole for his Riches. As doe rise Vapours &amp; Smoake before the fire flies; Soe scornes, derisions, and opprobious words, Presage some busines for blood-thirsty Swords. I will defend the honor of my freind As my owne safetie; nor will I discend From him at all, although I suffer, I, In him will vndergoe all Iniurie; Let such as know it shun him; who shall keep A Guard vpon my Mouth? or seal my Lipp With Wisedome's Signet? that I suddenlye Fall not by them nor my tongue mee destroy. Chap. xxiii. O King of Heaven, whose Paternall care Doth governe &amp; direct the whole affaire Of my Mortalitie; doe not desert Mee to their Counsailes, neither let my heart Assent to them. Who? who will rectifie My cogitations? Who will Amplifie My heart to Wisedome? that I never Speake To give offence, that ffollies doe not breake, That Sins abound not, that I doe not fall Before my Enimie, who proudly shall Insult vpon my weakenes;—hee whose heart Contemneth thee. Oh! thou which ever art My Father, and the God of all my Strength, Leave mee not to their wills; quit mee at length From the proud hands of ffollie; D'sdainfull Eyes Give mee not (Lord), nor let proud thoughts arise W?? in my bosome; all the loose affects Of Lust &amp; Pleasure, or what flesh respects To Sensuality, Disperse as Dust. O let mee never fall to my owne Lust; Give me an humble heart, a prompt desire To doe thy will; let Vanitie expire. Heare, O you Children! listen to the Tongue Of Truth, Zealous to give Instruction; He who preserveth it, shall never fall In folly of his Mouth; nor ever shall His Life be Infamous. By his owne Lipps The Sinner falls, &amp; the Detractor Slipps To Death, in his owne words; let not thy Mouth Affirme by Swearing, matters of vntruth, For in it many falls are; doe not make Thy words more Efficacious to take The holy One to record; doe not call To witnes heaven nor Earth; swear not at all. For as a servant often punishéd Must beare a Scar, Soe who accoustoméd His mouth to Oathes &amp; Imprecations, Shall not be Innocent. A Man who grones In the Assidual Coustome to profane, Shall be repleat with Sin; the Plague shall raigne Within his walls, &amp; when he shall offend, Hee shall be gvilty, if he not repent; The Sin is Double if he Swear in vaine; Hee shall not be vnpunish't, but remaine In roofes contagious. There is another Sin To Death; God grant that it be never seene In Iacob's Heritage; but they will shun, Who feare the Lord, such profanation; Vtter not foolish things w?? a sweet tongue, It gives to Sin pregnant occasion. In seat of Honour, be not swolne too high To forget Parents, lest th' Eternall Eye Forget thee in their Sight; &amp; the abuse Of Place betray the foole beyond excuse; Plung'd in despair, wishing thou hadst not beene, Curseing the Day thy face was ever seene. The Man of Scorne &amp; of a bitter Tongue Will never (though his Time were twice as long) Be from his Sin reducted. There are two Two sorts of Men Sinfull, and boldly goe The beaten path; the Third produceth ire, And selfe-perdition, as a glowing fire; The insatiate Soule burnes till he shall Devour Those who (vnluckie) fall into his Power. Hee who adicts himselfe to wantonnes Raiseth a fire, by frailetie of his flesh, Gladding his thoughts, in all varietie; Nor will he leave his Sin till he shall Die: “Hee who doth violate the Sacred Vow “Of wedlocke, thus surmiseing, who, ah, who, “Shall see my Acts? am I not hemméd about “With Clouds of Darkenes? can the Eye find out “My Crime, Secur'd by a mighty wall “As Diamond Solid, where all Sence must fall “With repercussion, impenetrable? “How may I wanton here? Tush! 'tis a bable “And too too feminine to admit feare; “Whom should I feare? Mortall not see mee here; “Nor can suspect my loosenes, heauen's bright Eye; “Bright as the Sun-beames, if wee multiplye “Ten thousand times; yet brighter all his Crime, “And in Securitie Discover him. “Who sees the waies of all Men viewes the Deep “And the Interior parts, how all things Sleep “In humane breast; He who ere Time was, yet “Knew all things, and now Modellizéd fitt, “Sees with a carefull Eye; shall man b' exempt “And seclude from his Knowledge? his Attempt “Of Sin, for ever Safe? Noe, loe that Man “Shall suffer; to the World shall madly run As an vnbridled Colt, and fly for feare When ere he thinkes he falls vnto the Snare; Scornéd by Men, &amp; in himselfe Deiect, Because he did the Law of God neglect. And soe th' adultrous woman; for she first Hath disobeyed the Law, in that accurst; Againe, she has, (to Bastardize his heires And wrong Succession, for all his cares, To bring a Bratt begot in Spurious Sin From Stranger's loynes,) a foule offender bin, Against her Husband; thirdly, to her selfe, To wracke her Soule vpon the vgly Shelfe Of black Adulterie; to prostitute A sinfull Bodie for a shamefull fruite; The People shall detect her, and her Sins Shall suffer strict examinations; Her Children shall not prosper, neither may't Be that a Branch from her can propagate; She shall Survive in a bespotted Name, And Time shall never Raze her Sin nor Shame; Only the Iust shall know the Benefitt To feare the Lord; that nothing is more sweet, Then to observe the Law; it is a Glorie To feare God, whose guift is not Transitorye. Chap. xxiv. Wisedome shall praise her-selfe in the hot Croud Of People; she will lift her voice aloud; She, in the Church of God shall Speake, and be Inspir'd from Heaven; they shall Dignifie, Ev'n they, the vulgar, what she did respire; And Holy Men shall at her words admire: She shall be precious with the Elect, &amp; they Who Blesséd are, shall Bless her; She shall Say I did proceed from Heaven's Eternall Mouth, Before all Creatures, and the Light which show'th For ever radiant, in the heaven did Spring From mee: as a Cloud overshadowing The Earth, soe was I; my bright Mansion Is in the height, and my Imperiall Throne, Is in the Pillar of a Cloud; but I, None has surround the Compasse of the Skye, Nor walkt in the Abisse; I have alone Ore Sea and Earth got the Possession; Nations Submit; and by my vertuall Power I have deprest the Haughtie, &amp; the lower; Thus sought I rest, and an Inheritance; Soe the Creator (who doth all Dispence) Gave me a Lawe, and rested in my Place, My Place of Sanctitye; and thus he saies; Inhabit Iacob, Live in Israel And to my Chosen ioyne thy selfe, &amp; dwell; I was, ere yet the world in Embrion lay, From all Eternitie, nor can decay; I, I have serv'd him, in the Holy place, Therfore in Sion I establish't was; Hee gave repose to me, w?? in the Mure Of my Deare Citie; my Invictive Power Was in Ierusalem; I fastned here, In a great People; ev'n in the Deare Inheritance of God; I am now set high, Like on Mount Libanus, the Cedar Tree; And as a Cypresse on the holy Mount, Or like a Palme Tree, nourisht by a fount, Am I Exalted; and I flourish Soe, As doth a Rose-Plant set in Ierico; As a faire Olive tree in a sweet feild, Or a Plane Tree, to w?? the Waters yeild Prolificke strength; Soe, even Soe, am I Exalted, even as great, as faire, as high; I smel'd as Cinnamon, but sweeter farre Then Aramaticke Balmes or Spices were; I gave an odour as the Mirrhe prepar'd; As Galbanum, Onix, or the richer Nard; I have enricht my habitation With fumes, as Incense; &amp; my breath has gone Fresh, as the bleeding Balme; Dispreden farr, Farre as the Terebinth, my branches are, And are the boughes of Honour; as the vine, I propagated, have produc'd as fine And rich a fruit, as fragrant to the Tast, And my fflowers are (beyond the Vulgar plac't) The Buds of Honour; I the Mother am Of Amiable Love, &amp; from mee came Feare, Knowledge, Hope; in Mee alone, in Mee, Doth stand the Grace of Life and veritie; In Mee the hope of Sacred Things doth rest; Come vnto Mee, if yo? would be possest, And sate yo? with my fruites; my Memory Is pleasant as the Honey, &amp; my ffee Is Sweeter then Virgin-Combes; it shall endure The Memorie of Mee, for evermore; They that Eate Mee shall more desire to Eate, And they that Drinke Mee shall not Moderate The heat of Thirst; who doth my words attend Shall never fall by an vntimely End; They that by Mee Worke, Sin not, nor shall they Who publish Mee, fall over to decaye. All these things vtter'd, stand as the bright Booke Of Life, the Covenant w?? God hath Spoke; The Notion of the Truth, &amp; the Strict Law Moses C?manded, for a lasting law, Vnto the house of Iacob; &amp; the Deale Of promises 'longing to Israel. From Ishai's son, he did from Time ordaine A Mighty King, that should for ever raigne; He filleth all things with his wisedome, as Phison, or Swelling Tygris, in the dayes Of the new fruites; he maketh Knowledge rise As the sweet streames of flowerie Euphrates; Of Iordan's waters, in the Harvest-Time; He doth reveale &amp; make his Doctrine shine, Of Knowledge, as the Light; &amp; opulent As Gehon, in the season of the vint. The first Man never knew her perfectlye, Nor shall the last attain't with Industrye; For she is full as the vnbounded Sea, And Intricate as paths of water be. I, wisedome, haue giv'n Rivers where to glide, I am a sluce of Waters, and I tide, Ev'n as a River; I have Issuéd, From Paradice, as waters from their head; I said I will water my hopefull Plant, And give my Meadowes Deaw, when they shall want; And (loe) my brooke, now like a River ran, My River swell'd to a vast Ocean. I make my Doctrine shine, as doth the Light Of the faire Orient, when she leaves the Night; And Spreden far, I will the Centre view, And places such as yet none ever knew; I will behold all such as be asleepe, And will illumine such as live &amp; keepe A trust to Heaven; yet, yet will I powre out Doctrine; as Prophecie, to those who sought Wisedome, I leave it; to perpetuall Ages, I give it; loe then, to my selfe, but Equallye To those that seeke Truth, in Posteritye. Chap. xxv. In those things have I pleasure, Consonant To God &amp; Man; Peace &amp; a firme consent 'Mongst brothers; Love of Neighbours; &amp; the yoke Of Marriage kept Inviolate, not Broke, By foule Dissention; likewise I abhorre, In Soule, Three sorts of other Men: the Poore Haughtie &amp; Proud; the rich man who doth Speake Frequent vntruthes; the Old Man, old &amp; weake, To love his Sin. If thou hast gather'd ought In thy young yeares, Old, canst thou hope for ought? How seemly is it in the Reverend haire To give Instruction! Oh! how goodly faire Is Counsell from Grave Men! How sweet a thing To Eld is Wisedome! What doth Knowledge bring To Men of honour? The Crowne to profit Age Is full Experience, &amp; the heritage They leave behind; their honour &amp; their boast Is in the feare of God, t' adorne them most. Nine thinges my soul hath iudgéd happie, and The Tenth I will pronounce: 'tis this, A Man That in his dayes hath Comfort in his Son And sees his foes fall to Confusion. Happie, and more then thrice, who doth reside Secure in vertue of a Modest Bride; Whose tongue offended never; who did Crouch Never to any worthles of soe much. Happie is he who finds a Loyall freind, And he who speakes to Men that will attend. How is he great that wisedome doth attaine! Yet none more great then he whose thoughts retain A Dread of Heaven; Splendrous, &amp; in a height Transcending all bright Iustice hath him sitt; Blesséd then he, blesséd beyond compare, Whose Soule is seasonéd w?? a holy feare. The feare of God doth first Initiate Man to his love, &amp; ffaith doth procreate From his faire root. Of all, the greatest greif Is of the heart; of Malice, 'tis the Cheife, W?? raignes in woeman; give me Discontent Any, but of the Heart; let Spleen be bent, On mee by any, but (that more then Spleen) The Malice of the weake &amp; Feminine. Any assault, save the assault of those Who hate mee, any vengeance but of ffoes; Noe head more wicked, more pernicious, Then of a Serpent, more obnoxious; Noe Anger then a Woeman's. Better far Dwell with a Lyon, or where Dragons are, Then with a perverse woeman; for her Sin Changeth her face, &amp; foiles her Count'nance in A Despicable forme; as the sterne Beare, Her husband sigheth, ere he be aware, Conversing with his Neighbours: other Sin Is poore &amp; nothing to the feminine. As an Asscent straw'd w?? a slippery greet Is Irksome to infirme &amp; Agéd feet; Soe a much-talking Woeman to the Mind Of him whose thoughts are fix'd or will inclin'd. Fall not to Beautie, nor the outward face; Woeman, if Sinfull, sinneth to Excess. A Woeman suffer'd, doth depress the heart, Deiects the Eyes, &amp; makes the mind to smart; Benummes the hands, Enfeebleth the knees, And not regards her husband's Miseries. From Woeman Sin first came; in her All Die. Give Issue to thy waters none, though high, Noe not a little, nor at all allow Freedome to an ill woeman; If she know Not her Obedience in the publick Eye Of all the World, &amp; of thy Enimie, Shee will Supplant thee; cutt her from thy Side, Least she more wrong thee &amp; thy wrongs deride. Chap. xxvi. Happie the man who has a vertuous wife; Double his yeares shall be, to bless his Life. An honest Woeman is the Husband's Ioy, Crowninge his Dayes with all felicitie; A Dower Inestimable, w?? shall be given Only to such as feare the God of Heauen. Be ffortune as it will, it cannot varie His resolutions, he shall ever carry A Face erected. Three things, to my heart, Are terrible, and my Eyes revert Against the Fourth: Treason in Citties bred, A Publick Mutinie, and falshood made The accusation; these are beyond Death. A Woeman Iealous to her husband's faith Is an affliction; by her hastie feares Prompted, her tongue will speak it to all Eares. A froward Woeman is like to a yoke Of Sullen Oxen, each from other broke; To him that hath her, as a Scorpion. A Drunken Woeman &amp; vncivill one Is as a Curse, a Shame, she cannot hide Her filthines; The Eyes and the Eye-lid, Denote a Woeman's lewdnes. Naturallye, If not thy Daughter be of Modestie, Have a strict rule vpon her, least she may In too much freedome, cast herselfe away; Take heed to her whose Impudence doth speake In her Eyes' Glasse; nor wonder if she breake To give offence; as one, that by the way Thirsteth, soe she will ope her mouth &amp; stay To drinke of every water; she will sitt With open Quiver, for all Arrowes fitt. A vertuous woeman doth Consolidate Her husband, &amp; her wisedome is as ffat Vnto his Bones; a Woeman loveing Peace And of an humble Spirit, is increase From Heaven's full hand, beyond Comparison Of value, if she have Instruction. She whose desires are fixt in Modestie Is double honour, &amp; noe Wealth can be Equall vnto her vertue; as the Sun, When it ariseth to our Horizon, In the high Court of Heaven; &amp; not less Cleare, Doth a good Woeman in her house appeare. As the bright Lamp, which pious hands did fix, To burne vpon the Holy Candlestickes; Soe goodly is the beautie of the Face In a ripe Age. As on a Silver base, Rich Golden Columnes stand, Soe w?? a Mind Vntainted, ffeet of Innocence wee find. The strong foundations layd vpon a Rocke, Perpetuall are 'bove wind or Thunder's shocke; Soe fixt doth vertue stand, &amp; soe Immute, With her whose thoughts are truly resolute. My Son, be Continent; let not thy blood Mixe shamefully, for an ignoble brood; Let thy ffeilds flourish in vnborrowed Seed, Trusting to thy owne worth; Soe shalt thou, Dead, Survive w?? Glorye, in a goodly race Of Sons, to Image thee without disgrace. Woeman (whose vertue is but Modestie) Immodest, nothing viler; filthier she Then scornéd ordure; but, whose Chaster brow, Ne're fixt beyond the limits of her vow, She stands her Sexe's honour, most her owne; Adornes her Husband, w? a Splendent Crowne: A Crowne of Ioy, a Crowne of full content, To Speake him happie, &amp; her Excellent. A Sinfull Woeman is but Iustly given A Yoke-fellow to him who scorneth Heauen; But as a Blessing, from a blesséd hand, She given is, whose vertues countermand The loose Suggests of frailtie; in offence A Wicked Woeman falls to Impudence. The Modest, she whose Either Eye can Speake Her Innocence, is ignorant to breake A Syllable, or entertaine a Thought Dissonant to the reverence she ought; Her Husband is her Oracle, whose will Stands alwaies to her reason; but in ill Then she may safely Cancell &amp; make void Her vow to Man, w?? is not Dissobeyed In Observance of a stricter vow; Thus she revolts, els never can allow Soe much as thought to argue; &amp; her Name, In her Obedience, shall Survive to ffame, Of precious worth; &amp; to the gravest Eyes, Her sweet Demeanour shall confirme her wise. But she whose fancy hurryes her beyond Her zeale to vertue, &amp; infects her mind With the black Sperme of Contradiction, Preferring humour 'bove Affection; She shall be Infamous, &amp; every Eare Will tingle at the Memorye of her. A Clamant Woeman, or of many words, Let her oppose against the thirsty Swords Of threat'ning Enemies, for he, the Man Resident with her, in his Spirit can Not be at Peace; but Spend his tedious years In doubts, Dissentions, &amp; vnheard of feares. My heart is troubled, &amp; I can lament Two things; the third makes me Impatient: A Man whose actions merited iust Praise, Suffer in want; the Disrespect to wise And learnéd Men; &amp; he who retroverts To Sin againe; such to their owne deserts, God marks for vengeance. To my tim'rous Soule, These appeare Difficult; a man to hold In the affaires of Trade &amp; Merchandize His will vncorrupt, &amp; his Soule from vice; The Newes-full Host to order soe his waies He may be Iustified in what he Says. Chap. xxvii. Many have Sinned, for empty hopes, to find A triviall profit makes another blind; Men rivet Sin in bargaine, as a Naile W?? hammers, beaten fast into a Wall. Vnless a Man be carefull to Live Iust, His house will Drop away, &amp; Dye in Dust; As doth a Seive scatter the purer graine, And can but only Orts' and Chaffe retaine; Soe humane follies, openlye are seene, When the black dregs, Embosom'd are within; As fire proves the Clay, Soe words declare The inward Soule, &amp; seale Men what they are. A well-drest Tree will bring an Early fruite, And a full Soule cannot be Ever Mute. Let not thy Tongue run in a forward praise Of any Man, ignorant of his waies And stranger to his words; if he impart Wisedome in words, it may informe desert, To thy opinion; for in this doth rest, The only valid and Convinceing Test. Thou shalt acquire Iustice, in the pursuit, And put her on, as a vest, fairely wrought; Thou shalt inhabite, in her glorious Tent; She will be a Defence and Ornament, To thee for ever; thou shalt stand Immute, Beleagver'd round, with horrors, feare, &amp; Doubt. Birds keep in kind, &amp; soe doth Truth resound With glory to his Name, where she is found; As waits the Næmean Lyon for his Pray, Soe Sin attends the Sinner to betray. Wisedome the words of holy Men doth Crowne, But ffooles are variable as the Moone; Ramble not thou with Idle Company, But shunne their Meetings; vse w?? frequencye The learnéd Synods; what ffooles haue exprest Provokes the Soule, they make their Sin, their Iest. He, who to strengthen his discourse, can Mint Flagitious Oathes, &amp; vtter Confident, In the bright Face of heaven, his Blasphemies, With horror makes affrighted haire to rise; Confounding Sence in his Contentions, With Itterated Imprecations; Murder attends the variance of the Proud; Their words are quarrells, and their language loud. He who reveales a trust, forfeits his Name, Dyes vnbefreinded, &amp; survives with Shame. Be reall to thy freind, &amp; let thy love Fix thee not in the power of sate to move; For know, if thou a part of Trust disclose 'Bove recantation, then he iustly goes; For not a Man can greater harme inttend An Enemie, than thou hast done thy freind. As the vnwary hand, w?? did containe The late-tooke Bird, &amp; let her goe againe, Soe if thy rashnes violate his Trust, He goes away, &amp; is for ever lost; Bootless to follow him, escapéd farre, Tim'rous as the Roe broke from the Snare; For he is thrill'd w?? a Mortiferous Dart, A Twi-forkt Iavelin doth divide his heart. Wounds, by an Artfull hand may be made sound, And Anger vnadvis'd may be atton'd; But he who blabs the secrett of a freind, Shame be his Portion, &amp; despaire his end. He that hath busie Eyes, his heart doth plott Strange mischeifes; he y? knowes him will haue nought With him at all to doe; for what he saies Is but a glosse t' exuberate thy praise, To thy owne Eares; but when he sees the Time, He will vnsay, &amp; make thy vertue Crime. Many things have I hated, but none more Then such a Man, for God doth him abhorre, A stone sent vpright from a Synewie Arme, Falls, as it went, vnto the Slinger's harme; And he that striketh with the Cutting brond Of fraud, doth not him selfe escape the wound, In the deep pit w?? he did whilome delve For other's Ruine, shall he fall himselfe; The stone w?? he with a malitious heart Laied for his Neighbour, shall himselfe subvert; And the strong gen he for another sett, Shall be a Snare t' entangle his owne ffeet. Who worketh evill, it shall be his lot, And he from whence &amp; how it comes ignote. Vncivill Speeches hang vpon the Tongue Of a Proud Man, but vengeance staies not long; They who their Soules madly Exhilirate, To see the Iust Suffer in wayward ffate, Shall not escape; Envy &amp; wrath can neither Be innocent; Sinners have both together. Chap. xxviii. Who thirsteth for revenge, shall vengeance find; His Sin remaineth, to th' Almighty's mind. Forgive thy Neigbour if he ill have done, Soe God to thee will have Compassion; How can Man blushles aske, or at all say't, Forgive mee Lord! Who doth his neighbour hate? To Man, his Equall by Creation, Hee will not have the least Compassion; And shall he aske?—by what vnknowne pretence,— From Heaven, remission for his owne offence? If he, but Mortall, doe his Neighbour hate, Who shall to heaven, for his Sinnes mediate? Forbeare dissention, Contemplate thy End; Nor let thy Anger make thy Wishes tend To a sinister path, in preiudice Of a Man's life or fortunes; Take advice From the Eternall Word, soe shall not thou Burne inwardly, nor have a froward Brow Against thy neighbour; weigh God's ordinance, And thinke another's Sin his Ignorance. Forbeare dissention, and thou shalt Decline From many Sins, and mitigate thy Crime; For Anger only Seeketh Variance. Perfidious Sinners breed a Difference 'Mongst freinds, &amp; sow the Seeds of dire debate In quiet feilds, with Men who know not hate. As is the ffuell, soe the ffire doth rise, And as he is in State or Dignities, Soe Man is Angry: as he growes in Store Hee swells in Anger, and offendeth more. A suddaine fury &amp; rash-vtter'd words Kindle a ffire; and inconsiderate Swords Easilye brings bloodshed, but the fraudulent And froward Tongve has Death Concomitant. The Sparke shall fflame, or vtterly Expire At thy owne likeing; Blow, 't will be a ffire; Suppress it now, and Quench it ere it rise Into a flame, how Easilie it Dies! “Abhorr the Mouth of Slander &amp; the Tongve “Of ffraud, for such have brought Destruction “To Brothers: Many men are dispossest “Of their Inheritance; Citties Suppres't; “Extirp't Nobility, and laid in Dust “Even with their Walls, the honours they could boast; “Not Kings are free, Envy can strike the Throne “Of Monarchs, and Subvert a Nation; “What can it not? even vertue 'twill defame “And Spew detraction on a Spotless Name. Who wanders in her waies shall never spend One houre of Ioy, but see a hatefull End. A rod will raise the flesh, but words hurt more, Grindinge the Bones, and makes the Entrailes Sore. “Many have fal'ne, by the hand of ffate, “Or to an Arme Victorious, or the Hate “Of his Vowed Enimie, whose ffurie hath “Noe Satisfaction, but in Blood and Death; “Many have perish't thus, but Envie's word, “By Oddes, outvies the slaughter of the Sword. Thrice happie he, exempt from envy's Breath, Who never fell the obiect of her wrath; And happie he, who never yet knew how To brave the Yoke, or did the fetters know. As Iron is the Yoke, to Gall the Necke The Gives are Brasse, and difficult to breake; The Death is Death Eternall, Hell may be Accounted Blisse, to its Eternitie; The Iust Man shall not know it, nor receive Warmth from her flames, in all he has to live, But stubborne Sinners to her waies shall turne, Shall kisse her flame, and in her furnace burne. As the fierce Lyon from his cunning ward, It shall Surprise him; as the Vorant Pard, It shall destroy them. Circumdate thy land With hedge of thorne, &amp; let thy reason stand A barre vnto thy Mouth, thy store of all Treasure together; and let noe word fall To losse but trye it; curbe thy forward tongue, Lest falling soe, thou suffer in the strong Devices of thy ffoe, even to the Death, Past all recure, to his inveterate wrath. Chap. xxix. Hee that doth lend his Neighbour of his Store, Doth a good worke; and he that hath the Power Over himselfe, and Masters soe his will As Truth directs, he shall be perfect still. Supply thy neighbour's wants, when ere they 'fall, And keepe thy Day of payment without Call. Observe thy word, be reall to thy freind, That in thy need thou maiest like favour find; Some, what they Borrow, value not the lest Of proper Substance, but a Clear acquist; Till they obtaine, their words are smooth as Oyle, They can frame Langvage, and put in a smile, To insinuate the more; and kisses pay Vpon the hands: none soe submisse as they; But when the Day now comes they should restore, They vrge delayes, they can nor will the more, Till such a time; and when that Time is come, They or pay none, or paye but halfe the Summe, Although in State; and that they count their owne; But if the whole be prest they pay or none, Or if they Doe, rude Clamours, Cursings loud, Mingle incessantly; pay ill for good. This a maine Obstacle, I oft have knowne, To Mercye in this kind, lest of their owne They might defrauded be; not but they would Gladly have Spar'd it to their neighbour's good. Yet be thou gracious, &amp; Commiserate W??out delay, the humble in Estate; Because Heaven bids it, give the poore releife, And be not haughty, to incense his greife; Value not money, but forgoe thy treasure, To Doe thy Brother or thy Freind a Pleasure; And let it not be vseless in thy Chest, To thy owne preiudice; thy Interest Shall Double be, if, as Heaven bids, thou give; Soe shalt thou, Crown'd with Plenty, ever live. Let not the Sun be privy to thy Almes; That thou maiest ride vpon the gentle calmes Laid vp in heaven's bright Caskett, 'bove the Seisure Of vniust violence; where they're repaid W?? treble Interest, and satisfyed, For every Drachma'; they shall rise As rampires to withstand thy Enemies. The Target of a Gyant is not proofe, His weapons worthless are; this shall beare off Ten thousand Iavelins, &amp; more wound thy ffoes Then the Keene Sword with strong-redoubled blowes. The Iust man will engage his owne estate To his freind's wants, but Sinners follow ffate: Doe not forget him who was once thy bond: His Name, his ffortunes, &amp; his Life, he pawn'd For thy Recoverie; Soe the wicked live, Ingratefull for the good they did receiue; They nor remember love, in that Degree, Nor can be drawne in for Securitie, With any freind; some, happily, will say It shall be paid, who never meanes to pay. Yet know w?? all, how vast Estates have beene Wasted; how long &amp; good discents have seene A Period to their honours; &amp; their boast, Their house &amp; heritage, for ever lost, By rash Credulitie, &amp; the vaine Court Of strangers, only strong in their support. A wicked Man shall fall to every bond, And busie heads in their owne doubts are drown'd. Help every Man, but let thy freind Command, Thy very vttmost; stretch a readie hand T' vphold him tott'ring; but w?? all be wise; See, thou fall not to make thy neigbour rise. These are the necessaries which bested Cheifly a Life: water to Drinke &amp; Bread For ffood &amp; sustenance, Raiment to hide The Nakednes, &amp; place where to bide. How sweetly doth the Poore Man spend his Dayes In a low Cell! w?? what Content, what peace! Hee seeth &amp; looketh at the Royall Throne With admiration; but he likes his owne Vnwearied State; he can heare a story Of State or Greatnes, and allow the Glory, His wonder; he may tast, perhaps, the Cates W?? store the boards of wanton Potentates; But has a Ioy, w?? greatnes seldome knowes, In his owne Cottage; his vntroubled browes Can rest Secure, vpon a bed of Hay, And please his Appetite, even as to Day The same to Morrow; homelye Nourishment But wholesome ffood, full in a true Content. And soe Content thy selfe w?? thy Estate, Little or much, least thou incurre the hate And scorne of Men; Oh! 'tis a Miserie (Not Povertie,) but scornéd Beggerie. What Taunts, what Calumnies, from every Tongue, Fall there; nor canst thou vindicate thy wrong To stranger Eares; thou shalt be revil'd By every tongue, even by the ffoster'd Child Of thy owne Charity; he, he shall say, Wait on my Table, give my ffreind here way, Thou abiect groome; my Brother comes to-night, Depart my house! These Scornes will vex the Spright Of the most wise, and make his entrailes burne, To Sowe soe ill; for Love to gather Scorne. Chap. xxx. Hee that doth love his Son with true affection, And hopes for ioy, will give him oft correction; The Severe ffather shall a Comfort find In his son's Manners; strict, but not vnkind; Who adds to Nature's Strength, the helpes of Art, With letters &amp; Instruction, greives the heart Of Enemies, but gives a full content To freinds, in his son's government; Who, though his Father Die, he soe shall live The World will say, he doth in him survive; His ffather liveing had a ioy in him, And Dy'd content to leaue soe faire a stem; Who shall oppose his Enimies, &amp; meet His ffreinds with Equall Love &amp; noe Deceit. Hee whose indulgence carries him beyond The care &amp; rule he ought, hath partly ioyn'd Himselfe an Accessarie to the Crime His Son Committeth, in forbearing him. As an vnmanag'd Horse, whose prouder back Nere knew a Rider, scorneth now to take, Now in his Pride, his gvidance from a hand, Or strong, or skillfull, but Doth Chafing stand; Ev'n soe a Child, who hath not knowne the Awe Of a strict Rule, now come to Yeares, will know Reverence noe more, but follow his owne will And multiply thy feares, if thou, more Child, Follow thy Son—in the fantastick waies Youth can invent,—to partake in his plaies And wanton ffollies; thou shalt one Day know This ffreedome thy owne greife, his overthrow. Let not thy smiles approue his action Of Wildnes, Comely; lest thou one day grone In Soule to see th' Effect; Curbe the feirce bent Of headstrong youth, &amp; spare not punishment; Restraine him now a Child, &amp; for his good, Let him smart in Correction, by the Rod, Lest he grow haughtie, &amp; thy Rule disdaine After few yeares shall flatter him a Man. Give him instruction, &amp; to his offence Vrge noe excuse, but let thy diligence See every blemish; &amp; not, madly blind, Winck at those follies all the world can find; Least thou, too late, repent, &amp; have the shame Of his disorders to fall on thy Name. “Better, oh better, far, a poor man's state, “Perfect in health, &amp; pleaséd in his fate, “Then the Rich Man, infirme; for all his store “Is worthles, to the treasure of the poore,— “A Mind &amp; Bodie perfect: nought beyond “A Bodie strong, &amp; of composéd mind. “Better to die at once, then draw the breath “Of Sorrow, to adiourne a Liveing Death; “Better the Peacefull Vrne, a place of rest, “Then Life, to live in Miserie opprest. Knowledge concealéd in a Sullen heart Is, as to dead Men, Meat; of what desert Is Incense, to an Idoll, void of Sence To tast thy Victim, or thy ffrankincense? Soe doth the Sinfull Man; his Eyes can see, His Soule is troubléd in anxietie, As the Imperfect Castrate, who doth Lye Groneing, to see vntouch't virginitye. “Admit noe cause to let in Melancholly, “Nor vex thy Soule to Descant thy owne folly; “A ioyfull heart is humane happines, “And Mirth preventeth ffate, in the encrease “Of many yeares. To Summe vp all, content- “full with glad daies, w? Peace drawne out, &amp; Spent. “Most love thy Soule, Exhilirate thy hart, “With holy ioy; let needles fears depart, “And Sorrow die; for bitternes of Mind, “Many repent, none ever good could find; “It doth destroy Man in his Springing Prime, “And brings deiected Age, before the time. Honour neglects these moods, but soe doth live, That his owne ffortunes all content can give. Chap. xxxi. Insatiate Avarice makes thy bodie faint, Disturbs thy Mind, ev'n to the greatest want Of humane being, Sleep; his dreams are broke With soudain ffears, like to Distemper'd folke. The Rich Man's Industrie is to get more, And sees his labours prosper in his store; The poor Man labours too, but to Subsist, And when he leaves, his state is not encreast. He is not Iust who doth his Gold admire, And he who seekes to sate his owne desire In transitorie Ends, and doth attend Corrupted dross, shall, as he seeketh, find. Many have fallen to Death in Avarice, Tane by the Shine of Gold, with ravish't Eyes: It is a block, Mortalls may fall before it, Fall to the Death; &amp; ever ffooles adore it. Blesséd is he whose wealth is not his Sin, Whose Actions blameless are, who ha's not bin Slavéd by lucre, nor affiéd his Rest In Gold, or any thing which he Possest. Who, who is he? wee will empaile his Browes With Chaplets, &amp; his Name shall be to vs A Memorie for ever; he hath beene A Glorie, more then Time hath ever seene; Who has beene tryed, who has the exact scale Of Iustice provéd, and he noe way faile! But he a patterne, who has curb'd his will When he had power; who good, might have been ill! He shall be fixt in an inheritance, And have the gen'rall vote of Excellence. Art thou a gvest at the luxurious board Of some quaint Epicure? with Dainties stor'd. Breath not vpon it with the least delight, Nor Say, fix here, Voluptuous Appetite! Know then a naughty Eye can nothing be Worse, it shall weep what ever thing it see; Let not thy rambling Eye direct thy hand To take the Dish, if it at distance stand; Thinke he observes it by thee, he, the next, On thy right hand, as all the rest are fixt; Eate Soberly, &amp; moderate thy Sence, To civill breeding; make it noe pretence, Another's gluttonie, to thy Excesse; Nor let thy hand 'fore others, rudely presse. How little! ah, how little, might suffice, (And to more Sanitie) the Sober wise! Noe noisome fumes, the fruites of Surfetting, Shall rise t' offend thy Sence, nor paine shall wring His Gutts or Stomach; he shall find his sleep Blesst, in the Rule his temperance did keep; He rises, when the shades of night are gon, And finds himselfe in disposition; But to the Glutton, Sleeps are never long, His Stomach rageth, &amp; his Gutts are wrong. If th' art compell'd to Eate, &amp; Eate beyond Sobrietie, rise, vomit, if thou find Thy selfe or'e-charg'd, then find a place to Sleep; This, from diseases, shall thy Bodie keep. My Son, doe not reiect what I shall now Speake, &amp; one day thou shalt my councells know, Of profitable vse; let thy workes bee Done with a Quicknes, to keep Sanitie. The hospitable Man shall have a praise From everie Tongue, to bless him in his Daies; Not soe the Niggard, he shall have his Name Curséd, &amp; to the world survive with Shame. Strive not in Wine for worthles victorye, For many soe have fal'n to Miserye; The forge doth prove the temper of the Steele, Soe Wine to Excess, his secrets doth reveale. Wine taken Soberly doth adde to health; And as from first ordain'd, (not for the filth Of luxurie) exempts the hart from care, Brings an alacritie of Soule, a rare And purgéd ffancie; doth inspire a strong And active Genius, gives the falt'ring Tongue A Cleare Expression, &amp; doth breath a flame To inrich Stupiditie, &amp; create a Name. But to Excess, what horrid Crimes attend! Loud Execrations, Quarrells, &amp; doth lend Sometimes, an vncouth valour; w?? may bring A late repentance, in the suffering. Differ not with thy freind, hott in his Wine, Neither deride his Mirth; if he encline To follie, blame him not, nor Itterate Harsh language to encrease &amp; stirre debate. Chap. xxxii. Art thou Cheife-Ruler, by the Common voice Elected? let not thy forgetfull Eies Disdaine them now, who were thy Equalls late; Governe with care, neglect the forme of State, Allow a civill ffreedome, that thy Name May have a suffrage by the vote of ffame; Speake, thou art Sage, for it becomes thee best, Speake by advice; let Musique grace the ffeast; Be Silent in a noisefull presse; Beware Thy Wisedome take a time to everie Eare. As the greene Emerald, (whose embellishing Came by the workeman's hand,) plac'd in a Ring, Or the bright Carbuncle, (whose wondrous flame Pussles the skillfull Lapidare to Name,) Set for more Ornament (rough but ere while) In Golden stud, with a tra'lucent foyle; Soe at a ffeast appeares the Sprightly Quire Of Artfull Musicke, which doth lend a fire To the dull Sence of Rapture; doth present A noble mirth, with gracefull Ornament. Attend, &amp; doe not interrupt the Storie Of any Man, &amp; it shall be thy Glorie. Thou art but younge, be sober; not vnkind, Not silent, where th' art vrg'd to Speake thy mind; Yet let not trifles move thee, but advise The Motives reall &amp; thy Councell wise; Let every word Speake matter; Labour more To be sententious then an Orator; Appear as ignorant in many things, And varnish it with vnapt Questionings: In Ignorance, be wise; seem t' apprehend High Knowledges; be silent &amp; attend, Soe shalt thou hide thy want, &amp; be as one Who knew their wisedome, yet has nothing knowne. 'Tis wisedome to hide weakenes; be not vaine Comparatively, with the Nobleman, To boast thy selfe; &amp; let the speaking Mouth Of Sage antiquitie restraine thy youth. Lightning præcedes the Thunder, (to our sence) Soe to Humilitie is Excellence. Rise, &amp; take Ciuill congee, not the last; Goe home, &amp; recreate thy mind, as best Shall be agreeing; please thy ffancie in Thy vndertakeing, &amp; beware of Sin; But above all, as more then all thy rest Praise thy Creator, who thy Life has blest. They that fear God, will doe as he hath taught And he will give a blessing, where 'tis sought; The Iust Man's Actions Speak his heart Sincere, To goodnes, in Religion, &amp; ffeare. The Hypocrite doth holines professe, But in the inward Soule is nothing less; His words deceive: the show of Sanctitie, But none in heart more fraudulent then Hee. The Iust Man shall be iustified, his Name Shall be as perfume to the holy flame. Sin is perverse; &amp; Sinners will devise A thousand Shifts for their Impieties; Wisedome will take advice, but Sinners never Are daunted, but in wickednes persever. My son, advise thy Actions, soe the Lott Of ffooles shall 'scape thee; late repentance gott By desperate hazard: goe not for the nonce Into a way pesterd &amp; fill'd with Stones; In the smooth way thou dost not stand secure, How less in stones? &amp; every stone vnsure. “Instruct thy Children, &amp; be serious “In private duties, over thy owne house; “Doe good workes well; this is Cheife, the Summe “Of all the Law, Fear God; thou shalt become “Iust to the Letter, and surviue with Ioy, “In thy owne Peace, to Peace Eternallye. Chap. xxxiii. The iust shall see good dayes, &amp; be secure Guarded by Heaven, from Sin, or sinfull power; A Wise Man will be iust, will keep the Law; The Hypocrite doth variously draw And suffers in his doubts, as in a Storme A Ship, w?? Crazy Keele &amp; Canvas torne; A Wise Man walkes precisely to the word, Secure in goodnes, vpon heaven's record; Weigh first the Question, &amp; with sound advice Answere to purpose, without fallacies; As a Wheele whirles, or a rough Axell rolles, Soe restles are the vnstai'd hearts of ffooles. As the brave Horse doth breath a proud disdaine, Without distinction, vnder any Man, In heat of Spirit; soe the scornefull freind Is vnto all, but doth to none intend. Can humane reason tell, or can Art say, Why this a bright, that a Cloudie Day? Why Seasons are? &amp; why the Sun doth range Through heaven's blue pauement, constant in his Change? God, only Wise, by his Eternall Will, Gave the disposure, as they move in still; Some for the seasons, some for solemne ffeasts, Some to the Number, some for Sacred Hests. All Men are Equall Earth; God did create Adam at first from Earth, to humane State; But in his Sons a diverse facultie: Some foolish are, some Wise, some low, some high; Some he selected, some he hath brought downe. Some he hath blessed, some stand to his frowne. As Potters, to their ffancy, mold the Clay ffor vessells, this or that, or th' other way, Soe Men, from Earth form'd, by the breath of heaven, Subsist in strength, and have endowments given, Of good or Evill; Life or Death, alike; Sinfull or Iust, Insolent or Meeke; Soe throughout all the Creatures thou maiest See Things opposite, &amp; either Equallye. I, last of all, awake, as one doth run To gather, when the vintage is quite done; Yet (blest by Heaven) I find a full encrease, And, as a Labourer, I have fill'd my presse. Loe! not alone my labour was my gaine; But I have wrought that others might attaine. Heare me, O you purple-Clad Magistrates, You civill Rulers, heare mee all Estates. Give not thy selfe, a Thrall, vp to the Power Of son, or wife, or Brother; nor endure Him whom thy Soule hath chosen to dispose Of thee, beyond thy selfe; &amp; as of those Will and affection, keepe thy owne Estate To thy owne vse, lest thou repent it late; Doe not Int'rest another, nor admit Another's gvidance, if thou livest yet; For better 'tis, Children to thee, should sue, Then thou from them beg, what was once thy Due: Be Iust in all thy Actions, that thy Peace Be not disputed; and at thy decease, When Nature doth, a due, thy Death demand; Distribute thy Estate, with a glad Hand. As Meat doth Maintaine strength, &amp; blowes enforce The Ass to labour, &amp; performe his course Of toyle, in mighty Burdens; soe to give A servant, makes him labour, &amp; thee Live; If thou enioyne him labour, &amp; exact A strict survey, to account every Act, Thou shalt be happie in him; but the Groome Brought vp in Ease, doth Libertine become; The stubborne yoke &amp; the sharp whip doth make A Bull's Neck plyant, doth his Choler slake; Soe vse vntoward Servants; let them know Correction, to make their proud Neckes bow; Put them to labour; Idlenes, will teach A thousand Lessons, els beyond their reach; One sin is never single; &amp; of All, This is the Spring, the source this, where they fall. See to thy servant's Labour, if he Stand Obstinate, presse him with a stricter hand; Let him know stronger Gives; yet moderate Thy Iustice soe it turne not into hate; Be not implacable nor furious; But strict, &amp; stretch not beyond rigorous. Hast thou a Servant faithfull to thy will? Strict in thy busines? timorous of ill? Let thy Soule love him, and esteeme him Deare; Thinke him the fruit of all thy former Care; Respect him as thy Brother; for his hand Is a Quick instrument in thy Command; In thy affaires Equall necessitie Require his care, e'ne to the want of thee; Cherish him to his Merit; if vncivill, For his good service thou reward'st him evill, And he depart thy house, then w?? the wind, Thou maiest goe seeke him, but shalt never find. Chap. xxxiv. How doe Fooles please themselves in empty things, And dote on Shaddowes, w?? imperfect wings! How w?? a Dreame transported! &amp; doe give Way vnto ffancye, in a strong beleife; Soe may they Claspe a shaddow, soe pursue The empty wind; or soe one fface doth show Vnto another, as imaginarie Conceivéd hopes, from perfect things doe varie: Who can be purgéd by a Hand impure? What certainties can lying lips assure? 'Tis vainity to trust in Augur's skill, Witchcrafte is false, &amp; Dreames are even ill; These are the fruites of a Distracted braine, Who rambles in the Search of Shaddowes vaine; Not every dreame a vision from above, But, by Almighty power, thy soule to prove: Therfore, beware! Dreames are vnsure, &amp; fleet; Deficient to the point, when wee should see't; The Law shall be made perfect, without Lyes; And the iust Man needs only to be wise; What do the vnexpert know? Instruction adds To vnderstanding, &amp; Experience glads A Wise Man's heart, in the discoverie Of Secrets, in a true Sufficiency: Ignorance is vnexpert, &amp; the Face Of smileing Error leads to Wickedness. Once wand'red I; &amp; many things have seene, But words fall short to vtter what wee meane; I diverse wayes have knowne, beene oft in dread Of threat'ninge death, but was deliveréd. The iust man's Soule shall live, being secure In faith to him, who only can assure; He that fears God will never be afraid Of humane Power; God is his hope, his Aide; Blesséd the Soule for ever, of the Iust; Who is his strength? in whom (ah) doth he trust? God will secure him, as a Bulwarke rise Against the strong assaults of enemies; From heat, a sweet repose; a Grove full growne, To guard the Temples from the scorching Sun; A lanthorne for the Steps; a firme Support In present danger, left the feet fall short. God is propitious to the Iust, and will Exalt the Soule, w?? a transcendent Skill; Sheds light Devine to the imperfect Eye; Gives Life &amp; health, blest in Satietye. A fain'd oblation is a sacrifice Not worthy, nor of pleasure in his Eyes; God is well-pleased, only pleas'd w?? them That follow Truth, &amp; love his holy Name; He not allowes the Prayers nor offerings Of wicked persons, neither shall their Sinnes Be satisfied w? Incense, nor suffice The constant tenders of their Sacrifice. He that doth bring w? faint Devotion, His off'ring, fruit of his Oppression, Doth as the Butcher, shedding Infants' blood, When the Sad ffather, as a witnes stood. The Poore live in their Bread, the bread of Care, Who hinders it is as a Murtherer; Oppression is a Vulture, &amp; Deceit Wanders in blood, t'w?? hold the hyre of Sweat. When carefull hands would raise a lofty wall, And Malice vndermines, to make it ffall, What profit is their toyle? what doe they gaine? But (the foole's wages,) Labour for their paine. When one doth tender his Devotion, And the same wind breathes Execration, Which voice is heard? He that for filth doth bath And Muddles in't againe, what profit hath The water done him for his penetence? Who falls againe vnto his old offence, Alas! what doth he? who will heare his Prayer? Worthless his ffasts, and his Almes fruitles are. Chap. xxxv. The Iust Man brings a worthy Sacrifice, His vow presents him to Almighty Eyes; As finest flower, his vertue doth appeare, Who to his obligation hath a Care. Almes are as Incence; 'tis a part of good Not to doe ill; &amp; not to keep the road, The Spacious road of Sin, is of availe And pleaseth Heaven; to stand is not to ffaile. These are as Sacrifice: yet shalt thou Come Empty, or appear w?? but thy vow; For these are done to the Commands of Heaven; But some, of Ceremony, must be given. The holy Altar in the Sacrifice Of Iust Men overflowes, &amp; the flames rise Bright vp to heaven, to gaine acceptance there, Still in the lustre, still in force t' appeare; Performe such rites freely, &amp; give the best Of all thy Actions gladly; all the rest Of Duties, offer, with a pleas'd Aspect; And consecrate thy tythes, with Due respect. O Give, &amp; gladly give, to the Most High, As he hath blest thee, in prosperitie; For he remunerat's and gratifies, With a full blessing, thy small Sacrifice; Let not thy Crimes impaire thy Offering, Such worthles are; nor (blind Devotion) bring An vniust Sacrifice; for it must come Vnto the Lord, &amp; there abide the Doome; Greatnes prevailes not, neither Povertie, But to their Actions, either Equallye. He heares the Crie w?? the Oppresséd make, The fatherlesse he will not still forsake; He knowes the widdowe's wants; doth not her Eyne Drench her lanke Cheekes, &amp; pickle 'em in Bryne? And her complaint is bitter; such complaints Ascend with Tears, &amp; peirce the Battlements Of Heaven's bright Pallace, to the Eternall Throne; Where they have audience, to the vttmost grone. The Iust shall find like favour, &amp; his praier Shall reach the Clouds, &amp; be accepted there. The humble pray, &amp; everie praier shall find A way to Heaven, not Sated, till it find Grace in the Eyes of Heaven, &amp; God will be Gracious ever, to Humilitie. He will not tarry long, at their request, But lacerate the Members, &amp; Infest The Bones of Sinners; the Oppression Shall Not 'scape a plague, but in his fury fall. The Heathen shall be scatter'd, &amp; his Arme Shall Quash the Cruell, &amp; prevent their harme; Tyrants must be vnking'd, &amp; all must find Mercy, to Merit; Iustice is assign'd To the vniust; his Mercy, to the Meeke. How faire is Mercy! ah, can Mortall speake How Comfortable? when a Soule doth Lye Chain'd in the fetters of darke Miserie; Sweet as the Morneing dew, or as a Raine, When the Sicke Earth lyes Gapeing in her Paine. Chap. xxxvi. Great God of Power! be gracious as Great, Ah! looke vpon the deplorable State Of vs, thy Creatures, with a tender Eye; Bright as the Morne, Extend thy Clemencye. Oh, let the people, who run blindly on In Ignorance and Superstition, Once know thy Name; and know thou only art A God of Power, that Strangers may impart Thy Glories; Stretch thy hand vpon their heads, That they may know thy Power all Power exceeds. As we to their Eyes Sanctifye thy Name, Soe be thou magnified to vs, in them; That they, as wee, may know thee, &amp; soe Sing, Thou only art a God, O lord, our King! Renewe thy Signes, &amp; bring the wonders downe, Stretch forth thy hand, oh stretch thy right arme soone! That they may know thy power &amp; show thy praise. Rise in thy fury, let thy wrath not cease, Take, take away, the perverse adversarie, Confound the foe, &amp; doe not ever tarrie, Recall thy Oath, and cut off all delayes; That once thy wonders may be told w?? Praise. Those that escape, let fire consume their bones; Let the Oppressour perish; Shall the Thrones Of Tyrants be their Safetie? Shall their proud Contempts of heaven, their Blasphemies, their loud And horrid Execrations, never fall To their confusion? Oh, thou, lord of all, Rouse thee to Iudgment, &amp; destroy the Seat Of Maiestie; if Maiestie forget Thy power, or Scorne thy rule; thus to the proud Be vengeance, &amp; triumph in their Blood: The Tribes of Iacob gather, let them know Thou art a God, &amp; none but only Thou; Soe may they praise thee; let thy Mercy shine, As once, soe now, &amp; be they ever thine. O Lord, have mercy, graciously looke downe Vpon thy people, ev'n vpon thy owne, Thy Israel, belovéd in thy Eyes As the first-borne; Oh heare the frequent Cries Of thy Dear Cittie! let Ierusalem, The Citie of thy rest, move in the Name, Thy mercy; oh! looke downe vpon the place Where thou art holy; give thy Sion peace; Open their minds, that they may apprehend Thy Misteries, &amp; to the world commend Thy power glorious; still be firme to those, Witnes w?? them, whom thou, at first hast Chose; Fullfill the prophecies Spoken of Old, Which ravish't Prophets, in thy Name have told; Let not the patient Suffer, that the writt Of holy Prophets may be iust in it. O heare the Praier, Great Lord, of vs, thy weake And worthles Servants; worthles here to Speak; Hear vs, ev'n in the Blessing Aaron gave Vnto the people; gvide vs in the Safe And perfect way of Iustice, that thy Name Be publishéd to an Eternall ffame, Glorious in all the Earth; that they may say, As we confesse, thou art the Lord, this Day; A God for ever; &amp; with ioynt Consent Sing thee, still great, glorious, &amp; Excellent. Chap. xxxvii. All Meats are Eaten, but not all as one; As the choice Pallate tasteth venison, Soe doth a wise-man Words; Sin bringeth shame; Wise Men resist it, &amp; despise the Name; Woeman doth fancy Man in generall, But Woeman is not as in one soe all; Beautie adornes her Eyes &amp; gives a grace T' insidiate her husband in her Face: If she be Modest, &amp; her words submit To an authority 'bove her owne witt; 'Tis beyond humane fate, &amp; he can be Hardly accounted with Mortalitie; He now begins to flourish in his Name, His riches doe encrease; he builds a frame T' out-wrastle Time; &amp; like himselfe hath found A help; a Pillar, firm'd in Solid ground. Where noe hedg is, the ground will fall to wast; And he laments alone, who doth not tast The Ioyes of Marriage; &amp; w?? out a Wife Suffers distraction in a single Life. Who trusteth him that walkes w?? out a Home But falls in any, when the night shall come? More then a Theife or Robber, who doth run From place to place, where mischeife may be don? All Men are freinds; in deed some, some in Name: 'Tis a poor freindship which the Lips proclaime. Is't not a greife, when he whom thy Soule chose Freind, or Companion, mingles w?? thy foes? Oh! huge Presumption, from what vgly slime Doest thou proceed? to fill the Earth w?? Crime. Wealth is an Adamant; Prosperitie Has many Freinds, but none adversitie; Some for his Belly, Freind; &amp; strange to see Prompt by his Gutts, how resolute he'le be! Be to thy freind a freind; &amp; though thou Swim On fortune's golden Streames, forget not him; If thou suspect him, take not his advice. Reveale noe Secrets to thy Enimies; Every Man likes his owne opinion, Some 'gainst their thought, to their owne ends doe run; Beware of Such; Consider to what End Thou seekest him: for though he may pretend Thy good in all, yet thinke he may (and know If he may, he will) for his owne profit draw To thy dishonour; &amp; in thy intent He has an ayme thy ffall to circumvent; He shall approve thy way, &amp; after bring Thy Words, thy Crime, as ignorant of the thing. Enquire not vertue in a Soule profane, Nor seeke for Iustice in a Libertine; Tell not a woeman on her Rivall, nor A feeble Spirit of the Acts of Warre; Merchants of Traffique; Chapmen of the Sale; An Envious Man of Love; doe not bewaile Crueltie to the Bloodie, nor approve Mercy to Madmen; Goodnes to Selfe Love; Aske not the Drone of Labour; nor Enquire Th' end of his worke, who has a constant hire; Nor th' Husbandman of Craftie Sciences; These are not proper: stand to none of These. But w?? the Iust be ever; who doth stand, Vnmov'd in the Law, keepes Heaven's Command; Whose Soule is ioyn'd to thine, &amp; is not lesse Greiv'd at thy faileing then his owne weaknes. Make thy owne heart thy Councellor, it shall Be faithfull ever; and discover all Thy frailties more, &amp; give a truer Light Then many Watch-men from a Turrett's height; In all, seeke Heav'?s direction; all thy waies Let Reason governe, every Act advise. The fface betrayes the heart; the same Effects Worketh in either, as the Brow detects: These, with the Alteration, good or Ill, Life or destruction; but the tongue is still The Herald to proclaime it, has the gvide Of all these Passions, Silent or displaied. Some Man is wise, can give instruction To other Men, but himselfe followes none; Some in words only Wise, &amp; leaves behind The reall Substance, for a Painted rind; Affecteth Langvage, &amp; to Common Eyes, May appear wondrous, but he is not wise; He wants the Bodie, though he Kiss the face, And dotes vpon the Masque, without a grace. Another, truly Wise, Wise to the good Of his owne Soule; &amp; what he vnderstood His words express; he gives infallid rules Of Knowledge to the good of other Soules; He shall be ever blest; not only rest In his owne Peace, but be to others blest. Dayes Summe this Life of Man; Israel shall be Not knowne by dayes, but live t' Eternitie; A wise man gaines an vniversall vote, And his faire Name shall never be forgot. Vnrip thy Soule, looke to thy Conscience, Correct thy Will, &amp; Shun a fresh offence; All things not profit all Men; every Mind Has a fresh obiect, hapines to find. Shun Luxurie! if not Religion Restraine thee, health forbids; Proportion Envigour's Nature; in the full Excesse Of Meats what Fumes arise! what Sicknesses Attend! and bring vnknowne infirmities, Too long to number; if Examples rise, How many could I give! but to be ffree From both the Sin &amp; Sore, live Soberlye. Chap. xxxviii. Give the Phisitian honour, not alone Because of need, but for 's Creation; For Medicine is from Heaven; heaven will blesse A good endeavour, happie in Success; Kings shall enrich him with a Pension, His Wisedome gives him Exaltation; Nobles will praise him, who by Science can Apt Medicine, as by Creation: It was ordain'd to Cure, or to prevent A present Sicknes, or an imminent; Wise Men despise not this; was not the flood Of Marah bitter, by a Tree made good? That Men might know in it a facultie Of Vertue, Excellent to Glorifie Him, in his Creatures; more, he doth impart Knowledge to Man, to Moderate the Smart Of rageing Vlcers; cure the Members vex't, And free the Bodie in disease perplex't; Art makes the Composition; but the Cure Rests to a higher Will, 'bove Mortall power; A Power that makes art happy in Successe, Gives, at his pleasure, Health, Ioy, Wealth, &amp; Peace. “Be not deiect in Sicknes; though thou be “Tortur'd in Body, let thy Mind be free; “Let not the Feaver seize thy Nobler part, “But pray to Heaven, with a perfect heart; “Desist from Sin, in Almes be Conversant, “Confess thy follies, &amp; thy faults repent; “Appease Heaven's fury w?? thy Sacrifice, “And seale thy Peace with off'rings; then advise “With Art, for God allowes it; vse his Care, “And honour him, for Sicknes may empaire Thy boasted Strength, to fall into his hand, By greife &amp; Sad necessitie constrain'd; His praiers goe with his Medicine, that, that may be Of vse, &amp; give the Bodie Sanitie; Infirmitie, the Wage of Sin, &amp; who Hath never Sinned, need noe Phisitian know; Lament my Son, poure forth aboundant tears, Performe all duties to the silent Herse; Not superficiall obsequies, but turne, W? A full heart, to Celebrate the vrne, Of the Deceaséd; give him all the rites Of holy Buriall, obscure all Delights In his dear Memorie; but recall in time Thy deprest Spiritts, in the loss of him, To a fresh Light; for, know, immoderate greife Confounds the vitalls &amp; dissolveth life; Sorrow is of the heart; a heart opprest, Weares out a Life, in Sadnes &amp; vnrest. Correct thy Passion, let thy greife decline; Know 'tis now his ffate, &amp; it must be thine; From death is noe retreate; he shall not have Ioy in thy Tears, mispent vpon his Grave; Thinke 'twas decreed, &amp; moderate thy Sorrow, 'Tis mine to Day, &amp; may be Thine to morrow; He resteth happie, let him rest in Peace, Comfort thy selfe, let needles sorrowes cease. Leasure doth adde to Learneing, in the Quest Of Wisedome Studious; Learneing is not Rest, But a retire from noise, from worldly Care; To Ioy in Raptures, ffixe vpon the ffaire Ideas of Beatitude, to find Things beyond Knowledge, w?? a perfect mind. How is the Plow-man Wise? his wisedome rests To cast vp furrowes, &amp; converse with Beasts; To strike his whip, &amp; to direct his Teeme; Talkes of his Cattle, &amp; of nought but Them. In like, all Crafts-Men, Serious in their Trade, Alas, what doth their Toile to Wisedome adde? One grindeth stones, another makes them bright, Another cutts them, makes it his delight To grave Exactly; and another, strife Is in his heart to Paralel the Life, And Limne perfection; tortur's his poore braine, To Modell beautie; and another, vaine As he, t' out doe the Pencill, gives the same Wrought by the Needle, in a curious frame. The Smith his Anvill loveth, makes a ffire; The very vtmost of his low desire, To apt the Mettall; thrusts his scorchéd Browes Into the flames; vntroubled in his vse, The Hammer's clatter, to confound his sense, And distract capable Intelligence; His Eyes walke with his hammers, &amp; his blisse Is in his Labour; knowes noe ioy but this. The Potter makes his Labour his Delight, And Spends his Time, Bright day &amp; pensive Night, Serious, to Mold Earth, &amp; proportion Clay, Reiecting This, &amp; chuseing th' other way; Then trimmes the worke, &amp; puts a Subtle glosse Vpon the Mettall, busied in his Drosse; These depend to their worke, &amp; all Employ Their Wisedome in their Labour, place a Ioy In their endeavors; bend their faculties To perfect trifles; ah! how fondly Wise! 'Tis true they stand the Rafters to a State, T' vphold the Body, make it Rich &amp; Greate; And thus they serue; but to the high affaire Of Sacred Iustice or th' Imperiall Chaire, They are not Chosen; they not know the Course Of Law in Iustice; nor the height, the force Of Government; they are vnfitt att all To debate rights, or things materiall; Only to drudge, &amp; in their Sweat maintaine The Publicke glorie, for a private paine. Chap. xxxix. He, only he, is wise, who can neglect The Sordid end of Mortalls, and direct His purgéd Soule to the clear Region Of holy things, by Contemplation; Labours for Knowledge, &amp; revolves the writt Of profound ancients, till he compass it; Is conversant w?? Misteries of Old, By Prophets Sung; makes what the learnéd told, His Oracle; resolves the hidden Sense Of Wisedome, in a deep intelligence: He shall have place with honour; Maiestie Shall looke vpon him, with a gracious Eye. That he may read men, in themselves more plaine, And how th' affections w?? in Mortalls raigne, He walks the round of Earth, &amp; gathers thence The Obiect of his Hope's Experience; He gives his Soule to Heaven, in all th' events Of Chance, or Danger, &amp; his vow presents, Guarded with Innocence, &amp; doth invoke The Devine ayde, in all he vndertooke: He shall be full in Knowledge, &amp; inspir'd By the Eternall Breath; vtter admir'd Essentiall wisedome, consonant to Truth; His Councells holy, reveal'd by the Mouth Of Perfect vertue, borne vpon the wings Of Sacred fancy; see Misterious thinges: He shall be Wise, &amp; Men shall thinke him Wise, Makeing the Law his Gvide, his Exercise; He shall be glorious to the Eyes of Men, And live for ever; wisedome shall remaine T' adorne his Memory; &amp; his Name shall shine Bright to Posteritye, without Decline: Men shall be busie to exalt his ffame, And give their Eulogies vnto his Name. Though he be Dead, he shall not all decay, But leave a Name Immortall, when the Clay Which covers thousands, doth their Name obscure, And Choakes their mention in a Dismall Mure: Or live he still? his Glorye, shall aspire To Crowne himselfe, &amp; make the world admire. Yet let me tell yo? more, for now I am Carried in Rapture, fill'd w?? Sacred flame; As Cynthia orb'd, now move I; I'me possest With Devine fury, in my braine &amp; brest. List then to mee, &amp; by my words produce, As the Rose tree, nourish't with gentle Dewes; Oh, let the savour of your vertues rise As Incence, or the smoake of Sacrifice! Flourish, as doe the Lillies; oh, rehearse Loud Songs of Praise, in never-Dying verse! Bless God in all his workes; Oh! bless his Name! With Himmes of Ioy, oh! Celebrate his ffame, In songs of Musicke! Let your vowes addresse To Heaven for audience, &amp; thus confess The Lord is mightie, all his workes are good, His precepts holy; nor can flesh &amp; Blood Safely dispute, Why now? or not till now, Why this? or that? He knowes both when &amp; how; And in his time, they are; at his Command, Th' impetuous waves did as a Mountaine stand; Gracious ever, &amp; his ordinance Is firm'd on Truth, &amp; cannot fall by Chance; He lookes on Man, on humane actions, With a strict Eye; all the Affections Of Mortalls stand before him, nothing hid; He sees what now wee doe, &amp; what they did, Who went before vs; what our Sons shall doe, For ever, nothing hard for him to know. How dare Man question (ah, foole-hardy wise) His inscrute power? Why did he That? Why This? He that made all things, made them All his owne, Both in the Thing, &amp; disposition; Infinite in his Blessings as the Tide W?? swelleth Rivers, watering either Side, The gapeing Shores; or as a Raine doth drench The crannied Earth, &amp; her Scorch'd entrailes quench: As the Sea foames in brine, the heathen shall Soe feele his wrath, &amp; in his fury fall; As to the Iust, his waies are Smooth &amp; streight; Soe Sinners, walking, fall precipitate. For good Men, good things were ordain'd, at first; For Sinners, good &amp; bad, in both accurst; These, humane beings serve most to sustaine, Water &amp; Fire, Iron, Salt; &amp; graine From carefull furrowes reapt; the luscious combe Contriv'd by busie Officers; &amp; from The Cowe's large vdders Milke; the vnmixéd blood Of generous Grapes; the iuce of Olives, good As well for health, as the fond sence to please; And necessary Raiment; all of these To good Men are good Things; but ev'n in these (Though the possessing 'em, may haply please) Sinners shall find a Curse; presumptuous Sin Is not vnpunisht ever; some have bin Created for revenge, &amp; now abide Eternall paines, for voluntary Pride; These in the Day of wrath, when all this all, This mighty fabrick, shall to nothing fall, Shall shew their vtmost, &amp; then satisfie Heaven's fury, Damn'd to all Eternitie. Fire, in a kind, &amp; Haile, famine &amp; Death, Are the dire Instruments of heaven's wrath; The Teeth of Wild beasts, and of Serpents' Sting, The greedie Sword, &amp; every other thing, Will fall vpon the Wicked; &amp; all stand Readie to execute heaven's great command; Sinners cannot avoyde the Stroke, nor stay The fatall houre to any farther day. Therfore was I confirm'd, after I had weigh'd, Iudiciously, these things, &amp; what I said I here leave written: oh! how excellent Is God in all his workes! to give the Event Of all Things, in due time, &amp; to the houre Disposeth all things, by Almighty power: That 't would be folly to dispute w?? him; He gives the Blessing ever to the Time, And therfore praise him ever; oh! reioyce, And magnifie his Name, w?? chearfull voice! Chap. xl. Oh, how is mankind wretched? Man, at first, Fell, &amp; in him, his Sons are all accurst; From the sad Mother's Wombe, their houre of birth, Till they fall to their Common Earth, Their thoughts are fickle &amp; their hearts impure, Their fancies fruiteless, &amp; their End vnsure; From him who sitts vpon the golden Throne, To him that lives obscure &amp; dyes vnknowne; From high'st to low'st; from him who beares y? Crowne And sweieth the Scepter, Circled in renowne Of brave atcheiuements, in a Robe of fine And Costly Silke, thrice-dipt, to make it shine; To the low Drudge, in rugged Canvas clad, Who lives in sweat, for all the state he had. Wrath, envy, Trouble, Miserie, &amp; Cares, Dissention, Fury, &amp; a Thousand Feares Of Death &amp; Dangers, follow humane state; And Sleep addes more then it can mittigate: For the vaine ffeares wee can by Day invent, Wee see by Night; what horrid formes present Themselves in Dreams! what numerous shapes arise T' affright poore Mortalls! ah, how nothing is Man's quiet here! when sleep, w?? should be peace And the Soule's Sanctuary, offers fresh Obiects to his Distraction; warre &amp; Death Disturbe his restless Thoughts; till now, he hath Plung'd his Imagination; Opes his Eyes, And, all in safety, doth his Dreame despise; These to all flesh, both Man, &amp; Beast, but all These plagves redoubled, vpon Sinners fall; Strife, Blood, &amp; Death, shall rage where they abide. The Sword shall reake in Murder by their side; Oppression, famine, &amp; Destruction, theirs, And punishment shall follow in their heirs; Thus shall the Wicked suffer, as from first It was ordain'd; for them the World was Curst In the sad deluge, and the Earth, which stood Once blest by Heaven, lay pickled in a flood; All things of Earth shall turne to Earth againe, And all of Water, to th' insatiate Maine. Iniustice shall not flourish, nor the gaine Of vsurie, a Treasure, still remaine; But Truth &amp; Iustice, ever these shall Shine, A Death-less honour, and a Wreath Devine. The Wealth of Sinners, as a brooke shall Drie, As Thunder in a raine the Noise shall flye. Ioy crownes the Giver, heaven doth bless his store, But the Oppressor shall live ever Poore; His Children shall but heir him; vnto them Shall be noe Sons, t' inherite in his Name; But as a worthless Root vpon a Rocke Dyes, without Blossomes, wasteth in the Stocke: Early the Spring, &amp; in her greatest Pride Boasteth her verdure, by a River Side; Yet there she Suffers first, &amp; when, now greene, They fall away, as had they never beene. Love, as a Garden water'd by heaven's hand, And Mercy, shall for ever glorious stand. To Ioy in Sweat is happines, but more, To live vntroubled in an Ample Store. Children, or Cittyes built, may keep a Name, But a good Woeman, much excelleth them. Wine glads the heart, &amp; Musick stirrs the Spright, But Wisedome gives more Ioy &amp; more Delight. The Pipe &amp; Psalterie may please the Sence, But a sweet Tongve is of more Excellence; Beautie &amp; Feature, may the Eye-sight please, But a green Corne-feild, more then either these. A freind is good, and a Companion, Sometimes may please, but to a Wife is none In trouble; Freinds &amp; Help are of availe, But Almes deliver, when these often faile. What Cannot Gold or Silver? Yet 'bove them Is Councell, in the Godly Man's Esteeme; Riches &amp; Strength may please vs, but y? feare Of God transports vs to a higher Sphere. Wee ioy in fullnes, &amp; Subsist in might, Nothing then it more Faire, nothing more sweet. My son! oh, never let thy Sloth betraye Thy fortunes vnto want or beggerye; Better to Dye then Beg; how truly can His Life be call'd a Life, or he a Man, Whose being is not in him but depends Vpon the Charitie of a few freinds? Another's Table feeds him, &amp; the heat Of Appetite oft rageth for his Meat; This will a Wise Man shun, &amp; rather strive, In his owne Sweat, to gaine him how to live; Only the Impudent finds pleasure in Begging, &amp; makes Povertie his Sin; To live in C?mon, &amp; with Blush-les face, Importune Pittye tell his owne hard Case To Every Eare; but begging cannot serve; Where Begging is, Men for food may sterve. Chap. xli. Where an Aboundance is, where Man doth rest Pleas'd in his Soule w?? what he is Possest, Where all felicitie the Earth can boast Courts a poore frailtie, that he stands almost The World's Sole Minion, how can he resigne The sweet fruition &amp; Entertaine Death's fatall Summons? Oh, with what a hart Shall he receive it? How can these long freinds part In Patience? Death, or th' vnwelcome word That Death may come, by rich Men, is abhorr'd. But where a Soule lyes groninge, in the Sad Whirlepoole of Memorie, to thinke he had Once an Estate of Plentie, now to lye Starv'd in his wants, opprest in Miserie. Or to the Man (who whilome was a Man But now a Child againe, or if less can Be then a Child,) worne with the Iron wheele Of a Sad Age, whose feeble Members feele Perpetuall Aches, bed-rid in his Sence; Imperfect meerly, and 's Intelligence Lost or forgotten; when a Curséd Age Brings him to dotage, Passion, Anger, Rage. Or where a Soule lies tugging in th' vnsure Quicksprings of Conscience, &amp; has noe more power To wrastle out; impatient leaves, almost Desperate, in Doubts for ever to be lost; Where every obiect is a fresh occasion Of Miserie; where can be noe Evasion, There, Death is sweet; oh happines beyond The low Conceptions of a vulgar Mind! Be not afraid of Death, though it may Seeme To thy thoughts terrible; remember them Who went before, &amp; know, as many shall Come after thee; thus God ordaines to All; Death once must come; &amp; why should yo? oppose The pleasure of the highest? He best knowes Who gave, to take; What if the vncertaine Date Of Mortalls, in ten years, be Terminate? What if a hundred, or a Thousand Shall Summe vp thy Age if thou at last shalt fall? And once thou must; ffrom Death is noe repreive; Man may live long, but cannot ever live. Heare mee, againe, my Children; let the Dresse Of Wisedome cloth y? words of Wisedome, Peace: Wisedome concealéd in a private breast, Or treasure hourded in an vnknowne Chest, What good in Either? Silence better fitts Illiterate Fooles then firme &amp; solid Witts; Therfore attend my Words, some time 't may be A preiudice to faile in Modestie; It is not ever comely; a bold face, To some things, stands y? Ornament &amp; Grace. Here be asham'd, &amp; let thy blushes rise From a lanch't heart, of thy vnchastities Before thy Parents, &amp; before thy Prince; Of Lies to Magistrates; of an offence Of Sin, before the People; of Deceit To a Companion or Intimate; Of Theft before thy Neighbours, &amp; before God &amp; his Truth, the Word which he hath swore; Of Rudenes, Incivilitye, of Pride; To vnloose the Chayne humanitie hath tyed In Equall obligation, ffreind to ffreind; To aske, to borrow, to restore, to lend; Blush to be Silent, in the C?mon Iest Of civill salutation; or to feast Lascivious Eyes with Sin; to see by Chance A needie Kinsman, &amp; feigne Ignorance; To oppresse the poore Widdowes, or to deprive From Orphans; to seduce another's wife; To tempt a virgin, or Approach the Bed Of Innocence, in a poore Maidenhead; To scorne thy ffreinds, to boast thy Courtesies, To Carry Newes, or reveale Secrecies; These thinges are Shamefull; shun these crooked waies, And to the World thou shalt survive with praise. Chap. xlii. Here safely maiest thou tread; in all of these Be Confident to please Men, or Displease. First, of the law of God; to Witnes Truth, For vertue with an vncontrouléd Mouth To Iustifie thy ffreind; or the right knowne, A stranger's honour; to Dispose thy owne; To preserve Iustice with a perfect Scale; To make thy owne Content, or great, or Small; To bargaine ffairely, &amp; keepe honest trade; To Correct Children, t' vse (where th' art betray'd By a false servant) rigour; to restraine A wife Immodest, in her entertaine; To locke vp all Things; Treasure to conceale, Where many hands are to purloine &amp; steale; To take a due account of all affaires, And keep in writeing, how &amp; what they are; T' instruct the Simple; teach the illiterate; To help old Men falsely preiudicate; These beare a Warrant, in these feare noe shame, Honour &amp; Glory shall enrich thy Name. A Carefull Father will an order keepe In honour of his Daughter; though she sleepe His thoughts are busie, lest her youth Decay A Virgin, or she, Married, diss-obey; Lest when the Roses in her Virgin Cheeke Blush Woman, &amp; perfections handsome Speake, She fall ignobly to a Shamefull bed, And the Wombe, gviltie, publish what she did. Or, haveing fairely past a virgin's Life, To take a Husband and become a Wife, Least she be scandalous, either to wrong Her honour or her Oath; or if she long Be without Issue, least she Barren prove: How many feares rise from a father's love! To an Immodest daughter be Severe, Lest thy ffoes tryvmph, &amp; the vulgar Eare Be privy to her Shame; &amp; her Crimes rise Thy ignominy to thy Enimies. Sin not to looke on Beautie, &amp; abstaine To meet with Woemen at an Entertaine; For Sin is of the Woeman, as a Mothe Bred in the Wooll, &amp; nourish't by the Cloth. Better a Sullen Man then the sweet fface Of Woeman's Courtesie, w?? brings disgrace. I will now tell of higher things, and Speake The Workes of God; how great they! I, how weake! By his word they were all: the Sun doth range Heaven's studded Pavement; and behold the Strange And secret things the Machine doth present; A Glorious Worke! a Maker Excellent! Was't not ordain'd by God that holy Men Should travaile in his wonders? and commend Them, written, to Posteritie; the more To shew his Glorie, and confirme his Power? Hee tryeth the Depth, or Deeper then the Deepe, The heart of Man; the Secrets which all keepe In humane bosome; for he knoweth all Times, Seasons, Ages, How and when they fall; Things past, and things to come; things secret, and Ignote, as Daylight in his Presence stand; Thought cannot passe him, nor an Accent breakes Vnheard; noe whisper, but to him it Speakes; In the disposure of his workes, how Wise! Hee hath ordain'd them Glorious to all Eyes; Hee was from ever, and shall ever raigne; None can adde to him; Noe Man soe profane Dare take away or lessen; only Wise, Able to governe All, by selfe-Advice. How glorious are his Workes! how delectable! But (oh) the thought of Mortall is not able To Comprehend the least; they live and Shall For ever fflourish and obey his Call; They are all Double that opposeth this; Nothing done by him can be done amisse; His worke is perfect All, but Man is Weake To Apprehend the height, much less, to Speake. Chap. xliii. The Firmament &amp; all those lights w?? Shine In heaven's bright Pavement Speake a worke devine. The Sun, whose Influence doth glad the Earth With gentle Shine, when pensive shades give birth To the resplendent Morne; whose heat, at Noone, Scorcheth the Earth, &amp; Makes the Pilgrim grone; The Mountaines gape, impatient of his Raies, To which the forge-Man, broyling, is an Ease; Bright Inflamations from it, &amp; the Shine Cannot be fixt vpon by Mortall Eyne: Great is the Lord, that made it; he hath given It a swift Wheele, to scoure y? Arch of heaven; The Moone, Inferiour to her Brother's light, Glides in clear Skyes, &amp; Gvildes the walles of Night, Vncertaine in her course; now hornéd wide, And then againe her Orbe at full displaied; Thus Times distinguish't are, &amp; ffeasts are knowne; The Moneth by Daies is call'd soe by the Moone. It is a part of heaven's all-glorious Host; The stars adorne heaven's Canopie, dispos'd In a true order, Diverssly Commixt To God's C?mands; some wand'ring, some are fixt. Behold the Raine-Bow, &amp; admire to see Transparant Shadowes mixt Contiguouslie; It doth adorne the firmament, &amp; stands As it was placéd, by Almightie's hands. The Snow finds Passage, &amp; the Direfull Sword Of Tempest breakes, to execute his Word Full, in his Treasures; &amp; doth breake the Face Of Clouds, now gather'd, in a Silent place; Which Scoure the Region of the infected Aire, In Shoales disparted, fleeting here &amp; there; Or, he the Waters in a Cloud doth call, To drench the Earth; he melts the strikeing haile; The Mountaines leape; y? south Winds doth not blow But to his pleasure; When, &amp; Where, &amp; How. The Thunder strikes the Earth, and y? black North Falls in a Storme; the whirlewind rusheth forth, The snow he scattereth, ev'n as birds doe flye, And falls, as grasshopers on Earth doe lye; Nothing soe white vnto the Eye of Man; The Substance, thawed, floweth as a raine; Frost, sent as salt, the poud'red Earth is here; The Trees are bare'd, &amp; Plants are Candid ore. When the bleak North, in ffurye 'gins to rise, He prisons vp the waters in an Ice; Rivers in Christall bound, which doth adorne The streames, as brest-plates by a warriour worne; It rageth on the Hilles, &amp; maketh Seire, The barren desart; it consumes, as ffire, The verdant Earth, (as it had never beene Gorgeous at all) lyes starved &amp; nothing greene; Thus, till a Cloud, swolne w?? a fluent raine, Refresh the Earth, &amp; make it bud againe; Soe, for the Summer's Sun (noyance as great) A gentle Dew falls, to allay the heat. The Winds obey his Word, he calmes y? Deepe, And girts the Ilands, in her Armes to keepe; The Pilot tells the dangers of the Sea, Wee wonder, 'cause wee know not what they be; Vnheard of Monsters, &amp; deforméd Shapes Of Creatures range the Ocean; the while gapes In her darke pathes, &amp; as a Hill doth Sweepe, The white-mouth'd Billowes of y? vnsounded Deepe. Thus all things made by him, were all made good, And by his word Immoveable they Stood. But words fall short to speake of him, &amp; when Wee have spoke all, we apprehend as Men. Wee greatly faile, wee cannot better call Him in his Workes, then that he is all in all. How can we praise him else? for hee's beyond, As farre beyond his Workes, as they above our Mind. The Lord is terrible, for ever great; Vnlimited in Power, Strong is his Seat. O! Praise the Lord! oh, say, what you can Say, To Magnifie his Glorie! Yet you may Leave off ashaméd, lift a stronger voice Vnto his Name, bend all your faculties To Speake of him; &amp; leave to see him higher, Then you can Speake, or thinke, or but Admire. Ah! who has seene him that he might report To vs the happines? Who falls not Short In words to Speake of him? For greater farre Then we have said, or Can, his Glories are. Can wee say secret things beyond our light, For of his Workes but few come to our sight; But he made all things, did inspire a flame Of Wisedome vnto those that feare his Name. Chap. xliv. Now let's the Praise of famous Men rehearse, And our dead fathers, in a liveing verse; Who servéd Heaven, &amp; gave the Lord his Due, For all his Glories; who did Realmes subdue, And ruléd Kingdomes; govern'd well &amp; long; Were Wise in Councell, &amp; in Rapture strong. They govern'd wisely, &amp; their wisedome taught Vnto the People, as they rightly ought; They first Invented Musicke, &amp; could teach Misterious verse to everie vulgar reach; Full in their Treasures &amp; their wealth to blesse, Compleat in years, &amp; never knew but Peace; By Children honour'd, &amp; to honour them They flourisht, in a large &amp; Spreading Stem; Their Age's Glorie, &amp; have left a Name To vs, of Praise, in an Eternall Fame. How many Die, as they had never beene, (Mightie &amp; Great, when they lived here as Men,) How soone they perish! &amp; their Memorie Is dasht, vnknowne vnto Posteritie! Their Children lye, Close'd in the fatall Vrne, Without a Name, as they had not been borne. But these of whom wee Speake, (though I wer Dumb), Are regist'red with praise, for time to come; They were Iust Men, &amp; of a tender Soule, Their Sons shall flourish in the golden rolle Of a clear ffame, &amp; in their Father's Merit They find a Glorie, ever to inherit A Ioyfull Portion; though their Ashes lye In Silent Grave, their Names &amp; Memorye Shall live for ever; &amp; remaine a Storye T' expresse a vertue forcive in their Glorye. Enoch was Iust, &amp; had Translation For the Conversion of a froward Nation; Noah was found perfect, &amp; had his reward In the Sad Time; the roareing deluge Spar'd Him, that his seed might flourish to y? Earth, And giue a Second Age, a happie birth. 'Twas a firme contract made w? him, to Stand To his Sons ever; that the Face of Land Should noe more floate, nor Creatures take a grave From the Earth, borne in such a horid wave. Abraham was Father of a progenie Numerous &amp; Iust: was none so great as he; He kept the Law, &amp; in his Seed 'twas made A Covenant, w?? can nor fall nor fade. He was found perfect in temptation; Therfore God made an Oath that Everie Nation Should flourish in his Seed, &amp; they should stand Numerous as Atom's or the vncounted Sand, As the starres Glorious; &amp; their land to reach Farre as the Sea surrounds or y? Poles stretch. This he confirm'd to Isaac, for the Love His Father Abraham found, &amp; the behoofe Of Everie People; &amp; did Seale the Oath On Iacob's head, he promis'd to them both; Here did he Bless, &amp; in him Iacob found Ample possessions, w?? himselfe saw Crown'd With hopefull Sons t' inherite, who became The head of Tribes, rememb'red in their Name. Chap. xlv. From whom came Moses; Moses, in the Eyes Of God &amp; Man deare; whose Fame never Dyes; He made him glorious as the Saints, &amp; great Vnto his Enemies; at his entreat The Wonders ceas'd: in the sight of Kings He made him Glorious; gave him holy things, To train the People; made his Glorie Shine A heavenly obiect, vnto Mortall Eyne. He did Select him, of all worthy Most, As Perfect, Faithfull, Gratious, &amp; Iust. God talk'd with him, he heard his voice aloud, And stood vpon the Mountaine, in a Cloud; He gave a Law vnto him, to record Vnto the People; &amp; a perfect Word, T' instruct the house of Iacob, &amp; Declare To Israel his Iudgments, what they were. He rais'd Aaron, like to him, as one Vpright &amp; Iust, in Levi's Portion. He made a Covenant, &amp; did Assigne Him to the People, Sacred &amp; Devine; He did appoint for him a holy Vest, Fitting his Preisthood; &amp; his Function blest; His Girdle fixt, bright robes he put vpon His shoulders, that his Glorie might be knowne; An Ephod, &amp; a Coate Embroidered faire, Rich to the Eye, &amp; Comely for the Weare; With Golden Bells he did adorne him round, To give the People notice by their Sound; A holy Garment, wrought in twisted gold, Blue Silk, &amp; Purple, glorious to behold; A Brest-plate of Pre-Eminence, a Signe Vrim &amp; Thummim, of a Truth Devine; A Worke of Scarlet, curiously Enchas't; Rich stones, faire graven, w?? were seemly plac'd; Infulgent Gold, Cut for a true record, Of all the Tribes of Israel, to the Lord; A Mitre Crown'd with Gold, w?? did adorne His Browes, in honour of his Preisthood worne; A worke of Price, and Gorgeous to the Eye, Denoteing Honour, Power, &amp; Sanctitye. Such before never were, &amp; these for none To weare, but his sons in succession. Twice every day he made the Altar Smoake In Sacrifice, as God to Moses Spoke; Moses anointed him w? holy Oyle, For ever Sacred, to his seed; &amp; while The Heavens are a Covenant to the Rest, Blessing the People, as anointed Preist Chosen by God, to offer Sacrifice; And Expiate, for the People, to his Eyes; In his Commands he gave him Power to Solve Or Iudge Offences, in the Law's behalfe. That he should publish Truth to Iacob's race; And shine for ever in his Holy place; Vnruly faction, Baffled at his Power, Dathan, Abiram, &amp; the Men of Core: This, heaven saw, and in the heat of Ire, Sent downe his Iudgments; some he burnt with fire, At sinfull rites; the greedie Earth did Gape To swallow them, that not a Man should Scape. But Aaron had more honour; loe, his Rod Due to the Tribe, began to spring &amp; Bud; A Monument against them; for his ffee, He gave the holy things; &amp; generallie The first-fruites of the first-borne; Holy bread; For Preists did Eate the Victims &amp; their Seed; This was his Portion, not by the survay Of measur'd lands, commixéd w?? the Lay; But an allotted Portion from the Rest, By God himselfe to him &amp; his sons Blest. Now hear of Phineas, Eleazar's Son, Zealous to God, whose glorious action Shall never Die; when Israel to sin Had a relapse, he, valiant to win A Glorious freedome to the People, stood Their Champion, &amp; trivmph't in the blood Of wicked Zimri: to attone the crime With God, right gracious, in the truth of him; He made with him a Covenant of Peace, In holy Preisthood, w?? can never Cease; As he did make a perfect Covenant With David, that his Seed should never want To Governe Iudah, soe he did ordaine That Aaron's fee should to his seed remaine. Oh! may wee see, by devine Inspiration, Their vertues glorious, that wee may fashion Our Actions by their Square; &amp; recommend Them, holy, Iust, &amp; Glorious to the End. Chap. xlvi. Iesus, the son of Nun, renown'd in Warre, A Worthy Successor to Moses' Chaire; Inspir'd with Prophecie, a Saviour As in his Name, in Vertue, &amp; in Power; Who did great Kings Subdue, to re-advance Depresséd Israel, in the Inheritance; How Glorious, when he came against the Walls Of Cittyes! how trivmphant in their ffalls! Was there none like to him, in times foregone, In holy War, heaven's holy Champion. The Sun in Gideon stood, that he might smite His Enemies, vntroubled w? the Night; Hee call'd to Heaven, when his fainting ffoes, In Numbers Numberless did him enclose; And the great Lord sent Hailestones to subdue The faithless Host, more w?? the hailestones slew Then the strong Sword; as Torrents in their Course, He came vpon them, with a mighty force; In the discent to Bethar, that his Sword Might be knowne strong in battell for y? Lord. In Moses' time, the Son of Iephuneth And Iosuah, concurring in a ffaith, Oppos'd the Giants; did withold from Sin The grumbling Israelites; of all the Men (Six hundred thousand) but these two did stand, T' enioy a Portion, in the promis'd Land. Caleb was strong, &amp; God his Age did Bless, That he might goe vp higher, to Possess An heritage in Peace,—Hebron,—w?? stood A Portion for ever, to his Blood; That Israel might see a large reward Fall to his Zeale, in service of the Lord. Now for the Iudges, who were Iust &amp; Pure, Their Memories for ever shall endure; Let their Vrnes fflourish, &amp; their Names not Dye, But shine for ever in their Progenie. Samuel, God's Chosen, strong in Prophecie, Sacred in power, Inspiréd from on high, Ordainéd Kings, &amp; Princes did Anoint Cheife ore the People, Cheif in every point; In Truth he Iudg'd the People, &amp; the Lord Was gracious vnto Iacob in his Word. Samuel was faithfull ever; to his Mouth His visions did agree with equall truth; He call'd to heaven, when the rude Philistines Beset him round, strong in his pure designes; When he the Ean-ling offer'd, Thunders flew From angry heaven, &amp; the proud vanters slew. The haughty Tirians were disarm'd, and all The Philistines in Israel did fall; Yet, ere he Died, to the Almightie's view, To his Anointed, &amp; the Vulgar Crew, He stood &amp; Cried, Loe! tell if I have done The least Iniustice or Oppression; Have I beene factious or Corrupt? who stands To prove my gvilt? Tell mee, have these my hands Detain'd the least of yours? What have I done? Will none accuse mee? &amp; there was not one. When now he slept, recall'd, he did foretell The Death of Saul, lamented Israel. Chap. xlvii. He, dead, rose Nathan, full in Prophecie; In David's time, none soe vpright as hee; As the ffat is disparted from the Vict, Soe David from the People, by the strict Survey of Heaven: he pluck'd the Lyon's Beard And Slew the Beare, w?? ravin'd in his heard; When but a youth, he trivmph't in the blood Of the great Philistine; who vanting stood The Single Combat, in a bold Defye To all the Host; when none durst make reply, Did not He lay his Glorie in the Dust, With a strong Arme? Strong in the Lord of Host, Who gave his right hand Strength to vindicate A Iustice on the Giant, &amp; Elate A Glorie to the people; Soe the Meed Was of Ten thousand his; a Crowne Decreed T' adorne his Temples; in the Conquest got He ceaséd not, till he had routed out The curséd Memorie, the mightie power Of Philistines, to be againe noe more; In all he did, he did the Praise rehearse To God in Songs &amp; never-Dying verse; His heart was Ioyfull in him, &amp; his Praise, In mighty Rapture, did his Spirit Seize. Before the Altar, for an Ornament, He placéd Singers; each his Instrument, His holy Chanzons fitted to their String, And taught the People Hymmes of Praife to Sing. Hee did appoint, to dignifie the feasts, A Decent Order, &amp; the Solemne hests, Distinguish't by the Times; y? they might praise God in his holynes, to all their Daies. His Sins were blotted out; his Name doth shine For ever glorious; &amp; the Lord, in fine, Made a strong Covenant, y? from him one Should never faile to sitt in Iudah's Throne. From him a Wise Son came, by heaven blest In large Possessions, which his Sire Possest. Salomon raignéd in a happie Age, A Time of Peace; he governéd by Sage And sound Advice; the Kingdomes knew not warre; That he, a Man of Peace, the Church might reare. How beyond all Men Wise! thy Wisedome came In holy Sayings, fluent as a Streame; Thy Mind was large as all this Vniverse; Thy Proverbs grave &amp; hid, w?? who reherse Are struck with Wonder &amp; a blind amaze; The Ilands knew thy Name, &amp; lov'd thy Peace; The world admired thee in the depth of fixt And Solid Wisedome, of a holy Text; In rapture beyond all borne in the Sphœre Of holy things; revelling in the Cleare And Glorious Magazine of faith, t' vnfold Misterious Truths, high Oracles of old. By heavenly Power, y? God of Iacob's Name, Silver as Lead, thy Gold as Copper, came; Rich beyond all Men; Wise beyond compare; Iust in thy owne; Magnificent, afarre. But (ah!) thou fell to Sin; &amp; fraile, was led A Captive by the Eyes, to know y? Bed Of Stranger Woemen; didst obscure y? Shine Of all thy vertues, &amp; pollute thy Line In the Succession, &amp; brought Sorrow downe Vpon thy Son's dishonour, to thy Crowne; Soe 'twas Devided; Ephraim did rise In a Strong faction, Iudah to despise; Nath'less, God left him not, nor gave his Glorie A Spoile to Time, but for a liveing Storie; Nor did he take away what he decreed Posteritie t' inherite in his Seed; But left a branch to Iacob, &amp; a flower From David's Stocke to be Inheritour. Thus Salomon did w?? his Fathers rest, And left Roboam, a by-word and a Iest, Before the People, inconsiderate; Who made the People grone w?? double waight, And burdens Insupportable; they went From their Allegiance by a ioynt consent. And Ieroboam, who taught Israel The way to Sin, by whom Ephraim fell; That now full in their Sins, they left the Land: Compell'd in Iustice, by a ffurious hand. Cap. xlviii. Then came Elias, holy &amp; Devine, His words were pure, &amp; as a Lampe did Shine; He brought a famine to Consume their Seed, Ripe in their Sins, to Baal madly led; He bound the Clouds, &amp; three times brought down fire. O, great Elias, how can wee admire Thy many wonders! who can make a boast Of Power with thee? Thou didst recall the lost Son of a Widdow, from the pensive Shade Of Death, to Live, &amp; make his Mother glad; Who ruin'd Princes, brought the haughty downe To abiect basenes, from the imperiall Throne; Who heard the Lord in Sina, saw his Ire In Horeb, w?? an Earthquake, winde, &amp; Fire; Who didst anoint Kings, for a wicked race; And Prophets, to Succeed thee, in thy place; Who rapt by Miracle, in a bright Wind, Went to inherit, as it was assign'd; Who shall appease heaven's ffury, ere it rise Into a flame, bring peace in the neare ties Of Son &amp; Father; &amp; Erect the house Of Iacob, in the Tribes most glorious. Blesséd were they who saw thee, &amp; could boast A freindship with thee; for wee live almost Noe Life, or but in Life; for in the Grave, Wee cannot hope the liveing Name they have. Elias, in the ffierie Rapture fled; Stood Elizeus vp, replenishéd With his strong Spirit, who could never stoope To slave his vertue, for a servile Hope; Whom nothing Danted; to confirme his faith, His bodie rose, &amp; Prophecied in Death. But yet, (alas,) the People wanted ffaith, And would not see, till Asshur, high in pride, Led them away, &amp; did their Land Devide; That but a few remainéd to the King, In Iudah's Throne, who did from David spring; Of these, some Iust, some Wicked, when the Crowne Fell to Ezechias, in Succession: Hee built the Citty, faire; &amp; did convay Water into the streets, a secret way; Cisternes of Stone he made, &amp; Pipes to bring The Waters, &amp; receive them from their Spring. The proud Assirian Monarch sent his Host, Now (to Sacke Sion,) in the haughty boast Of Rabshakeh; and as a woeman's paine Possesseth her, soe are the people tane, With soudaine ffeare; but lifting vp their Voice To the great Lord, in Sacred Embasses Of ffaith, he heard; forgot their Sins of Old, Stood for the Citty; made the people bold; Brought them from woemen's feare, feare worse then Death, To a bright freedome in Elias' ffaith; He smote the Host of Asshur; in the Night He made his Angell for the People fight. For, loe! the King was Iust in all his waies, Heir to the vertue of a Princely race; Strict to the Prophet Esay in his word, As Inspirations giv'n from the Lord. In whose Time, to confirme the word of heaven, The Sun went back, the King had new Life given; Ioy to the Walls of Sion he did bring; Where Sorrow raigned, he made y? People Sing; He told what should be ever; did vnfold Deep Misteries, vnknowne to them of Old. Chap. xlix. Now of Isaias tell, whose Memorie Is Sweet, oh, sweeter farre then perfumes be! ffragrant as Balme; as Honey to the Tast; Gracefull &amp; ffaire as Musique at a Feast; Iust in himselfe, strict to the C?mon good; The people he recall'd, (from where they stood ffrom sinfull waies,) vpon false Gods to trample, And keep Religion, by his owne Example. David &amp; Ezechias we may bring, Co-paralels in Glorie with this King. These only perfect; for ev'n Iudah's Kings Fell from the Law, &amp; sought for newer things; They forfeited the glorie of their Throne, And gave their honour to a Land vnknowne; Who burne the Citty, Holy things deface, Pull downe the Walls, the Houses Sack &amp; Race. Foretold by Ieremie, whom they entreat With bitternes; A Prophet, chosen yet In Embrion; sanctified from the Wombe, To Bless or Curse, with an impartiall Doome. Ezekiel saw a glorious Vision Of ffierie Cherubs in transition; He Spoke of Enimies, as of a Storme; He fixt the good, &amp; Sinners did reforme. Let the twelve Prophets fflourish in their Dust, By their Vrnes Safe, their Memories ne'r lost; Iacob in them was glad, their ffaith did stand, Th' vnmovéd Pillars to a mighty Land. What can we adde t' enrich the voice of Fame, In Praise of Zorobabel's glorious Name? A Signet for the Hand; Iosedeck's Son, As Iust as He, who Equallye went on, In brave designes, to re-erect God's House, And 'twas ordain'd, for ever Glorious. With these was Nehemias, whose renowne Shall flourish ever; who rebuilt the Towne Swallowed in Ruines; made the Citty safe; Gave being to the Houses we now have. But none like Enoch was, of humane birth, Borne from the Earth, but never fell to Earth. And Ioseph, perfect, deare to God &amp; Man; Lord of his Brothers, Ruler in the Land Of Egipt vnder Pharaoh; the strong staffe Of Israel; whose bones were tombéd Safe. Sem &amp; Seth; Iust, but certaine there was none Soe pure as Adam, in Creation. Chap. l. Simon ONIADES, whose Life may boast The Glories of the Temple, in the Cost Of stately Battlements, &amp; high-rear'd Walls, In Double Measure to the former ffalls; He did repaire the Cisternes, &amp; restore Salomon's Ruines, in the Sea of Ore; A Father to the People, strict to gvide Them in Iust waies, &amp; from invasive Pride. How vpright in his Life! oh, how Devine! As the Day-starre set in a Cloud doth shine; As the Moone orb'd, or the Sun's brighter Raies, Or the fixt bow, soe glorious in his Daies; As in the Early Spring a fragrant Rose, Or Sprouting Lillies, when they first vnclose; As rich Sabæan gummes, or as the Spice Which from the Censer, in a perfume flies; Soe sweet, soe precious, &amp; Richer farre Then Golden vessells set with Rubies are; Faire as the Olive in a fertile ground, Or Cipress Trees, whose heads, in Clouds are bound; When in a Robe of honour, Clad in all The Accoutrements of State, &amp; Grace with all, He to the Altar went, &amp; made them shine (Not as faire Robes, but) Ornaments Devine; When he the Portions tooke from holy hands, Himselfe stood nere where the Altar stands, Environ'd by his Brethren; as vpon The glorious Summit of Mount Libanon, The Royall Cedar stands amid the Grove Of Trees inferiour; or with holy Love Circled in them, as in Engaddi, Palmes, With gratefull branches standing in Secure calmes; Soe all the Sons of Aaron stood: their hands Full in oblations, for the People Stands. That he might Satisfie his vowes vpon The holy Altar, to his Function, And make the Off'ring Comely; the pure blood Of generous Grapes he pouréd as he stood; Bright perfumes, in well-tasting smoaks arise To appease Heaven, &amp; Summe y? Sacrifice. Then did the Sons of Aaron Shout for ioy, And Brazen Trumpets Celebrate the high Immortall God; the People run to pay Their owne Devotions, &amp; prostrate lay Vpon the Earth; the holy Quire did ioyne The Sacred Anthemes, Melodie Devine; The People ioynéd in a fervent praier, Till all the Rites duely performéd were. Then went Hee downe, &amp; stretchéd out his hand (Vpon the intentive People, as they stand, To praise the God of Heaven) y? they might know A Power, in Doeing, what he seem'd to Doe. Now, therefore, let vs All, w?? ioynt Consent, Magnifie God, for ever Excellent; Who from the Wombe has blest vs, in our Age, And dealt with vs in Mercy, not in Rage; Pray wee that 't 'may be ever, &amp; that wee As they of old, may Peace in Israel see; That he will confirme Mercie for our Crime, And Succour our Necessities in Time. Two sorts of People I abhorre in Heart; The Third is none, being of both a Part; Who doe vpon Samarian Mountains sitt: The Philistine &amp; Foolish Sichemite. Iesus, son of Sirach, Eleazar's Son, Hath this Booke written, all y? he hath known, In a deep vnderstandinge; What the Chest Of his Soul treasur'd vp, is here exprest. Happy is he who liveth by this Rule; He shall be Wise, &amp; of a perfect Soul; He shall be seene in all things, for y? Light Of God shines here, to rectifie the feet Of hasty Mortalls, in a Dangerous way; Gives Wisedome, glads the Soul, w?? vertue's Ray. Chap. li. The Praier of Sirach's Son: My lord &amp; King, I will confesse thee, &amp; thy Praises Sing; Thee only will I Praise! oh, my Defence, My Life, My Being, to withstand all Chance! Might ruine mee; who hast preservd me long, Safe from the Malice of a Slandering Tongue; From lying lips, from my insulting ffoes Who blind in Fury, in a Tempest rose; From Secret Treasons, perills manifold; In glowing ffire, y? ffire could take noe hold; From rageing Passions; from the vnfathom'd deep Of blak despaire; from fantasies, w?? keep In Braines distracted; from the gvilt of foule Immodest Langvage, to bespot a Soule; From all vntruthes; from y? vncertaine ground Of seeminge hope to iniure or confound My Neighbour in Deceit; to abuse y? Eare Of Kings too Credulous, in what they heare. For ever will I praise thee, oh my God! My Soul was Sad, I travail'd in the road Of horrid darknes; Compasséd about With threat'ning ffoes, &amp; none to help me out; I look't about, to see if I could finde One freind for Aide; but there was none soe kind. When these helpes fail'd me, I begun to Cast My hopes on thee, thy glorious Acts forepast; How thou of old wast mighty to Secure And guard thy people from a forraigne Power. In confidence whereof I did advance My voice in Praier, for like Deliverance, Vnto the Lord, the Father of my Lord; That I might never Suffer by the Sword Of haughty ffoes, nor be left Desolate For Pride to Tryvmph on me, in my Fate. I will exalt thy Name, for ever Sing, A Song of Praise, to thee my God and King. My Praier was heard, t? sav'st me from y? Iawes Of black Destruction; from y? insatiate Mawes Of Persecution; therfore will I Praise Thy Glorious Name the Remnant of my Daies. When I was weake &amp; younge, ere I knew ought, I desired Wisedome, w?? a fervent thought; The Temple Stands a Witnes to my Vowes: (Where better could I then in such a House?) Lands far remote, I travail'd in her Quest; I found her out; in her, my Soul hath Rest; Studious to gaine her, from my younger yeares, With strict Attention &amp; with open Eares, I did Possess her, &amp; She Crown'd my Name Glorious, to an everlasting Fame. Therfore the Glory, gratefullie, I give To him who gav't, in &amp; by whom I live; For 'tis but Iust, &amp; not escape me shall, Goodnes herselfe vnprovéd, lest I fall; My Soul has Ioyn'd with her, in a hot strife; I have survaied the affaires of all my Life With Shame &amp; Wonder, plainly to behold Frailty soe forward, ignorance soe bold. I try'd a nearer way, &amp; found her pure; Clasp't her within my Bosome, to endure With mee for ever; found her in my Sweat; Therefore, I flourish in a Glorious Seat; And for Reward, I have a Tongue w?? shall Wax old, to Praise his Name who gave me all. Come near, you Miss-led People, I will teach You Sacred Precepts, 'bove the vulgar reach. Why doe yo? trifle? Dull, Illitterate, And Stupid Men, your Soules would gladly Sate Them in the words of Knowledge; why not able To Prize my Words? oh, yo? Incapable! For I have said, buy her without a Price; Be only humble, &amp; you shall be Wise; She stands to Court yo?; see! I tooke small Paine, Yet in the fullnes of her ioyes remaine. Get learning as a Treasure; to this Store Gold is Contemptible, &amp; Fortunes Poore. Let your Soules trivmph, and record the Praise Of God, full in his Mercy, all your Daies; Doe what yo? doe in Time: &amp; yo? shall find Reward to all yo? Actions in the End. The End. ? numero Devs impare gaudet. Thus have I travail'd, in the Dangerous waies Of a strange Countrey; Survai'd every Place, Seen every People, all the Affections knowne Which are in Mortalls; I have seene my owne Frailties &amp; Follies, Passions full in strife; I have Survaied the Affaires of all my Life With Shame &amp; wonder; plainly to Behold ffrailtie soe forward, Ignorance soe bold. Here I saw Man, &amp; read the private thought Of Humanes, what they are, &amp; what they ought; Here vertue crownéd is, &amp; I have seene A Throne of Glorie to receive this Queene. Here Wisedome dwelleth, &amp; her Temples shine With Truth &amp; Iustice, perfect &amp; Devine; Mercy, in spotless Robes of Innocence, And Charity, adorn'd w?? Excellence; Modesty, Temperance, &amp; all the good Can be made knowne, as in a Mirror stood. Againe, I saw all the Deformities Of Sin, the many heads of Hydra vice; Iniustice, party-colour'd; Murder, wrath, Oppression, Envy; &amp; the noisome breath Of black Detraction rose; I saw the fface Of Fraud, reverst; Adulterie, Excess, And Curiositye; I saw the Crimes Of these, our owne, and of all former Times. I stand amaz'd, when I collect my Thought T' instruct my Pen, what Precepts I had taught; I blush to see our great Siracides ffall to the Vote of a low Paraphrase; Ah let me Split my Pen, &amp; teare the Sheet; (My Soul is Sad, my Dull Eyes flame to see 't;) What have I done? Let me recant in Time, And wast my selfe in Tears, to wash my Crime; I am a statue, fixéd to behold Frailty soe forward, Ignorance soe bold: But now, ev'n now, (me thinkes) I see a Sparke Of Divine fire, t' illuminate the Darke Mists of a fainting Soul; oh! let me turne To Kisse the Flame; I'me cold &amp; cannot burne. Ah! let mee Creep to find it; 'tis almost Glareing in Embers; blow, or 'twill be lost; I, now it Spreads; See, now it rises higher! And from a Sparke, it is become a fire. I had beene lost for ever, but this Light Came to direct my poore depresséd Spright. Oh! glorious Light! oh! fflame certaine Devine, In my Darke Bosome maiest thou ever Shine! Oh! thou my Comfort! thou who didst inspire My frozen Spirits with this holy fire; Accept these Weake endeavors; Doubly thyne: Both as my Vow, and as a Right Devine. Thou who didst lead me, in my Iourney on Through all y? Affaires y? I have ever knowne, ffrom y? wombe vpward; in my Childhood kept Me safe from Danger,—when my Nurses Slept;— Safe in the Cradle; in the Slipperie state Of youth, didst guard mee from all dismall fate; Art now my Lord &amp; Gvide, now in the strong Estate of Man, &amp; the sweet Time of younge. Be Gracious still, that all my after-Daies, (Till Earth to Earth resolve, &amp; my Life Cease) Be to thy Glorie; &amp; my Dyinge Breath Magnifie thee; Let me not Die, in Death. Oh may these Lines Survive, when I am lost In the Darke Grave, &amp; Swallowed in Dust. May this of Me remaine a Monument Of Praise to thee, for ever permanent. Here stay my Wand'ring verse &amp; let me seale My Vowes, not in Expressions, but in Zeale. Desine plura musa ? ? cum imperat Me canemus 1639. Ianij vndecimo die. The End.</field>

When I am Earth, and what was counted sire Knitts to its Source, the naturall retire Of Elements; and somewhat yet beyond, (Which here wee cannot find) her selfe shall find Orbéd, and moueing in a sphœre, our Eyes Would peepe at, through the Glasse of faculties; When that fraile Ladder breakes, &amp; at one Leape, I've reach't from Earth the vndiscouered Steppe; This part of either, has its station, And ripens Dust vnto Imagination. Nothinge is Lost, but one concurrent flame Moves through the whole, to make all parts the same; And Nature link'd, one Spirit with the Blood; Sensible Substance; Ayre not vnderstood. Wonder not, when my other parts are free, I Dedicate this vnto Libertie; Not as I Liueing find it, in the word, But to an Age yet hence; when the abhorr'd Sence, a mistaken Error, shall be brought Cleare Truth; &amp; Peace adds Glory to warr-taught Numbers.

Thus little Witt is iustled of his feet, And kneaded lyes in the foule winding-sheet. Or for a Nobler funerall, when thrice It has beene read, &amp; euery one as wise As ere he heard it, &amp; can hardly say But that was first,—vnless a broke Glasse may Make him repent it; when he greedily Heareing verse Nam'd, thought it a propertie T' encline that hazard; and durst boldly doe it: Because 'twas short, seal'd Approbation to it. Forgot &amp; layd aside, the next Hand tears It, for his Pipe—Tobacco tooke in verse; A Nurseing flame, which being now put out, Is not yet dead, but fire the Braines about. I, this is Witt, at least in the next Roome, When Thirst of more, makes better troublesome; Some Squibbs prepareing are, the Ropes are laid To entertaine the Gapers; well, to lead Yo? further, in this smoke of Dreames, you'd Chide Like Men lost in a mist, or beat your Guide; Wee led yo? ore the Barren Cloud-wrapt Hill, That you may better praise the Vaile, w?? still Open to the rich Sun, repayes the Charge Of all his fuell, &amp; returnes a large Varietie, in well-sett Meads; soe wrought, The fforrest workes from Persia are not brought; Or if the banckes of full-spred Poesie, One violet Carpet less delight the Eye Then the faire-Glareing Tulip,—pluck the flower, You are satisfied,—&amp; wee indeed are more. When wine, digested w?? the Night, has sprung New Lusts, the Pumpe of Witt beats faire &amp; younge, And trills a Coppie, that the Spunges may Lick vp what he hath Squeez'd, another Day; But sober-Heads, whoe goe the time of Witt W?? a glad burthen, still produce 'em fitt And fully form'd; a Glorious Issue male, Borne to continue out the great Entayle: When female Bratts appeare w?? louder Claime, Th' inheritance is lost, vnto his Name. Some Generations hence, (Soe intricate Is Witt, as Blood, oft varied) 'twill be great Pussle to know how &amp; from whom deriu'd They claime, who shall posses it,—soe short-liv'd Not only familyes &amp; Kingdomes be, But Witt is Lost vnto Posteritie; And though the Name, like Lord, or Captaine, claime Eyes of the Towne to feed on,—'tis but Name; The Gapinge many, from a flatt-Crown'd Hatt, A Band Im-modeish, or, I wot not what Small singularity of Beard, or None; A Face in Cuerpo, or a Mourning one; Collections from a Tooth-picker, will Crye A Witt, a Witt,—as Lord, by Page or flye Of Pleasure is discouer'd; or as Lace Augurs a new-trimmed Captaine, 'bove his Face; And silver Hilt, (the Warrs now being done) Sett on a Lath, is valour through the Towne. As mouthéd Peasants, (throng to see the state, Their Ignorance it selfe did but Create, And Gape vpon the Gowne,—or Cap, &amp; Crye At scarfes &amp; Feathers, their giuen Liverie; To see their gay Retainers, Masters now, Devoureing Stewards, as they did not know The Glory they had Given) magnifie Merit, the Obiect of their Prodigie; Soe many Corkes keepe leaden Witt a floate, And hemme his Name about;—where ere yo? note Thin Cloaks pitting themselues,—Hee without Cloake Is a Witt in Hutts, a pretty spurringe Cocke. 'Twere a smart peice of Worke, &amp; worth yo? Eare, Should wee preuent yo? by our Proeme here; And w?? a Chronologicke Preface saue Your Patience, for what y' haue not or haue Read of the story; a minc't Chronicle, Seru'd in a stew'd Meat, to the second Meale; Hollingshead's mighty Loyne, a Voyder full Brought in a saucer; little spoone-Meats cull From Stowe's ill-fardled dry fatt: would yo? more? Olives, deep swett, in Iarre of Polidore; Speed, Cutt in sippetts, Trussell, layd about For a trayle Garnish; thus wee sett yo? out Perboyléd Kinges, &amp; Quadled Crownes; a Dish Fitt for the Appetite as yo? can wish; Maiestie laid in Pickle. What yo? saw T'affright your Stomacks, being fresh &amp; raw, Well house-wif'd, is become the Precious Part of your fare, The standing dish o'th' House; And yo?, perhaps, may like it soe much better; But—I'me a thinking now only the Litter, Washt in Eurotas, Love the Spartan Messe; A Black Broth is a Diet; you may guess Such Pottage-Eating stomackes; I am cleare Græcian, in what yo? please, but Persian here; For whither shall wee Live, by law, or vote? One Arbitrary, the other alters not. Why should I speake my owne? I write to please The world—a Poet-Sycophant; the Ease Is well-won honor; who would brood a Nest Of labour'd Fancy, for a Chicke, at best? Must many Mouthes liue from another's hand? And fatter-Cramm'd dyes sooner. Pretty fond Finches are taught to Cherrip w?? the Quill Mouth Clyster, &amp; their Notes their Panches fill. The little Bladder carryes all its weight, Ayre-full or Empty, 'tis in both soe light; Some who, too partiall, trye by their owne scale, May cutt Graines Atomes; find, &amp; Summe them All. 'Tis well! the World not Vniversally Is mad, but Province heads may Soberly Live in their first-giv'n Names; an Atticke face May safely walke some streetes; safe in the Lace Secures his Eyes from others, in mistake, Albertus motion, if it could but Speake. 'Twere well, if euery Man that is not wise Lost his Complexion, sun-burnt by such Eyes; For Leopard Learning is a finer Beast Then a Sire or Damme; well-freckled witts shew best; An Academick Raye makes 'em spring out More Landskip then your Box or Mapple root; 'Tis true, I've seene the fretworke of a Nose Worthy a Scyence; well,—but if it growes, The Wonder's lesse. Why may not wisedome sprout From Twigs, or Barke of Man, a liueing fruite? By strange exuberant Phlegme; as from some Trees Byll-twisted Barnacles, ripen to Geese. The Great Magician Time (whose Circle springes The Apparition of mistaken thinges) Fashions the shaddow finely; &amp; wee stand Trembling obseruers to his awefull hand. Haue yo? not seene the Mad world on a Heape Lye Squalling? &amp; the Nasty vermin creepe Her wild? to Iustle better Pasturage, Takeing advantage of neglected Rage; When Rebell Molls cast out the Ants w?? dwell Tennants to her, for Life, &amp; not at Will, The little wanderers seeke out new farmes, And from a family are many swarmes; Her Bodie but one Creeping Morphew is: Who wonders death in a Phthiristasis? Let Nero fiddle out Rome's Obsequies, And force the farre-spent world w? Tyrrannies. To run vneuen as a Roman Face Side-drawne; to confirme non-Antipodes; Should wee sing Prodigies to erect Eares? And bottle sea-wracke for the Bayes of verse? To give a louder Cracke, in the wild flame Of Censure; 'twere a Pot-Gun, worth a Name. I could make truth a wonder, &amp; Impose Faith, Tayle-Ioyn'd foxes hurrying Sylla's Nose, A Brand to wast the ffeilds; &amp; Tiber, great In liueing Waters, could not Quench the heat. Not Rome's now tripled glories to her first Could satisfy such a devoureing Thirst. A strange Catharre, whose flux doth run soe rife, The world's too narrow for a Hand-kercheife; Span Grece into a Cittye, if yo? list, A Meddall tyed t'Epimanonda's wrist; Chaine vp Pyræum w? an Oxe's Tayle, And through his Cloven hooves, convey her sayle; An Argosey, betwixt two Muscle shells; Iack Horner's Iustled into Citadells; 'Tis in our Traffique this; or shall wee bring Ormus y? Iewell, &amp; the world the Ring On Alexander's finger; or Compare Two mouthes of Sun vnto a Blazeing starre; And baffle out Quirinus, in the blood Or Peace of Cæsar; Each more like a God. Or bring a trayterous spider in the Twine Of her owne Thred to breake th' Arabian Line; Whose Cable Pietie vn-Anchoréd, Yet fixt her vessell steddie, in the Bed Of many waters meeting, &amp; Conspired A Glorie to our Bottom's better tir'd. What Man, attempting fayl'd, (whose caution Was certaine Empire in succession) Is done w?out a stratagem. The Blood Of great Almanzor, in a Cobweb flowed; And what the world admir'd, in Warre &amp; Peace, Is swept away, the Scorne of Cottages. See, not alone, Ambition Pursued, Tyrrannye scourgéd, Conquerors subdued, But vertue liable vnto the Check Of ffortune, a rent Obiect; Man, a weake Casket for such a treasure; Euery hand Of accident doth w?? a Picker stand, To scale the wards of Life;—How tedious This Proeme driues; yo? frowne; &amp; wee are thus Corrected; for the Elizar is a vaine Trifle, in Currencie of Spartan Coyne. The Generall Argument of this followinge TRINARCHODIA. The Point is Glory; Wee haue drawne a Line From mighty Edward; Richard walking in A rugged Path, totters, &amp; spinns yo? out A Thred to Carrye you, foe farre about; W?? his Successor, Harrie, from his hand Takes raw, to draw it finer. Vnderstand Actions of Kinges are but All Humane flaxe, His, worne w? many Knotts, to the last breakes; His son takes vp the Distaffe. Hercules Soe Spun a Thread, w?? was not Omphale's, Though farre remoued Calpe' did but Come, His Shuttle was the Beame 't Alcide's Loome. Our Worke is done; in short, wee shew yo? here, Glory in Great; in Little Platoe's yeare. The Raigne of Richard the second. 1 Whether from Ends pre-orderéd, Periods are, And necessary fate, involueth All: Or second Causes interpose, and share; Let better Pens resolve; our Naturall Temerities catch either; &amp; are loath To Chuse, where wee may better vse them both. 2 Soe shaddowes in a Glasse deceiue the Sence, And loose all Figure to the quickest Eye; Our Iudgments span to bring in Providence; Fancy assists to the discouerie; And something a farre off, wee wonder at: Like Spectrums in a Dreame, wee know not what. 3 To omit the Glories of Third Edward's raigne, Crescy &amp; Poiteirs, drawne by happy Pens; France humbled by his valour, and againe Repaird to her owne strength; the great pretence Of claime layd dead; Callis, of all the Rest Remains in France, of Edward's Interest. 4 Hee old, and to the Passions of Age A little bending, looses to the Fame And to the Power he had; Partyes engage; Factions grow stronge when Power sitts as Lame. Maiestie must be mouing, or the dreggs Of Earth will take its Crutches for their Legs. 5 But ere he fell, his son, Black Edward, Dyes: That starre of Conduct to sure victorye; An equall Soule to all the Prodigies Reported from the Faith of Historie. Nature's a Sphere w?? wee may leuell att, But fix her highest point, &amp; hee was That. 6 The Great Land marke of Honour now broke downe, The Billowes of disorder threaten All; Big Eolus must rore if Iuno frowne, And bid the Troians must be Tempest fall; Till the sea-God his Trident heauve, the Face Of Waters, then, were as the Chaos was. 7 The greater winds of Faction broke in here, To make a Wracke; w?? who may well preuent? Our Neptune is noe more; Edward, his Sphære Left, to walke in an Orbe more Excellent. Thus, when the Sun driues through his Tracke below, Small starres are bold, &amp; each his Light dare show. 8 Had Edward liued (whose m?nagement till now Proceeded equally, and did obscure Meteors of Faction, or enrich 'em through, That they might fall, an Influence, and Pure,) The State had stood; such vanities wee vse When ought shall happen w?? wee would not chuse. 9 But Edward's Fate was spun, that his Great Sire (As some obserue) might suffer for the Crime Acted to make him King. Who would goe higher Then Iustice warrants, Iustice Ruines Him. And Hee, who w?? one Curse impal'd his Head, Left it with woe, an Infant to succeed; 10 Richard the Second, in his Grandsire's Throne; Such hasty fates doe seldom happie prove; Irregularities are look'd vpon, But orderly Designes wee chuse and Love; Nature is noe man's Cuc-queane, but doth bring, By her owne steps, a way to euery thing. 11 'Tis seldome otherwise; a Child can adde Nothing to Power; some Men will haue an ayme Sixe Bowes beyond the Levell w?? they made; To win his Crowne, what Gamester can wee Blame, Will shift his Cards? Fortune the Packe brings in, And 'tis but Fortune, that wee loose or win. 12 But Richard sitts a step below his Chance, And puts his Game to others, who from him And by his fortune will their owne advance; Though when they first put out, they did not swim, Perhaps, to reach that Crowne; who euer yet That was Ambitious, made his proiects fitt? 13 But though some faire allurements might bring on A willing soule, &amp; please it, with its End; Yet let his serious Advisement run Through the designe, to make the Machine bend To probabilities; were there not more Of Fortune then his share in 't, hee'd giue ore. 14 But when Successes warrant euery Step, And somewhat falls beyond our expectation, Wee take the Thred cast out, &amp; by it Leape As an advantage, fitt for the occasion. When Harrie Ravenspurgh, or Cæsar, past The Rubicon, their thoughts were not soe vast. 15 Though bladder'd with Ambition, both were made Men not vnfitt for Empire; and the Wheele Once made to goe, is trouble to be stayed; It runs so smooth, for these Giggs may not reele; What Children cannot Manage, abler Boyes Make Vsefull to their sport; &amp; soe the Toyes. 16 But Harrie was too young to foster hopes Of Soveraignty, when Richard had the Crowne; Though Gant might haue an Ayme, &amp; vse the Props Of Leon &amp; Castile, to bring it on; For some haue Thought, who did soe well become A forraigne Title, might a Crowne at home. 17 This might at least adde something to the Aymes Of Bullingbrooke, who lou'd not to goe lesse; His Father was a King, &amp; whoe disdaines To live a subiect; noe vneuenesse Clips the Horizon to a Prince's Eye, But ev'n beyond that, somewhat doth descrye. 18 But I am yet a Sphere beyond my ayme; Richard is King, &amp; I to him must fall; To goe along with Time; Time, w?? doth frame All Actions perfect, &amp; dissolves them All; Nature's Surveyour, who sprung from the Poles, And lives with Light, the Astonishment of Fooles. 19 (Vnhappy flower, too early sprung to live; Soe peepes the Dazie, &amp; soe perisheth, Eyther by the next frost, or pluck't to giue A Raritie; soe meets, in either, Death; Wise Plants sleep in their Causes till the Sun, Giue warrant, &amp; the Ayre Approbation. 20 But 'twas noe fault nor folly of his owne: That hee was young, is Nature's fault, not His; 'Twas fitt to make that revolution, Fate had determin'd, who can neuer misse To her Designe; what wee contingents see, Are but the Spoakes i' th' Wheele of Destinie. 21 Stay till the wheele arrive that fatall point, And let my Quill draw out a Line, from whence Distempers rose, as from a Concourse ioynt Of Causes met, All in Malevolence, To scourge the Age; vnder a King, a Child, The Nobles factious, &amp; the Commons Wild. 22 Engirt with enemies of noe small Power, The French recovered, and the Scott, who yet Was true noe longer, then hee saw an houre How to be false, or an advantage fitt To forfeit Reputation; &amp; Advance For Crownes, the Interest of the Crowne of France. 23 And now at home, by evill Councell led, (Still the suggestion of worse Councellours) The King is tax'd, &amp; foule Aspersions spred To make him scorned; as though it appears Worthy alone a Parliament to prescribe, And the poore King falls before euerie Tribe. 24 Hee cannot suffer 't; Royaltie confin'd May be noe more then Light; as well you may Bind vp the Tresses of that Day which shin'd First in your Cell, &amp; make noe further Day; For Light is but made Glorious in her Winges, And only Power becomes the Breath of Kinges. 25 Though it is true Hee might be worthy blame, (If Royalty may fall vnder Impute) Hee did neglect the Office of his Name; Or did not keepe foe punctually to 't, As graver Heads would force. Who cannot find A staffe to beat a Dogge, that has a Mind? 26 And now the state vrges a danger nigh; At lest the Pilot, (as the state now stood) Pretends a Ruine; Some Conspiracie To face the Greater treason, makes it good; Wee sadly see it; and all Times haue sett Such Pillars out, for Kings t' avoid the Nett. 27 After some ouertures, to make good All What Gant suggested might of dangers be, The King gives Satisfaction, &amp; doth Call Another Parliament; Each Poll must free Itselfe by Price; perhaps there is a fate Impends some actions that wee looke not at. 28 The Commons nettled, to defray the Charge Of Nature in them, at their owne Expence, Gather in shoales of Mutinie, t' enlarge The Noise, &amp; euery one speakes his owne sense; Though none speake any, but all thinges pass faire, Where some are greiued, &amp; all incenséd are. 29 One Ball, a Preist, takes the occasion fitt To vent his owne, &amp; make their Rage rise higher; Such bauling Preists were neuer wanting yet, With Bellowes, to prouoke that desperate fire. Though Lay-brains haue the Hearth, w?? fuell drest, The Cheife Ardelio euer was a Preist. 30 From Holy writ, Hee boldly doth assert, All men are equall, all from Adam Sprung. Oh Sacred Spirit of Truth! when wee Invert Thy Misteries, what Prodigies are flung To make vs wretched! 'tis a Cabinet Not to be openéd by humane Witt. 31 But this was catching, &amp; the giddy Rout Applaud his Doctrine; it concern'd their Ease, And Iustified the Act they went about; The King was Tyrrannous, the Nobles Base, And euerie Peasant did deserue a Name Equall with theirs, thence Levellers first came. 32 If forme may be in a confusion, And any order where disorder raignes, Behold this Rabble; noe illusion Soe lifts the Passions &amp; provokes the veins, As a blind Interest; where wee are concern'd, Iustice forgotten is, and Truth not learn'd. 33 These, the King's men, (for what Rebellion Vnder a King but did pretend a Right To his advantage, till they gett theyre owne,) Led by a Rascall, made of shreds, to fight Against the King, the seame of Government, Perhaps they thought wanted his Instrument. 34 Thus they proceed, and as yo? may expect From such a Crue, they ransack, spoyle, &amp; wast, And in their March, they Ruine or Infect The Countrey through, &amp; cannot March soe fast But tumult and disorder still was prest, Two dayes before their c?minge, to Assist. 35 And now, on Cock-horse, Insolence is still Bred in a dunghill; to the King they send A Sawcy Summons; Hee appeares; vntill Asham'd soe base a Rabble to attend, Hee saw his error; for still Maiestie By a Complyance, adds to Mutinie. 36 At length to London: (for to vndergoe A taske of danger, &amp; noe Wreath propose, Had stopt the current,) London, only Thou Canst satisfy all Aimes. The Citty Crowes Assemble, &amp; Resolve they would keep out (When Hee was three miles off,) his ragged rout. 37 And had Hee come noe nearer, they had bin The Choisest Spiritts that the Land had bred; One a fring'd Halberd takes, another in A Iacke new-vamp'd is bold to shew his Head, And rant, (w??in the walls) the faire Discent, Not of himselfe, but his Habiliment. 38 What wondrous feates of Armes, the man that wore That shirt, at Crescy &amp; at Poitiers did! Frenchmen he slew, by Dozen or by score; And (as Inspiréd thence) He threatenéd To weare it worthy, &amp; a Tally make Of slaughter, to outvye his shop-board's Chalke. 39 For he a Chandler was, his Neighbour next, (New washt his hands) was of the Grocer trade, Had donn'd a Marrion, w?? his Cap betwixt. And brings along with him the Parish blade, Which had at Mile-End oft beene drawne &amp; tryed, When the Scotts King this Iland did invade. 40 Wonders, each new-trimm'd Citizen can tell, Was done by others, in the last King's dayes, And threaten greater; but the Rebells fell Close to their gates, &amp; put them in a Maze; Ere they had vtter'd halfe the feats they ment, They quit their Armes, &amp; to their shops they went. 41 The Gates were open'd, &amp; the Bridge let downe, The Rebells enter, &amp; the Apron Men Bid welcome, with their Pints; the high renowne Of Cittys' valours Clubb'd into his Den; Such Mastiffes at a Bay! but enter once, Hee claps his Tayle betweene his Leggs &amp; Fawnes. 42 And that the Captaine might insult enough, To shew by little that he would doe more, Hee takes the Measure of his Maister's stuffe, And snips it to a Size, he thought before, Convenient for his Fashion; this new Mode Hee carryes, through the Citty, as hee rode. 43 His Master's Head vpon a Pole he stucke, And as a Trophy of his Gratitude, Made it be borne along; the Terror strucke From Cheap to Charinge; now the Multitude Swum in the Kennell: &amp; the 'Prentice sweeps Himselfe in with the Dirt, to fill their Heaps. 44 This snow-ball lick't the Earth still as it went, And wrought it selfe into a mightie Size; Necessity mou'd some, as Discontent Made others vndertake the Enterprize. Once make a Head, &amp; each Man, as hee List, Is a Convenient Member to Assist. 45 Strange Insolencyes &amp; vnheard of things, (But with such Routs, nothing is strange or New,) They act; 'tis said Fury and Rage haue Winges; If soe, on strongest Pineons here she flew; But in Rebellion nothing seemeth strange; Of Noveltie, their Interest is Change. 46 And to make good what first they vndertooke, Law, (as the curbe to all such vndertakeinges,) Must be Abolish'd; Law, in force, had strooke This Python dead; Law hath too many Wakeings; And this Imposture cannot take the lowe Till Argus head be seuer'd by his Blow. 47 Had wee but seene, (but wee perhaps haue seene Outrages Equall to the worst they did,) Such Insolencies done by thinges call'd Men, Wee Iustly might haue thought they had forbid Their owne Creation, &amp; had forragéd Like Wolves, as in some places, Men are sed. 48 And I beleiue it really; some feirce Nature oppressed with dire Melancholly May thinke Rage proper to the Shape he weares; His Figure he forgets in his owne Follie; Soe some are Catts or Hares, &amp; the Illusion Springs Cheifly from Complexionall Infusion. 49 What divers Frencyes may posses a Rout Wee better may beleiue then well expresse; Some would haue Truth, but put her Candle out; But all moves by their Single Interests; Soe the Moone may be fitted w?? a Coate As make a Goverment, for All t' allow 't. 50 This swarme of Hornets sweeps the Citty round, And drive the Iustly-seated from their Hives; Who free? Alas! when Madnes giues a Wound, That it is less then Mortall who beleives? Therfore, not who will put, but who will Stand The danger of such a Knife in such a Hand? 51 The meaner sort Ioyne with the Mutineers, And ere they can consider what they mean't, Are wrapt in with the Ruine; 'tis to vs Noe wonder, what wee see made Evident: Soe in a Village, let one Curre begin The Barke, &amp; all the baser Doggs come in. 52 Full in their Rage, &amp; in their Numbers full, (Number, w?? adds vnto Plebeian Rage,) They many things perpend; &amp; some they Cull Insistive Articles; the sad presage Of Ruine to a Kingdome; never yet Did Hee stand safe, who gave up Iust for fitt. 53 A Royall Summons to the Royalltye These Rebells send; as if the Power were theirs Hee must attend; to what necessitie, Eu'n Kings are Subiect; Something still appears To baite Humanity; a full Content Noe State, nor noe Condition yet exempt. 54 The King (to meet them, at y? appointed Place,) Went from the Tower; Hee out, They enter'd in; And Acted all the Villainy that was Within their Reach; something has euer bin The Vltimum; &amp; there is yet one step Beyond a Possibilitie to Leap. 55 For though, in a blind Furie, they had tooke The Arch-Bishop from his Office, to their owne, And hal'd Him from the Altar to the Blocke; An Altar yet, in his devotion. Thus, what some faint beleevers cannot frame, The offerers the Offeréd became. 56 Yet they had not Attain'd the height of Ill: Noe Man nor yet a Crowd, to Mischeife bent, Att setting forth arriv'd the Top o' th' Hill; Wee move by Steps, and not Incontinent, Are com'd whither wee looke; perhaps a yeare Had ripened out the Ill they did not here. 57 For here the Glorie of her Sex, the Queene, Mother vnto the King; but farre more prais'd In being Edward's Wife, whose Eyes had seene And Iudg'd her only worthy to be rais'd, From Sarum's Widdow (w?? some weaker Head Might count disparagement) vnto his Bed. 58 Here was that Queene; &amp; though noe doubt shee had Disgrace enough to stand, in the Contempt And Power of such a Tumult; 'twas but bad; Worse might haue beene; who knowes! Astonishment Might strike the Villains to think she was once Great Edward's wife, the Scourge of Haughty France. 59 This might be it; or to the greater Ray Which made him tremble, they perhaps might fall: Edward was Captive to her Eyes, and They, Rebells enough, yet durst not offer all The Iniury they might; &amp; they who durst Doe soe much Ill, 'twas well did not the worst. 60 When they had run the Thred of all their Thought In Mischiefe here: they went to meet the King; Hee calmly askes why they such Numbers brought? Why Arm'd? His finger now struck euery stringe; And, like an Instrument, soe mov'd, they make One confus'd Noise; soe Multitudes still Speake. 61 Some freedome Aske, but know not what it is; Others, (and they the most, opprest w?? want,) Require Support to their Necessities; And some, (who were in law more Conversant,) Demand release of Tenors. Beagles will Not loose a sent, though they run Counter still. 62 The King to all their greiveances gave Eare, Or seem'd to doe soe; &amp; by Parliament Promises to redress what they might feare; But for the Time, it were convenient, His Pardon given, their Armes lay'd aside, They should disperse; and as Hee said, they Did. 63 Tiler &amp; some remaineing of the Crew (Who knew their greater guilt and durst not trust The Royall promise made) their Ragges vp drew To Smithfeild, twenty thousand yet to boast Their Rebell Armes; thus a deuided Snake, The Head but liueing, will like menace make. 64 Hee to the King (for now the King was come To know why yet in Armes they did appeare) Steps forth, &amp; wsupert;? an Arrogance w?? some Were hasty to Correct; but whether feare Or more mature Advises, dissapprou'd it, The King forbade it soone, to him that mou'd it. 65 With gracefull lookes and all the Ornament His yeares might bring, Hee calmly ask't the cause They came about; &amp; if their fellowes went Well satisfied, they should haue the same Lawes. Law (quoth the Traytor) shall be what wee list, And yet, ere Night, pass 'twixt my Lipps &amp; fist. 66 What Arrogance! beyond his foule Attempt! The King's owne Dagger, by his rude hand seiz'd, Was not enough; the Royall Sword he mean't T' haue had; &amp; might the Scepter, had he pleas'd. Once find the Temper, &amp; hee that hath the Skill, Makes matter carry any forme he will. 67 Wee must imagine him who vndertakes Actions of Danger fitt to manage them; Conduct is next Creation; something speakes In euery Action, somewhat of Esteeme; And wee but take the bound, as it may hitt Our single Interests of Wrong or Right. 68 Some of the Nobler present were amaz'd At Tyler's menace, for it was noe less; Full w? the King he ioynes, &amp; what hee pleas'd, Hee vrgéd home; what hee might say they Guess, Who haue acquainted beene with the Demands To Princes made in Catch of Rebel Hands. 69 But Richard, by the Courage of his Traine, Was rescued; the Action redounds To Walworth's single Honour, &amp; it can Not live without his Name, in Tiler's Wounds W?? were made many; soe a Panther tooke In a sure toyle, They strike, who durst not looke. 70 The Rout incenséd w?? their Captaine's fall, With many voices vtter out their Rage; And threaten Equal death; or if worse shall Come in their Way; when Passions engage, Wise Men haue wise expressions; but what rude Noyse w?? out sense comes from a multitude. 71 Soe when a Bull, Conducter of the Herd, (Assaulted by an Irish Greyhound) falls, The rest enragéd stampe, but, yet afeard, Bellow their Rage; each one his fellow calls, With rude enticements, to lead on the Rest: The Multitude is euer such a Beast. 72 While thus they stood amaz'd, &amp; had a will To doe enough, but knew not what to doe; Richard appeares, &amp; Cryes, Loe I am still Your King, your Captaine; let the Caitiffe goe, Whoe did mislead yo? hither, follow mee; You are my Subiects, I your King will bee. 73 This tooke; &amp; they as one Man followed him, Now in their power; What might not Rage haue done? But some things are not ripe when they may seeme; Hee was in danger, but Destruction Lackied to bring more guilt, &amp; make appeare That Act a Iustice, had beene Treason here. 74 And 'tis not Strange, if wee keepe Equall pace With Time, &amp; run the Thred of Actions out To observation; the same Act to pass Iustice, which had beene Sacriledge; for put Them in a Bagg, it is but Cross &amp; Pile; The Lucky Gamester gives the value still. 75 How byassed all humane Actions are! And 'tis but Interest they are wrong &amp; Right; Els but one Thing were praised, good or faire, And Iustice yet were clad in her owne white; But (ah) that Robe is torne, &amp; euer since, The party-Colour'd sitts vpon the Bench. 76 And now the mouth of fury, full of words, Dare vent her loud conceptions; all suggest Something to their owne Fancie; Rage affords Noe light beyond the Eye of Interest; And not the meanest Hee who bore a Pronge But from his Chimney brought his Cause along. 77 For not the lowest Ragge of Humane race, (If Humane Natures haue disparitye) But in a change will seeke to mend his place, In Ease, Esteeme, in Fortune, or Degree; The meanest Peasant, throw the Hedges downe, Of Knighthood, to his office, from his owne, 78 And this was Common Right w?? now they sought; The Trimmest fellowes of this Regiment Envie'd the Gentry; and the meaner thought Themselves fitt Yeomen; for 'tis Incident, Place Man on any Step of Life's Affaire, Hee as an ayme still to a higher staire. 79 The King was hemm'd w?? this vnsteddy rout, And would haue calm'd their fury; but to grant Is to deny, when euery one shall put His Sence for Reason; there must be a want When All ask?s all things; Popularitie Is still so monstrous in its Libertie. 80 Now Walworth came, (who feard the King too much Might trust the Villains) with a Noble band; First Tyler's head cut off, Hee made them pitch Vpon a pole; Such grininge Trophies stand Worthy his Loyalltie who gaue a claime Of Knighthood to his Office, from his Name. 81 Who knowes the many Terrors that Assaile A Loyall Soule, in absence of his Prince? Hurried away by Rebells, noe availe To their Reproaches, but his Innocence; Lost to himselfe; yet hauing more to seeke, Hee found the Royall Eagle by the Checke. 82 Soe fly a shoale of giddie Dawes along, And chatter out their Spleene, when Iove's great Bird Quits her Sun-Gazeing, to the Region Of their lanke winges. Maiestie should be Sphear'd Beyond the Common Eye; for Kings haue beene Thought Godds rather then Men, till they were seene. 83 For things devine or neare Diuinitie Have still a Curtaine; if they keepe their weight. Somewhat remaines; for if yo? satisfie Reason, that Reason runs from her owne height; And rather then not worke will some what finde On follye's Dung-hill, to perplex the minde. 84 Soe were the Misteries vnder the Law; And soe Religion where it shineth most, Keeps something from the Knowledge to the Awe Of People; who in knowinge it were lost. For Cock-braine once vpon a Pinacle Gott vp to see, but ere he saw, Hee fell. 85 Though true it be, the mind soe Coward is Whelméd in Ignorance, it will adore An Onion, with the same formalities, And tremble to its impotentiall Power. Such was Egiptian folly; and wee, once, Brittains, gave worship to Horse-heads &amp; stones. 86 Such folly dwells in Men, as or to haue Or be without is equally oppressinge; Religion awes some spiritts as a slave, Some breake the Pale, and Newer rites are dressinge, To cloath the Image w?? themselves haue rear'd; And of their owne Invention stand afear'd. 87 For still the Mind retains some sparke from whence It borrowed first, and would acknowledge it; But trusting to her faculties, &amp; Sense, The ill-made vmpire to vnruly Witt; Shee gives the Clue: &amp; if it can but ravel To the Thred's End, wee seeke noe farther travel. 88 Man cannot be without some Dietie, Either acknowledg'd or a selfe-rais'd Shrine; Not euen those who bellow forth Impietie 'Gainst All w?? may accounted be Devine; For if wee vnderstand Opinion, Who disclaime All, by makeing none, haue One. 89 Yet wiser Speculation can descry Divinity w?? none hath vnderstood. That Altar was not blaméd when on high They had Inscrib'd it, To the vnknowne God; But euen from thence, Th' Apostle tooke his rise And taught that God,—God in his Misteries. 90 Pardon if I haue err'd, for zeale may erre; My Barke another Voyage must intend; Richard is but my fraught; &amp; I must steere By the vncertaine Card, w?? did attend His fortunes; if I not safe harbour find, Then I am sure wee sayl'd both w?? one wind. 91 The glitt'ring Band w?? from the Citty came In rescue of the King, such Terror strucke In their approach, the Factions disclaime Their Armes &amp; Askings; like a long-bay'd Bucke, When the fresh Kennel, w?? full mouths, are neare, Breaks from his strength, &amp; flyes away for feare; 92 Soe these dull Peasants; Hee who but now stood Sceptred with his Browne-Bill, an equall Prince, And durst say anything himselfe thought good, Hee &amp; the King! &amp; Hee, the King's defence; Surpriz'd betwixt two Passions, Rage &amp; Feare, Threw downe his Armes, &amp; run, Hee knew not where. 93 Some run away, &amp; some are lower fixt, Trembling vpon their knees, w?? hands vprear'd; Some wiser would haue fallen off &amp; mixt With the new Commers, when the Cry was heard, Of ‘'Long live Richard’! euery Rebel Slave Could Eccho, 'gainst his heart, his Head to saue. 94 'Twas vrg'd to hunt the vermine from their holds, Their feare had light in; &amp; a Slaughter make, Not of the guilty, but the yeilding Soules; Though all were guiltie, yet in Guilt wee take Proportion, &amp; Death or Punishment Award, as may concerne the Instrument. 95 Some of the Chiefe now suffred; but the Rest, With faire dismission, went to their owne homes, Perhaps Advis'd; noe sooener was this Nest Disperst, but a new Packe broke from their Loomes, With Colour to Reforme; as though the state Might weare noe Cloath but Dyed in Litstar's fatt. 96 This Rascall, (who had now forgott his Trade, Or meant to make his Course-spun beare a Graine Fitt for a finer Thred,) beares vp his Head; King of the Commons, cryed vp by his Traine; Soe in Flocke Hangings, w?? an Azure Nose, Are Kings sett forth; Hee look'd like one of Those. 97 What Insolence durst not Act, these villaines did, Vnder the same pretence of Equall Right; Vn-heard of Murders, Tyrrannies vnread, Nobility enslau'd, &amp; all the Spight Soe loud a Crue of villaines, sett vpon Designes of mischeife could doe, now was done. 98 This fire in Norfolke, wafted as it flew, And swept the Countrey as a running flame; Till the Grave Bishop: Former Ages knew Some who became the Office, in that Name; And Newer Lights, old Rites may vilepend; But Wee must All be fixt or Independ. 99 Our owne Historians worthily applaud This Bishop Spencer, &amp; this Act became Him properly; a Preist fomented had The Insurrection &amp; rais'd the flame; Fitt for the Aspergillum of this Preist, Scatteringe these feinds, like a good Exorcist. 100 Soe stands the Common Iugler, &amp; can play His prize to Astonish euery weaker Eye; But let a better come, Hee run's away, And has noe Feate. Some inequalitie Falls to all sort of People, &amp; now (were it Not spoke too wild) the greater carry 't. 101 'Twas well, when Holy Orders not alone Put on the Preist; were His, but by that Power Order conferr'd to others; some haue gone About to deny both; &amp; 'tis noe more Then Wee see Acted; the next Age may see Grammar made out, &amp; Actives Passives bee. 102 Now had the Tide of Fortune cast this wracke Vpon the Shore; Richard as Lord o' th' Soyle Distributes; to some gives, from some takes backe, What themselues promis'd, in their ill-made toyle, Pardon &amp; freedome; who pretend to more Then Right, 'tis fitt Iustice knocke off the Score. 103 Soe was it here; these Petty toes of State, Who would haue Trod a Galliard of Designe, Ere they had learn'd their Measures to compleat, Fell in a Iigge. For Peasants, though they ioyne Endeavour to their Cunning, can advance At best, noe higher, then a Countrey Dance. 104 And now wee leave 'em in their Destinie: May still such Fate attend such vndertakeings. If small ones haue their Great, (as all things be Proportionate vnto their seuerall makeings,) The Great ones, of these small ones, hangéd are, The Rest were halter'd, Pardon'd; &amp; 'twas faire. 105 Goe home, dull swaines, &amp; let your Neighbours know How yo? haue sped; keepe in your Loyall fires: Warme sitts the Loyall Soul, though he sitt low; Danger attends the Pineon which aspires Beyond its proper Region; Wrens can flirt But try a further flight, they fall to Dirt. 106 All Bodies, Politick &amp; Naturall, Stand of mixt humors, &amp; they must haue vent; Clownes are the Phlegme of C?monwealths, &amp; fall Properly purgéd, by the Excrement; Sanguine may need Phlebotomy; but dull Hydropticke Bodies are best purg'd by Stoole. 107 Whether these Actions were promou'd &amp; wrought By better Heads, whose hands were yet vnseen, Some make a doubt. The Iaccal runs about To find his Master Prey; though neuer seene, Hee hunts the Lion, for the Lion's board: Men-Lions, but such Prodigies afford. 108 The King, who saw noe further then the Face Of things, did apprehend noe danger more; Swallowed in Ryott, doth his minions grace With Titles, not in England knowne before; And 'tis an observation, that some fate Of great disaster still attends such state. 109 Poole, from a Merchant, now made Suffolke's Earle, And Chancellor, but that perhaps not new; The Noble Vere springs at a double whirle, Marquesse &amp; Duke; at this his vnckles grew Impatient; but Gant let Glocester's pott Boyle only over, though His were as Hott. 110 Glocester resents it highly; whilst, aloofe, Gant egg's his Discontent, &amp; seems concern'd Equally in the preiudice; but of A more concealed Temper, Hee had learn'd To vaile his greife vnder an even Brow, And carry'd it that the King did not know. 111 Glocester, (whose fire, put in the weaker Shell, Must haue a vent, or breake the vessell quite,) Talkes big: &amp; high disparagements doth tell Were done to him, in the King's oversight; For never yet a King soe even stood, Could satisfy all Humors of the Blood. 112 Whilst Merchants &amp; Court-Sycophants could gaine Their owne Ambitions, Royall donatives; His Equall Blood, drawne from Great Edward's veine, May freeze, neglected in all Relatives; The King forgetts himselfe in his Allyes, And wee sitt scorn'd whilst meaner persons rise. 113 These and such Passions oft from Glocester broke: A Noble Nature scarce soe well contains As may find warrant in the statist's booke; The Duke, perhaps, was Loyall, &amp; disdains To weare another Face; though some were knowne Seem'd less aggreiv'd &amp; made it more their owne. 114 All are not open in their discontents, But subtle Natures fall to cast about, And can run close vpon the hottest sent, To seize the Careless Heart, before he know 't; They knew Hee Bay'd to their Destruction, They durst not Barke, but yet they meant him one. 115 For now the Duke of Ireland &amp; la Poole, With others of the Packe, perceiuéd how Glocester disturb'd himselfe, to ouer-rule Their Interests &amp; Ends; which least it grow Too popular, their Instruments must cross, With any hazard, to such certaine loss. 116 The Plott was,—Glocester, bid to Supper, must Be murderd at a Feast; himselfe seru'd in The better Dish, a Haut goust to the Tast Of such strange Pallatts; but the bad designe Discouer'd was, by some who were more wary, And thought the Price aboue the Ordinary. 117 The Mayor suggests the danger; whether 't were But a suggestion many make a doubt. Soe, in less Light, the bigger formes appear; Sometimes he gives the Spectacles who brought The Letter; &amp; noe Character soe small, But through that Glass appeares a Capitall. 118 Brambre, his fellow Citizen, (who was Of the Court-faction &amp; had formerly Got the reward of Loyaltie) might raise Some Dust to Exton of this Iealousie; For where wee cannot keep an Equall pace To get the End, assoone wee seeke by-wayes. 119 This aggravates the ill opinion The world had taken of la Poole &amp; Vere. How easie thing it is to ouer-run The Fame of Minions! he cannot Erre, (It has beene held a Maxime, euer since,) Doth taxe the Men most fauor'd by the Prince. 120 To make this Act more horrid, &amp; the King, Perhaps, more hated, not his Ministers Were only slanderd; Hee proiects the Thing, At least Consents vnto this Act of Theirs; 'Twas Rumor'd soe; for where Privadoes act, The King is taken Cheife in the compact. 121 Dureing these Contestations, Lancaster, More fam'd by Name of Gant, was gone to claime An Interest to his double Titles; where His Actions done relate not to our frame Of Story. Wee but Accidents display, As may be vsefull to vs, in our way. 122 Perhaps 'twas not amiss, &amp; though the King Were thought noe Prudent Manager of state, There might be Policie in this; Gant's wing Wanted not many feathers, in his fate, To perch His Cædar; Richard imps him out, Till from his Ayerie, one full summ'd shall doe't. 123 'Twas somewhat of Prevention, &amp; delay Pleases weake spiritts; but Another Crowne Which Richard gave him, to the loud Assay Of Leon &amp; Castile, nought els had done. To greate Expectances, faire baits propose; Soe Atalanta did in R?ning lose. 124 But now a storme appears; the French led on By hopes in our Distractions, to repaire The many Losses they had vndergone By English Armes; for England fitted are As though the Glorious flowers w?? best attone Within a Chaplett, could not in a Crowne. 125 Young Charles of France; (full of the blood of France) Whose Well stor'd Treasurie gave Warrantie To All Designes; Great forces did advance, And Great things meant; the Rendezvous must be At Sluce; twelue hundred vessells fitted were, These prepossesséd Conquerors to beare. 126 Richard, (who (in his nearest) had noe blood Of France, infected with the Native Ayre) Rants in another Levie; &amp; now stood (The sea betwixt) these Armies Equall faire; But these for Scotland were; where the French had Another Power, which some excursions made. 127 The French &amp; Scotts, (who ever were but one 'Gainst England,) are repulst; some entry made Vpon the country; &amp; their Fairest Towne With other places fir'd; This, when I read, I blame not if a Cole throwne thence of late, Burne England vp: They but Retaliate. 128 Iohn de Vienna, Admirall of France, Was to this Action a cheif instigator; But acted little, for the Puissance And number of the English (the Relator) Hee durst not cope; to say the French not dare Is an affront; he did not theirs Repaire. 129 The greater Power (intended to invade England) lay yet at Sluce, All fitt &amp; Prest; Charles, in his Thoughts, had Conquered, but stay'd By Berry's absence, who of All the Rest Was still averse vnto this vndertakeing: Some like noe motions but of their owne makeing. 130 Berry was vnckle to the King; a Man Of good advice, &amp; thought it was noe more Then Rashnes in his Nephew; Hee, againe, (For younger Heads their owne conceipts adore) Thought it an Act t' Equilibriate his Fame To all the Glories of his Crowne &amp; Name. 131 Here see the Change which one succession Had wrought in both these Kingdomes; Charles the last, Father vnto this Charles, was look'd vpon A Prince soe prudent, that the world was cast In to his Title; &amp; hee doth not rise Soe Glorious, King of France, as of the Wise. 132 What this King was, let their Historians say; Ours tell of ours; but what his Father was, France is a speaking witnes to this Day. But 'tis noe Observation, from this place, To find Disparitie, 'twixt son &amp; sire: If wee looke better, wee may see it nigher. 133 This Cloud of France, now blowne another way; And Richard quiet, though not well content, Resolves to haue the Duke of Ireland stay Against the late Decree of Parliament; These haue beene ever curbe-Kings, &amp; may be At last, Confusion vnto Monarchie. 134 Yet couertly Hee seemes to goe along Part of the way, &amp; not to other End; Wheeles about, &amp; seated in a Throng Of Lawyers, 'twas Resolu'd he might defend By Law, his Actions; for though Law were much, 'Twas but the King's Assent that made it such. 135 Such Mercenary Mouthes, in euery Age, Gape for preferment; and to Either End, As their owne Interest makes them engage, They will Assert; the Hassle soe will bend (A Rhadomoncie, was observ'd of old) Stretch'd on the Earth, vnto a Mine of Gold. 136 What had beene done by the Imperious Lords Was Treason, they declare; but they can say Anything to the price they sett their words; For not the Barre, but Bench, may be in pay, That not alone false Pleadings may proceed: Yo? cannot Plead what shall not be Decreed. 137 Though here I tax 'em not; had they stood vp Against the giddy faction, ere the King (Vnkingly Act) did to his vassalls yeild In a consent; but then (forsooth) they bring Demurrs &amp; whispers, &amp; the Law's noe more Then they are Warranted by any Power. 138 If it were Lawfull to recall what past In the Late Parliament, &amp; what was done There were illegall; why but now, at last, Is it declar'd? Ill fitts the Quiofe that Gowne, Who dare not clearly give the Lawe's intent; To claw a King, or please a Parliament. 139 But 'twas determin'd here, the seuerall Acts Late past Illegall were; and Articles Drawne vp of Treason; for 'tis Power Enacts, While Iustice sleeps; Antiquity did please To draw her hood-wink't; wee haue torne the vaile And she but winkes, or sees to her availe. 140 Glocester, who heard of this, &amp; well had thought, Ere this the Kingdome had beene in his Power; For Vere &amp; Poole remou'd, Hee valew'd nought To guide the King. 'Tis euer somewhat more Then Honestie wee steere by; Not the North Alone directs the Needle, but the Earth. 141 Hee to his complices the danger told: Arundel, Warwicke, Derby, Nottingham; Men form'd for Honors, if they had not sold Theyr Loyalties, vnder another Name. How many waies lead on Rebellion! Cowardice, Courage, Law, Opinion. 142 Nobility was then a name w?? bore Weight to its valew; All was currant Gold, Though not one Coyne. The soveraigne was more By many Graines. The Mettle doth not hold Now, nor the Mintage; for the Lords are Shipt, Patted with shears, &amp; into Farthings clipt. 143 Had then, for Name sake, Nottingham, (the least And lowest of the five,) had other Aimes Then of Advancement, honour w?? possest Them to live worthy: of their Blood &amp; Names Some what were said; &amp; some what's vnderstood, When Attempts Gallant are, although not good. 144 But sneaking smells of Peasant, though they weare Blue Ribbands or a star-adornéd Cloake, Ensignes of Honour; if they quit their Sphere How are they Noble? Let these Nick-nam'd looke How farre they tread from Honour, &amp; disgrace The printed footsteps of their Father's Race. 145 If Nature doe not, Reason bids there bee (Nature's first principle) a difference; All Base or Treeble make noe Harmonie; But the true Diapazon strikes the sence; Soe in the Instrument of State; for All Conditions are made thus vnivocall. 146 Whilst the King (to Assert what Hee had done) Was raiseing force, the Lords not idle were, But raise their Clients, who still run vpon Change in the State; for somewhat must appear In euery Government worth Alteration, Where Men are Discontented in their Station. 147 But Overtures were made; the Lords, vpon Promise of safetie, will Discusse their Cause In open Court; 'twas the Protection Of the King's Person &amp; the Kingdome's Lawes, To pluck vp Weeds and Canckers might devour These glorious Fruits, by an Abuséd Power. 148 The van, thus boldly marching, brought the Rere Safe into distance; ther's a discipline To order Words, as Men; &amp; they were here Couch'd to Advantage; there lay the Designe; For Kings &amp; Lawes write faire in all these Pothers, But they'de haue beene what they Condemn'd in others. 149 They Name the Traitors, as themselues were pleas'd To call 'em, though perhaps themselues were more; And gage to proue it, but the stirr's appeas'd; A promis'd Parliamant can plaster ore This Gash; &amp; then the Colledge met to vse Medicine for the sicke-state, as they would Chuse. 150 And, like a King, Hee now reproov's the fault And folly of their Actings; told them Hee Could right himselfe by Armes, but rather sought To make them Loyall by Impunitye; But like ill-weedes, if any Root remaine, At the next shewer, Treason will spring againe. 151 The Time grew nere of promiséd redresse, A Parliament; the Lords assembled were; The King holds off, but by a bold Expresse They summon him Imediately to appeare, Or at his perill; as though Perill lay Against that Power who gave them Power that Day. 152 They threaten Him (and 'twas but as they mean't And after soe succeeded) they would chuse Another, fitter for the Government; The Power of makeing Kings was in that House. Thus Mariana here &amp; Calvin iumpe; A Monstrous Bull, w?? hornes vpon his rumpe. 153 The King attends their Summons; (that I say The King attends, though it improper sound, Was but the sence it carried that Day: When Scepters totter once, they fall to ground,) And now what Malice, Insolence, &amp; Pride Dare aske, they Doe, &amp; must not be Deny'de. 154 For 'twas not passinge Bills of Generall good, Nor lookinge on Publick C?moditie, But euerie one his owne End vnderstood To be the busines; and All agree Each to bring in a Character, might fitt The purpose of their new-made Alphabet. 155 All neare the King, in fauour or in Place, Remouéd are, &amp; to their votes must fall; Some banishment, some Death, &amp; some Disgrace, Fall vnder; euery one his seuerall Mulct, as it touch't their Interests or Spleene, And stood before their Ends, or fell betweene. 156 And that they might Assume but what they tooke, Sole Power of Iudgment; by a bold Arrest, The Iudges from their Benches downe they plucke, And sent them to the Tower. It may be guest What followes; They're secur'd; Securitie, Parliament-sence, we know what it may be. 157 The King (incenséd with these high Affronts) Thinkes to repaire himselfe, when it may fall; And take a fitter Day to pass Accounts, By a faire Audit; for the King did Call, And then Dissolve these meetings, &amp; Hee mean't To quit all scores, after the Parliament. 158 And now Hee slips the yoke, to take vpon Himselfe the Libertie his Birthright gave, And now his Age might warrant; the Cheife stone Hee from its Corner, in this Pile did heave; And lay'd Another, fitter for the Place; At least to please him, who Surveiour was. 159 From Arundel of Yorke, Hee takes the Seale, And leaves the Councel-board; but soone return'd, And gives it Winchester; an Act which well Became a King; for Power the Throne adorn'd, And 'tis but fitt the Chancellour should be The King's sole Creature; for in Writts, Hee's Hee. 160 Gloucester &amp; Warwicke from the Councell-board He quitts, &amp; makes his Officers his owne; They had their Time of Rule, &amp; now the Cord Brings vp the Buckett, which before was downe. For in a Kingdome tottering 'twixt two powers, Things must be done to stand but Dayes or Houres. 161 By this time, Iohn of Gant, (whose Action lay Remote to what was done vpon this Stage,) Returnes; &amp; mediates to the King some way Of iuncture in the State; &amp; did, by Sage Advices, qualifie the Sparkes, which rise From either's Fire, to other's preiudice. 162 What yet his Aymes might be, to ripen out His owne designes, though 't inapparent be, The Sequell, in his Son's Attempt, doth put Matter enough of Probabilitie. Thus cheaper, (for Hee kept Minion) Hee made the purchase in Reversion. 163 Good Husbands practise it in smaller things; But Hee, who knew the valew of his blood, Chaffers to his Ambition; Something Springs From euery Act, to make it vnderstood. Hee drove the bargaine on, in his Advice: Vnder that fairest flower the serpent Lyes. 164 What Hee might varnish needs noe colouring, From his next Brother, Yorke, who squaréd All His carriage vnto Honour; in this thing Hee need not sooth the King, nor closely fall In with the Iunto; but did fairely quit Himselfe to both, with Honestie &amp; Witt. 165 Hee thought the King did Erre; 'tis possible That Kings may Erre. Hee told the King his thoughts, Yet without inclination; to Rebell, Hee thought the highest Crime; &amp; those who sought To right themselues by Armes, for any Cause, Were Traitors t' what they vrg'd—the King &amp; Lawes. 166 Thus euenly-lookeing to neither side, Hee swam vpon the streame of this affaire, Safe to the Winds, &amp; warie to the Tide; To gaine the Port of Honour. Hee who dare Bee honest is with all Great Parts endow'd; For in these Mortalls, One doth All include. 167 Here let vs looke vpon the Progenie Of mightie Edward, in his seuerall sons; These Three remaineing to our Historie, How different their Inclinations; That were not Nature a varietie, 'Twere strange, from One now to behold these Three. 168 Gant, if Hee were, (as wee not question it) That son of Edward; for I will not thinke A Baker's Child soe glorious; but in Witt, As Maro told Augustus, Kites will winke, And cannot looke the Sun fixt in the face; Hee, by his Acts, shewed what his Ayerie was. 169 Then be he Edward's Son; for soe wee take Him, A Man whose Action makes Him worth the Blood; Bold &amp; Ambitious, if wee not mistake Him; Yet Acting Close, where open danger stood; Warie to Speake his thoughts, but yet thought much; And Creepled, when hee needed not a Croutch. 170 Edmund of Yorke, as if now Nature mean't Alloy vnto her Mintage, in this last, Though Valiant, Calme, of a Iust Temperament; Whose equall mixture neither trod the Hast With Gloucester, nor would pace y? Round w? Gant; But went his owne, &amp; neuer knew Constraint. 171 Gloucester, the youngest, (of a Turbulent Vnquiet soule, more then Ambitious,) Would haue done something, but his actions went Still the wrong way; soe euer factious As doubtless (had he liv'd to it) he durst Haue vext his Later Nephew, as his first. 172 'Twas not his drift, Derbie's Ambition, Nor what it was, I thinke wee hardly know; But some haue stirring Soules, &amp; must run on, Noe matter whither, if they doe but goe; Would haue things otherwise, &amp; then, noe matter, If they but Change, whether 't be worse or better. 173 Thus, in a troubled state, the vessell's tost By seuerall Humors; though the surest prize Fall to the hidden fire, some flames are lost And only glow vpon an Enterprize; But when the Fuell's fitted, what did lurke In wary Embers, spreads to doe the worke. 174 Richard, (though not well seene in Politicks,) Instructed by his Interest, (sometime Occasion dictates) privately dislikes His vncle's presence; Gant was too Sublime: Perhaps infected with the ayre of Spaine, And with the Titles subiect to remaine. 175 Therfore Hee is content, &amp; well Hee might, To free himselfe from Trouble of them both, To make him Duke of Aquitane; the right Was English then; &amp; furnish't him, as loth To faile in small Punctilios, or the more Concerning Requisites, to get him ore. 176 Soe glad wee are to free ourselues from doubt That may oppress vs. From those Passions Princes are not exempt; this province brought Nothing of profit; ioynt Relations Inclines vs Cheifly; all of vs is Double, And single Titles find it in the trouble. 177 Yet this was fitt for Gant; Hee who had beene With former Titles swolne, vnwillingly Would loose that Bladder; something came betweene To give abatement; but that Easily Was to be made out; being seated once, This Duke in England, might play Rex in France. 178 And let him act it there; Richard a while Sleeps on the feathers which himselfe had drest, And slips away his time; hee swumme in Oyle; What bears noe other bodie, bears him best; For Paradoxes fitt; as none can be Greater then Sloth Supporting Soveraigntie. 179 The King, who many troubles yet had taught Noe further Policie, then to remove A present fear, for noe prevention sought, To what might happen; 'twas enough he drove The Bryar by, w?? his hand; for ought of Ease Though not of safetie doth weake spirits please. 180 Some spirits can (surrounded with the Thornes Of fortune) make a way, or mount her hedge, T' enioy the Champaigne; whilst another mournes In an enclosure, though a stile or bridge Offer a passage; difficulties small Affright the weake, Great Soules make none at all. 181 Let the Pale hand of feare for euer seize The Leaden soules of Kings; if Princes fall, They fall to ruine. Hee that seeks his Ease, Looses his honour; 'tis a crowne worth all The other Titles Princes can Inherit, A Sober, Prudent, yet an Active Spirit. 182 But Titles only in succession fall, And Scepters may hereditary be; Their Vertue is their owne, not of Entaile; That Question of the Soule, Ex traduce, Granted, the Thesis neuer yet did rise To make it out, in Equall faculties. 183 For had his mighty Sire, with vitall blood, Bequeath'd the Edge of his all-peirceing Spirit, What Glories had wee seene! my verse had trod The Galaxie of fame, to Crowne his merit; But Iuno's milk must wash his Father's feet, Hee treads the Common Puddles of the street. 184 Thus, in the Lime-twigs of a troubled state, This Eagle flutters; &amp; the Royall wing Disabled, in this Dirt a way doth beat; Soe caught, fowle vse all foure; his wants doe wring Him not the least; Hee can but keepe the pace Of Badgers now, who once a Lyon was. 185 Hee has one shorter side, &amp; though a Prince Haue waies to furnish his necessities, And make Prœrogative defray expence Vnto his pompe or Prodigalities; Revenue run's faire, &amp; continues still The other Cart-Ritt holds but for a while. 186 Prest with his wants, he moves the Citty in A petty loane; but they deny the summe; A stranger offers it; the Cittye's Sin Is not Ingratitude; if one Name from Another may distinguish vice, in shapes, This was but as a graine vnto her heapes. 187 Somewhat of tumult past; &amp; the King's freind Suffer'd, because he was soe; all the Tribes Muster their Malice; 'twas a Sin to lend The King; &amp; if wee marke, this Act prescribes Their Loyalltie to this day, who despise The End &amp; meanes by which they stand &amp; rise. 188 This strange affront, (for 'twas not taken as A priuate Iniury vnto the Man) Strikes at the King; &amp; did he let it pass, The next blow hitts him sure; where it is plaine By any Act, what the intent may be, In Iustice, men condemned are, or free. 189 What they now mean't was plaine; &amp; that they might But fittly suffer, as the Common Crime, Hee tooke away from them their Common Right; The many priviledges, which from Time Charter'd, had beene the benefitt &amp; boast Of this besotted Citty, now were lost. 190 The Maior attach'd, &amp; the whole Government Dissolu'd, to fall vnder another forme; New Coustomes rais'd, by an Establishment Enforc'd vpon them, by a stronger Arme. Thus Kings are euer-valew'd by their Power, And they may take what they but gave before. 191 The King appeas'd; &amp; some formalities Pass from the Citty; if wee looke vpon This King as pourtrayed in our Histories, Wee find him of a Composition Not Rigid, apt to heare, but easily Supplanted, acting nothing certainly. 192 Though it were true, as, by the sad event, Wee Iudge noe less; yet wee may not conclude Safely, from all the Circumstance w?? went, 'Twas his meere weaknes made the Interlude. For though our Glories may our own appeare, Yet in our follies wee giue Fortune Share. 193 And let it here beare part, if Charitie In Calmer Iudgments oft soe construe it, To priuate faileings; let noe Maiestie Bleed out in Error, from the benefitt Of faire Construction; though our Actions frame The Series, wee borrow but the Name. 194 For Fortune is but taken to prevent Or to abate our Errours; &amp; wee wheele Cowards to Reason, when the Management Of Actions wee to our selves conceale; Soe wee vn-nack the Ballance, where the Spring Beats truly, to enforce another Thing. 195 Let mee not be mistooke; Humanitie, The Noblest peice in Nature wee must grant, And gladly, 'tis our selves; &amp; who can be An Alien there? but rather Arrogant Beyond the Title was at first intended; For in progression, all claimes are extended. 196 'Twas in the dullest times, when many Gods Were not enough but each his fancy brought A Dietie; when fortune, from the Clouds, Was hal'd, after the rest; for it was taught And soe receiued a Maxime, who could Steere, Himselfe by Prudence, need nor hope nor feare. 197 But the vnwary steps of some rash Man Trod in blind paths; &amp; by selfe-negligence Fell ruin'd; Fooles, who saw it, brought in then Fortune, to excuse the Error; euer since, Fooles followed her; because they found her first, And 'tis but only Fooles are Fortune-Curst. 198 The Ragge of Heathen Roome wee yet retaine, And 'tis to serve our Turnes, a faire excuse; Our Acts are not our owne; but by a Chaine Of causes, fore-decreed, doe vsher vs; Vertue and fortune carry but one Name, To make Her All: ev'n Folly doth the same. 199 Weake Princes still haue beene vnfortunate; A wise one cannot, for Hee makes his owne, And sitts beyond the Scourge they tremble at; As were within the circle of his Crowne, Her fetter'd wheele; &amp; soe it is indeed, When wee behold it set on such a Head. 200 And that wee may put All vpon her score, From Nature's Tally; Loe, the beautious Queene Now dyes; &amp; Rage-full Richard, (to be more Behind w?? the Blind Goddes,) raseth Sheene, The Mannor where she Died; &amp; that faire court Fell to her Funeralls, a heape of Dirt. 201 Soe Time and Place to our Corruptions Are Accessaries made; wee bring the Cause And matter of our owne Destructions, And will not know it; intervenients pass For Actors here; and wee are pleaséd most When to the Truth of Reason wee are lost. 202 Passion is euer wayward, &amp; can steere By noe one Line, but run's vnto the Rage Of Humors, inly heated; Richard here Runs backward to the coustome of all Age, Who structurs rais'd; his was a Passion To the same End, though in another fashion. 203 That Artimesian Obeliske, which fame Sings ev'n to wonder, was but the same thing, Passion in Eyther; though some haue the same Motives to Act, they cannot fitly bring Their Great Intentions out; the teeming Earth Soe labour'd once, to give a poore Mouse Birth. 204 Rage promted Him. From Contraries oft rise The same Effects. Fame is not Honor's Child; Erostratus yet Lives; for Prodigies Stand longest; &amp; wee know not who did build That Temple; Pietie securely sitts From Fame; &amp; 'tis but wonder fires our witts. 205 And that I may not loose a word I Speake, I am enflam'd; &amp; Hawkwood's noble Name Doth, like the starre in Cassiopea, breake To my amazement; &amp; shall stand with Fame The brightest Fire in all her Constellation; While Honour moves a wing vpon this Nation. 206 'Tis noe diversion, while I celebrate Vertue in any Name; for euery Name Lives in that Light, &amp; if the Thusian State Acknowledge it, in statues, who can blame Our single Zeale (who cannot Statues reare But only words) to pay the stanzas here. 207 For Acts, committed vnto Memorie, Live to en-Noble Names beyond their Fate; Statues speake something, but 'tis Historie Informes the vnderstanding, who, or what, The Marble means; statue's a knotty peice Of sence, whose Comment makes it what it is. 208 The King (to quell the Irish who had beene Stirring beyond their Limits in his Pale,) Goes over; 'tis an exigent, and seene By the events, vnprosperous to all Princes; &amp; must to this Dilemma fall,— But to recouer that, Hee hazards All. 209 For in a busie Age, where euery breath Calentur's into faction, and pretence Wants nought of Iustice to the C?mon faith, Danger attends all Motion in the Prince; Soe when the Lyon left the Forrest, Bears Got Soveraigntye; what was His, now is Theirs. 210 The Parliament, in absence of the King, (Yorke then was left Leuitennant in his stead,) Contest high with the Clergie; that's the Thing Stands but a Rubbe, betwixt the Royall Head; Lollards in euery Age (for only Name Distinguisheth,) in Action are the same. 211 Some of the Prelates personally Addresse Their fears vnto the King; Hee, more concern'd, Returnes t' allay the flame; which did encrease And spread w?? in his Court; if wisely warn'd By others' mischeifes, men are taught; what fooles Were they who stand examples in these Rules. 212 Our late Historians, (to extenuate The greater Breach made since,) would seeme t' excuse Their Actings; 'twas but zeale, to regulate The bladder'd Clergie; 'tis the same to vs; Once loose the figure which yo? meant, at first 'T may be an Ape, or Owle, &amp; Best, the Worst. 213 The Duke of Aquitaine, (for soe he stood By the King's grant,) the King, their Countryman, The Gascoignes did obey; 'tis vnderstood, Instinctive, All men would haue Natives raigne; And these bred-Mountaineirs could ill afford Their vintage brought in by a Belgick Sword. 214 What his endeauor was wee need not doubt: Hee cast about all waies to bring 'em in, And, might, in Time, haue gotten what he sought, Had not the King, vpon a fresh Designe, Now call'd Him home; as though inward he could Not Match Himselfe but as his vnckle would. 215 Lancaster now return'd, (for he had left His forraigne Title, &amp; became his owne,) Marries his Widdow-Mistress; 'tis a shift Which some allow a Reparation; Soe to abate one Proverbe, though its sence Carry a force beyond the first pretence. 216 The Lady Swinford, (who noe stranger was Vnto his Bed or Board, for shee had borne Him many Children,) comes into the place With honour now, where she had crept with scorne; Such Blanket-Love: for only Marriage yet Carries the cleanly lover of a sheet. 217 And to repaire Himselfe in his owne blood, And his owne blood, w?? suff'red by his fault; By the next Parliament, that Issue stood Vntainted, &amp; were made Legitimate; Knowne by the name of Beaufort; 'twas indeed Worthy his Care soe to Improve his Seed. 218 Wee will not reconcile our Annallists, Who differ in their Number, Three or Fower; Noe matter; the Historian insists, Perhaps where one's as vsefull as a score; And where in Circumstances they devide The storie; Hee that wanders chuse his guide. 219 And now the King Spreads a full Sayle: the wind Sate faire to make a voyage of good Speed; But his owne Top-saile left the fleet behind, And cross'd the Channell through, ere they had weigh'd Anchor, or made a-Board; soe strong doth move Fancie, provok'd by Glory, or by Love. 220 Hee, full in both; for it was like Himselfe To meet, on equall terms, his Brother King; These enterveiwes are Glories, &amp; haue els Little conduceing to the aym'd-at Thing. Such Royall Pageants, if the world appear One varied act, the Noblest Scene lyes here. 221 But here's the Riddle; vnless Maiestie May in its owne Ænigma carry more To call that Love, where such Disparitie Came in; A Child; Hee issueless before, And hopeless now (vnless he kept the thred Of fate himselfe) for any to succeed. 222 But wee must call it Love, what euer carries The face of such a Ioyning; what may move From other Wheeles, perhaps from contraryes, Make but one Armillarie Sphære in Love. Then be it soe; The little Boy was bold, To strike a King, from Eyes, not eight years old. 223 But Princes are vnhappie, &amp; their loves Not euer Noble, that is, to their Choice; Yet Richard seem'd to Love; soe Passion moves That nought of Inequalitie can rise; And 'twas but Prudence, if he did comply In his desires, vnto the Policie. 224 This Match was Politicke, at lest, soe farre As to the present purpose; Princes move Beyond their Passions; it is Peace, or Warre; The Nation is involued. Single Love Needs but a single Eye, to Iudge &amp; Chuse; But State-Conveniency must Glasses vse. 225 This double Marriage; for the Contract past Double, &amp; the two Nations were Affyed By the same Act; but leagues are neuer fast Longer then there is cause they should be tyed; Like a sad Couple, by their Parents forc'd, They'le catch Occasions to be Divorc'd. 226 Shee's gone to Schoole; her Cross-row &amp; Crow feet Hinder the Huswiferye of her Clay-pies; Foure letters and five stiches may compleat A Weekes-worke, &amp; soe done. A Princess plyes, Now to her Babies, and a little while Teaches, to weare her hand, to frowne &amp; smile. 227 This Little Lady, who could only yet Hold vp the heele &amp; symper; Pretty Thing! Wife in Expectancy. Soe Mahomet Might frame his Paradice to fitt this King. For other Men these Itches soone abate; But many years would not Allay his heate. 228 Thus Richard's Royall consort (for wee can Not call her less, being a Prince, his Spouse,) Begins to colour on a side; to span Employments nearer Woeman. For her Browes Contract a Royall anger, and disperse (They might doe more) Ioy to the vniverse. 229 Enough of Her; let Richard fancy out The Rest, till shee be fitt to meet his fire; 'Tis a strange pleasure, some haue gone about, Still to protract what they would most desire. Such Hereticks there be, who will contend The Obiect satisfies more then the End. 230 Richard is more then happie; with the Sun Now in his Apogæum he doth ride, And in the Pole of his owne Horizon Survayes Himselfe, &amp; 'bove himselfe his Bride. Naturall motions haue noe standing there; Hee whirls an Epicycle, who mou'd a Sphære. 231 Rash Phaeton fires the world. The Tropicks fixt Of Maiestie, Mercie &amp; Iustice are. All Sphæres haue proper motions; but the mixt Motion of All doth perfect euery sphære, And that th' Hypothesis; its forme may carry Noe zone; nor Colure is vnnecessary. 232 Kings, like the Sun, move, Lights vnto the Rest. The Earth is fixt; that is, the People are Dull clods, &amp; only by his Rayes refresh't; Whose motion glads it round. But (ah) I feare Wee Erre; &amp; as some later Artists will, 'Tis the Earth moves, &amp; the Sun (Kings) stand still. 233 These propositions, which are Equallie Made out by Demonstration, eyther way Vnto our Purpose, here may satisfye. Weake Kings are standing suns, &amp; haue noe Raye, But as the moueing Earth, the Commons, get Vigour from the first Centre of his heate. 234 But now the Machine moves on euery wheele, And Petty-Sphærs contribute to the whole. Richard is now in Orbe; or, if yo? will, In his Meridian Glorie. Hee must roule Hence on a broken Axis, &amp; bring on Vnnatural night; but at now-instant Noone. 235 Glocester (who still like Mercury, would be Skipping in the Sun's Orbe) Doth blame that Light, From whence he borrowed Fire. Glosester is Hee Mark't out, a falling starre. Thus vnto Sight Wee speake of Things; though Planets doe not slide, That here they fall, it cannot be denyed. 236 The Zodiacke of Honour whirles vpon Th' Imaginarie Poles of Right &amp; Power; Whose slippery Pinns haue a wild Motion. Soe did the two, in Nature move, before Atlas came in; for Prudence guides each Sphære; Supports the highest Orbe, &amp; moves this here. 237 Glocester vrg'd many things of preiudice, (With sharpe reproofes, he blam'd the peace with France, Soe had hee done, had they kept Enimies,) That Distance some are priviledg'd, &amp; Dance To their owne Passions. Soe the Satyre leapt To his owne Pipe; when Phœbus play'd hee slept. 238 Richard had Brest, from Brittain's Duke in Pawne For certaine summes, w?? the Duke now repay'd; The King performes, vnto the Caution Provided; Glocester stormes; &amp; wildly said The King was free to give a Towne! 'twas more Then all his Conquests had beene thertofore; 239 Taxing in this, his Courage; &amp; 'tis true The fire of the last Age was burn't quite out; Glocester, a Cinder, would old Heats renew; 'Twas but his owne; for Ashes flew about The vndrest Hearth, &amp; the ill house-wife'd roome Lay all on heaps, expecting none to come. 240 Though, the returne of This were, in the King, A Soveraigne Iustice; Acts of Equitye Haue an Inherent Lustre, but they bring A brighter flame, foyléd by Maiestie. For though the Diamond haue his Light his owne, The Better-setting adds much to the stone. 241 This Iewell, pollishéd by other hands, Glosester doth vnder-valew; 'twas a faint And Languid Act; at least he vnderstands It the wrong way; &amp; This (although hee meant Rather to breath his rancour then reproove One single Action) made the Engine move. 242 The King, (to be thus pest'red with the strange Impertinencyes of an vncle's Tongue) Collects Himselfe: &amp; Passions w?? did range, Hee knitts in Anger; Anger, which among The Passions soe prædominates, wee call It hardly by one Name, Involving All. 243 Thus over-charg'd, &amp; yet vnwilling to Vnlade Himselfe by the first Match that came; Hee kept it as a Cartrage, readie tho', The Cocke prepar'd, &amp; shoulder'd to the Ayme, But yet was out of Distance; Hee soe good A Marke-Man was, he knew how neare he stood. 244 Glocester, (who was aware his Nephew might Be stirr'd beyond the temper of his blood) Delves for himselfe, pretending publick right; For publick Ayre makes private Actings good. So words Delude the World, &amp; what was made For vnderstanding, falls in to perswade. 245 Th' Arch-Bishop, (for I would be loath to bring Conspiracy without a Preist,) the face Of Treason, wants but only colouring; Divinity's a Pencill, which can raise New Lines of feature, though the symmetrye Of States were fixt as they in Bodies bee. 246 Hee, (for religion, in its Bel-weather, Carryes the flock a-madding) tingles out A Chime, to please the Lords, now met together; And made one faggot, by a cunning Knot Of many sticks; they never faile to twist It sure, both Polititian and Preist. 247 An Oath can bind; but, pardon mee, who haue Forfeit the first, will scarce a second keepe; Therfore I blame their Policie who weave Such Common Netts; for beaten fowle will creepe Vnder its sides, when Cover'd; &amp; the bold Breake through the Mash; such Threds can never hold. 248 Arundel, Warwicke, Marshall, are Involu'd By Sacramentall Oath of Secresie, To Act with them; the Action resolu'd That Case of Conscience whether Maiestie Had Warrant, in itselfe; &amp; were wee tyed As they determined 't could not be denyed. 249 What might be their Designe? But bad enough Wee may Imagine. Secret workings haue Secret Intentions. Truth, her face doth show. Treason has many windings, &amp; may heave Like Moles the Earth; but deepe within's the Cell Casting, they'r tooke, but neuer where they dwell. 250 Glocester, Impatient to be confin'd Within himselfe, as were his Cage too straite; Like wilder Birds, soe pent, prolls, till he find A hole, by Chance, or any wider Grate; And there he breakes; the doore left ope, a weake Assay gives freedome; where they may not breake. 251 Words, the vnruly wings of Passion Tower, in strange Circuit, 'bove the middle Ayre. The Duke was hurryed thus; his haut expresion Wants not a feather, to convey him there; Hee threat'ned lowd, and from his words wee may Iudge what they mean't; soe broke Clouds let in Day. 252 Hee'd take the King (an alien to the blood Hee sate by soe, in Constitution,) And mew him vp, or keep him in a Hood, A Prison, a Cloyster; in Conclusion, Was but his part; &amp; 'twas a portion Fitter (make Glocester Iudge) then was his Throne. 253 Moubray, who had gone all the way along Vpon these Washes, with the other Lords; Now to goe further, thought a Quick-sand sprung Might swallow him, &amp; passing o're some fordes In his way back, (Hee the way quickly found) Stops on the banke, and shakes him on dry ground. 254 Then, like a Man who had now scap't a wracke, Hee to himselfe repeats the Danger past; But, stay'd hee there, hee perishéd for Lacke Of help; and former toyles are but releast By rest and warmth; there to remember late Dangers, wee please ourselues, and laugh at fate. 255 Hee to y? King discouers what he knew; Hee knew the Secret of the whole designe. Some thinke he told him more y? was, &amp; threw Dangers to fright at Randome, for the fine Fallacy of a Double Traytor, Must Augment the Treason, to Improve his Trust. 256 And to secure himselfe in what he had done, Least Glocester's Credit &amp; Relations might Effront his storye; for Opinion Will not be baffled, where but Wrong or Right Is vouch'd by single mouthes; soe oft wee see Iustice, mistaken Popularitie. 257 Hee (to prevent Occasion of Dispute) Surpriseth Glocester; &amp; to avoid what more Might Issue to his preiudice, without The reach of Heareing hee convey's him, ore To Callice, Mowbrey's Government; for still Revolters must be wicked, 'bove their will. 258 Others arrested are; and to Evince It to the World; the world which will mistake Such Actions, as Revenges, in a Prince; That Name is still Obnoxious to the weake And wild coniectures of vncertaine Heads, Who knowes naught further then their Passion leads. 259 Glocester, w?? the Cheife of his Complices, Indited are of Treason; for the Packe Was broken; some subborn'd, &amp; some release Their owne engagements to the former Act; Then Ruine followes; for they neuer misse Who are call'd to Councell from Conspiracyes. 260 A Parliament is call'd, where the maine Act Was to make Null what former Parliaments In Power of Glocester's faction, did enact; And make it Treason. These are Presidents Whence wee may learne how councels are noe more Iust, then inclin'd or warranted by Power. 261 What former laws had past in their behalfe, (For the Law-Makers euer will secure Themseves) are now repeal'd. Who can but laugh In the sowre face of Policie, to view her Through all her Changes? For ev'n Trifles passe Like grave designes, w?? the same serious face. 262 The Duke of Lancaster, High-Steward, Sate In Iudgment with his Peers; where Arundel (Lost to the Honour of his Blood, the State Of his owne Honour,) as a Traytor fell, To ignominious Sentence; but the King Changéd the forme, satisfy'd w?? the thing. 263 Hee (if the words of dying men may passe For Credit) dissavow'd the Charge throughout, With Noble Courage. Such a fire still has Its Influence. And many present thought Th' Envy of others, noe Crime of his owne, Fitted the Axe to his Destruction. 264 Worthy the Honour of his Name &amp; Blood, Worthy Himselfe, (or might I adde more merit) Worthy succession, if it might haue stood In the same Name, the honour to inherit. But Names are Nothing; vertue giues the boast, Which to his blood &amp; Title is not Lost. 265 Warwicke confest the Act. If hee who Lookes And covets, guilty bee, Intention Is Treason Acted. Where the will provokes, Man Actually performes; &amp; though prevention May happen, 'tis w?? out vs; can Wee bee Bound, in our causes, &amp; the Effects free? 266 Hee weakly (that wee, modestly, noe more May vrge Indignity on Noble Blood,) With Tears, confest the Treason, which before, With Glocester hee incurr'd. Some thinke hee stood Dandled with hopes of Life, &amp; like a Child, But prattled, as his Maister frown'd or smil'd. 267 But as the Noble Arundel has Sped, Equally guilty, by Confession more: One Spindle carries thus a double Thred, One Shears must cutt them both. But see the Power Of Princes! When the Wastfull Slut came in To cutt the Thred, Hee made the Huswife Spin. 268 The Sentence is reverst; &amp; Warwicke, who Had little Man about him, in his want Pittied, perhaps by Maiestie, who now Was a Man-Maker; put him in Restraint Vnto that Ile. What petty things may carry Their force! what great Things, seem but ordinary! 269 Glocester, (who, like the Cuckoe in the Spring, Carried the little Birds with him along,) Must not Appeare; for publike tryalls bring Danger, when not the Man, but faction May be engag'd; &amp; his Necessitye Makes Common Actions stand for Policye. 270 Hee, (who too open was, &amp; hardly tooke The Cover of discretion, to lye warme In his designes; as if now Fate had tooke The reine from Nature, though too late t' enforme,) Was smother'd. Life &amp; Death, although they are In Centre one, Antipodes appeare. 271 This Fire, (which like its Elementall cause, Inspir'd all lower Bodies,) in its Source Being extinct, it followes, by the Lawes Of Nature, deriv'd vigours loose their force. For were the Sun burn't out, Astrologie Might Riddle in a very Empty Skye. 272 But this was Moone-shine; &amp; the many Sparkes Which glimmered were but Glow-Wormes in her Ray. Soe their Green-tayles can only shine in Dark's. Mutinie loves a Mist, but a Cleare Day Glads a Quicke Sence; &amp; Reason doth informe With perfect Notions Faction in a storme. 273 This Orbe, which from another flame tooke light Without Acknowledgment, now suffers to The Irregularitie, or vntrod height; Hee aym'd beyond his Sphœre. Now humbled low Vpon the Ground, a Ielly, hee doth Lye, Once thought a starre; soe starres deceiue the Eye. 274 This, the Great Parliament; what former Acts Had past, as preiudiciall to the King, Are now repeal'd; &amp; who, for seuerall facts, Ere while had suffered, Burgeon with the Spring. Soe Bloomes the Almond; but such early flowers Spred with small Sun, as small a frost devours. 275 These, by a Publicke Act, stand vnattaint; Their honours safe, Their Offices restor'd; Soe powerfull is y? breath of Parliament. Miracles are not ceas'd; 'tis an abhorr'd Stupor doth Circumvolue vs, nere to Death; To prove it, Wee need only sence, not faith. 276 If, when wee see the Lame, the Blind, the Mute, Restor'd to former Soundnes; if from Death, For Death from seuerall Trees is but one fruite; And Dead in Law wants an inspireing breath, As well as dead in Nature. If all These May be Convincive, Wee haue Miracles. 277 This Idol-shrine, (for yet Imposturisme Wags with a wing) can boast of greater Things Then many Temples famed; if a Schisme May pass w?? out reproach; as Hee who brings The Shears may Cutt his owne Cloth as he list; To Altar's profit makes the pious Preist. 278 But that the King might Act secure, and be Illyable to other men's Account, Bee it Enacted. Let Posteritye Take notice, to their Shame, who now haue don't. Who moves, but what the King doth first propose, Shall suffer as a Traytor. Oh! the House! 279 The King (who creepled till he came before This Shrine) walkes vpright now, &amp; left within His Crutches hung, a Testimoniall, more T' emprove the Image, &amp; adorne the Shrine; Beggars, at Common Wells, may wash for health, But Kings, i' th' fountaine of the Common Wealth. 280 The King now spreads himselfe; &amp;, as a source, Issues in larger Streames, to take in more, Hee fills the Cisterns nere him; till the force Of many meeting, make but One all ore. For honour is a flood, &amp; who dare ride Over a drownéd Marsh, without a Guide. 281 Nobilitie, Translated! 'tis the same In any Language, which at first was mean't. Hee ever renders best, who knew the frame Originally; 'tis a different Thing to translate from others; only from The Author; Sence suits every Idiome. 282 The first in honour was the next in Blood To Richard; Harrie Bullingbroke, now Duke Of Hereford; something is vnderstood In Titles, though not giv'n as they are tooke; But where the words imply a difference In honour, Active Natures find the sence. 283 As warrented by Patent, now he may Be somewhat bolder; &amp; the ill-taught Scribe Flatter'd him in three letters; 'twas a way To prompt a Duller Soule; for wee ascribe Things proper; Monosyllables are knit Something w?? in a shell; noe ioynt in it. 284 But Hee had many Rivalls; &amp; hee thought His Blood &amp; Merit went beyond them All. Mowbrey, made Equall Duke, (although he brought But the King's fauor, for Originall,) Must be remouéd; &amp; that hee might not faile Him, he Impeaches by a Solemne tale; 285 As, he had said, the King disvaluéd The Peer'age of the Kingdome; that, hee was Vnfit for Government; with a long thred Of high reproaches, to the King's disgrace; And come it to the worst (Hee knew the worst) 'Twas but the Thing hee ayméd at the first: 286 Norfolke's remove. For eyther he must grant Or els deny the Accusation. The first hee could not thinke; 'twas but one Rent To make him Cocke; for Mowbray's vindication, Troubled him little. If the sword must try it, Hee had an Equall sett, &amp; choos'd to play it. 287 'Twas soe determined once; now when the two Were sworne, &amp; ready-mounted, fitt to run, The King forbade it; other fortunes now Are lay'd out to them All; but had Hee knowne His owne included, Hee'de haue stopt that breath Which rose the certaine Hick-hoe to his death. 288 They must be banish't, &amp; his better freind Must suffer deeper. Him, noe Time brings home; Hereford, ten years; but how shall he spend Soe long a time in Exile? He must come Within that Terme; for, granted as a boone, Fower years were taken off; 'twas but All one. 289 A yeare before, vpon the very Day This sentence past, Gloster was murd'red By Mowbrey's Instruments. How strictly may Wee force Accounts? Though Providence be sped Aforehand, &amp; the little sight of Men Makes but the fitter Time of now &amp; Then. 290 The King prepares for Ireland, whilst at home Hee suff'red nearer; then, in his next heyre, Hee lost Himselfe; nor need a Trouble, from His Act in the Entayle to Mortimer, Hinder Succession; Kings need neuer feare, Though Issueless, to Dye w?? out an heire. 291 If from Affinities in Royaltie Wee may observe, The Laurels withered Throughout the Kingdome, &amp; as soudainly (Such was the Change) were w?? new verdure Spred. But why the Laurel? Rather should the Broome, If wee allude, &amp; things must proper come. 292 And to the honour of that Liueing Name; For Names shall Live when Life &amp; Blood decay: If Empire carry Power, or Actions fame, Be the Broome Glorious as the Roman Bay; Plantagenet as Cæsar. Only Love And Witt, ne're-Dying Laurel must approve. 293 Other Portents there were; Rivers devide Their single Channels into seuerall Streams; Batts flye in Mid-Day Sun, &amp; Day defie'd; The Sun was double, in his Orbe &amp; Beames, T' affright the world; &amp; through the Euening Skye (Terrible Lights) King-threat'ning Comets flye. 294 These are the Capitalls, which obvious are In Nature's Alphabet; the dullest head Can spell some meaning, [be it near or far:] There is a Narrower Print, where wee may read; Wonder enough, though Nature carry none; For Wonder is but what wee haue not knowne. 295 Nature is one smooth Tract; a Regular And faire progression of all causes mixt; There are noe Blinds, nor Loop-holes in her Spheare; Nothing comes odly in; but from a fixt Determination, all things Rise or Fall; And proper Motions, Prodigies wee call. 296 That foole (who els the Great Philosopher) Was angry that an Egg-shell might not hold An Elephant. Who pittyes him, to heare His ruine? or the Poet, who (too bold) Would enter Ætna? They who did but slide Atomes within her Glasse, the Glasse would guide. 297 Soe may the Narrow-should'red Pigmey heave Mount Caucasus; soe may a Cent'red Rocke Bee made a Tennis-ball; the Eternall wave Run through a Quill; the Great Abisse w?? broke Vpon all formes, contract into a Thimble; And Nature's selfe, the vniversall, Dwindle. 298 Something is still without vs; and wee yawne But the same Ayre which wee expiréd erst; The Clue of vnderstanding can be drawne But from that Bottome, w?? it had at first; Like Silke-Wormes labouring in their huswifryes, Run out that Seed, &amp; then are Butterflyes. 299 These painted Wings wee value 'bove the warme Spun Coats wee had at first; &amp; rather Chuse To flye, a Boy's Sport, then within the Arme Of Mother Nature, &amp; the Native Boughs Of Mulberries, sitt Tennant; like the Race Of Nomades, wee shift from place to place. 300 But least my running Tent may Trench vpon Another's feild, I fixe my Pole downe here, In Richard's Soyle; hee readie now to run And leave it Empty. Giddy Paces, ne're Carry too light a sound; if Running doe, Not my word but his Rashness made it soe. 301 But ere hee went, his vncle Lancaster Dyes, &amp; Hee makes Himselfe Executor; ('Twas but soe farre before hand) for the Heire Must come to claime his Right; &amp; wer't noe more, Richard had beene a saver; but till Fate Drive to that Point, wee not Anticipate. 302 Harry is yet an Exile, &amp; the King Seizeth what, by decease of his Great Sire, Were Iustly His; &amp; Little Time did bring Him back a Denizon; but the King here Changes the Coppie; Years for Life; how thwart Must this Lease bee to Harry's Counter-part! 303 Harry abroad, &amp; made Incapable Of his Iust Rights at home; (the fountaine Law Stopt to his Current,) haueing noe Appeale, Thinkes how to right himselfe. Exegents draw Their owne Conueniencyes w?? them, through all Th' appearing Difficulties w?? may fall. 304 The King in Ireland; Oportunitye Is the Broad Gate to every Designe. Harry, the Wickets, which necessitye Had taught, ere while, neglects, seeing the maine Port open to his Entrance, with the few Hee had, comes in: where many freinds hee knew. 305 The Great Northumberland (whom yet soe great Richard had made before) comes with the first To gratulate his Landing. 'Tis a fate Falls on the Blood, as were the Percyes nurst By MeirMaids; or some Sybill had Imprest Antipathy to present Interest. 306 His Troopes increaseing; Like that Warrier Who could but Stampe his foot &amp; men would start, Hee trod noe Idle step. Fame went afore, And tooke his Quarters vp in euery heart. Billet is Sanctuarie; Hee need put Noe duetye on them; Euery Man's his Scout. 307 Thus got within the walles, the Ocean Is as a Brazen Wall to the English feilds, The Citizens; for, in the proper Notion, Inhabitants are All soe. Our Age yeilds A difference; but Glorious Rome did call Her free-borne Subiects soe, involving All. 308 The Inhabitants, (because I will not bee Mistooke in Trifles) smile to see him come; And strow the way w?? Palme; (if victorye Be equall to its Symbole) not a Drumme Beats to affright the villages; his Name Rung through all townes; &amp; to that sound they came. 309 Hee who with Modest clame did but come in Of proper Heritage, with the faire Gale Of meerly Lancaster; gott within Ken With many Winds, rides now a fuller Sayle, Vp to a fairer Harbour; Vessells in This Sea, spread Canvas, every wind to win. 310 Harry (who by his Card knew how farr on His Voyage he might be, &amp; past the Bay Hee ayméd) Scudds amayne; &amp; shrouds anon Safely at Anchor. For they Anchors weigh Who dread swolne Tides. Hee soe farr had thrust Will not endanger Ruine at one Gust. 311 Hee, therfore, Lyes aloofe, that Hee may come In with advantage and securitye, Poore Yorke sitts troubled, Nature's equall Doome Disputes, sometimes, with the Iust Soveraigntye; But Loyallty did interpose all tye Of Blood or worth to present Maiestie. 312 Hee fear'd the worst; for though his Nephew had Declar'd the Iustness of his cause, the scope Of his Intentions, Loyall; yet he weighed Increasing Numbers, w?? might flatter hope To strange attempts; that fire-workes temper'd well Till they must execute, breake not the Shell. 313 Yorke, to repell his Power, vseth his owne, Which should haue beene the Kingdome's, for the King. But 'twas an early Spring, the Birds were flowne To fresher Groves, &amp; their new dittyes sing. The King, like a seir Oake, doth only Stand A Perch to Cormorants, on Drownéd Land. 314 Harry's fresh Buds invite them from their Roust, Where they had winter'd. If the Great Ones Sing The smaller Cherrup, as it were on trust; And for God bless the Duke!—God saue the King! Echoes from euery Sprig. Such apt mistakes Are not tooke ill, though 't be a Starling Speakes. 315 Harry, who now had made his Action Secure it selfe, knew how to vse Success; And knitts his Party sure, in the Distraction Of others; marches faster then wee gvess Fame could haue sped his Errand; &amp; ere knowne That hee was Landed, the Land was his owne. 316 Such noble Expeditions doe not stand Blanke Pages in the Commentary'd Acts Of Mighty Cæsar: Hee who overspan'd All Souldiers in his conduct, &amp; Enacts Courage aboue a Man; How often Hee Has found meer Expedition, Victory! 317 Harrie puts the Bright Baudrike of a March Ouer the middle Land, as had Hee mean't A Scarfe of Honour, or an Oblique Arch; And Swept the Corners. Severne is but Trent To many of his Souldiers; soe their feet Outwent their fancy, that they will not see 't. 318 Now before Bristoll he drawes vp his force, A mighty Army. 'Twas not to fore slow Any thing of Intention, to the Course Of what he had begun; but here was now His double Thoughts to be made out. Wee twist Designes like Katherine wheeles, w? Knotts i' th' midst. 319 Here were the few remaining Richard's freinds, And therefore faulty; They were none of His That mov'd him most to Strike; though he pretends A Publike Iustice to the Iniuries Sustained. For euen folly will not Spread A Sheet, where but a Towell it may need. 320 These Men who were Condemn'd by Preiudice, Fall to the Knife of Rage. The Illustrious Sword Of Iustice, in disputed Soveraignties, Rusts in the Scabbard, though the glorious Word Embellish all the vndertakeings which Traytors pursue; &amp; some account it such. 321 The Thred was Spun of Richard's Royaltie, And Harry's Spindle runs the Giddie round, An even Twine. Is there in Maiestie A certaine Fret, to make the better sound? Harrie was then the Artist; &amp; the Sharpe Of his Calme Viall drowned Richard's Harpe. 322 The Silver string was flatt, &amp; did not Sound Worthy the Cunning of a Prince's hand. Ireland he leaves much rent; but the Great Wound Fester'd at home. Chyrurgeons vnderstand, From common principles, that Danger seemes Great in the Seats w?? is not in the extreames. 323 Richard is now return'd; the Irish wave (Proud in its burthen) slips the Royall fraight Into safe Harbour. But noe Harbour's Safe Vnto a Prince that is vnfortunate. Turne how yo? will, Fate has a firme decree: There is a wracke at Land aswell as Sea. 324 Hee treds the shore, &amp; stands amaz'd to see Them empty; not a voice his welcome gave; Silent as midnight in a Cell may be, Was the wide Ayre, but what the rolling waue Did make vpon the Sand, or Distant Throats Of the rude Welsh, in Quest of straying Goats. 325 Walkeing along, the Native Rocks invite Him to repose; one ouer-peering Arche Hung forth a Canopye to make delight Not meerly Royall Costs; at Nature's Charge, The safe ones are provided; Nature brings The course security, to Laugh at Kings. 326 Vnder the Rock hee satt, &amp; sigh'd his owne Dire Sorrowes to his Seate &amp; empty Ayre; Hee mournes his freinds, the Glories hee had knowne, The honours, They. How now, both Nothing are! Iudgment doth looke for right; but Passion flyes Squinting, and, as wee say, Nine wayes at Thrice. 327 Now what was too Remiss or too Seuere, What he did over-act or vnder-doe, Was All presented &amp; discusséd here, Vnto the attentive Rock; one Threne of woe. These Royall Elegiacks interlace Harry's Heroicks, in another place. 328 This small refreshment; for Affliction Is the best Mistresse to dispence our Time Where Oblique Shaddowes, in Reflection, Come nearest Forme, &amp; minuites keepe the Chime To mispent Howers; Time but in the Grosse, Minuites by Parcells, &amp; made vp w?? Losse. 329 This little he had lent put to more vse Then all his Raigne had beene; hee conquered here Himselfe; a victory more glorious Then Princes Chain'd in Roman-Tryvmphs were. Thus from the Forum to the Capitoll His fetter'd Passions to his Reason fall. 330 All call'd away by the Declining Sun, (The Representer of all falling States) He broke out thus; Thy Glory is not Done When that Black Cloud swallowes thee, in her Gates; To morrow, the same Light on vs shall flow; The happier Earth enioys thy presence now. 331 I sett, a Dying Sun; as had I beene But a Cole Kindled by the Common breath; And faint, to their rude failinges. Bee it in My Nature to Convince them, Kings in Death Retaine the Rayes of somewhat nere Devine; Light for to morrow; Thus they follow Thine. 332 This (as the Parting Day, which calmly Sped Away to Harbinger the Sun's Approach In farre-removed Continents,) Hee said; Changing the Rocke, his better Chosen Couch, For a preparéd Bed. Thus Broken Hearts Are bolstred vp, &amp; none can tell their Smarts. 333 Weary of Rest; indeed Hee could not Rest, For many Cares vpon his Temples sate; Hee calls the few about him, more distrest In their Misfortunes then his owne hard fate; Provident of their Safety, not his owne, Hee bids them leave him to his Greifes alone. 334 They might ingratiate with the Conquerour, And live to better Dayes. It was enough To fall a single Ruine; for the Power Which sought the House, would Sweepe the Building through, And what the Landlord then shall Rubbish call, Will be throwne out; and you are Rubbish All. 335 You faithfull vnto Mee; bee to your selves, Loyall; 'tis Nature's first Principle. The wracke has Spred the Sea, &amp; many Shelves Have rent our Vessell; some of you may well Reach to the Shore; my broken Planke can beare Mee vp noe longer; I must suffer here. 336 Many perswasions need not with the most In such a Case; his officers disperse To Compound Safety. Ah! the King is Lost; Lost in his owne Advisements, and the fears Of others; who but tooke Him at the Bound, And struck the Ball away, to pass it Round. 337 Now was Hee come to Conway; there because Hee might not Languish euer, he desires A Conference. Northumberland, who was Harry's Cheif Arme, &amp; Arundel, whose fires Long blowne, durst now breake forth; A Subtle flint, The Miter, When most Cold has most fire in't. 338 This was the Arch-Bishop Arundel, whose Name You find w?? Glocester in Conspiracye; To these, the King (that Kings should be soe tame!) Propounds small Things, to his Necessityes; Soe Small, They were asham'd in his Demands; And only thus, a King, a Traytor stands. 339 That Hee might Live a private, quiet Life, With Safety, &amp; but Eight whom Hee would Chuse, Put into pension. 'Twas soe strange to give As to Demand; for Princes may not vse The Dull Capitulations of their feare; 'Tis weake; Conditions are not binding there. 340 Yet these, the Arch-Bishop and the Earle did Sweare Should be perform'd. Hee goes, &amp; to the Duke (Who yet was call'd noe more) the Prisoner Is Safe Delivered. If the Horrour Strucke Him through, yo? cannot blame him; I who write But this as Storye, have a troubled Spright. 341 From hence to London, by Another's will Compell'd, (a Captive) to Renounce his owne; His Enemies His guard; the Arch-Bishop still Flirting Divinitie against the Throne; And his former Ryotts, and Expence, Squibs the Worne moralls, Hope, &amp; Patience. 342 Soe when the Wingéd Metropolitane, The Raven, finds an Eagle worne &amp; weake, He Iustles Him in flight, &amp; calls amaine The other Birds in Black; never to seeke At a Dead Lift; &amp; Sweepe him in their Shoale, Like the Great Heretick of Birds, the Owle. 343 The Gulls &amp; ruder Layetie draw nere, To know what's done; They clatter with one voice, Our Tyrant Enemie wee bring yo? here; But the Gray Cassock makes a double noyse. 'Tis but in Ayre, as on the Earth, one Cause; Wee haue our Lack-Latins, &amp; They, their Dawes. 344 The Pye but chatters to a Country Cure, And gambolls w?? the Sparrowes in a Bush, Rude Rhetoricke. Our Liberties' pursuer Is led a Captive; Doctrine brings the vse; But silly Chitts they knew not what Hee mean't; Bask'd, Sunn'd, &amp; their Gutts full, to Roust they went. 345 The King they left on the inchanted Rock Which opens at some magicke Syllable, To swallow Him, who carelessly has Spoke His owne destruction. If my verse tells You not the clearer Storye, blame the Thing Rather thus ill-repeated, then the King. 346 But it will out; for Chronicles haue made It Common Chimney talke. Hee did resigne The Government, &amp; what they Writt Hee Read T' opprobriate himselfe. This subtle Gin Thus open'd, &amp; hee following the Scrue, Run in a Labirinth, without a Clew. 347 Not what Hee did, but what they would Suggest Against Him, were his Crimes. His Lenitie Were forcéd Tyrrannies; &amp; soe Exprest In the Large Instrument which they devise. 'Tis a sad thing, Kings made the Common-place: The Rudest Head will bolt a Paraphrase. 348 How farre from the Intention, let them thinke Who know the Bitternes of Nature in A Cup of Interest. If Truth may sinke Or slide in Source, what wonder, though a Pin (To Rivett Lawes which are made Arbitrarye) Be wrested, &amp; the frame it selfe miscarrye. 349 Here draw a veile; or like Noah's blessed Sons, Goe wee on backward, lest wee see the shame Of Princes layd too open; for the Nonce Our Pittye (vnto the sacred Name Of King, what others in Proes rehearse, Sounding soe ill) here Covers with a verse. 350 What followes, (that I here noe further bring His Story out) cannot be of his Raigne; 'Tis done, &amp; Hee Dead to the Name of King, Though not in Nature. 'Tis another Scæne Wee tread now; The vsurpéd Power must be Our Argument, the Royall Elegie. The End of Richard the Second. END OF VOL. III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Raigne of Henry the Fourth. 1 Time is but ours at Instants, and wee slip In the same Wheele, but to another Notch. The Pulse of Nature neuer giues one trip; Ages are the same howers; and noe approach Of Weaknes in her Constitution Beyond all Credit of Opinion. 2 Things pass w?? the same Breath, and the same Ayre Opens to All, w?? at the first was spread; The Earth as fertile, and her fruites as fayre; The Sun as Glorious, and Noe One Light dead, Or Glimmers w?? a fainter Ray; that Flame W?? kindled doth continue them the same. 3 The Curtains of the Circum-ambient Ayre Were hung at first, or lay as Coverletts, And fitt for eyther vse, as yet they are; The same hand spreads them out who folds our Witts In blanketts of that stuffe, or doth display Them in wide Canopies: 'tis one thing, one way. 4 For Man, the little World soe truly call'd, Is lyable to All the Passion (Soe wee may call it) of the greater World; Has the same Dampes, &amp; the same exhalation, The same Serenity and Stormes; and can Call himselfe World aswell as Pygmie Man. 5 'Tis in mee now doubly Distempered; A Stormy Day and an vnquiet Age; Vsurping Clouds, the Sun,—my head— Involv's; but more than both, th' vnguided Rage Of an Insultinge Conquerour, who shreds Maiesty like the mounting Poppie-Heads. 6 I am Surrounded; Extasie doth Spread Little in Language; Passion may provoke Words in weake natures; 'tis the strongest head Containes a horror. When wee cleaue some Rocke, The Anchorites in Nature are enlardg'd; Great Thoughts are thus Immur'd, &amp; thus discharg'd. 7 Poore King! I weepe, a stranger to the day; For Light has left his Cell, or the whole Orbe Is but one Chaos; take that Light away Wee Walke with an Arme out; &amp; but disturbe Our selues in Motion; though Hee cannot fall, If hee tread firme, who keeps him nere the Wall. 8 That Wall shall be my guide; how farre it tends Noe Matter; 'tis but like the fancyed world In former times; They thought the world had Ends, And Light from East to West was only whirl'd; Makeing a vacuum of one Hemispheare, And the Sun wak'd &amp; slept as wee doe here. 9 Or to keepe State w?? vs, when he had showne His Glory to the World, through the Great Hall, There were Darke Lobbies in the Spheare, w?? run The streight Cutt, &amp; to his bed Chamber fall; Till there recreuted w?? another stocke, Hee measur'd out his Iourney by his Clocke. 10 'Tis not my busines; if I can find The Sun I looke for, after any time, Spread to Informe the Eyes, inspire the mind; My Mathematickes erre not; more sublime Enquiries may tracke him out's Eclipticke way; Giue mee the vse, &amp; Them the Algebra. 11 Richard (whom late wee left dethron'd) is not Worne from the Storye, though worm'd out of King; Some sad occasions fall, where wee must put His Name in Mention, though our Title bring An other Cheifly Naméd. Soe wee tread As y? Vsurper hales vs ore his Head. 12 The Resignation receiu'd by the House And Enter'd, but one Man who disavow'd it; Faithfull Achates, if the Glorious Names who haue honour'd vertue &amp; pursu'd it, Ennoble Memory. Let my verse be One Sprig to keepe alive such Loyaltie. 13 Carlisle's grave Bishop (that the Clergy may Not suffer in Opinion or Right) Singly oppos'd it. There can be noe Day Where Loyalltie is Lov'd, without his Light; And least the Rest may blame mee, thus I bring To them, the Titles, to him the Offeringe. 14 Hee, like a Light set on high-places, spred His beames of Loyalltie to Euery Eye; Soe Pharos stood, w?? a far-shininge head, To direct Passengers. Varietie Of Mouthes open their Sence; 'tis fitt there were, As a Tower there to guide, a truth fixt here. 15 'Twas but his owne; &amp; though the Glory be Greater vnrivall'd, and a Thousand Names Of honour fall due to his Loyaltie And to his Courage, let vs draw the extreame In to the Centre; as in purest gold, What well-spread Acres, a Mushell Shell will hold. 16 The vsurper (for while Richard lives, the Name Of King shall neuer Issue from my pen, To any els,) the Royaltie doth claime, And exercise the Power. Writts Issue in His Name; Allegeance cancell'd by the same Act of new fealty w?? hee did frame. 17 Thus forkéd Novelty Spreads, to bring in, W?? Eyther hand; vsurpéd Government Stands by noe single meanes; 'tis All a thin Cob web of Policye, whose full extent Only the brooding Spider knowes, who, hid, Sees a new Prey, and Spins another thred. 18 All things of good are single; Essence is One Cause in All &amp; over All; the whole Patternes are best tooke from true principles. Pythagoras was Angry at that Foole Who first Invented Number, as a breach From vnitie, the bond of Nature's Peace. 19 For when diuision (whose Arethmeticke Makes but a Logarisme to perplex The world, &amp; may be summ'd the Politicke Totall of Errour,) play'd with Stones &amp; Stickes, T' Invite the world, the After-Game was sure, To higher Interests of Right &amp; Power. 20 The Power now raigninge (a devided Shred From the true Loyaltie,) indemnifies His party, &amp; his publike offers Spread To all the Kingdome; vsurpation flyes With a bold winge, &amp;, as his Parent did, Offers the world but to be worshippéd. 21 That Hee might please the People (government Attaynéd thus, must thus be managéd,) Some former Acts (which to the discontent Of th' Anti-regal Party, wholly led In Gloster's faction) had Enacted beene, Hee nulls; &amp; Blood attaint, restores agen; 22 Gloster &amp; Arundel; the rest who fell Confederates w?? them, are vn-attaint; Soe to enact new Things, &amp; to repeale Some former Acts, formes a new Government. And all such Power stands on this double Base,— Some Acts of Rigour &amp; some Acts of Grace. 23 'Tis not an Euen-Streame; the winding shore Warps many whirl-pitts. Policy must haue Vncertaine Eddyes; soe may Tides breake ore The highest Land-Marke. Sometimes the faint waue Cannot reach out; thus Land-wraks Cædars Lye, Or Cockle Shells vpon the Shores are drye. 24 A præscript Method; Formall Politicks Stand to amuse the world, &amp; bladder out Light Braines. The Florentine w?? one Leg Sticks, Keeping the dirty Roade. Some goe about To come in sooner; 'tis but for a Packe (Who cannot Leape the Hedge) to keepe the Tracke. 25 Each Man is his owne Master to himselfe, And may be Pilot in his owne Designe; Who steers by others falls vpon a Shelfe Was not knowne by the Chard. There is a Line Springs from All humane Actions to informe A nearer way then by the written Norme. 26 Some Common Principles may Iutty out And stand as Peiers, the lesser Barks to shroud; Great Vessells put not in, but tacke about, Or Anchor for a while w?? in the Roade; Till a faire wind &amp; a full canvase giue Them Sea-Roome, or Safe Port where to Arrive. 27 Harrie, his owne Instructer; for indeed The Drift and frame of what hee had begun Was from himselfe; though some perhaps might read To him att howers, the Act was All his owne; Great Master in his Art, whose proiects laid, A little Seed erewhile, now Spreads a Shade. 28 Titles of Honour which the King Conferr'd, Th' Vsurper takes away; &amp; a new list, Rais'd in his family &amp; freinds, as wer't A Pageantrie in Acts of State. Who is't That sitts Spectator to this varied show, But knowes the Better Scæne, &amp; loves it too? 29 Only the rude and Ignorant are pleas'd With a wild Morrice &amp; a Painted Coate; Laughter, the Ioy of Fooles! The wise are rays'd W?? Witt &amp; Honour. Let the giddy foote Venter to tread a Rope, &amp; the dull Crue Giggle their Pence; Hee laughs as much at yo?. 30 The Bill without the doore tells what's w?? in, (Or the poore Countrey-man has lost his Coyne) A Monster commonly; &amp; then 't had beene But honest; now wee fitt yo? w?? a fine And further Story; when a Changéd State Spreads [ominous]; &amp; yet it is but that. 31 The Yoake shall be tooke off; the Government Reform'd through out. Who ere saw Reformation Vpon a Change? 'Tis promis't, but the Event Falls treeble Burden vpon euery Nation. Yet Silly men (whom neyther others' harmes, Nor their owne Sufferings teach) attend these Charmes. 32 Harry thus Spred his Nett; the Birds come in To his Chaffe-baite; soe are not Old birds tooke, (If Proverbs hold). What Callow things are Men? And feed on Shaddowes, Shaddowes in a Brooke, Like Æsop's Dog. 'Tis but a drye Itch, w?? sure Knitts w?? our Causes, &amp; Admitts noe cure. 33 The gapeing Rout, (who euery one had gott His Soppe,) as men in dreames are satisfied, Some little Spleene remaines for Rage &amp; Chatt; And digests double meales. The vsurper cryed His markett, in good penniworths; y? best Kept to himselfe; a Gainer by the Rest. 34 Safe to himselfe, full in his Government, Knowing his guilt, (for Crimes, besides their weight, Neuer lye steddye,) Neighbour Kings (Impent W?? Horror at the fact, in their owne Right,) Hee Courts by his Ambassadors; &amp; fitts, With a new minc't-meat, seuerall Appetites. 35 France only, more Concern'd, denyes to tast The Quelque-Chose; they would bring another in To Harrie's Board (though not soe cleanly drest, Of better nourishment) ere hee should wish; They threat'ned big, but Harry's table Spread; And he can eate his owne, now Grace was said. 36 The King of France (who oft-distempers had Made apt to Frenzy) at this Great Occasion, His daughter's Iniurye, falleth starke Mad. Poore Conquer'd King! yet threaten an Invasion To England. 'Twas well ment, but let him stay; His voyage tends to the Anticyra. 37 The French (who bustle much, &amp; Rant their Rage On like occasions) threaten deepe reuenge; Hott spiritts breath at home; they'le hardly wage A warre in England; the Ocean has a Strange Influence on such Natures. If the Bridge Verstegan fancies, stood, they might engage. 38 How kind was Nature to this latter Age Of Ilanders, if former Ages knew It but one Continent! In Danae's Cage Wee Nestled happy are, &amp; secure now From the French Rauisher; the Golden Shower Only begets a Perseus in that Tower. 39 And this seclusion is but in our vse A happiness; the fangle of Conceit Lives in a Cell; Fancy is the Abstruse Knott in our Natures; whether, (if wee treat By Problemes) doth Corruption or force Move Most, wee see the better, Chuse the worse. 40 Now Richard's aukward fate (ill omen on The Wings of Fame to those who marke her flight,) Weigh'd deepe with All; as euery Neighbour Throne Was Lyable to the like ouersight. Adde but some slender graines, the Alloy will hold Its mintage Currant, as the purest gold. 41 France, but a single Chapman, did refuse This Coyne. Noe matter, Harrie has in Banke At other Marts; France shall nor will nor chuse; His Son must Live to quitt old scores. Noe thanke If they are satisfied; the owner takes But in his money, &amp; the Scrivener breaks. 42 The Aquitanians (Loyall to the King Cheifly because a Native) hardly brooke This Change; the french men aggravate the thing, To their displeasures in the English yoke; Gascoynie, parcell-guilt, is now brought in, To fyle that off, or wash all ore agen. 43 But Harry (shineing in the Radiant Plumes Of Loyaltie) cannot abate that Tip; A feather broke in blood. 'Tis in the Looms Of State, a brack for euer, if they Slip One Thred. 'Twas now the Time; &amp; Time o're rules Actions of Wisedome, Giddines of Fooles. 44 Harry, a Subtle Crab, when now the Tide Invites the Ravish't Oyster for to Yawne, Throwes in a stone; because he may not bide The beating Surge, to make it then his owne. Soe this devided Province op'd her Shell For a fresh Spume, but 'twas a Stone that fell. 45 Worcester, (who had beene Steward formerly To Richard) was made Harrye's Generall In this Employment, w?? he happily Performd. Oh dire Successes! thus when All Causes are mett, their Radij must Spread, W?? wee can nor Advantage nor Evade. 46 The threds of many meeting, all Conspire And end præfixt. Man, but a part of these, Runs w?? the Rest, as Ignorant as they're, Perhaps less knowing; Reason makes him guess What is ascertain'd theirs; all Causes lurke To vs; but move in them to doe the worke. 47 If to deduct were not a vanity, From some late Doctrines it might be made out Nought in the verge of our Humanitye Moves single; the whole Creature Chain'd through out; And this is Nature's Armlet, but the Gvive Vnto themselues, from which they cannot strive. 48 This full Confederacy, in all Effects, Spreads from its Equally-Compounded Cause. Man may be happy in the Circumscripts Of Individuall, but Glory drawes Its Channel from moe heads; soe Nilus flowes From Tribute Streames &amp; Æthiopian Snowes. 49 Where noble Nature, from Contracted Rayes, Meets in a glasse capable of its flame, All Matter kindles; &amp; the open'd Face Of Sympathie blushes to weare that Name; That Masque put off, she comes in w?? full Meine, Noe vaile of occult Quality betweene. 50 Man (if wee erre not) is a Quintessence Extracted from crude principles; the Greate Chymist is Nature; Bees (w?? out offence) Are her best Schollers; difference in the Heate Adds or Impaires; Harry, calcined, brought His Spirit workeing what hee went about. 51 When Power, w?? a large Sayle, rides in the wind To wonder at, euen Atomes whirle her on; Atomes, which none can see, but All may find, Assistants; likewise, when destruction Hurries on ill-wrought wheeles, those formes, as now In Nature Chang'd, contribute ouerthrow. 52 The Gascoines (like all French, who euer run Light-headed in a Snaffle) are brought in W?? the strong Curbe of Garrisons. How soone The Coltishnes of Mutinye has beene Appeas'd, when wise Hipparchus, not afrayd Of his high breathing, boldly mounts the Iade. 53 The Gascoynes thus enfirm'd, &amp; noe great feare Of French Invasion, by their proper force, Their Allyes Charge the Nation in the Rere; The Scotts; &amp; Plague (may wee say, w?? is worse,) Wasted Northumberland; Plague only is A harbinger to Scots,—worse Maladies! 54 Incenséd heauens soe yet Commiserate Nations, when vtmost vengeance is but due; They offer Articles; &amp; only threat, With Batteries aloofe, what they could doe, In distance. Soe van-Current feavers but Yeild to a Pestilence, That, to the Scott. 55 'Twas but a petty inroade now they made, Though where they went they wasted. Shall wee boast Of Scotts, as of great Soliman 'tis said, Whose horse's foote was a devouringe frost, Where ere he trode? Hee only swept the Grasse, They the Grasse-Eaters, &amp; 't their Errand was. 56 Soe from a Nasty Kennel may wee see A Flea pickeere vpon a Lady's hand. Scotts are but euen such Vermine; Bred in more dirt; for wee but vnderstand &amp; may be Stench to an English Nostrill,) starv'd at home (Keene biters) They to better pastures come. 57 But that I may not carry Harrie from His busines, &amp; a Swarme of Gnats be seene Provoke an Eagle; danger nearer home Is hatching, ready to disclose; when in The houre expected, one Egge, Addle growne, Betrayes them All, &amp; out the Nest was throwne. 58 'Twas thus; Aggreiuéd with the Government, Some to their owne Ambitions, some to right Deposéd Richard; Each his owne intent Kept to himselfe; &amp; solemne contract plight T'endeauor but the latter; many heads Draw out, from one designe, their seuerall threds. 59 The Cheife of these were Richard's Relatives In Blood; their Names are obvious euery where; Number may carry Names, but Hee who striues To force 'em, (when the Action makes it Cleare Who must be Actors) hardly brings a verse Worthy his Labour to Iudicious Eares. 60 'Twas there devis'd, in honour of the Late Atcheivéd Soveraigntie, to entertaine Harrie with Actions not below his State, To Iudge on; in these Iusts, who euer ran, Better or worse, noe matter; Harrie's fall Was but the End, and they were Victors All. 61 The Time was come, They mett; &amp; Harry (who Was neuer Truant, in an Equall Forme, Glad to be Master, yet forgets not soe That he was scholler once,) not dreading harme, Prepares to meet, at the appointed place And Time, which then but on the morrow was. 62 When Exeter, one of the Principalls, (The Challenge past 'twixt him &amp; Salisbury,) Was come to Oxford, not One Man of All Was absent, but Aumarle; what it might be Was wonder to the Rest, &amp; each Man Past Their Censure in his stay, by their owne hast. 63 Aumarle was absent; in the Scale of Blood Hee could encline to neither; adde a graine Of Loyaltie, y? Ballance made it good; Scruples of doubt soone drew that vp againe; Soe did Hee Stand; but rusty growne of late The Pin gaue Currency to vnder weight. 64 Hee, double traitor; for I will not bring A cruel father to an Impious Son; 'Twas a strange Subtlety, to weare a Thing Concern'd soe much, w?? soe small Caution; And what Improbabilities appeare Through all the Circumstance wee say not here. 65 Then be it his owne Act; for 'tis noe boote To put old Yorke in Choller, make a stirre, And Saddle Horses for a Wager to 't; As were a Son's Death worth a Father's Spurre. Wee'le button vp his Doublet, &amp; preuent Th' Old Man soe much trouble, soe ill Spent. 66 When Harrie, now by Circumstance assur'd Of the whole Plot; for 'twas apparent All From Hints, &amp; askes noe Time to be secur'd; Danger allowes but Instants as they fall: Hee knew the place was slippery where he stood; But one Remove might make his footing good. 67 From Windsore, hee to London hasts away; Yet not a suddaine flight, to Argue feare; Hee knew not what it was; that I but may Give him a Right in Honour, to appeare Worthy his Name. If Names their worth may Carry, Plantagenet was Syllabled in Harry. 68 Those who to right the Royall Cause had gon Soe farre, though now discouered, must make Their way to any Opposition; For Harry gathered Strengths, &amp; now they Speake What could not be Conceal'd; they spred a wing Of open force, now to restore the Kinge. 69 They know their guilt too great; it toucht too near The Interest of the present Government, To expect Mercy. 'Tis a sordid feare Compells some Natures, in the Exigent Of perill, to looke Backe; but They who knew The Danger sure, the hazard still pursue. 70 There was a Chaplaine to the former King, Like him in Person, &amp; of Equall years; And that hee might not faile in any thing, Princely Attir'd, that Richard hee appears; Now to delude the Commons, who Complaine, And gon, still dig Antigonus againe. 71 They who in Richard's Raigne, w?? Scorne &amp; Spleene Pursu'd his Actions, &amp; the gaudye word Of Tyrranie had Chaw'd, (like Players in A young Colt's mouth,) against their late Leige-Lord, Now Court his Shadow. Soe well painted Grapes Deceiue the Birds, &amp; they come in by Heaps. 72 'Twas now but what to doe? Harry was gone; Their Numbers fall; for like a Torrent, Fame Of Richard's being present hurried on The Chipps &amp; Lighter Bodies w?? its streame. Light Aires Light Bodies move; soe Chaffy brains Leape to the Amber of vncertaine meanes. 73 Should they pursue the Prey, or, lest some Time Might shew the fallacie of their false King, Were it not better to deliuer him? 'Might satisfy their Armes? Dilemmas bring Too many starting holes; &amp; euery pause Rebates the Edge of Minds in any Cause. 74 'Twas soe resolu'd; vpon the doubtfull Quest The Game gets to safe Covert; the Doggs ran Out an old Haunt; Richard must be releas'd; Harry prunes safe, &amp; brings fresh feathers on T'enlarge his wing; their Sarcills, soudaine stopt, Pine out in Lead, &amp; all the Plummage dropt. 75 The C?mons, (who are neuer satisfied W?? Expectations, &amp; propose their owne Ends to their vndertakeings,) haueing stay'd Some dayes, grow thin, knock of at euery towne, And slipp into their stalles, or breake a fence: Noe fence for feare, a Proverbe euer since. 76 Harry drawes out his force, a body knit In discipline &amp; Ioynt Affection; Nature but giues two Legs to all erect Bodies, &amp; these move best to Action. Bodies who haue most feet goe w?? lest Speed, And many moueing, move w?? moe then need. 77 This Insect, w?? the Ray of Richard's name Quick'ned from Native slime, (a Merry Worme Vnder a Hedge) to shew but whence it came, Resolues to dirt againe in the next Storme; The Storme was C?minge; in an Angry cloud It slipt, in Changéd Ayre, to its owne Mud. 78 The terror strucke, &amp; the remaininge few (Fearing to Cope with Harry) wheele about; The Queene was near; 'twere pitty but shee knew Their vndertakeings; She (alas) who thought A feild of Men but as her Cushionet Stuck full of Pins, call'd it a goodly sight. 79 And in her Childish heat She falls vpon The servants, who in Harrie's Liverie Attended her, &amp; pluckes his Ensignes downe, Where ere they stood, as were her Maiestie Againe Enthron'd, or Richard, in her Rage Releas't, or Harry ruin'd in his Page. 80 Fame had before the escape of Richard told (Fame, euer false, in the affairs of Kings,) W?? raught her open Eare, growne out more bold; Harry was fled, &amp; all the little Thinges Of Confirmation to a woeman's faith, Had worne the Grasse of doubts an open Path. 81 But now the Lords, who came to satisfy Her what was done, and what they did Intend, Stopt the wild Current of her Iollitye; Richard was yet in hold; 'twas to noe End To hide it from her; the Gull only past Vpon the Commons, that he was releast. 82 Like a thin cloud borne by vnruly Winde, They wander in the Region of their doubt, And drop away their Rage. Wee cannot finde A Simile, for vagrant as a Rout Possest with feare, led by vnskillfull guides, [Or] the loose Eddyes of vncertaine tides. 83 Now come to Cicester, the Nobler Inne, More to their Ease; the souldiers in the feild Entrench, &amp; raise their little Hutts within, For proper Cabin. Had yo? there beheld This new Plantation, yo? might well haue guest Them Myrmidons, Each in his Ant-hill nest. 84 And they were Safe: the Lords who must in state Lodge at the Crowne, because they mean't a King, Defray their Quarter at a Double Rate. Midnight had now brought Sleep vpon her wing To refresh Mortalls; for the Interlude Of Life is but Sweet in vicissitude. 85 Now, when all eyes were clos'd, all faculties In y? sleave-silke of Sleep soft-fettered Lay; When all y? Traytors, Sorceres, &amp; Spies; For such whose Nobler Labours challeng day In nightly Studies, wake but to their owne Calme Thoughts, &amp; let the Sleeping World alone. 86 When all was hush't, the Bayliffe of the Towne (Whose Lanthorn gaue a Light to all the Rest) Summons his Men; for was it euer knowne Such Magistrates to mince their Interests? Hee smell'd a Rat; &amp; all the Parish goes Not to attend his Mace, but waite his Nose. 87 May wee beleiue an Action (carryed By Noble heads, all as their owne designe,) Soe weakly wrought, as to be harryed A Fallacye in Biskitts &amp; Burn't Wine? A Man of Gutts &amp; Gowne, State Engineire! The Alderman has won his Fox-furre here. 88 This busie Zealot (Aldermen are still Caudle &amp; Custard, Spoonemeat, to the Mouth Of present Power) finding the Time suite well Vnto his purpose,—as a Man who loath, The stued Prunes of his former feast, might be Single Supporter of his Dignity. 89 Drawes vp his Men, now to Attach the Lords Weakly attended; (as he was aware) He takes them Napping; euery scæne affords Something Allusive, if wee tread it faire. Soe by the Commoners was this whole house Of Lords made vseles here &amp; Dangerous. 90 It fell in Surrey's Quarter, where hee Lay With Salisbury; Men (if not iniured In honour, by some Pens) of a weake clay, Vnapt for Conduct, poorly Spirited To personall attempts; yet giue them Right, Here they maintain'd a long &amp; hardy fight. 91 Excester &amp; Glocester, who ere this might know The danger they were in, &amp; over-power'd. (For the whole Bodie of the Towne was now In vproare) knew not how to be secur'd Without more force, or a Diversion Of Tumult, w?? might more Amaze the towne. 92 They fire it in a part. Now when the flame Spred in all Eyes,—a dreadfull Spectacle! The Townesmen more enrag'd, the Souldiers tame, Thought it Logh-Bell, for they could not tell But Harry's force had entered the Towne; 'Twas tooke for granted, &amp; away they run. 93 Excester now Amaz'd, w?? Glocester hast Vnto the Campe, to bring the Souldiers in; Where empty Trenches made them more agast; Of many thousands, hardly to be seene One Listed Face: if to depart &amp; Dye Bee One, This Night brought a Mortalitye. 94 When Zerxes (who knitt the devided Earth) Saw his Great Hoast, he wept to thinke how soone Of all those Numbers which Hee carryed forth Time would make wast; here Hee had seene it done, The worke of One Night. Soe a hundred yeare May stand in fate, as but a Night in feare. 95 Long did the fight in Surrey's Quarter hold; Till by encreasing Numbers now opprest, Hee, full of wounds, &amp; Salisburie (who would Not leaue his fortune) fell; be it exprest Vnto their Honour. If noe Hercules May Cope with two, these fought ten a peice. 96 Weary of Nine houres' fight, &amp; faint with wounds, To a fresh force, (for euery hower brought in Ayds to the towne,) Necessity Surrounds The Rest engaged, eyther now to win A Liberty, or Sell a Life as Deare As they could force it, or be Prisoner. 97 Wee read of none was slaine whose Qualitie Deserues a mention; only, after fight, The Little Life w?? might remaininge be In the two Cheife, extinguisht by the Spight Of the Rude Conquerours, whose Lawless hands Strike off the Heads, w?? for the Soveraigne stands. 98 The Rest were taken, &amp; soe Prisoner sent To Harry, where he Lay; the nobler Doome These suffer vnder, though the same event Was but to eyther; yet when Death must come, 'Tis somewhat to some minds, if the best breath Of Power then Ruleing doth pronounce their Death. 99 Now (like a Man whom dire disaster had Throwne wracke vpon a Coast of Canniballs) Excester shrinks, &amp; with a beating Head Through wayes vnbeaten rides; nothing prevailes To secure guilt; &amp; fear doth apprehend Figures of Danger, deeper then they tend. 100 Though Hee must certaine Suffer, yet the Mind, Full in the Vertue of a Glorious Cause, Glasses himselfe secure; &amp; cannot find Contempt enough for misenforcéd Lawes; Though from Instinctive Causes, &amp; the strict Impresse of Nature, none must Life neglect. 101 The horror of Imaginary Death Strikes deep w?? flesh; &amp; all Mortalitye Yernes at a Change; as were this Thing of Breath Worthy our being. 'Tis not Ill to Dye! A necessary Change, &amp; yet how oft Ere that, wee've suffer'd it, all haue not Thought. 102 Is not the Infant? (if wee soe may Speake Ready to Dye vnto his Mother's wombe, His world, the while, as wee this other make,) Troubled to leaue that Residence &amp; come To Changéd Ayre? or ere it come to That In its first Cause, relents to Generate. 103 The fire of Nature to perfection Moves in all Bodies, and the Act of Change Ripens his worke; 'tis somewhat yet vnknowne She has to doe; &amp; Death, though it Estrange Perhaps, the Notion of Identike vse, Quickens a better Ray of Light in vs. 104 From the Raw Mud of Earth, where none can tell His being, to a more refinéd Slime; Warmth beating in Another, where wee dwell Tennants, &amp; hold by Coppie out our time; Eiected thence, wee fill another farme, Soe dwell in wider feilds and live as warme. 105 Wee enter then on Trust; the Stock wee bring Hardly maintains soe Great a Husbandry; And wee might sterve vpon't, but that a Spring Breaths Life &amp; Profit there, Continually; But (still a crabbéd In-mate) wee are hurl'd From that soft Cabin, naked to the world. 106 The world! &amp; then, when wee enioy the sweet, Or what wee call the pleasures of a Life, The dreadfull cloud of Change will let vs see't, But ev'n by peices: Somewhat falls which if Wee cannot fathome then wee faint; as were What wee knew not, but only Things of feare. 107 The wise Chinenses (if some Errant Quills Informe aright) soe make their Porcelane; They giue it forme perhaps, &amp; somewhat els, But the Grave perfects it, as it must Man. These the Magnalia, w?? but some can find In Nature, Earth by Earth only Calcin'd. 108 Philosophy to seuerall Tempers suits The Obiect; Some make Death Irrelative Vnto our Natures; Some, dependent fruits: Some, make it th' End of Life; others to Live, But the first Step; and variously exprest, Each gives his Sence, but All account it Rest. 109 Then why, fond Man, dost thou defer that Peace? The Glory of thy being; though to be, Is in itselfe, Somewhat of happines, Thy worke is to improve felicitie; To make that Being firme, which being, here Is shooke w?? euery blast of Hope &amp; Feare. 110 Tost with his Passions, Excester revolves But what to doe to keepe a wretched Life; Forgets the Honour of his first Resolves: Armes to restore the King; a Cause (w?? if His feare had not Impair'd) gave warrantie To Live, &amp; might informe how to Dye. 111 His feares fall on him; Soudainly surpris'd, They Hurry Him to Death. Not place from fate Secures; &amp; Man his Torment but devis'd, T'avoid w?? Steps, what on each Step, doth waite. How Nobler had he dyed Requiting Rage To a Rude force! when Surrey did engage. 112 Glocester had tooke another way, &amp; fled To Bristoll; East and West, the Armes of feare: Lines Paralel w?? from one Centre Spread, Make the same Climate in each Hemispheare; And though, Perhaps, but an Imaginarie Draught in the Heauens, here their weight they carry. 113 Why trifle I? The King who suffer'd in Their Rash Attempt now calls away my Quill. When Royall Sorrows speake, wee haue not bin Slacke to Attend. This Comet which I still Would measure, thus Appear'd; &amp; Hee who takes Them truly distant, gives the Parallax. 114 This Action failing, lest another may Spring from its Ashes, the Vsurper Speeds His Tyrranny, to take the King away; An Act of Horror! when wee mention Deeds Branded to Infamie, wee but devide And sort those parcells, Summ'd in Regicide. 115 The King a Captive to the Tyrant's will, With deep reflections on his former State, Survayes himselfe, &amp; valewes nothing ill; All accidents are Equall in the Rate, Of Minds subdu'd; The Glories he had knowne, The Greifes he dwelt in, now appeare but One. 116 Here he had learn't the true Philosophye, To know Himselfe; the Resignation past Now, as an Act of Will, which formerly Was a fraile Passion; Soe may Man at last Correct himselfe. Hee who Contemnes the Power Of Tyrrannye, is more then Conquerour. 117 If the best Tempers, when they are Confin'd, As fixt in Orbe, Spread a Continued Ray, Thinke such a Temper, in a Prince's mind, How Glorious! As the wings of long-lost Day Breakes treble-Rampierd Clouds, Kings brighter in Their Vertues to the Astonisht world doe shine. 118 Soe hee appear'd; Pomfret (whose mighty walls Now Lye a heape of dirt, but lately seene A Garrison, t'avenge the funeralls Of this poore Kinge) soe little stood betweene. Him &amp; the world, as were it made the Glass Where Beames reflected, w?? more force might pass. 119 When now his cares were fled, (for this Restraint Enlarg'd his Soule to all the freedome which May be in flesh,) &amp; the Accomplishment Of all his thoughts were Circumscrib'd, a rich Treasure in his owne keeping; whose extent Fathom'd the world, yet in a Prison pent. 120 For Hee, a double Captive, to the Power Of Vsurpation, which hee valewed lest; The Iayle of flesh hindred his Spirits more Then that his Bodies; for a Soule possest With Glorious Obiects, when they fly beyond Our Eyes, haue wider Cages, yet Confin'd. 121 Freedome is but in Death,—when sordid Earth Falls to its Element, and Native fires Ascend vntroubled. Only This is worth The King's Expectancie. Not that desires Or Passions vncorrected, euer Nest One Moment; but a warfare is not Rest. 122 What strange Line shall I draw? what words t'affright, Cast in a Circle, and by powerfull Charme, Rayse Terror to all Eyes, when I recite The Murder of a King? another Harme Wee Spoke in words; but Syllables here start, As loath to Name it, least they beare a Part. 123 Yet soe much Pietie, or Caution, (For many things may pass vnder one Name) Was vs'd vnto the King; (whose Station They knew Illyable, to any frame Of Processe,) 'twas not as Iustice brought In open Court, but in his Chamber wrought. 124 For the dread Character Imprest on Kings, Indelible to Time or humane Power,— Villany, (yet it seems vnfledged) brings Noe Pattent of Pretence to view it ore; And makes that Charter void, (w?? Heauen had sign'd Sacred) by a rude Coppy Interlin'd. 125 Some Ages bring their Prodigie, Some Men Are form'd for Strange Attempts, some Minds are cast Full Bullett to the widest mouth of Sin; Dare blame the Sun, &amp; call the Starres ill-plac'd, As out of Distance; Men alone pursue (Vnder the Sun) Crimes to be calléd new. 126 How Richard fell, the various Reports Of many writing, make it seuerall; Some say that he was starv'd, &amp; all the sorts Of Plenty servéd in; This wee may call Beyond death; as if Wittye Tyrrannye Would make an Act confirme old fantasye. 127 Others would be offended should not I Bring in S? Peirce of Exton, with his Crue, And make a long fray of a Tragedie; The Stones were Standing might attest it True. With many Gashes, while the King did fight ('Till he killed foure) with him, &amp; other Eight. 128 These must not be omitted, did I write To please the gapeing Eare; but what I bring Is Zeale, Not fury to the Appetite Of others. Pardon, when I say the King Was Murder'd; yo? haue read it; This the Summe; Soe Monarchs murder'd meet a Martyrdome. 129 Here, as Astonisht in a Prince's fate, My Quill dropt from my fingers, &amp; I nigh Had ended; but the Glories I fix at, Broke through the mist of Murder'd Maiestie. Soe Spirits bound vp in the Ice of feare Are thawed by Nobler Passions shineing there. 130 And now the Starre of Conduct leads mee on, A Glorious Light, full-Spreading in my Eye; The way vnsmooth. Though vsurpation Tread the sharpe Pinnacles of Tyrrannye, 'Tis but to adde more Glory to Another: The fairest Child Sprung from the foulest Mother. 131 The King (for now wee doe not call him less, Richard is Dead, &amp; Hee, of the Male Line, Nearest in Blood) thinkes how he may depress The Recent Horror. Royall fates doe shine In death (at least) their Comets: Soe the Great Cæsar ascends a starre to wonder at. 132 Least weaker Eyes, (for many lookeing, some From Scintillations will contend a Raye,) Might vndertake to Iudge, he brings them home Better Instructed: &amp; the nearest way Hee makes the Noblest. Soe y? Eclipséd Sun, Drown'd in a Cloake, quash't Superstition. 133 When Minds, vnsettled yet in Government, Start from the End, but euery one his owne Proposes Iust, Safe, or Convenient; They All are melted in Diversion; And from a Newer obiect All take fire, Of Somewhat moveing glory or desire. 134 As would hee Swallow Scotland with a Mouth Of Power, he Threatens; or contract the Isle By Hieroglyphickes, &amp; vnmake North &amp; South, As void in Nature; as w?? little toyle Wee see it euident, in East &amp; West; Soe knit, his Action had it selfe exprest. 135 This wrought with many Men; &amp; they who sate, Dull sinners, wishing out their Little Ease, Strangely Impostum'd, in the Royall fate, Shrinke Empty Bladders. Soe old greifes may please, When strange tickling runs through tender flesh; Somewhat of Pleasure wee cannot express. 136 Richard lyes Cold, now in his Memorie As in his Ashes; &amp; the better Thought, W?? as Cheife Burthen, many Souls did carry, In this Streame washéd, as it had beene salt. They Mules soe laden; and the Empty Sacke, Trotts to Returne, chargéd with a Packe. 137 Thus may a Greasie Blue-Cap cheat vs from Our Principles in Loyaltie. 'Twas strange For English Men to sell the Martyrdome Of their Late King to such a low exchange. But the wise Scotts emprou'd; their returnes bring Home treble profitts,—sell their Liveing Kinge. 138 This Face of Action drew all eyes away From better Obiects. Of their Loyaltie Harry has gott his End; 'tis not the prey Hee hopes from Scotland. Soe may Arabie, Vnconquer'd, boast her Desarts &amp; contemne The Power of Ottoman to vanquish them. 139 Soe may Thessalia, Tempe's Liveing Shades, Envy the still Snow-Couer'd Rhodope; The World's best Garden, full in Corne &amp; Meads, Glory in Thistles for varietie. England, another Eden; Hee who tryes T'enlarge it, makes a World of Paradice. 140 'Tis a brave Costly Rant, th' Hesperian King Vtters with many Titles. Still the Sun, W?? but his Howers to euery place doth bring, Is Resident in his Dominion, And thus Suggests some Approbation To vnder-Rate God's Blessing to this Sun. 141 How little Either ours, in the Acquist Of Scotland, Harrie knew, who did not seeke Vnprofitable Conquests, but exprest A Power to doe; &amp; busyed all the weake But iniur'd Party. Alcibiades Mangles his Dog to Manage what he please. 142 But Harrie need not force a Warre, as were A Pleurisie soe threatning in his State; The Veine is open'd; Wales the Surgeon here, Ere he could wish, falls in. If blood abate The Maladie, &amp; make the Spirits pure They'l loose their labour, but they'le win the Cure. 143 Wales, (who not long vnder the English Yoake Had been) a heavy Enimie of Old, The Maine-Cord Slipt, Imagin'd the Teem broke, And their Necks free; hence Brittains are nam'd bold. For the least Defection in our State They frame their Libertie, &amp; run to That. 144 One, not of Noble Blood, (if it may passe W?? out disparagement to Brittish Blood, Who are all Gentlemen, &amp; soe hee was In his full Title,) for a Prince now stood; And though perhaps his Pedigree should faile To the due Line, his cunning might preuaile. 145 Glendower, a Man whom English breeding had Polish't to better forme, yet the same Stone; Hee knew more then his Countrey, &amp; Hee made Them thinke Hee knew more then hee yet had knowne. For Wiser People haue beene led to more, By weaker heads, then They were by Glendower. 146 A Subtle fellow, Studied in the Law, (Which setts off Learning best to vulgar Heads,) Bold to his practise, yet could smoothly draw His Language to Invite men, where it needs; Fierce &amp; Ambitious, drawes his Cambrian flocks To English feilds, from Merioneth Rocks. 147 Soe (when the Knot of Rome's Gown'd Libertie Began to fret,) the Mad-Brain'd Spartacus Meant his best prize,—a Montainer was Hee, In Roman Riots growne Seditious; Nor was't the Easiest worke their Senate had To beate this Rebel fencer from his Trade. 148 This while the Earle of March (declaréd Heire In Richard's Reigne, if he dyed Issules) Retir'd from Court; as being well aware The Cloud was knitt of Harrie's Iealousies, Vpon his double Titles. How vnsure The Blood of Princes Stands, vnto the Power! 149 Hee, (who but Neighbour'd Glendower) lest the Rage Which threatned near, might ruine him at home, Summons the Country; soe concern'd to engage Against the C?minge Torrent, ere it Come Vpon their Thresholds; then too late to force Its current backe from a continued course. 150 But Richard's fate not in Himselfe expir'd; His Heir must Suffer; Miserie entayl'd; 'Twas but the portion destiny conferr'd, To Mortimer, who though he be not call'd King, as the Heir to Richard, yet in Care Hee was Successor;—to his Sorrowes—Heire. 151 As from the banks of Strymon, Cranes are seene, Embattail'd in stronge Files, to make their way; Soe move the Welch, in Conduct, through the Thin Disordered Troopes of Mortimer, that Day. For Tennants fighting, to a Souldier's Sword, Will owne but Captaine, Each his proper Lord. 152 And though, to giue a due to Mortimer, Hee stood the Shocke, &amp; Singly bold, did peirce His Enemye, as the Welch Phalanx were But All one Champion; Hee his owne appears. This Many-handed bodie moe hands Lost Then Hee who Menacéd the Gods could boast. 153 Yet what he did was bootles, though hee did More then a Man, against a Multitude. They wind him round; Soe many Ivyes Spread A Thousand formes vpon an Oake Subdued; And catch his mighty Armes w?? growing Chains: Mortimer soe is tooke &amp; soe Remaines. 154 A Captive now to the Insulting Pride Of Glendower, in his Conquest Insolent; Who now thought Harry, &amp; the world beside, Soe many Lords, whose Homage was but lent. Till summoned by his Sword to giue account, And must acknowledge Him their Paramount. 155 Soe Small Successes make the Welch men vant Hereditary Arrogance, as Hee Whose little wealth is but the next to want, Or be it that a Gentleman hee'le be; And Owen now, an English Lord thus Quell'd, Reads double what his Horoscope might yeild. 156 For though the flatt'ring Scheme w?? he had drawne Might invite the Attempts, within his fate Secur'd; &amp; now some Aspects his faith bring on That Man was not all Made, but must Create Somewhat to his owne Being; yet hee saw But halfe was Spoken, or but halfe did draw. 157 Mortimer, thus Condemn'd by fate, perhaps Befreinded, (for who can vntwine her Thred?) Repreiv'd from Harry's hand; for Noe Man Scapes Who has Relation to the Royall Head; Hee nearest; how more certaine, had he beene Cutt short, whose only Title came betweene? 158 Hee Safe in Wales, that is, in Prison sure, Glendower, now vnoppos'd, makes but one wast Of the whole Frontier, lest a second Power Might in fatt Quarters be too near him plac't. Some mak't his Policye; but many Thought, 'Twas but the Plunder, for itselfe, hee fought. 159 The King (not to enlarge,) as may be thought Imprison'd Mortimer; but to reuenge What might concerne himselfe, an Army brought Against proud Glendower. May wee thinke it strange If such a Leader, w?? soe great a Power, Lost more then Labour, to Invade Glendower? 160 What might it be, the Learninge of that Age, (As yet some cannot flutter 'boue the Perch,) Accounted it a Magicke; &amp; the Sage Span of a Circle tooke the Starres at Lurch, To Conspire Storme; &amp; made the Pleiades But as a Spunge for Glendower's hand to Squeeze. 161 For Learnéd 'bove the Common Ranke of Men, Incurrs the Common censure,—too much Learn'd; Hee was a Sorcerer. To draw a Pin Thorow a Canvas Cloth, some Men haue Earn'd As high a Title. Three small bookes sett vp, And Compasses, make a whole Coniurer's Shop. 162 Truth is (fraught w?? some Rudiments of Art And strooke with fangle of his Countriman, The boasted Merlin,) Hee would Challenge for 't, With noe small Glorie; and the Welch who ran Admiring All Things; was beyond their Growth; For ought I know might make 'em Witches both. 163 Howeuer, at this Time, soe great a Storme Fell in the English Quarter, and the March Over the Mountaines to secure Him from The King's Intentions, by a further Search; That Harrie, with his Army, forc'd retreat, And some beleiu'd Glendower had wrought the feat. 164 Soe may wee purchase any wind wee please (If Navigators doe not please Themselves To abuse those who never crost the Seas,) From Lapland Woemen; or perhaps those Elves Abuse them rather, hauing gain'd Beleife, And Knot their Hearts in their owne Handkercheife. 165 While here the King brought of his toyléd troopes, Other Successes seeme to ballance out His fortune; the Invading Douglas Stoops To his Leiutennant, &amp; the Power he brought, Ruin'd by Noble Percye; to whose Fame From former Cause they'de giue another Name. 166 These, (who had past the Tweed and peirc'd to Tine, With a huge Spoyle) were now vpon retreate; Northumberland, aggreivéd to Suffer in The Affront, his Country &amp; his Name might get, Should they Returne with such an Easie Prey, W?? a strong Power doth Interpose their way. 167 When the Enragéd Douglas, (for the Powers Were now engag'd) Saw from the English Bowes, Such Clouds of Arrowes fall, in killing Showers, Vpon his Men, as Bold as Glorious. Maugre the feather'd Storme, he leads his band To nigher danger, w?? erected Hand. 168 As when the Blew-Eyed Pallas had Inspir'd A treble Spirit into sterne Diomed And Dardan Troops, to his sole force retir'd, The Dowglas cutt his way; our Archers fled, And at this once, what Parthian doth but boast, Was practis'd strangely, in the English Hoast. 169 Feirce was the fight, till now the Cheifes were mett,— The Hardie Douglas, w?? that Soule of fire, Brave Percye; now the strange confuséd heat Of Battle Spreadeth into Combats higher; Th' Example Gallant through the Army ran, They fought now, foot to foot, &amp; Man to Man. 170 Till the vnequall odds w?? fortune gave The English, to reward a well-vs'd force, Now rush'd on heaps. Soe a feirce-beating wave Throwes downe opposeing Earth might stop his Course; At length, when Victorie secures his way, Sweeps his wrought Channel as his Native Bay. 171 The English, more at Ease, with double Blowes, Fall in, &amp; breake through falling Enimies. Dunbar, whose Courage all that day pursues His Countrimen, for former Enmities 'Twixt him &amp; Douglas, haueing spent his rage In many Deaths, the Douglas doth engage. 172 Who when the Torrent broke, had parted fight From Percy; &amp; the wonders of his Arme Imparted all about, as they might light,— Assuréd Death; They met now, equall warme, In many slaughters; &amp; w?? equall Spight Were glad they might at last together fight. 173 But had not many hands, who now came in Vpon the Douglas, &amp; his wrath enforc't To the Devided Iniurye, 't had bin Dunbar's assuréd fate, by Numbers thrust From any single force; hee seekes reuenge Vpon them All, &amp; over-bid the Change. 174 Haueing now made a way, that Hee could Breath Once more, &amp; looking round w?? the Eye, left, As had he swum a Sea of blood; hee seeth Him selfe alone,—of all his freinds bereft; Surrounded with his Enemies, who stood Rocks to his Ruine, hauing stop'd this flood. 175 And not Sertorius, nor the faméd Names Monocular, with greater Right doe weare The Honour of the Losse, to enrich their fames, Then the Sterne Scott; Portable Trophies are More glorious then Their Penons, lofty hung, T'adorne a Hall, or Crowns, or Armours Stronge. 176 Hee, full in wounds, &amp; yet all-feather'd ore, As the first fury of the Day, had Spred His Armes, Like Scæva stood; or be it more Honour, like Scæva now, he singly Spred To the whole warre; till by encloseing Troopes, Encreasing Courage, in its progress stops. 177 Fast mur'd in throng of Enimies, his Arme, Cunning to Kill, dissabled w?? the press, Pineon'd in Numbers to doe further harme, But struggles; soe a Lion when he Sees Himselfe Caught in a toyle &amp; round beset W?? bloody Iawes threatens the Iron Nett. 178 Those, who Afraid, his terror-strikeing looke Had shunn'd through all the fight, as certaine Death, Hemme nearest in; Thus was the Douglas tooke By basest force; whose Eye yet Threatneth, And w?? a braue disdaine &amp; Rage Commixt Yet beares himselfe to all his Glories fixt. 179 When a leud hand (for 'tis the saddest fate Of War to fall in Power of Coward hands) With an vnmanly blow, his Life did threat; The Noble Percy, coming in, C?mands The Villaine Dye, &amp; takes the Prisoner From rude affronts of the base Souldier. 180 A Thousand Names of Honour crowne that head Whose Equall Courage knew the Noblest way To vse an Enimye; this Glorye Spred More lustre on his Helme then all that Day, His Nobler Actions; &amp; the Scottish Blood Soe sav'd, more then the Spilt, his Trophy stood. 181 This was that Hottspurre, whose Illustrious Name Adornes the memory of what wee call Noble; &amp; Greater Titles, by his Fame, Then Birth setts vnder; though the Douglas shall Live high in honour, 'tis not his least Fame Which this Day brought to stand by Percyes' Name. 182 Hee, more then Haniball, not only gott A Victorie, but knowes to vse it too; At lest, to his owne purpose. Now the Scott Was made a freind; Humanitie can doe Wonders, and, to a Noble Nature, stands More Powerfull Conquest then a Thousand hands. 183 Besides the Douglas, Morduke, Earle of Fife, Angus, &amp; Murrey, many Titled names Of Scotland, Prisoners were; that wee may giue This victorie, more ample in the Streames Of Noble Blood, yet beating in the veine, Then in the floods of many Equall Slaine. 184 The King demands these Scottish prisoners; Percy, release of Mortimer. When fate Intends her worke, she the next meane preferrs; And eyther ask'd what, if wee safely weigh't, Neither might grant. Noe party in a State Supplants the Interest they endeauour at. 185 It cannot hang, when competition is In any state; Royaltie will admit, Noe Rivall; &amp; the Guilt of Iealousies Prepares Inferiour Mindes (if they may fitt Resistances) to recapitulate Their Actions, Advantages of State. 186 'Twas now, not to enlarge his Cozen March: The Cypresse showes the liveing face too plaine. Strong vizards but secure, when wee enlarge Our Riots questionable, vnder paine Of forfeit Life; Soe Pocket-Beards elude Vn-wary Eyes of the feirce Multitude. 187 The treble Masque of Reformation, Liberty, rendred pleasant in the word; Tyrranny, taxéd in the vsurpation; And little Glimpses of another Lord, Whose fancied Rule, like tasted Manna, might Suite with full Rellish, euery Appetite. 188 His freinds were strong, &amp; these Suggestions Made the enclineing Commons, All his freinds. Some propositions satisfie all Questions Which they can vrge. One obiect fitts All Ends. Soe, in some higher treadings, Though wee move Crosse, wee may meet in Anger or in Love. 189 The King, whose little Quiet taught him now To see his purchase in Ambition, Too ouer-bought. Wee, in distresses know, But how to value Man's condition, In any step of Fortune. Now he finds How little sure Treason a Traytor binds. 190 For here the hands who help'd him to his State, Northumberland &amp; all the strength he brought, His brother Worcester, a Confederate In Richard's ruine, as hee had done nought Worthy the Name of Percy, to enforce The former Service, brings this second Course. 191 Hee to his Nephew (heated now in Rage) Suggests new matter, apt to make him fire;— Doubly encites him by his blood &amp; Age. Ill counsells carry weight, in the Attire Of faded haires, Discretion's Liverye; The Priviledge of Coats Instructs the Eye. 192 Soe when a Naturall Motley makes a Hood, Vnto a Man, wee attribute him wise, At least apparell'd to be vnderstood Within that Notion. Nature's busines lyes In Œconomicks; &amp; her silver lace Some flourish in, who fitt another place. 193 But Worcester wore it worthy, &amp; was knowne A prudent Manager of high Affaires; Seems most relenting to what had beene done; Taxing his owne, informs his Nephew's yeares, To vndertake Redress; as making good One Active Veine, t'envigour all y? blood. 194 'Twas now but to repaire the late offence To Richard, whom he seemeth to deplore; Cunning, well carried, is called Conscience; It past in Him, now seeming to abhorre Himselfe, as Instrument in Harrye's fate, Contingents more apparent in a state. 195 Nephew, 'tis not vnknowne vnto the world, (But (ah) the Burthen presseth nearest home, Thus he begins) how Richard's fame was hurl'd, Eu'n while a King; how that advantage, some Haue vs'd, wee all may see; but (w?? sad hearts) Your ffather &amp; My selfe beare the Cheife Parts. 196 'Tis true, (w?? horror I may let yo? know The Secret,) Wee (who wrought in Richard's Ease To what wee could expect, or Hee bestow, In Honour or Employment,) sought to please The faction, lay aloofe; &amp; yet retaine Court seruice, safe to both, to neither playne. 197 My Brother, (whose great Name had fill'd the North With Title to his Large Inheritance) They would not sift too neare; if he came forth, By starts, the Party thought he did advance Their working; &amp; were glad to see an Eye Of Treason in a Face of Loyaltie. 198 'Twere long to tell yo? all, but when the King (Hee who was King, My Master, oh! that thought My Soule's Affliction!) did the great Act bring, (The Act which makes our Actings vile &amp; nought) The Act where Mortimer declaréd stood Successour to the King, as next in Blood. 199 Wee swore (but where the Villany of Man Suggests Ambition, what boots an Oath?) Allegiance to Himselfe, &amp; to maintaine That Title! Pardon God! how forfeit both! And happy yo? (whose years can hardly reach The Guilt,) may live to solder vp the Breach. 200 And though (as things now stand,) 'twere ill advis'd To open out the Chaine of our Intent,— But some short threds of vse will be more priz'd, Wrap'd 'bout the well-form'd Card of Government. That's the Gay Bottome, w?? on any side Has a full forme of All, howeuer Eyed. 201 Yet if I may advise,—but yo?, concern'd, Perhaps prevent what I but meane to say, Nor need I teach your Spirit;—wee haue learn'd Too late now to be Loyall; if a Day May over-run Repentance; but if Time Yet be, 'tis offer'd now to purge our Crime. 202 'Tis true, your Action as the priuate wrong Done to your selfe, may lead your Spirit on, But let that Sleepe your owne; designes, when young, Well managed, receiue proportion From what the Actors may in Prudence giue; Yours, yet but young, may any forme receiue. 203 To make it comely in the People's Eies, (The People, who vnsetled yet remaine And may be led by Plausibilities) Vrge Common Interest, for that shall gaine A Partye sure; &amp; when yo? haue them fast, Insinuate nearer Things vnto their Tast. 204 For a loud Clangor Startles in Surprise, And from Soft notes, still reaching Accents may Perswade the Sence with Pleasure, though it rise Beyond all moode. Discretion treads the way To thriveing Courage; open breasts Surcharge The Auditors, &amp; some restraints enlarge. 205 But, my brave Nephew, I oppress that Spirit Which moves beyond an Old Man's faint advice. You, who I hope, may worthily Inherit That Honour which a Bed-rid Pattent Lyes Vnto your ffather &amp; my selfe; for shame Lives but to Persons, Honour to the Name. 206 And 'twas but Time for Worcester here to End: Old Men, with many Precepts speake their Age; Roveing, vnsteddy doctrines, which attend Ennervéd Minds; &amp; by a near presage Of Ruine in themselues, from spirits weake, Extend their doubts to all they vndertake. 207 The Noble Percy, who in a short draught, Had summ'd his vnckle, what he spoke or meant; Told him, hee had inform'd his younger thought, Hee saw the Action, but the full event Was layd out to him, in the well-drawne Schœme Of his Advices, hee observing them. 208 Northumberland, who knew the frame of All, Kept in the North. If now his Son Succeed, His Strength assures the Conquest; if hee fall, 'Twas his owne Act; or should the Question spread Nearer, he has another Day, for yet His force stood the reserve, to both Ends fitt. 209 Him, less engag'd, wee leaue; &amp; now draw vp Our Numbers to the Rendezvous. The fame Of this great Action, &amp; the Actor's hope, Draw many in; the Cause some, some the Name Mov'd; as if Percy were a Charater Proofe to the many accidents of warre. 210 What the King had denyed, w?? out his ayde Is wrought out at his Cost; for Mortimer Marryes w?? Glendower's daughter. Better had Harry enfranchis'd him, then bring a Warre Of such a Chaine; for Hee who formerly Liv'd as a subiect stands his Enimie. 211 His Name &amp; Blood encouragéd the Power Which others brought; for 'twas in Memorye; And wearied Minds are willing to restore Occasions, when they offer Libertye. Soe euery tongue now cryes vp Mortimer, Nearest in Blood, &amp; once declaréd Heire. 212 Those who had gone along, when Harry first Came in,—full Throates and voluntary hands To prompt Ambition; the same smoke w?? burst In Richard's face, now Harrie's breath withstands. The Giddy vapour of tumultuous Minds Is but a Smoake Lyable to all winds. 213 As big-mouth'd Æolus, where hee Commands The Clouds to Scudde before his Ministers, Yet manages the Reine in his owne hands, The Percyes floate the Kingdome. Soe appeares Alternate Day, to eyther Hemisphere, As they would Spread the Royall Sun out here. 214 When Richard raign'd, how farr vnfitt for Rule Was such a Prince! now Harry had the sway, 'Twas alike bad, a Tyrant or a Foole; While they Act both; and 'tis but to this Day A standing Crime; what men impute a trouble Vpon themselues, is by them acted Double. 215 The Gallant Percye, (frustrate by the King To ioyne w?? Glendower's much-encreaséd band) Must try it with the force Himselfe did bring, His owne Relations, in his owne Command. How had he now in Glory higher stood, If but Success had made the Action good. 216 Yet ere he thought, (or ere he would haue thought The King soe neare) a shrill alarum beats, And he was forc'd to what Himselfe had sought, But prudent Harry makes a halt, &amp; threats Like to a King; who, if his offers might Engage, was better pleas'd, if not, would fight. 217 Worcester was sent to Treat; but he, who thought His guilt vnsafe, returnes the Articles Of Grace, (to aggravate what he first taught) His owne made story; as his Iealousies Suggested to his Crime; &amp; might enflame His Nephew's Courage w?? Reuenge or Shame. 218 The Percye Hott, (for 'twas a high contempt His vnckle brought) calls vp his willing Men, Instructed in the Royall Complement (Ill told,) &amp; bids defiance back agen; Worcester to blame! but many crimes invent, In the pursuite, their surer punishment. 219 Now Harry, who had thought his offers might Have satisfied their Honours &amp; their Aymes, (Without a greater Treason,) thought the fight Was over to his wish. When the Extreames Are but once found, the Long hand of a Prince May span it, to his owne Convenience. 220 When to prevent his expectation, In the returne, ere well it could be brought, The haughty Dowglas, with his hardy Nation, Made on a Chardge; Hee gave the first assault; And now they ioyne Entire; the well dispos'd Squadrons of each Charge, equally oppos'd. 221 Had yo? beheld the fury of that day, T'vndoe the fiction of all former time! Not single, in the Cheifs; all hands convey Their Rage with wonder, to astonish him Who Read in Romants, boasts the faméd Knight: Iust Historie is a Romance well writt. 222 The Equall Armes in this contending fray, Where euery Man, the Giant or the Knight, His honour, or his Interest! Soe you may Vnderstand Spel-Sprung Castles; &amp; but right To the Intention, if yo? haue the Key: Fled Walls discover where the Dragon lay. 223 Nor let it dull the more Iudicious That I bring trifles into Nobles Things; The growth of fancy left it vnto vs, What Heroes should Act; if my verse brings Men acting greater, I haue done more right To those did Fancy, and to those did fight. 224 The One-Eyed Scott, (as were he all one Eye) To find an obiect worthy of his Arme, Breakes through impaleing Swords, &amp; beats them by, In weaker hands; soe cutting through a Swarme Of Gnatts, an Eagle scoureing after Prey, Beats downe the weak-wing'd vermin in her way. 225 Thrice through the Battaile he did force his way, And many soules payed homage to his Sword; Three like the King were habited that Day; Those three he slew; in the mistake more Spurr'd To meet the King; that soe his sword might flye Hatch't in Blood Royall, certaine Victorye. 226 The Noble Percy now had cutt a Street And Pav'd it, as one Act; the Bodies Slaine Made a high Causeway, &amp; his Courser's feet Dropt Humane blood,—A Centaure Dy'd in Graine; As wiser then Rude Peasants might haue guest A Man soe Shell'd in Blood vnto his Beast. 227 With mighty Wrist he rages through the feild, And many deaths Imparted as they stood. How many Names fell to enrich his Sheild, Writt in the Capitalls of their owne Blood? As had he meant a worke 'bove Nature's power, To make his Crescent Orbéd in an Hower. 228 As when a storme beats in a Thick-sett wood, The bending Oakes retire; the stronger fall, Resisting the wild Arme of that full Cloud; And All, the Tempest-wrapt, not One of All Can be secure; but w?? declineing Head, Shrinkes from that Cloud, w?? once it threatened. 229 Soe Harry's hoast fell back, and Victorye Made a faint Stoopeing; as she would haue meant A Royall Quarrye, but deceiues the Eye; And with a Cancilleere, knowing the strength Of her owne Wing, but wantons; till she fetch Her Chozen Prey (Eye-charméd) in at stretch. 230 The heat of Battaile had laid many cold, And some yet standing to as little vse, Dismai'd, their late Acquaintances behold One with the Earth; they less, while poreing thus; A Civill Enimie prevents his Dreame, And wakens Him, in Death, to Equall Them. 231 The prudent King (resembling Ithacus In Parts &amp; Person, now his fortune shar'd,) Resolves to end it, by a Glorious Returne; &amp; Rallies vp a force impair'd, But a knit Strength. Soe on Sigæan Plaine, Vlisses reinforc'd the fight againe. 232 The scatter'd Troopes draws vp a well-made front, And willing Minds, from selfe-taught discipline, Fill necessary Rankes; for noe Account Of Muster makes an Army stand soe fine, As Men inspir'd with Duty to their need; A Corporall of most hast &amp; oft best Speed. 233 The Prince, whose Virgin Gantlet was vnstain'd With blood before that Day, was better gilt Then its first Trimminge; &amp; became the Hand An Omen to his Glorie; when the spilt Best blood of France, his better shall advance, Worthy to Cutt the Salique Knott of France. 234 Like a young Eagle summ'd, (whose Spirit infus'd Blood Royall of the Ayerie Monarchie) Disdaines a shoale of Dawes; but rather Chus'd From great Instinct, at Arméd Cranes to flye; Or trusse a farr-seen Swan, whose mighty wing Wounds the rent Ayre, &amp; frets her vnseene string. 235 Soe flyes the Prince; where greatest danger stood Of Noblest Enimies, might most provoke, His Courage bears him; fortune seeming proud Of her strong Champion, warrants euery stroke; Yet were the Question put, through his whole fate Fortune vpon his Vertue did but waite. 236 Thus while he rides, as had Tydides' Squire Surviu'd soe many Ages, to this fight, Rememb'ring Venus once, in warrlike 'tire, Stay'd wounded by his Master; thought she might Againe take Armes; for soe he might haue guest By Harrie's Face, his Actions, Mars exprest. 237 And from a Curséd Bow, with willing hand, He sends a Shaft, w?? in the Prince's Cheeke A dreadfull wound inflicted; Anger stain'd, The other Equall Red; soe farr vnlike The face he seem'd; for wounds weake Spirits asswage; Great Soules by loss of Blood increase their Rage. 238 Through all opposing Dangers now he breaks, Inspir'd w?? his late wound to greater things; Soe Men excell themselves; noe patterne Speaks His Actions now; though Kings may Image Kings, Hee taught Himselfe; out-did all boast of Time; And Princes striveing can but coppie Him. 239 His conduct (as the Ballance had but layd Vpon his Arme) now over-rul'd the Scale; And Percye's pressing Troopes retire dismai'd, As had a heauen-sent Legion peirc't them all With wings of Thunder; vseless Spent on those Who (cunninge to resist,) did not oppose. 240 For yeilding Bodies only are secure; In the wild flame, the feare-taught Politicks Evade the Force, by yeilding to the Power: While Rockes are torne. Men whose great Spirits fixe Them, Cent'red all to Danger, overprest, Instructing horrors fall before the Rest. 241 In this Concussion (where a Thousand Hands Wrought but one worke,) the Glorious Percy fell; Whose Death (Glory to none) but only stands The Ruine of the Day. 'Twas not the will Of fate, a single opposite should boast Soe loud a Conquest; for Hee Stood His Hoast. 242 And now an Easie victory Ensues; The Captaine Slaine, the Souldiers all disperse; Warr-faméd Douglas, the same fate pursues, As when a foe to Percy. Noe averse Faces in destiny; the Accident Runs through All Actions with the Instrument. 243 Thus, with the Losse of many noble Names, The King enioyes the Day. In Civill Warre One certaine fate attends the Diverse frame Of Action, &amp; ev'n Victors not appeare Deserving Triumph; Check't by Little Seeds Of Nature; wounded when his Countrey bleeds. 244 With Douglas, Worcester, (he who forfeited His honour twice, in trust to seuerall Kings) Is taken; and the Mort-gage of his Head Prevents whatever new occasion Springs In Nature, as Ennervant to that Name; Progressive Treasons vnder any Claime. 245 This while Northumberland (who slack'd, the while His Son &amp; Brother with ill Speed went on,) Was early Marching; &amp; the fruitles toyle Of faire pretence, void in Occasion, Baffles his Policye; a mid-way Post From many mouthes, his strange Intention crost, 246 As had he meant to neither. When hee saw An Interception by a Double Power New-raiséd, hee retires; in Rere they draw Close to his Heeles, &amp; follow him the more, The more he flyes. Soe, if wee soe may Speake, The more seene Kidds tread in Aurigae's Backe. 247 Till now (if Northerne Constellations may Have Rest) Hee over-went, or fixt himselfe From their Light feet secure, &amp; they may play Now a step further w?? the Beare or Whelpe; Or friske beyond them, to the Rocky Pole, Where Cepheus, with his foot doth the Axis Rolle. 248 Northumberland, who like a Spring-taught Snayle Was crauling to haue Nibbled the fresh leafe, Found the Aire raw, &amp; shrinkes into his Shell: Nature &amp; Industrye but make things safe In proper Accidents; for noe retreat Secures, when stronger weaker Causes threat. 249 The King commands him, from his Strength. Hee knew His Strength was weake vnto the Royall Arme; And therfore comes, attended w?? a few, As nere intending, nor now dreading harme. For Treasons, overblowne, So cleare offence Naked, they pass for highest Innocence. 250 He goes preparéd to the certaine frowne Of Maiestie, &amp; met it. Hee whose guilt Curbes Acting further, prompts occasion, And frames new Passions; which he neuer felt Till Nature's Rivall, dire Necessitie, Appeare the Same; &amp; is, perhaps, but Shee. 251 Northumberland attaint, after a while, Vpon Submission, was againe restor'd; A Policy t'emprove, w?? the less toyle, The Royall Interest, if Time afford Advantages, &amp; Men may see the When To fitt Occasions;—Harrie saw it Then. 252 Hee knew his Claime, and how vnsure he sate Midst many enimies; and his first freind Engag'd more strongly freind; if once growne hate May to all Natures Reconcilement find, In overspreading favours. Oft a shade Preserves that Canker, shall its boughs invade. 253 The French (who saw the Kingdome in a Flame Like ill-will'd Neighbours, glad to see it rise,) Thought then a Time for Spoile but Spoile became; And found a Ruine where they meant a Prize. Their Iuno was a Cloud, &amp; what remains Now but the Wheele? Torture is what Constrains. 254 And now their haughty Necks run in the wheele W?? the Rude Commons shall impose; a Plague I wonder never yet was taught in Hell. Not Vultures gnawinge, nor the Grisly Hagge, With knotted Scorpions; nor what fancy yet Has rais'd of Torment, smarts soe ill as it. 255 When Noble Nature, (in the Comely Dresse Of Education, Shines) to Challenge Man, Shall fall a Slave to Beasts; for Men are less Without that Character; the Seale but can Confirme the Pattent; Hee that doth deny it, Though he may argue 't, would be loath to try it. 256 Whoe (for noe Action distinguishable Where Man is made the Subiect, one whole Peice Of Nature) but approves the Affable Deportment of his Equall? When he sees Those Ornaments now trode on by the Rude, But feeles himselfe wounded in what he view'd. 257 Where can I find the better Nation Of Man? (for in all Climes there are but two, Civill &amp; Barbarous,) Noe Emulation Strikes mee; as were the Frenchmen, (whom we doe Admire &amp; Imitate in follyes,) not A written Text for better Pens to Quote. 258 There may we find w?? out the fangle which Fires the drye touch of Constitution) Civility vnstrayn'd, w?? our the Itch Of Glory; &amp; not there; but the Conclusion To what I meant, is, noe disparagement Comes with the Clime; Man one, Indifferent. 259 Though Nationall Aspersions trouble some To challenge, whose owne Individuall May Quarter Vices to each severall Roome, And be Meridian vnto One &amp; All; Guilty Himselfe, to all his observation, The Little World thus Circumscribes a Nation. 260 As were hee more then the Great world he treads, Hee brings her to the Cubit of his Skill; And drawes rash Lines from the vncertaine heads Of what he Thought, to make her good or Ill; Gives the Provinciall Genius, &amp; can frame Her guilt, from his owne figure to its Name. 261 Imagine now, (in the Aspersion Or as they were) yo? see the Frenchmen led By a rude Crue; &amp; while you please yo? owne Thoughts, to their Sufferings, let my Anger Spread Vnto the Peasants; thus when Passions rise Wee find our selves, Each as the humour Lyes. 262 Last day I heard it vrg'd, (&amp; 'tis but what May be evasion vnto Everie Day, When Ignorance pleads Guilty,) for a late Doctrine disputed; (haueing small to say Vpon the Argument) Bookes but Confound Men; who themselves are Bookes, more to be Conn'd. 263 'Tis true; but Hee, whose Lethargie of Mind Is loath to Search what Men haue done or said, Smiles, but as feathers floating in the wind, And dreames his Knowledge; or is rather Dead And fears to be remov'd from the great Shelfe Of Error, by vnclasping of Himselfe. 264 The wise Man has an vnsumm'd Librarye; Himselfe &amp; Man, &amp; Bookes, are all his Bookes; As Leaves was Paper first, all Leaves Supply Him w?? writ Pages, which he Spells who lookes Backe to the Alphabet, &amp; then can bring His Learning vpward, from the word to th' Thing. 265 Thus wee know Passions, when wee bring them Home A Well-bought Treasure from his Vatican; Whose Volumes Numberless Nature doth Summe In one Compendious Abstract; Well-bound Man! This is the Enchiridion, w?? to Chuse, Wee all would carry, but a few can vse. 266 If yo? are furnisht yo? are fully learn'd, And Bookes &amp; Men are but as other Things; Philosophie your Slave; &amp; Truth discern'd, (W?? nor your Reason nor opinion brings) Essentially cleare; for wee haue Clad Her w?? our Raggs, all Patch't &amp; overlay'd. 267 This, (if there be a Truth, as nothing else Can frustrate Argument, and wee deny Our being to dissent,) what ever feeles Decay must Live; as from Eternity She Sprung, &amp; cannot to dimensions fall; Essence &amp; Truth are one, which one is All. 268 Those Frenchmen, by lewd hands were now led on, A Present to the King, as their owne Act; What Royaltie has restitution To Mouthéd Peasants? Soe may Hounds well-pack't Pursue the Prey; &amp; soe the Master please Those Currs with Quarrye, as the King may These. 269 Yet, what might want (for the sav'd Quarry fell, A Dish to the King's board,) least they might grin After the Paunch devided; (as a Deale Too short in what they run,) Hee calls 'em in W?? Iybbet, w?? the Kennel now enflames And claps the better Runners by their Names. 270 Whilst these triumph, their Neighbours feele the rage Of Glendower; who had strucke the Marches through, And made one wast, not Spareing Sex, nor Age; Yet 'twas noe more then what he first did Doe, Within himselfe. Where Humane is defac'd, Man, bankrupt, only doth enlarge the Wast. 271 Ambition (whose huge walls in Sand are laid) Threatens the Life of Him who keeps within; Yet Man, (whose folly is but oversway'd In fate) keeps tennant; passing not a Pin, His Ruine Imminent, (soe he may keepe Her painted Lobbies) till they Lye one Heape. 272 The King (who in this Purchase had layd out His better fortune) could haue beene well-pleas'd To quitt, if a Rue bargaine may be put In state; &amp; any foot w?? must be rais'd In Royalty, were Safe, &amp; not fore-right, Hee would retire; here Standing is Retreate. 273 And now hee sees the Error of his Choice; Hee (who sate praised in his Orbe, &amp; Light,) Ambitious of the Pole, has got moe Eyes But w?? less ease; as were the Sphere of Sight But the more honour; &amp; Greate Perseus sate Below Böötes, being Constellate. 274 Harry surrounded; for where Royaltie Has all its Title from vsurper Power, 'Tis a wild Precipice vnto the Eye Of Conscience, where the Gulph yawnes to devour; As had he but attain'd that dangerous height To greater ruine; Those who stand soe, see't. 275 Richard, long dead, revives; the King nere dyes; A Doctrine misinforc'd. Hee who had Slept Soe long in Death, by Confident disguise, Lives yet a Man. What Meteors haue crept T'abuse the world! The false fire of a Name Seems orbéd Power; or Power supplants that flame. 276 Poore Richard's Ashes innocent; his name Creates like Atomes, his Imagin'd forme. Soe Individualls may appeare the Same; And Nature Twinns through all the varied worme Of her Creation. The still-Crawling seed Of formes, vnto her hand, is Limited. 277 Soe, though Specificke formes distinguish't are In euery Individuall, as her worke, Sence is not made the Iudge; for Men appeare Leaves of one Tree; &amp; Seams vnnoted, lurke Visible Characters of her intent; Neare variations are most Different. 278 Thus Nature, with a Cunning Pencill, drawes The Landscape of the World; one obiect knit Soe vniforme, as were it but one Face Of Beautie; &amp; all Symmetry had met By vndiscernéd Lines; Each Shadow brings His Greater Light, one forme of many Things. 279 Nor is it strange for one Man to assume Another's place; Consenting Nature prompts Somewhat in the Resemblance; 'tis one Loome Where Man is drawne, &amp; many Threds at once Make out the Web entire. Thus Kings may run From the same flax, a little finer Spun. 280 Hence some affirme a Story, what a few Did but Suggest, t'elude the present Time; And might wee trust all written, Richard drew A Breath, to assoyle Harrie of the Crime Intended in his Murder. Thus a Quill More then a Sword, Not Things, but Truth can Kill. 281 To arrogate, perhaps, (for where wee can Not speake of Better things, not Men alone, But Countryes, boast their Crimes,) the wider Span Of Wickedness; as were his Nation Vnrivall'd in that Glory; here's the Curse; Had it beene true, the King's fate had beene worse. 282 'Twas ere a Shambles yet in England ope Did with Blood Royall make it a free trade; They without Scruple vs'd it; if that Shop Gave vs Indentures, are they not well pay'd? If (though wee forfeited, as much as they) That for the halfe-part, they may have halfe-Pay? 283 'Twas a leu'd folly; Harry shall convince The Error, who well knew how true or false The Rumor was; though Rumor to a Prince New-seated, be vnwelcome, where it calls A former Title to his Right &amp; Name; Though Dead, he lives too much whose Ashes claime. 284 If to insert what happens in our way, Something below our Story; (for to tell Yo? more then All, the walking-Taylor may) I without blame,—as pointing to what fell Within the Raigne,—a Marginall hand, may place To show yo?, what a Parliament then was. 285 That wee may see, not ever Parliaments Haue beene vn-Erring; 'tis enough I bring You to the Place. When Paralel events Run from Centre, wee may vrge the Thing; Soe may a double streame flow from one head; Too much or Little Learneing make men mad. 286 The Commons loud (some Annalls call 'em lewd;) In their demands enforce their Acts of will Vpon the Clergie, &amp; as it had Shewed Not all their owne, to arrogate all Ill, They heave the Peerage; for that Pale throwne downe In breakes the Herd, to the vnfencéd Crowne. 287 The King (whose prudence swaid him either way To his advantage) gives a double Face To the whole management; some Princes may Soe Straddle &amp; stand sure, when either Base Firm'd by his foot, can neither slide beyond His reach; &amp; in his power, to make 'em ioyn'd. 288 Hee (who but wore these Commons as a Goade, And those the Sharpest prickers for his vse, To drive the Restive Lords,) willingly stood To see their burthens brought; 'tis euer thus, When bold Eyes beat another to the blush, Confident Tyrrannie is Glorious. 289 For he but dreames his part, who hauing got The power he sought; (&amp; when in other hands Blam'd Tyrrannous) not adds to what he thought It might haue beene; Hee only vnderstands Tyrrannie, who can tax it vnder none, And Act it Iustice, when the Power's his owne. 290 Moubrey (whose blood retain'd perhaps some fire Of preiudice to Harrie; who had made His honour but his threshold to aspire With greater Ease;) strikes out his Sparkes; the glad Tinder takes hold; noe Stroke was ere soe Slight But did catch sure, when 't in a Rocket light. 291 The Arch-Bishop Scroope, that he might Iustice meet For former crimes, falls by another guilt. Wisedome is blind, Religion will not see 't, When Iustice, by Ambition over-built, Is fronted with new Turretts; &amp; that Wall But Screens her Sword, to make it surer fall. 292 The Subtle Mirror of Ambition Extends the figure to a mighty Size; And wee Adore the farre reflection Of Shaddowes, not too farre, but Iust &amp; Wise; 'Tis not a Plaine, but many Squares well knit: Imagine but the Face, it showes yo? it. 293 The Bishop w?? his Colleague Arundel, Were the first Tressells vnto Henrie's Throne; Disioynted on a side, if the King fell Noe wonder but Hee fixt the Chaire his owne; And 'twas not yet Yorke, vnder any name Could wrench a Pin in the fast-ioynted frame. 294 Northumberland, glad once againe to see A face of Tumult, (w?? he hop'd might bring Revenge) comes in; let the Confederates be Noe matter whom; 'Twas to oppose the King; Thus, though in Honour he restoréd stood, Wee may well iudge him yet attaint in Blood. 295 This must not Spread too farre, though it then Spred A Face of Terror; Westmerland, (who erst Had hung vpon Northumberland) now Sped; And yet this Prey more cunning then the first, Indeed the Caution bound but forfeit Oath; The Bishop's gon; alas they'd forfeit both. 296 These dire examples stand to misinforme The gapeing Layetie; when the Prelates fall They are instructing Sins; if he take harme By the deceit, he has Absolv'd it All In Act; and twice-forsaken Loyaltie Preach't faith but servant to necessitye. 297 Nay, soe had fate befool'd the Credulous Arch-Bishop to his Ruine; that he seemes More Confident, as 'twas more Dangerous Inferr'd by Mowbrey; &amp; almost contemnes The young Man's councell as his Cowardice; Fate, who now meant the blow, first binds his Eyes. 298 Thus Westmerland attaines the Snowye horse, And Rhesus falls, Supriséd in his Tent; Is it not soe? the Bishop from his force Perswaded, the Guards Kill'd; &amp; confident To promises, doth Snort his Life away: Dolon, first Slaine, made all this certaine Pray. 299 For where the Scout of Selfe-borne Iealousie, Is strangled in assureance, all the Guard Of Resolution Shrinks; or Slaughter'd lye On heaps; the Chariot, bound vp, vnprepar'd Becomes a Spoyle; whose mighty wheels had rent Their feilds; the vseless trouble of a Tent. 300 The King had leuied now a mighty force In pursuit of Northumberland; who (short To his destruction) falls backe (as of course) In all attempts; was fairely bidden for 't, Twice thus engag'd, to come after the Rout; Esperance! Noe, the word is, face about. 301 Fast into Scotland; Berwicke in his way Hee takes, but leaves least the King take him there; Marches must pause but flights can neuer stay; Hee over-runs the King; but his owne feare Carries along; 'tis thus a Common Case, When foes desist, ourselves make out the Chase. 302 Berwicke by Harrie Summon'd, yet holds out, Expecting aide from Scotland; but afraid Rather then forc'd, by vnaccustom'd Shott; For now, Salmoneus had improv'd his Trade, By Legacye to Leisure; now he mockes The Gods, noe more with Sounds; Hee giues the Stroakes. 303 This Terror-strikeing Engine (that I call It rather soe) to Image Thunder more, Makes a wide Batterie, though the Breach be Small; One single Gunne, tumbles the whole towne ore; As yet, some soe ammuséd, in the Pranke Dare Sweare, a Cannon will shoot miles, Point-blanke. 304 Yet, this when the wise Indians (only fooles Instructed to our Errors) first had heard With an Amazeing horror; iudging Soules (Europeans are soe) Laught at them afeard; The folly's Equall; but wee made the Choice And got the Rattle sooner; Her white Boies. 305 After the terror but ensues the flame, If Maiestie will Act the fireworke out; Noe Touch-hole Squib or Mouthéd furnace came Soe Deadly, as the breath of Harrie, hot Vpon this Towne; Chaine-Bulletts of his will Run through all Streets, &amp; in the Waft, they Kill. 306 The Arme of Maiestie, like Thunder's stroke Disdaines the limber Shrub w?? euery wind Waves, as its Ensigne; but a Stubborne Oke Fixt as the Champion of the feild, will find; And teare him vp, whose many feet had peirc't The Middle Earth; disgrac't, his Armes reverst. 307 Thus Nobler Names, Trophies of Harrie's wrath, Are hung vp Pennons after Victorye; What sin is that, whose wage is more then Death? Strikes Punishment, through a whole family? And many generations Dye in one, Of Ancestry, &amp; of Succession. 308 As that of Witch-craft; the familiar Has not his Name for nothing; it were strange But that Man made of Elements, must Erre, To please the Victor, vnder Every Change; How should wee dare those ruines? but the Cause Determin'd in our selves, prevents all Lawes. 309 Noe sooner here; (but as his worke had beene To secure Corners; soe Diversion Is busines, and Busines agen Appeares a Trifle, for they both are one; And wee but make them Either;) backe to Wales His first Designe (his Busines) he falls. 310 Soe Busines thrives; &amp; Trifles, more concerne For they Succeed &amp; fall into our hands; Man makes himselfe a foole, &amp; yet to learne; 'Tis not as our determination stands; Something without our Arme, tickles the Wrist, And wee catch Ayre whilst what wee sought wee mist. 311 The Robe of Harrie's Royaltie, which sate Faire on his shoulders, hung not at his Ease; The Skirts, lick'd Trouble, &amp; became a weight To make the Glory irkesome. If yo? please See England now the Cushion of his State, Tassel'd &amp; Fring'd; its Ornament &amp; Fate. 312 Soe lyes the Worme, safe in her treeble hedge And eats the Purple Garden, ere wee find Her Sally-Ports; Soe a great Priviledge Has Glory, to our safety; were they ioyn'd 'Twere a full obiect; all Conditions mixt Are Mortall, &amp; but sever'd, to be fixt. 313 As erst he sped, to the same Enterprize, Fate (whose firme Tenors, but her selfe hath layd) Drownes him againe; &amp; the great Hills, which rise In hopes of Conquest, hardly shew one head; Till now the sole appeareing Ararat Call in the Arck; not warre, but weather-beat. 314 Though, if yo? take mee strictly in the word, The King had beene noe looser by the flood, Had Wales beene all one Wave; the French (aboord In Glendour's Ayde) Surpriséd as they stood In harbour, by some English Lords, make out The Tunnage lost, &amp; forfeit stock to boot. 315 Thus, what wee bring as Improprieties In Language, carry Truth beyond their Sound; Nature has noe fixt Scœne, vnless varieties Are but one Same, the Order &amp; the Ground; As though the Quarrell had not beene of Men But Elements themselues had warr'd agen. 316 The wilder two, (whom nothing els restrain's But the Eternall will) had leave to play; The Water threats the Earth; (but that remain's The worke of fire kept for another Day;) The fire (as though he had beene loose for all) Boyles the Green Waues, &amp; Rocks as Cinders fall. 317 So stood the Great Granado of the World. (When matter gave it a continuall flame,) A Spectacle of horror, in the curl'd Mediterranean; &amp; but hee's Lame, Who wonders Vulcan has not trod on still T'enlarge his shop, an Iland from a Hill? 318 This Prodigie to Sence, when Elements (The Solder of the World) combat themselues Strike through all causes; for the Accidents Run to their Source &amp; Share; this Combat delves The world, &amp; strange relentings teare the womb Of Nature lost, if Either over-come. 319 The Equall Prodigies of Preiudice To either Party, made them both awhile Lye to their Safety; time not lost to advise How to revenge; that Passion must boyle Out all pretence of Men; thus Truth at first Is Tyrrannye, or Treason, as 't is nurst. 320 The King retires, &amp; leaues the Prince of Wales, To make his Title, his Inheritance; The French mean-while, with re-inspiréd Sayles Come to ayde Glendoure; but the wing of France, Is, by a stronger Pineon over-wrought; Thus happy fates, Spring high, at setting out. 321 Some practises, the while, were made aloofe In Scotland, to bring in the English Lords There fled for Refuge; 'twas a Noble Roofe That to preserve; the honour of Accords Durst throw himselfe, a certaine loss, t'advise Their Safetie; though his blood were made the price. 322 And thus Northumberland, w?? Bardolfe, fled To Wales; asham'd, or rather, more afeard To breath the Civill Ayre; only the head Of Treason is more confidently rear'd, Where Minds incultivated, seed their owne Thistles of Rage, to boast the highest growne. 323 For there Rebellion, as Religion Is knowne alike; two long hard-sounding Words And call'd the Planks Politicks make a bridge on To keepe dry Soales; the whirl-pits drawne, were fords; And Time but wore the Shallow &amp; the Deepe; One bottome Nature gaue, which they will keepe. 324 'Tis true; where finer subtleties haue crept, As Wood-bine, they a tree, an Arbour make; And cloath his Armes w?? Glory; Nature Stript All formes at first, that forméd things might take Ioy in their Second Motions; &amp; discover The harmony they Sprung from; One all over. 325 Soe stands the vineyard of Humanitye An orderly Consentive Policye; Where pruneing Lawes lye by; till the inanitye Of Branches call 'em out, lest the whole Dye; And then the Rebel crawlers, feele the Edge Of Prudence; Hee that setts, may keepe the Hedge. 326 But feircer Natures; (whose growne Rockye Sap Prevents the Iuice of any sweeter soyle,) Proud in the Ivye Coveringes, which wrap Them to Destruction; hardly may, (with toyle) Bee soe corrected; but they keepe a wild Breeding, w?? Choice, before the manur'd feild. 327 Thus was Glendour; who (though transplanted once, Lick't his owne Principles from native Earth,) Got only Spreading Sap; and could advance A taller head, to make the like rude Birth Of his owne forrest, guess that 'twas Hee stood A Cædar, to preserve the vnderwood. 328 And w?? the knack of freedome, soe leads on His servile crue; as yo? may tingle Bees Hee charmes the gaddings of opinion, With the loud Cimball of their Liberties; As they each Hummer'd, to his seuerall Bough Hee knitts 'em all One Swarme, &amp; Hives 'em soe. 329 Northumberland, (whose proper busines Was here but refuge) only fill'd a Roome, To small advantage; &amp; the Welch-men lesse Valew'd his Title then their owne at home: Goes, where his Name, rais'd him a readie Power (Without pretence) to equall out Glendour. 330 For forcive Names of the Nobilitye, In former Times Spred a whole Countrey through, And made a Cause; the Northerne Counties Hee Led with his Name; What can his Heire doe now? Thus through the world, what yet Olivia mournes, Noble &amp; Base haue Government by turnes. 331 How neare its ruine doth that People draw, Where Giddy Clamour, gvides the whole affaire! And surly Peasants have the Power of Law! Monarchy mock't! Nobilitye a Snare To catch Men! Vertue (w?? has Glorious beene) Worthy the Ostracisme of Vulgar Spleene. 332 Soe learnéd Athens, when Themistocles Whose life (like Sun) ripéned her Olives out; Or see her fate, (when Alcibiades Whose glory was his Ruine; &amp; to boote Vtter subversion to the Towne &amp; State;) Lasht with the Rods of long-growne Spartan hate. 333 See Rome requiting her Camillus wounds; Looke on the Brightest Buckler of her state Eaten with Rust of Obloquye; what Grounds For popular Suspitions? See, the Great War-framéd Martius, by another Name More knowne; the Consuls Largesse to his Fame. 334 See him an Exile, forc'd an Enimie, By the ingratefull Herd, to arme himselfe Against his Country; full in Pietye, Desists from Rage, &amp; wrack't vp in the Shelfe Of great deservings; to the Power Hee fell, w?? hee had rays'd &amp; rac'd before. 335 For spreading glories dazle weaker Eyes; Batts, when the Eagle Rousts, torment the Ayre, And in their dimme Dominion boast a prize As proud, in Leather frocke, as all the faire Sun-feather'd Birds; I Erre to bring yo? downe By Similies; wee see it in our owne. 336 Soe haue wee lost the Priviledge, w?? once Wee gloried, in well-framéd Monarchye; One Name for All; &amp; greater Names, t' advance, Their seuerall Clients; though the Instance be But rude, in some perticulers, th' intent Stood, a true Piramid, in Government. 337 Loe here a Breach; as vnder any forme Where frayle Materialls put in to support, Faile in their office; it may be a harme Vnto the building; must in any sort Be preiudiciall, though wee hardly raze Firme Structures, when some Pillar shrinks his Place. 338 Northumberland, (whose long vnsteddy head Threatned, in the next Storme, to leaue the Wall; And with the Raines of Discord, crumbéled, A worne faint Buttresse;) now at length must fall; Thus an ill-temper'd Ciment not alone Eats it selfe Empty, but betrayes the Stone. 339 Hee can noe longer trifle, his relent For second Pardons, warrant the third Crime; And 'tis a Losse, not to be confident Where the Necessitye enforceth him; Necessitye a Tyrant; tell mee how Hee has kept himselfe who tearing One makes two? 340 Soe when a Storme-tost vessel (who durst brave The Ocean, with full Sayles) is over-wrought With Mountaine-Billowes; &amp; the fatall wave Has torne her Ribbs; it is not to be thought From what Considerations, men dare leape To combat, what they fear'd, &amp; sometimes scape. 341 But euery Arme, must not attaine the Shore Of his Attempt; Northumberland is weake And ere the Tenth wave come, is tumbled ore; The Surge has swept him in; or may wee Speake It to the Story? if you'le looke vpon't A lower Patent, stood for Place, &amp; won't. 342 Against all Rule of Title; but indeed The forcive honour is but where it flowes; A worthy fountaine, whence it doth proceed; And he who stands invicem, may oppose An Earle discended; Comes, though it meant A nearness, was not given to breed Contempt. 343 Short is: the Sheriffe of Yorkeshire by his Power Attach't the Earle if it may be exprest Soe, to his Office; though indeed it bore Another face, yet 'twas but an Arrest Of Treason; Treason, which then brought the Peers To fall, &amp; now to sitt as Comm?ners. 344 Soe fell Northumberland; &amp; better Dye, Extinguish't in the flame then keep a Snuffe In the darke Sockett, or ranke Infamye; Who live degrade themselves; who Dye, Enough, They perish in their Seekings; the disgrace Blowes vp their Ashes, in their Nephewe's face. 345 Thus the worne People (though perhaps they sate Vnder a heavy hand; for Tyrrannie In vsurpation is not wondred at) Resist the Invader; finding Libertie But to their Quiet; rather trusting one A Tyrant, deem'd; then a whole Army knowne. 346 Soe when Timoleon went to vindicate His strange Zeale; Murder wrought out Pietie; The poore Sicilians; (borne to the sad Fate Of Tyrant rule,) yet rather chose to be Quarter'd by Dionisius, &amp; the haught Icetes; then haue Libertye, soe bought. 347 For though the chaine of Tyrranye soe brought Them low, and gall'd the withers of their will; They kept the Teeme, &amp; groan'd the Burthen out, Rather then have the Gad-flyes of an ill- Disposéd Army, on their shoulders feed, As lately Pharax, &amp; Calippus did. 348 And as it is long Tyrranny that keepes Men servile to the Power; soe Power of Warre From the first Egge of Libertie, out-Creepes A fatall Serpent; doe not say how far From truth, some formes are not in Reason reach't; Hydra &amp; Amphisbæna thus were hatch't. 349 The Age (it seemes) after soe great a Birth In Treason, as his owne, broke in the Cell; Slipt her Rebellions, like rude Molaes forth, Though many Lusts conspiring made her Swell; For Treason, like the first-borne Man, will brooke Noe Brother, least his Sacrifice be tooke. 350 Nor may wee wonder much, (if Adages Carry their weight, put into either Scale) They Copied from the King, &amp; were but his Weake Imitators; for who is't shall call Northumberland a Traitor? or deprave The Subtle Glendour, but with Harrie's Leave? 351 Northumberland, noe more; &amp; Glendour (now Sick in his vndertaking) Sues for Peace; 'Tis granted what the King may give; but how May Kings give quiet? Pardon, if they please. Many like Butterflies, vpon the flower Of Life but Spawn's a worme shall it Devour. 352 Hee who had read the Ephemerides Of Fate; &amp; could repeat his owne, by roat, Falls Retrograde; &amp; the Great Wolfe (to please Old Prophesies) wanders a Montaine Goate; Soe when our hopes are fled, wee take the wild Of Furie; leape the hedge &amp; run the feild. 353 Thus Glendour, while a Rebel made his owne Way, to his Will; now reconciléd finds Noe path to tread in; wand'ring vp &amp; downe Makes all the world his Grate; for broken Minds Suggest a Terror, which their Fancy Spreads; Destruction yet must follow where it leads. 354 Hee now a wretch, not worthy of the Ayre To Breath in, nor the Earth to beare his bones; Flyes both, &amp; keeps a Diet; (which his care Wrote Legible) in a Cave, for the Nonce; As Nature had Intended Nothing more Then such a Coffin, for (her Shame) Glendour. 355 And now the King growne Potent, in his owne, Gives Light to others, how to valew him; As by his turnéd hand, the fate were showne To other Princes; France, (the Noblest Limne Of Europe, Synnew-Shrunke) must fall, or stand To the determination of his Hand. 356 'Tis from our Story, that wee should repeat The mighty factions were late growne in France; But to our purpose: Burgundie (who yet Felt the guilt gripe of late-slaine Orleans,) Did feare his Son; &amp; others in Relation Might thinke vpon 't, though to an other Passion. 357 Hee early sends to Harry for his Aide Pretending danger, in the King's behalfe; Harrye gave sober Cautions, yet afraid, The Rent might heale its selfe; for Princes laugh When Neighbour Kingdomes grone; &amp; then if blood Might carry it, how Equally they stood! 358 Harry to keepe it open sends some Men In ayde of Burgundie; the cause is made In the Complaint, as Iust, as had it beene T'affirme the Diademe to his owne head; Hee's a weake Captaine first who doth not mind His ground, &amp; then draws vp, for Sun &amp; wind. 359 But Orleans, (who knew the Interest Of Princes, made all the causes overweight) Propounds advantages, soe well-exprest And soe Conclusive, by his Delegate; That Harry Smiles to See the way lay'd out Hee meant to goe, made nearer, then hee thought. 360 Indeed hee could not to the ancient claime Of England, vrge a Right, w?? they not brought A Voluntarie offer; but how lame Are Treaties where noe Single End is Sought? For delving Princes iustle when they meet, Till a fresh Mine be Rak'd, by stronger feet. 361 Soe may wee fancy, the more Politicke Molls, (who in fatter Soyles, have Seigneiorie) Can ill allow a Stranger, but will prick Another Seame, &amp; soe run diverslye In their Dominion; that the Alien must Sterve in her Trenches, or newe Lobbyes thrust. 362 Haue yo? not some-time seene cover a Brooke, A Cast of Haggards,—cunning to the flight— Worke out their owne Advantage to over-looke The trembling Quarrye, from a greater height? In them behold, How Emulateing Kings Cutt Ayre, to fill their Tallons by their wings! 363 But Orleance, (when now the King had sent His Ayds to him, &amp; broke with Burgundie) Slacks his engagement; to the Discontent Of the English, who now wasted Normandie; As Sicles, to another Harvest put, They Eat the Sheaves vp where their wage they doubt. 364 Yet when he saw the Sword of preiudice, Which either way in probabilitie Might fall; for while the Angry English Lyes Vnsatisfied, more then an Enemye They Spoyl'd the Countrey; &amp; his fears portend They were too potent to be kept a freind. 365 For Allies, ioyning w?? an Equall force Worke out their owne designes, in helpe of those Who call'd em in; &amp; leave the party worse Engagéd, to their freinds, then by their foes; And Belgia, only (in a firméd state Wrought out by others) has been fortunate. 366 Therfore, as Generall, when he had Summ'd Himselfe, &amp; drawne the Action by a Claime Of Circumstance, where to be overcome Was but a certaine fate; or trye againe The doubtfull Stroake, w?? those who holpe him once; His single Prize run on a Double Chance. 367 Hee meets with Clarence, to Capitulate; Both seeming Confident, yet neither hott; And vpon termes, gave over in the Sett, For Orleance, had the Dice, to save his Blott, The Stakes were new, but franks, good husbands growne, They drew; but Harrie next play's it a Crowne. 368 The English thus dismist; for Orleance Hung in a broken Tide, &amp; either must fforfeit himselfe or teare the Womb of France; A Paricide as high as Neroe's Lust: For who dare offer Sacrifice soe Strange, As a whole Nation to his owne Revenge? 369 Now may the factions Equally Contest, Or by vnequall hazards open out The Seame, w?? fate, by Iron Time had prest Smooth, &amp; becoming France; for over-wrought, Not destinye can make her Garment fitt All Bodies; some, are made to furnish it. 370 The Great Reserve of fate, to wear the Robe In France, is now wrapt in a Cloud, at home,— His Father's Anger; the Congested Globe Hinders the Light, which in full Rayes would come To the obsequious Moone; while the King Lives All Light is Borrowed, &amp; his Son Derives. 371 But as I said, the Earth of misreport, Knitt vp a Bodie, t'interpose that Light Might Orbe him out; the Maggots of the Court Eate into favour; where they bred, they bite; Vnnaturall foolish wormes! who 'gainst the Lawes Of Nature, Live but to devour their Cause. 372 Age &amp; Infirmitye (when I soe Speake I fold vp Man, one Peice; Bodie, &amp; Mind) Are Iealous; Iealousie, which in the weake Sand of distemper Bask's it selfe to find Ill-operateing Ant-Eggs; (if wee tread From story, Hee that's Guilty, shakes his Head.) 373 Somewhat, which might incite the King's behalfe In preiudice to what the Prince might Act, Was his owne Guilt; for they are never safe Who weare their Titles by a Præ-contract In Treason; where a Crowne is all the Ayme If King prevent not, Fathers but the same. 374 Example, as a Parent; when the Sad Remembrance strikes him, thinks 't may move his Son Vnto the like Attempt; for now hee weigh'd His Act a Crime; &amp; wish't it were vndone; Lest now his Son, following but the Traine Himselfe laid out, were ripened fitt to raigne. 375 These sad disturbances, vnto his Soule, Had worne him thin; Indeed the Prince (whose Youth Was full of Spirit) loved not the Controule Of a strict hand; yet never knew the growth Of Disobedience; to a Rebel Thought Misconstrued, in his Actions rais'd the Doubt. 376 'Tis Turkish Policy, to make a Doubt In Blood, &amp; strangle Heires in Iealousie; Where trusted Ianizaries stand about The Tyrant, Missives to his Crueltye; Though wee but call the Turke soe Politicke, Wee saw it lately Acted, Catholicke. 377 Still in an Agéd Tyrrannie whose Oyle Crusts in the Lampe, the Glories of a Bright Far-shineing Torch is Blaméd, to revile, In its acknowledgment, the low-Spent Light; Security's a point which few can draw In Nature, but's a Common Line in Law. 378 Till now the Prince, (whose Recollection Was a strict Spunge vnto his Errors past) Falls at his Father's feet, in a Subiection Worthy his double Duty; &amp; soe Grac'd His vindication, to the Royall Eare It charm'd the Evill Spirit of his Feare. 379 Sir, if I merit Death, I bring a Life, Glad I may satisfie my selfe &amp; you With one Act; 'tis your owne; or rather, if My hand be Guilty, let it punish too; Nor can it construed, as selfe-Murder be; 'Tis or a Iustice, or a Pietye. 380 If I haue sought what some perhaps Suggest, This Easie Iustice were below my Choice, If 't be an Iniurye; yet haveing prest Your Royall Heart, my Death but Satisfyes Worthily to enlarge your soule; I breath Vngratefull to my Life, to feare a Death. 381 The King melts to his Zeale; soe when a wind Has long ore-run, the Earth, w?? chilling force The supplyant fruites offer themselves as pin'd In such a Fury, &amp; diverts his Course; The same Cloud, breakes in a refreshing Shower To Ripen, what it threat'ned to Devour. 382 And now, the King (who by Rebellion Purchast his Glory), seated, suffered in His Crime; &amp; liv'd but in progression, Of the Same Act; his Raigne was All one thin Much-fretted veile of Loyaltie, whose Rent Made by himselfe, Caught others as he went. 383 For first the Rebell Lords &amp; proud Glendoure Vexéd his Throne, the best part of his Raigne; Scarce that appeas'd, but an Affliction more Pressing, Involves him; Euen his Blood, to staine Him through, is taxéd; &amp; least Hee might part Calmely, his Rebell Spirits surround his heart. 384 Hee, in himselfe, finds Monarchye dissolv'd; And seated vigour, violently led A Captive by Rebellious pangues involv'd; An Apoplexie Strikes, through the Head, And his sicke Temples burne, to beare that Crowne They beat to Compasse; Now too late, too soone. 385 His Bodie thus Surpriséd, what remaines But he may know himselfe Depos'd, alike As Richard, bound in Paraliticke Chains Vnder a Tirant's Grate; who till he strike Insults w?? a bold Storme; &amp; to his face Twitts him, with all the follies of his Place. 386 Not Richard now (whose Resignation His weaknes was, his merit soe his Crime;) Appear'd more abiect; Harrie bleeds Compassion Vpon that Dust; soe knead 'em; &amp; but Time The Accident of Life, decides how much Richard was weake &amp; Harrie was not Such. 387 Now the Blacke Cloud gathers vpon his Orbe; And the Refractions of his Spirit Gild Only the Hemme of Life; wee not disturbe His parting Breath; for when yo? haue beheld Him, See All Kings, as Men. But lest the Text Bee maiméd here, 'tis made out, in the next. The End. The Raigne of Henrie the Fifth. 1 Soe Springs the day, a happie omen to Our purpose, if the facultye be yet Remaineing in the Tribe; &amp; Gloryes grow From many Dayes, in this One, to be met; 'Tis more then Chance; this day begins the Storye An Anniverse of All our English Glorye. 2 Wee Riddle not with letters; neither racke Indifferent Numbers to Necessitye; Nor vrge bold Criticismes, nor offer weake Dreames of Coniecture, in the fallacye Of our Affection; as though Truth &amp; Witt, Needed an Astrolabe, to make 'em hitt. 3 The Drowsie Soule, neglects an offer'd Time, And Swimm's his Age away in Careless Dreams; Wee flatter not ourselves; for verses Clime Vp with his Ladder; &amp; Survey extreames Of his Dominion; to the Light, he weares The God of both Appollo, Chart'red verse. 4 Whilst others Then (vnblam'd) in Thirsty Zeale, Express their wishes; &amp; provoke their Braines To Celebrate the Day, as did they feele New Passions Spring, &amp; Blood enrich the veines, Inspiréd from his Name; fully Possest, Become entranc'd; the morneing tells the rest. 5 Wee calmely offer, (what our Pietye Chose rather, to the honour of the Day) Numbers, of force; if yet some Dietye Bee not offended) Iove, &amp; Phœbus say Goe on &amp; Prosper; Crowne the Sacrifice Of our Endeavour, far-seene Prophecies! 6 How well to mee (the meanest that attend With incense readie) doth the Day fall out Who Act my owne? vnder his Gloryes Skreen'd An humble wayter; as 'twer borne, to doe 't; And were not that some Cloud, I durst pronounce Wonders; but 'tis enough, wee see 'em once. 7 The calme Tabernacle of our Hopes, Our fervent vowes ascend; 'tis All what sad Restraint allowes our zeale; &amp; many stopps Of Passion, Checke the Current of a Glad Intention. Stay! the Auspicie, prevents Our feare, &amp; Chides the Error of Complaints. 8 Bright as the Mid-day Sun, when banish't Clouds Bind vp the Hemisphere; as Soft As new-Inspiréd Ayre; Sweet as the Budds Of Virgin Roses pluk't; if from these oft Repeated Similies, yo? gather how Wee Spread, to Close, 'tis well, but these are Low. 9 Full-Swelling as the Womb of Nature, when She gave a Birth to formes; Cleare as her Eye To Iudge her Issue; Such should be the Pen Must vndertake this taske; Soe great, Soe high; That never Truth, yet a Iudge, (as once she stood O're Men &amp; Things) She might assert it Good. 10 But when Our humble Letters, Spell'd at best Make only words; &amp; words, well-ioynéd Speake But halfe our Thoughts; how narrowly exprest May this Appeare! for high Conceptions breake To loose their force; &amp; Wee but vtter Things As full-swolne Banks wast Water from their Springs. 11 This Age is Barren; for Spent Prophecie Chalks out a Sybill, chosen by her fate; Raptures are now but Dreames in Poesye, And verse is noe more Charme; it is; I was, My selfe, bid Say; what Probabilitye Denies a Truth, firme-written Destinye. 12 'Tis now the night; but Rampant Darknes whets The Clouds vnto their Ruine, in his hast; Forgotten Light, restor'd; Calme state befitts Iust Glory, now Approaching, now defac't; And though I cannot Speake it, yo? may see, —Pull by the Curtaine,—by what meanes 't may be. 13 Wee who haue found the Ends, can Twist the Cord Of fate, to fetter Time; &amp; draw him in By plyant hands, more manag'd with a word Fitly pronounc'd, then had he servile bin In Copper Gvives; or Adamantine Chaines Which he trots of, or breaks, as Slender Reins. 14 The Glory of this Day perfects the King Of his imposéd Tasque; as were the yeare Beat in a Plott, &amp; Dayes were Curvetting; Here, he bounds; done his worke, to begin here The wheele of a new Travell; well pursued If by a Circle, Ioy may be Renewed. 15 A mid-day Starre gives Light; the mid-day Light Affronted, hides his Head; wee have found it since Our Sun of hopes at Noone, buried in Night; The Starre's removéd Light, nere Influence Ensues; for all Phœnomena doe stand Vnto the Text of fate a guiding hand. 16 This full Quotation, by an Asterisme Set in the Margent of a middle Page; Meanes at a Sence, above the Solæcisme Of Darke Coniectures; One Day writes an Age; Though a Good hand, pussle an Eye to Read 't A Pater-Noster, in a Penny Breadth. 17 Thou who art left expositor, when Time Shall wing thee fitt, to open out the Scroll; Discover by some Steps, how wee may Clime T'arrive that Magicke Truth; which wee, a dull Raw Generation, in the Salt of Earth Pickles, and are afraid to bring it forth. 18 When these Genethliake Rages are made out The Sober Obiects of a well-taught Mind; And fancy shall submit to what wee brought, Iust Story; Fate determined, Fate Design'd; Then by Compareing Coppies, 't will appear Man Legible, is the same Character. 19 For let not Names illude vs; when wee heare Great Things, they carry all their Ornament Done by an English Harrie, as they were Foyl'd, by a Greeke or Romane President; Though Love &amp; Honour often better frame Faith, at a Distance, in a forreigne Name. 20 Thus the wild Braines of younger follies drawe Imagin'd Beauties in Repeated Names; And fitt their fancyes to a certaine Awe Of Syllables; Soe Cleopatra claims Life to this Day; &amp; bright Poppæa weares Some Charme yet, interwoven with her haires. 21 For tender Passions easily provoke Themselves, from Blood &amp; Names to trafficke in Addittaments of fancy; Ayre &amp; Looke, Fingers &amp; Nayles &amp; Teeth, have motives beene To keep the Tide still floating; soe wee raise Small Things, by Great Names done; the Shreds of Praise. 22 As though a Scipio, or a Hanibal An Alexander, or a Pompey, great By the favor of their Age; had ingrost All The Stocke of Honour from vnfortunate Posteritye; &amp; humane Race but tooke Reflected Glory, as on them they looke. 23 These engineeres in fame doe thus maintaine Their Syracusa from Assault; &amp; fright With a Rope's End, the gapeing world. How plaine The Batterye of their Names, rais'd to a Height, Secures the Cittadel that Coward Quills Doe not Approach but veiw it from the Hills! 24 Blame mee not therfore, if (the Seige, thus rais'd) I with the rest, become a Looker on; Till Harrie, as Marcellus, (better prais'd In his owne Conduct,) force the wall &amp; Towne; And lead vs on Tryvmphant through the Port Of Victorye, to Honour's Splendent Court. 25 But now the Palsey of the common Earth, Trembles my Quill, &amp; Spatters out my Inke; The weake Support of Historie holds forth A broken Crutch; my fancy 'gins to Shrinke, Attending Him; the Leggs of Greece, w?? Stood Strength to the world, nere knew a Richer Load. 26 Hee (who had summ'd the Glory of them both And Spann'd their vertues, a Proportion Within himselfe,) knew both the forme &amp; growth Of their best Plants; without addition From the wat'ring-Potts of Eyther; Hee, Needs not draw water, whose Sap maintaines the Tree. 27 Who could obserue, from Selfe-Sprung Principles, The Rigour of their teachings; &amp; Act out Their Glories, Letters; his owne Syllables Run vp, in words, to give a Sence, which nought May open, but the force of his Great Name; To be Read, All wee know, All They Claime. 28 Now to the Storye: See him enter on A Kingdome, rent &amp; mangled, gapeing wide In wounds of Faction; Application Helps to the Cure. But where the Spirits are tyed By mutuall Sympathy, the worke is done As sure, as by State-plaisters, far more soone. 29 The vnresisted Emanations Of a true Maiestie, without Effect Never returne, but baffle Questions To their Activity vncircumscript; At least where dull Philosophy, confines The Sphære, or rather, Men Square her, by Lines. 30 The Rigid Thesis! nothing workes beyond His Sphære! how taught? how from thence shall Spring A Legion of Doubts? and the well-Shrin'd Axiome, was left A Poesie for a King: The Stagirite who said it, saw how farre Spirits may worke, but he prescribes no Sphere. 31 Wee Question not the Inactivityes Of grosser Mixtures, then in Harrye's Blood; Where the Apotheocarye, to his Price May force its Spirits; but when Nature proud To better Ends, send such a Casket, stor'd With State-Salve, &amp; wee take it on her word; 32 If it be true in Nature; rather if Plynie's Relation be of Nature true, And wee may fancy out what he doth give For Story; Harry stood the Adamant, w?? drew The Coasting Iron from the late proud Keeles; An Arméd Rocke; &amp; they renounce their Steeles. 33 All bring the Tribute of their Loyaltie W?? out Demand; &amp; offer out their Strength Without Security, if Royaltie Be not more warrant; Some are taught at length The follye of their Rigours; to convince Exacted duties, bindinge from the Prince. 34 The Glory of his Person, the Great hopes By former Actions taught, to future Things; Bend the long-knotted Nobles; &amp; the Ropes Of Popularitie fall, limber Strings; Credit old Fame, w?? tells yo? Stones &amp; Trees Leap't to their vse; They were but euen as These. 35 Men cent'red to Selfe-Interest &amp; lock't To their wild Causes, melted by a Touch; Which might peirce deeper, from themselves provok't; Well-wrought Materialls knitt the frame to which They were Intended; &amp; the Golden String May thus, a Thebes, erect to every King. 36 A Glorious Policye; &amp; in that way I cannot thinke our Harrye was out-wrought; Or was it Number'd verse? let Orpheus play; Our Harrye has a deeper, Sweeter Note And from soft Groves, could his owne Act reherse As high as Pindare, or Tyrtæus' verse. 37 That infancy of Time, (when vnfledg'd Witt Imp't from the raggéd Sarcill Chaucer drop't) Was Smooth'd by him a-new; &amp; fancy knitt Harmonious Sence; it is but to be hop'd A King &amp; Poet; if it shall be Seene Nature full-handed, made that Age to Him. 38 See now his Pietye; for ere he seat Himselfe, he iustly claimes it to enthrone Deposéd Ashes; if a Muse, now great As Maro's were to breath, this Act alone Might raise a Poem; Vertue doth not flye In acts of Nature, but of Pietye. 39 If Great Æneas, for his care &amp; Toyle Live in his Name; the obligation bound His duty; &amp; the Goddesse lov'd, erewhile Exacted more; a Parent! 'tis not found By narrow words, what wee ought t'vndertake In such a Case, where they prevention make. 40 But here, where Harrye, (noe relation But Iust to the iniur'd dust) is seene Charg'd w?? as full a Load; &amp; by Translation Forgotten Richard, marryes to his Queene; Whom Death and Tyrranny had long divorc't: Glad Ashes meeting; mixt, One Both Endors't. 41 Richard, whose Bones, with vnmeet Covering Slept in a Cottage; Harry doth remove To better lodging; vrnes him, like a King And gives nere Life to Him, to meet his Love; If Dust Inanimate, retaine what Life Imprest, he warmes againe to meet his wife. 42 Royall Solemnity! now Richard Lyes Full Quiet, to his honour &amp; his Choice; Murder forgiven in his Obsequies! Shrin'd neare a Martyr, to his Nuptiall Ioyes! Resolveing it, a Sacrament not Lost Which may be iterated, even in Dust. 43 And as a Monument repaires that House In Pietye, w?? Richard's Passion Whilome Subverted; Sheen, (made Glorious In Harrye's bounty) may recount, foregon Delights; ev'n Richard's folly, in her Dust New fronts her Turrets, with a treble Boast. 44 Nor stayes he here; Dead Ashes, Harry knew Are the same Mold &amp; Earth for any Place; Hee cutts a larger Sphære; performes a Due To the ne're-Dyinge Part; &amp; knowes noe Ease Can be in Ashes, when the parted Ayre Wanders; he gives a Requiem, worth his Care. 45 Devotion, laught at now; as where wee bring New doctrines, to a well-resolved Truth; Contempt, from thence, workes by new hammering A Fish-hooke, from an Anchor; let the mouth Of Errour, in a Dungeon ope, Shee's heard; But wisedome, in the Streets, w?? out regard. 46 And that wee may not arrogate all new Vnto ourselves; as were Religion The Partrige hatchéd in our Age, which flew With shell on's head, for hast, where others run; 'Twas Gutlin, then but throwne out by the Rest. An evill Bird, defileing its owne Nest. 47 The Worthy S? whom Falstaffe's ill-vs'd Name Personates on the Stage, lest Scandall might Creep backward &amp; blott Martyr; were a Shame, Though Shakespeare Story, &amp; Fox legend write; That Manual where dearth of Story brought Such S?s worthy this Age, to make it out. 48 But New-Sprung doctrines, Liberty layd out, May force her Plea &amp; shall in noe Age want Abettors; as 'tis easier to Doubt Where Rigour curbs; &amp; every man will grant What he desires; noe knot of Syllogisme Needs bind, where willing Sence, appeares the Schisme. 49 That he might haue his Capons, fryday fare, And Peter's Sheet for Lent, his Table Cloth; He claps vpon the Dung hills; nere &amp; farre Red Craven Cocks come in; but these for Broth, An ore-Boyld Cullice, in Religion, Carv'd out cold Ielly, by his Rebel Spoone. 50 Another Knight but of noe great Account (Soe say his freinds) was one of these new Saints A Preist! but the fatt Mault-Man! (if yo? don't Remember him, S? Iohn has let his rants) Flye backward, the first Knight to be made And golden Spurres, hee, in his Bosome had. 51 Soe says my Textuary; for I am brought To vse their words more willingly, in things Where they are Partiall; lest I be thought To Speake with preiudice; the firmest winges May Strike a Plaine, of pleasure, w?? out blame; Wee to the Subiect, Stile, &amp; Accents frame. 52 For shall we blame Rebellion, in Act, And vrge it, as our owne, an open Sence? Bring well-fyl'd Numbers, Treason strongly back't In the Assert of Language? noe offence! Wee flatt in this, least Syllables too proud Might make mee guilty, them misvnderstood. 53 As the first Author of Devision rais'd A Rebell Legion, vnder faire Pretence; These (not to Staine their Pedigree, well-prais'd In such an Ancestor) conferre the Sence Of their Intentions, s?m'd by Aggravation Of Old, to Informe new, a Reformation. 54 But 'tis enough; they perisht in theyr lewd Attempt of Treason; I should be to blame To detaine Harrie, in this Rebell Crowd, When Nobler Actions calls; Hee, not soe tame, Breaks through their Trammells w?? a foot of Scorne, To pursue Glories, whilst they hang or burne. 55 Be not offended if yo? looke vpon The Chicke start from that Egge; in every Age The feathers stand wrong way; Religion Is a bold Herauld Growne, from a soft Page, Attending Loyaltie; &amp; if wee blame Defections now, they wrought by the same frame. 56 For nothing's Spoke to trouble Sober heads, Who walke in their calme Principles; but all The world (not read) may see how far it Spreads To vindicate all Riot; when wee call The Sword of Faith, (w?? every Arme may weild) A well-rays'd force; wee carry but the Sheild. 57 The Conventicles met; &amp; would derive Their Zeale, some Centuries; the Preist promotes Their Actings, lawfull, pure, &amp; Primitive; The first S?s, liveing in Remoter Grotts, Had such feild-meetings; but he lost his Text; The Crou'd came in &amp; made it good he Preach't. 58 A new Church Militant! and sure that word Provokes ill vnderstanders, to those Armes; Prayer's, a faint dry-blow, but the keene-edg'd Sword Flyes with full Spirit; &amp; the Struggle warmes An Active faith; fixt Eyes, &amp; bended Knees Are lazy Christians; &amp; but Cloystered Ease. 59 These Trencher-S?s; full-paunch't Boetians, Contemne all Bodies bred in purer Ayre, As Atticke leanness; dry deuotions; And reckon Blessings by their Bill of fare; When the good Creature, offer'd dayly twice Opens their Mouth, &amp; Shutt their Eating Eyes. 60 Thus travail'd faith (as weary to be sett In the leane pasture of a Barren Rocke) Now Garrisons where this Old-Castle, fitt With better pastures, tempted; if yo? looke Religion vagrant, Strictly in the Face Since She left Church, she Sneaks in any Place. 61 For when the Holie Place became a Scorne, And keene devotion swett in Corner-prayers; Each found his owne Conueniency t'adorne The Seruice; &amp; a lobby, or darke Stayres, A Feild-house, or a Barne, for better Stands; Their walking Temples are not built w?? hands. 62 'Tis but the same, wee over-acted See Though are pleas'd to winke vpon that breach, Which was as farre (to looke Iudiciously) A rent, from truth as any they now teach; The Seam-les Coate, was torne then; Babes in Grace Rippe it on further, from the Broken place. 63 As had the midland Sea (whose full retreate Into the bowels of her owne Sprung waves) Bin open'd out, by ill-spent toyle, to meet The Red-Sea; once-fam'd Memphis and the Sheaves Of fertile Egipt had beene lost; the gaines For what, was Ginger, Traffick't w?? less Paines. 64 The Fire's not yet extinct: Some lurkeing Seeds Glowe, Rak'd together, in a Parliament; Like Dunghill Scraps, made fuell, the Smoake Spreads An evill Odour; Proverbs are not lent As meerly vseless Sayings; this Smoake flyes Still in the fairest Face the Clergies Eyes. 65 And had not the Great Prelate, to direct Its growing Course set ope a wider doore; Who knowes the dire Effect, w?? might have Start From its pent Furie? Hee, to cleare that Score Layes vp another Vlcer, fitt to Lance The Tumor'd Wombe, of long-neglected France. 66 And drawes the formall Title, a Iust Plea For English Armes, to Advocate how farre The Salique Law was binding; w?? they Say Was kept Inviolate, he makes appeare A Trifle, in their owne Succession A worne out weake Germane Tradition. 67 And fires them vp, by the repeated Names Of Ancestrie, which in Third Edward's Raigne, Soe Noblie Sought that Right; worthy their fames As well as Blood: nor could They Present Staine The mention of their Grandsires any way Soe much, as by neglect, or by Delay. 68 This the great Eye-sore, of Swolne Prelacie, Removéd was: and forreigne obiects fill All Braines with Expectation; Fancies flye Vpon this new Designe; as ore a Hill, Where lanke-wing'd Puttocks hope to catch their Prey They hover, till it Stirre, and Swoop't away. 69 Fancie of future Things, to please the Sence Is Nature's Kite, in our Humanitie; Deepe guilt, feeding on Small Birds, in Expence Of many many flights, with downe-cast Eyes, Whence She expects another Gorge at Night, But Slips the mountinge Larke; too Strong a flight. 70 The Shrill Alarum, from the Archbishop's mouth Was (if it may be call'd) the Trumpet's Sound; Rais'd English Spirits from their Graves of Sloth And Pulpit Drums awake the Iland round; All Boanerges; Ianus thus reverst, Is Peace or Warre, well-handled by the Preist. 71 But first, (for the Solemnitie setts off All vndertakeinges) by Embassadors, Harrie Præferrs his Title; and doth move Some distant Ceremonies; not the Warres Were sought by him; but he Demands his Right And must expect, or force it out by fight. 72 This Confident Dispatch, made an Amaze In the french Court; the hott-brain'd Dolphin, takes It, with Laughter, in his father's face; And quick, at french returnes, in loud Scorne Speakes His Thoughts, to vndervalue what was Sent; Yet, ere he quitts them, gives the Complement. 73 Tell your young King, wee vnderstood how farre His Claime extends; but 'tis enough if Hee Manage his owne; let him not Seeke a Warre Of disadvantage; yet that he may be Not Idle to his Yeares, wee send him back These Tennis-Balls, for Recreation Sake. 74 Y'are soe dismist; And soe they did returne Vnto the King; who Shells himselfe, to See W??in himselfe, the Obiect of this Scorne; Breakes Soberly resolv'd, Soe prosper mee As I intend, to play this Sett, with Him Who has more Skill, but not a Bolder Lymne. 75 Wee'le trye the Dextrous Mounsieur, if his Art At Racket, be a Rampier to his Townes And how the Hazard, (Raillerie a-part,) Can best be forcéd; if wee venture Crownes, Let's trye it Noblye; and to make him Sport With Odds I'le venture it, in his owne Court. 76 This said, he fitts himselfe, with Eager hast To make his promise out; but ere he move Provides due Strengths vnto the double wast Threatned at home; for yet the Welch-men rove The Marches and the Scotts were fitt to make Their inroades; if he should but turne his Backe. 77 Secure at home Hee with a bolder foot May tread the Face, of Sea-Devided France: The Dolphin who had run his Errour out In Rashnes, calmes, and with a Complaisance Discends to his Discretion; over-hast In Passions, See but errors, when they're past. 78 Large offers, by Ambassadours he Sends; But Harrie's Aime was farre beyond his guift; Strongly insisting on his first Demands, The Realme of France in Dower; and yet that left Vnto his Choice, as he might after Suit Affection; not by Covenant bound vnto 't. 79 The Crowne his Right, and if vpon that Grant Their Tender, to his Iudgment did agree, Hee would to please Himselfe, his Title plant In their Collaterall Blood: but as to be Honour, conferr'd to Them; and noe Advance Accrued from thence, vnto his Claime of France. 80 This fixéd Temper, in a King made out His glorious fortunes; nothing leads a Prince To Fame Soe Soone, as his owne resolute Determinations once layd out t'Evince Them Noble in the Pursuite; Well Begun Steps from an Offer, and is eas'lie done. 81 But difficult Progressions, worthie are The Management of Kinges; Each C?mon Head Hammers a Noble Act; and makes it faire What might have beene; let their Example lead To the fit is, and shall; for noe pretence Of Gr?mar, makeing moods, confines their Tense. 82 Princes are still Secure, where they Act out Their vndertakeings, by Resolvéd Lines; And by Sage fore-cast, orbe themselves about Impenetrable Spheres; in Great Designes Irresolution, doth as Dreadfull rise As Caput Algot, in Nativities. 83 The french Arch-Bishop, inlie vext to heare Soe high a Constancie; Extenuates His Master's Offer; as not done in feare But a Religious care, to both the States; The C?mon Plea of Prelates; Policie Taught Zeale, and Interest, Christian Charitie. 84 The King, vnmov'd by Importunitie Of their first Offers; thus incenséd more Returnes, his Strict Intention Soberlie, The Same at first; 'twas not a Wife, or Dower Might tempt him from his Right, nor the high Set Oration of a Preist, could alter it. 85 Back with this full resolve, the Archbishop goes, The french expect the nere Invasion Scarce confident in Numbers, to oppose An Iland force; what mightie preparation Spreads his Dominion! what huge Levies are Exacted to maintaine, the Approaching Warre! 86 Thus Enimies to honour Harrie, Strive, By an acknowledgment of Somewhat more Then could be Seene; for Princes (where they give The Expectation of invading power Their Terror), muster to the Enimie Encouragement; which leads to Victorie. 87 Let Harrie live; whose fame soe Earlie Sprung (In narrow feilds, of a small Iland pent) Leapt ore the Sea-wrought Channell; and by Strong Impulsive meanes, Subdued the Continent; For trembling France, Strucke through w?? his Name Gave him this Trivmph, ere hee Conquer'd Them. 88 By what Strange means may wee discusse the Power Of Fate to her Invisible Decree? Harrie was younge; his Name had yet noe more Glorie then Title. Some Strange Destinie Runns through the World; &amp; proper Passions fitts To Presage wonder, farre beyond our Witts. 89 Harrie (whose fame, had made an open way Ere yet his Arme appear'd;) forms his designe Full second to their fears; lest some delay Had lessen'd his now Springing Glories, in Opinion. 'Tis not the least Policie To Maintaine Terrors; let them calme, they Dye. 90 The Fresh Nobilitie, (whose blood did Claime Iustlie their Titles) bring their willing hands, And well-rais'd Powers; the Gentry Second them; The well taught C?mons voluntary Bands Come vp t'Attend the hope of this Designe; A Sprightlie Bodie, knit in Discipline. 91 What hinders? now the Army fitt, the wind Sitts faire, and the calme Sea Smiles, to invite Great Harrie, to his Purpose; fortune kind Encourageth the well-rigg'd willing Fleet A Prosperous Voyage: for wee boldlie Read Good fortunes lay'd out, where 'tis writ, God Speed. 92 What horror stops my Quill? ere yet aboard We see the Royall Fraught, a Land-Leake Springs. What France might but expect, by an Abhorr'd Treason, is soe contriv'd. The Blood of Kings Is but thin Guilt, and washt of Loyaltie, Burnish't, a brighter Mettall fitts the Eye. 93 Let not the Sun be proud, that high-wrought drosse Shines from his flame-irradiated Earth; A Bodie from his Life, rais'd to his Losse; And Pleads, its Generation less then Birth From Father, Life, and Forme, but yet retaines More Mother, Sucking Nature, from her veines: 94 And yet vnwillingly displaies his face, His Father's Image, to his Father's Eye; Darkness still loves, and doth but Change the Place Ev'n mixed, above Ground; a bastard flye, Corrupting where it breaths; Soe vnlike the Sun Degenerating Putrefaction. 95 Strange power of Gold; to whom the better wrought Solar productions, willingly resigne; And Actuated Earth is over-bought By a rude Clodd; Gold alone is Devine Vnto our Natures; 'tis in Policie A Cordiall Sure, what ere't in Phisick be. 96 'Tis more then meere Dull Earth, remotely, which Can worke vpon the Blood; let Such as doubt Related Magnetismes, and yeild but Touch Effective operation; See 't made out By many the Examples; where this Clodd Is Substantive, but one way vnderstood. 97 This strange Effluencie had Thrill'd the veins Of Some whose Blood, imagin'd 'bove its power Doth more assert its force; when by fit meanes The Agent meets, its Subiect, 'twill doe more Then rudely wrapt, in a Contiguous heape Where Spirits Choake themselves, lay'd vp to Sleepe. 98 The Treasurer, (how double in his Curse? Hee bore the Bagge betray'd him!) for a Price Mercates his Maister, to extend his Purse; And handy-Capps some Crownes; may the boot rise To the boot Worthy; Councell, Blood, nor Trust May Secure Princes; onlie Vertue must. 99 The Treasurer with Grey, a Northerne Knight And the Earle of Cambridge, (whose relations Were nere the King) had laid it, how they might If not destroy the King, deferre invasions By Tumults, rais'd at home; that France may Sitt To See, our Warre-tost Realme, and laugh at it. 100 Mortimer, Earle of March, in the right Line Discendent, and to fore declaréd Heire Must vndertake his fatall claime againe If haply Richard liv'd not; for as 't were The world were willingly Enchanted; 't was Rumor'd, Hee liv'd obscure, at such a Place. 101 The fame of conceal'd Princes, when She Speaks Their Being, gives not certaine Residence; But with wild Lapwing Ambages, oretakes The former Quest; still beating out, from whence She Nests indeed; carrying vs soe farre-flowne As farre to Seek, there is, as were there none. 102 These three had wrought at distance, (to advance Their Drift) with Old Castle; who now in Wales Quash't in Religion, Treason doth enhance; And Spreads a worne-out Title, with full Sayles; To prevent Soveraigntie; not that he reck't Who wore it worthy, but did both neglect. 103 But faire pretence leads on; and the Dull Heard Front-tickled, yeild themselves into his hand; For painted Loyaltie, is a Gay word; All Eyes may Read, what few but vnderstand; As nothing, might the Brittish Pallat please But Loyaltie outliv'd, and toasted Cheese. 104 The Three were Apprehended, and Convict Of the Great Treason, they had practizéd; Surpriséd Guilt, has nothing to protect Its head from Iustice; 'tis enough wee read They Suffer'd; and this darke State-threat'ning Cloud Dissolvéd Aire, falls in a Showre of Blood. 105 And now the King, with confident presage Of future Glories, cutts the willing Maine; A Navigable Campe, in Equipage; Clasp't now an Arme-full, by the Courtlie Seine Which huggs the English Navy, as She might Have meant t'have wed it, &amp; her faith soe plight. 106 Harrie, Lord in himselfe, of the whole world; Whose Composition 'bove fraile Elements Them Severallie Subdued, the Aire was hurl'd A Sphere, w?? in his Fame; the rude Event Of Water Chain'd; the Earth alone was left To trye his fire on, where it runs as Swift. 107 Thus where the Nobler Spirit is enthron'd, Obsequious Elements, their homage bringe; Well-temper'd Man, is more then one; all ioyn'd Force, their Compliant Sources, in this King; And Nature will not, (haveing forg'd him vp To Life, and Edge) rebate him, in her Shoppe. 108 Forcible Entrie, when the Right's a Crowne, Stands but a Weake Plea, in law; where the Sword Cutts An Entrance to assure Possession, 'Tis Law enough; in other Cases Doubts May rise to the Possessor; but wee must Grant where a King, has Power, his Title Iust. 109 Wee not discusse it here; what Harrie made Cleare Evidence, vnto his vndertakeinge; Indeed, the Cause were halfe-determined, In his Demand, without a deeper rakeing Worne Pedegrees; and Pleas reverst to make Their Salique Lawe, a farre-deriv'd mistake. 110 But a feild-Array and a r?ning Campe Are not Enough; Harrie considers how Hee may Emprove his March; (and make the Banke Of Seine Safe Harbour,) bends to Harflew now; Whose Strength Secur'd that Channell; &amp; Stood out To offer an Advantage of recruite. 111 Hee rounds the Towne, to force it; though to give The french a due, 'twas not soe eas'lie tooke; Nor the assaults were hotter, I beleive Then Sallies, oft return'd; till the full Shocke Of many Batteries, havockéd the Towne; Terror farre Seene, Sure Execution. 112 Yet firme to their resolves; till mixéd Earth Betraies their footinge, and the Ground resignes Its Title English; breakes her Pavements forth; Dissmall Artillery now the Storme ioynes, And Harflew, wrapt in ruine has not Choice To Evade the furie falling, or to Rise. 113 Sadlie involv'd; with lamentable Shreiks (Breath Strong enough to breake another Cloud) The Affrighted Woemen run; the Sulphur Strikes Them Yawninge; &amp; the fantasies which would, From Hecla grones, Enforce that Hell to be, Might have resolv'd this, in Epitomie. 114 The Horrour of a Seidge! (where Spirits Spent In Walls, &amp; fetter'd by Relations) Act nothing clearly; strange Astonishment Surrounding Willing minds, in weake Passions Tender to the Sad familie; the Walls Are but halfe-Mann'd; the better halfe still calls. 115 If Man (at first, were both, yet soe in one Lost to his vse) imparts his flesh, to raise His Equall, vnto Generation; And thence two ioynted are but All one flesh; What shall he doe when not that part alone Recalls him but even Blood aswell as Bone? 116 When the weake Infant (who can nothing read Of Danger, but Spells by his Mother's Teares;) Hangs, on his Knees; and a long Case doth plead In Nature; by his Blood, and by his Yeares; Coniur'd a Coward: thus Religion mocks Vs into Honour, with a Paradox. 117 Give mee the Sprightly Youth; at least soe farre Devided husband, as hee shall not heare Home-whineinges; 'tis the Glorie of a Warre Where both Eyes tend one way; the Souldier Fights for himselfe; for though some vrge a great Spurre in relations, wee scarce found it yet. 118 As when a Man, (nature's best Garrison) Min'd in his vnderstandinges, and laid ope To the Artillirie of his Passion; Resigns the outworkes clearly, and can hope Scarce to maintaine the fort; assaulted still Gives vp his Reason, Captive to his Will. 119 Soe now stood Harflew; which thus over-wrought Argues her frailtie; Strength is not in Earth, However temper'd; and a Cittie brought To Exigent, Shrinks; as the single Birth Of Terror, strikes a Worme; where it doth fall Citties confesse their Individuall. 120 Yet that they might enioy the glimmering Of their low-wasted Light, they please their feares At distance, and make offer to the King If yet some Daies, hee'de Stay; and he forbears To their Demand; but the Despaireing flame Resigns its Sputtering light, ere the Time came. 121 Soe open in their Warres; Soe nobly brave Were Princes, that they Spann'd their Actions Meerlie to honour; not a Towne, which gave Fame full enough; if the french keep their Pactions, Hee'le quit the Seige; and fight in open feild Their boasted Power; if it faile, They to yeild. 122 But none appears, they yeild; if yo? ha' not Seene Sad Loyaltie, reduc't to that distresse, You hardlie know to value it; for Men Catch but weake hints, from what our words expresse; But who have Actually concernéd beene On Such occasions, this of Theirs has seene. 123 The Loyaltie is still soe genuine, It sees itselfe, from all Eternitie; Surrounds all Place; as distant Streames may ioyne In the same Sea; for to Speake Soberlie, Vertue, is but the Glasse, which gives noe face To præiudice, or Praise, but as it was. 124 The various face of Loyaltie may Stand Faire, vnder any dresse; the Tiara Of Monarchie Setts off; but everie hand Must pin that Biggin, fitts; and hee may say Who vindicates the State (from any Dough A well-bak'd forme) is Loyall, that's Enough. 125 The difference of forme, makes nothing to Release of the great Bond, was enter'd first; Then were Rebellion a iust Plea; for who That Scornes the Teat by which he has bin nurst May not provide his Soldiers? Chuse his Bread, And hang a Nose to Leekes, Quaile-Surfetted. 126 'Tis noblie wrought, when by the open Dint Of Armes, a Towne, is forc'd: though Phillip Saw A nearer way: Our Harry makes his Mint Pay, to his owne; and Scornes to breake that Law Of Honour, by Corruption; Solon's Choice Makes Phillip glorious, but our Harry Wife. 127 For though the Macedonian Mule prevaile, And Rampiers to his hoofes are yeilding Sand; Gold is not ever Bayt; and the Sun Shall See himselfe yet out-wrought, by his owne hand; His Artifice in Man, is more Sublime Then Gold, high-wrought; both the issue of one Slime. 128 Man Loyall, is the Elixir from his ffire; And 'tis but Dough-bak't Earth, Stoope to a Clod; The vn-own'd Sun, is buried in the Mire He burnish't out; thus, a deposéd God; Dull Operator, Labouring to his Losse! Selling his Light to Shame, his Heat with Drosse. 129 But Wee, who nor Adore the Sun a God, Nor trust a Horse, for Empire, Shall Salute Him riseing; need not feare an Asse's Load Of Solar Earth, can force the Gates vnshutt; Where Loyaltie vncranied, doth keepe out The Subtle Flame, the Fæces, cannot doe 't. 130 Yet See what Man may doe; when Harflew (tric't Inward of Loyaltie, to the french King) Had tyred herselfe, full-proofe; and did protect Her walls to all Assaults; assail'd within By dire necessitie, her Gates flye Ope And long-kept Loyaltie lies dead to Hope. 131 Thus Glory, gott vnwillingly, shall Crowne Harflew with liveing honours, in the Change; Nor let her blush (mistooke in faith) to owne Harrie, her Leige; Lyllies Spin not! a strange Doctrine Irrelative; but lately vrg'd 'Gainst Harrie's Title, was by him Absterg'd. 132 The Glorie of the feild, (whose native weed Beyond the Silk and Purple, Princes weare) Quitts now her Bed of Earth, enricht to Spread Our Harrie's Shoulders; how may hee appeare Vnto Posteritie, when Lyllies yeild Their Boast to thrive, transplanted in his feilds? 133 Princes may quarter Earth; the Earth laid out Is but a Garment fitt for Kings to weare; Only the Starrs disdaine to fill a Clout; The Covering of Heaven fitts too neare Layd on a Prince's Shoulders; Alas yet For Such a Pride, grones kneeling with their weight. 134 The fatall Cloake, which once Demetrius drew Imperfect laid: and noe Audacious Son Durst wrappe himselfe in it; if Princes knew The iust extent of their Dominion! The Treasures of the varied Earth are theirs; Hee only wears the Orbes, who treads the starres. 135 May then our Harrie, to his Spreading Rose Ioyn Lyllies; happie in their houswifrie, They know noe care of Things, nor feele the Throes Of Cost for new Apparrell; Live to Dye, And Dye againe to Live; but Harrie's Reigne Makes a long Spring, and Blooms them ore againe. 136 Here, to Evince the Scandall has bene throwne Vpon a Name of Honour, (Charactred From a wrong Person, Coward and Buffoone;) Call in your easie faiths, from what y'ave read To laugh at Falstaffe, as an humor fram'd To grace the Stage, to please the Age, misnam'd. 137 But thinke, how farre vnfit? how much below Our Harrie's Choice, had such a Person bene? To Such a Trust? the Town's a Taverne now And plumpe S? Iohn, is but the Bush far-seene; As all the Toyle of Princes had beene Spent To force a Lattice, or Subdue a Pinte. 138 Such Stage-Mirth, have they made Him; Harry Saw Meritt; and Scandall but pursues the Steps Of Honour with ranke Mouth; if Truth may draw Opinion, wee are paid; how ere the heapes Who Crowd to See, in Expectation fall To the Sweet Nugilogues of Iacke, and Hall. 139 Noe longer please your selves to iniure Names Who liv'd to Honour; if (as who dare breath A Syllable from Harrie's Choice) the fames Conferr'd by Princes, may redeeme from Death: Live Falstaffe then; whose Trust and Courage once Merited the first Government in France. 140 This may Suffice to right him; let the Guilt Fall where it may; vnquestion'd, Harrie Stands From the foure Points of vertue, equall built; Iudgment Secur'd the Glorie of his Hands; And from his bountie, blot out what may rise Of Comicke Mirth, to Falstaff's præiudice. 141 Thus enter'd France, not over-run in Thought, Hee takes this Earnest, from the Pay-Master Of all iust Craveings, and the offer brought Of what hee did, not his; the Roman Boaster In Triumph Kings led Chained to his Wheeles; And purchas't Glorie from dire Spectacles. 142 Where iniur'd Princes, vassal'd, Lackey out The Rage of high-growne Tyrrannie; Behold Our Harry, quitts the Glorie; drawes his Thought To the true obiect; Strips, what Proud, or Bold Might rise to prompt his frailtie; humbly there Offers that Wreath, his Homage, which they weare: 143 Courage Subdued; and Conquered Maiestie; More then a Man, and Mightier then a King; A Text of Honour, weake Hydrographie; Victorie vanquised; noe Arme, noe Sling Acknowledg'd to his Entrance; but the high Conduct of Heaven Creates the Victorie. 144 See here a Christian Captaine, who beyond His force of Armes, (Victorie still made out;) Has yet to Conquer; other Princes find An ease, the Action ended; but his doubt- Sprung Pietie has yet a farther Quest, And till himselfe be Conquer'd, cannot Rest. 145 The Waveing Ensignes fall, and pluméd Crests Are laid away: the Neighing Courser fretts Without his Load; Pure Thoughts, from purgéd Breasts Carry Men better Mounted, and the Streets Vnsack'd, with glad Eies See Protection: The Church was Harrie's obiect, not the Towne. 146 Coursly Attir'd, not like a Conquerour Nor a borne Kinge, but as old Pilgrims wont Pay their Devotion, when the long-look't Houre Has brought them, to the Blessed Place; vpon 't They kneele: and Cannot doubt, they may Smart w?? bare knees, whose bare feet trode the way. 147 After Devotions done (for he first paies The Tribute of Successe, then vses it) Hee sees how faire he stood; and by what waies Hee may arrive his End; for he had yet But Anchor'd Seine; the Garrison op'd his owne, Halfe-Subiect Loire; meer French the Rhine-twin'd Rhone 148 The Paradice of France is watered By these foure Rivers; may wee safely draw The Nearest Cutt? France, laid out, Harrie's bed Corded w?? Streames; when you the Curtaines draw, Hee Spreads it ore, well-fill'd; and would you looke Too narrow for his Fame, his Lodgings tooke. 149 If wee may credit Fame, and take on Trust, By one Eye Seen; the broke vp Sepulchre Of huge Anteus, then not worne to Dust, But a firme Stature; if Hee Earth-borne were Worthy his Measur'd Earth, more Earth then it; Fame has noe Cubit; All the World's but fitt. 150 When wee of Great Things Speake, transported in Occasion; (haggard fancie haveing Truss't Soe faire a Prey;) wee fly away: and Sin Rather to Iudgment, then in being Iust; For he who knowes his fault, and doth Reveale Its Secret Truth, may be his owne Appeale. 151 Well, let's away! the King is on his March, Earth-rampeir'd Ears, expect the Drum to Call; The Towne-pent Rutters, willingly enlarge Their Quarters, and attend to Bot et Selle: We've Slipt our Ranke, and can but trudge the while Till wee draw vp in a dissordered File. 152 Harrie had staied some daies, expecting still The Dolphin might appeare; but Time (which guides The Affaires of things) prompts, and provokes his will To yeild to Iudgment; 'twas when the Sun rides In the wrong Scale; and Virgo still too Light Betraied the Ballance, to the Scorpion's weight. 153 Thus Harry thought it Time; the Yeare grew on And Winter Marches, and Way-lay him Sure; Had hee noe Enimies; but ere he can Reach Callice, he expects the Dolphin's Power; At least, some Interruption, by the Waies Hee thinkes to meet, besides Dirt, and Short Daies. 154 And ere he March, the Dolphin (who had rais'd A Numerous Power) had forragéd his Way; The feilds were Swept, and Village profits Seiz'd Make full stor'd Garrisons: that Harrie May Have noe releife, vnless he force it out And cannot feed his Men, but where he fought. 155 Soe great a faith have Princes, when the Sword (Their Rod of Prophecie) leads on: they cleave Rocke-firméd Towers, which healthfull Springs afford To their Refreshment; and if wee may give It by Hyperbole, Commanded Stones Convert to Bread, vnto these Mighty Ones. 156 Therfore 'twas onlie to distresse his owne To greater perill; Seeking to prevent, Became an Enimie; were Harrie none; Hee's forc'd to Act more then he could have meant, For to a violent Hand, Reserv's impart; And Treasure-Trouve's a Prize, with all my heart. 157 Harrie's Intention, leads directlie in, And now ingag'd, resolves to force his way Thorough their Mountaine Army; 't must be done; He cannot dwell Surrounded; neither Stay Safelie; till their Dissolving Courage might Offer a Passage; Hee must Sterve, or Fight. 158 Soe when Rome's Terror, with a Mighty hand Call'd down opposeing Rocks, and made a Breach In Nature's firmest Pale; the Stone dropt Sand; And the drill'd Alpes, became a Posterne which From Time lockt vp, noe foot had ever trode: For they must force new wayes, who want a Roade. 159 The French in Clouds draw in as had they meant To Swallow Harrie's Sun; whose Light once Spread Them, runninge Meteors in the firmament Of Honor; now, as with the yeare, hee'de Sped Downe, to his Tropicke; They round knitt his Orbe And would destroy the flame, which they Disturbe. 160 Harrie demands his way; but the french (full In hopes of Conquest) hem him nearer in; As a brave Vessell, Sea-broke, lyes to Hull; Assaulted by fresh Gallies; that the Ken Of Safetie left, is now noe longer Land But makes her Sea-roome, breakes her Mourage Mann'd. 161 Soe Harrie (tack'd to all the Circumstance Of true-borne Royaltie) resolves to weare His glory, worthy of his Claime to France, A Glorie still Attendant; for that Sphœre Is Scaléd by Attempt; tardy Successe Is but our Rateing, to make our Glory lesse. 162 The French (ascertain'd of a Victory;) Are but vnsatisfied; theyr Tenth man shall Not have a Spoile; soe few the English be, And with hard duties worne, now Ragged All; A laughter to their Pride, a Cast at Dice (Bate but the King) for everie Head shall rise. 163 The King indeed, had a Provision made Of greater Charge, then provéd well bestow'd; But Quoyts, and Kettle-pins, determinéd A Thousand at a Sett, of meaner Blood; And some who valued it, not worth the while Soe meane a Wager, Play 'em Crosse and Pile. 164 They cannot hold; the thin-film'd Bladder breakes Prest w?? the burthen of enforceing Ayre; Harrie must know their Iollitie; which Speaks Insolent Pride, Compassionatelie Faire; A Dialect, soe far sett from his Thought, He never knew it, nor will now be Taught. 165 They aske the Ransome he would give? they Saw His Ruine; Pittie of his Youth and Blood, Prevail'd to sett a Price, whereby the Law (Not recking force of Armes,) He pris'ner stood; How high a Scorne, through Harrie's veins now runs Iudge, who can valew Princes Passions! 166 Who sees not Anger breake in Harrie's Eye? And darting round, keene Raies, vpon their Hoast, Bespeakes on them, the next daies Victorie; The French are wounded, though noe Blood they lost; Augustus Sun-like Eyes, were only Cleare In Peace, but Harrie's peircéd more in Warre. 167 France now appeares the Amphitheater Chose from the world, where Princes enter lists; Th' Impartiall Eye of Heaven alone, Spectator; For who may iudge to such Antagonists Where Princes play at Sharpe? and the Cirque All Engag'd, with them, run in to Stand or fall? 168 Though the french, to their vanities, would bring A follie, of more Ruine; 'twas not worth Their victorie, vnless their frantick King Were brought to see the Scene, as 't were a mirth Chose to divert his Maladie; Soe wont Wood-men call Ladies, when the lodg'd Deere they Hunt. 169 He, from a Hill, Some chosen Stand, a farre May See, the glorie of his owne; in Spoile Of his Invador; iest away the warre In a Prospective Glasse; and frame the Toyle Yet better lay'd; who would not stretch a Chord Or slip a nooze, to Catch an English Lord? 170 Berry (who saw when mighty Edward strucke The Wombe of France, and peirc'd her Bowels deepe At Poyteirs) this disswades; least the Same lucke Attend the like Occasion; 'tis to keepe The best Reserve in State, when Kings Secure Their Persons, and Act onlie by their Power. 171 Hee Sadly could recall, that Error in His father; who once, with as great a Power Became an English Pris'ner; which his Sin Of Blood, yet blushing tells; when of the foure Phillip the Youngest, made the Rest asham'd To leave their Father; thence the Hardy nam'd. 172 'T had beene too much, that ever from such Odds The English had their Victories made out With a King taken; let the ripen'd Bloods Of their Nobilitie but stand to Show 't, Had Charles beene there, his Grandsire had not beene The only French King, English Pris'ner Seene. 173 But let him stay at Roan, and with the Thin Shaddowes of fancie, frame a Victorie; Practise new Ceremonies, t'entertaine Harrie, soe giv'n his; well let it be His intervall; Langvisht Brains, when they frame Credulities, onlie enioy a Calme. 174 Let his enfeebled Temples, for one Night (Full in the Hellebore of Expectation,) Beat orderlie; and his feirce Son recite The Morrow's Triumph, over a wrack't Nation. Some eager Minds, See soe farre Confident From Probabilities, they claime Event. 175 The Night was now come on; the Night which went Before the Day of Battle. Have you not Beheld some time the Rusticke merriment Of wakes? disperse a Countrie all throughout; Imagine all those Bonefires, to be knitt Within your Eye; and the French Campe was it. 176 With the like iocund Noyses, whilst the Bells From farre, harsh Pæans Send; the better clad Pickard, in cross-stript Motley shakes his heeles, A merry Dancer; but the Camp was mad In everie Quarter; noise enough to Charme The labouring Moone, or keepe old orgies warme. 177 Nor did this frenzie, onlie in the meane And vulgar Spirits reigne: Names higher Sett In honour, are distracted; not to feigne Wild Passions, but their owne; as they had mett Vpon a Lotterie; and the valew knew Of English Lives, vnto a Quart d'Escu. 178 Meanwhile the English, by their fire-light, Trimme Their Arms for next Daye's fight; and Scabbards teare From over-rusted Blades, to furbish them Worthy the Hatchment, they intend to weare; 'Tis but gay Riot, Armes to Hatch, and guild; They meane to Sangvine all their Hilts i'th' feild. 179 Others well-notch their Arrowes; trye their Stringes And draw their Bowes; to see 'em beare a Pile. Some dress their Old, and some new Armour bring, The Gallants of their Regiments; the while Another girds his Frock, w?? a sure Thonge And Shakes his Pike to prove it Tough and Strong. 180 The well-Truss'd Bill men, busily repaire Their broken Staves, and chuse out better Heads; Noe idle Hand, can File or H?mer Spare; Growne Armorours all! for when the Instant needs And prest occasion calls, All Iourney-men In Fortune, Chuse their Trades, and Set vp then. 181 Harrie had gon the Round, and Saw his owne Campe quiet to their Duties, and their Need; And from his Trench, by many fire-lights blowne, Might view the french, to gvesse how they were layd. Hee past this Office; for he doth not fall From a Good Cheife, who Acts a Corporall. 182 Now hush't the English Campe; the King (retir'd Into his Tent) informs the Attentive Lords What he had seene; and Courage new inspir'd To Resolution; for a Cheiftane's words Well-order'd, musters Minds willingly, where Before they'd feigned Furloghs, of Sloth, or Feare. 183 For who can doubt? (had not the never-Spent Spirit of Harrie's Vigour led them on;) An Armie harrass'd; baited, as they went By fresh Troops of an Enimie; though knowne Nobilitie, may weare Some Thoughts of Fame, Honour but Creeples, where noe hopes they frame. 184 Who doubts but now (wrapt after all their Toyle) To certaine Ruine, as they well might Thinke? Weake Bodies, loose the Thoughts they had erewhile And dread their fears; the Souldier at the Brinke Might Seeke their Safetie; but they vnderstand Honour &amp; Fortune, meerlie Harrie's Hand. 185 The Ragged Squad, whose Pay, ill-husbanded Gives him nor Shooes nor Shirt, will trudge it out And Combat all the world, if Harrie lead; Hee has orecome the Elements, noe Thought Hee'le be afraid of Men; who, monsters quell'd Hunger, and Cold, and want, yet kept the Feild. 186 Not one in all the Campe, would change his Place To be secure at Callice; soe imprest Affection, vnto their Conduct was; Harrie, was a Securitie, confest Soe farre, All, honour-fir'd in his Name, They blew vp Sparkes, to warme themselves, in fame. 187 Night's gloomie wings, had raught the Antipodes And the new-raised morne (like Eyes ill-wak't) Blears through the Deaw faint Raies; and hardly Sees To Chuse her golden Tire, w?? Purple Streak't; Lodg'd drunke, in Eastern Seas; as men who rise From Last Night's Surfetts, dress themselves at twice. 188 Yet now broad-wakeing, pleats her Rosie Tire: And sleiks her Silver Brow; vnbraids her Haire Well-comb'd, to knit it vp, a Glorious Spyre; Fresh as herselfe, whose Breath inspires the Ayre; And gives those flowing sweets, yet hardlie knowne From what vast Pores, or How, or whither blowne. 189 Reflected Rayes, with greater Splendor Spread. From Golden Helmes, of the french Caval'rie; And iocund Plumes, Lye Land-schape, to the Head Twice powder'd; Horse-tayles, antique Braverie; Let Greece be proud in Death, a Courtier growne, Feathers out warre: wings to Destruction. 190 As had the tardy Day-Light (longe blowne vp With Earnest wishinges, and Impatient Rage) Broke from themselves; a Curled Cloud, whose Top With golden frindge, Spreads Glorie, to engage Gray Dawninge; Light improv'd, from a Blue Coat A Golden Cape, and Lace, the Skirts about. 191 Soe the Autumnall Gossamere, well-trimm'd In Deaw, retaines an odde Tralucencie; And knitts the Sun, (within his narrow film'd Cordage) to all his wealth; the Epitomie Of Iris, and the Same; his Rayes Embow'd W?? in a vapor here, and there a Cloud. 192 Who now had seene the French; (if soe farre backe Imagination may not wrong their hast;) Might well have thought their Empire did but lacke The riseing Sun; and everie Emulous Beast Had call'd his Horses out, with greater Speed And the whole Teem, breath'd fire to be out neigh'd. 193 The french (whose over-hast disordered much The ranging of their Troopes;) as had they caught The English in a Nett, vpon them rush, Who Should be foremost; not as they had fought A well-fram'd Champaigne Battle; but had found Some fort-breach or would Scale the Trenches round. 194 The Ditch, w?? parted Campes o'th' English Side Thickest with Bushes, hinderd the Carrier; Shrouding two hundred Bow-men, closely layd W?? well arm'd Pikes; fled men, ev'n stones appeare Fixt Combattants; as had from Dragon's Teeth Arm'd Elbowes, manag'd Armes, ere they got feet. 195 Harrie leads on; well flank't, to his Designe, And gives the Signall; Hee, or found, or made A way, where ere he came; the french fall in Vpon his motion; and their wings out Spread To hemme his Narrow force; but ere they might Arrive their End, fresh feathers, teach new flight. 196 Feathers, from English Bowes; which at their Chardge Had made a Cloud, and rode a Terror on; Till falling Death, the wonder breakes: the large Quiver of Ayre, well-fill'd; Succession Of forcéd Atomes, in a Torrent falls On the french Helmes; but yet their Horse more galls. 197 And though, the Cunning-Archer, would some time Chuse out his marke and pick a Feather out, Or to the Rich Scarfe direct his Ayme: This heat admits noe choice, to all that fought; Though everie Bow indeed, at goeing home May weare a Scarfe, each Shaft, an Estrich Plume. 198 Yet here: (and 'tis the Ironie of warre Where Arrowes forme the Argument;) he best Acquitts himselfe, who doth a Horse præfer To his proud Rider; and the obiect, Beast Transformes Philosophy but yet the Rule Makes out, to Act, on the more Passive Soule. 199 Now; whether Soules of Men and Beasts! (but that May keep vs from our Expectation;) Be patible Alike; let them Dilate Who can from any Iron Edge-tools fashion; And draw a Syth, or forge a Chitzell out Where but a Horse-Shooe, pussles mee, to doe 't. 200 The Stronger Squadron of the french fell in Vpon the goreing stakes; low-pitch't from Sight; And the retiring Bow-men, as 't had bin Their feare, gave of; the french this soudaine flight Apprehend, to their Ruine; and engage A dismall Scæne, transported in their Rage. 201 As when a Tiger, (whom lanke Ravin fires To sett vpon the Herds, embattailed To their Securitie, with mightie Wires And brazen Hookes, w?? grasse low-covered;) Runs with an Eager Eye; till over Speed Retards his hast, and taught Cords, rend him Dead. 202 Soe fall the french; 'mongst these officious prongs Surpriz'd; their horse entangled, plunge their way Through many wounds, to Death, &amp; breath their Lungs, Their Riders fate; who mangled with them, lay One heap of Horrour; Quaintlie varied Destruction! to the Life, in being Dead. 203 Here strucke into the Breast, a Horse falls downe, And Pins his Rider to him, with the Stake: Another caught behind pinches his Crowne, Three stories of; and breakes his Master's backe, Ill Seated to his Ease, and fenceing out His fate; hangs Cob-web-man, by th' hand and feet. 204 Another with more hast, but the same Speed Cutts ope his Bellie, and soe quitts his Load; Vpon the next Stake, falling on his head Is rooted Man! branch't Armes, and Legs, out-stood A Tree; soe Man inverted; this Earth proud, Might well bring Flesh-Trees, when its Deaw fell Blood. 205 One, ganch't i'th' flanke, breakes with a Restive Scorne; And claps his Crest through, as he would have flung His Rider, fastens both; another borne On with the Preass, stops Suddainly; is hung Vp by the Crouper; would yo? paint him out A Champion, Geiant, neither Horse, nor Foote. 206 There lyes a Man peirc't through, and over-prest, His horse vpon him; here another's tooke His Standard fathome; and his galléd Beast Fretts for his Ease; till now the Chaine was broke By one, who wheeling, from seene perill Starts Vpon the Wretch, and tears him into Parts. 207 Yet Civill in the Iniurie will Share And fortune, makes it soe much from Affront; The Gallant, who broke him vp, caught vnaware By the Chin, seem's as though that hand had don 't; A Glorious Trophie! when the Arme now Dead Boasts Victorie, and brings away the Head. 208 In this confused Rout, where but a few Escape by flight, the English Bowes poure on Their Arrowes; and the Craulers, who had now Reliev'd their Limbes, from neare Destruction, And well had thought, to Steale away from Death, Are here tooke Tardy, and full met, ith Teeth. 209 Death, (whose short Commons, in a Single Meale Speakes, a wild Stomach, but noe Luxurie;) Gorgéd in Blood; carv'd men displaies, to tell The Cunning of his Hand; how glutted, Hee Can part with Armes, and Legges; raw Syppets, sett About his Voyder, over charg'd with meat. 210 Hee Witty Tirant overacts the Thought Of Iealous Power, or rageing Insolence; Quaint fancy, Shaddowes but what hee has wrought A hundred wayes, beyond Experience; Of humane Riot; Chance (who doth prepare Him Pageantrie) out-witts, and outworkes Care. 211 The Storme was heavie here; and many fled The Terror of the Still-encreaseing Shower; Where Brabant's Duke, (who formerly had led And Rallies now) falls close, with a small power Vnto the English Battle; where he gave His Life the Sacrifice, his fame to Save. 212 But these were calmes; and what the inanimate Stakes, or halfe-Souled Arrowes might impart; Wanted that vigour, that proportion'd heat To merit Glorie; Stratagems invert Their End to Question 't; and the face of Warre Can best be taken, when wee see it Bare. 213 Loe where in thronge of Arméd hands, the King Cutts on his way; and at the Lane's End, found Brave Alanzon, with Gloster Combatting, Gloster ore throwne; he strides him on the Ground With Care, and Valour, to repreive some Time That Blood, to greater Gvilt; a Civill Crime. 214 Soe when the Theban Captaine, had Espied His freind opprest, he stands his Champion; And gvards a Life; Soe Saved, both soe Dyed; And Armes, which made their owne, as had they done Affront to Destinies, thus Quittance have; Both baselie fell, whom they did bravelie Save. 215 Thus Royall Bounties, by Malignitie Of fate, and Rage of Time, ill omens sitt Or'e haples heads; firme-written destinie Reverts, the Breath of Kings; and playes w?? it To an advantage; when the Periods breake Forgott in Fame, they fall, to hands more weake. 216 The well-Arm'd King ioyns close; Alanzon hott Doubles his Spirit, Worthy of this fight For 't was (hee knew) the King, with whom he fought; Knowne by his Crowne, he wore that Day in Sight; As not afraid, to wear that Royaltie Hee liv'd with, Emulated more to Dye. 217 May we Speake Prodigies, to enforce Men Beyond all humane Strength? or Soberlie Deliver Modest Truth? and keep a Pen Iust to the Storie? though our Poesie Might pull vp Rocks, and weild growne Trees, as high As Turnus, when he fought Transplanted Troy. 218 Alanzon breakes the Blow, w?? the King first Made, with a Willing Arme; and locks his Hilt In Harrie's Vanbrace; now a nearer Thirst Rages, and Short-arm'd Struggles makes 'em feel 't How they out-wrought Themselves; and yet vndone The worke remain'd, which they first enter'd on. 219 The Bloodie worke, which noe Decision tryes But a free Arme; the King, to vse his owne Enlarges the Duke's Sword; from Eythers Eyes (To gvild each others Helme;) new Courage Shone, As had they fought inspir'd; and either tooke Reflected Spirit, from the other's looke. 220 At length Alanzon, with a mighty Arme, (Full on the Helme, and parting halfe the Crowne) Gives Harrie a Sure Earnest; though the harme Was onlie Iron broke, and Gold cutt downe; Lopt Royaltie, is ever to the Bold Attemptor, worth his pains; the Brush-wood's gold. 221 Harrie, (whom Nature stor'd the Treasurie Of Courage) cannot live in Debt, wherfore Is able to defray: enrag'd doth flye And with Repeated Blowes doth knock of Scores; Greiv'd, that the Tallies of his Fame was Seene Notch't, with a Debt, when he could pay it in. 222 Hee beats him from his Horse; and haveing graspt His Helme, to teare a nearer way to Death, With Erect Arme, readie to give his last Dischardge; Alanzon tryes his Stocke of Breath When Armes had fayl'd; soe Life concern'd men Dead, The honour which they but endeavoured. 223 And yet ere Harrie struck, (to Spin his Fate To an ignobler End, then one soe Bold Had merited) he cryes (for Harrie, yet Knew not his Foe;) I am Alanzon; Hold; For Something Still Sprung from Necessitie To vrge a Reason why wee should not Dye. 224 But ere the King could Shew his Clemencye A ruder force breakes in; and (deafe to all C?mand) express what barbarous Crueltie Low-Seated minds, are proud in; thus did fall The brave Alanzon (worthy to engage A Royall Mercie) by a Vulgar Rage. 225 The King, who blames their over-cruell zeale, Could not reprove their Act in the mistake, But turnes away, and with new furie, fell Into the thickest Troopes; soe borne, to make An Expiation to Alanzon's Ghost, And cuts a Thousand Lives, for his one Lost. 226 As had in heat of Rage, some Heathen Rite Possest the King; and brave Alanzon went Too Naked, while an Arme was left to fight Of all their Host; a fame soe Eminent Might Sneake, in the next World, and want his wreath If not as liveing, waited on in Death. 227 The King prest deepe into their Troops, engag'd By many hands; and yet made out his way, Trampling the Mud of mixéd Brains discag'd From double fence; Shores to the bloodie Sea; Harrie, well-rigg'd, lanches into the Maine And cutts downe Rocks—men Arm'd—to make it plaine. 228 Drawne round by many, to repell their force His owne he knitts, and overbid them All; Yet Crouded Strength, stifles the fluent Course, Of many Glories; Harrie's must not fall Vnto this furie; though he fought it neare And more then Honour did concerne him here. 229 As when the Glorious Cæsar (who confest Nothing of Disadvantage) tells yo? where He fought for Honour; but at Munda, prest By many hands, in the Declininge Warre; Manag'd, by Pompeye's Sons; Necessitie To secure Life, gott him the Victorie. 230 So Harrie plung'd in the disordered Presse Of many Enimies; the fate of all That Day hung on his prime; his Sole release His Armie's freedome; and not Cæsar shall Outstrippe him here; for though he made noe noise Hee fought as hard, and for as great a Prize. 231 Hee peirceth through, with a devouring Edge; And to enlarge his Earth, ore-crouds the Ayre With Soules enfranchis'd, from the torne-vp Cage Of flesh, to fill new orbes, another where; And ore their Mountaine Carcasses, doth yet Trot Victorie, Anneal'd, in Blood &amp; Sweat. 232 Rapte with the like force, as had Iove's treble flame Strucke through the french, the English Squadrons flye, And breake downe Arméd Rankes, where ere they came Strange Terror fills the french; as (if it may lye In Paralel) singlie Slipt Greyhounds Chase Whole-Burnish't Herds, who never turne a face. 233 The Rout is Spred, the light-Arm'd English now Noe longer fight, but kill; the french perplext, With weight of Armes, are but halfe-Armed, tho' For Rampier'd feare, is but an Emmot's Nest; And though their Iron Shells, may fence a head, The Life lyes Backward; prick 'em, and thei're dead. 234 As Terror most who fled, the Standing few, (And properlie soe call'd) Stupor involves; Not liveing Men, but as fixt Statues grew; Polisht by English Swords; cut into halfes And parcell'd faces; as the hand but hitts To hew it out; and the dull Stone Submitts. 235 The Pride and Youth of France; (France which may Cope In Spirits noblie fir'd to all the World) Tooke Soudainly, amaz'd, let fall the hope Of any future Day; but wildly whirl'd From Wrath to Shame; deepe Surfeited in feare Sitt dropping to that hand, brings Death vn'ware. 236 As had they beene beyond the Thought of Death, Or rather Dead before, their Deaths they meet, Like Winter-Swallowes; Struck along, when heat Has left their Eyes and cold runs through their feet; Drop downe in fyles: Soe farre to Man forgot They had lost Selfe, they Dyed, and knew it not. 237 Stung with the Aspicke of invadeing feare, Or Spirit-froze, bound vp in bloodlesse veines; Like the late Navigators, who too neare The Pole, Chill'd Marrow, corded Ice remaines; Stand soe vnmov'd, till the returning Sun Bring on a Thaw; They, till warme Swords come on. 238 The English Sword had reach't the Tropicke now Of Victorie; and congeal'd Nature breakes A bloodie Streame, which ore the feild doth flow; The floating Bodies, promontoried, Reaks An Exhalation; when the Swords the fire Man, the Earth peirc't, Such Vapors Still aspire. 239 Wearie with many Slain, and manie fitt To meet the greedie Edge; the King, was Strucke Passionate in their fate; and ponders it, Something beyond their valour, or their lucke; Something beyond humanitie to prove Power fall'n soe vseless, weaknes made to move. 240 And while he calls the wide-Spred Squadrons in (Who each, besides the many deaths they gave Came treeblie Charg'd; as though their Troops had bin Bred from their Fame, to propagate) Some wave Over the Hilles a farre, to Harrie's Eye A Bodie knowne, of a fresh Enimie. 241 These when he saw, Hee gives a strict C?mand The Armie through; that All French Prisoners Whose honour was not binding, to the hand Of Instant Death must fall; Soe Tyrant Warres Insults, to enforce Clemencie a Crime; And for this Blood, some Cruel censure him. 242 Hee sends vnto the Troopes, to come and fight, Or quit the feild; Harrie's Meridian Sun Brookes not that Cloud of Warre to Dimme his Light; They Scatter of, and Harrie treads his owne Conquest Vninterrupted, as the Cleare Obiect of Light, adornes the Hemispheare. 243 The Sun (who quafft French blood, to Harrie's health And from his Bountie Surfeited,) knock's of And can noe more, but by a drunken stealth Slips to his Couch; plainly discovered, tho' A riotous Gvilt, and over-full, betrayes, Cups indegested; Flushing in his Face. 244 Asham'd to stagger 'long, ere Tethys yet Had laid her well-wrought Pillowes, for his Ease; Hee breakes the Portall, w?? vnsteddie feet, And Lolls to his owne Lamp-light in coole Seas; A Welcome Iulip, to dispell the Late Fumes of Distemper, and new Thirsts Create. 245 The French were fled, with Day, but such as fell To longer Night, who wait another Sun; Eyes lost to Earth, till the great Light reveale (T'enrich their Opticks) the cleare Vision Of Glorie; and from Atomes over-blowne Solder the Individuall, all its owne. 246 Victorie, now full Spred, flyes o're the feild Affronted, by noe face; the glorious King Drawes vp his force (her feathers;) over-toyl'd Yet full to all the Honour of her wing; Well-prun'd, to all her Pride; had she not lost Two Principalls in Blood, the full-S?m'd Host. 247 The Duke of Yorke, and valiant Suffolke, fell This Day; t'abate the ioy of Victorie; Some Slaine, of lower Name; but should wee tell The Number 't might appeare a Prodigie; And fate by Miracle, this Feild had given, Strucke, not by the Arme of Flesh, but hand of Heaven. 248 Let not the faméd Day at Marathon Where to Darius Power, Miltiades Drew the Athenians forth; and twelve to one Spred the feild ore with Soft-Spun Carcasses; Let not that Day, fame-Sung, fill vp the mouth Of Honour, Large enough, to Sound 'em both. 249 But when wee read that wonder, and have trac'd Historie, dry-foot; lodg'd stolne Honour, in A fortress lock't and barr'd, by the well-plac'd Authoritie of Time, in Words; noe Sinne, If our Endeavours, Scale the Charméd fort. And ring her out, full-Sack't in AginCourt. 250 Where Harrie, weake in Numbers, weake in force Lost in Supplies, but as he fought his wants; Wounded with famine through; or (what is worse Prest by the never-ceasing Combattants, Of Cold and Sicknes,) breakes the Gvives of fate And knitts her Cords, his Carkanet of State. 251 To all the Prowess of fresh Braverie Of France (the Lylly o'th' European feilds) Well-Arméd and at home; a Iollitie Sprung from vntoyléd Limbes; w?? over builds The Street of fortune, and at treble Rent Keeps a Balconie, in its Tenement. 252 As when an Age before Black Edward's hand Wav'd Victorie, in Poictiers Bloodie feild; And trod the french Plumes Dust; their Iron Sand And bloodless Carcasses, lay Mountains Pil'd; To the Same Odds, by the same Arme they fell And find the Climate by the Parallell. 253 The heat of this great Day, allay'd in Deaw's Of Victorie; the vnnumberd English Toyles Find Rest, in a full harvest; whilst the newes Of horrid Slaughters, on the french recoyles As their fled Troops, met whissing in the Bound, Gave their owne Terror, in a Treble Sound. 254 'Tis then too great, and farre beyond our Skill To measure out by Digits, Harrie's fame; When Glorie, falls to Audit, Wee sitt Still, And loose the Tryvmph, tooke vp in the Name; Skyrmishing Parties, to a Buffe-Coat, Sells Fame better Cheape; and from the few Slaine Tells. 255 But Noble Actions, where the Conquest Sitts Worthy a King, to owne, (whose vns?m'd worth Makes out his Crowne;) the Triviall obiect Slights Of Numbers Slaine; Big Glorie, brings not forth, Like Ratts, her many Long-Tayls; Numbers carrie Their Preiudice, but Monads never varie. 256 Let flagging Prose, over-wrought in the flight Take vp her Stand, and Nodde at riseing Game; Reckon how many Thousands fell in Fight, And vrge vncertainties; enough if fame (Flowne higher) Scorne to Stoope, in well-wing'd Verse, To Single Names, in fainting Canciliers. 257 But nobly cover with a Wing wide Spread; Feathers above 'em to Surround them All, Amated peepers; 'tis but over read, And makes report (fame's ill-got Issue) fall To Strife, when Number'd Names flock from the Quest And break the Covie, was moe then wee Gvest. 258 Had this Daies furie (though it were well fought By everie Noble hand) repriev'd but two, Harrie had made his Conquest more, and gott His Wishes in his Trivmph; Equall'd Soe His owne losse; for he lost Two, and the whole French Army, had but these to quit the Pole. 259 Brabant and brave Alanzon, form'd for more Of Life, in honour, then this Day could Spare; Let Yorke and Suffolke, hand these Heroes o're The Passage to new Life; Companions there Who here Devided fell; when the Smart's ore- Enlarg'd, Forgetfullnes doth Peace restore. 260 Let the full Victorie in mixéd Seas Of Blood flow in; and petty Champions Spring Like hopes, from like improbabilities, Till their taught Error, make them know this King; And then ascribe it only in his Fate, To Act those things for Men to wonder at. 261 His single Honour needs noe Fret of Names Worne as a Border, or Compartiment, To gl?mer ore the Tablet; narrower Fames In a pinch't Canvace, have a full Extent And sitt with Elbow-roome: th' wing of a Gnatt, Or'e-Spreads 'em All; Horse, Man, and Chariot. 262 Yet Harrie (noe ill husband of his owne) S?ms vp his men, to know at what expence Hee purchast Fame; cast vp the Totall knowne, Scarce from a Thousand, one; the blushing French (Who reckon it perhaps without their Host) Say but Three thousand English fell at most. 263 See now by Twilight, (when the Calme assur'd The feild their owne) how in the Search of Spoile The English are growne curious; gallant-Spurr'd, Hunt Rings and Iewells; and this Second Toyle Was the sweet Harvest; what before they had Mowen A feild, by Sheaves, they Thrash out now their owne. 264 Hee whose halfe-naked Armes would have beene glad From dung-hill Raggs, to make his Iacket out, Cannot be warme vnless he Bracelets had To tr?m his rugged wrest; now everie foot Leaps into better Leather, then was meant For Such a March; Brusht Gallants now they went. 265 Clad with the Spoiles; 'mongst the dead Carcasses They riot now; and hardlie Stoop t'vnrip A Doublet, or a Cassock to vnlace; The Cumber of two Suits where they may Sweepe Ten, with less trouble! Luck and All to Boot, They boast their Crownes, who lately begg'd a Groat. 266 Soe ore the feild full-sett, in wealthy flowers, Forraging Bees, extract their Golden Store; And Wanton with a warme Day; (pretty force) Nippe everie Bud, and whirle about for more; Not recking course-spun Thistles, w?? may give Warme Seats, but draw fine Deawes, to fill the Hive. 267 The Luckie Day, made it a merrie Night, Within the English Camp; all-open Eied, Clear'd with new obiects, Starrs dropt in their Sight; Let them believe it, who have never tryed, A certaine Truth, from what they have been told; It clears the Eyes, to be oft-rub'd with Gold. 268 And now they frolicke; Hee who laid in Pawne His Shirt, for halfe three farthings, cutt in Cheese; Knocks off the Subtler's tally with a Crowne, And Gage, to Boot, wash't for the Laundres's fees, The Hood he wore last Day (thick set with Clouts, To keep his head warme) 's cast to wipe his Boots. 269 And now the Imprison'd French, see to their cost Their last night's Scœne, by English Revellers Brought in a Second part; for 't wer almost Pitty, They'de lost the Act, which was soe theirs; Yet wee must doe 'em right; if the Action gott Applause, 't was English, but they gave the Plott. 270 Onlie the King (whose care was Courtisie) Inspiring better breath to Nobler Minds; Keeps a Calme Ioy, and by Civilitie Re Captivates Humanitie; more binds Then fetters Porus; bravely ask't a due In Warre, w?? doubly paid obleig'd him too. 271 Brave Orleans and Burbon, with the Rest, Lost to their freinds, themselves here found againe; To their Esteeme of Blood, and what had best Sett of titles, Courage; 't wer in vaine To frame Carresses of Discourse, and make The Royall Largess losse, by what wee Speake. 272 Day in the East far seene, well filletted With Azure, binds her golden Tresses in; And with blith Blushings, calls the Larke from Bed Who to the Camp, bon iour, bon iour, doth Sing; They take the Auspiere, and read some fate Of Good Speed, from the Little Advocate. 273 Now Callice opes her Gates, w?? a Strange Ioy, To receive Harrie, Victor; whom She mourn'd As Lost to Ruine. Soe the Pole (well nigh Buried in Night) Yawnes when the Sun's return'd And huggs him double, in a full Surprize Of Ioy, poures out her Rocks, as Men their Eyes. 274 This vnlook't for Thaw, (amaz'd in Passion) Had strucke the Towne; and from an ?mence Source Broke Suddenlie, makes varied Expression; Ev'n Teares, for Ioy; let Laughter the Course And C?mon Gratulation for dull Hinds Who know their Eyes desire but not their Minds. 275 Rigg'd faire from Callice, the vnruly Wind Curls the greene Waves, to mount the well-clad Pine. Fraile Stock of Honour! and the world may find Ev'n Glory, at a Leake; the invading Brine Prolls everie Seame; Death, but an Inch from fame Sitts. Ah! what Brazen Heart first Ships did frame? 276 Wrought (by impetuous Surges) into Clouds The fainting Billow Shrinks; a soon-trode Step! Threshold of Death! Doore to the darke Aboades! The Fleet now wrapt in waves, againe doth leape T'enforce her Zenith, Ayre; and strangely glides Through the vast Armes of those devouring Tides. 277 As when the Tyrant Goshauke (pleasure farre Beyond an Equall Flight) with Eager wing And Tallons Large, to Trusse a Wren, will stare With panting Furie; when the Little Thing Slipt from her wide Claspe, Cherrups once more free And breathles, leaves her Giant Enimie. 278 Soe lay the Fleet now Safe; pursuing waves (Long over-toyl'd) fall short and foame their Rage; Like Churlish Bulls, embost; whose Deaw-lap waves In Blood and Sweat, mixt Terror; and would wage A full Revenge, but many Cords restraine His Furie; Soe the Sea combatts its Chaine. 279 Thus Safe, pleas'd Soules, can sitt vpon the Shore; And from nere perill of a Storme-Toss't Barke Spring Ioyes, &amp; fancie out a pleasure more; Exalted Sence, even dulled by the Darke Lanthorne of fleet Imagination; which (Lost Forme and matter) 's in Privation rich. 280 And now the Trivmph treads our English ground; Feilds 'bove their Season proud! the cold-drench't Soyle Verdant with Glorie; let November Drowne Raw Seeds, expecting Life, from After-Toyle; Honour's a fruit, ripens in its owne Shine And the Sun meets 'em in a proper Signe. 281 The Sun (t'applaud Great Harrie in his Fame, And gratulate his Safe-returneing Bowes;) Had left Gay Mansions, and his March doth frame, T'attend the Shooter; be it prosperous T'affront drye Wizards; who impose yet, Boy Vpon the Bare-face, thus Arm'd to destroy. 282 Let the Chaldean (whose great Subtletie Vnravells all the Orbs, to Spin his owne Course Thred;) be wise reputed easilie; And Destinie, Crouch Suppliant, to his frowne; If Harrie's Bow (now Slack't) claime not event Of greater Things, to meet this Archer, bent. 283 The face of Heaven, whose well-drawne Alphabet He onlie may decipher, whose first hand Rais'd Characters Significant and fitt To all events, let not man vnderstand Or force the Secret, to involve the Stade Within his Sphære; a Structure Ptolomaid. 284 Dreame wee noe longer then; Let Harrie's Fate (Notch'd sure with Time) Spin to a Softer Bed; When Glories ripen him vnto the height Man may Arrive; when thrice three S?mers fled The Sun fit to receive him, from the Hand (As Pledge) of Virgo: his Cheif-Mourner Stand. 285 But my fleet Verse, (growne too Audacious) Has layd out Quarters, for an After-March; Soft Paces harbinger the Glorious Progresse of his full Raigne; the well-rais'd Arch Of Honour! where noe Act of Fame misplac't, Firms him, well-coupled, from the sure-lay'd Base. 286 Till through declivitie of Time, Truth fall From Fame; and (wadeing through Oblivion) Erect her vnsupplanted Arsenall; Pillars, where better Verse is All but One Iust harmonie, in Vertue; to noe Storme Liable; and writ Leav's can doubt noe worme. 287 Stand Harrie, meanly pourtraied, by our Zeale; Whose tumbled Character, tooke from the Life Has but resemblance; and the Ayre which fell To everie Line, by distant perspective Wee draw; that Glorie may have Lineaments Worthy her forme, and Truth her Ornaments. 288 The King (whose liveing Glories, only might Advance the Dead, and soe improve his owne) Lodges, brave Yorke, in the trivmphant Sheet Of Buriall; though Slaine not overcome; And rests his Ashes with full Obsequies In peacefull Vrne, warr-freed Securities. 289 Quiet, whose warfare ended, goes to Kisse Eternall Peace; and Ioy, in holy Shades; Cons?mated in Glorie, rapt in Blisse; Where force assailes not, nor where Time invades; Where still live Olives mixt w?? holy Bayes Fall to the Conquerour, to Crowne his Peace. 290 Like Rites perform'd to (him who like him fell) Suffolke; old Chaucer's late inheritance Proud to entombe him; as the first-S?m'd Quill Of England, not enough were to advance Eweline; an Athens, if his Pen that Fame May merit; Sure this Sword, asserts that Claime. 291 Now sett a while in Rest; (to the Pursuit Of further Claime;) he fitts himselfe at home; The willing English, ioyntly Contribute T'advance Supplies; each pleas'd to heare it, from His Neighbour, how the feild at Agincourt Had rais'd the frame, which they might well Support. 292 For Glorie pricks, the retchles Soule, who Spins His Ease, in fatt Securitie; the Bloat Face of Rusticitie, Smuggs, looking in A Mirrour; Something hidden lifts the Thought To Noble Actions, when they heare 'em told, And Hee who Sneaks his part, will praise 'em bold. 293 Now (when the Campe disperst in Cottages) Briske, Single Leaders, (Holiday discourse) Enflame home-sitters by long Pedigrees Of their Atcheivments, 't may be thought of force T' invite, whom Feathers tickle; or betwixt Their fears and fancies hang, to goe the next. 294 Their Sports, have Glorie; when the Parish throng To see their Active Youth, their Arrowes draw; And Shout, the firmer Pyle; They laid along C?ment their owne; 't wer brave, (as when wee saw The Day at Agincourt) t' have had your Shouts When the French Army h?m'd vs, moveing Butts. 295 Where not a Silver Iyng, or Pigeon, fell To Pay the Markman; with his hire made out In Kisses, from his Lasse, hee'd done soe well; These are faint Victories; to kill a Clout; Alas! you pore; and as the Marke yo? Ayme Worthily near the Prize; and may the Name. 296 By this same Bow (sayes one) this fellow Shaft The Duke of Brabant fell; my right man (As tough a Lad as Drawes) the Helmet Cleft Of Bouciqualt, and his fine Tipstaves wan; Another, that I knew (perhaps hee's knowne Vnto you all) kill'd great Chattillion. 297 And thus w?? mighty Names familiar growne Coustome brings an acquaintance to their thought Of Something to be said, could not be knowne; And not a Brave man fell but he was faught By some knowne Comrade; and God bless his Grace The King was made Eye-witnes how all was. 298 This puts an edge vpon the Eager Youth For better Clothes and Coyne; for yet some Crownes Were to be seen, might make their Tales, seeme Truth; Cash-catchers is a Trade to ravish Clownes, And Barmye Brains huffs vp the rotten Paist Made apt to mould, take hot Brains in their hast. 299 These (though our Sport in Numbers, and perhaps Your laughter at our wast of Time) wrought more With village-haunters, then the Subtle traps Of Pay, or Press-money; they dance and rore The expectation of a Muster; where They 'nroule themselves, Gentlemen volunteire. 300 But while these low and higher proiects drive On the designe, Victorie now at mint Wants Currencie, and many hands must give Stamp ere it passe, and yet noe Treason in 't; Nay soe can Princes vse their Royaltie What was to give, is Treason to Denye. 301 But Harrie doubts noe Traitor, to his will; Soe much a Monarch overminds what they By Loans and Subsidies bring in, to fill His Coffers, kept their owne t' another Day, Or layd out Purchase, for Inheritance; Here a Denier, buyes a towne in France. 302 Hell-bred Division, left Cimerian Caves, And long had trivmpht, in Europea Ayre, From Bosphor Straits, to the wide Sea, w?? Laves High Calpè westward; from the Head which farre Gave Light in Southerne Towers, to vtmost Thule; The Vassail'd Earth was rent, vnder his Rule. 303 Worthy the Care of Sigismund; who (least This Batt should Roust, where once his Eagle prun'd,) Timely endeavors Peace; the Church was prest, And treble-Headed now, for treble-Crown'd Appear'd a Monster; Schisme's a newer name Then Lay-division, but in Truth's the Same. 304 The Emperour labours vniversall Peace, And rear's Religion fainting in her wounds; How glorious may he stand! who can expresse His Faith, well-acted? 'Tis but as it Sounds; What Church may be; Hee Sinns not to his Creed, Who that whole Article doth vnion read. 305 After Sollicitations; (as the maine Ioynt in the frame of Europe, now misplac't) Hee puts a nearer Hand to Sett againe England and France; England, (who late had prest France w?? a Heavy hand,) as now growne high Hee personally invites, to vnitie. 306 With pressing reasons, pious Cautions, Hee vrges Peace; he breakes vp the Affaire Of Christendome: how their Contending Crown's Made way to the Invador; and the Warre Prompted the Leering Turke, their Rage to waite His Conquest: Christian Swords fight Mahomet. 307 And had not France, (while yet the Anvile beat To forge a glorious Peace) new Billowes rais'd For other Irons; and the old fires heat Provok't againe, Harrie, (ne're to be prais'd Beyond his Merit) had like Glorie won, For making Peace, as Hee for Warre had done. 308 But Great ones, (where concern'd Prærogative Whett's Passion) vse the Edge of Violence; Blunt Reason, as an vseless Toole they give; Old Shopkeeper, with rusted Conscience! Pietie laid to Sleep; or might they Catch Ev'n Innocence, they'd put him in the Cratch. 309 Thus vniversall Rage, has Spread the Earth; And Kings but Labour to Supplant themselves; An Embrion Fort, assail'd, drawes on a Birth Of Province Enmitie; each Nation Delves Her owne Destruction; as the Globe were Sett Great Rattle vnto Kings, to play with it. 310 Whilst (as I said) the Imperiall Influence Ravish't great Harrie's Soule with peacefull Deawes; And wrought dispatches, by Ambassage hence, To knit, with France; France vnderhand pursues The Advantage of the Warre to nicke him out Ere he could prize his Chance; False Dice may doo't. 311 The Maine was Harflew; and a cunning hand Now threw att All; their quick-silver was dampt, By a fresh Bale cast in; the Gamesters Stand Then to another Chance; and what they can't Get by Surprize discover'd, they sitt downe Gamsters resolv'd; and thinke to take the Towne. 312 Sigismund now, (who had beene Arbiter And thought to part 'em, at an Equall Stake) Blushes, to find the Cheat; and doth referre The rest to fortune; yet that he may make Himselfe a Saver, one way (at least Safe In a faire Gamester) hee goes Harrie's halfe. 313 Harrie puts out a Navie, to the French- Ioyn'd Genoese; and after some dispute Bores their Fleet through, and many a vessell sinks Rode Gallant, but ere while; and run it out To releive Harflew straitned; but ere they Put into Harbour, the Seige drew away. 314 Whilst these Things thus, the craftie Burgundie Slips to Advantage everie severall way; Comes in, to Harrie ioyns, then doubtfullie Hangs in a Truce; that it were hard to Say Were this King's-Fisher hung vp by the Bill But he as the Wind Chang'd, would find it Still. 315 Harrie pursues his Claime, and from the Base Himselfe had layd in France, erects his Pile; And Scorn's the Slipperie Loam, was apt to wash, Nor frost-proofe; only Glost his worke the while; Burgundies Varnish, was a Pott sett by; With his owne Colour, Harrie, workes as high. 316 And from the Threshold, which himselfe had laid, Hee leaps into the inner-Roomes, of France; The greatest Fort of Strength, w?? Neustria had, Submitts its Name to His; Aumebelliers thence, He easilie getts; These, w?? their fees, in France Were the first-made English Inheritance. 317 From hence to Caen, well fitted for a Seige; And firme to the French Crowne or obstinate To Harrie's offers; till the fatall Edge Of Ruine, fill'd their streets; as had the fate Of Harrie made them stubborne; that he might For a more mercie, have an obiect fitt. 318 When Rage, the Streets (warre's hasty huswifry) Was Sweeping vp; and everie Souldier made Sword-Problemes, inhumanitie; as why Should Man, Man, and Dirt, Dirt before them layd Cumber the streets, Ash-heapes, and fill the Towne: Thus ridd away their Mucke, and reare their owne. 319 But Harrie ere they more proceed, begins A Better Lecture; Soe heard in his Schoole Of Warre and Obey'd with a Reverence To everie Article; as to a Rule Some Antique Sect of Sages had it writ; Firme Ipse Dixit they assevere it. 320 Slaughter was exact, and barbarous Insolence Curb'd by the Royall Mandate; he whoe well Had thought a street his part, a little Since Sitts idle on a Shop-board, not to Sell, But gvard the Warehouse to the owner's vse; Or y? Kings pleasure, for y? King might chuse. 321 While Harrie thus abroad, the Scotts at Home Were busie Neighbours; and with a great Power Make a full inroad; and that they might come To rellish Discontents from the rude Ore Of fallacy, (w?? brooks noe Crusible, To heat it vp;) boast Mettall, set of well. 322 Poor Richard, (yet againe, twice buried Must set of Discontents; the Scotts, must bring Our Enimie) our Peace; ne'r may 't be said But from a better Hand, we got our King Almost to Treason! better Rebell be Against them, then by them taught Loyaltie. 323 Oldcastle watcht the Hower, and to their Pulse Beats regular; for thus by Magnetisme Bodies may worke, where the same Load-stone Rules Conferring Needles; be 't the Aphorisme Of whom you will, to contradict the Gloss, The Text is true, and wee have found 't with Losse. 324 But OldCastle is tooke; the Scotts afraid Rather then forc'd, dispers'd; &amp; happie Man Wanted his Armes, might in some lighter Plad 'T Escape the English Sword; for there was than A Bridge at Sterling; and 'twas still the fruite Of a Scottch Conquest never worth pursuite. 325 This hindred not, Soe potent in their Armes And prest in dutie, were the English then; Harrie proceeds in France by many Storms; Normandy ne're Subdued, he drawes his Men To the Strong towne of Fallais; of more strength, The Castle, longer kept; both tooke at length. 326 And now a formall Seidge he layes to Roan, Chains vp the River, to prevent Releife; For by necessity it must be won; Patience in Great Attempts c?mends a Cheife; Pent Numbers, (though in Stone Secure they Lye) Eate out their Rampiers to the Enimie. 327 While before Roan, the King was Sett; to treat Two Prelates came; and (if wee soe may Speake;) Offer'd the Pax, might reconcile that Great Debate in hand; but Harrie doth not Reck The Painted Kisse; vnless he were dismiss'd Absolv'd in Right, to what he should insist. 328 They brought the Painted Apple, for his part In Paradice; France truck't, for a faire face; 'Twas a cold bargaine, though the Bed might bear't; An Armefull for a Conquest! Say it was Worthy the Change, as from her Beautie, you O're-prize the Bargaine; Harrie'l have that too. 329 And though the Representative Committ Rapture vpon his heart, in well-drawne Smiles; And Seem'd to vrge, or Did, he cannott flitt Meerlie to tread the Ice of Love; the Toyles Of former Glories; in a Petty-Coat Wrapt, a night fardle; to his Fame forgott. 330 Such Smoothnesses may Act in limber youth; And Soft Imagination may contrive, From softer Sence, Drab Beautie, to a growth Soe exquisite, ev'n Passion might derive Its Generation, Pure; soe easie led T'vndresse ourselves! fir'd Blood, ev'n brought a-Bed. 331 But Harrie's Glories trode the height of Love Subservient to his Nobler, iuster Claime; A fold within his Honour, yet above The Mercate of a Dower; how may wee frame His Character to Wonder, Iust? whose Eyes Were wounded through; could Love, &amp; yet be wise. 332 After long Seige, (while Harrie trench't 'em round) The Towne to Parly came; Even famine Spent An Ile of Ratts! Men to their Pye-Crust bound, And pickled Beife; worne out; to Beanes &amp; Stint Of meaner Pulse; High Sauces, Appetite Provoke; French Sallades here would fit yo? right. 333 The Miter'd Prelate of our larger See, (Empower'd by Harrie) offers Articles For their Resignment; (the glad Towne sett free) Condition to their Bellyes; &amp; now meales Expect againe, nor may wee blame 'em, if From such a hand they take the Bread of Life. 334 The Towne Submitts; &amp; Harrie enters now Old English right; let William's Dust be pleas'd (Poorely interr'd;) that his Cheif Citty, grow Full-bloom'd, to the Old Stocke; Normandie Seiz'd By English Armes! from the Ducall Stem Conquer'd this Ile; which now quits Scores w?? them. 335 Soe fast he goes in Victorie; as when Full Tides, drove on by windes, prevent their houre; The French (like drowsie Marriners) but then Offer a Sayle; Harry (full-Spred in Power,) Makes in to Anchor, Conference; &amp; there Could they Ioyne Trafficke, the harbour, Peace, is neare. 336 Here from the Life, to what Embellishment Nature's cleare Pencill may give Flesh &amp; Blood; Harrie may iudge, his Choice; approve, what Sent Pleas'd in a Picture; ravisht as She Stood To vndertake his Conquest; whilst soe faire A Fort, holds out; worthy to end the Warre. 337 This Ladie form'd for Glorie; (if wee may Vrge thin Idæas vnto Substances;) Worthie our Harrie's Love, his hopes to say A founded Empire; worthy, all wee gvesse Princes (by Conquest or Alliance) frame T'invite the Genius, or exalt the Name. 338 Therefore the Treatie broke; w?? greater Speed Hee flies, in Conquest; that at length, he may With easie Armes, take in the White and Red Tower; that or nothing; he can hardly Say Above his Fate; as had he graspt the Wheele Of Destinie, and could her Spoaks compell. 339 Harrie (whose March progressive victorye Flew ore the Face of France) to all that State Makes vp Approaches, to the Enimie He fearéd most; but, written Fortunate To all Proceedinges; Beautie must resigne To Honor's Seige, where Fortune drawes the Line. 340 'Twas now in Treatie; and Rocke-firméd hearts; (Whose out-workes, Flesh and Blood, Soft Earth give way To the Well-Planted Batterie rais'd by Arts Yet vndiscovered;) Shrinke; what may wee Say In honour of him? whose great Power Subverts Not Townes &amp; Castles, but Stormes Eyes, &amp; Hearts. 341 Beautie, (whose polish is but from itselfe, Lives in its Lustre, free from other force) Scornes a Mechanicke Grinder; whose Sole Wealth Excells his Industry; and to the Course Hand (yet vnpeirc'd) retains the forme, its owne; For only Glorie, gives Impression. 342 Harrie had rais'd his owne Effigies A well-grav'd Medall, worthy of her heart; The Iewell only might stand nere her Eies, And keep its Lustre; Royall Loves impart Strange flame, &amp; catch, like Rayes; wee hardly yet (Dull Sinners) may Arrive to fancye it. 343 'Tis soe concluded, as Affection, Springs to that mutuall height, in the Decree Of Providence; the Two are now made one, By a sure knot; but what Divinitye Can marrie Crownes &amp; States? here ne'r the lesse Long Enemies, are more then freinds, one flesh. 344 How Happie doth the glorious Chaplet Sitt, Where the consenting flowers, adorne one Head! A Marriage Wreath, &amp; yet more State in it Then Numa's fyllet; if they were soe Wed What Destinie vnbidden, Should divorce The tye, soe Soone? for Better &amp; for Worse. 345 Passe the Solemnitye; and if yo? please Contract her Dower, beyond the Empirie To her owne Eyes; the many Articles There Seal'd in her, the true-S?m'd Inventory, And Adde this Little, (if it may Advance;) The King of England's now the Heir of France. 346 Th' incenséd Dolphin (as wee cannot Blame Iust Blood, Deprived) dissassents; 'tis yet Vncancell'd Nature; Birth Supports a claime Though force invade forc'd Lawes, t'abolish it; 'Tis a strange Gutt, that for a Gruell Meale Resigns her Birthright, Nature's fee will Sell. 347 But (ah) what may an over-weakned Arme Expresse of Power? a Prince is S?new-Shrunke, And Crampt, betwixt a Title, to keepe warme And Cold Convenients; when the State Drunke With their owne Potion, (like those vaine-made fooles) Transfer Prærogative by their owne Rules. 348 The Dolphin at a Distance, (to his Power) Purveies his Right; &amp; to the Double Claime Of Harrie, casts in his owne Scale; s?? bore To many minds, a better weight; though lame Affection grovells; &amp; Erected Power Pleads better Man, Imaging Man, Soe more. 349 The Dolphin keeps aloofe, while Harrie in His well-acquiréd Title was confirm'd, By one ioynt vote; the Mouth, State; the Trine Concurrent Breath of Forme thus vnion term'd; What hinders but himselfe make out the rest? Indeed he wrought to All what they express't. 350 In this assent (his forméd Title, more Pressing, with many minds;) his Armes pursue A double claime, Strength doubled; where before His only Title wrought, Hee bringeth now A Right, t'assert him worthy of their Crowne; To his Demand, their full Donation. 351 Monstreau &amp; Sens, are forc'd if wee may play With words, who doubts the monster sence subdued By such a Reason? and the Quibble may Sett better of if it were vnderstood; The Light is Easye, &amp; the Shadow brings Life; one full draught, in Both, to pourtray Kings. 352 Yet to his Armes &amp; Title opposite Sein-planted Melun stood; and was not Shooke From her Allegiance to the Dolphin's Right; Nor Harrie's Hoast, his Fame, nor yet to looke Vpon their King, a Party to his Claime, May force, or Tempt them, to another Name. 353 Whilst to assault and to repell, each sought, His owne advantage; (and the breath of fire Was only interchang'd from minds, too hott To mingle calmer;) that alone Ayre Tormented, might not nearer image Hell, Then the Cold Center, to their minds they fell. 354 The Mine, an Arch of Glorie, Somewhat, which The Sun n'er Saw; merits as great a Light, And made a greater, when our Harrie meets Fierce Barbazon; who thus engravéd fight The Quarrell Single: here if either fall The Sexton's pay'd; for Death is Buriall. 355 While their Armes act, their Eyes attend their Armes, With an Officious Light, and force some Day; Enough to gvide their Rage, which over-warmes Them, narrow pent, to make too long a stay; Both knowne, they part; Soe much their owne Selfe-flesh, A Resurrection, cannot make the Peace. 356 Strict to their Choice, by dire Necessitie At length compell'd, (when Famine many weekes Had eaten force;) the Towne Resignes, to be At Harrie's mercy; Iustice only seekes (As in the Rest, late tooke) for such as Stand Burgundy-Branded; victims to her hand. 357 'Mongst whom the valiant Barbazon, was found An Accessarie; he who stood the wrath Of Harrie, yet vnwounded, vnderground In open Ayre, is wafted, by his Breath; Harry, the Rule for Both, can but afford Exception; that Breath Royall's the best Sword. 358 First yo? must know young Burgundye (incens'd With Charles the Dolphin, for his Father's Death) Strikes in with Harrie; and a League commenc't Of future freindship, by a Solemne faith; The King (to obleige this Act,) vnto his claime Vowes Vindication to his Father's Name. 359 Charles Viscount Narbon, here, w?? Tannegvy And Barbazon, were gvilty in his Blood; 'Twas too Apparent; Barbazon must Dye; Murder admits of noe Repreive; he stood Condemn'd alike; They Dye; but he in fate Once worth his Armes, now worth his Advocate. 360 'Twas vrg'd, (from an old Cannon, in the Law Of Armes) noe Prince, for any cause, might take Life, where it once ioyn'd hazard Sword to draw In Combat, with that Prince; thus though Arms Speake The Gallant Barbazon, they are mistooke: See him noe further, he lives by his Booke; 361 Thus Great in France, that England may not want Ioy in his Glories; haveing set the way Hee leaves the Affaires of France, in management To Clarence, &amp; for Love allots One Day; That Wondring Loyaltie, at home may Prize His Conquest; halfe read, in his Queen's faire Eyes. 362 And with the verge of Royaltye, impales Her brighter Temples; Beautie combatting In many Rayes; Amazement but Enthralls Eye-Charm'd Spectators; let wide Glorie Sing Vpon an Ivorie Cloud, pleas'd Iuno' Stait; With Armes and Eyes, Cross-Dappled, Black &amp; White. 363 Beautie and Glorie! what high fiction wrought T'adorne that Goddesse? with more Lustre flow Here, to full Truth; Armes to w?? Fancie, nought Can adde but the cleare heaven of her owne Brow; And that vnfathom'd world, w?? for her Sake Shrinks, to move greater, in that Zodiake. 364 Let the rude Noyse of Bells enchant Dull Ears, And Bon-fires baffle Eyes w?? high-rais'd Light; Condvits run Claret; and the Ballad verse Spoyle Pageantrie, worse Sung, then 't was to Sight; While Cittie-Liveries, (gvessing by the Boast What either meant) resolve it to their Cost. 365 What Iunkets were prepar'd, what rare devices; Who Sewer, waited, or who Carver Stood, Stow may informe; who Ginger-bread in Slices Distributs, &amp; warme Wafers casts abroad; As he had tooke Royall Solemnities Iust to the Measure of the Wine &amp; Spice. 366 Let not these Marchpane follies Dull your Sence To better rellish; in this poynant State Might give an Edge to Witt, at less expence; Soe save the Ipocras, and Candy Plate; But since perhaps we've drawne yo? thus from home You'd loath to part w?? out a Sugar Plum. 367 Tak't a Court Largess; full Certificate To all the neighbourhood; y'ave once beene there; Fit for a Lecture-Day, to Wonder at; Transplanting Paradice, and six dayes cleare Gott to the Bargaine; yet well housewiféd This minuite's Sight a weekes Discourse may Spread. 368 Wee dare not Sport his Glories, though wee could Frame better Things vnto his Entertaine; And Haile him Cæsar! Lungs, in volant Wood! Like the Artifice of Regio Montane; What boots Mechanicke Costs? Royaltie more Enlivning, glads hearts dead &amp; Lost before. 369 The Ceremonie of all hearts, give Ioy Vnto his Welcome; all Eyes, throng to meet Him, their Life-giveing Light; where Loyaltie Keepes peace, w?? wonder, they make equall feet; And Kings from such a Congee plainly meant Enioy by Gvift, that Name, which was but lent. 370 The Scotts (this while) Shut in the Penury Of their owne feilds, and finding noe way ope To annoy England, as an Enimie; Goe where they may abroad, t'impeach the hope Of English Armes; &amp; w?? fresh Aydes, to France, Their Rancour in the Dolphin's Claime advance. 371 And w?? the French ioyn'd, thought to have Surpriz'd Clarence, vnware; but Bodies, in their hast Betray their Speed, in Sweat; Some droppers Seiz'd, Discover the Intention; Clarence fast Bestirrs himselfe; Stratagem interchang'd, He thought to Snap 'em, ere their men were rang'd. 372 And did soe farre distract 'em; though the odds In Number of their Men, not to be Spoke, Might hemme him, they trudge off; where the aboads Of Peace should be, is fill'd with noyse &amp; Smoke; Warre, put to Sanctuarie! who but beleives This house of Praier, was now a Den of Theives? 373 Th' alarum now through all the Quarter runs; And Brave Buchanan, arméd, to the Bridge Drawes vp his Men; Clarence; (who saw at once His Danger, &amp; his hopes) alights, to engage Them with a nearer force; Bucquanan ioyns, And single Combat with the Duke maintains. 374 As (if high fiction, vnto greater Truth Wee here may bring) the God of Warre, once made Fight, with the big-arm'd Diomed; &amp; Both Like Gods, in Valour, Men, by Wounds betray'd Themselves to be; &amp; after long dispute The Man more God, the God himselfe Subdued. 375 Soe after many Blowes, 'twixt these two Cheifs Ayds pressing in, Clarence, to death was gor'd; Not Diomed's Arme, struck Mars but y? Releifs Nigh Pallas lent; &amp; if the great Soul roar'd, As feeble God, from brazen lungs, the Smart Damps his Divinitie, with Tender heart. 376 Thus early Clarence fell; ere Salisbury Who led the Rere, came vp; yet to repaire The losse, (if reparation may be) He beats them off, &amp; what was left but Aire Of Clarence, brings away; Thus Honour rakes The feild, &amp; for thin Shadowes, hazardes Stakes. 377 Harry resents this Losse to all the Tye Of Blood &amp; Honour; &amp; with prosp'rous Speed Crosses to Callice; chained Victorie Attends him everie Step; for when wee read The Wonder of his Raigne, his Prowesse Sp?n'd Fate; to make Glorie only worth his hand. 378 He speeds releifs to Paris; &amp; makes on His march in Conquest; of some holds were lost Hee wants noe Trivmph, whose fame doth fore-run Such expeditions; let not Paris boast She gave one to his Entrance; Glorie Scarce Is worth the Shew, Safetie, not Harbingers. 379 Their owne Securitie to Harrie's Arme Offers Instructions, fitt for such a State; Citties are Wise; 'tis but to sitt more Warme; They offer out, their Tapestrie &amp; Plate; And lay their Treasure to the hand, Secures It in the Chest, &amp; them in Ease &amp; Furres. 380 But Harrie, (whose high Constitution, Had noe delight in Miniver Respects But to their Duty &amp; the Occasion;) Nor lov'd Court-Sweets, nor Sweet-Spun Dialects; Quits both, &amp; Loves the Toyle of Glorie; Proud To have his Feild-Bed Curtain'd with a Cloud. 381 The Dolphin, (in his Absence) with small Forts Made merrie; as he had Drawne in the Clue Of Empire, to his Looms; but quicke reports Of Harrie's Power, broke the Thred, as he drew It, to his Bottome, and now run a-ground Is to begin, as he had never wound. 382 Yet with his broken End, he playes a while, Till Time run out his Sport to Wearines; Harrie pursues new Glories, in fresh Toyle; And beyond Conquest Sought, Sought how to expresse Himselfe a Brother; thus, when Nature Springs Passion, as Kings the world, She vassalls Kings. 383 Nor let it wrong his Temper, if he might Be thus transported; let the Phlegme of Lead Nourish its yeilding Bodie, &amp; give weight To sullen Earth; each Man is Mettall made, And to the ruling Salt, he must Submitt; This Pickle relishes both ware &amp; Witt. 384 As when a Pard, who filcht the Lion's right Evades the Terror of his Shininge Eyes; The Dolphin moves, to Harrie; he may fight To Walléd Town's, but noe feild-Army nigh; 'Tis the sad fate of Kingdomes almost Spent, T'enforce by Garrisons, Selfe Punishment. 385 Harrie drawes vp to Meaux; and plants a Seige To their Strong Walles; in well-wrought Trenches Safe He layd his Army; what the varied Edge Of Wrath may Act soe neare was done; the Brave Assailants, Scale &amp; Delve, whilst they within Make good their Walls, Sally &amp; Countermine. 386 Whilst here he lay, by an Express came word His Queen was brought a-Bed, in Happie Hower: How Time &amp; Place Elude! ev'n Kings are Stirr'd With Superstitions; Harry (who gave more Of fate in his Transmissive veins, then both Could worke,) yet wraps the Infant in that Cloth. 387 And whether full to antique Prophesie, Or some new Fancy of Devining Feares; He sadly said 'Tis done; firme Destiny Determin's Glory, to my narrow Sphære; And this poore Child, borne to a longer Raigne Shall eas'ly part w?? what our Conquests gaine. 388 Was it my Chardge, in deepe fore-sight of ill, To forbid only Windsor to his Birth? And it was Chose: Well, be it as it will; Another Age repents what this brings forth; I may not See the Event, but yo? (who live To Struggle in those Tides;) will then beleive. 389 He paus'd; &amp; many worthy thoughts came in T'afflict his Soule; but let not Honour Dye Convulst with Seeing to Another's Sin; Our Errors make out Truth, in Destiny; Or be there none wee idly Shun or Chuse Propos'd Indifferents: &amp; ourselves abuse. 390 Harrie yet Spreads himselfe; for while he lay Full at the Seige, the Dolphin whirles the Coast; And at Advantage Slips the Empty way; Tooke Auranches: hardly tooke but lost; For the King (Sensible of such a Maime) Gives Salisbury some Men, who took't againe. 391 He the mean while, prest neare to force this Towne And tooke it in the Trap they for him sett; Brave Offemonte betray'd &amp; now their owne; Not vnto promise, for they feign'd but yet They wanted but his Presence to assure The Towne meer English, &amp; him Conquerour. 392 But he was tooke in the Attempt; &amp; ere 'T might be discuss'd within, it wrought without; Force takes the Advantage of their fraud &amp; feare; And in the instant storm's whilst the Men sought To save more then themselves: Convey their goods Vp to the Castle; but repent their Loads. 393 The Treasure was their Life, (how Iust is Fate To Punish Men;) &amp; now together hugg'd, Torments them, 'twixt their wishes &amp; their weight; The Soldier tumbles what the owner Tugg'd; Yet to their Choice, perhaps they rather fell, Dye all at once, then Drop away Peice-meale. 394 But that noe Time be lost, what the Dispatch Of Armes would warrant, in a full pursuite; The King Plants to the Castle; layd a Breach Wide to their fears &amp; open to his foot; But yet advis'd, vnto their Safetie gives Conditions, &amp; they yeild, to Save some Lives. 395 The Noblest Naméd in it were to Dye; Some stood to Mercy, vnder Caution; And Life (where nothing to the Contrarye Might be Alleadg'd) the rest; 'tis hardly knowne To what wild Frensies, honour will pursue Her Ends; &amp; wee must call it Iustice too. 396 The Bright-Eyed Queen had brought fresh Levies in, But fate forbids; what more? if Harry toyl'd The Warre in health, for what vxorious Sin Is he now Strucke? &amp; full in Conquest foyl'd? A Lover! Fatall to great Names; the Blood Provok'd, intends more then it vnderstood. 397 Thus when the Great in Warre, the Wise in Peace, Had humbled France, a Subiect to his Name; Had Citties won, &amp; layd out Provinces, Mixt Fees; &amp; Sate by Conquest to his Claime, He fell, as Hee, who Sought the promist Land But Saw it; yet their Conduct was his Hand. 398 As Xenophon, when he had pourtrayed Cyrus, to all the Glories of a King; Fitts him with Dying words; may what he Said Not misbecome our Harrie, now the wing Of Death had Chill'd his Lipps; &amp; ere he Dye Wrapt Silence fills him with new extasye. 399 Retir'd Calme Thoughts, Such as old Hermets keepe (Perhaps as a Reserve) to their Last hower; Or else inspir'd, (when that Eternall Sleep First Seizeth Sence) t'accost the Breathing Power, Who manageth the Soule; &amp; Scours the Rust Of fraile Affections, Earth &amp; Passions Dust. 400 Entranc'd to glorious vision in the flesh, He lay, fitt for a greater; &amp; receives The Flame in Silence, which doth more Expresse Then words well-Chosen; Language (w?? Deceives The World,) &amp; Men (who Speake it as their thought) Vanish; &amp; full Cleare Dialects are taught. 401 While the French Dread his prosecution Of a full Conquest, as Design'd; that heat Which knew noe fire beyond it, taught too Soone, Is wasted vp; Life fled; &amp; all those great Atcheivements, left to Feoffees; whilst his Son An Infant, makes way for fate, c?ming on. 402 Thus mighty Harry, (to whose Arme, the Earth Was narrow) in a Corner, Quiet rests; Swords (the ill Survey of the World) Set forth From what Mistakeing Rules, Empire Consists And Ages After; take the measure out By Death's Geometrie, vnto a Foot. 403 But wee may erre &amp; Doe; bold quills assume Prerogative, &amp; bind vp Maiestie In Numbers, than the Grave a narrower roome. May his great Name, Enlarge our Poesie, Whose Vrne is Honour's Shrine; &amp; let the faint Pilgrims in valour, Offer to this Saint. The End. Crastini Animarum. 1650. And had not the great cloud, w?? blears the Sight Of Iudgment firme to Truth, yet hung; we might Have Sung it louder; w?? would now but make Noyse, in a mist, to aggravate mistake. The Sun (whose heat gives Life &amp; Light, makes bold Earth, &amp; from Earth, the Creatures manifold) Is shrunke into the Socket; &amp; we now (Lost to his flame) can scarce hope when, or how He from that Dismall Tropicke, shall repasse, That we may live, in Light, as once it was; Till when, our Numbers (destin'd to more) Creeps to a corner, at a Candle-Hower; And a few freinds, may rub (with patience) Six Stanza's ore; to pay the vast Expence Of Witt (forbidden Traffique) with a Smile; As were that worth, our Braines, &amp; Midnight Oyle; Nay those Great Names we Sing, who doe not live In fouler Sheets then other Poets give; (As wee may calmly vrge) must Sneake to Fame. Bold Truth, is Treason; Loyalty quite Lame; Let their Names live to better Dayes; &amp; bring A Quill as zealous, to assert the King; But let not Hucksters, bring such Glory in. His Father's fate has harden'd them in Sin; Oh, 'tis too true! &amp; though we cannot Spell What Destiny has writ; yet I must tell Aloud my fears; perhaps (too true) his Fate From thence noe good; I tremble when I Say 't; But that he may (by other means restor'd) Adorne the Throne, I will not doubt; noe word Is big enough, for Glory; verse (which Spanns Nature's whole Sphere, &amp; her proportions) Perhaps is yet too Short; Some Actions teach Fancy, a flight beyond her height &amp; reach; What Great Things Vertue may, Sworne to his fame I need not give; but men shall Seeke my name And Charg'd with many Laurels; what they Scarce Admit in Chambers, shall fill Theaters; And even these numbers, who to fame are lost, Perhaps may merit, what some others boast. The End. 1650. Idyllia. Idyllia: The Distemper. A Poeme Revised, &amp; enlarged By the Author. Humanum curare genus quis terminis vnquam Præscripsit? nullas recipit Prudentia metas. The Illustration. This Globe, (one equall Sphære at first) not pleas'd In her well-giv'n forme, this Altar rais'd; Where Ianus Power, the Tirrannous High-Preist Once but a Man, now Monarchs o're the Rest; And fellow-Creatures vassail'd, tumble downe To Either Face or Hand, the Axe, or Crowne; The Scepter, or the Fasces, where they Strike (Heavy to Death) Officiate alike; Humanity enforc'd; the Exalted Horne Of Reason, led away by Rage, t'adorne The Shambles, where in Hecatombs they lye Victims vnto Impossibilitie. The Numen Sought, is Libertie, a meere Brain-wheele, to torment Men; Distemper here In Government, grinds Man, the Dust of Earth To knead him o're againe; this later Birth Enioyes that warmth of Libertie, his Life, W?? had been sought, by Temples formative; Nothing makes Man a Slave, but to impart The Power to another's Hand, from his owne Heart; Which Fortified, breakes y? strong-pleated Charms Of What they meant, to Live in Softer Armes. Idyll I. Wee are but where wee were seaven yeares before; On the same Ocean, &amp; as farre from Shore; The Impacificke Seas, of our owne feares And Iealousies; noe Land in Ken appeares; Wee rigg'd, with Iason, for the Golden Fleece But brought destruction, Paris-like, from Greece, The Painted Hellen; must a Troian Fate Vpon the Troian Issue, ever wait? Is this our boast, from Brute? was all the Blood Borne to deplore Corne growes now where Troy stood? Must new Troy, like the Phœnix too expire, And be but Embers, of the fatall Fire? What third Plantation, for the Dardan worme To creepe into? oh madness, how enorme! How beyond all Aspersion, which may flow, From Phrygian Loines, are we involv'd in, now! Whither yet tends our Voyage? we were led W?? hopes of some-what, to Assay this Bed, Of many mixéd waters; and the Two Faire Sister-starres, sate over in our Prow; By a Transefixion, the Dioscuri Vnto State-fareing Men; these will they cry, Direct our Passage, that we cannot faile; Liberty, &amp; Religion! a faire Gale And all our Toyle shall have a Glorious meed; Thus brought into the Gulph, not to be freed; Environed, beyond a hope of Shore, And our owne Idoll, must our selves devour. This, the Great Orke! w?? (if I might discend In Serious Things, to Trifles) ide defend; The fabled Monsters, w?? S? Bevis oft Vanquisht in fight, &amp; our S? George has Cufft; With Guy &amp; Amadis, &amp; all the Crue Of Worthy Warriours met w??, now were true; This I'le beleive, Such Monsters have beene ever, But then the Knight;—oh let him now or never Free the distresséd Damsell; See she Stands Bound to the Rocke, w?? Buttocks in her hands. Away! Squibbs of Scurrilitie; 'twas Shame First taught vs cloths; we peccant, put a blame To each Remote! Sons of the first offence; 'Twas given mee, is our Plea of Innocence; Wee all were gvilty, &amp; each to his Eies Had rear'd an Image, for to Idollize: And severally we ayméd the same Thing; Liberty with, if not, without a King. Something we did proiect, our selves to please W?? thin Imaginations to our Ease; This Small Tarantula, did fire the Blood To severall Passions, as the Humor Stood; And like Calabrian Swains, for remedie Each dancéd to his Pipe, or Dance or Dye; All present State is irksome; &amp; wee frame Felicity at distance, by some Name Allicient to the Passion holds our Thought Then present; as we are, or feare a Doubt. I doe not know; but though perhaps I have To my owne Private, had reflects, as grave On my Condition, as Another who Puts on a Stricter Forme &amp; Deeper Brow; I never found, but the Attempt was vaine And noe Man's Brest, yet ever lodg'd his Braine. Wee Fancy at a distance, &amp; contrive Beatitude in future, but still live Distracted to the End our Selves propose. Thus to our selves, our selves still interpose; Wee are our owne deceivers; or to Say Punctually, each Man is a Remora Clapt to the Vessell of his owne Affaire, And his owne purposes hinders; might I dare I would not free the ioynéd Polities Of States, from the Subverting fantasies, From the Imperiall Scepter, to the Crum's Of Magistracie in Mechanicke Thumbs; Vnder each forme wee bind or loose y? right Not to its Iustice but our Appetite; And our Corruptions, our deprav'd desire, Makes one scale of the Ballance, ever higher; Nothing is Right, but what our selves may please; For Settled Bodies are not still at Ease. The Gout or Dropsie, men; soe may a State, Lethargicke be, or inarticulate; For each Thing to the severall Fantasye Is a Defect, or a Deformitie; A Beautie, an Embellishment, or what Our Interests, or Affections give it at. Iupiter's Ears are rent w?? croaking still; The Frogs have noe King, but too good, or ill; The Spaune of Earth, are Giants to this Day, They will nor Gods, nor Power from Gods, obey; The Mountaines of disorder'd Thoughts, they bring All but one Pile; for C?monwealth, or King; Though yet the stronger Boast of Libertie To most men stands in a C?munitie. And everie Tongve, can varnish ore that Face W?? is but now, the Same, she ever was; The Ladie of the Wood was never seene, Another Eccho, or the Fayerie Queene; To give the fruiture of each desire, The Ignis fatuus, all danke Brains to fire. Thus ignorant Spectators, when they See Our Map-Groteskors, thinke they reall be; Thus what the Wise Egiptians, did intend By Misticke Hieroglificks, in the end Became Idolatrie; Some Heads discover Noe more in Things then the meer forms lay'd over; These the Ryphæan Hills, where Griphons breed And Ambigenerous Centaurs, first did rise: Settled Opinions, from non-Entities. But ah! there is not such a Thing at all To be expected, in the Generall Societie of Men; to make it sure Is from our selves; the inward mind Secure, Affects not giddy noyse, nor fears the Sway Of any Power, acting any way. And this is Libertie; this we may find, This we may keep; thus happie in our mind All Government is easie; and may be Made one, or Any, Equall Libertie. Let those who seeke and cannot find her yet Within their inward selves, ne're hope to get Over the Hill; but with poore Sysiphus Begin againe; or in the Euripus Which their owne Curiosities first found Satisfie for their Error, &amp; be Drown'd. For Publike busines: who cannot find Liberty, vnder any Forme design'd; But hopes, by change, that it may perfect grow. Ah! may they,—as wee found it now; Vnder another Name, a Power, Swell'd high, W?? all the full Effects of Tyrrannye; Their weake portending fears, did but Suggest; Now Strongly manag'd, to Secure the Rest. Thus farre our deep resentments, wee may tell; 'Twas ill atcheiv'd; if it Succeed, 'tis well. Idyll 2. But y? I know my heart, I could contemne All Government, &amp; Quarrell w?? the Name, Or w?? as great an Ease assert the Hand Of any w?? wee see, or vnderstand. Since Man has lost himselfe, it is but Iust He suffer, to the Libertie he lost; For once that word had weight, &amp; whineing Man Hangs to the Plumme; let fall, a Child againe; Squints or'e his Shoulders &amp; is either caught Backe into Hell; or Stands a Heap of Salt; Astonishment, or Fury, fills him vp Beyond his Faith, or yet beyond his Hope. 'Tis easie to speake hard; but where we groane Vnder the Yoake, wee rather vse our owne; Passions sitt heavy; Tirant greife, may lay A Wast in Witt, and force it any way; As tender Soules, tost in a flood of feares When they want wordes express themselves in tears; For Nature Charg'd, assayes the weakest part And pressing Thoughts, tumble downe, hills of Art; The Iutty of Discretion, &amp; the wide Meadow of Fancy, drownéd in the Tide; Stand, neither Fence nor Beautie; one drown'd heape And not an Arke! poore Man! how shall he Scape! Wee've wrapt our selfe yet warmer, &amp; y? Corke Boyes the lost Anchor; if it be our worke, To Combat Seas, &amp; Riot in the Deepe; Strike a bold Arme, 'tis ours; methinks I sleepe Now on a Dolphin's back; Ship-threat'ninge Shoales Bind nearer Shore; the monstrous Whale (w?? Roles The Ocean, w?? his Breath, &amp; Yawnes the Brine As its recesse) his wonted path declines. What feare y? old Harpe Strikes! for 'tis not all Fable you read; Pithægorus may Call Wisedome, by many Names; &amp; Somewhat nere Divinitie, give to the Nations here; Silence a happines here taught, as though Words were soe much a Dagger; did I know 'T wiser were not to Speake then where to Speake May ease the Pang, I'de hold; but these are weake Dreames, in Beatitude, &amp; Sickly Tasts Of Somewhat, for a cure, w?? over-hasts The fainted Spirits, &amp; a Caspian Trance Whistles the Blood new measures to her Dance; For Feavered Minds, who their owne Pallats dresse W?? hopes &amp; Feares, Shift Sides, &amp; find noe Ease. Let vs not dreame our Time; though Fame pursued Make dangers Easie, c?mentaried Blood Transforms the Sheet, &amp; horrid Murder made; Glory keepes Shop, and makes it a free Trade; Empire, the Law of Armes; wee over-paint Iustice, still sworded, but her Scales doth want. 'Tis a sad Truth, &amp; though the story faile Eaten by Time, &amp; Cunninge to availe The Pedigree of Power; Old Nimrod's Dust (Too mighty for one Vrne) breakes ope the Chest And rides vpon all windes; where every graine Springs Tirant, &amp; the world yet feeles his Raigne. Such propagating Iellyes, nere distill Without their Mandrakes; whose first hissings kill. How much more fatall, more emproved Slime, When Gallowes-Spawne, but only threatens him Whose lucke, or Curiositie, dislodg'd Him first; but these dire Basilisks keepe Edg'd Vnto all Commers; &amp; as Safe endure Her Sight (wer all writ true) as breathing Power. When the Mad Youth of Macedon, (whose Pride Scorn'd Phillip, Father, would be Deified;) Had Swept the panting East, &amp; horrid Crimes Open'd his way to Conquest, in the Times; Fatt Persia, t'his Voluptuous Appetite Fell, like her boasted Bird, one Morsell Bitt; Rage triumpht in his Will; &amp; fury claw'd His helpers; &amp; the world, by one, was aw'd. One, who abate his errors, and display His faire Side from what flatterie can Say Was Equall'd in his Hoast; the Drunken edge Of Iealousie, strikes Vertue; Insolent Rage Tramples downe Pietie; &amp; though wee keepe Reverence, to Faith, when wee see Cæsar weepe O're Pompey's head; who smiles not to delude Himselfe, in such a Pitty? who pursued Ambition, through their Empire; German Wasts Manur'd with Native Blood, &amp; sped as fast (Lavish in Murders) as their Rhine; w?? gives Noe pause, till the wide Ocean him receives. Hee plow'd Iberian Sands; well-peopled Gaule, Lay'd desart; proud in Blood; &amp; wears butt All The Tropheyes of his Arme, rude servitour To Puttocks; layd the Earth, one Table o're For empty Wolves; y? Slaughter-man of Fate; And as he had not yet attained the height Of Horror, in Distinction; Hee must act His owne portentous Dreame; Rome though Sack't, His Mother, soe polluted, was not All; But he must make her Childless; &amp; y? fall Of her long-boasted Senate, paves the new Name of his Glory; yet hee's Modest too, And off'red Soveraigntie refuses, more To Swell himselfe; Names vary, not the Power. 'Tis not the fatall Rex, doth only Sting; A Commonwealth's a Tirant, as a King; And gown'd Austerity, though it may weare More Face, is but the Arme which threatens here. How could I Pitty Rage; or foole my owne Reason, to praise hands of Destruction; I should lament his Name, who Tirant once Over the World, lash't home, when threatned France And Italy Subdued, Seal'd Empire, nigh To Carthage; I could mourne that Prodigie Whipt by the Surly Gowne; Emulous in His Glory, feare his Power; for 'tis noe Sin To thinke Men wicked; &amp; the Itch of Rule Prompts any meanes; noe Villanie soe foule Soe neare to ruine, but they must attempt. Poore Hanniball, is now in Banishment; And seemes now old to beg a Life; whose hand Repreiv'd the world; ev'n those who now C?mand The inexorable Roman, were but what One Step had given; Handy-Capps in Fate; He who (if Names be proper,) frighted once The Civill World: worne out, by Puissance Of Faction; to a Barbarous King doth flye; And hoary, has but Power, alone to Dye. Now let Agrippa laugh, whilst we survay A nearer Draught; the Hecticke has y? Day To cease in, but drinks Marrow; till the whole Frame, fall a Ruine; let the Subiect ffoole Who Squares by others Lines, or drawes a Scheme To please himselfe, by Fancy, feares redeeme; Let him conferre a forme; &amp; Regulate Distempers, incident to any State: The harmeles Lumpe, of his Invention; Yet licke it vp, to Life, Dominion. It Spreads an Arméd Paw; &amp; runs y? Ile Bear in full Shape, to Ravin, wast, &amp; Spoyle. Y'are yet as wide, of what we would propose As had you Studied, Seaven yeare, the Prose, Of the wild German Riddler; &amp; wee wheele Noe further with the Time, then to reveale The folly of all Seekinges; Not the Name Tickles mee yet; who cannot to y? frame Allotted, Serve, is Rebell to the Vow Made in offence; to be observéd too; For 'twas the easy mulct, when Man had lost Himselfe, &amp; Scorn'd Creation; to be thrust Servile to his owne Hand; &amp; He who bore The Image of his Maker, w?? the Power, Imediately consign'd, Ambitious Of more, lost That; &amp; delves the Infamous Mine of his Follyes; that he might repent His Error better, by the Punishment; A Glasse of former Freedome; where the Eye Yet Sees the Image; but Impossiblie Attempted, Shunning the profane Embrace Of Humane Armes; Slipps, Shaddow, in a Glasse. Idyll iii. I envy noe Man; nor I scarce admire Any Man's Fancy to my owne desire; Wee looke at one Same thing; &amp; the formes come But only differ'd by the medium. False Glasse of Ayre, or y? weake Opticke Scarce Receives her Rayes, or can her Atomes peirce; Purblind in Ethicks, as y? Running Hare, Gloats either way; Fore-rights nor Hope nor Feare; And Crownéd Ioy rackes Sence; while Reason (yet Frustrate in Levies) Depos'd Prince doth Sitt In a Cold Corner; y? Swolne Passions, now (Growne-Courtiers late) contemne y? Loyall few. See Iustice, Pietie, &amp; Prudence plac'd Worthy a King, the Honour of one Breast; Make Syracusa blush, to see a Prince Above her Numbers, whose Experience Might well praise little Things; &amp; Tiptoe crye The Lagi Stemme, in bright-Hair'd Ptolomy A God-like linage S?m'd; whose Mother Spred A part of Heaven; Vowéd Tribute of her Head, A Constellation Stands; let Truth assert What flatterie may force; Power Malapert Vnder the wing of Vertue, Vulture proves; And hatch'd by Innocence, Blood seekes &amp; Loves. Were Maiestie as Calme as we have knowne It in one Starre, through the whole Horizon; Vnstain'd as our Ideas; or the Hand More Spotles, who late rul'd y? Land; Who if a place be Lawfull to assigne In heaven, for Soules departed, there doth raigne. Yet Name of a Prince, &amp; Shade of Royall Power, Warmes Insolence in others; Names, noe more Delude the World; Kings Suffer, when they give Inhærent Light, long-fixt Prærogative, To fill a glareing Office; or confer It to the Civetts of an Officer, Whose Tooth-picker, like y? officious Bird Betrayes him Sleeping; &amp; y? Ratt has Stirr'd His bleeding Entrayles, Ere aware; Soe delves Ichneumon Fraud, &amp; Kings but Sell themselves. I cannot weane my selfe soe perfectly But with Affection I name Royaltie; And whimper to the Teat, though Strong enough To digest meat, less Savory &amp; more Tough. Have yo? not tooke mee tardy from my Theam? Led out a Gazer to the falling Beame? Strucke in a Village Fright, to see the Tayle Of such a Comet; growne Star-gazers All; Our ignorant Gvesses please the neighbourhood, Fate, in a Comet, Seen &amp; vnderstood. Wee, who low-read in Mathematicks, beard Planets &amp; Meteors, equally enspir'd, And know noe Region higher then the Moone; Admit noe lower, but whip vp &amp; downe The grateing Orbes; all in a tracke, t'enflame Their Naffes drye-worne &amp; crack their stretchéd Teeme The Aire dry Tinder to y? Sparkes, w?? Stop; In the right Box fir'd, wee light Candles vp. How Passions rise in Men! Everie Thing Adds to the Circle, to make Dæmon Spring. Had wee laid out a Systeme of y? Sphære (And form'd iust Motions, by a Regular Transition, to the Old, or new Designe Tycho, or harder names to fill a Line;) Y' had knitt a Brow, our Glasses could not peirce; Now all looks faire; your Eyes (the vtmost Starres Of our discoverie) bright Seen; portend A gratefull Omen; Laughter, cannot Spend A vaine Breath; Folly takes it, w?? full Sayle, And hardly Witt but Tackles to that Gale. Wee're tight &amp; readie-rigg'd; one purchast Knott Helps at a need, and we can draw it out; The Advantage of our voyage; all the world Trades, in this magicke; though the foole be hurl'd Spleen-Shittle-Cocke; Witt to emprove the worke Will often Spare a Feather to the Corke. This, though it fall in Trifles, is but what Runs with full Streame, in the affaires of State; Where Tyrranny enthron'd, laughs Murder out, Makes Truth a Solæcisme; whirls a Doubt, State-Tarriers; Provocations, to the Raw Triall of Witts; Concealments good in Law. The Imposture, boasts his head, whose velvet brow Shunn'd weaker Twigs; antler'd &amp; Palméd now, By the Herd prick't on Cheife; combats at length Huge Trees, to trye his horne; &amp; s?m'd in full Strength Proud in Prærogative, he goares them out Stand in his way, now rageing at the Rutt. The Lust of Tyrants (over-bauded still By hooded Law) carnalls the world at Will. Prostitute Men, are by Corruption led, Sinners; &amp; weepe away their Maidenhead; Their Boast, their Glory, the ?maculate Seale of their Reason, Green Wax of the State; Th' Old Charter, lost, new Letters-pattents give Vs Libertie to wander with a Breife; Irresiant, now content; the Trade emproves, And Sturdy Rogve, Setts vp; if Vertue loves The Cell of Quiet, happie, may She Sitt; The World is Busines; &amp; wee Trafficke it; To this dere Sphinx; wrackt Thebans all y? world Are Prey by turnes; as had the Furies hurl'd A brand of knotted Sulphur, to Surprise Men Sleeping; Nero, laughs, when flames arife. But 'tis an easie Chord; y? Flax of Law Makes a Soft Tr?mell; let a higher Awe Stifle affrighted Reason, &amp; put on Chains, lock't &amp; Bolted, by Religion; Let Numa's will, Stand next Divinitie; And the dread Whisper, publish't, Sacred be; Cannons inviolate: what creeping Power Wants? The fine Artifice, to plaister o're These Vlcers with a Balsamum, may bring The Mouth clos'd vp! &amp; walke a very King! For vnto everie Power, the Attribute Is proper, though perhaps the Name not Suite. Legions of Men, whom Men had ner restrain'd Are Cow'd, to obey the Dictates of a Hind: Dumbe Innocent! the Forgeries of Power, May levie, Lead, &amp; Conquer; men noe more (Chill'd with these fallacies) dispute the true Right, of their Being; but the Dreames pursue Made to amaze them; if some bolder wakes The Mangie Scribe tells what y? Pigeon speakes. Let Mecha rant to all the vanities Of long-lost H?mon; Alexander, tryes Vntrodden Sandes, to his Ambition; And the God (still to freind) affirmes him One; Now, what the Sultan Seekes, may nearer home Be gott; when Camells Dedicated, come Backe to fatt Pastures, freed from any Charge Of future Burthen, happie Beasts, enlarge Themselves, to Act our Follies, &amp; at length May to their Naturall vse, bestow their Strength: Not the great Tyrant, (who like vermin may Snap Man as Easily as you a Flea) Dare touch this Pilgrim-Camell; as 't wer done A Reverence to 't; but this maintains his owne; For his loud Ancestor enacted all Their Superstitions, in this wheele to fall; And he but lives, a Prophet to y? Sway Of Empire as he taught them to Obay. Let Sainted Fooles &amp; Madmen Cannoniz'd, Advance the Rule; where Witt &amp; Art despis'd Vpbraid the Boast of old Civilitie: Greece, more a fable then her Fables be; And put the lye vpon our Admiration That ever there was Glory, in that Nation; Who rul'd the World, in Letters, &amp; præscrib'd Rome famous, &amp; the Westerne Earth beside Now Sitts, our Pitty; and weake Clearkes, may raise Some doubts, what Socrates or Plato, was; Bestride their Academie, and Despise Laconia Valiant, or Olivia wise: And take the Old Scandall, (now a Truth) to heart; What will not lyinge Greece, written insert? Convince the Stagyrite, in Puny Witt, From th' Arrogant vncertainties he writt; And his long-venerated Axioms, bind Postill' t'Heredotus; that Truth shall find A Narrow Roome to tread in, &amp; the few Vn-bearded Criticks, Cloth her out a new. Soe Shrinks the world, though Men &amp; Names yet keepe The Ephori, broad-wakeing, in the Sleepe Of Sparta, long-forgotten, &amp; the Rest Like drunken Helots, either Act the Iest, Their Rigours Shall impose, or weare their Lives Prest in the Yoke of their Prerogatives. The World's an Ant-hill, &amp; the little Grubbs Stocke themselves warme, till y? swoln Paddock rubbs Them out of Freehold, to enthrone himselfe Lord of their Lives, &amp; Maister of their Wealth. Idyll 4. Nor wonder, if the loud Prærogative Scatter our Dust, &amp; licke our Sweat, to Live With the Same Innocence, as Fishes Mudde; Land-Cormorants may Challeng them for food; Who Grasse to Lions? or Slaine Bullocks fling's To Camells? y? whole world, through severall Things Eats her selfe vp; the Estrich, may digest A Broken Rocke, &amp; on a Plough-Share feast; Some, Eate y? fruits &amp; some the Iuyce of Earth Whose quicke returnes, bring second Fodders forth; Fatted, to feed themselves; Arabia, yeilds Noe Wonder, in her Bird, (if true) w?? builds Her funerall Pile, her Cradle; the world, weake Reveiues her Selfe, &amp; what the Ancients Speake From the first Symbole, Traditorie Truth Is soe indeed; if we observe the Growth And decay of Things, the world is All One Phœnix; &amp; makes new originall From her owne Ashes; as she one Day must Start from one flame, new &amp; refinéd Dust, She now, in parcells, Dictates to her Earth The Transmigration of an entire Birth; Therfore I must Correct my Selfe, to know Man, but a Feather; if he fall, or grow, 'Tis but observéd, till another Coat Gives a new wing; &amp; weare the Eye-sore out; 'Tis but a mewing Time; what matter if Cold Gorges crampe the feet? Our Eyeass Life Complaines vnpittied; we're indeed soe Dull In the Nest-Gutt, wee Crye fasting &amp; full; Though Tyrranny, (big-Swolne, in all formes, Vulture or Moll) doe Swoop, or hunt out wormes. Men borne for bondage; 'tis not in our Choice How wee shall Bleed; if Blood be made y? Price; And 'tis as easie Smart, to give that Breath In Ayre, as Earth; resolv'd a certaine Death: For Kings act open-fac'd, but what of late Wee See pursued, vnder the Masque of State; Where fatted fellow-creepers, Dig new Seams And catch it, warme-lay'd, delvinge y? extreames Of the darke Centre, w?? an Eager Foot; And wee are Strangled ere our Neighbours know 't. This yet I'de rather Shun, might I but creepe To breath in Royall Ayre, then Dye soe Deepe. But nothing bootes my fancy, when I Span My Selfe to Iudgment, in the Circle Man: (And over-toil'd Affections, wounded Send To Reason, at his need, my nearest freind;) I boldly looke on Either, and refuse Neither, but comply to the Genius Directs all forme; I can as well keep bare To a Cotton-Bench, as to a Velvet-Chaire; 'Tis all one to my Ease, to all the Right I claime in Man; to all the Benefitt Of Fortune; (if my former Errors had Not lodg'd mee (they malignant Say, I) Madd; For Sideing is a madnes, where the Hand Acts to a Somewhat, we but vnderstand In the Relations,) if the Essence be Resolvéd through, in the necessitie. I know noe Argument in Reason Springs T'oppose the forme, by C?monwealths, or Kings; Nor is 't a Sickly bending in the Blood But a firme Truth, to what I've vnderstood From the whole question; w?? ill-stated, Swaies Vs to our owne Affections Severall waies; But to the Eye of Reason, (if wee must Live vnder Power) all Power is Equall Iust. Man is a kind of Sea-weed (if we may Run to the Simile, the World, a Sea;) Wee lye weake Spriggs, w?? vpon water floate; Osyers, in Ayre, but Corrall at the Root; Empire low-firm'd, a Plant congeal'd, a Rocke Torne vp, a Babble, or a whistle-Stalke; The large Amphibion now resolv'd is hung; To make proud females was our wonder long. Empire &amp; State, the formes of Government, The Originall of Power, &amp; the Discent, Are now but Easie Problemes; a Discourse For vnconcernéd Woemen; or what's worse Taught Children quarrell Crown's; &amp; can declaime Power, w?? their Spoone-meat, vnder any Name; Can tumble Iunius Brutus, &amp; conferre The Phillipicks, with all our moderne Stirre; And can name Oligarchy, w?? more Ease Then a Loome-flitter, can Church Hierarchies; Such Definitions w?? their Milke; &amp; prove Authority, to what their Mothers Love; And See the Reason, ere they well can prate; Who Rules the House, to Them governs y? State. For my owne part, I love a Woeman Witt As a Tam'd Hare, that Strikes a Dr?ming fitt; Or the cag'd Squirrell, w?? a Iing of Bells; Mechanicke Entertaine! &amp; the face Sells Sometimes at better Rate, where they can top The C?mers; w?? the Tangle of the Shop; But whither Toothéd, run I, in mistake? May the Sex live long flatter'd, for his Sake; Who put the Witt vpon 'em, for a Boast, And got his End, Such Labour, never Lost. Draw out y? Scheme; take y? Ascendent right, Iupiter; Venus lost, vnto our Sight; And then read on; wee've whirl'd the Pin of State Fraile Axis; &amp; See Power, not Constellate; Cæsar, (noe starre within our Region knowne, Trust in a knott, of Tullie's mourning Gowne) Is but a Wild-fire, to wast Senate Raggs, And silence Cato, whose too bitter braggs Of Libertie, Chain'd others, in the Quest, And lost his owne; by a new Power opprest. The Slumbers of our Age, (if we could tell Them out, broad-wakeing), ancient Dreams reveale; If Life be little more, 'tis fond expence To hang vp State, fring'd with a Reverence For better Curtains; &amp; wrought Pillow's bring Pownc'd Law, Stitched C?mon-wealth, &amp; purled King; More trouble to our Rest, lye downe &amp; Sleepe The Folly out, w?? others Laugh, or Weepe. Idyll 5. If yet an Easie and familiar Draught Of things be plaine enough, to Speake our Thought, Well may he fare, whose Candor will Admit, Our meaning; though he see not, where wee hitt; The happie Age, has teem'd, &amp; brought a new Race of Discerners; can be wise, as you; Can Squeeze an Author, w?? a Ioynt; &amp; raise In Sea's of Præiudice, Mountains of Praise, By an Imposeing Faith; an Easie Smile Argues the Ieast; the frowne a Deeper Stile; And your Attention clawes the Humor, to A Shrugge; then pause, &amp; Descant as yo? goe. Had wee not layd it right, from instances, (And led them on by Things) w?? they may Gvesse Not easie to another; a fitt Straine To venture on,) they'd Sent vs home againe. As I'me an honest man, I thought, I'de past His censure, with Applause; &amp; now, at last (Sprung-gvilty) he considers, what wee meant To vse him thus, &amp; Spoyle his Complement; He slips to his State-forme; &amp; Calls his Eyes To Councell, ere he Doome ours Levities; Then with the promist White-Staffe of his Place He threatens Poetry, like a Strange Face; The Doore of his Discretion opens but To very few; indeed Witt, Still Sitts out Lac'd, his familiar freind; &amp; perfumes, peirce His Braines; caught more by y? Nose &amp; Eyes, then Ears; Yet, if a politicke Whisper, beat an Ayre Vpon his Perucke, he Accosts yo? bare; And gives a formall greeting's cautious Hum To but Name Machiavel; only for Some Slipt lines, troubles his Conscience; for the fine Thing, he would be thought, noe ord'nary Devine; He takes Du Plessis, as his Accidence; And reads his meaning, though but Spell his French; The Title, contra missam, hangs his meere Mouth-Dagger; then I hope yo? need not feare Him Orthodoxe, thus weapon'd; for his Sheild He takes vp Hooker, which he cannot weild; Rather then want a Target, Perkins Tents Are Search't vp, for Left-handed Implements; And fitt him right; or if he chance to feele Himselfe at worse, with Gerson, he can wheele; He whips Socinus, Atheist, in his Name But C?mends Chillingsworth, lest he Disclaime Acquaintance, w?? Some Persons; that y? word And his Religion's pinn'd vpon My Lord; He loves the fatt Presbitery, &amp; Cites Authenticke Prinne; vnto the Rabbi, writes Propheticke Dreames; &amp; measures not y? Church Steeple, by Calvin's Nose, nor's Mouth y? Porch; Yet not to Suffer in a Dangerous Time Noe Name affrights him; hee'le as eas'ly clime The Independent ladder, &amp; at toppe Grinns, an old Ape to every Eye lookes vp; Chuses his Name, new-Syllabled to amaze Some weaker Brother, tir'd in Steps of Grace; He admires Goshen (better fed then taught) He takes the Wildernes, with those who Sought Farre Canaan, but Manna falls soe Scant, Faces about; hee's now a Protestant, But lest Religion too much wrong his breeding, And Revealations take him from his reading; He comes, the moderne entertains, by Roat; Takes from Illustre Bassa, Don Quixot; These passe him, w?? the Ladies; where hee'le lard It Better Langvages, anything that's hard; He smacks at everie Science; &amp; præscribes Rules as he had Quarter'd 'em, into Tribes; Only poore Poesie, affronts him; 'tis Too Saucy; &amp; the Worthy, to be Wise, Neglect it; Solid Prose! his owne Discourse (For he that meanes) Subdues a mind of force. I'me soe content, &amp; he; we're parted thus Though hardly freinds; both pleas'd; this tyr?nous Insulter over Manners, would Surprise Witt Tappast, a Live Quarrey; we're as wise And Iealous as himselfe; for ere he trace Vs lodg'd, we're vp, to lead him a new Chace. Nor blame this Satire, if darke Sava creepe Into the Danub, and his Colour keepe Makeing one Current, through the middle Streame; Allow this Earthy Wave, within the Name Of our Designe, a quickspring broke of Late Into the Channell; &amp; runs on with State; Now gather in the Odds; Caligula At Checkstones; &amp; let Xerxes whip the Sea; Hellespont trembles; as rough Adria, may Combe her Hair smoother, on y?

Stay thy mechanicke hand; patch't vp of late She flyes; an Eagle flutter'd as a Batt; The melting Ceruse, Shrinks; Stript Porcupine May to an Vrchin, of his wants complaine; Well-thatcht, gainst Winter's Stormes; poore Innocence Lyes in a Hole, &amp; tumbles Crabbs; y?

Nature workes nothing but by perfect Rules; Wee make her Whirligig, &amp; Sport for Fooles; And Bladder out her Shell, w?? the vaine Breath Of notions, madly form'd; as wer't a faith— Cognizance, in Blue-Coat-Philosophy To prevent her Impossibilitie; Lest the dire vacuum seize her, Every Mouth Adds, to the Timpany; &amp; the world Slow'th, Readie to take the Fillup of a Hand Must cure her Dropsie; make vs vnderstand The Error, of our Cure, &amp; draw vs in To Science, by destruction; wee begin (Sicke Sinners All) but truly then to Live When we may live noe longer; I beleive As God bequeath'd an order to the frame Of his Creation, &amp; to everie Name Conferr'd an vse; Man, (y? ill Steward) rack't The Farme; &amp; double-rented we must tak't At Second Hand; well if we can advance With Sweat, rent, for our Inheritance.

Not Borne nor Bred to Studies soe Sublime, Wee vent our traffique in regardless Rhyme; But love, our verses, ('bove their merit) when They worthily Celebrate, Worthy Men; Big Glory, Speake it out; for Pride becomes Iust Truth, an humble Off'ring, at such Tombes. Drawne from a Noble Ancestry; Sustain'd By vertue, Glorious; but these scarcely stand Our owne to boast; Derivatively, Wee Claime but from Cleare Names, of a Pedigree. But had not Antique Rome, nor glorious fame From Pisa, giv'n the great Fabrician Name; Had there noe statues beene, w?? later France Can Witness; This, one single, might advance Himselfe Illustrious; for All, Iust or Wise; Learned, Religious, Good, were his Allyes. Not to be Lord of Pieresk, nor the Chaire At Aix, Ennoble him; nor Beaugensier; His Titles, vpon firmer Basis went; Vertue's Support, Learning's best Ornament; The Soule of Science, Edge of Industry, The Boast of Nature, in Humanitie. What wonders has he done? y? Copious East Ransack'd, &amp; ioyn'd to y? Redundant West; (Confuteing Ignorance,) Heaven's Motion In his owne Orbe; the East &amp; West but One; What Rarityes! what Cost! what paines! what Price! Has he forborne! &amp; from his owne Supplies; Hee vnlock't the Vatican; &amp; from himselfe Could adde to the whole frame in Every Shelfe; Medalls &amp; Antique Charts, not vnderstood, To him were plaine, from him approvéd good. What his acquaintance was, wee should not boast; The Learnéd world allowes them, Learnéd most; Few Names of Many serves; Great Scaliger And Grotious; with him who held the Chaire Pontificate, at Rome; whose Name (how ere The Rest Mis-suite) lives to his Character, Vrbanus; Scarce a Name, in that high Court But for some Learninge, owed Fabricius for 't. I am not Eas'ly led; &amp; I had slept In Ignorance; had not Gassendus stept To light this Torch, from whence each may take light For his owne Sphere, to make the whole Orbe bright; Some Glimmer, Some maintaine a radiant fire 'Tis fit what they may Praise, that I admire. Vpon the Excellent Poems of Mr. George Herbert. Lord! yet How dull am I? When I would flye; Vp to the Region of thy Glories; where Only true formes appeare; My long-brail'd! Pineons, Clumsie, &amp; vnapt I cannot Spread; I am all dullnes; I was Shap't Only to flutter, in the lower Shrubs Of Earth-borne follies; out alas! When I would tread A higher Step, ten thousand, thousand rubs Prevent my Pace. This happie Larke, w?? humble Honour, I Admire &amp; Praise; But when I raise My Selfe, I fall asham'd, to see him flye. The Royall Prophet, in his Extasie First trod this Path; Hee followes nere; I will not say how nigh, In flight as well as faith; Let mee asham'd, creepe back into my Shell, And humbly listen to his Layes; 'Tis Preiudice, what I intended Praise; As where they fall soe low, all words are still. Our vntun'd Liricks, only fitt To Sing our Selfe-borne Cares, Dare not of him; or had wee witt; Where might wee find out Eares Worthy his Character, if wee may bring Our Accent to his Name? This Stand; of Liricks, Hee the vtmost fame Has gain'd; &amp; now they vaile to heare him Sing, Horace in voice, &amp; Cassimire in wing. An Occasionall reflection Martij 26: 1653: Brought to y?

Seaven; Yet not enough, for yet I doe offend; But ah his mercyes never end; What shall I doe dread Lord; for thou hast done To my vndoing more &amp; more; I dare not hope thy mercyes Still, for one Soe often lost before Sav'd by thy hand, w?? alone Saves from death; Dead w?? y? Terror of relapsing crimes; What may I doe oh God? my grounded faith Fayles to thy mercy vrg'd soe many Times; Nor faith, nor hope: Dread Lord what shall I doe? I'le call y? hills to hide My Caitive face; for ah I dare not Show It ever to be tryed By Thee againe; thy flameing Iustice burnes My bowells vp, &amp; grates my bones; My hart is horror, all my Spirritt mournes; Death &amp; destructions Attend my Sleeping browes &amp; waking Eyes; Lost in y? grave of Sin for many dayes; A Stinking carcasse buried; many wayes And many times, thy mercyes Still Surprise Me; &amp; now dead, thy mercye, bidds me rise. I run to meet thy Love; that I may move Not all vnworthy, Strike me through w?? Love; That I may love y? Lover, and emprove Lost faith &amp; hope departed, in that Love; For Love is all. Finis. [Man yet a Stranger from y? Africke Side] The following scarcely legible or intelligible lines close the MS.:— Man yet a Stranger from y? Africke Side Invades y? fallen Europe of his will And hopes to Conquer, conquering Slaves beside; Or langvishing lyes still Where ther by our home Gartage themselves betraid, Or lazy, lost w??in our owne lusts, tread A Countermase, &amp; ye Subdued our fields invade. FINIS.</field>
