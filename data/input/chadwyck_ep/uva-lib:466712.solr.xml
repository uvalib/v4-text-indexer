      <field name="fulltext">Verses Spoken at St. Paul's School by F.P.R., aged ten years, April 30, 1807. Spes arrectæ juvenum, exultantiaque haurit Corda pavor pulsans.— Virgil. By hopes and anxious fears at once oppressed What throbs tumultuous swell the youthful breast! As when, at eve, their daily labours done, While in the west declines the setting sun, And neighb'ring hills their length'ning shadows throw O'er the luxuriant meads that smile below, In some sweet vale, remote from public view, The village youth their rustic sports pursue, While various groups assemble on the green, If chance some stripling view the mirthful scene, As yet unskill'd to urge the mimic war, Or hurl with well-pois'd arm the pond'rous bar, His ardent breast with emulation glows, And eager hope a tenfold strength bestows; What mix'd sensations fill his anxious breast, When first in open view he stands confest, Joins the gay troop, and in the sportive play 'Midst youthful rivals makes his first essay! So in my breast distracting doubts prevail, And new emotions now my mind assail; As, in such scenes untried, these boards I tread, “With all my imperfections on my head,” Alternate passions in my bosom sway, Now buoy'd by hope, now harass'd by dismay. Think not I stand to act a feigned part, Or pourtray feelings foreign to my heart; No blood-stain'd Richard here disdains to yield, Raves for his horse, and treads th' ensanguin'd field; No sorrowing Hamlet mourns his murder'd sire, No lovers sigh, or treach'rous foes conspire; No borrowed character—I come to raise My voice, as duty prompts, in Colet's praise; Whose mind by strong benevolence inspired, By patriot warmth and love of virtue fired, To rescue man from sloth's destructive hand, And from fell ign'rance save his native land, To free mankind from superstitious powers This fabric raised in most auspicious hours. Patron of learning, and religion's friend, To thee in fervent gratitude we bend; Though death has call'd thee hence to endless day, Though years roll on, and ages pass away, Thy name, thine honour'd name, shall still survive, And in our grateful bosoms ever live! But hold! methinks I hear some critic cry, “The boy's too late; the time has long gone by; Young Roscii now have lost the power to charm, And infant orators no longer swarm: At length aroused, our strange delirium o'er, Their puny efforts please our ears no more.” 'Tis true I'm young: perhaps, too, somewhat small: But that has been the common lot of all: Grave rev'rend sages, heroes six feet high— Nestor himself—were once as young as I: The sturdiest oak that ploughs the boist'rous main, The guardian bulwark of Britannia's reign, A sapling once, within its native vale, Shrank from the blast and bow'd at every gale. Ladies, to you I turn; my cause befriend, Blame not a fault each day will help to mend. In these sage times of wisdom so profuse, This reign of reason, sense, and Mother Goose, Consult your hearts, and blame us if you can, If boys, when men turn children, ape the man. My youth forgive! When time has o'er me flown, And future years have marked me for their own, Oft to these scenes may I again repair, And oft again your flatt'ring favours share! My hopes confirm; my doubts, my fears remove; Blame where you must; and where you can, approve! Benevolence. The lark sings loud, 'tis early morn, These woodland scenes among, The deep-toned pack and echoing horn Their jovial notes prolong. And see poor puss, with shorten'd breath, Splashed sides, and weary feet, In terror views approaching death, And crouches at my feet! Her strength is gone, her spirits fail, Nor further can she fly; The hounds snuff up the tainted gale, And nearer sounds the cry. Poor helpless wretch! methinks I view Thee sink beneath their power! Methinks I see the ruffian crew Thy tender limbs devour! Yet O! in vain thy foes shall come: So cheer thee, trembling elf! These guardian arms shall bear thee home— I'll eat thee up myself! Occasional Epilogue, TO “RULE A WIFE AND HAVE A WIFE,” Spoken by Major Hart, in the character of Michael Peres, at the Canterbury Theatre, May, 1821, the performance being for the benefit of Mr. G. Questead and family. (Behind.) Speak the address? Who, me? I can't indeed! Prompter. Why, sir, your name's announced, so pray proceed! They'll grow impatient! Major H. Well, upon my word, Was ever anything half so absurd! You can't be serious? Prompter. Sir, 'tis very true. Major H. O! mighty pretty. (Enters with a paper.) Ladies, pray what say you? My name's announced, he says, and I not know it! And then what's here! The deuce is in the poet— 'Tis arrant tragedy! all rant and whine! Upon my life I couldn't speak a line; Observe these lineaments—peruse each feature— Ladies, is this a face for doleful metre? Say, am I fit to cry “alack for pity,” Or quaver out some lamentable ditty, Recite a dismal tale of woe on woes, While sad complainings murmur through my nose? But hold! I may be wrong—methinks you smile, Perhaps “I do mistake me all this while.” By Jupiter, it may be worth the trying— How I should like to set you all a-crying! But then I'm shy—too diffident by half,— Faith, I will venture it, but pray don't laugh. Thus, then, the bard. (Reads.) No common claims to-night Thalia's vot'ries to her fane invite; The sympathizing Muse, to Pity true, Appeals to mild Benevolence—and you— Warmly implores your gen'rous aid to raise The hopes of him who once knew better days: Nor vain the call, for when did Beauty's ear Affliction's suppliant voice disdain to hear, Or when did Beauty's bounty fail to flow To soothe Misfortune's child, and heal his woe? Ye who have viewed on this eventful night The manly Leon guard a husband's right, Or sat and gaily smiled with genuine glee At cozen'd Peres (that's a hit at me!), By his own arts and vanity betray'd, And Estifania's wiles (confound the jade!), Our task perform'd, reflect with cheerful heart, Ye too have play'd, and play'd a noble part! And O! may still such parts your minds engage, Through Life's great drama on the world's wide stage! And when, with many a well-play'd act between, Ye reach at length, the last, the closing scene, Then shall the good and wise your efforts cheer, And mark your exit with th' approving tear; No snarling critic vex with envious brawls, But Heaven applaud you, when the curtain falls. Ballad. IN IMITATION OF HAFIZ, DELLA CRUSCA, AND CO. Vide the “Baviad” and “Mæviad.” Where yon rock o'erhangs the billow, Bending o'er its shaggy brow, Lord Alphonso, crowned with willow, Viewed the black abyss below. “Cease,” he cried, “thou stormy ocean; Hush thy roaring waves to rest, Cease thy wild, tempestuous motion— Emblem of my troubled breast. “Once my heart beat high with pleasure, Once the joys of life were mine; Plundered of my dearest treasure, Now my bosom swells like thine. “O Matilda! perjured beauty, Thou couldst all my woes dispel; Why forsake, unheeding duty, One who loved so long—so well. “Thou hast left me, too deceiving— Left me pressed with grief and care; Sighs my tortured breast are heaving; All my refuge is despair! “Sadly now I view each morrow, Vainly now the past regret; What can soothe a wretch's sorrow Whelmed at once in love and debt? “No! to regions immaterial, Far from want and woe, I'll fly; Thus I rush to realms aërial— All below is all my eye!” Wild he spake, his ringlets tearing, Swift as tigers on their prey To the margin rushed, despairing— Blew his nose, and walked away! The Resolution; OR, AN ADIEU TO THE COUNTRY. O I'll be off! I will by Jove! No more by purling streams I'll ramble, Through dirty lanes no longer rove, Bemired and scratch'd by briar and bramble. I'll fly the pigstye for the parks, And Jack and Tom and Ned and Billy I'll quit for more enlightened sparks, And Romney Marsh for Piccadilly. Adieu, ye woods! adieu, ye groves! Ye waggon-horses, ploughs, and harrows! Ye capering lambs! ye cooing doves! Adieu, ye nightingales and sparrows! Adieu, ye nasty little boys, So sweetly in the puddles playing! Adieu, adieu, the cheerful noise Of grunting pigs and asses braying! O, I'll begone! at once farewell To gooseberry wine, and pear, and codling! Farewell the sheep's harmonious bell! Farewell the gander's graceful waddling! Farewell the compost's sweet perfume! Farewell rum-punch, nectareous liquor! Farewell the pimples that illume The noses of the squire and vicar! Adieu my pipe! not that of old By swains Arcadian tuned so gaily, But that of modern frame and mould Invented by Sir Walter Raleigh. And I'll renounce my dog and gun, And “bob” no more for eels in ditches; The huntsman, horn, and hounds I'll shun, And I'll cashier my leather breeches! For me the fox may prowl secure, The partridge unmolested fly, Whist, loo, and cribbage I abjure, And e'en backgammon's lures defy. At country “hops,” at county balls, At christening treats no more I'll be! No more I'll pay my morning calls, Nor with old ladies take my tea! Adieu the vestry and the bench, The rate and justice's approval, The overseer, refract'ry wench, Appeal, and order of removal. The fair, its gingerbread and toys, Rough roads, deep ruts, and boist'rous weather, Ye scenes of bliss, ye rural joys, Adieu! and, Bless ye, altogether! Encomium Irregulare. Of all the joys that sweeten life, The joy that charms me most, Is to sit at one's ease, With the fire at one's knees, And read the Morning Post. And hark! two taps—'tis the postman raps! Away, away, away! Bring the muffins and the urn And the rest of the concern, With the milk, eggs, and sugar, on the tray; Oh! brightly burns the fire as the paper thus I roast, Like me, eager to devour the steaming Morning Post! What's here?—Oh dear! “A certain Noble Peer Fought a duel with Sir John and was wounded in the rear.” “The match 'twixt Mr. Hayne And Miss Foote is off again, And Col. B. has thrashed a man and put him in great pain.” —“Effect of Catholic zeal, Last Sunday Mr. Shiel, Ate an Orangeman for breakfast, with all the pips and peel!!” Oh horrible! Oh shocking! Oh how lucky 'tis we boast, Such an orthodox defender in the Morning Post. “Ever charming, ever new, When will the paper tire the view?” “On Monday Mrs. Coutts's plate Was removed to Piccadilly— And a hundred rats, for want of cats, Were devoured by Cribb's dog Billy. On Tuesday, Lady Mary Gave a gala at ‘the Dairy,’ And Miss Laroche, her maid, a fête champêtre in the are.’” Then we've “Lines”—“Poor little Fly! In my tea-cup here you lie! You tumbled in and drowned yourself because you were so dry!” Oh charming! How pathetic! Neither Hamlet nor his Ghost Can raise the tear of sympathy like the tender Morning Post. “The world of fashion's wond'rous hot For Michael Kelly's life;—” “A noble Lord (an excellent shot) Has gone off with a Commoner's wife.” “The King, at Drury Lane, Has heard Der Freischutz o'er again, And Elliston has made a speech, and spoke it pretty plain!” “Last week a poor woman was brought to bed, And hundreds have been to view her, For her baby was born with a pin in its head, And its arm sewn up with a needle and thread; And its lips fastened down with a skewer.” How delightful to sit thus and read what the news is, And what wonderful creatures Dame Nature produces! So I take a sip of tea and a little piece of toast, And sigh to think how near I'm through the charming Morning Post. But stay—“the Argyle Rooms last night Had a brilliant masquerade; The champagne of course was supplied by Wright, Of the Opera Colonnade; We need not say the wine Was pronounced ‘uncommon’ fine, While the ladies swore the ice-creams and the jellies were divine.” “Our Ambassador's new coat, Is all gold from skirt to throat, And the tailor's bill will form a pretty ‘Percy Anecdote;’ For the waiscoat and the breeches Bespeak the wearer's riches; And nothing but gold-thread is used in sewing all the stitches. But this the Noble Lord Can very well afford, So he only asks Lord Liverpool to settle for his sword; To-morrow morn he sallies In the Comet on to Calais. And so to Rheims, where now it seems, His Grace has hired a palace.” Why zooks! I wouldn't give a crown to see him sailing from the coast, Since I'm reading all about it in the clever Morning Post. So talk not to me of your musty old volumes, Your tomes that grave sages and sophists enjoy; Oh what can compare with these elegant columns, Whose contents ever charm us and never can cloy? Hail, pride of the Press! 'tis thy glory I sing of, Long, long may'st thou flourish, thy Laureate I— Bob Southey himself could not make anything of The rest, with thy fame should they venture to vie. Through the Strand though thy horns be no longer resounding, Ah! silenc'd by “old father antic, the Law,” Yet each boudoir of taste still thy pages are found in, From Burlington Gardens to Bermondsey Spa! Yet thy merits shall Fame go on still advertising, And her trumpet proclaim to each far distant coast, That for all that's delightful, grave, gay, or surprising, The world cannot equal the dear Morning Post. Tim Twaddle. The Victim of Sensibility. Why mourns my Eugene? In his dark eye of blue Why trembles the tear drop to sympathy due? Ah! why must a bosom so pure and refin'd Thus vibrate, all nerve, at the woes of mankind? Yet dear are the drops by Philanthropy shed O'er the victim of Sorrow's unfortunate head, Nor beams there a gem with a ray so divine As the tear that bedews Sensibility's shrine. Say, friend of my soul, then, what story of woe, Thus bids the soft streams of humanity flow; Oh! give thy Lorenzo thy sorrows to share, And together we'll mourn for the child of despair. Like a sunbeam the clouds of the tempest between, A smile lights the eye of the pensive Eugene; And thus in soft accents the mourner replies, “Hang your mustard! it brings the tears into my eyes.” Charades. I . My first on a schoolboy your bounty bestows, Though 'tis commonly seen at the end of his nose; My second you'll say, when my whole you explore, Which once upon two legs walked proud at Mysore; Now in town, less majestic, it capers on four. Ans. Tippoo, an Italian greyhound. II. Go, if my first you'd seek aright, And find her in yon dark-blue sky, With many a starry gem bedight, In sweet but mournful majesty. If on some dark and dismal shore, Through clouds and gloom your footsteps stray, My second of my first implore, To guide thee on thy dreary way. And if, perchance, you'd find my whole, See where it sleeps in soft repose, And to the contemplative soul A thousand nameless charms bestows! Ans. Moonlight. III. I can tip you my first, I can tell you my second, For Fire and for Physic most famous I'm reckoned; Of my name any more are you anxious to know? You will find it consists of a word and a blow. Ans. Wakley, the Coroner. Enigma. To be called by my name you would highly disdain, Though with titles of honour I rank in the list; By law and by custom I single remain, Though unless I am double I cannot exist. Ans. A Fellow. The Rival Josephs. That all Joes have not the alertness, mental and bodily, of our friends Joe Hume and Joe Grimaldi, we lament; “'tis true, 'tis pity, and pity 'tis 'tis true.” In fact, each of these worthies may be considered a sort of “Double-Joe,” uniting in himself the activity and talents of any two ordinary Josephs. The following Foe-cular lines, written by a facetious gentleman, now no more, in the interval of ringing a bell and the servant making his appearance, exhibit a pleasing specimen of a Joe of a different class. Would you see a man that's slow, Come and see our footman Joe, Most unlike the bounding roe, Or an arrow from a bow, Or the flight direct of crow, Is the pace of footman Joe. Snails, contemptuous as they go, In their motions outrun Joe, Crabs that hobble to and fro, Look behind and laugh at Joe, An acre many a man could mow, Ere across it creepeth Joe. Danube, Severn, Trent, and Po, Backward to their source might flow, Ere dispatch be made by Joe. Letters to a Plenipo, Send not by our footman Joe. Would you Job's full merit know, Ring the bell, and wait for Joe. Is your purse or credit low, Let your debts be paid by Joe; Legal process none can show, If your lawyers move like Joe. EPITAPH. Death, at last, our common foe, Must trip up the heels of Joe, And a stone shall tell below How, scarce changed, sleepeth Joe: For when the final trump shall blow, The last that comes will still be Joe. Verses, Supposed to be Written by Alexander “Kitchener,” in the Desolate Island of “Porridge, in St. Martin's-in-the-Fields.” I am partial to table and tray, My taste there is none can dispute, Ragout, fricandeau, entremet, I'm a judge of fish, flesh, fowl, and fruit; Oh, Wilberforce, where is the charm You and Butterworth find in a grace? Unless I've my turbot quite warm, Better dine on a horrible plaice! O'er the rich smoking viands to preach, Should be left for your love-feasts alone; So books on good eating still teach, In particular, vide my own; But your thorough-bred saints, it is plain, Cooling soup with indifference see, Let the sparkles subside from Champagne— Their tameness is shocking to me. Ye haunches of fat buck or doe, In kindness bestow'd upon men, Could I drive this curs'd gout from my toe, How soon I'd attack you again! My palate I then might regale On a white or a brown fricassee; Dispatch a hen-pheasant or quail, Or a basin of dear Callipee. Callipee! oh, what pleasure untold Resides in that rapturous word; More than Sybarite banquets of old, Or the modern cuisine can afford! But the sound of the sweet dinner bell At this moment excites but my spleen; For no more, with its once pleasing knell, It announces the smoking tureen. Ye Doctors, who're making your sport, At each twinge which compels me to roar; In pity convey some report Of the taverns I visit no more! Mr. Cuff, does he now and then send A wish or a thought after me? Oh, say Mr. Kay is my friend, Though the Albion no longer I see. How sweet is a turkey and chine! Ah, who from a dory could fly? A carp stewed in port, how divine! How enchanting a perigord pie! When I think on a sweetbread ragout, In a transport I start from my chair, But the sight of my flannels and shoe Soon hurries me back to despair. Come, wheel me away to my nest, There let me in dreams yet partake Of those dainties, the choicest and best, Which fly me, alas! when awake; A flask near my pillow, too, place, Since old Sherry (Madeira's now out) Is considered not bad for my case, And half reconciles me to the Gout. The Relic; Or, the Antiquary and the Patriot. A CANTERBURY TALE, FOUNDED ON FACT. This story owes its origin to the exuberant loyalty of a certain Justice Jacks, an inhabitant of Lowestoft. When George II., in the course of one of his voyages from Germany, was driven by stress of weather on the coast of Suffolk, he landed and slept a night under the roof of the delighted Justice. This event is still (1818) recorded by an inscription on the mantel-piece in the room occupied by the Monarch; while the “curiosity” which forms the subject of the poem, properly labelled, long after made a conspicuous figure in Mr. Jacks's museum. At his death it descended with the rest of his collection of rarities to his daughters, two maiden ladies, in whose possession it was seen by the gentleman (the Rev. — Warburton, rector of Lydd) from whom I had the anecdote. R. H. B. CANTO I. 'TIS sweet to some, Lucretius used to say, To sit on the Marine Parade at Brighton, And gaze upon the sea some stormy day When from the Steyne the beaux huge rain-drops frighten, To hear the thunder roll, and see it lighten Round the toss'd vessels labouring in the bay; And, as their masts appear to bore the sky there, Cry “Ah, poor devils! rather you than I ther e Some folks there are who round Hyde Park to rattle With glowing wheels think mighty pretty sport, Some—Wellington for one—enjoy a battle, Others prefer a minuet at Court; Some, like the great 'Squire Coke, delight in cattle, Ploughs, Porkers, and Merino Wool—in short Tastes vary, which may elsewhere well be seen, as In Horace, book i. ode I, “To Mecænas.” All have their hobbies then, and who dare chide 'em If some than others take a wider scope, And, when they once are fairly mounted, ride 'em What Geoff: Gambado calls au grand Galop? (O'Connell and Dick Shiel, we can't abide 'em, Last summer made a pony of the Pope; This in parenthesis) meanwhile few carry on A tort more briskly than your Antiquarian— Your genuine rubbish-hunter, one who'll lecture An hour by the clock on some old pot or pan, Proving its lid the absolute shield of Hector, Gog, Fin M'Coul, or some such mighty man; Of Roman coins (so called), a great Collector, With porcelain demi-devils from Japan, A porer o'er each old (or new) inscription, Coptic or Cockney, Runic or Egyptian. And such a one fond memory now recalls, The plain brown bob and specs with shagreen cases, The ample vest, the ginger-colour'd smalls That scorn'd the adventitious aid of braces; The massive buckle which each foot enthrals In sober radiance, a bright oasis On the dark desert of the well-black'd shoe; (A metaphor, we fear, not over new). Yes, such a one there was—mind was, not is; 'Tis good to be particular in tenses, Since to be hinted at as Bore or Quiz To many matter of most grave offence is, Producing great contortions of the phiz, And disavowals are esteem'd pretences; 'Tis best the Present therefore to eschew, And use the Perfect or the Preter-plu. So we'll say was—and 'twas his joy to seek (Passion, I might say, 'twas in him so furious,) Things rare and precious, modern or antique; And, though in other matters most penurious, He'd rather far go dinnerless a week Than fail to appropriate ought he fancied curious In earth, or sea, or air—no matter what, So it was old, and others had it not. And, sooth to say, he had a choice collection Of various ugly, odd, old-fashioned things, Such as, when duly labelled for inspection, Make Virtuosi happier far than kings, Though void of meaning, order, or connection; One can't tell how or whence their value springs, Whether intrinsic, or from some relation Extraneous, which Locke calls Association; Such as a Handkerchief of Charles the Martyr's, A piece of Pig-tail chew'd by Captain Cook; An idol worshipp'd by the Calmuc Tartars, A Gong, and an Arcadian Shepherd's Crook; King David's Tuning-hammer, Nell Gwyn's Garters, With here and there some queer black-letter Book; The Editio princeps of Tom Sternhold's Psalter, Guy Vaux's Lanthorn, and Jack Thurtell's Halter. Here, stiff and stuff'd, appear two full-grown Gulls, A group of cock-tail'd kittens and their mother, A Chinese Joss, a pair of Scottish Mulls, Used by King Malcom Canmore and his brother; Lord Russell's Breeches, one of Cromwell's Skulls, (Oxford and Naseby each can boast another, We've seen them, Reader, and 'twill pose you, when you in- Spect them, to say which of the three's most genuine). Some local specimens were also there, The spoils of many a neighbouring monument; A piece of granite, chipt from off the chair In which they whilom crown'd the Kings of Kent, A stone from Becket's shrine, a fragment rent From the proud surcoat, which sublime in air Waves o'er Black Edward's tomb, the very dress he Skewer'd certain French in on the Field of Cressy. These the Cathedral furnish'd, while of date More modern there were some, as lately hinted, A Mustard-pot of George the Third's, a Plate With coronet and crest thereon imprinted, Used by Lord North when Minister of State; The glass through which John Wilkes, the Patriot, squinted, More recent still, a Linch-pin from the Gig By Hunt and Probert driv'n to Gills Hill Lane, A tail from Harry Brougham's forensic wig, A thimble used by Ferdinand of Spain; Also the Os coccygis of Tom Paine, Which Cobbett at New York contriv'd to dig; A relic of Napoleon too, I mean a Button O'Meara brought from St. Helena. From these few last memorials one might guess That Mister Jones (his name), with all his priggery, Was Radically giv'n; I must confess He had acquired a trifling spice of Whiggery, And once (long since) concocted an Address, Which, fully bent on cutting no small figure, he Had stuffed with “Injured Queen,” “heart-rending woe,’ And quantum sufficit of “Unsunn'd Snow.” Of course he ever felt a great regard For patriotism and patriotic men, He almost worshipp'd them, and thought it hard They were so scarce; five miles, or even ten, He'd walk at any time, so his reward Might be to see a patriot—fancy then His joy one day, when some kind neighbour went And told him Joseph was come into Kent. Who has not heard of Joseph? not the lad Who some four thousand years ago at Cairo Drove Mrs. Potiphar exceeding mad, And afterwards was Premier to King Pharaoh; Nor he whose works in folio my grand-dad Priz'd far 'bove those of Flaccus or of Maro, Josephus, of the self-same name and nation, (Till he abjured them both to please Vespasian). Who has not heard of Joseph? here 'tis plain I do not speak of Buonaparte's brother, Whom Wellington sent packing out of Spain, Nor him at Long's once lock'd up by his mother, Miss Foote's pea-green pretender, Joseph Hayne, Nor Joe Grimaldi, sire or son—another And greater far I mean, him whom in France They'd call The Joseph, The par excellence. He was forsooth a great Arithmetician, Had all the Ready Reckoner at command, And, having been a sort of Sub-Physician, Now came to test the water of the Land, Which he pronounced in a most vile condition, So bad in fact 'twas clear things could not stand; The antipous of Leibnitz, still his song Ran ever thus, “Whatever is is wrong.” O Politics, sublimest Recreation,— In faith I must apostrophise ye here! Without ye what were man? what conversation Could e'er subsist o'er Port, Gin-twist, or Beer, (According to the tippler's taste and station)? Without your aid useless the human ear; Without it useless too the human tongue— One can't discuss the weather all day long. O Polities! without ye many a warm man (In City phrase we speak), had wanted bread, Through every age since first the Conqu'ring Norman Shot Harold (not the Pilgrim) through the head: What were O'Shiel, O'Connell, and O'Gorman, And the other O.'s who make ye now a trade, Without ye?—Cobbett with his corn so boasted? Or Hunt with his—one raw, the other roasted? O Politics!—but gently Madame Muse, Your Pegasus has a vile trick of bolting; 'Tis bad, indeed it is, this breaking loose, Digressions are in general revolting; But always when one's looking after news, So pull your curb up sharp, Ma'am, rein your colt in, And turn his head to Wright's Hotel, the Fountain, Where you'll find Jones, and Joseph just dismounting. CANTO II. Kent in the Commentaries Cæsar writ Is call'd the civilest place in all the Isle, And Jones resolved it should not lose a whit Of character through him; his civilest smile, His very civilest bow and all his wit, He brought to greet the patriot without guile, And cried while making a profound salam, “You're the Great Patriot, Sir?”—Quoth Joe, “I am.” “Your worship is right welcome into Kent!” Said Jones, and now again he bow'd his back, “We've few like you” (once more his body bent, “Fame like the wind” (his ‘Gingers’ gave a crack,) “Resistless when it once hath found a vent, Hath far and wide blown your great reputation For counting, casting up, and calculation; “Sir, I do reverence a man of nous, A Patriot I do love, alive or dead; And, if you'll deign to visit my poor house, I will essay to furnish forth a ‘spread’ Fit for a Scotchman—there's a brace of grouse, Some cocky-leeky, and a sing'd sheep's-head; I fear a pudding boiled in a bag is A sorry substitution for a haggis.” Jones paus'd and bowed once more—the pawkie Scot Knew well “a pin a day's a groat a year,” And that “a dinner sav'd 's a dinner got,” Then his mouth watered at the dainty cheer. Yes, dainty, reader, though you like it not, Nor I—but Joseph doth—besides 'tis clear That, though in Magna Charta he delights, He somehow can't endure a Bill of Wright's. Not with more pleasure therefore he, for pith And piety alike renown'd o'er all, Penzance's Pride, the Reverend Boatswain Smith, Hears to a “Love Feast,” an “harmonious call”; Not with more pleasure Sisters Fry and Frith Enraptured listen to his holy drawl, Than Joseph lent an ear to this kind proffer, At once embracing Jones and Jones's offer. In vain the waiter, with imploring face, Exhibits his long chronicle of stews, His fish from turbot down to humble plaice, His roast and boil'd, fricandeaux and ragouts, All the varieties o' the feather'd race, Goose, spring-chick, duckling—Joseph doth refuse; “I'll thank you, Sir”—these were his sole commands— “To get some water just to wash my hands.” Your Scottish toilette's no such long affair, But much like that of Ponto, Don, or Rover, A shake, a wipe, five fingers through the hair (If any hair there be), and all is over; Dress too's so much beneath a patriot's care That Joseph soon was ready to break cover, So, taking Jones's arm, the pair withdrew, Sam Samuel Wright, Esq., the worthy host of an excellent tavern, where you are sure of good entertainment “whether you are a man or a horse.” He is, we believe, the natu maximus of a triumvirate of brothers who for many years past “Each in a separate Kentish town Have kept the Ship, the Fountain, and the Crown!” and his waiter looking rather blue. “Heaven sends us meat” (thus ancient proverbs go), “The devil sends cooks,” they add, and quite as truly, If Scotland be design'd the place in quo, And Janet, Jones's “help,” had come but newly To Christendom direct from “Edinbro”; Of course that day the genial banquet duly With “crowdy,” “collops,” “haggis,” was supplied, And Heaven knows how much nastiness beside. Now fancy, gentle reader, dinner done, Fancy the filth remov'd, and all the dwelling, Like ropes of rotten onions in the sun, Of these most “villainous rank compounds” smelling. Fancy the whisky-toddy just begun— And Jones in ecstacy while Joseph's telling The abuses he intends to “sweep away,” And all the good he means to do—some day. “First, I'll re-organize the Church—that's flat— Confiscate her revenues to the nation; Instead of tythe and offering and all that, As soon as he has finished his oration, The clerk shall carry round the parson's hat, Collecting halfpence from the congregation, And in the open air—no church or steeple— 'Twill make him more respected by the people. “Then for the Bench—old proverbs still declare, As they've been handed down to us by our mothers, ‘Each man's the best judge of his own affair;’ And what then can he want with any others? So we'll get rid of all the ‘learned brothers,’ And all their superfluity of hair; Coifs, gowns, and robes—in fact, despite of Guelph, I mean to do away with Law itself. “Think what a saving there will be in wigs— Buz, bush, and bird's nest, such as Parr's and Paley's, Those too in which the lawyers ‘queer the prigs,’ Fine full forensic ones ‘wi' sma' wee tailies,’ ‘The family’ will merry be as grigs Freed from all fear of Park and both the Old Baileys; All powerless then to ‘Brixtonise’ or gibbet 'em, While every man may live—and thieve ad libitum. “Then as to Greece”—the Patriot stops because He sees his host has dropt into a doze Tranquilly sound, an inference which he draws From the deep respirations of his nose; At once he brings abruptly to a close His lengthy lecture upon wigs and laws— Then transfers to his pocket, without any stir, Some dozen lumps of sugar from the canister. That done, indignant at the slight thus shown Unto his oratorical display, Just as he was proceeding to make known (A fact we don't get hold of every day) The best mode of expending a Greek loan— He snatches up his hat and walks away: Telling the curtseying Janet, as he past her In the hall, “by no means to disturb her master.” Nor was it till some half-hour had gone by, That Jones, who had been dreaming of the devil, Woke in a fright; but when he cast his eye On Joseph's chair, presentiment of evil, Flash'd on his mind, he felt how “d—d uncivil” A quiet snooze seems to a sitter by; Then too his friend's retreat had spoil'd his plan, “Janet!” he roars, “why where's the gentleman?” And when he found that he was gone indeed, Without one “frail memorial” left behind; Away he trotted at his utmost speed Back to the Fountain, much disturbed in mind That after all he should so ill succeed, Nor bear away a relic of some kind From this the pink of patriot perfection, To add unto his “rich and rare” collection. An autograph, a glove, a pinch of snuff, Or any little thing by way of sample; His very shoe-string had been quite enough, His cotton pocket-handkerchief most ample, Or some more trifling article, for example, The pins he found and stuck upon his cuff. But he has pass'd—a vision of the night, A meteor gleam, as transient and as bright. Joseph, by this, had got half way to Dover, So all that Jones can do's to catechise The chambermaid and waiters, to discover If he had left aught which might be a prize. A shilling, given to either one or t'other, Identified, were precious in his eyes. Alas! he had only given a nod to Sam, To chambermaid a kiss, to “boots” a d—n. Alas for Jones! Now doth he fret and fume! When Betty, chambermaid, at length bethought her, “Perhaps there's something in the dressing-room?” Fired at the thought, around the neck he caught her; Then rush'd and saw to dissipate his gloom, Where stood a trifling modicum of water, The same in which, so Betty doth insist, The Patriot had lately wash'd his fist. Oh! not such rapture, Mister St. John Long Feels when he grasps a patient's glittering fee, Oh! scarce more rapture, Paton, queen of song, Pouring the full tide of her harmony, Darts through each breast amidst the listening throng, Than Jones experienced, as in ecstasy He sprang upon the fluid, seized the tottle, And cork'd it up securely in a bottle. And there, a label duly fixed upon it, It stands his richest gem; and daily press Sage antiquaries round to gaze and con it, And Mister Ellis that great A. S. S. Hath promised to write a paper on it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POLITICAL SKITS, PARODIES, Etc. Waddington's Name. Tune—“While History's Muse.” While Johnny Gale Jones the memorial was keeping Of penny subscriptions from traitors and thieves, Hard by, at his elbow, sly Watson stood peeping, And counting the sums at the end of the leaves. But, oh! what a grin on his visage shone brightly, When, after perusing whole pages of shame, 'Midst his soi disant betters, In vilely-formed letters, The Doctor beheld little Waddington's name! “Hail, imp of sedition!” he cried, while he nodded His head, and the spectacles drew from his eyes; “Magnanimous pigmy! Since Carlile's been quodded, We wanted some shopman, about of your size! For though many we've had, yet unbless'd was their lot, When Murray and Sharpe with the constable came, And for want of good bail They were sent off to jail, And the mittimus signed with an alderman's name. Then come, the last crown of thy toils is remaining, The greatest, the grandest that thou hast yet known; Though proud was thy task my placard board sustaining, Still prouder to utter placards of thine own! High perched on that counter where Carlile once stood, “Little Waddington,” as he was called, was employed during the imprisonment of Carlile, the infidel publisher, to conduct the sale of seditious works at the latter's shop in Fleet Street. He sat concealed behind a sliding panel, through which the money was paid, when the book required was dropped down from a room above. Waddington was tried, in 1820, for sedition, and acquitted. The above parody was, by an error of the editor, included in the “Remains of Theodore Hook.” Issue torments of blasphemy, treason, and shame, While snug in your box, Well secured with two locks, We'll defy them to get little Waddington's name. My Adieu to a “Man of Sense.” A PARODY. Fare thee well! and since for ever, Why, for ever fare thee well! Though relenting now—thou never 'Gainst me shalt again rebel. Why, not, Husky! look before thee, Ere the fatal leap was ta'en, When that sulky fit came o'er thee? Place thou ne'er shalt fill again! Though the Whigs for this commend thee, As thy lengthen'd face they view, Even praises must offend thee, Coming from so base a crew. Why not check thy fond presumption, While retreat I'd yet allow; “Huskisson's a man of gumption, Let him truckle—he knows how.” Should some other Sub resemble, Let him, too, remember thee; And from thy example, tremble At the thought of bullying me. Grant and Palmerston, thou knowest, Dudley, too, thou well may'st know, Grumbled that thus out thou goest, Therefore out with thee they go. Yes, 'tis done—all words are idle, Notes from thee are vainer still, The contempt I cannot bridle Makes its way against my will. Get thee gone!—thus disunited, Forc'd from every worthier tie; By Tories scorn'd, by Whiglings slighted, Lower than this thou scarce canst lie. Arthur. The London University; OR, STINKOMALEE TRIUMPHANS. An Ode to be performed on the opening of the New College of Grafton Street East. Whene'er with pitying eye I view, Each operative sot in town, I smile to think how wondrous few Get drunk who study at the U- niversity we've Got in town, niversity we've Got in town. What precious fools “The People” grew, Their Alma Mater not in town; The “useful classes” hardly knew Four was composed of two and two, Until they learned it at the U- niversity we've Got in town. But now they're taught by Joseph Hu- me, by far the cleverest Scot in town, Their items and their tottles too; Each may dissect his sister Sue, From his instructions at the U- niversity we've Got in town. Then Lansdowne comes, like him how few Can caper and can trot in town, In pirouette and pas de deux— He beats the famed Monsieur Giroux, And teaches dancing at the U- niversity we've Got in town. And Gilchrist, see, that great Gentoo- Professor, has a lot in town Of Cockney boys, who fag Hindoo, And larn Fem-nasties at the U- niversity we've Got in town. Sam Rogers' corpse of vampire hue, Comes from its grave to rot in town; For Bays the dead bard's crowned with Yew, And chaunts the Pleasures of the U- niversity we've Got in town. Frank Jeffrey, of the Scotch Review,— Whom Moore had nearly shot in town, Now with his pamphlet stitched in blue And yellow, d—ns the other two, But lauds the ever-glorious U- niversity we've Got in town. Great Birkbeck, king of chips and glue, Who paper oft does blot in town, From the Mechanics' Institu- tion, comes to prate of wedge and screw, Lever and axle at the U- niversity we've Got in town. Lord Waithman, who long since withdrew From Mansion-house to cot in town; Adorned with chair of ormolu, All darkly grand, like Prince Le Boo, Lectures on Free Trade at the U- niversity we've Got in town. Fat Favell, with his coat of blue, Who speeches makes so hot in town, In rhetoric spells his lectures through, And sounds the V for W, The vay they speak it at the U- niversity we've Got in town. Then Hurcombe comes, who late at New- gate-market, sweetest spot in town! Instead of one clerk popped in two! To make a place for his ne-phew, Seeking another at the U- niversity we've Got in town. There's Captain Ross, a traveller true, Has just presented, what in town- 's an article of great virtu, (The telescope he once peep'd through, And 'spied an Esquimaux canoe On Croker Mountains), to the U- niversity we've Got in town.

The Spots in the Sun. Large Spots in the Sun”—How alarming the state Of the year eighteen hundred and twenty and eight— 'Tis awful to fancy, when all's said and done, What mischiefs are caused by the “Spots in the Sun.” The Courier declares that to those it was owing, That we had in August such raining and blowing; While steam-engines, steam-boats, and Perkins's gun, Combined to produce these strange “Spots in the Sun.” Whatever the cause, the effect is too clear, We'd such very odd weather for that time of year: Odd things have been ended, more odd things begun, And all it would seem, through the “Spots in the Sun.” At Lisbon, where blockheads would make John Bull try For the deuce can tell what, and the deuce can tell why, A throne has been lost, and a crown has been won, And all, it is said, through these “Spots in the Sun.” In Dublin with Dan, and the rest of the gang, When some would “conciliate,” others would hang, George Dawson recants, just as Brownlow has done, And shows what his friends think a “Spot in the Sun.” When young Perceval turned to the same way of thinking, Whose sire from the cause never once thought of shrinking; Sam Rogers declared—(he's so fond of a pun)— That the Tories would call it a “Spot in the Son.” At Stinkomalee there's confusion and bother, Tom Campbell's new lecture makes way for another By Ma'amselle Le Normand, who now has begun To compose a whole course on the “Spots in the Sun.” But ah! rest not there, “Brightest star of the nation;” Call in thy professor of Haerostation, And send Jemmy Green, On the one hundredth ascent of Mr. Green, the aëronaut, he was reported by the ‘Times’ to have bestridden a favourite pony who accompanied him. The fact was denied by the ‘Morning Post.’ as the Times says was done, Upon horseback, to scrub out the “Spots in the Sun.” Greece. A King for Greece!—a King for Greece! —Wanted a “Sovereign Prince” for Greece! For the recreant Knight Hath broken his plight, Some say from policy, some from fright, Some say in hope to rule for his niece, He hath refused to be King over Greece. A King for Greece!—a King for Greece! Where shall we find a King for Greece? Score after score, A hundred and more, Candidates crowd round the Treasury door, From Athens, and Thebes, and the Peloponnese, All of them eager to reign over Greece. Big O exclaims “Be the diadem mine! I spring from chiefs of an ‘iligant’ line, The Mahonites swear If to stand I should dare I shall ne'er again sit for the County of Clare. Oh! what will I do should Parliament cease? Oh! make me the Sovereign Prince of Greece!” Now naye, now naye, thou vagabond Dan, In faith thou never mayst be the man, Thou'lt cringe, and cry, And bully, and lie, Yet shrink from danger whene'er it comes night! A Skulker in war, a Braggart in peace, Thou never mayst be the Prince of Greece. “Oh! I'll be King, and the Nation shall thrive, And I'll make one halfpenny pass for five! Subscribe! Subscribe! Ye Chaw-bacon tribe, Give Peel and Wellington each a bribe; 'Twill cost no more than a penny a-piece, To buy Will. Cobbett the crown of Greece!” Now spare, now spare, thou grey-headed sinner, The poor-man's purse for the poor-man's dinner! In vain thou'dst rob it, To mob it, and job it, Thou never mayst reign, thou wicked Will. Cobbett! Traitor to all parties, all to fleece, A Vampyre were better than thou for Greece. “Oh! I'll be King!—oh! I'll be King! And the people for joy shall dance and sing. For Lords shall mix With Layers of Bricks, And Chimney-sweeps ride in their coaches and six; Then shout, boys, shout, nor your clamouring cease Till Henry Hunt is the Monarch of Greece.” Now naye, now naye, thou vain Blacking-man, Thou wert fitter by far to be King of Japan; Thy Reps, and Rapscallions, And Tatterdemallions, With their whitey-brown hats and their pewter medallions, Fit subjects they for the new Police, They never shall make thee the King of Greece! “Now tell me the price! now tell me the price! Don't stand shilly-shally, nor be over-nice; No matter how high, I'll buy, I'll buy! Then who'll be so great or so grand as I? In my diamond tiara and ermined pelisse, No longer a Duchess but Queen of Greece!” Now naye, proud Duchess, now naye, now naye, No Queen, but Quean, which is spelt with an a! Full shameful, I ween, It were in a Queen To tipple Kürsch Wasser and proof Maraschin, Now naye, now naye!—thy maudlin caprice Shall never, O never, give law to Greece! A King for Greece!—Oh, who may he be?— “Ye'll just gie the ‘Souveran Croon’ to me! The Siller's the thing That maks a gude King; To sic a fine pass the ‘revanue’ I'll bring, Ye'll see the whole ‘tottle hoorly’ increase, Gin ye'll mak Joey the King o' Greece!” Now naye, now naye, thou pawkie auld Scot, Thy knaverie is not so soon forgot, Thy tricks in the Loan Are far too well known, Thou'dst “rob the Exchequer,” and call it thine own! Now naye, friend Joey, ne'er think us such Geese That a Fox like thee should be King over Greece. Alas! for Greece!—Alas! for Greece! We never shall find a fit King for Greece; That Royal pair, “Lance” and Chabert, Monsieur Chabert was a sort of conjurer, who, in addition to the title of Fire King, claimed, like his royal predecessor the “Pontic Monarch,” immunity from the effects of poison. Unhappily for him, Mr. Wakley, the editor of the “Lancet,” thought proper to take up the cudgels in the interests of science; and very soon proved that a fire of his kindling and prussic acid of his preparing were not matters to be trifled with. Are both of them burning to blaze away there, Like William and Mary on a half-crown piece, With heads conjoined to reign over Greece. That never may be!—That never may be! Though Satan were joined to make Fire-Kings three; No Quackified Gander, Nor red Salamander, May sit where sat Macedon's Great Alexander: Oh! had we Sovereigns fiery as these Who might insure the safety of Greece? Alas for Greece!—our hopes decrease— We must look for a King among the Chinese! There's Dombrowsky, And Poniatowsky, Soltikoffs twenty, And Romanoffs plenty, Mastuchiewitz, Tchitchagoff, (Enough to give a witch a cough,) Pole and Russ, All making a fuss, With Germans and Dutch, The sceptre to clutch— Van Rump, Van Frump, Van Beest, and Van Trump! There's Prince Esterhazy, So rich and so lazy; There's Prince Emilius, Looking so bilious; And Count Capo d'Istery, Famous in History; With Wirtemberg Paul, And the Devil and all, French, Swiss, Spanish, and Piedmontese, All of them mad to reign over Greece! Oh, Jupiter! Sire of Gods and Men, To thine own Olympus return again! Bring back Mercurius, Thy son, though spurious, And Phœbus, and Juno, And Hebe, whom you know; Sweet little Cupid, Who strikes people stupid, With Bacchus and Venus, And Pan and Silenus, And the rest, who at school used so much to chagrin us! Restore, once more, To thy Classical Shore Her “bright golden Age” and her “Glories of Yore!” (Two phrases I've borrowed from honest Tom Moore), From fierce Seraskiers, Whisker'd up to the ears; From Slaves, And Knaves, And Fools, And Tools, Thine own fair realm at length release, And send us a Patriot Prince for Greece! La Belle Ordamis. Tune—“March, march, Ettrick and Teviotdale,” March, march, march away, pretty ones, See where the road to distinction's before ye; March, march, country and city ones, Follow the lass that will lead ye to glory. On with the pretty coat—off with the petticoat, Stays and tight-lacing no longer shall teaze us; Cast away all clothes for jacket and small clothes, And hey for a peep into Peloponnesus! March, march, etc. Come then, sweet damsels, all sorts and all sizes, Maids, widows, wives, “unequivocals,” come! Think, only think, girls, how glorious the prize is; Up with the musket and follow the drum! Equal in bustle men—down with the Mussulmen; Bound o'er the rock, o'er the precipice clamber. O! how delightful to get some great frightful Bewhisker'd Grand Turk for a valet de chambre! March, march, etc. Then, little darlings, O, think when you're arming, While each lovely bosom is swelling with pride; The helm how becoming, the white plume how charming, How charming the dear little sword by your side! Teach these he-creatures, in spite of soft features You have spirit enough soon to set them to rights; Handle your daggers well, talk loud and swagger well, Just like Miss Love or Miss Graddon in tights. March, march, etc. And O, when at length your campaigning all over, The Ottomites crush'd and enfranchis'd the Greeks, Ye fly to the arms of some fond faithful lover, And covered with glory get rid of the breeks. The fame of Ordamis, or whatever her name is, Shall live with your own still recorded in story, While fathers cry “D—me, sons, think on the Amazons, They were the girls for gallanting and glory!” March, march, then march away, pretty ones, See where the road to distinction's before ye; March, march, merry, foolish, or witty ones, Follow the lass that will lead you to glory. A London Eclogue. (Scene—A Saloon in Uxbridge House—Time, Noon—A breakfast-table set out—Cafe au lait, red herrings, Scotch marmalade, rizzer'd haddocks, anchovy toast, devil'd kidneys, best gunpowder, muffins buttered on both sides, etc.—Lord Anglesey discovered, solus, on a sofa, in a horizontal position, with his mouth full of muffin, reading the Intelligence;—his lordship's Sunday leg (a Cork one) stands near the fire on the opposite side of the room—A groom of the chambers announces “Mr. O'Connell.”—Enter Dan, hat in hand, bowing and scraping,) Dan. Lord Anglesey, Lord Anglesey!—Good day, my lord, good day! I've just looked in, becase I've got a word or two to say; Jack Lawless told me yesterday, 'tis now beyond a doubt, That you're made Lord-Lieutenant, and to-morrow you set out! Lord A. Dan O'Connell, Dan O'Connell! ragged Jack has told you true; I'm off by steam for Dublin, and so, I suppose, are you: I'm off by steam for Dublin, Dan, and you'll be there ere long, And, Daniel, we'll be friends, my boy—but keep a civil tongue! Dan. Why, that's the thing, Lord Anglesey, I come to speak of now; I'm going over, and I mane to make a precious row! I'll make a precious row, my lord, and rason good you see, Becase they've made ould Doherty a Judge instead of me. I mane to “agitate” the “Gem” as soon as I lave here, And all the “Pisints” from the Giant's Causeway to Cape Clear; I'll lave off whiskey, lave off wine, I'll lave off tay likewise, And take to milk-and-wather, just to bother the Excise! I'll have a run upon the banks— Lord A. Now gently, Mister Dan; If you come here to bully me, you quite mistake your man— Dan. Oh! no, my Lord, you misconsave the maning of my call— Lord A. Then why bare-headed do you come?—or why d'ye come at all? Dan. Ah! asy now, Lord Anglesey, I'll tell yourself that thing; You ax'd me once to dine—maybe you'll do that same next spring; And so I think it's fair to say, whatever I may do, I hope you won't consave that it's meant personal to you! Lord A. Oh! that's it, Daniel, is it?—Now, attend to what I say— (sippeth coffee) I mean to put rebellion down, assume what shape it may— (more muffin) If I'm obliged to hang you, Dan, my duty I must do; But I beg you won't consider it as personal to you! The “Great Agitator” is greatly agitated—puts his hand nervously to his stock—turns white, then red, then whitey-brown—hems—coughs— sneezes—hesitates whether to be impudent, or brush—Spies the Sunday leg across the room.) The Liberator (aside). (Ah! sure he can't get at me; so I'll give him just a taste) (aloud) —Is that the way ye'd sarve me, then, ye big unnat'ral baste! Ye're a Saxon—and a Welshman—and a Liar, to the fore! Ye are, ye big desaver, ye— His Excellency pulleth up his work-a-day leg, a wooden one, from beneath the cushion, and hurleth it, totis viribus, at Dan's head.) Oh, murther! where's the door? (The Leg encountereth the Head, and Dan acknowledgeth the message with immediate prostration—The Lord Lieutenant putteth his best leg foremost, and hoppeth across to get hold of his Sunday one, in order to kick the intruder downstairs—Dan maketh a bolt, throweth open the door, and discovereth the grand staircase, Jack Lawless waiting at the bottom, inter alios flunkies—Dan is seen, like the Flying Dutchman, descending fifteen steps at a time.) His Excellency (from above). John! Thomas! William! Harry! Peter! Honest Jack (from below). Ah! now, what's the fun? The Lord Lieutenant (supra). Kick those confounded rascals— Dan (in mid air). Run! ye Devil's Darling, run! (Tally ho! a fine burst—Hark forward! Dan dashes down the Burlington Arcade—Jack doubles, up Cork Street—the pack divides—“go it!”—Jack tumbles over an old applewoman, drops his new hat, which he had brought away from the Cider Cellar, by mistake, instead of his own old one; hounds at fault—Jack slips through Saville Passage—Stole away! Dan is run to earth by William, Harry, and Peter, at Truefit, the barber's; Lord Uxbridge comes up, and whips off the dogs.) (Grand Hunting Chorus.) Hark! how Vigo Lane, resounding, Echoes to O'Connell's cry! Hark! how all the streets surrounding To his trembling voice reply! etc., etc. (A recheat is winded, and the Curtain drops.) The Mad Dog!!! Mad Dog!—Mad Dog!— A horrid Mad Dog Is running about the town, And all take flight To the left and the right Wherever his nose is shown; For he barks, and he howls, and he snaps, and he yelps, At the Dogs, and the Bitches, and all the little Whelps. Still he keeps roaming, Grinning, and foaming, And Folks know not what to do, For he runs as he goes, And his eyes and his nose, All are running too! His eyes 'tis said, Are “set in his head,” Which makes them the more to quail; I own to me More fearful 'twould be If his eyes were set in his tail! This fierce mad dog, this horrid mad dog, Hath set both country and town agog; Some think 'tis the very Dog Star himself, With his own heat grown delirious; Sam Rogers says “No, It can never be so, As he grins he can't be Sirius.” Everybody dreads abroad to stir All out of fear of this terrible cur. For he hath nibbled a power of folks, Lords and Squires of high degree; The Rich and the Proud, And the Vulgar crowd, Lowly Peasant, or high born Dame, Whoever he bites 'tis all the same, All are gone mad as mad may be! He hath bitten a Parliament man, One Mister ? ?, 'Twas sad to see The poor M.P. When he began to rave; At once, 'tis said, All memory fled, He knew no more what he had done than the dead, Lost all recollection About his election, And his Leicester friends didled in high perfection; They'd bills by the score, But stoutly he swore He'd see them all d—d ere he paid any more. Down to Hastings the Doctors agree Mister — must go and be dipt in the sea. This dog hath bitten the Queen of Song, Alack that it so should be! “Like sweet bells jangled out of tune” Is now all her melody. She hath stooped from her airy height Where she soared a peerless bird, With kestrel kites and crows obscene For evermore to herd. Alack! that one so fair and so bright, Whom haply we deem'd a thing of light, Should sink to a gulf so dark and so low; Alack, alack! that it should be so! He hath bitten a huge Tom Cat An allusion to the elopement of Miss Paton with Mr. Wood the singer. Of the genuine Yorkshire breed; Alack for “Pussy!” alack! alack! How he cocks up his tail, how he sets up his back, He hath gone very mad indeed.— In his amorous rage He hath pounced on a cage, And borne off the Linnet That sang within it; Oh ne'er was such caterwauling heard As when “Pussy” ran off with that favourite bird. Run, neighbours, run—make no delay, The Dog is snapping at all in his way; He hath laid hold Of a warrior bold Who served for glory and not for gold. The Colonel hath doffed his sabre and plume, He hath gone into the little Green-room, He lectureth there The frail and the fair; Good Lord! how the Thespian heroines stare To hear their Giovanni Who wooed so many, And never was constant a week to any, With air demure and sanctified look, Talking away like a printed book! Some smil'd, some winked, and said with a grin, “'Tis a new farce,—‘The Devil rebuking sin.’” This Dog hath bitten—Oh woe is me!— A Market Gardener of high degree; The fruit and vegetables from Claremont were, it was said, duly consigned to a salesman of Covent Garden Market. Imperial Peas No longer please, An Imperial Crown he burneth to seize! Early Cucumbers, Windsor Beans, Cabbages, Cauliflowers, Brocoli, Greens, Gherkins to pickle, Apples to munch, Radishes fine, five farthings a bunch, Carrots red, and Turnips white, Parsnips yellow no more delight, He spurneth lettuces, onions, and leeks, He would be Sovereign Prince of the Greeks; No more in a row, A goodly show, His Highness's carts to market go! Yet still I heard Sam Rogers hint, He hath no distaste to celery or mint; A different whim Now seizeth him, And Greece for his part may sink or may swim, For they cry that he Would Regent be, And rule fair England from sea to sea; Oh! never was mortal man so mad,— Alack! alack, for the Gardener-lad! Oh horrible! horrible! worse and worse! This Dog is an absolute national curse. That a cur should so presume! To the Parliament House he hath forced his way, No Serjeant-at-arms may keep him at bay, Poor Robert Quarme Flies in alarm, Rickman and Ley Are as frighten'd as he, He hath bitten great Henry Brougham! 'Twould quite amaze ye To see how crazy This great man grew in his three-tailed jasey. “Fools,” and “Knaves,” And “Rogues,” and “Slaves,” “Smatterers,” “Chatterers,” “Sycophant Flatterers—” Good Lord! what names to the right and left The “puir bodie” threw when of sense bereft; Till up jumped Peel, And to cool his zeal Tipt him a mild “persuader,” Beneath his frown At once sunk down The poor demented upbraider. At once, and why we may well divine, He ceased to bark and began to whine, Since that dose full well I trow He hath not uttered one little “Bow wow.” Rejoice, Rejoice, With heart and with voice, None now will be bitten except by choice, For Alderman Wood, “So Wise, and so Good,” Hath brought in a bill to crush the whole brood. You may now lay hold of a mad-dog's tail, And pull him backwards into a jail, And the Lord May'r, no doubt, Will never let him out Unless he “produce satisfactory bail!” Rejoice, Rejoice, With heart and with voice, All the little Girls and all the little Boys! Let all of us shout, and sing, and say Huzza for Alderman Wood! Huzza! Swing. Scene.—Exterior of Guildhall on the 9th of November—Constables, City Marshals, Watchmen, Fishfags, etc., bivouacking in front—Sir Claudius Hunter is seen through the doorway wringing his hands, and tearing the curling papers out of his hair. Swing! Swing! 'Tis a terrible thing To get an epistle from Captain Swing! Sir Claud has got one, Now he's off like a gun, “My Lord May'r! My Lord May'r, we're for ever undone! Here's a Plot! Here's a Plot! My Lord May'r, I declare The Devil knows what, And the Devil knows where! You run to the Duke, while I run to the King, And show him my note from that terrible Swing!” See he mounts his white horse, And adown Charing Cross, Ye Gods! how he goes, With his knees to his nose, His heels turning inwards, and outwards his toes! “Sir Robert, come down, They'll set fire to the town, And burn my Lord May'r in his gold chain and gown Tell the King, tell the King To be sure not to bring The Duke to Guildhall—he'll be swallow'd by Swing!” Up jumps Sir Charles Flower, “Fetch the Guards from the Tower, Or that Swing all the ‘wittles’ will come and ‘dewour,’ The ‘Wen'son’ and ‘Weal,’ And the wild-ducks and teal, How he'll gobble the turtle as though 'twas cow-heel. Lack-a-daisy! Dear me! My Lord Key! My Lord Key! Who has seen my Lord May'r? where the d—l can he be? Beat the drums, blow the horns, and make all the bells ring, Here's a letter just come from that terrible Swing!” Up jumps Mr. Hobler, The Aldermen's cobbler, Who mends each decision In need of revision, “Let me read, let me read! Ay, here's treason indeed! Oh! what shall we do? Oh! how shall we proceed? “Fall in! Fall in! Short and Tall, Fat and Thin, We must all of us arm, so we'd better begin; Fall in, Prestissimo! Bravo! Bravissimo! That's right, and now I'll be your Generalissimo! Here's Alderman Wood, ‘So Wise and so Good,’ As stout a soldier as ever stood; Here's gallant Farebrother, Just such another, With ex-Lord Mayor Crowder, None ever looked prouder; You may see by his head that he'll never spare powder; And here comes a man full of valour and pith, Magnanimous Joshua Jonathan Smith! “Fall in three deep! Don't be playing bo-peep Behind there—d'ye hear— You M.P.'s in the rear? Lord Waithman and Thompson, what is it you fear? Mr. Deputy Oldham, Do, pray, go and scold 'em, And make 'em come here to the front, as I told 'em, Sir Peter, you're a Knight, And must know how to fight; Sir John Perring's the left, so you look to the right; And lead on that bevy Of troops, light and heavy, With your black-handled sword that you wore at the Levée. “Here's Wenables, Alderman Lucas, and Flower; Atkins lives out of town—he'll be here in an hour; Why, aye, here's a body-guard fit for a King, We'll tickle your toby, be sure, Mr. Swing!” Here he comes, here's Sir Claud; how he rides and he bawls; How he gallops through Fleet Street, and round by St. Paul's; Now he roars might and main, “You may go home again; Cease your fifing and drumming, The King ain't a-coming!” So all the consarn, you perceive, ends a hum in. Alack for the Nation! Our grand preparation Must all be “deferred for another occasion.” But the meat, Who's to eat All we've dressed for the treat? What becomes of the scaffolding rais'd in the street? And where's the five shillings I've paid for my seat? Do, Ex-Sheriff Kelly, Just hand one a jelly; Sir Charles, as you're picking The bones of that chicken, Pray send me the gizzard, a leg, or a wing; 'Tis a shame, so it is, and a scandalous thing, To be balked of one's “wittles” in this way by Swing! (The Bivouack breaks up in confusion—a rush towards the tables— general scramble—Sir Charles Flower has his fork at his mouth when a jog of the elbow pops it into his eye—Sir Claudius rides off on his white horse with a haunch of venison under his arm, and a hot lobster in each of his holsters—The Lord Mayor is tumbled into a tureen, and smothered—Mr. Figgins falls into a fricandeau, the Recorder into a fit, and Alderman Atkins into the fire—The Grand Glass Star comes down with a crash—Magog is overturned on the heads of the Common Council—The Livery mount and dance a Mazourka on the high table—Crish—Crash—Dash—Smash.—The Curtain falls, amidst general uproar and confusion, as in the devilry scene of Der Freischutz.] The Oath. “An oath! an oath! I have an oath in heaven!” “Blood on this hand!”—aye, not the generous stream Which shed, or spent, alike we glorious deem! “Blood on this hand!”—aye, that ensanguined stain Which damn'd to endless pangs the first-born Cain! Thou talk of valour! thou of honour's path! Kicked into courage, cudgell'd by —! Thou talk of oaths, to thee an idle song, Thou “everything by turns, and nothing long!” Thou scorn of those that use thee for their ends! Thou tool of those thou darest not call “thy friends!” Thou, who canst calmly brook, and pass it by, The sneer scarce hid, the half-averted eye! Thou talk of honour! Shame to man, to earth, Shame to that generous land that gave thee birth! Hence! in some desert hide that hateful name, The good abhor thee, and the bad disclaim! The Distrest Laddie, A New Song to an Old Tune, as lately Sung at St. Stephen's Chapel by the Right Hon. Lord Althorp, Primo Buffo, etc., etc., in the New Farce of “The Budget.” Oh! where, and Oh! where is my tax on transfers gone? Oh! where, etc. 'Tis gone to pot at once, for the monied people frown, And it's Oh! in my heart, they won't give me half-a-crown. Suppose, and suppose that I lay it on the land! Suppose, and suppose, etc. There's Knatchbull swears that if I do, my Ministry shan't stand, And it's Oh! in my heart, I can't lay it on the land! Oh! where, and Oh! where is my tax on sea-borne coals? Oh! where, etc. The City people like it, but—will they take off their tolls?(Chorus of Citizens.)“It's Oh! in our hearts, if we do, then bless our souls!” Suppose, and suppose I take off the tax on glass! Suppose, etc. Hunt says 'twill do some little good, but Hume says I'm an ass, And it's Oh! in my heart, it's just like that Scotchman's saace! Suppose, and suppose that I lay it on again! Suppose, etc. Why, then my grand professions will have all been made in vain! And it's Oh! in my heart, how it puzzles my poor brain! The Hat; OR, THE MARCH OF INTELLECT. In Anna's days the Moral Wight Might say, “Whatever is, is right;” In these our times the Poet's song Must be, “Whatever is, is wrong.” Old, Young, Grave, Gay, throughout the nation The cry is still for alteration: Change all our aim, and only jealous To prove ourselves much wiser fellows Than all who yet have gone before us, “Change!” is the universal chorus. There's a tradition—shall I tell't?— That Sam, who first invented felt, And form'd that glorious thing, a Hat, Wove all the brim on't hanging flat, And this at once secured his claim To his soul's dearest wish, a Name: He died, and left his Hat so rare, All round and flapp'd, to John his heir. Now, John, a man both nice and wise, Thought the brim dangling in his eyes Plagued him, and baulked both bite and sup, So with a pin cock'd one side up; The neighbouring gossips stand and chat, “What an improvement in the Hat!” John died, and left his Hat so rare Thus cockt up to Fitz-John his heir. Fitz, though he view'd it with delight, Thought there was something not quite right, And in a trice, sagacious he, Instead of one side, cocks up three; His genius all with rapture own “Such talent ne'er before was known! Fitz-John shall be renown'd in story, A shining light—his Country's Glory!” He went abroad, and gave his Hat, Three-corner'd, to his cousin Pat. Patrick admires his new chapeau, Yet thinks it not quite comme il faut; “The colour's bad—now for some knack To change it. Zounds! I'll dye it black!” “Oh, happy thought!” the people roar, Who all saw farther than before; “White hats? Pooh! nonsense! look at that, Black—black's the colour for a Hat!” Pat left, upon his dying bed, His black Hat to his nephew Ned. Edward exclaims, “Smart, I declare, A little, though, the worse for wear. Here in the crown 'tis brown and tann'd; I shall clap on a silken band.” No sooner seen, the applauding crew Shout with delight, “The Hat's grown new! What mortal underneath the sun Can do more than this sage has done?” Ned died, and left his Hat thus neater Unto his cousin-german Peter. Peter was pleased, but in the place Of silk put on a broad gold lace; A cockade on one side he bore, And on one side the Hat he wore. The people see, with joy they shout, “'Tis wisdom's highest pitch, no doubt. Him genius fires, and judgment rules; Compared to him the wise are fools.” Peter bequeathed his Hat, when sick, Belaced, cockaded, unto Dick. Spare we to tell how Dick, the dandy, At Operas thought it mighty handy To squeeze the unlucky Hat together, How George tried loop, and William feather Suffice it, that with all this rout, The Hat in time was quite worn out; And when, bedockt and clipped, at last The Hat had all these changes past, 'Twixt nephews, uncles, aunts, and nieces, The poor old Hat got torn in pieces; While, to the love of change still wedded, Its last possessor went bare-headed! The fable has a moral, and, no doubt, You all have nous enough to find it out. The Old Woman's Cat. The old woman sat in her rush-bottom'd chair, And she snorted and sniff'd with her nose in the air; “Dear me! dear me! What's this?” quoth she; “Here's a very bad smell; why, what can it be? I'll wager a hat It's that horrid Tom cat Has been on the rug, or the carpet, or mat; All this has been From his being shut in. Betty, go run for Carpenter Gore, Make him cut a great hole by the sill of the door, And the cat will get out and annoy us no more.” Straight at the little old woman's command Came Carpenter Gore with his saw in his hand, And he saw'd and he chisel'd, and close by the floor He cut a great hole by the sill of the door; And the little old woman began for to snore, For now, without doubt, As the cat could get out, She conceived he would “never do so any more.” But when she awoke She was ready to choke; Oh dear! how she wheez'd And snuff'd and sneez'd, For the smell was a hundred times worse than before. The old woman bann'd and the old woman swore, And she vented her spite upon Carpenter Gore. But Carpenter Gore cared little for that, He put up his saw, and he put on his hat, And to Betty he said with a grin: “A hole, no doubt, That let's one cat out Will let half a score cats in!!” MORAL. Little old women, wherever ye be, Gentle or simple, come listen to me— Beware how you storm And bawl for Reform, And great alterations begin, Lest in going about, To rout one grievance out, You let half a score come in. Lord Waithman's Lament. —“Omnium Versatum urna!”— Horace. 'Tis sweet to remember The years that are past, If the sun of to-day Shine as bright as the last; But if black clouds envelope And darken our doom, That the day once was brighter But adds to the gloom! Lord Waithman sits lonely, His back-shop within, With his knees to his elbows, His thumbs to his chin; For, ah! fickle Fortune Kicks over “his Urn,” And he “grieves for the days Which will never return.” (Lord W. loquitur.) “And was it for this That I headed the mob, Riding proud in the van At Queen Cary's ‘black Job?’ That aloft on the foot-way My steed I bestrode, When the heavy dragoons Shov'd me out of the road? “And was it for this That Lord Kenyon I brav'd? And in full Common Council So ranted and raved? That now, when at length My reward I would draw, And I ask for their voices, Their answer is ‘Shaw!’ “Oh! shame to thee, Oldham! Oh! shame to thee, Slade! Oh! shame to thee, Thorpe! Ye the cause have betray'd: But on thee, faithless Joseph, Be tenfold the shame!— Sure Falsehood's a Scotchman, And Hume is his name! “To lose such a prize Would drive any man mad; Such a snug seat for life!

(The Filial Consoler.) “Six pen'orth of purl! “Come, drink, daddy, drink, Don't sit looking so bilious; Nor excite our alarms For our Paterfamilias, Take a sup while it's hot!

He said some disaster Would happen, he knew, When our Tortoise-shell Tom Behaved ill in my shoe. “He said 'twas a sign— But, ah me! wretched sinner! What to do!—where to go?— Who'll now give me a dinner? Oh! z—ds, I'll go mad! I will! here's to begin— Look here, Mister Bill, Will this do for a grin? (His voice rises an octave.) “I'll vote for a ballot, With nought but black balls! I'll swallow Guildhall, And the Bank—and St. Paul's! I'll join Dan O'Connell! I'll shoot Robert Peel! I'll feed the Lord Mayor For a month on cow-heel! “I'll murder Will Cobbett,— Set fire to the town; I'll smother that Shaw In his Chamberlain's gown! Such deeds I will do! —What they are I don't know— Oh!—I'm off in hysterics!— Oh dear!—Oh!—oh!!—oh!!!”(Miss W. sings within.) “Come, arouse thee! arouse thee! My jolly old boy! Take a swig, and to Guildhall away! Relax thatfrown, Put on your gown, With the fur and the gold chain so gay. “Are not you?—are not you? Oh! a silly old boy; To lie sprawling and kicking this way? When you know Lord Key Sports a luncheon at three, And Flower will for nobody stay! Then arouse thee, etc. “Then at night—then at night— What a merry old boy You'll be in the ball-room so gay— You and Ma must ride In the coach, side by side, And I, Jack, and Bill, in the Shay! Then arouse thee!” etc. (His Lordship looks at his watch—only ten minutes to three—Music plays an agitato movement.—His Lordship is supported to his carriage by two sympathizing shopmen in tears.—Little boy whistles “Go to the Devil and Shake Yourself,” as the carriage drives off.) A New Song to an Old Tune. BEING A FULL, TRUE, AND PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF A CERTAIN “TIGHT LITTLE ADMINISTRATION” THAT WAS LOST IN A FOG OFF THE COAST OF BRIGHTON, ON FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1834, AND HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD OF SINCE. Air—“The tight little Island.” Dandy Melborne one day Said to sage Gaffer Grey, “We must now hold a grand consul-tation; Since Spencer's ‘gone dead,’ We shall want a new head To conduct the affairs of the nation; For now he's got this elevation, Althorp can't keep his old situ-ation, And where's the three-decker Can take the Exchequer, In our tight little Adminis-tration? “As for Durham, you know, He's been down to Glasgow, And made an infernal o-ration, Calling all or us ‘fools,’ And ‘rogues’ and ‘Brougham's tools’ (To that Peer's no small morti-fication); And since that great Illumin-ation Of the Law, meets such vituper-ation From your son-in-law; he As your Lordship must see, Can't be one of our Adminis-tration. Edward Littleton, too, Would, I fear, never do, Though we might, as to mere calcu-lation, Send for Bowring from France, To teach him finance, And subtraction, and multipli-cation; But you know what a sad pertur-bation He occasioned our Associ-ation By that business with Dan, Which demolished the man As a part of our Adminis-tration. “There's that Scotch Abercromby May, it's fancied by some, be Possess'd of a qualifi-cation; His return, to be sure, Is pretty secure, And that's no small consider-ation; For since in her old corpor-ation We've produced such transmogrifi-cation, With his tongue in his cheek, he May blarney Auld Reekie, And humbug her whole popu-lation. “But then, there's Ned Ellice, You know, would be jealous, That rose-bud of civili-zation; Though the Tories defame him And grossly nick-name him, Which causes him great tribu-lation— Yet why should it give him vex-ation! Ursa Major's a prime constel-lation, And who dares declare Him the only ‘Great Bear’ To be found in our Adminis-tration? “As to little John Russell, Who's in such a bustle To put us to farther ‘pur-gation,’ With his ‘Ballot’ and nonsense, We cannot, in conscience, Consent to such gross inno-vation. We must all view with great constern-ation, A seat of but three years' dur-ation; The King and the Church We can leave in the lurch, But we can't leave our Adminis-tration. “Stay! by Jingo, I've caught What you'll own's a bright thought, Unless I've lost all pene-tration— I'll be off in a trice, And take with me Spring Rice, To propose for the King's appro-bation! When once I've made this presen-tation, There's an end to our whole bother-ation; And no longer sticks In this ‘tarnation fix’ Our rickety Adminis-tration.” Jumping into a chaise ('Twas an old hack of Grey's), Melly dropped here this grave conver-sation, And bade the postillion Drive towards “the Pavilion” Without further procrasti-nation: But conceive our poor friend's desper-ation, When, in answer to this appli-cation, Turning coolly about, Said the Sov'reign “You're out! And I'll form a new Adminis-tration!” Alas! and alack! When his Lordship got back, Only fancy the cold perspir-ation The Whigs were all in, When they heard where he'd been, And his journey's abrupt termi-nation. Holland House, at the first intim-ation, Became one scene of sad lamen-tation! A succession of fits Turn'd poor Palmerston's wits, And produced mental halluci-nation. Then in Great Stanhope-street The confusion was great In a certain superb habi-tation, Where, seated at tea, O'er a dish of Bohea, Brougham was quaffing his “usual po-tation.” (For you know his indignant ne-gation, When accused once of jollific-ation)— Down went saucer and cup, Which Le Marchant picked up, Not to hear his Lord mutter “d—n-ation!” But this greatest of men Soon caught hold of a pen, And, after slight delibe-ration, No longer he tosses His flexile proboscis About, in so much exci-tation; But, scribbling with great ani-mation, He sends off a communi-cation: “Dearest Lyndhurst,” says he, “Can't you find room for me When constructing your Adminis-tration? “Though the ‘Times’ says I'm mad, And each rascally Rad Abuses my tergiver-sation— Though those humbugs, the Whigs, Swear that my ‘Thimble-rigs’ Were the cause of all their vacill-ation; The whole story's a base fabri-cation To damage my great reputa-tion; So now, to be brief, Only make me Lord Chief, And I'll serve without remuner-ation!” When he found 'twas “no go,” And that Lyndhurst and Co. Were deaf to all solicit-ation, As 'twas useless with Lyndy To kick up a shindy, He resolved upon peregrin-ation; Not waiting for much prepa-ration, He bolted with precipi-tation A sad loss I ween, To Charles Knight's Magazine, And to Stinkomalee edu-cation! So now that the Noodles, The Doodles, and Foodles Of the Radico-Whig combination Are off, and the Realm Has sound men at the helm, Let us give them full co-operation! Superior to intimi-dation, May they free us from mere mob-dictation. Till her Altar and Throne Grateful England shall own, Preserv'd by Peel's Adminis-tration! The Irish Fisherman. I sat by the side of a murmuring brook, As sad as sad mote be; In my hand were a rod and a line and a hook, And a newspaper on my knee. Of Carlow the sad and sorrowful tale I conn'd with curious eye, When a sunlight beam displayed in the stream A speckled trout sailing by. But I laid down the rod, and I said to the fish, How all the world would grin, If in trying, small trout, to pull you out, You should happen to pull me in!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OCCASIONAL PIECES. Ode. In the autumn of 1824, Captain Medwin having hinted that certain beautiful lines on the burial of Sir John Moore might have been the production of Lord Byron's Muse, Mr. Sydney Taylor, somewhat indignantly claimed them for their rightful owner, the late Rev. Charles Wolfe. During the controversy a third claimant started up in the person of a soi-disant “Dr. Marshall,” who turned out to be a Durham blacksmith, and his pretensions a hoax. It was then that a certain “Dr. Peppercorn” put forth his pretensions to what he averred was the only “true and original” version, viz. :— Not a sous had he got—not a guinea or note; Hos ego versiculos feci, tulit alter honores.—Virgil. I wrote the lines, Smith owned them—he told stories. Thomas Ingoldsby. And he look'd confoundedly flurried, As he bolted away without paying his shot, And the landlady after him hurried. We saw him again at dead of night, When home from the club returning; We twigg'd the Doctor beneath the light Of the gas-lamps, brilliantly burning. All bare and expos'd to the midnight dews, Reclined in the gutter we found him; And he look'd like a gentleman taking a snooze, With his Marshall cloak around him. “The Doctor's as drunk as the D—” we said, And we managed a shutter to borrow; We rais'd him, and sigh'd at the thought that his head Would consumedly ache on the morrow. We bore him home and we put him to bed, And we told his wife and his daughter To give him next morning a couple of red- Herrings with soda water. Loudly they talk'd of his money that's gone, And his Lady began to upbraid him; But little he reck'd, so they let him snore on, 'Neath the counterpane just as we laid him. We tuck'd him in, and had hardly done, When beneath the window calling, We heard the rough voice of a son of a gun Of a watchman “one o'clock” bawling. Slowly and sadly we all walked down From his room in the uppermost story; A rushlight we placed on the cold hearth-stone, And we left him alone in his glory. The House that Jack Built. A NEW SONG TO AN OLD TUNE. As performed with great applause at Westminster Hall, on two successive days, viz., May 16th and 17th, 1826. This is the House that Jack The familiar sponsorial abbreviative of John Bull. built. This is a sleeper Neither the Board of Commissioners, the superintendents, or the operatives are here intended. Sleeper is a technical term, implying a particular piece of timber used in the foundations of buildings. that propped up the House that Jack built. This is the pile that was short all the while, and wouldn't go deeper under the sleeper, that propped up the House that Jack built. This is the Peto appointed to see to, the driving the pile that was short all the while, and wouldn't go deeper under the sleeper, that propped up the House that Jack built. These are the spandrels stout and thick, that were filled up with rubbish instead of brick, by Mr. Peto appointed to see to, the driving the pile that was short all the while, and wouldn't go deeper under the sleeper, that propped up the House that Jack built. This is Laing the Survey'r, who took such care, to order the spandrels stout and thick, to be filled up with rubbish instead of brick, by Mr. Peto appointed to see to, the driving the pile that was short all the while, and wouldn't go deeper under the sleeper, that propped up the House that Jack built. This is James Day from Drury Lane, who went there ev'ry morning and back again, to Laing the survey'r, who took such care, to order the spandrels stout and thick, to be filled up with rubbish instead of brick, by Mr. Peto, appointed to see to, the driving the pile that was short all the while, and wouldn't go deeper under the sleeper, that propped up the House that Jack built. This is Mullins the foreman steady and strong, who saw that matters were all going wrong, and wondered the house should have lasted so long, as he told James Day from Drury Lane, who went there every morning and back again, to Laing the survey'r, who took such care, to order the spandrels stout and thick, to be filled up with rubbish instead of brick, by Mr. Peto, appointed to see to, the driving the pile that was short all the while, and would not go deeper under the sleeper, that propped up the House that Jack built. This is John Cook, who “just gave a look,” and agreed with the foreman steady and strong, who saw that matters were all going wrong, and wondered the house should have lasted so long, as he told James Day from Drury Lane, who went there every morning and back again, to Laing the survey'r, who took such care, to order the spandrels stout and thick, to be filled up with rubbish instead of brick, by Mr. Peto, appointed to see to, the driving the pile that was short all the while, and would not go deeper under the sleeper, that propped up the House that Jack built. This is R. Smirke who found fault with the work, at which John Cook had just taken a look, and agreed with the foreman steady and strong, who saw that matters were all going wrong, and wondered the house should have lasted so long, as he told James Day from Drury Lane who went there every morning and back again, to Laing the survey'r, who took such care, to order the spandrels stout and thick to be filled with rubbish instead of brick, by Mr. Peto appointed to see to, the driving the pile which was short all the while, and wouldn't go deeper under the sleeper, that propped up the House that Jack built. This is George Rennie, who wouldn't give a penny, for all the work found fault with by Smirke, at which John Cook had just given a look, and agreed with the foreman steady and strong, who saw that matters were all going wrong, and wondered the house should have lasted so long, as he told James Day from Drury Lane, who went there every morning and back again, to Laing the survey'r, who took such care, to order the spandrels stout and thick to be filled with rubbish instead of brick, by Mr. Peto appointed to see to, the driving the pile that was short all the while, and wouldn't go deeper under the sleeper, that propped up the House that Jack built. These are the Counsellors bouncing and big, every one in a three-tailed wig, who examined George Rennie that wouldn't give a penny, for all the work found fault with by Smirke, at which John Cook had just taken a look, and agreed with the foreman steady and strong, who saw that matters were all going wrong, and wondered the house should have lasted so long, as he told James Day from Drury Lane, who went there every morning and back again, to Laing the survey'r, who took such care, to order the spandrels stout and thick, to be filled with rubbish instead of brick, by Mr. Peto appointed to see to, the driving the pile that was short all the while, and wouldn't go deeper under the sleeper, that propped up the House that Jack built. This is John Bull with his pockets so full, who “forked out” three hundred thousand pound for a tumble-down house that fell to the ground, and paid all the fees, with a great deal of ease, to all the grave counsellors bouncing and big, every one in a three-tailed wig, who examined George Rennie that wouldn't give a penny, for all the work found fault with by Smirke, at which John Cook had just given a look, and agreed with the foreman steady and strong, who saw that matters were all going wrong, and wondered the house should have lasted so long, as he told James Day from Drury Lane, who went there every morning and back again, to Laing the survey'r, who took so much care, to order the spandrels stout and thick to be filled with rubbish instead of brick, by Mr. Peto appointed to see to, the driving the pile that was short all the while, and wouldn't go deeper under the sleeper, that propped up the House that Jack built. This is Westminster Hall so lofty and tall, where lawyers and architects, foremen and all, sing huzza for John Bull with his pockets so full, who forked out three hundred thousand pound for a tumble-down house that fell to the ground, and paid all the fees, with a great deal of ease, to all the grave counsellors bouncing and big, every one in a three-tailed wig, who examined George Rennie, that wouldn't give a penny, for all the work found fault with by Smirke, at which John Cook had just given a look, and agreed with the foreman steady and strong, who saw that matters were all going wrong, and wondered the house should have lasted so long, as he told James Day from Drury Lane, who went there every morning and back again, to Laing the survey'r, who took such care, to order the spandrels stout and thick, to be filled up with rubbish instead of brick, by Mr. Peto appointed to see to, the driving the pile, that was short all the while, and wouldn't go deeper nor prop up the sleeper, that let fall the House that Jack built. The Dark-looking Man. Hic niger est, hunc tu Romane caveto! The man's dark-looking, him with caution see to! The cloth was withdrawn, the decanters at hand, At the “Somerset,” close by St. Mary-le-Strand, When 'tis painful to think what a discord began 'Twixt a Merchant so brave and a Dark-looking Man. The cause of this uproar, and whence it arose, Oh! nobody mentions, and nobody knows; But the waiters were scared, and away they all ran, And “Bring pistols for two!” cried the Dark-looking Man. Civil Tom was alarmed; his civility fled, Every hair of his wig stood on end on his head; John, William, the Barmaid, Jane, Susan, and Nan, All fled from the wrath of the Dark-looking Man. The guests rose en masse, and abandened the bowl, And in came the beadle, the watch, and patrol; While Morris and Blackman cried, “Seize him who can! In the King's name, lay hands on that Dark-looking Man!” E'en Hercules' self, though the strongest of gods, Must yield (as the bard sings too truly) to odds; Alas! 'tis in vain to contend with a clan, So they bore off to Bow Street that Dark-looking Man. “Oh, come ye in peace here, or come ye in war?” The Justice exclaimed, as he eyed them afar; But the Merchant declared he knew nought of the plan, “I am quite in the dark,” cried that Dark-looking Man. The gaoler looked grim, and the clerk he looked grave, As the Magistrate turned to that Merchant so brave: “I care not,” quoth he, “how this quarrel began, But I beg you'll shake hands with that Dark-looking Man. “Fight duels! Pooh! nonsense! Come, don't be absurd, Had I let you alone, think what might have occurred; You might have been shot, and brought home in a van, While Jack Ketch had finish'd that Dark-looking Man.” “Shake hands!” cried the Merchant, and look'd with disdain O'er his camlet-cloak collar, adorn'd with gilt chain, “Shake hands with a stranger? 'Tis never my plan.” “I'll be hang'd if I do!” said that Dark-looking Man. “You won't?” cried his Worship; “then bear them to gaol, Lock them up till they find satisfactory bail.” Thus ended the feud with a flash in the pan Of that Merchant so brave and that Dark-looking Man. MORAL. Merchants, East and West India, now list to me, pray, Attend to the moral I draw from my lay: Shun strife, nor let port e'er your senses trepan, Above all, don't fall out with a Dark-looking Man. H. Peppercorn, M.D. Mother Goose's Tale; OR, NURSERY RHYMES FOR CHRISTMAS, 1828. I sing a song of “sixpence,” a balance all awry, My “friend and benefactor” a piping of his eye! When his mouth was opened the clerk began to sing, “Is not this a pretty dish? suppose we both take wing! “The folks are in the counting-house, counting out the money, Five bankers in the parlour are looking rather funny!” The clerk then in the carpet-bag was packing up his clothes, “Send out and call a ‘Jarvey,’ ere somebody ‘turn nose!’ “Bee! ba! black sheep, have you any ‘cole?’” “Not a single sixpence!” (aside) “three bags full!” Goosey Goosey Gander! Then I must wander Up stairs, down stairs, To my lady's chamber! John Cook he went to his little grey mare, For cash was the cry, and his purse was bare. Little Jack Horner popt out of the corner, Where he had been sitting so sly; He had put in his thumb for a slice of the ‘plum,’ And now come to wish them ‘Good-bye.’ Now ride a cock horse Adown Charing Cross, In a dark green chariot and a grey horse! There was an old woman got up at the turnpike, To open the gate, a mile out of town; Where we were going to she did not ask it— Into her hand I slipp'd a half-crown; “Old woman, old woman, hip,” said I, “Can't you contrive a small bit of a lie, To tell them we're off to the Isle of Sky? For they'll be after us by and by.” There was a man in London town, And he was wondrous wise, And he went with us in the chaise, And kept out both his eyes; And when he saw that all was safe, With all his might and main, He got into another chaise, And so went back again. I had a little pilot boat no bigger than my thumb, There is a little place call'd Pill, and there I bid it come. Rowland and Jemmy were two pretty men, They lay in bed till the clock struck ten. Up jumps Rowland, and looks at the boat, “Come, brother Jemmy, 'tis time we're afloat!” “You go before with the bottle and bag, And I'll come after, and carry the ‘swag!’” There was a hair trunk—oh, what do you think, We fill'd it with nothing but victuals and drink: When we'd victuals and drink, we set off with our diet, Lest the silly old landlady should not keep quiet. Sing a song, It's very wrong Exchequer Bills to borrow; If we can catch the little dog, He shall be whipt to-morrow. Rowland loved good ale and wine, And Rowland loved good brandy, And Rowland loved a pretty girl As sweet as sugar-candy. Heigh, my Bishop, my Bishop, And heigh, my Bishop so leary! Ellis, and Ruthven, and Cope, They hunt for them far and neary! Now they go up, up, up, Now they go round, round, round, Now they go backwards and forwards, And now they go down, down, down. Old Tommy Townshend Thus began his prayers, “Take him by his right leg, Take him by his left leg, Take him by his right leg, D?me, take him by his ears!” Heigh, diddle, diddle, Sir George and his fiddle, They watch'd at his door till noon: Cunning Tom laugh'd to see them all wrong, And voted Sir Richard a ‘spoon.’ Little Bo-peep Is gone on the deep, And they can't tell where to find him; Let him alone, For he'll never come home, Nor leave any cash behind him. GRAND CHORUS OF MARINERS. See saw, saw the waves, Saw the waves asunder; A great knave a-top of the deck, And a little knave under. Jan. 14th, 1829. Margery Daw. Childe Nugent. A Fragment. Childe Nugent stands by the dead man's grave, With a picke axe and a spade, For he longs to view a patriot true, And to find out of what he is made. He hath been easte and he hath been weste— He hath roam'd farre and wide— He hath traversed the lande of fayre Englande, And Portingale eke besyde. He hath been northe and he hath been southe, A patriot for to fynde, Bote never yet mote Childe Nugent get A patriot to hys mynde. Soe now he stands by the dead man's grave, With hys spade and hys picke axe; Was never a resurrection man Dyd give more lustie thwacks. Childe Nugent delved with ryght gode wille, And dygg'd with might and maine; Was never a Byschope and never a Burke Colde sooner a styffe one gayne. He hath dygg'd easte, he hath dygg'd weste, He hath dygg'd both northe and southe, And he cometh at last to the dead man's skull, With hys thigh bones cross'd in hys mouthe! Childe Nugent hath read a Runic rhyme, In a voice both loud and dread; I wis a tale of Portingale, That well mote awaken the dead. “Now awake and arise, John Hampden; Awake and arise, I praye! Though I stand here a living man, And thou art a lump of clay. “Awake and say, John Hampden, How I may a patriot be; For never I ween was a patriot seen, An' thou, John, wer't not he!” The dead man open'd hys chapless jaws, And groan'd three eldritch groans, As from out of hys mouthe, to the northe and the southe, He spat out hys own thigh bones. With fear and amaze did Childe Nugent gaze; Ne wonder that he dydde; For never, I ween, did mortal eyne, Spie such an unearthly quidde! The dead man grinn'd a ghastly grin, And he laughed loud laughters three; “Now lithe and listen, thou venturesome wight, That wouldest a patriot be.” Virgo Infelix. Hic jacet in terris Pulchra puella; Voluit esse melior Cum fuit wella. Quæ causa mortis, Infelix virgo? Aqua fortis Urens a tergo! Quantum quantitate? Nescio sanè; Attamen vixero Si non any. Quis administravit? Sanctus Johannes. Quibus recommendatus? Pluribus Zanies. Quis fuit ille Johannes præfatus? O'Driscoll Billy Olim nuncupatus. Medicus?—Nequaquam, Sed pictor signorum, In Tipperariâ, Inops bonorum. Nunc dives auri Sedet sublimis In curru, celebratus Prosâ atque rhymis Quæ tantæ famæ Fuit origo? Sanatio mira Marchionis de Sligo. Num particeps alter Dementiæ vestræ? Imo sane fuit Dominus Ingestriæ. Ah! virgo infelix, Tui quam miseresco, Sine sheetis blanketsve Dormientis al fresco! A curis soluta Hic intus jace, In Longum a Longo Requiescas in pace! Encomium Longanum. You may talk of your Celsus, Machaons, and Galens, Physicians who cured all incurable ailings, But ne'er yet was doctor applauded in song Like that erudite phœnix, the great Doctor Long. Such astonishing cures he performs I assure ye, Some think him a god—all a Lusus Naturæ, The whole animal system, no matter how wrong, Is set right in a moment by great Doctor Long. Through all regions his vast reputation has flown, Through the torrid, the frigid, and temperate zone; The wretch, just expiring, springs healthy and strong From his bed at one touch of the great Doctor Long. His skill to experience, what potentates ran— The Pope, the Grand Llama, the King of Japan! The Great Chinese autocrat, mighty Fon Whong, Was cured of the ‘doldrums’ by fam'd Doctor Long! In each serious case he considers as well as Doctor Horace, “Naturam cum furcâ expellas,” “Dame Nature” (i.e.) “you must poke with a prong,” Pretty poking she gets from the great Doctor Long. He cures folks à merveille, the French people cry; The Greeks all pronounce him ????????? ??. Dutch and Germans adore him—the Irish among, “To be sure he's the dandy!” Go bragh, Qu. Brag.—Printer's Devil.Doctor Long! King Chabert has proved, since restored from his panic, There's small harm in quaffing pure hydrocyanic; But he never found out it was good for the throng, When scrubb'd on their stomachs by great Doctor Long. A machine he's invented, stupendous as new, To sweep one's inside as you'd sweep out a flue; No climbing-boy, urged by the sound of the thong, Can brush out your vitals like great Doctor Long. Her Grace feeling qualmish one morning of late, After breaking poor Jeffries' the box-keeper's pate; A bumper of Nantz, in a cup of souchong, Was prescribed as a tonic by great Doctor Long. Garter King Sir George Nayler, Knt., Garter King-at-Arms, etc., a signal example of the fallacious foundation of the proverb, which saith, “Grocers do not like plums.” We counted yesterday, on his armorial majesty's carriage and harness, eight-and-twenty coronets, two-and-twenty garters, and eighteen crests, besides full coats of arms, mantles, etc., as the story-book says, “all very grand.” has assign'd, like a sad “fleering Jack,” A duck for a crest, with the motto, “Quack, quack;” To the proud name of St. John (it should be St. Johng, Which would rhyme with the surname of great Doctor Long). Great house-painting, sign-painting, face-painting Sage! Thou Raffaelle of physic, thou pride of our age! Alas! when thou diest, and the bell goes ding-dong, Sure Hygeia herself will expire with her Long. Then fill every glass, drink in grand coalition, “Long life long await this long-headed physician, Long, long may Fame sound with her trumpet and gong Through each nation the name of the great Doctor Long!” Relics of Antient Poetry. No. I. [When goode Kynge Wyllyam ruled this lande] The following curious old ballad is said to have been lately discovered by that erudite antiquary, Mr. John Britton, who assigns it to the twelfth century. As it is not to be found in the collections of either Percy, Ellis, or Ritson, we willingly give it a place:— When goode Kynge Wyllyam From my researches in a scarce tract, entitled Hume's History of England, I conclude the monarch here alluded to is the celebrated William of Normandy, sometimes called William the Conqueror, who came over in the famous Spanish Armada, and killed Queen Elizabeth at the battle of Agincourt. His uncle, William the Second, who succeeded him, and was surnamed Roofus, from the beautiful ceiling he put up in Westminster Hall (see the Ramsbottom papers in the possession of Theodore, King of Corsica), was never married. William the Conqueror married the daughter of Caleb Baldwin, Earl of Flanders, the “gracyous Queene” here alluded to. J. B.ruled this lande, And was a worthie Kynge; The Queene he one daye dyd commande To attende a fayre Christ'nynge. The Knights dyd ride, the folke dyd runne, And make a mightie dinne; Then who so ready as Lorde Holdernesse, Mr. Harris Nicolas, in his‘Synopsis of the Peerage,’ assigns 1621 as the date of the first creation of this title. It became extinct in the person of Humphry Clinker, 15th Lord, killed by the savages in the island of Owhyhee, A.D. 1540. J.B. To let Kynge Wyllyam inne. The Kynge and Queene they both stand forth, With Lordes and Ladyes tenne; The Byschoppe Probably Thomas A'Becket, or Cardinal Wolsey, who both flourished in this King's reign; the former was afterwards Archbishop of York, and suffered death for stealing the crown out of the Record Office in the Tower of London. J.B. is there with hys great bygge wygge, The Clerke he sayeth Amenne. Now “Largesse! Largesse!” quoth the Nurse, And she spake on bended knee; “Now Largesse! Largesse! our gracyous Queene, I pray thy Majestie!” “Largesse! Largesse!” then cryed they alle, And they kneelid on the grounde; “Grammercy!” quoth our gracyous Queene, “For thy mede here is Fiftie Pounde!” Right gladde, I ween, that nurse is seene, And she laughed loud laughters three; “Now God prosper longge our Noble Kynge, And eke his gaye Ladye!” Then out and spake a Lady fayre, The Mither, The “Mither,” here mentioned, was, in all probability, the celebrated Anne Boleyn, wife of John Wilkes, fourth Earl of Holdernesse. The fate of this beautiful but unfortunate woman, who was hanged at Tyburn, in 1745, by order of the inhuman Jeffries, for aiding in the escape of King Charles the First after the Battle of Blenheim, is matter of history. For a minute account of her execution, see Augustine ‘De Civitate Dei,’ and the ‘New Bath Guide.’ J.B. I trow, was shee! “Now naye, now naye, thou olde fatte Nurse, In sooth thys may not be. For there is Alice, and there is Joane, And Susanne and Pollie, all fowr, I can find no account of these “fowr maydens” in all my friend Mr. Cawthorne's most valuable circulating library. It is, however, not unlikely that the “Pollie” last mentioned was the daughter of Mr. Peachum, some time keeper of his Majesty's gaol of Newgate, and afterwards the wife of Macbeth, the notorious highwayman who robbed and murdered Banquo, Member for Corfe Castle, in the fourteenth century. There is, however, a trifling difficulty as regards dates. For her history, see Gray's tragedy of ‘The Beggar's Opera.’ J. B. Servynge women of lowe degree, Doe wayt within mye bower. Tenne pounds to Alice, and tenne to Joane, Be welle and trewly payde; To Susanne tenne, and to Pollie but fyve, For she is the Kytchen Mayde. And fyfteene pounds, thou olde fatte Nurse, May well thy guerdon bee.” “Now naye, now naye!” quoth that olde fatte Nurse, “In sooth that may not bee! “For fyftie pounds of the goode red golde, A truly Royal present, amounting to about three hundred and seventeen pounds, four shillings, and threepence halfpenny of our present money. I begged on my bended knee; I wyll have alle—our gracyous Queene Dyd frankly give it me!” “Now naye, now naye! thou fatte olde Nurse, In fayth it shall notte be donne; Our Lady forefend thou shouldest have alle, And mye other fowr Maydens nonne!” Then up and spake Lord Holdernesse, And a wrathful man was hee; “Thys olde fatte Nurse is a Female Dogge, And here she no more may be!” And he hath taken that olde fatte Nurse, And smakid her soundlie and welle; By the laws of chivalry, as contained in the Napoleon Code, it was a heavy offence for a knight to strike a female, and was usually punished, especially during the period of the crusade, by setting the criminal in the pillory. Sir Philip Sydney narrowly escaped this degradation at the siege of Acre. J.B. One smacke on her cheeke, one smacke on her eare And one smacke where I maye not telle. “Now out and alasse!” quoth that old fatte Nurse, “That ever I was borne! The Devyll flie awaye with Lord Holdernesse, And poke hym with his horne! An awful imprecation, not unsuited to the complexion and creed of the dark ages, which preceded the invention of gas-lights, when infernal agency was believed in by every one; the story of the devil's flying away with Doctor Foster is familiar to most, though there is some reason to doubt its authenticity. Romulus, king of Greece, and Matthew Hopkins, Archbishop of Paris, were said to have been similarly disposed of; also a tailor (name unknown), as is recorded in the old ballad of Chevy Chase:— “And the devil flew away with the little tailor, And the broad cloth under his arm.” J.B. “The Devyll flie away with Lord Holdernesse, Who colde smyte mee on the hyppe, And colde smacke the cheeke of a ladye, When he mote have kissed her lyppe! “The Devyll flie away with Lord Holdernesse, And all faytours fals and mene, Who wolde take fyftie pounde from a pore a pore old Nurse, And leave her bote fyfteene!” Part II. [It was a Butchere wyth hys traye] Another of those interesting remains of which we have already given a specimen, was read at the last meeting of the Antiquarian Society. The MS. in which it and about fifty more are contained is an illuminated one, but imperfect, wanting both title-page and colophon. It is said to have been discovered at Bristol, in the bookstall of Peter Hyson, Esq., A.S.S., who, through the kind intervention of our antiquarian friend, has furnished us with an illustrated copy. It was a Butchere wyth hys traye Walked forth to buy hys meete, And he mette wyth a queere lookynge calfe Of the period when calves were first introduced into this country we have no certain account. It must, however, have been previous to the age of Elizabeth, inasmuch as we find England in that reign already celebrated for its beef, then commonly partaken of at breakfast, its introduction to the dinner-table being the innovation of a later age. That eminent naturalist, Mr. P. Hyson, has proved to demonstration that veal must have been antecedent to beef, as the maturity of the one is necessarily preceded by the precocity of the other; indeed, veal may be defined as beef in an incipient state. According to an antient distich preserved by that erudite antiquary, Mr. Puffman, [Hofman] of Bishopsgate Street Within, “Hops, Reformation, Calves, and Beer, Came over to England all in one year.” If there be any truth in this tradition, the era must be that of King John, who was formally excommunicated by Pope Leo the Tenth (Ganganelli) for granting Catholic Emancipation, and refusing to kiss his toe. The dissolution of the monastic orders followed, and the Reformation was soon after brought about, principally through the preaching of the celebrated Martin Bree. This supposition is further countenanced by a passage in the old play of King John, by Barber Beaumont and Fletcher, in which the Lord Falconbridge, addressing the Archbishop of Austria, is made to say “And hang a calve's skin on those recreant limbs,” a recommendation which would seem to intimate that calve-skins were rare at that period, and worn only as an article of dress, on state occasions, by the principal nobility. Hangynge uppe by hys feete. “Now Heav'n thee save, thou Butchere's boye, I praye thee telle to mee, If ever in alle Ledenhalle Leden, or as it is now spelt, Leadenhall, was formerly a Dominican Convent for monks of the Order of St. Francis. It occupied the site on which the market now stands, having Gracious (now Grace-church) street to the west, and to the east a magnificent pile of building belonging to the Honourable East India Company, against whom these ambitious ecclesiastics maintained a long litigation in the Court of Chancery on the subject of tythes. Thou fayrer veale dydst see?” “And howe sholde I a Jack-Asse Jackasses are supposed to be indigenous in this country; it is at least certain that they were common in the time of Richard the Conqueror, and the breed has by no means degenerated. From the peculiar sagacity of this “fine animal,” its name is held in great veneration in the City of London, as the symbol of “absolute wisdom,” and has not only been frequently conferred as a title of honour upon aldermen, but has even been supposed to lend a lustre to the name of the chief magistrate himself. Mr. Kempe, in his valuable History of the New Post Office, mentions a rare print, representing a Lord Mayor in his robes of office with an ass's head on. It were superfluous to speak farther of the ass, in its emblematic capacity, before a society which has so deservedly affixed A.S.S. as a proud distinction to the names of its members. As an article of food, the flesh of the ass is now little in request, except at corporation dinners and other civic entertainments, and occasionally, in the form of sausages, in the more thickly inhabited parts of the metropolis. knowe, If thys be never a one?” “Poh! never heede hys ears and tayle, Bote take hym for a crowne!”— “Aldermanne, From this term of address it would seem that the salesman, or master butcher, here alluded to, was a person of distinction, or a member of a body corporate. Ealdermann, or Eorlderman, was a title of honour amongst the ancient Scandinavians or Scavengers, and is still used by their descendants, the Low Dutch, as the appropriate designation of an elderly lady. It was the custom formerly, for Eorldermen to ride upon white horses (see Tillotson and Jeffrey Monmouth passim). Their persons were held to be inviolable, and the form of an imprecation is still extant, made use of towards an offender who had inflicted an injury on one of their body— “Zoundes, Sir! you've cutte offe the Eorldermanne's thumbe!” This title must not be confounded with the modern “Alderman,” an office of great dignity and importance, usually filled by persons of respectability. hee is too farre gone—Aldermanne, hee is too farre gone; Vy, blesse your eyes, Hee aynt noe syze; Hee vont cutte uppe tenne stone!” “Chaff noe more, Butchere; Butchere, chaffe noe more; Thyne haggling is in vayne— For soche a bargayne, atte fyve bobbe, Bobbe, an antient coin, equal in value to one shilling of our money. It was styled a Bobbe, from Robert Bruce, last Sovereign Prince of South Wales, who was slain in battle by Edward the Third, and whose effigy and legend it bore. One of these scarce coins is now in my possession, the head much defaced, and the inscription altogether obliterated. Thou ne'er mayst see agayne! “Nay, stay thee, Butchere, thinke awhyle Before thou leav'st mye stalle, For Spryngge is comme, and veale doth ryse, Whyle other meetes do falle!” A curious illustration of the state of the gastronomic thermometer in days of yore. Its fluctuations seem to have been nearly the same in all ages. My learned friend, Mr. Michael Scaley, whose experience in these matters is too well-known to need farther comment, affirms, that, “Weal is allays dearest a'ter Chrissmus.” “Now tempte mee notte, thou Scalie manne— O tempte me notte, I praye; Here bee fowr hogge, The Boar, or “Hogge,” was the well-known cognisance of the House of Lancaster, and usually stamped on the coins of all the Princes of that dynasty. When William the Third, surnamed the Crook-back Tyrant, from causing Perkin Warbeck to be smothered in the Tower, fell at Bosworth Field, Joseph de Lancaster, the sole survivor of the family, fled to America, where it is believed he still resides, exercising, in imitation of another great living potentate, the humble occupation of a schoolmaster. Mr. Heseltine's assertion, that he became a bricklayer in St. Giles's parish (vide ‘Last of the Plantagenets’), and built a stack of chimneys at Eastwell Park, for the Earl of Winchelsea, is a pleasing fiction, but utterly at variance with facts as developed by the severity of historical research. The precise value of the Hogge I have no means of ascertaining. The Tyzzie is the same as the Tizzy, i. e., sixpence, and was current during the “wars of the Roses,” so called from a noble but turbulent family, which recently became extinct in the person of the late George Rose, Esq., M.P., for the borough of Christ Church, Hants. and ane tyzzie downe!”— “Welle, poppe hym inne thye traye!” Correspondence. [A quarrel between two gallant captains, originating in a charge of evading the subscription due to the Junior United Service Club, and terminating, after a long correspondence, in an appeal to Sir Richard Birnie at Bow Street, gave rise to the following pleasantry, which appeared July, 1830.] No. 1. Captain Hogshead's best compliments—begs Captain Squirt Will just drop him a line, and be pleased to insert, At what hour to-morrow or next day 'twill suit him, To let his young friend, Captain Pills, come and shoot him? No. 2. REPLY. Captain Squirt, Captain Hogshead's kind note has read o'er; He doesn't think proper to say any more. No. 3. Sir,—Your note's such a queer one, I really don't know If you mean to encounter my friend Pills or no, S. Hogshead. No. 4. If I don't hear by ten, I conclude it ‘No Go.’ S. H. No. 5. Sir,—Captain Mouth has just brought me your verbal despatch, I shall tell Captain Pills you won't come to the scratch, Although in the dark you've been joining to flout him, And all sorts of tarry-diddles telling about him. S. H. No. 6. Sir,—It having been settled this day in committee, That your friend, Captain Pills, has behav'd himself pretty; Captain Squirt now no longer to shoot him refuses, Wherever he likes and whenever he chooses. R. H. Mouth. To Captain Hogshead, &amp;c., &amp;c. No. 7. Sir,—I beg leave to put what I told you in writing, I must say I think it's all nonsense this fighting; Suppose they shake hands—think no longer of slaughter, But finish—I'll join—with hot brandy and water!S. H. To Captain Mouth, &amp;c., &amp;c. No. 8. Sir,—Either beg pardon at once for your malice, Or—zounds! sir—come over and fight me at Calais! Hotspur Pills. To Captain Squirt. No. 9. Sir,—My friend Captain Squirt, who's as bold as a lion, Says as how he conceives Captain Pills is a ‘shy un.’ A voyage in a steam-boat he don't choose to hazard, He has waited three days for a slap at his mazzard; So his character now he will hinge upon that, He will fight in England, and d—n me that's flat! R. H. M. To Captain H., &amp;c., &amp;c. No. 10. Sir,—You know we agreed when you gave me a call, That France was the best place for powder and ball, And if you've chang'd your mind—why, I hav'n't—that's all. S. H. To Captain Mouth, &amp;c., &amp;c. No. 11. Sir,—You know you told lies, and said everything bad, And you ought to be 'sham'd of yourself—so you had! And now that my mother has found it all out, And won't let me fight, why my courage you doubt, Come over, I tell you, or soon you'll have got What you won't like at all-but I shan't tell you what. Hotspur Pills. To Captain Squirt, R.N. No. 12. Calais. Sir,—I meant to have lick'd you, and bought a new whip, But the beak bound me over; I've giv'n 'em the slip, And here I'm now staying your carcase to drub, If you don't come, by Jove, I shall write to the club. H. P. To Captain S. No. 13. Sir,—It's devilish provoking your keeping one so, Captain Squirt should have come and been shot long ago; I beg we no longer attendance may dance, It's deuced expensive this stopping in France. S. H. To Captain Mouth, &amp;c., &amp;c. No. 14. Sir,—Captain Squirt I can never advise To fight anywhere else but at Battersea Rise; And more than that, it should never be his plan To take any more notice of any ‘sich’ man, Who would not fight When he very well might, But for full thirteen days kept clean out of sight. If you write any more I shall very much thank You to pay the post, or to put it in a frank. R. H. M. To Captain H., &amp;c., &amp;c. No. 15. Sir,—As to writing, 'tis grown such a bore, That I don't mean to trouble you never no more; But since Captain Pills is my crony, I feel That to call him “a man” is not very genteel. S. H. To Captain M., &amp;c., &amp;c. No. 16. Sir,—I don't mean to quarrel, indeed never do, But I hope I'm at least as genteel, sir, as you. R. H. M. To Captain H., &amp;c., &amp;c. No. 17. Dear Squirt,—As to Pills, whom I know well enough, I thought his palaver in Down Street all stuff, But what 'twas about it is so long ago I've forgot, but I think 'bout his brother poor Joe; No. 18. I don't recollect, I can't tell, I don't know. H. Downeycove. No. 19. DECLARATION. We think and agree That far better 'twould be For the parties to stand on the beach near the sea.

At the upper end of a long table a President's chair vacant, in front of which Mr. Martin, the Librarian, is occupied in placing a large cocked hat on a velvet cushion. The clock striketh eight—a short pause, which is at length broken by sundry fidgettings, hemm-ings, and other signs of impatience. Mr. Amyott, the Treasurer, riseth, and preludizeth. (Treas.) The clock has struck; 'tis waxing late! See, full three minutes after eight! I move then, since my Lord's not here, That Mister Gurney take the chair! (Cries of “Hear! hear!” “Chair!” “Mr. Gurney in the Chair,” etc. Hudson Gurney, Esq. ascendeth the vacant Throne, sitteth down, getteth up again, bloweth his nose, tum loquitur.) (Pres.) Now, Gentlemen, since time is precious, While they get ready, to refresh us, The tea, the buttered toast, and muffin, With other requisites for stuffing, That cheer our hearts, and fill our bellies, Let us to business!—Mr. Ellis! (The Junior Secretary riseth, bland, and rubicund, taketh out his spectacles, wipeth carefully, and placeth them on their proper supporter, cleareth his throat, boweth to the Chair, and proceedeth.) (Jun. Sec.) Sir—Gentlemen—ere we proceed Farther; permit me now to read My worthy colleague's minutes, treating Of what was said and done last meeting! (Mr. Senior Secretary Carlile handeth the minute book across, the Junior Sec. receiveth it with a gracious smile, openeth it, and readeth.) (Jun. Sec.) Presented—first, a Bow and Arrow, Supposed the same with which the Sparrow Cock Robin's bosom did transfix; (See Mother Goose, vol. I, page 6). Discovered underneath a hay-rick In Herefordshire—by Dr. Meyrick, (Hear! hear!) Much like another in the dwelling Of Dr. Meyrick's son, Llewellyn. Read—The accompanying essay, Some forty folios as I guess, a Brief statement, luminous, and clear, Of how 'twas found, and when, and where, With arguments of greatest nicety, In favour of its authenticity. (Mr. Caley riseth and walketh up and down, with his hands behind his back, to keep himself awake. Mr. Hallam offereth him snuff, which he declineth, and reseateth himself. The Junior Sec. goeth on.) (Jun. Sec.) Read—by the Secretary (me, Sir,) A paper touching Julius Cæsar, Tracing his progress all through Cantium To London, then called Trinovantium, Proving the Tower he founded in 't Was not that building near the Mint, Stained so by foul and midnight slaughter, But one on t'other side the water, Converted now, its source forgot, T' a Manufactory of Shot. (Mr. Caley falleth asleep.) Presented—by the Junior Sec., (Myself again) a Royal wreck, An antique Thimble, that, with which, In seventeen hundred forty-six, Flora Macdonald drove her stitches, While mending Prince Charles Edward's breeches, When, from Culloden forc'd to fly, He tore them in the Isle of Sky. (A portly Member, at the lower end of the table, riseth abruptly.) (Memb.) The Young Pretender wore a kilt, He had no breeches.— (Jun. Sec. aside and frowning) Hang that Gwilt— (aloud and smiling) Sir, pardon me, my paper shows That Prince Charles Edward wore the Trews Even before he passed the border, And tore the seat— (Mr. J. B. Nicholls) Chair! (Sir Ev. Home) Order! Order! (Jun. Sec.) Sir—really—may I never stir, If I— (Mr. Crofton Croker) I rise to order, Sir, The learned Secretary knows All precedent against him goes, He can't forget when Mr. Caley (Perhaps for him a thought too gaily,) Expended much deep erudition Upon a certain “deposition” Of witnesses i' the fifteenth century, Touching how Queen Anne Boleyn went awry, The reading, in that very case, he Opposed, himself, from delicacy. (Jun. Sec.) Sir, I assure you, not one particle— Pres. Proceed, Sir, to the following article. We'll not discuss that matter now! (Jun. Sec.) To your decision, Sir, I bow— These interruptions— (Mr. Caley snoreth.) —Mr. Brayley, Pray give a jog to Mr. Caley. Mr. B— shaketh the Keeper of the Augmentation Office by the shoulder; Mr. Crofton Croker singeth the end of a pen in the candle, and applieth it to his nose at the same time. Mr. Caley sneezeth, and openeth his eyes.) (Jun. Sec.) Elected—on certificate written By our prime Counsellor, John Britton, John Day, Esquire, of Great St. Mary Axe, a most learned Antiquary, Whose well-known name requires no gilder, Foreman to Mister Rennie, Builder, And sole constructor of the palings I' the Park, with sundry other railings In Essex, Sussex, and in Kent, And of a foot-bridge 'cross the Brent! —That's all, Sir, and, the minutes ended, A name, which has been now suspended The usual time, for ballot calls; Produce the— (Sen. Sec.) Here's the box and balls! (Chairman readeth aloud the name of the Candidate.) “Charles Hyson, Bookseller and 'Squire, Of High Street, Bristol, Somersetshire,” His Testimonials signed and written By our prime Counsellor, John Britton. (The ballot box is passed round by Mr. Martin. Mr. Crofton Croker waggishly secreteth seventeen black balls, and depositeth them slily within the cavity. The box is handed up to the President, who stretcheth forth his right hand towards the cocked hat, while he openeth the drawer with his left. A start—President withdraweth his right hand as if it had touched a red-hot poker; great consternation in his countenance on viewing sable intermixture in drawer. Much temporary confusion in the assembly. On counting balls the “joke” is discovered; President gravely rebuketh ill-timed pleasantry on the part of Member unknown—box passed round again; Candidate declared unanimously elected on A.S.S.—C. Hyson. Esq., led to the table by J. Britton, Fsq. [proposer and seconder]—President riseth, putteth on cocked hat, hind side before.) (Pres.) Sir, We, the President and Fellows Of this most grave Society, jealous Of our own fame and reputation, Have made due search and inquiration Into your merits, and discerning Your genius, deep research, and learning, Finding you qualified, no less Than we, to be A double S, We do admit you 'mongst our fellows, (That fire's out, Martin, fetch the bellows), Not doubting but we've gain'd to-night An ornament, and Shining Light. (The newly-elected Fellow puffeth his cheeks as about to return thanks, but words are wanting; Mr. Martin puffeth the fire; Mr. Fohn Britton puffeth himself and friend, as follows:—) (Mr. J. Britton) I rise, Sir, as I always do, Not that I've much to say that's new, But were I not my powers to try, You'd wonder what was come to I; Besides, I've got a thing to show, An article of great virtu, A piece of antique crockery ware, Dug up not far from Brunswick Square, The fragment of an earthen pot, With a handle—whether it had not Another once, is all a guess, The letters S P, or P S, Are plain, which stand for Publius Spurius, Or Spurius Publius— (Mr. Hoffman) —Dear! how curious! Permit me, sir, to feel the handle— Pray, Mr. Caley, snuff the candle! (Mr. Crofton Croker) Allow me, sir (what precious muffs!) You know friend Caley never snuffs. (Mr. Crofton Croker snuffeth the candle—out;;—a little bustle until it is relighted.) (Mr. Britton proceedeth) Now, sir, before my speech I close I've one more member to propose. The Gentleman I'm going to mention, Is famous for a grand Invention; Revival, I should rather say, The greatest far of this our day, Which some may think a mere absurdity, Or rank among the hearty purdity. Qu. Artes perditæ? This distinguished Antiquary's orthography, like Lord Duberly's, “is a little loose.” You've heard of Nimrod, Prince of Greece, The same that stole the Golden Fleece, And founded, after many a year, The Melton hunt in Leicestershire? A “mighty Hunter” he, you know, God knows how many years ago; Though his receipt has long been lacking, 'Tis known he used most famous Blacking, Which became lost unto the trade Somewhere about the third Crusade, And this my friend has found again! (Hear, hear.) I needn't say no more, 'tis plain You all anticipate me, and When I name Warren of the Strand, I cannot entertain a doubt You'll hail him with a general shout; So move, as now my speech I've ended, That he “as usual, be suspended.” (Hear, hear!” “Bravo!” etc., from the Brittonites; “No! No!” “Stuff!” “Puff!” and other expletives from the refractory. The President, with his cocked-hat en echelon, at length announceth that Robert Warren, Esq., is elected Fellow by acclamation.) (Mr. J. Britton) Now our Society may boast— (Sir Ev. Home) Pooh! Gammon! here's the tea and toast! The tray is brought in—a simultaneous rush at the muffins—Mr. Martin is scalded by a cup of coffee upset on his inexpressibles, and, in the confusion, our Reporter quitteth the room. Garris v. Kemble. A true and particular report of the case, Harris v. Kemble, as not heard in the House of Lords, September 5, 1831. Lord Mulgrave sat there, With his fine head of hair, While the Chancellor's look was so glum, That on t'other side Plunket Appeared much to funk it, And Lyndhurst kept biting his thumb. In front Sir Edward, His brief who had read hard, Began to address these great men; While behind, Mr. Pepys, Sat drawing little ships On the back of his brief with his pen. Messrs. Pulman and Currie Came up in a hurry, In bag-wigs, knee-breeches, and swords, As two gentlemen more Set open a door, And let in three queer-looking lords. King Norroy, so great In his tabard of state, To the Chancellor then made a bow; In a kind of a growl, he Says, “Here's my Lord Cowley, Who is come here to promise and vow!” Lord Brougham, for the Crown, Says, “My lord, pray sit down, You're quite welcome—I never dissemble.” So Lord C., after that, Puts on his cocked hat, And goes and sits down near Miss Kemble. Then was heard a sad rout In the lobby without, As if twenty or more were a-talking; And in came a summons, “A message from the Commons!” Says the Chancellor, “Pray let 'em walk in.” Then Sir John Milly Doyle, With a score more who toil In committee, to wait longer scorning, Came and said, “We agree Mrs. Turton to free From her husband. We wish you good morning.” “Then,” says my Lord Brougham, “It's high time to go home; Sir Edward, pray stop your red rag!” Then Counsellor Pepys Never opened his lips, But popped his brief into his bag. Then Sugden, so sly, Gave a wink with his eye, And shut up his brief without sorrow, Saying, “Earned with much ease, This morning, my fees, And hey for ten guineas to-morrow!” The Modern Ixion: OR, THE LOVES OF JOSEPH DALE AND ELIZA BAINES. Come listen to a mournful tale, All ye who feel for true Love's pains! Just twenty-two was Joseph Dale, Fifteen he deem'd Eliza Baines: A heart more tender or more true Ne'er throbb'd with passion than the swain's; And though she ne'er had met his view, That heart adored Eliza Baines. One Abraham Thornton (not the youth Who dash'd out Mary Ashton's brains, But one, alas! as void of truth) First told him of Eliza Baines; And how her roseate cheek grew pale, And how salt tears, like wintry rains, In torrents flow'd for Joseph Dale, All heedless of Eliza Baines. And she was fair, and rich as fair; With store of gold and wide domains; And blest the youth ordain'd to share All this with fair Eliza Baines! Oh, then a tender billet-doux He pens, and softly thus complains, “If you loves me as I loves you, I'll wed with sweet Eliza Baines.” He turns his back on Greenwich Park, Its glittering domes and gilded vanes, And sadly roams till almost dark, In hopes to meet Eliza Baines. To Lew'sham “lazy, lanky, long” (One epithet the Muse disdains As all unfit for poet's song), He hies to seek Eliza Baines; And there his devious path he winds, So pensive peeping through the panes— But ah! those curst Venetian blinds Seclude the fair Eliza Baines. In vain beneath that window high He pours his fond melodious strains, And coughs and sneezes—not a sigh Responds from Miss Eliza Baines. “Oh, Abraham Thornton, aid me now, If any spark of friendship reigns Within thy bosom, breathe a vow To bear me to Eliza Baines!” “A portrait, Joseph!” Abraham cried, True love in absence best sustains; There dwells a limner in Cheapside Will paint one for Eliza Baines. “To-morrow eve, at Astley's too, The fatal fray on Belgium's plains They act—a mimic Waterloo! There may'st thou see Eliza Baines!” Oh, then a hackney coach was call'd, A surly jarvey took the reins; “My fare's two bob!” he hoarsely bawl'd; Ah! how unlike Eliza Baines! They reach the pit—the great Ducrow From every hand applauses gains; Applause from Joseph Dale?—Ah! no, He thinks but on Eliza Baines. One form alone attracts his view, That form an upper box contains; Yon orange turban trimmed with blue— It is—it is Eliza Baines. “Bright vision! spare my aching sight!” He cries; and scarcely yet refrains To scale that box's topmost height, Though darkly frowns Eliza Baines. Withheld by Abraham, down he sunk, A snob his other arm detains, With “Blow my vig! the fellow's drunk!” He reck'd not of Eliza Baines! Ah, why must Fortune cruel prove? Why still delight in mortals' pains? Why rouse him from his dream of love? Why cry, “There's no Eliza Baines!” That fatal truth revealed, his breast Dire thoughts of vengeance entertains, False Thornton owns, a knave confest, “'Tis all my eye about Miss Baines!” At once his eyes turn darkly blue, His nose the spouting claret stains; Fierce Joseph strikes so swift, so true, Thus hoax'd about Eliza Baines. And “Sarve him right!” the people say, Of pity they bestow no grains On one who could his friend betray, To love a false Eliza Baines. Alas, for Joseph Dale! bereft, And forc'd to reassume the reins, The whip, the box he lately left Rejoicing, for Eliza Baines; Bound to the ever-whirling wheel, Ixion's fault—Ixion's chains He shares like him, condemn'd to feel He clasp'd a cloud in Betty Baines. The Cabouat Tragedy. The Roman bard feelingly laments that many great names have failed to reach posterity— Carent quia vate sacro. Those of Messrs. Cabouat and Simon, two of the most illustrious cut-throats of modern times, will at least not be lost for want of this advantage. It is but two days ago that we had to report their execution, and a poem of 150 stanzas is already published, composed by one of the most brilliant geniuses, which must immortalize their memory. We regret much that its length precludes our giving this splendid effusion entire and in its original language; “Half a loaf,” however, says the adage “is better than no bread,” and therefore we venture to Shenstonize a few verses, commencing with its opening address to “Tout bon et sensible cœur.” Come listen to a doleful tale Each tender heart that throbs with pity, Your very cores will all turn pale Before I've got through half my ditty. A hapless Abbé's fate I sing, Whose sons-in-law took much in dudgeon A will they thought not quite the thing, So beat his brains out with a bludgeon. Pseaume was his name (for verse a cramp One); they who for his blood did hunger, Were a sad and thorough-going scamp, Call'd Adolphe Cabouat the younger, And one who bore as bad a fame, In dress and mien though somewhat neater, And Peter Simon was his name— Ah! how unlike to Simon Peter! The bard goes on to relate the marriages of the two daughters of Pseaume, the death of Cornelie, Simon's wife, and her fatal will which sowed the first seeds of enmity in her husband's breast, and eventually produced such a dreadful result. She thus consigns her children to the care of the Abbé:— “Oh! for the love of heav'n, papa, When I am gone and toll'd my knell is, Be thou to them a new mamma, And fill their little darling bellies. “Protect, I pray, my children three According to my true intention; They will be better far with thee Than with that chap—I shall not mention.” Expressive silence! Ah, poor thing! E'en then she could not charge a crime on The man she once had lov'd, nor bring Her pen to write “that rascal Simon.” In describing the marriage of Eliza Pseaume with Cabouat, so reluctantly consented to by her father, he alludes to the efforts of Madame Pseaume to overcome her husband's reluctance to the match:— Dame Jeanne, who thought him meek and mild, And had a soul above base Mammon, Cried, “Dearest, do indulge the child!” The Abbé only answered, “Gammon!” Oh! had he uttered “Gammon” still His then so seeming harsh denial Had saved himself a bitter pill, His daughter many a bitter trial; Nay, sad forebodings shook the bride, Her future lot foreshadowing evil in; She wept so while the knot was tied, She set the very parson snivelling. After recounting at great length the perpetration of the crime, etc., he describes the behaviour of the prisoners while in gaol:— They laugh'd, they quaffed, they drained the cup, Nor thought on him they'd used so cruelly, All reckless that they soon might sup On sulphur broth with brimstone bouilly. Many just compliments are paid to the presiding judge, M. de Sansonetti, and the rest of the Bench, as well in prose as in verse, and the whole is at last wound up with the affecting adieus of Simon to his family and to the members of the Court that had condemned him:— “Great sirs, who from you bench look down, And thou, illustrious Sansonetti! Sage Thiriet, counsel for the Crown! Gents of the Jury, Grand and Petty! “By your just judgment doom'd to trip, Mercy I hope not, nor will ask it; (To the Executioner.) So jump about, Jack Ketch, and snip My knowledge-box into your basket!” The Brave Lieutenant Fitch. Some talk of Alexander, And some of Hercules, Of Conon and Lysander, And of Miltiades; But of all the world's brave heroes, There's none have reach'd the pitch, With their tow-row-row-dow-dow, Of the brave Lieutenant Fitch. When Miguel's Commanders On Lisbon turn'd their tail, A “mob of thirty people” came And took me out of jail. I arm'd them all with broomsticks, And a crow-bar like a switch, With my tow-row-row-dow-dow, Wav'd brave Lieutenant Fitch. My troops I then commanded To march to Fort St. John; We boldly stormed the outworks— For the garrison was gone. I sprang upon the sentinel And knock'd him in the ditch, With my tow-row-row-dow-dow, Oh! brave Lieutenant Fitch. Then through the streets of Lisbon, I marched with five and drum, And the girls all cried, “Huzza my boys, Lieutenant Fitch is come!” Says Villa Flor, “My hero, You behaved yourself as `sich,' With your tow-row-row-dow-dow, My brave Lieutenant Fitch!” That fine old cock Palmella, As well as Villa Flor, Cried, “Such a valiant fellow Me nevare see afore!” In Fame's historic temple He vell deserve a niche, With his tow-row-row-dow-dow, Dis brave Lieutenant Fitch.” My “single arm” thus routed The whole o'the hostile squad; The “mob” all roared and shouted, And “I felt like a god!” And wasn't the Queen of Portugal A lucky little—witch, With her tow-row-row-dow-dow, To have Lieutenant Fitch? So Gemmen fill a bumper Of max, and drink each one, Here's luck and a jolly scramble For every mother's son! And may tag, rag, and bobtail All grow exceeding rich, With their tow-row-row-dow-dow, Like the brave Lieutenant Fitch. Lines Left at Hook's House in June, 1834. As Dick and I Were a-sailing by At Fulham Bridge, I cock'd my eye, And says I, “Add-zooks! There's Theodore Hook's. Whose Sayings and Doings make such pretty books. “I wonder,” says I, Still keeping my eye On the house, “if he's in—I should like to try;” With his oar on his knee, Says Dick, says he, “Father, suppose you land and see!” “What! land and sea,” Says I to he; “Together! why, Dick, why how can that be?” And my comical son, Who is fond of fun, I thought would have split his sides at the pun. So we rows to shore, And knocks at the door— When William, a man I'd seen often before, Makes answer and says, “Master's gone in a chaise Call'd a homnibus, drawn by a couple of bays.” So I says then, “Just lend me a pen;” “I wull, sir,” says William—politest of men, So having no card, these poetical brayings Are the record I leave of my doings and sayings. A Parody.My Lord P—loquitur— My cab is at the door, Thou must raise the wind for me— But ere you go, Tom Moore, It need scarcely be said that the Tom Moore addressed in the above pathetic lines was not the poet, but one whose name was mixed up with that of a noble lord in certain bill transactions which came before the public. Here's a snug douceur for thee! Here's a bond for those who'll lend me, And a bill at six months' date— And I'll sign whate'er you send me,— Get the cash at any rate! Though boring duns surround me, They still must trust me on; Till you the cash have found me, “Call again” to every one! Each knock I know full well, And my fainting spirits sink When they pull the area bell, So be off and fetch the “chink!” Mind and bring me back by one, Of thousands half a score,— Hark! there's another dun;— Adieu! adieu! Tom Moore! Lament.Dr. Taylor loquitur. Ochone! ochone! For the portrait of Soane, Jerdan! you ought to have let it alone; Don't you see that instead of removing the bone Of contention, the apple of discord you've thrown; One general moan, Like a tragedy groan, Burst forth when the picture-cide became known. When the story got “blown,” From the Thames to the Rhone, Folks ran, ran, calling for ether and eau-de-Cologne; All shocked at the want of discretion you've shown! If your heart's not of stone, You will quickly atone. The best way to do that's to ask Mr. Roney to sew up the slit; the committee, you'll own, When it's once stitched together, must see that it's Soane Query, Sewn.—I'rinter's Devil. Lines Written in Harrow Churchyard, on the occasion of a wedding being delayed by the absence of the officiating minister. Mr. Bruce, Mr. Bruce, When the matrimonial noose You ought here at Harrow to be tying, If you choose to ride away As you know you did to-day, No wonder bride and bridegroom should be crying. It's a very great abuse, Mr. Bruce, Mr. Bruce! And you're quite without excuse, And of very little use As a curate, Mr. Bruce! The Church's Petition. Passing through the Parish of Flempton, County Suffolk, a few days since, we were much struck with the picturesque appearance of the parish church—in ruins. While gazing upon it in the twilight, with that look of pensive abstraction which sits so well upon our fine features, and which the hour was so calculated to encourage, on a sudden the church door opened slow and wide, mouth-fashion, and a voice from within, which sounded like the cracked double G of a decayed organ-pipe, uttered the following Lament:— Pity the sorrows of a poor old Church, With half a tower, and scarce a decent door; The hard churchwardens leave me in the lurch, And rural deans, despairing, give me o'er! Thatch'd roof, and porch my poverty bespeak, Untouch'd by workman since the ancient years Of Blastus Godly Once Rector of the Parish, and buried in the chancel, a. d. 1719.; and my belfry's wreck Excites the nervous congregation's fears. Yet many a spot, with wood and mansion crown'd, I view around me on the Bury road, Where wanton wealth profusely decks the ground, And cherish'd pheasants find a safe abode. Hard is the treatment of the House of God— The sum that gives one keeper yearly bread Would patch my ruins, that neglected nod, Envying the snugness of each humbler shed. I ask no gilded weathercock or dome. But a few stones to fence me from the cold— A boon denied not to the ploughman's home, Or barn, no matter how unsound and old. Fair neighbours, cast an eye upon my grief, Now that success your famed Bazaar has blest; And when the poor have shared their due relief, Pray, for Heaven's sake, bestow on me the rest! Good Mrs. Williams, A worthy lady, authoress of “Tales of Mendicity,” printed and sold at bazaar aforesaid, for the benefit of the county hospital. do but print a line, Just to describe me in the plight you see; A stronger case can scarce be found than mine, In thine own “Stories of Mendicity.” 'Twould melt the bowels of an honest Turk, To see a Christian Mosque so scant-equipt Like an old shiver'd lime-kiln past its work, Or a sham ruin with the ivy stript. The tale that Lancashire's revilers tell, Can scarcely match my melancholy state, When the churchwardens sold the steeple bell To buy strong liquors, and a bull to bait. Pity the sorrows of a poor old Church, Ye who roll past in daily coach and four, Find a few pounds for my repair; the search Will scarce exhaust your overflowing store! To Dr. Roberts, with a China Jug. Dear Doctor,—This jug, which can't foam with mild ale, While you turn down its top so, to look at its tail, Was not Toby Fillpot's—and yet on the whole, It's as good as the jug of that thirsty old soul; For boozing about it will answer as well, And when fill'd with my mixture will bear off the bell. When you chance in the dog-days to sit at your ease, A pint of sweet mountain, as old as you please, With a bottle of iced soda-water allay, Then of honest old “Stingo,” a pint pour away, Pop in nutmeg, one slice from a cucumber cut, And then drink till you're full as a Dorchester butt. A body of friends should you long entertain, And they empty it often—why, fill it again; Don't potter about Toby Fillpot's brown jug, Say, “That for old Toby!—give me my white mug; It's sacred to friendship, white wine, and mild ale,” So up with its mouth now and turn down its tail! The Two M.P.'s. Magazine Publisher and Member of Parliament.) BEING A TRUE AND PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THE GRAND MILLING MATCH THAT DIDN'T TAKE PLACE. Says Tom Duncombe to Fraser T'other morning, “I say, sir, You've called me a Roué, a Dicer, and Racer; Now I'd have you to know, sir, Such names are ‘no go,’ sir; By Jove, sir! I never knew anything grosser. “And then Madame Vestris Extremely distrest is At your calling her Lais. She's more like Thalestris, As you'll find, my fine joker, If you only provoke her, She's a d—l if once she gets hold of a poker. “For myself, to be candid, And not underhanded, I write thus to say, I'll be hang'd if I stand it. So give up the name Of the man or the dame Who has made this infernal attack on my fame, And recall what you've said of A man you're afraid of, Or, turn out, my Trump, and let's see what you're made of. “I have ‘barkers’ by Nock, sir, With percussion locks, sir, Will give you your gruel—hang me if I box, sir, And I've sent my old Pal in, My ‘noble friend Allen,’ To give you this here, and to stop your caballing!” Then says Fraser, says he, “What a spoon you must be, Tommy Duncombe, to send such a message to me. Why, if I was to fight about What my friends write about, My life I should be in continual fright about! “As to telling you who Wrote that thing about you, One word's worth a thousand—Blow me if I do! If you will be so gay, sir, The people will say, sir, That you are a Roué,—and I'm Yours, Jemmy Fraser.” Lines on the Birthday of Sir Thomas White. (Founder of Merchant Taylors' School.) THE ANNUAL TRIBUTE TO HIS MEMORY. Sir Thomas White Was a noble knight, Extremely desirous of doing what's right; So he sat himself down one beautiful night, When the moon shone so bright That he asked for no light Beyond that of her beams, and began to indite His last will,—so remarkably good was his sight,— And he charged and bound down his executors tight, As soon as his soul should have taken its flight, To erect a good school of proportionate height, Length, and breadth—Suffolk Lane he proposed for its site, And its order what architects term Composite— In which all such nice little good boys who might At the date of their entrance have not attained quite Their tenth year, should be brought up to read and to write; Not to give way to spite, Nor to quarrel nor fight, But to show themselves always well bred and polite, Keep hands and face clean, and be decently dight In clothes of a grave colour rather than bright— At least not so light as remark to excite— And to make Greek and Latin their chiefest delight; To be mild in demeanour, in morals upright; Not to kick, nor to bite, Nor to pinch, nor affright Each other by practical jokes, as at night By aping a goblin, humgruffin, or sprite; And never to wrong of so much as a mite, Or a bat, or a ball, or a hoop, or a kite, Any poor little schoolfellow—Oh, what a plight I am in after all—poor unfortunate wight! I can't make my number of verses up quite; For my paper's expended, My rhymes too are ended, And I can write no more, for I've no more to write; So if a line short, I'm in hopes, Mister Bellamy Will pity my case, and not cease to think well o' me. The Coronation. A VISION. (Private and confidential.) June 28, 1838. I sat within the Abbey walls—I went to wake and weep! But O, I can't tell how it was, I somehow fell asleep; A sort of day-mare seized me then, if so aright I deem, And a vision wild came o'er my mind “which was not all a dream.” I looked and lo! it seemed as though the scene I might espy Through a Dollond's patent telescope with the wrong end at my eye, And thus, as though a fairy hand there all things did compress, “Fine by degrees” each object seemed and “beautifully less.” In front I saw a little Queen was sitting all alone, And little Dukes and Duchesses knelt round her little throne, And a little Lord Archbishop came, and a little prayer he said, And then he popped a little crown upon her little head. And near her stood a little man I had somewhere seen before, In a little mulberry-coloured coat, or rather Pompadour; A little sword was by his side, all glorious to be seen, And little inexpressibles all of the apple-green. And a pretty little snow-white flag he held all in his hand. Which he waved a little to and for as ensign of command, And there was a little robing-room and he stood just by the door, And he watched all going on within in his coat of Pompadour. Within this little robing-room this little Queen had got A little cup and saucer and a little coffee-pot, And when the little Queen was heard her little nose to blow, He waved and all the little fiddlers played all on a row. The little fiddlers played so loud at last that I awoke, And all the vision wild at once it vanished into smoke, So let us sing long live the Queen, and the flagman long live he, And when he next doth wave his flag, may I be there to see! A Song of Sixpence. No. I. “Mr. B? sends his bill back—won't pay it—and begs To inform the Committee they're regular ‘legs,’ And have charged him too much for his ham and his eggs!” No. II. “Dear Sir—The Committee direct me to say That the bill's quite correct which was sent you to-day; It was not eight o'clock when you sat down to dine, And we charge for the table from four until nine. They have not the least wish your remonstrance to stifle, But you're wrong—and they'll thank you to pay that'ere trifle! I am further desired to inform Mr. B— That, in calling them ‘legs,’ he makes rather too free. “J. W.” No. III. “You may tell that banditti, the ? Committee, Not a chop-house would charge me so much in the City. 'Twas no dinner at all; I meant only to sup; If you say that I dined you're a lying old pup! You may tell the Committee again—and I say it, They are ‘legs’—and sixpence!—I'm hanged if I pay it. “M. B.” No. IV. “Sir—Once more the Committee direct me to state, When you sat down to dinner it had not struck eight; When you come to consider what ‘table’ means here— Cloth, napkin, wax, vinegar, mustard, oil, beer, Pepper, pickles, and bread at discretion—it's clear The additional sixpence can never be dear! So you'd better fork out, sir, at once; if you won't They must really enforce it—and blessed if they don't! “J. W.” No. V. “Take the sixpence, you thieves! I say still it's a chouse; Your threat to ‘enforce’ I don't value one— And hang me if I ever set foot in your house! “M. B.” VI. “Sir—Since writing my last I have asked the advice Of my friends Mr. Bacon and Governor Price, And the governor says ‘he'll be—sir’ if I'm Not a jackass for writing what I thought sublime; ‘It's just what the ? fellows wanted; you'd better Get somebody else, sir, to write you a letter Withdrawing your own.’ So I have, and I'll thank The Committee to mark that this comes by a frank. “M. B.” No. VII. “Mr. Winston presents his best compliments—begs To inform Mr. B? he is somewhat mistaken If, having got into his scrape by his eggs, He thinks to get out of it now by his Bacon! Advertisement. (February 4th, 1845.) Mr. Joseph J. B., I have paid Mr. Lee For Jessie, and all that is due, Of which I am willing Not one single shilling Shall e'er be repaid me by you. We have suffered, J. J. B., Both I and the baby, Oh, don't let revenge be your plan! But knock at my door, Pray see me once more— Come to Islington, that's a dear man! Should I advertise Your height, person, and size, And your name too, I have not a doubt, That wherever you roam, Abroad or at home, J.J.B., you'd soon be found out! I don't in the least Want to hurt you—you beast! But mind, J.J.B., and beware! For your own sake and mine Come to-morrow and dine, And don't drive me on to despair! J.J. Sum and Substance of a New Domestic Tragedy. Act I. The Duchess of Ormond, rich, comely, and fat, Is in love with a man in a “shocking bad hat;” And the Duke coming home from a ball, about two, Finds the man in her bedroom, and says, “Who are you?” Says he, “My name's Mortimer, I am an old beau Of her Grace, ere you married her, three years ago!” Says the Duke, “We were married in France, so, of course, I must go back to France then, and get a divorce.” Act II. Four years have elapsed, and, released from her vows, The Duchess is now Mr. Mortimer's spouse, And her happiness has but this single alloy— Mr. Mortimer don't like the Duke's little boy; So catching, one day, the young gentleman tripping, He seizes him rudely, and gives him a whipping: Mrs. Mortimer grows very angry, and sends Master Charles, that same afternoon, home to his friends. Act III. Six months more are gone, and the Duke is preparing To take his son with him to France, for an airing; And poor Mrs. Mortimer, hearing of this, Steps across to the garden to give him a kiss; Mr. Mortimer follows, and, being so tall, Has no very great trouble in climbing the wall: The Duke, spying him out, asks again, “Who are you?” Mr. Mortimer says, “Here are pistols for two!” “By all means,” says his Grace, “it's no bad way of thanking Your Worship for giving my boy such a spanking!” So each cocks his pistol, and no more is said, But the Duke sends a bullet through Mortimer's head, And they let down the curtain the moment he's dead!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FAMILY POETRY. Dick's Long-Tailed Coat. “Modo sumpta veste virili.”—Horace. Zooks! I must woo the muse to-day, Though line before I'd never wrote. Ask you what theme demands the lay?— Our Dick has got a Long-tail'd Coat! Not the coatee which soldiers wear, Tight button'd up beneath the throat, But easy,—flowing,—debonnaire;— In short, a civil Long-tail'd Coat! One smarter you'll not find in town, Cut by Nugee, that Snip of note;— A very quiet olive-brown 's the colour of Dick's Long-tail'd Coat! Gay jackets clothe the stately Pole, The proud Hungarian, and the Croat, Yet Esterhazy, on the whole, Looks smartest in a Long-tail'd Coat. Lord Byron most admired, we know, The Albanian dress, or Suliote; But he lived much abroad, and so He never saw Dick's Long-tail'd Coat. Or else that noble Poet's theme Had never been the “White Capote,” Had he once view'd, in Fancy's dream, The glories of Dick's Long-tail'd Coat. We also know on Highland Kilt Poor dear Glengarry Macdonnell of Glengarry, popularly called ``the last of the chiefs,” from his adherence to the old state and costume. used to dote, And had esteem'd it actual guilt I' the Gael to wear a Long-tail'd Coat. And well it might his eyes annoy; Monkbarns himself could never quote “Sir Robert Sibbald,” “Gordon,” “Roy,” Or “Stukely,” for a Long-tail'd Coat! But though the fleet red deer to chase, Or guide o'er Highland loch the boat, A jacket's well enough—for grace There's nothing like Dick's Long-tail'd Coat. Of course, in climbing up a tree, On terra firma, or afloat, To mount the giddy topmast, he Would doff awhile his Long-tail'd Coat. Then whence that supercilious sneer?— From out your own eye pull the mote, Fastidious Critic!—did you ne'er In youth admire your Long-tail'd Coat? Oh, “Dick's scarce old enough,” you mean? Why, though too young to have a vote, Or make a will, yet sure Fifteen 's a ripe age for a Long-tail'd Coat! What!—would you have him sport a chin Like Colonel Sibthorp, or a goat, Before you think he should begin To figure in a Long-tail'd Coat? Suppose he visits France—can he Sit down at any table-d'bôte With any sort of decency, Unless he's got a Long-tail'd Coat. E'en Louis Philippe, Royal Cit, There soon may be a sans-culotte, And Nugent's self must then admit The advantage of a Long-tail'd Coat. Things are not now as when, of yore, In tower encircled by a moat, Each lion-hearted chieftain wore A corslet—not a Long-tail'd Coat. Chain-mail his portly form embraced, Not like a weazel or a stoat, “Cribb'd and confined” about the waist, And pinch'd in like Dick's Long-tail'd Coat. With beaming spear or biting axe To right and left he thrust and smote. Ah! what a change! no sinewy thwacks Fall from a modern Long-tail'd Coat! To stalwart knights, a puny race Succeeds,—with locks en papillote,— While cuirass, cuisses, greaves, give place To silk-net “Tights” and Long-tail'd Coat! Worse changes still! now, well-a-day! A few cant phrases learnt by rote, Each beardless booby spouts away, A Solon in a Long-tail'd Coat! Prates of the “March of Intellect,” The “Schoolmaster”—a Patriote So noble who could e'er suspect Had just put on his Long-tail'd Coat! Alack! alack! that every thick-skull'd lad must find an antidote For England's woes, because, like Dick, He has put on a Long-tail'd Coat! But, lo! my rhymes begin to fail, Nor dare I longer time devote! Thus Rhyme and Time cut off the tale— The long tale—of Dick's Long-tail'd Coat! The Country Seat. Summer Hill—near Tunbridge, the seat formerly of the Lord Muskerry, and now (1833) of James Alexander, Esq. The noble proprietor (Muskerry, not Alexander) entertained Charles the Second and his whole court here—teste John Britton, whose valuable history of Tunbridge Wells consult for an account of Lord Chancellor Mansfield, and the inhuman Judge Jeffries, who disgraced himself so at the trial of Charles the First, as the worthy antiquary asserts, in direct contradiction to those who maintain that the name of the regicide president was Bradshaw, and that he was afterwards married to Miss Mary Anne Tree, of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden.—(T. I.) O Summer Hill! if thou wert mine I'd order in a pipe of wine, And ask a dozen friends to dine! In faith, I would not spare the guineas, But send for Pag—and other—ninnies, Flutes, hautboys, fiddles, pipes, and tabors, Hussars with moustaches and sabres, Quadrilles, and that grand waltz of Weber's, And give a dance to all my neighbours; And here I'd sit and quaff my fill Among the trees of Summer Hill. Then, with pleased eye, careering slowly O'er beech-crown'd ridge and valley lowly, We'd drain a cup to thee, Old Rowley!— To thee, and to thy courtly train, Once tenants of this fair domain, Soft Stewart, haughtiest Castlemaine. Pert Nelly Gwynne, gay Molly Davis, And many another Rara Avis. E'en now, 'midst yonder leafy glade, Methinks I see thy royal shade In amplitude of wig array'd; Near thee, thy rival in peruke, Stands Buckingham's uproarious Duke, With Tory Hamilton and Killegrew, And Rochester, that rake till ill he grew; When, to amend his life and turn it, He firmly promised Dr. Burnet— In time, let's hope, to make old Nicholas, Still watching for our sins to tickle us, Lose all his pains, and look ridiculous. With visage rather grave than merry, See, too, thy noble host Muskerry Leads forth,—to crown and end the stanza, Thy consort, Catharine of Braganza. Oh, Alexander! loftier far Now culminates thy natal star, Than his of old, mine ancient crony, Thy namesake, erst of Macedony (Unrivall'd,—save, perhaps, by Boney). Oh, happier far, in thy degree, Art thou, although a conqueror he, Whilst thou art but an Ex-M.P. Oh, happier far! propitious Fate, Making thee lord of this estate, Dubb'd thee in verity “The Great;” Yea, far more blest, my Alexander, Art thou than that renowned commander! Thou ne'er was led through wanton revelling Those sylvan scenes to play the devil in, And I, for one, shouldst thou invite us, Would never dread the fate of Clytus; For midst these shades, so loved by Grammont, Thou never yet thy friends did gammon, By calling of thyself “Young Ammon.” No frolic dame of easy virtue, E'er made you drink enough to hurt you; And then, with impudence amazing, Bade you set house and all a-blazing ('Tis hard to say which works the quicker To make folks noodles—love or liquor; But oh, it is a fearsome thing, When both combine to make a king Descend to play the part of Swing!) I dare be sworn thou dost not sigh, Much less put finger in thine eye, For other worlds,—no, Alexander, I know thou art not such a gander; This is thy globe—here “toujours gai,” Thy motto still—though, well-a-day! Old Sarum's put in Schedule A. O Summer, Summer, Summer Hill! Fain would I gaze and linger still— But, ah! the moon her silver lamp Uprears, the grass is getting damp— And hark! the curfew's distant knell, Is told by Doctor Knox's bell— I go, to join my wife and daughters, Drinking those nasty-tasted waters. O Summer Hill! retreat divine! Ah me! I cannot but repine Thou art not,—never will be mine— I haven't even got the wine! Tunbridge Wells, Sept. 30, 1833. The Sheriff's Ball. “Raphael, the sociable spirit.”—Milton. “Here's glorious news!” cried Cousin Jack, One Sunday, in a morning call He made about a twelvemonth back— “The Sheriff's going to give a Ball!” Up started Jane, and I, and Bess; One general rapture seized us all; “Pink satin shoes,”—“kid gloves,”—“lace dress,”— “That angel, Raphael, gives a Ball!” The ‘Sunday Times’ has got it in, The ‘John Bull,’ too, in pica small, The ‘Age,’ th' ‘Observer,’ all begin To talk of Sheriff Raphael's Ball! And Pa's a livery-man, you know, Of Bassishaw by London Wall, And so, of course, we all shall go To Mister Sheriff Raphael's Ball! Next day Ma sent our porter, Bill, To call a coach to take us all To Ellis's on Ludgate Hill, To shop for Sheriff Raphael's Ball! There she, resolving to look nice, Bought for herself a Cashmere shawl, A Toque, and Bird of Paradise, To wear at Sheriff Raphael's Ball! And Betsey bought the sweetest things, The last consignment from Bengal, All green-and-gold and beetles' wings, To be the pride of Raphael's Ball! And Jane, a new white satin slip, And I, because I'm rather tall, A sky-blue China crape, to trip Away in at the Sheriff's Ball! And Cousin Jack, who's so genteel, Before he went, engaged us all To dance with him the new quadrille, And waltz, at Sheriff Raphael's Ball. Oh how we teased Madame de Lolme, And Ma'amselle Victorine St. Paul, “—Pray don't forget to send all home, In time for Sheriff Raphael's Ball!” 'Twas all prepared—gloves, bouquets, shoes, And dresses—Jane's a thought too small;— But ah! no Jack announced the news, “To-morrow's Sheriff Raphael's Ball!” At length he comes! in eager haste His stock and plaited frill we maul— Never was man so close embraced— O, Jack! when's Sheriff Raphael's Ball?” “Why, really—I—that is—the day Precisely”—with his Bond Street drawl Cries Jack—“I can't exactly say What day is fixed for Raphael's Ball; “But he who fills the civic chair, I find, has promised him Guildhall, So ten to one the new Lord Mayor Will dance at Sheriff Raphael's Ball. For though my Lord's a Tory true, And Raphael's but a Radi-cal, Yet politics have nought to do, You know, with any Sheriff's Ball! And Mr. Pearson City Solicitor. will be there, With Galloway from Codger's Hall, And all the Lumber Troop,”—“Oh dear! I long for Sheriff Raphael's Ball! “For there will be Sir John, Sir John Key,—twice Lord Mayor of London,—who had recently fallen into some trifling error in the computation of his son's age. whose son At sixteen thought for place too small, Grew up, in one night, to twenty-one,— He'll come to Sheriff Raphael's Ball. “And Michael Scales will doff his steel, And quit his snug Whitechapel stall, Blue apron, block, and donkey veal, An allusion to a practical joke (not generally appreciated) perpetrated by the worthy Alderman, who killed, dressed, and exposed in his shop a jackass, and pleasantly passed it off as veal. To dance at Sheriff Raphael's Ball.” At morn, at eve, that livelong week, And e'en when night her sable pall Had spread around, no tongue could speak Of aught save Sheriff Raphael's Ball. Nay, not our waking thoughts alone, Our midnight dreams could we recall, Ma, Jane, and Betsey, all would own, They were of Sheriff Raphael's Ball. Time flies—three months are gone—again Our Cousin Jack repeats his call— “What news?” exclaims th' impatient train, “What news of Sheriff Raphael's Ball?” Jack shakes his head—“Alack!” cries he, —His tones our very hearts appal— “He's striving to become M.P., And must perforce put off his Ball!” Spring flies away—and summer, then The autumn leaves begin to fall, “O Jack! in pity tell us, when, Oh when is Sheriff Raphael's Ball! “O'er Jane's white slip a bilious hue By slow degrees begins to crawl— A yellowish tint invades my blue— 'Twill fade ere Sheriff Raphael's Ball. “And poor Mamma!—although her part The philosophic Ma'am de Staël Could not more firmly play—her heart In secret yearns for Raphael's Ball.” On leaden wings November flies, And more disasters still befall. In rushes Jack—“Alas!” he cries, “No hopes of Sheriff Raphael's Ball! “For oh! there has been such a breeze, A breeze that, freshening to a squall, Became a hurricane.—Agrees A whirlwind with a Sheriff's Ball? “Jane! Betsey! Sue!—that shocking man— He with the tail—who loves a brawl! That horrid, ranting, roaring Dan, In 1835, the elections for the county of Carlow having been declared void, Mr. Raphael bargained with O'Connell for a seat at the price of £2000; the latter assuring that he would never again meet with so safe a speculation. The particulars of the engagement were made public in consequence of a quarrel which took place between O'Connell and the candidate, who was unseated on petition, and whose defence was abandoned—contrary to the agreement, as he averred—by the “Liberator.” Has upset Sheriff Raphael's Ball. “The ‘blunt’—the ‘stuff’—the ‘rhino’—ay, Two thousand pounds! a glorious haul! A sum which had gone near to pay The whole expense of Raphael's Ball!!” “But 'tis done—all words are idle!” (So sang Byron in his yawl) And we now perforce must bridle Each fond wish for Raphael's Ball! And yet the Gloves—the Crape—the Toque— The spangled muslin from Nepaul! —Oh, it would e'en a saint provoke Thus diddled out of Raphael's Ball! Shame on their heads! but Dan on thine Our heaviest maledictions fall— Pa's, Ma's, Jane's, Betsey's, Jack's, and mine, Thou Thalaba of Raphael's Ball!! The Drawing Room. Oh! we're a' nodding, nid-nid-nodding, Oh! we're a' nodding at our house to-day; There's my wife and my daughter, My sister and my mother, They're a' deck'd out in plumes, And they're nodding at each other, For the Birthday's come, And her Majesty the Queen Holds a Drawing Room, and all of us Are anxious to be seen; And we're a' nodding, nid-nid-nodding, Oh! we're a' nodding at our house to-day. There's plump Mrs. Jukes, From Great St. Helen's Place, Has got a dress of Llama, richly ‘Trimm'd with Urling's lace.’ Miss Jones has got a ‘Colonnade Dress,’ ending in a flounce, Superbly trimm'd with silver spangles, Half-a-crown an ounce! And they're both nodding, nid-nid-nodding, Oh! they're both nodding at our house to-day. Lady Sims has got a ‘white tulle dress’ Adorn'd with ‘flowers and blonde,’ Above a ‘satin petticoat’ ‘With sleeves to correspond,’ ‘A coronet of feathers, with Blonde lappets,’ on her head, And she looks just like a shuttlecock Upon a feather bed! And she's nodding, nid-nid-nodding, Oh! she's nodding at our house to-day. Mrs. Snooks has got a robe, ‘Fitted nicely to her shape,’ With charming ‘silver sprigs,’ all ‘Embroider'd on white crape;’ Sally Wilkins sports a train, All so gorgeous to behold, Of ‘vapeur terre velvet,’ and ‘Embroider'd round with gold;’ And they're nodding, nid-nid-nodding, Oh! they too are nodding at our house to-day. There's Sir Claudius, with his chain Twisted twice about his throat, And very odd it looks upon A Colonel's scarlet coat; There's my Lord Mayor, Key, With his collar, but no gown, His sword has got between his legs, Oh, dear! he'll tumble down! For he's nodding, nid-nid-nodding, Oh! he too is nodding at our house to-day. Come, they're all off at last To St. James's, in their carriages, I hope they won't come back again To our house to-day; For my head's completely bothered with ‘Presentations,’ ‘Court,’ and ‘Marriages,’ I'm sure I cannot understand One half of what they say! For they call it ‘Coming out,’ When I thought 'twas ‘Going in,’ And they talk of ‘Lamas,’ ‘Tulle,’ and ‘Toque,’ ‘Brocade,’ and ‘Pelerine;’ Of ‘Blonde, Drap à la Sévigné,’ ‘Mantillas,’ and ‘Manteaus,’ And ‘garnitures of rich Chenille,’ And ‘Slips couleur de rose;’ And we're all bother'd, both-both-bother'd, Oh! we're all bother'd at our house to-day. Now, what's the ‘couleur immortelle,’ I'm sure I cannot guess, Though I dare say there'll be plenty at The Opera to-night, With ‘corsages trimm'd à la cour,’ And ‘Cherry tissue dress,’ And ‘Beret sleeves, with blond sabets,’ And ‘vert pomme, over white;’ There's Polly Sprigs, dress'd à la Grecque, With ‘grenat velvet train’ And ‘epaulettes,’ will never speak To Peter Dobbs again; While Sally Maggs, in satin ‘torsad,’ Will not give a nod To Mister Perkins, in the pit, Who thinks it very odd; For he'll keep nodding, nid-nid-nodding, Oh! he'll keep nodding at the Opera to-night. I'm sure I shall be very glad When once they're all undrest, And their ‘Pomeran velours épinglé Trains' are stow'd away; These ‘ruches,’ ‘manches,’ ‘slips,’ and ‘toques,’ Have rather broke my rest; For though they're all ‘so cheap,’ I doubt There'll be a deal to pay. But my wife says “No! We can't always stay at home, And we must do as Romans do Whenever we're at Rome!” And her head keeps nodding, nid-nid-nodding, Oh! her head keeps nodding at me, till she has her way. To Jerry Jerry, my cat, What the deuce are you at? What makes you so restless? You're sleek and you're fat, And you've everything cosy about you—now that Soft rug you are lying on beats any mat; Your coat's smooth as silk, You've plenty of milk, You've the fish-bones for dinner, and always o' nights For supper you know you've a penn'orth o' lights! Jerry, my cat, What the deuce are you at? What is it, my Jerry, that fidgets you so? What is it you're wanting? (Jerry) Moll roe! Moll roe! Oh, don't talk to me of such nonsense as that! You've been always a very respectable cat; As the Scotch would say, “Whiles” You've been out on the tiles; But you've sown your wild oats, and you very well know You're no longer a kitten. (Jerry) Moll roe! Moll roe! Well, Jerry, I'm really concerned for your case; I've been young, and can fancy myself in your place: Time has been I've stood By the edge of the wood, And have mew'd—that is, whistled, a sound just as good; But we're both of us older, my cat, as you know, And I hope are grown wiser. (Jerry) Moll roe! Moll roe! Lines on the Tom Cat. Of all sorts of nuisances people complain, Of a pewterer's shop, of a soap-cart, or drain, But no such annoyance I've heard of or read, As a nasty Tom Cat with a cold in his head. For all the day long he is coughing and sneezing, He makes believe purr, but it's only a wheezing, And you hear too at night, snuffling under your bed, That nasty Tom Cat with a cold in his head! He mews in the morning for muffin and milk, He sniffs upon cotton, he sniffs upon silk, He jumps on the table and sniffs on the bread, That nasty Tom Cat with a cold in his head! He cocks up his tail and he gives it a lick, And he makes such a noise that he makes himself sick. Oh Tom! such proceedings are very ill bred, You nasty Tom Cat with a cold in your head! If you happen to ask who's been licking that dish, Who has upset the butter, or stolen the fish, Mary Anne will inform you, and so too will Ned, “'Tis that nasty Tom Cat with a cold in his head!” At night he is sure to jump up in a chair, And he rubs on your knees till he makes them all hair; For his hair once a month all the year through is shed, That nasty Tom Cat with a cold in his head! The people all call him a beast and a bore, They call “Hiss! Tom, get out,” and they open the door, And when Tom galloped off every one of them said, “Get out, you Tom Cat, with a cold in your head!” In the winter he squats down in front of the fire, And he tries all he can to get nigher and nigher, And he sniffs at the fender—I wish he were dead! That nasty Tom Cat with a cold in his head! At present he's lying full length on my knee, Now licking his coat, and now catching a flea, Go get me a gun, some powder, and lead, I'll shoot that Tom Cat with a cold in his head! He cocks up his ear when you talk of a gun, And doesn't believe you, but thinks you're in fun, You'll find out the difference, sir, when you're bled, You nasty Tom Cat with a cold in your head! But here he keeps lying, as cool as you please, I never saw Pussy Cat more at his ease; Of your gun it is clear he don't feel any dread— That nasty Tom Cat with a cold in his head! And now one more stanza I think is enough, I'll make up the dozen and all of them stuff, In vain I seek rhymes, they're all of them fled, With that nasty Tom Cat with a cold in his head! A Medley. (FOR A YOUNG LADY'S ALBUM.) Here's a pretty dilemma! The cruel Miss Emma Insists upon verses, insists upon verses, While Apollo refuses, Nor one of the Muses Assistance disburses, assistance disburses. How can I escape From this terrible scrape? What! an album's petition, an album's petition! No prospect I can see, Unless Madam Fancy Vouchsafes me a vision, a vision, a vision! Stay, methinks I see Phœbus, To make me a rebus Has laid down his fiddle, has laid down his fiddle, When in comes Judge Park With Sir Charles Mansfield Clark, And runs off with the riddle, the riddle, the riddle! Up starts Mrs. Hughes When she hears the news, And calling a Jarvey, and calling a Jarvey, Drives after them straightway, Through Lincoln's Inn gateway, With Dan Whittle Harvey, with Dan Whittle Harvey! The special attorney Stops short on the journey, Not liking the weather, the weather, the weather; So quitting the coach At Lord Melbourne's approach, They both begin waltzing together, together! While stout Mr. Bentley Trips after them gently, Assisted by Colborn, assisted by Colborn, Till Prince Esterhazy Runs off with his jasey, And pawns it in Holborn, in Holborn, in Holborn! Charles Kemble in vain Tries to get it again, And taps at the wicket, and taps at the wicket; But Little John Russell Contrives in the bustle To purloin the ticket, the ticket, the ticket! Colonel Evans comes up, And invites him to sup At the “Carlton,” with Lockhart, and Croker, and Croker, Where the ghost of Horne Tooke Blackballs Theodore Hook For being a joker, a joker, a joker! Then in comes Earl Grey, In his dignified way, Saying, “Dress me some dumplings with dripping, with dripping,” And ends by observing To Washington Irving, That Harrington's whiskers want clipping, want clipping; Unable to read, he Turns round to Macready, And tells him that yawning is catching, is catching; While the Duke of Buccleugh Assures Rothschild the Jew That Solomon's Temple wants thatching, wants thatching! So, locking his desk, he Roars out to Fieschi To shoot the Lord Mayor through the body, the body; For Lord Alvanley's groom, With Ducrow and Joe Hume, Are quaffing gin toddy, gin toddy, gin toddy. “Look here,” says Tom Moore; “I've a chop on a skewer, Which I mean to get dress'd for my dinner, my dinner, Since Lord Holland says Rogers And I are queer codgers, And calls Sydney Smith an old sinner, old sinner!” Then mounting his horse he Rides off with Count D'Orsay To call on Beau Brummel at Calais, at Calais, Where Little Bob Keeley And young D'Israeli Have opened a splendid gin-palace, gin-palace! Below stairs John Britton Is teaching a kitten To lap all the cream in the dairy, the dairy, And tells Sir John Soane That her mother is grown A profound antiquary, profound antiquary! But stay, Mrs. Hughes Will fall foul of my Muse, And call her a gipsy, and call her a gipsy; For says she, “Only look How you're spoiling the book! Why, you're certainly tipsy, certainly tipsy!” And the man in the moon, Taking snuff with a spoon, Cries, “For shame! Have some conscience, some conscience, some conscience.” So I drop my pen gaily, And challenge Haynes Bayly To write in eight stanzas more nonsense, more nonsense My Dream Absurd as it seems To talk about dreams, Many persons there are who delight in such themes; More believe in them, too, than would like to be known, For whose edification hear one of my own. Methought before dark I walked in the Park, When in run three roysterers bent on a lark,— Lord Abinger, Wallack, and Poole,—who like bucks Began pulling the shrubs up and pelting the ducks. With his wig and his mace, And a very long face, Came the Speaker, and bade them get out of the place; So they went to the Quadrant, where Louis Philippe Had just been detected in killing a sheep. As he could not find bail, He was taken to jail, But the Lord Mayor of Dublin stood there with his tail, Saying, “Take him elsewhere, for we've really no room, The last cell we had's just engaged by Lord Brougham.” Then they call'd for a cab, When a dirty-faced drab, Whom Lord Waterford said was the fairy Queen Mab, Jumped up on the dickey, and seizing the reins, Drove over Sam Rogers, and knock'd out his brains. At this terrible sight They were all in affright, And called Mr. Wakley to set matters right, Who proceeded forthwith to impanel a jury, To sit on the body, in Perkins's Brewery. Mrs. Trollope was there, And was urged to declare All she knew of this very distressing affair; But the lady was cautious, declining to mix Up herself, as she said, in so handsome a fix. Upon which Richard Shiel Swore he knew that Tom Steele Had pulled out the lynch-pin that fastened the wheel, While Archdeacon Wilberforce offered to bet The policeman a crown that the cab had upset. —But Mamma, with a wink, Says, “Really I think You're wasting a great deal of paper and ink, So finish your verses—if verses you style 'em— Or off you both go to the Hanwell Asylum!” To Mrs. Scoones. A BIRTHDAY ODE. When I was young, Full oft I've sung Gay birthday odes to birthday tunes, Nor shall my muse E'en now refuse One little stave to Mrs. Scoones. No! though Time runs, And fifty suns (Of course thirteen times fifty moons) Have made me grey, This latest lay I'll venture yet for Mrs. Scoones. In days of yore Folks rose by Four, Our mornings were their afternoons; 'Tis Twelve at best Ere I am drest, For which I am blamed by Mrs. Scoones. Up with the sun They dined at One; While we, alas! far lazier loons, Can hardly fix To dine at Six;— (The hour, I think, of Mrs. Scoones.) Thus Seven was past Ere our repast, With cloth and knives and forks and spoons, Was cleared away And I could say— “One bumper now to Mrs. Scoones!” The toast went round— “May joys abound, Long life and health—that best of boons!” Ned, Mary Anne, And chattering Fan All joined in—“God bless Mrs. Scoones!” The postman's bell, That horrid knell That frights one into fits and swoons, Had passed our door An hour before,— Too late to write to Mrs. Scoones! And Time's rude knife In middle life Fair Fancy's wings so closely prunes, One can't essay To write a lay In half an hour to Mrs. Scoones. Would wishes bear Us through the air— Ah! wishes are not air balloons— Beyond all doubt, We had set out To whisper thus to Mrs. Scoones: “May years of joy Without alloy Roll on,—the months all Mays and Junes; While Halbar, Phil, Jane, Frank, and Will Spring up like flowers round Mrs. Scoones!” A Phrenological Fragment. Oh, my head! my head! my head! Alack! for my poor unfortunate head! Mister Deville Has been to feel, And what do you think he said? He felt it up, and he felt it down, Behind the ears and across the crown, Sinciput, occiput, great and small, Bumps and organs, he tickled 'em all; And he shook his own, as he gravely said, “Sir, you really have got a most singular head! “Why here's a bump, Only feel what a lump; Why the organ of ‘Sound’ is an absolute hump! And only feel here, Why, behind each ear, There's a bump for a butcher or a bombardier; Such organs of slaughter Would spill blood like water; Such ‘lopping and topping’ of heads and of tails— Why, you'll cut up a jackass with Alderman Scales, Such destructiveness, surely, never I Saw, save in Thurtell or little Frank Jeff-e-ry!” It will do, it will do For a slashing review— Cætera desunt. Moral Reflections. Glean from the brute creation, Thou vain and haughty man! That lore thy vaunted reason Is all too weak to scan! Of virtue and of prudence Rich lessons they will grant, Thou need'st not seek thine ‘Uncle,’ Wouldst thou but heed the Ant! Thou careless, reckless idler, Who mak'st of time a mock, Observe yon thoughtful parrot Still ask thee—“What's o'clock?' Or should unkind Apollo, Fond bard, his aid refuse, Go stroke yon sleek Grimalkin— 'Tis thus thou'lt court the mews! Wouldst learn the faithful friendship That knows not to decay, Go ask yon simple shepherd, He'll smile, and point to Tray! Etc.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONGS, EPIGRAMS, Etc. The Cavalier. The Cavalier came riding As the beams of the setting sun Shed a lurid light On the field of fight— Of the fight that was lost and won. There was blood on his saddle bow, There was blood on his bridle rein, As the panting steed Relaxed his speed, At the bower of the Lady Jane. Fair Jane look'd east, fair Jane look'd west, As far as she could see, And she was aware Of a company there Fast galloping over the lea. “Oh, saw ye a horseman, lady? Oh, saw ye one ride this way, Full proud was his mien, And his scarf was of green, And his steed was a dapple grey?” “Oh, I saw no horseman pass, But a dapple grey steed came by; There was blood on his mane, There was blood on his rein, But no rider might I espy. “All travel-stain'd was that courser's side, And masterless was he, And away and away Flew that gallant dapple grey, Like the summer gale fleet and free.” They have search'd that hall and bower, They have search'd both wide and near, And the maiden's heart beat high, Though no trace could they espy Of that war-worn cavalier. Fair Jane look'd east, fair Jane look'd west, No scarf of green could she see, But she spied in the yew, Through the coppice where it grew, The blink of a bonny black e'e. “Now haste and away, Lord William, Now haste and away,” she cried, “For the bellying sail Bends low to the gale, And fair are both wind and tide.” Now hoist every sail to the breeze, And boatman ply thine oar, For a truer hearted pair Than the maid and Cavalier Never yet sail'd from shore. The Lord Warenne. “What news, what news, thou little foot page, What news, what news, come tell to me?” “I bring you news from the Lord Warenne, Fighting in a far countrie!” “What news, what news, my trusty page, What sends my noble Lord to me?” “Oh, a chaplet fair of orient pearl, He sendeth to his gay ladye.” “He wills thee wear that chaplet fair, Fall proudly on thy bonny bree; And he hath won a sparkling chain Of the good red gold right valiantlie. “Then twine it round thy snowy neck, For love of him ayont the sea; For the Soldan's daughter he hath ta'en, With all her silken braverie. “Now haste, now haste, thou trusty page, Now haste and bear me hence with glee; And for the tidings thou dost tell This jewel shall thy guerdon be!” Oh, soon across the briny main Her bark is bounding merrily, Till the Paynim Towers reflected shine On the dark blue wave of Galilee. The Lord Warenne, the Lord Warenne— Where the red-cross banner floateth free, Oh, there thou'lt find the bold Warenne, With all his Christian chivalry. The silken tent, within—without, Is richly dight and rare to see; And a lady fair reclineth there, Beneath a gorgeous canopie. Her raven locks are darkly bright; All darkly bright is her sparkling e'e, But her neck is white as the cygnet's down, The false Warenne is at her knee! Oh! then a single wail is heard— A wail as sad as sad may be, And a female form all prostrate lies Before that goodly companie! A chaplet fair entwines the hair, The spoils of farthest Arabie; But ne'er a pearl in the snowy round Is half so pale as the bonny bree! Rich, sparkling links of the good red gold, Entwine that neck of ivorie; But the death-cold chain, which none may loose, Hath bound the lovely Rosalie. On the Death of a Daughter. 'Tis o'er—in that long sigh she past— The enfranchised spirit soars at last! And now I gaze with tearless eye On what to view was agony. That panting heart is tranquil now, And heavenly calm that ruffled brow; And those pale lips, which feebly strove To force one parting smile of love, Retain it yet—soft, placid, mild, As when it graced my living child. Oh! I have watched with fondest care To see my opening floweret blow, And felt the joy which parents share, The pride which fathers only know. And I have sat the long, long night, And marked that tender flower decay; Not torn abruptly from the sight, But slowly, sadly, waste away. The spoiler came, yet paused, as though So meek a victim checked his arm, Half gave and half withheld the blow, As forced to strike, yet loth to harm. We saw that fair cheek's fading bloom The ceaseless canker-worm consume, And gazed on hopelessly; Till the mute suffering pictured there Wrung from a father's lip a prayer— O God! the prayer his child might die! Ay, from his lip—the rebel heart E'en then refused to bear its part. But the sad conflict's past—'tis o'er; That gentle bosom throbs no more! The spirit's freed;—through realms of light Faith's eagle glance pursues her flight To other worlds, to happier skies— Hope dries the tear which sorrow weepeth; No mortal sound the voice which cries, “The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.” Too Late. Too late! though flow'rets round me blow, And clearing skies shine bright and fair; Their genial warmth avails not now— Thou art not here the beam to share. Thro' many a dark and dreary day, We journey'd on 'midst grief and gloom; And now at length the cheering ray Breaks forth, it only gilds thy tomb. Our days of hope and youth are past, Our short-lived joys for ever flown; And now when Fortune smiles at last, She finds me cheerless, chilled—alone! Ah! no; too late the boon is given, Alike the frowns and smiles of Fate; The broken heart by sorrow riv'n, But murmurs now, “Too late! Too late!” A Glee Sung at the opening dinner of the Garrick Club, November, 1831. Let poets of superior parts Consign to deathless fame, The larceny of the Knave of Hearts, Who spoiled his Royal Dame. Alack! my timid muse would quail Before such thievish cubs, But plumes a joyous wing to hail Thy birth, fair Queen of Clubs! Ballad. Tune—“Oh, no! we never mention him.” They say that I am silent, and my silence they condemn, For O! although they talk to me, I never talk to them! I heed not what they think, although I know 'tis thought by some That I am dumb or deaf, but O! I'm neither deaf nor dumb! They say I'm looking sick and pale; and well indeed they may; They tell me, too, that I am sad; I'm anything but gay! They smile—but O! the more they smile, the more, alas! I sigh; And when they strive to make me laugh, I turn me round and cry! They bid me sing the song I sung, as I have sung before, The song I sung no more I sing—my singing days are o'er! They bid me play the fiddle too—my fiddle it is mute! Nor can I, as I used to do, blow tunes upon the flute! The feeling fain would soothe my woe, the heartless say I sham; The ribald mock my grief, and call me—Sentimental Sam! They cannot guess what 'tis I want—there's few indeed that can: I want— I want— I want to be a butterfly, and flutter round a fan! The Demolished Farce, OR, WHO IS THE AUTHOR? O no! we'll never mention him! We won't upon our word! “Decorum” now forbids to name An unsuccessful Bard; From Drury Lane we'll toddle to Our “office” with regret, And if they ask us, “Who's been dish'd?” We'll say that “We forget.” We'll bid him now forsake “the scene,” And try his ancient strain; He'd better “be a butterfly” Than write a farce again; 'Tis true that he can troll a song, Or tender cansonette; But if you ask us, “What beside?” Why really, we forget. And O! there are so many now, Who write good Come-dy,— There's Mister Planché, Mister Peake, And Poole, who wrote “Paul Pry.” Moncrief and Mister Buckstone join To make a funny set, With some half-dozen jokers more, Whose names we quite forget. They tell us he has got behind A bran new five-act play; They say that it is devilish droll— We heed not what they say; Perchance, indeed, 'twill struggle on A night or two, but yet, If 'tis no better than his farce, The two you'll soon forget! T. H. Bayleaf. Epitaph ON A CELEBRATED DOCTOR OF LAWS. A patriot lies beneath this mould, Through every country scouring; And when his fatal knell was toll'd, We heard the Bell of Bow-ring. Epitaph on Myself To the Editor of “The Globe and Traveller.” Sir,—I enclose you a small specimen of auto-epitaph-ography which, as a “puer ingenui vultus ingenuique pudoris,” I fear the partiality of my friends, who may conceive the memorial inadequate to my merits, may hereafter be tempted to suppress. I prefer, therefore, seeing it in my lifetime, and am Yours for the nonce, Modestus. Traveller, pause!—the gentle youth Anno (ce)tat 58.—If I live twenty years longer, this epithet must be altered.

Martial, Lib. 12, Epig. 94. (IMITATED.) You ask me, friend Jack, if from humble estate, By some strange freak of fortune, I chance to grow great, How my mind with my newly-raised rank would accord, And what sort of a man I should be as a Lord? The question's an odd one—I know not, not I, What change might take place, nor scarce how to reply. Could you tell through your own mind what fancies might pass, Were you once grown a Lion instead of an Ass? Extempore Translation The following lines were written by an eminent legal wag some time since in court, on one of his brethren of the long robe. We venture on an extempore translation: Causidicus mendaxque, loquaxque, procaxque, rapaxque, Exceptoque sagax omne quod exit in ax. Causidicus, you Pleader see, Mendax, in setting forth his plea, Loquax, in chattering to a jury, Procax, in browbeating a fury; Rapax, in grasping at his fees, Save Sagax, any ax you please; But for opinion, sound and plain, Alas! his clients ax in vain.

      <field name="fulltext">FAMILIAR EPISTLES. To Doctor Wilmot. O Doctor! wilt thou dine with me, And drive on Tuesday morning down! Can ribs of beef have charms for thee— The fat, the lean, the luscious brown? No longer dressed in silken sheen, Nor deck'd with rings and brooches rare, Say, wilt thou come in velveteen, Or corduroys that never tear? O Doctor! when thou com'st away, Wilt thou not bid John ride behind, On pony, clad in livery gay, To mark the birds our pointers find? Let him a flask of darkest green Replete with cherry brandy bear, That we may still, our toils between, That fascinating fluid share! O Doctor! canst thou aim so true, As we through briars and brambles go, To reach the partridge brown of hue, And lay the mounting pheasant low? Or should by chance, it so befall Thy path be cross'd by timid hare, Say, wilt thou for the gamebag call, And place the fur-clad victim there? And when at last the dark'ning sky Proclaims the hour of dinner near, Wilt thou repress each struggling sigh, And quit thy sport for homely cheer? The cloth withdrawn, removed the tray— Say, wilt thou, snug in elbow chair, The bottle's progress scorn to stay, But fill the fairest of the fair? To Henry Colburn, Esq., etc., etc. Colburn, I'm ill—my nerves are all unstrung— These atmospheric changes, no doubt, hurt me; I've got a bilious coating on my tongue, And I want something comic to divert me. What can you send me, Harry?—surely you And Bentley, from your Burlington depository, Can manage to despatch me something new And Liberal—you know I never was a Tory. And Whiggery's now the order of the day, “With all my heart! I won't be out of fashion;” Don't send me Mother Morgan though, I pray— Her bottled small-beer puts me in a passion, At once so pert and vapid—then those bits Of dreadful patois!—'Twere enough, my Harry, To throw a nervous body into fits To hunt them out in Boyer's dictio-nary. I thought, dear Colburn, you had been too wise To puff such things—you saw John Murray shy 'em; He offers now the old ones at half-price— I wonder who the deuce he thinks will buy 'em? Don't send me Mister Lytton Bulwer's poem, The ‘Siamese Twins,’ which the Reviews so quiz— All Satire is a bore—besides, I know him, And do not covet anything that's his.

Books produced in evidence; several of the gentlemen impannelled taken ill at their appearance; Mr. Baker's Clerk carried out in a swoon.—Corpse examined; viscera much inflamed, and brain altogether evaporated. Verdict—“Accidental death from suffocation by mephitic gas, administered in puffs by some person or persons unknown.”—A deodand of one farthing on the volumes.) To R. H. D. Barham. St. Paul's, July 5, 1830. I find, Mister Dick, That you've played me a trick, For which you deserve a reproof— Not to say a reproach; You got out of the coach, And settled yourself on the roof. You knew you'd a cough, And when you set off, I cautioned you as to your ride, And bade you take care Of the damp and cold air, And above all to keep withinside. This they tell me that you Did not choose to do, But exchanged with some person, they said; And so Easton mistook Your name in his book, And charged you what he should have paid. I found them quite willing To refund every shilling, And render to Cæsar his due; They gave me back three, Which I take to be The overplus forked out by you. Now don't do this again; Indeed, to be plain, If you mount, when you come back to town, Your namesake the ‘Dicky,’ I shall certainly lick ye, And perhaps half demolish your crown. Mamma means to enclose Two white ‘wipes’ for your nose; As your purse may be run rather hard, I shall also attack her To augment your exchequer With a sovereign stuck in a card. But my note I must end it, Or 'twill be too late to send it To-day, which I much wish to do; So remember us, mind, enough To our friends who are kind enough To be bored with such a nuisance as you. Write as soon as you can, That's a good little man, And direct your epistle to me; Meanwhile, I remain, Till I see you again, Your affectionate sire,—R. H. B. To Master Edward Barham (Ætat. 8.) August 17, 1836. My dear little Ned, As I fear you have read All the books that you have, from great A down to Z, And your aunt, too, has said That you're very well bred, And don't scream and yell fit to waken the dead, I think that instead Of that vile gingerbread With which little boys, I know, like to be fed. (Though lying like lead On the stomach, the head Gets affected, of which most mammas have a dread) I shall rather be led Before you to spread These two little volumes—one blue and one red. As three shillings have fled, From my pocket, dear Ned, Don't dog's-ear nor dirt them, nor read them in bed. Your affectionate Father, R. H. B. To T. Ryde, Esq. WITH A PRESENT OF BLACK CLOTH. My dear Mr. Ryde, The cloth I confide To your messenger tried, Safe sealed up and tied. It can't be denied That though rough it's well dyed, And sufficiently wide (Or my tailor has lied) To cover your hide From ancle to side. If you're going to ride, Or this winter decide Upon learning to slide On the Thames or the Clyde— A thing I always shied, And could never “abide,” From motives allied To a feeling of pride, As too undignified— On the ice ere you glide, Such smallclothes provide As fit well in the stride. The cloth, says my bride, Ere the needle is plied, Should be damped and then dried; And when thus purified They'll be jet black, not pied. In this I coincide. Adieu, my dear Ryde, All good fortune betide Yourself, my good friend, and your breeches beside. A Friendly Remonstrance. ADDRESSED TO THE EDITORS, ETC., OF ‘THE GLOBE.’ June 24th, 1837. My dear Mr. Moran, Although in the Koran, Mohammed, prohibiting wine, Says people should get Lemonade and sherbet, Such talking is all very fine; And the system may work Very well with a Turk, A Moor, a Mogul, or a Persian; But John Bull, you must own, For spring water alone Entertains an especial aversion. What the deuce are you at? Does the ‘Globe’ mean to rat From its principles—Port and October? It had better turn Tory At once, like “old Glory,” Than grow so confoundedly sober. Who cares for the potter Of Lettsom and Trotter? Astley Cooper's grown blinder than Cupid. As to Bacher, I guess He's an ass, and U. S. I suppose means “Uncommonly stupid!” I've heard Colonel Torrens Express his abhorrence Of milksops, and often upon 'em he Things severer has said Than ever I read In political tracts of economy. And surely the Captain Won't think of adapting His taste to these teetotal fancies, Or say the pure element Is for the belly meant, Unless when it mixed with right Nantz is. If once your good Editor Turns to a bread-eater, Moistening his crust with cool waters, All the fire in his leaders Is quench'd, and his readers Will swear they're a Dairyman's Daughter's. If you make Mr. Chapman A gruel and pap-man, At once you destroy all the pleasure he Now takes in beholding The silver and gold in The iron safe forming your treasury. Methinks Mr. Eaves, As he locks up and leaves, For his skinful of grog stoutly stickles; And I hear honest Joe Exclaim, “This is no go!” As he bolts to his friend Colonel Nichols. Mr. Barnard won't stay, Without wetting his clay Now and then with a taste of cool “swipes,” And I am sure Mr. Harvey Will send for a jarvey And “brush” with his galleys and types. I admit drinking gin Is a shame and a sin, It bemuddles and don't make one frisky; But think of the scorn Which an Irishman born Deserves who talks scandal of whisky! Then pray, Mr. Moran, Don't think of encoring Such paragraphs: prithee stand neuter; Or if drams you cut short, Speak civil of port, And allow us a pull at the pewter. To Doctor Hume. St. P. C. Y., November 4, 1837. Doctor dear! the Queen's a-coming! All this ancient city round, Scarce a place to squeeze one's thumb in, High or low, can now be found; So my spouse—you'll hardly thank her— Thus in substance bids me say: “Bring your sweet self to an anchor, Doctor dear, with us that day!” If no haunch your palate tickles, If no turtle greet your eye, There'll be cold roast beef and pickles, Ox-tail soup, and pigeon-pie. Fear not then the knaves who fleece men— Johnny Raws, and country muffs! There'll be lots of new policemen To control the rogues and roughs. Doctor, darling! think how grand is Such a sight! the great Lord May'r, Heading all the city dandies, There on horseback takes the air! Chains and maces all attend, he Rides all glorious to be seen; “Lad o' wax!” great heaven forfend he Don't get spilt before the Queen! Blue-coat boys with classic speeches— From our windows you shall view Their yellow stockings, yellow breeches, And “long togs” of deepest blue. Here the cutlers,—there the nailers, Here the barber-surgeons stand,— Goldsmiths here—there merchant tailors, And in front the Coldstream Band! Gas-lights, links, and flambeaux blazing, These will shame the noon-tide ray; “Night!—pooh!—stuff! 'tis quite amazing! Why 'tis brighter far than day!” But a scene so brilliant mocks all Power its beauties to declare; Once beheld, poor Gye of Vauxhall Hangs himself in deep despair! Come then, Doctor, quit your shrubbery, Cock your castor o'er your ear; Come and gaze, and taste the grubbery, Ah, now join us, Doctor dear! R. H. B. To Miss Barham. August 15, 1841. My dear little Fanny,—I take up my pen Just to say that we set off on Monday, at ten, By the Magnet to Margate, and call on the way At a place which I think you remember, Herne Bay; For there, if I recollect rightly, the guide, Betsy Homersham, sous'd you so much that you cried. We've not yet engaged any lodgings; the Halls, Who have been there some time, and live close to St. Paul's, Assure us, however, we shan't have much trouble In suiting a number like ours, or e'en double. But then you'll observe, since as yet we don't know To what part of the town we may happen to go, And cannot decide till at least we so far get, You had better direct to us, “Post Office, Margate,” A mode of arrangement for want of a better Which I mean to adopt in the case of each letter. I sent down a salmon to-day, and I hope That it will not discredit the fishmonger, Pope, But I deeply regret things should turn out so cross That I could not procure one poor lobster for sauce; But somehow or other so few had come in, Pope had not a single one, neither had Lynn; So be sure, my dear Fanny, you make my excuses, And mind and write soon and let's know what the news is; Your mammy will write to you soon, and your bird Sings so loud and so long, it is really absurd; Mary Anne's grown quite fond of the creature, indeed She does nothing but stuff it with sugar and seed. I really don't think I have aught more to tell, And the postman below is come ringing his bell, So God bless you, my dear, I shall now say “Farewell.” Write to one of us soon—if you ask me, I'd rather You'd address, of the two,—Your affectionate Father. R. H. B. To Richard Bentley, Esq. December 21, 1841. Dear Bentley,— “Nell Cook” is ripe, And up in type,— So Bangor Printed at Bangor House. boys repeat; And “Colin Clink” Is daubed with ink, Down to a single sheet. Poor Tom Hill's dead, And it is said His heir is E. Dubois. Tom kept an infernal Sort of a journal Of all he heard and saw— I think if you Mind P and Q, You may get hold of the Diary; Dubois could well Make a book that would sell; At least, it's worth inquiry. And if your mind That way's inclin'd, I could put you into a way To get at Dubois Through his brother-in-law, So respond without delay. Thine, R. H. B. To Dr. Hume. April, 1842. Diffugere nives, redeunt jam gramina campis, The snows are fled, the grass now scarcely damp is; Solvitur acris Hyems gratâ vice Veris; Stern Winter's gone, the grateful Spring-time near is; Ubi gentium Hume? Is he up in his room? Vel antro sub grato “'Ating potato”? In agris est vix A making of bricks? Cur non venit ad urbem, Now there's nothing to disturb him— Usque ad Londinum, Churchyardque Paulinum? Nil mihi rescribas sed venias ipse Quadrigâ vel omnibus, sobrius vel tipse. R. H. B. To the Garrick Club. Clifton, May, 1845. Ye shepherds give ear to my lay, Who have nothing to do about sheep, While, as Shenstone, the poet, would say,— I have nothing to do but to weep. For here I sit all the day long, And must do so, I dare say, all June, While so far from singing a song, I can't even whistle a tune. For the probang, the blister, and leech, So completely my notes have o'erthrown, When I try the sweet music of speech, I start at the sound of my own. It's useless attempting to speak, For my voice is beyond my control; If high, it's an ear-piercing squeak, If low, it's a grunt or a growl! Can Clifton those beauties assume, Which patients have found in her face, When shut up all day in a room, One can't get a peep at the place? Ye Garrickers, making your sport, As ye revel in gossip and grub, Oh! send some endearing report Of how matters go on at the Club. When I think on the rapid mail train, In a moment I seem to be there, But the sight of N.E. on the vane Soon hurries me back to despair. The Committee, O say do they send A blessing—or ban—after me? Mr. Gwilt, does he duly attend To his salad and little roti? Davy Roberts, that glorious R. A., Does he still smoke his hookha in peace? Is Millingen there every day? Is Mills a trustee to the lease? Does the claret suit Thornton? and how Does Lord Tenterden like the cigars? Has anyone yet in a row Kicked impudent ? downstairs? For methought that a sweet little bird In my ear of its likelihood sung, And I loved it the more when I heard Such tenderness fall from its tongue. O, say is the story a hoax, Or one to be classed among fibs, That Murphy's upset with his jokes Colonel Sibthorpe, and broken his ribs? Has Durant got rid of his cough? Are Sav'ry's rheumatics quite gone? And how do the dinners go off, And how does the ballot go on? Does Stanhope's good humour endure? What are White and Sir Henry about? Is Talfourd gone up to his tour, Or Arden gone down to his trout? Does Calcraft, who saved us from blazing, Still watch o'er our int'rests at night? Does Ovey still drive up his chaise in? Is Rainy as ever polite? Charles Kemble, his nose is it aching As yet from his fall, or got well? Has Harley decided on making Miss ? a church-going belle? Is Titmarsh on anything clever, Or bent on returning to France? Is Planché as bustling as ever, Avowedly going to Dance? Say where—but ah me! wherefore ask When there's none to reply or to care, And Echo herself scorns the task Of answering gloomily “Where?” But Fladgate will write, or George Raymond,— His muse will not surely decline For one moment to turn from the gay monde, And sympathize sadly with mine. Perhaps you'll consider it silly To end with a rascally pun, But as I have thus done my billet, O, send me back one billet done! An allusion to Mr. William ? more commonly called Billy ? Dunn, Treasurer of Drury Lane Theatre. The Radiant Boy. A FRAGMENT. “That pretty little boy, Mamma, That stands behind the tree, Do let him come indoors, Mamma, And bid him play with me. “Papa is busy now, Mamma, And sister is away, Oh! bid that little boy come in, That we may go and play.” “What little boy? thou silly child, No little boy I see:”— “Oh! there he stands upon the lawn, And weeps beneath the tree; “He will not come and play, Mamma, I show him every toy; I bid him come, but still he weeps; Is he a naughty boy?” “Why what is this, Tom Ingoldsby, My child, what may it mean? I look upon the lawn, but there No little boy is seen; “The linden tree is straight and tall, Its leaves are fresh and fair, But there's no little boy at all— No pretty boy is there.” “Now nay, now nay, my mother dear, He stands beside the tree; He weeps, he sheds full many a tear, Yet still he looks on me. “Full many a time and oft, Mamma, I've asked him day by day, But there he always stands and weeps— He will not come and play. “What makes him look so pale, Mamma? Why is he weeping so? There—now at once he's gone away! I did not see him go: “He went not down the gravel walk, He did not cross the lawn, And yet he's gone away at once;— Mamma, where is he gone?” “You little monkey, are you mad?” The mother smiling said; But her voice had something lost its tone, And her cheek a little red. She look'd adown the gravel walk, And across the grass-green sod; Of course she'd no belief in Ghosts, But she thought it rather odd. “Go in,” quoth she, “thou silly child— Go in, and mind your toys, And do not talk such stuff to me Of pretty little boys.” “Papa! papa! he's there again— He's come again to-day! See, there he stands!—do make him stop, And bid him come and play. “Mamma was angry yesterday, She said it was not true, But see! he's there again, Papa, Now you can see him too! “I love this fine old house, Papa, I like its large old hall; It is so very nice a place For us to play at ball. “Yes! we've been here now half a year, And yet, though day by day I've ask'd him, he will not come in, All I can do or say.” The Bulletin. 9, Dowry Square, Hot-wells, May 29, 1845. Hark!—the doctors come again, Knock—and enter doctors twain— Dr. Keeler, Dr. Blane:— “Well, sir, how Go matters now? Please your tongue put out again!” Meanwhile, t'other side the bed, Doctor Keeler Is a feeler Of my wrist, and shakes his head:— “Rather low, we're rather low!” (Deuce is in't, an 'twere not so! Arrowroot, and toast-and-water, Being all my nursing daughter, By their order, now allows me; If I hint at more she rows me, Or at best will let me soak a Crust of bread in tapioca.) “Cool and moist though, let me see, Seventy-two, or seventy-three, Seventy-four, perhaps, or so; Rather low, we're rather low! Now, what sort of night, sir, eh? Did you take the mixture, pray? Iodine and anodyne, Ipecacuanha wine, And the draught and pills at nine?” PATIENT (loquitur). “Coughing, doctor, coughing, sneezing, Wheezing, teazing, most unpleasing, Till at length I, by degrees, in- Duced ‘Tired nature's sweet restorer,’ Sleep, to cast her mantle o'er her Poor unfortunate adorer, And became at last a snorer. Iodine and anodyne, Ipecacuanha wine, Nor the draughts did I decline; But those horrid pills at nine! Those I did not try to swallow, Doctor, they'd have beat me hollow. I as soon Could gulp the moon, Or the great Nassau balloon, Or a ball for horse or hound, or Bullet for an eighteen-pounder.” DOCTOR K. “Well, sir— well, sir—we'll arrange it, If you can't take pills, we'll change it; Take, we'll say, A powder grey, All the same to us which way; Each will do; But, sir, you Must perspire whate'er you do. (Sudorific comes from sudo!) Very odd, sir, how our wills Interfere with taking pills! I've a patient, sir, a lady Whom I've told you of already, She'll take potions, She'll take lotions, She'll take drugs, and draughts by oceans; She'll take rhubarb, senna, rue; She'll take powders grey and blue, Tinctures, mixtures, linctures, squills, But, sir, she will not take pills! Now the throat, sir, how's the throat?” PATIENT. “Why, I can't produce a note! I can't sound one word, I think, whole, But they hobble, And they gobble, Just like soapsuds down a sink-hole, Or I whisper like the breeze, Softly sighing through the trees!” DOCTOR. “Well, sir—well, sir—never mind, sir, We'll put all to rights you'll find, sir, Make no speeches, Get some leeches; You'll find twenty Will be plenty, Clap them on, and let them lie On the pomum Adami; Let them well the trachea drain, And your larynx, And your pharynx— Please put out your tongue again! Now the blister! Ay, the blister! Let your son, or else his sister, Warm it well, then clap it here, sir, All across from ear to ear, sir; That suffices, When it rises, Snip it, sir, and then your throat on Rub a little oil of Croton: Never mind a little pain! Please put out your tongue again! “Now, sir, I must down your maw stick This small sponge of lunar caustic, Never mind, sir, You'll not find, sir, I the sponge shall leave behind, sir, Or the probang make you sick, sir, I shall draw it back so quick, sir; This I call my prime elixir! How, sir! choking? Pooh! you're joking— Bless me! this is quite provoking! What can make you, sir, so wheezy? Stay, sir!—gently!—take it easy! There, sir, that will do to-day. Sir, I think that we may say We are better, doctor, eh? Don't you think so, Doctor Blane? Please put out your tongue again! Iodine and anodyne, Ipecacuanha wine, And since you the pills decline, Draught and powder grey at nine. There, sir! there, sir! now good day, I've a lady 'cross the way, I must see without delay!” [Exeunt Doctors.] THE END.</field>
