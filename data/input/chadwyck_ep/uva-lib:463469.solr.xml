      <field name="fulltext">[Bodl. MS. Mal. 14:] On ascension Day. Today white Saincts &amp; holy angells sing To that pure lambe, some new trivmphant thing Wherat the whole frame of the world ascends Each bird on wings acrosse his iourney bends Vpright, &amp; from the most exalted twist His voice p[r]oclaims his ioys aboue consist Earth swells to rise, &amp; heav's hir issue faire In swift perfumes to latch the mounting ayre Rise then my soule. &amp; every powre awake Can walls of dust so strong resistance make? Loe! thy Redeemer that braue Aegle flies With cage &amp; all, breaking the marble skies His way to climbe was first to be deprest Lay then his bloudie crosse vpon thy brest Which will be such a loade as birds wings are To beare thee where. his pleading wounds prepare A crowne of glorie, made by conquest thine Was his by nature: where he will refine Thee &amp; thy Case of Clay bright as his owne When ioind in blisse you both ascend one throne. Verses on a bible presented to the Lady K C. This world is gods large booke wherin we learne Him in his glasse of wonders to discerne But since the print was darke and we synnblind His word became the Mirrhour of his mind, And as the eternall father on the sonne His forme engrau'd, before all worlds begun So what he is, what god in him, to vs The spirit of both, does in this booke discusse Cleare Spring of wisedome! Truths eternall mine! The whole a Temple, &amp; each leafe a shrine, And as on clouds, on mountains, and on streams, The sunne letts beautie fall in golden beams But with his owne pure light the starrs inspires And through their bodies thrusts his liuing fires So other holy books can but reflect Those rays which here are natiue &amp; direct Which apt to dazle &amp; confound the wise Are yet a gentle light to childrens eyes And you bright mayd (whose name if I rehearse I shall a Rubricke make and not a verse, And were such gold found in Italian mines They would haue twentie new S? Katherines) As litle ones in gardens take delight, Here gather fruicts for taste &amp; flow'rs for sight The flow'r of Iesse, that fresh and lasting rose The fruict of knowledge, and of life here grows; On babes as tender Virgins loue to looke Behold that blessed babe within this booke Pure faire &amp; deckt in roabs of white &amp; redd A crowne of radiant starrs about his head; If you be sicke, if head or heart shall ake To Ihesus name turne &amp; the paine will slake Read it when first you rise &amp; gone to bedd Vnder your pillow let it bear your head All books in one all learning lies in this This your first ABC, and best Primer is Whence hauing throughly learnt the [Chris]tcrosse row You may with comfort to Our Father goe Who will you to that highest lesson bring Which Seraphins instruct his saincts to sing. On that noble gentleman M? H. Hast: losing his eye Great God, that art all Eye! who first gaue sight To the darke Chäos, yeilding noe delight To thee the double parent, while it lay So deepe in night; that nothing yet was day Wherin nought pleasd thine eye that blindly stood But when it saw thou saw'st it all was good; Thou whose eternall essence, house, and roabe, Are all one light one boundlesse Chrystall globe Father of lights whose sonne is from on high The Dayspring, and whose spirit an inward eye Which through the worlds wide Engine moues &amp; roules But dwells in vs illumining our souls To search and find that whole and only blisse Which of all three in one the vision is; Thou whose blest hands our bodies beauteous frame Shooke out of dust; and balls of liuing flame Fix'd in our fronts erect and when they fade Farre brighter shall by thy last worke be made Thou dreadfull Potter! may thine humble clay Aske if deformities or Darknesse may Be pleasing in thy sight; or why we find So many borne, so many stricken blind Troops of diseases, change of chance to marre Thy worke &amp; leave a cloud wher was a starre If Syn still made thy wrath thus heavy fall Alasse! thou mighst raine darkenesse on vs all; If sinns excesse, their pride that haue their eyes Wou'd all exceed; for they wou'd all despise. What on sinns slaues as bitter plague is thrown Like Manna falls &amp; mercie to thine owne; The Sodomites were blind, so Toby was, This fell on Paul, as well as Elymas, And to thy booke: thy glasse, when we repayre Where as all scruples, all Solucions are That blind borne man so pos'd &amp; quarrelld there His parents too, by thine owne doome are cleare And opening his thou giu'st vs eyes to see That natures blemish may thy glorie bee So canst thou blend theise things &amp; make vs wealth Of povertie, and of a sicknesse health Want teaches plenties vse, were night away We shou'd grow wanton weary of the day Blows, bruises, blindnesse ere thy work be done May into medcine, balme and eyesalue runne Yet in ripe time those scales fell from S? Paule And Toby's sight grew in a fishes gall Of thy prescribing, which his sonne convayd As thine Apothecarie, readie made So Lord prescribe, prepare, direct &amp; blesse Th'appliances, watch over every dresse Of this thine humble servant, till his soule Be full reioic'd to find his body whole; And through those casements thou so faire didst glaze Salute the light and thee theire maker praise Thou that through darknesse see'st downe to my reins And knowst how close this griefe my heart constrains How this blow strikes mine eyes still that to weepe I find them apter then to looke or sleepe. Thou knowst the muse was noe fantastick fitt Brought forth this verse: I am not sick of witt But theise disorder'd words like Annaes deepe Fetchd from my soule in lowly murmure creepe Vp to thy throne of Grace—. . —The rest is lost. Prayr &amp; Praise. To worke strong lines &amp; wreath a crowne of bays For Iesus brows; take fervent Prayr &amp; Praise That runns &amp; flows, &amp; bears a deeper sence Then winding verse or ratling eloquence. It rises first and breaks from hearts of stone (But not till Aarons rod be struck theron) Cleft with remorse; then climbs through weeping eyes With siluer feet transcending farre the skies To wash his feet whose purpled dropps diuine Will turne this water into Angells wine This made of words which are but vapour pent In forge of flesh, by panting bellows sent To mixe with mother Ayre, yet this to mee Shall both a blessing and an honour bee (Sais god) who calls those things as if they weare Which are not soe, or doe not so appeare To vs. &amp; looke how sweet it strikes the sence When vernall winds inspire their influence On flowrie meads; so thanks like incense rise And heaven takes praise as perfum'd sacrifice. On the Sacrament. Lord to thy flesh &amp; bloud when I repayre Where dreadfull ioys &amp; pleasing tremblings are Then most I rellish, most it does me good When my soule faints &amp; pynes &amp; dies for food. Did my synns murther thee? to make that playne Thy peircd dead-liuing bodie bleeds againe. Flow sadd sweet dropps what diff'ring things you doo Reueale my synns; &amp; seale my pardon too. ELEGIES Epistles Epigramms, etc. 1. Elegie on the noble Eliz: Countesse of Hunt Vntimely muse what art thou tempring here Regardlesse of thy weaknesse &amp; my feare? Darst thou resume a lustie conque'ring rage Cross-wrinkled now both with contempt &amp; age? Alas thy Mercurie and subtile flame Is fixt and quencht; &amp; my sepulchred name Appearing on hir venerable Herse (Tho washt in tears, &amp; wrapt in sheets of verse) Wou'd hydeous seeme to all the race that came From royall veynes of this Heroick Dame: And him offend, whose bloud with hirs entwines A double twist of two most princely lines. Or if it not displease, it yet will showe A vile attempt to lay hir name so lowe To wind hir Glories vp hir Graces tie In theise rough knotts of ragged poetry. Call Godlike Sydney from Elizian shade (So might a noble Epitaph be made) Then let the gentle Beaumont rise, &amp; he Of whom all poëts hold in Capite Black prince of witts, y? most illustrious Dunn To make new Seas of praise that vpwards runn Not like th'old Ocean in Earths durtie holes, To thwart the Zodiak &amp; new-belt the poles, Wheron for Mermayds let bright Angells sing To hir renowne some new trivmphant thing Which Careys glad muse (for he still surviues And holds a lease of glorie for 4 lifes) In copie fair will soone deriue from thence (For she with heaven holds Intelligence.) And Ioyning to the Quyre aboue hir voice Make all good Soules in heauen &amp; earth reioice To which my heart (Hell cannot this confute) Is consonant although my tongue be mute. A second Elegie on the same. [Eliz: Countesse of Hunt] I first was dead, now this glad vantage haue Thus first to rise and walke about hir graue In a white sheet, &amp; bearing in this hand A scourge of steele, in this a flaming brand Which apparition, frights to quick retyre All sinfull offrer's off vnhallowed fire Stopps wide dull nostrills that wou'd here presume To shedd low rimes, in lamentable rheume: Restrain's their Pleiades of froth that fall An extreame vnction after funerall, Whose shortliu'd lines are lost infinities Each single word innumerable is Go shoot at common birds with easie bolts Runn your rough verses wheele which iumps &amp; iolts Ore wombs of Aldermen outfac'd in brasse With here he lies, &amp; iust so old he was: But this glad monument wherin she sitts The crowned Queene of witt &amp; worth, admitts No tongue but such as can the language speake To melt mens eyes &amp; womens hearts to breake In generall thaw, &amp; in the whole land flood Streaming from all that are or great or good. O're which all learned fancies high may sitt Episcopall, vpon an arch of witt. This is my taske, for this abroad I creep Awhile, &amp; then returne to former sleepe In graue obscur'd, which ere I will essay Once more I crie, Be all prophane away! Hence, paddock pöets! you whose greivous qualme Croaks in harsh t[o]nes, &amp; flings out slime for balme Leave vaine assaults, This liquid Amber sweet Defile not with vnwarrantable feet, A snapping Ioviall tyrant storke is here In watchfull lines, to keep this water cleare Theise pure fresh springs (yet world of bitter brine) This confluence of eyes &amp; hearts is mine. My In-land sea, wher noise of roring waves The horrid clamour of the clouds out-braves (Would I but charge with all my troops) that howre When they the hurricano downe do powre, In peales of ratling clapps: so drowning all Those aerie drumms in this one water-fall. And wher ioind mourners sighs would fain outspeak Shrill Tritons shell: the stiffe Norths trumpett breake. But I compose a brim-full sea of balme From melting pearle preserv'd in lasting calme Which to fullfill, behold my beach is crown'd With thousand Goddesses &amp; Nymphs around Who when the longing sunn (who may not here) Water his steeds, nor in his coach draw neare) Vnbrac'd, his head in Lawrell bound, will supp Vpon this Nectar, straightways make it vpp. While some dissolu'd in tears; their forms forsake And with new Chrystall rocks, a margine make. Vpon transparent bosome of this deepe No slimie fish, nor fowle defiling keepe. But choicest swanns from Thames &amp; neighbouring Trent Shall flockmeale come, when youthfull days are spent. And by my Charms, assuming humane voice Clapp all their quills together &amp; reioice To sing their best, their last, &amp; only breath In trebling faire &amp; sweete Elizabeth Which name from seas to seas, from hills to hills Flies in all aiers, &amp; every region fills While hir now spatious soule is gladly plac'd Near hirs that late this kingdome rule'd &amp; grac'd The next throne emptie, for one liuing yet Beyond sea, far beyond my sea of witt. Epitaph on M? Hildersam 1632. Whose fervent praire, cold hearers bosoms warm'd Whose sharpe sweet strains our deafest passion charmd From whose bright presence darke prophane[r]s fled Wise, holy, Noble, Hildersam is dead Ashbie thy lampe is quencht &amp; thou art madd At heart, or else at heart thou wilt be sadd Wher will you runne to find a font so pure That could so full &amp; still so fresh endure Can that fair Orbe whence radiant fire he threw With glow-wormes fill, or candlerush renew? Yet all his learning was but as a limme To the maine body, as a peice of him; Father &amp; founder to the poor he was The layman's counsellour, the Clergies glasse His high blood swell'd him not; in wealth of witt Excelling, he as trifles rated it. And from full store of tryalls I may spend This surplusage; He was a faithfull Frend. His life a woven roabe, without a seame His heavenly temper an eternall theme For tongues &amp; penns, but his immortall mind Raignes with Eliah. in a throne designd Twixt him &amp; Esay, Harke Cœlestiall Quires Prophets, Apostles, strike their Ivorie lyres And peales of ioy resound on golden strings While Seraphins doe clapp their silver wings. Elegie on the truly noble Katherine Countesse of Chesterfeild. 1636 You little madd Philip &amp; Cheyney youths That lie most when you vtter most In-truths To whom rime smells ranke Popery &amp; to whom Papers of verses are all raggs of Rome Who when roasting &amp; crackling bout the throat Instruction wheezeth from you piping hote Whose whining pigg-voice fayning quack or pose Quavers out indignation through the nose Make doctrines flush, and long-billd reasons sing A Covëe then of vselesse vses spring; And crie marke, marke, as if some Buzzard were To flie the retriue of whats scatterd there Shrowd not in prose and Rhume this noble Herse Nor Silly Samson though in printed verse PRophane or touch hir glad enamour'd sheet With his affrighting and defiling feet.

Poor lines if ere you fortunately stand Opposd to purer eyes in that pure hand To which I send you; plentifull accesse You soon shall fin[d], of wealth and noblenesse This sad dull inke will sparkle then &amp; shine Each word fall soft, &amp; smooth run every line And you tho meanly borne, shall seeme the straine And issue of some witts or Poëts braine Sure it is syn in him that not envies That loftie blisse to which you then shall rise. For she will hold you when she goes to rest Within a handfull of hir heavenly brest. And tho she knows all ready what you meane Will haue a mind to read you ôre againe. And tis a wonder if in all that while She doe not in despight of sorrow smile Once, as the brave sunn hurls his flaming eye Through clouds swolne bigg with a moyst tympany Tho at that instant on hir face appears Hanging like pearles a payre of shining tears Which balme droppt on you, will great virtues add So precious blotts no verses ever hadd. Then she contemplates &amp; she prayes withall The Graces then, and heavens angells fall Thick on her bosome, &amp; about hir bedd, And holy deawes on hir &amp; yow are shedd Comes slumber then, &amp; you by hir are sett Amongst hir best things in hir Cabinett, But thus while you to blisse &amp; high estate Are lifted, I lie here disconsolate. For what glad thing is left vs since shees gone But our good Angell &amp; hir Huntingdon Save that bright starre which yet is fixt so high I cannot thither throwe my feeble eye Nought here is to be seen, worth looking on But merchandize fitt for king Solomon Who had a navie which appointed were To fetch him apes &amp; peacocks every yeare. This clime is desert, we the Phœnix misse And Twicknam now Arabia foelix is. Yet wou'd not this my patience so much breake As that I am constraind to hear them speake Hard writhen words intended eloquence Six Criticks wedges would not cleiue the sence With theise tis persecution to conferre True Purgatorie barrd from heaven &amp; hir Whose speech, whose faire aspect, whose every glance Did thaw away some peice of ignorance. Thence my cold muse &amp; braine of Ice, for prose merely ordain'd resolu'd in numbers flows, Which if hir deare remembrance I refraine would freeze I feare, to stubborne prose againe But that I'le ne're doe; since the very thought of hir hath with it much new learning brought First I perceiue by that faire Soule of hers The follie of two great Philosophers. Thales thought all our soules of water were And Anaximenes imagind aier That hirs is neither now remains no doubt She must by this haue sigh'd or wept it out. Next by hir fame, which still doth freshly last Spight of the devill or mans malicious blast I see that virtue may be built so strong And Right, that rumour can not sett it wrong Last by the thought of hir estate, I find How full of froath &amp; emptinesse &amp; wind Is their content who haue reposed it In wealth, or bloud, in beautie, youth, or witt. For of all theise things heaven had lent such store They can not be hir frends that wish hir more Yet to full blisse I see she something seeks Witnesse these water wracks vpon hir cheekes Which she shall find in heaven tho here she misse [And crowne those waterie eyes, wth wyne of Blisse] To M? Clifton. To me whom lords &amp; ladies often teach To looke for iust &amp; seasonable breach Of swelling promises, It was no news That so profest a visitt you refuse; The rich and poor are differenc'd in this We must, but you must not keepe promises. Nor did you single now fall off, but drew Along that Angell which is double you Shee that is fair clean through, in soule &amp; face Whose conversation is next good to grace Whose heavenly apparition wher it comes In lowly Cottage, glads &amp; gilds the rooms Is it not hell while thus our hopes you crosse And we condemnd to paine of sence &amp; losse One while hott rage for missing your repaire Torments, anone we freeze in cold dispayre May we not be redeemd? You haue heard tell One gentle Pope fetcht Traianes soule from hell By suffring paine in his owne feet, alas You may goe lesse: let but your palfrays passe Our gravell ways, which if they straine to doe Youle saue in soules, what they can loose in shooe. To M? Clifton with M? Fr: Beaumounts Verses on the Count: of Rutland Theise striking pleasing beams Fra: Beaumont threw On noble Sydneys herse, reflect on you My noble frend, whose touch I wonder how Or that could scape, or you forbear till now For your most knowing spirit is of kinn To all best witts that are or ere haue been Apollo, Hermes, every muse &amp; grace Smiling on Cliftons as on Beaumonts race And would you not attract such things of force [To you must flie, or flowe by Natures course] As one smooth gentle flood another takes (disdaining fellowship with ponds or lakes) And with their siluer armes embracing grow Till two to one, both names &amp; natures goe. So those rich soules of pure Promethean strain Haue mutuall rellish each of others veine, Prove it, and runne your fluent stile by this Twill mixe, and we may call it yours or his, In such an hope my feebler spring hir hands Vplifts, for helpe, to passe theise barren sands And find at length, a fairer way to meet Your streams of worth, &amp; witt, so full, so sweet Then foule &amp; puddle witts y? striue in vaine My cleare &amp; natiue simplenesse to staine Will all runne vnder ground, and mingling well With Stix &amp; Acheron, be fitt for hell. To the Lady Visc: Beaumount: at Burton Madame; or sure your soule is masculine Or else we must their heresie decline That tell vs of an incapacitie In any soule, for virtue thats a shee. For all that doe Converse with yours, do find, All virtues there that can be in a mind; And for that reason, well you can not looke To haue me count them; for then I mistooke In saying you haue all, since those alone Loue &amp; expect such reckonings as haue none. Yet I confesse there is a deaw distills (As bees make balme of flowers) from learned quills Vsefull and apt for every noble Dame That striues to make the best conserve of fame. The peoples voice is a thinne broth of breath A food too faint to nourish after death But Ioues Immortall Nectar is for those Whom verse exalts beyond the reach of prose And pardon me if I contend to raise To such a seemly height your virtues praise (For yet my muse a bare intention hath Because my knowledge is implicite faith) And make men know them, which tho now they doe Yet then shall know that I doe know them too. To a yong lord at Court 1623. To say to you good Lord, I may refraine Doubting it were to take that name in vaine Because at Court you build high roofs of Fame But lay noe ground of good to bear the frame But when your temper, innocencie, truth (Now famous all) I balance with your youth I can not thinke it sinne or flatterie then To write you in the roule of honest men: And hurle my vow that once we may behold A great man young remaine a good man old. Let Envie barke: is it a fault assoone To crie god saue it as we see the moone Worke from a cloud? or virtue break like day, And cut through mists a clear &amp; open way.? When Lucifer their prince like lightning fell A cloud of spirits shott from heaven to hell; Yet our beleife is Catholike, that some Are perfect and possesse the glorious roome Wherin at first the all disposing hand Them plac'd so sure, they shall for ever stand The floud of water &amp; the storme of fire At Sodome, made iust Lott &amp; Noah retyre But neither perisht, both in safety stood This on his hill that on his horse of wood. And tis decreed in that darke booke of Fate Some that rise early shall continue late And such a strength of noble spirits haue To bear fresh honour lasting to the graue And such may you (I sing) Example shine Your virtues you while I your praise refine So you in perfect health may well deride Med'cines &amp; druggs men for the sick provide So like a tall ship may you ride the waues Of swelling Envie, &amp; repulse the braves Of windy rumour made of spightfull breath Till that glad port you gaine of life by death. To my neighbour R B. Archd: of Nott: now D of Sarum Lett me enioy you, for I faine would know If still you looke like one of vs or noe Is not your former pleasing forme off-stript Since when your worship was Archdeaconshipt Quakes not your headpeice with in-gotten wind Or swells &amp; bursts your nightcaps all behind.? Or are you to the velvet day-caps come As fits Episcopabilissimum? Rise not your brows in billows apt to drowne Poor Tom beneath, with an impetuouse frowne? Burne your disdainfull eyes, or sweetly moue (As earst) and gently shine on those you loue? Is not your nose suspended, or awrie, And since twas Archt exalts it selfe on high.? Blesse me! what dainty proper men of late By wealths convulsion or a pang of state, Haue I seen changd (as once by Cyrces cupp) And to a beastly figure quite runne vp? Poor Cambridge snakes that vs'd to creepe and lick The bubling spume of my then Rhetorick And cling in amorous folds my verse to heare Verse that at once could please &amp; keep in feare; Now fiery flying Dragon Doctors are That warm'd with prebends and fatt Steeples dare Both hisse &amp; sting; for me 'tis state enough To kisse or creep in their forgotten slough: Practise &amp; Contemplation I agree Shou'd rise, let that a Banging Bishop be While this shines west, yet may noe crime attaint The first, but like the second liue a Sainct. Alas the Churches tayle is lost in drinke While pott &amp; pipe are made hir pen and inke, And if the Iowle in pride be pickled too What shall the sides the bulke, the body doe? Curates leave ale, leave Prelates ease &amp; pride, Or Learned &amp; Lay, the Clergie will deride: And you my learned frend though past the roare Of Scylla's doggs, take heed in ventring ore Caribdisse gulfe where Mermaide honour sitts On seas of danger strewd with rocks &amp; pitts, Least I when clambring over hills &amp; dayls By North or South, your Pallace out in Wales Approching as to Phœbus burnisht roofe Like Phaeton be bidd to stand a loofe And scarce recovering me at second sight You swear good faith, I had forgott you quite I promis'd you a prebend but in-troth I am so pressd with Lords &amp; Ladies both That I can doe you now noe further grace Then the reversion of the nineteenth place Nine years I haue expected (and am loth To name him yet) a mighty Bishops oath. But if I liue to write his Epitaph It shall so weep that all that read shall laugh You can not so deceiue, then onwards march Till to your first you raise a second Arch. To Mr T N: Physitian at Leicest My frend (my Celsus! that's most Eloquent Of all Physitians) helpe ere all be spent The tacklings of my spirit, with waves &amp; wind Of course discourse, that raves in most mankind I must come to thee, for some cordiall thing For what they vent (beside the smart &amp; sting) Diaphoretick, Diuretick is He that will tak't is sure to sweat &amp; pisse. As pedants, Iustices, Stepmothers when They say, I'le talk with you S?, threaten then Mere talkers so, me persecuting, breake Their minds, as banquerout wanting stock; &amp; speake Till I stand stock-still: hauing else noe fence Gainst hearing theirs; but turning thus, nonsence Cryticks that breake vp moldy books (like wise My Lord Maiors tough rie-crusted great gylt pies Wher lie dead Calues embalmd, which rising good Veale mummie, serve to cure the brotherhood) Cannot with wedges cleaue theise writhen blocks; Nor all your high-crosse combatants with knocks Of two cartload of cudgells once expell Theise braines, or peirce their Dura maters kell All statesmen, all intelligencers bring, Wormes, pincers, cupping-glasses, any thing The rack, the gallows, or the fire to passe They could not tell you what their meaning was But thy rich noble conference on me Conferrs both benefice &amp; dignitie, As lustie Virgill leaps &amp; sitts a strid While Phœbus Nun Corvetts; Theise Goblins ride Theise Incubi, theise daymares vrge me so That like a child emptie &amp; whipt I goe Moaning my selfe to thee my Nurse, whose brest Vnfolded, brings me both to food and rest. To My Lord Cromwell Viscount Le Cale. My Lord tis your virtue a great &amp; a rare one That hauing ascended aboue an old Baron Your dignitie dos not to strangnesse compell you Nor with a proud tympany all overswell you, In most of our great ones their titles addition Makes worke for the Surgeon &amp; for the Physition Quite altering the state of their bodies for ever Their bloud overboiles, strange heats in the liuer The brain with a dull vertigo so tainted With all their old frends they grow disacquainted With noses awry, eyes staring, &amp; flushing And cheeks redd with pumples that never knew blushing Old gentle salutings their language forbearing And know but two graces thats bawdry &amp; swearing A lord such as theise the hobby-horse passes For a beast dounright, a fantasticall asse is But you though a Viscount are still my Lord Crumwell And keep the same posture, which dos you become well Right English, true hearted, &amp; good to my thinking Yet some talke of wenches and I except drinking My lord in your voiage may a poor man advise you To sinke those false Pyrats that lie to surprise you All winds then of honour with full sailes attend you Till past rocks &amp; flatts ore the surges they send you To find that rare port of virtues vnspotted Wher my noble masters haue places allotted, Both which since you loue &amp; of both are beloued O Imitate both &amp; so liue vnreproved Mean while for all three to pray I do promise Good Harrie, braue Robbin and you noble Tommis.

O freezing fire, perplext and ridling fate No merite loue, &amp; loue deserv'd is hate! Can such a power take vp without his scorne An Ariadne faded and forlorne?

Vpon the Battaile, by the same author. My first glad feares, &amp; ioyfull tremblings past, The Myst cleares vp: at thy Lowde Clarions blast The battayle strikes; strikes w?? a mightie amaze Myne eyes; that Royall thing, whose starrlike blaze Hurles bloud-shott fire on Austria'es eagles wings Then falls the greife &amp; grace of forraine kings. Thick clouds of vultures seize the glorious preye Till thy braue storme of Swedds blowes all away; Whose wrathfull steele whole standing feilds at once Dounce fells; &amp; heapes huge Fun'rall piles of bones Nor till th'affrighted Foe to flight they driue Their king, in death a conquerour, home retriue; Then like this Martyrs master on the roode Impale his browes with crowne of Bayes &amp; blood. Thy Muse so drest, comes forth in stately feete His height of worth, in height of verse to meet: And on his herse by magick spells to spread Vncanckring brasse, &amp; fine liue marble shead. Deuise-full frame! wherein thy braine invents To place thy fame with regall monuments. Men cannot iudge that wonder, &amp; I canne No lesse, to see this master-peice of manne So cutt to life, by thee whose grauing toole Is sett to Copies in a Countrie Schole; Tis much; so whyrld, w?? that Diurnall sweigh In gracefull posture still to keepe thy way, In such a mill to tend this wheele &amp; throwne To manie motions, thus to mynde thyne owne How large a circle fill? what light mightst thou To vs, &amp; our Antipodes allow?

I knowe not how his Arts may since encrease But Sure hee's maim'd in Liberall Sciences. His Grammer's gone: His ablatiue's to seeke Nor can he helpe it with the merrie Greeke. For Logicke hee's in a faire Prædicament Loosing his substance by an accident And striues to Lick it whole by argument. His vocale musique rellishes for aye But this quite spoiles his fingering (they say) O the fiue fingar's a great helpe in play. But if vnto Arithmetique we come Hee'l find a way to rayse the totall summe Yet must be twice beholden to Tom Thumbe. Nor can Geometrie or proue or showe Foure parts of fiue are all, or else 'tis soe Just as Tetragonon in Trigano.

Like an Hart, the liue-long day That in thorns and thickets lay, Rouse thee soul, thy flesh forsake, Got to relief from thy brake; Shuddering I would have thee part, And at every motion start. Look behind thee still to see, If thy frailties follow thee. Deep in silence of the night, Take a sweet and stoln delight. Graze on Clover by this calm, Precious spring of bleeding Balm, Thou remembrest how it ran From his side, thats God and man. Taste the pleasures of this stream, Thou wilt think thy flesh a dream. Nightly this Repast go take, Got to Relief from thy brake. On New-years Day, a New-years Gift; Out of Gal. 4, 4. God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the Law. First, God sent his Son. God sent his Son; to make mans joy begun From first to last, in endless circle run. Without Beginning God who never ends From boundless Being, mans Beginning sends. Mans double guard of Sun and stars we see. Angels unseen, all of his sending be. A foodfull Garden; after food came rest. Then woman came, of Visibles the best: Her seed in Promise then, in Gods intent Before all worlds into the world was sent. But till all other sendings fail and fade, The Blood that seal'd this mission was unmade. Man first was sent to Reasons goodly Lamp, Which dul'd he found, and dim'd in sinful damp Then Sacrifice and Prayer; which heard, he saw New Light down sent him in a flaming Law; Wild sinners scourge; But School and Guide to those That tir'd by sin, by Faith on him repose. To make whose joyes in endless circle run, From first to last; Behold God sent his Son. Made under the Law. Under the Law; He that the Ground-work laid Of Earth, and gave the seas a Law, was made. Who gives the charge to this Eternal Word; Supream-and-sole-law-giving mighty Lord. Proud slime and worms, God bows our yoke to bear, Put on in love, to put us out of fear. To service, homage, vassalage descends Jan. 1.Today, and first fruit of his blood he spends. What Feind Eccentrick then shall force our souls From motions regular about his Poles? Shall euen deadly sins in disaray, Keep off our minds from his Diurnal sway? Under the Law made he his resting place, And chose the curse, to leave us under Grace. But still to morals tied our hearts and hands; Scorn not his easie yoak, nor break his bands. Without those Grates, all fire of vertue cools; None lawless thus, but Devils, Popes and Fools. Made of a Woman Made of a woman; Heark you Race Of men; no more this Sex disgrace: The Lord of Glory leaves his place To Bour with Mary full of Grace. God above all thats great or good, Is made of womans flesh and blood. How rare a Vivary was this, Our Lord within our Lady is. O look! Amazed Angels look, But cannot read this mystick Book; Till that Babes blood unclose the seal, And so himself, himself reveal. The woman first that wrought our wo Remember first, from man did grow. Here all by Virgins blood was done, Gods only Partner in his Son Made of a woman; Heark you Race Of men; no more this Sex disgrace. A Psalm for Christmass day morning. 1 Fairest of morning Lights appear, Thou blest and gaudy day, On whom was born our Saviour dear, Make haste and c[o]me away. 2 See, See, our pensive breasts do pant, Like gasping Land we lie, Thy holy Dews our souls do want. We faint, we pine, we die. 3 Let from the skies a joyfull Rain Like Mel or Manna fall. Whose searching drops our sins may drain, And quench our sorrows all. 4 This day prevents his day of Doom, His mercy now is nigh. The mighty God of love is come; The day-spring from on high. 5 Behold the great Creator makes Himself an house of clay. A Robe of Virgin flesh he takes Which he will wear for ay. 6 Heark, heark, the wise Eternal Word, Like a weak Infant cries, In form of servant is the Lord; And God in Cradle lies. 7 This wonder struck the world amaz'd; It shook the stary frame. Squadrons of spirits stood and gaz'd. Then down in Troops they came. 8 Glad Shepherds ran to view this sight, A quire of Angels sings, And Eastern Sages with delight Adore this King of Kings. 9 Bis. Joyn then all hearts that are not stone, And all our voices prove To celebrate this holy One, The God of Peace and Love. A Psalm for Sunday Nights. 1 Come Ravisht souls with high Delight: In sweet immortal Verse, To crown the day, and welcome night; Jehovahs praise Reherse. 2 O sing the Glories of our Lord, His Grace and Truth resound. And his stupendous acts Record, Whose mercies have no bound. 3 He made the All informing Light, And hosts of Ang[el]s fair: Tis he with shadows cloaths the night, He clouds or clears the Air. 4 Those restless skies with stars enchaste He on firm hindges set: The wave embraced earth he plac'd His hanging Cabinet. 5 Wherein for us all things comply Which he hath so d[e]creed. That each in order faithfully Shall evermore proceed. 6 We in his Sommer sun-shine stand, And by his favour grow. We gather what his bounteous hand Is pleased to bestow. 7 When he contracts his brow we mourn, And all our strength is vain, To former dust in death we turn, Till he inspire again. 8 Then to this mighty Lord give praise And all our voices prove. The Glory of his name to raise, The God of Peace and Love. The Christians Reply to Christs Venite Possum, good Lord by thee inclin'd: Volo sometimes with ease I find. Nolo yet runs so in mind, Malo still makes me lag behind. Pride will fall,—but Grace to the Humble. 1 This fall Fell Lucifer first tries, Who endlong fell, never to rise. Woman the next; then man, and all; Proud flesh from them have caught the fall. 2 From this foul falling sickness shall The fall of one, recover all Mankind, that medcin'd by his Spirit His best of Graces shall inherit. Whereby he still in it doth fall Upon his humble servants all. His conjugal Prayer Domestick. God infinitely Great and Good! Purge all our sins by Jesus blood. From serpentine three deadly foes, The Gardens of our souls enclose. That Spirit which Grace and Truth affords, Rule all our actions, thoughts and words. Our hearts into his Temples raise; Our tongues loud Organs of his praise. Lord make our selves and Race throughout, Pure, humble, sober, chast, devout, Loyal and gratefull, wise and just, On thee, and industrie to trust; Blest with a low, but glad estate, In food and Rayment moderate. Nor rich of poor to be envied, Nor poor to be by rich supplied. Give freedom, Order, Health and Peace, Then in thy favour to decease When Nature here by Grace prepar'd, May look for Glory afterward.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[Nichols's History of Leicestershire.] On Mr. Bancroft his Glutton's Fever. In Bosworth-feild the white-rose redd in blood, The redd grew white; and thence grew all our good, Sweet princes, and sweet peace; all joyes that fill All angles of this Isle. On Ambeame hill Our Caesar's garland grew; wherin he sitts Crown'd the sole patrone of all learned witts. Our (but unwanton, untempestuous) Jove, Our tow'ring Eagle, and our stouping Dove. This is, and shall be, Chronicle: but till This howre I never heard of Bancroft's hill, Or Muses' springs therin; nor could I dreame From Bosworth schole to reade so riche a theame. A man obscure, an usher to do this; This polisht worke, this more than master-piece. But wonders are not wonders in the raigne Of our Augustus, peaceful Charle-le-maine. For which (as once that conquering Richmond hadd The crowne of golde) some abler hand might add A wreath of bayes to thy victorious browe, Which to my powre I here present thee now. And first salute thee Poet; and that name From me, strikes Envy blind, and Malice lame. Reading thy strains, methinks I heard the same From him that was our Academies' shame; Our pullpitts' glorie; and I would be glad Our plain-song priests but halph thy descant had: They then, although they liv'd and died in prose, Might use their tongues, and not misuse their nose. How shall I name thy fabrick? A free-schole For court and country: New Bethesday's poole; Where bedd-ridd soules despairing, coucht in synn, Helpt by thy hand, and by thy penne put in, After a motion of repentant teares, Catch angell thoughts, and lose their devilish feares. Call it a beacon, or a larum-bell; Another arke, where all within are well; The hovering dove, from waterie wildernesse Comes here in peace, hir wearie wings to dresse; But carrion crowes, the gluttons' brotherhood, That never lawe nor prophets understood; (Deriding preachers) hurle thy booke away, Or else account it but a puppet play. O reade it once, twice; if your hearts it wound, Reade it againe, and it will sett you sound. Dives himselfe in hell, might he but looke And reade, might yet be saved by his booke. An Elegie I made on Mr. Francis Beaumont, dying 1615–16 at Westminster. Unto thy ever-loved memory, And o'er thy hearse, this weeping Elegie Shedds hee, who to restore thee, as thou wert Once a full perfect man, would spend his heart; And 't were a blest fate, if such things as I, To make thee live, might but by myriades die. Yet fond Philosophie will prate, and dare Tell us mens souls alike and equall are. O, 'tis an odious lie, made out of pride; Thine was as large as halph the world beside: And as old wives imagine to this day, The moon to starrs each month is clipt away, Whence heaven is fill'd; if thy most ample witt, Or just so much, God took and parted it To dramms and grains, the purest and the best Would furnish fortie colledges at least (I think); the refuse I am sure would bee Too good for th'Inns a Court and Chancerie. 'Tis true there be some able witts alive, (Though very fewe), about a fowr or five; But which of theise is natural and free, Not prentise to long art and industrie; Which, with mere labour, all that they can doo Is patching up an old drie bobb or two To make a lord laugh, or some lady gaye A bracelett or a jewell cast away? But (which pure Nature only did refine) A braine that could conceive so quick as thine, And be delivered so without all paine, Ile never looke to meet the like againe. All such sleight sylly things as I might steale Witt, that thou threwst away at every meale (When first I knew thee), with good husbandrie, Able to serve us till the day we die. The Jesuits that trace witt and subtiltye, And are mere cryticks in Divinitie; Who to the soadring a crackt cause allow Sett fees for every new distinction; thou By a clean strength of witt and judgment wert Well able to confound, if not convert. Have we not cause then to lament thee dead? Death, I acknowledge thee the supreme head Over all persons: God haes given thee sway In thy two kingdomes of the earth and sea. I knew thee mighty; but I thought thou wert More wise, and lesse maliciouse then thou art. For, being re-advis'd his death will show To be a foolish and a spitefull blow. For was it wisedome in a rage to kill Him, for the very last words that his quill Lett fall, instructing ladies how their lives Are best preserv'd, with no[e] preservatives; Since he well knew, if this way were denied, Thou hadst a thousand entrances besides. Alasse, he wrote it in none hate to thee: His frequent wishes for thy company, And, when thou cam'st, embraces, gave good proof He ever lov'd and lik'd thee well enough. How comes it with thy friends so angrie growne Thou art, and tak'st pett; letting such alone Whose every writing gives a foule offence, And all their deeds defie thine excellence? Looke in that place where thou didst last contrive His death: they swarme as bees about the hive; Which do disgrace (for theise no lawyers be) And staine that needfull, noble facultie, The sinews of our state, to which they grow As heresies, or as diseases doo; Atturneys, punies, clerks, solicitors, Encamping and uniting all their force 'Gainst thee: their gunns are bouncing inkhorns, and Their armour skins of beasts; their penns a stand Of pikes and launces; and their watch-word Fees; With buckram knapsacks fill'd with pilferies. Yet is their language worse than mutinie, Drowning thy dradd name in obscuritie By talke of leases, states, assurances, Possessions, tenures, and recoveries, Lives, and three lives; which suff'ring, look to see, Shortly thy state adjudg'd a nullitie. Then thou art dead in law, and nothing lacks But roubing thee in calve-skinns balm'd in waxe. If thou beest sensible of wrong, then mend This geare; and like a ravening storke descend Among theise froggs, whose hideous number crall And cover ore the land; and now they fall To building castles, and to fortifie In each fatt place, like a new monkerie. Do but enquire, as you travell still, Of every faire house upon everie hill, And everie one will tell thee, here does live Such a law-driver, nine times under-shreive; And there dwells such a one, solicitour To such a lord, that was not long before A petitefogger, sprouted from a clark's Mann's boy that wypt boots; yet such wretched sharkes, Such things not worth the thinking on as theise, In spight of thee, still grow in wealth and ease. I should believe, but that you canst not see, And art impartiall, they had bribed thee. Sure thou wilt shortly, though you give them scope Awhile, lett in the Devill or the Pope, And make a skuffle: or is't policie In thee to lett them waxe and multiplie, And (like ranke weeds) ore-topping other men, Possesse the land themselfs alone; and then This dragon-tongu'd fraternitie (as they That sprung of teeth) shall one another slaye? Thy follie thus excus'd, I yet must judge Thou slewst him for a spitefull secret grudge, 'Cause those quick lines from his live Muse did passe Have marble shedd and everlasting brasse Over three ladies, which still fresh shall be, And live to thy disgrace in memorie. This did so vexe thee, Death, that thou were faine To hire an apoplexe, to shend his braine, Till thou couldst come thyselfe, and hinder so That sprightly nectar which from it did flow; And yet his puissant witt was nere so drie, But even in midst of most infirmitie It crown'd his last worke with so faire an end, 'Twould puzzle the best witts alive to mend. And now, although his life on earth be done, Thou hast gain'd nothing; he haes; it's begunne In Heaven more glorious; wher that sacred head, 'Mongst Saints and Angells, is canonised; And men shall henceforth, when they mean to frame A wittie poem, invocate his name The new Saint Francis; and those fewe that are Able to lead their liues so regular (Though ne'er in all points so exact) as hee Shall a new order of Franciscans bee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[Lachrymae Musarum:] For the Right Honourable, LUCIE, Countess of Huntingdon. 1649. From her Honours humblest Servant, T. P. Her Soliloquie, or her Meditation. 'Tis mystick Union, man and Wife, Yet scarce distinct from Single life, Till like the Sun, a Son arise, And set them Both before their eyes: No sweeter, braver, fairer sight, Then thus to stand in our own Light. And such a Son I joy'd: (Ay me! Was ever such a Son as he?) And felt what fervent spirits of Love Orbs of Maternal Bowels move. I wou'd not shun those outward snares, Of Shape, of shining eyes and hairs; Which still the more they catch, or wound, More pleasing still their power I found. And it is lawful, godly too, To love what Gods own fingers do: Whose Angells still are sweetly fac'd, Himself with perfect Beauty grac'd. But eager Vertue from the Clay, In words and actions making way To Sense: in All that heard or saw Became a fierce almighty Law, And stoop'd all hearts that were not stone, Or drown'd in Malice; or in Moan, Like mine. So overgone with Wo, My very Reason bids it go: Nor lies it in the power of Wit, By Reason to recover it. The Rational Reply. By Reason to recover it, Sans forlorn Hope, or wings of Wit, Who serves you, his main Battel brings. Heark how the feather'd Tempest sings; Your clouds of Grief transpiercing quite, Or hurrying to disordered Flight. Then (Sorrow vanquisht) on his Herse Rears Trophies of victorious Verse. First, let us ask Impatience why At gentle Death's approach we cry. Sweet Favourite of heaven, that flies With Cupids face, but Hermes eyes; Whose Rods, and Snakes, and seeming harms, Our souls in slumber wisely charms. For that poor Spark call'd Life; the brand, The Rush we carry in our hand; Which dropping and defiling spends: Death gives Delight that never ends. O mad mistake! Sea-tost, a Calm; And wounded, we reject a Balm: Rabide for want of Rest, we keep A bawling, and refuse to sleep: Dead-weary tir'd, yet scorn to stay; And, Cripples, hurl our Crutch away. But these are General: for your pain Here's water of a Special vein; Wherein no relish you shall feel Of Sulph'ry Wit, but Reasons steel. What cou'd you wish your Son? A pair Of Dove-like Eyes; as Joseph fair; Straight as young Mountain-Pines, whose arms The Sun with early kisses warms: Guilds, blazons so each Leaf and Limb, That Paint is dirt, and Metal dim. He was all this, and all that we Can fetch from Beauties pedigree. The Case so bright, what radiance threw The Jewel that it did indue! The Queen that held the Throne in state Of Grace, there drest and re-create: Till like a Lark from earthly Cage Enlarg'd, and fir'd with strong new Rage, She mounts, and sings in heaven. And what? May we not fall some drops thereat? Good reason, if the Tears you shed From joyful brains expansion spread, Call it not grief; foul Envie 'tis, To whine at Saints enshrin'd in bliss. Reflect on all the whole worlds frame, It climbs and twines to whence it came: So Beams that shine, and Streams that flow, Back to their Sun and Ocean go. To Vernal Flowers, which, at their birth Thrust up pure crowns from impure Earth, Grow by degrees full ripe, and then Must hide them in their Roots agen. He parted in Perfection's time, In Golden Number, and in Prime Of Life, of Love, and White Report For Vertue; past the ranker sort Of Flash-green youths; no Vicious Stain Envenoming his Blood or Brain: From Duels, Drink, Dice, Cares, Age, Laws, Faces of Dames, and Eagles Claws, Exempt: he laughs at us that still Bleat round the bottom of the hill. Last, think of your clear open way To heaven, obstructed by his stay; While, more than Mer-Maid, face and words All Ear-wax melts, and breaks all Cords. Did not his Look, his Voice and Deed, With full commerce of Pleasure feed Your Sense and Soul? which now takes wing, Checks not at ought; nor spies fair thing Worth stooping at. O let it flie To Quarries there above the skie On the untimely death of HENRY Lord HASTINGS, Onely Son to Ferdinand and Lucy, Earl and Countess of Huntingdon. Up, Beldame Muse! thy Climacterick's past: But one work more; thy lastingst, if not last. Lord Hastings glorious shade before us stands, Whose Vertue exacts this Duty from our hands: 'Twill be a Night-piece, friends: Here never seek Lucie large-soul'd, and Ferdinand the meek; Who both esteem'd it braver work and worth, To bring this Son up, then t'have brought him forth. He th'Exposition to their double Text, The Glass wherein they saw themselves reflext; He, that was He; and She, and both in one, Both she and he, all three, in him are gone. This Sun-set all obscur'd: with Ætna prest, Their burning Giant Grief can take no rest. To print so black a Sorrow fair, I want Gold-plate for Paper, Pen of Adamant. Veils on those chief Close-mourners faces spread; I pencil out all gentler eyes in Red Swoln lids; as having spent their bottom-store Of precious dew-drops, till their hearts are sore. Which fast congeal'd Balm has his Herse in fixt In Chrystal Case, with Pearl and Amber mixt. Rare Monument! but cannot him refine, So rich a Saint impov'rishing his Shrine. Was he not purest, fairest, wisest, best? All Graces magazin'd, yet unexprest. When his bright Bodies eminence I view'd, With such a soveraign Intellect indu'd, So just and ponder'd Temp'rature to finde, So early ripe, so richly matcht in Minde; Choice Gem of Nature, set in Nurturing Gold; Exulting Fancy quick conceiv'd the Mold Was ready now, wherein th'Almightie's hand Wou'd cast new Nobles, and restore the Land; Whose finest Gold, if in compare it bring, Is sure to finde his strong Mercurial Sting. He caus'd us hurl our Vows, and gave free scope To change our Wishes into Present Hope. But O Sydneian! O Blood-Royal Fate! Great Britains curse, whose sinful, shameful State Makes all Heroick Vertue soon decay; Which mad she throws, or just God takes away. So fell our Ripheus in New Troy, lest he Perchance her Fires and instant Ruine see: For will that sacred Thundrer never powre On such a Sodom his revengeful showre? Where Lust and Pride, with their five brethren stand In bold defiance of his armed hand: Where Lords and Gentry, mindless of white Fame, Graceless of old, are now beneath all Shame. Pardon, fresh Saint, to set thy shining Good With such coarse foils, to make it understood: To topless height, from their base depth below, Thy flaming Pyramid of Praise wou'd grow. But for thou joy'st th'applause of Angels there, How frivolous are our weak Ecchoes here!</field>

Your Fame and Feet have Alps and Oceans past: Fam'd Feet! which Art can't raise, nor Envie blast. 2 Beaumont and Fletcher coyn'd a golden Way, T'expresse, suspend, and passionate a Play. Nimble and pleasant are all Motions there, For two Intelligences rul'd the Spheare. 3 Both Sock and Buskin sunk with Them, and then Davenant and Denham buoy'd them up agen. Beyond these Pillars some think nothing is: Great Britain's Wit stands in a Precipice. 4 But, Sir, as though Heav'ns Straits discover'd were, By Science of your Card, Unknowns appear: Sail then with Prince of Wits, illustrious Dunne, Who rapt Earth round with Love, and was its Sun. 5 But your first Love was pure: Whose ev'ry Dresse Is inter-tissu'd Wit and Holinesse; And mends upon Itself; whose Streams (that meet With Sands and Herberts) grow more deep, more sweet. 6 I, wing'd with Joy, to th'Praelibation fly; Thence view I Errours Tragie-comedie: With Theophil from Fear to Faith I rise, The mystick Bridge, 'twixt Hell and Paradise. 7 Hell scap't seems double Heav'n: Renew'd, with Bands Of Pray'rs, Vows, Tears, with Eyes, and Knees, and Hands, I see her cope with Heav'n, and Heav'n does thence, As in the Baptist's Dayes, feel Violence. 8 But her ecstatick Songs of Love, declare, To Jedidiah, Shee's apparent Heir. Be those then next, the Song of Songs. Love stiles Her Fourth, The Second Book of Canticles. 9 But with what dreadfull, yet delightful tones She sings when Glorify'd. Then, stinglesse Drones Are Death and Hell: Joyes crescent then's encreast, To fullest Lustre, at her Bridal Feast. 10 Sixth, Sev'nth, and Eighth such Banquets frame would make Wisdom turn Cormorant; my Spirits shake I th'Reading. Soul of Joy! thy ravishing Sp'rite Draws bedrid Mindes to longing Appetite. 11 Fame, write with Gold on Diamond Pages; treat Upon the Glories of a Work so great. Be't then enacted that all Graces dwell In Thee Theoph'la, Virtues Chronicle: 12 Who jemm'st it in Jerusalem Aboue, Where all is Grace and Glory, Light and Love. To That Unparallel, This comes so near, That, 'tis a glimpse of Heav'n to read thee here. 13 O, blest Ambition! Speculations high Enchariot Thee, Elijah-like, to the Skie! What State worth Envy, like thy sweet Abode, That overtops the World, and mounts to GOD? 14 Walkt through your Eden Stanza's, you invite Our ravisht Souls to recre'ate with Delight, In Bow'r of compt Discourse: Great Verse, but Prose Such, none but our Great Master could compose. 15 For Bulk, an easie Folio is this All; Yet we a Volume may each Canto call, For solid Matter: where we should consult On Paragraphs, mark what does thence result: 16 For, every Period's of Devotion Proof, And each Resolve is of concern'd Behoof. Peruse, Examine, Censure; ôh', how bright Does shine Religion, checquer'd with Delight! 17 Diffusive Soul! your Spirit was soaring, when This Manna dew'd from your inspired Pen. Such melting Passions of a Soul divine, Could They be cast in any Mould but Thine? 18 Wonder arrests our Thought; That you alone In such combustions, wherein Thousands grone, (And when some Sparkles of the publick Flame Seiz'd on your private State, and scorcht the same) 19 Could warble Thus. Steer Ships each Pilot may In Calms; But Whoso can in Stormie day, May justly domineer. But what may daunt Him, who, like Mermaids, thus in Storms can chaunt? Grace crowns the Suff'ring, Glory the Triumphing Saint.</field>
