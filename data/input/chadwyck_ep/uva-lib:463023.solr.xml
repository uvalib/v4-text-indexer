Fro whens eek is procedid thy pitee? And fro whens growith thy benignitee? whens streccith thy loue and affeccioun? Fro whens is sprongen thy conpassioun? 6 I am he / þat wroght haue synfully, And thow, giltlees, took vp on thee the peyne: I dide amis / I synned greuously, For which thow greeued were in euery veyne: Thy louyng charitee nat list desdeyne To bye our gilt / thogh thow were innocent, But on the crois souffriddist thy torment. 7 I woxe am prowd / thow keepist thy meeknesse; My flessh is bolned / thyn is woxen thynne; Myn herte is wrappid in vnbuxumnesse; And thow buxum / our soules for to wynne, Boghtest deere our corrupt &amp; roten synne; My lust obeied vn-to glotonye, But thee list nat / thee to þat lust applie. 8 I was vanysshid by concupiscence, For to eten of the vnleefful tree; And for my lust and inobedience, Thy feruent loue / &amp; parfyt charitee, O blisful chyld / to the crois ladden thee: where as þat I took the deffendid thyng, Thow deidest for me, Iesu, heuene kyng. 9 In mete &amp; drynke / I delyte me; And on the gibet took thow greet duresse: Betwixt tho two / is greet dyuersitee. Taastid haue I the fair apples swetnesse; Ofgalle thow taastist the bittirnesse: Eeue me gladith / with a lawwhyng ye, And weepynge vp-on thee / reewith Marie. 10 O Kyng of glorie / thow beholde &amp; see what peynes thow suffriddist for our sake! And syn þat we so deere costed thee, Thow keepe vs fro the might of feendes blake! Lat nat thy charitable loue asslake; And graunte vs grace thee to loue &amp; drede, And yeue vs heuene whan þat we be dede! III.

Thurgh thy mercy, ther make thyn entree, O holy goost, there enhabyte thee; And the dirk halkes of our soules lighte, And glade with thy firy lemes brighte! 3 And oure hertes / whiche, by long roghnesse, welkid been / &amp; forgoon han hir vigour, By enchesoun of excessyf drynesse, Dewe habundantly with thyn holsum shour! Our soules lurkyng / sores and langour, with thy brennyng dart and thy loues broond, Visite and helpe / our helthe is in thyn hoond. 4 Kyndle eek and qwikne / with thy lyfly lemes Our slouthy hertes / of vertu bareyne; Our soules perce with thy shynyng bemes! To thy godhede / thow vs knytte and cheyne! The ryuer of thy lust lat on vs reyne! Of worldly sweet venym souffre vs nat taaste, Ne our tyme in this world mis-spende and waaste! 5 O god, we thee byseeche, thow vs deeme: And our cause fro wikkid folk discerne! Thow graunte vs grace thee to plese &amp; qweeme, And to thy wil and pleasaunce vs gouerne, Our seekly freeltee beholde and concerne. And reewe on our brotil condicioun, And for our gilt sende vs contricioun! 6 wher thow makist thyn habitacioun, we knowen weel / and fully leeuen we, Thow, for fadir and sone / a mansioun Makist / in whom thee list herberwe thee, Ful happy and ful blissid man is he, For his spirit may reste sikirly Vnabassht of the feend oure enemy. 7 Come on, confort of our soules seeknesse, And ay reedy in our necessitee! Of wowndes leche / helpere in distresse, O, come now foorth, strengthe of our freeltee, Clensere of our gilt and iniquitee, Releeuere of hem þat doun slippe and slyde, Ground of meeknesse, &amp; destroyour of pryde! 8 Of fadrelees children / o fadir free; Of widwes, esy / Iuge / &amp; hope &amp; trust; Of poore folk / and in aduersitee Refuyt &amp; help / helpe vs / for so thow must; Of oure soules / rubbe away the rust!

VII. The story of the Monk who clad the Virgin by singing Ave Maria. Explicit prologus &amp; incipit fabula 1 Ther was whilom / as þat seith the scripture, In France / a ryche man and a worthy, That god and holy chirche to honure And plese / enforced he him bisily; And vn-to Crystes modir specially, Þat noble lady / þat blissid virgyne, For to worsshipe / he dide his might and pyne. 2 It shoop so / þat this man had a yong sone, Vn-to which he yaf informacion, Euery day to haue in custume and wone For to seye, at his excitacion, The angelike salutacion .L. sythes / in worsship and honour Of goddes modir / of vertu the flour. 3 By his fadres wil / a monk, aftirward, In thabbeye of seint Gyle / maad was he; where-as he in penance / sharp &amp; hard Obserued wel his ordres duetee, Lyuynge in vertuous religioustee; And on a tyme / him to pleye and solace, His fadir made him come hoom to his place. 4 Now was ther, at our ladyes reuerence, A chapel in it maad and edified, In-to which / the monk, whan conuenience Of tyme he had awayted &amp; espied, His fadres lore / to fulfille him hied; And .L. sythes / with deuout corage Seide Aue Marie / as was his vsage. 5 And whan þat he had endid his preyeere, Our lady, clothid in a garnement Sleuelees, byfore him he sy appeere: where-of the monk took good auisament, Merueillynge him / what þat this mighte han ment; And seide “.o. goode lady, by your leeue, What garnament is this / and hath no sleeue?” 6 And she answerde / &amp; seide / “this clothynge Thow hast me youen / for thow euery day, .L. sythe Aue Maria seyynge, honured hast me / hens foorth / I the pray, Vse to treble þat / by any way, And to euery .x???.

VIII. “Lepistre de Cupide.” 1 Cupido / vn-to whos commandement The gentil kynrede / of goddes on hy And peple infernal been obedient, And the mortel folk seruen bisyly; Of goddesse Sitheree / sone oonly, To alle tho / þat to our deitee Been sogettes / greetynges senden we. 2 In general / we wole þat yee knowe Þat ladyes of honur and reuerence, And othir gentil wommen, han I-sowe Swich seed of conpleynte in our audience, Of men þat doon hem outrage &amp; offense, Þat it oure eres greeueth for to heere, So pitous is theffect of hir mateere, 3 And passyng alle londes / on this yle That clept is Albioun / they moost conpleyne; They seyn þat there is croppe and roote of gyle, So can tho men dissimulen and feyne, with standyng dropes in hire yen tweyne, whan þat hire herte / feelith no distresse, To blynde wommen with hir doublenesse. 4 His wordes spoken been so sighyngly, And with so pitous cheere and contenance, That euery wight þat meeneth trewely Deemeth / þat they in herte han swich greuance: They seyn / so importable is hir penance, Þat, but hir lady / list to shewe hem grace, They right anoon moot steruen in the place. 5 “A, lady myn” / they seyn / “I yow ensure, Shewe me grace / &amp; I shal euere be, whyles my lyf may lasten &amp; endure, To yow as humble in euery degree As possible is / and keepe al thyng secree, As þat your seluen lykith þat I do, And elles moot myn herte breste on two.” 6 Ful hard is it to knowe a mannes herte, For outward may no man the truthe deeme, whan word out of his mowth / may ther noon sterte, But it sholde any wight by reson qweeme; So is it seid of herte / it wolde seeme. O feithful womman, ful of Innocence, Thow art betrayed by fals apparence! 7 By process / wommen meeued of pitee, weenyng al thyng were / as þat tho men seye, Granten hem grace of hir benignitee, For they nat sholden for hir sake deye; And with good herte sette hem in the weye Of blisful loue / keepe it if they konne: Thus othir whyle been the wommen wonne. 8 And whan the man / the pot hath by the stele, And fully of hire hath possessioun, with þat womman he keepith nat to dele Aftir / if he may fynden in the toun Any womman / his blynd affeccion On to bestowe / foule moot he preeue: A man, for al his ooth / is hard to leeue. 9 And for þat euery fals man / hath a make, As vn-to euery wight / is light to knowe, whan this Traitour the womman hath forsake, He faste him speedith / vn-to his felowe; Til he be there / his herte is on a lowe; His fals deceit / ne may him nat souffyse, But of his treson / tellith al the wyse. 10 Is this a fair auant / is this honour, A man him-self to accuse &amp; diffame? Now is it good, confesse him a traitour, And brynge a womman to a sclaundrous name, And telle how he / hir body hath doon shame? No worsship may he thus / to him conquere, But ful greet repreef vn-to him and here. 11 To here / nay / yit was it no repreef; For al for pitee was it þat shee wroghte; But he þat breewid hath al this mescheef, Þat spak so faire / &amp; falsly inward thoghte, His be the shame / as it by reson oghte, And vn-to here / thank perpetuel, Þat in a neede helpe can so wel. 12 Al thogh þat men, by sleighte &amp; sotiltee, A cely / symple / and ignorant womman Betraye / is no wondir / syn the Citee Of Troie / as þat the storie telle can, Betrayed was / thurgh the deceit of man, And set a-fyre / &amp; al doun ouerthrowe, And finally destroyed / as men knowe. 13 Betrayen man nat Remes grete and kynges? what wight is þat / can shape a remedie Agaynes false / &amp; hid purposid thynges? who can the craft, tho castes to espye, But man / whos wil ay reedy is tapplie To thyng þat sovneth in-to hy falshede? wemmen / be waar of mennes sleighte / I rede. 14 And forthermore, han the men in vsage, Þat where-as they nat likly been to speede, Swiche as they been / with a double visage They procuren / for to pursue hir neede, He preyeth him / in his cause proceede, And largely / him qwytith his trauaille: Smal witen wommen / how men hem assaille! 15 To his felawe an othir wrecche seith, “Thou fisshist faire / shee þat hath thee fyrid, Is fals / and inconstant / &amp; hath no feith; Shee for the rode of folk is so desyrid, And as an hors fro day to day is hyrid, That whan thow twynnest from hir conpaignie, An othir comth / and blerid is thyn ye. 16 “Now prike on faste / &amp; ryde thy iourneye; whyl thow art ther / shee, behynde thy bak, So liberal is / she can no wight withseye, But qwikly of an othir take a snak; For so the wommen faren, al the pak: who-so hem trustith, hangid moot he be! Ay they desiren chaunge &amp; noueltee.” 17 Where-of procedith this / but of enuye: For he him-self / here ne wynne may, Repreef of here he spekth, and villenye, As mannes labbyng tonge is wont alway: Thus sundry men ful often make assay For to destourbe folk in sundry wyse, For they may nat accheuen hire empryse. 18 Ful many a man eek wolde for no good, Þat hath in lone / spent his tyme &amp; vsid, Mon wiste / his lady / his axyng withstood, And þat he were of his lady refusid, Or waast &amp; veyn were / al þat he had musid; wherfore / he can no bettre remedie, But on his lady / shapith him to lie. 19 “Euery womman,” he seith / “is Light to gete; Can noon seyn nay / if shee be wel I-soght; who so may leiser han / with hire to trete, Of his purpos / ne shall he faille noght, But on maddyng he be so deepe broght, Þat he shende al / with open hoomlynesse; Þat louen wommen nat / as þat I gesse.” 20 To sclaundre wommen thus / what may profyte To gentils namly / þat hem armen sholde, And in deffense of wommen hem delyte, As þat the ordre of gentillesse wolde. If þat a man list / gentil to be holde, Al moot he flee / þat is to it contrarie; A sclaundryng tonge / is ther-to Aduersarie. 21 A foul vice is / of tonge to be light; For who so mochil clappith / gabbith ofte. The tonge of man, so swift is and so Wight, Þat w[h]an it is areisid vp on lofte, Reson it sueth / so slowly and softe Þat it him neuere ouertake may: Lord, so the men been trusty at assay! 22 Al be it þat men fynde / o womman nyce, Inconstant / rechelees / or variable, Deynous / or prowd, fulfillid of malice, withoute feith or loue / &amp; deceyuable, Sly / qweynte &amp; fals / in al vnthrift coupable, wikkid and feers / &amp; ful of crueltee, It folwith nat / swiche alle wommen be. 23 whan þat the hy god / angels fourmed hadde, Among hem alle / whethir ther was noon Þat fownden was malicious &amp; badde? Yis / men wel knowen / ther was many oon Þat for hir pryde / fil from heuene anoon. Shal man therfore alle angels prowde name?

Take heede / of whom thow took thy begynnynge! lat thy modir be mirour vn-to thee! Honure hire / if thow wilt honurid be; Despyse thow nat hire / in no maneere, lest þat ther-thurgh thy wikkidnesse appeere. 27 An old prouerbe seid is in englissh: Men seyn þat brid or foul is deshonest, what so it be / and holden ful cherlissh, Þat wont is to deffoule his owne nest. Men to seye of wommen wel / it is best, And nat for to despise hem ne depraue, If þat hem list hire honur keepe and saue. 28 Ladyes eek conpleynen hem on Clerkis, Þat they han maad bookes of hir deffame, In whiche / they lakken wommennes werkis, And speken of hem / greet repreef and shame, And causelees / hem yeue a wikkid name: Thus they despysid been on euery syde, And sclaundred / and belowen on ful wyde. 29 Tho wikkid bookes / maken mencion, How they betrayeden, in special, Adam / Dauid / Sampson &amp; Salomon, And many oon mo / who may rehercen al The tresoun / þat they haue doon &amp; shal? who may hire hy malice conprehende?

How falsly quitte he hire affeccion, By whom victorie he gat / as he hath wold! How may this man / for shame be so bold To falsen hire / þat from deeth &amp; shame him kepte / and gat him so greet prys &amp; name? 45 Of Troie also the traitour Eneas, The feithlees man / how hath he him forswore To Dydo / þat Queene of Cartage was, Þat him releeued of his greeues sore? what gentillesse mighte she do more Than shee, with herte vnfeyned, to him kidde? And what mescheef / to hire of it betidde! 46 In our legende of martirs may men fynde, who-so þat lykith ther-in for to rede, That ooth noon / ne byheeste may men bynde: Of repreef ne of shame han they no drede; In herte of man / conceites trewe arn dede; The soile is naght / ther may no trouthe growe: To womman / is hir vice nat vnknowe. 47 Clerkes seyn also / ther is no malice Vn-to wommannes crabbid wikkidnesse. O / womman / how shalt thow thy self cheuyce, Syn men of thee / so mochil harm witnesse? Yee / strah / do foorth / take noon heuynesse! Keepe thyn owne / what men clappe or crake, And some of hem shuln smerte / I vndirtake. 48 Malice of wommen / what is it to drede? They slee no men / destroien no Citees; They nat oppressen folk / ne ouerlede; Betraye Empyres / Remes ne Duchees; Ne men byreue hir landes ne hir mees, Folk enpoysone / or howses sette on fyre, Ne fals contractes maken for noon hyre. 49 Trust, parfyt loue / and enteer charitee, Feruent wil / and entalentid corage To thewes goode / as it sit wel to be, Han wommen ay of custume &amp; vsage; And wel they can a mannes ire asswage with softe wordes, discreet &amp; benigne: What they been inward / shewith owtward signe. 50 wommannes herte / to no creweltee Enclyned is / but they been charitable, Pitous / deuout / ful of humilitee, Shamefast / debonaire and amiable, Dreedful / and of hir wordes mesurable: what womman / thise hath nat per auenture, Follwyth nothyng the way of hir nature. 51 Men seyn / oure firste modir, nathelees, Made al man-kynde leese his libertee, And nakid it of ioie / doutelees For goddes heeste / disobeied shee, whan shee presumed / to ete of the tree which god forbad / þat shee nat ete of sholde, And nad the feend been / no more she wolde. 52 Thenuyous swellyng / þat the feend our fo Had vn-to man in herte / for his welthe Sente a serpent / and made hire to go To deceyue Eeue / and thus was mannes welthe Byreft him by the feend / right in a stelthe. The womman nat knowyng / of the deceit, God woot / ful fer was it from hir conceit. 53 Wherfore We seyn / this good womman Eeue Our fadir Adam ne deceyued noght: Ther may no man for a deceit it preeue Proprely / but if þat shee in hir thoght Had it conpassid first / or it was wroght: And for swich was nat / hire impressioun, Men calle it may no deceit, by resoun. 54 No wight deceyueth / but he it purpose: The feend this deceit caste / &amp; nothyng shee: Than is it wrong for to deeme or suppose Þat shee sholde of þat gilt / the cause be. wytith the feend / and his be the maugree; And for excusid haue hire Innocence, Sauf oonly þat shee brak obedience. 55 Touchynge which / ful fewe men ther been— Vnnethes any, dar We saufly seye, Fro day to day as men mowe wel seen— But þat the heeste of god they disobeye: This haue in mynde, sires / We yow preye; If þat yee be discreet and resonable, ?ee wole hire holde the more excusable. 56 And wher men seyn / in man is stidfastnesse, And womman is of hir corage vnstable: who may of Adam bere swich witnesse? Tellith on this / was he nat changeable? They bothe weren in a cas semblable, Sauf willyngly the feend deceyued Eeue; So dide shee nat Adam / by your leeue. 57 Yit was þat synne happy to man-kynde; The feend deceyued was / for al his sleighte; For aght he kowde him / in his sleightes wynde, God, to descharge man-kynde of the weighte Of his trespas / cam doun from heuenes heighte; And flessh and blood he took of a virgyne, And souffred deeth / man to deliure of pyne. 58 And god, fro whom / ther may no thyng hid be, If he in womman / knowe had swich malice, As men of hem recorde in generaltee, Of our lady / of lyf reparatrice Nolde han be born / but for þat shee of vice was voide / and of al vertu, wel he wiste, Endowid / of hire be born him liste. 59 Hire hepid vertu / hath swich excellence, Þat al to weyk is mannes facultee To declare it / &amp; therfore, in suspense, Hir due laude / put moot needes be. But this We Witen verraily / þat shee, Next god, the best freend is / þat to man longith; The keye of mercy / by hir girdil hongith. 60 And of mercy / hath euery wight swich neede, Þat cessyng / it / farwel the ioie of man! Of hir power / it is to taken heede; Shee mercy may / wole, &amp; purchace can. Displese hir nat / honureth þat womman, And othir wommen alle / for hir sake, And but yee do / your sorwe shal awake. 61 Thow precious gemme / martir Margarete, Of thy blood dreddist noon effusioun! Thy martirdom / ne may We nat foryete. O constant womman, in thy passioun Ouercam the feendes temptacioun, And many a wight / conuerted thy doctryne, Vn-to the feith of god / holy virgyne. 62 But vndirstondith / We commende hir noght By encheson of hir virginitee: Trustith right wel / it cam nat in our thoght, For ay We werreie ageyn chastitee, And euere shal / but this leeueth wel yee: Hir louyng herte / and constant to hir lay, Dryue out of remembrance we nat may. 63 In any book also / wher can yee fynde Þat of the wirkes / or the deeth, or lyf Of Ihesu spekth / or makith any mynde, Þat wommen him forsook / for wo or stryf? wher was ther any wight so ententyf Abouten him / as wommen? perdee, noon!

O womman / þat of vertu art hostesse, Greet is thyn honur &amp; thy worthynesse! 67 Than thus we wolen conclude and deffyne: we you commaunde, our Ministres echoon, Þat reedy been to oure heestes enclyne, Þat of tho men vntreewe / our rebel foon, Yee do punisshement / and þat anoon; Voide hem our Court / &amp; banisshe hem for euere, So þat ther-ynne / they ne come neuere. 68 Fulfillid be it / cessyng al delay; Looke ther be noon excusacion! writen in their / the lusty monthe of May, In our Paleys / wher many a milion Of louers treewe / han habitacion, The yeer of grace / ioieful &amp; iocounde, M.CCCC. and secounde. “Explicit epistola Cupidinis.” IX.
