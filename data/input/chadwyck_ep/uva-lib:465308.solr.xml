      <field name="fulltext">[Part I.] BEAUTY IN DISTRESS. The radiant Sun, had ta'en his pompous March, Thro' twice two Houses, of th'ætherial Arch; Driv'n to the Tropick his triumphant Car, View'd Scythia's hot and bloody Scenes of War. Now wheeling's Chariot in the spangled Path, He puffs at Leo, with his hottest Breath: Scouring with Speed, thro' this fifth Northern Sign, He hastes against his Day to make the Line. In his swift Course, both Light and Heat divides, Thus from's high Solstice to th'Æquator rides, Where, th'Ascii lose their Shadows in his Rays, Melt with the Heat of his Meridian Blaze; Where's glowing Pencil, limns the Æthiop Black, And Drought and Heat in their full Vigour act: This Torrid Zone, is all a burning Coal, Tho' still they freeze, whose Zenith is the Pole. His Beams wou'd quickly burn the parched Grains, Did not the Ev'ning Dews refresh the Plains, And Noon-day Vapours turn to Mid-night Rains: Earth's kindly Surface ope's her cooling Poers; Clear pearly Drops, sit on the Tops o' Flow'rs; And rising Morn regal with healthful Showrs. Sol's burning Wheels a hot Mid-Summer made, Swains leave the sunny Braes, for milder Shade; Soft Nymphs, to flow'ry Arbours, do repair To be refresh'd, with fanning Zephyres there: In crystal Streams, they sport the hotter Hours, Whose gaudy Borders smell of Gilly-Flowers: 'Twas July in her Pride, when th'Earth looks gay, More sanguine grow'n than in her youthful May, To golden fin'ry chang'd her silver Gray. Her Azure Robes and ruddy Cheeks appear; The sweetest laughing Month in all the Year: Nature exerts her utmost at this Time; Her Youth's run off, and she is in her Prime. Hyperions Daughter with her rosy Feet, Eight Hours and more, had made her dark Retreat To Titan's watry Couch, where Sea-Gods are, Usher'd by Lucifer, the Morning-Star. Long had her Brother Titan burry'd Night, The Welkin cloathed with Meridian Light; When bussy Mortals to the Fields resort; Some to their Labours, others to their Sport. In Woods are heard the mournful Lovers Cries; At fair Corrinna's Feet her Damon lies Off'ring fresh Vows, sent up with ardent Sighs. Strephon with Nosegays complimenss his Phillis: Didon in Madrigals his Amaryllis. Adonis in a Grove t'express his Flame, Engraves upon a Beech his fair Nymphs Name, Four magick Letters carves upo' the Tree, Cloe the Name he gives the charming She: He thinks each Letter mystery contains, Such is the Phrensie of the Love-sick Swains: To make the Draught complete he adds an Heart; And little Cupid peircing 'twith his Dart. Beneath the Hawthorn Hedge, glader than Kings, The merry Stroller with his Doxie sings: With artless Notes, like Chanticlere they crow, The Song concludes, A begging we will go. In new shav'd Meadows, all the heat of Day, Young John and Jenny, wrestle 'mong the Hay With mutual Pastime, spend their lazy Hours; She falls beneath him on a Bed o' Flow'rs. In warm Embraces sinks 'mongst nat'ral Sweets; A Bed beyond the Down, with Holland Sheets They tug, and toy, and guzzle; O! they're glad! She clasps the trim, the yellow-headed Lad. He tickling, tempts her to the unblest Feast: Jenny dare not comply, she minds the Priest. At length, by rude Intruders they are seen; Jenny scours off, and wants her Gown o' Green. Then he pursues the Lass he late embrac'd, Stretching his Arms, to grasp her round the Wast She gives the Slip; he tumbles down for hast. A wither'd toothless Hag stands looking on, Who lov'd the Sport herself, crys, Till her, John: He jumps to's Feet, and takes a nimbler Race; Jenny loves to be catched in the Chase. Holding her fast, he throws her on the Grass, Lies down himself, and courts his buxom Lass: Glutting his Eyes with gazing on her Charms, They chat, and fall asleep in others Arms. Lyrus lies near the Brook, 'mongst Rows of Ews; The rhiming Bard their rustick Dalliance views, Thinks it a proper Subject for his Muse. SONG. At the Root of the green Willow, Grassy Banks their Couch and Pillow, John and Jenny lay: In her Bosom, He'll repose him, Tir'd with Sport and Play. Her plump Arms are round her Jewel; Can so fair a Nymph be cruel, To a Lad so gay? Her Breasts are white like Lilly Leaves, Her Lips like Roses red; Her Breath a sweeter Perfume gives, Than e'er Dianas did, &amp;c. Cupid, was on the Ramble all this Day, (When Gods descend none blyther are than they:) This Paphian God takes many a phrentick Fit, So thick his Arrows fly, so sure they hit; They wound the Fops, and Fools, and Men o' Wit. He'll arbitrary Government display; Ev'n o'er the Men of Morals will he sway: For Beaux and Belles, do easily obey. There's one wrap'd up in Thought, walkes all alone, Studying how many Ways to slice a Cone; Peeping thro' Glasses, to himself he Swears, That Saturn's Motion, a resemblance bears Unto the Curve, that he had lately drawn, And on the truth thereof, his Life he'd pawn: Call'd Ptolemy a Fool, and Tycho mad, And with him, all the rest were ev'n as bad. Runs thro' a tedious Scheme, and he can prove, That all the Planets in Ellipseis move: For Nature must have fram'd and made it so, Else Gods themselves, did not Equations know. Cupid enrag'd, when sawcy Mr. Euclid, As if the Gods had never ope'd a Book lid, Arraign'd cœlestial Pow'rs with Want of Knowledge, (Should Gods descend, and pass their Course at College; Have all the Whimseys taught them of this droll Age) Lets fly his Arrows at the Math'matician; Makes Wounds cannot be cur'd by learn'd Physician: He soon forgets the Heavens, where his Trade is, And quickly falls to courting of the Ladies: Throws by his Globs and Astrolabs, he's stupid; Such is the fatal Government of Cupid; And gazes on each Face whose under Part is hooped. But tush, says th'Urchine, where's the gain to wound An Addle-pate, whose Brains before turn'd round, No Man by this can know right what my Pow'r is; I'll try the Doctors utriusque juris. Grave Aulus and Prioli he inspires, Tho chil'd with Age, they're scroch'd with vi'lent Fires: Magnetick Love, doth the old Judges draw From musty Books, and noding o'er the Law. They're Lovers grown, obey the Paphian God; Read new Romances, and forget the Code: Collect Loves Ditties, to compose an Ode. Seek out for Numbers, beautiful and strong; Susanna, is the Burthen of the Song. In vain for Justice, Client Mævius cries, Whose Process still, at Avisandum lies: Prioli says, I find your Libel's lame, It wants,—stay,—let me see,—Susanna's Name; I'll write Acrosticks on't, and Anagrams; Engrave them deeply on the tallest Palms. Susanna, all the Female-Sex excells; Her Breath, like the Hesperian Garden smells. Confounded Mævius, star'd him in the Face: Says, O! my Lord! you quite mistake my Case! For my Defendant's Name's Elisabeth: I want her Gold, my Lord, and not her Breath. Prioli was asham'd, and quickly said, Have patience, Sir, To-morrow I'll decide; Excuse my wand'rings, I'll consider't better; I think at present on a higher Matter. Mævius gave short Salutes, and took the Door, Damning Susanna for a common Whore. Love makes the Judge a Fool, says he, He's mad: His Head is turn'd to Balls, and Serenad. More pitiable Case, Man never saw; Prioli plagu'd with Love, Mæv'us with Law. 'Tis true, the Women, greatest Heroes sway; They Solomon the Wise did lead astray: In a Love-passion, ev'n the Stagyrite Gave way to Nature, banish'd Reason quite. Seneca's Morals, weak Barriers did prove; For he was banish'd for adult'rous Love. The Cynick his Morseness did neglect, Laugh'd at the sullen Maxims of his Sect. So here, Don Quixot, that renowned Knight, When he, and Sancho, with Wind-Mills did fight, Was not by half so gross a Bedlamite, As was our Judge; Her Eyes, her ev'ry Part, Says he, was made to furnish Cupid's Dart: Vanquish'd by her, it is my Glory sure; O! She's too good to wound, and not to cure! Love is the noblest Passion of the Souls; Stronger than Laws, doth strictest Rules controul! It baffles all the churlish Stoick's Art, And finds a Way unto the wisest Heart! Nor Bombs, nor Cannons, kill like Womens Eyes: It's Beauty gains the greatest Victories! Beauty can make the noblest. Victor yield; It conquers these who conquer in the Field: Come Brother Aulus, since we are in Love, We'll hate the simple Innocence o'th' Dove; Like the old Serpent, subtile be and wise, Seduce the Beauty, in her Paradise. Incog, the aged Lover's nimbly go; Impetuous Love with Strength supplies the Slow: Scroch'd with the Sun, and Loves superiour Heat, They breathless run; yet curse their tardy Feet. Scramble o'er Ditches, and the Garden-Wall, With Lovers hast, down in a Pool they fall: Poor dabbled Aulus, swat'ring thro' the Pond, Says, I was burn'd before, but now I'm drown'd. Prioli wish'd he'd never seen a Woman, Takes this Disaster for a fatal Omen; A sure Presage that moe Malheurs are coming: Am'rous Leander, was not more afraid Swimming the Hellespont, to his fair Maid. Conceal'd from Light, the aged Lovers lay, Skreen'd by the Shade of Oaks, more old than they: Here's Eden, Aulus says, the Serpent we; My dear Susanna, the forbidden Tree. The fairest Plants which in the Garden grows, These nat'ral Wilds, and artificial Shows I loath; they seem to me the Works of Chance: But she can kindle Darkness with a Glance, Her Face too bright; for Sense, like Heav'n doth intrance. The happy Hour approach'd, Susanna came, Two gentle Nymphs attend the lovely Dame; Not in her killing Dress, altho 'twas Noon, Loosely attir'd, she's wrapt in Morning-Gown: A thousand Cupids dance around the Belle, Her ev'ry Look, and ev'ry Smiles a Spell. Faint with inclement Air, and scorching Beams, Susanna hasts to bath in cooling Streams; With all the Air that Nature can bestow, The charming Fair doth to her Orchard go: Her Presence adds new Luster to the Place, Decaying Plants rise up with fresher Grace; And new fall'n Leaves resume a Summers Face. Jes'mine, and prideful Tulips deck her Path; Diffuse their Smells sweet, as her perfum'd Breath. Fond by the Fair Susanna to be trod, Lillies and Damask-Roses pave the Road; With spicy Robes the shady Groves do smell; From Thickets where the sweet-tongu'd Bird do dwell, Echo repeats the Notes of Philomel. Mavis and Lark, with Musick round her throng, Whil'st Valley's lowly Voice return the Song; And wanton Zephyres, on her Lips do play, Steal with their Wings th'ambrosial Breath away: Rich Treasure which can cool the Summers Heat, Make sultry Air and scroching Noon smell sweet. Phenix, Arabia's Bird, with Grief's oppress'd, To see another Phenix in the East Of orient Colour, beautiful and young, Admiring from whose Ashes she is sprung: Proud Bird, she'd gladly leave the spicy East, And all her Citron Groves for her warm Breast, Fittest of all, to be a Phenix-Nest. Jupiter saw her, take the blessful Bow'r, And did design another golden Show'r, More tempting than Alc'mena to a Rape, He'd quit his Heav'n to lie in Susan's Lap. Knowing 'twas vain t'assume the Shape of Man; Sometimes he thought once more t'inform a Swan: Sport in Susanna's Arms, gaze on her Eyes; Mix with her lovely Limbs, and Iv'ry Thighs, Swim in her Bosom, 'bove the golden Sands; Steal silent Kisses from her Lips and Hands; Work Wonders: 'Till at last he warm the Stream, Move her to listen to the pleasant Theme: And when he's charm'd her with his Tales of Love; How dazling Beauty drew him from above: He'll drop his Feathers and commence a Jove. As much as Lillies, Hemlocks do surpass Flowr's in their vernal Airs, the wither'd Grass; Or fiery Courser, the dull scouling Ass. Low bending Vines loaden with sacred Juce, The humble Osier, or the Bramble Bush; As much as Hero, the fam'd Sestian Nun Outshin'd the Æthiop, taunny'd with the Son, Above her Sex, doth fair Susanna shine; Adorn'd with Virtue and with Charms divine. Her Hair of yellow Cast, curles at her Ear; Her Fore-head smooth and white, Eyes black and clear: Bright burning Lamps, which rays like Phœbus Dart, Rays which cou'd fire the coldest Hermite's Heart: Stars from their lucent Orbs, in frosty Night Glance not like these; faint is their trembling Light. Ears short and round, but high and hook'd her Nose; Which still with sweet and pow'rful Odours blows; Her Cheeks are Crimson, like the blushing Rose. Lips thin and red, and dimpled is her Chin; Whiter than Flakes of Snow, her Teeth and Skin. Her fragrant Breath smells like the flow'ry Spring; To kiss her Month were banquet for a King. Her Voice is sweeter Musick than the Flute; To hear her sing, you'd wish the Syrens mute. Her well turn'd Neck rich Beauties doth contain; The Blood runs smiling through the azure Vein: That crimson Blood is prouder of her Veins, Than is Euphrates of its flow'ry Plains. Her Charms the rigid Stagyrite could move; A look of her wou'd spoil platonick Love. Betty, she says, run back, and bring these Sweets, The Balls and Oil, perfum'd my nuptial Sheets: They near the Patch-box, on the Toilet ly; Go with her little Vennie, prithee fly. Upon a mossy Bank the Beauty lay, Her Vail thrown off, did half an Heav'n display; The Beauty of her Face eclips'd the Splendour of the Day. Her golden Tresses eddy Winds do blow, In careless Ringlets round her Shoulders flow, Arch Cupid steals them for to fledge his Bow. From off her Iv'ry Arms he pulls the Glove, Her Arms the killing Implements of Love; Whiter than Paros Rocks they'd charm a Jove. The Wimple next, which round her Neck she wears Throws by, and her warm rising Breast appears: There Cupid reigns in his Imperial Chair, 'Mongst Arrows, Darts, and Flames of Paphian Fire, She gazes on the Brook, which does reflect, The stately Structure of her lofty Neck. Her long white Arm descends, pulls of the Shoes, Which hid the well turn'd Foot, and handsom Toes; From th'Empyreum Jove stoops down to see The lovely Object, Beauty cap-a-pe. The Fair proceeds, and now the Garter's drawn, The Petticoat turn'd up above the Brawn, A lovely Landskip opens to the Eye; There little Cupid's Paradise doth ly. But stop licentious Muse, no further go; Beauty hath Secrets which we must not know. The Painter draws Dianna to the Wast; Dashes the Canvass, and conceals the Rest. She views her Image in the liquid Wave, Fair as in Paradise, the new form'd Eve, Whom GOD transplanted from Adamah's Side; The crooked Rib, turn'd to a beauteous Bride. She takes the Flute, her Song is divine Love, The dorick Musick consecrates the Grove; Transporting Lyricks fill the divine Ode, Such Notes hath Gabriel, warbling Hymns to GOD; A Song of Zion, for Elysium fit, A Song like these, the inspired Prophet wrot: Who touch'd the Strings when Saul was sore oppress'd, Banish'd the sullen Dæmon from his Breast. The mallad Swan and Langa, round her throng, List'ning unto the instrumental Song, Melodious, like the Musick of her Tongue: She sings to heav'nly Quires; the Anthem flew, Such Musick Nicolini never knew: The Chorus was, Heav'n always guards the Fair, Beauty's always Heave'ns Care. Boiling with Lust, the Senators prepare To rifle all the Sweetness of the Fair; They from their Ambush rush, with youthful Rage, A full Enjoyment must their Flames asswage: Sometime they speechless stood, then Silence broke; With rev'rend Cringes, thus Prioli spoke, “Immortal Beauty! Heav'ns Master-Piece! “All Majesty! Thy Shape! Thy Angels Face! “Which all Men do adore, and they admire, “Hath kindled in our Breasts Idalian Fire. “We burn, we burn, with Love, with Love to you, “O! Seraph's Figure, at they Feet we bow! “We feel your Pow'r Divine; 'tis therefore Duty, “T'approach and bow before the Shrine of Beauty. “Your Bosom is all Bliss, a Heav'n of Rest, “Yet raises Storms and Tempests in our Breast, “On bended Knees we'll die upon the Ground, “Unless that you who gave, do cure the Wound: “All Natures Excellence centers in you, “Thy Match She ne'er in all her Dramma drew: “Like Sol's superior Light, you was design'd “To warm our Orb, and shine upon Mankind. “When we gaze on the Sun in's beauteous Pride, “Like you, he doth not blush and hide his Heed; “No, he returns love Looks, obliging Kind, “Free, unlike yours, like yours they strike us blind; “No Eye beholds us in the lonely Grove, “The Favour grant, and yield to conquering Love. “Impatient of Delay, “I'll on thy panting blooming Bosom ly, “And bath my Lips in Kisses till I dy. Like Niobe, all Tears Susanna stood, Confusion seiz'd her Soul, and chill'd her Blood: Pale dying Looks, her Agonies declare, Horrour, and all the Symptomes of Despair, She wounds her throbing Breast, tears her dishevel'd Hair Ah, have I Pow'r to speak Susanna cries! And Beauty blubbers from her modest Eyes; I'm mad, has that no Force; O pitty me! Rip up my Breast, and end my Misery: Severe is your Demand, I'll ne'er comply, Soften your Cruelty or else I dy. Fast from her Cheeks, the blushing Roses flew, And pale Revenge sat brooding on her Brow: “Dear Husband come, she says, thou'rt only mine, “Shall I surrender up what's only thine? “Just Heav'n, the constant Friend of Innocence, “Exert resistless Pow'r in my Defence: “Against their guilty Heads thy Thunder play, “These Criminals let thy Artil'ry slay: “Your Arrows shoot, nor draw your Bow in vain; “Let me behold these crim'nal Judges slain. “Shall thy loud roaring Cannons of the Sky, “Thy Implements of War, ly idly by? “Sulph'rous Light'ning flash around their Head; “Ye Thunders roll, and strick the Rascals Dead: “I roave, all Sense is gone, I'll fly-away, “Or, turn and tear the Villains if I stay. “Stronger than I, a Jest, it can't be true; “What cannot Innocence, when join'd with Madness do? “The Doors are shut, I'll face th'audacious Foe, “Lift my weak Arm, and Heav'n will lend the Blow; “To whom I've sent warm Prayers with ardent Cries, “By th'Ev'ning and the Morning Sacrifice: “Their Vot'rie's Limbs have cripl'd been with Prayer, “My Heart and Heav'ns pure Law, my constant Care. “My Virgin Vows have reach'd GOD's bending Ear, “Daily Auditor of my Wedlock Prayer. “Shall I my dear Deliverer distrust, “Who in the darkest Dangers save the Just? “Upon his naked Promise I'll rely; “He's God of Truth, sure Truth it self can't lie. Aulus replies, “O Fountain of our Joy, “Springing with fresh Delights, O don't prove Coy; “Shake off these Qualms of Conscience, childish Fears, “The Jaundice of the Mind young Childrens Bugbears; “We frighten Fools with puny Conscience, “A Story ne're believ'd by Men of Sense; “Tho' they concur to carry on the Cheat, “Bogle the Vulgar from the Gentries Meat. “Freedom being each Man's Birth-Right is the Cause, “We bridle Nature by our penal Laws: “The Dreg we allow, a single Dish for Food; “Varieties reserv'd to Men of Blood. “For Proof I shall a Royal Instance bring, “David a learn'd and religious King, “From his exalted Roof, beheld the Fair, “(Surely his Tut'lar Angel led him there,) “Bathsheba bathing in the Brook below; “(A naked Beauty is a glorious Show,) “Viewing her Limbs, and all beneath the Wast, “He run, and almost broke his Neck for hast: “Commands the Watch to bring her Pris'ner in, “The Royal Prince, commits the Royal Sin. “The naked Bride climbs to Imperial State, “And from that Hour became a Prince's Mate. “'Tis true a peevish Priest rebuk'd him for't; “'Twas well he came not soon, he'd spoil'd the Sport. “David made Faces, Whines; but when he's gone, “Kisses the Mother of his Solomon. “Why is a lying Pow'r to Priesthood given, “They scar with Hell, till to Despair we're driv'n; “Then lull asleep with pleasant Dreams of Heav'n. “Madam, don't you see thro' the thin Device; “The late invented Names of Virtue, Vice. “The well-bred Man a Life of Pleasure lives, “Freely enjoys what lavish Nature gives; “Ranges without controul, and laughs at Fools “Ty'd up to dull ecclesiastick Rules, “Phlegmatick Gibbrish of the canting Schools: “Religion's just a Bugbear like the Law, “A State Engine, to keep the World in Aw. “Tho petty Lords, with Gravity of Pride, “And furly Looks their Vassals do diride; “The Royal Sov'reign smiles on ev'ry Face, “Receives their Homage with a God-like Grace: “Subord'nate Judges, Prince's common Tools, “Punish each Thing against establish'd Rules; “But clement Princes whom no Fear doth Aw, “Boldly contemn the Terrors of the Law. “Madam, despise dull Tales of Innocence, “That flows from Rudeness and a Want of Sense: “The Greatness and the Beauty of the Mind, “Appears in Things that's gentle, sweet and kind. Then softly to her self Susanna said, I'm almost Calm, my stormy Passions laid: O then I'll try what Eloquence can do, With low Submissions at their Feet I'll bow; Grave Judges I must speak my Mind to you: The grave Dispensers of the Law you are, Then hear a Female Pleader at your Bar. “Rude Men, will ye debauch Joacim's Wife, “Who's Bosom is the Solace of his Life: “My Virtue cropt, will not Joacim say, “I'll throw her like a wither'd Weed away, “Your Motive hath no Force; What's Privicy? “The supreme Legislator, GOD, is nigh: “No Solitude excludes his peircing Eye. “Your Guilt will stretch your Conscience on the Rack, “You'll be arraign'd, and punish'd for the Fact. “Dare you, O Judges, break thro' Virtue's Rules? “Shall God's Vicegerents turn the Devil's Tools? “Virtue abolish'd, Anguish and Cheeks remains, “Sathan usurps its Room, the Empire gains; “He manacles the Soul with adamantine Chains. “With bosom Rackets, bandy'd too and fro, “Where shall the helpless, hopeless Sinner go? “To penal Fire, amongst the damn'd below. “Plung'd deep in Guilt, Hell triumphs in his Fall, “The Sinner's Heart is bitter as the Gall: “Pleasure is grafted upon Innocence; “Virtue doth Joy, and Peace, and Love dispense. “Who would not amiable Virtue love, “Which makes us look on Earth, like Saints above: “Repent in time your Wickedness of Heart, “Virtue's the Life, and ornamental Part. “Check these Emotions doth your Souls invade, “And hate the hellish lothsome Plot you've laid: “You know the Statute-Books, When was't you saw, “Rape and Adult'ry privileged by Law? “Scandal to ermine Robes, and Judgement-Seat, “Turn City-Rakes, Intrigue with vain Cocquet. “Prioli, who by's Looks a Saint did seem, Says, “Are you Captive to the Clergies Dream, “Adult'ry, silly Cant, a holly Whim: “The Word was never heard before the Flood, “Broach'd since by sneevling Priests in angry Mood. “The niggard Cassock, grudg'd it to the Clown, “Some plead it is annex'd unto the Crown, “And others give it only to the Gown. “The Crown and Crozier, lawless Pow'r do take, “Plebeians dare not do't for Conscience sake. “Mothers debauch our Minds with gloomy Fears, “The Child drinks in the driry Tales it hears; “Which Priests confirm for Truths in riper Years. “O Priestcraft Juggle! all an hocus pocus; “Priests laugh themselves alone, when thus they mock us: “Our Natures planted by the Pow'rs above, “With one governing Law, and that is Love. “Love has no Limits set by 'ndulgent Heav'n, “Plain is the Text, corrupt's the Gloss that's given. “But grant the Legends of the Priests were true, “And all we've said still disbeliev'd by you; “In granting our Requests, you'll virtuous Actions do. “Illustrious Fair, we die of Love you see, “Our Cure would be an act of Charity: “We die of mortal Wounds, your Beauty gave, “Turn pious, save two Lovers from the Grave. “On th'Altar of thy Lips, (O nameless Bliss) “I'll offer the Oblation of a Kiss; “A Bless for which the Choirs above do pant, “O let me take Possession of my Saint: “Will your dull Dotard be the worse of this? “He'll know no Loss, and we'll enjoy a Bliss. But here Susanna doth her Part begin “O could my Face turn lothsom as your Sin, “Boyl hot my Blood, and blister all my Skin. “My Charms to Heav'n I willingly restore, “Bless me with all the Wrinkles of Fourscore: “When Beauties blasted, they'll insist no more. “Yes Judges, I'll comply, “When tyrant Wolfs with peaceful Lambs do sleep, “When Day and Night no more their Order keep; “And Mountains from their solid Basis leap. “Bid the Poles meet, and Phœbus shine no more; “Forbid the Fire to burn, the Sea to roar; “Command the stormy Winds no more to blow, “Discharge proud Babel's Streams from hence to flow. “The dying Saint approaching Heav'n to love, “And burning Seraphs from their Seats above; “Rains to descend, upwards the Smoak to fly, “And when all these obey you, so will I. “Know cruel Fair, that if we don't prevail, “(Aulus the Lawyer never wants his Tale) “We'll vent our Spleen in Scandals 'gainst thy Name; “Load thee with Crimes, and everlasting Shame. “We'll make the World believe you worst of Whores, “Womens Revenge shall be a Jest to ours. “We'll prove the Libel, which our Malice fram'd; “Your Sex shall blush to hear Susanna nam'd. “We'll say, we saw you with a lusty Youth, “(And, if we say't, the World will think it Truth.) “He keep'd the Assignation you had made, “And Impudence convey'd you to the Shade; “There violate the Vows of Marriage-Bed. “Dismiss'd your Maids, that they might see no Ill; “Suffer'd the brawny Rogue to work his wicked Will. “O were I Vile (the dear Susanna cries) “To ev'ry Sight, save my Joacim's Eyes; “O could my Face turn Lothsom as their Sin, “Boyl hot my Blood, and blister all my Skin. “My Charms to Heav'n, I willingly restore, “Bliss me with all the Wrinkles of Fourscore; “Were Beauty blasted, they'd insist no more. Her Speech was interrupt, a Noise was heard, The Garden Doors flew up, and Men appear'd. Aulus like subtile Fox sneak'd to the Door, “Ah Boy, he says, your Lady is a Whore; “I, and my rev'rend Colleague walking here, “We saw a Youth with feather'd Hat draw near, “He embrac'd her in his Arms, O vicious Age! Go you be damn'd old B?r, says the Page. He hears his Lady cry, he sees her weep, He jumps o'er many Bushes at a Leap. The lusty Butler with his Feet and Fist, Beat Aulus and Prioli till they Pist: With bruised Bones, they hoble out the Way, Cursing the Stars for this unhappy Day: 'Twould mov'd a Tygar for to hear their Groans, Their Heart do ake with Love, their Flesh with broken Bones But ah! What humane Eloquence can tell Susanna's Grief, 'tis like the Pains of Hell? Moistn'd with Tears her Checks no longer gay, With secret Fires her Heart consumes away: Approaching Trouble doth augment her Pain, She can't conceal her Grief, she must complain. O miserable Woman! sad's my Case! How dare I look Joacim in the Face? That Face, dear Feace, which I so oft have kiss'd; And thought my self in his Embraces bless'd. Alas! that Face will smile on me no more, He'll call me Strumpet, and adult'rous Whore. Can I believe good natur'd Soul, that he Will ever entertain bad Thoughts of me? Can such a pious Soul have room for Jealousie? Oft I remember, when I've done amiss, Sussy, he'd say, and then he'd give a Kiss: I can't believe't a Fault, my Loves so strong, But had another don't I'd thought it wrong. I will not be so prodigal of Tears, To spend my Fund for Sin on needless Fears: I'll bear with Patience Heav'ns afflicting Rod, And trust a smiting, as a smiling GOD: Tho my Dear kill me, to his Arms I'll go, And dying bless the Hand which gave the Blow. Homewards the Lady went 'twixt Hope and Fear, But her belov'd Joacim was not there: She praying kept her Closet till he came, Wrestling with God for a spiritual Frame. Ere he arriv'd, the Day was almost gone, And Night her sable Garments putting on: From Ærebus arose the drousie God, Who fright'ned Phœbus to the Antipod: In sable Garments, and a Mourning-Coach, Nights Emp'ror deck'd with Stars makes slow approach, Dark pitchy Clouds compose his rev'rend Train, Sleep, Dreams, and Night-Mares, which disturb the Brain: Thick Vapours, massy Mists, do load the Skies, Somnus arrests the Limbs and seals the Eyes. Screech Owls and Bats, Birds still asham'd of Day, And stalking Ghosts of Lovers lead the Way; Nor quaking Duck, nor noisy Chanticleer, Nor gaggling Goose, nor wakeful Dog appear: No piercing Sun-Beam, not the smallest Ray, Dare cherish Nature in her deep Decay. All hush'd and still, did ev'ry Creature ly, As if Dame Nature were resolv'd to die; Nor Fox, nor proling Wolf, dare stir abroad: All must be hush'd till Nature take her Nod. Kings on their lazy Downs take soft Repose, In th'Arms of Morpheus, Slaves forget their Woes: Rivers with silent Pace do murmuring flow, They lull asleep their Pebles as they go; And Winds to rock the Leaves do murmuring flow. Yet cannot Sleep invade the Lover's Breast, Tumbling upon the Couch, with Grief oppress'd, Sad Aulus and Prioli find no Rest. Thro' all the balmy Night they sleepless ly, Till fresher Air proclaims the Morning nigh; They curse the Morning for her cruel Stay, Despairing by her long unkind Delay: Night seems an Age, their Souls are tun'd to Grief, But Morning came, and brought a fresh Releif. Welcom Aurora leaps from Titan's Bed, Gilding the eastern Skies, makes Mortals glad: Her chearful Cheeks dy'd with a blushing Red, Smiles at young Memnon snoring in his Bed. Healths in her Hand, Mirth sits upon her Brow; Her Eyes pour forth thick Drops of pearly Dew; The merry Lark attends her golden Coach, Awakes the World with Mirth at her Approach. Who clothes the Welkin with meridian Light, Banishes from our Hemisphere the Night: When all her glorious Ornaments are on, In solemn Pomp she ushers in the Sun, To make his daily Progress thro' the Skies; Who summons all the lazy World to rise. Swains wind their Horns, to welcom new-born Day, And Lambs bear Treble with their kindly Mae: The toiling Farmer hath his Task begun, He like his Grandsire reckons by the Sun. But Citizens contemn that vulgar Way, With them the eight Hour-Bell begins the Day; Then drousy Drunkard coughing on his Cod, Hoasts up the Phlegm of his last Ev'nings Load. Old Toast knocks at the Door, he is let in, Then Ev'nings Guilt begins the Mornings Sin. From Col'nel's Arms, Miss wak'd by reeling Carts, After a brush or two, unseen departs. Sand, Broom and Butter, crying on the Streets, Command the Kitchen-Wench to leave her Sheets: Half naked, scratching down the Stairs scours she, Meeting the Maid with Milk for Morning-Tea. Back she returns, awakes the Chamber-Maid, The bygone Quarters-Compt is to be paid: The Girl starts up, plagues Day for coming on; For she was dreaming of her sweet Miss John. The City Emmets, get into their Hive, Ballance Accompts, and wealthy Bargains drives. Wak'd by a Fee, which grees'd his griping Paw, The Gown-Man hastens to the Seat of Law: Within the Spot, the Camp of Gowned-War, Judge Aulus and Prioli fac'd the Bar. Swoln with Revenge, Terror is in their Eyes, Which blaze like fiery Comets in the Skies: Revenge is now become their darling Food, They'll quench their Fever with a Draught of Blood: Destruction plot, with Wrath their Veins do swell, Auxiliary Helps they seek from Hell: Like honest Sons, their Fathers Counsel crave, Who ruin'd the first Lady, Mother Eve. O fatal Aple! strange Effect of Fruit! To poison all the Branches and the Root! Fully instructed are these Sons of Sathan, Have all his Counsel got by Heart verbatim. Susanna's Cause comes in by Course of Roll, The Clerk stands up, and reads the lying Scroll: The Evidence is call'd, Aulus appears; (Aulus, who's old in Wickedness and Years) Upon the Pannel's Head his Hand doth streach, Bows to the Bench, and makes this solemn Speech: My Lords, “Prioli, and my self, of late “Visit'd Joacim's pleasant Country-Seat; “A Magazine of Beauty catch'd our Eye, “We did in ev'ry little Labyrinth pry. “Nature, with Master-Strokes laid the Design, “Th'Embellishment of Art complete the Scene: “Fret Works, Parteres, and Colonies of Trees, “Fresh beauteous Objects still arrest our Eyes, “Thro' grotesque Mazes of Delights we pass, “But ah! ev'n there, the Sneak lurks in the Grass. “Wearied, we rested on an easy Fen, “(Heav'ns deep Designs ly hid from humane Ken.) “'Twas Pleasure only led us there, we thought; “But we were for a nobler Purpose brought: “God's Providence which guides his wand'ring Flock, “Is like the Serpents wand'rings on the Rock, “Which never Eye could trace, his Windings know; “No Foot can with that nimble Traveller go: “Providence seems a ravel'd Hasp; for we “A Wheel within a Wheel, can never see; “Yet all Things work for the Creator's Glory, “Which leads me to relate the fatal Story. “Our Sight was hunting o'er the Works of Nature, “When we beheld this charming guilty Creature, “Like Eve in Paradise, Empress of All, “(Which now she justly forfeites by her Fall,) “Enter a Tarras-Walk which fronts the Dome; “Two Maids were with her, but she sent 'em Home: “Loth to depart, they long her Patience vex; “She frown'd them off, and met the other Sex. “A tall broad Shoulder'd brawny Youth drew nigh, “He kneel'd, as if before a Deity: “She act'd a vitious Part, she hug'd the Youth; “He oggling squeez'd her Hands, and kiss'd her Mouth. “No Words they spoke, for all was done by Signs; “Lew'd Indications of their lewder Minds: “Billing like Doves, they dropt beneath a Shade, “Tasted the Pleasures of a Marriage-Bed: “Renew'd the Crimes, as if it were no Fault, “Of Stollen Waters took a lusty Draught. “These Eyes of mine beheld them do it there, “And all, my Lords, I've said, I freely swear: Sworn and dismiss'd, Prioli doth succeed, His leach'rous Hand lays on the Lady's Head. “My Lords, he says, Judge Aulus went with me “Joacim's pleasant Gardens for to see, “Uncommon Scenes lay open to our View; “Rich Landskip as e'er Nature's Pencil drew; “Nature and Art, their Figures cut so well, “With Master-Strokes, each labours to excell: “Amidst the Pomp and grand Magnificence, “The well wrought Statues most deceiv'd the Sense. “Near th'east Side of the Dome, we cast our Eye “Upon three Statues, which we thought drew nigh: “That in the midst lookt like Joacim's Wife; “Those are not made of Stones, said I, they've life. “Two made retreat, the third she forward ran, “To meet a Statue in the Shap of Man. “Aulus, said I, we're on enchanted Ground, “Or here's a Lady and her Lover found: “Lock'd in each others Arms we saw them bow, “And act the Thing, which Statues cannot do, “The old fashion'd Thing the C?h in Marriage doth allow. “We rose, they run, and made a quick Retreat, “I'm sure the D?l lent the Rogue his Feet. Thus they depos'd, and then they smiling stand, To see the Sentence sign'd by Milo's Hand. The hollow Depmster, with an ugly Gloom, Pronounc'd the bloody Word, I give't for Doom. Stoicks may boast of Fortitude of Mind, Draw Schemes and Figures to amuse Mankind: Talk big of Conquest o'er Corruption got, And please themselves with the delusive Thought: 'Tis but a golden Dream, a Scene of Woes Epictetus himself will discompose. Senecas Morals can't afford Relief, Their acted Bravery, won't remove the Grief: Reasoning, and high Resolves, are all in Vain, When once immers'd in Misery and Pain. Can one upon the Rack, Passion discard? 'Twill smite him from his artificial Guard: Rufle his Temper were he ne'er so Meek, Morals is no Prescription for the Sick. Man's corrupt Heart, no Self-support can yield; Who trusts in that, will surely loss the Field. Can weary Pilgrims Feet securely stand, Upon the Quagmire, or the sinking Sand: A higher Principle must fire the Soul; We're ne'er secure till on our God we roll: Ropose on Him, ev'n when we see no Light, On God cast Anchor, in the darkest Night: Upon an All-sufficient God depend, Believers Benefactor, and their Friend. 'Twas Faith in God that made Susanna brave, She stood like unmov'd Rocks, 'twixt Wind and Wave; Ev'n when she look'd for Gibbet and a Grave. Hypocrisie a gloomy Influence shades: Truth sits upon the Brow, and Gladness spreads. Hypocrisie is hollow, and unsound: Integrity the firm substantial Ground. The honest Face is plain, no painting there; Few Plots hath Truth, but all her Plots sincere. Truth hath such naked Charms, so matchless sweet, They can't be copied by the Hypocrite; Some Flaw discovers, till the artful Cheat. Virtue, like th'ancient legal Ointment is; None imitated that, none truly this. God prescrib'd both, his Signature they bear; All diff'rent Compounds, diff'rant Figures wear. The Hypocrite, dull languid Motion makes, His Heart's untouch'd, for all the Pains he takes: But heav'nly Gales the virtuous Soul doth move, Which ventilates, and blows the Flame of Love: Hypocrisie contracts, there is no Room within, The Heart is fetter'd and enthral'd by Sin. Virtue delates the Heart, sublimes the Mind, An elevating Joy the Virtuous find Disburden'd of their Load, they leap for Joy; Nought can their Pleasure Damp, their Peace annoy. Integrity is bold, doth fear no Wrath; With Looks compos'd, can meet approaching Death: Smiles up to Heav'n, and Heav'n smiles down again, The virtuous Soul finds Joy in midst of Pain. With infant Sweetness, unto Heav'n appeals: A lasting Friend, when every Creature fails. Strong Proof of this, see in Joacim's Wife; Sentenc'd to dy, she appeals the Spring of Life: She rolls her self on God, to Him she flys, Aloud to Heaven the pious Pannel cries. A sacred Silence, struck the suppliant Crowd; The perjur'd Judges, in Convulsions stood, While she darts up a Pray'r, as sweet, as loud. With so much Ardor, is the Insence sent, (All saw the Devotee was Innocent,) Pours out a holy Gush with Angels Air; Zeal dictates Words, she needs not common Prayer. “O everlasting God! whose all-seeing Eye, “Thro' thickest Mists, and Mid-Night Shades can pry, “The Night and Light are both alike to thee; “All Things ly open to a Deitie. “Thou knows, (from whom no Secret can be hid,) “All my Designs, all that I ever did: “My Words, my Works, my Thoughts, my Innocence, “Without being told by humane Eloquence. “Thy Knowledge doth my secret Struggles reach, “My embryo Thoughts confus'd, unripe for Speech; “Thou knows, these Judges have depos'd a Lye, “By whose black Affidavits I must dye: “In bloom of Youth, they've cut Susanna down, “Death's Scyth must mow the Flower before 'tis June. “Sentence is past, I can no longer live, “Unless, my God, you grant a kind Reprive; “I've Ground to seek, my God hath Pow'r to give. “Just Heav'n, Susanna doth appeal to you: “A Thing which none save virtuous Souls dare do. Sighs mingling with her Tears, found out their Way; The Audience thought her very Words did Pray. A Troop of sowr-look'd Villains, guard the Place, Ruffian in Black and White, with Gibbet Face, Fetters the Fair, of Womenkind the Chief, Her Looks dart Glory in the midst of Grief; Her Passion kindles almost unto Wrath, Their Bayonets and Looks are worse than Death. When she beholds the Man she loves so well, Press thro' the Guards, to take his last Farewell, She rails against the Judge, doth Murder cry, What? Will you force the Innocent to dy? All know Susanna is a virtuous Wife, For God's Sake and Joacim's, save my Life: She checks herself again for doing so, Doth this become a Child of God to do? Can I delight my Honour to survive? I injur'd fall, yet dying I'll forgive. Strengthen me Lord, with thy spiritual Pow'r, In the last Combat, in my dying Hour: Thy shining Angels, O my God command, To bear me to the Bank of Canaan's Land. Farewell vain World, farewell Joacim too, Farewell dear Babes, to all my Friends adieu; My God's my only Hope, my Joy and comfort now. Soft Innocence doth in her Face appear, Now when the grand Catastrophe draws near; Th'Effect of Virtue is a chearful Mind, Her Will is to her Maker's Will resign'd. Shame, Pain and Death, can't Alteration make, Susanna can be chearful at a Stake. She's not involv'd in Gloom, fetches a Sob, Drops some few Tears, and marches thro' the Mob. The Pilate's Skill is known, when Dangers nigh, In midst of Storms and a tempestuous Sea, Far from the sight of hospitable Shoar, When all the waring Elements do roar. When Waves and Billows boistrously do roar, Dare all the battling Winds, and sweep the Shoar: Faith makes Believers smile to see them roll, Fix'd on the Rock, they can their Strength controul, Th'Unbelievers still with Fears oppress'd, Shakes like the Aspen Leaf, with ev'ry Blast. Faith warms the Soul, and gives it vital Heat, 'Tis Faith which makes the bitter Potion sweet: Supports Believers when their Spirits droops, Faith hath more Courage than a thousand Troops. 'Twas Faith in God supported Abraham's Life, When he unsheath'd the sacrificing Knife, From Isaac's Mouth the killing Sentence came; Lo here's the Wood and Fire, but where's the Lamb? Must your young Isaac, grill upon the Fire? God will provide, my Dear, Replies the Sire. Just in the nick of Time, ere he's dispatch'd, A Lamb is in the neighbouring Thicket catch'd. That God who always hears Believers Pray'rs, (Superintendent of the Worlds Affairs) For Pray'r a divine Incantation hath, Draws Mercies down, averts impending Wrath: Inspir'd young Daniel, and he cries aloud, Lo I am free of this just Lady's Blood: O yes, O yes, take notice what you do; Susanna is more Innocent than you. Amidst the Mob, Heav'ns darling Daniel stood, The Infant Prophets Voice allarm'd the Crowd: Our God, who makes the Babes and Sucklings Mouth, His Oracles t'instruct the World in Truth, Made the raw beardless Bard convince the Throng, That Sentence past against the Lady wrong: “O Isra'lites, he says, foolish you are, “Condemn Abraham's Daughter at your Bar, “Without Respect to Beauty Sex or Youth; “Nay worse, without sufficient legal Proof; “At God's Command, this Admonition's giv'n, “I've my Credentials from the Judge of Heav'n: “Return the Lady, and prevent God's Wrath, “Throw by these horrid Implements of Death; “Th'Accusers being Interrogate by me, “Their Falsehood and her Innocence you'll see, “And quickly you'll reverse your last Decree. The Senators obey th'inspired Boy, The Populace huzza her back with Joy; Thou'rt sent from God, the Judge to Daniel says, Made Wise in Youth by th'Ancient of Days, To his bless'd Name be everlasting Praise. Therefore w' invite thee to the Judgment Seat, Read o'er the Proofs, and all the long Debate: Call the Deponents, re-examine them, As you see Cause assoilzie, or condemn. Then holy Daniel on the Bench appears, He stares on Aulus and his snowy Hairs; “Says, aged Sinner, of an impious Life, “Falsly you've sworn against Joacim's Wife: “These secret Sins, in which you've ta'en Delight, “Shall all be blaz'd abroad, and see the Light. “Hold up your Hand, swear by the God of Truth, “That no false Word shall issue from thy Mouth: “As ye shall answer at the Judgment Day “To God, who knows all that we do or say. “By this your Oath, administrate by me, “Where was't you did Susanna's Dalliance see? Aulus repli'd, under a Mastick Tree. “Thou'st sworn, good Daniel says, against thy Life; “Heav'n's Messenger, with sacrificing Knife, “Already is dispatch'd to punish you; “His Scymiter shall cleave thy Trunk in two. “The Wretch dismiss'd, he to Prioli said, “O thou, the Offspring of curs'd Canaan's Seed, “Thy baleful Looks, denote thy want of Grace, “Thou art not sprung of holy Judah's Race: “Beauty hath ruin'd thy ill guarded Heart, “The Pleasures gone, and you endure the Smart. “Thy Eyes roll with Revenge, Rage burns thy Breast, “Conscious of Guilt, thy lab'ring Soul's oppress'd: “Lust by Revenge, is unto Madness wrought, “Sorrow and secret Shame perplex thy Thought. “Thou with malignant Love, did tempt the Just, “To quench thy burning fev'rish Thirst of Lust: “But Judah's Daughter, being as Chast as Fair, “Villain thou'st brought her to a fatal Snare: “Allied to Heav'n, she like Heav'ns Saints doth shine, “She loth'd to touch that unclean Corps of thine. “Hold up to Heav'n thy Face, thy Hand to me, “As you shall answer to the Dietie, “Under what Shade, did you the Adult'ry see? Prioli bow'd, and said, under a Myrtle Tree. “Thou mongrel Soul, the divine Daniel said, “Thy Oath, hath now thy Villany betray'd; “Loaded with Crimes, thy Tribe and Nations Shame, “Reproach and Scandal to the Hebrew Name: “Long steel'd in Vice, thou Sins without controul, “Stifles the innate Notions of the Soul. “Thy Oaths a Copy of thy ugly Mind, “And thou shalt dy the Death, for her design'd; “And she shall be esteem'd the best of Womankind. Then turning to the Audience, said, “Take these two Varlets, for their Perjury, “To Execution, stone them till they dy: “Retaliation Law doth here take Place, “Which Moses Law prescribes in such a Case. The rude Militia make an horrid Noise, The bristled Matrons, and the beardless Boys, Grining like angry Mastives, they fall on And furrow Aulus's back, with Plow's of Stone. A Stone six Paces sent, an old Hag throws, His Bull-Neck droops, he 'scapes with half an Nose; Foams at the Mouth, and Bellows like an Ox. His Nose grows ruddy like a Turky Cocks, Giles struck him on the Breech with manly Force, His graceless baudy Buttocks hang an A?: Bess hits him on the Teeth, till Jaws do gape; He coins his Face in many an antique Shape: Thick Storms of Fury on his Forehead fell, He roars and belshes Oaths with hideous Yell. A Stone flew whizzing thro' the airy Tract, Such was its Strength, it even'd his bungl'd Back; His Eyes within their hollow Orbits sunk, The Sap ran out, and dry'd the wither'd Trunk. A Storm of Stones fell on his Arms and Thighs, Like sprawling Wolf, upon the Ground he lyes; He loll'd his bulky Tongue, and curs'd the B?s thrice. With next Attack he's batter'd to the Ground, Froth fill'd his Chops, he gave a grunting Sound, Twice he essay'd to rise, but all was lame; He fell and boch'd the Thing that's foul to name: Besmear'd with Mud, the mangled Body lay, His Soul flew thro' a Gap to Hell the nearest Way. Prioli next appears, with horrid Face, Able to bring the Gibbet in Disgrace; Benum'd with Fear, ty'd to the Stake he stood, And seem'd like it a Log of ill hewn Wood. The Mob direct so well the honest Cuff, His Body sounded with the strong Rebuff: A Stone graz'd on his Cheeks, and went asloap, It miss'd so narrow, that it cut the Rope. Another flew o'er's Head, and hit the Priest, Down toples he, and lyes like slaughter'd Beast; Then all the Rable laugh'd to see the wanton Jest. At last a Stone, which weigh'd about sev'n Pound, Brought down the filthy Fabrick to the Ground; Struggling to rise, he still became more faint: All hear'd the roaring Noise he downward sent. One slung a Stone, which could have split a Rock, It peirc'd his Breast, and gave the mercy Stroke: All drench'd in Blood, the beagle Body lay, Just as it was alive, a senseless Lump of Clay. Virtutem posuere dii sudore parandam Hes. On a fair Lady, Suckling a beautiful Child, holding an Apple in its Hand. I'm all in Flame, was e'er such Beauty seen, O she is fairer than the Lydian Queen, For whom fierce Herc'les dropt his Lions Skin; And dress'd in Linsey Woolsey learn'd to Spin. Like Venus she's of every Charm possess'd, Lo! there is Cupid hanging on her Breast; Fondling the Babe, his little Wagries spies, Closs in her Bosom languishing he lies. In that transparent Heav'n, doth Sport and Play, Circling with am'rous Folds the milkie Way; She holds th'o'er flowing Goblet to his Lip, From whence he doth sweet killing Philtres sip. I'm wrong, the dazling Beams my Eyes destroy; Tho' he resembles much the Paphian Boy, It can't be he, Cupid doth wear a Bow, In this soft Hand doth a fair Apple grow; Oh! now I mind the Thing, I hear'd it long ago. On Pelis's Wedding-Day did Strifes arise, The tempting Gold'n Apple was the Prize, For which three Goddesses forsook their Skies. Upon the Apple were these Words engraven, Let this be to the fairest Goddess giv'n: Each thought she'd gain the Prize, they all agree, Paris be chosen for to end the Plea; They'll firmly acquiesce to his Decree. Well knew the Boy to please the Pow'rs above, He gav't to Venus, she's the Queen of Love: See how she takes it from the charming Youth, And Prints her melting Kisses on his Mouth. ON THE RUINS OF Wallace's Tree In the TORWOOD. Hail! rev'rend Reliques of a princely Oak, Devouring Time Thy Giant Strength hath broke; In Royal Pomp, six hundred Years you've stood, Pride of the Plains, and Sovereign of the Wood: How I revere thy venerable Bones, Fit to be set 'mongst Pearls and precious Stones. May foreign Pilgrims in Devotion come Hither, to bear thy sacred Ashes home: Hear ev'ry Thing Tradition speaks of Thee, And write the Wonders of the Torwood Tree. Thou in the Center of Thy Army stood, Till Years declar'd the Manhood of the Wood; And when fell Engines had Thy Forces slain, Alone, Thou did'st a Monarch's Pow'r maintain: So did thy Chiftian Wallace stand alone, In warlike Posture, when his Men were gone. Henceforth the Oak shall o'er the Forrest reign, And ev'ry Tree pay Homage to this King; Since it is Loyal, far beyond its Fellows, Prov'd to a Rebel Absolon a Gallows; But shelter'd Royal Charles, and Scotlands Guardian Wallace. Oft hath the Hero lodg'd within Thy Bark, Safe as the Patriarch Noah in his Ark; Thence saillied forth upon his Foes with Force, So sprung the Grecians from the Trojan Horse: Who's wooden Womb invented to decoy, Frightn'd Æneas, who defended Troy. Hail old Patrician! famous thro' the Isle; Uncut Thou falls for Scotia's Fun'ral Pile: Green grew thy Boughs, till Scotia was betray'd, With Her Thou flourish'd, and with Her decay'd. I saw Thee on the fatal first of May, Fair Scotia's Wedding, no, her Burial-Day, Drop all Thy Leaves, Thy Sorrow to express, Nodding Thy aged Head down to the matted Grass. Ere then the feather'd Quires perch'd on Thy Boughs, And sung their Mattins when the Morning rose; With daw'ning Day the Musick was begun, The Consort lasted till the setting Sun: On Thee they built their Nest, there hatch'd their Young, Paying the Tribute of a daily Song. But, since they're gone, and Thou art Visit now, By chat'ring Magpy's, and the dull Cukoo; Low at Thy Feet, beneath Thy benign Shade, Where loving Ivy and the Primrose spread, Deadly Solanum droops his baneful Head: There hissing Serpents spew their Vomit out, And Poison with their forked Tongues Thy root. In frozen Winter, when rough Storms did blow, Clothing Thy shaven Head with Webs of Snow, Briareus Hands Thou streach'd above the Plain, To shelter from bleek Winds, the Nymph and Swain. In Summer, when the Day began to peep, E'er Buxom Mopsa went to 'tend her Sheep, To a South runing Stream she bends her Way, Muttering Words the Flamines bid her say: Then streight with Vigour to the Wood she ran, And revell'd thrice about the Old-Good-Man. Pronounc'd the Charm Would keep from Harm, And save her thro' the Day; By Mary's Might And Wallace Wight, I Conjure Thee O Tree, Preserve my Drove, Cause Damon prove True to his Love, And wed with none save me. But now, no Sheperdess or Swain is seen, To gamble round Thy Trunk, or Dance upon the Green; No more the Dairy Maid with Milking-Pail Sits at Thy Roots, to hear her Strephon's Tale; No more the Shepherd in the scroching Noon, Drives to Thy cooling Shade, there to ly down; No more on Trumps, plays sweetly to his Clara, Nor with his native Notes, sings Leader Haughs and Yarow. To the Nine Muses, Members of the fair Intellectual-Club. Splende lo scudo, a guisa di piropo, E luce altra non, è tanto lucente; Cader in terra alo splendor su d' vopo, Con gli occhi abbacinati, e feza mente. In making You Heav'n took unusual Care, And fram'd you by the best lov'd Angel there. Otw. Orph. Long did malignant Planets rule our Isle, And Heav'n refus'd on Caledon to smile; But now, Heav'n shines, and we in Arts advance, And send enriching Projects unto France. Thro' long revolving Years, the charming Fair, Like caged Birds, have breath'd imprison'd Air; As Tulips only valued for their Hue, A while look'd gay, then wither'd where they grew. O happy Change! the Hoop is learned grown, Beyond the Purple and the Ermine Gown: If I'm not Eloquent on such a Theme, Cut be my Tongue, and blasted be my Fame. Lo! I'm inspir'd by you, since I did read The matchless Speeches in your Forum made; Learning and Beauty doth my Muse employ, I sink in Raptures with the melting Joy: The soft, the sweet, the killing Fair inspires, My frozen Breast with Maros ardent Fires. Bright beauteous Legates of the Pow'rs above, (As Serpents Wise, and Harmless as the Dove;) Your Smell perfumes the Isle, your Odours fly; All gaze upon you with a ravish'd Eye. The Sister Arts to foreign Climates flown, Restor'd shall flowrish in our Frigide Zone: Scotia's cold Heaths become the Muses Seat, We'll once again be Wise, and once again be Great. Awake Apelles, see the sacred Nine, Have stoll'n thy Pencil, and thy Art divine; Behold the Canvass by the charming Fair, Is touch'd with Titian Strokes, with Guido's Air: Vandyke would blush, if he the collouring saw, The Picture finish'd with a Coup d' eclat. Abel return unto Britannia's Isle, (Thy Musick often did our Cares beguile;) We don't invite thee hither for to Sing, (Tho' thou can entertain the greatest King;) 'Tis for to learn from the tuneful Nine, Who's Voices, like their Faces, is Divine. May not the envying Angels snatch you hence, Till we have Virtue learn'd and solid Sense; Forbid it Heav'n, your Web of Thought be spent, Till guilty Britain taught by you repent; Upon th'important Embassy your sent. Immensely Good, you sanctifie the Clime, Tho' sunk in Guilt, and in the Dregs of Time; Your Virtue doth attone for Britain's ev'ry Crime. Your flaming Zeal, kindles the dying Spark, Darts Beams of Light and Brightens what was Dark. The fairest Patterns e'er Britannia saw, Virtue decreed by you, makes th'Edict Law: Your Sex reclaim'd shall all their Thoughts employ, In grateful Songs, the Subject cannot Cloy; Crown you with Garlands, and with Shouts of Joy. Fair Nymphs, my Muse doth venture to presage, You'll make a Conquest of the vicious Stage; Bring back Astrea's Reign, restore the Golden Age. Bless Britain, which for Ages hath been curs'd, ('Twas Love and Beauty made the World at first.) Majestick Nuns, the World reform'd by you, (Beauty perform'd, what Prophets could not do;) With grateful Anthems at thy Feet they'll bow. When you fair Guides, let loose the Reins of Power, You'll break the Cords of Sin, make the polluted pure, By female Virtue shall the Chains be broke, And Beauties smiles, melt down the flinty Rock; The glad'ning News shall spread to foreign Lands, That Britain rank in Sin, was sav'd by Virgins Hands. To Sir Richard Steele, One of the Commissioners of Enquiry for North-Britain. In Transports rise, dead Muse, sublimes thy Theme; With solemn Stanzas, lift his awful Name: Soft be your Notes, and melting as his Song, Which charms our Orb, if not th'Angelick throng. Lively Ideas in your Numbers shine, A beauteous Image spangle ev'ry Line; Don't stumble, and resume the dull Defence, Exhausted is the Magazine of Sense. His Lucubration's swell'd with divine Thought, Makes ev'ry Muse turn mute, great Steele has wrote, And made a grand Monopoly of Wit. Blunt Topick he bestow'd, the bounteous Store, (He's made the Nation Rich, who found them Poor,) To be a lasting Fund, so Heav'n hoards Rain! To be dispens'd in gentle Show'rs again. Immortal Bard, your useful Works presage, You'll stifle Vice, or hurry't off the Stage; Reform the Morals of a vicious Age. With heav'nly Plumage, towrs your lofty Muse, Inspires with Zeal, revives extinguish'd Vows: Paints Virtue in her conquering Charms, your Quill Limns Vices haggar'd Face with utmost Skill; We're forc'd to hate her, ev'n against our Will: You shoot keen Arrows, with gigantick Pith, Vice hides her guilty Head and thinks on Death; Your Pencil 'twas the Christian Hero drew, The wond'ring World, the Minature did View, And said the Painter was the Picture too. Your labour'd Plays have Fancy's utmost Touch, Good Humour which could warm the heavy Dutch Awakes the flaging Soul with glowing Heat; The Characters are Just, the Language sweet. A thousand Beauties throng the pompous Page, All Otway's Softness, mixt with Oldham's Rage; Like Shakspear's Works, they'll flourish in old Age. Could Ben rise from his Dust, he'd blush to see, How far out-done by Addison and Thee. With Rev'rence, distant Nations speak of you; Unto thy Spectatorial Wisdom bow. Our watchful Guardian, whose unweary'd Care, Helpt often to support the Regal Chair, Thy learned Pleadings for the Royal Line, Will make your Name in Britain's Annals shine; What noble Ardors fir'd the Patriots Breast, When Senate was with factious Foes oppress'd; You like great Cæsar spoke, like him you wrote; And when excluded by the Torry Vote, Your loyal Pen in Royal George's Cause, Convinc'd the World by Reason and by Laws; Cut thro' the Film, obscur'd the Eyes of Men, The noblest Cause manag'd by the noblest Pen: Such dint of Argument is us'd by thee, You fright moe from their Crimes, than Tyburn Tree. Great Sir, Scotia who once, proud Neighbours did disdain, Scorn'd hostile Foes, and mock'd a foreign Chain; Baffled a Roman Power, and made them yield, Seldom appear'd, save Victor in the Field, Glory'd in her Name, The independent Scot, Ere Englands Arms was quarter'd in her Coat, With hungry Looks, holds up her ghostly Face, Her palsey Hands, point to the lonely Place, Where Laws were fram'd, where sat th'illustrious Grief, more than Age, hath furrowed her Brow; She sobs her Sorrows, yet she smiles on you; Tears from their chrystal Limbicks do distil, With throbing Breast, she dreads th'approaching ill; Yet still She loves you, tho' you come to kill. In midst of Fears and Wounds, which she doth feel, Kisses the hurting Hand, smiles on the wounding Steele. An amorous Epistle from the Abbot Bothwell, To Eleonora a Lady Nun. Daughter, Beauty is justly term'd a divine Ray, By which our Maker doth his Pow'r display; The Fathers of the Church do still conclude, The Fair are always exquisitely Good: That lovely Face of thine's a Glass, where we Behold the Rays of pure Divinity. Th'Almighty shews his Love unto the Fair, Allowing them two Attributes to share; These Attributes most proper to his Nature, And you enjoy them both, my charming Creature. 'Twere rank Ingratitude t'indulgent Heav'n, Not to employ the Talents God hath given? Was't for no other End; Heav'n Beauty made, But tantalize our Eyes, and useless fade: He was too Kind, bestow'd the charming Pow'r, To make it Crime, to touch the pleasant Flow'r. Lifes not more nat'ral to Mankind, than Love; (Need I a Thing so very easy prove?) There's a Desire implanted in each Creature, T'unite with what's most proper to its Nature; This animats the whole Terrestrial Ball, Instinct we call it, in the Animal: That natural Cast, which to the Center brings; The Term we give it, in inan'mate Things, In Man, the noblest Creature on the Earth, The Sign of Wisdom, and Cœlestial Birth. These Functions of our Life, to sleep, or move, Are not more nat'ral, than for us to Love: Nothings so deep below, so high above, But feels the mighty Influence of Love. The rugged Earth, th'unexorable Sea, The Winds and Stars, all own its Sov'reignty: Nothing's too good, too great, but what it sways, All Things are at its Will, and ev'ry Thing obeys. If Love be sweet to these immers'd in Strife, Burthen'd with all the servile Cares of Life, 'Tis much more so, to pious Souls that dwell Recluse, and cloyster'd in a lonely Cell: Calm and serene, we feel no weight of Sorrow, What we're to Day, we'll be the same to Morrow. No guilded Baits of Honour do invite, To Toiles all Day, and sleepless Hours all Night, Tho' Luxury, our Convent be deny'd, With fresh Subsistance daily we're supply'd; We hear no noise of War, or foreign News, Then let soft Love employ the Religious: We mock at Riches, which the World adore all, Our Disposition's physical and moral; Long Time with Saints, hath stock'd the Courts above, Who's Hearts receiv'd th'impress of divine Love; Saints Love so vigrous grows, that at the length, They love with all their Soul, and all their Strength: But as the Brutes (so the Supreme design'd) Have by their Master diff'rent Tasks assign'd, According as their Strength and Kind allow, Some are for Pleasure, others for the Plow: So we who must th'Almighty's Laws fulfil, Perform the mighty Dictats of his Will. These preordained by the Pow'rs above, Give up their Hearts wholly to divine Love; For this Seraphick Love the Church still Pants, 'Tis this makes Martyres, Confessors and Saints. But the Devout, to whom the Gifts not giv'n Of violent Inclinations for Heav'n, Rise up with Grace, implanted in their Nature, By lower Contemplations of the Creature: We love our Maker, as the others do, Love him dilated in his Works below; We admire his Goodness, when we gaze on you. When I behold your Charms, your ev'ry Grace, Your matchless Shape, the Wonders of your Face, I adore th'Omnipotent, I must confess I see his Image in the lovely Glass: Thus I mount up, on Love's triumphant Wings, To the eternal Principal of Things. I by its natural Emanations know, Pleasures of Heav'n above, and Earth below; So without Guilt of Sacrilege, I share My Heart 'twixt divine Love, and you my charming Fair. To make us Happy, Heav'n did design That we should in our Maker's Image shine; This we establish as a Rule of Faith, The Thing which makes us happy, makes us safe; And that is Love. The Ardors of my Love, makes me impart To you the great Arcanas of my Heart; My ghostly Counsel take, be no more Coy, Prepare to meet me, and the coming Joy. The Spider and the Gout. A FABLE. We read in prophane and sacred Records, Of Beasts that have utter'd articulate Words; And Statues without either Wind-Pipe or Lungs, Have spoken as plainly as Men do with Tongues: At Delphes, and Rome, Stocks and Stones, now and then Sirs, Have to Questions return'd articulate Answers. State Poems, Last Morning half sleeping, there came in my Thought, A pleasant Dialogue which Æsop forgot: The Spider, a Master of the Webster Trade, (He was a Burgess born, a Burgess bred,) Declining with Age, lov'd a Countrey Life; And therefore transported himself to Fife: Travelling he met on the Road with the Gout, (Both of the Pilgrims were walking on Foot) Good-Day, says the Gout, pray where are you going, In stormy Weather when the Wind is blowing; The City Weavers have plenty of Wealth, And all Folk that's Rich, take Care of their Health. The Spider replies, you're quite mistaken, I'm a Beggar for all the Pains I've taken; When e'er I offer to set up my Loom On a Cabinet Head, or the Roof of a Room, An ill natur'd Jad, with Besom of Hairs, Sweeps me and my Plenishing down the Stairs: If you knew my Case, you'd be mov'd with Pity, I'll ne'er return in my Life to the City. If this be the Treatment you get, says the Gout, Truly I cannot but commend your Wit; Go you and lodge in a Country Sted, You may fix your Loom in a Farmer's Bed; There all your Days live Safe and Content, He'll no cause you flit, tho' you pay no Rent. But for me, I cannot get Bread tho' I beg, I dare not come near a Country-man's Leg; He'll no keep me an Hour in a Year at the Fire, Trails me all the Day thro' Dub, and thro' Mire; The Lairds and the Trades-men, have as little Pity, So I'll try my Fate and visit the City. Indeed, says the Spider, I approve of the Thing, In Edinburgh Town you'll live like a King; But be sure to go to an honest Sinner, Who begins in the Morning and drinks till Dinner; Takes a lusty Mail, a Dram, and a Sleep, Rises and Coughs like a rotten Sheep; Then away to a Cellar, as dark as Hell, There he Smoaks and Drinks, till the ten Hour Bell: Take my Advice, for the Burgess hath Gear, Keep him close in the House, four Months o' the Year Remember the more Mischief that ye do, He'll be the kinder and kinder to you; He'll roll you in Blankets, and Pillows of Down, (Well lives the Gout in a graceless Town:) In Sack he'll drink your Health, tho' it slay him; Till his Breath be out, never gae frae him. Farewell, says the Gout, I return you Thanks; I shall not be long from a Burgesses Shanks. MORAL. The Flame of Life's sustain'd with little Food; We're very healthful when we're very Good: But such is the Corruption of our Natures, We will be very wicked, goutish Creatures. A DIALOGUE BETWIXT A Sea-Man and a Taylor. On a very clear Night The Moon shining bright, A Sea-man and Taylor were walking; And I drawing near, Gave attentive Ear, And heard ev'ry Thing they were talking. TAYLOR. Quoth the cowardly Taylor To the courageous Sailor, What was your Dade's Occupation? SEA-MAN. He liv'd by the Sea, 'Twas there he did die, As did all my Generation. TAYLOR. Indeed ye're o'er crouse, Said poor prick the Louse, To put your self in such Danger, As to venture at Sea Where they all did die; Take Advice from me a Stranger, Rather stay at Hame, And work for the Wame, For this is the Land of Goshen; Than to go to the Waves That's prov'd your Fathers Graves, And die like them, on the Ocean. SEA-MAN. Your Trade is free of Harm, And you sit clean and warm; But where did your Parents die? TAYLOR. In the very same Bed Where last Night we were laid, And so I hope will I. SEA-MAN. How can ye be glad To sleep in that Bed, Since it's dang'rous to ly in't: No I'll to the Main, Cry, Widdy hold thy awn, And ne'er sleep there least I die in't. Duke of Buckinghan's Jest on Dr. Barrow, With the Doctor's Answer. The Doctor being invited to Dinner On a Christmass Day, by a City Sinner, Kindly comply'd and came to his House, The first Dish serv'd up, was a Turky and Goose: The Duke coming in, and spying the Priest, (No Man in England, lov'd better a Jest,) Says, tell me Doctor, why it always falls so, I ne'er see a Church-Man, but I see a Goose also? The grave Good-Man, with a primitive Look And a rever'nd low Bow, saluted the Duke, I'm pleas'd, says he, with Mirth from your Grace, Your ay making Merry with Aaron's Race; 'Tis a very good Jest you've past in this Place, I'll ne'er see a Goose, but I'll mind your Grace. Mr. HERRON'S Memorable Saying when Dying. The pious old Man, who's Riches was Grace, Leaving the Earth for a better Place, Hearing his dear affectionate Wife Who always had been the Solace of his Life, Lamenting her Loss, crying, When you are Dead, Who will gain my poor Babes their Bread? With the Air of a Saint, Mr. HERRON reply'd, Trust in the Lord he will provide; God who doth the young Ravens preserve, Will not suffer the young HERRON to starve. Chancellor Hyde's Jest, ON Dr. Bull the famous Jester: Applying to him for Promotion in the Church; and Dr. Bull's snug Reply. CHANCELLOUR. I hate to see a smooth headed Bull. Where's the Horns should adorn your Skull? Dr. BULL. Your Lordship must know, in my Country Side, The Horns are always join'd to the Hide. TO My honour'd Friend Dr. P?k, Author of the Description of Tweddale, and Miscellany Poems. Proud England boasts to be the Muses seat, Glorys in Spencer's Flights, and Cowley's Heat, Ben. Johnston's toiling Head, and Shakespear's Plays, Dryden's bright Wit, and Waller's melting Lays, Milton's inspired Thoughts, and Denham's Strains, Who sung the sweetest of the English Swains. These are the Muses darling Sons I own, Yet equaliz'd by Bards born in our frigid Zone: Fam'd Scotia's snowy Hills hath giv'n Birth, To Wits and Warriours, famous thro' the Earth. On barren Heaths, which never felt the Plow, Ripen'd with cold, the richest Learning grew. Toss'd in cold Cliffs of Caledonia's Coasts, With Borea's Blasts, and Hyperborean Frosts: Th'admired Drummond dropt cœlestial Lines, Learning in which, and boundless Fancy shines. Seraphick Notes flow'd from Buchanan's Quill, Too great for Man; almost for Angels Skill. Immortal Douglass in his hermit Cell, Drunk with the Streams of Heliconian Well, Reelling with Raptures in a rapid Strain, Virgil Translates and brightens up his Fame: Stirling and Maitland have eternal Names, All know the Muses welcome to King JAMES; Where Constellations of bright Wits appear, With Knowledge fill the Soul, and charm the Ear: Crawford of late, the British Ovid grew, And you'r Great Sir, the British Ovid now. Could Wishes but prevail, I'd wish my Name, Like yours, might fly upon the Wings of Fame; I wish my Worth did equalize my Will, That I in Nature's Secrets had thy Skill, And could express them with thy matchless Quill: Happy the People whom you live among; Sure 'tis their daily Prayer that you live long; Their Healths preserv'd by you, their Pleasure by thy Song. A Farewell to CELIA going to the North. Farewell fair Saint, the killing Wound I feel, When I pronounce the bloody word, Farewell. My Case is worse, than that unhappy Race, Who view fair Phœbus, but a little Space; Whilst they're adoring him, he leaves their Hemisphere, And they're poor Wretches sunk in deep Despair. So I, unhappy I, did scarcely know, The greatest Beauty ever dwelt below. But she, ah! Cruel Fair, retires; and lo, Leaves her poor Lover, plung'd in Gulphs of Woe. Farewell, dear charming Celia, O prove kind, And mind the bleeding Heart you've left behind: Fly, fly ye lazy Minutes, wing away, Haste on ye weary Nights, post on each tedious Day Till she return, and then for ever stay. A MARRIAGE BETWIXT Scrape, Monarch of the Maunders, and Bobberlips Queen of the Gypsies. Travelling of late in Fogs and thick Mist, Without any Guide save Will with the Wisp, I wander'd, for the bright decoying Rogue, Hop'd to wild Heaths, and many a mossy Bog; Trembling I stumbl'd thro' deep Pits and Ditches, Thinking to meet the Devil and his Witches, I'm sure they keep their nightly Meetings here, (Where never Priest, or humane Foot draws near,) Upon this Spot they dance and ravel all the Year: At last a joyful Musick reach'd my Ear, I did the Din of distant Waters hear, Ignis went off, the Day began to clear. I leapt for Joy, bending my Course with speed, To reach the Water; and I found it Tweed: Glad was my Heart, when I its Banks did view; There I beheld a very jovial Crew. Below fair Peebles, on the River's Side, The merry Beggars were busking a Bride, A gang of Strollers, acting their Freiks, Gabling and dancing as merry as Greeks. In a thicket of Trees my self I hid, Where I heard and saw what the Beggars did. No Shellicoat Goblin, or Elf on the Green, E'er triped more nimbly than the Beggar's Queen; Blobberlips the Bride did Dance and Play, (For this, it seems, was her Wedding-Day.) She was match'd to old Scrape, the Maunders King, (This made all the Rag-Regiment sing,) Who gave her a Curch, as wide as a Hood; A silver Brotch, and a silken Snood, A pearled Cross-Cloth, a woven Belt, A large leathren Swag, to hold the Gelt; A pair of Scizars, to clip the Plaisters; To keep open the Wounds which shew their Disasters; Needles to sew the Pass-ports when torn; An Elchin to coble the Shoes when worn; A string of Beads, a Bitch, and a Kent, To help her thro' the Bogs and the Bent,) A Blanket, a pair of new soal'd Hose, A Mill with Snitian, to pepper her Nose. You're Queen of the Covee, (says he) tho' in Rags, My fair Fuss you shall carry the Bags; All Night you shall ly on Pillows of Flags. I've truf'd you a Ladies Shirt from the Hedge; (Auld louzy Duds gars ay Folk fidge.) On Pad of Bulrushes, your Buttocks I'll lay, There sleep and sing, till the Cock crow Day. Then beg on the Way, and rob all we meet, Steal from the Hedge, both the Shirt and the Sheet. I'll pour on thy Pale, a Pot of good Ale, Laughing like us, at ev'ry Mail; On stoln Eggs and Butter we'll Dine, My bona noba, in a cloven Pine; With Ducklings i'th' Season, Bacon and Pease, Capons, Turkeys, and fat dabs of Cheese; I'll learn you to filch a Duck or a Hen, Fill the Swag with Lour, for a bousing Ken. And a Begging we will go, And a Begging we will go; With a Pock for our Oat Meal, Another for our Rye; A little Bottle by our Side, To Drink when we are Dry. And a Begging we will go, &amp;c. Blabberlips kiss'd him, ten times and mair; Cry's, Blessings lies lurking in his Tufts of Hair; Lang grows his Beard, thick, forked, and fair: I'll kemb his Beard, his Whiskers I'll plet; With Feathers of Ravens, brush his bald Pate: He'll ly on the Pad with his Dell till she twang: Let the Constable, Justice, and the D?l, go hang When we roost in Barns, old Chuck will teach us, To cut bien Whids, and be perfect in Crutches, To clap our Fambles, thro' up our Nab-cheats, To silch from the Hedge, both the Shirts and the Sheets: The Cowlies on the Straw, with the Morties will be glad, But ilk an must maund on his awn Pad: The Doxies turn up their Keels and spelder, Wapping till a Kinch twang in the Kelder. The Covee coming by, Will Bumbumbis cry, Hedge-Hog, Toad, Beetle, Dick the Jewels, There they ly. Then a flecker'd blew ey'd Hag began to sing, To the Tune of Old Sir Simon the King, Beggars SONG out of Beaumont and Fletchers Plays. “Cast our Caps and Care away, “This is Beggars Holy-Day; “At the Wedding of our King, “Thus we ever dance and sing. “In the World look out, and see; “Where's so happy a Prince as he, “Where's the Nation lives so free, “And so Merry as do we? “Be it Peace, or be it War, “Here at Liberty we are, “And enjoy our Ease and Rest: “To the Fields we are not prest, “Nor are call'd unto the Town, “To be troubled with the Gown. “Hang the Government, we cry, “Their Officers we do defy; “Let Magistrates on Gibbets dy. “When the Subsidy's encreast, “We are not a Penny Cest: “Nor will any go to Law, “With a Beggar for a Straw. “All which Happiness he brags, “He doth owe unto his Rags. “Then a Begging we will go, “And a Begging we will go, &amp;c. In the midst of their Mirth, Dunnawassels drew nigh King Scrape rose up with the Hue, and the Cry: Purveyors to your Crutches; wooden Legs, wry Faces, To your Postures; learn your halting Paces. Red-botch rid you, make false Bellies, ye Whores, Slover Chops to your Stilts, lay open your Sores; Beeds-Men tye your Tackling, haste, the Lour bring To Litter the Cubs, and Bouse the King. The tatter'd Regiment took the Alarm, Some wanted a Leg, others an Arm: The Queen was Cripple, with a broken Leg; And thus she shew'd them, the Art to beg. The Begging CANT. Bless your Worships, throw us a Penny; Pitty the Wretches, poor and many; Mind the Blind who cannot see; Giv's but a Doyt, or Irish Babie: Spare something to the Dumb and Lame, All starving with a hungry Wame; And he who sent you't guide you hame. She canted till she got The matter of a Groat, Which she to Scrape did bring, For he was own'd for King; And merrily did sing. The SONG. Here in Peace and Love we dwell, Who'd be Nobles, prithee tell: When the Beggars live so well. Then Blyth, very Blyth, very Blyth, let us be, King George needs a Million, so do not we: Well Dance, and we'll Sing under the Hawthorn-Tree. Just now it's been our Lot, For to pick up a Groat, We'll put it in the Pot, And Merry, Merry, Merry, very Merry, let us be. ON CORINNA Rising from her Bed, and dressing to go to Mass, upon Ash-Wedensday Morning. After the Model of Anacreon. PART I. Cum Theba cum Troja foret cum Cæsaris acta Ingenium movit sola Corinna meum, Ovid. Eleg. Fair Corinna she doth rise, Blushing like the Morning Skies; Her Hair is as the streaming Gold: (Half her Charms can ne'er be told) All the Stars that's in the Skies, Shine not like her peirceing Eyes. In her Breasts the Lillie grows, In her Cheeks the Summer's Rose; How her Bosom gently moves, Shining with the gloz of Doves: Softer than the Down of Swans, Is her Arms and her Hands; Her Cloths doth greater Beauties shrow'd, Than these which makes the Peacock proud. Oh, Corinna's charming Fair! Matchless in her Shape and Air; 'Twas such Beauty that did move, Ovid in his Art of Love. Looks like her's made Adam fall, Beauty triumphs over all; With her Brightness I'm undone, Like Men gazing on the Sun: Cruel Beauty haste away, Or you'll kill me if you stay. Now she looks unto the Glass, Which doth all her Airs express; I am ravish'd when I View, Corinna multiply'd to Two. O Corinna! hear my Pray'r, You are Good as well as Fair; Take no Patches, they'll do Harm, Ev'ry Patch conceals a Charm: Minor Beauties Patch and Paint, 'Tis because their Colour's faint; Let them counterfeit the Rose, To beguile a gleik of Beaux. Pouder, curle and dy their Hair, And affect a courtly Air; Nature when she finish'd you, Left Art nothing for to do. Don't employ the cruel Fan, Less than that hath kill'd a Man; It's an Implement of Death, When it cools you with it's Breath. As Western Breezes makes the Rose, All its Sweetness to disclose; So the Fan spreads all the Flow'rs, In that lovely Face of yours. The Fan created first my Pain, I was Dead, but liv'd again; You can with the smallest Toy, Which your Fingers doth employ, Melt the Soul with rapt'rous Joy. I'll another Favour ask, Be not cover'd with a Mask; Bless the World with your Face, And expose your ev'ry Grace, Wound and kill each Swain you see; But reserve your Heart for me. PART II. If you go to the Temple, Nymph divine, They'll ev'ry Image burn, and ev'ry Shrine; Each Vot'ry there will only worship thine. Fair Devotess, in heat of boiling Love, Thinking you are descended from above, Low at thy Feet they'll kneel, devoutly bow, And with imploring Hymns they'll worship you: Ave Marias they'll forget to sing, Ave Corinna, thro' the Dome will ring; They'll Feast upon your Beauty, glorious Saint; The Crime may Damn them, for its breach of Lent. O! had Pope Jean, like you, been killing Fair, Your Sex had always fill'd the Papal Chair; Then strictest Hugonets had gladly come To kneel, and kiss thy lovely Toe at Rome. Sweet Cherubim, you prove beyond the Priest, They lye who plead, that Miracles are ceas'd. Go then, fair Vot'ry, to the Dome and Pray, You'll wash the Guilt of Heresy away, And sanctify this Superstitious Day. MERRY TALES FOR THE Lang Nights of Winter, In DIALOGUES betwixt the Tinklarian Doctor and his Grandam, &amp;c. The Taylor cry'd, and fell unto a Cough, And the whole Quire, did hold their Hips and laugh; And waxen in their Mirth, and sneez and swear, A merryer Hour was never wasted here. Shakspear. The Winter Nights in Merryment and Play, They pass, to drive the tedious Hours away. TINKLARIAN DOCTOR. On a Winters Night, my Gran'am spinning, To make a Web of good Scots Linen; Her Stool being plac'd next to the Chimney, For she was auld and saw right dimly: My Lucky Dade, an honest Whig, Was telling Tales of Bothwell-Brig; He could not miss to mind th'Attempt, For he was sitting peeling Hemp. My Aunt, whom nane dare say has no Grace, Was reading on the Pilgrim's Progress; The meikle Tasker, Davie Dallas, Was telling Blads of William Wallace: My Mither bad her second Son say, What he'd by Heart of Davie Lindsay. Our Herd, whom all Folk hates that knows him, Was busy hunting in his Bosom, Till being tir'd with twa Hours scratching; He fell at length to quick dispatching; Nere Roman slew sae mony Græcians, As he did of his blood Relations, Nor did he think it was a Sin, To be the Dead of all his Kin. The Bairns and Oyes were all within Doors, The youngest of us chawing Cyndars, And all the auld anes telling Wonders: I'll tell you mine, ye nere hear'd droller, (It's meikle worth to be a Scholar.) I've seen you where you never was, And where you nere will be; But yet within that very Place, You shall be seen by me. Grandam. Na, that dings all; but it's a Fiction, A plain and perfect Contradiction; You'll see me where I nere will be, I never hear'd a greater Lie. Tink. Doctor. Gran'am look up unto the Glass, And there ye'll see your wrinkled Face. Grandam. I vow I'd rather giv'n ten Dollars, Before I had nae bred you Scholars, I love to hear your sweet debating, With ane Word Scots the other Latine; There's nane of all the Bairn-time stupid, Their Beards may all wag in the Pulpit, Ev'n Sandy if to next Year spar'd, May be a Chaplain to a Laird. But, hear me Willie, ye're the eldest, I ken ye can a Story tell best, With all your Clergy tell the Wonder, I cannot tho' I'm near an hunder, Why my Teeth younger than my Tongue, Hard as a Stain, or well dry'd Rung, Should moulder like an rotten Liver, Yet my soft Tongue continue clever? Or, why Shoe-Soals so soon decay, In less than six Months quite away, Yet my thin Hide should never wear, Tho daily worn this ninty Year? Or, tell me if you ken the Matter, How Ale being thicker far than Water, When I drink Ale, it gets an easie downfall, But Water choaks we tho 'twere a spoonfull? Tinkl. Doctor. Grandam I'll answer all your Wonders, Beginning at the first, your Grinders; Must not that wear which nere lies still, Ay grinding like the Canno-Mill: Your just a Mill your Mouths the Happer, Your Teeth the Mill-Stains, Tongue the Clapper; Ye ken the Clapper is but thin, And like your Tongue ay making din, Yet it will wear out twenty Mill-Stains, Tho they are kend not to be ill Stains. As to the second, you'd consider, That Beasts have diff'rent kind of Leather; Shoe-Soals from dead Beasts they do flae, But ye are living, lang be't sae. As to the last, 'bout Ale and Water, Ale gangs down cause you love it better. Grandam. The last's the truest of the three, The shame a Word of that's a Lie. Tinkl. Doctor. Gran'am I've answer'd all your Questions, Giv's a Tale, ane of your best ones. Grandam. I'll tell you a Tale, in the Days of Cromwell, When Charles the First from the Throne did tumble; I was then about fourten Years and an half old, When the Rogues took his Head aff upon a Scaffold: We were very ill fash'd with the English Land-Loupers And the haill Country was o'er-run with Mos-Troopers; I went out upon a Night with my Sister Jean, I mind very well it was on a Valentin's Ev'n, We'd been drawing our Valentines, I drew John Strang, He had a base Property 'twas scyre Wrang; Red Hair'd, Dish Browd, Bladder Lipped, meikle Mow'd. We met with my auld Joe Geordie Brown, He liv'd when he was living, in th'Overtown, His Face was big and fair like a fow Moon; He had on a Suit with Princess Mettal Button, His twa Hands was like twa hind Legs of Mutton; I'm sure it was nae with eating, he was nae Glutton. His Legs mens'd all the Parish at Kirk and Market, He said to me, its bawdy, I had best hark it, Lend me your Lug, Giles, and I'll round it in, Now for your Life Limmer, offer to tell't again: But we were cry'd back upon, by my Sister Mary, So Geordie and we, fell to play at blind Hary. Geordie gigled and leugh ay, whan I was ta'n, And the place he gript me be, was ay the Wame: But the Farmers coming in to birle their Placks, We left the drunken Carles to their awn Cracks, We went to the Barn-Yard and play'd bogle about the Stacks. When I was wearied with hiding, and he with pursuing, We sat down at a Hay-Stack, and fell closs to the wooing; He slaver'd all my Lips, and turn'd very uncivil, He thrust up his Hand the length of my Navel, I gar'd all the Folk hear me, I cry'd out like a D?l. The D?l take me, quoth I, blessing my self, if I be your Lown, Sae tell me, are ye in mows or earnest Geordie Brown? I'm in earnest, quo Geordie, it's better nor cracking, Make nae Noise Bessie, it's ay good to be taking; But out came my Mither with a Rock in her Bosom, She gave him his Paicks and soundly did toss him, He took to his Heels, and scowr'd thro' the Green, So I'll ne'er forget that Valantin's Ev'n. Tinkl. Doctor. Gran'am, I'm ay fear'd you've been an auld Sinner, You love a bawdy Tale, as I do my Dinner; I'll tell you a Tale should not be forgotten, The Wife I'm speaking of is both dead and rotten, She was an honest Cammeronian near the Bow-Head, She was sae very afflicted when her Husband was Dead, Ev'ning and Morning she went to the Gray-Friars: If this be not true, mony anes Liers) It happ'n'd anes as she went there to mourn, But first she behov'd for to make her Burn; And hunk'ring down upon the cald Grass, A Thistle on the Grave jagged her A?e, She thought her B?ks was touch'd by old Cuff, Thrusting his Hand up thro' the Turff; She ran away crying five times or six, Dead or alive ye mind your auld Tricks. Mauss. Out fy, Brother, ye stain your Profession, If you speak that way, I'll tell the Session; A Story that's bawdy, is not worth a Plack Man, I'll tell a Tale of Jamie the Pack-Man. Ye could not but ken glied Jamie Cunninghame, As he was travelling, within a Mile of Tuninghame, He sat down at a Fald-Dyke for to ease his Back; 'Twad bursten our Mare to've carried his Pack, As he was rising to gang some Miles farther, He hitch'd his Pack o'er the left Shoulder, The swing of the Pack brought him to the Ground, And choak'd him Dead; the Laird of the Ground On the very Spot where his Servants fand him, Put up a Stain with this Memorandum. What e'er come of the Pack, Spend ay the other Plack, And let ne'er your Gear o'ergang you; Keep ay your Back light, And your Pack tight, And then it will not hang you. Little Jamie. Gran'am give me a pair of new Breicks, And I'll tell you somethings will gar you rive your Cheeks: Grandam. Blessings upon the wi ane, hear how he speaks, My Dear, ye'll not want it, if I should buy them with Straicks. Little Jamie. 'Twas auld lang syne, in an hamely Converse, A Scots-Man bade the King and Court kiss his A?e Grandam. Mislear'd Fallow, the meikle D?l speed him, I'm sure the King wad gar hang him, or head him. Little Jamie. Indeed he did neither, but thought him a fit Tool, To be carry'd to Court, and made the King's Fool. Grandam. They turn all Fools gaes there, Jamie, that's nae Lie, Our Laird spends his Silver there, ilk a Babie: He had ance a bra Fortune; it's all gane to Wrack, For London's a Place that herrys the Pack) I believe this Day he's not worth five and a Plack: The Lords and Lairds that gae up sae fast thither, Are just like the Bairns that forget their auld Mither; And like the Northland Folk, that come from beyond the Tay, To return back again they seldom find the Way: They say ay our Laird's ta'n up about State-Affairs, Shame fa that Wark makes such poor Heirs. Little Jamie. Let us who stay at hame, study to be Thrivers, And well turn Lairds, when the Lairds turn Dyvers: But, Gran'am, let me tell out my bra Sport, How the Man spake to the King and his Court; 'Twas King James the Sixth, when he rang twenty Years King of England, he came down with his Peers To visit Scotland, where he got his Being, The Kings sinsyne thinks we're not worth the seeing King George wad nae come, if it wou'd save us fra dying; For these English Cuckolds, who wou'd cut our Throats, Gars the honest Man turn his Back on the Scots, I love ay that Minister, he was an honest Gentleman Who said ance in a preaching, the D?l was an Englishman And by the Reason he gave, it's very true indeed, When Scholars raise the D?ll he has Horns on his Head. But to return to my Tale, the King and his Dunns wassels, Came to see the Scots Gentry, and all his Vassals; As he lodg'd on the Road, where they sauld Brandy and Ale, And the King was turn'd kanty with the other Gill, He asked the Landlord, how lang he'd liv'd there, The Man answer'd, five hundred Years and mair I and my Predecessors, tho' you may think it a base Lie It's als true as ony thing in the black Book of Paisly. Do you ken, said the King, wha was your Chief, He was hang'd, quo the Man, on the kind Gallows of Crieff, Waes me, quo the King, it seems he's been a Thief. Indeed I'm sure he was nae that, quo the other, But King David gar'd hang baith him and his Brother, What was the Crimes they died for, said King James, May be they were Rebells, what was their Names? Indeed answer'd the Man, I believe they were not baptiz'd, But just took to themselves what Names they pleas'd; For the sign of the Cross, us'd then by popish Fellows, Look'd as if the Bairns were to die on the Gallows: But for the good of Scotland, they gate aft sare Banes, The Name of the eldest was, praise God, Bare Banes; The second Brother's Name, who was a Laird in the Merse, Was, an't please your Majesty, kiss my A?e, Bare Banes came to be Treasurer by which he wan Siller, And for two Years together, kiss my A?e Chancellor; But thereafter Bare Banes was Ch?r, for he was a cunning Spark, And kiss my A?e twice L? J?ce C?k: Yet falling someway thereafter under the King's Anger, They kend they wad be hang'd, if they staid ony langer, Sae they travell'd in Disguise that they might not be kend, And turn'd baith of them Trencher-Makers to their Lifes end: They travell'd with Tinkers and Gypsies, thro' mony Mans Ground, Bare Banes made his four nook'd, kiss my A?e all round. Grandam. Sirs, heard you e'er a Bairn speak sae in his Age, He'll be the Tinklarian all o'er, I see by his Vissage, Who is well ken'd to be the prettiest Man in this Age. Jotham's Parable: OR, THE Parliament of Trees. ARGUMENT. The Trees went forth on a Time to anoint a King over them, and they said unto the Olive-tree, reign thou over us. But the Olive-tree said unto them, Should I leave my Fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and Man, and go to be promoted over the Trees? and the Trees said to the Fig-tree, Come thou and reign over us. But the Fig-tree said unto them, Should I forsake my Sweetness and my good Fruit, and to to be promoted over the Trees? Then said the Trees unto the Vine, Come thou and reign over us. And the Vine said unto them, Should I leave my Wine, which cheareth God and Man, And go to be promoted over the Trees? Then said all the Trees unto the Bramble, Come thou, and reign over us. And the Bramble said unto the Trees, If in Truth ye anoint me over you, then come, and put your Trust in my Shadow: And if not, let Fire come out of the Bramble, and devour the Cedars of Lebanon. On ample Plains where copious Tyber glides, Washing with Amber Streams the shaggy Sides Of seven proud Mountains, whose aspiring Heads, Frown with Disdain upon the lowly Meads. In Days of Yore, as ancient Bards do sing, Trees met in Parliament to chuse a King, Hereditary Right they quite forgot, It seems, of Lethes Streams they drunk a Pot: 'Tis true, the Torry Trees gave no Consent, But damn'd them for a Whiggish Parliament. The Peerage of the Wood do first conveen, The Oak, the Poplar, and the lofty Pine; The Ash, the Elm, the Beech, and Fir, are sent, To represent the Shires in Parliament. The Hazel, Willow, and the Bramble Brood, Compear as honest Burghers of the Wood; Some lusty Cedars came from Sol'mon's Porch, In pious Zeal to represent the Church, But were return'd unto the Lord of Hosts, (The Clergy most not grasp at civil Posts.) Th'States conveen'd, did with one Voice declare, That Prelates should attend their past'ral Care, And fit young Levites for the House of Prayer. A Member said, Condemn them to their Cells, Else we'll turn deaf with Aaron's jangling Bells: They ought to mind the Flock, and not the Fleece, Live like the Chaplains of the PRINCE of PEACE. Spending their Days in Penitence and Prayer, Still in their Eye the penitential Tear. A Palm which long grew on Parnassus Hill, (Made by Apollo Master of the Quill) Was chosen Speaker for his matchless Skill. They authoriz'd a Laurel to be Scribe, Who was descended from a learned Tribe: A lowly Cyprus, known to be a Saint, Was th'Elect Chaplain to the Parliament. Prayers said, Rolls call'd, a venerable Beech, In Judgment strong, and eloquent in Speech, Mov'd that four Members might not have a Vote, The first was Knave, the second was a Sot; The third a Rebell, and the fourth was worse, An Atheist, who had never got Remorse: The Facts were proven, they with Shame sent Home, Four honest Trees elected in their Room. To keep, said he, from a Tyranick Throne, Let's first declare ours an elective Crown, Let us be in a magna Charta fix'd, No Safety where the Governments not mix'd: The King's Prerogative must not devour The Subjects Properties, but these secure; Nor must we streach our Arms to grasp the Regal Power. When weak or wicked Princes rule a State; Slavery and Chains becomes the Subjects Fate. You know we had a Monarch while he stood, Wrote all our Laws in Characters of Blood: Then chuse a Tree well vers'd in Forrest Laws, Hath Strength and Courage to support our Cause; Who knows the Institutions of the Wood, Better indeed he be of Royal Blood: Who'll keep the Coronation Oath he takes, Boldly defend us from th'invading Ax. The Legislative Power in Senate met, After long Sitting, and a cool Debate, Preferr'd an Olive-tree to rule the State, Who flourish'd in the fertile Plains of Goshon; An Ew is sent to tell him his Promotion, Who went with Swiftness to the Olive-tree, With courtly Air, thus told the grand Decree. “Most noble Olive of illustrious Race, “The Marks of sov'reign Power shine in thy Face, “The high Convention of Estates this Day, “Make you an Offer of imperial Sway: “Know great State Pilot, I the Tidings bring, “The Parliament hath chosen you their King. “Our ancient Records being search'd, 'twas found, “Their was a Time when all the World was drown'd, “The Trees were all destroyed by a Flood, “Only a single Ship of Gophar Wood “Danc'd on the Waves, and plow'd the liquid Deep, “Who's Bosom did some living Creatures keep; “Heav'n's Fountains gushing down, did swell the Seas, “'Bove the Top Branches of the tallest Trees. “Invelopt in a dreary Gloom the Sun, “With Eyes agast, his daily Circuit run; “Cynthia seem'd from her pale Dominion torn, “No more the Woods beheld her crescent Horn. “Bow'd down with Torrents, Trees fell in the Ditch, “Destruction run swift as a Lapland Witch; “Loud as the Winds, the weary Sailers rore, “Hopeless to find an hospitable Shore: “For th'Earth was sunk with the excessive Potion, “And all the Trees lay bury'd in the Ocean. “The poor belated founder'd Skiffs sent Post, “The Dove to see, if all the Earth was lost, “If they should always sail, and never find a Coast. “A tedious Centry, and an Half of Days, “The Flood prevail'd, so our great Prophet says, “When Heav'n caus'd it to aswage again, “And with his Finger, bottled up the Rain: “Clos'd all th'o'erflowing Cellars of the Deep, “Order'd the Sea her former Bounds to keep. “Again, the toiling Seamen send a Spy, “The faithful Dove, who to the Woods did fly; “Return'd with Tidings that the Earth was dry. “That Trees lift up their Heads with vernal Green, “Lo, in his Mouth an Olive Branch was seen. “An aged Oak, who reads the Book of Fate, “Did the strange Story to the States relate, “From which they did infer you should be King, “And we should yet enjoy an Olive Reign. “O then, sweet Olive, quit thy rural Mound, “Ascend with princely Steps a higher Ground, “And be the Monarch o'er the Forrest crown'd! To him, with frowning Looks, the Olive spoke, “Go, Myrmidon, to some aspiring Oak, “Bred in the Knacks of King-Craft from his Youth, “Who's Sinewy Arms protects the under Growth: “Strong Bon'd, and fit for toilsom War is he, “But, what am I, a simple puny Tree. “In my paternal Acres safe I dwell, “I laugh at Courts, I hate them worse than Hell, “I never saw a Court, nor never shall. “Here I am pamper'd in my native Soil, “And trade to foreign Climates with my Oil; “I've all that Heart can wish I flourish without Toil “The middle State is surely best, “This Truth, the Trees who're wise, do all attest. “Tempestuous Winds the lofty Cedars crush, “Ev'ry rude Foot treads down the Bramble Bush: “But I'm above Contempt, below Envy; “In this sweet State I've liv'd, in this I'll dy. “Then tempt me not to leave this happy Land, “For Crowns and Scepters, and a wide Command, “My Father told me, who was wise and good, “'Tis dang'rous to be born of Royal Blood, “Moe Thorns are in the Crown, than in the Wood. “Go to the Senate, you're their servile Slave, “A Parasite, a young pregmatick Knave; “Tell them their Choice is wrong, they're crasy grown, “I wou'd not give a Shilling for their Crown. “God's pity him ordain'd to reign by Fate, “He rules a giddy and a factious State; “Poor, tho' he's Rich; and Wretched, tho' he's Great. Th'Ambassador reply'd, “O Country Clown, “Do you despise the Glories of a Crown, “Unthinking Wretch, you're a wild Olive sure; “Base born, of Bastard Kind, unfit for Power: “May Lightnings blast thee, on thy barren Ground, “Henceforth may never Fruit on thee be found. “May Canker-Worms suck and corrupt thy Blood, “And thou unfed thy self, be Vermin's Food: “May Fairies hold their Synods round thy Trunk, “And Night Hags ride upon thee when they're drunk. “O may the Heav'n's Plague you till ye dy, “With raging North Winds, and a lowring Sky; “Witches with grisley Cheeks, and rueful old, “Within thy hollow Trunk, their dark Cabals shall hold. He to the Senate went, and told the News, The Olive did the Government refuse. Th'Estates demurr'd a while, at last they chose A Fig, which with perpetual Flagrance grows In Ramah's Vale, and fair as Sharon's Rose. Thither an Apricock is Envoy sent, To bear the Tidings from the Parliament; The Apricock obeys the high Command, And takes his Journey to a foreign Land: There he arriv'd, and did the Fig approach, And thus harrangu'd him on his grassie Couch. “Illustrious Fig, who's verdant Boughs did hide “The new made Adam, and his charming Bride, “Declining from their Pomp, and in their Ebb of Pride. “They with thy salutif'rous Leaves were dress'd, “Fair Robe, and next to Innocence the best; “On thy sweet Fruit still roll'd their feasted Eyes, “They call'd the best of unprohibit Trees: “On thy green Boughs there's a perpetual Spring, “There, sings the warbling Quires of ev'ry Wing, “Who, with their joyful Notes, proclaim thee King. “Woods, Rocks, and Mountains, with thy Praises ring, “And Trees in Senate met have chos'n you King: “Know, I one of the loyal British Trees, “Am hither sent to spread the glad'ning News. “Of Solitude are you not weary grown, “O taste the Pleasures of a Court and Throne: “I'll wait upon your Levee o'er the Seas, “See you anointed King, to rule the Trees. “Let grovling Shrubs stick in their native Mire, “Rot on the moary Dale, and ne'er look higher; “A nobler Spirit doth your Breast inspire. “You know the Top of Glory is a Crown, “And this high Honour you can call your own. The Fig repli'd, “I know not State Affairs; “(Sound sleeps the Tree that's void of humane Cares,) “Shall I forsake my happy tranquil Life, “To be a Father to the Sons of Strife? “Venture upon the boist'rous faithless Seas, “To be anointed King, and rule the Trees? “No, no, I'll keep within my native Bounds, “I would not give a Fig for forty Crowns. “Go to the sacred Nursery, Apricock; “There get a Twig, sprung from an ancient Stock, “Transplant the Royal Plant beyond the Seas, “You may ingraft upon it what you please, “But lest he languish with the change of Air, “(For I have hear'd of some bad Gard'ners there,) “Don't prune too soon, nor pluck the ripening Fruit; “Or if you lop the Branches, spare the Root. “So, farewell Sir, I give your Senate Thanks, “Perpetual flagrance dwell upon their Banks; “Wise be their Choice, assist them mighty Jove, “To choose a Tree may bless the Woods and Grove. “My Hopes, the Envoy said, were swelling big, “Was e'er such Honour offer'd to a Fig? “He star'd and storm'd, and spoke with boiling Passion, “Where will we find a Monarch to our Nation? “I almost think that Kings are out of fashion. He to the Senate went, and told the Story: The Fig won't have your Diadem and Glory. “A Member mov'd that they should chuse the Vine, “He's nobly born, said he, of Blood divine; “'Twill well become him on the Throne to shine. This Overture did all the Senate please, By Law a Vine's declar'd King o're the Trees. A Pear is sent to tell him he'll be crown'd, And to invite him from his lower Ground: Proud of his Post, the Pear address'd the Vine, (His Arguments were strong, his language Fine:) “From the sweet Tree cœlestial Liquor flows, “The pond'rous Grapes bend low thy laughing Boughs; “Each Pore of you pours out a purple Flood “Of dear Refreshments, and immortal Food, “Which spreads new Life through every dying Heart, “Vigour and Joy, thy precious Juice impart. “Thou art a healing Tree, of sovereign Power, “All Nations, all Religions thee adore: “Thy Blood's a sovereign Balsom when we're Sick, “Gives Life new Strings, and makes the Weels run quick; “Makes dying Pulses beat with lambent Flame, “It wanders thro' the Veins to bless the vital Stream. “Embrace imperial Robes, ascend a Throne, “The Parliament on you have fix'd the Crown, “Reign o'er the Trees, and scatter Blessings down. “Blest will the Subjects be in this Realm, “When Bacchus, noble Bacchus, steers the Helm; “Triumphant Joy will reign through all the Plains, “And chearful Blood will circ'late thro' our Veins; “Poets will write thy Life in Dythriambick Strains: “'Twill be a joyful Reign as e'er was seen, “Trees will be ever glad, and ever green. “Come then blyth Bacchus, be anointed King, “Rule o'er the Trees, and happy be thy Reign. “The Vine made answer, with an awful Frown, “Know, I despise your poor precarious Crown; “Shall I forsake my Luxury and Ease, “My Trade by Land, my Traffick on the Seas, “And go and be promoted o'er the Trees? “When I'm grown Rich, and Indolent, and Old, “Barter my luscious Ease for Crown of Gold; “Wou'd not my Happiness be very cheaply sold? “Lay all your rich Regalia at my Root, “Pale will they look beside my smiling Fruit: “Shall I my sweet Estate exchange for woe? “I'm King of Comrads let me still be so. “O State Tree! leave me to my native Ease, “Present my humble Service to the Trees: “Tell them I'm Loyal to the Common-wealth, “In generous Wine I daily drink their Health. “Let them elect a Prince that's Great and Good, “(O may he be a Blessing to the Wood;) “I'll love him while I live, and serve him with my Blood. Th'Ambassador repli'd, “I'll cause arraign you for a horrid Crime, “You've made a thousand Rebells in your Time: “'Twas you, and only you, Curse on you for't, “Who kill'd our King, and banisht all his Court. “Your cursed Grapes destroy'd the Nations Health, “And introduc'd a hellish Common-wealth; “O drunken Rebell! thy seditious Pate, “Plots all the Factions, which imbroil the State. He to the Senate went, and told the Thing: “The saucy Vine refuses to be King. Surpriz'd was ev'ry Member of the States; After some warm and passionate Debates, An Indian Citron, Glory of the Grove, Spoke Words which shew'd he was inspir'd by Jove. “Hear me, ye worthy Patriots of the Trees, “Our Country may be happy if we please: “We look too high to find a Royal Line, “I have a Claim by Birth-Right, says the Vine, “You can't elect me I'm of Race divine. “The Fig and Olive are so Potent grown, “They think by Conquest to ascend the Throne: “Let's chuse a Bramble, in plain Dealing bred, “He'll be a Foe to Pride; a Friend to Trade. “The Heralds of the Wood do all declare; “The Shrub's as ancient as the Cedars are, “No Matter if a King be short or long, “It's Law that makes him terrible and strong. The Speech prevail'd, the Votes alternate ring, The Bramble, the brave Bramble shall be King. To this new King a Pom'granate is sent, To tell the Statute of the Parliament: He went, and as he went was heard to say, “I hate the Office, yet I must obey: “But if the Bramble should refuse to Reign, “I don't know how the D?l will be King. He kneel'd before the Beamble when he spoke, (He bore his high Commission in his Look.) “The Ashes of our King are now interr'd. “And you, to the high Office are preferr'd: “For to be bury'd, Curse (the Bramble says) “On such damn'd Laws, to cut a Subjects Days. “No, no, replies the honest Pom'granate, “You're call'd to wear the Crown, to rule the State, “The Little Bramble shall be very great. “That's Right, quoth the Bramble, I'm to hold the Reins, “The Giants with long Arms did fright the Plains; They'll all be safe when the Dwarff Bramble's King, “Bless'd be the Tree that doth the Tidings bring. “I need an Assessor, know Pom'granate, “That you shall be my Secretar of State; “O 'twill be humbling to the Cedar Tree, “It will disjoint his Back to bow to me. “O what a Weight is on my Shoulders laid, “What Honours to the Bramble will be paid, “The Bramble's Fame will fly beyond the Seas: “Both Poles shall hear the Bramble rules the Trees “The Royal Oak my Edicts will fulfill, “I'll order all the Wood by my own sov'reign Will; “Exalted on the Throne I'll proudly sit, “Trampling upon the Cedars with my Feet. “I know the Rebells of the Woods will hope, “The Government will sink with such a Prop; “No, my devouring Sword shall make them bleed, “My Fury stamp them down, my Wrath shall strike them dead. “Go Pom'granate, swift as the Lightning move; “Acquaint each Hill and Plain, and Wood and Grove, “That I'm the kingly Regent on the Throne, “And these who do th'Authority disown, “My Arms shall shake, until they totter down. “My Wrath inflam'd, shall plague the scoffing Crew, “The disobedient Trees shall either burn or bow. Thro' thorny Roads with Spirits tir'd and faint, The Pom'granate back to the Senate went; Who told the august Court what he had done, “My Lords, the Bramble doth embrace the Throne, “His Government already is begun. “Nay, I'm convinc'd, before the setting Sun, “(For Magazines of Plagues are in his Blood,) “His raging Fire will burn half the Wood. “Wild and unwholsome as the Root, will all high Branches be, “How can we hope for living Fruit from such deadly Tree. The Senate mourn'd when this sad News was told, They order'd that his Power should be controul'd, Wise Limitations crush'd his proud Intent, (For all our Safety's in a Parliament,) An Oak brought in an Overture for Cess, Which pass'd, and they prorogu'd to—Nevermass.

      <field name="fulltext">[Part II] SONG OF SONGS: A Divine Pastoral Poem, Written in the first Language BY Solomon King of Israel, The inspir'd Manuensis of the Holy Ghost, Justly acknowledged by the Church of God under both Dispensations to be a Portion of the sacred Canon. Procul o procul este prophani. Ov. At lætis pia turba animis sua gaudia plausu. Testabitur ? Buch. Unto the Right Honourable, AND Virtuous Lady, THE Countess of Haddingtoun. [Let me behold thy reconciled Face] Let me behold thy reconciled Face, Refresh my Soul with Influence of Grace; Draw nigh dear Lord, vouchsafe a kind Embrace. Let thy bless'd Mouth, comfort me while I live, No angry Words, but peaceful Kisses give: Bestow on me, O God, who seek thy Face, Quickning, comforting, and confirming Grace. I'm ignorant of all revealed Truth, Till I receive my Knowledge from thy Mouth: In vain, O Lord, thy pious Pastors preach, (Man's Voice no further than the Ear doth reach) Unless thy Spirit powerfully me teach. The Shinings of thy Face is what I crave, O come, let me a long Love Visit have: O manifest thy self to me, sweet Lord, Some signal Favours to my Soul afford. Thy common Favours can't my Fears remove, O give some special Tokens of thy Love. See how the ravish'd Spouse her Lord admires, 'Tis Fellowship with Jesus she desires: What ere we love, we long for to possess, 'Tis that will please the Soul, and nothing less. Th'ambitious longs to propogate his Fame, Courts vain Applause; and struggles for a Name. The Worldling longs and toils for gilded Dust; The Wanton longs to satisfie his Lust: The Hypocrite seeks Gifts, the Saint seeks Grace; Long for the Shinings of their Saviour's Face. Mercies which evidence God's special Care, Is still the Burthen of their fervent Prayer: It is not Pomp and Riches they desire, Not glittering Gold; but Grace do they require. They scorn the Honours of this earthly Ball; One Kiss from Christ's fair Mouth excels them all: His Kisses makes the dying Sinner whole; They're healing Balsoms to a wounded Soul. Sav'd are all those, to whom a Kiss is given; The Soul that's kiss'd on Earth is crown'd in Heaven. Strangers to God, no manly Pleasures know; But steep'd in dregy dull Delights below: Ne'er taste Loves Streams, which from a Saviour flow. What though the Glutton furnish out a Feast, With ev'ry Creature which was Noah's Guest; And let it be with richest Wine enjoy'd, The Pleasures gone assoon's the Stomach's cloy'd. To Saints alone a real Feast is giv'n, Who's Sins are pardon'd by the God of Heav'n: Who's Souls disdain the Earth and soar above, Who's Hearts are fill'd, and fir'd with divine Love. Christ doth comfort Believers with a Kiss; Souls out of Christ are unacquaint with this: Christ's Pardon's often sealed with a Kiss, The certain Pledge of everlasting Bliss. And when assur'd, they're pardon'd all their Sins, The Law Works past, and Gospel Peace begins; They enjoy the Shinings of a Saviour's Face, And feel the bless'd Effects and Riches of his Grace. Yes, holy Souls, acquaint with Christ can tell, His Kiss is sweet, his Love doth Wine excel. [O Glory to the King, who's Favour I have sought] O Glory to the King, who's Favour I have sought: I see his Face, I'm to his Chambers brought. Great Dignity he doth on me bestow, [illeg.] taste his Love, my Spices sweetly flow: [illeg.] secret Fellowship, and closs Communion know. I'm privileged to be Jesus Guest, [illeg.] all the Pleasures of Religion taste: My mournful Ditties chang'd to Songs of Joy, Love doth my Tongue, and all my Soul employ. My Fears evainsh'd, all my Sorrows fled; Bless him my Soul, and in his Courts be glad; Where he has plac'd Love's Banner o'er thy Head. The Scene is alter'd, what a Change is this; She is embrac'd, who only ask'd a Kiss: She's by the Bridegroom to his Chambers brought, Receives far greater Favours than she sought. Here's Dignity bestow'd, here's Honour given; She's made a Friend and Favourite of Heaven. The World admires the Man, to him they Homage pay, Promoted by the little Kings of Clay, Whose Grandeur brings Uneasiness and Pain; And mortal Breath can blow him down again. But oh! the Spouse in this exalted State, Hath Peace and Joy, that's durable and great. Unto the learn'd and pious Paraphraser of the Canticles, AND Author of the following sacred Composures. Thou, heavenly Bard, despising earthly Things, The Nuptials of the Royal Bridegroom sings: Thy Soul with eager Flight doth soar above, Whil'st warbling forth Believers Songs of Love. Thy Breast is warm'd with a seraphick Fire, Chanting these Notes which heavenly Thoughts inspire: These precious Truths, which Saints of God do know, In melting Numbers from thy Mouth doth flow. Tho' blinded Men loath the ambrosial Food, And mock the Saints, the Men of Royal Blood; Burlesque their Secret and their solemn Prayer, And jest the meagre Man, turn'd lean with holy Care! Think Gladness ends, when Holiness begins, And they're divorc'd from Joy who leave their Sins. 'Tis foolish Fancy, Pleasure is not lest; No Joy like joying in the Holy Ghost: Saints are not sowr, and sullen all their Days, But swell'd with inward Joy their Voices raise; And loudly echo forth their dear Redeemer's Praise. Sometimes 'tis true, when Sin prevails they're sad, When the kind Father frowns, can loving Sons be glad: But Sense of Pardon from a God ere long, Succeeds and gives new Matter of a Song. Zion's bright Bard, Love doth thy Pen employ, Spiritual Love, that Love which cannot cloy; Thou Ditties gives, and chearful Songs of Joy. Happy Translator of the sacred Page, Thou surely felt the Prophet's holy Rage; O don't stop here, great Poet, let us see, The Oracles of God all paraphras'd by thee. J. G. P. S. D. CHORUS FIDELIUM. Not such a Song as charms the Ear alone, And Joy is vanish'd when the Musick's gone: Not such as heightens Pleasure at the Wine, And Heaven born Souls to low Delights incline, This is a Song of Love, a Song divine.

To Jesus Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, A Song of Songs inspired Sol'mon sings. BRIDE. O Jesus give my Lips a melting Kiss, 'Twill be a pledge of Love, and endless Bless; The Kisses of thy Lips gives Joy divine, Thy Love is sweeter to my Taste than Wine. How sweet a Flavour doth thy Ointments yield, They're odorif'rous like a balmy Field; Vials full of Odours is thy Name, Such Virgin Soul dwells on the lovely Theme; They give a loose to Love, and sing with ardent Flame. Draw me, O draw me, after thee we'll go; Swift as on Bethar's Mountains skips the Roe. Now to his royal Gall'ries I repair, The King of Love and Glory leads me there; Our Hearts do burn when to his Courts we move, With this blest Vision every Pulse beats Love. We'll sing his Praises with a tunefull Note, Can such amazing Love be e'er forgot: The upright Saints have a perpetual Feast, Christ's Love doth warm the consecrated Breast. The richest Wine jejune and tastless grows, Compar'd with Love, which in our Bosom flows. O Zion's Daughters, swarthy is my Skin, Dy'd with the ugly Leprosie of Sin; Yet there's the brightest Figures in my Face, The Characters of evangelick Grace. Like Kedar's Tents, the Sun hath scorch'd my Face, Yet am I glorious with the Rays of Grace. The costly Arras from a Tyrian Loom, Which doth adorn the King of Israel's Room, These Curtains which his downy Bed doth grace, Hath no such lively Figure as my Face: Tho Black, let me not be despis'd by you, I know I'm jested by a scoffing Crew. Not Aliens, but my bosom Friends were those, Who 'gainst me in sharp Persecution rose; My Mother's Children were my keenest Foes. Those blood Relations falsely did agree, That I the Keeper of the Vineyard be; I by their impious Hands was drag'd away, To toil and drudge, and slavishly obey; Ah! I was foolish, faithful to my Trust, To manage theirs, I left my own undress'd. Tell me my Love, tell me my Soul's Delight, Where rests thy Flock at Noon, where fold at Night; O my fair Guardian! lead me to the Shade, Shall I thou loves, like Stranger be misled? BRIDEGROOM: If you, O fairest amongst Womenkind, Have not the Art my little Flock to find; Follow the Footsteps of the wandring Train, And let your tender Kids with them remain: My Pastors shall with wholesome Herbage feed Your Flocks, and them thro' ev'ry Danger lead. To Steeds which Pharoah's Chariots swiftly move, For Strength and Beauty I've compar'd my Love: Thy Cheeks adorn'd with Jewels my Heart doth hold, Thy Iv'ry Neck shines bright with Chains of Gold. BRIDE. Borders of purest flaming Gold will we With Studs of Silver offer unto thee. Whilst at his Table sits my Saviour King Enthron'd in Majesty: The blooming Spring Decked with all its Tapastries bestows No such comforting Smells, as from my Spiknard flows. Bundles of new pluck'd Myrrh most sav'ry are, But my dear Lord's perfumes excells them far, Burning with Love I'll fly to his sweet Arms, And faint beneath the overpowering Charms: Autumnal smells of fair Engedy's Fields, Which choicest Camphyre in abundance yields, Is no such Cordial; no, it cannot be, As is my dear Beloved unto me. BRIDEGROOM. Love can't be Silent, I must own you're Fair, There's none on Earth who can with you compare, Behold thou'rt Fair! much of thy Beauty lyes, In thy meek, modest, lovely Dove-like Eyes. BRIDE. O my Beloved's Match was never seen! Come, and Solace upon this Bed of Green: Spread o'er my Head a Canopy of Love, For thou'rt the Grace, yea Glory of the Grove; Thy presence makes the Shade to look like Kedar, Its Rafters are of Fir, its Beams are Cedar. DIALOGUE II. BRIDEGROOM. I am the Soul refreshing Sharon's Rose, The Lillie which in Syrian's Valley grows; As 'mongst a bush of Thorns and prickling Brier, A spreading pale fac'd Lillie doth appear, So 'mongst the Daughters looks my Well-belov'd. BRIDE. As in a barren Wood, the Apple Tree, Deck'd with its gaudy Blossoms, so is he Amongst the Sons of Men; with Joy I chose Under his lasting Shadow to repose, And whilst his luscious Fruit did bless my Taste, I sat with Raptures at the kingly Feast. At length, conducted by the mighty Jove, Unto the House of Banqueting we move; O there his Banner over me was Love. Stay me with Flaggons, let the Apples prove Comforting to me for I'm sick of Love: But his left Hand lyeth underneath my Head, When willing, tho' unable to bear up, His right Hand, which the longing Soul doth feed, Sustains me closs at Consolations Cup. I charge you, O Jerusalem's Daughters, then If ye would lasting Fellowship maintain; If my Enjoyments ye would always taste, O be exceeding tender of your Guest. I charge you by the Kids and tender Roes, For who would be so cruel unto those, As to disturb them of their soft Repose, You don't presume to interrupt his Ease, Or wake my sleeping Lord until he please: To the cœlestial Melody give ear, For this is my Beloved's Voice I hear. Behold him skiping on the Mountains high, Escaping o'er Hills swift as the Eagles fly: O Saints behold him, by Experience know, He's lovely as the Hart, or little am'rous Roe. For tho' my draught of closs Communion's gone, And I my dead deserted Case bemoan, Yet from behind the Wall my Lord still looketh on. Kind are the Blinks he from the Window gives, He Love Epistles writes, and mine receives; For tho' his vast Discoveries be remov'd, He thro' the Lattise tells I'm still belov'd. He's reconcil'd again, doth sweetly say, Rise up my Love, my fair one come away; For lo the Winter of Desertion's past, Rains of Afflictions are dry'd up at last, And I return to you with eager haste. Choice flow'rs of Grace within thy Soul doth spring, Zion's beautious Birds their chearfull Notes do sing; The charming Voice of the dear Turtle's heard, And ev'ry rav'nous Bird hath disappear'd. My Vineyard, my Delight, my Joy, my Care, (For all the Plants of Grace are nourish'd there) Looks Fair and Fertile, O I love it well, The chearing Vines send forth a fragrant Smell; Each little Shrub the Planters Livry wears, Loaden with Fruit the thriving Fig appears; All these invite me, I'll no longer stay, Rise up my Love, my fair one come away. BRIDEGROOM. My Dove, why do'st thou hide thy self from me And to the Clifts of Rocks for Shelter flie? Be not discourag'd, for I've heard thy Prayer Sent from the secret Places of the Stair, When Fear and Unbelief had tane you there. Unvail that blushing Face which I do love, O let me hear thy Voice, 'twill surely move; I'll pour upon thee soft'ning show'rs of Grace: Sweet is thy Voice and comely is thy Face. The little Foxes catch, let them be slain; For they destroy the Stragglers of the Plain, O'erturn ill rooted Vines, and these destroy; And ev'ry tender Grape and Herb annoy: Catch them, and kill them, whilst they're very young, If once they ripen unto Age they're stronge, With them my Vineyard's been oppress'd too long. BRIDE: Tho' no fresh Gales, no gentle Breezes blow, No Dew distills, no Streams the Banks o'erflow, My Unions solid; I'll rejoyce in this, That my Beloved's mine, and I am his. Can he be absent long, who loves so well, It's in his Garden he delights to dwell; It's there he prunes his Boughs, and sows his Seed, It's 'mongst the Lillies he delights to Feed. Until the dawning of the blessful Day, That sable Train of Shadows fly away, And Saints, broke through the Cage, aloft shall fly, And meet and mingle with the Saints on high. O with thy kind Embraces visit me, I'm weary to be separate from thee: Swift as the nimble Hart on Bethar goes, Swift as on Bethar's Mountains skip the Roes, So swiftly my Beloved, come to me, Let me enjoy sweet Fellowship with thee. DIALOGUE III. Bride, Bridegroom. BRIDE. When Nights black Mantle hath the Skies o'erspread Loves anxious Fears disturb me on my Bed; The Object of my Love I ever mind, In vain I seek him whom I cannot find: Awake my Soul, shake of the Chains of Sleep, No longer Converse with Corruption keep; Combat the fiercest Lust, my Lord to please, O do not dally with a carnal Ease. I'll rise, and round the City Streets I'll rove, I'll sally forth to meet the God of Love: Ev'ry broad Way, and secret Corner trace, Seek him in ev'ry Ordinance of Grace; I'll ne'er give o'er till I behold his Face. I sought, and O its sad to miss him there, The God of Jacob in the House of Prayer, But could not find him on my bended knees, With bleeding Heart I offer Sacrifice. I sought him in the Fellowship of Saints, I sought him whilst my Eyes in Tears was drown'd; But lo he's Deaff to all my loud Complaints, I sought him, but he was not to be found. At length I'm by the careful Watchmen found, Who with unwearied Zeal perform the painful round; To whom I cry, ye Pilots of the blind, Direct my wand'ring Steps, my Love to find: O saw ye him, my kind Instructors, tell, Whom my deserted Soul doth love so well; Tell me when my Beloved's hid from you, What Methods do you take, what Course pursue. I left these Pastors but a little Space, When I had full Discoveries of his Face; Fresh Smiles speaks Peace, his gentle Looks do move, O! I have found him whom my Soul doth love. With rapt'rous Joy, which none but Saints do know, I clasp'd him, and I cannot let him go, Until I bring him home Unto my Mother's House, the House of God, To th'inmost Chambers of her bless'd abode; For I remember'd whilst I suck'd the Comb, The hungry Sisters of my Native Home, Who do not taste the vast, the wond'rous Bless, But faint with Famine in the Wilderness. I charge you, O Jerusalem's Daughters then, That you sweet Fellowship with him maintain: Of my Enjoyments you would always taste, O be exceeding tender of your Guest. I charge you by the tender Kids and Roes, Whose Keepers dont disturb their soft Repose, O let not Sin and a polluted Heart Awaken my Love, and force him to depart. BRIDEGROOM. Who's this with dazling Splender blinds the Eye, In whose fair Face such Charms, such Love I spy; Who's this array'd in rich embroider'd Dress, Come flaming from the stormy Wilderness. As smoaky Pillars from the Incense rise, So on the Wings of Love she from the Desart flys, Perfum'd with Myrrh, smells like the flow'ry Spring, With odours, and with Incense meets her King: With Pouders choice, of which the Merchant boasts, She's richly freighted for Immanual's Coasts. BRIDE. O from my borrow'd Beauty turn thine Eyes, I see a Sun with uncreated Rays; Behold King Solomon with Glory spread, Behold him leaning on his Iv'ry Bed; Where Saints with holy Fellowship are fed. A Guard of sixty Warriours rails the Place, Strong valiant Isra'lites, made bold by Grace; Not naked Sentinels, fam'd Sons of War, Who from the holy Spot, unholy Souls debar. Expert in War by long Experience grown, They fight with Valour for a heavenly Crown: The slaughtering Sword hangs closely at their Thigh They nobly fight and conquer th'Enemy: With Armour cloth'd, still ready for the Fight, They fear no Foe, nor Terrours through the Night. A Chariots made by great King Solomon, Of fitest Wood, the Wood of Lebanon: Such is his matchless Love, O Saints behold, Its Pillars Silver, and its Bottom Gold: With purple Coverings adorn'd above, The midst is pav'd, for Zion's sake, with Love. O Zion's Daughters, with a cheerful sound Rush forth; behold King Solomon is crown'd; That Crown he wears, that Scepter he doth sway, His Mother gave him on his nuptial Day: A memorable Day for Joy and Mirth, When he rejoyc'd in Heart, and blest the Earth. DIALOGUE IV. Bridegroom, Bride. Bridegroom. Behold, my Love, behold my Soul's Delight, Thou'rt fair, thou'rt fair, I'm ravish'd with thy Sight! Thy modest Eyes vail'd with thy Looks, do shew [illeg.] chast like Doves, and like the Turtle true. As pleasant 'tis from neighbouring Vales to view, The Flocks of browsing Goats on Gilead's Brow, Drink Nature's Cup, and sip the Morning's Dew: So pleasant 'tis my Love, for to behold Thy shining Hair, like Rays of burning Gold; This Ornament thy Puritie discovers, Kindles Desire, and gains thee many Lovers. When the lewd World thy Hair and Teeth do view, They'll praise thy Beauty, fall in Love with you: They will believe thy Entertainment good, When such white Teeth do chaw the heav'nly Food. Thy Teeth a comely Parity do show, None start too high, nor any shrink too low: No proud o'ertoping Tooth thy Peace molest, Even are they rank'd, none Prelates o'er the rest. Thy Teeth doth represent ? The new fleec'd Sheep disburdened of their Wool, That's neatly shorn and wash'd in Heshbon's Pool: In all the Flock no unprolifick Womb, Which Twins bring forth, and bleeting lead them Home: Thy amiable Lips with Charms do move, When thou unfolds the Mysteries of Love; Thy Mouth breaths Blessings, from thy Lips proceed (Thy coral Lips fine as the Scarlet Threed) Streams of pure Nectar, hungry Souls to feed. Within thy Locks, like Pom'granates appears Thy Temples, which a beauteous Lustre wears, As David's Tower strikes Terror from afar; (Where thousand Bucklers are, and Shields of War) Ev'n so, that strong conspicuous Rock, thy Neck, Shall thee from all thy Enemies protect. To thee the Saints with Joy and Pleasure go, To them thy Breasts like ripen'd Clusters flow; O'ercome with Joy, they at thy Breasts do ly, With Fondness suck, but cannot suck them dry. O! did a sensual World but know their Feast, They'd long for thee, and wish to be thy Guest; Caress thy Breasts, and loath their darling Sins: Thy Breasts are like two tender Roes that's Twins. From thy warm Breast's refreshing Streams proceed, They're like the Roes which 'mongst the Lillies feed. My Spouse, whil'st thou art militant below, Thy Life will always checker'd be with Woe; Communion's Tide will ebb, and Storms will blow. But, O my Spouse! ev'n in the Desart sing, Your absent, not divorced, from your King: Until the nuptial Morn strike up its Light, And scatter all the Shadows of the Night; Till I have brought thee to the Courts above, Where we shall consummate our endless Love: Till I with Sound of Trump, shall call thee up, To drink for ever at Communion's Cup; Unto the Mount of Myrrh and Spices fly, Ev'n to Mount Zion's lofty Hill on high. To follow me, my spotless Love prepare; For thou art mine, and altogether fair. O come my Spouse from Lebanon with me, If thou the wicked wanton World wouldst flee; Climb to Amana's Top and Shenir's Hill, Or Hermon's dewy Head, thence gaze your fill: Let me, and nothing else, possess thy Heart: From Hills of Leopards, Lions Dens depart: My Sister, since thou first didst glance at me, My Heart's been always ravished with thee. 'Twas one half Look of Love from thee I saw, 'Twas one Chain of thy Neck did strongly draw My Heart to thee: I cannot but approve Of thee, for thou art fair, and great's thy Love. How far doth thy pure Love the Wine excell, No Ointments squeez'd hath such a perfum'd Smell; Thy burning Love to me is such a Feast, I Love't beyond the Spices of the East. My Spouse, From thy sweet Lips which hungry Souls doth fill, Perpetual Drops of Honey does distill; And Canaan's Blessings glide beneath thy Tongue: Ev'n Milk and Honey to refresh thy young. Thy perfum'd Garments drooping Souls revives, And nobler Smells breathes forth than Leb'non gives, When gentle Zephyres fan the new blown Leaves. But as bold Hands can never reach a Cup, From Fountains that are seal'd, or Springs shut up; Just so, with my fair Spouse, No Stragglers with her Streams comforted be, But all her Currents flow with rapid Force to me. Thy blooming Plants a fruitful Soil declare, They grow with vigor in a wholesome Air; My Grace convey'd to thee, makes all thy Plants look fair. They're like an Orchard thicketed with Trees, Where various Kinds salute th'enamour'd Eyes; There Camphire, Pom'granates and Aloes grow, Saffron, Myrrh, Calamus and Aloes flow; And Incense Trees, and chiefest Spices bloom, Which fan'd with Gales send forth a rich perfume: Thy Orchard's Plants all others far excell, Your Orchard's water'd with Salvations Well. Thy Gardens full of Fountains, never dry; Which doth thy Plants with vital Strength supply; Thro' it the Streams of living Waters go, It doth from Leb'non spring, thy Banks o'erflow. BRIDE. Awake, O North Wind, O thou South Wind blow Cool Gales upon my Spices, and they'll flow; I'll my Beloved in his Garden meet, There we'll Solace, and pleasant Fruit we'll eat. DIALOGUE V. Bridegroom, Bride, Daughters of Jerusalem. BRIDEGROOM. These fervent Wishes darted up by thee, My Sister, O my Spouse, prevail'd with me; And lo, to my fair Garden I am come, I find it Fertile, and the fragrant Flow'rs My Presence shall refresh with heav'nly Showers. The Honey-Comb wrought by laborious Bees, Honey and Wine refined on the Lees; Wine mingl'd with the Milk; I've eat and drunk of these. These noble Dainties do my Table grace, Around the Banquet you my Friends I'll place. Eat O beloved Friends, and thankful prove; Lo here's your King, and here's your Feast of Love. O drink, and on your Sovereign's Kindness think; O my beloved Friends, it's I that bid you drink. BRIDE. Rock'd in the Cradle of tempestuous Cares I sleept, and Satan sow'd my Field with Tares; I drunk the Opiates of the World's Ease, And streight, ah me! I'm lull'd a sleep with these: Yet, when these downy Slumbers shut mine Eyes, My Heart's awake, I hear the Bridgroom's Cries. Sweet are the Invitations of my Lord, “He knocks and cries, my Sister, O my Love, “Open to me my undefiled Dove. “Shall I not wake thee with my am'rous Songs, “Do I not press my Suit, forget my Wrongs: “Whilst Night doth thy Horrizon overspread, “Thine Eyes are shut thou'rt streatch'd upon the Bed; “Ev'n then I woo and Love harrangues do make, “Repeat my Calls, and no Refusal take. “I break thro' Midnight Shades and Storms for you, “My Locks are wet (whilst I my Love pursue) “With th'evn'ing Drops, my Head with morning Dew. But my deceitful Heart was strongly bolt with Sin, I hug'd my Idols, would not let him in. My flaming Love was turn'd to Embers now, No Corner of my Heart to him allow. Impetuous Billows of Corruption rise, Temptation's Voice doth drown my Saviour's Cries. I yield to Lusts I formerly abhor'd, Treach'rously frame Excuses to my Lord: I've wash'd my Feet, to fit me for my Rest, My visit Cloths are off, I am undress'd. My Love was silent then, and spoke no more, But by a secret Hole his Hand thrust thro' the Door: He by his sovereign undiscovered Ways, Fresh Gales of Grace to my dead Soul conveys. He saw the Posture of my Sin-sick Soul, And fir'd my dead Heart with an Altar Coal. Quickly I rise, for I can sleep no more, To introduce my Lover from the Door; My Hands drop Myrrh, when to my Love I go Sweet smelling Myrrh my Fingers overflow, Upon the Handles of the Lock they drop, When I did open to my Joy and Hope I open'd wide my Heart to him: But he, To shew his Anger, had withdrawn from me. My vile Ungratitude now I bewail, I faint with Anguish, and my Soul doth fail: I offer Vows, but he no Vows would have: Loudly I cry'd, and he no Answer gave: All Means I try, and try them all in vain, He frowns and flies, and wont return again. The Watchmen, who directed me before, And gave me healing Balsoms for my Sore, Prove bad Comforters; they increase my Smart, And smite and wound me to the very Heart. The Keepers of the Walls no Cure affords; I'm kill'd and not comforted with their Words; They tell what I'm unwilling to confess, Unvail me to expose my Nakedness. O Daughters of Jerus'lem, if you find My Dear, my Well-belov'd, bid him be kind: O tell him that I dwine and pine with Love, I charge you that my Suit to him you move. DAUGHTERS of JERUSALEM. O thou the fairest among Womenkind, Who is this Well-belov'd you long to find? Doth he so far excell whom we do Love? Can you in him peculiar Beauties prove? What is your Well-belov'd you long to see? Can he surpass all others, who is he? Why charge you us, this Lover for to find? How can he be so good, yet so unkind? Bride. What do you ask? what Ignorance is this? Do you enquire what my Beloved is? He's white and ruddy, fair beyond Belief, Amongst Ten thousand Beauties he's the Chief, His Beauties singular, it can't be told, His Head shines brighter than the purest-Gold; The Church's Head, whom all with Love behold. His bushy Locks of Hair, the Church's Net, Is thick and long, and like the Raven Jet. His Eyes, which quickly thro' the World roves, Are pure and gentle, like the Eyes of Doves. As Doves Eyes wash'd in Streams of Milk do look, Whil'st they on sunny Bank sit beeking by the Brook, That's full of sprightly Vigor fitly set, Sparkling with Fire, and of a lovely Jet: So look these Eyes of his, these lovely Eyes, In which a thousand Charms and Beauty lies. As op'ning Flowers look in their vernal Airs; And Beds of Spice, which gay Enamel wears; So looks his Cheeks, when he to me appears. His Lips, like Lillies shaking with the Dew, Dropt with sweet smelling Myrrh, his Love to shew. As Gold Rings set with Beryl is his Hands, Which Wonders works, and all the World commands: Than Gold Rings set with Beryl far more bright; When they're display'd, they dazle humane Sight; Confound his Foes, and teach his Friends to fight. His Belly, whence the Church doth draw her Aid, Like Iv'ry bright, with Saphires overlaid. His Legs, which in the Paths of Truth do go, Are swift to bless, and to destroy are slow: Like Marble Pillars socketed with Gold, They're strong, well shap'd, and beautious to behold. His stately Steps are in his Temple shown, Yet not to all; 'tis only to his own. 'Twas there his Goings I was won't to see; But Sin hath drawn the Vail, 'twixt him and me. His Countenance like Lebanon is fair, Excellent like the lofty Cedars there. O sweet beyond Expression is his Mouth: He's altogether lovely, full of Truth. Thus faintly I've describ'd him, whom I love; A Theme too high for all the Quires above. This is my Friend, now do you not approve, O Daughters of Jerusalem, my Love. DIALOGUE. VI. Daughters of Jerusalem, Bride, Birdegroom. Daughters of Jerusalem. O what a Person is your well Belov'd, 'O what can be the Cause why he's remov'd? Tell us thou fairest amongst Womankind? We'll go in Quest of him, you long to find. Bride. Yes, I can tell you where he doth repair, Walk in his Garden, and you'll find him there. It's in that sacred Spot he loves to be; But, tho' I seek him there, he's hid from me. Tis 'mongst his Spicy Beds and Flowers he dwells, And feeds and feasts on their comforting Smells. Gathers these Lillies, which his Hands hath sown, Lillies by true Propriety his own. Yet why should I with anxious Cares repine, Since I am my Beloved's, he is mine. I am a Flower which in his Garden grows, He feeds 'mongst Lillies, I am one of those. Bridegroom. As Tirzah seated on a rising Ground, Tirzah for Strength and Beauty so renown'd, So beautiful art thou with Honour crown'd. O comely as Jerusalem art thou, To all who's holy Eyes thy Beauty view. But terrible to all thine Enemies, As conquering Armies in their victor Cries. O turn away thine Eyes my Love from me, I'm overcome, I'm ravished with thee. As pleasant 'tis from neighbouring Vales to view, The Flocks of brousing Goats on Gilead's Brow, Drink Nature's Cup, and sip the Morning's Dew. So pleasant 'tis my Love for to behold, Thy shining Rays of purest burning Gold: This Ornament thy Purity discovers, Kindles Desire, and gains thee many Lovers. When the lewd World thy Hair and Teeth shall view, They'll praise thy Beauty, fall in Love with you. They will believe thy Entertainment good, When such white Teeth do break the heavenly Food: Thy Teeth a comely Parity doth show, None start too high, and none do shrink too low: No proud o'ertoping Tooth thy Peace molest, Ev'n are they rank'd, none Prelates o'er the rest. Thy Teeth doth represent ? The new fleec'd Sheep disburthen'd of their Wool, When neatly shorn, and wash'd in Heshbon's Pool. In all the Flock no unprolifick Womb, Which Twins bring forth, and bleating lead them Home. Vail'd with thy Locks like Pom'granates appear Thy Temples, which a blushing Beauty wear: The Court of Solomon is wondrous fair, There's sixty Queens, and eighty Conc'bines there. There smiling Virgins without Number throng, Virgins that's chast and beautiful and young: These shining Comets turn as black's the Night, When thou appears, O radiant Lamp of Light. My Dove, my only One, my Undefil'd, Thy Mother's only and her darling Child, O Daughter born of God, I love thee well, Thy Cath'lick Truths shall Heresie dispell. The Daughters thou'lt conceive, begot by me, When they thy Government and Worship see, Drink thy pure Doctrine, eat thy strengthning Bread, Will beg my Blessings on thy lofty Head. Yea ev'n the Queens and Concubines shall view Thy Splendor, and be forc'd to bless thee too. Who's this looks forth, and chases Night away. Bright as these Beams which smiling brings the Day, Clear as the Moon, free from the Clouds of Night, Fair as the rising Sun, which brings the Light, [illeg.] terrible you look (the trembling World's afraid) As Armies with their Banners all display'd. I went the tender creeping Shrubs to view, And brambly Nuts, which in the Orchard grew, To see the Valleys and the lowly Plains, If they were stor'd with Flowers, refresh'd with Rains, If clustring Vines did flourish in the Field, What Buds the luscious Pom'granates did yield, When lo I spy my Bride in these sweet Groves; She swiftly flies to him, she dearly loves: Transported to behold my lovely Spouse, Whom I from all Eternity did chuse, Unto her Arms my self with haste I throw; As Chariots of Aminadab do go, When hastning to the Race, or lashing from the Foe. Return thou lovely Shulamite, return, For in strong Fires of Love for thee I burn. Bride or Shulamite. O! here's no Landskip to arrest your Sight, What can you see in the poor Shulamite? Yes, I have Beauty will attract your Eyes, Behold I've Troops to conquer Enemies; Each at his Post defended by his Shield With giant Strength the weighty Armour wield, I have two reg'lar Armies in the Field. DIALOGUE. VII. Bridegroom, Bride. Bridegroom. O Princes Daughter, noble is thy Birth, Thou'rt sprung from Heav'n, altho' ally'd to Earth. How beautiful's thy Feet, my charming Spouse, Richly adorned with the Gospel Shoes. Your full of Vigour, and your ever young, Thy Thighs are nervous, and they're firmly strung. As Jewels polish'd with the Workman's Art, So is thy Joints, thy Thighs, thy ev'ry Part. Thy Children form'd, soon to Perfection grows: Thy Navel's like the Cup which overflows: Thy Infants feed on Nourishment divine: Thy Navel's as a Goblet fill'd with Wine: Thy Womb's a fertile, not a barren Bed; Where Babes with proper Nourishment are fed: When ripe for solid and substantial Meat, O, then thy Belly's like a Sheaf of Wheat: O but its comely round that Sheaf to view, A row of aged Lillies sprung from you. Thy Saints are glad when Fellowship begins, They love thy swelling Breasts, and loath their Sins, Thy Breasts are like two tender Roes that's Twins. That strong conspicuous lofty Rock, thy Neck, Shall thee from all thy Enemies protect. It's amiable, as it is secure, A Fort impregnable, an Ivory Tow'r. Thy Eyes like Heshbon's Pools nigh Bethram's Streams, Fam'd for its Fish, and for its verdant Gleams, Clear are these Eyes as running silver Brooks, Thy Nose like Leb'non's Tow'r, which to Damascus looks; As Carmal o'er the Hills his lofty Head doth shew, You look to Heav'n, and smile on all below. Thy Head is richly deck'd with purple Hair: O every Part of thee is wondrous fair. When in our House I meet thee, I must stay, I'm chain'd with Charms, I cannot go away. How fair and lovely art thou to my Sight, I am thy Bridgroom, thou art all Delight: Thy Stature's like the Palm, and faultless is thy Shape: Thy Breasts are like the Clusters of the Grape: I'll to this Palm, which in my Garden grows, And sit with pleasure on the verdant Boughs. To me will prove the Fountain of thy Breast, Like Clusters of the Vine when newly press'd. Thy Nose such Perfumes as the Apple gives, When bending low the Sprig forsakes the Leaves. Thy Pallate, O my Spouse, is quick and good; Sweet is thy Relish of spiritual Food. The richest Wine which sparkles in the Bowl, Which drunk with Thirst, revives the fainting Soul And makes the drowzy rise with vigour up, And talk by Talents o'er the glad'ning Cup, Is not so pleasant, no it ne'er can be, As is thy holy Relish unto me. Thy Soul's Delight is set on Things divine, For thy Belov'd thou keeps thy richest Wine. BRIDE. My Soul's unite to him, I'll joy in this, That my Beloved's mine, and I am his; My Pardon's seal'd, his smiling Face I see, I'm dear to him, his Love is set on me. Thy Presence, my Beloved, warms my Heart, O to my Soul draw nigh, let's never part; Thro' Messech's Fields let us together go, Let's lodge in Kedar's Villages below. O lead and feed thy dearly purchass'd Spouse, Till she is brought unto the upper House: Unto thy Vineyard quickly let us bound, For that's thy Spot, thy own peculiar Ground: To view thy royal Nurs'ry, let us know, What sapless Trees decay, and which do grow; If Vines do flourish, and their Grapes appear, Hast'ning to ripe, the Planter's Heart to chear, If Pom'granates a lovely Garment wear. There I'll solace thee in these happy Groves, Charm thee with Faith, delight thee with my Loves: Comforting Flavours do my Mandrakes yield, A Wilderness of Sweets is my enclosed Field: The very Entry doth afford Delight, Where green and mellow Fruit arrest the Sight; For thee the Gardens dress'd, under this Shade Let us my dear Beloved make our Bed. DIALOGUE VIII. Bride, Bridegroom. BRIDE. I long to see these Halcyon-Days to come, When an incarnate God shall bless a Virgin's Womb. O Shadows fly away, O Time draw near, When thou in humane Nature shall appear, With all our sinless Miseries opprest, Become a Child and suck the Mother's Breast. Without Jerus'lem's Wall I'll find my Lord, For every Place his Presence shall afford; Then shall I Kiss thee and not be revil'd, When Gentiles see the Prophecy fulfill'd: Unto my Mother's House, my Lord I'll bring, For she'll instruct me how to please my King. We'll walk in Pomp like those, whom nuptial Rites Unto the joyful Weding-House invites: My Bridegroom drink the spiced Wine of Love, Like Juice of Pom'granates 'twill cheering prove; He won't be 'sham'd to own me for his Bride, He will not for my holy Freedom chide. His right Hand shall embrace me whilst we feed, And his left Hand be underneath my Head, I charge you, O Jerus'lem's Daughters, then That you a constant Fellowship maintain, Wait for the dawning of the glorious Morn, When he the true Messias shall be born. O see when ye his Presence do enjoy, That no Offence your lovely Guest annoy; Do not awake him with Corruption's Noise, If you'd be fill'd with strong tumultuous Joys. I charge you then, you don't disturb his Ease; Force him not to remove before he please. BRIDEGROOM. Who's this so strongly bent for heav'nly Bless, With eager haste springs from the Wilderness; No rugged Paths she fears, she can't be mov'd, For she is leaning on her Well-belov'd. O happy Traveller, from this earthly Ball, Who leans on him, who cannot let her fall. Under the shadow of the Apple Tree, I found a Bride and drew her unto me; Thy Mother in that Shade conceived you, And underneath its Boughs I found thee too: Thy Mother bore thee there, and then was blest, With the Reward of all her Labours past. BRIDE. My Love let me thy dear Affection feel, Imprint me on thy Heart, there stamp me as a Seal; Upon thy Arm let me engraven be, There fix me as a Seal, love's Signet make thou me. O let my flame of Love be satisfied, Loves Floods o'erwhelm me with a raging Tide; Love's strong as Death, who can withstand its Power, When jealous like the Grave it doth devour. I'm, my beloved, jealous of thy stay, What keeps my Love? What makes the long delay? Loves Coals burn fiercer than the Coals of Fire, O vehement's the Flames of Loves Desire: Ten Thousand Rivers, cannot quench my Rage, Nay the whole Ocean can't the Flames asswage. These feed it's burning Lust; it's fiery Womb The Floods and Rivers and the Seas o'ercome: When once a Fire he kindles in the Mind, The Soul no Pleasure in the World can find; The cordial Drops of Heaven it longs to have, The World turns Trash, seems rotten like the Grave. Love won't capitulate with th'earthly Man, Christ's only fair, and all the World looks wan: Should Earth give Bribes, Heav'ns Lover to forsake, An Offer of its choicest Treasures make, Give all the Substance of the World, 'twould prove In vain to these inflam'd with heav'nly Love. Earth's lost its Lustre, he's the dazling Gem; Presents of Gold they'd scornfully contemn; They court a Crown a heav'nly Diadem. But, O sweet Lover! whilst I pant for thee, Breath short, and gasp, thy Glory for to see, Whilst humbly I implore thy Love and Grace, And fondly court the Shinings of thy Face, Dare I forget our little Sister's Case. My Love, we have a little Sister, she, Invelopt in a Cloud thy Beauty cannot see, Exert almighty Pow'r, and draw her unto thee. She hath no Breasts, she's a deformed Vine; Yet she's thy future Spouse, then make her thine, Deck her with wedding Robes and make her shine. O when thy forming Fingers moulds her right, And she looks glorious in the World's sight, In Pomp appears, and shines with heav'nly Light. O what shall we for our dear Sister do, To bring her nigh and wed her unto you: When you'll thy long delayed Visit make, What shall we do for our dear Sister's sake, That she may of our Privilege partake. Yes, firmly we're resolv'd upon the thing, We'll her with solemn Preparation bring, Upon the Wedding-Day to meet the King. If she for Strength like brazen Wall appear, Upon her silver Palaces we'll rear: If she a Door do prove, thy En'mies to keep out, She's be enclos'd with Cedar-Boards about. With Beauty, Strength and Honour she'll command, And spread her numerous Issue thro' the Land; Her Greatness the astonish'd World shall see; In Strength and Grandeur she shall rival me. Me, whom the envying World do Happy call, A Rock impregnable, a Castle Wall. I am a Wall, my swelling Breasts are Tow'rs, But Oh, my Love, my Strength and Beauties yours! From thee the Fountain Head, my Mercies rise; For I found Grace and Favour in thine Eyes: Hence I'm thro' all the Universe renound, Because thou has my Head with Glory crown'd, And I with Grace and Love and Strength abound. I'll tell the list'ning World what he's done, I'll sound the Praises of my Solomon: For me, King Solomon was at the pains T'enclose a Vineyard in Balhamon's Plains. He farm'd it out to Labourers for a Rent, Ten thousand Pieces was the Equivalent Each Keeper yearly to the Land-Lord sent. The Fruit rewarded ev'ry virtuous one; Enrich'd the Frugal, but it starv'd the Dron: My Vineyard, which is mine, before me lies; It's still the darling Object of mine Eyes. O Solomon, the Rents be paid by me, A Thousand silver Pieces I'll give thee, Each Keeper of the Fruit two hundred for their Fee. O thou who dwellest in the gladsome Grove Behold the dear Companions of my Love Listen unto the Musick of thy Tongue, And never think the blessed Hours too long; No, they are all in Rapture with thy Song. When they're made glad, being intertain'd by you, Make me a Sharer in the Pleasures too; With equal Warmth and Gratitude rejoyce, I'll in strong Numbers sing with rapt'rous Noise, When I in Consort join, and hear my Lovers Voice. O my Beloved! fly with Lovers haste! O! when shall Days and Hours, and Years be past, And Time, dull tedious Time, no longer last. Make swift Approaches, let my Bridgroom go Swiftly, as on the Spicy Hills the Roe: Swifter than the young nimble Hart can flie Let thy Appearance unto Judgment be; I shall be Happy then thro' all Eternitie. A Sabbath-Days Thoughts UPON THE Love of Jesus. Proles vera Dei cunctisque antiquior annis Nunc genitus qui semper eras. Claud. With heavenly Eloquence, Lord, fill my Soul, O fire my dead Heart with an Altar Coal: Not from Parnassus, but from Zion's Hill Let sacred Streams into my Heart distill. Inspire my Heart with strong Seraphick Verse, A Saviour's melting Mercies to rehearse; I'll sing mysterious Love to all the Universe. O bounteous Heaven, thy Mercy I adore, Thou Blessings gives till I can ask no more; Blessings, which I cou'd never thought upon, The Rich, the Royal Gift, thy only Son. Before thy Power and Wisdom was display'd, In this bright Fabrick which thy Hands have made, Whilst th'Elements did in dark Chaos sleep, Ere yet thy Spirit brooded o'er the Deep, Or shining Angels took their Seats above, Thy blessful Bosom Glory hatch'd and Love; Thy sempeternal Love was fixt on Man, Ere he a Being got, or Time began: Th'eternal Counsel had decreed his Peace, For thy Delight was with the unborn Race. Six Days the new born World had seen the Sun, When God review'd the wondrous Works he'd done; The young Creation he beheld with Joy, But Man was wanting yet, the great Vice-Roy: God gives him Being, and imperial Sway, He stamps his Image on the living Clay; To Man an high Immortal Soul is given, Capable of Intelligence with Heaven. In Eden's Courts, th'Almighty's depute King In Honour and in Innocence did reign; The Vassal Brutes with Acclamations meet Their Monarch, and pay Homage at his Feet: Freely commanded all his Eyes did see, Except a single Sacramental Tree. Touch not its Fruit, you dy if this you do, Was the Reddendo of th'Almighty's Feu: But Heaven's Friend and Favorite did rebel, From Grandeur, and from sweet Communion fell, Sunk with his Sin and Guilt, became an Heir of Hell. 'Mongst Bushes sneakes, to hide his blushing Face, At once he forfeit Paradise and Grace, Destroy'd himself and all his unborn Race. Expell'd th'Elysium he enjoy'd before, Whilst armed Cherubims defend the Door, Poor fall'n Adam must return no more. He from delicious Arbors posts away, Where Summer dwells, and every Month is May: No more God's blooming Garden doth he tread, Flowers hang their withered Heads, their Master's fled The Morning Lark awakes with piteous Moan, The lovely Empire's sunk, her Monarch's gone; And th'Evening Philomel laments the vacant Throne. With mournful Ditties, sing's the drooping Thrush, And tragick Threnes are heard from every Bush; Complaining Notes tell all the Quire's oppress'd, Thy solemn Dirgies sing with throbing Breast. The Nightinagle forgets to build her Nest, With melancholy Murmurs Rivers flow, They chide their Banks, and pebbles as they go. Waves roll with double Force, and haste away, To bury Grief and Sorrow in the Sea. Fair Eva visites not the chrystal Brook, The chrystal Glass no more returns her Look. The watery Mirrour shews no more her Face, Like Angels, full of Majesty and Grace; Ah, Now its stain'd with Sin and black with deep Disgrace. Winds whistle thro' the leaves their angry Breath; All Nature's pregnant with the Signs of Wrath. No more the simples Smile; the myrtle Shade, Where the dear happy Lovers took their Bed, Seems now alone for sighing Sinners made. The fatal Fruit hath pull'd the Monarch down, Satan triumphs for Adam's lost the Crown; He cannot look to God, nor bear his angry Frown. Ah, must he dy! Can no Relief be found? Yes, Mercy comes to heal the bleeding Wound; Free Grace and Love ope' up a glorious Scene, God's reconcil'd, and Man's restor'd again. Adam is Victor, Satan quits the Field, Lo there's a Promise, made, a Christ reveald; From all Eternity it was decreed, Th'Elect's be saved by the Woman's Seed, A Saviour shall be born to bruise the Serpents Head. Mary's Conception in appointed Time, Fully atone for Mother Eva's Crime: The flaming Sword, which Seraphs did command, Shines in a glorious Mediator's Hand: Th'Angel of the Cov'nant saves from Sin, Opens Heavens Gates, and leads Believers in. Exulting Prophets spread the News abroad, And legal Pomp proclaims th'approaching God: Isaiah's Voice transports the list'ning Throng, His hallowed Lips pour forth the Gospel Song. “From your low Posture and obscure retreat “Arise and shine, and feel the welcome Heat; “No more ly folded in the Arms of Night, “Lo your Horizon's cloth'd with Beams of Light. “No Torch we need t'illuminate the Way, “The rising Sun doth chase the Shades away; “We'll bask in Beams of Light and bless the joyful Day. “O yes, o yes, on this transparent Morn, “A Virgin shall bring forth, Immanuel shall be born: Thus spoke Messiah's Harbenger of old, Who with divine Impulse the Olive-Age fortold; So gilds the rising Morn, the wide Expanse, Ere Sol in golden Chariot doth advance; To invite the drousie World from Orpheus's Chains, Awakes the Earth to view the opening Scenes. The Jessian Babe's fortold in every Age, Old Testament Bards, who shook with sacred Rage, Record th'auspicious Birth; the God's in every Page. The Prophets Breasts were pain'd with holy Flame Till they reveal his Power, and sing his glorious Name: A glader Voice is heard, when they are dead, The Evangelick Prophet doth succeed. On barren Heaths the Preacher doth appear, In rustick Weed, a Web of Camels Hair, Who's venerable Figure doth exhort, To hate the gaudy Fin'ry of a Court. Plain like his Looks and Sermons he is dress'd, A leathern Girdle wrapt around his Waste: The reverend Fawn, in Life and Looks austere, No Carnival e'er knew his Diet spare. No Pickles did fresh Appetite provoke, He Locusts eat, and Honey from the Rock; His pious Life was one continued Lent, The Sum of all his Eloquence, repent. Malachy's divine Prophesies made clear, A loud melodious Voice proclaims a Saviour near: “Prepare, prepare to meet the coming God, “Level each rugged Passage of his Road. “Welcome the Son of God from's Throne above, “Meet him upon his Embassy of Love: “With joyful Hearts a filial Homage pay, “Make straight the crooked Paths, prepare a Saviour's Way. Heaven's new created Gem, In its æther'al Hight Gave the Persian Pilgrims Light; When they to Salim's Palace came, Burning with sacred Flame: To see the Babe they strove, Who dropt his Lawn of Light above, So strong is a Redeemer's Love. Here's Salim's Courts, they say, but where's the God Who's Fame did swiftly fly t'us abroad? For this bless'd Babe we've left the East, 'Tis Love that pains our throbing Breast, Our Arms must round his Waste be curl'd, We'll kneel and sacrifice to him, the Sovereign of the World. In the Metropolis of Judea's Land, Herod did with uubounded Will command, But trembl'd when he heard a Rival at his Hand, With tingling Ears The News he hears; Conveens the Tribes, Chief Priests and Scribes. To dissipate his Fears. In Praise of Jesus all the learned Doctors sung, Jesus, from the Empyreum Heaven sprung; In Beth'lem shall be born the Lord, Micah's Words are on Record. Judea shall Report Beth'lem her royal Court, Within those Walls shall reign Jesus fam'd Israel's King, The Son of God, to him shall all resort. Herod then was more afraid, Asked when the Star appear'd, Which did them hither bring; The Eastern Sages told the Story; Go find out the Child of Glory: The old Tyrrant said, Worships be paid, Even by me, I'll own him King. With sprightly Hopes, the Rabbies haste, Conducted by the Star i'th' West: Heaven's Torch they saw with rapid Joy: It roll'd with trails of Light, and stood above the Royal Boy. MEDITATIONS In Sickness, Upon several Texts of Scripture relating to the Resurrection. MEDITATION I. [Servet opus Deus ille Deus, quo territa tellus] Then shall the Sun be darkned. Matth. xxiv. 29. And lo there was a great Earthquake, and the Sun became black as Sackcloth of Hair, and the Moon became as Blood. Rev. vi. 12. Servet opus Deus ille Deus, quo territa tellus Concutiente tremit, montes tangente vaporant, Fumifera trepidum nebula testante pavorem. Buch. Ps. A grand Ecclipse will darken all the Globe. The Sun shall rise cloth'd with a mourning Robe; Light's sweet, 'tis pleasant to behold the Sun, But Ah, his Eyes are shut, his Years are run! From pitchy Air falls down the dying Lark, Men stumble at Noon-Day, and justle in the Dark: The World's bright Eye sees all Things in Confusion, He weeps till blind, at Natures Dissolution: His Light and Heat would useless be for ever, Since all the World is dying of a Fever. No more pale Cynthia yields her silver Light, She wades in Blood, a strange amazing Sight! No more can she her borrowed Lustre shew, Exhausted is her Stock; her Brother's Bankrupt now. She us'd to change, that she might shine more bright; But now she's chang'd to Blood and gives no Light: She sees the End of Time, and fickens at the Sight, The Seas swell high to meet the falling Skies, Above the lofty Hills her Billows rise; And bellowing Monsters fill the Air with Cries. The Mountains tumble down unto the Lake, The Rocks, and all Lunatick Nature shake; Wild Beasts distracted in the Forrests roar, And Mortals stagger on the tot'ring Floor: All Nature doth convulsive Motions fell, And to the Noise of Thunder dance the Reel. MEDITATION II. [My Soul come meditate the Day] And the Sea gave up the Dead which were in it; and Death and Hell gave up the Dead which were in them. Rev. xx. 13. And the Angel which I saw stand upon the Sea, and upon the Earth, lift up his Hand to Heaven, &amp;c. And swore that Time shall be no more. Rev. x. 5, 6. My Soul come meditate the Day, And think how near it stands, When thou must quite this House of Clay, And fly to unknown Lands. Waitt's spirit. Song. The Dead all startle with the Trumpet's Breath, Which bursts the Graves, dissolves the Bands of Death: The gloomy Grave proves faithful to her Trust, Returns her Spoils, spues out her Skulls and Dust. All Flesh get up, old Adam rises first, Near to the Garden where he was accurs'd; And Grand-Dame Eve starts up at Adam's Side, Lovely and Fair, as when she was his Bride. She looks on Paradise, and streight turns wan, For oh, 'twas there, Rebellion began: Poor Adam casts his Eyes upon the Earth, And sees it lab'ring in the Pangs of Birth. The Patriarchs who'ye sleept six thousand Year, Sleep not so sound but they the Trumpet hear; Shake off their Sheets of Dust, and in the Field appear. The Tombs of Kings throw out their Skeletons, And Flesh grows quickly on the living Bones; Then falls the Mon'ment down unto a rick of Stones. From various Gibbets, Malefactors Bones, Bleech'd with the Winds, and brunt with Summer Suns, Drop from the Chains, to gather up their Dust, Fall into Ranks, 'mongst Wicked or the Just: They hear a Sound was never heard before, Gabriel proclaims that Time shall be no more: The grand Audite, the last Assize is come, To judge the World, and give eternal Doom. Now Saints do rise in Triumph over Death, And Sinners rise to feel Almighty Wrath: The pious Soul warm'd with a holy Heat, Who often cry'd, where doth the Lord retreat, O did I know, I would approach his Seat, With holy haste flys to the sacred Place, And sees mild Mercy shining in his Face. MEDITATION III. In a Moment, in the twinkling of an Eye, at the last Trump, (for the Trumpet shall sound) the Dead shall be rais'd incorruptible. 1 Cor. xv. 52. The Works of the Lord are great; sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. Psal. cxi. 11. I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Psal. cxxxix. 14. A gastly Sight, for lo the Dead arise, Some without Arms and others without Eyes: Till these come flying on the Wings of Wind, From diff'rent Airths no more to be disjoin'd; No single Atom of the Body's lost, Each Part reviv'd crawls to its former Post. Leaping with Life, the Hand finds out the Skull; The Heart with Blood, runs till the Veins are full; The Pulses beat, such is the Pow'r of God; Shin-Bones come leaping to receive their Load: The quicken'd Dust creeps from its loathsome Den, And Stink, and Vermine turns to living Men. Almighty Pow'r rebuilds the stately Dome, Behold the Pillars and the Beams do come; The Bones are artificially unite, Fresh oyl'd with Marrow, moisten'd full of Heat. The Breast is cover'd with the Sternum-Bone, The Skelet now hath got his Breast-Plate on: That Stomach, Heart and Lungs, be free from Harm, Lo seven strong Ribs do clasp them in their Arm, Whose bonny Heads the Vertebræ doth find, Their right Ends are unto the Sternum join'd. Five bastard Ribs, the Belly doth invest; The last and least, hangs loosely from the rest. The Head's complete, the Vertebræ is sent, To join this Island to the Continent. Atlas whose Foot stands on the Shoulder-Blade, Supports this Wise, this glorious Globe the Head: Th'indented Sutures closely join in one, All's safe within, the warlike Helmet's on. For sure Defence, the Skull receives the Brains, The Breast, with all its Parts, the Ribs sustains: The Brain's enthron'd in their strong lofty Tow'r, Th'an'mal Spirits elaborate as before: Which the miraculous Machine preserves, Circ'lating thro' their Vehicles, the Nerves, Thro' various Ducts and Rivuletes they flow, Dispensing Blessings to the Parts below. The Heart, which now with vital Heat doth burn, To its old Purse and Thorax doth return; Amidst its ancient Lobes resumes its Seat, Like standing Clock-wind up, begins to beat: Sets all the Springs to Work, maintains them all, Conveys brisk Streams thro' many a hid Canal: Which thro' meandring Veines, with gentle Course Do glide, and then return unto their Source. So all the Rivers run unto the Deep, The Parent doth the Childrens Portion keep: In her Exchequer all the Treasure lies, From thence is issued out in fresh Supplies. The Lungs do beat, the Bronchy's full of Air, Caus'd by the Pressure of the Atmos-Sphere; Which by Elastick Virtue entrance hath, Filling the empty Cavaties with Breath. The Bellows fully blown, severely swell'd, Compressed by the Thorax is repell'd: Thus Respiration's constantly perform'd, The needful Air suck'd in, anon return'd. The Curtains drawn, these lum'nous Globes the Eyes. Roll in their Orbs with wonder and surprise; Plac'd in the hollow Sockets of the Skull, With Muscles cled, to make the motion full: Now from th'exalted Mansion they behold, The Truth of what th'inspir'd Job fortold. I know that my Redeemer lives, My dear Lord Jesus comes, To judge the Earth in Righteousness, And raise us from our Tombs. Tho' Worms devour my Flesh and Bones When I am turn'd to Clay, These Eyes of mine shall see the Lord, At the great Judgment Day, The spreading Ears the son'rous Trumpets hear With strong Concussions of th'external Air; The auditory Nerves all start for fear. They hear a Sound was never heard before, Gabriel proclaims that Time shall be no more. Th'august Tribunal's in the Rain-Bow plac'd, To this high Court all Men and Angels haste; Lo there's Heav'ns Pursevants and Heraulds bright, With glorious Robes of pure æther'al Light. Titius the Pleader, is a Pannel now, Blushes succeeds the Brass o'erspread his Brow. Learn'd Æsculapius minds no Pill or Potion; The Aomon promises no Declination: Nature's upon an Chymick Operation, The Sea it self can't quench this Conflagration. The Infant World did in hot Lust abound, And was by Heav'ns Electuaries drown'd, In Dottage now, she still more vicious grows, And therefore dies by a Mercurial Dose. The Sun and Moon from their high Orbs do wander, Falling calcine the World to a Cynder. A DISCRIPTION OF THE Person of Jesus Christ, Written by Publius Lentulus President of Judeah, to the Senate of Rome. Judea's famous grown; 'tis the abode Of Jesus Christ, a Prophet sent from God: His Disciples call him a Deity, Worship him as the Son of the most high; A Man of holy Life and spotless Purity. His mighty Pow'r and Miracles is such, He cureth all Deseases with a touch: A single Word doth from his Mouth proceed, And opens Graves, and calls to Life the Dead. Of rev'rend Aspect, comely in each Feature; Well shap'd in Body, and he's tall in Stature. Of Chasnut Colour is his matchless Hair, Which falls in graceful Curles below the Ear; From thence more orient doth his Shoulders meet, His Head's partition'd like the Nazarite. Smooth, large and beautifull is his Forehead: No Spots his Cheeks hath, save a lovely Red. His Mouth and Nose so form'd, and so agree, There is 'mongst them a perfect Symetrie. His beard is forked, thick and fully grown, In Colour like his Hair a Chasnut Brown, Extends in Length an Inch below his Chin. His Eyes are quick and bright; serene he looks: Counsels with Mildness; sharp in his Rebukes. His whole Deportment Wisdom's Lessons teach; In Action grave, and Eloquent in Speech. His Countenance a deep Composure keeps: Never is seen to Laugh, but often Weeps. His modest Face sweet Innocence displays; He's most Abstemious, Chast, and wond'rous Wise. A matchless Beauty in the Man doth shine; He's full of all Perfections divine: For Wisdom, Sanctity, and comely Face, He far surpasseth all the humane Race. P. Lentulus, P. J. On Devout Dorinda, Reading the Westminster Confession of Faith. That Book I own is full of Grace and Wit, But 'twas for Men, and not for Angels writ; Why doth my Cherub humane Lectures read; 'Tis Angels Knowledge best expounds the Creed. O thou'rt a Volume fraught with Grace and Sense, L'Estrange did never so much Wit licence. You are the kind Instructress of the Age, Thy Lifes a Transcript of the sacred Page: Then throw that useless Book upon the Shelf, For thou art all Divinity thy self. On a fair Lady, Dispencing Medicines in her Lazar House. O what a sight of wretched Folk is here, And Stink enough for to pollute the Air: There's Agnes, Jaundice, Cancer, and the Pox, And ev'ry Plague flew from Pandora's Box. She's like the Sun, who darts his radiant Beams On Dunghills, yet not injur'd by their Steams: She Miracles doth work like Aarons Rod, (She is not taught by Gallen, but by God.) Her Hand drys up the long infected Flood; Sure there's Balsamick Virtue in her Blood: See how she looks upon a yellow Face, And prints a Beauty on the swarthy Place. She stretches forth her healing Hand to save, And with a touch she disappoints the Grave: O strange! she bids the dying Lazar live; She breathes on rotten Bones and they revive. O cure my wounded Heart, Physician bright, I see that Healing is thy native Right: Your Power's too strong for any Maladie, Shall ev'ry Patient here be cur'd save me; You gave the Wound your self, O give the Remedie. THE Fair MAID OF DUMBLAIN. Me fabulosæ vulture in Apulo, Altricis extra limen Apulia, Ludo fatigatumque somno, Fronde nova Puerum Palumbes Texere; mirum quod foret omnibus Ut tuto ab artis corpore viperis, Dormirem, &amp; ursis; ut premerer sacra, Lauroque, collataque myrto, Non sine dis animosus infans. Hor. The Authors of Romances and Novels Talk big of flut'ring Beaux and sparkling Belles; Strephon the Lovers sprung from noble Blood, And Cœlia is a rich and lovely Prude: To great Folk Cupid only is a Guest; Love dare not reign in a Plebeian Breast: The Poor do like unthinking Atoms dance, And marry, as the World was made, by Chance. This Poets and Philosophers advance: Wise as they are, they may be in the wrong, Altho' the last was great Lucretius's Song. The Gods, say they, have a superiour Care, A thousand Sylphs sit on Belinda's Hair; Protect bright Cloe when she plays at Omber: And being aerial Spirits cannot Slumber. These Ladys guard at Tea and Mattadores, Because they're Rich and Great, tho sometimes W? The Gods despise a Linsey Woolsey Gown; But to the rusling Silks Respect is shown. Yet under Favour, 'tis not my Opinion, For little Cupid hath a large Dominion. Great Wits may with their learned Logick fail, And I with my blunt Eloquence prevail: Then hear with Patience this my Covntry Tale. In Days of Old, when Kenneth rul'd the Nation, And Trews and naked Buttocks were in Fashion, Maids did not Fence their Bums with Ribs of Whales But just as Nature made them wore their T?ls. The Scope of all love Tales and am'rous Charms Is to have naked Meg claspt in our Arms. There liv'd within an humble Highland Cottage An honest Pair, but both of them in Dottage, Donald, who never heard of foreign News, Convers'd with Horse and Sheep and droves of Cows. Jolly Marg'ry was his aged Spouse: Twice twenty Years made up their wedlock State; Their Means were competent, not very great; A lovely Daughter bless'd their hoary Hairs, The only Pledge of all their youthful Years. For Stature, Manners and a lovely Face, She was the very Proverb of the Place; The Darling of her Family and Friends; In blooming Youth just enter'd in her Teens. The beauteous Maid, Corisca was her Name, Thro' neighbouring Shires had spread a lasting Fame From ev'ry Corner of the Country came A Lover, to make known his am'rous Flame. A learn'd Clerk, five Tradesmen, and a Swain Call'd Colin, who dwelt in the neighbouring Plain, Made up the Number of Corisca's Train. The Scribe was famous for his ploding Nodle, Told her dark Stories out of Aristotle, Was very grave, but Colin took his Bottle. The Tradesmen they were wealthy proud and vain; But Colin was an honest humble Swain. Tho' rich as Cræsus, and as wise as Solon, Corisca would have none, save only Colin. Small worldly Substance fell to Colin's Share; But he was open, plain and debonair, Of equal Temper, stedfast as the Rocks, Chearful as May and harmless as his Flocks: Good Face, good Shapes, good Nature, and good Sense Are Qualities should make a Man a Prince. Colin enjoy'd these in a high degree; Corisca lov'd him well, and only he. Her Parents Government was soft and mild, They never spoke but when they spoke they smil'd, And she knew all the Duties of a Child. On Morning aged Donald and his Wife Says Daughter, you're the Solace of our Life, Our Age's prop, our Joys of Life are gone, And yours, sweet Child, we hope are drawing one. O bring us not with Sorrow to the Grave, It's but a single Favour that we crave, Wed ere we dy, but don't with Colin wed, And when we've seen you in the nuptial Bed; Our aged, crazy, tot'ring Bones, we trust, Will soon thereafter sleep in peaceful Dust. Mournful Corisca knew not what to do; Loth to refuse, and loth to make the Vow; She did the last as safest of the two. Parents, she says, 'tis you that gave me Life, Till you Consent, I ne'er shall be a Wife. Hear me ye Heav'ns, I make this sacred Vow, To Marry as my Parents shall allow. But Maidens Vows are Wind, and nothing else: And this the sequel of my Story tells. Once as the Sun the western Skies stole down, And in the East arose the silver Moon; Now toyling Heifers, wounded with the Goad, Are all released from the servile Load: Now from the Moors the Hunters homeward ride With umquhile Maukin dangling at their Side: From distant Hamlet hungry School-Boy comes, With runing Nose, and blowing o'er his Thumbs: To neighb'ring Ale-House tipling Curate goes With tatter'd Crape to take a deep Carouse: From verdant Woods with sounding Horns the Swains Bring home the milky Mothers of the Plains. Corisca goes to Boughts to milk the Ews, And spys her Colin whistl'ing o'er the Knows, Driving his Charge down to the nightly Fold; His yellow Hair was like the streaming Gold; He grac'd his Trews his Crook and Tartan-Plade; As fine as Kenneth was the Swain arrai'd. The Lass was singing with a thoughtless Air, For, saving Love, she had no wordly Care. Corisca chuckled when the Lad she view'd; A Joy went tingling thro' her Mass of Blood. Once she had growing Thoughts to be his Wife; A rapid Pleasure touch'd the Strings of Life. Colin soon folded up his woolly Drove, And runs to quench his eager Thirst of Love. Kind Words he spoke, his weary'd Head did rest Upon the peaceful Pillow of her Breast. Around her Waste his loving Arm was spread; There he solac'd upon the downy Bed. Often did Colin his Corisca kiss, The certain Pledges of a future Bless. The loving Pair upon green Pastures lay; And made the Ev'ning for to crown the Day. Beneath a Willow's cooling Shade, Natures soft and mossie Bed, Th'am'rous Couple lay: Colin felt a burning Flame, Wish'd for what he durst not name; At last began to say, Corisca shall I sing a Song; I'll not make it very long: You have half an Hour to spare, Ere you milk your fleecy Care: I have driv'n the Ews too fast, Let them get a little rest. You'll not think the Time too long, We'll beguile it with a Song. How a Shepherd lov'd a Lass, And did Court her on the Grass; But the Maid was cruel Coy, And refus'd to wed the Boy: With the Grief his Heart he broke, He leapt over a steep Rock: Thus he made an End of Life, Since she would not be his Wife. Corisca says, dear Colin sing, Musick is a pleasant Thing. Sure the Woman has been Mad, For to kill a loving Lad. Colin's Heart was wond'rous glad, When he heard the Words she said. Soon did he begin to sing, And made all the Valleys ring: But so mournful was the Tale, It invited Philomel; Who did hear the Musick sweet, And doth still the Notes repeat. A SONG To the Tune of Morning O Geberland. PROLOGUE. A furlong or so from bonny Dumblain Liv'd a fair Nymph and an am'rous Swain; Colin was the Name of the Swain, Corisca the Maid created his Pain. He lov'd her beyond all the Comforts of Life, Pray'd daily to Heav'n she might be his Wife. Her Hair is like the heckl'd Lint, Quo Colin, quo Colin, But her Heart is hard as Flint, Quo Colin, quo Colin, Her Face is like the rising Moon, Quo Colin, quo Colin, Clearer than a silver Spoon, Quo Colin, quo Colin. Red like Claret is her Cheeks, Quo Colin, quo Colin. And they Dimple when she speaks, Quo Colin, quo Colin. Her Lips doth wear a scarlet Dy, Quo Colin, quo Colin. Like Cherries in the Month of May, Quo Colin, quo Colin. Her Teeth is like the Iv'ry Bone, Quo Colin, quo Colin. But her Heart like pumice Stone, Quo Colin, quo Colin. Her Breasts are whiter than the Snow, Quo Colin, quo Colin. Softer than Hauss-locks of the Ew, Quo Colin, quo Colin. Whiter is her Legs and Thighs, Quo Colin, quo Colin. Than the Curds which makes the Cheese, Quo Colin, quo Colin. Long and slender is her Waste, Quo Colin, quo Colin. It would tempt the Parish Priest, Quo Colin, quo Colin. Tho' he were an Anchorite, Quo Colin, quo Colin. To enjoy a Nymph so sweet. Quo Colin, quo Colin. When she sits on Hills or Rocks, Quo Colin, quo Colin. Soon do I forsake my Flocks, Quo Colin, quo Colin. She doth kill me with her Eyes, Still rolling, still rolling. But she cares not for my Crys, Quo Colin, quo Colin, Takes no notice of my Sighs, Quo Colin, quo Colin. Long I've courted this fair Maid, Quo Colin, quo Colin. But she slighted all I said Quo Colin, quo Colin, I am weary'd of my Life, Quo Colin, quo Colin, Since she will not be my Wife, Quo Colin, quo Colin. I'll forsake my Friends and Flocks, Quo Colin, quo Colin, And fly over steepy Rocks, Quo Colin, quo Colin. Life without her's full of Trouble, Quo Colin, quo Colin. Nothing but a silly Bubble, Quo Colin, quo Colin. In Loves Rage he left his Sheep, Poor Colin, poor Colin, And did take the fatal Leap, Poor Colin poor Colin. When Corisca heard the News, She forsakes her Lambs and Ews, For Colin, for Colin. When she saw the Swain was dead, Poor Colin, poor Colin, She fell Sick and took her Bed For Colin, for Colin. Distracted with the Grief she cry'd For Colin, for Colin, And gave up the Ghost and dy'd, For Colin, for Colin. Corisca heard her Colin's artful Tale, Minded her Vow, but Nature did prevail. Colin, says she, the Story can't be true, For I ne'er heard one of that Name save you. If Fact, Corisca's been a cruel Creature, And wanted all the softness of my Nature. Colin replies, Part's true of what I've said; I am the Swain and you the cruel Maid. Long have I courted you my charming Fair, But you are Deaf to Colin's ev'ry Pray'r. I hear you've sworn by the Pow'rs above, Never to entertain your Colin's Love. And did the dottard Fools extort the Vow; Cruel Corisca, shall I think it true. To such an unjust View have no Respect; Or break your Vow, or I will break my Neck. I'm not, she says, unflexible to Love, Could I, dear Colin, this curs'd Vow remove. To break my Vow, dare I be so unjust, 'Twould send my aged Parents to the Dust. What then, says Colin, will it be a Crime To give them Heav'n a Year before their Time: O 'tis an Action that will make you thrive, To keep the loving Colin still alive. Thus Colin spoke, and did her Heart betray, She broke her Vow, and marry'd him next Day. The End of the second Part.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART III. From amber Shrouds I see the Morning rise, Her rosie Hand begins to paint the Skies. And now the City Emmits leave their Hive; And rouzing Hinds to chearful Labour drive. High Clifts and Rocks are pleasant Objects now, And Nature smiles upon the Mountains Brow. The joyful Lark, salutes the Sun's approach, The Sun too Laughs, and mounts his gawdy Coach: While from his Carr the dropping Gems distill, And all the Earth, and all the Heav'ns do smile. Lee. A Morning Walk TO ARTHUR's SEAT, On the First Day of May. I wander where the Muses haunt, To shady Groves, clear Spring, or sunny Hill, Smit with the Love of sacred Song. Milt. Last Night opprest with sullen Grief I lay, Upon th'uneasie Couch, indulging Sorrow: My Soul disturbed with a Chain of Mis'ries. Job's melancholy Plaints was now my Theme, Like him I wish'd my Sorrows on record, Engraven deeply with a Pen of Iron. The mournful Job, who 'mongst the Ashes lay, Open'd his Mouth to curse the weary Day. O'erwhelm'd with Grief and Pain deep Silence broke: And secret Charms in wond'rous Words he spoke. Perish ye dismal Day, commenc'd my infant Years: O blasted be that Night, which louring Aspect wears: That fatal Night of Blessings be't bereav'd, In which the pregnant Womb th'unhappy Male conceiv'd. Dark be the fatal Day ? Let massie Clouds form the Cimmerian Night: No twinkling Tapers dart small Rays of Light, The God, who made it, curse it from from above, O may it never see his Light nor Love. Heap Darkness on't for Tokens of thy Wrath, O be it mantled o'er with Shades of Death. May lasting Clouds, thick as the Mists of Hell, Descend upon't perpetually to dwell. Unheard of Darkness-fix upon the Air, Terrors fly round the Glob, t'encrease the Fear, Let baleful Blackness darken down the Night, Nor Moon or Stars command the least of Light. May they this Night restrain their blessful Rays, No more this Night be join'd to wellcome Days. Lop off this Night's Alliance to the Day; Divorc'd from Months may it dissolve away. Lo in this sad, this solitary Night, No Voice be heard, can yield the least Delight. All Things be hush'd; no chearful Voice draw nigh, No Noise be heard unless to terrify. Let discontented Souls, who spurn at Life, Opprest with Pain, who court the murd'ring Knife, Who long for Death, and pine to be away, O let them curse it, when they curse the Day. Let th'Ev'ning Stars, which usher in the Night, Be doom'd to Darkness, empti'd of their Light, Whilst groping Mortals look for Stars t'arise; These Lanthorns be shut up, and Darkness load the Skys. May Darkness still encrease, without the least alloy: O may it never kindle up to Day. This Night allow'd my Life for to begin; Nor bolted Natures Doors to keep me in, No Pitty shew'd unto my new born Crys; Nor Sorrow hid from my poor feeble Eyes. Ah me! Why did I to this World come? Why dy'd I not within the teeming Womb? When smoaking from the Belly I suck'd Breath, O had it prov'd the Agonies of Death. Newly resign'd from my glad Mother's Womb Had I giv'n up the Ghost, and t'ane the Tomb. Why did the Knees with vigour bear me up, Or swelling Breasts afford my morning Cup? Oh had I fall'n from a trembling Knee; Or barren Breasts had starv'd unhappy me: Then should eternal Slumbers nail'd my Head, In soft repose I'd ly'n amongst the Dead; Where anxious Cares do not invade the Breast; No Malheur there disturbs the peaceful Rest: I'd sleept with royal Dust, the Wise and Great, Earth's Monarchs, and their Ministers of State, Who loath'd in Courts and gaudy Pomp to dwell, Threw down their thorny Crowns t'embrace a Cell. I'd lodg'd with Princes in oblivion's Bed, Whose Riches Fame thro' all the World hath spread With gold and silver Plate their Houses shin'd, Yet stole to Dust, and left the gawgaw Things behind Or like th'unripen'd Embryo of the Womb, Untimely Born, is hidden in the Tomb: Like that raw Mass doom'd to perpetual Night, Whose sealed Eyes disdains to view the Light. 'Tis in the peaceful Grave where none's opprest: The Wicked and the Weary are at rest. 'Tis there th'afflicted Prisoners are free From the stern brawny Keepers Cruelty, In the dark Regions of the silent Grave, Rich Creditor can't make poor Debitor a Slave. Without Distinction blended in the Dust Lies Prince and Peasant, Wicked and the Just: The Servant's free from Toil and Drudgery now; Nor early wakes to streck the labouring Plow. Tell me, ye arbitrary Pow'rs of Heav'n, Why your officious Light to pensive Souls is giv'n. A dark perpetual Night doth best agree With Souls plung'd deep in Gulfs of Misery. Why am I plagu'd with Life, opprest with Woes? Th'imbitter'd Souls desire the Grave's repose, Who long to ly in Chambers of the Dead, Amongst their Sister Worms to lay their Head. But stubborn Death is deaf to all their Cries, Holds up his iron Hands, and from them flies. Still they renew their humble Pray'r again, They beg their Warrand to depart in vain. With the same Pains their Exit they implore, As Misers dig the Earth for golden Ore. With Joy meet Death, and call the Sentence just, Sob out their Souls, and turn to native Dust. In vain the radiant Sun dispenses Rays To him who walks in Darkness all his Days. In devious Wilds I'm caught by fatal Gin, And can't escape for God doth hedge me in: Deep Sighs do throb my Breast before I eat, And brinny Tears distill to sauce my Meat: With mournful Cries my Mis'ry I deplore, Loud as the stormy Sea when angry Billows roar: The Evils, which I most abhor'd to see, With rapid Force comes rolling upon me, The Object of my Hate, my Soul's Bugbear, Is come and fills my Soul with panick Fear. Expos'd to Dangers, and with Cares opprest, My discontented Soul can find no rest. My Troubles still succeeded are by worse, Which flow upon upon me with impetuous Force. Thus did I waste the louring Night away: My mind more gloomy than th'Horizon is, When Nights black Wings prevail and brood upon it. But when I saw the chearful rosie Morn, Give Intimations of returning Day, I from my Pillow rose, ere Heav'ns bright Lamp Dispens'd his glad'ning Beams on tops of Hills: Or Quiristers o'th' Air awak'd with Notes To tune the vocal Forrest with their Musick; From the Town's Smoak and Clamour I retir'd, To breath the Country's fresher Air with Pleasure. My heavy Load of Sorrow I forgot, When I survey'd the various Scenes of Nature, The Pow'r and Wisdom of th'eternal Being, Bless'd Origine of Life, and endless Glory, Who claims the highest Acts of Adoration, Deep Love runs thro' the whole harmonious Scheme. I walk'd to that once happy royal Palace, Which now laments the absence of her Monarch: Whose Bosom still remains a bless'd Retreat To those, who do not share in prosp'rous Fortune. I view'd her Gall'ry lin'd with royal Faces, The empty Image of her former Grandeur. To have the fuller Prospect, I ascended The lofty Summit of the neighbouring Mountain: Which with rough Visage hangs its aged Head; As if it mourn'd for fair Edina's Ruin. 'Twas in that Season of the Year, when Nature, Fully recover'd from her Winter Sickness, In rich embroidered fragrant Garments cloth'd, Displays her Bosom garnished with Riches. The Flow'rs returning from the Mother's Womb, Suck in the balmy Breath o'th' Air; and smile Regal'd and moisten'd with soft April Showers. Phœbus with genial Warmth inspires the Earth, His Heat dissolves the frozen Cheeks of Nature. Heav'n shook her Fleeces on the rip'ning Plants, Which glister'd with the Pearls were sown upon them. From Nature's Cellars, hid from human Ken, Fresh Springs gush down, to chear the Vales below; And flow'ry Meads laugh with their Purple Cheeks. The Seat of Ceres is the Fields around; Where she is brooding with her joyful Wings; Hatching a halcyon Harvest. ? 'Twas the first Morning of the blooming May, The Ladies Anniversary to Nature, When the fair Sex rise earlier than the Sun, To view their lovely Image in the Brook, (For Beauties all the Portion Heav'n gives them.) And wash their Faces with the falling Dew, Gaze on the Fields more richly dress'd than they, With Garlands Crown the Lady of the May. “For this sweet Month the Groves green Liv'rys wear, “If not the first, the fairest of the Year, “For her the Graces lead the dancing Hours; “And Nature's ready Pencil paints the Flowers. On Arthur's awfull Top my Head reclin'd, A lovely Landskip open'd to my Eyes. The bearded Goats climbing the steepy Cliffs, And traversing the Rocks for wholesome Herbage. A Symphony of Voices charm'd my Ears, The mournful Clamour of the scoulling Ass, The merry Lark whistling her nat'ral Notes, The bleetings of the Lambs, and hoarser Maes of Ews, that brouzed on the Mountain Sides, The Lowings of the Herds in humble Valley: Echo in mimick Notes return'd the Song. My Ears being cloy'd with the artless Musick; My Eyes were ravish'd with a beauteous Scene. The Seas smooth Face, calm as the cradled Infant, When lull'd asleep with Nurses dreery Songs. Ships in Leith's happy Bosom spread their Sails; Which sported with the Winds in gaudie Pomp. Morning Tide had early rouz'd the Sailers: With labour'd Stroaks they reach'd the Southern Shoar. Variety of Plants, in this rude Garden, Perfum'd my Nostrils with their vernal Sweetness. Here I with Pleasure herbaliz'd alone, Praising th'eternal Fountain of the Bounty. The rising Sun shone with unshaded Beauty, No Fogs and Mists did intercept his Splendour. The setting Stars withdrew their feebler Light, When the great Charioteer did mount his Coach. A lofty Subject for a Milton's Muse; The divine Bard, who sung in Angel's Notes, “These are thy glorious Works Parent of Good “Almighty thine this universal Frame, “Thus wond'rous Fair, thy self how wondrous then. My Theme was lofty, but untun'd my Heart: In lower Notes I sung, for Heav'n is pleas'd With Gratitude, a Tribute due to Heav'n. To thee, great God, incline my ravish'd Soul, As doth the Needle to th'attractive Pole. Brighten Beams of Faith, encrease the flame of Love. The Mercies Men enjoy, O gracious God, Is only from the Tenor of thy Bounty. Who can behold thy mighty Works, O God, Or think upon thy Goodness without Rapture. Great Architect of this bright shining Glob, I'll join with heav'nly Choirs in rapt'rous Praise, To Celebrate the Depths of divine Wisdom. Ye nether World sing Hymns to the great Numen, Ev'n from the Artick to th'Antartick Pole Lo yon blew Canopy, adorn'd with Stars, Lanthorns hung out t'illuminate this World, Displays the Pow'r and Wisdom of its Maker; Who laid Earth's Basis in the fluid Air; An Element too weak to bear a Straw. I admire the vast Suspension of the Glob, The Flux and Reflux of the raging Sea, Bounded and circumscrib'd with special Laws. He shuteth up the Sea with Doors of Sand; With these the Seas proud Waves is buttress'd up, They kiss the Shoar but can't o'erflow the Land. Her Billows tremble at th'Almighty's Nod: Did not the raging Sea obey her God, And split her Waves, when touch'd with Aarons Rod. Firm as a Rock the liquid Waves do stand, Till th'Israelites with Safety reach the Land. Then Seas do Storm, the angry Billows rise, And with impetuous Force o'erwhelm th'Enemies. Her wrathful Jaws receive them to their Tomb, 'Mongst secret Horrors of her wat'ry Womb. These, who in Ships on Hills of Billows ride, To deck Britannia's Belles with Persian Pride, Fly to both Indies for their Gold and Spices, Mount to the Skies, and dance upon the Waves, Do see the Wonders of the Lord i'th' Deep: To which all Currents daily do resort, To be in their great Parents Arms embrac'd; Who swallows thousand Rivers in her Mouth: Yet like the thirsty Drunkard gaspes for Drought. Her swaging Womb comes begging to the Shoar, While she receives her Alms, she begs for more. Millions of Mouths within her Bosom ly; Were she not well supply'd they'd drink her dry. To Eolus she gives ten thousand Tun, Millions of Hogsheads to the Moon and Sun. Descartes, great Philosopher did own, He knew not how the Pression of the Moon Did cause the Sea to make so swift a Motion, One thousand eighty Foot unto a second. Who can by searching fathom the Almighty, And trace the Maze and Labyrinth of his Works. Such Knowledge is too wonderful for Man; 'Tis higher than the Battlements of Heav'n. Deeper than the infernal Shades below, Longer than Earth, and broader than the Sea. God's Spirit garnished the Azure Vault: He form'd the crooked Serpent and Arcturus, Orion, Pleiades, and the Southern Gall'ries. The Sun approaches on his dazling Carr, More glorious than a Bridegroom doth he shine, Or Solomon in his imperial Purples, Warms the cold Glebe, and ripens her Productions; Never is restive to th'Almighty's Laws, But drives with speedy Course from Pole to Pole To visit ev'n ungrateful Wretches, who Did never thank their Maker for the Blessing. When the Omnipotent commands, the Sun Doth not arise, or stops i'th' radiant Passage. Stars in their nightly Dance with twinkling Eye, Guide Travellers, ev'n the reeling Drunkards home. God with strong Arm doth loose the Bonds of Orion And bindeth the sweet Influence of Pleiades. 'Tis he that ruleth Phospher in his Sphere, And guides Arcturus with his wand'ring Sons. He ballanceth the Clouds with divine Art, And spreadeth out the Sky, that molten Looking-Glass. I admire th'elastick Quality of the Air, Which God doth purge with Lightnings and with Thunder. What Naturalist can tell, how Exhalations, And Vapors from the Earth, warm'd by the Sun, Should thunder in the Firmament of Heav'n; With such impetuous Force ev'n burst the Clouds, And shake the pond'rous Earth with violent Motion: Level the Princes Palace with the Ground, And melt the Sword of Iron in the Scabbard. With sulph'rous Particles a little Air From th'Earth, when rarified by solar Heat, Doth loudly blow, and rive the sturdy Oaks Tear up their Roots and leave their Tendrils naked; With Force swells up the Ocean to the Skies; Threatens to shake the Earth from of its Axis; Draws back its Breath for fresh Recruits of Strength, And then returneth with the greater Fury; Within a Moment dies unto a Calm: Like fondled Child, when ang'ry Humor's spent, Smiles in the Face and plays with Lovers softness. Earth's Perspiration by a solar Heat Condenses unto Rain, which falls on Flow'rs, And wholsome Herbage for the use of Man. He with prolifick Humours warms the Earth, And fructifies her Womb with gentle Show'rs. Let Men with Shouts proclaim his Pow'r and Glory, Till Heav'ns wide Hall ring with the pious Noise: Rare Workmanship of the eternal Artist. Is this bright Glob, in which we Mortals dwell: His Works all Wonders are, his Ways unknown. He spoke the World from nothing unto Being: It leapt to Life and Shape at his great Fiat. He wrought the formless Mass, the embryo World, To Beauty, which enamour'd its Creator. The Earth attir'd in all its gawdy Drapry, Hath all its Beauty from the Lord of Life, The Sea of all our Drops, the Sun of all our Beams. O could I wade thro' all the various Creatures; Till plung'd and swallow'd in the living God. Instructed by the independent Being, On whom all other Beings do depend, The Bees do traffick in their Commonwealth: Full of heroick Valour they come forth, With their illustrious Sov'reign at their Head; Whom with unspoted Loyalty th'obey. Th'Ants are not strong, yet they prepare their Meat, Winter's Provision in the Summer's Heat. He teaches Nightingales their Songs of Love, And all the feather'd Quires to build their Houses, With well tun'd Notes they flicker from the Nest, Sing all the Day till Nature call for Rest: Early awake, thro' airy Regions fly To chirl the Praises of a Deity. The Ass he Pastures in the Forrests Wild; The barren Heaths and Desarts is its Dwelling: 'Tis dignify'd beyond the brute Creation. The Christians Arms is blazon'd on its Back, Which foolish Greeks and blinded Jews condemn, The Christian values't 'bove a Diadem: I'll mock the Pomp and Pagentry of Courts, The World's fallacious, silly, glistering Honours, Vain Sepulchers are rear'd, t'adorn the Dust The Heralds Art's a dull routtine of Words, Than this no other 'scutcheon will I have. In a Field Or, a bleeding dying Jesus Upon the Cross expanded Proper Sable; The Dexter grasps a Reed, i'th' Sinister, A bitter Cup of Vinegar and Gall. For gentile Nations quarterly o'er all I'th' First and Fourth; the gentile Elect Or; Crown'd, arm'd, languid, Gules; for Jews. I'th' second and the third a Breast-Plate, bearing The twelve Tribes Bend-ways Argent and Azure; The polar Part inscribed Ecce Homo, Mantled with Love befitting his Degree. For Crest a Crown; not Gold, but plaited Thorns; Which terminateth in a Mond, Or; Th'Arms supported by two wretched Thieves Whose drooping Heads lys on their pensive Bosom; And Jesus's Motto in an escrol Writ, Jesus Nazareus Rex Judeorum. O Soul refreshing and mysterious Theme, The Love of Jesus dying on a Cross. 'Twas Love that nail'd him to the cruel Stake, Or else his En'mies Power had prov'd too weak. In th'Arms of Love he on Mount Calv'ry dies; His Death was our attoning sacrifice: O Jesus, lovely when thou'rt dy'd in Blood, These Streams gush out the precious crimson Flood, For Man's Salvation and eternal Good. Blood thirsty Rebells, have you slain your Lord, Who by all Saints and Angels is ador'd. And is your Malice spent, your Anger ceas'd, Know he thro' all Eternity is bless'd. His breathless Body's laid into a Cave; O strange! must he be buried in the Grave: God in a Bed of stinking Bones, strange thing! Must he ly dead, who must for ever reign. No, he must rise, Redemption to compleat: He mounts to Heaven, resumes his native Seat, There sits enthron'd in Majesty and State. Lord, burry all my Sins in Jesus's Grave, And quench the fev'rish Ferment of my Lusts, In the dear Fountain of my Saviour's Blood. Thro' the gross Darkness of polluted Nature, I'll look on Mercies Face with Joy and Triumph, And praise him for his Works of Grace and Nature, Each Flow'r, and Herb, and Pile of Grass doth teach In silent Language, God should be ador'd. How various is the Objects of my Thoughts, The vegitive and animal Creation, Their different Species, and their Propagation. The Structure and the make of human Bodies, The various Fluids and their Destribution, Th'impulsive Energy of subtile Spirits, Which cherisheth this tender Lamp of Life, Th'Immensity of Man's capacious Parts, The vast, the boundless Extent of the Thoughts Which forms Ideas of the Things unseen. My God I'll praise thee while I have a Being; Thy Pow'r and Goodness still shall be my Song, I'll sing with Saints on Earth, and with th'angelick Throng. Thus far my Morning Meditations went, When I beheld a melancholy Sight: Two angry Rivals in the listed Ground, Who taking Cupid for the warriors God, Came to decide their Claims to fair Orinda. Ill guided Youths, to shew their burning Love, Open their Breasts with the cold Point of Iron: With Lion's Looks, and a saluting Kiss, They brandished the Implements of Death. Equal in Arms, long did they push their Fate The more they bled, the higher rose their Fury: As if their Wounds suck'd in recruits of Courage. O foolish Man, where is thy boasted Wisdom; To trample on divine and humane Laws, And damn thy self for that poor Toy a Woman; The first and worst Seducer of the Man; Light as the Patch, and painted as the Fan, To Day stiff as the Hoop, and then she'll prove, The very next, as pliant as the Glove. Let us make Man, says God, and pull him down And wretched Man obeys the impious Orders, And rushes to his own eternal Ruin. Seeing a Lady, so her Garb bespoke her, Run swiftly thro' Saint Anne's flow'ry Park, Which in its Pride was ready for the Mower; I soon concluded 'twas the charming she Had wounded these, were wounding one another, Who came to save them from a fatal Exit. But oh! this was a Day of sad Disasters. The narrow Wicket, which delivers in To the Dukes Walk, would not admit her Hoop, Which bigger was than monstrous Gorgon's Head. She stood intangl'd, gazing thro' the spokes. Like youthful Nun, when peeping thro' a Cloyster, Mangling her Limbs, to break the stubborn Steel, Which held her as in Adamantine Fetters. With strange Disorder they beheld the Lady, Bow'd at her Feet, and yielded up their Weapons: Then led her off, but where they went I know not The Edge being blunted of my fine Devotion, With this unhappy melancholy Sight, I left the Park with Dryden's wise Reflection; “Love is the pleasant Frenzy of the Mind, “And frantick Men, in their mad Actions show, “A Happiness, which none but mad Men know. THE AMOURS OF Polyndus and Ardella. So àmorous, and fond and billing, Like Philip and Mary on a Shilling. Hudib. A hero, who in War gain'd ample Glory, Becomes the Subject of my amorous Story. Polyndus prov'd his Courage in the War, Brought Honour to his Country from afar: Whilst yet a stripling Boy, scarce Musquet hight, He lov'd the Din of War, and went to Fight With little Will, whom Britain did obey: Great Souls are always lodg'd in little Clay. And gather'd Laurels on the Belgian Plain, Wading 'mongst Blood, and climbing o'er the Slain. His infant Arms the Sword could scarcely wild; When he appear'd like Eugine in the Field: There he immortal Reputation got, And that bright Character, The valiant Scot. But when the Gallick Monarch beg'd a Peace, And Clement William said, now War shall cease; Polyndus to his native Country came, Which lov'd him for his Merit and his Fame. He all the Arts of Conversation had; O how he spoke and how he did perswade: The fair were tickl'd with his Eloquence, And all the Pleasures which could flatter Sense: Old Matrons chuckl'd when they saw the Boy, And florid Maids felt an excess of Joy. His Charms can scarce be imitate or told, In short the Squire had every thing save Gold. But it's the spreading Error of the Clime, That want of Money is the greatest Crime. Moe than the Mob think he that's void of Pence, Is void of Learning, Honesty and Sense. Hence gallant Men and Merit's cloth'd in Rags, Whilst Knaves and Fools are brooding o'er their Bags. Beauteous Ardella vanquished the Squire, And he is scorch'd with Flames of Paphian Fire: Her lovely Face Polyndus's Bosom warms, Death's in her Beauty, Ruin in her Charms: She prov'd the Robber of his Heart's repose, The Spring of Mischief, and the Source of Woes. Ardella was a very lovely Creature, The very Pride and Master-Peice of Nature: Nature had stampt a Beauty on her Face, She spoke and danc'd, and walk'd with a Bon-grace. The Nymph had Charms could ruin all Mankind; Men gaz'd upon her till their Eyes were blind: By her Polyndus lost his martial Mind, He's wounded by the little Boy that's blind. Like Rivers, which the Storms of Winter freeze, The Soldiers doth strong Burthens bear with Ease, Make bold Resistance to the two edg'd Steel; But both do melt, when kindly Heat they feel: Doth not th'Ice resist the Hatchets blows, But with Meridian Sun it feeble grows. The Man, who fights for Laurels in the Field, Will dy in Blood and Wounds before he yield, When Beauty shines, how feeble doth he prove, He melts before its Rays, dissolves in Love. The Man of Valour's most inclin'd to Love, He's forc'd by Nature, as the Schoolmen prove: Th'Original of both is heat of Blood, This animates the Wariour and the Prude: The Motions of their Souls are just the same, They're thirsting after Praise and endless Fame: By different Ways they strive to overcome, She by her Face and Flut, he by the Sword and Drum. Altho' Polyndus's Breast was fortify'd With all that Sense, and Reason could provide; The Hero's Soul replenish'd is with Grace, Yet falls a Victim to a Female Face. He labour'd to be free of Love's Desease; But Poison's stronger than its Remedies. He strove to have this Passion subdued, But Evil still more active is than Good. The Means apply'd do often not prevail, But Poison kills us with its very smell. Painters observe, tho' Black's excell'd by White, The last hath ne'er Affinity with Light: When mix'd together with the Painter's Skill, White is so feeble, Black doth still prevail. When rival Monarchs struggle for a Crown, The Prince that's strongest may be overthrown: If half his Forces come not to the Field, The weaker Prince will force him for to yield. It's otherwise in Love, a single Face Will conquer much Philosophy and Grace. Polyndus left no Method unessay'd To make a Conquest of the charming Maid: He spent a Winter and a Spring in vain, Ardella treat him with a cold Disdain. Women and Glory always turn their Back, When their fond Lovers give too close attack. The low Submission and the humble Prayer Prevails with Heaven, but seldom with the Fair. When the wise Lover keeps the golden Meen, Neither appears too negligent not keen, The Lady labours to encrease th'Esteem, With Arts of Love she blows the kindling Coal, But when she knows she's Mistress of the Soul, She laughs to think she's choos'd the easy Fool. Philosophers, acquaint with Nature's Laws, Look thro' Effects, and dive unto the Cause, Tell us that Things do naturally expire By that, which first did give them vital Fire: If too abundant and excesive grown, Thus by their Parents are they overthrown. A heap of Wood thrown rashly on the Fire, Will make it blaze so high, 'twill soon expire. Thus Love by an extravagant Caress Grows ev'ry Day and Hour and Minute less. Five Months and more Polyndus had essay'd To win the Heart of this fair cruel Maid; But got a final Answer from her Mouth, Pray trouble me no more, she says, fond Youth: That you are well accomplish'd I must grant, You are a proper, but a poor Gallant: I know you love me to a mighty Pitch, But I resolve to marry one that's Rich. It's only Money makes a pleasant Life: It's Gold, and not fine Shapes, must please a Wife. Great Solomon, that wise and learned Prince, Says Wisdom's good with an Inheritance. Begone Polyndus and no more return, Or be the Object of my Hate and Scorn. As th'ancient Painter, Sorrow to express, Did draw a Vail o'er Agamemnon's Face; So I shall not Polyndus's Grief relate, The Reader may believe 'twas very great. I'll o'er his Grief a Vail of Silence draw, Since I can't paint it with a coup d' eclate. He came to me, a Lump of walking Woe, And told me he had got the killing Blow. Take Courage, I reply'd, and don't give o'er, You have not got her in the Coachman's Hour. The Course of your Amours, if right, should look Much like the Progress of a rapid Brook. Within its Banks it swiftly runs and clear; But if it meet with stop in its Career, It gathers all its formidable Strength, And swells so high it vanquisheth at length. There is a certain Time, at least it's said, Most proper for a Man t'address a Maid; For then her Virtue nods, and she's betray'd. But when that Season is, I'm not so sure, Some call it Venus, some the Coachman's Hour. I've heard a Sage and learn'd Physician say, He could not condescend on th'Hour or Day: But August was the fitest Month to Woo, And us'd this Argument to prove it true. “In August, when the Sun darts oblique Rays, “Lengthens the Nights, contracts the sultry Days, “The Dog Star's Pow'r becomes immensely great; “He fires the Females with malignant Heat: “The Earth's excesive dry, the Air is bad, “And Virgins then, as well as Dogs, run mad. “If Maids, in Month of August, go astray, “Skilful Astronomers and Partridge say, “That Star is only in the wrong, not they. “Their Flesh and Blood is in a civil War, “Thro' the impulse of that curs'd unlucky Star. Polyndus wisely follow'd my Advice, And found Ardella far from being Nice. August's a happy Month for Men to Woe, I'm sure my Friend Polyndus found it true. He catch'd her sleeping in her Summer Bow'r, He catch'd her in the very Coachman's Hour, He lay beside her in the verdant Grove, And in melodious Notes express'd his Love: SONG. Ye airy Spirits hither throng, Cause Ardella hear my Song: Of Polyndus cause her dream; O inspire her with the Theme. Quires of Angels bless the Grove, Fill Ardellas Breast with Love O ye Pow'rs, that pity Love, With soft Fires her Bosom move. Heavenly Pow'rs, that know my Grief, Interpose for my Relief. Let my solitary Groan Pierce Heaven's Vault, and reach its Throne. Must Polyndus always mourn, Love without the least return. Now she's rock'd into a Calm, All her Pores do smell like Balm, Cheeks and Bosom glow with Charms. I'll embrace her in my Arms, Clasp and hold her there for ever: All my Blood is in a Fever. Shall I steal her from the Bower, Fortune's put it in my Pow'r: She'll be angry if I do, Love no Rudeness doth allow. If she awake a cruel Lass, I'll a dreadful Sentence pass, In her presence make a Vow, (Soldiers to their Words are true) If she Mercy won't afford, She shall see my naked Sword Wound my Breast and drink my Blood; She shall see the purple Flood. I'll Bless her with departing Breath, Bless her in the Arms of Death: I'll look on her in the last Tug of Nature, Print gelid Kisses on the killing Creature. But, if she bid me live, I will obey; If not, I'll shut my Eyes, dissolve away. Perhaps she'll smile me back to life again, One sugar Word from her will cure my Pain. My Sword had always Charms till now; Perhaps her haughty Sp'rit will bow, When she sees it she may change, And prevent the dire Revenge. He stole a silent Kiss, and she awoke: When she beheld Polyndus, thus she spoke. “Polyndus I was sleeping when you came, “Nay, I must tell you, I was in a Dream. To her Polyndus, “O my charming Maid, “To whom with Zeal my daily Vows are paid, “My Love to you hath been excessive great; “I've lov'd in vain, such is my wretched Fate. “No more shall I be with Love's Pains opprest; “I'll stab your Image in my throbing Breast. “This Sword shall kill your Lover; when I'm lost, “Ardella, you'll be haunted with my Ghost. “Hold, hold, Ardella crys, what do you mean; “Patience Polyndus, i'll relate my Dream. “I thought with that same Sword, you touch'd your Breast, “I had not Strength enough to bear the rest: “I cry'd, my dear Polyndus, save your Life, “And take Ardella for your future Wife. “Awake, I do the Resolution keep; “I ratify what I have done in sleep. Polyndus gave her many a melting Kiss: He's all in Rapture and extatick Bless, The Wedding Rites perform'd, Joy did succeed; This August was a honey Month indeed. Ardella prov'd a fond and loving Wife; She call'd him still her Love, her Soul, her Life. Like new created Popes they change their Name: (He's lost all Reason, she hath lost all Shame.) His is Heart Pipes; her's little Duty, Spouse: Such is the kindly Epithets they use. Sometimes they're almost choak'd with am'rous Blesses, She rushes on him with a Storm of Kisses, Ogling hangs round his Neck, he leering spys Two little smiling Babies in her Eyes. Where e'er he goes, there goes his loving Bride; Duty is always packing by his Side. Once they went forth upon a Morning clear, To walk upon Clide-Side, and take the Air. Fond Fools, they mind, ev'n in the glaring Light, The Action only proper to the Night. Tho' lawful Love may very well b' exprest, Yet least lascivious Ardours fire your Breast, Reader, I shall in Silence pass the rest. Near to the River, on the Brink they ly, Not dreaming in the least that Trouble's nigh. But often we imagine all Things well, When Death and Danger tread upon our Heel. In Winter Storms this rapid River Clyde, Did undermind this Brae with raging Tide; Loos'd from its Roots, and hollow all below, Unable to support the Weight of two, It sunk beneath the Hero and the Fair; Surpriz'd, and almost drown'd, the loving Pair. Ardella's Fear prevailing over Shame; She held by what, I'm very loath to name: Sure none can call her an immodest Wife: We'll grasp at any Thing to save our Life. The Pow'rs propitious to the nuptial Bed Dispatch'd aerial Spirits to their Aid. When Dangers over, they upo' the Bank; Ardella, not till then, did quite her Plank “Polyndus says, Ardella, O my Jewel, “When in such Danger, why was you so cruel? Ardella blushing, gave a soft Reply, “Polyndus, I believ'd we both would dy: “Instinct doth teach us to prolong our Days, “'Tis Nature's Law, and every one obeys. “I us'd the Means, for you and I both know, “That Thing would never to the Bottom go. THE Mourning Muse, Occasioned by the Death of that excellent Gentleman James Deans of Woodhuslee, Esq; Who died at his Country Seat 7th May 1720. To the virtuous Lady his Widow. Madam, Accept your Cousins mournful Tale, Written when gloomy Sadness did prevail. Pardon the Errors of the low Propine, Since Grief and Sorrow dictate ev'ry Line. Gracious Relict of the Man I lov'd, Altho' your bosom Blessing be remov'd, Yet do not sink with an excess of Grief, The Covenant of Grace brings fresh Relief. Ere long you'll see him in Immanuels Land And get the Palm of Vict'ry in your Hand. He'll bid you welcome to the Courts above; There you'll like Angels sing, like Angels love. That God, whom you do love so well below, Will Heav'ns bright Crown and Robes on you bestow. Sweet Soul, remember Heav'n's been very kind: Fair is the Offspring he has left behind. In these rejoyce, they do his Image bear: God mixes Mercy with the mourning Tear. O may some Angel, from Realms of Light, Descend his shining Epitaph to write. No mortal Wit his Character can give; Our Verse can only on his Marble live. Taitte. All Flesh is Grass, they wither as the Flower: The cruel Grave doth every Man devour. He's gone, whom all Men lov'd: Alas he's fled To the dark lonely Regions of the Dead. So precious was his Life, it could not last: Fine was the Threed, but 'twas a slender Twist. O Death, why do you press for Volunteers? There's many an aged Man with hoary Hairs, Leaning o'er Props, and noding o'er the Grave, Bowing the Back, as if they'd entrance crave: And yet, O Grave, thou shuts thy ugly Mouth, But gapes, and swallows up the lovely Youth. O Death, great is thy Tyranny and Lust, To pull the blooming Hero to the Dust. Ah! must the Good, the Gallant, and the Brave Kiss thy wan Cheeks, and moulder in the Grave. Must thy cold Arms the blooming Youth embrace, And will you blow the Roses from his Face. He, like the Rose, did wear a lovely Bloom, But soon was cropt, he wither'd ere 'twas Noon. The fairest Flowers the soonest do decay; The Rose in July dies, that's born in May. A precious Plant doth seldom more than sprout, But noxious Weeds can scarce be rooted out. Ravens and Birds of Prey live very long: The Lark and Nightingale die wondrous soon. Generous Spirits, like the purest Fire, Shine with a lambent Flame, but soon expire. Down to the thoughtless Grave the Charmer goes, 'Mongst Sculls and Worms to take a long Repose: Whose sweet facetious Tales still charm'd our Ears. Then we were swell'd with Joy, as now with Tears. O Grave, with Grief and Sorrow I'd despair, Did I not know that he was Adam's Heir: Nay, That the blessed Jesus once lay there. And that his Spirit drinks immortal Air, Mingles with Heav'ns loud Quires and warbles there. The hymning Guards, which scout on Heav'ns Frontier, Salute his Soul; they're glad to see it there. Ye precious Souls, who at the Altar stand, And with your Incense save a sinful Land, Approach with Rev'rence to his burial Place; Declare it Holy by your Rites of Grace; Plant Bays and Laurels on the mournful Cell; Upon his Grave perpetual Greenness dwell. Pilgrims must know it is not common Dust; O! he was Wise, and Good, and Kind and Just. O may it be with Roses overgrown, Still in their Pride and never fully blown. Angels descend and guard the awful Dust Till he appear in Judgment with the Just. From me he shall a grateful Tribute have, I'll kneel and pay my Homage to his Grave. O Philomel, like me with Grief opprest, Come hither to his Tomb, and build your Nest. Upon his peaceful Grave distend your Throat, With a poetick and a mournful Note. Come here, ye mournful Quires of every Wing, My sweet tongu'd Birds, I'll teach you what to sing. Fly from the Oozie Pool each sick'ning Swan, And with your dying Song lament the Man. But chearful Lark, I charge you not to come: Go to the Window of his Lady's Room, And sing your native Notes and Anthems there. For when she sees you fly aloof i'th' Air, She'll mind he sings above, and so will she; This will allay her Grief for Woodhuslee. Eheu quam tenui pendunt mortalia filo.
