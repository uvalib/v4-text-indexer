Lord in thy rage rebuke me not Lord in thy rage rebuke me not, for my most greeuous sinne, nor in thine anger chasten me, but let me fauour winne, haue mercy Lord on me, because my state is weake to see, heale me O Lord, for that my bones, are troubled sore in me. [II. Right blest are they whose wicked sinnes] Beati quorum. Psal. 32. Right blest are they whose wicked sinnes Right blest are they whose wicked sinnes, by God remitted be, and whose defaults are couered, through his great clemency, The man is blest, to whom our Lord hath not imputed sinne, nor in his sprit, deceyte is found, nor takes delight there in.

Lord in thy wrath correct me not, nor in thy furie vexe Lord in thy wrath correct me not, nor in thy furie vexe, giue teares, giue grace, giue penitence, vnto my sinfull sexe, for that the arrowes of thy wrath, are fixed in my hart, and thou hast layd thine hand on me, for my most iust deseart.

Svsanna fayre sometime assaulted was] Svsanna fayre sometime assaulted was Svsanna fayre sometime assaulted was, by two old men desiring their delight, which leude intent they thought to bring to passe, if not by tender loue, by force and might, to whom she said, if I your sure denye, you will me falsely accuse and make me dye, And if I graunt to that which you request, my chastity, shall then deflowred be, which is so deere to me, that I detest, my lyfe, if it berefted be from me, and rather would I dye, of mine accord, ten thousand tymes, then once offend our Lord. [IX. The Nightingale so pleasant &amp; so gay] The Nightingale so pleasant &amp; so gay The Nightingale so pleasant &amp; so gay, in greenewood groues, delights to make his dwelling, in fields to flye, chanting his roundelaye, at lyberty, against the Cage rebelling.

When younglyngs first on Cupide fyxe their sight] When younglyngs first on Cupide fyxe their sight When younglyngs first on Cupide fyxe their sight, and see him naked, blyndfold &amp; a boy, though bow &amp; shafts and fierbrand be his might, yet weene they he can worke them none annoy, And therefore with his purpill wings they play, for glorious semeth loue though light as fether, and when they haue done they weene to skape away, for blynd men say they, shoote they know not whether. [XI. The second part. Bvt when by proofe they finde that he did see] Bvt when by proofe they finde that he did see Bvt when by proofe they finde that he did see, &amp; that his wound did rather dym their sight, they wonder more how such a lad as he, should be of such surpassing powre &amp; myght: but Ants haue gals, so hath the Bee his styng, then sheeld me heauens from such a subtyle thing.

The second part. Then for a bote his quiuer stoode in stead] Then for a bote his quiuer stoode in stead Then for a bote his quiuer stoode in stead, his bow vnbent did serue him for a mast, whereby to sayle his cloth of vayle he spread, his shafts for ores on either bord he cast, from shypwracke safe this wag got thus to shore, and sware, to bath in louers teares no more.

[XVI. The second part. Boy pittye me y? am a child againe] Boy pittye me y? am a child againe Boy pittye me y? am a child againe, blynde be no more, my guide to make me stray, to make me stray, man vse thy might to force away my paine, God do me good, and leade me to my way, And if thou beest a powre to me vnknowne, powre of my life, let heere thy grace be showne, let let heere thy grace be showne. And if &amp;c. [XVII. The first part.

XXIII. [Whyle that the Sunne with his beames hot] [1] Whyle that the Sunne with his beames hot, Scorched the fruits in vale &amp; mountaine: Philon the sheperd late forgot, Sitting besides a Christall fountaine, In shadow of a greene Oke tree, Vppon his pipe this song playd he: Vntrue loue, vntrue loue, adew loue, Your minde is light, Soone lost for new loue. 2 So long as I was in your sight, I was as your hart, your soule, your treasure, And euermore you sob'd, you sigh'd, Burning in flames beyond all measure, Three dayes endur'd your Loue to me, And it was lost in other three. Adew Loue adew loue vntrue loue, Vntrue loue vntrue loue adew loue, Your mynd is light, soone lost for new loue 3 Another shepherd you dyd see, To whome your hart was soone enchayned, Full soone your loue was leapt from me, Full soone my place he had obtayned, Soone came a third your loue to winne, And we were out and he was in. Adew loue, &amp;c. 4 Sure you haue made me passing glad, That you your mynd so soone remoued, Before that I the leysure had, To chuse you for my best beloued. For all my loue was past and doonne, Two dayes before it was begoonne. Adew Loue &amp;c. [XXIIII.

Alas quoth I, alas quoth I, what meaneth this demeanure, so faire a dame to be so full of sorowe: No wonder quoth a Nimphe, she wanteth pleasure, her teares and sighes, ne ceasse from eaue to morow: This lady, Rich is of the gifts of beauty, but vnto her, are gifts of fortune daynty. are gifts of fortune daynty. This lady &amp;c. [XXVII.

[XXVIII. Compell the Hawke to sitt that is vnmand] Compell the Hawke to sitt that is vnmand Compell the Hawke to sitt that is vnmand, or make the Hound vntaught, to draw the Deere, or bring the free, or bring the free against his will in band, or moue the sad a pleasant tale to heare your time is lost, and you are neare the neere, and you are neare the neere: So loue ne learnes by force the knot to knit, the knot to knit, he serues but those that seele sweete fancyes sit, he serues but those that feele sweete fancies sit, So loue ne learnes by force the knot to knit to knit, to knit, the knot to knit, he serues but those that feele sweete fancyes fitt, sweete fancies fitt. [XXIX. See, see, those sweet eyes] See, see, those sweet eyes, those more then sweetest eyes See, see, those sweet eyes, those more then sweetest eyes, eyes whom the starres exceede not in their grace: See, see Loue at gaze, Loue that faine would deuise, but cannot speake to plead his wonderous case. The second part of this song, (Loue would discharge) is placed the XXXIIII. song. XXX. [When I was otherwise then now I am] When I was otherwise then now I am, I loued more but skilled not so much: Fayre wordes &amp; smyles, could haue contented than, My simple age, &amp; ignorance was such: But at the length, experi?ce made me wonder, That harts &amp; tongues did lodge so farre assunder. As watermen which on the Teames do row Looke to the East, but West keepes on the way, My Soueraigne sweet, her countenance setled so, To feede my hope while she her snares might laye. And when she saw, that I was in her danger, Good God, how soone she proued then a ranger. I could not choose but laugh although to late, To see great craft diszifered in a toye, I loue her still, but such conditions hate, Which so prophanes my Paradice of ioy. Loue whetts the witts, whose paine is but a pleasure, A toy, by fitts, to play withall at leasure. FINIS. [XXXI. When first by force of fatal destenie] When first by force of fatal destenie When first by force of fatal destenie, fr? Carthage towne the Troian knight dyd sayle, Queene Dido fayre, with wofull weeping eye, his strange depart did greuously bewaile, And when no sighes nor teares could ease her smart, with sword ful sharp, she pearst, she pearst her tender hart. [XXXII. I thought that loue had beene a boy] I thought that loue had beene a boy I thought that loue had beene a boy, with blynded eyes, or else some other wanton toy, that men deuise, like tales of fayryes often told, by doting age that dyes for cold, lyke tales of fayryes often told, by doting age that dyes for cold, by doting age that dyes for cold. XXXIII. [O deere life when may it be] O deere life when may it be, That mine eyes thine eyes may see, And in them my minde discouer, Whether absence hath had force, Thy remembrance to deforce, From the Image of thy louer. O, if I my selfe finde not, though my parting ought forgot Nor debard from beauties treasure Let no tongue aspier to tell In what hie Ioyes I shall dwell, Onely thought aymes at the pleasure. Thought therefore I will send thee To take vp the place for me, Long I will not after tary, There vnseene thou maist be bold These faire wonders to behold, Which in them my hopes do cary. Finis. [XXXIIII. Loue, loue would discharge, the dewty of his hart] Loue, loue would discharge, the dewty of his hart Loue, loue would discharge, the dewty of his hart, in beauties praise, whose greatnes doth denye, wordes words to his thoughts, &amp; thoughts to her desart, which high conceyts since nothing can supply, Loue heere constraynd, through conquest to confesse, byds silence sighe, that tongue cannot expresse. XXXV. [From Virgins wombe this day did spring] A Carowle for Christmas day, the quire whereof (Reioyce) being of 4 parts, is the XXIIII. song. From Virgins wombe this day did spring, The precious seed that saued man, This day let man reioyce and sweetly sing Since on this day saluacion first began, This day dyd Christ mans soule from death remoue With glorious Saints to dwell in heauen aboue. This day to man came pledge of perfect peace, This day to man came loue and vnitie, This day mans griefe began for to surcease, This day dyd man receiue a remedie, For each offence and euery deadly sinne, With guiltie hart that earst he wandred in. In Christ his flock let loue be surely plast, From Christ his flock let concord hate expell, Of Christ his flock let loue be so embrast, As we in Christ, and Christ in vs may dwell, Christ is the Author of sweet vnitie, From whence procedeth all felicitie. O sing vnto this glittering glorious king, O praise his name let euery liuing thing, Let hart and voyce like bells of siluer ring, The comfort that this day to man doth bring, Let Lute, let Shalme, with sound of sweet delight, These ioyes of Christ his birth this day resight. FINIS. [XXXVI. The first part. Of gold all burnisht, and brighter then sunne beames] Of gold all burnisht, and brighter then sunne beames Of gold all burnisht, and brighter then sunne beames, were those curled lookes vppon her noble head, from whose deepe conceits, my true deseruings flead, wherfore these mine eyes, such store of teares, such store of teares out streames. Her eyes are faire starrs, her red like damaske rose, her white siluer shyne of Moone, on Christall streame, her beauty perfect, wheron my fancies dreame, her lipps are rubies, her teeth of pearle, her teeth of pearle two rowes. [XXXVII. The second part. Her breath is more sweet then perfect Amber is] Her breath is more sweet then perfect Amber is Her breath is more sweet then perfect Amber is, her yeeres are in prime, and nothing doth she want, that might drawe Angells from Heauen to further blisse, to further blisse, of all things perfect, this do I most complaine, her hart is a rock made all of Adamant, which guifts all delight, delight which guifts all delight, this last doth onely paine, doth onely paine, this last doth onely paine. Heere endeth the songs of 5. parts. Of 6. voc. [XXXVIII. The first part. Behold how good a thing it is] Behold how good a thing it is, it is, it is Behold how good a thing it is, it is, it is, for bretheren to agree, for to agree, when men amongst them do no stryfe, but peace and concord see, and concord see, full lyke vnto the pretious balme, full like vnto, full lyke vnto the pretious balme, from Arons head that fell, that fell, from Arons hed that fell, that fell, and did descend vppon his beard, his garment skirts vntyll, vntyll, his garment skyrts vntyll. [XXXIX. The second part. And as the pleasant morning dew] And as the pleasant morning dew, the pleasant morning dew And as the pleasant morning dew, the pleasant morning dew, the Mountaines doth releeue, doth releeue, the Mountaines doth releeue, so God will blesse, where concord is, where concord is, So God will blesse where concord is, where concord is, and lyfe eternall giue, eternall giue, and lyfe eternall giue, and lyfe eternall giue. XL. [An earthly tree a heauenly fruit it bare] A Carowle for Christmas day, the quire whereof (Cast of all doubtfull care) being of 4 parts, is y? XXV. song. An earthly tree a heauenly fruit it bare, A case of clay containd a crowne immortall, A crowne of crownes, a king whose cost &amp; care Redeemd poore man, whose race before was thrall To death, to dome, to paines of euerlasting, By his sweet death, skornes, strypes, &amp; often fasting. A Starre aboue the starres, a Sonne of light, Whose blessed beames this wretched earth bespred With hope of Heauen and of Gods sonne the sight Which in our flesh and sinfull soule lay dead, O fayth, O hope, O ioyes renownd for euer, O liuely lyfe that deathlesse shall perseuer. Then let vs sing the lullabyes of sleepe, To this sweet babe, borne to awake vs all, From drowsie sinne that made old Adam weepe, And by his fault gaue to mankinde the fall, For loe this day, the byrth day day of dayes, Somons our songs to giue him laud &amp; praise. Finis. [XLI. Who made: Sweet beautie which hath powre to bowe] A Dialogue betwen two Sheperds. Who made: Sweet beautie which hath powre to bowe the gods aboue Who made: Sweet beautie which hath powre to bowe the gods aboue. I, such as hath no peere, I gesse.

[XLV. Vnto the hills myne eyes I lyft] Vnto the hills myne eyes I lyft Vnto the hills myne eyes I lyft, myne eyes I lyft, vnto the hills mine eyes I lyft, my hope shall neuer fade, but from the Lord I looke for helpe, for helpe, that heauen and earth hath made: hath made, hath made, Thy foote he will from slipping saue, &amp; he y? doth thee keepe, thee keepe, with watchfull eye will thee preserue, will thee preserue, without slomber or sleepe, or sleepe, without slomber or sleepe.
