      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. âI WILL A ROUND UNVARNISHED TALE DELIVER.â ODE. Rejoice, rejoice! the witchery works, The hour of horror hastens on, Death in the pledged goblet lurks,â The isle of honour is undone! Hurrah! the ancient sceptre fails,â Instead, the brand of vengeance sways!â Hark! the reign of war prevails,â Buroughs burn and bulwarks blaze. The halo leaves the royal head, To helmets grim the mitres grow, The lawn is dyed with murder red, And at carousals lewd and dread Batter'd chalices o'erflow. JOHN GALT. Away, away, ye pallid crew That would the seal of fate unfix; The vultures hover thick in view That shall your mangled members mix! The sun has set no more to rise, Though through the stormy clouds awhile His twilight beams may gild the skies That canopy the blasted isle. The night of sorrow closes round,â Stir up the havoc breeding spell;â Staggering earthquakes reel and bound, Despair exults, by madness crown'd,â Hurry, hags! halloo! for hell! [Helpless, forgotten, sad, and lame] Helpless, forgotten, sad, and lame, On one lone seat the live long day, I muse of youth and dreams of fame, And hopes and wishes all away. No more to me with carol gay, Shall mounting lark from pasture rise, Nor breezes bland on upland play, Nor far fair scenes my steps entice. Ah, never more beneath the skies, The winged heart shall glowing soar, Nor e'er be reach'd the goal or prize,â The spells of life enchant no more. The burning thought, the boding sigh, The grief unnam'd that old men feel, The languid limbs that withering lie, The powerless will's effectless zeal; All these are mine, and Heaven bestows The gifts, but still I find them woes. EPIGRAM. With title, wealth, and genius blest, The noble Byron knows no rest; From clime to clime, he flies in vain, Nor finds a refuge from his pain. Is love, rejected love the cause, Perfidious friendship, or the laws? Or does the moon control his blood? Ah no. What then? His books reviewed. THE SPANISH DOLLAR. Behold a street in a Sicilian town, Which still retains some name of old renown. That red letica near yon portal placed, Denotes the arrival of a stranger guest; But lo! the actors, peasants they appear, Hear what they say, and reverence what you hear. âThe solar blaze, my friend Antonio, quit, And in the shadow of this chapel sit, Hear on my knees lay thy unwashen face, While through thy tangled locks I raise the chase; Thine be the reveries of the drowsy joy, And mine the bliss of seeking to destroy.â âAh Ludovico! other thoughts excite My eager scratching than that dear delight. An English traveller has arrived to day, And how to serve him all my wits essay. Three prices for our vile Sicilian trash The Ingleses pay, and never grudge the cash; And this mi lord has given, oh best of men! That Spanish dollar for my leanest hen. The hen my wife, with salt and Indian spice, In water stews, but what should be the price With deep perplexity confounds my brainâ Oh, virgin mother! ease my doubt and pain! For well you know, if I too much require, For cooking, dishes, pepper, salt, and fire, (The thought appals my very heart with dread,) The unruly Englishman will break my head; And if but what he freely pays, the loss Till chance repair it, every joy will cross.â âThe case, Antonio, is somewhat new, But let us take it in a double view. What! salt and spice, and fire and wife to cook,â For half a dollar, friend, you well may look.â âBut half a dollar, Ludovico, oh!â âNay, good Antonio, I said not so; Hear but my counsel, and you yet may own, Two dollars more, and still preserve your crown. In numerous parts, as lawyers charges frame, Divide the costs, and still before hand claim; The small half-dollar ne'er will breed a strife, For pepper, salt, and fire, and work of wife; Therefore reserve it for the last demand, And humbly ask it with a beggar's hand.â âDear Ludovico, so I mean to do; But how shall I obtain the other two?â âAy, there, Antonio, there the puzzle lies, And plain it is that ne'er the shining prize You by your own unaided wits would reach; But let me share and I the art will teach. Give me that dollar in your hand for fee, And I will teach you how to gain still three.â âThree, Ludovico! be the silver thine. Oh! that I could exchange thy brains for mine.â âWell, first, you know, the English must have wine; To purchase that, a dollar boldly ask, And fill a bottle from the huxter's cask; Which, new and weak, no Englishman will taste, So in the cask it may be all replaced. Meanwhile your wife, with skilful hand may make The stew such as no Englishman can take; And other fare you must of course provide; For eggs and bread he may be safely tried A full half dollar, and for fruit you know, Another ask;âwhy there you see are two; And for the third you need not fear to try, If he antiquities or toys will buy. A worn tarri to sell, as wondrous rare; A Punic coinânay, but the thing is fair; For our Sicilia was a Punic isle, And rare that coin is the reward of toil.â âAh, reprobates!â exclaimed a voice behind, Aghast they turn, and see with ear inclined, A full fed monk look slily from within. All he had heard, and thus reproved their sin: âAh, reprobates! to me that dollar give, Such knaves as you are hardly fit to live. How now, Antonio, to cheat so willing, Your famished hen is not worth half a shilling. Go, Ludovico, sinner as thou art, How durst thou counsels such as these impart? Go instantly, this shocking sin to mend, With your best tales the English lord attend; For true it is, without his nation's aid, Our holy church would drive a losing trade.â The peasants yield and slink away; the priest Seeks the refectory and savory feast. ODE. I With leisure, and a pen at hand, Who can the muse's will withstand? Who can resist, possessing these, And breathing genius in Greece, To let his idle fancy play At numbers and the tinkling lay? II While here I range on classic ground, O'er relics of the long renown'd, And see the hinds that toil for bread Blest as were e'er the famous dead; As happy with their frugal aim As those that lived and died for fame:â III And while I wand'ring here enquire, Where the bright sage and bard of fire, Who glory ray'd in ancient times, That still illumines distant climes, Were wont to shed the radiant thought,â And find them all like hinds forgot;â IV The proud, the strong, the daring fiend, That ever tempts me to ascend, Abash'd relaxes, and content, Asks with some gentle blandishment, What boots the crown or laurel wreath To them that sleep in peaceful death? ATHENIAD. Athenia's wrongs, O heavenly Muse rehearse, And sing the Gods of Greece in English verse!â Athenia, fairest of the mural fair, Whose fuming altars fed the savoury air, Dejected saw beneath th' oppressor's sway, Her trophies perish and her stones decay. No joy she knew, but only grief refined, When far-come travellers paused or look'd behind. Paused to indulge the sigh for glories past, Or wondering look'd that stones so long should last. But this sad solace Fate decreed must cease, And Mercury flies to end the pride of Greece. On earth arrived, the form divine obscured, He seems a mortal man to arts inured; Cadaverous, crafty, skilled in tints and lines, A lean Italian master of designs. He sought Brucides, and Brucides found, âO Lord,â he cries, âmy Lord for taste renown'd, What fame awaits you, were your Lordship wise, And who that knows your lordship that denies. Th' Athenian temples long deserted stand, Their sculptures crumbling in the Turk's rude hand. Haste, save the relics, bear them to your home, The lights of art for ages yet to come. Grudge not the cost, the marbles, countless price Would buy the profits of rich embassies.â Fired by the scheme, his way Brucides took, And public tasks, and trusts of state forsook; With ready gold he calls men, carts, and cords, Cords, carts, and men, rise at the baited words. The ropes asunder rive the wedded stone, The mortals labour, and the axles groan, Hymettus echoes to the tumbling fane, And shook th' Acropolis,âshakes all the plain. From high Olympus gazed the Gods afar, Indignant gazed that man their wrath should dare, âFate,â they exclaimed, âthat guides the course of things, And from whose cave, the streams of action springs, Has justly shown in every age and time, That Retribution sternly follows crime. Shall we then tamely see our temples torn, And o'er the seas the Grecian relics borne; See that Brucides glorious become, Like the bold youth that fired th' Ephesian dome? No, by the Styx,â with raised right hands they cried. Jove nodded, and the oath was ratified. Appall'd the Heavens, and Earth received the sign, The sun in clouds conceal'd his face divine; The winds lamented, and the rain in tears, Filled the lone traveller on the waste with fears; Thieves of the dead, though grasping at the urn, Scar'd by the shower, the scafiers return, And their abortive toil, the antiquaries mourn. On war resolv'd, the heavenly powers prepare, And eager all the work of vengeance share; To each the part that best befits is given, So Heaven appoints,âcan kings appoint like Heaven? Lo! smoothly wafted by the breathing gales, A ship with sacrilegious plunder sails,â The busy creek of rocky Hydra past, And o'er the starboard far Le specia cast, Cerigo nears, while on the distant view, The hills of Maina rise serene and blue; Those rugged mountains, where in savage pride, Still unsubdued the Spartan race reside. Deprived of all, they independence vaunt, And glorious live in liberty and want. True to his trust, and wakeful on the steep, Ãolus scann'd aftar the rippling deep; And by the sapience of his state divine, Knew the curs'd bark that stirr'd the azure brine;â Recall'd the gales that gently urged her on, And bade the winds attend his misty throne. The winds obeyed. Scirocco came the first, Pluto's dire son, by Airia desert-nurst; Languid his eyes, and fleecy white his hair, He breathes contagion and inspires despair. At his approach the gay flowers sickly bend, And birds dejected own the present fiend; Sicilian youths invoke the god of sleep, And women weeping, wonder why they weep. Next Tramontan beneath whose breezy sway The tides of life in brisker eddies play. From his bright brow and clear blue cheerful eyes, Dejection spreads her mothlike wings and flies. Him fair Hygea to rude Boreas bore, And left with Fortune on the Lapland shore. The fickle nymph grew careless of the charge, And the bold boy ran wand'ring wild at large. This heard the mother, who in anxious haste, With stretched hands pursued him o'er the waste: Still unembrac'd he shuns her stretched hands, And roves a Libertine in foreign landsâ With him Favonius, but the subject Muse, By PhÅbus order'd, now her tale renews; Else would she sing what airy tasks perform, The fire-eyed tempest and the howling storm, The cool wing'd zephyr of the mountain's brow; The gales that chace the gossamer below; The sighs that haunt the rip'ning virgins breast, Th' exploits of flatulence, th' unwelcome guest. These she should, pleas'd in lofty strains, relate, But Gods controul the verse and will another fate. The winds instructed rush to raise the warâ Ãolus fiercely mounts his winged car, And gaining Neptune's crystal portal cries, âLord of the sounding seas, awake, arise. Mortals profane, th' Athenian temples rend, And o'er thy wide domain the fragments send. Deep charged with spoil a ship presumptuous moves, And vain alone his hate Ãolus proves.â Ãolus paus'd, the God of ocean heard, Rais'd his rough front, and shook his hoary beard. âWhy chides the sovereign of the winds,â he cried, And seized the trident resting at his side. Blow murmurer, blow, squeeze all your bags and blow, And let the vessel to perdition go.â Ãolus fetched his breath, low-bending, blew, And Neptune rising the dread trident, threwâ It strikesâThe vessel founders in the waves, And aw'd Cerigo mourns from all her caves. Meanwhile Minerva, who of all the powers That mourned indignantly their ravish'd towers, Suffered the mostâadvanced with keenest rage, To aim the vengeance, and the war to wage; Against Brucides' self she urged her plans, And deeds the goddess did, appear the man'sâ Revenge she seeks by various means and ways, Inspires his pen, and strikes his brain with craze. Delirious fancies that were never thought, Helpless Brucides innocently wrote. From the charm'd pen a strange perversion springs, He thinks of statues and it writes down kings; Basso relievos occupy his brain, While towns and armies fill the paper plain: His doom at length the froward pen provokes, For British statesmen, writing marble blocks. At home the sages, struck with sad surprise, Gaze on the page with nostrils, mouth, and eyesâ With mouth apert and nostrils wide and round, The senseless slaves of wonder still are found. Thrice and again his paper all peruse, Thrice and again each sage his neighbour views: Thrice and again each sage essay'd to speak, And tears, as statesmen weep, run down each cheek. âCalls he us marble blocks,â at once they cry, âYes, marble blocks,â the Treasury vaults reply. âThen let the wretch,â they all again exclaim, âNo longer bear a diplomatic name.â With canvas wings the fiat leaves the shoreâ The man exists, the minister's no more. Dejected, homeward now he winds his way, With slow, reluctant, amorous delay. Him fair Italia's pictured domes detain, Nor trophied France invites to stay in vain; Gay France, that boasts the two best sculptured stones, Bought with the blood of thousands of her sons. With fervent ire that though of power bereft, Brucides still had sprightly pleasures left; The blue-eyed goddess for her chariot calls, Proudly the steeds come neighing from their stalls. The conscious car exults in all its springs, And o'er the steeds the glittering harness flings. Minerva mounts, and through th'empyrean drawn, (Her progress brightening like the solar dawn,) Down the steep slope of Heaven directs her course Steers the prone chariot and restrains the horse. She drives to Paris. In their swift career The golden wheels like whirling fires appear. A sage, with astronomic tube afar, A fore-one sees, and hails the new found star; Describes its motions, calculates its speed, And gains, like Herschel, an immortal meed. So move the gods to man's imperfect glanceâ And who could think a goddess drove to France. Arrived, her chariot in the clouds she leaves, And in the form of Talleyrand deceives.â Inspires the Consul, and with skill divine, Makes her stern purpose politic design. She bids before his eager fancy stand, The British throng throughout his subject landâ That idle throng of every kind, who sped To learn new luxuries of board and bed, When France in peace and antient nicknames dealt, And gained repose to plan new modes of guilt. These she array'd in all the charms that grace The best and bravest of the British race, With wisdom, valour, riches, beauty, all That wins in council, camp, or court, or ball. âBut these,â she cries, âO Heaven-sent chief detain, And soon Britannia must resign the main. Possessing these, her genius you controul, For wanting them she wants her life and soul. Behold Brucides! well his face peruse; What signs of sense, and long prospective views, Denotes that moon of flesh, so round and full, And see that dungeon vault of wit his scull. Oh! all ye deities addressed in song, Inspire our chief to keep this precious throng; But prime o'er all, may he Brucides hold; A prize more precious than the Greeks of old From Ilion stole, before the heavenly powers Resigned to Fate the long beleaguered towers. So shall Britannia, her palladium lost, Receive the conqueror and enrich his host.â The hero smiled, that Talleyrand in zeal, Should still the force of former habits feel, And pray; but more because the council shrewd, Shewed an appearance of renown renewed. Forth flies th' arrÃªte, and every British guest, With helpless passion bans the dire arrest. Thus heavenly causes take effect on earth, And statesmen gossiping proclaim the birth. Meanwhile refulgent Mars commissioned comes, With ringing cymbals and resounding drums. His fervid influence fires the madding world, Arms scoured shine bright and standards wave unfurled. St. Stephen's windows, at the dead of night, Glare on the Thames a dull portentous light. But fierce o'er Athens' consecrated walls, The zenith fervor of the Godhead falls. Oh, Muse divine! rehearse with kindred zeal What happened thereâthe battle of the wheel. In olden times, ere on the banks of Nile The Gallic warriors fed the crocodileâ Ere Atheist antiquaries banded there, Discovered temples older than the air, And proved, by hieroglyphic beasts and birds, (The patriarchal ancestors of words;) That earth was never made, nor mortal man, And time's great clock, ay, without maker ran; From famed Byzantium to old Athens came, A four-wheeled waggon of stupendous frame, With what intent Discord alone can tell; Discord it was that sent it to Fouvelle. While yet the axles with the journey glowed, And the wheels' tracts shone recent on the road, Spread wond'rous tidings, that th' unwarning French With blood and water ravished Egypt drenchâ Alarmed Fouvelle, the Turkish sabre flies, And in his shed the cart abandoned lies; The Turks, exulting at so rare a pledge, For royal Egypt seized the four-wheeled sledge. And when Britannia, with triumphant arms, Restored the land to rapine and alarms, The Turks to recompense, with generous heart, Gave to her dragoman the fatal cart. He, Greek-like, hoping thrice its price to gain, Informs Dontitos, and bestows the wain. Dontitos, chieftain of the cords and crew, That from their frames the sacred sculptures drew. Hence sprung the occasion, why tremendous Mars Came down below, and filled the world with wars. Wars that expelled the CÃ¦zar from his throne, Made pious Spain three powerless kings bemoan; And stirring strong, in stomachs proud and high, Forced Castlereagh at Canning to let fly. What time Minerva, as the Muse has sung, Seem'd Talleyrand with shrewd persuasive tongue; Fouvelle to his Athenian home returned, But Discord's four-wheeled gift long lost he mourned. Pensive he walked Ilyssus' sedgy brink, Ilyssus' stream, that a young drake might drink. Scans the great columns of Olympian Jove, And wistful eyes th' Acropolis above. Reflects on noble enterprises crost, And his Byzantian cart untimely lost. One fatal morn, by chance or fortune led, The wretched chief had left his sleepless bed, And sadly passing Hadrian's stately arch, Faced to the right and westward chose to march. Eventful march! two oxen there he saw, Driven by a Greek, a loaded waggon draw. The unusual sight like magic charms his eyes, Till captive in the nearing wain he spies An orphan wheel of his lamented cart. Surprise with quick electric roused his heart; Courageous grasping firm his stick, he ran, Stopped the two oxen, and menaced the man; The man retreating in amazement, flew And told Dontitos, for the oxen drew Relics of Greece and fragments of her skill, The worshipp'd offspring of Pentele's hill, Pentele's hill, within whose quarried cave The travellers ponder and their names engrave. Dontitos started, seized his hat and cane, White beaver hat with black cockade so plain, Which Turks admiring called the moon of power, And strode majestic from his lofty tower. Th' approaching chief Fouvelle descries afar, And bravely meets him half way from the car; âThat wheel is mine!â he points his stick and cries; Dontitos strove to frown with both his eyes. âThat wheel is mine, I say,â Fouvelle repeats; Dontitos answersâand his bosom beatsâ âYour wheel!â âYes, mine.â Dontitos cries, âIt may, But I will write my Lord,ââand turning, walked away. As pleased the Muse the theme of strife would yield, As the tired warrior quits the well-fought field To join his friends and rural home again, No more a tenant of the tented plain, Could thoughts like his be mingled with the lay; Spring's cheerful morn, or summer's jocund day, Th' autumnal eve, when jibes sarcastic please, And the long winter nights of tales and ease. O, gentle Venus! at whose glowing shrine The bard oft kneeling owns thy power divine, For once thy triumphs he reluctant sings, Her face the loth muse veiling with her wings; But Juno comes,âwith interdictions strong, Forbids the thought, and cramps the sprightly song. Apollo's wrath alone unsung remains;â His was to celebrate in epic strains These great achievements and success sublime, Things unattempted or in prose or rhyme; For this he chose th' heroic British verse, Balanced the lines, and bade the bard rehearse. Thus wrought the gods in old Athenia's cause, Avenged their fanes, and will'd the world's applause. TO THE RIVER PENEUS. Peneus! as on thy green side A pensive hour I chance to spend, Where, o'er thy gaily flowing tide The beeches bow and osiers bend; And saw, beneath the varied shade, The ruminating herds recline, And lengths of woven thrift display'd Along thy rural margin shine; Methought that youth was still my own As when I strayed by Irvine's stream, And all the cares I since have known The phantoms of a troubled dream. Ah! never shall I know again Those simple hopes of blithesome hue, The playmates gay of fancy's train, Such as by Irvine's stream I knew. ODE TO SIMPLICITY. I Mother of beauty, nymph divine, Hail, ever fair Simplicity! Long far remote from thy green shrine, Enchanted by the wizard powers, I lingered in fantastic towers, Nor felt thy mild benignity. II But now with the dissolving spell Fly all the forms of sorcery, And in the gentle hermit's cell, Restraintâthat to thy altar brings A temperate feast from fruits and springs, Allays my fevered phantasy. III Still more and more, sweet nymph, inspire Thy proselyte and votary, And teach him as he wakes the wire, Those sacred touches to impart That suddenly surprise the heart In thy unstudied melody. EPIGRAM. If 'tis old age to mope alone, Fortune, hope, health, and friendship gone, Return'd from viewing many a clime, And reading but to kill the time, With wat'ry eye, and bosom cold, Friends, that were mine,âam I not old? [âWhen evil falls, and you see all its scope] âWhen evil falls, and you see all its scope, Trust to the native courage of your breast, And such auxiliar aid as fate may send, To master the misfortune: trust yourself, And trust your destiny, for such begets That self-possession which endures the shock Of rough adversity, and lifts the man Above the waves and currents of the time; But when the matter hangs in dread, and may By strength or enterprise be yet repelled, Then call your friends, take counsel, and take aid.â IMPROMPTU. When time matured the plan of fate, That gave imperial Rome her date, Devouring vultures hovering came, An omen of her warlike fame; But signs of other aspect shew What Jove will on your work bestow. Yes, when he bade the timid hare, Astonished to the docks repair, The sign propitious proved it plain, The coyest commerce of the main Should wondering there be found at last, To aid Britannia's rich repast.</field>

TO THE AUTHOR OF MARMION. I Oh! sure when stretched on grassy knoll, 'Mid Ettrick's haunted scenery, Watching the vassal runnells roll, To where the restless summer beam, On well sung Tweed's baronial stream, Held gay and flickering revelry; II Some gentle faÃ«ry resting nigh, Beneath her gowan canopy, Heard the entranced truant sigh For deeds of bold and earnest toil, The borderer's joy of speed and spoil, And pomp of knightly panoply. III Well pleased a child so rare to findâ So meet for noble chivalry; A spell of elfin art combin'd That gave thee all thy soul desired, Whatever chief or champion fired In bless'd and blessing poÃ«sy. THE APOTHEOSIS OF SIR WALTER SCOTT. I Ho! thou upon the upland, thou On Eildon's haunted wild on high, What glory lights thy upward browâ What vision draws thy wondering eye? The sun shines cloudless in the sky, Thy forehead shews as bright a sheen.â What pageant see'st thou passing byâ Rapt shepherd, speak! what hast thou seen? II âAs radiant from the north ascends The dayless morning's mystic light, When stars grow dim and moonlight ends, Rise phantom forms that charm my sight, Like fires that gleam athwart the night, While all, as if his race were run, Dim, shrunk, and faded, sickly white, Sits on his throne, the dazzled sun. III âThere following comes, in wavering flame, Dejected grief, and guilt sublime; The blush that bears no tint of shame, Th' untainting tale that tells of crime; The seneschal of feudal time, The crested pride of chivalry, The faÃ«rys' prankâthe witches' rhyme, The hints and gleams of prophecy. IV âThey mount: the progeny of thought, The minstrel grave, the goblin gay; The ghost, of mist and moonlight wrought; The bearded monk, the hermit gray; And here the host, and there the fray, As in Sir Godfrey's vision shown, And bannered chiefs, in proud array Refulgent, from the battle won. V âLo! mingling sprites of every hue, The maiden's dream, the widow's fright; Green vestured elves, with eyes of dew, And things of joy, with locks of light; Whate'er is fair, and good, and bright, To universal nature true, As heralds of immortal right, Arise to claim the poet's due.ââ VI Thus to my loud, impassioned call, The raptured swain ecstatic spoke, While dim and dark a funeral pall Unrolling, as the silent smoke, His high-entranced vision broke, And glooming o'er the Tweed below, As lowering clouds that storms invoke, Was seen the solemn pomp of woe. VII On hill and dale, and storied moor, Lamentings sadden all the air, And palace dome, and cottage door, Alike the general sorrow share; But ah, how vain is praise or prayer, The spell that bade the phantoms rise Is broken: their creator thereâ The master wizardâlowly lies!</field>
