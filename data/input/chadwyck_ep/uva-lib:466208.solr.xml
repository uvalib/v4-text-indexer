      <field name="fulltext">LAYS OF THE WESTERN GAEL THE BURIAL OF KING CORMAC. INTRODUCTORY NOTE. Cormac, son of Art, son of Con Cead-Catha. i.e. Hundred-Battle. enjoyed the sovereignty of Ireland through the prolonged period of forty years, commencing from A.D. 213. During the latter part of his reign he resided at Sletty on the Boyne, being, it is said, disqualified for the occupation of Tara by the personal blemish he had sustained in the loss of an eye, by the hand of Angus “Dread-Spear,” chief of the Desi, a tribe whose original seats were in the barony of Deece, in the county of Meath. It was in the time of Cormac and his son Carbre, if we are to credit the Irish Annals, that Fin, son of Comhal, and the Fenian heroes, celebrated by Ossian, flourished. Cormac has obtained the reputation of wisdom and learning, and appears justly entitled to the honour of having provoked the enmity of the Pagan priesthood, by declaring his faith in a God not made by hands of men. Crom Cruach and his sub-gods twelve,” Said Cormac, “are but carven treene; The axe that made them, haft or helve, Had worthier of our worship been. “But he who made the tree to grow, And hid in earth the iron-stone, And made the man with mind to know, The axe's use, is God alone.” Anon to priests of Crom was brought— Where, girded in their service dread, They minister'd on red Moy Slaught— Word of the words King Cormac said. They loosed their curse against the king; They cursed him in his flesh and bones; And daily in their mystic ring They turned the maledictive stones, Till, where at meat the monarch sate, Amid the revel and the wine, He choked upon the food he ate, At Sletty, southward of the Boyne. High vaunted then the priestly throng, And far and wide they noised abroad With trump and loud liturgic song The praise of their avenging God. But ere the voice was wholly spent That priest and prince should still obey, To awed attendants o'er him bent Great Cormac gather'd breath to say,— “Spread not the beds of Brugh for me When restless death-bed's use is done: But bury me at Rossnaree And face me to the rising sun. “For all the kings who lie in Brugh Put trust in gods of wood and stone; And 'twas at Ross that first I knew One, Unseen, who is God alone. “His glory lightens from the east; His message soon shall reach our shore; And idol-god and cursing priest Shall plague us from Moy Slaught no more.” Dead Cormac on his bier they laid:— “He reign'd a king for forty years, And shame it were,” his captains said, “He lay not with his royal peers. “His grandsire, Hundred-Battle, sleeps Serene in Brugh: and, all around, Dead kings in stone sepulchral keeps Protect the sacred burial ground. “What though a dying man should rave Of changes o'er the eastern sea? In Brugh of Boyne shall be his grave, And not in noteless Rossnaree.” There northward forth they bore the bier, And down from Sletty side they drew, With horseman and with charioteer, To cross the fords of Boyne to Brugh. There came a breath of finer air That touched the Boyne with ruffling wings, It stirr'd him in his sedgy lair And in his mossy moorland springs. And as the burial train came down With dirge and savage dolorous shows, Across their pathway, broad and brown The deep, full-hearted river rose; From bank to bank through all his fords, 'Neath blackening squalls he swell'd and boil'd; And thrice the wondering gentile lords Essay'd to cross, and thrice recoil'd. Then forth stepp'd grey-hair'd warriors four: They said, “Through angrier floods than these, On link'd shields once our king we bore From Dread-Spear and the hosts of Deece. “And long as loyal will holds good, And limbs respond with helpful thews, Nor flood, nor fiend within the flood, Shall bar him of his burial dues.” With slanted necks they stoop'd to lift; They heaved him up to neck and chin; And, pair and pair, with footsteps swift, Lock'd arm and shoulder, bore him in. 'Twas brave to see them leave the shore; To mark the deep'ning surges rise, And fall subdued in foam before The tension of their striding thighs. 'Twas brave, when now a spear-cast out, Breast-high the battling surges ran; For weight was great, and limbs were stout, And loyal man put trust in man. But ere they reach'd the middle deep, Nor steadying weight of clay they bore, Nor strain of sinewy limbs could keep Their feet beneath the swerving four. And now they slide, and now they swim, And now, amid the blackening squall, Grey locks afloat, with clutchings grim, They plunge around the floating pall. While, as a youth with practised spear Through justling crowds bears off the ring, Boyne from their shoulders caught the bier And proudly bore away the king. At morning, on the grassy marge Of Rossnaree, the corpse was found, And shepherds at their early charge Entomb'd it in the peaceful ground. A tranquil spot: a hopeful sound Comes from the ever youthful stream, And still on daisied mead and mound The dawn delays with tenderer beam. Round Cormac Spring renews her buds: In march perpetual by his side, Down come the earth-fresh April floods, And up the sea-fresh salmon glide; And life and time rejoicing run From age to age their wonted way; But still he waits the risen Sun, For still 'tis only dawning Day. THE WELSHMEN OF TIRAWLEY. INTRODUCTORY NOTE. Several Welsh Families, associates in the invasion of Strongbow, settled in the west of Ireland. Of these, the principal whose names have been preserved by the Irish antiquarians were the Walshes, Joyces, Heils (a quibus Mac Hale), Lawlesses, Tomlyns, Lynotts, and Barretts, which last draw their pedigree from Walynes, son of Guyndally, the Ard Maor, or High Steward of the Lordship of Camelot, and had their chief seats in the territory of the two Bacs, in the barony of Tirawley, and County of Mayo. Clochan-na-n'all, i.e., “the Blind Men's Stepping-stones,” are still pointed out on the Duvowen river, about four miles north of Crossmolina, in the townland of Garranard; and Tubber-na-Scorney, or “Scrag's Well,” in the opposite townland of Carns, in the same barony. For a curious terrier or applotment of the Mac William's revenue, as acquired under the circumstances stated in the legend preserved by Mac Firbis, see Dr. O'Donovan's highly-learned and interesting “Genealogies, &amp;c. of Hy Fiachrach,” in the publications of the Irish Archæological Society—a great monument of antiquarian and topographical erudition. Scorna boy, the Barretts' bailiff, lewd and lame, To lift the Lynotts' taxes when he came, Rudely drew a young maid to him; Then the Lynotts rose and slew him, And in Tubber-na-Scorney threw him— Small your blame, Sons of Lynott! Sing the vengeance of the Welshmen of Tirawley. Then the Barretts to the Lynotts proposed a choice, Saying, “Hear, ye murderous brood, men and boys, For this deed to-day ye lose Sight or manhood: say and choose Which ye keep and which refuse; And rejoice That our mercy Leaves you living for a warning to Tirawley.” Then the little boys of the Lynotts, weeping, said, “Only leave us our eyesight in our head,” But the bearded Lynotts then Made answer back again, “Take our eyes, but leave us men, Alive or dead, Sons of Wattin!” Sing the vengeance of the Welshmen of Tirawley. So the Barretts, with sewing-needles sharp and smooth, Let the light out of the eyes of every youth, And of every bearded man Of the broken Lynott clan; Then their darken'd faces wan Turning south To the river— Sing the vengeance of the Welshmen of Tirawley. O'er the slippery stepping-stones of Clochan-na-n'all They drove them, laughing loud at every fall, As their wandering footsteps dark Fail'd to reach the slippery mark, And the swift stream swallow'd stark, One and all, As they stumbled— From the vengeance of the Welshmen of Tirawley. Of all the blinded Lynotts one alone Walk'd erect from stepping-stone to stone: So back again they brought you, And a second time they wrought you With their needles; but never got you Once to groan, Emon Lynott, For the vengeance of the Welshmen of Tirawley. But with prompt-projected footsteps sure as ever, Emon Lynott again cross'd the river. Though Duvowen was rising fast, And the shaking stones o'ercast By cold floods boiling past; Yet you never, Emon Lynott, Faltered once before your foemen of Tirawley! But, turning on Ballintubber bank, you stood, And the Barretts thus bespoke o'er the flood— “Oh, ye foolish sons of Wattin, Small amends are these you've gotten, For, while Scorna Boy lies rotten, I am good For vengeance!” Sing the vengeance of the Welshmen of Tirawley. “For 'tis neither in eye nor eyesight that a man Bears the fortunes of himself and his clan, But in the manly mind, These darken'd orbs behind, That your needles could never find Though they ran Through my heart-strings!” Sing the vengeance of the Welshmen of Tirawley. “But, little your women's needles do I reck: For the night from heaven never fell so black, But Tirawley, and abroad From the Moy to Cuan-an-fod, I could walk it, every sod, Path and track, Ford and togher, Seeking vengeance on you, Barretts of Tirawley! “The night when Dathy O'Dowda broke your camp, What Barrett among you was it held the lamp— Show'd the way to those two feet, When through wintry wind and sleet, I guided your blind retreat In the swamp Of Beäl-an-asa? O ye vengeance-destined ingrates of Tirawley!” So leaving loud-shriek-echoing Garranard, The Lynott like a red dog hunted hard, With his wife and children seven, 'Mong the beasts and fowls of heaven In the hollows of Glen Nephin, Light-debarr'd Made his dwelling, Planning vengeance on the Barretts of Tirawley. And ere the bright-orb'd year its course had run, On his brown round-knotted knee he nurs'd a son, A child of light, with eyes As clear as are the skies In summer, when sunrise Has begun; So the Lynott Nursed his vengeance on the Barretts of Tirawley. And, as ever the bright boy grew in strength and size, Made him perfect in each manly exercise, The salmon in the flood, The dun deer in the wood, The eagle in the cloud To surprise On Ben Nephin, Far above the foggy fields of Tirawley. With the yellow-knotted spear-shaft, with the bow, With the steel, prompt to deal shot and blow, He taught him from year to year And train'd him, without a peer, For a perfect cavalier, Hoping so— Far his forethought— For vengeance on the Barretts of Tirawley. And, when mounted on his proud-bounding steed, Emon Oge sat a cavalier indeed; Like the ear upon the wheat When winds in Autumn beat On the bending stems, his seat; And the speed Of his courser Was the wind from Barna-na-gee o'er Tirawley! Now when fifteen sunny summers thus were spent, (He perfected in all accomplishment)— The Lynott said, “My child, We are over long exiled From mankind in this wild— —Time we went Through the mountain To the countries lying over-against Tirawley.” So, out over mountain-moors, and mosses brown, And green stream-gathering vales, they journey'd down; Till, shining like a star, Through the dusky gleams afar, The bailey of Castlebar, And the town Of Mac William Rose bright before the wanderers of Tirawley. “Look southward, my boy, and tell me as we go, What seest thou by the loch-head below.” “Oh, a stone-house strong and great, And a horse-host at the gate, And their captain in armour of plate— Grand the show! Great the glancing! High the heroes of this land below Tirawley! “And a beautiful Woman-chief by his side, Yellow gold on all her gown-sleeves wide; And in her hand a pearl Of a young, little, fair-hair'd girl.”— Said the Lynott, “It is the Earl! Let us ride To his presence!” And before him came the exiles of Tirawley. “God save thee, Mac William,” the Lynott thus began; “God save all here besides of this clan; For gossips dear to me Are all in company— For in these four bones ye see A kindly man Of the Britons— Emon Lynott of Garranard of Tirawley. “And hither, as kindly gossip-law allows, I come to claim a scion of thy house To foster; for thy race, Since William Conquer's days Have ever been wont to place, With some spouse Of a Briton, A Mac William Oge, to foster in Tirawley. “And to show thee in what sort our youth are taught, I have hither to thy home of valour brought This one son of my age, For a sample and a pledge For the equal tutelage, In right thought, Word, and action, Of whatever son ye give into Tirawley.” When Mac William beheld the brave boy ride and run, Saw the spear-shaft from his white shoulder spun— With a sigh, and with a smile, He said,—“I would give the spoil Of a county, that Tibbot Tibbot, that is, Theobald. Moyle, My own son, Were accomplish'd Like this branch of the kindly Britons of Tirawley.” When the Lady Mac William she heard him speak, And saw the ruddy roses on his cheek, She said, “I would give a purse Of red gold to the nurse That would rear my Tibbot no worse; But I seek Hitherto vainly— Heaven grant that I now have found her in Tirawley!” So they said to the Lynott, “Here, take our bird! And as pledge for the keeping of thy word, Let this scion here remain Till thou comest back again: Mean while the fitting train Of a lord Shall attend thee With the lordly heir of Connaught into Tirawley.” So back to strong-throng-gathering Garranard, Like a lord of the country with his guard, Came the Lynott, before them all. Once again over Clochan-na-n'all, Steady-striding, erect, and tall, And his ward On his shoulders; To the wonder of the Welshmen of Tirawley. Then a diligent foster-father you would deem The Lynott, teaching Tibbot, by mead and stream, To cast the spear, to ride, To stem the rushing tide, With what feats of body beside, Might beseem A Mac William, Foster'd free among the Welshmen of Tirawley. But the lesson of hell he taught him in heart and mind; For to what desire soever he inclined, Of anger, lust, or pride, He had it gratified, Till he ranged the circle wide Of a blind Self-indulgence, Ere he came to youthful manhood in Tirawley. Then, even as when a hunter slips a hound, Lynott loosed him—God's leashes all unbound— In the pride of power and station, And the strength of youthful passion, On the daughters of thy nation, All around, Wattin Barrett! Oh! the vengeance of the Welshmen of Tirawley! Bitter grief and burning anger, rage and shame, Fill'd the houses of the Barretts where'er he came; Till the young men of the Bac Drew by night upon his track, And slew him at Cornassack— Small your blame, Sons of Wattin! Sing the vengeance of the Welshmen of Tirawley. Said the Lynott, “The day of my vengeance is drawing near, The day for which, through many a long dark year, I have toil'd through grief and sin— Call ye now the Brehons in, And let the plea begin Over the bier Of Mac William, For an eric upon the Barretts of Tirawley. Then the Brehons to Mac William Burk decreed An eric upon Clan Barrett for the deed; And the Lynott's share of the fine, As foster-father, was nine Ploughlands and nine score kine; But no need Had the Lynott, Neither care, for land or cattle in Tirawley. But rising, while all sat silent on the spot, He said, “The law says—doth it not?— If the foster-sire elect His portion to reject, He may then the right exact To applot The short eric.” “'Tis the law,” replied the Brehons of Tirawley. Said the Lynott, “I once before had a choice Proposed me, wherein law had little voice; But now I choose, and say, As lawfully I may, I applot the mulct to-day; So rejoice In your ploughlands And your cattle which I renounce throughout Tirawley. “And thus I applot the mulct: I divide The land throughout Clan Barrett on every side Equally, that no place May be without the face Of a foe of Wattin's race— That the pride Of the Barretts May be humbled hence for ever throughout Tirawley. “I adjudge a seat in every Barrett's hall To Mac William: in every stable I give a stall To Mac William: and, beside, Whenever a Burke shall ride Through Tirawley, I provide At his call Needful grooming, Without charge from any hosteler of Tirawley. “Thus lawfully I avenge me for the throes Ye lawlessly caused me and caused those Unhappy shamefaced ones, Who, their mothers expected once, Would have been the sires of sons— O'er whose woes Often weeping, I have groan'd in my exile from Tirawley. “I demand not of you your manhood; but I take— For the Burkes will take it—your Freedom! for the sake Of which all manhood's given, And all good under heaven, And, without which, better even Ye should make Yourselves barren, Than see your children slaves throughout Tirawley! “Neither take I your eyesight from you; as you took Mine and ours: I would have you daily look On one another's eyes, When the strangers tyrannize By your hearths, and blushes arise, That ye brook, Without vengeance, The insults of troops of Tibbots throughout Tirawley! “The vengeance I design'd, now is done, And the days of me and mine nearly run— For, for this, I have broken faith, Teaching him who lies beneath This pall, to merit death; And my son To his father Stands pledged for other teaching in Tirawley.” Said Mac William—“Father and son, hang them high!” And the Lynott they hang'd speedily; But across the salt sea water, To Scotland, with the daughter Of Mac William—well you got her!— Did you fly, Edmund Lindsay, The gentlest of all the Welshmen of Tirawley! 'Tis thus the ancient Ollaves of Erin tell How, through lewdness and revenge, it befell That the sons of William Conquer Came over the sons of Wattin, Throughout all the bounds and borders Of the lands of Auley Mac Fiachra; Pronounced Mac Eeâra. Till the Saxon Oliver Cromwell, And his valiant, Bible-guided, Free heretics of Clan London Coming in, in their succession, Rooted out both Burke and Barrett, And in their empty places New stems of freedom planted, With many a goodly sapling Of manliness and virtue; Which while their children cherish, Kindly Irish of the Irish, Neither Saxons nor Italians, May the mighty God of Freedom Speed them well, Never taking Further vengeance on his people of Tirawley. OWEN BAWN. INTRODUCTORY NOTE. William de burgho, Third Earl of Ulster, pursued the Anglican policy of his day with so much severity, that the native Irish generally withdrew from the counties of Down and Antrim, and established themselves in Tyrone with Hugh Boy O'Neill. William's rigid prohibition of intermarriages with the natives led to his assassination by his own relatives, the Mandevilles, at the Ford of Belfast, A.D. 1333. The Irish then returned from beyond the river Bann, and expelled the English from all Ulster, except Carrickfergus and the barony of Ards in Down; and so continued until their subjugation by Sir Henry Sidney and Sir Arthur Chichester, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Simultaneously with the return of the Clan Hugh-Boy in the north, the great Anglo-Norman families of Connaught adopted Irish names and manners, the De Burghos assuming the name of Mac William, and all accommodating themselves to the Irish system of life and government, in which, with few exceptions, they continued until their subjugation by Sir Richard Bingham, in the reign of King Henry the Eighth. My Owen Bawn's hair is of thread of gold spun; Of gold in the shadow, of light in the sun; All curl'd in a coolun the bright tresses are— They make his head radiant with beams like a star! My Owen Bawn's mantle is long and is wide, To wrap me up safe from the storm by his side; And I'd rather face snow-drift and winter-wind there, Than lie among daisies and sunshine elsewhere. My Owen Bawn Quin is a hunter of deer, He tracks the dun quarry with arrow and spear— Where wild woods are waving, and deep waters flow, Ah, there goes my love with the dun-dappled roe. My Owen Bawn Quin is a bold fisherman, He spears the strong salmon in midst of the Bann; And rock'd in the tempest on stormy Lough Neagh, Draws up the red trout through the bursting of spray. My Owen Bawn Quin is a bard of the best, He wakes me with singing, he sings me to rest; And the cruit 'neath his fingers rings up with a sound, As though angels harp'd o'er us, and fays underground. They tell me the stranger has given command, That crommeal and coolun shall cease in the land, That all our youths' tresses of yellow be shorn, And bonnets, instead, of a new fashion, worn; That mantles like Owen Bawn's shield us no more, That hunting and fishing henceforth we give o'er, That the net and the arrow aside must be laid, For hammer and trowel, and mattock and spade; That the echoes of music must sleep in their caves, That the slave must forget his own tongue for a slave's, That the sounds of our lips must be strange in our ears, And our bleeding hands toil in the dew of our tears. Oh sweetheart and comfort! with thee by my side, I could love and live happy, whatever betide; But thou, in such bondage, wouldst die ere a day— A way to Tir-oën, then, Owen, away! There are wild woods and mountains, and streams deep and clear, There are loughs in Tir-oën as lovely as here; There are silver harps ringing in Yellow Hugh's hall, And a bower by the forest side, sweetest of all! We will dwell by the sunshiny skirts of the brake, Where the sycamore shadows glow deep in the lake; And the snowy swan stirring the green shadows there, Afloat on the water, seems floating in air. Away to Tir-oën, then, Owen, away! We will leave them the dust from our feet for a prey, And our dwelling in ashes and flames for a spoil— 'Twill be long ere they quench them with streams of the Foyle! GRACE O'MALY. INTRODUCTORY NOTE. The return to English rule and habits of the Anglo-Norman families of Connaught who had Hibernicised after the murder of William de Burgho, was not effected without a long alienation of the popular affections which had been bestowed upon them as freely as on native rulers: “for,” to use the words of a contemporary Irish chronicler “the old chieftains of Erin prospered under these princely English lords who were our chief rulers, and who had given up their foreignness for a pure mind, and their surliness for good manners, and their stubbornness for sweet mildness, and who had given up their perverseness for hospitality.” O'Donovan, Tr. and Cust. of Hy Many, p. 136. During this troubled period of transition, Grace O'Maly, lady of Sir Rickard Burke, styled Mac William Eighter, distinguished herself by a life of wayward adventure which has made her name, in its Gaelic form, Grana Uaile (i.e. Grana Ua Mhaile,) a personification, among the Irish peasantry, of that social state which they still consider preferable to the results of a more advanced civilization. The real acts and character of the heroine are hardly seen through the veil of imagination under which the personified idea exists in the popular mind, and is here presented. She left the close-air'd land of trees And proud Mac William's palace, For clear, bare Clare's health-salted breeze, Her oarsmen and her galleys: And where, beside the bending strand The rock and billow wrestle, Between the deep sea and the land She built her Island Castle. The Spanish captains, sailing by For Newport, with amazement Beheld the cannon'd longship lie Moor'd to the lady's casement; And covering coin and cup of gold In haste their hatches under, They whisper'd, “Tis a pirate's hold; She sails the seas for plunder!” But no: 'twas not for sordid spoil Of barque or sea board borough She plough'd, with unfatiguing toil, The fluent-rolling furrow; Delighting on the broad-back'd deep, To feel the quivering galley Strain up the opposing hill, and sweep Down the withdrawing valley: Or, sped before a driving blast, By following seas uplifted, Catch, from the huge heaps heaving past, And from the spray they drifted, And from the winds that toss'd the crest Of each wide-shouldering giant, The smack of freedom and the zest Of rapturous life defiant. For, oh! the mainland time was pent In close constraint and striving:— So many aims together bent On winning and on thriving; There was no room for generous ease, No sympathy for candour;— And so she left Burke's buzzing trees, And all his stony splendour. For Erin yet had fields to spare, Where Clew her cincture gathers Isle-gemm'd; and kindly clans were there, The fosterers of her fathers: Room there for careless feet to roam Secure from minions' peeping, For fearless mirth to find a home And sympathetic weeping; And generous ire and frank disdain To speak the mind, nor ponder How this in England, that in Spain, Might suit to tell; as yonder, Where daily on the slippery dais By thwarting interests chequer'd, State gamesters play the social chess Of politic Clanrickard. Nor wanting quite the lonely isle In civic life's adornings: The Brehon's Court might well beguile A learned lady's mornings. Quaint though the clamorous claim, and rude The pleading that convey'd it, Right conscience made the judgment good, And loyal love obey'd it. And music sure was sweeter far For ears of native nurture, Than virginals at Castlebar To tinkling touch of courtier, When harpers good in hall struck up The planxty's gay commotion, Or pipers scream'd from pennon'd poop Their piobroch over ocean. And sweet to see, their ruddy bloom Whom ocean's friendly distance Preserved still unenslaved; for whom No tasking of existence Made this one rich, and that one poor, In gold's illusive treasure, But all, of easy life secure, Were rich in wealth of leisure. Rich in the Muse's pensive hour, In genial hour for neighbour, Rich in young mankind's happy power To live with little labour; The wise, free way of life, indeed, That still, with charm adaptive, Reclaims and tames the alien greed, And takes the conqueror captive. Nor only life's unclouded looks To compensate its rudeness; Amends there were in holy books, In offices of goodness, In cares above the transient scene Of little gains and honours, That well repaid the Island Queen Her loss of urban manners. Sweet, when the crimson sunsets glow'd, As earth and sky grew grander, Adown the grass'd, unechoing road Atlanticward to wander, Some kinsman's humbler hearth to seek, Some sick-bed side, it may be, Or, onward reach, with footsteps meek, The low, grey, lonely abbey: And, where the storied stone beneath The guise of plant and creature, Had fused the harder lines of faith In easy forms of nature; Such forms as tell the master's pains 'Mong Roslin's carven glories, Or hint the fate of Pictish Thanes On standing stones of Forres; The Branch; the weird cherubic Beasts; The Hart by hounds o'ertaken; Or, intimating mystic feasts, The self-resorbent Dragon;— Mute symbols, though with power endow'd For finer dogmas' teaching, Than clerk might tell to carnal crowd In homily or preaching;— Sit; and while heaven's refulgent show Grew airier and more tender, And ocean's gleaming floor below Reflected loftier splendour, Suffused with light of lingering faith And ritual light's reflection, Discourse of birth, and life, and death, And of the resurrection. But chiefly sweet from morn to eve, From eve to clear-eyed morning, The presence of the felt reprieve From strangers' note and scorning: No prying, proud, intrusive foes To pity and offend her:— Such was the life the lady chose; Such choosing, we commend her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BALLADS AND POEMS. THE FAIRY THORN. AN ULSTER BALLAD. “Get up, our Anna dear, from the weary spinning-wheel; For your father's on the hill, and your mother is asleep: Come up above the crags, and we'll dance a highland-reel Around the fairy thorn on the steep.” At Anna Grace's door 'twas thus the maidens cried, Three merry maidens fair in kirtles of the green; And Anna laid the rock and the weary wheel aside, The fairest of the four, I ween. They're glancing through the glimmer of the quiet eve, Away in milky wavings of neck and ankle bare; The heavy-sliding stream in its sleepy song they leave, And the crags in the ghostly air: And linking hand in hand, and singing as they go, The maids along the hill-side have ta'en their fearless way, Till they come to where the rowan trees in lonely beauty grow Beside the Fairy Hawthorn grey. The Hawthorn stands between the ashes tall and slim, Like matron with her twin grand-daughters at her knee; The rowan berries cluster o'er her low head grey and dim In ruddy kisses sweet to see. The merry maidens four have ranged them in a row, Between each lovely couple a stately rowan stem, And away in mazes wavy, like skimming birds they go, Oh, never caroll'd bird like them! But solemn is the silence of the silvery haze That drinks away their voices in echoless repose, And dreamily the evening has still'd the haunted braes, And dreamier the gloaming grows. And sinking one by one, like lark-notes from the sky When the falcon's shadow saileth across the open shaw, Are hush'd the maiden's voices, as cowering down they lie In the flutter of their sudden awe. For, from the air above, and the grassy ground beneath, And from the mountain-ashes and the old Whitethorn between, A Power of faint enchantment doth through their beings breathe, And they sink down together on the green. They sink together silent, and stealing side by side, They fling their lovely arms o'er their drooping necks so fair, Then vainly strive again their naked arms to hide, For their shrinking necks again are bare. Thus clasp'd and prostrate all, with their heads together bow'd, Soft o'er their bosom's beating—the only human sound— They hear the silky footsteps of the silent fairy crowd, Like a river in the air, gliding round. No scream can any raise, no prayer can any say, But wild, wild, the terror of the speechless three— For they feel fair Anna Grace drawn silently away, By whom they dare not look to see. They feel their tresses twine with her parting locks of gold, And the curls elastic falling as her head withdraws; They feel her sliding arms from their tranced arms unfold. But they may not look to see the cause: For heavy on their senses the faint enchantment lies Through all that night of anguish and perilous amaze; And neither fear nor wonder can ope their quivering eyes Or their limbs from the cold ground raise, Till out of night the earth has roll'd her dewy side, With every haunted mountain and streamy vale below; When, as the mist dissolves in the yellow morning tide, The maidens' trance dissolveth so. Then fly the ghastly three as swiftly as they may, And tell their tale of sorrow to anxious friends in vain— They pined away and died within the year and day, And ne'er was Anna Grace seen again. WILLY GILLILAND. AN ULSTER BALLAD. Up in the mountain solitudes, and in a rebel ring, He has worshipp'd God upon the hill, in spite of church and king; And seal'd his treason with his blood on Bothwell bridge he hath; So he must fly his father's land, or he must die the death; For comely Claverhouse has come along with grim Dalzell, And his smoking rooftree testifies they've done their errand well. In vain to fly his enemies he fled his native land; Hot persecution waited him upon the Carrick strand; His name was on the Carrick cross, a price was on his head, A fortune to the man that brings him in alive or dead! And so on moor and mountain, from the Lagan to the Bann, From house to house, and hill to hill, he lurk'd an out-law'd man. At last, when in false company he might no longer bide, He stay'd his houseless wanderings upon the Collon side, There in a cave all underground he lair'd his heathy den, Ah, many a gentleman was fain to earth like hill fox then! With hound and fishing-rod he lived on hill and stream by day; At night, betwixt his fleet greyhound and his bonny mare he lay. It was a summer evening, and, mellowing and still, Glen whirry to the setting sun lay bare from hill to hill; For all that valley pastoral held neither house nor tree, But spread abroad and open all, a full fair sight to see, From Slemish foot to Collon top lay one unbroken green, Save where in many a silver coil the river glanced between. And on the river's grassy bank, even from the morning grey, He at the angler's pleasant sport had spent the summer day; Ah! many a time and oft I've spent the summer day from dawn, And wonder'd, when the sunset came, where time and care had gone, Along the reaches curling fresh, the wimpling pools and streams, Where he that day his cares forgot in those delightful dreams. His blithe work done, upon a bank the outlaw rested now, And laid the basket from his back, the bonnet from his brow; And there, his hand upon the Book, his knee upon the sod, He fill'd the lonely valley with the gladsome word of God; And for a persecuted kirk, and for her martyrs dear, And against a godless church and king he spoke up loud and clear. And now upon his homeward way, he cross'd the Collon high, And over bush and bank and brae he sent abroad his eye; But all was darkening peacefully in grey and purple haze, The thrush was silent in the banks, the lark upon the braes— When suddenly shot up a blaze, from the cave's mouth it came; And troopers' steeds and troopers' caps are glancing in the same! He couch'd among the heather, and he saw them, as he lay, With three long yells at parting, ride lightly east away: Then down with heavy heart he came, to sorry cheer came he, For ashes black were crackling where the green whins used to be, And stretch'd among the prickly comb, his heart's blood smoking round, From slender nose to breast-bone cleft, lay dead his good greyhound! “They've slain my dog, the Philistines! they've ta'en my bonny mare!” He plunged into the smoking hole; no bonny beast was there— He groped beneath his burning bed (it burn'd him to the bone,) Where his good weapon used to be, but broadsword there was none; He reel'd out of the stifling den, and sat down on a stone, And in the shadows of the night 'twas thus he made his moan— “I am a houseless outcast: I have neither bed nor board, Nor living thing to look upon, nor comfort save the Lord: Yet many a time were better men in worse extremity; Who succour'd them in their distress, He now will succour me,— He now will succour me, I know; and, by His holy Name, I'll make the doers of this deed right dearly rue the same! “My bonny mare! I've ridden you when Claver'se rode behind, And from the thumbscrew and the boot you bore me like the wind; And, while I have the life you saved, on your sleek flank I swear, Episcopalian rowel shall never ruffle hair! Though sword to wield they've left me none—yet Wallace wight, I wis, Good battle did on Irvine side wi' waur weapon than this.”— His fishing-rod with both his hands he griped it as he spoke, And, where the butt and top were spliced, in pieces twain he broke; The limber top he cast away, with all its gear abroad, But, grasping the thick hickory butt, with spike of iron shod, He ground the sharp spear to a point; then pull'd his bonnet down, And, meditating black revenge, set forth for Carrick town. The sun shines bright on Carrick wall and Carrick Castle grey, And up thine aisle, St. Nicholas, has ta'en his morning way, And to the North-Gate sentinel displayeth far and near Sea, hill, and tower, and all thereon, in dewy freshness clear, Save where, behind a ruin'd wall, himself alone to view, Is peering from the ivy green a bonnet of the blue. The sun shines red on Carrick wall and Carrick Castle old, And all the western buttresses have changed their grey for gold; And from thy shrine, Saint Nicholas, the pilgrim of the sky Has gone in rich farewell, as fits such royal votary; But, as his last red glance he takes down past black Slieve-a-true, He leaveth where he found it first, the bonnet of the blue. Again he makes the turrets grey stand out before the hill; Constant as their foundation rock, there is the bonnet still! And now the gates are open'd, and forth in gallant show Prick jeering grooms and burghers blythe, and troopers in a row; But one has little care for jest, so hard bested is he, To ride the outlaw's bonny mare, for this at last is she! Down comes her master with a roar, her rider with a groan, The iron and the hickory are through and through him gone! He lies a corpse; and where he sat, the outlaw sits again, And once more to his bonny mare he gives the spur and rein; Then some with sword, and some with gun, they ride and run amain! But sword and gun, and whip and spur, that day they plied in vain! Ah! little thought Willy Gilliland, when he on Skerry side Drew bridle first, and wiped his brow after that weary ride, That where he lay like hunted brute, a cavern'd outlaw lone, Broad lands and yeoman tenantry should yet be there his own: Yet so it was; and still from him descendants not a few Draw birth and lands, and, let me trust, draw love of Freedom too. THE FORGING OF THE ANCHOR. Come, see the Dolphin's anchor forged—'tis at a white heat now: The bellows ceased, the flames decreased—though on the forge's brow The little flames still fitfully play through the sable mound, And fitfully you still may see the grim smiths ranking round, All clad in leathern panoply, their broad hands only bare: Some rest upon their sledges here, some work the windlass there. The windlass strains the tackle chains, the black mound heaves below, And red and deep a hundred veins burst out at every throe: It rises, roars, rends all outright—O, Vulcan, what a glow! 'Tis blinding white, 'tis blasting bright—the high sun shines not so! The high sun sees not, on the earth, such fiery fearful show, The roof-ribs swarth, the candent hearth, the ruddy lurid row Of smiths that stand, an ardent band, like men before the foe, As, quivering through his fleece of flame, the sailing monster, slow Sinks on the anvil:—all about the faces fiery grow; “Hurrah!” they shout “leap out—leap out;” bang, bang the sledges go: Hurrah! the jetted lightnings are hissing high and low— A hailing fount of fire is struck at every squashing blow; The leathern mail rebounds the hail, the rattling cinders strow The ground around; at every bound the sweltering fountains flow, And thick and loud the swinking crowd at every stroke pant “ho!” Leap out, leap out, my masters: leap out and lay on load! Let's forge a goodly anchor—a bower thick and broad; For a heart of oak is hanging on every blow, I bode; I see the good ship riding all in a perilous road— The low reef roaring on her lee—the roll of ocean pour'd From stem to stern, sea after sea, the mainmast by the board, The bulwarks down, the rudder gone, the boats stove at the chains! But courage still, brave mariners—the bower yet remains, And not an inch to flinch he deigns, save when ye pitch sky high; Then moves his head, as though he said “Fear nothing—here am I.” Swing in your strokes in order, let foot and hand keep time; Your blows make music sweeter far than any steeple's chime; But, while you sling your sledges, sing—and let the burthen be, The anchor is the anvil-king, and royal craftsmen we! Strike in, strike in—the sparks begin to dull their rustling red; Our hammers ring with sharper din, our work will soon be sped. Our anchor soon must change his bed of fiery rich array, For a hammock at the roaring bows, or an oozy couch of clay; Our anchor soon must change the lay of merry craftsmen here, For the yeo-heave-o', and the heave away, and the sighing seaman's cheer; When, weighing slow, at eve they go—far, far from love and home; And sobbing sweethearts, in a row, wail o'er the ocean foam. In livid and obdurate gloom he darkens down at last: A shapely one he is, and strong, as e'er from cat was cast: O trusted and trustworthy guard, if thou hadst life like me, What pleasures would thy toils reward beneath the deep green sea! O deep-Sea-diver, who might then behold such sights as thou? The hoary monster's palaces! methinks what joy 'twere now To go plumb plunging down amid the assembly of the whales, And feel the churn'd sea round me boil beneath their scourging tails! Then deep in tangle-woods to fight the fierce sea unicorn, And send him foil'd and bellowing back, for all his ivory horn: To leave the subtle sworder-fish of bony blade forlorn; And for the ghastly-grinning shark, to laugh his jaws to scorn: To leap down on the kraken's back, where 'mid Norwegian isles He lies, a lubber anchorage for sudden shallow'd miles; Till snorting, like an under-sea volcano, off he rolls; Meanwhile to swing, a-buffeting the far astonished shoals Of his back-browsing ocean-calves; or, haply, in a cove, Shell-strown, and consecrate of old to some Undiné's love, To find the long-hair'd mermaidens; or, hard by icy lands, To wrestle with the Sea-serpent, upon cerulean sands. O broad-arm'd Fisher of the deep, whose sports can equal thine? The Dolphin weighs a thousand tons, that tugs thy cable line; And night by night, 'tis thy delight, thy glory day by day, Through sable sea and breaker white the giant game to play— But shamer of our little sports! forgive the name I gave— A fisher's joy is to destroy—thine office is to save. O lodger in the sea-kings' halls, couldst thou but understand Whose be the white bones by thy side, or who that dripping band, Slow swaying in the heaving wave, that round about thee bend, With sounds like breakers in a dream blessing their ancient friend— Oh, couldst thou know what heroes glide with larger steps round thee, Thine iron side would swell with pride; thou'dst leap within the sea! Give honour to their memories who left the pleasant strand, To shed their blood so freely for the love of Fatherland— Who left their chance of quiet age and grassy churchyard grave, So freely, for a restless bed amid the tossing wave— Oh, though our anchor may not be all I have fondly sung, Honour him for their memory, whose bones he goes among! THE FORESTER'S COMPLAINT. Through our wild wood-walks here, Sunbright and shady, Free as the forest deer, Roams a lone lady: Far from her castle-keep, Down in the valley, Roams she, by dingle deep, Green holm and alley, With her sweet presence bright Gladd'ning my dwelling— Oh, fair her face of light, Past the tongue's telling! Woe was me E'er to see Beauty so shining; Ever since, hourly, Have I been pining! In our blithe sports' debates Down by the river, I, of my merry mates, Foremost was ever; Skilfullest with my flute, Leading the maidens Heark'ning, by moonlight, mute, To its sweet cadence: Sprightliest in the dance Tripping together— Such a one was I once Ere she came hither! Woe was me E'er to see Beauty so shining; Ever since, hourly, Have I been pining! Loud now my comrades laugh As I pass by them; Broadsword and quarter-staff No more I ply them: Coy now the maidens frown Wanting their dances; How can their faces brown Win one, who fancies Even an angel's face Dark to be seen would Be, by the Lily-grace Gladd'ning the green wood? Woe was me E'er to see Beauty so shining; Ever since, hourly, Have I been pining! Wolf, by my broken bow Idle is lying, While through the woods I go, All the day, sighing, Tracing her footsteps small Through the moss'd cover, Hiding then, breathless all, At the sight of her, Lest my rude gazing should From her haunt scare her— Oh, what a solitude Wanting her, there were! Woe was me E'er to see Beauty so shining; Ever since, hourly, Have I been pining! THE PRETTY GIRL OF LOCH DAN. The shades of eve had cross'd the glen That frowns o'er infant Avonmore, When, nigh Loch Dan, two weary men, We stopp'd before a cottage door. “God save all here,” my comrade cries, And rattles on the raised latch-pin; “God save you kindly,” quick replies A clear sweet voice, and asks us in. We enter; from the wheel she starts, A rosy girl with soft black eyes; Her fluttering court'sy takes our hearts, Her blushing grace and pleased surprise. Poor Mary, she was quite alone, For, all the way to Glenmalure, Her mother had that morning gone And left the house in charge with her. But neither household cares, nor yet The shame that startled virgins feel, Could make the generous girl forget Her wonted hospitable zeal. She brought us in a beechen bowl Sweet milk that smack'd of mountain thyme, Oat cake, and such a yellow roll Of butter—it gilds all my rhyme! And, while we ate the grateful food, (With weary limbs on bench reclined,) Considerate and discreet, she stood Apart, and listen'd to the wind. Kind wishes both our souls engaged, From breast to breast spontaneous ran The mutual thought—we stood and pledged The Modest Rose above Loch Dan. “The milk we drink is not more pure, Sweet Mary—bless those budding charms! Than your own generous heart, I'm sure, Nor whiter than the breast it warms!” She turn'd and gazed, unused to hear Such language in that homely glen; But, Mary, you have nought to fear, Though smiled on by two stranger men. Not for a crown would I alarm Your virgin pride by word or sign, Nor need a painful blush disarm My friend of thoughts as pure as mine. Her simple heart could not but feel The words we spoke were free from guile; She stoop'd, she blush'd—she fixed her wheel, 'Tis all in vain—she can't but smile! Just like sweet April's dawn appears Her modest face—I see it yet— And though I lived a hundred years, Methinks I never could forget The pleasure that, despite her heart, Fills all her downcast eyes with light, The lips reluctantly apart, The white teeth struggling into sight, The dimples eddying o'er her cheek,— The rosy cheek that won't be still!— Oh! who could blame what flatterers speak, Did smiles like this reward their skill? For such another smile, I vow, Though loudly beats the midnight rain, I'd take the mountain-side e'en now, And walk to Luggelaw again! HUNGARY. AUGUST 1849. Away! would you own the dread rapture of war. Seek the host-rolling plain of the mighty Magyar; Where the giants of yore from their mansions come down, O'er the ocean-wide floor play the game of renown. Hark! hark! how the earth 'neath their armament reels, In the hurricane charge—in the thunder of wheels; How the hearts of the forests rebound as they pass, In their mantle of smoke, through the quaking morass! God! the battle is join'd! Lord Sabaoth, rejoice! Freedom thunders her hymn in the battery's voice— In the soaring hurrah—in the blood-stifled moan— Sends the voice of her praise to the foot of thy throne. Oh hear, God of freedom, thy people's appeal; Let the edges of slaughter be sharp as their steel, And the weight of destruction and swiftness of fear, Speed death to his mark in their bullets' career! Holy nature, arise! from thy bosom in wrath Shake the pestilence forth on the enemy's path, That the tyrant invaders may march by the road Of Sennacherib invading the city of God! As the stars in their courses 'gainst Sisera strove, Fight, mists of the fens, in the sick air above; As Scamander his carcasses flung on the foe, Fight, floods of the Theiss, in your torrents below! As the snail of the Psalmist consuming away, Let the moon-melted masses in silence decay; Till the track of corruption alone in the air Shall tell sicken'd Europe the Scythian was there! Stay! stay!—in thy fervour of sympathy pause, Nor become inhumane in humanity's cause; If the poor Russian slave have to wrong been abused, Are the ties of Christ's brotherhood all to be loosed? The mothers of Moscow who offer the breast To their orphans, have hearts, as the mothers of Pest; Nor are love's aspirations more tenderly drawn From the bosoms of youth by the Theiss than the Don. God of Russian and Magyar, who ne'er hast design'd Save one shedding of blood for the sins of mankind, No demon of battle and bloodshed art thou, To the war-wearied nations be pitiful now! Turn the hearts of the kings—let the Magyar again Reap the harvest of peace on his bountiful plain; And if not with renown, with affections and lives, Send the driven serfs home to their children and wives!— But you fill all my bosom with tumult once more— What! Görgey surrender'd! What! Bem's battles o'er! What! Haynau victorious!—Inscrutable God! We must wonder, and worship, and bow to thy rod. ADIEU TO BRITTANY. Rugged land of the granite and oak, I depart with a sigh from thy shore, And with kinsman's affection a blessing invoke On the maids and the men of Arvôr. For the Irish and Breton are kin, Though the lights of Antiquity pale In the point of the dawn where the partings begin Of the Bolg, and the Kymro, and Gael. But, though dim in the distance of time Be the low-burning beacons of fame, Holy Nature attests us, in writing sublime On heart and on visage, the same. In the dark-eye-lash'd eye of blue-grey, In the open look, modest and kind, In the face's fine oval reflecting the play Of the sensitive, generous mind, Till, as oft as by meadow and stream With thy Maries and Josephs I roam, In companionship gentle and friendly I seem, As with Patrick and Brigid at home. Green, meadow-fresh, streamy-bright land! Though greener meads, valleys as fair, Be at home, yet the home-yearning heart will demand, Are they blest as in Brittany there? Demand not—repining is vain: Yet, would God, that even as thou In thy homeliest homesteads, contented Bretagne, Were the green isle my thoughts are with now! But I call thee not golden: let gold Deck the coronal troubadours twine, Where the waves of the Loire and Garomna are roll'd Through the land of the white wheat and vine, And the fire of the Frenchman goes up To the quick-thoughted, dark-flashing eye: While Glory and Change quaffing Luxury's cup, Challenge all things below and on high. Leave to him—to the vehement man Of the Loire, of the Seine, of the Rhone,— In Idea's high pathway to march in the van, To o'erthrow, and set up the o'erthrown: Be it thine in the broad beaten ways That the world's simple seniors have trod, To walk with soft steps, living peaceable days, And on earth not forgetful of God. Nor repine that thy lot has been cast With the things of the old time before, For to thee are committed the keys of the past, Oh grey monumental Arvôr! Yes, land of the great Standing Stones, It is thine at thy feet to survey, From thy earlier shepherd-kings' sepulchre-thrones The giant, far-stretching array; Where, abroad o'er the gorse-cover'd lande Where, along by the slow-breaking wave, The hoary, inscrutable sentinels stand In their night-watch by History's grave. Preserve them, nor fear for thy charge; From the prime of the morning they sprung, When the works of young Mankind were lasting and large, As the will they embodied was young. I have stood on Old Sarum: Sorbiodunum, i. e. Service-tree-fort. the sun, With a pensive regard from the west, Lit the beech-tops low down in the ditch of the Dun, Lit the service-trees high on its crest: But the walls of the Roman were shrunk Into morsels of ruin around, And palace of monarch, and minster of monk, Were effaced from the grassy-foss'd ground. Like bubbles in ocean, they melt, O Wilts, on thy long-rolling plain, And at last but the works of the hand of the Celt And the sweet hand of Nature remain. Even so: though, portentous and strange, With a rumour of troublesome sounds, On his iron way gliding, the Angel of Change Spread his dusky wings wide o'er thy bounds,— He will pass: there'll be grass on his track, And the pick of the miner in vain Shall search the dark void: while the stones of Carnac And the word of the Breton remain. Farewell: up the waves of the Rance, See, we stream back our pennon of smoke; Farewell, russet skirt of the fine robe of France, Rugged land of the granite and oak! WESTMINSTER ABBEY. ON HEARING WEEK-DAY SERVICE THERE, SEPTEMBER, 1856. From England's gilded halls of state I cross'd the Western Minster's gate, And, 'mid the tombs of England's dead, I heard the Holy Scriptures read. The walls around and pillar'd piers Had stood well-nigh seven hundred years; The words the priest gave forth had stood Since Christ, and since before the Flood. A thousand hearts around partook The comfort of the Holy Book; Ten thousand suppliant hands were spread In lifted stone above my head. In dust decay'd the hands are gone That fed and set the builders on; In heedless dust the fingers lie That hew'd and heav'd the stones on high; And back to earth and air resolv'd The brain that plann'd and pois'd the vault:— But undecay'd, erect, and fair, To heaven ascends the builded Prayer, With majesty of strength and size, With glory of harmonious dyes, With holy airs of heavenward thought From floor to roof divinely fraught. Fall down, ye bars: enlarge, my soul! To heart's content take in the whole; And, spurning pride's injurious thrall, With loyal love embrace them all! Yet hold not lightly home; nor yet The graves on Dunagore forget; Nor grudge the stone-gilt stall to change For humble bench of Gorman's Grange. The self-same Word bestows its cheer On simple creatures there as here; And thence, as hence, poor souls do rise In social flight to common skies. For in the Presence vast and good, That bends o'er all our livelihood, With humankind in heavenly cure, We all are like, we all are poor. His poor, be sure, shall never want For service meet or seemly chant, And for the Gospel's joyful sound A fitting place shall still be found; Whether the organ's solemn tones Thrill through the dust of warriors' bones, Or voices of the village choir From swallow-haunted eaves aspire, Or, sped with healing on its wings, The Word solicit ears of kings, Or stir the souls, in moorland glen, Of kingless covenanted men. Enough for thee, indulgent Lord, The willing ear to hear Thy Word— The rising of the burthen'd breast— And Thou suppliest all the rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VERSIONS AND ADAPTATIONS. THE ORIGIN OF THE SCYTHIANS. HERODOTUS (“MELPOMENE”). When, o'er Riphæan wastes the son of Jove Slain Geryon's beeves from Erytheia drove, Sharp nipp'd the frost, and feathery whirls of snow Fill'd upper air and hid the earth below. The hero on the ground, his steeds beside, Spread, shaggy-huge, the dun Nemean hide, And, warmly folded, while the tempest swept The dreary Hyperborean desert, slept. When Hercules awoke and look'd around, The milk-white mares were nowhere to be found. Long search'd the hero all the neighbouring plain, The brakes and thickets; but he search'd in vain. At length he reach'd a gloomy cave, and there He found a woman as a goddess fair; A perfect woman downward to the knee, But all below, a snake, in coil'd deformity. With mutual wonder each the other eyed: He question'd of his steeds, and she replied:— “Hero, thy steeds within my secret halls Are safely stabled in enchanted stalls; But if thou thence my captives wouldst remove, Thou, captive too, must yield me love for love.” Won by the price, perchance by passion sway'd, Alcides yielded to the monster maid. The steeds recover'd, and the burnish'd car Prepared, she said,—“Remember, when afar, That, sprung from thee, three mighty sons shall prove Me not unworthy of a hero's love. But when my babes are grown to manhood, where Would'st thou thy sons should seek a father's care?” The soft appeal e'en stern Alcides felt:— And, “Take,” he said, “this bow and glittering belt:”— From his broad breast the baldrick he unslung, (A golden phial from its buckle hung;) “And, when my sons are grown to man's estate, Him whom thou first shalt see decline the weight Of the great belt or fail the bow to bend, To Theban Hercules, his father, send For tutelage; but him whom thou shalt see Thus bear the belt, thus bend the bow, like me, Nought further needing by thy side retain, The destined monarch of the northern plain.” He went: the mighty mother, at a birth, Gave Gelon, Agathyrs and Scyth In Celtic tradition, the progenitors of the Firbolgs, Picts and Scots respectively. to earth. To early manhood grown, the former twain Essay'd to bear the belt and bow in vain; And, southward banish'd from their mother's face, Sought lighter labours in the fields of Thrace: While, far refulgent over plain and wood, Herculean Scyth the glittering belt indued, And, striding dreadful on his fields of snow, With aim unerring twang'd his father's bow. From him derived the illustrious Scythian name, And all the race of Scythian monarchs came. THE DEATH OF DERMID. IRISH ROMANCE. INTRODUCTORY NOTE. King cormac had affianced his daughter Grania to Finn, son of Comhal, the Finn Mac Coole of Irish, and Fingal of Scottish tradition. In addition to his war-like accomplishments, Finn was reported to have obtained the gifts of poetry, second-sight, and healing in the manner referred to below. On his personal introduction, his age and aspect proved displeasing to Grania, who threw herself on the gallantry of Dermid, the handsomest of Finn's attendant warriors, and induced him reluctantly to fly with her. Their pursuit by Finn forms the subject of one of the most popular native Irish romances. In the course of their wanderings, Dermid, having pursued a wild boar, met the fate of Adonis, who appears to have been his prototype in Celtic imagination. Finn, arriving on the scene just before his rival's death, gives occasion to the most pathetic passage of the tale, which, at this point, is comparatively free from the characteristics of vulgarity and extravagance attaching to the rest of the composition. The incidents of the original are followed in the piece below, which, however, does not profess to be a translation. The original may be perused in the spirited version of Mr. O'Grady,—“Publications of the Irish Ossianic Society,” vol. iii. p. 185. It is from this Dermid that Highland tradition draws the genealogy of the clan Campbell,— “The race of brown Dermid who slew the wild boar.” Finn on the mountain found the mangled man, The slain boar by him. “Dermid,” said the king, “It likes me well at last to see thee thus. This only grieves me, that the womankind Of Erin are not also looking on: Such sight were wholesome for the wanton eyes So oft enamour'd of that specious form: Beauty to foulness, strength to weakness turn'd.” “Yet in thy power, if only in thy will, Lies it, oh Finn, even yet to heal me.” “How?” “Feign not the show of ignorance, nor deem I know not of the virtues which thy hand Drew from that fairy's half-discover'd hall, Who bore her silver tankard from the fount, So closely follow'd, that ere yet the door Could close upon her steps, one arm was in; Wherewith, though seeing nought, yet touching all, Thou grasped'st half the spiritual world; With drawing a heap'd handful of its gifts,— Healing, and sight prophetic, and the power Divine of poesy: but healing most Abides within its hollow:—virtue such That but so much of water as might wet These lips, in that hand brought, would make me whole. Finn, from the fountain fetch me in thy palms A draught of water and I yet shall live.” “How at these hands canst thou demand thy life, Who took'st my joy of life?” “She loved thee not: Me she did love and doth; and were she here She would so plead with thee that, for her sake, Thou wouldst forgive us both and bid me live.” “I was a man had spent my prime of years In war and council, little bless'd with love; Though poesy was mine, and, in my hour, The seer's burthen not desirable; And now at last had thought to have man's share Of marriage blessings; and the King supreme, Cormac, had pledged his only daughter mine; When thou, with those pernicious beauty-gifts, The flashing white tusk there hath somewhat spoil'd, Didst win her to desert her father's house, And roam the wilds with thee.” “It was herself, Grania, the Princess, put me in the bonds Of holy chivalry to share her flight. ‘Behold,’ she said, ‘he is an aged man, (And so thou art, for years will come to all;) And I, so young; and, at the Beltane games, When Carbry Liffacher did play the men Of Brea, I, unseen, saw thee snatch a hurl, And thrice on Tara's champions “On Tara's champions,” ar ghasra Teamhrach. The idiom is preserved. win the goal; And gave thee love that day, and still will give.’ So she herself avow'd. Resolve me, Finn, For thou art just, could youthful warrior, sworn To maiden's service have done else than I? No: hate me not—restore me—give me drink.” “I will not.” “Nay, but, Finn, thou hadst not said ‘I will not,’, though I'd ask'd a greater boon, That night we supp'd in Breendacoga's lodge. Remember: we were faint and hunger-starved From three day's flight; and even as on the board They placed the viands, and my hand went forth To raise the wine-cup, thou; more quick of ear, O erheard'st the stealthy leaguer set without; And yet should'st eat or perish. Then 'twas I, Fasting, that made the sally; and 'twas I, Fasting, that made the circuit of the court; Three times I cours'd it, darkling, round and round; From whence returning, when I brought thee in The three lopp'd heads of them that lurk'd without— Thou hadst not then, refresh'd and grateful, said ‘I will not,’ had I ask'd thee, ‘Give me drink.’” “There springs no water on this summit bald.” “Nine paces from the spot thou standest on, The well-eye—well thou knowest it—bubbles clear.” Abash'd, reluctant, to the bubbling well Went Finn, and scoop'd the water in his palms; Where with returning, half-way, came the thought Of Grania, and he let the water spill. “Ah me,” said Dermid, “hast thou then forgot Thy warrior-art that oft, when helms were split, And buckler-bosses shatter'd by the spear, Has satisfied the thirst of wounded men? Ah, Finn, these hands of thine were not so slack That night, when, captured by the king of Thule, Thou layest in bonds within the temple gate Waiting for morning, till the observant king Should to his sun-god make thee sacrifice. Close-pack'd thy fingers then, thong-drawn and squeezed, The blood-drops oozing under every nail, When, like a shadow, through the sleeping priests Came I, and loos'd thee: and the hierophant At day-dawn coming, on the altar-step, Instead of victim straighten'd to his knife, Two warriors found, erect, for battle arm'd.” Again abash'd, reluctant to the well Went Finn, and scoop'd the water in his palms, Where with returning, half-way, came the thought That wrench'd him; and the shaken water spill'd. “False one, thou didst it purposely! I swear I saw thee, though mine eyes do fast grow dim. Ah me, how much imperfect still is man! Yet such were not the act of Him, whom once On this same mountain, as we sat at eve— Thou yet mayst see the knoll that was our couch, A stone's throw from the spot where now I lie— Thou showedst me, shuddering, when the seer's fit, Sadden and cold as hail, assail'd thy soul In vision of that Just One crucified For all men's pardoning, which, once again, Thou sawest, with Cormac, struck in Rossnaree.” Finn trembled: and a third time to the well Went straight, and scoop'd the water in his palms; Where with in haste half-way return'd, he saw A smile on Dermid's face relax'd in death. THE INVOCATION. LUCRETIUS. Joy of the world, divine delight of Love, Who with life-sowing footsteps soft dost move Through all the still stars from their sliding stands See, fishy seas, and fruit-abounding lands; Bringing to presence of the gracious sun All living things: thee blights and vapours shun, And thine advent: for thee the various earth Glows with the rose; for thee the murmurous minth Of ocean sparkles; and, at thy repair, Diffusive bliss pervades the placid air. For, see, forthwith the blandness of the Spring Begins, and Zephyr's seasonable wing Wantons abroad in primal lustihood, Smit with sweet pangs the wing'd aerial brood Of pairing birds proclaim thy reign begun; Thence through the fields where pasturing cattle run, Runs the soft frenzy, all the savage kind, Touch'd with thy tremors in the wanton wind, Prancing the plains, or through the rushing floods Cleaving swift ways; thou, who through waving woods, Tall mountains, fishful seas, and leafy bowers Of nestling birds, keep'st up the joyous hours, Making from age to age, bird, beast, and man Perpetuate life and time;—aid thou my plan. ARCHYTAS AND THE MARINER. HORAT. OD. 1. 28. MARINER. Thee, of the sea and land and unsumm'd sand The Mensurator, The dearth of some poor earth from a friend's hand Detains, a waiter For sepulture, here on the Matine strand; Nor aught the better Art thou, Archytas, now, in thought to have spann'd Pole and equator! ARCHYTAS, The sire of Pelops, too, though guest and host Of Gods, gave up the ghost: Beloved Tithonus into air withdrew: And Minos, at the council-board of Jove Once intimate above, Hell holds; and hell with strict embrace anew Constrains Panthoïdes, for all his lore, Though by the shield he bore In Trojan jousts, snatch'd from the trophied fane He testified that death slays nought within The man, but nerve and skin; But bore his witness and his shield in vain. For one night waits us all; one downward road Must by all feet be trod: All heads at last to Proserpine must come: The furious Fates to Mars' bloody shows Cast these: the seas whelm those: Commix'd and close the young and old troop home. Me also, prone Orion's comrade swift, The South-wind, in the drift. Of white Illyrian waves, caught from the day: But, shipmate, thou refuse not to my dead Bones and unburied head, The cheap poor tribute of the funeral clay! So, whatsoe'er the East may foam or roar Against the Hesperian shore, Let crack Venusia's woods, thou safe and free; While great God Neptune, the Tarentine's trust, And Jupiter the just, With confluent wealth reward thy piety. Ah! wouldst thou leave me? wouldst thou leave, indeed, Thy unoffending seed Under the dead man's curse? Beware! the day May come when thou shalt suffer equal wrong: Give—'twill not keep thee long— Three handfuls of sea-sand, and go thy way.</field>

My heart is in woe, And my soul deep in trouble,— For the mighty are low, And abased are the noble: The Sons of the Gael Are in exile and mourning, Worn, weary, and pale, As spent pilgrims returning; Or men who, in flight From the field of disaster, Beseech the black night On their flight to fall faster; Or seamen aghast When their planks gape asunder, And the waves fierce and fast Tumble through in hoarse thunder; Or men whom we see That have got their death-omen— Such wretches are we In the chains of our foemen! Our courage is fear, Our nobility vileness, Our hope is despair, And our comeliness foulness. There is mist on our heads, And a cloud chill and hoary Of black sorrow, sheds An eclipse on our glory, From Boyne to the Linn Has the mandate been given, That the children of Finn From their country be driven. That the sons of the king— Oh, the treason and malice!— Shall no more ride the ring In their own native valleys; No more shall repair Where the hill foxes tarry, Nor forth to the air Fling the hawk at her quarry: For the plain shall be broke By the share of the stranger, And the stone-mason's stroke Tell the woods of their danger; The green hills and shore Be with white keeps disfigured, And the Moat of Rathmore Be the Saxon churl's haggard! The land of the lakes Shall no more know the prospect Of valleys and brakes— So transform'd is her aspect! The Gael cannot tell, In the uprooted wild-wood And red ridgy dell, The old nurse of his childhood: The nurse of his youth Is in doubt as she views him, If the wan wretch, in truth, Be the child of her bosom. We starve by the board, And we thirst amid wassail— For the guest is the lord, And the host is the vassal! Through the woods let us roam, Through the wastes wild and barren; We are strangers at home! We are exiles in Erin! And Erin's a bark O'er the wide waters driven! And the tempest howls dark, And her side planks are riven! And in billows of might Swell the Saxon before her,— Unite, oh, unite! Or the billows burst o'er her! O'BYRNE'S BARD TO THE CLANS OF WICKLOW. Cir. 1580. God be with the Irish host, Never be their battle lost! For, in battle, never yet Have they basely earn'd defeat. Host of armour red and bright. May ye fight a valiant fight For the green spot of the earth, For the land that gave you birth. Who in Erin's cause would stand, Brothers of the avenging band, He must wed immortal quarrel, Pain and sweat and bloody peril. On the mountain bare and steep, Snatching short but pleasant sleep, Then, ere sunrise, from his eyrie, Swooping on the Saxon quarry. What although you've fail'd to keep Liffey's plain or Tara's steep, Cashel's pleasant streams to save, Or the meads of Croghan Maev; Want of conduct lost the town, Broke the white-wall'd castle down, Moira lost, and old Taltin, And let the conquering stranger in. 'Twas the want of right command, Not the lack of heart or hand, Left your hills and plains to-day 'Neath the strong Clan Saxon's sway. Ah, had heaven never sent Discord for our punishment, Triumphs few o'er Erin's host Had Clan London now to boast! Woe is me, 'tis God's decree Strangers have the victory: Irishmen may now be found Outlaws upon Irish ground. Like a wild beast in his den Lies the chief by hill and glen, While the strangers, proud and savage, Criffan's richest valleys ravage. Woe is me, the foul offence, Treachery and violence, Done against my people's rights— Well may mine be restless nights! When old Leinster's sons of fame, Heads of many a warlike name, Redden their victorious hilts On the Gaul, my soul exults. When the grim Gaul, who have come Hither o'er the ocean foam, From the fight victorious go, Then my heart sinks deadly low. Bless the blades our warriors draw, God be with Clan Ranelagh! But my soul is weak for fear, Thinking of their danger here. Have them in thy holy keeping, God be with them lying sleeping, God be with them standing fighting, Erin's foes in battle smiting! LAMENT OVER THE RUINS OF THE ABBEY OF TIMOLEAGUE. JOHN COLLINS, died, 1816. Lone and weary as I wander'd By the bleak shore of the sea, Meditating and reflecting On the world's hard destiny; Forth the moon and stars 'gan glimmer, In the quiet tide beneath,— For on slumbering spray and blossom Breathed not out of heaven a breath. On I went in sad dejection, Careless where my footsteps bore, Till a ruin'd church before me Open'd wido its ancient door,— Till I stood before the portals, Where of old were wont to be, For the blind, the halt, and leper, Alms and hospitality. Still the ancient seat was standing, Built against the buttress grey, Where the clergy used to welcome Weary travellers on their way. There I sat me down in sadness, 'Neath my cheek I placed my hand, Till the tears fell hot and briny Down upon the grassy land. There, I said in woeful sorrow, Weeping bitterly the while, Was a time when joy and gladness Reign'd within this ruin'd pile;— Was a time when bells were tinkling, Clergy preaching peace abroad, Psalms a-singing, music ringing Praises to the mighty God. Empty aisle, deserted chancel, Tower tottering to your fall, Many a storm since then has beaten On the grey head of your wall! Many a bitter storm and tempest Has your roof-tree turn'd away, Since you first were form'd a temple To the Lord of night and day. Holy house of ivied gables, That wert once the country's pride, Houseless now in weary wandering Roam your inmates far and wide. Lone you are to-day, and dismal,— Joyful psalms no more are heard Where, within your choir, her vesper Screeches the cat-headed bird. Ivy from your eaves is growing, Nettles round your green hearth-stone, Foxes howl, where, in your corners, Dropping waters make their moan. Where the lark to early matins Used your clergy forth to call, There, alas! no tongue is stirring, Save the daw's upon the wall. Refectory cold and empty, Dormitory bleak and bare, Where are now your pious uses, Simple bed and frugal fare? Gone your abbot, rule and order, Broken down your altar stones; Nought see I beneath your shelter. Save a heap of clayey bones. Oh! the hardship, oh! the hatred, Tyranny, and cruel war, Persecution and oppression, That have left you as you are! I myself once also prosper'd;— Mine is, too, an alter'd plight; Trouble, care, and age have left me Good for nought but grief to-night Gone, my motion and my vigour,— Gone, the use of eye and ear; At my feet lie friends and children, Powerless and corrupting here: Woe is written on my visage, In a nut my heart would lie— Death's deliverance were welcome— Father, let the old man die. TO THE HARPER O'CONNELLAN. Enchanter who reignest Supreme o'er the North, Who hast wiled the coy spirit Of true music forth; In vain Europe's minstrels To honour aspire, When thy swift slender fingers Go forth on the wire! There is no heart's desire Can be felt by a king, That thy hand cannot match From the soul of the string, By its conquering, capturing, Magical sway, For, charmer, thou stealest Thy notes from a fay! Enchanter, I say,— For thy magical skill Can soothe every sorrow, And heal every ill: Who hear thee they praise thee; They weep while they praise; For, charmer, from Fairyland Fresh are thy lays! GRACE NUGENT. CAROLAN. Brightest blossom of the Spring, Grace, the sprightly girl I sing: Grace, who bore the palm of mind From all the rest of womankind. Whomsoe'er the fates decree, Happy fate! for life to be Day and night my Coolun near, Ache or pain need never fear! Her neck outdoes the stately swan, Her radiant face the summer dawn: Ah, happy thrice the youth for whom The fates design that branch of bloom! Pleasant are your words benign, Rich those azure eyes of thine: Ye who see my queen, beware Those twisted links of golden hair! This is what I fain would say To the bird-voiced lady gay,— Never yet conceived the heart Joy which Grace cannot impart: Fold of jewels! case of pearls! Coolun of the circling curls! More I say not, but no less Drink you health and happiness! MILD MABEL KELLY. CAROLAN. Whoever the youth who by Heaven's decree Has his happy right hand 'neath that bright head of thine, 'Tis certain that he From all sorrow is free Till the day of his death, if a life so divine Should not raise him in bliss above mortal degree: Mild Mabel-ni-Kelly, bright Coolun of curls, All stately and pure as the swan on the lake; Her mouth of white teeth is a palace of pearls, And the youth of the land are love-sick for her sake! No strain of the sweetest e'er heard in the land That she knows not to sing, in a voice so enchanting, That the cranes on the strand Fall asleep where they stand; Oh, for her blooms the rose, and the lily ne'er wanting To shed its mild radiance o'er bosom or hand: The dewy blue blossom that hangs on the spray, More blue than her eye, human eye never saw, Deceit never lurk'd in its beautiful ray,— Dear lady, I drink to you, slainte go bragh! THE CUP OF O'HARA. CAROLAN. Were I west in green Arran, Or south in Glanmore, Where the longships come laden With claret in store; Yet I'd rather than shiploads Of claret, and ships, Have your white cup, O'Hara, Up full at my lips. But why seek in numbers Its virtues to tell, When O'Hara's own chaplain Has said, saying well,— “Turlogh, Turlogh Carolan, the composer. bold son of Brian, Sit ye down, boy, again, Till we drain the great cupaun In another health to Keane.” Keane O'Hara, the patron. THE FAIR HAIR'D GIRL. IRISH SONG. The sun has set, the stars are still, The red moon hides behind the hill; The tide has left the brown beach bare, The birds have fled the upper air; Upon her branch the lone cuckoo Is chaunting still her sad adieu; And you, my fair hair'd girl, must go Across the salt-sea under woe! I through love have learn'd three things, Sorrow, sin and death it brings; Yet day by day my heart within Dares shame and sorrow, death and sin: Maiden, you have aim'd the dart Rankling in my ruin'd heart: Maiden, may the God above Grant you grace to grant me love! Sweeter than the viol's string, And the notes that blackbirds sing; Brighter than the dewdrops rare Is the maiden wondrous fair: Like the silver swans at play Is her neck, as bright as day! Woe is me, that e'er my sight Dwelt on charms so deadly bright! PASTHEEN FINN. IRISH RUSTIC SONG. Oh, my fair Pastheen is my heart's delight, Her gay heart laughs in her blue eye bright; Like the apple blossom her bosom white, And her neck like the swan's, on a March morn bright! Then, Oro, come with me! come with me! come The emphasis is on “come.” with me! Oro, come with me! brown girl, sweet! And oh! I would go through snow and sleet, If you would come with me, brown girl, sweet! Love of my heart, my fair Pastheen! Her cheeks are red as the rose's sheen, But my lips have tasted no more, I ween, Than the glass I drank to the health of my queen! Then, Oro, come with me! come with me! come with me! Oro, come with me! brown girl, sweet! And oh! I would go through snow and sleet, If you would come with me, brown girl, sweet! Were I in the town, where's mirth and glee, Or 'twixt two barrels of barley bree, With my fair Pastheen upon my knee, 'Tis I would drink to her pleasantly! Then, Oro, come with me! come with me! come with me! Oro, come with me! brown girl, sweet! And oh! I would go through snow and sleet, If you would come with me, brown girl, sweet! Nine nights I lay in longing and pain, Betwixt two bushes, beneath the rain, Thinking to see you, love, once again; But whistle and call were all in vain! Then, Oro, come with me! come with me! come with me! Oro, come with me! brown girl, sweet! And oh! I would go through snow and sleet, If you would come with me, brown girl, sweet! I'll leave my people, both friend and foe; From all the girls in the world I'll go; But from you, sweetheart, oh, never! oh, no! 'Till I lie in the coffin, stretch'd cold and low! Then, Oro, come with me! come with me! come with me! Oro, come with me! brown girl, sweet! And, oh! I would go through snow and sleet, If you would come with me, brown girl, sweet! MOLLY ASTORE. IRISH SONG. Oh, Mary dear, oh, Mary fair, Oh, branch of generous stem, White blossom of the banks of Nair, Though lilies grow on them! You've left me sick at heart for love, So faint I cannot see, The candle swims the board above, I'm drunk for love of thee! Oh, stately stem of maiden pride, My woe it is, and pain, That I, thus sever'd from thy side, The long night must remain! Through all the towns of Innisfail I've wander'd far and wide; But from Downpatrick to Kinsale, From Carlow to Kilbride, 'Mong lords and dames of high degree, Where'er my feet have gone, My Mary, one to equal thee I've never look'd upon; I live in darkness and in doubt Whene'er my love's away, But, were the blessed sun put out, Her shadow would make day! 'Tis she indeed, young bud of bliss, And gentle as she's fair. Though lily-white her bosom is, And sunny-bright her hair, And dewy-azure her blue eye, And rosy-red her cheek,— Yet brighter she in modesty, More beautifully meek! The world's wise men from north to south Can never cure my pain; But one kiss from her honey mouth Would make me whole again! CASHEL OF MUNSTER. IRISH RUSTIC BALLAD. I'd wed you without herds, without money, or rich array, And I'd wed you on a dewy morning at day dawn grey; My bitter woe it is, love, that we are not far away In Cashel town, though the bare deal board were our marriage-bed this day; Oh, fair maid, remember the green hill side, Remember how I hunted about the valleys wide; Time now, has worn me; my locks are turn'd to grey, The year is scarce and I am poor, but send me not love, away! Oh, deem not my blood is of base strain, my girl, Oh, deem not my birth was as the birth of the churl; Marry me, and prove me, and say soon you will, That noble blood is written on my right side still! My purse holds no red gold, no coin of the silver white, No herds are mine to drive through the long twilight! But the pretty girl that would take me, all bare though I be and lone Oh, I'd take her with me kindly to the county Tyrone. Oh, my girl, I can see 'tis in trouble you are, And, oh, my girl, I see 'tis your people's reproach you bear: “I am a girl in trouble for his sake with whom I fly, And, oh, may no other maiden know such reproach as I!” THE COOLUN. IRISH RUSTIC BALLAD. Oh, had you seen the Coolun, Walking down by the cuckoo's street, With the dew of the meadow shining On her milk-white twinkling feet, My love she is, and my coleen oge, And she dwells in Bal'nagar; And she bears the palm of beauty bright From the fairest that in Erin are. In Bal'nagar is the Coolun, Like the berry on the bough her cheek; Bright beauty dwells for ever On her fair neck and ringlets sleek: Oh, sweeter is her mouth's soft musie Than the lark or thrush at dawn, Or the blackbird in the greenwood singing Farewell to the setting sun. Rise up, my boy! make ready My horse, for I forth would ride, To follow the modest damsel, Where she walks on the green hill side: For, ever since our youth were we plighted, In faith, troth, and wedlock true— She is sweeter to me nine times over Than organ or cuckoo! For, ever since my childhood I loved the fair and darling child; But our people came between us, And with lucre our pure love defiled: Oh, my woe it is, and my bitter pain, And I weep it night and day, That the coleen bawn of my early love Is torn from my heart away. Sweetheart and faithful treasure, Be constant still, and true; Nor for want of herds and houses Leave one who would ne'er leave you: I'll pledge you the blessed Bible, Without and eke within, That the faithful God will provide for us, Without thanks to kith or kin. Oh, love, do you remember When we lay all night alone, Beneath the ash in the winter-storm, When the oak wood round did groan? No shelter then from the blast had we, The bitter blast or sleet, But your gown to wrap about our heads, And my coat round our feet. YOUGHALL HARBOUR, IRISH RUSTIC BALLAD. One Sunday morning, into Youghall walking, I met a maiden upon the way; Her little mouth sweet as fairy music, Her soft cheeks blushing like dawn of day! I laid a bold hand upon her bosom, And ask'd a kiss: but she answer'd, “No: Fair sir, be gentle; do not tear my mantle; 'Tis none in Erin my grief can know. “'Tis but a little hour since I left Youghall. And my love forbade me to return; And now my weary way I wander Into Cappoquin, a poor girl forlorn: Then do not tempt me; for, alas! I dread them Who with tempting proffers teach girls to roam, Who'd first deceive us, then faithless leave us, And send us shame-faced and bare-foot home.” “My heart and hand here! I mean you marriage! I have loved like you and known love's pain; And if you turn back now to Youghall Harbour, You ne'er shall want house or home again: You shall have a lace cap like any lady, Cloak and capuchin, too, to keep you warm, And if God please, maybe, a little baby, By and bye, to nestle within your arm.” CEAN DUBH DEELISH. Pronounced Cawn dhu deelish i.e., dear black head. Put your head, darling, darling, darling, Your darling black head my heart above; Oh, mouth of honey, with the thyme for fragrance, Who, with heart in breast, could deny you love? Oh, many and many a young girl for me is pining, Letting her locks of gold to the cold wind free, For me, the foremost of our gay young fellows; But I'd leave a hundred, pure love, for thee! Then put your head, darling, darling, darling, Your darling black head my heart above; Oh, mouth of honey, with the thyme for fragrance, Who, with heart in breast, could deny you love? BOATMAN'S HYMN. Bark that bear me through foam and squall, You in the storm are my castle wall: Though the sea should redden from bottom to top From tiller to mast she takes no drop; On the tide-top, the tide-top, Wherry aroon, my land and store! On the tide-top, the tide-top, She is the boat can sail go leor. go leor, i.e. abundantly well. She dresses herself, and goes gliding on, Like a dame in her robes of the Indian lawn; For God has bless'd her, gunnel and whale, And oh! if you saw her stretch out to the gale, On the tide-top, the tide-top, &amp;c. Whillan, Whillan, a rock on the shore near Blacksod Harbour. ahoy! old heart of stone, Stooping so black o'er the beach alone, Answer me well—on the bursting brine Saw you ever a bark like mine? On the tide-top, the tide-top, &amp;c. Says Whillan,—“Since first I was made of stone, I have look'd abroad o'er the beach alone— But till to-day, on the bursting brine, Saw I never a bark like thine,” On the tide-top, the tide-top, &amp;c. “God of the air!” the seamen shout, When they see us tossing the brine about: “Give us the shelter of strand or rock, Or through and through us she goes with a shock!” On the tide-top, the tide-top, Wherry aroon, my land and store, On the tide-top, the tide-top, She is the boat can sail go leor! THE DEAR OLD AIR. Misfortune's train may chase our joys, But not our love; And I those pensive looks will prize, The smiles of joy above: Your tender looks of love shall still Delight and console; Even though your eyes the tear-drops fill Beyond your love's control. Of troubles past we will not speak, Or future woe: Nor mark, thus leaning cheek to cheek, The stealing tear-drops flow: But I'll sing you the dear old Irish air, Soothing and low, You loved so well when gay and fair, You won me long ago. THE LAP-FUL OF NUTS. Whene'er I see soft hazel eyes And nut-brown curls, I think of those bright days I spent Among the Limerick girls; When up through Cratla woods I went, Nutting with thee; And we pluck'd the glossy clustering fruit From many a bending tree. Beneath the hazel boughs we sat, Thou, love, and I, And the gather'd nuts lay in thy lap, Beneath thy downcast eye: But little we thought of the store we'd won, I, love, or thou; For our hearts were full, and we dare not own The love that's spoken now. Oh, there's wars for willing hearts in Spain, And high Germanie! And I'll come back, ere long, again, With knightly fame and fee: And I'll come back, if I ever come back, Faithful to thee, That sat with thy white lap full of nuts Beneath the hazel tree. MARY'S WAKING. Soft be the sleep and sweet the dreams, And bright be the awaking, Of mary this mild April morn, On my pale vigil breaking: May weariness and wakefulness And unrepaid endeavour. And aching eyes like mine this day, Be far from her for ever! The quiet of the opening dawn, The freshness of the morning, Be with her through the cheerful day, Till peaceful eve returning Shall put an end to household cares And dutiful employment. And bring the hours of genial mirth And innocent enjoyment. And whether in the virgin choir, A joyous sylph, she dances, Or o'er the smiling circle sheds Her wit's sweet influences; May he by favcuring fate assign'd Her partner or companion, Be one that with an angel's mind Is fit to hold communion. Ah me! the wish is hard to frame! But should some youth, more favour'd Achieve the happiness which I Have fruitlessly endeavour'd, God send them love and length of days, And health and wealth abounding, And long around their hearth to hear Their children's voices sounding! Be still, be still, rebellious heart; If he have fairly won her, To bless their union I am bound In duty and in honour: But, out alas! 'tis all in vain; I love her still too dearly To pray for blessings which I feel So hard to give sincerely. HOPELESS LOVE. Since hopeless of thy love I go, Some little mark of pity show; And only one kind parting look bestow. One parting look of pity mild On him, through starless tempest wild, Who lonely hence to-night must go, exiled. But even rejected love can warm The heart through night and storm: And unrelenting though they be, Thine eyes beam life on me. And I will bear that look benign Within this darkly-troubled breast to shine, Though never, never can thyself, ah me, be mine! THE FAIR HILLS OF IRELAND. OLD IRISH SONG. A plenteous place is Ireland for hospitable cheer, Uileacan dubh O! Where the wholesome fruit is bursting from the yellow barley ear; Uileacan dubh O! There is honey in the trees where her misty vales expand, And her forest paths, in summer, are by falling waters fann'd, There is dew at high noontide there, and springs i'the yellow sand, On the fair hills of holy Ireland. Curl'd he is and ringletted, and plaited to the knee. Uileacan dubh O! Each captain who comes sailing across the Irish sea; Uileacan dubh O! And I will make my journey, if life and health but stand, Unto that pleasant country, that fresh and fragrant strand, And leave your boasted braveries, your wealth and high command, For the fair hills of holy Ireland. Large and profitable are the stacks upon the ground, Uileacan dubh O! The butter and the cream do wondrously abound, Uileacan dubh O! The cresses on the water and the sorrels are at hand, And the cuckoo's calling daily his note of music bland, And the bold thrush sings so bravely his song i'the forests grand, On the fair hills of holy Ireland.</field>
