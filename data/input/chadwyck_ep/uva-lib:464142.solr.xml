      <field name="fulltext">LOVE POEMS 1 A NOCTURNAL LAMENT Alas! so all thinges nowe doe holde their peace: Heauen and earth disturbed in nothing; The beastes, the ayer, the birdes their song doe cease; The nightes chare the starres aboute dothe bring. Calme is the sea, the waues worke lesse and lesse; So am not I, whom loue, alas! doth wring, Bringing before my face the great encrease Of my desires, whereat I wepe and syng, In ioye and wo, as in a doubtful ease: For my swete thoughtes sometyme doe pleasure bring, But, by and by, the cause of my disease Geues me a pang that inwardly dothe sting, When that I thinke what griefe it is againe To liue and lacke the thing should ridde my paine. 2 A SPRING LAMENT The soote season, that bud and blome furth bringes, With grene hath clad the hill and eke the vale; The nightingale with fethers new she singes; The turtle to her make hath tolde her tale. Somer is come, for euery spray nowe springes; The hart hath hong his olde hed on the pale; The buck in brake his winter cote he flings; The fishes flote with newe repaired scale; The adder all her sloughe awaye she slinges; The swift swallow pursueth the flyes smale; The busy bee her honye now she minges. Winter is worne, that was the flowers bale. And thus I see among these pleasant thinges Eche care decayes, and yet my sorow springes. 3 THE CRUELTY OF HIDDEN CHARMS I neuer saw youe, madam, laye aparte Your cornet black, in colde nor yet in heate, Sythe first ye knew of my desire so greate, Which other fances chaced cleane from my harte. Whiles to my self I did the thought reserve That so vnware did wounde my wofull brest, Pytie I saw within your hart dyd rest; But since ye knew I did youe love and serve, Your golden treese was clad alway in blacke, Your smilyng lokes were hid thus euermore, All that withdrawne that I did crave so sore. So doth this cornet governe me, a lacke! In sommere, sonne; in winter, breath of frost; Of your faire eies whereby the light is lost. 4 A LOVERS LOYALTY TO LOVE Love that doth raine and liue within my thought, And buylt his seat within my captyve brest, Clad in the armes wherein with me he fowght, Oft in my face he doth his banner rest. But she that tawght me love and suffre paine, My doubtful hope &amp; eke my hote desire With shamfast looke to shadoo and refrayne, Her smyling grace convertyth streight to yre. And cowarde Love, then, to the hart apace Taketh his flight, where he doth lurke and playne His purpose lost, and dare not shew his face. For my lordes gilt thus fawtles byde I payine; Yet from my lorde shall not my foote remove: Sweet is the death that taketh end by love. 5 LOVES EXTREMES In Cipres springes—wheras dame Venus dwelt— A welle so hote that who so tastes the same, Were he of stone, as thawed yse shuld melt, And kindled fynde his brest with secret flame; Whose moist poison dissolved hath my hate. This creping fier my cold lymmes so oprest That, in the hart that harbred fredom late, Endles dispaire long thraldom hath imprest. One, eke so cold, in froson snow is found, Whose chilling venume of repugnaunt kind The fervent heat doth quenche of Cupides wound, And with the spote of chaunge infectes the mynd; Where of my deer hath tasted to my payne. My service thus is growne into disdayne. 6 A LOVERS VOW Set me wheras the sonne dothe perche the grene, Or whear his beames may not dissolue the ise, In temprat heat, wheare he is felt and sene; With prowde people, in presence sad and wyse; Set me in base, or yet in highe degree; In the long night, or in the shortyst day; In clere weather, or whear mysts thickest be; In lofte yowthe, or when my heares be grey; Set me in earthe, in heauen, or yet in hell; In hill, in dale, or in the fowming floode; Thrawle, or at large, aliue whersoo I dwell; Sike, or in healthe; in yll fame, or in good; Yours will I be, and with that onely thought Comfort my self when that my hape is nowght. 7 THE FRAILTY OF BEAUTY Brittle beautie, that nature made so fraile, Wherof the gift is small, and short the season, Flowring to-day, to morowe apt to faile, Tickell treasure abhorred of reason, Daungerous to dele with, vaine, of none auaile, Costly in keping, past not worthe two peason, Slipper in sliding as is an eles taile, Harde to attaine, once gotten not geason, Iewel of ieopardie that perill doth assaile, False and vntrue, enticed oft to treason, Enmy to youth: that most may I bewaile. Ah, bitter swete! infecting as the poyson, Thou farest as frute that with the frost is taken: To-day redy ripe, to morowe all to shaken. 8 A PLEA FOR CONSTANCY The golden gift that nature did thee geue, To fasten frendes and fede them at thy wyll With fourme and fauour, taught me to beleue How thou art made to shew her greatest skill, Whose hidden vertues are not so vnknown But liuely domes might gather at the first: Where beautye so her perfect seede hath sowen. Of other graces folow nedes there must. Now certesse, ladie, sins all this is true, That from aboue thy gyfts are thus elect, Do not deface them than with fansies newe, Nor chaunge of mindes let not thy minde infect, But mercy him thy frende that doth thee serue, Who seekes alway thine honour to preserue. 9 IN ABSENTIA The fansy which that I haue serued long, That hath alway bene enmy to myne ease, Seemed of late to rue vpon my wrong And bad me flye the cause of my misease. And I forthwith dyd prease out of the throng, That thought by flight my painful hart to please Som other way, tyll I saw faith more strong. And to my self I sayd: “Alas! those dayes In vayn were spent, to runne the race so long.” And with that thought I met my guyde, that playn Out of the way wherin I wandred wrong Brought me amiddes the hylles in base Bullayn; Where I am now, as restlesse to remayn, Against my will, full pleased with my payn. 10 THE TWOFOLD POWER OF LOVE Yf he that erst the fourme so livelye drewe Of Venus faas, tryvmpht in paynteres arte, Thy father then what glorye did ensew, By whose pencell a goddesse made thow arte! Touchid with flame, that figure made some rewe, And with her love surprysed manye a hart; There lackt yet that should cure their hoot desyer: Thow canst enflame and quenche the kyndled fyre. 11 A PLEA FOR MERCY The sonne hath twyse brought forthe the tender grene, And cladd the yerthe in lively lustynes; Ones have the wyndes the trees dispoyled clene, And now agayne begynnes their cruelnes; Sins I have hidd vnder my brest the harme That never shall recover helthfulnes. The wynters hurt recovers with the warme; The perched grene restored is with shade; What warmth, alas! may sarve for to disarme The froosyn hart, that my inflame hath made? What colde agayne is hable to restore My freshe grene yeres, that wither thus &amp; faade? Alas! I see nothinge to hurt so sore But tyme somtyme reduceth a retourne; Yet tyme my harme increseth more &amp; more, And semes to have my cure allwayes in skorne. Straunge kynd of death, in lief that I doo trye: At hand to melt, farr of in flame to bourne, And like as time list to my cure aply; So doth eche place my comfort cleane refuse. Eche thing alive that sees the heaven with eye, With cloke of night maye cover and excuse Him self from travaile of the dayes vnrest, Save I, alas! against all others vse, That then sturre vpp the torment of my brest, To curse eche starr as cawser of my faat. And when the sonne hath eke the darke represt And brought the daie, yet doth nothing abaat The travaile of my endles smart &amp; payne; Ffor then, as one that hath the light in haat, I wishe for night, more covertlye to playne, And me withdrawe from everie haunted place, Lest in my chere my chaunce should pere to playne; And with my mynd I measure, paas by paas, To seke that place where I my self hadd lost, That daye that I was tangled in that laase, In seming slacke that knytteth ever most. But never yet the trayvaile of my thought Of better state could catche a cawse to bost, For yf I fynde, somtyme that I have sought, Those starres by whome I trusted of the port, My sayles do fall, and I advaunce right nought; As anchord fast, my sprites do all resort To stand atgaas, and sinke in more &amp; more: The deadlye harme which she dooth take in sport. Loo! yf I seke, how I do fynd my sore! And yf I flye, I carrey with me still The venymd shaft which dothe his force restore By hast of flight. And I maye playne my fill Vnto my self, oneles this carefull song Prynt in your hert some percell of my will; For I, alas! in sylence all to long, Of myne old hurt yet fele the wound but grene. Rue on me lief, or elles your crewell wrong Shall well appeare, and by my deth be sene. 12 A GAME OF CHESS Although I had a check, To geue the mate is hard, For I haue found a neck To kepe my men in gard. And you that hardy ar To geue so great assay Vnto a man of warre— To driue his men away—, I rede you take good hede And marke this foolish verse, For I will so prouide That I will haue your ferse. And when your ferse is had And all your warre is done, Then shall your selfe be glad To ende that you begon. For yf by chance I winne Your person in the feeld, To late then come you in Your selfe to me to yeld. For I will vse my power, As captain full of might, And such I will deuour As vse to shew me spight. And for because you gaue Me checke in such degre, This vantage loe I haue; Now checke, and garde to the. Defend it, if thou may; Stand stiffe in thine estate; For sure I will assay, If I can giue the mate. 13 A GOODLY ENSAMPLE When ragyng loue, with extreme payne, Most cruelly distrains my hart; When that my teares, as floudes of rayne, Beare witnes to my wofull smart; When sighes haue wasted so my breath That I lye at the poynte of death; I call to minde the nauye greate That the Greekes brought to Troye towne, And how the boysteous windes did beate Their shyps, and rente their sayles adowne, Till Agamemnons daughters blood Appeasde the goddes that them withstode. And how that, in those ten years warre, Full many a bloudye dede was done; And many a lord, that came full farre, There caught his bane, alas! to sone; And many a good knight ouerronne; Before the Grekes had Helene wonne. Then thinke I thus: sithe suche repayre, So longe time warre of valiant men, Was all to winne a ladye fayre, Shall I not learne to suffer then, And thinke my life well spent, to be Seruyng a worthier wight than she? Therefore I neuer will repent, But paynes, contented, stil endure: For like as when, rough winter spent, The pleasant spring straight draweth in vre, So after ragyng stormes of care, Joyful at length may be my fare. 14 THE TRAMMELS OF LOVE As oft as I behold and see The soveraigne bewtie that me bound, The ner my comfort is to me, Alas! the fressher is my wound. As flame dothe quenche by rage of fier, And roounyng streames consumes by raine, So doth the sight that I desire Apeace my grief and deadly payne. Like as the flee that seethe the flame And thinkes to plaie her in the fier, That fownd her woe, and sowght her game, Whose grief did growe by her desire. When first I saw theise christall streames Whose bewtie made this mortall wound, I litle thought with in these beames So sweete a venvme to have found. Wherein is hid the crewell bytt Whose sharpe repulse none can resist, And eake the spoore that straynith eche wytt To roon the race against his list. But wilful will did prick me forth; Blynd Cupide dyd me whipp &amp; guyde; Force made me take my grief in worthe; My fruytles hope my harme did hide. As cruell waues full oft be found Against the rockes to rore and cry, So doth my hart full oft rebound Ageinst my brest full bitterly. I fall and see my none decaye, As he that beares flame in his brest Fforgetes, for payne, to cast awaye The thing that breadythe his vnrest. And as the spyder drawes her lyne, With labour lost I frame my sewt; The fault is hers, the losse ys myne. Of yll sown seed such ys the frewte. 15 A LESSON IN LOVE When youthe had ledd me half the race That Cupides scourge did make me rune, I loked backe to mete the place Ffrom whence my werye course begune. And then I sawe how my desyre, By ill gydyng, had let my waye; Whose eyes, to greedye of their hire, Had lost me manye a noble praye. Ffor when in sighes I spent the daye, And could not clooke my grief by game, Their boyling smoke did still bewraye The fervent rage of hidden flame. And when salt teares did bayne my brest, Where love his pleasaunt traynes had sowne, The brewt therof my frewt opprest, Or that the bloomes were sprunge &amp; blowne. And where myne eyes did still pursewe The flying chace that was their quest, Their gredye lookes did oft renewe The hydden wounde within my brest. When everye looke these cheekes might stayne, From dedlye pale to flaming redd, By owtard signes apperyd playne The woo wherwith my hart was fedd. But all to late love learneth me To paynt all kynd of coloures newe, To blynde their eyes that elles should see My sparkled chekes with Cupydes hewe. And now the covert brest I clayme That worshipps Cupyd secretlye, And nourysheth hys sacred flame Ffrom whence no blasing sparckes do flye. 16 RUEFUL ASSOCIATIONS O lothsome place! where I Haue sene and herd my dere, When in my hert her eye Hath made her thought appere, By glimsing with such grace As fortune it ne would That lasten any space Betwene vs lenger should. As fortune did auance To further my desire, Euen so hath fortunes chance Throwen all ammiddes the myre; And that I haue deserued With true and faithful hart, Is to his handes reserued That neuer felt the smart. But happy is that man That scaped hath the griefe That loue well teche him can, By wanting his reliefe. A scourage to quiet mindes It is, who taketh hede, A common plage that bindes, A trauell without mede. This gift it hath also, Who so enioies it most A thousand troubles grow To vexe his weried ghost. And last it may not long— The truest thing of all—, And sure the greatest wrong That is within this thrall. But sins thou, desert place, Canst giue me no accompt Of my desired grace That I to haue was wont, Farwel! thou hast me tought To thinke me not the furst That loue hath set aloft And casten in the dust. 17 AN UNCHANGING LOVER Though I regarded not The promise made to me, Or passed not to spot My faith and honeste, Yet were my fancie strange And wilful will to wite, If I sought now to change A falkon for a kite. All men might well dispraise My wit and enterprise, If I estemed a pese Aboue a perle in price, Or iudged the oule in sight The sparehauke to excell, Which flieth but in the night, As all men know right well. Or, if I sought to saile Into the brittle port Where anker hold doth faile, To such as doe resort, And leaue the hauen sure Where blowes no blustring winde, Nor fickelnesse in vre, So far forth as I finde. No, thinke me not so light Nor of so chorlish kinde, Though it lay in my might My bondage to vnbinde, That I would leue the hinde To hunt the ganders fo. No, no! I haue no minde To make exchanges so, Nor yet to change at all. For thinke it may not be That I should seke to fall From my felicitie, Desyrous for to win, And loth for to forgo, Or new change to begin. How may all this be so? The fire it can not freze, For it is not his kinde, Nor true loue cannot lese The constance of the minde; Yet, as sone shall the fire Want heat to blaze and burn, As I in such desire Haue once a thought to turne. 18 A MISTRESS NONPAREIL Geue place, ye louers, here before That spent your bostes and bragges in vaine; My ladies beawtie passeth more The best of yours, I dare well sayen, Than doth the sonne, the candle light, Or brightest day, the darkest night. And thereto hath a trothe as iust As had Penelope the fayre, For what she saith, ye may it trust As it by writing sealed were, And vertues hath she many moe Than I with pen haue skill to showe. I could rehearse, if that I wolde, The whole effect of Natures plaint When she had lost the perfit mold, The like to whom she could not paint; With wringyng handes howe she dyd cry, And what she said, I know it, I. I knowe she swore with ragyng mynd, Her kingdom onely set apart, There was no losse, by loue of kind, That could haue gone so nere her hart. And this was chiefly all her payne, She coulde not make the lyke agayne. Sith Nature thus gaue her the prayse To be the chiefest worke she wrought, In faith, me thinke some better waies On your behalfe might well be sought, Then to compare, as ye haue done, To matche the candle with the sonne. 19 FROM A LOYAL LOVER OVERSEAS Syns fortunes wrath enuieth the welth Wherein I raygned, by the sight Of that, that fed mine eyes by stelth With sower, swete, dreade, and delight, Let not my griefe moue you to mone, For I will wepe and wayle alone. Spite draue me into Borias raigne, Where hory frostes the frutes do bite, When hilles were spred and euery playne With stormy winters mantle white; And yet, my deare, such was my heate, When others frese then did I swete. And now, though on the sunne I driue, Whose feruent flame all thinges decaies, His beames in brightnesse may not striue With light of your swete golden rayes, Nor from my brest this heate remoue The frosen thoughtes grauen by loue. Ne may the waues of the salt floode Quenche that your beauty set on fire, For though mine eyes forbere the fode That did releue the hot desire, Such as I was, such will I be,— Your owne. What would ye more of me! 20 A MODERN ULYSSES I that Vlysses yeres haue spent To seeke Penelope, Finde well what folly I haue ment To seke that was not so, Sinse Troylous case hath caused me From Cressed for to go. And to bewaile Vlysses truth In seas and stormy skies Of wanton will and raging youth, Wherewith I have tossed sore From Cillas seas to Carribes clives Vpon the drowning shore. Where I sought hauen, there found I hap, From daunger vnto death, Much like the mouse that treades the trap In hope to finde her foode, And bites the bread that stops her breath; So in like case I stoode. Till now repentance hasteth him To further me so fast That where I sanke, there now I swim, And haue both streame and winde, And lucke as good, if it may last, As any man may finde. That where I perished, safe I passe, And find no perill there, But stedy stone, no ground of glasse. Now am I sure to saue, And not to flete from feare to feare, Such anker hold I haue. 21 A LADYS LAMENT FOR HER LOVER OVERSEAS O happy dames, that may embrace The frute of your delight, Help to bewaile the wofull case And eke the heauy plight Of me, that wonted to reioyce The fortune of my pleasant choyce. Good ladies, help to fill my moorning voyce. In ship, freight with rememberance Of thoughts and pleasures past, He sailes that hath in gouernance My life, while it wil last; With scalding sighes, for lack of gale, Furdering his hope, that is his sail, Toward me, the swete port of his auail. Alas! how oft in dreames I se Those eyes, that were my food, Which somtime so delited me That yet they do me good; Wherwith I wake with his returne, Whose absent flame did make me burne. But when I finde the lacke, Lord how I mourne! When other louers, in armes acrosse, Reioyce their chiefe delight, Drowned in tears, to mourne my losse, I stand the bitter night In my window, where I may see Before the windes how the cloudes flee. Lo, what a mariner loue hath made me! And in grene waues, when the salt flood Doth rise by rage of winde, A thousand fansies in that mood Assayle my restlesse mind. Alas! now drencheth my swete fo, That with the spoyle of my hart did go, And left me; but, alas, why did he so! And when the seas waxe calme againe, To chase fro me annoye, My doubtfull hope doth cause me plaine; So dreade cuts of my ioye. Thus is my wealth mingled with wo, And of ech thought a dout doth growe: Now he comes; will he come? alas, no, no! 22 A SOPHISTICATED LOVER Suche waywarde wais hath love, that moste parte in discorde. Our willes do stand, wherby our hartes but seldom dooth accorde. Disceyte is his delight, and to begyle and mocke The symple hertes which he doth stryke with froward, dyvers stroke. He cawseth hertes to rage with golden burninge darte, And doth alaye with ledden cold agayne the tothers harte. Hot gleames of burning fyre, &amp; easye sparkes of flame, In balaunce of vnegall weight he pondereth by ame. Ffrom easye fourde, where I might wade &amp; passe full well, He me withdrawes, and doth me drive into the darke, diep well; And me withholdes where I am cald and offerd place; And wooll that still my mortall foo I do beseche of grace. He lettes me to pursue a conquest well nere woon, To follow where my paynes were spilt or that my sute begune. Lo! by these rules I know how sone a hart can turne From warr to peace, from trewce to stryf, and so again returne. I knowe how to convert my will in others lust; Of litle stuff vnto my self to weyve a webb of trust; And how to hide my harme with soft dissembled chere, When in my face the paynted thoughtes wolde owtwardlye appere. I know how that the blood forsakes the faas for dredd, And how by shame it staynes agayne the cheke with flaming redd. I knowe vnder the grene, the serpent how he lurckes; The hamer of the restles forge, I know eke how yt workes. I know, and can be roote, the tale that I wold tell, But ofte the wordes come forth a wrye of hym that loveth well. I know in heat and cold the lover how he shakes, In singinge how he can complayne, in sleaping how he wakes, To languishe without ache, sickles for to consume, A thousand thinges for to devyse resolving all hys fume. And thoughe he lyke to see his ladies face full sore, Suche pleasure as delightes his eye doth not his health restore. I know to seke the tracke of my desyred foo, And feare to fynd that I do seke; but chefelye this I know, That lovers must transforme into the thing beloved, And live—alas, who colde beleve!—with spryte from lief removed. I know in hartye sighes and lawghters of the splene At ones to chaunge my state, my will, &amp; eke my colour clene. I know how to disceyve myself withouten helpp; And how the lyon chastysed is by beating of the whelpp. In standing nere my fyer, I know how that I frese; Ffarr of, to burn; in both to wast, &amp; so my lief to lese. I know how love doth rage vppon the yeldon mynd, How small a nett may take &amp; mashe a harte of gentle kynd; Which seldome tasted swete, to seasoned heaps of gall, Revyved with a glyns of grace olde sorowes to let fall. The hidden traynes I know, &amp; secret snares of love; How sone a loke may prynt a thought that never will remoue. That slipper state I know, those sodayne tournes from welthe, That doubtfull hope, that certayne woo, &amp; sure dispaire of helthe. 23 STRIVE NOT WITH LOVE When sommer toke in hand the winter to assail With force of might and vertue gret, his stormy blasts to quail, And when he clothed faire the earth about with grene, And euery tree new garmented, that pleasure was to sene, Mine hart gan new reuiue, and changed blood dyd stur Me to withdraw my winter woe, that kept within the dore. Abrode, quod my desire, assay to set thy fote, Where thou shalt finde the sauour sweete, for sprong is euery rote; And to thy health, if thou were sick in any case, Nothing more good than in the spring the aire to fele a space. There shalt thou here and se all kindes of birdes ywrought, Well tune their voice with warble smal, as nature hath them tought. Thus pricked me my lust the sluggish house to leaue, And for my health I thought it best suche counsail to receaue. So on a morow furth, vnwist of any wight, I went to proue how well it would my heauy burden light. And when I felt the aire so pleasant round about, Lorde, to my self how glad I was that I had gotten out. There might I see how Ver had euery blossom hent, And eke the new betrothed birdes ycoupled how they went. And in their songes me thought they thanked nature much That by her lycence all that yere to loue—their happe was such— Right as they could deuise to chose them feres throughout; With much reioysing to their Lord thus flew they all about. Which when I gan resolue, and in my head conceaue, What pleasant life, what heapes of ioy, these little birdes receue, And sawe in what estate I, wery man, was brought By want of that they had at will, and I reiect at nought, Lorde, how I gan in wrath vnwisely me demeane. I curssed loue, and him defied; I thought to turne the streame. But whan I well behelde he had me vnder awe, I asked mercie for my fault that so transgrest his law. “Thou blinded god,” quoth I, “forgeue me this offense; Vnwillingly I went about to malice thy pretense.” Wherewith he gaue a beck, and thus me thought he swore: “Thy sorow ought suffice to purge thy faulte, if it were more.” The vertue of which sounde mine hart did so reuiue That I, me thought, was made as hole as any man aliue. But here ye may perceiue mine errour, all and some, For that I thought that so it was, yet was it still vndone; And all that was no more but mine empressed mynde, That fayne woulde haue some good relese of Cupide wel assinde. I turned home forthwith, and might perceiue it well, That he agreued was right sore with me for my rebell. My harmes haue euer since increased more and more, And I remaine, without his help, vndone for euer more. A miror let me be vnto ye louers all: Striue not with loue, for if ye do, it will ye thus befall. 24 A STRICKEN SHEPHERD In winters iust returne, when Boreas gan his raigne, And euery tree vnclothed fast, as nature taught them plaine, In misty morning darke, as sheepe are then in holde, I hyed me fast, it sat me on, my sheepe for to vnfolde. And as it is a thing that louers haue by fittes, Vnder a palm I heard one crye as he had lost hys wittes. Whose voice did ring so shrill, in vttering of his plaint, That I amazed was to hear how loue could hym attaint. “Ah wretched man,” quod he, “come death, and ridde thys wo; A just reward, a happy end, if it may chaunce thee so. Thy pleasures past haue wrought thy wo, withoute redresse; If thou hadst neuer felt no ioy, thy smart had bene the lesse.” And retchlesse of his life, he gan both sighe and grone; A rufull thing me thought it was to hear him make such mone. “Thou cursed pen,” sayd he, “wo worth the bird thee bare; The man, the knife, and all that made thee, wo be to their share. Wo worth the time, and place, where I so could endite, And wo be it yet once agayne, the pen that so can write. Vnhappy hand, it had ben happy time for me If, when to write thou learned first, vnioynted hadst thou be.” Thus cursed he himself, and euery other wight, Saue her alone whom loue him bound to serue both day and night. Which when I heard, and saw, how he himselfe fordid, Against the ground, with bloudy strokes, himself euen there to rid, Had ben my heart of flint, it must haue melted tho, For in my life I neuer saw a man so full of wo. With teares, for his redresse, I rashly to him ran And in my arms I caught him fast, and thus I spake hym than: “What wofull wight art thou, that in such heauy case Tormentes thy selfe with such despite, here in this desert place?” Wherewith, as all agast, fulfild wyth ire and dred, He cast on me a staring loke, with colour pale and ded. “Nay, what art thou,” quod he, “that in this heauy plight Doest finde me here, most wofull wretch, that life hath in despight?” “I am,” quoth I, “but pore, and simple in degre; A shepardes charge I haue in hand, vnworthy though I be.” With that he gaue a sighe, as though the skye should fall, And lowd, alas! he shryked oft, and “Shepard,” gan he call, “Come, hie the fast at ones, and print it in thy hart; So thou shalt know, and I shall tell the, giltlesse how I smart.” His backe against the tree, sore febled all with faint, With weary sprite hee stretched him vp, and thus hee told his plaint. “Ones in my hart,” quoth he, “it chanced me to loue Such one, in whom hath nature wrought her cunning for to proue. And sure I can not say, but many yeres were spent With such good will so recompenst, as both we were content. Whereto then I me bound, and she likewise also, The sonne should runne his course awry, ere we this faith forgo. Who ioied then, but I, who had this worldes blisse? Who might compare a life to mine, that neuer thought on this? But dwelling in thys truth, amid my greatest ioy, Is me befallen a greater loss than Priam had of Troy: She is reuersed clene, and beareth me in hand, That my desertes haue giuen her cause to break thys faithful band. And for my iust excuse auaileth no defense. Now knowest thou all; I can no more. But, shepard hye the hense, And giue him leaue to die that may no lenger liue. Whose record, lo, I claime to haue, my death, I doe forgiue. And eke, when I am gone, be bolde to speake it plain: Thou hast seen dye the truest man that euer loue did pain.” Wherewith he turned him round, and gasping oft for breath, Into his armes a tree he raught, and sayd, “Welcome my death: Welcome a thousand fold, now dearer vnto me Than should, without her loue to liue, an emperour to be.” Thus, in this wofull state, he yelded vp the ghost, And little knoweth his lady, what a louer she hath lost. Whose death when I beheld, no maruail was it, right For pitie though my heart did blede, to see so piteous sight. My blood from heat to colde oft changed wonders sore; A thousand troubles there I found I neuer knew before. Twene dread and dolour, so my sprites were brought in feare, That long it was ere I could call to minde what I did there. But, as eche thing hath end, so had these paynes of mine: The furies past, and I my wits restored by length of time. Then, as I could deuise, to seke I thought it best Where I might finde some worthy place for such a corse to rest. And in my mind it came, from thence not farre away, Where Chreseids loue, king Priams sonne, ye worthy Troilus lay. By him I made his tomb, in token he was trew, And, as to him belonged well, I couered it with bleew. Whose soule, by angles power, departed not so sone But to the heauens, lo, it fled, for to receiue his dome. 25 A FRIENDLY WARNING To dearly had I bought my grene and youthfull yeres, If in mine age I could not finde when craft for loue apperes; And seldom though I come in court among the rest, Yet can I iudge in colours dim as depe as can the best. Where grefe tormentes the man that suffreth secret smart, To breke it forth vnto som frend it easeth well the hart. So standes it now with me for my beloued frend. This case is thine for whom I fele such torment of my minde, And for thy sake I burne so in my secret brest That till thou know my hole disseyse my hart can haue no rest. I se how thine abuse hath wrested so thy wittes That all it yeldes to thy desire, and folowes the by fittes. Where thou hast loued so long with hart and all thy power, I se thee fed with fayned wordes, thy freedom to deuour. I know—though she say nay, and would it well withstand— When in her grace thou held the most, she bare the but in hand. I see her pleasant chere in chiefest of thy suite; Whan thou art gone, I se him come that gathers vp the fruite. And eke in thy respect I se the base degre Of him to whom she gaue the hart that promised was to the. I se—what would you more—stode neuer man so sure On womans word, but wisedome would mistrust it to endure. 26 THE FICKLENESS OF WOMAN Wrapt in my carelesse cloke, as I walke to and fro, I se how loue can shew what force there reigneth in his bow; And how he shoteth eke, a hardy hart to wound; And where he glanceth by agayne, that litle hurt is found. For seldom is it sene he woundeth hartes alike: The tone may rage, when tothers loue is often farre to seke. All this I se, with more, and wonder thinketh me Howe he can strike the one so sore, and leaue the other fre. I se that wounded wight, that suffreth all this wrong, How he is fed with yeas and nayes, and liueth all to long. In silence though I kepe such secretes to my self, Yet do I se how she sometime doth yeld a loke by stelth, As though it seemed, ywys, I will not lose the so,— When in her hart so swete a thought did neuer truely grow. Then say I thus: alas, that man is farre from blisse That doth receiue for his relief none other gayn but this. And she, that fedes him so,—I fele, and finde it plain— Is but to glory in her power, that ouer such can reign. Nor are such graces spent but when she thinkes that he, A weried man, is fully bent such fansies to let flie; Then to retain him stil she wrasteth new her grace, And smileth, lo, as though she would forthwith the man embrace. But when the proofe is made to try such lokes withall, He findeth then the place all voyde, and fraighted full of gall. Lord, what abuse is this! who can such women praise, That for their glory do deuise to vse such crafty wayes! I, that among the rest do sit, and mark the row, Fynde that in her is greater craft then is in twenty mo. When tender yeres, alas! with wyles so well are spedde, What will she do when hory heares are powdred in her hedde! 27 MODERN SAWS AND ANCIENT INSTANCE Gyrtt in my giltlesse gowne, as I sytt heare and sowe, I see that thinges are not in dead as to the owtward showe. And who so lyst to looke and note thinges somewhat neare, Shal fynde, wheare playnnesse seemes to haunte, nothing but craft appeare. For with indifferent eyes my self can well discearne How som, to guyd a shyppe in stormes, stycke not to take the stearne; Whose skill and conninge tryed in calme to steare a bardge, They wolde sone shaw, yow shold sone see, it weare to great a chardge. And some I see agayne sytt still and say but small That can do ten tymes more than they that say they can do all. Whose goodlye gyftes are suche, the more they vnderstand, The more they seeke to learne and know and take lesse chardge in hand. And, to declare more playne, the tyme flyttes not so fast But I can beare right well in mynd the song now sung and past. The auctour whearof cam, wrapt in a craftye cloke, In will to force a flamyng fyre wheare he could rayse no smoke. If powre and will had mett, as it appeareth playne, The truth nor right had tane no place, their vertues had bene vayne. So that you may perceave and I may saflye see, The innocent that giltlesse is, condempned sholde have be. Muche lyke untruth to this the story doth declare, Wheare the elders layd to Susans chardge meete matter to compare. They did her both accuse and eke condempne her to, And yet no reason, right, nor truthe, did lead them so to do. And she thus judged to dye, toward her death went forthe Ffraughted with faith, a pacient pace, taking her wrong in worthe. But he, that dothe defend all those that in hym trust, Did raise a childe for her defence, to shyeld her from the unjust. And Danyell chosen was then of this wrong to weete How, in what place, and eke with whome, she did this cryme commytt. He cawsed the elders part the one from the others sight, And did examyne one by one and chardged them bothe say right. Vndra molberye trye it was, fyrst sayd the one; The next namede a pomegranate trye; whereby the truth was knowne. Than Susan was discharged and they condempned to dye, As right requeares and they deserve that framede so fowll a lye. And he, that her preserved and lett them of their lust, Hath me defendyd hetherto, and will do still I trust. 28 CALM AFTER STORM If care do cause men cry, why do not I complaine? If eche man do bewaile his wo, why shew I not my paine? Since that amongest them all, I dare well say, is none So farre from weale, so full of wo, or hath more cause to mone. For all thyngs hauing live sometime haue quiet rest, The bering asse, the drawing oxe, and euery other beast. The peasant and the post, that serue at al assayes, The shyp boy and the galley slaue, haue time to take their ease, Saue I, alas! whom care of force doth so constraine To waile the day and wake the night continually in paine From pensiuenes to plaint, from plaint to bitter teares, From teares to painful plaint againe; and thus my life it wears. No thing vnder the sunne that I can here or se, But moueth me for to bewaile my cruell destenie. For wher men do reioyce, since that I can not so, I take no pleasure in that place, it doubleth but my woe. And when I heare the sound of song or instrument, Me thinke eche tune there dolefull is and helpes me to lament. And if I se some haue their most desired sight, Alas! think I, eche man hath weal saue I, most wofull wight. Then, as the striken dere withdrawes him selfe alone, So do I seke some secrete place where I may make my mone. There do my flowing eyes shew forth my melting hart, So yat the stremes of those two welles right wel declare my smart. And in those cares so colde I force my selfe a heate, As sick men in their shaking fittes procure them self to sweate; With thoughtes that for the time do much appease my paine. But yet they cause a ferther fere and brede my woe agayne: Me thinke within my thought I se right plaine appere, My hartes delight, my sorowes leche, mine earthly goddesse here, With euery sondry grace that I haue sene her haue; Thus I within my wofull brest her picture paint and graue. And in my thought I roll her bewties to and fro, Her laughing chere, her louely looke, my hart that perced so; Her strangenes when I sued her seruant for to be; And what she sayd, and how she smiled, when that she pitied me. Then comes a sodaine feare that riueth all my rest Lest absence cause forgetfulness to sink within her brest. For when I thinke how far this earth doth vs deuide, Alas! me semes loue throwes me downe; I fele how that I slide. But then, I thinke againe, why should I thus mistrust So swete a wight, so sad and wise, that is so true and iust; For loth she was to loue, and wauering is she not. The farther of, the more desirde; thus louers tie their knot. So in dispaire and hope plonged am I both vp an doune, As is the ship with wind and waue when Neptune list to froune. But as the watry showers delaye the raging winde, So doth good hope clene put away dispayre out of my minde, And biddes me for to serue and suffer pacientlie, For what, wot I, the after weale that fortune willes to me. For those that care do knowe and tasted haue of trouble, When passed is their woful paine, eche ioy shall seme them double; And bitter sendes she now, to make me tast the better The plesant swete, when that it comes, to make it seme the sweter. And so determine I to serue vntill my brethe; Ye, rather dye a thousand times then once to false my feithe. And if my feble corps through weight of wofull smart Do fayle or faint, my will it is that still she kepe my hart. And when thys carcas here to earth shalbe refarde, I do bequeth my weried ghost to serue her afterwarde.</field>

Bewty of kind, her vertues from above, Happy ys he that may obtaine her love. 30 WINDSOR MEMORIES When Windesor walles sustained my wearied arme, My hand, my chyn, to ease my restles hedd, Ech pleasaunt plot revested green with warm, The blossomed bowes, with lustie veare yspred, The flowred meades, the weddyd birdes so late, Myne eyes discouered. Than did to mynd resort The ioily woes, the hateles shorte debate, The rakhell life, that longes to loves disporte. Wherwith, alas! myne hevy charge of care, Heapt in my brest, brake forth against my will; And smoky sighes, that over cast the ayer; My vapored eyes such drery teares distill, The tender spring to quicken wher thei fall; And I have bent to throwe me downe with all. 31 THE POETS LAMENT FOR HIS LOST BOYHOOD So crewell prison! howe could betyde, alas! As prowde Wyndsour, where I, in lust &amp; ioye, With a Kinges soon my childishe yeres did passe, In greater feast then Priams sonnes of Troye; Where eche swete place retournes a tast full sowre. The large grene courtes, where we wer wont to hove, With eyes cast upp unto the maydens towre, And easye sighes, such as folke drawe in love. The statelye sales: the ladyes bright of hewe; The daunces short; long tales of great delight; With wordes and lookes, that tygers could but rewe, Where eche of vs did plead the others right. The palme playe, where, dispoyled for the game, With dased eyes oft we by gleames of love Have mist the ball, and got sight of our dame, To bayte her eyes which kept the leddes above. The graveld ground: with sleves tyed on the helme, On fomynge horse, with swordes and frendlye hertes, With chere, as thoughe the one should overwhelme, Where we have fought &amp; chased oft with dartes. With sylver dropps the meades yet spredd for rewthe, In active games of nymblenes and strengthe Where we dyd strayne, trayled by swarmes of youthe, Our tender lymes, that yet shott vpp in lengthe. The secret groves, which oft we made resound Of pleasaunt playnt &amp; of our ladyes prayes, Recording soft, what grace eche one had found, What hope of spede, what dred of long delayes. The wyld forest, the clothed holte with grene, With raynes avald and swift ybrethed horse, With crye of houndes and merey blastes bitwen, Where we did chace the fearfull hart a force. The voyd walles eke, that harbourde vs eche night; Wherwith, alas! revive within my brest The swete accord, such slepes as yet delight, The pleasaunt dreames, the quyet bedd of rest, The secret thoughtes imparted with such trust, The wanton talke, the dyvers chaung of playe, The frendshipp sworne, eche promyse kept so iust, Wherwith we past the winter nightes awaye. And with this thought the blood forsakes my face, The teares berayne my chekes of dedlye hewe; The which, as sone as sobbing sighes, alas! Vpsupped have, thus I my playnt renewe: “O place of blys! renewer of my woos! Geve me accompt wher is my noble fere, Whome in thy walles thow didest eche night enclose, To other lief, but vnto me most dere.” Eccho, alas! that dothe my sorowe rewe, Retournes therto a hollowe sound of playnt. Thus I, alone, where all my fredome grew, In pryson pyne with bondage and restraynt; And with remembraunce of the greater greif, To bannishe the lesse, I fynde my chief releif. 32 A SATIRE ON LONDON, THE MODERN BABYLON London, hast thow accused me Of breche of lawes, the roote of stryfe? Within whose brest did boyle to see, So fervent hotte, thy dissolute lief, That even the hate of synnes, that groo Within thy wicked walles so rife, Ffor to breake forthe did convert soo That terrour colde it not represse. The which, by wordes, syns prechers knoo What hope is left for to redresse, By vnknowne meanes, it liked me My hydden burden to expresse, Wherby yt might appere to the That secret synn hath secret spight; Ffrom iustice rodd no fault is free; But that all such as wourke vnright In most quyet, are next ill rest. In secret sylence of the night This made me, with a reckles brest, To wake thy sluggardes with my bowe; A fygure of the Lordes behest, Whose scourge for synn the Screptures shew. That, as the fearfull thonder clapp By soddayne flame at hand we knowe, Of peoble stones the sowndles rapp, The dredfull plage might mak the see Of Goddes wrath, that doth the enwrapp; That pryde might know, from conscyence free, How loftye workes may her defend; And envye fynd, as he hath sought, How other seke hym to offend; And wrath tast of eche crewell thought The iust shapp hyer in the end; And ydell slouthe, that never wrought, To heven hys spirite lift may begyn; &amp; gredye lucre lyve in drede To see what haate ill gott goodes wynn; The lechers, ye that lustes do feed, Perceve what secrecye is in synne; And gluttons hartes for sorrow blede, Awaked, when their faulte they fynd. In lothsome vyce, eche dronken wight To styrr to Godd, this was my mynd. Thy wyndowes had don me no spight; But prowd people that drede no fall, Clothed with falshed' and vnright Bred in the closures of thy wall, But wrested to wrathe in fervent zeale, Thow hast to strief, my secret call. Endured hartes no warning feale. On shamles hore! is dred then gone By suche thy foes, as ment thy weale? Oh membre of false Babylon! The shopp of craft! the denne of ire! Thy dredfull dome drawes fast uppon; Thy martyres blood, by swoord &amp; fyre, In Heaven &amp; earth for iustice call. The Lord shall here their iust desyre; The flame of wrath shall on the fall; With famyne and pest lamentablie Stricken shalbe thy lecheres all; Thy prowd towers and turretes hye, Enmyes to God, beat stone from stone; Thyne idolles burnt, that wrought iniquitie. When none thy ruyne shall bemone, But render vnto the right wise Lord, That so hath iudged Babylon, Imortall praise with one accord. 33 LADY SURREYS LAMENT FOR HER ABSENT LORD Good ladies, you that have your pleasure in exyle, Stepp in your foote, come, take a place, and mourne with me awhyle; And suche as by their lords do sett but lytle pryce, Lett them sitt still, it skills them not what chaunce come on the dyce. But you whome love hath bound, by order of desyre To love your lordes, whose good desertes none other wold requyre, Come you yet once agayne, and sett your foote by myne, Whose wofull plight, and sorowes great, no tongue may well defyne. My lord and love, alas! in whome consystes my wealth, Hath fortune sent to passe the seas, in haserd of his health. That I was wontt for to embrace, contentid myndes, Ys now amydd the foming floodds, at pleasure of the wyndes. Theare God hym well preserve, and safelye me hym send; Without whiche hope, my lyf, alas! weare shortlye at an ende. Whose absence yet, although my hope doth tell me plaine With short returne he comes anon, yet ceasith not my payne. The fearefull dreames I have, oft tymes they greeve me so That then I wake, and stand in dowbtt yf they be trew or no. Somtyme the roring seas, me seemes, they grow so hye, That my sweete lorde in daunger greate, alas! doth often lye. Another tyme, the same doth tell me he is comme, And playng, wheare I shall hym fynd, with T., his lytle sonne. So forthe I goe apace, to see that lyfsome sight, And with a kysse, me thinckes I say, “Now well come home, my knight; Welcome, my sweete, alas! the staye of my welfare; Thye presence bringeth forthe a truce betwixt me and my care.” Then lyvelye doth he looke, and saluith me agayne, And saith, “My deare, how is it now that you have all this payne?” Wheare with the heavie cares, that heapt are in my brest, Breake forth, and me dischardgeth cleane of all my great unrest. Butt when I me awayke and fynde it but a dreame, The angwyshe of my former woe beginneth more extreme, And me tourmentith so that vnneth may I fynde Some hydden wheare, to steale the gryfe of my unquyet mynd. Thus, euerye waye, you see with absence how I burne, And for my wound no cure there is but hope of some retourne, Save when I feele, the sower, how sweete is felt the more, It doth abate some of my paynes that I abode before; And then unto my self I saye, “When that we two shall meete, But lyttle tyme shall seeme this payne, that joye shall be so sweete.” Ye wyndes, I you convart, in chieffest of your rage, That you my lord me safelye send, my sorowes to asswage; And that I may not long abyde in suche excesse, Do your good will to cure a wight that lyveth in distresse. 34 AN IRATE HOST Eache beeste can chuse his feere according to his minde, And eke to shew a frindlie cheare, lyke to their beastly kynd. A lyon saw I theare, as whyte as any snow, Whiche seemyd well to leade the race, his porte the same did shew. Uppon this gentyll beast to gaze it lyked me, For still me thought, it seemyd me, of noble blood to be. And as he praunced before, still seeking for a make, As whoe wolde say, “There is none heare, I trow, will me forsake,” I might perceave a woolf, as whyte as whale his bone, A fayrer beast, a fressher hew, beheld I never none, Save that her lookes wear fearce and froward eke her grace. Toward the whiche, this gentle beast gan hym advaunce apace, And, with a beck full low, he bowed at her feete In humble wyse, as who wold say, “I am to farr unmeete”; But suche a scornfull cheere, wheare with she hym rewarded, Was never seene, I trow, the lyke, to suche as well deservid. Wheare with she startt asyde well neare a foote or twayne, And unto hym thus gan she saye, with spight and great disdayne: “Lyon,” she said, “yf thow hadest knowen my mynde beforne, Thow hadst not spentt thie travaile thus, and all thie payne forlorne. Do waye! I lett the weete, thow shalt not play with me; But raunge aboute: thow maiste seeke oute some meeter feere for the.” Forthwith he beatt his taile, his eyes begounne to flame; I might perceave his noble hartt moche moved by the same. Yet saw I him refrayne, and eke his rage asswage, And unto her thus gan he say, whan he was past his rage: “Crewell, you do me wronge to sett me thus so light; Without desert, for my good will to shew me such dispight. How can you thus entreat a lyon of the race, That with his pawes a crowned kinge devoured in the place? Whose nature is, to prea uppon no symple foode As longe as he may suck the flesshe, and drincke of noble bloode. Yf you be faire and fresshe, am I not of your hew? And, for my vaunte, I dare well say my blood is not untrew; Ffor you your self dothe know, it is not long agoe, Sins that, for love, one of the race did end his life in woe In towre both strong and highe, for his assured truthe. Wheare as in teares he spent his breath, alas! the more the ruthe; This gentle beast lykewise, who nothinge could remove, But willinglye to seeke his death for losse of his true love. Other ther be whose lyfe, to lynger still in payne, Against their will preservid is, that wold have dyed right fayne. But well I may perceave that nought it movid you, My good entent, my gentle hart, nor yet my kynd so true; But that your will is suche to lure me to the trade, As others some full many yeares to trace by crafte you made. And thus beholde my kynd, how that we differ farr: I seke my foes, and you your frends do threaten still with warr; I fawne wheare I am fedd, you flee that seekes to you; I can devoure no yelding pray, you kill wheare you subdue; My kynd, is to desyre the honour of the field, And you, with blood to slake your thurst of suche as to you yelde. Wherefore I wolde you wist, that for your coy lookes I am no man that will be traynd, nor tanglyd bye such hookes; And thoughe some list to bow, wheare blame full well they might, And to suche beastes a currant fawne, that shuld have travaile bright, I will observe the law that nature gave to me, To conqueare such as will resist, and let the rest go free. And as a ffaulcon free, that soreth in the ayre, Whiche never fedd on hand or lure, that for no stale doth care, While that I live and breathe, suche shall my custome be In wildnesse of the woods to seeke my prea, wheare pleasith me; Where many one shall rew that never mad offence: Thus your refuse agaynst my powre shall bode them no defence. In the revendge wherof, I vowe and sweare therto, A thowsand spoyles I shall commytt I never thought to do; And yf to light on you my happ so good shall be, I shall be glad to feede on that that wold have fed on me. And thus, farewell! unkynd, to whome I bent to low, I would you wist the shipp is safe that bare his saile so low! Syns that a lyons hart is for a woolfe no pray, With blooddye mowth of symple sheepe go slake your wrath, I say, With more dispight and ire than I can now expresse, Whiche to my payne though I refrayne the cause you may well gesse: As for becawse my self was awthour of this game, It bootes me not that, by my wrath, I should disturbb the same. 35 PROLOG TO PSALM 88 Wher recheles youthe in a vnquiet brest, Set on by wrath, revenge, and crueltye, After long warr pacyens had opprest, And iustice wrought by pryncelye equitie; My Deny, then myne errour, depe imprest, Began to worke dispaire of libertye, Had not David, the perfyt warriour, tought That of my fault thus pardon shold be sought. 36 PROLOG TO PSALM 73 The soudden stormes that heaue me to and froo Had welneare pierced faith, my guyding saile, For I, that on the noble voyage goo To succhor treuthe and falshed to assaile, Constrayned am to beare my sayles ful loo And neuer could attayne some pleasaunt gaile, For vnto such the prosperous winds doo bloo As ronne from porte to porte to seke availe. This bred dispayre, wherof such doubts did groo That I gan faint and all my courage faile. But now, my Blage, myne errour well I see; Such goodlye light King David giueth me. 37 REFLECTIONS FROM THE TOWER The stormes are past, these cloudes are ouerblowne, And humble chere great rygour hath represt. For the defaute is set a paine foreknowne, And pacience graft in a determed brest. And in the hart where heapes of griefes were grown, The swete reuenge hath planted mirth and rest; No company so pleasant as myne owne. Thraldom at large hath made this prison fre; Danger well past, remembred, workes delight. Of lingring doutes such hope is sprong, perdie! That nought I finde displeasaunt in my sight But when my glasse presented vnto me The curelesse wound that bledeth day and night. To think, alas! such hap should graunted be Vnto a wretch that hath no hart to fight, To spill that blood that hath so oft bene shed For Britannes sake, alas! and now is ded.</field>

Where he doth painte the lively fayth and pure, The stedfast hope, the sweet returne to grace, Of iust David, by perfect penitence; Where rulers may see, in a myrrour clere, The bytter frute of false concupicence: How Iurye bowght Vryas death full deere. In princes hartes Godes scourge yprinted deepe Mowght them awake out of their synfull sleepe. 39 AN EPIGRAM TO RADCLIFFE My Ratclif, when they rechlesse youth offendes, Receue thy scourge by others chastisement. For such callyng, when it workes none amendes, Then plagues are sent without aduertisement. Yet Salomon sayd, the wronged shall recure; But Wiat said true, the skarre doth aye endure. 40 SARDANAPALUS Th' Assyryans king—in peas, with fowle desyre And filthye lustes that staynd his regall harte— In warr, that should sett prycelye hertes a fyre, Vanquyshd, dyd yelde for want of martyall arte. The dent of swordes from kysses semed straunge, And harder then hys ladyes syde his targe; From glotton feastes to sowldyers fare a chaunge; His helmet, far aboue a garlandes charge. Who scace the name of manhode dyd retayne, Ffeble of sprete, vnpacyent of payne, When he hadd lost his honour and hys right,— Prowde, tyme of welthe, in stormes appawld with drede—, Murdred hymself to shew some manfull dede, Drenched in slouthe &amp; womanishe delight. 41 THE HAPPY LIFE Marshall, the thinges for to attayne The happy life be thes, I fynde: The riches left, not got with payne; The frutfull grownd; the quyet mynde; The equall freend; no grudge, nor stryf; No charge of rule nor governance; Without disease, the helthfull life; The howshold of contynvance: The meane dyet, no delicate fare; Wisdom ioyned with simplicitye; The night discharged of all care, Where wyne may beare no soveranty; The chast wife, wyse, without debate; Suche sleapes as may begyle the night; Contented with thyne owne estate, Neyther wisshe death, nor fear his might. 42 THE GOLDEN MEAN Of thy lyfe, Thomas, this compasse well mark: Not aye with full sayles the hye seas to beat; Ne by coward dred, in shonning stormes dark, On shalow shores thy keel in perill freat. Who so gladly halseth the golden meane, Voyde of dangers aduisdly hath his home Not with lothsom muck, as a den vncleane, Nor palacelyke, wherat disdayn may glome. The lofty pyne the great winde often riues; With violenter swey falne turrets stepe; Lightninges assault the hye mountains and cliues. A hart well stayd, in ouerthwartes depe, Hopeth amendes; in swete, doth feare the sowre. God, that sendeth, withdrawth winter sharp. Now ill, not aye thus: once Phebus to lowre With bow vnbent shall cesse, and frame to harp His voyce. In straite estate appere thou stout; And so wisely, when lucky gale of winde All thy puft sailes shall fil, loke well about, Take in a ryft; hast is wast, profe doth finde. 43 THE AGES OF MAN Laid in my quyett bedd, in study as I weare, I saw within my troubled hed a heape of thoughtes appeare; And every thought did shew so lyvelye in myne eyes, That now I sight, and then I smylde, as cawse of thought did ryse. I saw the lytle boye, in thought how ofte that he Did wishe of Godd to scape the rodd, a tall yong man to be; The yong man, eke, that feeles his bones with paynes opprest, How he wold be a riche olde man, to lyve and lye att rest; The ryche olde man, that sees his end draw on so sore, How he wolde be a boy agayne, to lyve so moche the more. Wheare at, full ofte I smylde, to see how all theise three, From boy to man, from man to boy, wold chopp and chaunge degree; And musinge thus, I thincke the case is very straunge, That man from wealth, to lyve in woe, doth ever seeke to chaunge. Thus thoughtfull as I laye, I saw my witheryd skynne How it doth shew my dynted jawes, the flesshe was worne so thynne, And eke my tothelesse chapps, the gates of my right way, That opes and shuttes as I do speake, do thus unto me say: “Thie whyte and horishe heares, the messengers of age, That shew lyke lynes of true belief that this lif doth asswage, Bides the lay hand, and feele them hanging on thie chyn, The whiche do wryte twoe ages past, the thurd now cumming in. Hang upp, therfore, the bitt of thie yonge wanton tyme, And thow that theare in beaten art, the happyest lif defyne.” Wheare at I sight, and said, “Farewell! my wonted joye; Trusse upp thie pack, and trudge from me to every lytle boye, And tell them thus from me, theire tyme moste happie is, Yf, to their tyme, they reason had to know the truthe of this.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ELEGIAC POEMS 44 A TRIBUTE TO WYATT In the rude age when scyence was not so rife, If Jove in Crete, and other where they taught Artes to reverte to profyte of our lyfe, Wan after deathe to have their temples sought; If vertue yet, in no vnthankful tyme, Fayled of some to blast her endles fame— A goodlie meane bothe to deter from cryme And to her steppes our sequell to enflame; In deyes of treuthe, if Wyattes frendes then waile— The onelye debte that ded of quycke may clayme— That rare wit spent, employde to our avayle, Where Christe is taught, deserve they mannis blame? His livelie face thy brest how did it freate, Whose cynders yet with envye doo the eate. 45 A SECOND TRIBUTE TO WYATT Dyvers thy death doo dyverslye bemone. Some, that in presence of that livelye hedd Lurked, whose brestes envye with hate had sowne, Yeld Cesars teres vppon Pompeius hedd. Some, that watched with the murdrers knyfe, With egre thurst to drynke thy guyltles blood, Whose practyse brake by happye end of lyfe, Weape envyous teares to here thy fame so good. But I that knewe what harbourd in that hedd, What vertues rare were temperd in that brest, Honour the place that such a iewell bredd, And kysse the ground, where as thy coorse doth rest, With vaporde eyes; from whence suche streames avayle As Pyramus did on Thisbes brest bewayle. 46 A THIRD TRIBUTE TO WYATT W. resteth here, that quick could neuer rest; Whose heauenly giftes encreased by disdain, And vertue sank the deper in his brest: Such profit he by enuy could obtain. A hed, where wisdom misteries did frame; Whose hammers bet styll in that liuely brayn As on a stithe, where that some work of fame Was dayly wrought, to turne to Britaines gayn. A visage, stern and myld; where bothe did grow, Vice to contemne, in vertue to reioyce; Amid great stormes, whom grace assured so, To lyue vpright, and smile at fortunes choyce. A hand, that taught what might be sayd in ryme; That reft Chaucer the glory of his wit; A mark, the which—vnparfited, for time— Some may approche, but neuer non shall hit. A toung, that serued in forein realmes his king; Whose courteous talke to vertue did enflame Eche noble hart; a worthy guide to bring Our English youth, by trauail, vnto fame. An eye, whose iudgement none affect could blinde, Frendes to allure, and foes to reconcile; Whose persing loke did represent a mynde With vertue fraught, reposed, voyd of gyle. A hart, where drede was neuer so imprest To hyde the thought that might the trouth auance; In neyther fortune lost, nor yet represt, To swell in wealth, or yeld vnto mischance. A valiant corps, where force and beawty met, Happy, alas! to happy, but for foes, Lieud, and ran the race that nature set; Of manhodes shape, where she the molde did lose. But to the heauens that simple soule is fled; Which left with such, as couet Christ to know, Witnesse of faith that neuer shall be ded; Sent for our helth, but not receiued so. Thus, for our gilte, this iewel haue we lost; The earth his bones, the heavens possesse his gost. 47 A TRIBUTE TO THOMAS CLERE Norfolk sprang thee, Lambeth holds thee dead, Clere, of the County of Cleremont, though hight. Within the womb of Ormonds race thou bred, And sawest thy cousin crowned in thy sight. Shelton for love, Surrey for lord, thou chase;— Aye, me! while life did last that league was tender. Tracing whose steps thou sawest Kelsall blaze, Laundersey burnt, and battered Bullen render. At Muttrel gates, hopeless of all recure, Thine Earl, half dead, gave in thy hand his will; Which cause did thee this pining death procure, Ere summers four times seven thou couldst fulfill. Ah, Clere! if love had booted, care, or cost, Heaven had not wonne, nor earth so timely lost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TRANSLATIONS FROM THE BIBLE 48 ECCLESIASTES 1. I, Salamon, Dauids sonne, King of Ierusalem, Chossen by God to teach the Iewes and in his lawes to leade them, Confesse vnder the sonne that euery thing is uayne, The world is false, man he is fraile, and all his pleasures payne. Alas! what stable frute may Adams children fynde In that, they seke by sweate of browes and trauill of their mynde. We that liue on the earthe, drawe toward our decay; Ower childeren fill our place a whille, and then they fade awaye. Such chaunges maks the earthe, and doth remoue for none, But sarues us for a place too play our tragedes vppon. When that the restles sonne, westwarde his course hathe ronne, Towards the east he hasts as fast, to ryse where he begonne. When hoorrey Boreas hathe blowen his frosen blaste, Then Zephirus, with his gentill breathe, dissolues the ise as fast. Ffludds that drinke vpp smale broks and swell by rage of rayne, Discharge in sees which them repulse, and swallowe strayte againe. These worldly pleasures, Lord, so swifte they ronne their race That skace our eyes may them discerne, they bide so littell space. What hathe bin, but is now, the like hereafter shall. What new deuice grounded so suer, that dreadeth not the fall? What may be called new, but suche things in tymes past As time buryed and dothe reuiue, and tyme agayne shall waste? Things past right worthey fame, haue now no brute at all; Euen so shall dey suche things as now the simple, wounders call. I that, in Dauides seate, sit crowned and reioyce, That with my septer rewle the Iewes and teache them with my uoyce, Haue serchied long to know all things vnder the sonne, To see how, in this mortall lyef, a suerty might be wonne. This kyndled will to knowe, straunge things for to desyer, God hathe grafte in our gredye breasts, a torment for our hier. The end of eache trauell, furthwith I sought to knoo; I found them uaine, mixed with gall, and burdend with muche woo. Defaults of natures wourke no mans hand may restore, Whiche be in nomber like the sandes vppon the salte floods shore. Then, vaunting in my witte, I gan call to my mynd What rewles of wysdom I hadde taught, that elders could not find; And as, by contraries, to treye most things, we use, Mens follies and ther errors, eke, I gan them all peruse, Thyerby with more delight, to knowledge for to clime. But this I found an endles wourke of payne and losse of tyme, Ffor he, to wisdomes skoole, that doth applie his mynd, The further that he wades ther in, the greater doubts shall find. And such as enterprice, to put newe things in ure, Of some, that shall skorne their deuise, may well them selfes assure. 49 ECCLESIASTES 2. From pensif fanzies, then, I gan my hart reuoke, And gaue me to suche sporting plaies as laughter myght prouoke; But euen such uain delights, when they moste blinded me, Allwayes, me thought, with smiling grace, a king did yll agre. Then sought I how to please my belly with muche wine, To feede me fatte with costely feasts of rare delights and fine, And other plesures, eke, too purchace me with rest, In so great choise to finde the thing that might content me best. But, Lord, what care of mynde, what soddaine stormes of ire, With broken slepes enduryd I, to compasse my desier! To buylde my howses faier then sett I all my cure; By princely acts thus straue I still to make my fame indure. Delicius gardens, eke, I made to please my sight, And grafte therin all kindes of fruts that might my mouthe delight. Condits, by liuely springs, from their owld course I drewe, For to refreshe the fruitfull trees that in my gardynes grewe. Of catell great encreace I bred in littell space. Bondmen I bought, I gaue them wifes, and sarued me with ther race. Great heapes of shining gold, by sparing gan I saue, With things of price so furnyshed as fitts a prince to haue. To heare faier women sing, sometyme I did reioyce; Rauyshed with ther pleasaunt tunes, and swetnes of their voyce. Lemans I had, so faier and of so liuely hewe That who so gased in their face myght well their bewtey rewe. Neuer erste sat theyr king so riche, in Dauyds seate; Yet still me thought for so smale gaine the trauaile was to great. From my desirous eyes I hyd no pleasaunt sight, Nor from my hart no kind of myrth that might geue them delyght; Which was the only freute I rept of all my payne,— To feade my eyes and to reioyce my hart with all my gaine. But when I made my compte, with howe great care of mynd And hertes vnrest that I had sought so wastfull frutt to fynde, Then was I streken strayte with that abused fier, To glorey in that goodly witte that compast my desyer. But freshe before myne eyes grace did my fawlts renewe: What gentill callings I hadd fledd, my ruyne to purswe, What raging pleasurs past, perill and hard eskape, What fancis in my hed had wrought the licor of the grape. The erroure then I sawe that their fraile harts dothe moue, Which striue in vaine for to compare with him that sitts aboue. In whose most perfect worcks suche craft apperyth playne That to the least of them, their may no mortall hand attayne; And, like as light some day dothe shine aboue the night, So darke to me did folly seme, and wysdomes beames as bright. Whose eyes did seme so clere, mots to discern and fynde, But will had clossed follies eyes, which groped like the blynde. Yet death and time consume all witt and worldly fame, And looke what ende that folly hath, and wisdome hath the same. Then sayd I thus, “Oh Lord, may not thy wisdome cure The waylfull wrongs and hard conflicts that folly doth endure?” To sharpe my witt so fine then why toke I this payne? Now finde I well this noble serche may eke be called vayne. As slanders lothsome brute soundes follies iust rewarde, Is put to silence all be time, and brought in smale regarde, Eun so dothe tyme deuoure the noble blast of fame, Which showld resounde their glories great that doo desarue the same. Thus present changes chase away the wonders past, Ne is the wise mans fattal thred yet lenger spunne to last. Then, in this wredtched vale, our lief I lothed playne, When I beheld our frutles paynes to compasse pleassurs vayne. My trauayll this a vaile hath me produced, loo! An heire unknowen shall reape the frute that I in sede did sowe. But whervnto the Lord his nature shall inclyne, Who can fore knowe, into whose handes I must my goods resine! But, Lord, how pleasannt swete then seamd the idell liefe, That neuer charged was with care, nor burdened with stryefe; And vile the grede trade of them that toile so sore, To leaue to suche ther trauells frute that neuer swet therfore. What is that pleasant gaine, which is that swet relief, That showld delay the bitter tast that we fele of our gref? The gladsome dayes we passe to serche a simple gaine, The quiete nights, with broken slepes, to fead a resteles brayne. What hope is left us then, what comfort dothe remayne? Our quiet herts for to reioyce with the frute of our payne. Yf that be trew, who may him selfe so happy call As I, whose free and sumptius spence dothe shyne beyonde them all Sewerly it is a gift and fauor of the Lorde, Liberally to spende our goods, the ground of all discorde; And wretched herts haue they that let their tressurs mold, And carrey the roodde that skorgeth them that glorey in their gold. But I doo knowe by proofe, whose ryches beres suche brute, What stable welthe may stand in wast, or heping of suche frute. 50 ECCLESIASTES 3. Like to the stereles boote that swerues with euery wynde, The slipper topp of worldely welthe by crewell prof I fynde. Skace hath the seade, wherof that nature foremethe man, Receuid lief, when deathe him yeldes to earth wher he began. The grafted plants with payn, wherof wee hoped frute, To roote them vpp, with blossomes sprede, then is our chief porsute. That erst we rered vpp, we undermyne agame; And shred the spraies whose grouthe some tyme we laboured with paine. Eache frowarde thretning chere of fortune maiks vs playne, And euery plesant showe reuiues our wofull herts againe. Auncient walles to race is our unstable guyse, And of their wether beten stones to buylde some new deuyse. New fanzes dayly spring, which vaade returning moo; And now we practyse to optaine that strayt we must forgoo. Some tyme we seke to spare that afterward we wast, And that we trauelid sore to knitt for to unclose as fast. In sober sylence now our quiet lipps we closse, And with vnbrydled toungs furth with our secret herts disclosse. Suche as in folded armes we did embrace, we haate; Whom strayte we reconsill againe and banishe all debate. My sede with labour sowne, suche frute produceth me, To wast my lief in contraries that neuer shall agree. From God these heuy cares ar sent for our vnrests, And with suche burdens for our welth he frauteth full our brests. All that the Lord hathe wrought, hath bewtey and good grace, And to eache thing assined is the proper tyme and place. And graunted eke to man, of all the worldes estate And of eache thinge wrought in the same, to argue and debate. Which arte though it approche the heuenly knowlege moste, To serche the naturall grounde of things yet all is labor loste. But then the wandering eyes, that longe for suertey sought, Founde that by paine no certayne welth might in this world be bought. Who lieuth in delight and seks no gredy thryfte, But frely spends his goods, may thinke it as a secret gifte. Fulfilled shall it be, what so the Lorde intende, Which no deuice of mans witt may advaunce, nor yet defende; Who made all thing of nought, that Adams chyldren might Lerne how to dread the Lord, that wrought suche wonders in their sight. The gresly wonders past, which tyme wearse owt of mynde, To be renewed in our dayes the Lord hath so assynde. Lo! thuse his carfull skourge dothe stele on us vnware, Which, when the fleshe hath clene forgott, he dothe againe repaire. When I in this uaine serche had wanderyd sore my witt, I saw a rioall throne wheras that Iustice should haue sitt; In stede of whom I saw, with fyerce and crwell mode, Wher Wrong was set, that blody beast, that drounke the giltles blode. Then thought I thus: “One day the Lord shall sitt in dome, To vewe his flock, and chose the pure; the spotted haue no rome.” Ye be suche skourges sent that eache agreuid mynde, Lyke the brute beasts that swell in rage and fury by ther kynde, His erroure may confesse, when he hath wreasteled longe; And then with pacience may him arme, the sure defence of wronge. For death, that of the beaste the carion doth deuoure, Unto the noble kynde of man presents the fatall hower. The perfitt forme that God hathe ether geuen to man Or other beast, dissolue it shall to earth wher it began. And who can tell yf that the sowle of man ascende, Or with the body if it dye, and to the ground decende. Wherfore eache gredy hart that riches seks to gayne, Gather may he that sauery frutte that springeth of his payne. A meane conuenient welth I meane to take in worth, And with a hand of larges eke in measure poore it fourth. For treasure spent in lyef, the bodye dothe sustayne; The heire shall waste the whourlded gold amassed with muche payne. Ne may foresight of man suche order geue in lyef, For to foreknow who shall reioyce their gotten good with stryef. 51 ECCLESIASTES 4. When I be thought me well, vnder the restles soon By foolke of power what crewell wourks unchastyced were doon, I saw wher stoode a heard by power of suche opprest, Oute of whose eyes ran floods of teares that bayned all ther brest; Deuoyde of comfort clene, in terroure and distresse, In whose defence none wolde aryse, such rigor to represse. Then thought I thus, “Oh, Lord! the dead, whose fatall hower Is clene roune owt, more happy ar, whom that the wormes deuoure; And happiest is the sede that neuer did conceue, That neuer felt the waylfull wrongs that mortall folke receue.” And then I saw that welth, and euery honest gayne By trauill woune and swete of browes, gan grow into disdayne Throughe slouthe of carles folke, whom ease so fatt dothe feade, Whose idell hands doo noght but waast the frute of other seeade; Which to them selves perswade that little gott with ease More thankefull is then kyndomes woon by trauayle and disceace. A nother sort I saw, with out bothe frend or kynne, Whose gredy wayes yet neuer sought a faithfull frend to winne; Whose wretched corps no toile yet euer wery could, Nor glutted euer wer their eyne with heaps of shyning gould. But yf it might appeare to ther abused eyne To whose a vaile they trauill so, and for whose sake they pyne, Then should they see what cause they haue for to repent The fruteles paynes and eke the tyme that they in vayne haue spent. Then gan I thus resolue, “More pleasant is the lyef Of faythefull frends that spend their goods in commone, with out stryef.” For as the tender frend appeasith euery gryef, So, yf he fall that lives alone, who shalbe his relyef? The frendly feares ly warme, in armes embraced faste; Who sleapes aloone at euery tourne dothe feale the winter blast. What can he doo but yeld, that must resist aloone? Yf ther be twaine, one may defend the tother ouer throwne. The single twyned cordes may no such stresse indure As cables brayded thre fould may, together wrethed swer. In better far estate stande children, poore and wyse, Then aged kyngs wedded to will, that worke with out aduice. In prison haue I sene, or this, a wofull wyght That neuer knewe what fredom ment, nor tasted of delyght; With such, unhoped happ in most dispaier hath mete, With in the hands that erst ware giues to haue a septure sett. And by coniures the seade of kyngs is thrust from staate, Wheron agreuyd people worke ofteymes their hidden haat. Other, with out respect, I saw, a frend or foo, With feat worne bare in tracing such, whearas the honours groo. And at change of a prynce great rowtes reuiued strange, Which, faine theare owlde yoke to discharg, reioyced in the change. But when I thought, to theise as heuy euen or more Shalbe the burden of his raigne, as his that went before, And that a trayne like great upon the deade depend, I gan conclude eache gredy gayne hath his vncertayne end. In humble spritte is sett the temple of the Lorde; Wher, yf thow enter, loke thy mouth and conscyence may accorde. Whose churtche is buylte of loue, and decte with hoote desyre, And simple fayth; the yolden hoost his marcy doth requyre. Wher perfectly for aye he in his woord dothe rest; With gentill care to heare thy sute and graunt to thy request. In boost of owtwarde works he taketh no delight, Nor wast of wourds; suche sacryfice unsauereth in his sight. 52 ECCLESIASTES 5. When that repentant teares hathe clensyd clere from ill The charged brest, and grace hathe wrought therin amending will, With bold demands then may his mercy well assaile The speche man sayth, with owt the which request may not preuaile. More shall thy pennytent sighes his endles mercy please, Then their importune siuts which dreame that words Gods wrath appease. For hart contrit of fault is gladsome recompence, And praier fruict of faythe, wherby God dothe with synne dispence. As ferfull broken slepes spring from a restles hedde, By chattering of vnholly lippis is frutles prayer bredde. In wast of wynde, I rede, vowe nought vnto the Lord, Wherto thy hart, to bynd thy will, freely doth not accord; For humble uowes fulfilld, by grace right swetly smoks, But bold behests, broken by lusts, the wrath of God prouoks. Yet bett with humble hert thy frayltye to confesse, Then to bost of suche perfitnes, whose works suche fraude expresse. With fayned words and othes contract with God no gyle; Suche craft returns to thy nown harme, and doth thy self defile. And thoughe the myst of sinne perswad such error light, Therby yet ar thy owtward works all dampned in his sight. As sondry broken dreames vs dyuerslye abuse, So ar his errors manifold that many words dothe use. With humble secret playnt, fewe words of hotte effect, Honor thy Lord; alowance vaine of uoyd desart, neglect. Thoughe wronge at tymes the right, and welthe eke nede oppresse, Thinke not the hand of iustice slowe to followe the redresse. For such unrightius folke, as rule with out dredd, By some abuse or secret lust he suffereth to be led. The cheif blisse that in earth the liuing man is lent, Is moderat welth to nourishe lief, yf he can be content. He that hath but one felde, and gredely sekethe nought To fence the tillers hand from nede, is king within his thought. But suche as of ther golde ther only idoll make, Noe treasure may the rauen of there hungry hands asslake. For he that gapes for good, and hurdeth all his gayne, Trauells in uayne to hyde the sweet that showld releue his payne. Wher is gret welth, their showld be many a nedy wight To spend the same, and that should be the riche mans cheif delight. The sweet and quiet slepes that weryd limmes oppresse, Begile the night in diet thyne, and feasts of great excesse. But waker ly the riche, whose lyuely heat with rest Their charged boolks with change of meats cannot so sone dygest. An other righteous dome I sawe of gredy gayne: With busye cares suche treasures oft preseruyd to their bayne; The plenteus howsses sackt, the owners end with shame; Their sparkelid goods; their nedy heyres, that showld reioyce the same. From welthe dyspoyled bare, from whence they came they went; Clad in the clothes of pouerte as nature furst them sent. Naked as from the wombe we came, yf we depart, With toyle to seeke that wee must leue, what bote to uexe the hart? What lyef leede testeye men then that consume their dayes In inwarde freets, untempred hates, at stryef with sum alwaies. Then gan I prayce all those, in suche a world of stryffe, As take the profitt of their goods, that may be had in lyffe. For sure the liberall hand that hath no hart to spare This fading welthe, but powres it forthe, it is a uertu rare. That maks welth slaue to nede, and gold becom his thrall, Clings not his gutts with niggishe fare, to heape his chest with all; But feeds the lusts of kynde with costely meats and wynne, And slacks the hunger and the thurst of nedy folke that pynne. Ne gluttons feast I meane in wast of spence to stryue, But temperat mealles the dulled spryts with ioye thus to reuiue. No care may perce wher myrth hath tempred such a brest; The bitter gaull, seasoned wih swet, suche wysdome may digest. 53 PSALM 8. Thie name, O Lord, howe greate is fownd before our sight! Yt filles the earthe and spreades the ayre, the great workes of thie might. For even unto thie powre the heavens have geven a place, And closyd it above their heades a mightie lardge compace. Thye prayse what clowde can hyde, but it will sheene agayne, Synce yonge and tender sucking babes have powre to shew it playne; Whiche, in despight of those that wold this glorye hide, Hast put into such infantes mowthes for to confounde their pryde. Wherefore I shall beholde thy fygurde heaven so hye, Whiche shews suche printes of dyvers formes within the clowdye skye As hills and shapes of men, eke beastes of sondrie kynde, Monstruous to our outward sight and fancyes of our mynde; And eke the wanishe moone whiche sheenes by night also, And eache one of the wondring sterres whiche after her doth goe; And how to kepe their course, and whiche are those that stands, Because they be thie wonderous workes and labours of thie hands. But yet among all theise I aske, “What thing is man, Whose tourne to serve in his poore neede this worke thow first began? Or whate is Adames sonne that beares his fathers marke, For whose delyte and compforte eke thow hase wrought all this warke? I see thow myndest hym moch that doste rewarde hym so, Beinge but earthe, to rule the earthe wheare on hymself doth go. Ffrom aungells substaunce eke, thow madeste hym differ small, Save one dothe chaunge his lif awhyle, the other not at all. The sonne and moone also, thow madeste to geve hym light, And eache one of the wandring sterrs to twynckle sparkles bright. The ayre to geve hym breathe, the water for his health, The earth to bring forth grayne and frute for to encrease his wealth. And many mettalls to, for pleasure of the eye, Whiche, in the hollow sowndyd grownd, in previe vaynes do lye. The sheepe to geve his wool, to wrapp his boddie in, And for suche other needefull thynges the oxe to spare his skynne. The horsse, even at his will, to bear hym to and fro, And as hym list eache other beaste to serve his turne also. The fysshes of the sea lykewyse, to feede hym ofte, And eke the birdes, whose feathers serve to make his sydes lye softe. On whose head thow hast sett a crowne of glorye to, To whome also thow didest appoint that honour shuld be do. And thus thow madeste hym lord of all this worke of thyne: Of man that goes; of beast that creapes, whose lookes dothe downe declyne; Of ffysshe that swymme below; of ffowles that flyes on hye; Of sea that fyndes the ayre his rayne; and of the land so drye. And underneath his feet thow hast sett all this same, To make hym know and playne confesse that marveilous is thie name. And Lord, whiche art our Lord, how merveilous is it fownd The heavens doth shew, the earth doth tell, and eke the world so rownd. Glorie therefore be geven to thee first, whiche are three, And yet but one almightie God, in substance and degree. As first it was when thow the darcke confused heape Clottid in one, didst part in fowre, which elementes wee cleape, And as the same is now, even heare within our tyme, And ever shall here after be, when we be filth and slyme.” 54 PSALM 55. Giue eare to my suit, Lord! fromward hide not thy face. Beholde, herking in grief, lamenting how I praye. My fooes they bray so lowde, and eke threpe on so fast, Buckeled to do me scathe, so is their malice bent. Care perceth my entrayles, and traueyleth my spryte; The greslye feare of death enuyroneth my brest; A tremblynge cold of dred clene ouerwhelmeth my hert. “O!” thinke I, “hadd I wings like to the symple doue. This peryll myght I flye, and seke some place of rest In wylder woods, where I might dwell farr from these cares.” What speady way of wing my playnts shold thei lay on, To skape the stormye blast that threatned is to me? Rayne those vnbrydled tungs! breake that coniured league! For I decyphred haue amydd our towne the stryfe: Gyle and wrong kept the walles, they ward both day and night; And whiles myscheif with care doth kepe the market stede; Whilst wickidnes with craft in heaps swarme through the strete. Ne my declared foo wrought me all this reproche; By harme so loked for, yt wayeth halfe the lesse, For, though myne ennemyes happ had byn for to prevaile, I cold haue hidd my face from uenym of his eye. It was a frendly foo, by shadow of good will, Myne old fere and dere frende, my guyde, that trapped me; Where I was wont to fetche the cure of all my care, And in his bosome hyde my secreat zeale to God. Such soden surprys quicke may them hell deuoure, Whilst I inuoke the Lord, whose power shall me defend. My prayer shall not cease from that the sonne disscends Till he his haulture wynn and hyde them in the see. With words of hott effect, that moueth from hert contryte, Such humble sute, O Lord, doth pierce thy pacyent eare. It was the Lord that brake the bloody compackts of those That preloked on with yre to slaughter me and myne. The euerlasting God whose kingdom hath no end, Whome, by no tale to dred he cold divert from synne, The conscyence vnquyet he stryks with heuy hand, And proues their force in fayth whome he sware to defend. Butter fales not so soft as doth hys pacyence longe, And ouer passeth fine oyle, running not halfe so smothe; But when his suffraunce fynds that brydled wrath prouoks, He thretneth wrath, he whets more sharppe then any toole can fyle. Friowr, whose harme and tounge presents the wicked sort Of those false wolves, with cootes which doo their ravin hyde, That sweare to me by heauen, the fotestole of the Lord, Who though force had hurt my fame, they did not touch my lyfe;— Such patching care I lothe as feeds the welth with lyes. But in the thother Psalme of David fynd I ease: Iacta curam tuam super dominum et ipse te enutriet. 55 PSALM 88. Oh Lorde, vppon whose will dependeth my welfare, To call vppon thy hollye name syns daye nor night I spare, Graunt that the iust request of this repentaunt mynd So perce thyne eares that in thy sight som fauour it may fynd. My sowle is fraughted full with greif of follies past: My restles bodye doth consume and death approcheth fast; Lyke them whose fatall threde thy hand hath cut in twayne, Of whome ther is no further brewte, which in their graues remayne. Oh Lorde, thow hast cast me hedling to please my fooe, Into a pitt all botomeles, whear as I playne my wooe. The burden of thy wrath it doth me sore oppresse, And sundrye stormes thow hast me sent of terrour and distresse. The faithfull frends ar fled and bannyshed from my sight, And such as I haue held full dere haue sett my frendshipp light. My duraunce doth perswade of fredom such dispaire That, by the teares that bayne my brest, myne eye sight doth appaire. Yet did I neuer cease thyne ayde for to desyre, With humble hart and stretched hands for to appease thy yre. Wherefore dost thow forbeare, in the defence of thyne, To shewe such tokens of thy power, in sight of Adams lyne, Wherby eche feble hart with fayth might so be fedd That in the mouthe of thy elect thy mercyes might be spredd? The fleshe that fedeth wormes can not thy loue declare, Nor suche sett forth thy faith as dwell in the land of dispaire. In blind endured herts light of thy lively name Can not appeare, as can not iudge the brightnes of the same. Nor blazed may thy name be by the mouth of those Whome death hath shitt in sylence, so as they may not disclose. The liuelye uoyce of them that in thy word delight Must be the trumppe that must resound the glorye of thy might. Wherfore I shall not cease, in chief of my distresse, To call on the till that the sleape my weryd lymes oppresse. And in the morning eke, when that the slepe is fledd, With floods of salt repentaunt teres to washe my restles bedd. Within this carefull mynd, bourdynd with care and greif, Why dost thow not appere, Oh Lord, that sholdest be his relief? My wretched state beholde, whome death shall strait assaile; Of one from youth afflicted still, that never did but waile. The dread, loo! of thyne yre hath trod me vnder feet; The scourgis of thyne angrye hand hath made deth seme full sweet. Like to the roring waues the sunken shipp surrounde, Great heaps of care did swallow me and I no succour found. For they whome no myschaunce could from my loue devyde Ar forced, for my greater greif, from me their face to hyde. 56 PSALM 73. Thoughe, Lorde, to Israell thy graces plentuous be— I meane to such with pure intent as fixe their trust in the—, Yet whiles the faith did faynt that shold haue ben my guyde, Lyke them that walk in slipper pathes my feet began to slyde. Whiles I did grudge at those that glorey in ther golde, Whose lothsom pryde reioyseth welth, in quiet as they wolde. To se by course of yeres what nature doth appere, The pallayces of princely fourme succede from heire to heire; From all such trauailes free as longe to Adams sede; Neither withdrawne from wicked works by daunger nor by dread, Wherof their skornfull pryde; and gloried with their eyes, As garments clothe the naked man, thus ar they clad in vyce. Thus as they wishe succeds the mischief that they meane, Whose glutten cheks slouth feads so fatt as scant their eyes be sene. Vnto whose crewell power most men for dred ar fayne To bend and bow with loftye looks, whiles they vawnt in their rayne And in their bloody hands, whose creweltye doth frame The wailfull works that skourge the poore with out regard of blame. To tempt the living God they thinke it no offence, And pierce the symple with their tungs that can make no defence. Suche proofes bifore the iust, to cawse the harts to wauer, Be sett, lyke cupps myngled with gall of bitter tast and sauer. Then saye thy foes in skorne, that tast no other foode, But sucke the fleshe of thy elect and bath them in their bloode: “Shold we beleue the Lorde doth know and suffer this? Ffoled be he with fables vayne that so abused is.” In terrour of the iust thus raignes iniquitye, Armed with power, laden with gold, and dred for crueltye. Then vayne the warr might seme that I by faythe mayntayne Against the fleshe, whose false effects my pure hert wold distayne. For I am scourged still, that no offence have doon, By wrathes children; and from my byrth my chastesing begoon. When I beheld their pryde and slacknes of thy hand, I gan bewaile the woful state wherin thy chosen stand. And as I sought wherof thy sufferaunce, Lord, shold groo, I found no witt cold pierce so farr, thy hollye domes to knoo, And that no mysteryes nor dought could be distrust Till I com to the holly place, the mansion of the iust, Where I shall se what end thy iustice shall prepare For such as buyld on worldly welth, and dye ther colours faire. Oh! how their ground is false and all their buylding vayne! And they shall fall, their power shall faile that did their pryde mayntayne. As charged harts with care, that dreme some pleasaunt tourne, After their sleape fynd their abuse, and to their plaint retourne, So shall their glorye faade; thy sword of vengeaunce shall, Vnto their dronken eyes, in blood disclose their errours all. And when their golden fleshe is from their backe yshorne, The spotts that vnder neth wer hidd, thy chosen shepe shall skorne. And till that happye daye my hert shall swell in care, My eyes yeld teares, my yeres consume bitwne hope and dispayre. Loo! how my sprits ar dull, and all thy iudgments darke; No mortall hedd may skale so highe, but wunder at thy warke. Alas! how oft my foes haue framed my decaye; But when I stode in drede to drenche, thy hands still did me stay. And in eache voyage that I toke to conquer synne, Thow wert my guyd, and gaue me grace to comfort me therin. And when my withered skyn vnto my bones did cleue, And fleshe did wast, thy grace did then my simple sprits releue. In other succour then, Oh Lord, why should I trust, But onely thyn, whom I haue found in thy behight so iust. And suche for drede or gayne, as shall thy name refuse, Shall perishe with their golden godds that did their harts seduce. Where I, that in thy worde haue set my trust and ioye, The highe reward that longs therto shall quietlye enioye. And my unworthye lypps, inspired with thy grace, Shall thus forespeke thy secret works, in sight of Adams race.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ÆNEID 57 BOOK 2. They whisted all, with fixed face attent, When prince Aeneas from the royal seat Thus gan to speak: “O Quene! it is thy wil I should renew a woe cannot be told, How that the Grekes did spoile and ouerthrow The Phrygian wealth and wailful realm of Troy: Those ruthfull things that I my self beheld, And whereof no small part fel to my share. Which to expresse, who could refraine from teres: What Myrmidon? or yet what Dolopes? What stern Ulysses waged soldiar? And loe! moist night now from the welkin falles; And sterres declining counsel vs to rest. But sins so great is thy delight to here Of our mishaps and Troyes last decay, Though to record the same my minde abhorres And plaint eschues, yet thus wil I begyn. The Grekes chieftains all irked with the war, Wherin they wasted had so many yeres And oft repulst by fatal destinie, A huge hors made, hye raised like a hill, By the diuine science of Minerua; Of clouen fir compacted were his ribbs; For their return a fained sacrifice, The fame wherof so wandred it at point. In the dark bulk they closde bodies of men Chosen by lot, and did enstuff by stealth The hollow womb with armed soldiars. There stands in sight an isle, hight Tenedon, Rich, and of fame, while Priams kingdom stood; Now but a bay, and rode vnsure for ship. Hether them secretly the Grekes withdrew, Shrouding themselues vnder the desert shore. And wening we they had ben fled and gone, And with that winde had fet the land of Grece, Troye discharged her long continued dole. The gates cast vp, we issued out to play, The Grekish camp desirous to behold, The places void and the forsaken costes. Here Pyrrhus band, there ferce Achilles pight; Here rode their shippes; there did their batteils ioyne. Astonnied, some the scathefull gift beheld, Behight by vow vnto the chast Minerue, All wondring at the hugenesse of the horse. And fyrst of all Timoetes gan aduise Wythin the walles to leade and drawe the same, And place it eke amidde the palace court; Whether of guile, or Troyes fate it would. Capys, wyth some of iudgement more discrete, Wild it to drown, or vnderset with flame The suspect present of the Grekes deceit, Or bore and gage the hallowe caues uncouth. So diuerse ranne the giddy peoples minde. Loe! formest of a rout that followd him, Kindled Laocoon hasted from the towre, Crieng far of: ‘O wreched citezens, What so great kind of frensie freteth you? Deme ye the Grekes our enemies to be gone? Or any Grekish giftes can you suppose Deuoid of guile? Is so Ulysses known? Either the Grekes ar in this timber hid, Or this an engin is to anoy our walles, To view our toures, and ouerwhelme our towne. Here lurkes some craft. Good Troyans, geue no trust Unto this horse, for, what so euer it be, I dred the Grekes; yea! when they offer gyftes!’ And with that word, with all his force a dart He launced then into that croked wombe; Which tremling stack, and shoke within the side, Wherwith the caues gan hollowly resound. And, but for Faites and for our blind forcast, The Grekes deuise and guile had he discried; Troy yet had stand, and Priams toures so hie. Therwyth behold, wheras the Phrigian herdes Brought to the king with clamor, all vnknown A yongman, bound his handes behinde his back; Whoe willingly had yelden prisoner, To frame his guile, and open Troyes gates Unto the Grekes; with courage fully bent, And minde determed either of the twaine,— To worke his feat, or willing yeld to death. Nere him, to gaze, the Troyan youth gan flock, And straue whoe most might at the captiue scorne. The Grekes deceit beholde, and by one profe Imagine all the rest. For in the preasse as he vnarmed stood, Wyth troubled chere, and Phrigian routes beset, ‘Alas!’ quad he, ‘what earth nowe, or what seas May me receyue? catif, what restes me nowe? For whom in Grece doth no abode remayne; The Troians eke offended seke to wreke Their hainous wrath, wyth shedying of my bloud.’ With this regrete our hartes from rancor moued. The brute appeasde, we askte him of his birth, What newes he brought, what hope made hym to yeld. Then he, al dred remoued, thus began: ‘O King! I shall, what euer me betide, Say but the truth; ne first will me denie A Grecian borne, for though fortune hath made Sinon a wretche, she can not make him false. If euer came vnto your eares the name, Nobled by fame, of the sage Palamede, Whom traitrously the Grekes condemd to dye, Giltlesse, by wrongfull dome, for that he dyd Dyssuade the warres,—whose death they nowe lament; Underneth him my father, bare of wealth, Into his band yong, and nere of his blood, In my prime yeres vnto the war me sent. While that by fate his state in stay did stand, And when his realm did florish by aduise, Of glorie, then, we bare som fame and brute. But sins his death by false Ulyssez sleight —I speak of things to all men wel beknown—, A drery life in doleful plaint I led, Repining at my gyltlesse frends mischaunce. Ne could I, fool! refrein my tong from thretes, That if my chaunce were euer to return Victor to Arge, to folowe my reuenge. With such sharp words procured I great hate; Here sprang my harm. Ulysses euer sithe With new found crimes began me to affray; In common eares false rumors gan he sowe; Weapons of wreke his gylty minde gan seke. Ne rested ay till he by Calchas meane— But whereunto these thanklesse tales in vaine Do I reherse, and lingre fourth the time, In like estate if all the Grekes ye price? It is enough ye here rid me at ones. Ulysses, Lord! how he wold this reioise! Yea, and either Atride would bye it dere.’ This kindled vs more egre to enquire, And to demaund the cause; without suspect Of so great mischef thereby to ensue, Or of Grekes craft. He then with forged words And quiuering limes, thus toke hys tale again. ‘The Grekes oft times entended their return Ffom Troye town, with long warrs all ytired, For to dislodge; which, would God! they had done. But oft the winter storms of raging seas, And oft the boisteous winds did them to stay; And chiefly, when of clinched ribbes of firre This hors was made, the storms rored in the aire. Then we in dout to Phebus temple sent Euripilus, to wete the prophesye. From whens he brought these woful news again: ‘With blood, O Grekes! and slaughter of a maid, Ye pleasd the winds, when first ye came to Troy. With blood likewise ye must seke your return: A Grekish soule must offred be therefore.’ ‘But when this sound had pearst the peoples eares, With sodein fere astonied were their mindes; The chilling cold did ouerrunne their bones, To whom that fate was shapte whom Phebus wold. Ulysses then amid the preasse bringes in Calchas with noyse, and wild him to discusse The gods intent. Then some gan deme to me The cruell wrek of him that framde the craft, Foreseing secretly what wold ensue. In silence then, yshrowding him from sight, But dayes twise fiue he whisted, and refused To death, by speche, to further any wight. At last, as forced by false Ulyssez crye, Of purpose he brake fourth, assigning me To the altar; whereto they graunted all, And that, that erst eche one dred to himself, Returned all vnto my wretched death. And now at hand drew nere the woful day; All things preparde wherwyth to offer me: Salt, corne, fillets my temples for to bind. I scapte the deth, I graunt, &amp; brake ye bands, And lurked in a marrise all the nyght Among the ooze, while they did set their sailes; If it so be that they in dede so dyd. Now restes no hope my natiue land to see, My children dere, nor long desired sire, On whom, parchaunce, they shall wreke my escape: Those harmlesse wights shal for my fault be slayn. ‘Then, by the gods, to whom al truth is known, By fayth vnfiled, if any any where Wyth mortal folke remaines, I thee beseche, O king, thereby rue on my trauail great; Pitie a wretch that giltlesse suffreth wrong.’ Life to these teres, wyth pardon eke, we graunt. And Priam first himself commaundes to lose His gyues, his bands, and frendly to him sayd: ‘Whoso thou art, learn to forget the Grekes; Hencefourth be oures; and answere me with truth: Whereto was wrought the masse of this huge hors? Whoes the deuise? and wherto should it tend? What holly vow? or engin for the warres?’ Then he, instruct with wiles and Grekish craft, His loosed hands lift vpward to the sterrs: ‘Ye euerlasting lampes! I testifye, Whoes powr diuine may not be violate; Thaltar and swerd,’ quod he, ‘that I haue scapt; Ye sacred bandes! I wore as yelden hoste; Leful be it for me to breke mine othe To Grekes; lefull to hate their nacion; Lefull be it to sparcle in the ayre Their secretes all, whatsoe they kepe in close; For free am I from Grece and from their lawes. So be it, Troy, and, saued by me from scathe, Kepe faith with me, and stand to thy behest; If I speak truth, and opening thinges of weight, For graunt of life requite thee large amendes. ‘The Grekes whole hope of vndertaken war In Pallas help consisted euermore. But sith the time that wicked Diomede, Ulysses eke, that forger of all guile, Auenturde from the holly sacred fane For to bereue dame Pallas fatall forme, And slew the watches of the chefest toure, And then away the holly statue stale,— That were so bold with handes embrued in blood The virgin goddesse veiles for to defile—, Sith that, their hope gan faile, their hope to fall, Their powr appeir, their goddesse grace withdraw, Whych with no doutfull signes she did declare. Scarce was the statue to our tentes ybroughte, But she gan stare with sparcled eyes of flame; Along her limes the salt sweat trickled downe; Yea, thrise her selfe—a hideous thinge to tell— In glaunces bright she glittered from the ground, Holding in hand her targe and quiuering spere. Calchas by sea then bade vs hast our flight, Whoes engins might not break the walles of Troy, Unlesse at Grece they wold renew their lottes, Restore the god that they by sea had brought In warped keles. To Arge sith they be come, They pease their godds, and war afresh prepare, And crosse the seas vnloked for eftsones They will return. This order Calchas set. ‘This figure made they for thagreued god In Pallas stede, to clense their hainous fault. Which masse he willed to be reaed hye Toward the skies, and ribbed all with oke, So that your gates ne wall might it receiue; Ne yet your people might defensed be By the good zele of old deuotion. For if your hands did Pallas gift defile, To Priams realm great mischef shold befall; Which fate the gods first on him self return! But had your owne handes brought it in your town, Asie should passe, and carrie offred war In Grece, euen to the walles of Pelops town, And we and oures that destenie endure.’ By such like wiles of Sinon, the forsworne, His tale with vs did purchace credit; some, Trapt by deceite; some, forced by his teres; Whom neither Diomede, nor great Achille, Nor ten yeres war, ne a thousand saile could daunt. Us caitifes then a far more dredful chaunce Befell, that trobled our vnarmed brestes. Whiles Laocon, that chosen was by lot Neptunus priest, did sacrifice a bull Before the holy altar, sodenly From Tenedon, behold! in circles great By the calme seas come fletyng adders twaine, Which plied towardes the shore—I lothe to tell— With rered brest lift vp aboue the seas; Whose bloody crestes aloft the waues were seen. The hinder part swame hidden in the flood; Their grisly backes were linked manifold. With sound of broken waues they gate the strand, With gloing eyen, tainted with blood and fire; Whoes waltring tongs did lick their hissing mouthes. We fled away, our face the blood forsoke; But they with gate direct to Lacon ran. And first of all eche serpent doth enwrap The bodies small of his two tender sonnes, Whoes wrectched limes they byt, and fed theron. Then raught they hym, who had his wepon caught To rescue them; twise winding him about, With folded knottes and circled tailes, his wast; Their scaled backes did compasse twise his neck, Wyth rered heddes aloft and stretched throtes. He with his handes straue to vnloose the knottes, Whose sacred fillettes all be sprinkled were With filth of gory blod, and venim rank, And to the sterres such dredfull shoutes he sent, Like to the sound the roring bull fourth loowes, Which from the halter wounded doth astart, The swaruing axe when he shakes from his neck. The serpentes twain with hasted traile they glide To Pallas temple, and her towres of heighte; Under the feete of which the goddesse stern, Hidden behinde her targettes bosse they crept. New gripes of dred then pearse our trembling brestes. They sayd Lacons desertes had derely bought His hainous dede, that pearced had with stele The sacred bulk, and throwen the wicked launce. The people cried with sondry greeing shoutes To bring the horse to Pallas temple bliue, In hope thereby the goddesse wrath tappease. We cleft the walles and closures of the towne, Whereto all helpe, and vnderset the feet With sliding rolles, and bound his neck with ropes. This fatall gin thus ouerclambe our walles, Stuft with armed men; about the which there ran Children and maides, that holly carolles sang; And well were they whoes hands might touch the cordes. With thretning chere thus slided through our town The subtil tree, to Pallas temple ward. O natiue land! Ilion! and of the goddes The mansion place! O warrlik walles of Troy! Fowr times it stopt in thentrie of our gate; Fowr times the harnesse clattred in the womb. But we goe on, vnsound of memorie, And blinded eke by rage perseuer still: This fatal monster in the fane we place. Cassandra then, inspired with Phebus sprite, Her prophetes lippes, yet neuer of vs leeued, Disclosed eft; forespeking thinges to come. We wretches, loe! that last day of our life With bowes of fest the town and temples deck. With this the skie gan whirle about the sphere; The cloudy night gan thicken from the sea, With mantells spred that cloked earth and skies, And eke the treason of the Grekish guile. The watchemen lay disperst, to take their rest, Whoes werried limes sound slepe had then opprest. When, well in order comes the Grecian fleet From Tenedon, toward the costes well knowne, By frendly silence of the quiet moone. When the kinges ship put fourth his mark of fire, Sinon, preserued by froward destinie, Let forth the Grekes enclosed in the womb; The closures eke of pine by stealth vnpind, Whereby the Grekes restored were to aire. With ioy down hasting from the hollow tree, With cordes let down did slide vnto the ground The great captaines: Sthenel, and Thesander, The fierce Ulisses, Athamas, and Thoas; Machaon first, then king Menolae; Opeas eke that did the engin forge; And streight inuade the town yburied then With wine and slepe. And first the watch is slain; Then gates vnfold to let their fellowes in; They ioyne themselues with the coniured bandes. It was the time when, graunted from the godds, The first slepe crepes most swete in wery folk. Loe! in my dreame before mine eies, me thought With rufull chere I sawe where Hector stood, Out of whoes eies there gushed streames of teares, Drawn at a cart as he of late had be, Distained with bloody dust, whoes feet were bowlne With the streight cordes wherwith they haled him. Ay me, what one! that Hector how vnlike, Which erst returnd clad with Achilles spoiles; Or when he threw into the Grekish shippes The Troian flame! so was his beard defiled, His crisped lockes al clustred with his blood, With all such wounds, as many he receiued About the walls of that his natiue town! Whome franckly thus me thought I spake vnto, With bitter teres and dolefull deadly voice: ‘O Troyan light! O only hope of thine! What lettes so long thee staid? or from what costes, Our most desired Hector, doest thou come Whom, after slaughter of thy many frends, And trauail of the people, and thy town, Alweried, lord, how gladly we behold! What sory chaunce hath staind thy liuely face? Or why see I these woundes, alas! so wide?’ He answeard nought, nor in my vain demaundes Abode, but from the bottom of his brest Sighing, he sayd: ‘Flee, flee, O goddesse son, And saue thee from the furie of this flame! Our enmies now ar maisters of the walles, And Troye town now falleth from the top. Sufficeth that is done for Priams reigne. If force might serue to succor Troye town, This right hand well mought haue ben her defense. But Troye now commendeth to thy charge Her holy reliques, and her priuy gods. Them ioyne to thee, as felowes of thy fate. Large walles rere thow for them; for so thou shalt, After time spent in thouerwandred flood.’ This sayd, he brought fourth Vesta in his hands, Her fillettes eke, and euerlasting flame. In this meane while, with diuerse plaint the town Throughout was spred; and lowder more and more The din resouned, with rattling of armes; Although mine old father Anchises house Remoued stood, with shadow hid of trees. I waked; therwith to the house top I clambe, And harkning stood I; like as when the flame Lightes in the corne, by drift of boisteous winde; Or the swift stream, that driueth from the hill, Rootes vp the feldes, and presseth the ripe corne And plowed ground, and ouerwhelmes the groue, The silly herdman all astonnied standes, From the hye rock while he doth here the sound. Then the Grekes faith, then their deceit appered. Of Deiphobus the palace large and great Fell to the ground, all ouerspred with flash; His next neighbour Ucalegon afire; The Sygean seas did glister all with flame. Upsprang the crye of men, and trompettes blast. Then, as distraught, I did my armure on, Ne could I tell yet whereto armes auailde. But with our feres to throng out from the preasse Toward the toure, our hartes brent with desire. Wrath prickt vs fourth, and vnto vs it semed A semely thing to dye, armd in the feld. Wherewith Panthus, scapte from the Grekish dartes, Otreus sonne, Phebus prest, brought in hand The sacred reliques and the vanquisht gods, And in his hand his litle nephew led; And thus, as phrentik, to our gates he ran. ‘Panthus,’ quod I, ‘in what estate stand we? Or for refuge what fortresse shall we take?’ Scarse spake I this, when wailing thus he sayd: ‘The later day and fate of Troye is come; The which no plaint or prayer may auaile. Troyans we were, and Troye was somtime, And of great fame the Teucrian glorie erst; Fierce Joue to Grece hath now transposed all. The Grekes ar lordes ouer this fired town. Yonder huge horse that stands amid our walles Sheds armed men; and Sinon, victor now, With scorne of vs doth set all things on flame. And, rushed in at our vnfolded gates Are thousands moe than euer came from Grece. And some with weapons watch the narrow stretes, With bright swerdes drawn, to slaughter redy bent. And scarse the watches of the gate began Them to defend, and with blinde fight resist.’ Through Panthus words &amp; lightning of the gods, Amid the flame and armes ran I in preasse, As furie guided me, and wher as I had heard The crye greatest that made the ayre resound. Into our band then fell old Iphytus, And Rypheus, that met vs by moonelight; Dymas and Hypanis ioyning to our side, With yong Chorebus, Mygdonius son; Which in those dayes at Troye did ariue, Burning with rage of dame Cassandraes loue, In Priams ayd and rescue of his town. Unhappy he! that wold no credit geue Unto his spouses woords of prophecie. Whom when I saw assembled in such wise, So desperatly the battail to desire, Then furthermore thus sayd I vnto them: ‘O ye yong men, of courage stout in vaine, For nought ye striue to saue the burning town. What cruel fortune hath betid, ye see; The gods out of the temples all ar fled, Through whoes might long this empire was mainteind; Their altares eke are left both wast and voyd. But if your will be bent with me to proue That vttermost that now may vs befall, Then let vs dye, and runne amid our foes; To vanquisht folk, despeir is only hope.’ With this the yongmens courage did encrease, And through the dark, like to the rauening wolues Whom raging furie of their empty mawes Driues from their den, leauing with hungry throthes Their whelpes behinde, among our foes we ran, Upon their swerdes, vnto apparant death; Holding alway the chiefe strete of the town, Couerd with the close shadowes of the night. Who can expresse the slaughter of that night, Or tell the nomber of the corpses slaine, Or can in teres bewaile them worthely? The auncient famous citie falleth down, That many yeres did hold such seignorie. With senslesse bodies euery strete is spred, Eche palace, and sacred porch of the gods. Nor yet alone the Troyan blood was shed. Manhood oft times into the vanquisht brest Returnes, wherby some victors Grekes ar slain, Cruel complaintes, and terror euery where, And plentie of grisly pictures of death. And first with vs Androgeus there met, Fellowed with a swarming rout of Grekes, Deeming vs, vnware, of that feloship, With frendly words whom thus he cald vnto: ‘Hast ye, my frendes, what slouth hath taried yow? Your feers now sack and spoile the burning Troy; From the tall ships where ye but newly come! When he had sayd and heard no answer made To him againe, wherto he might geue trust, Finding himself chaunced amid his foes, Mazde, he withdrew his foote back with his word. Like him that wandring in the bushes thick Tredes on the adder with his rechlesse foote, Rered for wrath, swelling her speckled neck, Dismayd, geues back al sodenly for fere; Androgeus so, feard of that sight, stept back, And we gan rush amid the thickest rout; When, here and there we did them ouerthrow, Striken with dred, vnskilfull of the place. Our first labor thus lucked well with vs. Chorebus then, encouraged by this chaunce, Reioysing sayd: ‘Hold fourth the way of health, My feers, that hap and manhod hath vs taught. Change we our shields; the Grekes armes do we on. Craft or manhod with foes what reckes it which? The slaine to vs their armure they shall yeld.’ And with that word Androgeus crested helme And the rich armes of his shield did he on; A Grekish swerd he girded by his side. Like gladly Dimas and Ripheus did; The whole youth gan them clad in the new spoiles, Mingled with Grekes, for no good luck to vs, We went, and gaue many onsets that night, And many a Greke we sent to Plutoes court. Other there fled and hasted to their ships, And to their costes of sauegard ran againe. And some there were, for shamefull cowardrie, Clambe vp againe vnto the hugie horse, And did them hide in his wellknowen womb. Ay me! bootelesse it is for any whight To hope on ought against will of the gods. Loe! where Cassandra, Priams daughter dere, From Pallas chirch was drawn with sparkled tresse, Lifting in vain her flaming eyen to heuen; Here eyen, for fast her tender wrestes were bound. Which sight Chorebus raging could not bere, Recklesse of death, but thrust amid the throng; And after we through thickest of the swerdes. Here were we first ybatred with the dartes Of our owne feers, from the hye temples top; Wherby of vs grete slaughter did ensue, Mistaken by our Grekish armes and crestes. Then flockt the Grekes moued with wrath and ire Of the virgin from them so rescued; The fell Aiax, and either Atrides, And the great band cleped the Dolopes. As wrastling windes, out of dispersed whirl, Befight themselues, the west with southern blast, And gladsom east proud of Auroraes horse; The woods do whiz; and fomy Nereus, Raging in furie, with three forked mace From bottoms depth doth weltre vp ye seas; So came the Grekes. And such, as by deceit We sparkled erst in shadow of the night, And draue about our town, appered first. Our fained shields and weapons then they found, And, by sound, our discording voice they knew. We went to wreck with nomber ouerlayd. And by the hand of Peneleus first Chorebus fel before the altar dead Of armed Pallas; and Rhipheus eke, The iustest man among the Troians all And he that best obserued equitie. But otherwyse it pleased now the gods. There Hipanis, and Dimas, both were slaine, Thoughpearced with the weapons of their feers; Nor thee, Panthus, when thou wast ouerthrown, Pitie, nor zele of good deuocion, Nor habit yet of Phebus hid from scathe. Ye Troyan ashes, and last flames of mine, I cal in witnesse, that at your last fall I fled no stroke of any Grekish swerd, And if the fates wold I had fallen in fight, That with my hand I did deserue it wel. With this from thense I was recuiled back With Iphytus and Pelias alone; Iphytus weke, and feble all for age, Pelias lamed by Ulissez hand. To Priams palace crye did cal vs then. Here was the fight right hideous to behold, As though there had no battail ben but there, Or slaughter made els where throughout the town. A fight of rage and furie there we saw. The Grekes toward the palace rushed fast And, couerd with engines, the gates beset, And rered vp ladders against the walles; Under the windowes scaling by their steppes, Fenced with sheldes in their left hands, whereon They did receiue the dartes; while their right hands Griped for hold thembatel of the wall. The Troyans on the tother part rend down The turrets hye and eke the palace roofe; With such weapons they shope them to defend, Seing al lost, now at the point of death. The gilt sparres and the beames then threw they down, Of old fathers the proud and royal workes. And with drawn swerds some did beset the gates, Which they did watch, and kepe in routes full thick. Our sprites restorde to rescue the kings house, To help them, and to geue the vanquisht strength. A postern with a blinde wicket there was, A common trade to passe through Priams house, On the back side wherof wast houses stood; Which way eftsithes, while that our kingdome dured, Thinfortunate Andromache alone Resorted to the parentes of her make, With young Astyanax, his grandsire to see. Here passed I vp to the hyest toure, From whense the wretched Troyans did throw down Darts, spent in waste. Unto a turret then We stept, the which stood in a place aloft, The top wherof did reache wellnere the sterres, Where we were wont all Troye to behold, The Grekish nauie, and their tentes also. With instrumentes of iron gan we pick, To seke where we might finde the ioyning shronk From that high seat; which we razed, and threw down; Which falling, gaue fourthwith a rushing sound, And large in breadth on Grekish routes it light. But sone an other sort stept in theyr stede; No stone vnthrown, nor yet no dart uncast. Before the gate stood Pyrrhus in the porche Reioysing in his dartes, with glittring armes; Like to the adder with venimous herbes fed, Whom cold winter all bolne hid vnder ground, And shining bright, when she her slough had slong, Her slipper back doth rowle, with forked tong And raised brest lift vp against the sun. With that together came great Periphas; Automedon eke, that guided had somtime Achilles horse, now Pyrrhus armure bare; And eke with him the warlike Scyrian youth Assayld the house, and threw flame to the top. And he an axe before the formest raught, Wherwith he gan the strong gates hew and break. From whens he bet the staples out of brasse, He brake the barres, and through the timber pearst So large a hole, wherby they might discerne The house, the court, the secret chambers eke Of Priamus and auncient kings of Troy, And armed foes in thentrie of the gate. But the palace within confounded was With wayling, and with rufull shrikes and cryes; The hollow halles did howle of womens plaint; The clamor strake vp to the golden sterres. The frayd mothers, wandring through the wide house, Embracing pillers, did them, hold and kisse. Pyrrhus assaileth with his fathers might, Whom the closures ne kepers might hold out. With often pushed ram the gate did shake; The postes beat down, remoued from their hookes; By force they made the way, and thentrie brake. And now the Grekes let in, the formest slew, And the large palace with soldiars gan to fill. Not so fercely doth ouerflow the feldes The foming flood, that brekes out of his bankes, Whoes rage of waters beares away what heapes Stand in his way, the coates, and eke the herdes, As in thentrie of slaughter furious I saw Pyrrhus and either Atrides. There Hecuba I saw, with a hundred moe Of her sons wyues, and Priam at the altar, Sprinkling with blood his flame of sacrifice. Fiftie bedchambers of his childrens wyues, With losse of so great hope of his ofspring, The pillers eke proudly beset with gold And with the spoiles of other nations, Fell to the ground; and whatso that with flame Untouched was, the Grekes did all possesse. Parcase yow wold ask what was Priams fate? When of his taken town he saw the chaunce, And the gates of his palace beaten down, His foes amid his secret chambers eke, Thold man in vaine did on his sholders then, Trembling for age, his curace long disused, His bootelesse swerd he girded him about, And ran amid his foes, redy to dye. Amid the court, vnder the heuen, all bare, A great altar there stood, by which there grew An old laurel tree, bowing therunto, Which with his shadow did embrace the gods. Here Hecuba, with her yong daughters all, About the altar swarmed were in vaine, Like doues that flock together in the storme; The statues of the gods embracing fast. But when she saw Priam had taken there His armure, like as though he had ben yong, ‘What furious thought, my wretched spouse,’ quod she, ‘Did moue thee now such wepons for to weld? Why hastest thow? This time doth not require Such succor, ne yet such defenders now; No, though Hector my son were here againe. Come hether; this altar shall saue vs all, Or we shall dye together.’ Thus she sayd. Wherwith she drew him back to her, and set The aged man down in the holy seat. But loe! Polites, one of Priams sons, Escaped from the slaughter of Pyrrhus, Comes fleing through the wepons of his foes, Searching, all wounded, the long galleries And the voyd courtes; whom Pyrrhus, all in rage, Followed fast to reache a mortal wound; And now in hand, well nere strikes with his spere. Who fleing fourth till he came now in sight Of his parentes, before their face fell down Yelding the ghost, with flowing streames of blood. Priamus then, although he were half ded, Might not kepe in his wrath, nor yet his words, But cryeth out: ‘For this thy wicked work, And boldnesse eke such thing to enterprise, If in the heauens any iustice be That of such things takes any care or kepe, According thankes the gods may yeld to thee And send thee eke thy iust deserued hyre, That made me see the slaughter of my childe, And with his blood defile the fathers face. But he, by whom thow fainst thy self begot, Achilles, was to Priam not so stern. For loe! he, tendering my most humble sute The right and faith, my Hectors bloodlesse corps Rendred, for to be layd in sepulture, And sent me to thy kingdome home again.’ Thus sayd the aged man, and therewithall Forcelesse he cast his weak vnweldy dart, Which, repulst from the brasse where it gaue dint, Without sound hong vainly in the shieldes bosse. Quod Pyrrhus: ‘Then thow shalt this thing report: On message to Pelide my father go, Shew vnto him my cruel dedes, and how Neoptolem is swarued out of kinde. Now shalt thow dye,’ quod he. And with that word, At the altar him trembling gan he draw, Wallowing through the blodshed of his son; And his left hand all clasped in his heare, With his right arme drewe fourth his shining sword, Which in his side he thrust vp to the hilts. Of Priamus this was the fatal fine, The wofull end that was alotted him. When he had seen his palace all on flame, With ruine of his Troyan turrets eke. That royal prince of Asie, which of late Reignd ouer so many peoples and realmes, Like a great stock now lieth on the shore; His hed and shoulders parted ben in twaine, A body now without renome and fame. Then first in me entred the grisly feare; Dismayd I was. Wherwith came to my minde The image eke of my dere father, when I thus beheld the king of equal age Yeld vp the sprite with wounds so cruelly. Then thought I of Creusa left alone, And of my house in danger of the spoile, And the estate of young Iulus eke. I looked back to seke what nomber then I might discern about me of my feeres, But weried they had left me all alone. Some to the ground were lopen from aboue, Some in the flame their irked bodies cast. There was no moe but I left of them all, When that I saw in Uestaes temple sit Dame Helen, lurking in a secret place,— Such light the flame did giue as I went by, While here and there I cast mine eyen about. For she in dred least that the Troians shold Reuenge on her the ruine of their walles; And of the Grekes the cruel wrekes also, The furie eke of her forsaken make; The common bane of Troy and eke of Grece, Hateful she sate beside the altars hid. Then boyld my brest with flame and burning wrath To reuenge my town, vnto such ruine brought; With worthy peines on her to work my will. Thought I: ‘Shall she passe to the land of Spart All safe and see Mycene her natiue land, And like a quene returne with victorie Home to her spouse, her parentes, and children, Folowed with a traine of Troyan maides, And serued with a band of Phrigian slaues; And Priam eke with iron murdred thus, And Troy town consumed all with flame, Whoes shore hath ben so oft forbathed in blood? No! no! for though on wemen the reuenge Unsemely is, such conquest hath no fame, To geue an end vnto such mischief yet My iust reuenge shal merit worthy praise; And quiet eke my minde for to be wroke On her which was the causer of this flame, And satisfie the cinder of my feers.’ With furious minde while I did argue thus, My blessed mother then appeard to me, Whom erst so bright mine eyes had neuer seen, And with pure light she glistred in the night, Disclosing her in forme a goddesse like, As she doth seme to such as dwell in heuen. My right hand then she took and held it fast, And with her rosie lips thus did she say: ‘Son, what furie hath thus prouoked thee To such vntamed wrath? what ragest thow? Or where is now become the care of vs? Wilt thow not first go see where thow hast left Anchises, thy father fordone with age? Doth Creusa liue, and Ascanius thy son? Whom now the Grekish bands haue round beset, And were they not defensed by my cure, Flame had them raught and enmies swerd ere this. Not Helens beautie hatefull vnto thee, Nor blamed Paris yet, but the gods wrath Reft yow this wealth, and ouerthrew your town. Behold,—and I shall now the cloude remoue, Which ouercast thy mortal sight doth dim, Whoes moisture doth obscure all thinges about; And fere not thow to do thy mothers will, Nor her aduise refuse thow to performe— Here, where thow seest the turrets ouerthrown, Stone bet from stone, smoke rising mixt with dust, Neptunus there shakes with his mace the walles And eke the loose foundations of the same, And ouerwhelms the whole town from his seat. And cruell Iuno with the formest here Doth kepe the gate that Scea cleped is, Nere wood for wrath, whereas she standes, and calls In harnesse bright the Grekes out of their ships. And in the turrets hye behold where standes Bright shining Pallas, all in warlike wede, And with her shield, where Gorgons hed apperes. And Iupiter, my father, distributes Auayling strength and courage to the Grekes; Yet ouermore, against the Troyan powr He doth prouoke the rest of all the gods. Flee then, my son, and geue this trauail end; Ne shall I thee forsake, in sauegard till I haue thee brought vnto thy fathers gate.’ This did she say and therwith gan she hide Herself in shadow of the close night. Then dredfull figures gan appere to me, And great gods eke agreued with our town. I saw Troye fall down in burning gledes; Neptunus town, clene razed from the soil. Like as the elm forgrown in mountaines hye, Rond hewen with axe, that husbandmen With thick assaultes striue to teare vp, doth threat; And hackt beneath trembling doth bend his top, Till yold with strokes, geuing the latter crack, Rent from the heighth, with ruine it doth fall. With this I went, and guided by a god I passed through my foes, and eke the flame; Their wepons and the fire eke gaue me place. And when that I was come before the gates And auncient building of my fathers house, My father, whom I hoped to conuey To the next hils and did him thearto treat, Refused either to prolong his life, Or bide exile after the fall of Troy. ‘All ye’, quod he, ‘in whom yong blood is fresh, Whose strength remaines entier and in ful powr, Take ye your flight. For if the gods my life wold have proroged, They had reserued for me this wonning place. It was enough, alas! and eke to much, To see the town of Troy thus razed ones; To have liued after the citee taken. When ye haue sayd, this corps layd out forsake; My hand shall seke my death, and pitie shal Mine enmies moue, or els hope of my spoile. As for my graue, I wey the losse but light, For I my yeres, disdainfull to the gods, Haue lingred fourth, vnable to all nedes, Sins that the sire of gods and king of men Strake me with thonder and with leuening blast.’ Such things he gan reherse, thus firmly bent. But we besprent with teres, my tender son, And eke my swete Creusa, with the rest Of the houshold, my father gan beseche Not so with him to perish all at ones, Nor so to yeld vnto the cruel fate; Which he refused, and stack to his entent. Driuen I was to harnesse then againe, Miserably my death for to desire. For what aduise or other hope was left? ‘Father! thoughtst thow that I may ones remoue,’ Quod I, ‘a foote, and leaue thee here behinde? May such a wrong passe from a fathers mouth? If gods will be that nothing here be saued Of this great town, and thy minde bent to ioyne Both thee and thine to ruine of this town, The way is plaine this death for to atteine. Pyrrhus shall come besprent with Priams blood, That gored the son before the fathers face And slew the father at the altar eke. O sacred mother! was it then for this That you me led through flame and wepons sharp, That I might in my secret chaumber see Mine enmies; and Ascanius my son, My father, with Creusa my swete wife, Murdred, alas! the one in thothers blood? Why, seruants, then, bring me my armes againe; The latter day vs vanquished doth call. Render me now to the Grekes sight againe, And let me see the fight begon of new; We shall not all vnwroken dye this day.’ About me then I girt my sword again, And eke my shield on my left sholder cast, And bent me so to rush out of the house. Lo! in my gate my spouse, clasping my feet, Foregainst his father yong Iulus set. ‘If thow wilt go,’ quod she, ‘and spill thy self, Take vs with thee in all that may betide. But as expert if thow in armes haue set Yet any hope, then first this house defend, Whearas thy son, and eke thy father dere, And I, somtime thine owne dere wife, ar left.’ Her shrill loud voice with plaint thus filled the house, When that a sodein monstrous maruel fell. For in their sight, and woefull parents armes, Behold a light out of the butten sprang That in tip of Iulus cap did stand; With gentle touch whoes harmlesse flame did shine Upon his heare, about his temples spred. And we afraid, trembling for dredfull fere, Bet out the fire from his blasing tresse, And with water gan quench the sacred flame. Anchises glad his eyen lift to the sterres; With handes his voice to heauen thus he bent: ‘If by praier, almighty Iupiter, Inclined thou mayst be, beholde vs then Of ruth at least; if we so much deserue, Graunt eke thine ayd, father, confirm this thing.’ Scarse had the old man said, when that the heuens With sodein noise thondred on the left hand; Out of the skie, by the dark night there fell A blasing sterre, dragging a brand or flame, Which, with much light gliding on the housetop, In the forest of Ida hid her beames; The which, full bright cendleing a furrow, shone, By a long tract appointing vs the way; And round about of brimstone rose a fume. My father vanquist, then beheld the skies, Spake to the gods, and tholly sterre adored: ‘Now, now,’ quod he, ‘no longer I abide; Folow I shall where ye me guide at hand. O native gods! your familie defend; Preserue your line. This warning comes of you, And Troy stands in your protection now. Now geue I place, and wherso that thou goe, Refuse I not, my sonne, to be thy feer.’ This did he say; and by that time more clere The cracking flame was heard throughout the walles, And more and more the burning heat drew nere. ‘Why then, haue done, my father dere,’ quod I, ‘Bestride my neck fourthwith, and sit thereon, And I shal with my sholders thee susteine, Ne shal this labor do me any dere. What so betide, come perill, come welfare, Like to vs both and common there shal be. Yong Iulus shall beare me company, And my wife shal follow far of my steppes. Now ye, my seruantes, mark well what I say: Without the town ye shall find, on an hill, An old temple there standes, wheras somtime Worship was don to Ceres the goddesse; Biside which growes an aged cipresse tree, Preserued long by our forefathers zele. Behind which place let vs together mete. And thou, father, receiue into thy handes The reliques all, and the gods of the land, The which it were not lawfull I should touch, That come but late from slaughter and blodshed, Till I be washed in the running flood.’ When I had sayd these wordes, my sholders brode And laied neck with garments gan I spred, And theron cast a yellow lions skin; And therupon my burden I receiue. Yong Iulus, clasped in my right hand, Followeth me fast with vnegal pace; And at my back my wife. Thus did we passe By places shadowed most with the night. And me, whom late the dart which enemies threw Nor preasse of Argiue routes could not amaze, Eche whispring wind hath power now to fray And euery sound to moue my doutfull mind, So much I dred my burden and my feer. And now we gan draw nere vnto the gate, Right well escapte the daunger, as me thought, When that at hand a sound of feet we heard. My father then, gazing throughout the dark, Cried on me, ’Flee, son! they ar at hand.‘ With that bright sheldes and shene armours I saw. But then, I knowe not what vnfrendly god My trobled wit from me biraft for fere, For while I ran by the most secret stretes, Eschuing still the common haunted track, From me catif, alas! bereued was Creusa then, my spouse—I wote not how, Whether by fate, or missing of the way, Or that she was by werinesse reteind, But neuer sithe these eies might her behold;— Nor did I yet perceiue that she was lost, Ne neuer backward turned I my mind, Till we came to the hill wheras there stood The old temple dedicate to Ceres. And when that we were there assembled all, She was only away, deceiuing vs, Her spouse, her son, and all her compainie. What god or man did I not then accuse, Nere wood for ire, or what more cruell chaunce Did hap to me, in all Troies ouerthrow? Ascanius to my feeres I then betoke, With Anchises, and eke the Troian gods, And left them hid within a valley depe. And to the town I gan me hye againe, Clad in bright armes, and bent for to renew Auentures past, to search throughout the town, And yeld my hed to perils ones againe. And first the walles and dark entrie I sought Of the same gate wherat I issued out, Holding backward the steppes wher we had come In the dark night, loking all round about. In euery place the vgsome sightes I saw; The silence selfe of night agast my sprite. From hense againe I past vnto our house, If she by chaunce had ben returned home. The Grekes were there, and had it all beset. The wasting fire blown vp by drift of wind Aboue the roofes, the blazing flame sprang vp, The sound wherof with furie pearst the skies. To Priams palace and the castel then I made; and ther at Iunous sanctuair, In the void porches, Pheniz, Ulisses eke, Sterne guardens stood, watching of the spoile. The richesse here were set, reft from the brent Temples of Troy: the table of the gods, The vessells eke that were of massy gold, And vestures spoild, were gatherd all in heap. The children orderly, and mothers pale for fright, Long ranged on a rowe stode round about. So bold was I to showe my voice that night, With clepes and cries to fill the stretes throughout, With Creuse name in sorrow, with vain teres, And often sithes the same for to repete. The town restlesse with furie as I sought, Thunlucky figure of Creusaes ghost, Of stature more than wont, stood fore mine eyen. Abashed then I woxe; therwith my heare Gan start right vp; my voice stack in my throte. When with such words she gan my hart remoue: ‘What helps to yeld vnto such furious rage, Swete spouse?’ quod she. ‘Without wil of the gods This chaunced not. Ne lefull was for thee To lead away Creusa hense with thee; The king of the hye heuen suffreth it not. A long exile thou art assigned to bere, Long to furrow large space of stormy seas; So shalt thou reach at last Hesperian land, Wher Lidian Tiber with his gentle streme Mildly doth flow along the frutfull felds. There mirthful wealth, there kingdom is for thee; There a kinges child preparde to be thy make. For thy beloued Creusa stint thy teres, For now shal I not see the proud abodes Of Myrmidons, nor yet of Dolopes, Ne I, a Troyan lady, and the wife Unto the sonne of Uenus, the goddesse, Shall goe a slaue to serue the Grekish dames; Me here the gods great mother holdes. And now farwell, and kepe in fathers brest The tender loue of thy yong son and myne.’ This hauing said, she left me all in teres And minding much to speake; but she was gone, And suttly fled into the weightlesse aire. Thrise raught I with mine armse taccoll her neck, Thrise did my handes vaine hold thimage escape, Like nimble windes, and like the flieng dreame. So night spent out, returne I to my feers. And ther wondring I find together swarmd A new nomber of mates, mothers, and men, A rout exiled, a wreched multitude, From eche where flockke together, prest to passe, With hart and goods, to whatsoeuer land By sliding seas me listed them to lede. And now rose Lucifer aboue the ridge Of lusty Ide, and brought the dawning light. The Grekes held thentries of the gates best; Of help there was no hope. Then gaue I place, Toke vp my sire, and hasted to the hill” This text also includes a different version of the following poem which appears in Tottel's Songes and Sonnettes, 1557. It has been omitted here. 58 BOOK 4. (Version based upon Ms. Hargrave 205) But now the wounded quene, with heavie care, Throwgh owt the vaines doth nowrishe ay ye plage, Surprised with blind flame; &amp; to her minde Gan to resort the prowes of the man, And honour of his race; whiles in her brest Imprinted stake his wordes &amp; forme of face; Ne to her lymmes care graunteth quiet rest. The next morowe, with Phoebus lampe the erthe Ylightned clere, &amp; eke the dawninge daye The shadowe danke gan from the pole remove, When, all vnsownd, her sister of like minde Thus spake she to: “Oh sister, what dremes Be these that me tormenten thus afraide? What newcome gest vnto our realme ys come; What one of chere; how stowt of hart in armes? Truelie I thinke, ne vaine ys my beleife, Of goddishe race some of springe shuld he seeme: Cowardie noteth hartes swarved owt of kinde. He driven, Lord! with how hard destinie; What battells eke atcheived did he tell! &amp; but my mind war fixt vnmovablie Never with wight in weddlocke for to joine, Sithe my first love me lefte by deth disseverid, Yf bridall bowndes &amp; bed me lothed not, To this one fawlt perchaunce yet might I yeld. For I wyll graunt, sithe wretched Syches dethe My spouse &amp; howse with brother slaughter stand, This onelie man hath made my senses bend &amp; pricketh furthe the minde that gan to slide: Felenglie I tast the steppes of mine old flame. But first I wishe the erth me swallowe downe, Or with thunder the mightie Lord me send To the pale gostes of hell and darkness depe, Or I the stayne, shamefastnes, or thi lawes. He that with me first coopled, tooke awaie My love, which still enioye he in his grave.” Thus did she saye, &amp; with surprised teares Bayned her brest. Whereto thus An replied: “O sister more beloved then the light, Thi youth all sole in plaintes wilt thow nedes spill? Ne children swete, ne Venus giftes wilt knowe? Cindres, thinkest thow, minde this, or graved ghostes? Time of thie dole, thi spouse new dedd, I graunt None might the moue; Iarbas not to fere, The Libian king dispised eke by the, &amp; other princes moe, whom the riche soyle Of Aefrike bredes, in honours tryvmphant. Wilt thow allso withstand the loue that likes the? Come not to minde vpon whose land thow dwelst? On this syde, loe! the Getule towns behold, A people bold, vnvanquished in warr; Eke the vndaunted Numides compas the; Allso the Syrtes vnfrindlie harboroughes. On tother hand the desert realme of Scythe, The Barceans, whose furie stretcheth wide. What shall I touch the wars that moue from Tyre, Or yet thie brothers threates? By godes purveiaunce yt blue, &amp; Junos helpe, The Troiane shippes, I thinke, to rounne this course. Sister, what towne shalt thow se this become? Throwgh such alie how shall our kingdome rise, &amp; by the ayde of Troiane armes how great? How manie waies shall Carthage glorie growe? Thow onelie now beseke the godes of grace By sacrifice. Which ended, to thie howse Receave him, &amp; forge causes of abode; Whiles winter freates the seas, &amp; watrie Orion, The shippes shaken, vnfrindlie the season.” Such wordes inflamde the kindled hart with love, Lewsed all shame, &amp; gaue the dowtfull hope. &amp; to the temples fyrst thei hast &amp; seke By sacrifice for grace, with hogreles of two yeares Chosen, as owght, to Coeres that gaue lawes, To Phoebus, Bacchus, &amp; to Juno cheif, Which hath in care the bandes of mariage. Fair Dido held in her right hand the cupp, Which twixt the hornes of a white cowe she shedd In presence of the godes, passing before The aultres tall, which she renued ofte With giftes that daye &amp; bestes deboweled, Gasing for cownsell on the thentrailes warme. Ay me, vnskillfull myndes of prophetise! Alas, blind mindes of prophetes! what avayle Temples or vowes, what booten thei in rage? A gentle flame the marie doth devower, Whiles in the brest the sylent wound kepth life. Vnhappi Dido burnes, &amp; in her rage Throwgh owt the towne she wandreth vp and downe; Like to the stryken hinde with shafte in Crete, Throwgh owt the woodes, which, chasing with his dartes, Aloofe, the shepard smyteth at vnwares, &amp; leaves vnwiste in her the thirling hedd, That throwgh the groves &amp; laundes glides in her flight, Amidd whose syde the mortall arrowe stykes. Aeneas now abowt the walls she leades, The towne preparde &amp; Carthage welth to showe; Offring to speake, amidd her voice, she whistes. &amp; when the daye gan fayle, new feastes she makes; The Troiane travailes to here anew she listes, Enraged all, &amp; stareth in his face That tells the tale. And when thei war all gone, &amp; the dymme moone repressed the daie light, &amp; slidinge sterres provoked vnto slepe, Alone she moornth within her palaice voide, &amp; settes her downe on her for saken bedd, &amp; absent him she heres, when he is gone, &amp; seithe eke. Ofte in her lappe she holds Askanius, trapte by his fathers fourme, To proue if she might so beguile her loue. The turretes now arise not, erst begoune; Nether the youth weeldes armes, nor they avaunce The port, nor other mete defence for warr. Broken thei hang, the workes &amp; mightie frames Of walls hie raised, sthretching to the skie. Whom as soone as Ioves dere wife saw infect With such a plague, ne fame resist the rage, Saturnus dowghter bourdes thus with Venus than: “Great praise”, quod she, “&amp; worthie spoiles ye winne, You &amp; your sonn, great godes of memorie, By bothe your wiles one woman to devower. Yet am I not deceyved, that foreknew Ye dredd our walles &amp; buyldinges did suspect Of hie Carthage. But what shalbe the end? Or whervnto now serveth such debate? But rather peace &amp; brydall bondes knitt we, Syth thow hast spedd of that thie hart desyred. Dido doth burne, the rage her bones doth perse. The people now then common to vs bothe; With egall favour so lett vs governe them. Lefull be it to serve a Troiane spouse; &amp; Tyrians yeld to thie right hand in dower.” To whom Venus replied thus, that knew Her wordes proceded from a fayned minde, To Lybian costes to turne the prince from Rome: “What wight so fond such offer to refuse? Or yet with the had lever lyve in warr? So be it fortune thi tale bring to effect. But destenies I dowte, lest Jove will graunt That folke of Tyer, &amp; such as came from Troie, Shuld hold one towne; or graunt these nations Mingled to be, or joined aye in league. Thow art his wief; lefull yt is for the For to attempt his fancie by request. Passe on before &amp; followe the I shall.” Quene Juno then tooke thus her tale againe: “This travaile be yt mine. But by what meane, Marke, in few wordes I shall the lerne eftsones, This work in hand maie now be compassed. Aeneas now, &amp; wretched Dido eke, The forest till a hunting minde to wend The morow, as soone as Titan shall ascend, &amp; with his beames hath overspredd the erth. &amp; whiles the range doth sett the groues about, A clowdie shower, mingled with haile, I shall Pooer down, &amp; then with thunder shake the skies. The assembles skattered, the mistes shall cloke. Dido the cave, the Troiane prince the same Shall enter too, &amp; I wilbe at hand. &amp; if thie will stick vnto mine, I shall In weddlocke suer knitt, &amp; make her his owne: This shall the mariage be.” To whose request Without debate Venus did seeme to graunt, &amp; smyled softe, as she that fownd the wile. Then from the sea the dawning gan arise. The son hoist vp, the chosen youth gan throng Vnto the gates: the hayes so rarelie knitt, The hunting staves with ther brode heddes of yron, &amp; of Massile the horsemen, furth thei breke; Of senting howndes a kennell huge likewise. &amp; at the thressolde of her chamber dore The Carthage lordes did on ther quene awaite; The trampling steed, with gold &amp; purple deckt, Feirslie stood chawing on the fominge bitt. Then issued she, awaited with a trayne, Clad in a cloke of Tyre bordered full rich. Her quyver hong behind her backe, her tresse Knotted in gold, her purple vesture eke Butned with gold. The Troianes of her trayne Before her go, with gladsome Iulus. Aeneas eke, the goodliest of the rowt, Makes one of them &amp; ioyneth close the thronges. Like when Apollo leaveth Licia, His wintring place, &amp; Xanthus fluddes likewise, To se Delos, his mothers mansion, For to repayer &amp; furnishe new her quyer, The Cretians &amp; folke of Driopes, &amp; painted Agathirth, do howle &amp; crie, Environninge the aulters rownd abowt, When that he walkes vpon mownt Cynthus topp, His sparkled tresse represt with garlandes softe Of tender bowes, &amp; tressed vp in golde, His quyver dartes clattringe behind his backe: So freshe &amp; lustie did Aeneas seme, Such lordlie port in cowntinance dothe showe. But to the hills &amp; wilde holtes when thei came, From the rockes toppe the wild savage rooes Availe the hill, &amp; on the other syde, Over the laundes, thei gan to take ther course. The hartes likewise, in troopes taking ther flight, Raising the dust, the mountaynes fast forsoke. The child Iulus, blithe of his swifte steed, Amides the playne now prickes by them, now these, &amp; to encounter wisheth ofte in minde The foming bore, in stedd of ferefull beastes, Or lyon browne might from the hill discend. In the meane while the heavens gan romble sore; In tayle wher of a mingled shower with haile. The Tirian folke &amp; skattred Troiane youth &amp; Venus nevew the cottages for fere Sought rownd about; the fluddes fell from the hills. Quene Dido, with the Troiane prince alone, Chanst on a denn. Our mother then, the Erth, &amp; Juno that hath charge of mariage, First tokens gave with burning gledes of flame, &amp;, previe to the weddlocke, lightning skies; &amp; the nymphes wayled from the mountaynes toppe. Aye me! this was the foremost daye of myrthe, &amp; of mischief the first occasion eke. Respect of fame no lenger her with holdes, Ne museth she to frame her loue be stelth. Wedlock she calls it; vnder the pretence Of which faier name she cloketh now her fault. Furthwith Fame flies throwgh the greet Libian townes; A mischief Fame—ther is none ells so swifte— That moving, growes; &amp; flitting, gethers strength. First small to dredd, soone after climes the skies, Percing the erth, &amp; hides her hedd in clowdes. Whom our mother, the Erth, tempted by wrathe Of godes, begat; the last sister—thei write— To Caeus and Inceladus. Speedie of foote, of wing likewise right swifte; A monster thing &amp; dreddfull to behold: For everie plume that on her bodie stickes As manie waker eies lurke vnderneth; A thing in deed much mervaylous to here, So manie mowthes to speke, &amp; listning eares. By night she flieth amidd the clowdie skie, Shriking, by the darke shadowe of the erth, Ne once her eies to swete slepe doth encline. By daye she sittes to marke on the howse toppes Or turrettes hie, &amp; the great townes she frayes, Mindfull of yll &amp; lies as blasing truth. This monster blith with manie a tale gan sowe This rumor then into the common eares, As well thinges done as that was never wrought: As, that there comen is to Tyrians court Aeneas, that of Troiane bludd is sprong, To whom faier Dido wold her self be wedd; In natures lustes the winter for to passe, This in ech mowth the filthie goddes spredd, &amp; takes her course to king Iarbas straight; Kindling his minde, with tales she fedd his wrathe. Gotten he was by Hammon Jupiter Vpon the ravisht Garamantida. An hundred temples in his realme he buylte, An hundred aulters kepte with waker fyer, A watche allwaies on the goddes to attende; The erth imbrued with yelded blood of bestes, &amp; thresholdes spredd with garlandes strange of hew. He, wood of minde, kindled by bitter bruites, Fore the aultars, in presence of the godes, With reared handes gan humblie Ioue entreate: “Allmighti lord, whom the Moors nacion, Fede at riche tables, presenteth with wine, Seest thow these thinges? or serue we the in vayne, When thow lettes fle the thunder from the clowdes, Whose flames oft chaunce with vaine noise vs afraye? A wandring woman in our coostes hath bowght A plott for price, wher she a village sett; To whom we gaue the strond for to manure, &amp; lawes the towne to rule; our weddlock lothe, Hath chose Aeneas to commaund her realmes. That Paris now, with his vnmanlie sorte, With mytred hattes, with oynted bushe &amp; bearde, His rape inioyes; whiles to thie temple we Our offringes bring &amp; hallowe rumours vayne.” Whom prayeng in such sort &amp; gryping eke The aulters fast, the mightie father harde, &amp; wrythed his looke towardes the royall walls &amp; lovers eke, forgetting ther good name. To Mercurie then gaue he thus in charge: “Hence, sonne, in hast! &amp; call to the windes! Slide with thie plumes &amp; tell the Troiane prince, That now in Carthage loytreth reckleslie, Of the townes graunted him by destenie. Swifte throwgh the skies se thow these wordes reporte. His faire mother behight him not to vs. Such one to be, ne therfor twise him savde. From Greekishe armes, but Italie to rule, Dreddfull in armes, &amp; chargde with seigniorie, Discovering his worthie Tewcrine race, &amp; vnder lawes the whole world to subdue. If glorie of such thinges nowght him enflame, Ne that he list seke honour by some payne, The turrettes yet of Roome doth he envie, That is the father of Ascanius? What mindeth he to frame? or by what hope In inmies land doth he make his abode? Ne his ofspring in Italie regardes? Ne yet the lond of Lavine doth behold? Bidd him make sayle; haue here the summ &amp; ende. Our message thus report.” When Iove had said, Then Mercurie gan bend him to obeye His mightie fathers will; &amp; to his heeles His golden winges he knittes, which him transport With a light winde aboue the erthe &amp; sees. &amp; then with him his wande he tooke, wherby He calls from hell pale ghostes, &amp; other some Thither he sendeth allso comefortles; Wherby he forcethe slepes &amp; bereaves them; &amp; mortall eies he closethe vp in dethe. By pooer wherof he dryves the windes awaie, &amp; passeth eke amidd the trowbled clowdes, Till in his flight he gan descriue the topp &amp; steepie flankes of rockie Athlas hill, That with his crowne sustaines the welkin vp; Whose hedd, forgrowen with pine, circled allwaie With mistie clowdes, beaten with winde &amp; stormes; His showlders spredd with snowe; &amp; from his chinn The springes discende, his berd frosen with yse. Here Mercurie with egall shininge winges Fyrst towched, &amp;, with bodie heddlong bent, To the water thence took he his discent, Like to the fowle that endlonge coostes &amp; strondes, Swarming with fishe, flies swymming by the sea. Cutting betwixt the windes &amp; Libian sandes, From his graundfather by the mothers syde The Cylen childe so came, &amp; then alight Vpon the howses with his winged feete, Tofore the towers, wher he Aeneas saw Fowndacouns cast &amp; rearinge buyldinges new, Gyrt with a sworde of iasper, starrie bright; Of Tyrian purple hynge his showldres downe His shininge pawle of mightie Didos gifte, Striped throwgh owt with a thinn threde of golde. Then thus he sayd: “Thow, that of highe Carthage Dost the fowndacouns laye to please thie wife, Raising on height a passing fayer citie! But oh, for woe; thine owne thinges owt of minde! From the bright skies the ruler of the godes Sent me to the, which with his becke commaundes Both heaven &amp; erth; in hast he gaue me charge Throw the light ayer this message the to saye: What buildest thow, or by what hope thy time In idlenes thus wastes in Afrike land? Of so great thinges if not the fame the sturr, Ne lust by honour thie travaile to pursue, Ascanius yet, that thriveth fast, behold, &amp; the hope of Iulus seede, thine heire, To whom the realme of Italie belongeth &amp; soyle of Rome.” When Mercurie had said, Amid his tale, farr of from mortall eies Into light ayer he vanisht owt of sight. Aeneas, with that vision stryken downe, Well ner bestraught, vp start his herre for dred; Amid his throte his voice likewise gan sticke. For to depart by flight he longeth now, &amp; that swete land to leave, astonied sore By thadvice &amp; message of the godes. What may he do, alas! or by what wordes Dare he perswade the raging quene in loue? Or in what sort may he his tale begin? Whiles here, now ther his restles minde gan ronne, &amp; diverslie him drawes, discoursing all. After long dowbte this sentence semed best: Mnestheus first, &amp; strong Cleanthus eke, He calls to him, with Sergest; vnto whom He gave in charge his navie secretlie For to prepare, &amp; drawe to the sea coostes His people, &amp; his armour to addres, &amp; for the change of thinges to faine excuse, &amp; that he wold, when Dido lest foreknew Or did suspect so great a love coold breke, Awaite a tyme to speke therof most mete; The nearest waie to hasten his entent. Gladlie his will &amp; biddinges thei obeie. Full soone the Quene this craftie sleight gan smell, —Who can deceaue a lover in forecast?— &amp; first foresees these mocions for to come, Ye most assured fearing; vnto whom That wicked Fame reported how the flete Was armed new, all readie to avale. Then yll bestedd of cownsell, rageth she, &amp; whisketh throwgh the towne like Bacchus nonne, As Thyas sturrs, the sacred rites begonne, When the wonted third yeres sacrifice Doth prick her furth, hering Bacchus name halowed, &amp; when the feastfull night of Cytheron Doth call her owt, with noise of her dawnsing. At length her self thus boordes Aeneas with: “Vnfaithfull wight, to colour such a flight! &amp; cooldst thow hope vnwist to leave my land? Not the our love, nor yet right hand betrothde, Ne crwell dethe of Dido may with hold, But that thow wilt in winter shippes prepare &amp; take the seas in broyle of raging windes? What if the land thow sekest war not strange, Yf not vnknowen, or auncient Troie stoode, In rowghe seas yet shuld Troie of the be sought? Shunnist thow me? by these teares &amp; right hand— For nowght ells haue I wretched lefte my self—, By our spowsailes &amp; mariage begoune, If I of the deserued ever well, Or thing of mine war ever to the leefe, If to request that enie place be lefte, Rue on this realme, whose ruine ys at hand, I the beseche, &amp; do awaie this minde. The Libian folke &amp; tyrantes Numydanne For the me hate; my Tryians eke are wrothe; My shamefastnes eke stayned for thi cause, &amp; good renowne, wherby vp to the starrs Pereles I clambe. To whom wilt thow me leaue, Readie to die, O my swete gest, syth this name Ys all, as now, that of a spowse remaines? But wherto now shuld I prolong my dethe? What? vnto my brother Pigmalion Bete downe my walls? or the Getulian king Iarbas yet captive lead me awaie? Before thie flight a child had I conceaved, Or saw a yong Aeneas in my court Play vp and downe, that did present thie face, All vtterlie I coold not seme forsaken.” Thus sayd the quene. He, to the godes advice, Vnmoved held his eies, &amp; in his brest Represt his care &amp; stroue against his will, &amp; these wordes few at lengthe furth gan he cast: “Never shall I denie, quene, thie desertes, Greater then thow in wordes may well expres. To thinke on the ne yrke me ay it shall, Whiles of my self I shall haue memorie, &amp; whiles the sprite these limmes of mine shall rule. It is not great the thing that I requyer. Nether ment I to cloke the same by stelth, Slaunder me not, ne to eskape by flight. Ne I to the pretended mariage, Ne hither cam to joine me in such league. Yf destenie at mine owne libertie To lead my life woold haue permitted me, After my will my sorowes to redowble, Troie &amp; the remainder of all my folke Restore I shuld, &amp; with these scaped handes Ther walls againe vnto the vanquished, &amp; palaice hie of Priam eke repayer. But now Apollo, called Gryneus, &amp; prophecies of Licia me bidd To sease vpon the realme of Italie; That is my loue, my countrie, &amp; my land. Yf Carthage turretes the, of Phenis land, &amp; of a Libian towne the sight detaynes, To vs Troianes whie dost thow then envie In Italie to make our rested ende? Lefull it is for vs strang realmes to seke. As ofte as night doth cloke with shadowe danke The erthe, as oft as flaming sterrs appere, The troobled ghost of my father Anchises So ofte in slepe doth feare &amp; advice me, &amp; wronged hedd by me of my dere sonne, Whom I defraude of the Hesperian crowne &amp; landes allotted him by destenie. The messenger eke of the godes but late, Sent downe from Iove—I swere by either hedd—, Passing the aier, did this to me reporte. In bright daie light the god my self I sawe Entre these walls, &amp; with these eares him hard. Leave then with plaint to vexe both the &amp; me; Against my will to Italie I goe.” Whiles in this sort his tale he did pronownce, With wayward looke she gan him aie behold, With rowling eies that moved to &amp; fro, With sylent looke discoursing over all. &amp; furth at last in rage thus gan she brayde: “Faithless! foresworne! thie dame ne goddes was, Nor Dardanus beginner of thie race, But soor hard rockes mownt Caucase monstruous Bredd the, &amp; tettes of tygres gaue the sucke. But what shuld I dissemble now my chere, Or me reserue to hope of greater thinges? Shedd he one teare, or ever movde his eien? Wepte he for ruth, or pitied our loue? What shall I sett before, or wher beginne? Iuno, ne Iove, with iust eies this beheld. Faith is no wher; no surete is to be fownde. Did I not him, throwen vp vpon my shore, In nede receaue, &amp; fownded eke invest Of half my realme; his navie lost, repayer; From dethes daunger his felowes eke defende? Aie me! with rage of furies, lo! I driue. Apollo now, now Lician prophecies, An other while the messenger of godes, He saith, sent downe from mightie Iove him self, This dreddfull charge amidd the skies hath browght. As thowgh that were the travaile of the godes, Or such a care ther quietnes might moue! I hold the not, nor yet gainsaye thie wordes; To Italie passe on by helpe of windes, &amp; throwgh the fluddes go serche thi kingdome new. Yf rufull godes haue enie power, I trust Amidd the rockes thie hyer shalt thow fynde, When thow shalt clepe full oft on Didos name. With buriall brandes I, absent, shall the chase, &amp; when cold dethe from life these lymmes devide, My ghost ech wher shall still on the awaite. Thow shalt abie, &amp; I shall here thereof; Among the sowles bylowe this bruite shall come.” With such like wordes she cutt of half her tale, With pensife hart abandoninge the light, &amp; from his sight her self gan farr remoue, Forsaking him, that manie thinges in feare Imagyned, &amp; did prepare to saye. Her sowning lymmes her damsells gan releue, &amp; to her chamber bare of marble stone, &amp; layd her on her bedd with tapistes spredd. But iust Aeneas, thowgh he did desyer With comfort swete her sorrowe to appease, &amp; with his wordes to bannishe all her care, To waile her much with grete love ouercome, By the godes will yet workes he, &amp; resortes Vnto his navie, wher the Troianes fast Fell to ther worke, from the shore to vnstocke Highe charged shippes. Now fleetes the talowed kele. Ther ores with leaues yet grene from woode thei bringe, &amp; mastes vnshauen, for hast to take ther flight. Ye might haue seen them throng owt of the towne Like antes, when thei do spoile the binge of corne For winters dredd, which thei bear to their denne, When the blake swarme creepes ouer all the feeldes, &amp; thwart the grasse by straight pathes dragg ther praye. The gret graynes then somme on ther showlders trusse, Some driue the troope, some chastice eke the slowe; With ther travaile chaffed ys euerie path. Beholdinge thus, what thowght might Dido haue! What sighes gaue she, that from her towers of height The large coostes saw haunted with Troians werkes, &amp; in her sight the seas with dynne confownded! O wittles loue, what thing is that to do A mortall minde thow canst not force therto! Forced she is to teares ay to returne, By new requestes to yeld her hart to loue. &amp; lest she shuld before her causeles dethe Leave enie thing vntried: “O Sister An,” Quod she, “behold the whole coost rownd abowt, How thei prepare, assembled everie wher; The streminge sayles abyden but for windes; The shippmen crowne ther shippes with bowes for ioie. O sister, if so great a sorrowe I Mistrusted had, it wear more light to beare. Yet natheles, this for me wretched wight, An, shalt thow doe, for faithles, the alone He reverenced, &amp; eke his secrettes told. The metest tymes thow knew to boorde the man; To my prowd foe thus, sister, humblie saye: I with the Grekes in the port Aulide Coniured not, the Troianes to destroie; Nor to the walls of Troie yet sent my fleete; Nor cynders of his father Anchises Disturbed, aye owt of his sepulture. Whie lettes he not my wordes synk in his eares So hard for to intreat? whither wholes he? This last boone yet graunte he to wretched loue: Prosperous windes for to depart with ease Let him abide. The foresaid marriage now, That he betraide, I do not him requyer, Nor that he shuld faire Italie forgoe; Nether I woold he shuld his kingdome leaue; Quiet I aske, &amp; a tyme of delaye, &amp; respite eke my furie to aswage, Till my mishappe teach me, all comefortles, How for to waile my greif. This latter grace, Sister, I craue; haue thow remorse of me! Which, if thow shalt vouchsafe, with heapes I shall Leave by my dethe well rendred vnto the.” Mingled with teares thus wretched gan she plaine; Which An reportes, &amp; answer bringes againe. Nowght teares him moue, ne yet vnto my wordes He harkyns, thowgh that he war milde of kynde. Destenie withstandes; a god stoppes his meke eares. Like to the aged boistrous bodid oke, Amidd the Alpes, which that the northren windes, That now from this, now from that quarter blowe, Betwixt them striue to overwhelme with blast; The whistling ayer amongest the braunches rores, Which all at ones bowe to the erthe hys croppes, The stocke onste smyte; whiles in the rockes the tree Stikes fast; &amp; looke! how hie to heaven his topp Reares vy, as deepe his roote spredes downe to hell: So was this lord now here, now ther besett With wordes, in whose stowt brest wrowght maine cares. But still his minde in one remaynes; for nowght The teares werr shed. Then Dido, frayd of fates, Wisheth for dethe, yrkenge to se the skies. &amp; that she might the rather worke her will, &amp; leaue the light—a greislie thing to tell—, Vpon the aulters, burninge full of sence, When she sett giftes of sacrifice, she sawe The holie water stockes waxe blake within; The wine eke shedd, changde into filthie geare; Which she to none, ner to her sister told. A marble temple in her palaice eke, In memorie of her old spouse, ther stoode, In great honour &amp; wurshippe, which she held, With snow white clothes deckt, &amp; with bowes of feast; Wher oft was hard her husbondes voice, &amp; speche Clepinge for her, when derke night hidd the erth. &amp; oft the owle with rufull song complaind From the howse topp, to drawe his plaining tunes. &amp; manie thinges, forspoke by prophetes past, Of dreddfull warninges gan her now afraye, &amp; sterne Aeneas semed in her slepe To chase her still abowt, bestraught in rage. &amp; still her thowght that she was left alone Vnwaited on great voiages to wende, In desert land her Tyrian folke to seke. Like Pentheus, that in his maddnes sawe Swarminge in flockes the furies all of hell, Two souns remoue, &amp; Thebes towne showde twaine; Or like Orestes, Agamemnons sonne, In tragedies who representeth aie Driven abowt, that from his mother fledd With armed brandes, &amp; eke with serpentes blake; That sitting fownd within the temples porche Th uglie furies his slaughter to revenge. Yolden to woe, when frensie had her caught, Within her self then gan she well debate, Full bent to dye, the tyme &amp; eke the meane; &amp; to her wofull sister thus she sayd, In owtward chere dissembling her entent, Presentinge hope vnder a semblant glade: “Sister, reioice! for I haue fownd the waie Him to returne, &amp; loose me from his loue. Toward the ende of the occean fludd, Wheras the sonne descendeth &amp; declines, In thextremes of Aethiope, is a place Wher huge Atlas doth on his showlders turne The sphere so rownd, with flaming sterrs besett; Borne of Massile, I here, shuld be a nonne, Of the Hesperian sisters temple old The garder, that giues the dragon foode That on the tre preserues the holie fruite Which honie moist &amp; sleping popey cast. This woman doth avaunt, by force of charmes, What hart she list to sett at libertie, &amp; other some to perse with heavie care; In ronning floode to stopp the waters course, &amp; in the sterrs ther order to reverse; The ghostes that walke by night eke to assemble. Vnder thie foote the earth thow shalt behold Tremble &amp; rore, the okes fall from the hills. The godes &amp; the, dere sister, now I call In wittnes, &amp; thie hedd to me so swete, To magike art against my will I bend. Right secretlie within our inner court, In open aier reare vp a stacke of woode, &amp; hang ther on the weapon of this man, The which he lefte within my chamber sticke. His weedes despoiled all, &amp; brydall bedd, Wherein, alas! sister, I fownd my bane, Charge ther vpon; for so the nonne commaundes, To do awaie what so did him belong, Of that false wight that might remembrance bring.” Then whisted she; the pale her face gan staine. Ne coold yet An beleue her sister ment To cloke her dethe by this new sacrifice, Nor in her brest such furie did conceaue; Nether doth she now dredd more grevous thinges Then folowed Sycheus dethe, wherefor She puttes her will in vre. But the quene, when the stacke was reared vp Vnder the aier within the open court, With cloven oke &amp; billettes made of fyrr, With garlandes then she doth besett the place, &amp; with grene bowes eke crowen the funerall; &amp; ther vpon his weedes &amp; sword forsake, &amp; over his bedd his picture she bestowes, As she that well foreknew what was to come. The aulters stand abowt, &amp; eke the nonne With sparkled tresse; the which iii C godes With a lowd voice doth thunder owt at once, Herebus greislie, &amp; Chaos eke, With the threfold goddes Proserpine, &amp; thre figures of Dian the virgine; &amp; sprinkles eke the water counterfayte, Vnto the blake Avernus lake in hell. Weare sought, after the right course of the moone; &amp; springing herbes reaped with brasen sighes Ther venime blake entermingled with mylke; The lompe of fleshe twene the new borne fols eien To weane her from her dames loue. She, with the milk in bothe her handes devoute, Stoode nere the aulter, bare on the one foote, With vesture loose, the bandes vnlaced all; Bent for to dye, calls the godes to record, &amp; gyltie sterrs eke of her destenie. &amp; if that ther werr enie god had care Of lovers trwe, vnequall in behest, Him she requires of iustice to remember. Yt was the night that sownd &amp; quiet rest Had throwgh the erth the wearied bodies caught; The woodes, the raging seas war fallen to rest; When that the starrs had half ther course declinde; The feldes whiste, beastes, &amp; fowles of dyvers hwe, &amp; what so that in the brode slowghes remaine, Or yet amonges the busshie thickes of bryer, Laid downe to slepe by sylence of the night, Gan swage ther cares, mindles of travailes past. Not so the sprite of this Phenician, Vnhappie she, that on no slepe coold chaunce, Nor yet nightes rest in eie nor brest coold entre; Her cares redowble; loue rise &amp; rage againe, &amp; ouerflowes with swelling stormes of wrathe. Thus thinkes she then, thus rowles she in her minde: “What shuld I do? shall I now beare the skorne For to assaye myne old wooers againe, Or humblie yet a Numyde spouse require, Whose mariage I haue so ofte disdainde? The Troiane navie, &amp; Teuchryn vile commaundes Follow shall I, as thowgh it shuld availe, That whilome by mie helpe thei war releved? Or for bycause with kynd &amp; mindfull folke Right well doth sitt the passed thankfull dede? Who woold me suffer—admitt this war my will—, Or skorned me to ther prowd shippes receaue? Oh, woe begon, full litle doest thow knowe Or smell the broken othes of Laomedus kinde! What then? alone with merie maryners Shall I awaite, or boorde them with my power Of Tyrians, assembled me abowt? &amp; such as I with travaile browght from Tyre, Driue to the seas, &amp; force them sayle againe? But rather dye, even as thow hast deserved, &amp; to this woe with yron geve thow ende! &amp; thow, sister, first vanquisht with my teares, Thow in my rage with all these mischiefes fyrst Did burden me, &amp; wisht me to my foe. Was it not graunted me, from spousailes fre, Like to wild bestes, to lyve with owt offence, With owt tast of such cares? Is ther no faith Reserude to the cynders of Sycheus? Such great complaintes brake furth owt of her brest; Whiles that Aeneas, certein to depart, All thinges preparde, slept in the pupp on hie. To whom in sleape the wonted godheddes forme Gan aie appere, returning in like shape As semed him, &amp; gan him thus advise, Like vnto Mercurie in voice &amp; here, With yelow bushe &amp; comelie lymmes of youthe: “O goddes sone, in such case canst thow sleape? Nor yet bestraight the daungers dest for see That compass the, ner here the faire windes blowe Dido in minde rowles veniaunce &amp; deceite; Certein of death, swells with vnstable yre. Wilt thow not fle, whiles thow hast tyme of flight? Straight shalt thow se the seas coverd with sayles, The blasing brondes the shore skalt all with flame, &amp; if the morow steales vpon the here. Come of, haue done, sett all delaie aside; For full of change these women be allwaie.” This said, in the dark night he gan him hide. Aeneas, of this sodaine vision Adredd, stertes vp owt of his sleape in hast; Calls vp his feres: “Awake! gett vp, my men! Aburd your shippes, &amp; hoyse vp sayle with spede! A god me wills, sent from aboue againe, To hast my flight, &amp; wrethed cables cutt. O holie god, what so thow art, we shall Followe the, &amp; all blithe obaye thie will. Be at our hand, &amp; frindlie vs assist! Adresse the sterrs with prosperous influence!” &amp; with that word his raser sword vnshethes, With which drawen he the cable cutt in twaine; The like desire the rest imbraced all. All thing in hast thei refte, &amp; furth thei whorle. The shore thei leave; with shippes the sees ar spredd; Cuttinge the fome by the grene seas thei sweepe. Aurora now from Titans purple bedd With new daies light had ouerspredd the earth, Throwgh the windowe the quene the creking daye Aspied, &amp; navie with splaide sayles depart The shore, &amp; eke the port of vessells voide. Her comelye brest thrise or fower tymes she smitte With her owne hand, &amp; tare her golden tresse. “Oh Iove!” quod she, “Shall he then thus depart, A straunger thus, &amp; skorne our kingdome soe? Shall not my men do on ther armour prest, &amp; eke pursue them throwgh owt all this towne? Owt of the rode soone shuld the vessells warpe? Hast on, cast flame, hoyse sayle, &amp; weelde your ores! What said I? but wher am I? what fransie Alters thie minde? Vnhappie Dido, now Hath the be sett a froward destenie? Then the behoued, when thow did devide Thie sceptre. Loe! his faithe &amp; his right hand, That ledes with him, thei saye, his cuntrie godes, That on his backe his aged father bare! His bodie might not I haue caught &amp; rent, &amp; in the sees haue drentcht him, &amp; his pheres? Or from Askanius his life berefte with yron, &amp; sett him on his fathers boord for meat? Of such debate perchaunce the fortune might Haue dowtefull bene; woold god yt war assayd! Whom shuld I fear, that sithe my self must dye? Might I haue throwen into that navie brondes, &amp; fylled eke ther deckes with flaming fyer, The father, sonn, &amp; all the nacion Distroyed, &amp; fall my self ther ouer all! Sunne, with thie beames that mortall werkes descriest; And thow, Iuno, that well these travailes knowst; Proserpine, thow, vpon whom folke do vse To howle, &amp; call in forked waies by night; Infernall furies, ye wreekers of wrong; &amp; Didos godes, which standes at point of deathe: Receaue these wordes, &amp; eke your heavie powre With drawe from me, that wicked folke deserue, &amp; our request accepte, we you besech. If so that yonder wicked hed must nedes Recouer port, &amp; sayle to land of force, &amp; if Ioues will hath so resolved it, &amp; such end sett as no wight can fordoe; Yet at the least assayled might he be With armes &amp; warrs of hardie nacions; From the bondes of his kingdome farr exiled; Iulus eke ravisht owt of his armes; Driven to call for helpe, that he maie se The wailfull corses of his folke lie dedd. &amp; after hard condicions of peace, His realme, nor life desyred maie he brooke; But dye before his tyme, vnburied amidd the sandes. This I require; these wordes with blud ishedd. &amp;, Tirians, ye his stocke &amp; all his race Pursue with hate! reward our cindres so! No loue nor league betwixt our peoples be! And of our bones some wreeker may ther springe, With sword &amp; flame that Troianes may pursue! And from hencefoorth, when that our powr may stretch, Our coostes to them contrarie be thei aie, I craue of God; that our streames to ther fluddes; Armes vnto armes; &amp; ofspringe of ech race!” This sayd, her mind she wrythde ouer all sides, Seking with spede to ende this yrksome life. To Syches nurse, Barcen, then thus she sayd— For hers at home in asshes did remaine—: “Call vnto me, dere nurse, my sister An; Bidd her in haste in water of the floode She sprinkle the bodye, &amp; bring the beastes &amp; purging sacrifice I did her showe. So lett her come; &amp; thow thie temples bynde With sacred garlandes; for the sacrifice That I to Pluto haue begonn, I mynde For to perfourme, &amp; geue ende to these cares; A Troiane statue throwe into the flame.” When she had sayd, redowble gan her nurse Her steppes, forth on an aged womans trott. But trembling Dido egerlie now bent Vpon her sterne determinacion, Her bludd shott eien rowling within her hedd, Her quiuering chekes fleked with deadlie staine, Both pale &amp; wanne to thinke on deathe to come, Into the inner wardes of her palaice She russheth in, &amp; clamme vp, as bestraught, The buriall stacke, &amp; drew the Troiane sword, Her gifte sometime, but ment to no such vse. Wher, when she saw his weedes &amp; wellknowen bedd, Wepinge a while, in studie gan she staye, Fell on the bedd, &amp; these last wordes she sayde: “Swete spoiles, whiles God &amp; destenie did permitt, Receave this sprite, &amp; ridd me of these cares! I ran the course so longe as fortune did yt graunt, &amp; vnder earth my great ghost now shall wende. A goodlie towne I buylt, &amp; saw my walls, Happie, alas, to happie, if these coostes The Troiane shippes had never towched aie!” This sayd, she layd her mowth close to the bedd. “Whie then,” quod she, “vnwroken shall we die? But let vs die, for thus, &amp; in this sort Yt liketh vs to seke the shadows darke. &amp; from the seas the crwell Troiane eies Shall well discerne this flame, &amp; take with him Eke these vnluckie tokens of my deathe.” As she had sayd, her damsells might perceve Her with those wordes fall persed on the sword, The broyling blood with gore, &amp; handes imbrwed. The clamer rang vnto the palaice topp; The bruite ran throwgh all the astoined towne. With wailing great, &amp; womens laymenting The roophes gan rore, the aire resownd with plaint, As thowgh Carthage or auncient Tyre With presse of entred armes swarmed full; Or when the rage of furious flame doth take The temples toppes, &amp; mansions eke of men. Her sister An, spriteles for drede to here This dreddfull sturr, with nailes gan tere her face. She smotte her brest, &amp; russheth throwgh the rowte, &amp; dying thus she cleapes her by her name: “Sister, for this with crafte did you me boorde? The stacke, the flame, the aulters, bredd thei this? What shall I fyrst complaine, forsaken wight? Loothest thow in dethe thi sisters felowshipe? Thow shuld haue called me to like destenie: One woe, one sword, one hower ende both vs two! Thys funerall stacke buylt I vp with these handes, &amp; with this voice cleped our natiue godes; &amp;, crwell, so absentes me from thie deathe? Distroid yt hath, sister, both the &amp; me, Thie people eke, &amp; princes borne of Tyre. Geve here; I shall with water washe her woundes, &amp; sucke with mowthe her breath, if owght be lefte.” Thus sayd, vnto the hie degrees she mownted, Embrasing fast her sister now half deed, With wailfull plaint; whom in her lapp she layd, The blake swart gore wiping drie with her clothes. &amp; Dido striveth to lifte vp againe Her heavie eien, &amp; hath no power therto: Depe in her brest the fixed wound doth gape. Thrise leaning on her elbowe gan she raise Her self vpward, &amp; thrise she ouerthrew Vpon the bedd, ranginge with wandring eies The skies for light, &amp; wept when she it fownde. Allmightie Iuno, having ruthe by this Of her long paines &amp; eke her lingring deathe, From heaven she sent the goddes Iris downe, The striving sprite &amp; iointed lymmes to loose. For that neither by lott of destenie Nor yet by naturall death she perished, But wretchedlie before her fatall daye, &amp; kindled with a sodayne rage of flame, Proserpine had not from hedd berefte The golden herre, nor iudged her to hell. The dewie Iris thus with golden winges, A thowsand hues showing against the soun, Amidd the skies then did she fle adowne, On Didos hedd wheras she gan alight: “This herre,” quod she, “to Pluto consecrate, I do bereaue; &amp; eke the sprite vnloose From thie bodie.” &amp; when she had thus sayd, With her right hand she cutt the herr in twaine, &amp; therwith all the naturall heat gan quench, &amp; into winde furthwith the life resolve.</field>
