      <field name="fulltext">THE State of Rome, &amp;c. &amp;c. What still be plagu'd and never take the Scourge, Whilst Loads of Venal Trash my Vengeance urge? Shall Sporus' Epigrams, and Codrus' Odes, Unpunish'd, haunt their Sovereign's bless'd Abodes? Shall Bulbus, Lubio, all the hireling Hounds Bark on, unlash'd, protected by their Gowns? Shall Scurrio, Eubulus, and A B C, Leave in the Chandler's Shops no room for me? No, tho' the Stage be interdicted quite, The Press yet open, Romans still may Write. On then, and fearless rhyme in Graccus' Spite. But why, with Rage, I grasp the Satire's Rod, Why tread the Paths that keen Lucilius trod, Attend the Causes which my Ire provoke; When Roman Sailors feel the Spaniard's Yoke, By all forsaken, and despis'd by all, When Latium trembles at the Name of Gaul; When black Corruption spreads her Wings around, And Brib'ry, bare-fac'd, stalks the Senate Ground; When Fair Crispinus, pretty Man of Wit! Dare's in his Master's Ear his Venom spit; Who trips about the Town in Tyrian Dye, A gaudy, glitt'ring, flutt'ring, teazing Fly; By whom each fair one may be—what? why fann'd, So fond's the Thing to shew his Lady-Hand. When mad Santurius may unhang'd go on, To make Men drunk, then stab 'em when h'as done; And hanging athirst for human Gore Condemn his half-try'd Culprits by the Score, When each Place swarms with such a shameless Crew, What Pen holds Gall to give 'em all their due? And yet to see all this and to refrain, What Ribs of Iron can my Gall contain? Fierec Indignation boils within my Veins, To see big Sharpers proud with impious Gains Roll in their Cars, and boast their knavish Mains. With what Resentment must the Muse behold, The Wife brought over by her Spouse and sold, Who his taught Eyes up to the Cieling throws, Hears the Jobb done, then back to B? goes. What Age so vast a Crop of Follies bore, When was each Vice so dignify'd before? None, none can e'er out-do us—future Times Can't add one Scruple to our present Crimes; Our Sons but the same Things can wish and do, Each Vice is at the highest it can go. Spread, Satire, spread thy Wings, and fearless fly To seize thy Prey, tho' lurking ne'er so high. If Nature could not, Anger would indite, And, thus provok'd, e'en Codrus' self might write; But hold, what Folly! how dar'st thou again Speak dangerous Truths, or spoken how maintain? When Roman Liberty's so far bereft The Honest Heart—that scarce the Name is left. E're Scandalum Magnatum was begot No matter if his Lordship winch'd or not. But now if Freedom with the Great, you take, If into Rogues omnipotent you rake, ?'s your Doom, or you must flie Abroad, To scape the Scourge of the devouring Rod. Muse be advis'd, be cautious of your Ears, Hold, hold in Time—a Summons from the ?s, A Summons from the ?s, well let it come; Not till next Ides of March, I meet my Doom, And none, in Rome, if such gross Vices thrive, Another Ides of March would chuse, to live. By Heav'n I'am Sick on't—O were I convey'd, Where Lapland Ice obstructs the Merchant's Trade; When Vice in Triumph lords it thro' the Land, And titl'd Knaves support her on each Hand; When ev'ry Fool's prefer'd, when Villany Grows rich and great, and Cheats alone are free; When Beardless Misers, Brutes unknown before Wait hourly to be Bought at ?'s Door; When B?s and T?s ev'ry where you meet, And C?s and W?s choak up ev'ry Street; When W?d's, the cock Priest,—that puling Sot, Just slip'd the Shell, and in a Tunick got, Yet boasts ten Thousand Boobies in his Train, Gaping to catch the Ooze of his mad Brain; When T?te both Sexes acts, before A vile Indorser, and behind a Whore; And 'twixt the Males of O?n, Scenes are past Which make old D?'s leud Nocturnals chaste. Say Dear Swintonius what detested Clime, Taught Latium's learned Sons so dire a Crime? Thro' what curst Cause do these Distempers rage? What, Why the base corrupt corrupting Age; No liberal Science finds the least Support, No social Virtue meets one Friend at Court; No Profit rises from the licens'd Stage, No License granted to the Truth-fraught Page; None rais'd, none lov'd, but He who loves the Times, Who's skill'd in dark Intrigues, and plung'd in Crimes, Virtue and Knowledge, all, aloud, deride, Learning and Wit's industriously decry'd; No Bounty's felt but what the Great advance To glut the Scum of Italy, and France. Where rank Adult'rers break the Nuptial State, And scarce a Bed but feels a Foreign Weight; Where no one Woman for one Man seems meant, But sooner with one Leg would be content: In ev'ry Street the Belides appear, And Clytemnestra's sprout up every where. Here if one honest Man I chance to View Above base Int'rest, and to Friendship true; One Woman chaster than the common Crew, I rank them with the Prodigies of Fame, And marvel whence the lovely Monsters came. Worse than the Iron Age now onward moves, For constant Use our Vices so improves, That bafl'd Nature's at a Loss to frame, A Metal base enough to give the Age a Name: 'Tis Time, high Time to fly this shameful Place, Where Truth nor Justice dare not shew the Face. Here let Arturius live, and such as He, Such Manners will with such a Land agree; Chiefs who, in Senates, have the golden Knack Of turning Truth to Lies, and White to Black. Who build vast Halls to lodge their wedded Whore, And by Excise and Taxes starve the Poor. Here Sporus live—and once more feel my Rage, Once and again I drag thee on the Stage; Male-female Thing, without one Virtue made, Fit only for the Pathick's loathsome Trade: Feeble and weak in all that's good and right, And only strong in Impudence and Spite. What tho' by Blood thou strut'st a gaudy Peer? What tho' thou nestlest's in thy Master's Ear? No Ill Man's happy—least of all are they Whose Study's to corrupt, revile, betray. What's the Advantage Junius, or the Good That you can boast a rich paternal Blood? Vain are their Hopes who fancy to inherit, By Trees of Pedigree, or Fame, or Merit, Tho' plodding Heralds, thro' each Branch may trace Old Captains, or old Gen'rals of their Race, While their base Deeds their Ancestors belie, And grieve the Brass, that stands dishonour'd by. How can'st thou Junius in mock Triumph bear Names gain'd by Conquest in the Gallic War? Who, who will call those Noble that deface, By meaner Acts, the Glories of their Race? Whose only Title to their Father's Fame, Is couch'd in the dead Letters of their Name. A Dwarf as well a Giant's Name may bear, Or the puff'd Ass the Lyon's Mantle wear. To whom, you'll ask, is this Correction due? Why realy Junius it is meant for you. Who deem your Person Second to Divine, Because descended from a god-like Line; Tho' yet but one illustrious Act you've done, Forsook your Chief, and from your Colours run. Great Son of Troy, who e're extoll'd a Beast, For being of a Race above the rest? For if fleet Victor's Progeny at last Prove's a mere Jade and in each Match is cast, No favour for the Stallion we retain, No Reverence for the weak degenerate Strain; That we may therefore you, not your's, admire, First, Sir, some Honour of your own acquire; Add to that Stock which justly we bestow On the great Shade to whom your Blood you owe: Let your own Acts immortalize your Name, Your Grandsires Glory will your Stains proclaim, And to a clearer Light expose your Shame. “For still more public Scandal Vice attends, “As he is great and noble who offends. But War's no more you'll say, there's left no Room, To prove our Swords—the Soldier, pent at home, In Sloth and Riots places his Delight, Bumper's all Day, and Harlots ev'ry Night. But hold, War's Rumour! mark the loud Alarms! Hark the shrill Clarion sounds to Arms, to Arms! Shou'd (Heav'n avert it!) any desperate Fate Summon all Heads and Hands to guard the State, Send quick Arturius to secure the Port, “Where are the Generals, where do they resort? Send to the Bagnio there you're sure to find The unfledg'd Hectors coupling with their Kind. Go to the Booths where Feats of Fist are shewn, There you'll find Carlo, from Patrician, grown A Boxer and the Scandal of the Town. Room for the noble Master Champion—See! His mien Majestic shews his Quality. This very Carlo whom we lately saw, Flutt'ring about with Six in his Landau Is forc'd to make the Stage his last Retreat, And owe, to Harlequin's Grimace, his Meat; For now he's forc'd, since his Estate is lost, To make—act, or be himself a Ghost. Strange! He who knew so well to shake the Dice, And dext'rously to throw the lucky Sice; To shun Ames-ace that swept the Stakes away, Should leave no Gleanings for a rainy Day! Shameful are these Examples—Yet we find To Rome's Disgrace, far worse than these behind. Great Father of the Gods, when for our Crimes, Thou send'st some heavy Judgment on the Times; Some Tyrant King, the Terror of his Age, The Type and true Vicegerent of thy Rage, Thus punish him—Set Virtue in his Sight, Dress'd in her Charms, with all her Graces bright; But set her distant—make him pale to see His Gains outweigh'd by lost Felicity. But hold, hold Muse, you moralize too long, Come! wake your Reader with some merry Song. Begin, Calliope, a Tale to sing, Of some past Booby Greek, or Roman King. What Roman King? Why Nero let it be; Well, but his Times with ours can ne'er agree. Um—why that's true,—O no, not in the least, I only tell, and not apply the Jest. When he with whom the Flavian Race decay'd, The servile World with Iron Scepter sway'd, When strutting Nero reign'd, and venal Rome obey'd, On distant Coasts, where Spanish Turrets rise, A Fish was taken of a monstrous Size. The Wise Commander of the Boat and Lines, The Capture for the Emperor designs; And now he reach'd the Stream, where Poor Remains Of Alba's Freedom still its Name retains; The wond'ring Croud that to strange Sights resort, And choak'd a while his Passage to the Court, At length gives way; ope flies the Palace Gate, The Turbut enters, and's received with State. But, O hard Fate! the Palace Stores, no Dish Afford, capacious of the mighty Fish. Call, Cæsar cries, my trusty Senate straight; This great Affair demands their sage Debate. What with this Spanish Monster we must do, Fathers, I'll graciously appeal to you. The Hall is swept, the wise Patricians come, To canvas, as they deem, the State of Rome. Cunning Veiento, lo! and by his Side The great Catullus, leaning on his Guide, Decrepid, yet a furious Lover He, And deeply smit with Charms he scarce can see; Whose Levee's daily crowded with Resort Of a depending, gaping, servile Court. Who grants all Honours of the Sword, and Gown, Glads with a Nod, and ruins with a Frown; Who led his Emp'ror in a String, and sway'd That Prince whom once the subject World obey'd; Who the stiff Pride of Roman Nobles broke, And bent their haughty Necks beneath his Yoke; Thus raising a top-heavy Tow'r, whose Weight Crush'd him at last—no unexpected Fate; For few such Wretches to the Shades descend By a dry Death, or by a glorious End. None more cry'd up the Fish,—He, in it's Praise, With Zeal his Voice, with Zeal his Hands did raise. Nor came Veiento short, but as inspir'd, With his great Leader's Gold and Spirit fir'd, Prophetic, cries, “The happy Omen see, Of fruitful Peace, or glorious Victory. Some captive King shall Cæsar's Prowess own, And proud aspiring Gaul come tumbling down. The Golden Age, O Rome! returns to thee, Thy Power unbounded, and thy Commerce free; The Merchant's Plunderer shall his Prey restore, And Harpies range the Indian Seas no more.” Old Crispus next, wanton, tho' old, appears, His Lust (tho' Power) not yielding to his Years; Who thinking the Debate perplex'd and long, Sate down and mus'd him with a bawdy Song. Montanus' Belly next, advancing slow, Before the Sweating Senator did go. Crispinus after, but much sweeter, comes, Fainting beneath the Fume of Indian Gums. Pompeius then, well skill'd in the Court Game Of cutting Throats, with a soft Whisper, came. Reynardus next befouls the high Abode, Spewing out Sporus' Nonsense by the Load. Next him Acilius of an Age the same, With eager Haste to the grand Council came. In Temper mild, and bless'd with Share of Sense, His Manners winning as his Eloquence; None abler to have sav'd the Land than he, If, as his Thoughts were just, his Tongue were free; If it were safe to vent his Gen'rous Heart; But, Nero reigning, 'twas a dangerous Part. If Power grown absolute Advice could bear; But what's so tender as a Tyrant's Ear? With whom whoever, tho' a Fav'rite, spake, At each cross Vote exposed his Whole at Stake. This well he knew, and therefore never try'd, As some Oafs did, to stem th'impetuous Tide. Then Fuscus sagely op'd his Mouth, and spoke, With many a Hem! but, what was the best Joke, Mistook the Case, till by Catullus' Look Struck Dumb, he strait, with Shame, the Hall forsook.
