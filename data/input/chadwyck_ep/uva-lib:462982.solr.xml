Giue God his due ? H. A. prisoner. Arthingtons Thankefulnesse, for the Lordes exceeding kindnes extended vnto him. 1 O mightie God thou Lord omnipotent, who onely rulest all thinges at thy wyll, Whose throne is far abeue the fyrmament: and whose great power both heauen and earth doth fyll, Shall dust and earth begge of thy Maiestie, to shew how good thou hast been vnto me. 2 How good (my God) graunt pardon I thee pray, for neyther I nor any mortall wight, Thy goodnes (Lord) can any way display, as I do feele it working day and nyght: Yet giue me leaue to tell the best I can. what thou hast done for me (poore simple man) 3 Poore man, I may not stande on euery poynt, for so I shoulde too much thy patience mooue, But so far forth thy doinges to acquaynt, as others may thy goodnes dayly loue: Now then with comfort let my tongue intreate, what thou hast done for me (poore wretch of late. 4 Of late my (Lord) thou knowest I was possest, with Satans spirite cast into my soule, Which was as hot as fyre within my brest; and dyd my scenses for the tyme controll, Inforcing hart and soule for to begin, and most of all my cursed tongue to sinne, 5 To sinne, (deare God) the lyke was neuer scene, so great a sinner since the worlde began, To lyue with breath, as I vile wretch haue been, agaynst Christ Iesus thy beloued sonne: Oh mercy graunt, that grace may styll abounde, for my supplyes, as I haue alwayes founde. 6 As I haue founde (good Lord) thy mercies great, they farre surmount the greatnes of my fall: For thou from heauen (euen from thy mercy seate) didst giue in charge to saue my soule from thrall, And wouldst not let the temptor worke his will, as he dyd seeke my lyfe (by death) to spyll. 7 My lyfe to spyll (deare Lord) thou knowest it well, that Satan sought to worke me further payne, My soule and body both to bryng to hell, that I should there in tormentes styll remayne: But thou (my God) wouldst not it should be so, but didst reuenge me of my deadly foe. 8 My deadly foe (HACKETT the Sorcerer) thou hast destroyde, and cast into the lake, For his great pride agaynst my Sauiour, that durst his name and office vndertake. But I (poore wretch) thou God of all glory, how mightely hast thou preserued me. 9 Preserued me from stangers many fold, of soule and body due (without excuse) And that most strange for mans eyes to beholde, that shoulde be restorde to former yse, Or vnderstanding wit, and right reason, without all helpe saue Iesus Christ alone. 10 Christ Iesus onely, did cast Satan out. Christ Iesus onely saued me from woe, Christ Iesus onely compast me about that Satan could not my state ouerthrow. O Iesus Christ, what should I giue to thee, for all thy mercies manifolde to me? 11 Thy mercies (Lord) in stinting all this strife. thy mercies (Lord) in shylding me from shame, Thy mercies (Lord) in sauing of my lyfe. that I might lyue to prayse thy holy name: O blessed Lord giue grace and strength I pray, thy mercies great yet further to display, 12 Thy mercies great my mynde for to conuert, when worldly, meanes did fayle me in my neede, Thy mercies great in comforting my hart. when as in soule with inwarde woe did bleede, Thy mercies great which doth the rest excell in sauing (Lord) thy seruantes soule from hell. 13 My soule from hell I freely do confesse and body both (my Lord) thou didst preserue. Yea furthermore when I was in distresse. thou didst prouide thy seruaunt should not sterue: So farre thy kindnesse did extende to me, but (Lord) how should I thanke thy maiestie. 14 How should I thanke thy goodnes (O my Lord) for all these tokens of thy constant loue: (Especially for sending me thy worde) to strength my soule that nothing could me moue: Assuredly, my hart can not conceyue, what thankes thou (Lord) deseruest for to haue. 15 Deseruest (Lord) no mortall wyght can tell, the worthy prayses that belong to thee, Except he could describe in the paynes of hell, And ioyes of heauen that last eternally: (Which yf man could) yet doth thy prayse excell, as farre as heauen in goodnes passeth hell. 16 Thy goodnes (Lord) it reacheth ouer all, It fylleth heauen, and earth, and all therein, It norisheth all lyuing thinges mortall: it doth preserue the state of euery thyng, Then as thy goodnes all thy workes surmount, so can no man thy prayses iust recount. 17 Thy prayses (Lord) thy workes expresse the same. The Sunne, the Moone, the Starres in firmament, And all the host of heauen in such good frame, do shew thou art a God omnipotent: But what a God in thyne eternitie, these thinges created cannot testifie. 18 Thy creatures (Lord) do all with one consent, say blessed be thy holy name therefore. But forasmuch as they must all relent, they can not yeelde thy prayses euermore. O then (deare God) how shoulde I prayse thy Sonne, for working foorth my deare saluation. 19 Saluation (Lord) sith that shall haue no ende, I know not how to prayse thee for the fame, But styll to pray that thou wouldst condiscende, that I may lyue to gloryfie thy name. And when this lyfe is flytt and worne away, with thine elect to prayse thy name for aye. 20 For aye (sweete Lord) yea and for euermore, let me (poore wretch) sound out thy prayses styll, For all thy mercies kept for me in store: and for all thine that, do obey thy wyll, O let the number styll be multiplyde, that thy great name may be more magnified. 21 Thy name be magnified (O glorious Lord) both in this worlde, and in the worlde to come, Of all thy creatures with one accorde, that are or shall be altered in forme: Let heauen, let earth, let euery thyng lyuing, sounde out the prayse of Christ our heauenly king. Giue God his due ? Hen. Arth. prisoner. A meditation of the exceeding mercies of God, the father, sonne, and holy ghost, in the creation, saluation, and sanctification of the redeemed. &amp;c. 1 O mortall man, regarde and see, what God in loue hath done for thee: When thou wast nought but dust and earth, The worke of the trinitie in forming mankinde.he put into thee lyfe and breath, And made thee like his Maiestie, in wysedome and integritie. All creatures he made for thy sake, to gouerne, vse, and thereon take: What hart coulde thinke for thy safety, he did it graunt most wyllingly. 2 When thou through sinne wast falne from grace, and so cast downe from pleasant place, into this vale of miserie The loue of God the father towardes mankinde decayed.subiect to all calamitie: And of Gods friende was made his foe, in bondage styll to sinne and woe, God in great loue sent downe his Sonne, for thy saluation to be borne: That so he might in thy nature, his fauour lost agayne procure. 3 So that when sinne did styll abounde, and Satan sought thee to confounde, Gods iustice yeelding to the same, The willing obedience of Christe Iesus to redeme mankinde.to throw thee downe to endles shame: Beholde the great exceeding loue, of Iesus Christ that did him mooue, Thy sauegarde man to vndertake, and so to suffer for thy sake, The paynes of hell, and to fulfill in euery poynt his fathers wyll. 4 If thou belong to God aboue, then dost thou feele his greatest loue. The assurance of saluation in the electe, wrought by the holy ghost.His holy spirite assures thine hart, that in Christes sufferinges thou hast part: A steadfast fayth in Christ his death, this spirite in thee sealed hath, A constant hope by him alone, for to obtayne saluation. None other Sauiour dost thou craue, but onely Christ thy soule to saue. 5 Thus must we all Gods people deare, confesse the loue he doth vs beare, The loue of God in generall, towardes all his seruants.In chosing vs before the rest: and louing vs his chyldren best. In whom he reigneth by his worde, and keepes vs from the enimies sworde: Whose prouidence styll doth well supply, for to relieue our miserie. Who in all neede doth vs succour, that we should serue him euermore. 6 Then let this great loue of the Lord, mooue all our hartes to learne his worde: To worshyp first his Maiestie, The duetie of all Christians for al Gods mercies towardes th?. with hart and soule most constantly. And next our heighbour in lyke sort, to loue, maynteyne, and styll comfort. And whylst we lyue with hart and mynde, to prayse Gods loue to vs so kynde. So long as heauen and earth doth last, and when this worlde is gon and past. 7 Let all Gods workes sounde out his prayse, most chearefully now and alwayes: Not onely those that are mortall, Thankfulnesse due in all, chiefly in the elect. but those much more Cælestiall. And most of all his owne deare flocke, that are sure buylt on Christ the Rocke. O let vs all with one consent, prayse this our God omnipotent, For working our saluation, through fayth in Iesus Christ alone. Giue God his due ? H. A. prisoner.
