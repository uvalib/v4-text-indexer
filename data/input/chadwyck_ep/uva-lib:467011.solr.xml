      <field name="fulltext">LETTERS OF LAURA D'AUVERNE TO BERTHA. LETTER FIRST. MARCH 23. Marriage! when was Marriage happy? I am weary of this yokeâ Weary of this bland deceptionâthis mere counterfeitâthis cloak; Oh! dear Bertha, never marry, never shackle life's poor span With those vows that link you ever to exacting, selfish Man! Love! you should have heard his raptures,âheard those silver-wooing chordsâ Passion-breathing, soul-enthralling, as his life hung on my words; Oh! to hear him, Woman's advent was the advent of a grace That lent lustre unto Heaven, and gave language to earth's face. Sheâ'twas sheâthat, like the morning, scatter'd gladness as she came; Nature wreath'd her path with sweetness, wrote on every flower her name; Music at her first fond whisper thrill'd and trembled into birth; Beauty languished to be like her, Truth to imitate her worth! Oh! dear Bertha, could you fancy angel breathings, such as these, Ending in a marriage discord, like a wild cat o'er the keys? Such a storm I've just escaped from;âbut of course you know D'Auverne, Know his obstinate ill-humourâknow his pride;âbut you shall learn. If I have a passion, Bertha, 'tis to mount the graceful steed, Curb his haughty pace elastic, check his hot and dashing speed; But D'Auverne abhors itâhates it!âWould you think a man of sense Could be so perverse as hate it?âTruth is, dear, he hates expense! Well, it ended in a quarrel. âThink you, sir,â I said to him, âThat each wish I should surrender to make triumph for your whim; There are ladies round me, thousands, who have horses they may ride, With attendants ever ready; wherefore, then, am I denied?â As he rose, I rose and pass'd him, proudly, as I would command, But he stepp'd all pale, and held me with an agitated hand, And with quivering lip he murmur'dââThere's no pain this heart endures Like the pain of thus denying any hope or wish of yours! âIf you love me Laura, love meâ......but no word would I hear more, But regained my chair, and, rocking, crush'd my passion 'gainst the floor; Even this, dear, did not please him! for with short and snappish word, âCease that foolish rocking,â said he, âfor 'tis fit I should he heard.â âSince you force me, I must hear you,âthere's for me no other choice,â Spoke I, with a chilling courtesy, and a cold, contemptuous voice; All astounded, gazed he on me, with a brow of gathering gloom, Loosed my hand in utter silenceâand I proudly left the room. LETTER SECOND MARCH 24. 'Tis the Sabbath morning, Bertha, yet the Sabbath bells but jar 'Gainst my feelings, all in tumult,â'gainst my heart, whose pulse is war; Oh! the speeches which I fashioned, word by word, and inly spoke Through the long night's sleepless watching, ere the loitering morn awoke. As the drawn and dark'ning curtains shut the early beam of day From the lofty arched ceilingâfrom the lone couch where I lay, Myriad words came stern before me, myriad thoughts my soul imbued With a colour stern of temper, and a purpose unsubdued! âNeverânever!â cried I, ânever will I bend with feelings mute, Humbling every wish, will, fancyâevery thought his mood to suit; Neverânever! sooner wither 'mid this winter of the brainâ Sooner years of nights made sleeplessâsooner endlessness of pain.â Noon shed amber through the casement ere I ventured down the stair; Cold it seem'd, and lone, and stately, as no footstep had been there; All within remain'd unalter'd,âyet the very mirror took Shades of sadness: my own features seem'd my own self to rebuke. There was laughter, light, elastic,âvoluble as music floats On a tide of silver, breaking into drops of ringing notes; Some one enteredâ'twas De Montfortâshe with whom I was to ride, And my pride wept tears, though hidden, as she laughing sought my side. Oh! be sure I did not spare him; I unclothed his specious cue Of affection, fear, and such like, lest some danger might ensue! As she left me who should enter, just as nothing had occurr'd, But D'Auverne, who clasped me closelyâfondlyâand without a word. Quick his arm I threw beyond me, sayingââSir, let me be goneâ I, of course, must bend in all things; you it seems, give way in none! Follow, then, your inclination, follow out each selfish line Even as you please, and, henceforth, from this hour I'll follow mine!â So he paused again; then, smiling, tried to coax me to his will, Saying, âFor so slight a matter, shall we live in anger still? Look within mine eyes, dear Laura, there my heart you may behold;ââ âSir,â I said, âthe heart I see thereâis a heart that loves but gold!â Bertha, scarce the words were givenâpassion-spokenâpassion-bornâ Rudelyârashlyâfalsely utter'dâutter'd, too, with needless scornâ Ere my heart burn'd to recall them, as I saw him start, and gaze, Ashy pale, as one bewilder'dâhalf in anguishâhalf amaze! âGod, oh God!â he cried; âwhat evil have I done that this should be! I, whose loveâwhose loveâoh! weakness, tears!âunmanly tears to see; Never,â groan'd he, âhave you loved me; and 'tis better we should partâ You, to fashion's giddy minions; I,âto wretchedness of heart. Out the door he trembling hurried,âout my heart the passion came, And I sat rebuked, admonished, in my bitterness of shame; Oh! this prideâthis pride, my Bertha, 'tis a fiend from which to shrink; Many a cup of human sorrow forceth it the lip to drink. LETTER THIRD. MAY 1. Flowers are smiling o'er the meadowâbirds are merry on the wingâ In my heart life's flowers are droopingâdying in their life's young spring; Three long weeks have fled, my Bertha, heavy weeks, with woe o'ercastâ Since, with solemn sad vibration, Time's dull hand hath knell'd the Past. Oh! but Memory is ungrateful, ever seeking its own will, Feeding every thought of passion with some fancied wrong or ill; Yet, when needed to support one,âto sustain our heat of moodâ It betrays the heart by turning what before seem'd illâto good! Many an act of true affection rush'd with wayard force to mind; Many a needless, fond indulgence: he had only been too kind; Scarce an hour ago my memory could with nought but evil meet; Now, like rain in roses vanish'd,âI see nothing but the sweet. But my storyâto my story:âWhen D'Auverne thus pale withdrew, And my passion, like a culprit, stood in all its guilt to view, Quick I heard him reach his study,âturn with sudden wrench the keyâ While I listen'dâall affrightedâwondering what the end might be. Would he!âhow my blood froze in me!ârashly, madly, seek death's goal, By an act that might for ever shut forgiveness from his soul? Thrice I shudd'ring crept to listen, praying God with earnest breath To console himâto relieve himâor to give me instant death! Not a sound, a breath, a movement,âall was silent save my breast, Whose tumultuous throbbings warn'd me it should never more find rest; Oh! the horror of a silence o'er whose hideous calm may burst Such an act, gore-stain'd and guilty, as leaves Man denounced, accurst! Darkly pass'd the dreary midnight;âthings distemper'd minds reveal Crowded round me, till the moment when we met at morning meal; Oh! those blood-shot eyes reproached me,âthat dear face, so pale yet sweet, And those lips that still pretended to partake, yet did not eat. If he'd look'd but once upon me,âmade, though but the least, advance, Said one word to scorn or scold me,âgiven but one censuring glance, I'd have humbled me before him, owned his censure well applied; But the words I would have utter'd, on my lips, discouraged, died. If he'd onlyâonce more onlyâsaid, âMy Laura, must we part?â Must we still live on in anger?â I'd have clasped him to my heart, Own'd my brief, yet bitter error,âown'd that I had deeply erred,â Pleaded to his love for pardon,âsued for one forgiving word! But in silenceâstill in silenceâand he rose without a look! Then a month's estrangement followed,âweeks of torture, hard to brook; I denied myself to each oneâshut me from the light of dayâ Yearning for that lost affection, that rich love I threw away. One calm eveningâit was starlightâlone I sat, and life review'd Gazing through the open casement, with Night's beauty all subdued. Would D'Auverne, methought, but enter, I would tell him all I feared;â As divining my petition, at that moment he appeared. âLaura,â spoke he, slow and sadly, âyou're not happy?ââand I said, âMiserable am Iâwretched!âwho are happy save the dead?â He replied, âI leave for travel, and 'tis needful you should stay With your parents;â'tis uncertain how long I remain away! âI have knownâbut wherefore speak it?âmisery never comes aloneâ Other losses, other sorrows, o'er my pathway have been thrown; Month by month hath earthly fortune faded into empty air; Needing solace, I've found sorrow; needing hope, I've met despair. âBut no matterâ'tis no matter: Time hath mercy yet in store; There is light in the Hereafterâthough there's light on earth no more; If I die, whate'er remaineth shall be yours, and yours alone; My last words are,âMay you never know the anguish I have known.â Goneâyes, gone!âunheard, unpardoned: in my woe I craved for death. All the air from earth to heaven seemed too little for my breath! Gone! my very heart seemed bursting, crush'd unto its very core; It was midnight when they found me, fainting, bleeding on the floor. LETTER FOURTH. MAY 3. Time goes even with the wretched,âthat is something for life's woes, Hopeless, friendless, rayless, joylessâsick or healthyâstill Time goes! If it so had pleasÃ©d Heaven, gladly had I slept from pain,â Slumber'd on, oh! well contented never to have waked again. Wrestling with my bitter sorrow, early I resolved on flight; From my wardrobe took my dressesâfolded, packed them, for the night; From my bureau snatch'd some trifles friendship only made of worth, And, array'd for my departure, stood as bann'd on mine own hearth. Parents! Home!âwhat home? what parents?âParents I will never claim; Home!âthat spot so loved, so honour'd,âshall I back to it in shame? Never; whilst I've strength I'll labour,âteach my spirit self-control: Talents studied for adornment shall support me and console! Yet âDepartureâ stung my senses with a sharp contracting pain; All the room swam round and round me, circling as with fire my brain; O'er the desk, which there lay open, I my tortur'd bosom bowed, And in utter desolationâaimless, friendlessâwept aloud! With the scalding tears fast falling, for the last time I address'd Him, who, had he then but seen me, thus repentant, thus distress'd, Hadâno matter: what pride bringeth, pride must sternly learn to bear, Gain content from disappointment,âgather vigour from despair! âNot, D'Auverne, to wound or grieve you,â wrote I, weeping, trembling on; âBut to pray you to speak kindlyâto judge mildlyâwhen I'm gone; Not too rashlyânot too coldlyâthink, though I have done you wrong, I have never less than loved you; my worst fault, a faulty tongue. Ere you read this, she who pens it will have left you, sorrow torn; Left you, but with heart as faithful as upon her bridal morn; Left youâfor I cannot, durst not, go unto my father's roof, 'Neath this sentence of your anger, 'neath this stain of your reproof. Whatsoever fate await me, it shall but my firmness prove; Never taint shall reach that bosom you once honour'd with your love. If I die, and you forgive me, though it be too late to saveâ You may, with a true assurance, scatter lilies o'er my grave. Had youâbut 'tis vain to speak itâhad you sought my fault to screen, Warned me kindly of my danger, this distraction had not been! Long I waitedâlong, but vainlyâone relenting glance to meet, To avail me of that moment, to have cast me at your feet! You will think, if still you love me as you loved me once, D'Auverne,â Onceâwhen you came miles to woo meâmiles, a single smile to earn: You will thinkâwill thinkâand mourn me; for when I have pass'd away, Memory, like an angel weeping, will remind you of that day!â Ere I ended came his footstep, as with hesitating pace, And I listened, hoping wildly once again to see his face; As irresolute of purpose, suddenly he hurried down,â And I heard him answer sharplyââHe should not return from town.â Mute I mark'd the shadows shifting, sinking, dying in the west; Heard the last one of the household hastening to her welcome rest; Sleepless watch'd I till the dawn-light trembled on the foliage green, Thenâwith broken steps and falteringâleft the sleeping house unseen. LETTER FIFTH. MAY 17. In the gray receding distance street and spire, like visions, sweptâ O'er that mighty mass of beings shadow after shadow crept; And a shadow wrapp'd my spirit, darker than the dawn e'er wore, As, abandon'd and unfriended, thus I left my native shore. Strange, my Bertha, how affection lingers where young footsteps go, Strange how slight a thing may fasten on the heart, and we not know: Scotland was my mother's birth-land; and as came the hour to part, That dear name I'd heard in childhood came the first thing to my heart. Not that I knew friend or kindred, or a rood of its bright land, Yet, although a stranger to me, it held forth no stranger's hand: 'Twas the name my mother's accents centred in her child's young breastâ And that child, in her first sorrow, look'd unto its shores for rest! See me then a wanderer, Bertha, hopless in my great despair; I, from earliest recollection, cherish'd with too fond a care: See me tread that shore romantic,âglowing 'mid poetic graceâ With a vision, sorrow blinded, turning to its beauteous face. Close behind the village post-house, where the coach stopp'd for the night, Flowed a broad and rapid torrent, leaping down from height to height; Full of music rolled its waters, like a psalm of endless praise, Unto him who guides for ever the eternity of days! Slowly on, by mount and valley, followed I its downward sweepâ Till at last its organ-grandeur, stop by stop, was hushed to sleep; 'Twas an evening such as seraphs might have chosen to appear, Half mistaking Nature's beauty for their own transcendent sphere. From the book I brought to cheer me, page from page I listless tore, Watching still the sloping waters as the scatter'd leaves they bore; And I thoughtâoh! blessÃ©d Heavenâif 'twere but the same to theeâ Would my page of life thus endingâthus forgottenâhere might be! And my soul with woe grew darkened,âguideless, wilder'd in its way;â God, it thought, would sure forgive it;âwherefore then its peace delay? Oh! so calm the paper floatedâfloated, eddied, sank, and died, That it seem'd no common effort to resist that wished for tide! Then methought of the hereafter!âif this sin were not forgiven, Would there be some spirit-kingdom, midway yet 'tween earth and heaven? Some bright region wherein Mercy, comforting, consoling, trod,â Where the air was full of angels, winging ransom'd souls to God! Oh! to know! butâbut to know it! oh! to grasp that hope sublime! Tell me, thou proud Sun, whose march is o'er the triumphs of all time,â Answer thou, who call'st the Nations from their utter night of gloom, Tell me what lies stretched beyond thee?âwhat is Death?âand what the Tomb? Of that sphere of unknown beingâof that vast mysterious shore, Unto which ten thousand ages travel, and are seen no moreâ Of the multitudes who've partedâof the myriad loved who've gone, Is there, from that shore of silence, none to speak?ânot one! not one! Will it be Forgiven? Tell me! Will the angels intercede For a spirit thus afflictedâcast, abandon'd, like a weed! Will a tear be dropp'd in pity, washing out this act of shame? Will the holy hand of Mercy write forgiveness to my name? Thus I ravedâthus hopedâmy reason wander'd wildly in its woe! Longâhow long I stood inactive,âmoments?âhours?âI do not know; But at last my ears were ringing with a dizzy, hissing din,â And my soul seem'd sinkingâsinking,âlower, lowerâin its sin! Oh! the suffocating horror,âdragging me as with a chain; Oh! those dizzy dreadful waters,âshrieking, screaming through my brain;â Muffled echoesâdim and drowningâheard I, choking 'mid the strife,â But the grasp of Death grew fainter, and a dream came over life! LETTER SIXTH. JUNE. In the inner world of spirit dwells a second life,âa breath Lent us by the lips of angels to recal us out of death! In that world we act and utter things we cannot all explain, But whate'er hath passed in Spirit must on Earth be passed again. We hear things we well remember to have heard in dreamsâand see The same place and the same people,âwe could tell what next will be: As from such a world of marvels I awoke, and looked around, All things seem'd as robed in rainbows,âdoor and ceiling, wall and ground. Back my soul return'd bewilder'd,âwandering in a dreamy maze; Never painter wrought such wonders as whereon mine eyes did gaze; And these pictures of my fancy took on sight and brain such hold, That, awake, I still perceived them, glowing on the curtain's fold, Then they mingled in each otherâdied away like angel-wings, And, from out the rose-like vapour, one by one came household things; One pale objectâdim and distantâcost me many an anxious look, Till the mist cleared off, and show'd me some one bending o'er a book. Clearer stillâI saw a lady, plainly vesturedâold and grey, Lofty statured, finely featured,âform'd as if of nobler clay! And I heard her reading, slowly, words with holy comfort rife, From His lips who died that others might have everlasting life! Swift as lightning through my spirit all at once the Past arose! Shriek'd again the demon watersâhowling round like hellish foes; All my miseryâall my madnessâsprang in broader light to view, Till I cried, âForgive me heaven!âhelp meâteach me what to do.â Sweetly as a babe is lifted to its mother's soothing breastâ Softly, as a mother presses, were my aching temples pressed! And a gentle whisper heard I,ââLet thy soul to Jesus pray, Ne'er to Him came one in sorrow he e'er turned in tears away!â Everâeverâlike a mother, comforting with words divineâ Cheeringâsoothingâleading nearer my lost soul to God's own shrine; Till at last, with spirt humbled, slow my trembling prayer was given, And I saidââForgive thy servant! Pardon mine offences, Heaven! âThou, who bore affliction meekly,âhow can I thy pity claim?â Pray for comfort, peace, or pardon, and not hide my head in shame? Pain! there is no pang in natureânot a darker pain can live, Than the pain that we, unthinking, to our wretched selves can give. âTemper! Passion!âthey but end in fruitless sorrow and disgrace,â Wound affectionâwarp the reasonâdarken lifeâdeform the face. Temper! Temper! God of Mercy, cleanse me from that scorpion foe, Guide me to mine own salvation! Lift me from a thrall so low!â Ever with some word of scripture,âwrit to solace hopeless grief,â With a touching look of kindness, gave she to my fears relief; Everâeverâlike a mother, calmed she still my soul's alarms, Till at length, outworn, I slumbered, pillowed in her pitying arms. LETTER SEVENTH. Sweet to watch the fair Spring going, all her golden ringlets blowing, To the maying, to the mowing, laughing, singing on her way; Sweet to list the streamlet welling, by some lonely cottage-dwelling, And to find our bosom swelling with a gladness born of May. If the spirit be not wholly lost to what is good and holy, Wrapp'd in evil fancies solely, Spring can win us to rejoice; If God made his creatures brothers, surely then the joy of others,â Pleasure, though it be another's, yet should be a welcome voice. Oh! to watch, with grateful feeling, God through nature still appealing, Still His agency revealing through the smallest flower that grows; 'Tis to make existence dearer,â'tis to make the future clearer,â 'Tis to bring God's presence nearer, when the heart thus grateful glows! See, the air is full of brightness, and my bosom feels its lightness, Lost the pressure, lost the tightness, which each morning saw increase; For I've own'd my sin's commission, with a deep, devout contrition, And I bow to God's decision, and await His time in peace. Now, e'en Winter, stern and hoary, would come to me with a glory, Telling me the self-same story,âGod is here, in white array; And the boughs, bereft and broken, would convey the same blest token God to future time hath spoken,âand again shall we have May. Quick are we to take objection,âquick to find out imperfection,â Would to Heaven the heart's election of the Good as quick might be; But the heart is late in turning,âslow, reluctant, dull in learning That, while Darkness we're discerning, there is Light we will not see. All the health that Life can send us,âall that Fortune's self can lend us, Fail to please us;âto offend us it takes little, space or speech!â Surely there needs something righting, to avert this constant blighting Of the spirit's free delighting in the joys within its reach! Surely there is something needing?âNature lacks some little weeding, Which permits us, thus unheeding, every blessing to pass by; Yet, at every small vexation, every trifling innovation, Quarrels with its adverse station, and doth nothing but decry. See me, Bertha, half-reclining,âgarden flowers around me twining,â And the clear warm sunlight shining, as if gold was rife as rust;â As if that for which men toil for, was not worth this constant coil for, As if gold was but a foil for things no better than the dust. Where the golden moss is creeping, where the mountain lambs are leaping, There's a low white cottage peeping with a green porch at the side; Half-way down the woody dingle in stands, beautiful and single, Like a home just dropp'd from heaven, where the happy may reside. And an angel truly dwells there,âone, who God's own precept tells there, And her love all things excels there, that are lovely to the eye; For she liveth but to gladden those Affliction comes to sadden, And wherever there is sorrow her dear hand is ever nigh! She has lent my soul reliance,âshe has given Doubt defiance, Taught me man's and Heaven's alliance,âtaught me holier steps to trace,â Shown me hopes that Faith erected,âjoys on which I'd ne'er reflected, And my soul feels less dejected gazing on her heavenly face. LETTER EIGHTH. Strange, strange things have hover'd near me,âthings that dwell by haunted streams,â Shadows of a world unenter'd, save by feet that move in dreams; How to image forth their brightness,âin what language to explain Half the wonders of my dreaming, know I not,âthe task seems vain. In my dream I saw a circle, wide and high,âa ring of light; In the midst a blank,âa darkness,âdarkness painful to the sight: Suddenly a host of monsters filled with glare the vacant span, Hideous forms in quick succession, on they came, till, last, came Man. Still beginning with the meanest, lowest of the human race, Step by step the forms grew grander, till there rose a kingly face: Prophets, saints, apostles, angels, 'midst the glorious circle trod, Till in rapturous hope I fancied the next vision might be God! But the circle vanish'd quickly,âand methought I stood alone, At the foot of mighty columns, bearing high in heaven a throne! Looking round for steps to reach it, straight an ocean bounded free, Whose vast shores were all of silver,âand the steps were on that sea. Dimly, in the silv'ry distance, seem'd a boat to heave and toss; Eagerly I hurried towards it,âenter'd in,âand row'd across! Reach'd the wondrous steps in transport; eager, eager to ascend, Hours I climb'd them,âcrept and mounted,â'till I thought they ne'er would end. When the last high step was vanquished, mountain-tops appear'd afar; And the throne shone proud above them, glittering heaven-ward like a star. And a crowd of people pass'd me, saying,ââBack!âclimb as you will,â Struggleâtoilâaspire for everâ'tis a throne beyond you still!â Oh! their hopeless faces grieved me; I was tempted to believe That the throne was but a phantom,âall a vision to deceive! But a little child came to me, lisping,ââSince you are alone, Take me,âlet us go together,âon together to God's throne!â Then I kiss'd the child, and, swiftly, double strength was in my breast;â And the sweet child's talk was ever of the angels and the blest! And methought thy infant wisdom far surpasses all I've heard: There was music, sweetness, beauty, in each little lisping word. And its innocence was blissful,âit was like the morning's breath Unto one whose lips are fainting with a sickness like to death; But the way grew sharp and flinty,âsoon its little feet ran blood, So I press'd it to my bosom, and climb'd with it as I could. Oh! the more and more I press'd it, still the happier I became, Though the path broke stern and rugged, and the heavens were like a flame; Still the toil was full of sweetness, and the way was full of rest, Whilst that face, like something holy, brought its comfort to my breast. Never once my footstep stumbled,ânever once I seem'd afraid, Though deep chasms yawned around us, as for our destruction made. Once again the top was conquer'd, and a valley met our eyes, Sparkling thick with gold and jewels, as the stars of frosty skies! Then the path, all undulating, lent at every turn new charms, So, half lost in happy wonder, I the child put from my arms; And I ran mid fields of rubies, growing wild as roses there, Placed the bright gems in my bosom,âwreathed them in my flowing hair. Still the plain spread wide and wider,âbeauty took a form divine,â Never monarch knew my splendour,âthrones were poor to what was mine! Groups of people saw I kneeling in a temple all of gold, And they wept and clung unto it, for their hearts to it were sold. As I watch'd, a shuddering feeling ran through every tingling vein, And the gems grew black and loathsome, as if reptiles strew'd the plain; Thenâthe child!âI searched in anguish: he had wander'd far and high, To a broken cliff, projecting, like a bridge 'tween earth and sky! And I felt that, speed my utmost,âbeckon, caution, or beseech,â He must fall!âbe lost!âoh! horror!âdash'd to death ere I could reach! Oh! those limbs so frail, so tender,âneeding God's supporting care,â Could it be that he must perish?âwas there no protection there? Swift as speeds the homeward eagle, sped my feet;âthey sped in vain,â And I saw him fallingâfalling!âevery fall went through my brain. And a voice cried,ââLost for ever!âhappiness is thine no more! For a gaudâa toyâa trinket,âlost what gold can ne'er restore!â Weeping, wailing, crept I to him,âlooked upon him with a groan, While his dying lips still whispered,ââTake me with you to the throne! Take meâtake meâunto Jesus,âonly He can heal my pain, And in happy homes of angels we, with Him, shall walk again!â Oh! great God! I wept,âimplor'd thee to forgive me but the past; But those little lips closed slowly, and those sweet eyes look'd their last! Look'd!âoh! Nature, who hath sorrowâwho affliction like to this?â From my anguish I was waken'dâkindly waken'dâby a kiss! And a dear form, bending o'er me, whispered it was time to rise,â âSee,â she said, âthe sun hath travell'd more than half way o'er the skies! Up and haste,âI've that to tell thee which may woo the rose to grow On that cheek, too often, lately, pallid as the wintry snow.â Thus she left me. Tell me, Bertha, what foretells this dream so wild?â Are the pure in heart the happy?âand is happiness a child? Oh! I know not;âyet, before me, smile the lips that smiled in death,â And the throne?âI would have borne him to that throne with my last breath! NINTH, AND LAST, LETTER. Forth I hasten'd to my Hostess;âin the little room lay spread Breakfast, near the trellis'd window, where the birds sang overhead; And the golden air kept playing,âas an infant plays and toys,â With the thin white summer curtains, keeping up a fluttering noise. All around me smiled a welcome: there was beauty in the morn, Sweetness in the vernal cradle of the infant flowers new born; And my Hostess,âhad you seen her, you had thought some sportive elf Thus had made her ever restless,âever smiling to herself! Up she rose and kiss'd me, saying, âYou were dreaming in your sleep: Something sad? I thought so, dearest;âwell, 'tis sometimes good to weep! Tears are often sent from heaven,âsent by those who watch the hour;â Often tears are angel teachers,âfull of spiritual power! Something in that dear face moved me; it was gladsome to behold; Radiant with restrain'd affection,âglowing with a love untold! Mute,âand yet how much 'twas speaking;âwhen, as if too greatly blest, In her arms she softly took me,âpress'd my pale cheek to her breast. âI have news,â she said, âglad tidings;âsome one hath arrived,âis here! Who, whate'er his many failings,âmany trials,âloves you dear: 'Tis,âtake courage; hear me, dearest!âWhen you told me all the Past, I did,âwhat my love suggested,âwrote, and brought him here at last.â âHim?âD'Auverne?âNo,âno!âoh! save me, never can I see his face, Never look for his forgiveness,âI should die in his embrace!â Then she sooth'd my tears, and beckoned unto one I could not see, But my heart, in dizzy throbbings, told me who that one must be! Near he came, but not in anger,âpale, but with a look so sweet That his very kindness kill'd me,âand I fainted at his feet; Had he scorn'd me, I had borne it, knowing all his long annoy; But his tenderness subdued me, and I swoon'd with sudden joy! Slowly from my swoon returning,âall, as in a dream, was seen, I was in my own dear dwelling,âback, as ill had never been! And my husband's arm enclos'd me,âand the past had lost its trace,â Till I saw its awful writing in that thin, pale, alter'd face! Then he told me all his sorrows, when he found that I had fled; How he trembled every moment, lest some crowd should bring me dead! That he wrote unto my parents,âwho arrived that very night,â Straightway parting with the servants, ere transpired my thoughtless flight. Then I learnt, with chilling horror, what aspersion might have done, That my name, assailed and tainted, might have grown a thing to shun;â But my husband's tender caution had averted all this ill; And though I was thus forgetful, he was thoughtful, loving still! âOh!â I cried, âa life's affection ne'er can pay the debt I owe! God will help me, in his mercy, something of my love to show; And the Future, like an Angel, with an ever-coming wing, Shall make Life eternal sweetness,âand our love an endless spring!â Looking up, I saw that dear one who a mother's heart had shown, And I said âThat I am living's due to thee and God alone! Due to thee that I am happy,âthat I 'scape from out this strife With a spirit taught submission,âbetter Christian,âbetter wife!â O'er her knee my face I bended,âand she raised her voice in tears Unto Him, the ever-watching,âHim that sanctified her years! âGuard her Thou, oh! God!â she murmur'd, âkeep her spirit in the right, May she,âhere, on earth, so lovely,âstill be lovelier in Thy sight!â So we wept, in weeping happy that this cup had pass'd away,â That from out a night of darkness had emerged so sweet a day! And D'Auverne said,ââNever,ânever, can I pay what you have done, Save, since Laura is your daughter,âyou will take me for your son. âAnd we'll watch your years together,âlove you with a perfect truth; Scatter flowers of love around you, bright as e'er adorn'd your youth! Still increasing in affection till the light of life grows dim, Till that hour when God shall take us,âcall us, one by one, to him!â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS AND SONGS. THE MOTHER'S HAND. A wand'ring orphan child was I,â But meanly, at the best, attired; For oh! my mother scarce could buy The common food each week required; But when the anxious day had fled, It seem'd to be her dearest joy, To press her pale hand on my head, And pray that God would guide her boy. But more, each winter, more and more Stern suffering brought her to decay; And then an Angel pass'd her door, And bore her ling'ring soul away! And Iâthey know not what is grief Who ne'er knelt by a dying bed; All other woe on earth is brief, Save that which weeps a mother dead. A seaman's life was soon my lot, 'Mid reckless deeds, and desperate men; But still I never quite forgot The prayer I ne'er should hear again; And oft, when half induced to tread Such paths as unto sin decoy, I've felt her fond hand press my head,â And that soft touch hath saved her boy! Though hard their mockery to receive, Who ne'er themselves 'gainst sin had striven, Her who, on earth, I dared not grieve, I could notâwould notâgrieve in heaven: And thus from many an action dread, Too dark for human eyes to scan, The same fond hand upon my head That bless'd the boyâhath saved the man! THE SISTERS. Sisters!âis there nameârelationâ Nearer, dearer, upon earth? Is there, through this broad creation Tie more sweet in human birth? Yet how oft that link is broken As life's selfish path we roam;â Years have pass'd since we have spokenâ Weâwho'd once one heart, one home! She had chosen, in the feeling Of a moment, one whose name Linked itself with crafty dealing,â Things, 'twas said, allied to shame; And I urged her, in my sorrow Mingling tears with all I said, To avoid that dread to-morrow Which must come if him she wed. If I wronged him 'twas in terror Lest her life should be o'ercast; If I wronged himâ'twas an error She might pardon nowâat last! Three long yearsânor yet once near meâ She who with me nightly slept:â Oh! ye blessed angels hear me,â Hear me, ye who've loved, and wept! Angels that on earth, when living, Had dear sisters by your side; Teach mine own how sweet's forgiving! And how hard a thing is pride! As she weptâ'mid feelings holyâ Wond'ring if they e'er should meet; Some one enter'dâslowlyâslowlyâ And sank humbly at her feet, Saying, âFor her sake who bore us, Fed us at the same fond breast, Let God's spirit now come o'er us, And this angry spirit rest:â Pardonâpardon,âsisterâsister!ââ Upward sprang she with a start, Fell upon her neck and kissed herâ Lip to lip, and heart to heart! Thus forgiven and forgiving, In each other's arms they wept;â Oh! in holier regions living, One had watch around them kept!â And they talk'd of times departed,â Of their mother,âwhat she'd said, When together, broken hearted, They had knelt beside her bed! Ah! could she have thought this ever, Thought that we for three long years,â We,âthat loved so much,âcould sever, She had died in tears,âin tears!â Not in smiles like those she gave us, Like a seraph called to bliss;â Let us pray that God may save us From all future sin like this! And the sister mused in wonder How a word, a little word, Had the power two hearts to sunder, Leaving truth for years unheard!â Long she ponder'd,âbut she knew no Higher aid had lent its store: That an Angel she could view not, Led her to her sister's door! THE SON'S VOW. Cold and dark the wind blew, and the rain fell in gloom, As Time struck each hour in the dying man's room;â And the father's last grasp stiffen'd close, as he sigh'd, âRemember thy promise,âmake Mary thy bride!â So, to comfort the dying, he vow'd this should be, Though that vow came in tearsâand those tears were for me. Pale and thin grew his cheek, though he breath'd not a word; He thought of the dead, and no murmur was heard: The hand that grasp'd his until life was no more, Seem'd leading him still unto Mary's own door. Long he strove 'gainst his vow,âlong he fled its decree, For his love was another's,âhis heart was with me. But life had no comfort,âno pity had Time,â The bridal morn came,âand despair rang its chime; He wed;âbut no longer his spirit was strong,â His work was neglected,âhis conduct grew wrong; And I all this struggle, this sorrow, must see,â Must know his heart breaking,âand breaking for me! Then sought I the lost one;â'twas months since we'd met, But the spot we once wander'd, I knew he loved yet; And I spoke for the wife he had render'd forlorn,â For the home he'd deserted,âthe babe newly born; And he look'd in my face,âbut no tears could he see; For I call'd on my God, and His help was with me! Still he gazed in my face,âstill my weak hand he prest, Then murmur'd,ââSo be it,âperchance 'tis the best! 'Tis easy to work when we love those we serve,â But there's strength in despair,âand that strength I must nerve; The bark of my fortune is wreck'd on life's sea,â But, dark and despairing, that heart's still with thee!â White as death were his lips, and his limbs trembled sore, As slowly he left me,âand sought me no more! But the flowers of his garden grew brighter each day, And his child laughed again in its innocent way; Oft I took it, and held it, unseen, on my knee,â Oft pray'd, in my tears,âmay his heart be with thee! Then turn'd to my home,âwhere no smile met my view,â For relations I'd none, and my friends they were few; But a spirit at peace leaves a smile in the breast!â A duty perform'd brings a light God hath blest!â And I dreamt that the angels each night came to me, And whisper'd,ââTake comfort,âour love is with thee!â I WISH MY LOVE WERE SOME FAIR STREAM. I wish my love were some fair stream, Soft singing through her woodland way; And I some star, whose loving beam Might in her bosom rest its ray. I wish my love were like the dew, Half hidden 'neath the rose's lip; And I the young dawn, trembling through The fragrance, none but I might sip! I wishâlike flowers that fondly meet, And cheer and charm the humblest spotâ Our lives might blend while life was sweet, And even death divide us not! WHEN THE PURSE IS FULL. Oh! happy are the hours when the purse is full; Time passes over flowers when the purse is full; Where'er our fancy wends, We are sure to meet with friends, And there's nothing that offendsâwhen the purse is full! But weary are the hours when the purse is low, And few and far the flowers when the purse is low; Where'er our footsteps range Comes the chilling breath of change, And the best of friends look strange when the purse is low! Morn cometh with a dance when the purse is full; There is music in her glance when the purse is full; Life then is something worth,â There is pleasure upon earth,â There is beauty, song, and mirthâwhen the purse is full! Yet man, we're often told, though his purse be low, Is himself the truer gold, though his purse be low; But the saying is not true, For the blindest yet may view, Man's friends are of the fewâwhen his purse is low! OH! MARY, THOUGH IN RUSSET CLAD. Oh! Mary, though in russet clad, I lov'd thee not for this world's gear; An honest heart was all I had, And that I gave thee, Mary dear. I thought not for this fop,âthis beau,â So true a love thou e'er would'st slight; But woman's heart is all for show, And glitter is her soul's delight! Oh! Mary dear,âmy Mary dear,â The world's grown dreary to my sight. He seeks thee but because he sees To woo thee sends me from thy side; Thou would'st have fewer charms to please, Did my despair not feed his pride! And could'st thou find no other walk Than that where first our vows were said? But woman's won by boast and talk,â Her favour is a brittle thread! Oh! Mary dear,âmy Mary dear,â Would thou wert true,âor I were dead! SIXTEEN AND SIXTY. SIXTEEN. Her form,âoh! you might muse till night, And never image aught so bright, So sweet,âso delicately slight,â As that half-girlish form, Which seemed just born for summer hours, For love and kindness, smiles and flowers,â Unfit for cloud or storm! Her forehead fair, as moonlight fair, Half glancing 'neath her graceful hair, Look'd like a shrine some angel there For holy thought had won; Her cheeks, where sixteen summers played, Seem'd lilies that had lived in shade, And never seen the sun: And yet not pale,âa lingering ray Of day-break in the month of May, Or rose leaf that had lost its way, Flushed through that snowy skin; And, as each hue would nectar sip, Ran dimpling to the cherry lip, That clos'd the heaven within! SIXTY. Her form,â'twas like a wintry day, But cheerful still, as if a ray Of heaven lit those temples grey, Where change would still encroach; Yet even Age had touched her face With something of a tender grace, And soften'd Time's approach! Her brow,âthe spirit was not there That first illum'd her forehead fair, But something yet, one could not spare, Like beauty did remain, And could a kindred charm impart, As dear, as sacred to the heart, As in her beauty's reign! For oh! let but the heart be kind, Let beauty linger in the mind, And even Age appears refined,â Age even can delight! Till Life, like Hope's departing star, Dies on the breast of heaven afar, And takes an angel's flight! CATHERINE SEYTON. Is it a gift so rare on earth,â So seldom proved to worldly eyes, That we invest with matchless worth,â With something more than mortal birth, The heart that for another's weal Can smiling make, and yet conceal Its own self-sacrifice? Like Curtius, when a nation's breath, Hung trembling o'er his doom; Or he who, on the pass of death, Swept tyrants to the tomb, And, foremost 'mid the combat, cried,â âMake way for Liberty!ââand died. And thus with thee, heroic girl: Though all that's feminine and fair Dwells in thy sweet and noble air,â Though love smiles out from every curl,â Yet thou, with more than woman's soul, Stept boldly forth in danger's hour, And, self-devoted, faced the power That would thy hapless Queen control. When clash'd the swords of death around,â With but one boltless door between The murderous ruffians and thy Queen,â Thou,âgraced with every female charm,â Yet prized thy living beauty less Than honour's higher loveliness;â Thou through the staple fixed thine arm, And, like the Douglas heart of old, Bade them come on,âif on they could,â Through thy resolved, heroic blood! And for this noble sacrifice,â For this devoted, bold emprise, The Poet's harp should wreathe thy name, And link it to undying fame. Hadst thou been loveless, dark, and dull, As thou wert lov'd and beautiful; For, oh! the hero's proudest crown, The bravest scutcheon sword e'er gained, The trophy dearest to renown, Is by self-sacrifice attained. And he who, for the general cause, Seeks first to reach that path sublime, Oh! give his name a world's applause,â Engrave it on the heart of Time! DON'T SAY ONE THING AND MEAN ANOTHER. The little lane,âthe greenwood lane,â Where Mary dwelt, was gay with singing; For brook and bird, in many a strain, Down vale and moor their notes were flinging. But Mary's heart was deaf to song, No longer she her tears could smother; For she had learnt,âat last,â'twas wrong To say one thing and mean another! 'Tis right,â'tis due, when hearts are true, To show that heart without deceiving, And not to speak, in idle freak, To try if one's the power of grieving! In Mary's heart, and Mary's mind, She loved one youth,âand loved no other; But Mary's tongue was oft inclin'd To say one thing and mean another! Would all might see how sweet 'twould be, If truth alone their words directed; How many a day might then be gay, That passeth now in tears, dejected. Would all might learn, and all discern, That truth keeps longest, friend or brother: Then maids be kind, and speak your mind, Nor say one thing and mean another! WHAT IS IT? It was seen in the dawn that encircled the earth, When the light of creation first leapt into birth; It sprang 'mid the ocean, and laugh'd at its roar, As it dash'd the first wave of the deep on the shore; It thrill'd through the spheres, which the archangels trod, In the hymns of devotion ascending to God; In the roar of the whirlwind it circled the sky, And the forest king shook as he heard it rush by; In wickedness rife, wheresoever ye tread, Yet 'tis never found out, for 'tis last in the head; 'Tis fond,âand 'tis faithful in fondness,âand yet 'Tis inclin'd to deceit,âand for ever in debt; Its kindness to lovers can scarce be requited, For, without it, no couple could e'er be united! You may hide it,âdivide it,âscarce leave it a name, Still it stands from a hundred concealments the same; If a window be opened, 'tis there in a minute, And where there's a garden, 'tis sure to be in it; 'Tis the pilot of day,âfirst and last to defend,â And your bed lies unmade until it is your friend! Though seen in the distance, 'tis never seen near, Though on land, yet it rarely on earth doth appear; Its changes are really surprising to some, For though powerful in diction, 'tis deaf, and 'tis dumb; 'Tis the herald of danger,âin darkness 'tis hurl'd,â The beginning of death, and the end of the world! A WIFE'S LAST CARE. Another day will pass away, Another sun in beauty rise; But ere its light shall greet thy sight, Death will have closed thy mother's eyes; And thou wilt weep to know that sleep Is set, and seal'd for evermore; Yet think, 'mid all the tears that fall, Life's pangs,âas well as joys,âare o'er. And when the last sad dues are past, And said, and sung, the service brief, Oh! look to him whose eyes are dim, And comfort him 'mid all his grief. With tender care his home prepare,â No daily act neglected leave; And put away each thing, I pray, Which, seeing, might but make him grieve. And ever seek, ere he can speak, To set all things in comfort round: However poor, content is sure, Where neatness,âkindness,âlove,âare found! He likes to see the fire burn free,â A clear, warm, welcome, kindly ray; Oh! think of this, and let him miss Thy mother little as he may! And mind the hour,âfor time's a dower Prized often only when 'tis gone; Ne'er be too late, nor let him wait,â Sharp labour brings sharp hunger on! And oh! my child, be ever mild, However hasty he may be; And God shall know how much I owe, In these my lastâlastâhours to thee! LIFE'S SHADOWS. Who ne'er hath seen the day new born, Nor wish'd for night, and yet at eve Sigh'd not again, and wish'd 'twas morn, Knows not how life through love may grieve! Who ne'er hath mourn'd o'er friendship lost,â Ne'er failed to gain the thing he sought, Knows not at what a bitter cost Resignment to hard fate is bought! Who ne'er hath set a day apart To welcome pleasure to his breast, Nor found, with disappointed heart, That day more cloudy than the rest, Knows not how sadly life beguiles,â How oft'ner far it cheats than cheers,â That not a hope, pursued with smiles, But sometime brings the Hoper tears! A SWING OF THE GATE. A swing of the gate, and a loud, loud rap, When the beams of the morning their red couch leave, Never startle the heart like a single tap, That's heard in the silence and sweetness of eve! A visit at noon never touches the heart; Ne'er at noon may a glance for a moment deceive; Nor whisper, nor music a magic impart, Like the musicâthe whisperâwe listen at eve! At evening the angels look down from above, And they that have doubted rejoice, and believe! At evening the earth breathes a spirit of love, And that is the reason we maidens love eve! THE CHERRY TREE. âSermons in stones, and good in everything.â When the dew-drop glitters clear, In the golden atmosphere, Glad and gay The blossoms play, While the spring birds carol near. And the young tree, bending low, Whiter seems than silver bow; Or the skies, When moonlight lies In the south, like piles of snow. But these beauties of the trees, Yet untouch'd by blight or breeze, Soon must fade, And be decayed: Youth leaves all things by degrees. Time sweeps on 'mid smiles or gloom Early fruitage follows bloom, Gleaming bright With ruby light, And dancing 'mid the air's perfume! Yet, when unto sweetness grown, All must fall, and be o'erthrown: Left no more Of beauty's store, Than the poor dry stalk and stone! Thus hath Man as brief a boon,â A little summer,âpassing soon,â And then the stone,â The churchyard lone, And ghosts that glide beneath the moon! THE MAIDEN'S CHOICE. A young maid sat by her cottage tree,â A beautiful maid,âat the dawn of day; Her sewing fell idle upon her knee, For her heart and her thoughts were far away; When a sober old wooer came up the dell, A wooer whose hopes, one would think, were few; But a maid's heart is a puzzle to tell,â And though old his face,âyet his coat was new; Oh! a young maid's heart is a puzzle to tell,â And though old his face,âyet his coat was new. The wooer he gave her a wistful look,â And wistful too, were the words he said; While merry she sang, like a summer brook, And play'd with her needle, and knotted the thread: He spoke of the ring and the wedding chime, He press'd her hand, and he bended his knee, And he begg'd and implor'd her to fix the time! âNo, go and ask my mother,â said she; âOh! fix it yourself, my darling,â said he; âNo, go and ask my mother,â said she. Scarce into the house had the wooer gone, When a young man leap'd o'er a neighbouring stile; And sad was the look that the youth put on, And playful and gay was the maiden's smile: âPray, who is this carle that comes here to woo, And why at your side does he talk so free? Must I ask your mother, dear Mary, too?â âNo, Harry,â she whispered, âyou must ask me!â âI'd better go in your mother to see?â âNo, Harry, noâno, you must kneel and ask me.â There was waiting one morn at the village church, Waiting, and weeping, and words of woe; For the wealthy old wooer was left in the lurch: The maid had gone off with a younger beau. Warmly the sun on the hedgerow glowed, Warmly it shone on the old farm gate; And wild was the laughter upon the road, As Harry rode off with his wedded mate! âHa, ha!â cried she,ââHo, ho!â laughed he, âThey may wait a long while ere the bride they see!â WHEN BEAUTY'S ROSE. When beauty's rose is virtue's flower,â When beauty's pride is honour's glow, I'd take that rose for better dower Than riches merely can bestow; But when that rose is born to bloom, In lieu of roses born of truth,â When vain conceit takes up the room Of flowers that live beyond our youth: Then give me, love, a plainer face, And I will ne'er adore it less, If but the heart's enchanting grace, The heart's warm feeling it express! It is not blooming cheeks alone, Nor sunny lips, nor sparkling eyes, Nor brow that seemeth beauty's throne, Wherein love's truest witchery lies! There is a charm beyond the power Of rose or lily to excel,â A charm that glads a summer hour, And gilds a wintry hour as well! So give me, love, a plainer face, And I will ne'er adore it less, If but the heart's enchanting grace, The heart's warm feeling it express. KINDNESS. Oh! if kindness sought one When her hand were needed, Low as fate had brought one, Misery might be heeded! But, in his elateness, Proud of worldly praises, Man, to grasp at greatness, Tramples man,ânot raises! With life's units rarely Man true progress classes; Kindness grants he sparely, Preaching as he passes! Though, would one befriend one, All might be befriended; If but one would mend one, All might be amended! Would man's language knew Less of mere profession,â Glad his part to do According to possession! For, while thousands wait, With no friend to heed them, Little helps are great To the hearts that need them. THE STORMS. The sky was blue from east to west, Yet there was anger in the sky, And coming storm, as well exprest As if the blackest clouds rolled by. No bird upon the air was seen, The leaves hung moveless, as in awe; A gloom was on the very green, And fear in everything we saw. So sped the day, till from the north, The warring winds drove on the rain; And red the tempest gallop'd forth, With lightning hoof, across the plain. The trees in terror swept the ground, The oak lay like a giant thrown; And from the channel'd hills around The narrow floods to spray were blown. When by the western slope, aloof From river's marge, and torrent's bound, I saw a lowly cottage roof, With garden path, and field around. And from the door, unto the blast, A helpless girl and babe were driven, Whose weeping eyes were upward cast, To Him, who sees our tears, in heaven. Scant was her garb, but from her breast She tore the last thin robe she had, And tenderly her babe caress'd, And warmer its poor bosom clad! She thought upon her shame,âher sin, And scarcely felt the tempest's rout: Alas! the bitter storm within Smote sharper than the storm without. The sun, from forth the rainy cloud, Flash'd purple jewels o'er the sky; The mist hung like a silken shroud, As, robed in gold, the storm rode by. But she, to misery still a prey, Sat shivering cold,âthe Night's lone guest; Ah me! earth storms speed soon away,â The storms of sin do never rest! DISAPPOINTMENT. Hath one young, impassion'd, breast Ever realised its dream,â Ever found that vision blest Which was once its treasur'd theme? No!â'neath all that life beguiles, Many a thorn of sorrow sleeps; Hope, that with the morning smiles, Ere the evening cometh, weeps! Who of all the pictur'd hours, Promis'd bloom, and bliss in store, Ever found but faded flowers,â Reach'd but when the charm was o'er? He who hopes may look for tears,â He who loves see love depart,â He who builds on future years, Builds himself an aching heart! PRIDE. Though Pride may show some nobleness, When Honour's its ally, Yet there is such a thing on earth, As holding heads too high! The sweetest bird builds near the ground, The loveliest flower springs low; And we must stoop for happiness, If we its worth would know. Like water that encrusts the rose, Still hard'ning to its core, So Pride encases human hearts Until they feel no more. Shut up within themselves they live, And selfishly they end A life, that never kindness did To kindred, or to friend! Whilst Virtue, like the dew of heaven, Upon the heart descends, And draws its hidden sweetness out The moreâas more it bends! For there's a strength in lowliness, Which nerves us to endure,â A heroism in distress, Which renders victory sure! The humblest being born is great, If true to his degree; His virtue illustrates his state, Whate'er that state may be!â Thus let us daily learn to love Simplicity and worth;â For not the Eagle, but the Dove, Brought Peace unto the earth! MAIDEN BEAUTY. Her hand's like a lily,â But just at the tip It hath stolen a tint Like the hue of her lip! Her breath's like the morning, When hyacinths blow; Her feet leave a blessing Wherever they go! For each one she's something To comfort or cheer; When her purse fails her wishes, She gives them a tear! E'en the sound of her step Seems to bring them relief; And they bless that sweet face Which speaks hope 'mid their grief! Her mouth's like a rose-bud, Just budding half through, When it opens at morn Amidst fragrance and dew; And her heart is a dwelling Where angels might rest, And forget their own heaven In that of her breast! COME, NAME A GOOD FELLOW. Come, name a good fellow, And drink to his health,â No matter his station, No matter his wealth! If the heart be but noble, 'Tis title enough: 'Tis the heart makes the man, Though his fortune be rough! Then name a good fellow, And to him we'll drink; And our lip with a blessing Shall hallow the brink! Come, name a good fellow,â The vintage we quaff Seems merry, and mellow, And ready to laugh! And what to enjoyment Fresh pleasure can lend?â 'Tis to toast the kind heart That to all is a friend! Then name a good fellow, And to him we'll drink; And our lip with a blessing Shall hallow the brink! THE RAIN WAS ABATING. The rain was abating, The storm seem'd to wander In thunder, that distance Made solemn and grander; Yet the night had set in, And the mountains loom'd dreary, As Mary look'd forth With a spirit less weary. She saw not the river Its wide banks o'erflowing; She reck'd not the torrents Like wild horses going; She heard not the scream Of the eagle dark flying,â Nor the shriek of her lover, Far drowning,âand dying! From his home, through the storm, 'Mid the night, did he venture, To seek that lov'd door He must never more enter! Oh! woe for the hearts Which the storm-waters sever; And woe for the hopes Which are lost,âand for ever! SYMPATHY. Oh! to see one's own emotion Make another's cheek burn bright! Oh! to mark one's own devotion Fill another's eye with light! Tears are types of woe and parting; But o'er woe a charm is thrown, When from other eyes are starting Tears that mingle with our own. Never sweeterânever dearerâ Seems the world and all it holds, Than when loving hearts see clearer All that âSympathyâ unfolds! Every thought, and look, and feelingâ Every passion we can name, Still a second-self revealing! Still anotherâyet the same! WAS THE GLASS MADE FOR PHYSIC? Was the glass made for physic? Was life made for pain? Must care and must sorrow Still visit the brain? No!âmusic and friendship Shall teach us to-night, That the glass is for liquor, And life for delight! The glass for good liquor, And life for delight! For the glass is a gladness Wherever it glows,â Wit, spirit, and song From its crystal lip flows! Blame him that with physic First dull'd its pure shine; But long life to the god Who first fill'd it with wine! Great Bacchus,âgod Bacchus, Who fill'd it with wine! PEACE. Written on seeing Landseer's celebrated Painting, so entitled. Slowly the early mists of dawn arise, A change, a movement, trembles o'er the skies; Valley and forest, mead and mountain height, Seem with faint breath to wait the morning light: And lo! a foot of beauty from its sphere, Beaming with jewels, climbs the mountain near. Whate'er it touches, by some magic bold, Blushes to ruby, or transmutes to gold! Laced by a thousand tissues, rich and fair, Woven by rainbow looms from threads of air: Auroras of a moment glad the sight, The poetry of clouds, and dews, and light! Turn where ye will, on every side behold, Ethereal pictures, framed in Nature's gold! See, the dark beech leaf, like an Indian's ear, Glitters with crystal-gold, and gem-drops clear: And every reed on which the south hath blown Seems dancing to a music of its own! Come, let us mount the cliff, the crested height, Where Dover rears her fortress to the sight;â Like beings of the deep the vessels glide, Proud of their own reflection in the tide; Proud of their mission,âwhich is War no more, But Commerce, Christian-love, from shore to shore The cannon,âsentenced ne'er again to float,â Still'd the red thunder in its murderous throat,â Lies, by the majesty of Truth o'erthrown, Rusted, dismounted, weed and moss o'ergrown. The cautious lamb hath dared to make its way Unto the very mouth which spokeâto slay! Whilst e'en the butterfly within it dips, And grass and flowers spring from its iron lips! Oh! might of Peace, that in the throat of death Can scatter bloom with thine immortal breath, And bid the timid lamb no longer heed The cannon's mouth, but there in safety feed!â Crop the wild flowers that live within its breast, And taste the sweets of nature and of rest! When will men learn, who still to battle haste, That peace is property,âand war is waste? That Education makes a Nation great, And Knowledge is the safeguard of the State? False is the triumph of the battle-hour,â The noblest triumph is in moral power. Time laughs at battles, and the fruits they earn; The conquering sword lies conquered in its turn. But there's a power which even Time can bind; E'en Time itself is vanquished by the Mind! It grasps beyond the victor's blood-won name, And marshals cent'ries on the path of fame, Then welcome, Peace!âmay Nations build thy shrine, Profess thy creed, and own thy breath divine; May Science, Literature, and Genius, spring, Like rays of glory from thine angel wing! Strike down Deception,âlet no wrong endure,â Take to thy heart the interests of the poor; And prove, O Peace, that war usurps thy right,â Not his, but thine, the victory and the might! Strength, with simplicity; with grandeur, rest; And majesty, with meekness; guard thy breast: Till War, and Misery, and Crime, be gone, And all the people of the earth are one. EPITAPH ON THE LATE SALIS SCHWABE, ESQ. Whoe'er thou art who read'st this sculptur'd line, Here pause, and learn how death becomes divine,â How holy grows the spot where rests the just,â What living flowers enwreath his lifeless dust! And learning thus what Virtue's path can give, Oh! seek thy home, and aim like him to live! Of gentle manners,âcultivated mind,â A spirit seeking good for all mankind,â A heart with every fond affection rife, Through all the dear relationships of life;â A lover of that greatness which hath birth In things of heaven, and not in gauds of earth; The high,âthe pure,âthe intellectual dower That soars from truth to truth,âfrom power to power, And seeks to prove, wherever man hath trod, That Progress is the ordinance of God! To Art,âto Science,âlending aid sincere, Anxious to cherish and expand their sphere; To welcome Knowledge as the people's friend, And bid the lowest in earth's scale ascend! Woe for the hour when that warm heart grew cold,â 'Twas the first time, to young, or poor, or old! Woe for the hour when that kind hand grew still,â 'Twas death alone could check the generous will! 'Twas death alone,âno other might succeed To keep unhelped the widow in her need! Oh! ye to whom the like rich store is given, Learn here the way that leads the heart to heaven; And you, ye poor, with flowers his sad grave strew: He was a Man!âwoe that such men are few! THE BOY-BARD. He loves all things that rambling boyhood loves,â The woods,âthe fields,âor what mere idlesse proves; To view the unwinged race their play resume, Nestling and hiding 'neath the cowslip's bloom; Or watch the dew slip down like liquid glass, Bathing the tired bee on the bladed grass; See the quick spider his torn web renew, Sparkling with atoms of the vapoury dew, Light as a dancer running o'er his line, His rope a thread, than Oberon's hair more fine! Or mark the insect take the stream alone, Columbus like, and venture the unknown! Catch the shy cricket of the field, and hear His song of Spring, free-toned and shrilly clear. Then lie with face upturning to the skies, Gazing on palaces of clouds, that rise With amber gates,âwith gold and purple trees,â Bridges of rainbows spanning heavenly seas; Or rich interior, showing couch of gold, Carpets of fleecy silver, fold on fold; In which celestial home some angel fair, Still more ethereal than ethereal air, Rests, with one hand sleep-thrown in careless grace 'Neath the charm'd beauty of her dream-warm face! Till, one by one, the cloudy curtains roll, And shut the matchless wonder from his soul. Then, with closed eyes, he questions his own mind, Wrecks of that magic paradise to find,â Some feature of that seraph-nymph to trace, Which, as he wooes, still fades from his embrace! His heart is full of unaccomplish'd deeds,â Battles for Liberty, in which he bleeds! Distinctions, honours, greatness to be won,â Some vast achievement some way to be done,â Some high emprise,âsome strange immortal joy, Swells the wild heart of that poetic boy! A thousand visions sweep athwart his brain,â His blood, like lava, flushes through each vein; Giddy with hopes, that thus his heart can cheat, He rambles on, with triumph 'neath his feet, To find, ere long, his visions melt like frost, And leave but tears, in memory of the lost! WORDS. If words could satisfy the heart, The heart might find less care; But words, like summer birds, depart, And leave but empty air. The heart, a pilgrim upon earth, Finds often, when it needs, That words are of as little worth As just so many weeds. A little said,âand truly said,â Can deeper joy impart Than hosts of words, which reach the head, But never touch the heart, The voice that wins its sunny way, A lonely home to cheer, Hath oft the fewest words to say; But, oh! those few,âhow dear! If words could satisfy the breast, The world might hold a feast; But words,âwhen summoned to the test,â Oft satisfy the least! Like plants that make a gaudy show, All blossom to the root; But whose poor nature cannot grow One particle of fruit! THE WAYWARD ONE. So modest her advances, Such softness in her lip and eye, You'd think such angel glances Were borrowed from the saints on high! 'Tis sweeter thus believing, Than doubting,âthough they say that she Deliciously deceiving, Can never long with Love agree! At morn you'd fancy really That maiden's heart is mine indeed; And speak of wedlock cheerly,â But lesser haste the better speed! You buy the ring quite boldly, And with it to her presence fly: She turns aside quite coldly, And curtseys you a brief âGood-bye!â May wrinkles seize the beauty, The sweet, bewitching, sparkling jade, Who first makes love a duty, Then laughs away the vows she made! Oh! make her less a charmer, Dear Nature, let her less excel; Or make her bosom warmer To one who loves her but too well! A NIGHT JOURNEY. Night her golden host is leading, To the wood the crow is speeding, Solemn lies the way, and lonely, Field, and lane, and forest only! Not a hut for miles appearing, Ever toiling,ânever nearing. Thoughts on wild tradition dwelling, Every step its legend telling; Robbers lurking near the hedges, Murders hid 'neath river-sedges! Many sounds, but not one cheery,â Even one's own foot creaks dreary. Gipsies down in lonesome hollows, Listening for each step that follows;â Hist!âthat bough, which snapt in parting. Distant bark of lurcher starting, Stays the foot with timid feeling, Cautious o'er the dry leaves stealing! Fast the Night her starry legions Westward calls, to other regions! See!âa hand, as of the Dawn, Sudden gleams, then swift withdrawn,â Like a maiden, shyly hiding, Blushing, loving, half-confiding! Bed!âthe curtain-silk adorning, Blinding out the golden morning,â Little recks your silken sleeper, 'Midst deep cares, and night-roads deeper, How the light, which he despises, Like a hymn of glory rises! Last, we reach the quiet village, View our cottage-field and tillage; Though with limbs both faint and weary, We forget the midnight dreary, Cares and fears, how swift we lose them, With our children at our bosom! GIPSY GLEE. When the windy clouds float wild, Threat'ning tempest from the west; When the young moon, like a child, Rocks upon the cloud's soft breast; Then sing we our gipsy glee, By the faint light merrily! When the raven shrieks on high O'er her cold and rifled nest; When her swart wing specks the sky, Just above the moon's dim crest; Then sing we our gipsy glee, By the grim light cheerily! When all evil things awake, And all good are wrapp'd in dream, Then prowl we till morning break,â Wayside hedge and willow stream; Then lurk we by bank and tree, Through the long night drearily! THE SEA SERPENT. Behemoth and Dragon old, All in song or story told, Vast or strange, Are as minnows unto me, Floating roods upon the sea, In my range: I am swifter,âstronger,âthan Lion or leviathan; Storm may shake the shuddering sky, Lightnings glare; Monarch of the main am I, And my title to deny Who will dare? Towers and palaces of kings Are the dens of vilest things Fathoms low; Fleets and armies lie decayed, Broken toys for children made, Crumbling slow. Mightiest spoils that earthly be, Are the meanest 'neath the sea,â Baubles time but tosses by, Stripp'd and bare: Coil'd 'mid ruin'd worlds I lie, And my kingdom to deny Who will dare? Prone within the primal deep, Where forgotten ages sleep, Is my lair; Monsters of the ocean slime, Gorgons of the unknown time, Guard me there. Every century I roam, And the billows shout and foam, As I dash them all awry In mid air; Monarch of the main am I, And my title to deny Who will dare? JUDGE NOT IN HASTE. Ne'er be hasty in your judgment,â Never foremost to extend Evil mention of a neighbour, Or of one you've call'd a friend! Of two reasons for an action Choose the better, not the worst; Never let the meaner motive Be the one you urge the first; But be gentle with misfortune, Never foremost to extend Evil mention of a neighbour, Or of one you've call'd a friend! Judge not with detracting spirit, Speak not with disdainful tongue; Nor, with hard and hasty feeling, Do one human creature wrong! Words there are that, sharp as Winter, Strip the little left to cheer;â Oh! be yours the kinder mission, Prone to soothe, not cause, a tear! Then be gentle with misfortune; Never foremost to extend Evil mention of a neighbour, Or of one you've call'd a friend! HOME IS WHERE THERE'S ONE TO LOVE US. Home's not merely four square walls, Though with pictures hung and gilded; Home is where Affection calls,â Filled with shrines the Heart hath builded! Home!âgo watch the faithful dove, Sailing 'neath the heaven above us; Home is where there's one to love! Home is where there's one to love us! Home's not merely roof and room,â It needs something to endear it; Home is where the heart can bloom,â Where there's some kind lip to cheer it! What is home with none to meet,â None to welcome, none to greet us? Home is sweet,âand only sweet,â Where there's one we love to meet us! THE SHIP âEXTRAVAGANCE.â Oh! Extravagance saileth in climes bright and warm, She is built for the sunlight, and not for the storm; Her anchor is gold, and her mainmast is pride,â Every sheet in the wind doth she dashingly ride! But Content is a vessel not built for display, Though she's ready and steady, come storm when it may; So give us Content as life's channel we steer,â If our pilot be Caution, we've little to fear! Oh! Extravagance saileth 'mid glitter and show, As if fortune's rich tide never ebbed in its flow; But see her at night, when her gold-light is spent, When her anchor is lost, and her silken sails rent; When the wave of destruction her shatter'd side drinks, And the billowsâha! ha!âlaugh and shout as she sinks! No!âgive us Content, as life's channel we steer, While our pilot is Caution, there's little to fear. THE BETTER SPIRIT. He prized not things as some men prize, Who reck not of the spirit's strife; But seeing earth with earthly eyes, Find common joy in common life! He would have searched the farthest clime, That garden of the soul to find, Whose flowers are precious to all time,â Whose fruits immortalize mankind. Poor heart, he said, that still would bless, Still spread thy loving light around, Men leave thee to thy loneliness,â Thy spirit hath too weak a sound. An angel's trumpet could not reach This stern and stony ear of Earth; An angel dying could not teach This mammon world,âan angel's worth EVERY MAN HAS HIS FAULT. Take life as it is,â'tis a folly to sigh, Or to seek for a treasure when seeking is vain; If friendship's a light that goes speedily by, Regretting its loss is but adding to pain. Perfection's a thing rarely found upon earth: We may cherish the hope,âand our fancy exalt; But though we meet many of honour and worth, We find, before long, Every man hath his fault. If a world we require that will always be true, We must learn where it is from the fairies or elves; The errors of friendship are easy to view,â Not so easy the errors that lie in ourselves. No!âperfection's a thing rarely found upon earth: We may cherish the hope,âand our fancy exalt; But though we meet many of honour and worth, We find, before long, Every man hath his fault. WORDS AND HEARTS. Fond words do not ensure fond hearts, Nor glances bold prove love; The tongue that deepest truth imparts, May often faltering prove. Love's ways, 'tis known, are different ways, In different tempers found; But oh!âgive me the timid gaze, That, bashful, seeks the ground! Give me the steps that softly glide, Lest earth their place should tell;â The feelings that 'neath blushes hide, As birds 'mid roses dwell;â The lips that tremble lest a word Their secret hopes betray;â The whispers 'neath the moonlight heard, That shun the ruder day! MIND YOU THAT. Should you love one dearly, Never breathe it out; Though he woo sincerely, Keep him still in doubt. Tell him love's a bubble,â Leave him still in fears; More you cause him trouble, Less he'll cause you tears!â Mind you that; More you cause him trouble, Less he'll cause you tears! Something sad in knowing, Love can ne'er endure, If, by too much showing, Love is made too sure. Pique him well, and spare not, Every time ye meet; If you seem to care not, Soon he's at your feet,â Mind you that; If you seem to care not, Soon he's at your feet! HUMBLE HAPPINESS. Oh! would some cottage home were mine, How blest the hours would glide; Life then would seem a thing divine, With Mary by my side; With not a wish but her to bless, Where'er her steps might move; My only care her happiness,â My only wealth,âher love! I'd think no roses sweeter born Than on her cheeks I view; I'd ask not for more heavenly morn Than her dear eyes of blue. No bird that sings this world below I'd think could her eclipse; For all that's sweet is doubly so, When coming from her lips. True wealth is in the heart alone, Its coin like music rings: It cometh from a brighter throne Than any earthly king's! We're poor,âbut we could live on less, And still some comfort win; When true Love shares one's humbleness, An Angel dwells therein! WE NE'ER CAN KNOW. We ne'er can know what time may show, Nor what we lose when bent to roam; But this I seeâfor love and meâ 'Twere better far I'd stayed at home. 'Twas by the stream, where lilies dream, 'Mid music by the waters given, I saw a maidâor angel strayedâ Just newly strayedâaway from heaven! Her eyes soft hue had caught their blue From summer morns, when skies are sweet; Her golden hair, like sun-clouds there, Half wander'd to her snowy feet! And oh! her lips,âthe rose that dips Its first young buds in vernal dew Were pale beside their crimson pride,â Those lips, that might a world subdue. Alas for me, that this should be, Alas that I went out to roam; My heart, 'tis clear, hath changed its sphere,â I'd better far have stayed at home. As sure as fate, with wings elate, She's borne my heart to yonder sky; And I may weep, and long watch keep, But see no angel passing by! Oh! should you meet, with snowy feet, A maiden fair,âor eyes of blue, And lips whose rose a magic throws, That thrills with love one's spirit through: Then, ere she flies to yonder skies, And seeks the Eden of her birth, Oh! call me nigh, and we will try To keep one angel upon earth!</field>
