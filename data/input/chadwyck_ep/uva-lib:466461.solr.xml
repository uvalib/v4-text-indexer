      <field name="fulltext">âBetween two lightsâthe waning light of eveâ The light of God's own morning soon to break.â TO MY FRIENDS, AROUND THE CHRISTMAS HEARTH, Greeting and Good Cheer! MINIATURE ODES. (Japanese fashion.) The Burden of the Sea. I From deep mid-ocean, in the solemn night, No wandering sail abroad, no shore in sight, What voice goes up, sonorous through the spheres, And what its burden that God only hears? II The burden of the Sea! that infinite woe Of ages, endless as its ebb and flowâ Endless and hopelessâhark the mystic song! âHow longââit seems to moanââO Lord, how long!â In Heaven. Heaven! 'tis the seeking, in God's alien places, Our loves of earth, our wept and vanished faces. 'Mid seraph songs, what strain will fill our ears? The plaintive minor of our vale of tears. May-time. âHey!â shrills the skylark, peering down below From middle ether, âEarth is white with snow.â âJoy!â pipes the linnet, on the hawthorn spray, âEarth's white with snow, but all the snow is May.â Marsh-Marigolds. It frames your portrait, the marsh-marigoldâ We culled it, with our love; and now, I see In spring-time, when its yellow buds unfold, Your face look out from each, and smile at me. Compensation. The nightingales desert their haunts of old, Desert my garden, widowed of their song. I preach contentmentâblackcaps manifold Flock in, at least, and warble all day long. Fidelity. Do some forget? Oh, my beloved, not I! Hear me across the gulphs. God lets my cry O'ertake thee. I am faithful. Love, I wait Thine advent, stedfast at the Eternal Gate. Migration. A gathering, fluttering, flitting through the sky. Hey for the South!âOn yonder mountain fork, Falls the first snow, and hark! with clash and cry, Swift, through the windy tumult, whirls the stork. Spring. Spring leaped up in the hollows. What a race I ran with him o'er meadow and green height! But when I paused, exulting in my pace, Spring laughed from windy woodlands out of sight. Illusions. I count the dead loves of my fickle youth, But, constant grown, lift unremorseful eyes: Nay, not so many loves . . but three, in soothâ âFour,â moans the living love, and moaning . . dies. Flowers. Flowers of the Spring, how lavishly has God Scattered your beauty over bank and sod! Twin flowers are mine, that blossom on God's sward, In God's own garden, but . . . the gate is barred. On the Verge. Nay, not so far, great Angel, not so far! Faint and more faint grows earth's receding star. Here, on Heaven's verge, in sight of either home, Great Angel, let me tarry . . till they come. Philomel. Once, his sweet strain the Eden noontides filled, Now, under midnight skies his notes are trilled. Poor bird! perchance he takes each twinkling star For light of Eden lattice, left ajar. The NileâEsne. I paused at Esneâweird the syrens' tune. My Nile-crew slept the pillared palms among. âOn, on!â the River muttered 'neath the moon;â âNay, tarry, tarry yet!ââthe Almehs sung. Sea-Anguish. I listen to the moaning of the Seaâ A moan upon each wave that shoreward rolls, As 'twere the murmur of all griefs that be, The confluent anguish of all stricken souls. June Wisdom. Enough of solemn lore! my mood rebelsâ I toss the tome asideâhere's merry June, The time of rosesâlife and love in tuneâ To-day, the wisdom that wears cap and bells! Apples. To sage, 'neath orchard branches, it may hap To gather wisdom from an apple's fall. Child, which is wisest, he, or I withal, That pile the golden apples in thy lap? Springlets. I. Over the winter eaves The bare boughs clamber and swingâ Through a rustle of withered leaves I hear the voice of the Spring. Year after year departs On pitiless, whirling wing, But yet, in my heart of hearts, I feel the touch of the Spring. Who knows? when in graveyard drear, I lie, and the throstles sing, I may still awake with the year, Still hear the voice of the Spring. II. Slow, horses, slow, As through the wood we goâ We would count the stars in heaven, Hear the grasses grow. Watch the cloudlets few Dappling the deep blue, In our open palms outspread, Catch the blessÃ¨d dew. Slow, horses, slow, As through the wood we goâ We would see fair Dian rise, With her huntress bow. We would hear the breeze Ruffling the dim treesâ Hear its sweet love-ditty set To endless harmonies. Slow, horses, slow, As through the wood we goâ All the beauty of the night, We would learn and know. III. In Spring I make my moanâ O solemn Sycamore, Wail, wail, my love is flownâ Thou'lt see my love no more! O Sycamore above, Hast never a thrush to sing A little dirge for my love, For my love that died in the Spring? White May-bush, toss me downâ Toss me a shroud of snow, Toss me a wreath and crown, For the grave where she lies low. Toll, pine-tree on the height, With thy grim, black branches tollâ Toll, toll, through day and night, For the peace of her sweet soul! IV. Said the Sun to the heart of the Earthâ âOpen! the year's at its turn!â Said the EarthââI am ready for birthâ I waken, I quicken, I yearn.â Said the SunââI give kiss upon kissâ Count me the kisses that fall.â Said the EarthââFor each kiss, this and thisâ Crocus and cowslip and all.â Said the SunââThere's an ending of sleepâ Up, minions, wanton and play!â Said the EarthââYes, yes, if you'll keep The cloud and the cold away.â V. I count on my fingersâ It's long, very long, For fity sweet singers Are setting me wrong. I count on my fingers The joys of the Spring, But fifty new singers Are waiting to sing. Fifty new splendours, Fifty new pleasuresâ I have done with my fingers For counting my treasures, In the green of the earth, And the blue of the sky, Where the first beetle crosses The first butterfly. âThere shall be no more Sea.â There shall be no more Sea!âOh, Land of Heaven, How shall we front thy glories? We, that come From such grey skies, that hear for evermore, The beating of the wind and of the rain On bitter moorlandsâMerciful high God! Can we be happy by Thy great white throne, Amongst thy singing angels? Can we tune Our tremulous, broken voices to those rapt, Grand Allelujahs?âFather, shall we tread, Joyful, the causeways of Thy city of gold, Between the walls of jasper, where no wind Ruffles the Sabbath calm, nor any moan Of anguish enters inâwe are so used To anguish in this world that Thou hast made! There shall be no more tearsâThy hand shall wipe Tears from all eyes. We hear the word . . and weep. There shall be no more SeaâOh! Land of Heaven, Through all thy shimmering palmsâthrough all thy glow And glory of Godhead, shall we not repine? Shall we not strain our vision, from high peaks And crystal gorges, yearning to behold The desolate seas of homeâyearning to hear The great wave-voices thunder once again? Falling. Yes, we lived and loved together, In God's celestial placesâ In His pure, unsinning places: With the love-light on our faces, In the blue and balmy weather, We lived and loved together. Who was it that betrayed us? Did the Bird of Paradise, That sat so mute above usâ That watched us and surveyed us, With his sharp, unsleeping eyes, As if he'd fain reprove us? Love, was it he betrayed us? Or did the crystal river, That flashed like barb from quiver, And with angry gleam dismayed us, When it found us sitting ever, So close, so close together, In God's celestial weatherâ Who was it, love, betrayed us? Who was it told the warden Of our enchanted garden, That we lived and loved together, In its sweet celestial weather? Who spoke of unrepentance, And ah! what judge passed sentence? For now, we're falling, falling, Thrust out from holy places, And the levin-light appalling Blasts the love-light from our faces: And hoot and howl and hiss Scoff at us from the abyss, While God's angels of the glory Tell, with shame, our sinning story;â Yes, we're falling, falling ever, Through the fierce and fiery weatherâ Yes, we're falling, Falling, Falling, But we're falling, love Together. A Last Page. The Voice saith âWrite.â The Voice saith âWrite and die.â I write and die. Faint, fainter on the page, Line follows line, with dreary gasp and pause Of agony. . . This book hath had the prime And splendour of my being: it shall have Its outflow and its ending. Make it good, Heaven and the angels! Christ, confirm it good! Soft hands pluck at meâeyes, like tender stars, Glimmer through deeps of dark. A sighing wind Sweeps through my house of life and flutters wide Its portals. . . Lo, I come! O Arms of God, Ye everlasting Arms, uphold me here On the dread verge! The Voice saith âDie.â . . I die. To M. P. (âIn excelsior.â) âI have a sonnet that will serve the turn To give the onset to my good advice.â The Two Gentlemen of Verona. I Young singer of the spring-time and the mornâ May, with that pure, pale blossom of a nameâ I see thy face set to the hill of Fame, Thy foot in act to climb. Ah, drear, forlorn, The perilous path, with peak and precipice And giddy ledge, and toppling fields of ice, But over all . . the glory. Climb, for now A far, faint radiance, from the eternal steeps Descending, like a voiceless welcome leaps, And touching thee, transfigures lip and brow. Climb, singer of the Morning and the May! Climb, strong of heart, and win thy Promised Land; And when the prime and splendour of the day Are thine at length . . God keep thee in His hand! II Art weary, climber? Seems the summit far As Heaven, or Death? Art still among the snows? Hark! from yon cloud beneath thee grows and grows A music sweet, where sweetest musics areâ The lark'sâhe sings for love, delicious sprite! For love he follows thee, with circling flight, And fain would follow still, from star to star, To catch the spheric tune; but now he sings His songs of homeâof farm and croft and cornâ The homestead, all the dear, familiar things He winnows up to thee, with beat of wings, So hoping he may leave thee less forlorn. Ah! now he faltersânow his lay is doneâ Art rested, climber? Courage! up and on! Seven. INSCRIBED TO MISS BEATRICE CRAWHALL. She was a child of earthâ (Twin throstles hymned her birth), A little maid of seven. 'Twas in the winter cold, Death's foot was on the wold; Death opened wide the door, With visage fierce and frore, Where the dying lay unshriven. The little maid, in fright, Fled out into the nightâ Fled fleet across the snow. Ah! which way should she go? What refuge could she find? She hurried down the dell, She crossed the croft as well, She was met there by the Wind. And the Wind set up a shout; Whirling round and round about, Till he caught the tiny waifâ Caught, and hugged, and held her safe; Then bore her swift on high, Eagle-winged, from earth to sky, Where friend nor foe could find them, And Death was left behind them. They traversed the golden bars Of the comets and trailing stars; Higher they rose, and higher Through a tangle of blossom and fire, Till they came to a castle fine, All agate and almondine, With silver lamps on the walls, And shimmering waterfalls, That made a musical din. And there he set her downâ 'Twas the gate of God's own town, And the little maid crept in. And so, in the court of the King, And down His golden street, Is heard the patter and ring Of little human feet. And when the saints rejoice, And the great archangels sing, A little human voice Joins in their musicking. God counts them in their going, The eternal years of heaven; But for the child, no growingâ She is still a maid of seven. She looks down from the wall, And sees Death prowling round; But his shadow cannot fall On the bright, celestial ground. She scours the lilied lea, At sound of windy weather, And the old mad Wind and she Are happy and glad together. He takes up his tiny waif, He ruffles her ruddy hair; He hugs her and holds her safe, But, parting, leaves her there. God counts them in their goingâ The eternal years of heaven; But for the child, no growing, By a grace of His bestowing, She is still a maid of seven. Under the Olives. L'aubade. From the French of Jean Aicard. âNow lithe and listen, Norine, I sing this song for thee; With pipe and tambourine, Now lithe and listen, ma mie!â âToo well I know thy song, Too trite that song for me; Cease, cease, or else ere long Thou'lt drive me into the sea.â âA foolish threat, Norine! Thy flight would soon be o'er; I'd follow fast, I ween, And bring thee safe to shore.â âAh, yes; methinks I feel Already thy rude grip; But I'm a wriggling eel, And through thy fingers slip.â âAn eel! well have thy wish! An eel is slippery and sly; But the fisher catches the fish, And I am the fisher, I!â âThen I'll be a streamlet clear, Deep hid in a dewy dell.ââ âAnd I'll be its bank, my dear, And I'll be its bed as well.â âOr a rose, a rose am I, O'er a garden wall that creeps.ââ âAnd I, the honey bee, That in the heart of it sleeps.â âSee, see, I'm a star so fair.ââ âAnd I, a cloud in the skies; I shadow thy shining hairâ I veil thy beautiful eyes.â âBut while thou'rt aloft in the sky, I'll tap at the convent door; A sorrowful nun am I, A nun for evermore.â âGo in at the convent door, But when thou'rt called to confess, Thou'lt find I am there before, The priest to shrive and bless.â âWhat matters, priest or churl? For, see, my cheek grows pale; See, I'm the poor dead girl The sisters weep and bewail.â âIf dead, be this thy doom. If dead, I hold thee fast. I'm the earth, and in thy tomb Thou'lt be mine at lastâat last!â âAh, now I'm touched, in soothâ I yieldâour strife is over. There! Kiss me on the mouthâ Kiss me and be my lover!â Cecilis. (An Ã¦sthetic intensity.) âMy Lady's pets and perts and prettiesâ And losing them were worst of pities.â Marzial's Gallery of Pigeons. Cecilis was the chief angÃ¨l Of Lilith's house in heaven, In each hand she held a sweet weazÃ¨l; They were a brood of seven. One was yellow, and two were red, And one was cramoisie, And twain were beryl from tail to head, And the last was vermilly. In the Eden meadows the hay was down, And the bells were ringing in Eden town. Cecilis takes her walks abroadâ Of Lilith's house she is chief angÃ¨l, In each hand she holds a sweet weazÃ¨l, Tethered with crystal cord. And five little cherubs, dainty-fair, With each in his hand a sweet weazÃ¨l, To the plumy thickets with her repair, And frisk and frolic in glade and dell. For in Eden meadows the hay is down, And the bells are ringing in Eden town. âCecilis, Cecilis, Cecilis! Cecilis, Cecilis, what is this?ââ From Lilith's house the cry doth comeâ âWhat hast thou done with my sweet weazÃ¨ls? I see them leaping a-down the dellsâ I see them scampering over the fellsâ Cecilis, Cecilis, bring them home! Bring them home from the dusky dells, My pretty cherubs, my sweet weazÃ¨ls!â For in Eden meadows the hay is down, And the bells are ringing in Eden town. Cecilis calls from morn till night, For her pets and pretties no more in sightâ For the sweet weazÃ¨ls 'mid the rocks and fellsâ âCecilis, Cecilis, Cecilis! Cecilis, Cecilis, what is this?â From Lilith's house the cry doth come,â âCecilis, Cecilis, bring them homeâ Bring them home from the deeps and dells, My pretty cherubs, my sweet weazÃ¨ls!â For in Eden meadows the hay is down, And the bells are tolling in Eden town. âCecilis, Cecilis, Cecilis! Cecilis, Cecilis, what is this?â Of Lilith's house she is chief angÃ¨l;â Weeping, lamenting she wanders home, And Lilith shudders to see her come, To see, in her hand, no sweet weazÃ¨l. And so that broodâthat brood of seven WeazÃ¨ls, Queen Lilith's stock and store, And her cherubs five, from the house of heaven, Fled and were found again no more. While in Eden meadows the hay was down, And the bells were tolling in Eden town. A Witch-Agony. Ha! weird the nightâ Not a star in sight, And over the wastes of the sky, Rapid and black, Like a ravening pack Of wolves, the clouds race by. For the winds are out, With a whoop and a shout, And the waters whirl on their way, Flickering and flashing, Surging and dashing, Roaring and rending their prey. Ha! weird the night, and my soul is glad, For the winds are all mad and the waters mad, And I am as mad as they! Ho! Hurricane, set the rocks a-roll, And topple the pine-woods low! Ho! Thunder of heaven, grumble and growl! Ho! Avalanche, shake the snow! I follow your path Of wreck and of wrath, I laugh, I revel, I flyâ I rive the air With a shriek of despair, When the lightning leaps from the sky! Oh, horror and ruin, Oh, fierce undoing, Downfall and doom and dismay!â Oh, weird the night, and my soul is glad, For the Hurricane's mad, and the Avalanche mad, And I am as mad as they! See the world's on fire, on fireâ On fire, above and below! My brain's in a blazeâI rave, I craze, I scatter sparks as I go. I'm aflame, I'm aflame!âlike a levin bolt, I blast and wither on hill and holtâ I shrivel heather and fernâ My lips are kist by a crimson mistâ I burn, I burn, I burn! Like a comet I thread the gorge alone, With a glare and a heat of hellâ Hark, how the mountains mutter and moan, How the wind tolls loud like a knell! How it tolls, how it tolls, As for passing souls,â How it tolls like a deep death-bell! My brain's in a blaze. . . Ha! the blaze grows dimâ The fire flickers low, flickers lowâ An agony wrenches spirit and limb, A death-damp drips from my brow. Ho! Queen, Ho! Hecate, vouchsafe me aidâ I tremble, I faint, I am sore afraidâ Ho Ashtaroth, where art thou? I am smitten and buffetedâdragged and drivenâ Accursed of earth and accursed of heavenâ Hissed, hooted, harriedâah God! unshriven, I drop in a bloody dew,â And Hell-gate, horrible, opens wideâ Opens, with horrible shapes insideâ Opens, and . . . . draws me through.</field>
