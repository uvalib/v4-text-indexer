      <field name="fulltext">POEMS WRITTEN AT 15 AND 16. MISFORTUNE. See how the sun is melting into gold The autumn leaves; and under them behold A lingering flowerâhow richly clothed with light! Yet half the hue by a leaf's shade from sight Concealed: what pity darkly thus to hide This fair terrestrial beauty's sunlight pride! But lo! the leaf that shades it, struck with light, Flashes back red and gold upon the sight Of the great sun. Thus is Misfortune here; The flower our life, the leaf's dark shade the sphere Of sorrow; and could we but know the source From whence it comes, we should not care to force Away from us that shade which is perchance Our glory, like the leaf which doth enhance The beauty of the flower. E'en as we see, Nature unfolds, in part, her greatest mystery. DESTINYâA DREAM. I seemed to walk into a land of night Filled with the drifting cries of wind, where hands, Waste hands, imploring for the lost, were strained With the last moan on desolate lips; the breath, Breathed in the midnight, of departing life, The mother's cursing cry to GOD for breath, Snatched from her darling boy, and the strange light Of eyes that saw Hell, lurid through the dark, Grow hot upon them dying, till they died. And there the snow fell slowly, flake by flake, Cold through the straining hands and wicked forms And a low wind beat up and down with spray. And as I stood a shape came creeping up, Muffling its face, and seemed to peer at me With wicked rolling eyes, yet seemed as tho' It would avoid my gaze and shadowy grew Like Death; and then I said â'Tis Destiny!â And with a wild agony I rushed at it And tore the air with all my force and clutched And caught at it and, in a wild desire, Cast the dark from me, and the shade had fled! Brake the grey dawn! and with the dawn a Voice! âThat shadow was thy Destiny, thyself, Thyself art thine own Fate; for what hath man, Passionate man, of hate and love, to do With Destiny? Man's love, whose altar-fires Are kindled with the fuel of slain self. Love is no love save challenged with the thoughts And fears of death; and therefore death was given To make a trial and a proof of love, To strengthen or to shatter it for aye That man's love may grow likest heaven's; coin Stamped with the image of eternity. So slay the self, for thus thou slayest Fate Slaying the self, thus thou art free of worlds Slaying the self, thou art most nobly thouâ. ELEGY. What can a painted portrait do? Will that her memory guard? I must rememberâto forgetâ GOD knows that would be hard! 'Tis winter with herâon her cheek And brow there's not a rose, Yet winter has its snow, and see Like untouched mountain snows Her brow above the sable bier Pale as a star-beam shows. As o'er a midnight sea of foam A ray from a higher sphere Shines, so she beamed upon my heart Surging with grief and fear. As one who looks upon a tree Whose leaves are falling fast When all are fallenâhe sees the moon Stand grand above the blast; So shall her soul rise high and clear When earth's decay is o'erâ Not dust to dust but flower to flowers, So she for evermore Shall blossom in the earth we tread, In which we lay her stilly, May she make rosier the rose And lovelier the lily, More vivid all the violets And when the swinging trees Moan, let her voice be heard still, soft And in the evening breeze Let her sweet tones, companionless As nightingales in song, Flood moonlit lattices and soothe A breast that burns with wrong. So may she soothe my troubled heart With air from calmer sphere. This lock which never now can fade I'll keep, nor shed a tear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS WRITTEN AT 19. TO THE ANGEL OF DEATH Thou art cold with acquaintance of sorrow Our cries are but sounds of a sleep Thine ears and thine eyes hast thou hardened And with time hast forgotten to weep Yet at first was there never repining When the fresh young world was born Ere the years brought strength and silence And the centuries gave thee scorn? Did no prayer from thee rise to the heavens Nor one sigh that it might not be, Oh! at first when thine ears must hearken, Oh! at first when thine eyes must see Nor some look of a child on the mother In that idle last embrace Bring a strange imperfect pity To thy calm and perfect face? Then I deem there was something of anguish O'er the early hopeless bier Tho' divine thou wast touched for a moment To a vain terrestrial tear It may be that strong in thy wisdom Thy hand makes the wild heart cease Like the hand of an infinite pity With the cool of an infinite peace Ah no! when we ask of a Father What region of light we shall reach Cometh o'er thee some silence of knowledge Some sorrow too strong for speech Then at length in thine eyes comes the pity In thine ears comes the anguish of old For a moment thou wouldest have spoken It is pastâthou art still, thou art coldâ ORESTES. Me in far lands Did Justice call, cold queen among the dead, Who, after hurry, heat, and fret, at length Have leisure for her calm immortal voice That gathers peace from the great deeps of GOD. She called me saying, âI heard a cry by nightâ Go thou, and question notâmy will awaits Fulfilment in thy hallsâe'en now the dead Cries out before me in the under-worldâ Seek not to justify thyselfâbe strong In me, and I will shew thee wise in time; For, though my face be dark to men, yet they Who truly follow me through storm or shine For them the veil shall fall, and they shall see They walked with Wisdom, though they knew her not.â So sped I home, and from the under-world. For ever came a wind that filled my sails Cold, like a spirit; and ever Her still voice Spake over shoreless seas and fathomless deeps And in great calms, as from a colder world; Nor slacked I sail by day nor yet when night Fell on my running keel and shut me in All filled with flying faces of revenge. So sped I on, filled with a voice divineâ And hardly wist I whom I was to slay,â My Motherâbut a vague heroic dream Possessed me; fired to do the will of godsâ I lost the man in ministers of heavenâ Nor took I note of sandbank, nor of storm, Nor of the ocean's thunders, when the shores All round had fadedâleaving me alone, I knew I could not die till I had slainâ But, when I came once more upon the land That reared me, all the sweetness of old days Came back upon me: I stood as from a dream Waked to a sudden sad realityâ And when far off I saw those ancient towers, The palaces and places of my youth, I longed to fall into my mother's arms And tell a thousand tales of near escapes And lo! the nurse that fondled me of yore Fell with glad tears upon my neck, and told Of how she and my mother all this while Had dreamed of all I was to doâand said How dear I should be to my mother' eyes Her words that shook me, shook not my resolves, For even then there came that sterner voice Echoing to what was highest in the soul. Then, like to those who have a work on earth And put far from them lips of wife or child And gird them to the accomplishmentâso I Strode inânor saw at all mine ancient halls And struckâmy father's murderessânot my mother. And when I had smitten, lo, the strength of gods Passed from me, and the old familiar halls Reeled back on meâdim statues that of old, Holding my mother's hand. I marvelled atâ And questioned her of eachâand she lies thereâ My mother; aye my mother now, O hair That once I played with in these hallsâO eyes That for a moment knew me as I came And lightened up and trembled into love The nextâwere darkened by my hand. Ah me! Ye will not look upon me in that world Yet thou perchance art happier if thou goest Into some land of winds and drifting leaves To sleep without a star, without a sound For ever and for everâbut for me Hell hungersâand the restless Furies waitâ Then the dark Curse that sits upon the towers Bowed down her awful headâthus satisfiedâ And I fled forthâa murdererâthro' the world. GLADYS and IRENE. A DEATH-BED. Gladys. âThe Sun is set, and yet a light of day Still lingers on the windows of the place. A lifeless moon is in the clear cold heaven, In the still radiance of the watery skies The lonely lightnings of the evening star! The glow of heaven hath passed: at length the voice Of every bird hath failed, there's not a breath In the wide world. O break not with a sound The ecstasy of the eternal being! E'en now He resteth, dreaming of new worlds: And now the vault is deepening, and the stars Burst into light each moment, till at length Like an eternity the endless heavens Break open to the very feet of GOD O I can hate no moreâit dies away That little fever, 'tis of the stifling air Of this small sphere, the meanness of the world: And only love is large enough.â Irene. âO my sister do not forget me! I am alone in all the world.â Gladys. âNow take my hand! before there come to you The cold breath of the dawn, and all things wake, I shall be gone from you; O, I shall be In heaven before the lark, and, when he wakes And sings, and soars towards the eternal gates, And in far skies his music's lost to you, 'Twill come to me like the last notes of earth. O now my soul can reach to that high place; The heaven comes down on me with all her lightsâ I fear I may forget youâO farewell!â THOUGHTS AT SUNRISE. Reprinted from âTHE SPECTATORâ of January 12, 1884. The summer day is waning, and the morn Breaks over steaming streams and silent fields, With dim, far voices of the early dawn. God and his world are now at peace; this calm, Even now, might deepen to Eternity. Oh, break it not! oh, stain it not! O God, Stay thou that rising Sun, nor let him rise Once more upon the weary sin and strife, And cries that curse him thro' the burning blue! Come hither, O ye sons of men! and kneel,â Pray to a God ye never prayed to yet, Who in his wide and wistful tenderness Maketh each day the self-same dawn that broke On Eden,âthat, remembering what ye were, The Dawn's sweet innocence might call ye back,â An awful, mute appeal to turn again. Nay, but he suffers in that Heaven of heavens. About him are the deeps, Space, with her sounds, The Heaven, with all her dreams of star and sun, The singing of a thousand worlds; to him, Serene, immortal beings bow them low. All these are perfect, yet he hears afar, In that dim, little planet that he loves, Man jarring ever on his harmonies. Aye, yearning in his cold and perfect worlds For Man who might have sympathy with him, Move with conceptions vast and burning thoughts From beauty unto beauty, peopling worlds, He grieves, though not the less a God for grief. Man is all out of tune with his design, Who might have shared in that first splendid thought, Conception striving with an utter Space, Sound with eternal still that knew her not, And light with the vague dark, till at the last He struck his vast conception into bounds. Still makes he for mankind the innocent dawn, Noon, twilight, and the night, that makes the heart Break into singing at her shining stars. Yet is man but a trembling worshipper, Who heeds not that world-cry from Calvaryâ A God appealing to the love of man, Laying aside all terror and all powerâ That should have echoed in him, made the world One fearless Heaven, without a thought of Hell,â Man, who can learn not through defeat and death Sorrow's last gift a sympathy with God.</field>
