CHAPTER XI. ‚ÄúFor that power haven not we Him hol to Maken In non degre; But helthe A?en to him Most gon Be him that him it leide vppon; And elles but he wele him hele sende, Be vs get he non In non Ende.‚Äù Thanne Axede him the king Anon tho ‚ÄòHowgh A?ens the Egipciens he scholde do; ?if with hem heeld he Ony bataille, In what Manere it myhte him Availle.‚Äô Thanne the devel him Answerid ful sone, ‚Äú√ûere-Offen Answere mown we ?even √æ? none: Tyl that goddis Man be Owt past, Of vs An Answere non thow hast.‚Äù Thanne spak Josephes there Anon Ryht, ‚ÄúI Conioure the be the vertu of God Almyht, And be the myht Also Of the Trenite, That the sothe here thou schewe to me.‚Äù And the devel him Answerid Agein ‚ÄúThat he ne Cowde not In Certein; Of thing that was to Come, he Cowde not telle, What Aventure so that him Euere befelle.‚Äù CHAPTER XII. And In the mene while Of this talking Cometh A messenger tho to the king, And knelid to-forn him vppon kis kne: ‚ÄúSire kyng, newe tydinges I bringe to √æ? That ben bothe Evel and perylous, Of Tholomes king so dispetous; Into thi lond now Entred he Is, And with him gret strengthe with-owten Mis; And Oriable thi Cite they han take, And Abowtes In-virown thei don wrake, That so the Contre distroied is be him Into the Castel Of valachim. For On hors-bak with him don Ride Twenty thousend be his side, And On foote Also there ben Fourti thowsend Men harneysed Clen; And ?if that Castel he mown haue, Nothing Of thi lond wil he save; Ne thens wil he non fote gon Til they ben ?olden Euerichon; [Fo]r that Is now the stre gest hold [In] thi lond be Manye a fold. And ?it his Avow Made he there (That Alle his Meyne gan it to here) That Owt Of that Contre wold he not pas Tyl he were Crowned king In sarras,‚Äù‚Äî Whiche that was the Chef Cite Of king Eualach his lond, I telle the.‚Äî And whanne the king herde him thus sein, Sore he him Abaschte In Certein; And ?it the more Abascht was he pleinli For the wordis that Iosephes spak Openli, ‚ÄòThat thre dayes &amp; thre Nyht In his Enemyes daunger to be Owtriht, And that to the prikke Of deth he schold be browht;‚Äô And this Euere was In Eualache thowht; But for √æat he was A man Of so gret prowesse, He made non semblaunt Of non distresse, But A?ens herte he made good Chere, [S]eenge Alle tho that there were, [A]nd swor Anon be his Creaunce, ‚ÄòThat what so him Euere happede be chaunce, ?if At that sege he myhte him fynde, He wold don him Remeve be som kynde.‚Äô Anon his sonde he dide to sende Ouer Al tho, Into Euerich ende, To Alle tho that Of him took Ony fe, ‚ÄòAnon with him that thei scholden be, And On the Morwe to ben Gadering Atte Castel Of Tarabe with-owten Taryenge,‚Äô That twenty Miles from sarras Is, And fro valachim Sixtene, More ne Mis, Where As Tholomes Atte Sege was. Thus Abowten sent Eualach Into Everi plas; Thus Abowtes be his sel he sente, ‚ÄòThat Eche man scholde don his Ente[nte], That weren weldy Armes to bere, A?ens here Enemyes to fensen hem there. And ho that A?ens his Comandementis were, What so he be that it doth there, His lordschepe from him wil he take, And but Ryht A povre Man him Make.‚Äô And On the Morwe the king gan to remeve, And Iosephes to him Cam to taken his leve; ‚ÄúSire kyng, hennes thou gynnest to Go, But thow ne wost what forto do; For thou ne Art seker to Comen Agein, But there forto dyen In Certein. But thus My God sente Onto the Be me his Servaunt, As thou myht se, ‚ÄòThat thow scholdest Remembren the wel Of whom thow Come Everydel, And of what Maner kynde &amp; of lynage Thow Art I-Come to this high parage. But thou supposist that noman it knowe; But I Can the tellen Al be Rowe. Be the grace Of my God Almyht I schal the telle, I the A-plyht; For Conceil may √æere non heled be From him that Sit In Maieste. Thow were born In fravnce lond, As the holi gost me doth vndirstond, In A Old Cite Of fraunce, As I wene, That Miaux is Called there bedene; And there thow were A pore Mannes sone, That to Maken schon was thanne his wone; And this Owghtest thow to knowen ful wel, For thow it hast Sein this Everydel. For whanne Augustus Cesar Emperour was Of Rome xxxij ?er; In that plas He wende king Of Alle kinges haue ben; And so it him thowhte that it was sen; But Crist of Marie was born In his tyme, that I Rehersed beforn, That tho king Of Alle kynges was Thorwgh the world In Every plas. And whanne here-Offen herde Augustus Cesar Be hise Clerkis that weren bothe wis &amp; war, Thanne he gan to wexen Gretly In dowte Lest Of his Empire to putten him Owte, And that Al the Contre Of Rome Abowte, To that lord scholden worschepen &amp; dowte. Thanne Niste he Not what forto don, But Abowtes Al Rome he sente Anon; Thorwgh Owt Al that Contre Anon his Messengeres sente he, ‚ÄòThat Euery man &amp; womman Also To him A peny scholde ?elden tho, As In Manere Of A knowelechinge, As In weye Of-Soiettis to here kynge. And, bencheson that Fraunce was thanne Of Anothir Maner kende Of Manne, To hem he sente In this Manere As, Sire, I the schal now tellen here: An hundred knyhtes be trews Aftir he sente, And Aftir An hundred knyhtes dowghtren presente, That Maidenis scholde ben Everichon,‚Äî And thus his Messages Gonne forth to gon,‚Äî And An hundred knave children Al In fere, Not passeng the Age thanne of fyve ?ere, But Rathere lasse thanne Ony More; That time this was his Comaundement thore. And whanne these tydinges weren Comen Into fraunce, Mochel they Merveilled thanne Of this Chaunce; And thanne Chosen they In Euery Cite Be lot, As that time here hap myhte be. So thanne it happed, As I telle now the, That Owt Of Miaux that Cite, That tweyne Maydenes Chosen weren for sothe, And that An Erlis dowghtren weren thei bothe Hos Name was Erl Of Siuayn, That lord of Miaux was, &amp; Of the Contre Certain. And whanne the lot on hem √æus gan falle, Thanne mosten thei forth nedis with Alle; And vppon the, tho, fyl the tother lot, Where √æou myhtest ben Excused not, For thow were At the Age Of fyve ?er, And Also these Maidenis bothe briht &amp; Cler; That so wit these Maydenes forth were √æou led, As to-fore I haue here now to the Seid. And whanne that to Rome ?e weren I-Come, The peple Abowtes ?ow Cam On A throme, And ?ow gonnen faste to beholde: ?e hadden tho Of Bewte so Manifolde. And whanne thow were comen to twenty ?ere, Thanne bothe Maidenes deyden Ryht there; For the ton ne lyved After the tothir But thre Monthes, It was non Othir. Thanne Aftyr, the took Tiberius Sesar, That Aftir Augustus was emperour thar, And the hadde tho Ryht In gret Cherte, And to An Erl the sente for thi bewte‚Äî Erl Felys he hyghte Of Svlie,‚Äî To him were thow lad In hie: And whanne that thow to him were browht, Ful mochel thow were Euere In his thowht, For the ful dere to him he held; And After ful Evele didest thou him ?eld. For it befil that vppon A day His Eldest sone &amp; thou wenten to play, That so In Anger ?e fillen tho bothe, That there thow slowe his sone forsothe. And whanne thou haddes thus him slo, Thanne to Tholomes gonne thou go, That Of babiloyne thilke time king was, And werre he held A?ens Olifernus; For Olifernus king was riht tho with-outen d[owte] There As now thow Art Of Al the Contre Abowte. And Anon As thow to him were gon, There A knyht he made the Anon; And so moche love thanne he Caste to the, That Amonge Al his Ost he ?af the powste; And Aboven Alle Othere he ?af the powere, Ouer Alle his Ost to Gouernen there, For that thow were Of so gret prowesse Of Manhod, &amp; ful Of hardinesse, So that On his Enemys Avenged he was, And hem distroiede In that plas. And thanne to the ?af he that lond, And there holich put it Into thin hond. Now myhtest [thou] knowen &amp; vndyrstonde, That I knowe whennes &amp; of what londe That thou were bothen bigeten &amp; born,‚Äî Lik As I haue the Rehersed beforn,‚Äî And from so gret povert to hy dignete; Remembre the wel what I telle the; And therfore the sente to sein be me The grete God of Al Cristiente, That Of thi self thow schost han Minde; And thowgh √æat vnder, √æou hast men of gret kynde, And Moche peple In bataille √æ? Abowte, In herte scholdest thou not be prowte; For thi lyges, they nothing ben, But As A wardein hem to besen; And therfore haue thou this In Mende, For but As On Man thow Art Of kende, And As sone deyen thow schal As the porest Man doth Ouer-al; Therfore scholdest thow be powre &amp; Mek, And vppon thi Creatour beleven Ek, That Into this world √æ? made forth go, For with-Owten him thow myht not do; And ?if thou like not him for thi kyng to holde, Owt Of thi regne √æou gost Ryht Mani-folde: For wel may he be Clepid A kyng, That Endeles lasteth euere his Reyneng; This is Crist Goddis sone Of hevene, That Into √æ? Maide Alyhte be thaungelis stevene. For Alle Mennes hertes he doth knowe, And Alle here thowghtes vppon A rowe; &amp; √æat the schal putten Into thin Enemyes hond, And Aftir the deliueren, thou vndirstond; For that ther nys non lord ne√æer God but he To whom Ony honour longeth to be. Wherfore, as Only On god &amp; Almyhty, Thow Owest him to worschepyn al Only; For bothe this torment &amp; this Noysance He the now sendeth, for his Creaunce Thow hast Refused, &amp; Ek his lore That he in Avicion hath schewed before.‚Äù Thanne seide king Eualach Anon Agein, ‚ÄúMaister Iosephes, I preie √æ? telle me plein What that Avisioun was forto Mene, That thou it woldest declaren me Clene.‚Äù ‚ÄúCertes,‚Äù quod Iosephes, ‚Äúnay how so befalle, Tyl thow haue broken thy Mawmettis alle, And that in theke high lord to hauen ful Creaunce That the May deliueren from Alle Noysaunce. And Alle lyveng thing enstablisched Is, Wheche that √æ? heyest king is of blys.‚Äù ‚Äú[B]e my Creance,‚Äù quod Eualach tho, ‚ÄúThis Bataylle myn herte goth sore vnto; And bothe ?oure fadyr &amp; Ek ?e Of Riht good Conceyl behygten me; ?yf that I wolde On ?ow beleve, ?e seiden Ryht wel that I scholde preve Be wheche victorie of myne Enemys to have, And Aftir my deth my sowle to save.‚Äù ‚ÄúCertein, Sire,‚Äù quod Iosephes tho, ‚ÄúThat Conceil I the ?af, &amp; ?it Mo, ?if thow wilt On him beleven stedfastly, And him worschepen As Almyhty. And ?if thow wilt not don As I the teche, Be war lest god wele taken wreche; And but thow him worschepe As me √æou seest, In body &amp; sowle distroyed thou beest Of him that Of Alle thinges Is domes man; The helpen &amp; socoure ful wel he Can.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow Certein,‚Äù quod this Eualach √æ? king, ‚ÄúAnd ?e wolden ?even me swich conseilling That Of Myn Enemyes victorie to haue, And therto my lif that he wolde save,‚Äî On him Onliche I wolde beleve, And Al my Creaunce I wele Repreve.‚Äù Thanne spak Anon Iosephes to the kyng: ‚ÄúNow herkeneth, Sire, to my talkyng. Do bringe now thi scheld to-fore me, And Anothir Maner thing schalt thow se.‚Äù And whanne this scheld to-fore Iosephes was, Anon he Comanded In that plas A lytel pece thanne Of cloth so red To-fore him be browht Into that sted. And the kyng Anon with √æat biddinge A pece Of Red Silk he dyde him bringe, And kutte there-offe two peces Anon In the sihte of hem Echon,‚Äî Eche pece A Fote of lengthe was,‚Äî Wher-offen A Crois he made In that plas, And takked it vppon the kynges scheld, Wherwith he Rod thanne Into √æ? feld. And whanne thus he hadde don, To kyng Eualach thanne spak he Anon: ‚ÄúSyxt thow now this signe that I haue Mad?‚Äù ‚Äú?e forsothe,‚Äù thanne kyng Eualach Said. ‚ÄúCertes,‚Äù quod Iosephes, ‚ÄúI telle it the, What Manere Of Man so Evere he be, And he wele stedfastli belevene On this, Were he neuere in so moche sorwe O√æer distres, That he ne schal Anon deliuered be Of Alle Manere deseisse And Aduersite.

And no Mo ?at[es] weren there-vppon Where that [Ma]n Mihte Owht owt gon, But A litel g[ate] In A Corner That there-vppon was devised ther. And Of plein Erthe to-forn √æat gate was, For two Chariettes to Meten On In √æat plas, The whiche but xxx pas was Of lengthe; For it was A pyl Of ful riht gret strengthe. But Alle the strengthis Of this to discryve, It were to long, be my lyve; Therfore to passen Over In schort Matere Of declareng Of this Castel I wile now here: And In this place king Eualach this Castel made For the strengest plot In √æ? world √æat he hadde. Now whanne kyng Eualach thus Redy was, Forth Took he his Iorne In that plas, And Entrede Into A ful fair Forest; Thus he Comandede bothe lest &amp; Mest, And Comanded Alle his Men there Anon riht Hem Redy to Armen forto fyht, For he hadde Sent forth A spye In that Morwening thanne ful Erlye, To Aspien Tholomes &amp; his Ost There that they lien with so gret bost.

But whanne this Ost Gan hem Aspye, ‚ÄúTresown! tresown!‚Äù thei gonne to Crye; And Anon to Armes they ronne ful faste, For Of here lyves they weren Agaste; But fewe of hem there ne ben That they weren Redy Armed Clen, For Evere they hadden A supposenge That kyng Eualach wolde for Ony thinge That Sege Remeven ?if he myhte; And that he it wolde don he susposid ful rihte. Thanne kyng Eualach his men In that tyde To-ward this Ost Faste gonne they Ride,‚Äî More vigeryousely neuere Reden Men Into non place thanne they diden then,‚Äî And Tholomes men that On foote were, Eualach his men here hors Slowen there; So thanne, bothe parties On foote thei be; There grete Manslawghtre Men Miht se, How that Eualache men Tholomes men slowe, For ther was Sorwe &amp; grynteng of teth Inowe, So that Of bothe partyes ded there been Bet than Fiftene thowsend, As men miht seen; And there manye Of his men lost Eualach: And whanne this he sawgh, he torned his bak; Thanne he &amp; his Meyne that On lyve were, Toward A Castel fledden tho there, Wheche Name Of that Castel was, IClepid was ‚ÄòComes‚Äô In Every plas,‚Äî And thedir ful faste gonnen they hye, He &amp; his Meine ful Sekerlye; That from theke bataille no more it Nas But As twey Miles In that plas, So that Tholomes Chased him so faste That it wax nyht thanne Att√´ laste; Wherthorwgh Manye Of hise Men Loste this Tholome In the Chas then; For tho that fledden knewen ful wel The next weye to Comes Castel, Wherthorwgh Eualach his men goten socour sone, And Tholome In that Chas lost Manione; So that Tholomes, bencheson Of the Nyht, From that Chas departid Anon Ryht, And to his loggeng homward he wente.

Thanne here Eyen vpe they Caste, &amp; sien there Tholome Comen Atte laste, That Comeng was tho to the segeward. Now he begynneth bataille strong &amp; hard; For he sente his Men there forth to-forn, Weneng to him non of hem to han lorn,‚Äî For he wende that Of Men so gret plente With-Inne the Cite Of Orkauz hadden not be. And whanne Tholome his mes-men he sawh so fle, And Also Men vn-Armed with him hadde he, Anon Comanded he In hye, ‚ÄòThe Armure Of the hurt men hastelye Of hem to taken, and hem √æer-with dyhte, That they myhten ben Redy forto fyhte.‚Äô Thanne this Tholomes ferst gan owt Ryde Afore Al the pres At that Tyde, And Axede his men that fled tho were, ‚ÄòWhat Manere Of thing that thei sien there;‚Äô And they him Answerid tho sone Anon, And tolde him Al how it gan gon, ‚ÄòThat In Orkauz they fownden Eualach king, And there with him A gret gadering,‚Äô ‚ÄúThat So Manie werrours we wenden not han be In Al his lond, Sire kyng, Certeinle; And there, At A ryht streit passage, On thi men dide he mochel Damage, For so Manie men ther ben ded That no man kan nombre In √æat sted.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat, how goth this?‚Äù thanne quod Tholome, ‚ÄúIs Eualach isswed owt Of that Cite?‚Äù ‚Äú?e sire,‚Äù quod they, ‚Äú‚Äîbe Owre lewte, And that Ryht sone scholen ?e se,‚Äî Prekyng vppon his destrer, And with him Al his power; As so faste As he may hye, Here he foleweth vs faste bye.‚Äù And whanne Tholome herde Al this, Fol sore Abaisched he was I-wys, And his Meyne Comanded to stondyn stille, For to herkenen what was tho his wille,‚Äî He preyde hem holy Alle in this degre ‚ÄòThat Neuere non Of hem ne scholden fle, What Aventure that henge Ouer here hed, Tyl that to-Forn hem they sien him ded.‚Äô ‚ÄúSire,‚Äù quod they, ‚Äúthanne were late to fle, And thow to-forn vs slayn there be.‚Äù ‚ÄúLordynges,‚Äù quod Tholome, ‚ÄúI schal this day ?ow helpen &amp; Socoure what that I May; Not-withstonding myn hy parage, And √æerto two &amp; thrytty winter of age, ?it stormes and batailles haue I seen As Manye As somme that here now been; And therfore, As that ?e loven ?oure bodily honour, So beth Of goode herte now In this stoure.‚Äù And whanne Eualach this gan to beholde, He him bethowhte In Manifolde What was the Cawse Of the Restreyneng Of the Meyne of Tholomes the kyng. Thanne thowhte he As A wis werrour That Abyden hadde Mani An hard stour, ‚ÄòThat Sum gret Strengthe Of peple √æere was A?ens him Comeng Into that plas.‚Äô That king Eualach his barons dide Calle, And hem tolde what Aventures myht befalle, ‚ÄòAnd how that kyng Tholomes was there ny, With Ryht a strong Meyne √æere faste by.‚Äô So thanne hol to gederis thanne wente they tho, Tyl that they ny Tholomes Ost were Comen to: Into tweyne bowe-drawhtes lengthe, So Fer Assembled Eualach &amp; Al his strengthe. And thanne there Eualach devised Anon His Meyne Into fowre batailles to be don, Of the wheche the ferste bataille be-took he To that ful worthy werrour Sire Seraphe, That So worthily hadde him ferst born, Lyk As I haue ?ow rehersed here-beforn. And his Steward, that An hardy man was, The seconde bataille hadde In that plas; And to Anothir Old worthi werrour √æ? thridde bataille he betook In that strowr, Hos Name was Cleped Archymedes, As I ?ow here telle with-Owten les; And him Self the Fourthe bataille hadde, That In theke tyme so wel koundeed &amp; ladde. And whanne thus his batailles diuysed weren Alle, An Old knyht to him thanne gan he Calle, That was bothe ful trewe &amp; hardy, That Ieconyas was Cleped trewly; And to him thanne for riht gret trost The passage he be-tok, As nedis he most, In keping it to deliuere to On Man, So moche Of werre wel Cowde he than, That non Of Tholomes men √æere paste, Ne non Other, for non haste. And Also there Charged him he That he scholde taken kepe to that Cite, ‚ÄúFor there-Inne I lefte but fewe Meyne It forto kepen, As I telle the,‚Äî Not passeng Of Men Six score Be √æ? grete hundred, lasse ne more,‚Äî And An Old knyht here wardein to be, Sire Iekonyas, As I telle it the; And therfore that non passe be thin hond, That Cyte to don Schame O√æer schond.‚Äù That Iekonyas tho forth him wente, His lordis Comaundement to don presente. And whanne Tholome Al this beheld, That Eualach Enbatailled him In the feeld, Thanne Anon he Ordeyned viij batailles Of his Meyne with-Owten Failles, Of the wheche tweyn √æ? ferst Ordeyned were Vppon the steward to Assemblen there; And the Secund bataille devised he Vppon Eualachs Nevev forto be,‚Äî The wheche hyht Archemedes A worthy Man In stour &amp; pres, For the thridde bataille hadde he In honde Of Eualach, As I vndirstonde;‚Äî And I my self In the vijthe bataille wil be Vppon Eualach that Is so fre; And the Rereward schal be the viijthe bataille, Vppon Seraphe with-Owten Faille, That worthy Conqwerour Evere he was, Therfore he dred him In that plas. And ?it kepte Tholome to his Availles, In his Refrescheng, twey batailles, That vppon Eualach Scholden Come Aftyr that the gret storm were done. And so to-gedere Faste they Ronne, And this storm tho they be-gonne, Vppon Ech of Eualache, bataylles two, And thus to-gedere they gonnen go. Thanne sawgh Tholomes In that plase That more Meyne Of his ther was That In that feld gan there gon, Ten Men of his A?ens Eualache On. Thus bothe batailles devised weren there In Maner As I ?ow haue Reherced Ere, Bothe On the ton Syde An vppon the tothir, So that vnder hem bothe was there fair fothir; So that Eualach hadde in eche bataille, I wene, Ten thowsend and thre hundred men bedene, What On hors and Ek On Foote, So Manye he hadde I wel woote; And In Eche Of Tholomes batailles were Sixtene thowsend, As it Reherseth here; And ?it Manie Of his Men weren lost to-Fore At theke streite passage, As I tolde ?ow Ore. Now Eualach his knyhtes Calleth, Of what manere Aventure that him befallith; He Clepeth forth lord, dwk, Erl, and bachelere, And Al his peple that was there: ‚ÄúLo, sires!‚Äù he seide, ‚Äúworthi men ?e be, And Mochel han knowen Of Chyvalre; ?onder Tholome hath Ten A?ens Oure On, And [?it] hopen we Ryht wel to don, &amp; therfore Of good Comfort let vs now be; And thenketh what wrong he doth ?ow &amp; me; Into My lond to Entren with-Owten leve, Me thinketh he doth me gret Repreve; Therfore, And ?e ben goode men this day, Ful wel his Mede Qwyten me May, And the victorie Of the bataille this day to have, And therto More worschepe thanne we conne krave; &amp; √æerto the Egipcien neuere schal ?ow Abyde In bataylle, ne√æer In feld, At non Tyde. And this I preie ?ow Enterly, That ?e wolden strong &amp; Myhtly Tweyne the ferste schowres O√æer thre; And be that tyme here haste schal past be, And thanne fresch scholen ?e be to fyht Whanne they han lost Al here Myht, And thus discomfite hem Schole we In this Manere, As ?e mown Se. Now behold what worschepe it were Hem to discomfite In this Manere! And beholdeth now, As ?e Mown se, What Meyne that he hath more thanne we. I not what I schal sein More trewelye; ?e knowen bothe worschepe &amp; velonye; And therfore I Conceille ?ow Echon, That for drede Of deth nothing ?e don, Nethir for presonement In no weye, That ?ow Myht Torne to velonye, Ne that Aftir be vs Oure Children reproved be, Whanne Owt Of this world passed ben we.‚Äù And whanne that he thus hadde told his tale, He Sawgh twey batailles comen In A vale, That weren Redy to the Assemblyng. Anon Seraphe was ware Of √æat thing, And A?ens hem faste gan he to Ryde As so faste As the hors Myht gon √æat tyde; And Owt he sprang As fyr Offe brond, With a boystous Tool In his hond, Tyl that Aproched they weren so Ner As the Mowntaunce Of A bowedrawht √æer. To-gederis Faste tho they Ronne, And there they newe game be-gonne; Eche, Other down there threw wel faste, An Many On bothe sides to therthe were caste. And Eualach kyng be-held Al this, That In the Rere-warde was I-wis, And hadde ful gret Rowthe &amp; pyte That for him his brother distroied schold be, Other be slayn, Other taken presoner; Ful moche Sorwe In herte hadde he ther, And with his herte he sighed wel sore, And with his Eyen wepte he thore; Thanne his helm vp he Caste tho, &amp; bothe scheld &amp; spere gan from him do, And down he Enclynede Of his destrere, &amp; In this Maner seide As ?e mown here: ‚ÄúAlas, that I so Cursed A kaytyf, That for me my bro√æer scholde lesen his lyf! Alas, how schold it I qwyten to the, Thowh my lyf thy gwerdon scholde be! For this kendenesse that √æou dost for Me, I ne hadde neuere good to qwiten it to the; Therfore it is seid ful trewelye That In trewe herte was neuere trecherye. Now mote the kepen, Seraphe, Every-where, That Lord that I the Signe bere Of here! And ?if he be verray god, As they tellen me, Into his Governaunce holich I betake the, Thy body from peryl &amp; schame to kepen In Alle places where-so ?e ben, And √æat to √æ? heyest worschepe ?ow bringe, That Evere hadde Man On Erthe levynge.‚Äù Now beholde here and se How ful Of Mercy &amp; Of pyte That is the blisful king of hevene, How sone he herde the Synful stevene! Lo! for that so hertely he made his preiere, How sone that the goode lord gan him here, And grauntid him Al his hol Entent; The wheche was √æere Anon sene verement; For Aftir tyme that Eualach hadde thus preid,‚Äî As that to-Fore ?e han herd me Seid,‚Äî Aftirward, dureng that bataille, Alle Maner Of men that him gonne Asaille, To grownde wenten thei Everichon, And his Enemyes Of him hadde power non, Ne non dedly wownde √æat day Cam him to, For Owht √æat his Enemyes Cowden do; For that day gat he So mochel worldly honour, That Alle √æat him beheld In that stour Sien neuere swich Anothir worldly man To smyten the strokes that he smot than, So that they seide Al In fere, ‚ÄòThat Eualach were scomfyt ?if he ne were, And bothe his worschepe &amp; his lond That day hadde be Reft Owt Of his hond.‚Äô But Go we now to the Ryhte weye, And herkene how Seraph√´s gan to pleye: Whanne the tweye batailles On him were set, They wenden han put him to gret thret, For so many speris broken there was, That It semed to Alle √æ? in theke plas That Al A forest hadde borsten In sunder, So hidous was the Noise, &amp; so ful of wonder; And whanne here speris thus to-broken were, Here swerdis they pulden Owt Al in fere, Here knyves and here Gesarmes bothe, And grete Axes Also forsothe, And Othir wepenis Mani On Mo. And thus A?ens Seraphe gonne they to go, There forto preven here Maistrye Vp-On Seraphe with-Owten lye; That so gret Occision Of Men there was Ifeld to Grounde Annon In that plas With the hydous wepenis that weren there, For so wondirful strokes were neuer sein Ere, What vppon helmes, &amp; vppon scheldes, And vppon hawberkes that flowen into feldes, So that it semed there A gret Mownteyn Of hors &amp; Men that there weren Slayn, And Of here wepenis that lyen hem by; So wonderful sihte it was tho trewly That no tonge ne Myhte it thanne telle, But Only he that Alle thing gan spelle, Of whom that Cometh Alle Connenge From begynneng Into the Endenge. And now scholen ?e heren More In Eche degre How that Aftir it fyl Of this Semble: Ful wondirfulli wel diden Seraphes Men Whanne Into that Semble they entred then; But Of the prowesse and the worthi dede, Of the hardynesse And Of the Manhede That Seraphe dide with his Owne hond, It is ful hard to Ony man forto vndirstond; And Of the Merveilles that be him wrowht was, Weren neuere Of Man Sein In non plas; For A gret Ax took he betwenen both his honde, Where-with he wrowghte ful Mochel schonde, Whiche that was trenchaunt Scharpe &amp; Merveillous, Riht A merveillous tool &amp; an hidous, And therto him self was A large Man, With grete thyes, As I discryven kan, And in the Scholdres bothe strong &amp; large, Where-vppon he scholde beren his targe, With grete stepe Eyen In his hed Also, And strongliche boned he was therto, With smale handes And fyngres longe, And therto gret strengthe Euere Amonge; So that A merveillous siht it was to se Him thus On horsbak, As thinketh Me, And A good hors that him bar, Whanne Into that semble he prekid thar, So that he Ferde lik A man ful Of prowesse Whanne that his scheld he threw down in that presse, And his hors bridel he fastened Ful wel, And gan to sterin him with his Ax Of Stel, So that theke day ne Failled he nowht That All√´ tho to Grownde he browht That to-forn him stoden In his weye, Wherfore Of him they hadden gret Eye; Somme, the hed from the body he smot; Somme, the Armes; somme √æ? scholdres, foot-hot; And somme the legges, And somme √æ? body On sondir, And somme he so Claf As Strok Of thondir; And Manie hors Slowgh he ded In the feld, And be him Many knyht ded vndir his scheld, And Many A footman he slowh that stownde, And Manie Of here hors he browhte to Grownde, That so Manie Merveilles wrowhte he that day That Into this tyme ?it of him speken we May; Of his Manhod &amp; his Chevalrye It were I-nowgh An herowde to discrye, But To him self It was vnknowenge Of his Owne Merveillous werkynge, For he supposed not withInne him selve That he hadde the Myht Of ten Men O√æer twelve; For √æ? prowesse that he dyde, ne knew he nowht. Lo what for him he wrowht that him bowht! And he thowht ful litel that be Eualache preyer Was tho prowesse that he hadde there, The wheche was A man bothe Ioyful &amp; Glad, And Alle his knyhtes thanne beholden he bad The prowesse Of this Seraph√´, And Of the Merveilles that did he, And of the world he was the worthiest knyht As that day tho semede be his fyht; For Tholomes Men he made to fle, And of hem Slowgh ful gret plente. And whanne Tholomes beheld this Cas, And how √æat his Men losten here plas, Thanne gret sorwe &amp; schame he hadde; Anon the secund bataille he gon forth badde. And whanne Seraphes Sawgh hem Comen Ny, With hem he thowhte to Meten Sadly; Anon he seide to his knyht√´s bolde, ‚ÄòThat stedfaste to-Gederis scholde they hem holde; And that A good stert they scholden Abyde, And leten hem Come vppon hem Ride.‚Äô So that they Comen In gret haste A-down Abowtes Seraphes Men In-virown, And On hem broken they here lawnces faste, And ?it remeved not Seraphes Men til At √æ? laste; And here scheldes they leiden faste vppon, And ?it stooden they stille As Ony ston, And rested hem stille In that place Til they Sien the tyme whanne nede was; And thanne Atte the laste they torned Again, So that Many A man was there slayn, Where-Offen was gret breth Of hors men, But scars On Of Seraphes A?ens of Tholomes ten, The wheche that discomfited were, And In that feeld lyen still there. But Atte laste √æ? two fresch batailles Seraphes Men ful sore Asaylles, And strokes On hem leide ful sore, So that they myht Suffren no More, But torned here bak And gonnen to fle, And forsoken the grownd of Seraph√´. And whanne Seraphe gan this beholde, Seraphe gan hem Ascrie Mani-folde; ?it Seraphe left not for than, But Torned A?en As A worthi Man, And his Ax in his hondys he bar, And Manie Of hem √æer-with slowghe thar; He to-Clef bothe habiriown &amp; hawberk, And Amonges hem Made A sory werk: Here helmes he to-Clef A-two, Here Scheldis he Alto-schatered Also, Here hedis he Clef Into the teth,‚Äî Thus hem he serveth that A?ens him beth,‚Äî So that non Man his dyntes Myhte Abyde They weren so Merveillous At that tyde. And whanne kyng Eualach steward this beheld, That to seraphe were Comen two batailles In √æ? feeld, And how freschly they fowhten him Agein, Where-Offen he was A-drad Certein‚Äî For non Er sawgh Eualache Steward Ony Nede To gon to him ward, And Seraphe to socouren In that plas‚Äî To him ward Rod he A ful gret pas. ‚ÄúNow Certein,‚Äù quod this Steward, ‚ÄúWith Seraphe it stond so hard That Al the world him helpe ne may, So mochel peple vppon him lay; And ?if I Ony lengere Abyde, He nis but ded At this Tyde;‚Äù And Anon with that word there He prekede forth On his destrere, And Al his Meyne holyche with him; There began Anon bataille ful Grym; And to the tweyne batailles Comen they Anon, That vppon kyng Eualach scholde hauen gon. And whanne they sy √æ? steward thus Comenge, A?ens hem tho batailles Comen prekynge Lik As the tothere diden before To Seraphe, whereby thei han lore Mochel Of Tholomes Meyne, That be Seraphe Slayn there be, ‚ÄúNow,‚Äù quod Eualach, ‚ÄúGod, for thy Myht, So spede Seraphe that Gentyl knyht!‚Äù Thanne this Steward, to his lordis seid he, ‚ÄúLoke√æ stedfastly that to-Gederis ?e be; For ?if we these two batailles mown breke, I hope Of Tholome kyng to ben Awreke; For I ne thenke neuere Er to blynne Til that I kyng Tholomes bataille be with-Inne; And there I thenke him forto sle, Ryht Among Al his Owne Meyne.‚Äù So wenten thei forth be that Ordenaunce To knowen how that myht ben here Chaunce, And fulfilden his Comaundement, And Redin forth with riht good Entent. But that schowr was As scharpe As A dart, For there many Mo weren On Tholomes part Thanne On the Stewardis Serly; Therfore was that stour ful Stordy; But ?it Comen they neuere so faste vppon, That the stewardis Men A?ens hem gonne gon, Til that to-gederis they weren Met The lengthe of A Gleyve with-owten let; but Euere the Steward let hem pase Tyl that with CCC knyhtes Entred he wase‚Äî And somwhat Mo Of his Meyne‚Äî With-Inne Tholomes bataille Entred he, That Fyve thowsend hadde he with him Of noble knyhtes both stowt &amp; Grym. And whanne thus to-Gederis weren they Met, Many A sterne st[r]ok there was Set Be-twenen both√´ partyes there, So that Of Tholomes lost Manie √æer were As thowh they hadden falle In-to the se, So mani Of Tholomes Men lost there be. So that forth prekyd the steward In √æat pres Evene Ryht to Tholome; er wolde he not ses. And Amonges his Men him smot he so, That down to the erthe he gan to Go, This kyng Tholome, both hors &amp; Man, Thus to therthe the steward smot him than; And there he Trosted him forto han Slayn, Where-Offen the Steward was ful fayn, And At the Erthe tho stille him held, And wend han slayn him vndir his scheld. Thanne Cam √æere On Of Tholomes knyhtes, That Myhti &amp; strong was In fyhtes, And smot this Steward, there he lay Vppon Tholome his lord In fay. Betwene bothe scholdres he him thorwh smot, As he On Tholome lay tho foot-hot; So √æat Anon this steward Torned Agein, And so that knyht smot In Certein, And vppon Tholome he made him to falle, That Anon tho Creaunt he Gan to Calle; And that Sawgh the stewardes Meyne, And faste to him there gonne they fle, This Tholome to han kept O√æer han Slayn; This was here purpos thanne In Certayn. And Tholomes Men that gonnen Aspie, And to here lord they gonne faste hie, Him forto deliueren from his Fon, Also Faste As they Mihten gon. And whanne king eualach this Melle gan beholde, Ful sone his herte be-gan to Colde; And whanne that he Sawgh this Mell√´ In thre diuers places thus thanne to be, How that the peple Of Seraphee With fourre bataylles fowghten hee, And Of the Meyne Of his Stewarde That with tweyne batailles fowhten wel harde, And Also for his Stewardis body, He was ful of Sorwen Sekerly, That A?ens Tholomeres bataille Whiche that he gan so sore to Asaille; So Eualach Comanded his nevew tho The stewardis Men Socour forto do, ‚ÄúAnd I his Body now wele Socoure, O√æer with him to deyen In that schowre.‚Äù Anon bothe these batailles gonnen Owt Glide As Sparkles owt Of fyr doth Ony tyde, And vppon here Enemyes they gonne to go, Kyng Eualach and Archemedes Also; Wheche Archemedes tho semblen be-gan Forto Refreschen there the stewardis Men. Thanne wolden √æese batailles non longere Abyde, But to here lord Tholome tho gonnen thei Glyde; For thei flowen to him tho ful faste, So Archymedes Men On hem gonnen thraste; So fledde they to here lord for socour, For the grete Angwich Of that stour. And Eualach‚Äîthat to Tholome was gone, His Steward forto don socour sone,‚Äî He saugh, &amp; stood, &amp; there beheld, How, with as grete Mases As they myht weld, On his Steward [they] leiden strokes Mani-folde, That pite &amp; Rowthe it was to be-holde, With here Mases Coronaled with Stel,‚Äî And Al this beheld Eualach ful wel,‚Äî And Thre wowndes On his body were, That Tholomes Foot-men hadde ?oven hem there; For so with Arwes was he hyrt, Wheche hyrt tho Mihte he not Astyrt. And whanne Eualach thus Saugh him be-stad, And Amonges hem thanne forth So there lad, And therto his Meyne So wownded were, That Sore Agresyd was he there, So that Anon he gan forth to Ryde, And Alle his knyhtes be his syde; And Er that he to his Steward Myht wynne, Fowl betrapped so was he hem with-Inne, They him hadde taken As presonere, And with hem forth gonne leden there. And whanne that he Cam In-to the plase There As his Steward so Taken wase, His helm Of taken they hadde, And to-forn Tholomes they him ladde, And to the Erthe there they hem Caste. And thanne Cam forth Tholome Atte laste; Anon he drowgh his Sword So Feer, The stewardis hed to han smeten Of ther; For Erthly Man was non leveng In londe That so moche he hated, ne wolde schonde. And whanne that Tholomez scholde han smeten Of his hed, And he myht han had leyser In that sted, He Sawgh kyng Eualach So faste Comenge That he was let Of his purposinge; And whanne he Sawh √æat it myht not be so, Thanne Otherwise he gan forto do, Vnder his hawberk In-lawnced he Thorwgh the body, And that was pyte. And whanne he hadde So I-do, Anon to his hors tho gan he to go; And A?ens kyng Eualach gan he Ryde, And Eualach A?ens him with gret pryde; And so sore there to-gederis they Mette, &amp; There so sore strokes Ech On Other sette. That bothe here scheldes [flowe] Into √æ? feld, And Ech Of hem bad Other ?eld. And whanne to-broken weren here lawnces, Thanne Aftyr behappid many harde Chaunces; Thanne On foote gonne they Alyghte, And there began A wondir strong Fyghte; Thanne gonnen they there A scharp Schowr That was Angwyschschows &amp; ful Of dolowr, So that Mochel peple was there ded, Of Men And Ek hors In that sted. And Evere kyng Eualach enforsed him faste Thorwgh Tholomes pres Forto han paste Into the place there that his Steward lay, ?if he myhte it Recovere that day; But Euere they putten him of with gret strengthe That Entren he ne Myhte In brede ne lengthe, Tyl bothe batailles weren discomfit that tyde, That Ferst Archemedes [a?ens] gan to Ryde. And whanne this Bataille discomfit was Thorwgh Eualache Meyne In that plas, And flowen to here lord Tholome, And After Of Eualache Meyne gret plente, &amp; whanne that Tholome Sawgh thus his Ost Ouer-throwen &amp; Slayn with gret bost, And Eualache Men After hem purswen tho,‚Äî Ful Mochel sorwe In his herte gan to go; Thanne Tholomes his Men gan to Ascrye With A lowd voys, And Ryht An hye, ‚ÄúOn Eualache Men torneth ?e A?en, And vppon him proveth that ?e men ben!‚Äù And So Torned they the hedes Of here hors Thanne A?ens here Enemyes with gret fors; And they On foote schotten faste Wit venymed Arwes whiles they wolde laste, So that Manye hors there they Slowe, And moche Othir peple In that Rowe; Ful hard &amp; strong was the Mell√´, &amp; Mochel peple lost In Eche degre, Of bothe partyes there Mani On To the deth on bothe sides were they don, But Only Of Eualache Meyne There was persched gret plente. Thanne whanne Tholome gan beholde That he hadde the bettere be manifolde, Anon A Massage tho he Owt sente To him that the viijthe bataille kepte presente, ‚ÄòThat In non wise Asemblen Scholde he, Tyl that Comaundement he hadde of Me,‚Äô Thus to him he sente Anon ful Ryf, Non Other wyse to don, In peyne Of his [l]if. CHAPTER XIV. SERAPHE'S DEEDS, AND THE END OF THE BATTLE. Now lete vs Speken Of Seraph√´, Of his worthinesse, &amp; Of his Meyne That ?it with fowre batailles don fyhte, And kepen here Owne As men Of Myhte; For As it is put Into Memorye For On Of the most wondir Storye That Euere was Rad In Ony book, Owther In Storye, As Men Cowden look, For so lytel A peple &amp; so vigerous A?ens so Manye &amp; so therto dispetous; For ther myhte neuere Man hem with-stonde Whiles they hadden Ony wepone On honde, So that Seraphes Men On horse &amp; Foote Heelden Tholomes Men wondir hote. But that storm ne dured neuer han Myhte, Ne hadde ben thorgwh Seraphes Fyhte; For So mochel prowesse was neuere In Man‚Äî As for the Meyne that he hadde than‚Äî As was In him Seyn that day there, For so they seiden that At √æ? stowr were. For so worthy A knyht In non plase Neuere to-forn there sein wase; For his plase wolde he not forgo, That he and his Feleschepe hadde taken hem to; Alle Made he here bakkes forto bende, And Of here lyves browht hem to Ende That In his weye Gonnen forto stonde. With his Ax he wrowhte hem Mochel schonde; For here hedes he smot Of Faste, Here scheldis &amp; hawberkes Alto-braste, And leyd hem ded there In the feeld, Many A knyht there vndir his Scheld; Helmes, hawberkes, &amp; ventaylles Also, Alle to the Grownde he dyde hem go; Legges &amp; Armes Of smot he there, And thus mochel peple slowgh In diuers Manere, That his Ax he bathede In Mennes blood From the point to the hylt, there As he stood; And Al this Of him Suffred this Meyne √æat A?ens him fowhten, &amp; weren with Tholome. For √æat day ne myhten they distroyen his powere For non thing that they Cowden don there; But Al that day heeld him In On degre; And not wery[er] thanne Semed he Thanne he was whanne he gan ferst to fyht, Nether no More he lakked his Myhte,‚Äî Of wheche him self vndirstonding he took, As tellith the storye Of this book;‚Äî [For] wery Of his Armure was he not thore, [N]o more thanne he was In the Morneng before, [A]nd As fresch he was Evere Forto fyhte As In the Morwneng he was, I the plyhte, And As vigerows he was Onne forto se As thowgh non thing to-forn him hadde be. And there As his Men ful wery they were, &amp; Al forfowghten In that place there, He hem Comforted with Al his Myht, And Of Al that stowr he ne took but lyht, And hem Reqwered ful vegerously That be him they scholden Abyden by, For As mochel grace In him was Alone As In Alle here bodyes Every-Chone; For, ne hadde Only the myht Of him ne be, Clene hadde ben lost Al his Meyne; For Elles myhten they neuere han kept √æat plase, For the Multitude Of [tho] that A?ens hem wase; But from Seraphe they fledden Euerichon‚Äî Alle Tholomes Meyne be On And be On,‚Äî And thus dured Seraphe Al that day Til it was past fer noon tho In fay. Thanne gan there A Messenger forth to gon To kyng Tholome, there he was Anon, And seide to him In this Manere, ‚ÄúSire, A wondirful knyht Is now there, That Al this day hath kept the Iorrn√´ A?ens thy fowre batailles, Sire Tholome; And ?it discomfit Neuere they been In non thing that we Conne seen, And Euere A?ens On Of his knyhtes There ben tweyne Of Owre Owtryhtes And Mo Sire, ?if I Scholde Say, Thanne I Cowde Certeinly Rekene parfay; And, Sire Tholome, As I the now seye, They ne doren not Comen In Seraph√´s weye.‚Äù Whanne Tholome herde here-Offen tho telle, Wel Mochel wonder In his herte tho Felle, What Merveillous knyht that it scholde be That so Mochel hadde Of powste: ‚ÄúGo Faste now,‚Äù quod thanne Tholome, ‚ÄúTo Manarcus, My brothir so fre, And Seye that I sent him gretyng, Him Forto hyen Ouer Alle thing With Al the bataille that is with him, That he Come Adown Also sterne &amp; Grim, And that Of his bataille [he] ne leve not On, But with him bringen thedir Euerichon, And, as vigorously &amp; with As gret prowesse As Euere Entred men Into Ony presse, That he On that Entren Anon, And As moche distroccioun As he may don, That he ne spare for non thing, But with that knyht to haue Meting.‚Äù And whanne Manarcus here-Offen herde telle, That with that worth knyht he scholde Melle, [I]n herte he was bothe glad &amp; blithe, And Tholome thanked ful Mani A sithe. That tyme Anon was Manarcus Redy, And Alle his Meyne that weren him by; And so faste they Comen vppon, With dyvers wepenis Manion, And there Maden they here Assembling [V]ppon Seraphe, that wery was Of Fyhting. Now be-gan there A myschefful stour That was Angwisschous And Ful Of dolowr; For Seraphe, Scars there he hadde Twenty thowsend Men that he with him ladde, And Manarcus browhte with him Fowrty thowsend bothe Stowte &amp; Grym, And In his Rerewarde thowsendes fiftene Of faire harneissed Men, wel piked &amp; Clene; And Seraphes Meyne, So wery they were, And so forfowhten toforetymes there, That non lengere ne Myhten they fyhte, But Torned here bakk√´s √æere Anon Ryhte. And whanne Seraph√´ that beheeld, His Meyne As-scomfited In the feld, Ful tendirly thanne there wepte he tho, And mochel Morneng &amp; sorwe he Made √æerto: ‚ÄúAlas!‚Äù quod he, ‚Äúwhat is now myn Aventure, For nedis I most Abyden this schowre, And my Meyne thus from Me go! Now what Is best for me to do? For non Other helpe here Nys Certein, But be taken, O√æer ded, vppon this pleyn!‚Äù And At that word his Ax he took In honde, His Meyne to Rescrye, ?if he myhte fonde; But so Fer weren they I-fled than, That tornen A?en wolde they for non Man; And so fer wenten they Evene streyht Anon To the passage Of the blody Roch Of ston. And whanne Alle this beheld tho Seraph√´ And that it thanne Myhte non Othirwise be, His hors hed he torned tho Ageyn, And with him but Enlevene knyhtes Certein. And there As was the thykkest pres, He with his knyhtes Entrede, &amp; wolde not ses. And so it happede, As he gan forth Ryde, He mette Manarkus At that Tyde; In the Midde weye As he gan go, To-Gederes they metten bothe two; And there left [he] vpe his Ax tho Anon, And to this Manarcus he gan to gon; There his hed he Clef down Ryht Evene to the Scholdres, I the plyht, That ded he fyl down there Anon, That Alle his Meyne It Syen Echon. And Alle that Evere Cam in his weye, Of hem spared he non tho Certeinlye, But Other to the deth he wownded was, Othere Elles dismembred In that plas; For nethir hors ne man ne scaped him non, That Alle to therthe they wenten Anon. And whanne Manarcus men this beheld,‚Äî That here Cheventein was slayn In the feld, And Of here felawes ded Also,‚Äî Ful Mochel Morneng thanne Maden they tho, And Setten vp tho An huge Cry That Into Eualache Ost was herd Clerly, There As he fawght with Tholome. Ful wel Al this Cry tho herde he; But ?it ne knew tho not Seraph√´ Whom he hadde slayn, ne what was he. And whanne so Mochel sorwe they gan to Make, Thanne gan his herte tho forto Awake, And forth he prekede Into that pres, And with him his knyhtes, &amp; wolde not ses; And there here grownd he made hem forsake, And Manye Of hem Slowgh, and dyde moche wrake. And whanne Manarcus bataille say That but twelve Of hem weren parfay, For ful sore thanne Aschamed they were That they Of so fewe scholden han fere, And Anon vppon him Retorned A?en, That bothe doel and gret pete it was to sen; And ful vegorously On him they sette, So that with stronge Strokes they Mette That his hors vndir him was Slayn, And therto vij Of his knyhtes In Certayn. Thanne weren there left but fowre &amp; he, Whiche was gret doel thanne forto se. Now Is seraphe In the place On foote Alone, But foure of his knyhtes, him self √æ? fy[ft] he persone. And manye Merveilles there wrowht Seraph√´, As here-Aftyr Me heren tellen schole ?e: He slowgh down Ryht bothe hors &amp; Men, Helmes and hawberkis to-kraked he then; Bothe knyhtes and bacheleris vppon A rowe, In that Feld he gan hem down throwe; Bothe palettes &amp; scheldes he to-Craked Asondir, That Among So moche Multitude it was gret wondir That he And his fowre knyhtes dyden there, So that grete hepes Of dede Men there were, Of dede hors and wepene that there lay, So Mochel Moordre Of peple was that day. And whanne his Fowre knyhtes this beheld, That he was so Manful In the feld, On they leyden, &amp; Fowhten ful faste, Til alle foure weren slayn Atte laste; Thanne was there non Other boote But that Nedys Seraphe besteren him Mote; And whanne that his felawes he sawgh ded, Thanne Cowde he non Other Red, But vppon bothen his feet stood ther, And beheld the hepes that Abowten him were; Ek Also he loked ?it ferthere Abowte, And Al Abowtes him was A ful gret Rowte. Anon his Ax the[n] took he On honde, Ryht forth Into the pres tho gan he fonde, And to A knyht there gan he to glyde That Many speris hadde Cast In that tyde, But ?it Manie mo hadde he forto Caste; But Seraphe him lette tho Atte laste; Seraphe Anon there Mette him with his Ax, But Neuere, Aftir that, ful litel he wax, For the Ryht Arm he smot Of Clene Thorwgh hawberk and haberiown, √æer was it sene, That down to the brest the strok tho wente, And the Arm Into the Feel[de] √æere fley presente; His scheld from him Also smot he there; As thowgh that the body Asondir were, His herte Owt Of his body ther fyl, And he In the Feeld ded there-tyl. And whanne the Remnaunt behelden him tho, That sweche Merveilles he gan to do, Non Of hem ne was So hardy To Entren his place, ne Comen him Ny; And that ded mannes hors he took Anon, And lyhtly Into the sadel he gan to gon, As thowgh him hadde Eylyd non thing, Ne non point Of Al his Armeng. And whanne On hors that he was set, Thanne hadde he gret lust to Fyhten bet, And there his body putte In bawndoun, To the tothere peple ful mochel distroccioun; And forth Into the pres he wente; There Nas non that he myhte hente, That here Armes from the body he smot tho, Here hed√´s Offe, here lemes Also; Here helmes, here harberions, he barst On sondir, He[re] Scheldes, here speris, that it was wondir, So that he drof hem forth In his weye Til to the Roch they Come, As this doth seye, Where As was the streyte passage; Thanne weren there take, bothe bacheler &amp; page, And As fele As the keperes wolde have Of that Roch, and wolde hem save. And whanne tho that behinden were At the Roch [sien] here felaws slayn there, And the Remnant presoners take, Thanne Amonges hem was moche wrake. And whanne they Seyen Al this fare, That Eualach swich knyhtes hadde thare, Ful Irowsly torned they Into that pres, And for nothing ne wolden they ses Tyl that to Seraphe the Comen Agayn, And vndir him his hors has Slayn; &amp; Er that he Myht Relevyn A?en tho, Two hundred hors Ouer him gonne go, Ouer his Body there In that plase, So that Ny ded forsothe he was, So that he lay Stille In swownyng The Spas Of tweyne bowe-drawhtes schetyng; And thanne wenden they he hadde be ded, For whom they Moornede In that sted, For that he was So worthi A knyht, And there so wel hadde born him In fyht, That they ne hadde taken him presonere ?if that his lif Myht have be saved there. Alle this while lay Seraphe In Swowneng Whiles these knyhtes weren thus In talkyng; And whanne Of his Swowneng tho he Awook, Anon there Into A Sadel he Schook; His Ax Anon On honde took he, Swich merveilles werkyng √æat wondir was to se. He Mette A knyht Anon hastely there, Of whom he ne hadde but lytel fere; With his Ax he Rewardid him tho, That his left Arm Into the feld gan go. Thanne Anothir there him Mette Redily, And Seraphe to him was ful hasty, &amp; there so him hitte vppon the hed That his body he toclaf In that sted, Evene to his Sadelis Arsown, That he In the Feld fyl ded Adown. Thanne theke hors be the bridel he took, And his ferst hors tho he forsook; His Foot In the sterope Anon he sette, &amp; sprang Into √æ? sadel, &amp; not ne lette; ?it, As forbrosed As he was, He prekyd forth Into that plas. And whanne tho knyhtes behelden, Echone That beforn tymes for him Made Mone, That he was On horsbak Ageyn, Thanne Amonges hem gonnen they seyn, And Ech Of hem to Othir gan Schewe That wondirful Merveille On A rowe, For they wenden tho In Certein Owt Of that place neuere to recoueren Agein. Anon forth he gan him dresse To the grettest maister of √æat presse; And with his Ax to him he Ran; Vppon the helm he smot him than That he fyl down there In the plas, So Of that strok Astoned he was. Thanne Arwes to him gonne they schete, And Manye Speris that weren grete, So that with An Arwe they him tho smot, That Evene thorw the Scholdere it bot, That the schaft thorwgh him gan go Ful halfendel the Schaft &amp; Mo. And whanne he Felte √æat so hurt he was, Ful [vr]sably he Rod Into that plas, And him Sterede As he ferst began; But he was hurt Of Mani A man; Bothe with Arwes and with Speris They diden hym ful many gret deris, And to the Erthe there down him threwe, And his hors vndir him they Slewe. And whanne that he Sawgh he myht not Abide, Vp In that pres he Recouerid that Tyde, And Felte that he hadde non dedly wounde; Anon vp he Stirte In that Stownde, And Anothir hors he sawh where stood; There Anon vp into the Sadel he ?ood,‚Äî Wheche hors was bothe Fre and kende,‚Äî Evene streyht toward Eualache √æ? wey gan wende, That him Ofte he bemente ful sore, In his herte neuere Man leveng More, That so lefte he Neuere with-Owten les Til that he Cam Into the grettest pres, Eualaches Signe there Forto have sein; But Aftyr him they gonnen preken Certein, And him forbarred they the weye there That he Eualach Mihte not Comen Nere. And that Sien tho the Men of Seraph√´; Anon towarde him they gonne faste fle; Towardis Tholomes Ost gonne they gon, And there Merveilles they wrowhten Anon; And so hardelich they fowhten, &amp; so sure, That On bothe sides was gret discomfiture Bothe Of Tholomes Men &amp; Eualachs √æe kyng; Many weren there dede, bothe Old &amp; ?ing, But Amonges hem kyng Eualach was lost, That they ne wiste Into what Cost;‚Äî For Tholome kepte him Owt Of that rowte More thanne tweyne boweschotes with-Owte. And whanne Seraphe there-Offen herde, Into that gret pres tho forth he Ferde, And there Sawgh he where Eualach lay, And his swerd On honde drawen parfay; For his hors vndir him was there ded, Whiche was to Eualach A sorweful Red. And Sixty knyhtes hym gonne Reskewe, There A?enst .v. hundrid they fowhten Al newe, So that they kyng Eualach Rescwed Agein With here grete Escryes tho In Certein; And On horsbak sone was he Set; Thanne there Anon with his Enemyes he Met. And whanne they that him to-foren took, On him behelden, &amp; Connen to look, Thanne On Eualach they sormownted A?ene Ful Irowsleche there Alle be-dene; And Eualach his Ax there took On honde, And departed with hem √æat Abowtes him gon stonde, So that anon there he was betrapped Amonges two thowsend, As it tho happed, That so the Syht Of him his Meyne lost there, And ne kowde not weten In what place ne where. And whanne Seraphe Saw he myht him [not] finde, Al his Meyne he lefte him there behinde, There prekyng forth Into that pres That for non Of hem wolde he not Ses, For ded Rathere wolde he han be Thanne owt of that bataille forto Fle; Tyl king Eualach hadde he Fownde, He nolde neuere parten from that Grownde; For him to lesen In that Manere tho He ne wolde, And Othirwise Myht it go; But the strengthe Abowtes him was So Merveillous there In Many A plas, That him Neghen not he ne Myhte, Nethir Of him to hauen non Syhte, For the Melle &amp; the peple there was so strong, That Enduren Seraphe ne myht not long. And thus As Seraphe was Evere Abowte To han broken the scheltrom Of that Rowte, And Euere they him withstoden than, ?it Neueretheles Slowgh Seraphe Mani A man; But Eualach was vppon the tothir Syde Betrapped ful sore In that Tyde, For hvrt he was thorw his body With thre Gleyv√´s Sekerly; And him presoner hadde taken Tholome, And be the brydel forth him ladde he;‚Äî ?it what with strif, &amp; what with Othir, Euere Eualachs men fowghten A gret fothir;‚Äî So that At the laste this Tholome, With xv knyhtes Of his Meyne, So Ferden they with kyng Eualach That they tobrosed him bothe body &amp; bak, So wery that they weren forfowghte, That no more defenden hem ne Mowghte And so Eualach tho forth they ladde As that kyng Tholome hem badde, That so was he forbrosed and forbete That Of his lif he nowht ne leete. So that the blood Ran Owt At his Mowth &amp; At his Eren, that was Selcowth; For so Mochel blood he hadde there loste That In what plase he was he ne woste; His woundes tho hadden So Sore I-bled, That In that place he was Ny ded. And so from his Meyne they him drowe Ful fer thens Into A lowe, And him there ladden Into A woode That there besid√´s tho hem Stoode, And Ek his felawes him beside, That with him were taken In that Tyde; And to this woode hem ladde Euerichon There Forto Onarmen hem Alle Anon; For ?it Armed weren they Alle, That So Manye Men they dyden down falle. And whanne Eualach Sawgh √æis grete Mischef, That he was fallen Into so gret Repref, And Euere with-oute Recoueringe to be, Thanne Moche Sorwe &amp; Mone Made he. Whanne Eualach to the woode Aproche be-gan, Thanne wax he A wondir Sory Man, And Caste his Eyen vppon his Scheld, And the vigowr Of the Cros √æere he beheld, That In his Scheld there was it set; And Euere √æ? holy Signe he beheld bet, That so longe there he be-held Vppon the Rede Crois In his Scheld; So longe beheld he that Crois thanne, That In theke Crois he Sawgh √æ? forme of A Manne Vppon that same Crois Crucified to be,‚Äî Thus In that Crois him thowghte Sawgh he,‚Äî And Feet &amp; hondis him thowghte Also, That vppon A Red blood Ronne they tho. And whanne Eualach this Sawgh In his Scheld, And these Merveilles there he beheld, Thanne gan he Forto Syghen wel Sore, And ?it to wepen wel Mochel More; &amp; bothe with Mowth &amp; herte tho he thowghte, But for febilte myhte he speke nowghte, ‚ÄúO verray God that Sittest In Maieste, As it is told,‚ÄîOn God &amp; persones thre‚Äî Of whiche I bere the Signe Of his passioun! So, Goode lord, take me to savacioun, That I Moot Resceyven ?owre Creaunce, And In Stedfast beleve, with-Owten variawnce, Thin holy name Forto proclame, That thow Art most Sothfast God Of Name, And Most Mihtful god In Alle degre, And non god ne lord but Only Euere ?e! So Save me, Goode lord, In this grete schowr, From Angwich, deth, and Alle dolowr!‚Äù And whanne this woord he hadde I-seyd, Abowtes him he lokede In A breyd; And he Sawgh Comen Owt Of that forest A semly knyht there, araied with the best, And Clene Armed from Tope to the too, There thus Ryaly gan he Owt Go, And Abowte his Nekke heng A whyt scheld Whiche that was seyn Ouer Al that Feeld‚Äî In whiche Scheld was A Crois so Red, In Signe Of him that Suffrede ded; Therto his hors As whit As the Lylye Flowr, And he A worthy knyht and of gret valowr; In his Scheld a spere ful Redylich leyd, With Alle hem to Meten, As it Is Seyd. And whanne √æ? knyht his hors with his Spores he took, On hym Tholomes Meyne ganne forto look, And to Tholome kyng he Cam ful sone, And him Torned Agein there Anone; Toward the Cite Of Orkauz tho This white knyht ladde Tholome tho, And towardis tholomes Ost they wente; But Tholome knew not here Entente. And Euere Saraphes fawht strong &amp; harde A?ens Tholomes kyng his Rerewarde, So √æat Alle that Evere A?ens him fowghte Wondred that he So duren √æere Mowghte; And Atte laste Eualachs signe he gan to Ascrye With A wondirful voys &amp; Ryht An hye, That bothe Eualach &amp; Tholome it herde Into that plase how that it √æ? Ferde. And thanne Seide kyng Tholome Anon, ‚ÄúLet vs Ordeyne oure Meyne, &amp; fast hennes gon, For discryed now alle we been Thorgwh this Chasing, As I kan seen.‚Äù Thanne destreris with spores gonne they prikke, And Amongis that Chasing Redyn ful thykke, And the white knyht Rood Anon To Tholome As faste As he Cowde gon; And this white knyht Tholome be √æ? bridel ladde, That non Of his Meyne no powere ne hadde Hym A?en forto Restreyne. But Evere wende Tholome In Certeine That the Forest Al day to-Forn hym was, Tyl that to the streyt of the Roch hee Comen be Cas;‚Äî But there say no man that white knyht, Saufe Only Eualach, In his Syht.‚Äî And whanne they comen to that Streit passage There As to-Forn was don So Moche Rage, Tho that theke time the passage kepte, Ful sore For Eualach han they wepte; And whan they him In this Maner sy him gon, They leten hym thorwgh passe riht Anon. But it was wondirful In there syht, The werkyng Of this white knyht; And [whanne] this passage weren they past, In the Middis Of that Feld Anon In hast There this white knyht lefte Tholome, That but fewe Of his Meine him Miht se, And gan wel fast Alowd To Crye, ‚ÄúGoth to now, Goth to, And √æat In hye.‚Äù And whanne this Cry herde Tholome, He gan to baschen, and al his Meyne, And to him he Ran A ful gret Cowrs, &amp; that knyht Tholome gan vn-hors, And down to therthe there him Caste Bothe hors &amp; Man, Er he thens paste. Whanne that Eualach tho this beheld, How that Tholome was feld In the feld, Tho Owt his swerd he drowgh Anon, And to-ward this Tholome gonne to gon. And whanne they that the passage kepte Syen this, thanne Anon forth they lepte To king Eualach here Owne Lord, There Alle Anon Redy At On word, And after with lawnces gonnen they Chase To tholomes Men tho In that plase, And Anon with here Speris down hem Caste, Tholomes Men in √æat plase √æere Atte laste, Everichon, Sauf Only Enlevene,‚Äî Which was the moste wondir vndir √æ? hevene How that they In theke feld Come That To-fortyme Atte forest weren Al some.‚Äî And whanne they seyen thei scholde thus be take, Thanne Amonges hem there was mochel wrake; Not-withstondyng ?it A?en they fowhte Also longe As that they there Mowhte; But here defens here Angwisch Miht not Slake, For it was Goddis wille they scholden be take. And Eualach vppon this king Tholome There lay, As alle his Men Mihte Se, Wheche the white knyht hadde down throwe; Kyng Eualach him kepte tho ful lowe; And therto I-Maymed Manye Of his Men, And ?it A?ens Eualachs On hadde he ten. Thanne this Tholome heeld vpe his swerd Anon, And to kyng Eualach homage gan he don, And there he be-Cam his presonere, And therto Al his Meyne In fere. Whanne Tholome to Eualach hadde mad fiaunce, Thanne Iekonias Clepid he, with-Owten variaunce, That the blody Roche hadde In keping; And him he Comaunded Ouer Alle thinge, ‚ÄòTo taken Anon this kyng Tholome, Hym forto leden to Orkaus Cyte,‚Äô ‚ÄúAnd worschepfully that thow him kepe there As A worthi kyng In Alle Manere.‚Äù That thus thanne be Ieconyas Kyng Tholome Into this Cite I-lad he was. And king eualach Abod stille In the feld Til Alle tholomes gonne hem ?eld; And euere As he took his Meyne, He dide hem leden to Orcaus Cite. And whanne that Alle Itaken they were [T]hat Of Tholomes Men weren there, He gan to Resorte to that bataylle [T]here Seraphe fawht with-Owten Faille; And with him ?it ladde he there Mo, Alle that the passage kepte tho, Sauf Only An hundred Of his Men That Ful Fresch to Fyhten were they then. And whanne they weren past that passage, Anon the whyte knyht was to-forn here visage, And In his hond that knyht bar A banere Of Eualachs Armes, Evene Riht there. And Anon As they sien Sire Seraph√´, To that bataille thanne faste prekid he, There As Seraphe manie Merveilles wrowhte, That In-possible swiche Merueilles don Mowhte, That Euere the body Of On Manne Schold√´ don that he dide thanne. Anon this white knyht prekid Into √æat pres, And for non thing ne wolde he Ses Til that To Seraphe he gan gon, Where as he Sawh sevene knyhtes Anon That Abowtes Seraphe there stoode, And On him leyden as they weren wode; Tweyne be the brydel hym √æere heeld, Tweyne be the helm to maken him ?eeld; And tweyne A?ens the herte leide hym vppon Wit hevy Maces Of Irne As hard As ston, So that his Flesch they Alto-Rente With here Mases there presente. And whanne the white knyht √æis beheld, Ful sore he prekyde In that Feeld To On Of hem that Seraphe heeld; And him thorwgh the body he bar vndir his scheld, That ded he was Anon ryht thare; And thus sone to Ano√æer gan he fare, &amp; with his swerd smot Of his hed √æat of it fley, and he lay ded, Amyddes the Feld there it lay. And thanne to the tothere he wente In fay, And Made hem to dyen vppon his poynt, And Made here bodyes In Evele Ioynt, So that they forsoken this Seraph√´ That from here lyves gonnen they fle. And whanne these Other two √æat him held Be his helm there In the Feeld, On Of hem drowgh Owt A lite knyf, And wolde han be-Reved Seraphe his lif, Forto han smeten him AMiddes the Fase Thorwh the Oylettes of his helm In that plase. But Ouercomen so was tho Seraph√´ That Comfort with him Myhte non be, For he was Ouercomen so with his blood So it was Merveille that [he] vpe stood, For, On hors, power hadde he non to sitte, Ne Of that stede there Onys to flytte; But for febelte that he Inne was, Ouer the hors nekke he bowede In that plas, That power vp to Sitte non hadde he, So that Of his purpos Failled his Eneme. And thus gan In Swownenge seraphe to falle Amonges his Enemyes bothe gret &amp; smalle; So that they faillede, his Enemyes, tho, Of the harm that they him wolde han do. And Anon As that this kyng Eualach Sawgh Sire Seraphe In Al this wrak, To him ward ful faste he gan to Ride Forto supporten him at that Tyde; For sekir he wende that he ded hadde been, And Neuere On lyve him forto have seen. Thanne wit A sorweful herte he gan to Crye Ful Petowsly, and that Ryht hye, ‚ÄúA wrechche! to longe now have I be, That thus have lost now Sire Seraphe!‚Äù And thanne Anon there with this word Prekyd the white knyht be his Owne Acord, And Susteyned Seraphe from fallynge, That theke tyme there was In Swownenge. And whanne Of his swownenge that he Awook, Thanne ful mochel Mone to him he took, For he ne wiste where that he was, In what stede, ne In what plas; For wende he tho ful Sekerly To han ben In the hondis Of his Enemy. And Eualach bar him ful worthily tho, For Into the pres forth gan he go, And Mette there with A worthi knyht Wich that was Scomfit Anon In fyht, And kyng Eualach to the Erthe him Caste, And hym from his hors Anon he wraste, And Cawht it In his hond there Anon; Therewith toward Seraphe he gan to gon: ‚ÄúHaue now here, my dere Freend,‚Äù seide he, ‚ÄúThis litel present now Of Me, For thow bowhtest Neuere so dere A thing From begynne[n]g In-to the Endyng.‚Äù Whanne that Seraphe this gan beholde, In his herte he Ioyede ful Mani-folde, That Alle his Sorwes for?at he there Whiche that his Enemyes dyden him Ere; And vp Into the sadel he sprang Anon, As Fresch &amp; As lusty In flesch &amp; In bon, And As lusty was there forto fyhte, And therto him thowhte As of Strong Mihte, As that he was Ony tyme be-Forn; But thanne his Ax hadde he lorn. Thanne seide he, ‚ÄúCertes, And I hadde my Ax On honde, There scholde no man A?ens Me stonde.‚Äù Thanne Anon Cam forth the white knyht, And seide, ‚Äúhere is On, Al Redy dyht; And lo, Sere, by me it Is the sent From that God Lord Omnipotent.‚Äù And whanne Seraphe this felt In his hond, Thanne gan he wel Forto vndirstond That lyhgtere and more hondsom it was Thanne his Owen to-foren In that plas; There-by wyst he, whanne he Cam Owt Of swowne, That theke Ax Ferst was not his Owne. So thanne Ryden they In-to that pres, And for non Men ne wolden they ses; And Eualach On Tholomes hors Rod, So that with him was there non Abod. And whanne Al this beheld Tholomes Meyne, Amonges hem was sorwe ful gret plente, Be Encheson that Eualach ferst they sye, With Tholome In warde, hem faste bye, And now Eualach On Tholomes hors doth Ryde; Wherfore they maden sorwe that Tyde; And therto Nabure, Tholomes Steward, Kyng Eualach hadde taken In ward. ?it More, this Eualach, with-Inne A throwe, With An horn he gan to blowe, And Made his Meyne to Resemble A?en; And tho that weren left, Retornede ful Cleen. Thanne Aftir, whanne Assembled weren they Alle, His signe he hem Schewed as gan befalle, Whiche was fastenid vppon his scheld‚Äî To his Meyne he it Schewede In that Feeld. Thanne his Meyne On two batailles he sette, And with Tholomes Meyne sone they Mette; And Comanded and preide tho to Seraph√´ ‚ÄúThat whanne he hym Sawgh in √æ? Moste Mell√´, That Seraphe In the Rere-ward scholde Falle On tholomes Men, And On hem there Calle, And with his Bataille to preven his Myht, As he was bothe worthi and gentil knyht.‚Äù Thanne Gonnen they to preken here destreris As vaylaunt knyhtes, bothe worthi &amp; Ferss, And Evere the white knyht to-forn hem was With the baner On honde In that plas, And his swerd with the tothir hond I-drawe, With wheche Manye A man was Slawe. Thanne gan kyng Eualach lowde forto Crie ‚ÄúAs Armes! knyht bacheler, and belamye! For now hath kyng Tholome lost his Men Alle, Swich Aventure Is now to him befalle! For Of hem Schal Skapyn not On, For Al the Myht that they konne don.‚Äù And whanne this herden Tholomes Meyne, They Niste what to done In non degre, But hem thowhte hit scholde be trewe, For Eualach hadde Chongid his hors newe, For On Tholomes hors thanne Rod he, As Alle his Men there Myhte thanne se; Thanne the dred√´ that they hadde Was, lest Tholome to presoun hadden be ladde, Owther ellis In the Feld there Slayn; Of wheche Of these they weren no Certayn. Kyng Eualachs Men Amonges hem thraste, That Of theke pres but fewe there paste‚Äî Whiche that weren kyng Tholomes Men‚Äî O√æer taken O√æer Slayn Er they wente then; And lik As Men that Amased were, In that plase So stooden they there. And whanne Seraphe beheld this bekering, Non lengere he ne Abod For non thing, And Tholomes Men Closed Al with-Inne, So √æat from hem myhten they not twynne; So that Angwisschously Ascryed they were, And slayn, takyn, &amp; Maymed, Many weren there; For In distresse &amp; Sorewe weren they Alle tho, For here lord &amp; Governours weren Alle Ago, And they ne wiste whedir to Springe, For In theke Contre knew they non thinge; And wel Askapen Myht they not there, For On Eche Syde here Enemyes were;‚Äî So that it semeth ‚Äòthere the hed is Gon, The Membres Fayllen thanne Everichon,‚Äô‚Äî For there say neuere Man So fayr A begynneng As hadde kyng Tholome, ne so fow[l] An Endyng; For vj dowble Meyne hadde kyng Tholome Thanne kyng Eualach In Every degre. There wondirly wel dyde Sire Seraph√´, And so dide king Eualach with his Meyn√´, That Neuere Man that was Of his Age I trowe hadde neuere So Mochel Corage; And the white knyht there bar him so That Neuere Erthly man mo Merveilles myht do; For In that Feeld Scheldes he schatered, And Speris &amp; helmes Alto-Claterid, Knyhtes &amp; hors he slowh down riht, Hedis, Armes, and legges In that fyht, That non man hym there Askapen ne Myhte, So vigerows and fel he was In fyhte, That thus be his Chevalrie &amp; knyhthod He hem In-gaderede As he Rod, And browhte hem to Eualach √æ? kyng, And to-ward the passage, with-Owten lettyng. Whanne kyng Tholomes men had Aspied That thus Sore they weren Anoyed, To that streit passage gonne they drawe Where-Offen that weren ful fawe, And wenden that non Man hadde √æere be, The passage to han kept In non degre, And wenden forto A Recouered √æat passage, That Eualach, for Al his Owtrage, Ne scholde not han past be theke weye,‚Äî This was here Entent tho Sekerlye,‚Äî Where-thorgwh √æ? Cite he Schold not have, Where tholome &amp; his Meyne weren ful save; For An hundred men myht han kept √æat pas From Al the world, so strong it was; For non mo On front myhte Entren ther But ten men At Ones, As I seyde Er; For they wenden tho ful wel √æat there Eualache keperis hadde left non del; And so As men that weren wery for-fowhte, Vpe to the Roche wenten As they mowhte, For there Supposed they forto han Reste. But it fil not hem for the beste, For whanne they that kepten the pas Syen to that Roche so manye gonnen tras, Hem thowhte Mo thanne Ml there were, And At √æ? Roch but .C. that it kepte there; And whanne they sien Men kepen the pas, Thanne newe sorwe to hem Comen was; And A?enward they wolde han gon, But there-Inne Socour was there non. For tho that On hem folwed so faste, And they Atte pas schotten Atte laste, So that they slowen &amp; token Of that Rowte As Manie As weren hem Abowte; Thanne was there Mad so gret dolowr That neuere was sein swich A stowr; For so moche blood was In that plas More thanne Owher Euere seyn was; For Men, hors, and scheldis, that In √æ? blood lye, For multitude of blood no man hem sye. And there was beten On Narbus, √ûat steward was to king Tholemus, And there to Eualach him ?ald Anon, So he him wolden saven body &amp; bon; And there his swerd vp gan to ?elde To kyng Eualach In that felde. But Eualach him ne wolde not save For non thing that he Cowde Crave; But his hors dismembred he Anon, And also him he wolde han slon. And he tho knelid Anon √æere down That he myhte be taken to Raunsown; ‚ÄúNai,‚Äù quod Eualach, ‚Äúthat schal not be; Swich Mercy getist thow non Of me; For my steward haven ?e Slayn, &amp; so schal I the here In Certeyn; Therefore the Chonge it is ful hard, For I wele haven steward for steward.‚Äù And his Armure he dide Of Caste, His hed to han smeten Of atte laste. And thanne Cam forth Sire Seraph√´: ‚ÄúA, Sire! what thinken to done ?e? ?if ?oure steward ded now be, Tholome hath lost, Sire, swich thre; And his Owne brother so dere, That he loved As mochel there As ?e ?owre Steward trewly; Therefore, Sire, On √æis man haveth Mercy; Fo[r] I him Slowgh with Myn hond, Sire, I do ?ow to vndirstond; Therfore, sire, I preie to √æ?

Ful Mochel &amp; gret was the discomfiture As that tyme be-happed be Aventure; And the Nyht drowgh On ful faste, For the day It was Ny paste; Whiche was ful deseysy to Eualachs Men, But ?it Atte hardest not for then, For so Manye thei slowen And token that tyde Atte passage Of the ‚ÄòRoche Of blood‚Äô beside, That Of hem ne pasten not √æere Away Two thousend, what hurt &amp; hol that day, That Tholomes Men ne distroied Echon‚Äî So √æat tyme with Eualach the grace gan gon,‚Äî Of wheche at the begynneng were Sixty thowsend wel harneised there. And thus the Egipcian, be goddis Myht, At theke tyme weren distroyed be fyht. Thanne to Orcaus ward wente Eualach,‚Äî Alle the Egipciens to Mochel wrak,‚Äî And with him Alle his Meyne That At theke tyme hadde he, For √æere nas no Man Of Non degre That thorwgh theke bataille holpen was he; Bothe duk, knyht, and bachelere, Alle weren Encresid that weren there, ?e, And also bothe ?omen and page; For Alle here lyves hadden they Gage. And whanne Eualach Into the Cite Entred was, So Manie presoners he fond In that plas, And Of here Maistres that with hem were, That non Spas was to walken In there, Nether On hors, nethir On Foote; But Owt A?en Nedys he Moote; And aforn the Cite he let pichchen Anon Alle his pavilouns there thanne Everichon, In A fair plase that was so pleyn To-forn that Cite tho In Certein; And there al that Niht herberwed he, And with him al his Meyne. CHAPTER XV. Now let vs beleven Of kyng Eualach, And Firthere Into this Mater now let vs walk, And Of these Cristene Speke we bedene That In Sarras ben, Sixty &amp; Fyftene, Lik As vs tellith the Storye Of Eualachs wif here Sekerlye, That A wondir fair womman sche was, And ful worschepful In Every plas, And ‚ÄòSarracynte‚Äô was that qwenes Name, A worschepful lady, and Of Noble Fame. And whanne that Eualach with his Ost forth wente, So moche Mone sche Made, sche was Ny Schente, For Eualach, that was Most In hire Mynde Of al Erthly thing, and that was kynde. Therfore sche sente For Iosephe Anon, To weten how that the Cause scholde gon, In As Mochel As that Er he seide ‚ÄòThat hire lord scholde han Abreide, And √æerto thre dayes &amp; thre Nyhtes to be Vndir his Enemyes powste, And that to the Prikke of deth thorwgh Tholome He scholde ben browht,‚Äô‚Äîthus seyde he‚Äî ‚ÄòAnd ?if it scholde Ony lengere laste Th??ne thre dayes &amp; thre Nyhtes weren paste.‚Äô And this was the Cawse Certeinle That sche for Iosephe sente, I telle it the. Thanne Iosephe to-Fore hire Gan gon, And with him his sone Ryht Anon; Thanne sche him Axed there In haste, ‚ÄúWhether the Iorne with hire lord were paste; And how he spedde In the bataille,‚Äù Hire forto telle sche preyde not Faille. Thanne to Sarracinte spak Iosephe Certeinle ‚ÄúThus sente the to seine the kyng Of Cristene (be Me,) That Of Alle thing knoweth the begynneng, And demen schal Atte laste Endyng, And Of Al this world Saviour Is he Sekerly, As I telle it the. And For As Mochel as these Erthly kynges Ne welen non knowen In here werkynges, Nethir Resceyven My Creaunce, I schal hem sende ful hard chaunse; For Into bataille I wele hem do, And there here Enemyes scholen hem slo; And here londis ?even wile I In-to the hondes of strawngeris sothfastly. For I wele that they knowen Me As fore here Souereyn lord god In Al d[eg]re, Nethir Of non Othir kyng to holde, But Only Of Me, In Manye Folde; For bothe to prowde and Ek to Felowns, I schal hem sende Manie distrucciouns; Thus be my Spyrit I schal hem sende, And In this degre I wele hem schende; And therfore the Grete I wyle down take; And √æ? Feble &amp; powre, lordis wil I Make; More-Over, kynges flesch ?oven schal be To Fowles Of Raveyne, that Abowten fle Forto Finden Sum Careyne: Thus schal it ben In Certeine. And the bodyes that Of pore Men scolen be Worthily I-byried In Eche degre; For the Ryhte weyes alle they knowe, And my Comandementis they welen bowe Wit good herte And good Entenciowne, This welen they Resceyven with good devociown.‚Äù And whanne Iosephe this tale hadde told, Sarracinte gan to wepen Mani-fold, And preyde bothe Iosephe &amp; his sone, For Eualach to here god to bydden som bone, ‚ÄòThat Eualach with worschepe Myhte retornen A?en, That sche with hire Eyen it Myhte Ones Sen, And forto be turned to the Ryhtful Creaunce, That the god Of Crystene wolde senden him swich chaunse.‚Äô ‚ÄúAnd I hope thanne Tornen wold he, Aftir, A good Man for Euere to be.‚Äù Thanne Iosephes Ganne hire Answere, ‚ÄòHow there-Offen the Certeyn knew sche there;‚Äô And sche Answerid Iosephes Agein: ‚ÄúOf that Suraw?ce Am I, In Certein.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow there-offen, dame, Sure Mihtest thow be, Whanne thou beleves on ymages of ston &amp; tre; For they mowen nethir meven ne stonde, Ne hem to helpen haven thei nethir leg ne honde, And In Iesu Crist he wil not beleve,‚Äî How Myhtest thow thanne this preve‚Äî That is lord Of Alle Cristiente, As I schal here-After declaren to the.‚Äù Thanne Axede sche him Ryht Anon The pointes Of Cristendom forto Ondon.

And God for him wrowhte In that plase Mani Faire Miracles In litel spase; But I ne Cowde weten ?it what was his Name, Of him that was so good Of fame; And ?it God graunted me that faire grase, That I At his Owne beryeng wase In the same Maner As I at the tothir was Er, Riht so [I] beried him bothe Faire &amp; Cler; And from that day ?it hider-to I have belevid In God ?it Euere Mo.‚Äù And Iosephes Abod Alle hire Answere Evene to the Ende that sche seide √æere, And hire Answerid ful sone tho, ‚ÄúSey me, dame, how myhtest √æou don so, A Cristene woman √æat thow schost be, And dost not √æere-aftir In non degre, And that thow him worschepest nowht, That so dere In this world the bowht?‚Äù ‚ÄúSertes, sire,‚Äù thanne Answerid sche, ‚ÄúMy lord Is so spetows and so Angre, That Everi day I moste Awaiten Myn Owr Whanne I May worschepen my saviowr; For, And Ony thing he Mihte Aspien with me That him scholde misplese In Ony degre, Anon he wolde me Confownde, And distroyen me Into the harde grownde; But now I hope Oure lord wil to him se, In the Ryht beleve that he mot be; And I the preie, that Art Goddis Seriawnt, Him from bodily deth that he wolde grawnt, And him hom In worschepe forto bringe, And [in] his Creawne to Maken his Endenge; &amp; ?if this Ones I Mihte knowe, There nis non Creature, ne√æer hy ne lowe, In this world schold me disseise, So mochel myn herte it scholde plese; But Evere, Iosephes, I drede me sore Of √æ? wordis that ?e han seide before, That thre dayes &amp; thre Nyht His Enemy Of him scholde han Myht.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat is ful soth,‚Äù quod Iosephes thanne, ‚ÄúFor there nys non Erthly Manne That his word ne may with-seye, Ne his Comandement, In non weye.‚Äù ‚ÄúSire! ?it ?e Mown don this for me, To preien to that God In Maieste, That he wolde schewen ?ow with-Owten faille How my lord hath sped In his bataille.‚Äù So longe that lady preide Iosephes tho, That Everi point he told hire to; And how he hadde I-sped from day to day, There Al the sothe he gan here Say. CHAPTER XVI. Thus Iosephes and his Compenie, In Sarras weren they Sekerlye, Worthily I-served Of that Qweene That Sarracinte was Clepid be-dene. And As thus In talkinge they were, To Sarracinte goode tydinges told he √æere, ‚ÄòThat to Orcauz hire lord was Come, And with him A ful gret throme;‚Äô And tolde hire of the white knyht, How graciously he bar him In fyht; But No man Cowde tellen what he was, Of Alle hem that weren In that plas; And ?it the king wolde han wist ful fayn What he hadde ben In Certain, And Merveilled Sore Alle that Nyht, &amp; lay and thowhte Of that white knyht; And so dide Also Sire Seraphe, For he ne wiste where becomen was he, And seiden ‚Äòthat Glad scholden thei neuere be, Til of him they knewen som Certeinte.‚Äô And thus Al that Niht Spoken they two Of the white knyht, and Of no Mo, Wheche he lovede Ouer Alle thing, And be him gat he Conqwering; And thus leften they not Of talkyng Til bothe weren Fallen in sleping, For Wery of fyhteng Alle they Were, And Al here Compeni √æat with hem was there.

And thus these thre leften there To kepen this holy Arch In this Manere; And Alle the tothere gonnen forth to gon, Cristes Name to sanctefien Anon, And the peple to ?even baptiseng; And this was alle here labowreng. But of hem At theke time was non there But that the holigost in hem spak Every where, And Alle Maner of langage thanne dide hem have; Where-thorwh the peple that they myhten save. And with-owten Iosephe and his sone Weren lxxij that to-gederis dide wone. Thanne Iosephe to Orcauz gan to gon, And there Into the temple he Entred Anon, And In ful gret thowht there was he, But Evere his herte was vppon the Trenite. And his letherne Gyrdel tho took he anon, And to An ymage there Gan he to gon, That stood In the temple vppon the chief Awter, And him Anon Coniowred there. And the devel there Anon forth Ryht Owt of the ymage isswed In Al here siht. And whanne that Owt of the ymage he was gon, Ioseph thanne took his Girdel Anon, And Abowte his Nekke he Made it fast, And it drowgh to-Fore the king In hast; So In √æat Manere he drow it thorwgh the Cite That Al the peple there him Mihte thanne se. Thanne Axede him Nasciens Anon Riht there, ‚ÄúWhi that so sore Iustefyed he were?‚Äù Thanne Iosephe to him Sone Agein: ‚ÄúIn time Comeng thow schalt weten Certein.‚Äù Thanne Axed Iosephe of √æ? devel A-forn hem Alle √æere, ‚ÄòWhy he hadde so ferd with kyng Tholomere,‚Äô ‚ÄúAnd whi thow Madist him so to fallen A-down Atte the wyndowe of √æ? towr to his Confucioun?‚Äù Thanne spak the devel to Ioseph tho Certeinle: ‚ÄúGoddes Seriawnt, A while that √æou wost lesen Me, And I schal to the tellen Anon Ryht Of kyng Tholomer, √æat √æou clepist A knyht.‚Äù Thanne Iosephe his Girdil tho gan to vndon From the schrewes Nekke there Anon, And so wente he forth there Al Abowte. And Ioseph him Comanded Among Al that Rowte ‚ÄòThat Openly the sothe to tellen there, How it So happed Of kyng Tholomere.‚Äô Thanne Answerid that schrewe sone him Ageyn, And seide, ‚ÄúIoseph, I knowe it wel for Certeyn What Merveilles that God hath for the wrowht; For In Sarras there God wrowhte fore the, The Man that was Mayned, √æere hol forto be; Thorwh Signe of the Crois that he towched there, Anon was he Mad bothe hol &amp; Fere; Also there Cristenedest thow kyng Eualach, That Alle Oure lawe there gan he Forsak; And so I supposed thow wost han don here, To Cristendom han browht kyng Tholomere. And for I suppesid that thow wost don so, In liknesse of Man I gan to hym go, And told him there a newe tyding, ‚ÄòThat on the Morwe, Sire Eualach the kyng Wolde him don bothe hangen &amp; drawe, And him to bringe Owt of his lif dawe.‚Äô Thanne whanne thus I hadde hym told, Anon his herte gan to wexen ful cold, And he me preide him forto helpe. There thus Of My Self I gan to ?elpe, For I tolde him, ‚ÄòCerteinle I Cowde him helpe in Al degre; And Owt of √æat Castel Forto gon, I him Wolde helpe Riht Anon.‚Äô Thanne torned I Me In semblaunce of a Grifown, Owt of that towr him to helpen A-down; And vppon my bak I Made him Sitten there, Til that he Owt of that Cite were; And whanne On My bak I-set was he, I let him falle, &amp; to-breste on pecis thre.‚Äù Thanne Ioseph A?en took √æat schrewe Anon Riht, And bond him A?en In Alle Mennes Siht, And him so ladde thorwgh Al the Cite That al the peple him Mihte there Se, And seide, ‚Äú?e Caytives, now, Everichon, Here Is ?oure god that ?e beleven vppon.‚Äù Thanne Axede him Ioseph In that plas, In what Manere that he Clepid was. Thanne the schrewe Answerid him Ageyn, ‚ÄúAselabas, My name is Clepid In Certein; And, Ioseph, I telle the what is Myn Offis: Men thorwgh false tales to bringen In to vis; And thorwh my fals tydynge Thus bringe I hem to schort Endenge.‚Äù And whanne the peple herden Al this Ado, On him there wondrede Mani-on tho; To Cristeneng Alle ronnen they Riht faste, As longe as that It Myhte laste; And Iosephe was Euere Redy Anon, And there hem Baptised Everichon. Thanne Iosephe Coniowred the devel Anon, And Owt Of his bondes let him gon, That he Scholde Neuere Noyen Man ne womman That the signe Of the holy Cros hadde vppon. Thanne Anon the kyng let the banes Crye Thorwhe Al his lond ful Certeinlye, That Al his lond Cristendom Scholde take, Only For Iesus Cristes Sake; And alle tho that wolde not Cristened ben, Anon Owt his lond that [they] Scholde fleen, And neuere thedir Inne to Retornen Agein; This was this Comandement Certein. And whanne this cry was thus don, To Cristeneng wente there Mani On; But Mochel peple ?it tho there were That Owt of theke Cite fledden there; For th√© ne wolden not Chongen here lay, Mochel of that peple thens wente that day. And whanne Ioseph beheld al this, Ful mochel mone he Made I-wis. Thanne spak the devel to Ioseph tho, ‚ÄúBehold what Venyaunce I wil now do, For tho that Cristened wold not han had, Owt At the ?ates the devel hem lad, Of whom deyden sodeinly Manion [As Owt of √æe ?ates they wolde han gon;] And somme the devel hurte wondir sore, And Owt of here wittes ?it Mani More. Alle the Remnaunt that Asckapen Mihte, Ronnen to Ioseph there Anon Ryhte, There that the Miscreawntes Cristened be. And whanne this Merveille Iosephe sawh he, Thedirward faste wente he Anon‚Äî Also Faste he hyede As he myht gon.‚Äî And aboven the dede bodyes saw he √æere Sitte The devel that Owt of √æ?

And to this, ho that Comanded the, Telle me, thow devel, er thow hens fle.‚Äù Thanne the devel Answerid him Agein, ‚ÄúBe Cristes Comaundement In Certein.‚Äù ‚ÄúTho[u] lyest Falsly,‚Äù quod Ioseph tho, ‚ÄúHis Comaundement was it Nevere so.‚Äù And Ioseph to him ward faste gan gon, Him forto han taken &amp; bownden Anon; In his Girdel, as he to-foren was, Forto han bownden him In that plas. And as Ioseph loked him tho Abowte, In his herte he hadde gret dowte; An Aungel to-Form him Sawh he there With a merveillews contenaunce In √æis manere, For his vesage As brenneng Fyr it was To him there semeng, ne√æer more ne las. Ful sore abascht was he √æer-offen tho, That he ne wiste what he myhte do, And wondred what it schold signefie, Thaungel that loked so vegerowslye. And in this Mene whille of thinkenge, Thaungel with a spere he dide him stinge; In tho to the hipe, to the harde bon, This Angel him stang there Anon, And there lefte he the spere and √æ? hed Stille In his hype In that Sted: ‚ÄúLo, Iosephe, this is to Signefie For hem thou leftest Oncristened Sekerlye; Therfore this thy mark Schal be, &amp; it Contenuwe schal with the.‚Äù Thanne thaungel thens gan to gon, And Ioseph drowgh ow[t] √æ? spere schaft anon; But the hed In his hype lefte √æere stille, For that was only goddis wille; But it Greved him but litel thing, For it was only Goddis warneng; But the blood Cowde he staunchen In non wise, But every day newe it gan forto Reprise, As longe as with-Inne was the hed, Thus it bledde In Every sted. But thaungel bad him non Merveille have: ‚ÄúThat God wold han saved, wile he save,‚Äù As in tyme Comeng ?e scholen here In this same storie, and ?e welen lere. Thanne Ioseph walked forth Anon, And his Menie with him Everichon; And of his wounde hadde he non gret dolowr, But he was in gret drede of Oure saviour. Thanne here-Offen Merveilled gretly the kyng, What that this be In to Signefieng. Thanne seide Iosephe to him Anon there, ‚ÄúOf this, Merveille ?e not In non Manere; Sire, it is, I telle the now Ryht, The peple to bringe Owt of the develes Miht.‚Äù Thanne whanne √æ? peple him so herde speken √æere, Ful Ioyful they weren that Cristened were; And alle that vncristened weren to, To Cristendom faste gonne they go. Thus Ioseph wrowhte at Orcau[z] Cite; Sekerlych there baptised he gret Meyne; And his felawes there weren with hem, That they browhten owt of Ierusalem. So that Crist there so faire for him wrowhte, That alle the peple of Orcaus to Cristendom he browhte, And with-Inne thre dayes Everichon. Thus Goddis wille fulfild he Anon, So that lefte there nethir gret ne smal That to goddis lawe [ne] weren torned al. And what be the holy wordis that he √æere spak, And be the holi gost with-Owten lak, Mochel peple of the Contre tornede he, Goode Men &amp; Cristened Forto be: And alle the ymages that In the temples were, He dide brenne &amp; to-brast Every where: Al thus wrowhte Ioseph In that Contre, In the temples and to the peiple, where-so went he; And Into the Contre of Nascien, He made hem alle tho Cristene Men. And thanne A?en to sarras Ioseph gan to go, And Nasciens with him tho Cam Also; For Ioiful In herte was he thanne, For he Converted there Manie A manne, And fulfilled goddis Comandement, The wheche was holy his Entent. Thanne Ioseph of his feleschepe √æere ches ful sone, And bisschopee hem Ordred there Anone, And sente hem Abowte Into Eche Contre, Goddis lawe forto prechen ful openle. Somme of hem dwelde In Nasciens lond, And somme In Mordrayns, As I vndirstond, Whiche was a lord of gret Seignourie, And Mochel peple hadde In his baillye; So that Ioseph ches Owt thre &amp; thrytty, And Sixtene with him left pleynly. The wheche xxxiij, bischopes gan he to Make In forme lik As god him Ordre Gan take; And Also the xvj that with him were, Bisschopes he Made anon Riht there; And Al Abowtes the Contre they wente, Only to fulfillen goddis Entente. And whanne Alle the Contre was Cristened abowte, And in Euery Cite A bisschope with-Owten dowte, And deliuered hem from the develis chaunce, And hem fullich browhte Into Goddis Creawnce, Be supportacion Of these goode Men, Kyng Mordrayns And Of Sire Nascien, Thens wente thanne Iosephe Ryht Anon, And his Meyne with him gan to gon To seken where these holy Ermytes lyen, And Of here good lyvenge forto Aspien, Where-Offen they preiden Oure lord, of grace, Therto forto haven bothe lif and spase, And that here Names he Mihte knowe Er he thens paste Ony throwe. Thanne fonde he there A lytel lyveret Where-Inne that these names weren set; And the Meritez that god gan for hem do, In that litel leveret he fond Ryht tho. The Ferste liueret thus gan it sein: ‚ÄòHere lith Salustes In certein, Wheche that was Goddis trewe Seriawnt, Of whom the lif Of him Make√æ semblawnt, That xxxvi wynter hermyt hadde he be, And that neuere worldly viaunde sawh he That Euere was mad with mannis hond,‚Äô‚Äî Thus this liueret doth vs to vndirstond‚Äî ‚ÄòBut Erbes &amp; Rotes that In Erthe were; Thus lyved he xxxvi ful ?ere.‚Äô And furthermore I-wreten √æere was: ‚ÄòHere lith Ermonies In this plas;‚Äô And thus his lif gan for to telle, ‚ÄòThat xxx wynter &amp; viij Monthes snelle Sethen that ferst Ermyt becam he‚Äô‚Äî As In this liueret here mown ?e se‚Äî ‚ÄòThat Neuere Othir clothing he hadde But swich as ferst to his Ermitage he ladde, Nethir In hosinge, nethir I schon, Ne non Othir thing On him to doon. Othir viaunde hadde he non verament, But Everiday swich As God him Sente;‚Äô‚Äî And of Tasse he was born; The to√æer In bedlem, √æat I Rehersed beforn. And whanne Iosephe gan this to vndirstonde, Vpe hem took he with his honde, And bar hem Into the Cite of Sarras, Where-offen Many a man Glad √æere was. Thanne Nascien preide Ioseph tho, That with him to Orbery wolde he Go, And that On Of hem that he myhte have,‚Äî Holy hermoine thermit he gan to Crave,‚Äî Where that worthily his Body beried he, And a Ryal Chirche Mad there be; And In Sarras Cite ful Certeinly He let Reren a Chirche ful solempnely, And In eche of these Chirches two Twelfe prestes he dide there do, For the bisschope Of nethir plase there Mihte not Suffisen, so moche peple were. The Ermyt At Sarras, the Eldest they gonne Calle, And the ?ongest at Orbery, thus seiden thei Alle. Thus thanne Joseph worscheped there Bothe Citez with holy bodyes in fere, Where as they grete Myracles do Everi day dureng ?it hidirto. Thus the Contre Of Sarras &amp; Nascien Weren Clene becomen Cristene men. CHAPTER XVII. Thanne seide the kyng and Nascien tho, ‚ÄòThat with Ioseph thanne wolde they go, To seen where that they made here preiere: Thus seiden the king &amp; Nascien there. Anon thanne Ioseph with-Owten lettenge To the Arch hem browhte, &amp; made non tarienge, And schewede there to the kyng In the Arch there ful precious thing: And there the king beheld In that plas The vestements that Ioseph Sacred with was Bisschop of Cristes Owne hond; And Also the Chayere he Say there stond, Whiche Chaier he preisede wondirly faste, And there-offen he seide thanne atte last, ‚ÄòThat It was of Alle the Ryalest Sittyng than That Evere Ordeyned was for Erthly man.‚Äô Thanne Ioseph schewed hem the holy disch Anon, Where-Inne that Sank Ryal was I-don. And whanne that Nasciens loked ther vppon, Ful passeng gret Ioye hadde [he] Anon, And seide, ‚ÄòOf Alle the sihtes √æat Euere ?it he say, Liked him neuere non so moche In-to √æat day;‚Äô Ne neuere so Ioyful was he of siht, As that tyme was Nascien, I the plyht. Now hadde he holy his Entent: That he desired to sen, was √æere present. ‚ÄúNow wot I wel that fulfild it is in me, Sire, A thing that I now schal tellen the: For whanne I was A ?ong Sqwyer, An gret hert I chasede wilde wher. Whanne I hadde lost the Noyse of myn howndes, And Also Alle my men with-Inne fewe stowndes, Thanne In gret thowht there I stod; And √æere was non man that with me bod, Ne Abowhtes me non Man Saw I tho That Ony word I myhte speken vnto. And as thus I In this thowht was, To me a vois Cam In that plas, ‚ÄòSeraphe! merveille thow not so, For ?it thi thowht ne may comen the to, Tyl thow mo Merveilles schalt se with-al, And Also thing that is Clepid seint Graal.‚Äô And therfore now wot I ful well That this [is] Seint Graal Everidel; Now know I wel that my pensifnesse Is fulfilled with Alle Goodnesse.‚Äù ?it thowht More Sire Nasciens than, And that tyme wrowhte As non wis man, But there lefte he vp the plateyne Anon That vppon this glorious vessel was don; And whanne with-Inne he gan to looke, He him withdrowh, &amp; for drede he qwooke. And thanne the kyng Axede him Anon, ‚ÄúSire Nascien, what han ?e at the Arch don?‚Äù ‚ÄúSire,‚Äù quod he there Anon Ryht tho, ‚ÄúHe is a fool that don wele as I have do, To knowen the Secrees of his Saviour, Him forto Greven In ony Owr.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù quod thanne kyng Mordreins tho, ‚ÄúHaven ?e now Iesu Crist I-Greved so?‚Äù ‚ÄúBe my feyth, Sire,‚Äù quod Sire Nasciens, ‚ÄúI knowe wel I have offendid ?it Goddis presens, For that I have sein so moche be Owtraye That non Erthly Man ne Owhte to have saye.‚Äù Thanne Axede the kyng, Ioseph Anon, How that this Cawse Mihte Gon; And thanne Answerid Nasciens Agein, ‚ÄúCome thens, Ioseph, now In Certein; Beholde it Not, I preie now to the, That semblawnce that was schewed to Me, Where-thorwgh that I have now lost my sight Be the Ordenaunce of God Almyht, Whiche that I schal neuere Recoveren A?en Til the spere-hed Owt of thin hype be clen, Where-with the Aungel At Orcauz Cite With that Spere there smot the.‚Äù Thanne Ioseph tho him heeld ful stille, Al holy to fulfillen tho Goddis wille. Thanne Anon Gan kyng Mordreyns There faste Enqweren Of Sire Nasciens, ‚ÄòWhat Manere of thing that he had Seye;‚Äô Hym it to schewen he preide Openlye.

The kyng of him thanne Enqwered there ‚ÄòHow his siht was lost, And In what Manere.‚Äô And Sire Nasciens Answerid him Agein, ‚ÄúI wot Neuere, Sire, for Certein, But for that I lokede on √æat swete thing That but fewe owhten to don lyvyng, The wheche a merveille of alle Merveilles is, Sire king, I the Seye with-owten Mys.‚Äù Thanne Enqwered [he] Of Nasciens Ageyn What that Merveille scholde ben pleyn: ‚ÄúSire,‚Äù quod Nasciens, ‚Äú thow gest non other Of Me, Siker, Sire, An Also In Certeinte, For Erthly tonge Is there non On lyve That Cowde tho Merveilles wel discryve.‚Äù And whanne thus to-fore the Arch hadde √æei ben, Ioseph In gret thowht was, as they myhten sen; And thus sone A vois there gan to Crye, That Al the peple it herde Sekerlye,‚Äî With in that Arch the vois it was, That thus there Sownede In that plas,‚Äî ‚ÄúMy grete veniaunce &amp; my gret discipline, With my strengthe to ?ow it schal propine.‚Äù And thus sone as this vois was gon, An Aungel Owt Of the Arch √æere isswed Anon, And Al In whit I-Clothed was he, In A ful fayr Robe Certeinle; And In his hond he heeld that lawnce √æer Where-with that Iosep was smeten Er. That lawnce, In sihte of Kyng and qwene, The Awngel to Ioseph it bar bedene, And there put it Into the same plase There As to Fore tymes I-hurt he wase. And whanne the Awngel drow owt √æ? lawnce Agein, The hed thanne folwede In Certein; And the Awngel took A boist with Oynement Anon, And to that wownde gan he gon, And it Anoynt ful Softely With that Oynement ful tendirly; And thanne the hed on the lawnce he putte A?en, Where-from Ran down blood ful Clen; Wheche blood the Awngel In the boist putte, And there-Inne ful worthily he it schytte, And with the same blood Anoynted Iosephs wounde And Sire Nasciens Eyen, In that stownde. Thus sone as Cleer his Eyen were As Evere Ony tyme weren they Ere. Thanne Axede Nasciens to Ioseph In hye ‚ÄòWhat that lawnce Mihte Signefye.‚Äô Thanne Ioseph him Answerid Ageyn: ‚ÄúIt signefieth, Nasciens, In Certein, Of the grete merveilles that scholen befalle Openly to ?owre Syht√´s Alle; For sweche merveilles as ?e scholen sen, And sweche Merveilles as to ?ow schol schewed ben, To Cristes verray knyhtes discouered schal be; Whanne that tyme Cometh, this scholen ?e se; For Erthly knyhtes, hevenly scholen been, That with ?owre Eyen this scholen ?e seen; Of wheche schal Neuere Man tellen √æ?

Sire,‚Äù quod Ioseph thanne Anon, ‚Äú√æat wele I declaren Er I hens gon; For that I wolde with Al my myht In stedfast beleve to bringen the ryht. Thike Child that In the Chambre was, And to-forn the Isswede In that plas With-Owten Ony wal o√æer dore brekynge, Thus it is to thin &amp; to oure Alther vndirstondinge; It signefieth only Goddis Sone, That In the Maydeins wombe dide wone, Where as he In alihte, &amp; Owt he cam Be his Owne Miht as God &amp; Man; And lik as he owt of √æat Chambre isswed to fore √æ?, So dide he owt of the virgenite, And neuere hire Maidenhot was put Away, Nether to-forn ne After, As I the say.‚Äù ‚ÄúThanne telle me, Ioseph,‚Äù quod the kyng tho, ‚ÄúWhat was that child that Into √æ? Chambre entred so!‚Äù ‚ÄúSire kyng, that Child was the holigost, On God of Mihtes Most, That Into that chambre Entred thanne, In the savacioun of Alle kynde of Manne. ‚ÄúThere-fore sendeth the to Sein be Me That highe lord God √æat is In Maieste, ‚ÄòThat thow schost Anon putten Away Thike fals simylitude √æat thow hast kept Mani day, And that thow do hem brennen Anon Riht Openly In Al the peplis siht; That semblawnce that so longe √æou hast had In kepinge, Thow Schalt it don brenne Ouer Alle thinge.‚Äô Where thow hast don fowl dedly Synne, In tho pointes that thow hast Trespaced Inne, The holigost wele √æat it be declared Openly, Thi Falsnesse And thin fowle foly, That Alle the world it Mowen knowe, Of thi meyne, bothe hyghe and lowe.‚Äù This Semblaunce that I have spoken of here, Lesteneth to Me, and ?e Mown lere; What maner of semblaunce that worschepe he, ?e scholen Mown bothe heren and se. He hadde don him Mad A fair ymage In forme Of a woman of high parage,‚Äî And A fairere ymage ne Mihte non ben Of tre ne ston I-Man, As men Mihten sen,‚Äî And with hire the king lay Euery o√æer nyht; And thereto In Ryal Robes sche was diht, And In al so Riche &amp; worthi Aray As ony man Cowde devyne o√æer say; And a chambre for hire he let Ordeyne, The most Merveillous that men herd of seyne, That non Man Cowde knowen the openinge, Nethir thentre ne Owt-Goyng. Thanne Anon Clepid he forth Sire Nascien And his qwene, to-Foren him to Comen then, And seide ‚Äòthat he wolde hem Alle Schewe His fals leveng, with-Inne A threwe, That so longe he hadde kept And lad.‚Äô Anon his Meyne he Comanded, &amp; bad, ‚ÄòA gret Feer Forto Maken Anon In his paleys, Amongis hem Echon;‚Äô And whanne √æat feer was brennenge briht, Anon he Comaunded hem Owt of his Siht And Owt of the Paleys Forto gon, Alle his Meyne Everichon, So that In his Compenye ne left not there But Ioseph, &amp; Nasciens, &amp; his qweene in fere. Thanne the kyng ladde hem forth Anon To a sotyl hows was mad of Marbre ston, And Alle of divers Colowres it was, Ful seteli I-wrowht In that plas, And the Schettynge was Mad so previly That non Man Miht it knowen Apertly, With a sotil barre with Inne I-wrowht, That non man thentre ne knewe nowht. And whanne the kyng it Opene scholde, A sotyl Ernen keye In his hond gan holde, The wheche the Iointours he gan vnschitte, So wel of that For-knew he itte. And thus thei Entreden Everichon There that ymage was Riht Anon, Where that disloyalte &amp; synne he hadde I-do With that ymage √æat In the hows was so. And that ymage Took he there Anon Ryht, And Into that Fyr he let it to ben dyht, And alle the Riche Robes Also That vppon thike ymage weren I-do, Evene thus dide he In alle mennes Siht Thike Ymage to don brennen ful briht. ‚ÄúO,‚Äù quod the kyng, ‚Äúgoode lord God, moche is √æ? Miht, That me Sendest grace nowe In thi Siht My fals levenge forto Forsake, And Only to thi servise me take!‚Äù And there alle his Synne he forsook, And Onlyche to goddis servise him took. Thanne merveilled Alle that Meyne What theke semblawnce myht be, For there-offen herden they Neuere speken be-fore Of non Man that Evere ?it was I-bore. Alle this was thorwgh Iosephes techinge, Him self and Al his Rem In good lif to bringe, Thorwgh the Comandement of Oure lord; Thus was the semblaunce brend at on word. And whanne Ioseph hadde Alle this I-do, And thike ymage dide brenne √æere Also, And al the lond browht In good beleve, From Sarras ward he gan to meve, And took his leve at kyng and knyht, At Nasciens, and Of that qweene so briht. Thanne the kyng, the qwene, &amp; Sire Nascien, Cowndied Ioseph A gret weye then, And Alle that weren In his Compenye Forth with Ioseph thei gonnen hem Gye, Wheche that A gret Meine it was, That to Iosephe Seiden In thike plas, ‚ÄòThat ?if Ioseph wolde In here Compenie go, From him departen wolde they neuere mo.‚Äô And Ioseph Resceived hem Everichon That In his Compenye gonnen to gon, So As be nombre it was I-Rekened to me Two hundred &amp; Sevene of theke Meyne. And so of the kyng his leve there he took, And Alle the Compenie that he not forsook, &amp; Charged √æe kyng, ‚Äòholi chirche to sosteyne, And Neuere to his fals levenge to tornen Ageyne; More-Ouer, to kepen Cristes lawes, My techeng, And √æerto Alle my sawes.‚Äô Thus departed the kyng and they tho With wepinges, syghenges, &amp; Manion mo; For hem thowghte forloren they were, Whanne Iosephe departed from hem there, As ?e scholen heren here Aftirward, What happes &amp; Chaunses befillen hem hard. And whanne that Ioseph forth wente, Into what Contre he ne wiste veramente, But As be Goddis Comandement He it Fulfillede tho verayment. CHAPTER XVIII. Now goth forth Ioseph &amp; his Compenye Be Goddis Comandement Certeinlye, But Alle here Iornes devisen I ne kan,‚Äî It were to moche for Ony On Man‚Äî Nethir here herebegage, ne here vyaunde; But nothing hem lakked, I vndirstonde. Now from Ioseph A while let vs twynne And of kyng Mordreins we Moste be-gynne, And of the Compenie that Is in Sarras Cite, That Ioseph there lefte of his Meyne. Thus begynneth this storie forto telle What Aventure king Mordreins Aftir befelle. In bedde as he lay vppon A Nyht, In his slepe was there wondirly afryht; And there A gret dreme Cam him vppon, As after scholen ?e heren Everichon. In this wonderful dreme riht longe he lay, Til that it was ny liht of the day, And with his Eyen So sore he wepte, And Evere he lay &amp; faste Slepte, In Sighenges and In Storbelings sore, Al Evere thus he ferde More &amp; More; So that √æ? qwene, that by him lay, To hire herte it was a ful gret fray; But Sche myhte not Enqweren for non thing Of him what Amownted this Metyng, For sche dorste not A?ens his wille Hym there-Offen freyne, for good ne ylle; For he was bothe feers &amp; Crwel, Therfore sche ne dorste him A?en neuere a del. Thus Abod the kyng In this trowble Owt riht Til it was passed middes of the nyht; And thanne In a softe Sleepe fil he, For werinesse of travaille he hadde Inne be; And thus In dremeng thowhte he, ‚ÄòThat he was In Sarras, √æat faire Cite, And there In his Cowrt that was so Riche And so worthi, that non was liche. To that Cowrt him thowghte comen there Manye lordis &amp; ladyes Of gret powere, That weren Arayed &amp; Rialy dyht,‚Äî So Ryal Saw he Neuere In his siht; And to Mete Seten they Alle, As to kyng, lordes, &amp; ladyes, don befalle. Him thowhte At his mete √æere that he sat; His mowht he opened, A morsel puttyng In √æere-at; Him thowghte A thondir blast gan gon, That Morsel owt of his hand it smot Anon; An the Crowne that was vppon his hed, To the Erthe it Caste In that sted; And whanne he stowpede the Crowne to take, A boistous wynd there gan to wake; Hym thowghte he was born Into A straunge place A fer wey thennes, &amp; √æere was a long space. And ?it him thowhte there wel More, That A liown &amp; A lioness to him Comen thore; Everi day the lyown mete to him browghte, And the lionesse Awey it Cawhte, Sauf scarsly half his lyvenge That the liown dide him bringe. And Atte laste him thowghte Agein, That non lengere he wolde it soffren in sertein; And with his fist smot so the lyonesse That sche dide him no More distresse. ‚ÄòThanne him thowghte his Crowne he fond; And vp he took it √æere In his hond, And set it A?en vppon his hed; Thus thowghte him there In that sted. But it was Chonged thanne wondirly, The stones of that Crowne Certeinly; For the stones weren so preciowse to his eye, That neuere non So precious stones he sye. ‚ÄòAnd whanne on his hed it was set A?ein, Thanne Cam his Nevew, Nasciens sone, Certein; Him thowhte that An Egle him there bar Ryht Fer with-Inne the Se thar; Ful fer Into a stravnge contre His Nevew him thowghte √æere bar he; And there the Egle lefte him a-down Ryht fer Into a strawnge Regiown. And whanne he was there set In √æat plase, The peple that In the Contre wase, To him alle they knelid a down In that plase Abowtes In-virown; And whanne thus alle they hadden don, To him so Enclyned Everichon, And gret Ioie of him they made, And of him weren they wondir glade. ‚ÄòThanne thowghte him that veraillye That he Sawgh with his bodilich Eye A gret Flood Owt of his body Gon; Of wheche flood becomen there Nyne Anon, Where-Offen the viij Reveres were Of on clernesse, of on depthe &amp; bred, him √æowghte √æere; But the laste flood that there was, Most deppest, Most Trowblest, semed In that plas; The water was as fowl As Ony chanel, Riht hydows Therto, &amp; ful stordy Ech del; Thus Evene ferd it Atte the begynneng: But in the Middis was thanne Anothir thing, For the water Also Cler was there As ony preciouse stones Owghere, Not-with-stonding it was boystows &amp; scharpe As here to-Foren ?e herden Me Carpe; And ?it In the Ende was it in A-nothir Manere,‚Äî ?if ?e welen lestene ?e scholen here;‚Äî For it was More Cleer An hundred fold Thanne here to-fore ?e han herd me told, And More Fairere thanne In the Middes it was, And as swete to drinken In ony plas; And so delicious it was to drinke, That More delicious Cowde non Man thenke; In wheche Ende the Cowrs was so softe, √æat there-offen was non Noise on lofte. ?it more him thowghte √æat he Sawgh tho A Fair Man that From the hevene gan go; And as he lokede, him thowghte, An hy In his hondis he Sawgh the verray Crucyfi; And to a lake he Gan to Gon; His hondes &amp; Feet he weesch there-Inne Anon; And thre of the floodis wheche √æat were Departid from the Nynthe there; Into Alle thre he Entrede, wete √æou wel, Hondes, feet, and body he weesch Eche del.‚Äô This Avicioun &amp; this dremenge Sawgh the kyng In his Slepinge, Wheche that lasted Ny to the day, Lik As this Storye vs now doth say. Thanne A-wook this kyng Anon, And Remembred him of these viciouns Echon, Where-offen Abasched ful sore he was, Of that wonderful A[nd] merveillous Cas. And the qweene that beheeld his fare, In hire herte hadde sche ful gret Care, How sche Myhte Owght knowen of the lif Why that hire lord was so thanne pensyf. Anon As sche myhte parceyven the day, Vpe sche Ros, And to hire brother took the way, Sore wepinge &amp; sore Syghenge, With gret sorwe &amp; lawmentinge, And so Cam to Nasciens hire brotheris bed, And down be him sat In thike sted. Anon Ryht vpe this Nasciens Rawghte, His Soster there In his armes he Cawghte, And hire A-Freyned with Al his herte, ‚ÄòWhy that sche hadde So manye peynes smerte.‚Äô Thanne tolde sche him of hire lord the kyng That Al Niht hadde ben In sweche Morneng, And the Cause for why sche ne wiste, ‚ÄúTherfore, dere brothir, as I the tryste, Lest he myhte falle In som dispeireng, Now, swete dere brothir, for Ony thing That ?e wolden of him Enqwere For what Cawse he hadde Al his fere, And for Iesus love hevene kyng, For whom we hauen taken Cristeneng, That ?e wolden streyht to him gon, And a boone Axen Of hym √æere Anon, ‚ÄòThat he wolde graunten ?ow ?owre Askyng, What so Evere it be, of Alle thing,‚Äô And whanne √æat he hath graunted to ?ow √æat boone, Thanne that ?e wolden Axen him ful sone ‚ÄòWhy that he Ferde So that Nyht, &amp; why In his sleepe he was so afryht;‚Äô For I ne desire so sore non thing As there Offen to haven som knoweng.‚Äù Thanne Ros him vpe this Nasciens Anon, And to the kynges chambre gan to gon; And be that tyme he comen thedir was, The kyng was Resen in that plas; And Nasciens him grette √æere Anon riht, And seide, ‚ÄúSire! as thow art bothe kyng &amp; knyht, One bone, sire kyng, √æat thow grawnte me With-Owten lettynge Owthir Adversite.‚Äù Thanne √æ? king Answerid him Agein, ‚ÄúDere brothe[r], ?e knowen wel In Certein, That nothing wheche Is In Myn bandown That Al Redy schal been at ?owre peticiown.‚Äù And whanne Naciens vndirstood al this, That be his Creawnse he wolde not Mis, But fulfillen his bone Al hol &amp; pleyn, Thanne to him thus seide he In Certein, ‚ÄòNo more for his boone wolde he Crave, But knowliching of his pensifnesse to have; Why Al that Nyht he ferde tho so, This wolde I wete Er that I go.‚Äô And whanne the kyng herde him thus seye, Thanne wiste he wel his qweene gan him be-wreye, So that Anon Ryht to Sire Nasciens He tolde his trowblynge with-owten Offens, And told him clene his Aviciowun, And of his Nevew Al &amp; som; ‚ÄúBut ?it neuertheles not for than I ne have not ?ow told how it began; For of this ?ifte that ?e han Axed me, Riht ful vntrewe to ?ow have I be; For I swor to ?ow with-Inne √æ? viij day, Whanne ?e token for me that iornay, I scholde ?ow so worthily qwiten Ageyn Thal al ?oure baronage scholde it knowen Certein. Where-offen vntrewe to ?ow I am, And thus this pensifnesse On me it Cam. Fortheremore, As by my qweene I lay, I bethowghte me how Mani A day That I hadde leyn In fowl sinne, The fowlest √æat Man Myhte leven Inne; And myn Consciense me gan to Repreve Of myn fals levenge &amp; Of myn beleve. And as I lay thus, &amp; me be-thowghte ?if to Ony Man I hadde behyght Owghte; And I ne Cowde not thenken, sauf Only to √æ?, To whom that I haue so longe vntrewe be; And for wheche thing is most myn hevynesse That bringeth myn herte In al this distresse. For there nis now no man lyvenge That I am so moche bownden to In Alle thinge, Ne that so moche that I haue trespaced vnto, As to ?owre persone now that I have I-do. And what this vntrowthe it is to mene, I schal ?ow tellen ful wel &amp; Clene. It is ful trewe, As ?e don vndirstonde, Whanne I was discomfyt be myn Enemyes honde At Tarabel, As ?e wel knowe, Where as ?e Comen with-Inne A throwe A?ens Myn Enemyes to socowren there, Of whom √æat I hadde Riht gret Fere, Whanne to the Castel of Come √æat I was gon,‚Äî That tyme O√æer Socour hadde I non;‚Äî Thanne Comen ?e prekynge with ?owre Meyne In Socowringe, fortheringe, &amp; helpinge of me; Thanne behyghte I ?ow tho In Certein, ‚ÄòThat ?if euere to Sarras I Myhte Rekeueren Agein In worschepe &amp; In prosperite; With-Innen .viij. dayes aftir Certeinle, I scholde ?ow so worthily Gwerdone thanne, That bettere gwerdoned nas neuere Manne;‚Äô Where-offen the schame is Fallen On Me Only, Sire, &amp; not vppon the. And for Cawse of this grete thowght, Into this Avicioun thus was I browght, As I have told ?ow, bothe Crope &amp; Roote; But the signefiawnce, how to knowen, I ne woote; Now sethen that Ioseph is hennes gon, Man me to declaren now know I non; For, And he were here now present, He cowde me declaren Al the hole Entent;‚Äù And for this Cause was he in gret thowht, To what Ende this viciown scholde be browht. And thanne be-spak tho Sire Nasciens, That thike tyme was In the kynges presens, ‚ÄúFor, sire, this viciown May Signefie That ?e scholen In-to Anothir Seignorie; But ?e neten whanne, ne what day, That this sodeynly behappen ?ow May. For, lik As ?e han chonged ?oure lif, So scholen ?e ?owre Regne with-owten strif; For Every Evel wil &amp; wikked Cownsaille, Eche man Owghte Forsaken Sawn faille, And Ellis diden we Contrariously To Owre newe feith ful Sekerly, Into hos Creaunse we han vs bownde Bothe body and Sowle In this stownde. Where-fore, As of ?oure Aviciown, now semeth me, To non Evel may it torne In non degre. But I rede ?ow that ?e now do, Counseil Of holy Chirche to Clepen ?ow to, Wheche that Ioseph left In his stede, Good Counseil there-Offen ?ow now to hede. For ?e knowen wel be vndirstondyng, That Ioseph Comanded ?ow Ouer Alle thing ‚ÄòHoly Chirche to kepen an Susteyne, And In Every nede to hem scholde ?e Compleyne, That Nedy were to sowle o√æer to body;‚Äô Thus Comanded he ?ow, ?e weten wel sothly.‚Äù And whanne Nasciens this wordis had seid √æ?, Anon bothe to-Gederis thanne gonnen they go To the paleys Anon Of Spiritwelte‚Äî As to-forn Rehersid han ?e herd Me‚Äî That Enstablyscht &amp; Ordeyned weren Echone, Holy Goddis Servise there-Inne to done; So that there herden they goddis Servise, And Afterward that Glorious Sacrifise, As Ioseph hem Comaunded before, In what maner to Swen Cristes lore, And Every day for the More part Comowned to be; Thus Comanded Ioseph tho Certeynle. And whanne this Servise was Al I-don, To-forn him he Comanded to Comen Anon Alle the provostis of holy Chirche, And of hem took Counseil how he scholde wirche, And told hem Clerly Al his Avicioun, How that he dremede, Al and som. But Of hem was there not On tho That theke Avisiown Cowde him vndo; For they Seyden him Certeinly, ‚ÄòThat there ne Cowde non Man but God Only That Avicioon to declaren In Ony place, Sawfe Only God thorgh his grete grace.‚Äô And whanne the kyng &amp; Nasciens herden of this, Anon thens they wenten with Owten Mys. Thanne wente the kyng &amp; Nasciens forth bothe More hevyere thanne Er they weren forsothe, And [seide] that neuere In Ese they scholde bene Tyl here-Offen they hadden vndirstonding clene; And thus pensif to the paleys A?en gonne they gone, They two togederis, right Alle alone; And there they Rested hem bothe that stownde To-Gederis On A Cowche vppon the grownde, And non More Feleschepe but they two. Thanne felten they Anon Merveilles Mo, How that Al the paleys Clene Alto-schook, Sawfe √æ? Sovereyn vowtis, As they Gonne look; And thanne loked they furthermore; Hem thowghte Al to-scheverid it was thore. And In Every Chene hem thowghte they sye Ful of brenneng brondis ful wittirlye. Thanne so hydows A noise there be-gan, As it was semeng to hem bothe than That the Endeng of √æ? world hadde be come, And that it hadde ben the day of dome; So that Alle the wyndowes &amp; walles to-brook, So Merveillously tho this Noise Ontook. Also hem thowghte the paleis schold han down falle, And there Sonken Into the Ottrest walle. And Amongs Alle this Merveillous thing, There Cam On hem the wondrest dirkeneng, That hem thowghte here sighte was gon Certein, And that it neuere to Recouerin Ageyn. And non Men Of that Cite Certeinly Theke Merveilles sien, ne√æer herden, but they That with-Inne the paleis were; And herden they, ne sien, no more there But Onliche Of that gret thondringe, Where-Offen they hadden gret Merveillenge. And Othir thinges syen they nowht; But, As hem semede In here thowht, A fewe sparkelis At the Openynge Of the Paleys wyndowes, they Syen Comenge; And ?it they Abaschten ful sore of this, What it Myhte Amow[n]ten, with-Owten Mis. And As the kyng &amp; Nasciens lien In this trawunce ?it herden they A more wondirful Chawnce. Hem thowghte they herde the Sown of An horn That neuere they herden there beforn; And the sown was so wondirful &amp; so hy, That ouer al the world they supposed trewly The Noise Of that horn myht hauen ben herde, So wondirfully that noise tho √æere Ferde. Thanne Anon A vois there Gan to Crie, ‚ÄúHere is begynneng of drede Certeinlye.‚Äù And whanne this Nois they herde thus seyn, Evene plat A down they fillen ful pleyn, Lik bothe dede As they hadde √æere been; Non lif In hem non Mihte Seen. Thanne was the prophecie fulfild tho That be Olde dayes was knowen to Mo, Wheche √æat seith, ‚ÄòTwo scholen liggen In a bed, On be taken, √æ? to√æer leven stille In that sted.‚Äô Thus sone the kyng Owt of his bed was bore Seventene Iornes, be Goddis Myht thore. And it was wel the thridde Oure of the day Whanne to the kyng was Al this Affray; And whanne the holy gost hym left ful sone, It was the hy Owre Of None. But of him talketh now non lengere this storie; But to the qweene &amp; Nascien Mosten we hye, That bothe weren beleft In sarras, As woful peple In that same plas. CHAPTER XIX. Lo thus tellith this Story now here, How Nasciens And the kyng, In A bed they were, And how that the kyng was born Away, And stille In Swowneng this Nasciens lay; And swich A Moreyne As In that paleis was, Was Neuere Sein In non plas; And In the Cite Was herd no More But the thondir &amp; √æ? sown of the trompe thore. Thanne it happed In this Mene tyme‚Äî The tyde Of √æ? day Was Owr Of pryme‚Äî That the qwene gan forto gon, A faire Chirche Werk to beholden Anon, That In Worschepe Of Oure lady begonnen was there; And that chirche to sen wente sche In this Manere. And whanne thorwgh that paleys sche gan to goon, A wondirful Syhte Sawgh sche √æere Anon,‚Äî Alle the Seriawntes lyen there plat adown Ful dedlich &amp; pale Al In virown; And sche wende On Slepe √æat alle hadde ben tho, So that Furthermore sche gan to Go; Thanne Fonde sche Alle the knyhtes &amp; Sqwiere, In that Same Manere they lyen tho there. Thanne Merveilled the qwene mochel of this, What it scholde Amownten with-Owten Mis; Anon Somme of hem sche gan to Calle, But thei mihten ne√æer heren ne sen, so gan it fal, For nethir hadden √æei wit ne Memorye Of non worldly thing thanne Certeynlye. And whanne sche say, that not sche Myhte Of hem nethir haven word ne syhte, Thanne with A gret Cowrs torned sche Anon, And to the kynges Chambre gan to gon. And whanne sche was Inne Atte Chambre dore, There, Merveylles Gan sche beholden More; Sche beheld hire brother sire Nascien Sat In his bed wepinge than, Owt of wheche bed Mordreins the kyng Was vpe lefte with Owten lesing; And √æere Nasciens Made gret sorwe &amp; Mone, As him thowhte nedis he most done For the Noise and √æ? voys that he herde, That he ne wiste In what maner it Ferde. And whanne the qweene √æis began beholde, Anon hire herte gan wexen Colde; And sore tremeling &amp; qwakyng than, To sire Nasciens bed Anon sche Ran, And wend that som wikked Sperit be chawnse Hadd hem put Owt Of here Ryhtful Creaunce; And to hire brother sche Ran In haste, And him Embracen sche gan ful faste, &amp; the Cawse of him Axede, why it was That he So wepe there In that plas. Thanne gan he wepe wondirly Sore, Fastere and hardere than he dide before. Thanne √æ? qweene gan lowde to Crye With a lowd vois ful petowslye, And Swowneng to the Erthe fyl sche there. Thanne sire Nasciens Gan hire to Chere, And brased hire In his Armes two, And hire there kyste &amp; Cherede tho. ‚ÄúA, swete soster!‚Äù he gan to Say, ‚ÄúWhat may ?ow be to Maken this fray?‚Äù And whanne sche Aros Of hire Swowneng; Thanne Axede sche of √æat Merveilleng; With Sorewful herte &amp; hevy Chere Sche gan Axen where hire lord were. And whanne Nasciens this vndirstood, Ful Clene thanne Nasciens Chonged his mood, That he ne Mihte non word tho speke, So him thowhte his herte wolde breke; As faste the water Ran from his Eeyen Adown, As it hadde ben pored vppon his Crown. Whanne the qweene Say him so taken vppon, Sche Axede what he hadde with hire lord doon; Thanne gan sche forto Swownen ageyn In that place there Certein Certein, And wende Owt of hire wit sche scholde han gon, Swich Sorwe sche Made, &amp; so gret Mon. Whanne Of hire Swowneng sche A-wook, Sche qwaked, sche trembled, sche wepe, sche schook, And with a deolful vois sche gan to Crye, ‚ÄúSwete Brother Nasciens!‚Äù Certeinlye Evene thus As A wood womman In this Gyse took sche vppon, And euere Aftir hire lord gan to Crie With deolful vois, &amp; wonderli hye. And whanne Nasciens hire tolde Al the verite, Thanne weping &amp; morneng myhten men √æere se, And how the kyng from him was taken there, And forth born, &amp; In what Manere: But Into what place √æat he was I-bore, Nasciens ne Cowde not tellen there. Whanne Nasciens this word hadde I-seyd, Thanne was there manie A deolful breid, And Owthes &amp; Cry was In that halle, That bothe Men &amp; wommen In swowneng gonne falle. And swich Sorwe √æ? qweene there Made, That Erthly thing myhte hire non Glade. Thanne Cam Nasciens to hire Agein, And In his Armes he hire embraced ful pleyn, And hire Comforted In this degre, ‚ÄúNow, goode dere Soster, lesteneth to Me; The kyng he is bothe Sawf &amp; Sownde As we ben here In this Stownde, And bothen heyl In Sowle and In body, I Sey ?ow, Sostir, now, Certeynly. This knowe I wel be that tydynge That the voys to vs gan bringe.‚Äù Thanne Axede Sche Nasciens with-Owten lak, ‚ÄòHo it myhte be that to him tho spak.‚Äô Thanne Nasciens hire Answerid Ageyn, And seide it was Cristes Messenger Certein So gret Sorwe &amp; Mone Made √æ? qweene, That for non Erthly man Seced myhte bene. Thus sone this tydinge Gan forto springe Ouer Al the Contre with-Owten lettynge, How that the kyng thus was I-lore, And how sodeynly he was A-Wey I-bore. Thanne the baronage to-gederis Comen Anon, And of this Conseilleden what they myht don, And how the kyng Awey thus Scholde fare; Where-Offen they hadde ful gret Care So Amonges Alle Othere there was On That longe with the kyng hadde Igon,‚Äî A malicious knyht In Alle Manere, His name Was clepid Sire Calaphere‚Äî For he was so Crwel, &amp; so Felowns, So fals, so Cvrsid, so wikked of Condiciouns, That in dedly herte ne Myhte Synke So moche Tretorye forto thenke, As that Cursed Calaphere In his herte Imagyned there: For there he seide ful Openlye tho, ‚ÄòThat be treson Nasciens the king dide slo, For he wolde hauen √æ? Rem In gouerninge,‚Äô‚Äî This was Openly his talkynge‚Äî ‚ÄòFor In that place weren there no Mo Sauf Only the kyng &amp; sire Nasciens tho; How myht it thanne Otherwise be, But that Sire Nasciens dide him sle?‚Äô Thanne Answerid the baronage A?en, ‚ÄòThat it is ful lyk thus forto ben.‚Äô Thanne tooken they here Conseyl Anon, That Into Strong warde he scholde be don, Til that they knewen In word &amp; dede tho Whethir the kyng lyvede, o√æer how it myhte go. And to this Conseil thanne Everychon Sworen alle to holden there Anon; And thus Of Nasciens demed they there, That √æ? kyng hadde Mordred, but √æei niste where. And thus to Cowrt they Comen Anon, Alle these barowns Everichon, And fownden Sire Nasciens &amp; the qweene Makenge gret sorwe Al bedene, That Neuere Man that was lyvenge Herde neuere half so moche weymentinge; And this was the thridde day Aftyr the kyng was Ravischt Away. Thanne thus to √æ? qweene gonnen they gone, And of this Aventure Enqwerid Anone. Thanne Anon Nasciens gan forto telle Alle the Mater, how it tho befelle; Bothe lik as he hadde herd &amp; sein, He gan hem tellen In Certein; And Also of the kynges Swevenynge, What he Mette In his dremenge. Thus to Nasciens they weren Enqweringe, &amp; of Al thing he ?af hem Answeringe, And seide to hem ful Sekerliche tho, ‚ÄòThat In the Chambre Neren but they two Whanne this Chaunce there gan to falle;‚Äô And thus he tolde Amongs hem Alle. Thanne Anon there they him tooke, And Grevously On him gonnen to loke. And sire Nasciens hem Axede tho, ‚ÄòWhy with him they Ferden so.‚Äô Thanne they Answerede, &amp; forth him ladde, ‚ÄòThat suspecion to him Of the kyng they hadde.‚Äô And thus In preson thanne they him Caste, &amp; Sesid Alle his londis Atte laste. Thanne senten they Abowtes here &amp; there, To don seken the kyng Every Where. Thus Nasciens In preson suffrede mani hard schowr, Be conceil of Calapher, √æat fals Tretowr.‚Äî This Calafer made good semblaunce As a man Of good Creawnce, But fals he was In dede &amp; thowght, For Cristene manne was he nowht; For whanne Cristened he schold han be, Ful faste Awey he gan to fle, For he ne hateth non Creature So moche As Cristene, I the Enswre;‚Äî So that he Cam to √æ? barouns Agein, And hem thus Conceilled In Certein, ‚ÄòThat Into the tyme that they myhten knowe Begynneng And Endeng Vppon A rowe, Nasciens In presown scholde Abyde:‚Äô Swich Conseil ?af that tretour this tyde. And thus be the Counseil Of fals Calaphere, Nasciens In presown kepten thei there, That him &amp; his londis bothe, they hadde In here Award, bothe good &amp; badde. And whanne √æ? qweene beheeld Al this, ?he thowhte In hire herte it wente Amys, That hire lord thus was Agon, And √æerto hire bro√æer In presoun don. It is non nede to tellen the Mone That √æ? qweene √æere made ful sone, For there nas non Erthly thing‚Äî Aftir hire lord that was the kyng‚Äî That so moche was In hire herte, As of hire brothir his peynes smerte. Ful fain wolde thanne this gode qwene, That hire brothir Owt Of preson hadde bene; But sche was tho A lone womman, And ful litel Reed of this sche kan; To stryven A?ens hire Baronye, Sche ne hadde non strengthe Certeinlie. And Evere was Nasciens In preson strong, And tempted he was with the devel Among Forto forsaken there his trewe Creawnse; But he ne wolde, for non Maner Of Chawnse, Forsaken his god for non peyne; But Euere to his God he gan Compleyne, And Cride Merci For his grete Synne, Of √æ? wikkednesse that he hadde lyved Inne: ‚ÄúFor moche more thanne this deservid I have; Where-fore, goode lord Iesus, thow me save! For A gret Fool trewly I was, Thy secrees to sen In that holy plas, Wich that non Man scholde han seyn there, But ?if Clene Of Synne I-clensid he were; And so, goode lord, ne was not I; Where-fore, Iesus, I crie the Mercy!‚Äù And in this holy Entenciown Stille belefte Nascien In presown, In gret Angwisch &amp; gret Anoye, Thus lyvede Nasciens, As I ?ow seye; Bothe be nyht and Ek be day In this Angwisch thus Nasciens lay; And Evere Cried God Of Mercy That he hadde leved so Folily. And now torneth this Storie Ageyn To kyng Mordreins now In Certein, The wheche lest √æat he ded hadde be; And thus is he In A Roch with-Inne the se. CHAPTER XX. Now here be-gynneth kyng Mordreins Storie, that vppon a Roche In the se is Certeinlye; that Owt of his Regiown xvii. Iornees was, With-Inne the se In A perilous plas. Abowtes the Owr of Noon it was tho whanne the holigoost In √æat Roche put him tho; And there the holigost Schewed him thanne Al so mochel richesse as evere Sawgh Manne; And whanne vppon this Roche he was alyht, In his herte he was wondirly Afryght. Whanne Abowtes vppon the Roche he lookede tho, And beheld how Into A straunge Contre he was I-do, Where-Offen he thowghte tho In his herte Neuere that deseisse forto Asterte; And there-fore but litel wondir it were Thowgh Sore Abasched were he there, For ?it hadde he non ful knoweng That In the paleys he hadde of his swevenynge; And Evere he Merveilled In his thowht How that he thedir was tho browht, And In him Self hadde gret Merveillinge Ho that thedir dide him tho bringe. And thus longe he gan to beholde, That Al his herte gan wexen Colde, For non thing he ne Sawh abowtes hym But the wilde Se, bothe Stowt &amp; Grym, And no more lond there ne was Thanne √æere the Roche stood In that spas. This Roche stont A-Middes the se, Al this Storie now telleth to Me, Evene from Scotlond the Ryhte weye Into Babiloyne, As I the Seye, And from Erlond the weye Also Streyht to babyloyne it doth go. And So hygh the Roche is there, That Ouer the Se I[s] sein Every where; And to Wales there Mihte he se, And Into Spayne Into that partee; So hygh is the Roche In that stounde That kyng Mordreins there ha√æ I-fownde, For it is On of the most heyest plase That In Ony Se Evere ?it sein wase; And this yl So wastful Is, That of non Maner viaunde there-Inne √æere nys, Ne non Erthe that is Mevable, But Al Clene Roche hard &amp; stable; Except √æ? space Of A mannes hond, In √æat place Is there non Erable lond; And Elles Into the harde Se, Clen√´ Roche As it May be. And for that Roche Is so perilows, So hygh, so straunge, &amp; so Merveillous, That ‚Äúthe Roche perilows‚Äùis the Name, For it is of So perilous A fame. Vppon wheche roche sumtyme was diht A Certein habitacle with gret Miht, That A lerrers of the Se hyt Made, And Fowcairs to his name he hade. This lerrers was of so passing Mesure, And of so gret strengthe, I the Ensure, That non Man his gretnesse Cowde discrie, Ne his strengthe to haven In Memorie; So that In this Roche, for certein, His habitacle he made ful pleyn; That So with Verray strengthe &amp; Myht, In that Roche his hows gan he dyht; A large hostel for twenty Men, Thus he gan Areyened than; But In that Roche lay not he, But In A galeye In the Se,‚Äî He, &amp; hise felawes Also,‚Äî Vppon the Se felonie to do. And O√æer whiles In Certein Vppon that Roche they wolden ful plein, A ful gret feer wolden they make, Here pray there-with forto take; So that it semede to Ony Marchawnt That thek√´ plas dide Owht hawnt, That Som Resteng place it hadde be; But here distroction it was, As ?e mown Se; For A?ens that Roch they hurtelid so sore, That Alle to-borsten weren they thore; Thanne Owt of here galeyes gonne they go‚Äî These thevis that this falshed hadden do,‚Äî And tooken bothe √æere Man &amp; good That persched was there In theke flood: And In this Manere distroied this lerrers Mani A Marchaunt &amp; Mariners. Thanne be-fil A wondir Cas, That On, Grete Pompees, that Emperour was Of Romeyns, As happed that day, Of Alle these Merveilles herde he say, As Owt of grece he seilede tho, Toward Cecyle he gan to go. And thus As he seillede Abowte, And took many Garisouns, bothe strong &amp; stowte, That Abowtes be the Se stoode In Ony place be √æ? salt Floode; Thus Cam he toward babyloyne, And thidirward of this thef herde he seyne. Thanne seide this pompee with-Owten faille, ‚ÄòThat theke strong theef ?e scholen asaille.‚Äô And thus to his peple gan he Seyn, ‚ÄúWe scholen him Asayen In Certeyn.‚Äù Anon there Redily dide he dyhte A riht strong galeie, &amp; Of gret Myhte, And put it ful of good vitaille, And Of goode knyhtes, that thef to Asaille. Anon whanne this was Redely dyht, The Se he took Anon there Riht. And fowrty goode knyhtes be ordeyned there, And twenty grete grapelis of Erne √æere were, The Galeyes to the Schipe forto holde,‚Äî Of yrne weren Mad bothe strong &amp; bolde;‚Äî And thus they gonnen to seylen Anon As faste to the Roche as they myhte gon, Bothe be day &amp; Eke be Nyht, Tyl of a hard roche they hadden a syght. And whanne the Roche they gonne to Aspie, It to Aprochen they Seiled ful Nye; And whanne faste by they weren gon, Heren Ancres they Casten √æere Anon, Forto Abyden there that Nyht, Til of the Roche they myhte han better Syht. And whanne √æ? Nyht was wel Apast, To-ward the Roche they Comen In hast; As Ny As a man Mihte Casten A ston, Thus Ny to the Roche Gonne they gon. And whanne these thevis gonnen Aspie, Redeliche they Raped hem, &amp; In hye. But √æ? maister Mariner that was with pompee, Of that Roch knew Al the Sotelte; And √æere As the feer the thevis gonne Make, That partie of the Roche wolde he not take, But be Anothir side they wente, √æere As they fownden presente A strong galeye, that there lay Be-twene √æ? Roch &amp; hem, √æ? sothe to say; And they Comen with so gret A wille That there mani men gonnen to spille, And fillen down Into √æ? Se, Of Men &amp; good, ful gret plente. Thanne they that In √æ? to√æere galeyes were, Wenden the grete schipe hadde persched √æere; So was there tho A ful hard stowr Betwene these Felowns and the Emperour. And wanne they sien it gan so to go, The Emperour to withstonde non power hadden tho, Be litel and litel they Gonne to gon, Til that √æ? Roche they Entred Anon. And whanne pompee gan this to Aspie, Ful lowde he gan hem to discrye, And swoor that he wolde don his Miht, Of tho theves to ben Avenged Ariht. And whanne the thevis this vndirstood, Non lengere there they ne Abood, But to the heithe of the Roche Sekerlye, Ful faste these thevis gonnen hem hye; And After hem xxx knyhtes goode, That departed Owt of that floode; So with-Owten, thritty there were, And with-Inne, xix theves In fere; For alle the Remnaunt of √æese theves tho Weren slayn, And In-to the Se I-do. And whanne this Sawt began to gynne, These theves wrowhten A corsid gynne; They Rolled down I that plas A qwarter Of a galeye √æat broken was, That hevy &amp; boistous it was to be-holde; And down it Cam with strengthe manifolde, And fil Anon down Into the Se, Where-with xi. of Pompees knyhtes slow he, Where-offen pompee hadde so gret Care, Anon him Self to the Roche gan fare, And swoor ‚Äòthat he hadde levere to dye, But avenged he Were there Otterlye, That there so falsly hadde slain his knyhtes At thike same tyme with here fyhtes.‚Äô Thanne On of his knythes there Anon, That say In what peryl that he wolde gon, And Conseilled him ‚Äúforto Abyde Til it were more to the day tyde, And I schal ?ow Certefien Everidel How On these theves to ben Avenged wel; Thanne scholen ?e non men lese, Ne putten ?owre self Into non gret deseisse.‚Äù Thanne Pompee Axede him Anon, In What Manere that it Mihte gon. ‚ÄúSire, of this sawt ?e scholen A while reste; I hope it schal be for ?oure beste.‚Äù But Evere they maden sorwe &amp; wo, For hise goode knyhtes weren slayn so. He forto lesen so mani goode knihtes For A fewe theves In tho fyhtes, Ful gret schame to him he thowhte it was, His knyhtes so to lesen In theke Cas. And On the Morwe whanne it was day lyht, And Pompee of that Roch hadde A syht, So strong A thing say he neuere non As thike Roche that he loked vppon; ‚ÄòAnd non wondir it hadde ben,‚Äô seide he Anon, ‚ÄòThowgh his knyhtes hadde ben slayn Echon.‚Äô Thanne of his knyhtes he Axede Counsaille, ?if to that Roche they Cowden Owght Availle; But non Of hem that was there Cowde him Counseillen In non Manere; For they seiden to him Certeinle But ?if be Enfamyne it wolde not be. Whanne √æ? kyng of hem hadde non O√æer chere, He be-thowghte him In Another Manere, That hem he wolde distroyen Anon Be Angwisch Of fyr √æere Euerychon. Anon A gret fere he let there dyhte Of Olde schepes And Galeyes, √æat brenden so bryhte, That At theke Roche persched hadde been, As all the peple there Myhte it seen; So that this feer there brende so longe tho, That Alle the smolder Into √æat kave gan go; For that feer to stawnchen hadden they non miht, But Euere this feer brende ful lyht. And they benethe gonne hem defende With Arwes &amp; stones that they gonnen vp sende; And they Aboven defensed hem thore With speris &amp; cleyves wondirly Sore. And whanne this feer gan brennen so briht, The thevis tooken fresch water Anon riht‚Äî Where-Offen they hadden Som plente tho‚Äî And In-to that Feer they gonnen it do; Thanne Alle the smoke &amp; √æ? flawme, I √æ? plyht, Into that Cave wente there Anon Ryht, And they benethe schetten ful sore, And stones vp threw with Engynes thore, So that they slowen fowre of the felowns That hadden don sweche distroctiouns. And whanne these thevis Syen this, A?en to √æ? Cave √æey wenten with-Owten Mys; But √æere weren they not wel at Ese, So Evel this Feer it dide hem plese. And whanne they seyen it Miht not be, Alle Anon Owt of that kave gonnen they fle, And with Alle here myht And strengthe ther They purposed to stawnchen this feer. And thanne these knyhtes to hem Ronne, And there sore begeringe they begonne; And the Felowns hem defendid sore, As they that Maymed &amp; Greved wore. And whanne this pompee gan this beholde, For deol his herte gan wexen ful Colde; And to that Rooch he hentred Anon, To-ward √æ? feer, As faste As he Cowde Gon. Anon A?en to the Cave they gonnen to Ronne, For non lengere nolden they blynne; And Pompe After hem tho sewede faste‚Äî For to hem hadde he ful gret haste‚Äî Where that he of hem Slow there fyve; Thanne leften there but xiiii On lyve; To wheche they benethen schotten ful sore, &amp; Manie of hem horten thore, So that Pompe him-self hurt with hem was In thre stedis In that Same plas. And whanne that this beheld Pompees knyghtes, That he was so vegorous In fyhtes, Vppe to the Roche they gonnen to wynne, To sosteine here Lord A?ens hem with-Inne; So that pompee ful Sore gan fyhte, And drof these Felouns Into the Cave Anon Ryht, And putten hem Alle to Mischef, Thike lerrers, that Errawnt thef. And whanne this lerrers bethowhte him tho That they xiiij Of On Man dispised weren so, Owt they Comen Al On Abrest; And this lerrers On pompees Faste threst, And took pompees be bothe scholdres tho, There In that Fer him forto hauen do; But he myhte not Allyng for his knyhtes, But down Fillen they bothe Anon Ryhtes. But Pompee there in Swowneng lay, And bothen Armes of lerrers borsten, in fay. Thanne they benethe Gonnen this beholde, And to here Lord Ronne Manifolde, And to the Schip they him gan bere, And In a Cowche they leyden hem there. Thanne token they thys fals lerrers, And him kepte As A thef So fers. And Alle this whille fowghten the knyhtes Vppon the Roche, and slowgh down Ryhtes. And In this mene whille Of fyhgteng, Awook Pompee Owt Of his swowneng, Where-offen his Meyne ful glad they were, Whanne that he was Recouered there. Thanne Merveilled Pompe wondir sore How that In the Schipe he Cam thore; Thanne his Meyne gan him to telle, In what Maner and how √æat he felle. Thanne this pompee vp Ros Anon, And A?en to that Roche gan he to gon With a ful good strong Spere In honde, Where-with he wrowhte √æ? theves schonde And to that Cave he Entred Again, And there with-Inne he hath hem Slayn, And there threw hem Into the Se, The Fysches Mete Al forto be. Thanne Cam he to the Schipe Again, Where-Offen his Meyne was ful fayn. Thanne Comanded he to taken this lerrers, That was a theef So strong and fers, To bersten bothen his thyes and Ek his bak, And Into the se Casten him with-Owten lak, Thus deliuered thanne Sire pompee That Roche Of felowns, As I telle the. And to Rome seilled he streyht Agein, As I telle ?ow now for certein; And from Rome to Jerusalem he wente, Where that he stablede his hors presente In the holy temple Of Owre lord. Thanne to him Cam seint Petir At On word, And seide to hym In this Manere: ‚ÄúPompee, thow forsakest thi maneres here, And dost moche wers thanne dide lerrers,‚Äî That was a felown bothe strong and fers,‚Äî Thy stable thus here forto Make The heyest hows, that for goddis Sake Was mad to don Inne his Servise. Now thow √æat hows gynnest to dispise, Wherfore I may wel liknen the To Forcaus, that felown sire, perde.‚Äù Thanne from Jerusalem √æis pompe wente, And charged Al his Men wit goode Ente[nte], ‚ÄòThey scholden neuere Of this forcaus speke, In what maner On him he was A-wreke; For to him hadde it ben gret velonie, Vppon A thef to han set his hol Navye;‚Äô For it was On of the grettest prowesse That Evere dide √æ? Emperowr In Ony distresse. CHAPTER XXI. Now Of this Emperour let we now be, And A?en to this kyng now torne we, That into this Roche Is now I-browht, And In what Maner ne Wot he nowht. And there sit he In pensifnesse &amp; In deseise, &amp; With him non thing √æat may him plese; And faste Abowtes he loked him there, But hevene &amp; the se he ne sawh nowhere Ne non sustenance there ne was, But Al disolat In that same plas; Also, dwelling was there non, But hydows &amp; sterne that Roch of ston; And On √æat Rock was there non weye But A path that to √æ? Cave wenten sothlye. Thanne loked he vppon the tothir side; He ne sawh non Comfort In that tyde, But dirkenesse &amp; hard Roche there. Thanne set he him down with hevy Chere, And be-gan to sighen ful sore, To wepen &amp; wringen ?it wel more. Thanne Anon thowghte he In his herte‚Äî Whiche thowght him myhte not Asterte‚Äî That Owre lord him hadde forgeten Clene, That he there so Was browht In tene. And thus as he was In this morneng, The water Of his Eyen Cam renneng: Him thowghte √æat the wawes of √æe se, A wondirful Noise Maden hee; And as he lokede tho him Abowte, He saw Come seilling A schipe wel stowte; The wheche schipe was ful of Bewte, And A wondir fair Man there-Inne to be, That to-forn In the schipe him thowhte he was, Sitteng Al-gate In that same plas; And toward that Roche he drow ful faste, Til that to the Roche he Cam Atte laste. The schipe, Al Of Silver it was, The Naylles Of gold In that plas; And In Middis Of that schipe was there A fair Crois In that Manere. And whanne this schip to √æ? Roche gan Aplye, Alle the swete savours him thowhte sekerly That Evere weren groweng In Oni plas, Him thowhte that In theke schipe tho was. And whanne the Crois he gan to Aspie, Anon In his herte he thowhte In hye, That non wikked thing ne myhte be In plas √æere the Cros was Certeinle. Owt of the schipe Cam this faire man tho, And the kyng A?ens him gan go: ‚ÄúSire,‚Äù he seide, ‚Äúwelcome ?e be Into this plase now Certeinle!‚Äù And with that he knelid a-down, ‚ÄúWelcome Sire, hidir, Of Renown!‚Äù Thanne Axede this fair Man Certeinle, ‚ÄúSire, Of what Contre now be ?e?‚Äù Thanne Answerid the kyng, &amp; seide tho, ‚ÄúA Cristen Man, Sire, I am here, lo.‚Äù Thanne Axede him this goode man tho, ‚ÄòIn what Maner he gan thedir to go.‚Äô Thanne Answerid the kyng Ageyn, ‚ÄúSire, I wot Neuere now In Certein.‚Äù Thanne the king Axede him ful snelle, Whens √æat he was, he Wold him telle. Thanne Answerid the goodman him Agein, ‚ÄúSire, A Crafty Man I am Certein, That nowher non swich Is, in non Contre, So sotel A man As ?e here now Se; For sweche Craftes As I kan do, Of Alle men In Erthe konnen it no mo.‚Äù Thanne Axede the kyng Of him there, ‚ÄòWhat Maner thinges tho Craftes were.‚Äô He seide, ‚Äúthat Owther fowl man O√æer fowl womman, Into Grete bewte he cowde torne than; Also A fool, A Wis man kan I Make; A pore Man, gret Richesse to take; And a low Man kan I Maken hye, I seie the, Sire, Certeinlie.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow Certes, Sire,‚Äù tho quod the kyng, ‚ÄúThis may wel ben A Wondirful werkyng: Now, worthi Sire, And it ?owre plesing wolde be, ?owre Name that ?e wolden tellen me.‚Äù ‚ÄúSire, Gladly, Er I hennes wil gon, My name to tellen the Anon,‚Äî ‚Äò On &amp; Al Only ‚Äô it is Mi Name, Sire, I the seie with-owten blame.‚Äù Thanne quod the king, ‚Äúsire, Certeinly That is a Fair Name, and A ful hy.

Thanne Axede him the kyng tho, ‚ÄòIn what Maner he scholde do, And whethir he scholde √æere long Abyde, Owther thens to Gon with-In schort tyde.‚Äô ‚ÄúNe seist thow,‚Äù quod this good man Ageyn, ‚ÄúThat thow belevest In God Certeyn?‚Äù ‚Äú?e forsothe, Sire,‚Äù quod the Kyng, ‚ÄúAnd that I do Ouer Alle thing, Only &amp; Al In him I beleve, Of wheche schal non man me Repreve.‚Äù ‚ÄúSethen thanne that thow dost so,‚Äù Quod the good man A?en to him tho, ‚ÄúFul Sekir thanne Mihtest √æou be, That he ne wel Not For?eten the, Ne non that In him hath Remembraunce, In what degre he be, Other In what stawnse, In sekir, sere king, I telle it to the, That God ne wil not for?eten the; And therto, what thing √æat thow wilt Crave. Sekir to be, thow myht it have. Sire, tak thow al this for verite, Al that Euere now I haue told to the; For who that In God doth putten his Creaunce, Him may not faille with-Owten variance, That he ne schal haue, At his nede, Of Alle thing that he wele him bede; For man hath he In so gret Cherte, Of non thing so moche, I telle it the. Therefore man, On him to taken non thing I rede, But swich thing As God him bede; And ?if A man In him Self to Moche thenke, And with distorbilons Maketh his herte to swenke, So myhte he fallen I[n] disperaunce; Swich a thing myhte ben his Chaunce.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow, good sire,‚Äù quod the King tho, ‚ÄúMay I thanne Only to God trosten vnto, Of alle thing that me nedith to have, Other what thing that I wele krave; And that God wele thenken On Me, Trowe ?e, sere, that this wil be?‚Äù ‚ÄúA, sire,‚Äù quod this goode man tho, ‚ÄúLo, now In disperaunce √æou Art I-do, That thenkest &amp; seist As thow dost here, In-to A fowl disperawnce √æou fallest there. Therefore I rede the, Ouer Alle thing, That Into bettere Conseille √æin herte √æou bring, And Ouer Alle thing I rede the, Thin mynde thou sette vppon √æ?

And thus A long tyme he him thowhte In what maner that he thedir was browhte, Of wheche he Cowde knowen non Certeinte Of this Mater ?it In non manere degre.

And whanne bothe Schipe &amp; man was Agon, Into A gret Morneng he fyl Anon; But In his herte he thowghte ful Certeinlye That thike man From God kam An hye; For he wiste wel be the Signe of the Crois That it was Only be goddis voys; For And he hadde been A dedly man, He Cowde not han Spoken As he dide than.

Thanne Cam he to his Mynde Agein As he to-forn was Al In Certein, And kneling, to God made his preyere In this Maner As ?e scholen here: ‚ÄúO thow swete lord God Almyhty, That Comfort And Ese dost to Alle Sory, And me hast deliuered of Manie gret distresse, Of Mani Aventures, &amp; Of Mani heveynesse; And Of Mani hevynesses which weren Comenge, Thow me deliueredest, thow Glorious kynge!

And In this Mene whille tho This good man to the schipe gan go. Anon As he Owt of his thowht Awook. Vp gan he stonde, and Abowtes him look, And Nethir Man ne Schipe Sawh he, As fer As he loked Into the Se; For In the same Maner As he to-fore wente, Riht so dide he tho to his Entente. Thanne this kyng Merveilled wondir sore What Manere Of Man that this were That so him Certefyed Of Alle thing, As wel Of begynneng As Of the Endyng. Thanne ful sore him self he gan to blame, That he ne hadde Enqwered his Name, And Enserched what he hadde be, Owther God, Owther Man In Ony degre; Evere vppon this point ful sore he thowhte, That theke Man to knowen Myhte he Nowhte. ?it Anothir thing him Rewede sore tho, Whanne that this good man was Ago, That he ne hadde Enqwerid of him there, ?if he scholde han lyved In that Manere, Tyl that to him he hadde Comen Ageine,‚Äô And this of him forgat he to Refreine. Al thus the kyng longe to him Self spak, Til Atte laste he herde A gret Noise with-owten lak, Cryeng of wawes Of the se; But ful gretly he Merveilled what it myhte be. Thanne he gan him to dressen Anone Vpward, &amp; Into the Se he loked ful sone, And westward him thowhte Cam seilyng √æere The same schipe, &amp; In the selve Manere, That the faire womman Cam In to-fore, Where-Offen Abasched he was ful sore; For he him dradde sore, as he stoode, That sche ne Cam for none Goode. Thanne to God preyde he ful faste, His sowle forto kepen, so was he Agaste; What so Evere become Of his flesch He ne Rowhte, whe√æer hard O√æer Nesch. And thus In his preieres was he stedfast Al the while thar It Myht last, That of his goode purpos not left schold he be; Thus preide he to God In Maieste. And whanne his Orisown thus was I-do, Into the Est Anon he torned him tho, And there Anon Made he his devociown‚Äî In Minde of Ierusalem, that worthy town Where-Inne thei gonnen Crist Crucifye, That blessid body, the Sone Of Marye,‚Äî Owt Of his Caytyvite him forto bringe, &amp; deliueraunce of the womman that was Comenge. With this Cam √æ? Schipe to √æ? Roche Anon Also faste As it Myhte gon, Also &amp; as Riche As it was Ere; Thus there him thowhte In Alle Manere. And whanne to the Roche Aryved sche was, Owt of √æ? schipe sche Cometh a ful gret pas; But the king ?af hire √æere non Greting, Ne non Word to hire spak At here Comeng. And whanne sche Sawh √æat he wolde not speke, Anon there sche gan to him Reke, And gan him Axen ‚Äòhow he hadde fare Sethen the tyme sche was last thare.‚Äô Anon he seide, ‚Äòsche ne hadde not to do Of no thing him to Refreinen so;‚Äô And O√æer Answere tho hadde sche non; Ches whethir sche wolde Abyden O√æer gon. And whanne sche him herde thus Answere, Anon to lawhen be-gan sche there: ‚ÄúKyng Eualach,‚Äù sche seide, ‚ÄúI se by the, Thow hast lost bothe mynde &amp; Memore; For sethen that thou took this CreAunce, The hath behapped ful Mochel Noisaunce, Ful Mochel sorwe and trebulaciown, And ?it Mochel More is the forto Com, And ?it there-offen ?evest √æou neuere Adel, But, As me Semeth, it liketh the wel As Ony worschepe √æat Evere haddest √æou, And as moche it were for thy prow.

But for Owht that sche Cowde sein him to, Owt [from] that Roche Nolde he not Go. And whanne sche Saw that with non falsnesse Him Ouercome ne bringen In distresse, Sche bad him ‚ÄòCome sen the Riche thinge That In that schipe sche dide him bringe.‚Äô Thanne to hire seide the kyng Ageyn, √æat ‚ÄúIn the Schipe I ne wele not Comen Certein, Ne for non thing that thow kanst do, Owt from this Roch I wele nowht go.‚Äù Thanne Onkeuered sche the schipe In haste, And preide him loken Atte laste. Thanne the kyng loked In for the Nones, Where-Inne he sawh many preciows stones, As that him thowhte there to his Eye, And mochel Other Richesse Sekerlye. ‚ÄúLo, kyng Eualach, thow wenest that I be For non goodnesse I-comen to the; But ful wel mystest thow weten &amp; knowe, That Al this Richesse √æat here Is On A rowe May Not Comen from non Evel plase,‚Äî For ful mochel Ioie there is, there this wase,‚Äî And ?if thow wilt with me now go, Owther My Cownseil Assentyn vnto, Al this Richesse schalt thow have, And ?it Mochel more ?if √æou wilt Crave.‚Äù Lo Al this Counseil ?af this wommanne To this kyng Eualach there thanne; But for alle hire wordis &amp; hire faire promyse, Thens wold he not Gon In non wyse; And ?it ful moche distorbeled he was For his qweene &amp; Seraphe In that plas.

And Euere Answerid this kyng Agein, Onlich Of goddis myht tho In Certein, And Also of Goddis Rihtful Creaunce, ‚ÄúWhiche that I wil holden with-Owten variaunce; And for Alle the ?iftes &amp; the beheste, Ne√æer for Alle the Richesse, lest ne Meste, Ne schal me tornen Owt Of my thowht From him that me dere hath bowht.‚Äù Whanne √æat sche sawgh that in non degre Owt Of that Roche to don him fle, Nethir for ?iftes ne non qweintise, Ne for non thing √æat sche Cowde devise, Thanne Anon to √æ?

Anon Riht thanne As sche was Gon, A fowl strong tempest there Ros Anon, Riht As fowl &amp; hidows it was thore As it was the tother day there before. Thanne here-Offen Merveilled √æ? kyng Anon How that this womman was so gon, And that Al the Richesse hadde him browht, Whethir that it were Owht O√æer nowht, And that In schort while sche hadde I-be At Sarras, &amp; to him I-comen thedir A?e, ‚ÄúThe wheche xvij dayes iourne scholde be As to forn tymes sche told it to Me.‚Äù And whanne this tempest he Sawh thus fare, In his herte he hadde ful Mochel care; And so gret dirknesse fil him vpon, That sihte there myhte he sen non, But ?if it were tyme of lyghteneng That to him Cam beforn the thondring; And Evere this tempest trowbled faste, That seker, Euere he wende it wold han laste. And whiles he was In this thenkyng, Him thowhte he herde A wondir sowneng Wheche that scholde Comen from An hy. As tho him thowhte ful trewely; So, what for ferd &amp; for that sown Streiht to the Erthe he fyl Adown, That he ne myht steren foot ne hond, Nethir non lyme where-Onne to stonde, But that Onne this, with his hondis two, To the Greces of the Roche he Cleved tho. And whiles that he lay In this degre, Anon A thondir Clape Cam there fle, That Al the heyest partye of that Roche Anon Into the se-botme gan forto gon, So that there lefte but a litel spase The kyng Onne to Reste √æat there wase; And the Remnaunt that was smeten Away, Was neuere more sein Into this day. Anon the kyng for drede fil there A-down, Ful longe there liggeng In a swown. Whanne Owt of his swowneng Awaked was he Thorgwh the Comforteng Of the Maiestie, Al the tempest was Ouer gon, That noise ne thondring herde he non; Therto the See, In pesible stat it was, That to fore tyme was hidows in √æat plas, So that of tempest herd he neuere A del, Wheche to forn times he herde ful wel. Thanne Abowtes him loked he ful faste, And the Roche he Missede atte laste, Whiche √æat was the heyest partye; Thanne In his herte hadde he gret Anoye, And In his Mynde was gretly Abascht, How that Roche was so de-dascht. Thanne Anon gan he forto Make The signe Of the Crois, for Owre lordis sake; Bothe vppon his hed and vppon his body He made the Signe of God Almyghty, And besowhte God, for his special grace, Him to Comforte &amp; kepen, In that place, In Riht wit, Mynde, &amp; Memorye; Thus this kyng tho to God gan Crye. And whanne thus his preieres he hadde I-do, A wondirful lust thanne Cam him to, That he moste slepen Nedelye, As here vs telleth this storye; So that On the Roche there he slepte, Vppon swich A spas As him was lefte; And whanne Of his slepe √æat he A-wook, Swich An hunger there him took, That him thowghte ded forto be, But ?if of Mete he hadde plente. And whanne thus longe ne had mad his Mone To him Self there Al Alone Of his Misaise and hunger ful strong, So √æat lyven him thowghte myhte he not long: And as Abowtes him he lokede there, He say, him thowghte, In a qweynt Manere, Ligeng vppon A grees Of ston, A wondir blak lof there Anon; And whanne this lof beheld he tho, A wondir strong pas he gan forto go To-ward thike lof, [it] for to take, Lik As gret hunger it gan to Make. And whanne he hadde it In his hond, It forto breken tho gan he fond; But therto hadde he no Miht; But al hol to his Mowth Anon riht He it there putte, to han biten vppon; And therto his Mowth he Openede Anon. And In the Mene whille him thowghte he herde A wondirful noise, and qweyntely Ferde, As thowgh Alle the fowles of the Eyr To him ward they gonnen Repeire; For wheche gret drede In that Manere Anon his hed he lefte vp there; And to him there Cam discending Adown A merveillous fowl with a wondirful sown; For so wondirful he was, &amp; so divers, That neuere to forn tyme tonge Cowde Rehers; The hed of him was as blak As pich, Ne non Othir Colowr was it lich; And therto, bothe his Eyen &amp; his teeth, As brennenge Fir forsothe they beth; But the schape Of his hed, it was Lik An Orible dragon In that plas, And therto two hornes In his hed; It was A wondirful sihte In that sted: Also A ful long nekke like to a dragown; A wondirful brid, &amp; of a qweynte faciown; His brest lik a lyown Schapen was there; His feet like an Egle In A qweynte Manere; And from √æ? Joyntes Of his feet to √æ? scholdres vpriht. Wondirful wynges, &amp; swyft to flyht,‚Äî As swift they weren In alle thing As to-forn the thondir is the lyhgtenyng‚Äî And therto As hard As Ony steel, As scharpe As A Rasowr bytyng ful wel; Therto his fetheris white weren Also, As scharpe as storm Of hail therto; And whanne that scharply he fyl A-down, This ilke brid made A wondirful sown. And therto the bek of his hed that was there, It was as scharpe As Ony spere, And Also brennenge, vppon forto se, As lyghteneng that to-fore √æ? thondir doth fle. Uppon this Maner, lik As ?e here, Was this brid On this Manere, As Recordeth here the devyn storye That to vs hath put In Memorye; So that this Bryd ne fleeth be non weye, But that alle briddis &amp; bestes of hym haven Eye; Be whom, √æ? Saviour Of al this world In this brid scheweth, be his Owen Acord, Bothe his miht &amp; Ek his drede; And alle Creatures of hym took hede; For that brid is so dowted, I telle it the, That be what weye that Evere he fle, Bothe brid &amp; beste they don him fle, Lik as be figiure I schal Schewen to √æ?: Behold, how √æat derknesse to forn √æ? sonne doth fle, Riht so Alle briddes &amp; bestes, I telle it the, So fleen the sihte Of this brid, lo, That to forn tymes I declared ?ow so. And of swich kynde this brid it is, That As thre to-gederes with-Owten Mis‚Äî As the Scripture Recordith now here‚Äî That As thre Oueral he flikth In fere, Lik as he that of a womman was born With-Owten compeine of Man, As I have rehersed beforn; And whanne Redy to ben born they be, Of A wondirful kynde this storie scheweth to me; For so Cold they been In Alle thing there, That non wiht duren it May In non Manere, Sawfe Only the modir of the same, Wihche is a brid of a Merveillous fame; For whanne this long suffred hath sche, And non lengere with that Cold may sche be, Hire Eyren sche leveth, &amp; taketh hire flyht Into a fer Contre there Anon Ryht, Where that sche hopeth forto fynde A precious ston of Merveillous kynde, Wheche In the vale of Ebron is at alle dayes, Of a wondirful kynde, as the storye sayes; For Of his owne kynde he is so hot, That non man therwith him self dar frot Til it gynne Chawfe Of his Owne kynde, Thus fareth theke ston So good &amp; hende. For there as Cold is, it loketh pale, As kynde telleth vs be Olde tale; And whanne Cold thing A-chawfed is Owht, Anon to Red Colowr it is I-browht; And thus be frotyng Of that ston, It be-Cometh Red as Ony Blood Anon. And whanne this brid this ston hath fownde, Therwith sche hire Chafeth In that stownde; And litel &amp; litel sche schawfeth hire so, Til that hire Cold be ful nygh Ago. And ?it In hire beek sche taketh it thore, And hire self doth chawfe ?it wel more; And ?it sche thinketh ful litel there For the grete Cold √æat sche soffred Ere; And whanne that hete sche feleth plente, A?en to hire Eyren thanne doth sche fle. Whanne that In place sche cometh there As to forn tymes hire Eyren were, So hot sche semeth to been with-Inne, That Al hire body on fyr doth brenne, That hire Self helpen sche ne May, So hot sche is with-Inne, √æ? sothe to say; And therfore thanne weneth sche That hire Eyren Alle I-brend scholde be, So that sche withdraweth hire there fro, And with hire body not neigheth hem tho, But √æat A good spas from hire nest, As hire self it liketh hire best; So √æat be the hete of hire body so fer fro, Hire briddes sche bringeth forth Alle √æ?, That for Cold scholden Ellis dye: This is here kynde ful Certeinlie. And thus, thorwgh Chawfyng of this ston, The Modir to powdir is brend Anon. And whanne hire briddes thus browht forth be, Abowtes the Asches of hire Modir gonne they fle, And there-Offen taken here sustenawnce That was theke tyme to here plesaunce, Tyl that they haven bothe lif &amp; membres: Thus Eten they of here Moder Syndres. And whanne Alle they ben Eton Echon, The Syndres Of here Modir, &amp; not √æeroffen left on. Anon So prowde they wexen Alle thre, That prowdere briddes ne Mown neuere be; Thanne Comen the tweyne that males be, That neither Other may suffre In non degre; And whanne here ful strengthe fully they have, Eche of hem Of √æ? thridde, Maistrie doth Crave, To han the femele At his owne wille; Thus to Othir forseth him vntille, So that Anon, thorwgh gret pride, The ton the tothir Sleth that tyde. Scipilions, is Clepid this brid, As thus In this storie it is red. Swich was the brid that decendid √æere Down to the kyng In this Manere, And smot the lof Owt Of his hond, That to his mowth to putten gan he fond; And Into the see he threw it there, Riht fer In a Merveillows Manere. And whanne he hadde so I-do, He took his flyht, &amp; fleygh him fro; And Aftirwardis he torned Ageyn, And the kyng to the Erthe was fallen pleyn; And with his Ryht wynge he smot him so That his Clothes &amp; his Skyn he barst vnto, And from the haterel In to the foot, Into the harde flesh that strok it bot; And thanne this brid took forth his flyht From that kyng Anon Tho Ryht. And √æ? kyng In swowneng at the Erthe lay, For drede &amp; sorwe of that grete Afray, Tyl that the day was Nygh Agon, And the Nyht faste Entrede vppon. And whanne he was waked of his swowneng, Ful feint &amp; feble he was In alle thing, That of the grete hunger he hadde to fore, Whiche that him Greved so sore, Thowgh Alle worldly mete thanne had he sein, There-Offen to Ete he ne mythe Certein. And thus Abod he Al that Nyht Tyl on the Morwe it was day lyht; And whanne the day be-gan to dawe, Thanne √æeroffen was this kyng ful fawe. Thanne he bethowghte him In his mynde Of that brid so Merveillous of kynde, That his lof so hadde Casten Away. Many thankynges to God he ?af that day, And seide, ‚Äúlord God, I-worscheped thow be, That from Alle these sorwes hast deliuered me, &amp; wilt that I do bigge my synne Ere than I Owt Of this world twynne; For swiche wordis Of solace ?e han me sent, That Of hunger have I lost myn talent, Sowfe Only hunger Of sowle to susteyne; Therfore, lord, I me to the Compleyne. Now knowe I wel that this Maner thing To me hidir Cam for non forthering, But me to deceyven be weye of Richesse, Be ?iftes, Owther be fayr promesse; And √æerfore schal I neuere, In tyme comenge, My Mowth to Opene for non Swich thing, Thowgh the body Scholde suffren ded Rathere thanne to Eten Ony bred, But ?if it be, lord, thorwgh thy sonde, Ony to handelyn with Myn honde; Ne neuere Owt of this Roch wele I gone, But evere here dwellen Alone, Tyl that, lord, thy wille It be, Owt of this Roche to taken Me.‚Äù And thus vi dayes beleft the kyng In that Roche, with-Owten lesyng; And Eche Of these dayes Cam this good man, And him comforted As he wel kan: Thanne swed the womman After, Eche day, Of him to fonde to geten hire pray. This Man Euere him tolde wordis Of Comfort As Often As to him he gan Resort, And Euere spak the womman of Noysaunce To hym, And Euere Of distorbaunce. And whanne it was Comen to √æ? seventhe day, This good man to him Cam with-Owten delay, And thus to him seide there in haste, ‚ÄúThin Owr of deliueraunce Aprocheth faste, ?if thow wilt hennes-forward The kepen from temptaciou[n]s hard Of the devel, whiche he wil Asaye In many weyes the to be-traye.‚Äù Thanne Axede him the kyng ‚ÄòIn what Manere From him he myhte defenden him there.‚Äô Thanne seide A?en this goodman tho, ‚ÄúWrath-the not thy God, what so thow do, And Owt Of this Roch deliuered schalt √æou be With-Inne schort tyme Certeinle; But ?it Manye dredes schalt thou se Er that owt of √æis Roche taken thow be.‚Äù Thanne thus partid this good man Away; The kyng there lefte, sothe to say. Ful glad &amp; Joyful he was In herte, That non thing ne myhte him smerte, And thowhte, ‚Äòthowgh that he schold dye, Owt Of that Roche wolde he not hye, But Rathere ded there he wolde be, Thanne Owt of that Roche forto fle.‚Äô Thus longe In this thowht gan he dwelle, That Aftir tyme So it be-felle He loked ful fer Into the See: A fair Schipe Cam √æere seylleng, thowht he; bothe gret &amp; Riche him thowghte it was; bote ne√æer man ne womman In that plas that Schipe to Governe, nethir to Gye, thus him thowhte ful Certeinlye. and whanne longe it hadde so go In the hyghe See bothe to &amp; fro, atte laste towardis the Roche he drowgh A ful gret speed, &amp; faste I-nowgh. and thus sone began there In the see wondirful tempestes √æere Anon to be, So hidous &amp; so Angwischous in eche Manere, that so hidows tempest saw he neuere ere. this tempest this Schipe to the Roche browhte, that it scholde Alto-breken him thowghte; It snew, &amp; haillede, &amp; thondrede faste, So that √æere was manie A bitter blaste, So that it Semede that Al the firmament On peces hadden borsten verament; For he wende the Ende Of √æ? world √æat day had be; thus thowghte the kyng thanne ful sekerle. And the kyng in √æat Roche had non sted Where that he Myhte hyden In his hed, For the part Of the Cave was blowen Away Into the See, As ?e han herd me Say. And this faire Schipe beheld he thanne; but he say nethir Man ne wommanne. and so thikke Abowtes him Cam the thondring, and Many A wondirful lyghteneng, that Neuere he wende to asckapen thenne, so wondirfully √æ? lyghtenyng gan to brenne; thus Suffrede the kyng Al that tempest, whiche After it torned him for the best; Al this was disseisse to his herte, for he soffred peynes Many &amp; smerte; but for alle the peynes he suffrede tho, to the Schipe from the Roche wolde he not go. And whanne this tempest hadde longe be, thanne Atte laste gan stillen the See, and the wedir to Cleren faire, and the sonne to Schewen vppon the Ayre; and whanne he sawgh the wedir thus slake, Ful gret Ioye he gan tho to Make. thanne the Sonne there vppon him Schon, and thanne the kyng lokid vp Anon, and sawh his Clothes Al to-Rent, where-Offen he Merveilled verament. and thanne so sore the Sonne chawfed him √æere, that he wende Al the Roche hadde ben on fere, and that the sonne scholde han brend Alle thing, Of this world to han Mad An Endeng. and al was don for this Skele tho, ?if √æ? kyng Into the Schipe wolde han go, Ferst for Cold, and sethen for hete; but for nethir the kyng √æ? Roch wolde not lete; for Rathere ded there wolde he han be, thanne his lord to wraththen In Ony degre; O√æer that from √æ? Roche he wolde gon, Rathere the deth to suffren Anon. and thus In this Angwisch longe bod he there, and In swowneng fyl In hard manere; and so longe lay he Stille As A ston, That wit, syghte, ne Mynde, hadd√´ non. And whanne that he of swowneng A-wook, For drede &amp; sorewe ful sore he qwook, and lift vpe his hed, and beheld ful faste ?if that strong hete ?it dide Owht laste. and Whanne he sawh the day √æat mesurable was, and but Mesurable hete In that plas, As betwenes noon &amp; hevesong scholde be, bothe glad &amp; Ioyful thanne was he; thanne Asaied he Anon vpe forto stonde, For the vanite In his hed that hadde ben longe; And whanne √æat he gan vpe forto dresse, In hed, body, ne Membres, felt he non Siknesse. thanne stood he vp On his feet, and there abowtes him loked ful sket, and Merveilled Of the grete Aventours That he hadde there suffred Of dolours; and Of Alle this thanne felte he Ryht nowht, Where-Offen he Merveillede In his thowht; and Otherwhille he thowghte A dremenge to be, and Otherwhilles he thowhte it for Certeinte, and Otherwhilles he Cowde Remembren him wel Of the Aventures thanne Everidel. CHAPTER XXIV. There is no break in the English MS, but it goes straight on with the new subject of Celidoyne in prison, p. 309. The copier of it must have left out a column or page of his original. Thanne thowghte the kyng al In his herte Of Manie trebulacions &amp; of peynes smerte; that the day was past, &amp; wax to Eve, thanne the kyng ful sore gan him Meve. Anon thanne lokede he fer Into the See; A fair schipe fast seillyng Comen sawgh he, therto so Richely arayed him thowhte it was, but he nyste Of his Comeng what was √æ? cas, for so Riche A schipe, him thowghte, sawgh he neuere non To fore tymes On non water nethir Seylen ne gon. and whanne the Schipe Aproched him ny, Anon Into √æat Schipe he lokede An hy, and Sawgh where that hengen scheldes two; In √æ? forcastel Of the Schipe they weren I-do, Where-Inne was A towr ful Rialy I-dyht, As semed √æat tyme to the kyng In Syht; On wheche towr, As I vndirstonde, bothe scheldes to-gederis diden they honge; Of wheche the ton scheld was his, the tother Nasciens wit-Owten Mys: thus him thowghte wondirly Sore, but Evere he Merveilled how they Comen thore. And whiles that he stood In this thowght, to √æ? Roche this Schip Anon was browght: and as it was to that Roche Comenge, Of An hors he herde A wonderful Neyenge, and so bonchede &amp; ferde with his feet that it thowghte the schipe to bersten In √æat fleet.

And thus to him Self he gan to Speke, And to him self his herte gan breke, And seide, ‚Äúlord I thanket to the Of alle the deseisse thow sendest Me, For moche more, worthy I am to have, My Sowle ?if I scholde Ony wise save.‚Äù And whanne to this yl he was I-browht he loked Abowtes him, &amp; Say Ryht nowht but the Eir, the yl, and the See; In ful gret Merveyl thanne was he; for how that thedir he was I-gon, In what Manere ne wiste he non; And Abowtes him he loked pure faste, &amp; Al that yl was barein &amp; ful waste, and so stronge passeng hete there, that he ne myht it Endure In non Manere. thanne wiste he neuere In what partye Of that yl how he myht this hete drie; but Euere hadde In Remembraunce Of his thedir Comeng, &amp; Of that Chaunce, and of Celidoine his ?ongest sone √æat with him In preson was done, Which that was mochel In his Mynde, That Gentyl Child, that was so kynde.

Thus slept Nasciens Al that Nyht Til on the Morwen it was day lyht, Where that In Avisioun him thowhte he sye Merveillous thinges ful Sekerlye: him thowhte he sawh gret plente White briddes Abowtes him to be. And whanne that these briddes he gan beholde, In his herte he Merveilled Manifolde, for somme Of hem flowen wondir hye, and somme wondir lowe Certeinlye, and the tothir partye Of hem tho From the Erthe ne myhte not go, ne flen nowher from the grounde; Where offen he Merveilled that stownde. thanne Comen there tweyne of √æ? grettest of Alle, and down to the Erthe Gonne they falle; At his two feet they descendyd Adown there, And Into the Eyr they him gonnen bere. thanne whanne he was In the Eir An hy, they seiden, ‚ÄúNasciens, fle forth boldly.‚Äù thanne Nasciens him self be-gan to beholde; tho hadde he wenges that lyhtly wolde folde and Aplyen to his flyht thanne therto; him thowhte he was ful Ioly tho; Al whit him thowhte his wenges were, and that lightliche he myht fleen there. thanne thus Sone him thowhte Anon that these grete briddes weren Agon; tho that Maden him forto fle so liht, from him weren past Owt Of his siht. thanne to Nasciens A?en thei gonne Restore, And to him these briddes Seiden thore, And boden him ‚Äò?even hem Som Mete, Swiche good As he Cowde Gete.‚Äô thanne Answerid this Nasciens A?en tho, ‚ÄúWhat Mete Welen ?e that I gete ?ow to, And I Wele fulfillen it to my power What So Evere it be, O√æer fer other nere.‚Äù thanne Answerid the briddis Ageyn, ‚Äúthat neuere fulfilled scholen we ben Certein, Ne Neuere Replet with non Mete that thow myht ?even vs forto Ete, but thine Owne herte Only vs on to Fede now Certeinly.‚Äù Anon he drowgh Owt his Owne herte, and the brid it ?af, and nold it not Asterte. Anon the Brid Resceyved it Ioyfully, &amp; therwith flew ful fer An hy With ful gret Ioye &amp; melodye; And thus he Seide In his langage, As A brid for his kynde singeth In a kage: ‚ÄúNow Am I fulfild,‚Äù seide this brid, ‚ÄúOf this herte As it is be-tyd; For now I have browht this thing with me That non Wiht knoweth Certeinle; For it is but A litel thing that the grete lyown hath Offe knoweng, Wheche alle Erthly bestes With Membre &amp; body Vndir him ther kepeth he Certeinly. and Whanne he hath Ouercomen hem Everichon, ‚Äîthus thowghte Nasciens that he gan don‚Äî And Alle vndir his feet put hem tho, ?it him thowhte he ne hadde not do, but In to the hevene he wolde than fle With that he hadde thanne Sekerle. thanne him thowhte that his flyht took he, and that Abouen Alle Mownteynes gan to fle, Ek the wawes of the Se, and the depnesse, And the hevene Entred with-Owten distresse.‚Äù And thus him thowhte thanne Nascien, That to him the Brid Seide Certein.

Whanne Nasciens Felt &amp; Sy al this thing, Ful Mochel he hadde ther-off Merveillyng; But he ne Cowde Aperceyven why that the yl So mevede tho trewly. thanne Anon Nasciens vp-dressed him tho, And the yl A?en gan tremblen Also; Anon he beheld A-bowtes wel faste, &amp; √æ? ton hed of the yl down bowed Atte laste, and the to√æer hed gan to Rysen √æere An hy; thus thowhte him to his sihte Certeinly. and ?it this yl not ful litel it was, For with-Inne it Self it hadde A gret spas, For foureskore Miles it was Abowte, and Sevene &amp; fyfty in length with-Owten dowte; but Rathere More that yl was there thanne lasse In Ony other Manere; For it is the Gyse Of this Storye, In non Manere Of wyse forto lye. Ful plein this Storye putteth In Mynde, that Al the Certeinte of Sank Ryal is hard to fynde for ony Man that Evere of womman was born, As I haue ?ow Often Rehersed beforn; For that holy storye that to therthe Anexed was, as Scheweth the Mowth Of trow√æ? In this plas, Which is Jesus Crist, Goddis sone, that for vs on the Roode was done; For In him Neuere falsnesse was fownde, Ne neuere non Errour In non stownde. For ther Neuere was Creature so hardy that dorste with-sein this holy story, Whiche Crist him self with his Owne hond It wrot vs forto don to vndirstond. And therfore to more worschepe it scholde be take thanne for Ony Othir Mannes Sake, For we ne Radden neuere In non storye that Crist him Self wrot Sekerly to forn his passiown In Ony stede but In two, As we don Rede, Whanne to Moises he wrot the lawe, and him it be-took be √æ? Olde dawe. the Secund was whanne √æ? Jewes certeinly a womman hadden take In Avowtry; For to proven On hire his dom Anon, With hire to-fore Jesus Gonne they gon; him forto tempten In this wise, to him they hire browhte to haven I-wise. thanne Crist to the Erthe Enclyned presente, and wrot In the Erthe Er he furthere wente With his fynger Evene Ryht there, As Recordeth the Story thus here; For Crist that tyme ful wel it wiste, al here Entent, and Al here liste; Only to Asayen what he wolde do, the Iewes this womman browht him vnto. thanne Crist to hem tho seide Ageyn, ‚Äúbe-holdeth now here what this doth seyn; Whiche that is Giltles Of ?ow Alle, the Ferste ston on hire let falle.‚Äù and In this Manere Crist told hem here Sawe Forto fulfillen here Olde lawe that Moises hem tawhte be tho dayes,‚Äî As this holy Storye to vs here Seyes,‚Äî ‚Äò?if that a womman do Ony Avowtrye And with Ony Other man ligge Onlye thanne be hire Owne husbonde,‚Äî thus was the lawe In that londe,‚Äî that Anon I-stoned scholde sche be, Alle swiche that weren taken In Avowtre. √æerfore Crist wiste thanne ful wel Alle here thowhtes Every del, That to hym Comen they For tempteng, and Elles Seker for non Other thing; Therfore Schewed Crist hem In that degre Alle here Owne Siynnes there Openle, And Ek Schewed hem there In that Scripture Alle the lignage Of man, I the Ensure; how that of so gret fowlnesse &amp; vilete that Man was of Mad, there gonnen they se; For tho wordis hadden this Mevynge holiche as heire to Owre vndirstondynge. For thus be-began this Scripture to Seye Al Openly there to the Jewes Eye, ‚Äúhar, Erthe! why Art thow so hardye &amp; so fre The Erthe to Acvsen In Ony degre?‚Äù this is so mochel here forto seyne, ‚ÄòO thow Man that of filthe art Mad Certeine.

And ?if he Conne Aleggen Ony O√æer wyse In Ony degre As for his Repryse, For A leseng it moste be taken Certeine, Of Alle Swich that it don Sosteyne. thanne thus May I ful boldly Seyn: that O√æerwise beleven, they lyen ful pleyn, but that God with his Owne hond this Storye doth vs forto vndirstond, Sethen that he lefte the dedlich flesch here, and In hevenly Maieste was Clothed withowten pere. CHAPTER XXVIII. Now bothe Resown &amp; Ryht it is A?en to the Storye to tornen with-Owten Mis, And to this yl to tornen Anon Agein, That so brood &amp; so longe Is In Certein; And ?it it to vs Scheweth Apressly, the declarenge Of this holy Storye, That Nasciens was In the laste Ende, that Gentyl dwk so good &amp; kende. Towardis the west partye of the see This ful trewe dwk thanne was he; but ?it the see not So nygh he was, that be-twene hem was a ful gret spas, the Mowntawnce Of Sevene Miles bedene, and An half Mile, with-Owten wene. Whanne Nasciens the day Gan to dawe, thanne Of that Sihte he was ful fawe, And that he myhte haven Ony knowenge Of what partie of the see he was, with-Owten varienge; And for As Mochel as the day is more Comfortable thanne is the Nyht, with-Owten Ony fable, For Evere hadde he In ful hopinge, Be the day to hauen had som Comfortynge. and with this, Nasciens, In-to the Est he knelid adown, and there Anon to God Made his Orisown, Preyeng to Jesus that was Maryes sone, (As Other God than him ne knew he none) ‚Äòthat he Wolde of his gret Mercye,‚Äî ‚Äîlik As he was On Only god verraylye, And that non Other god neuere Nas but he, Most Myhtful god In Maieste, In whiche On Only god beleved he, thre persones, but on God in vnite,‚Äî that Swich Counseil he wolde him sende, helthe to his Sowle, his lif to Amende.‚Äô And whanne thus his preyere he hadde I-do, The Signe Of the holy Cros On him made he tho, and Also he Made it In his face, the strengere to be thorwh goddis grace. and whanne he hadde thus I-do, to the nexte party of √æ? Se wente he tho; &amp; whanne he hadde gon the spas of half a Myle, Into the See he gan loken with-Inne A while; A lytel thing him thowhte he say Comen there, No More thanne A swan As thowh it were, That streyht to the yl it gan Aplye‚Äî As this Storye vs scheweth ful sekerlye;‚Äî to the same Ende that he Inne was, thedir it Appliede, As happed be Cas. and whanne he Saw it So faste Comenge, Euere the grettere it wax, to his semenge; but thanne mihte he not ful wel go; For so forbrosed his feet weren tho with the Chenes Of his presownenge, that to Walken hadde he non likynge: and Anothir Skele there was also, that he nas neuere Mochel wont forto go. ?it wente he forth with ful gret peyne, And Aftir that thing he loked A-geyne Wheche that he beheld In the Morwenyng, that to-ward the yl Cam flotering; and thanne parceyved he Sone In haste, That A fair Schipe it was Atte laste, the wheche was [so] wondirly fair &amp; Riche, That In Al this world him thowhte non swiche. And whanne this Schipe he gan be-holde, In his herte he Ioyede ful Manyfolde, And peyned him faste thanne forto go To wardis the See, As he myhte tho; So that With gret peyne &amp; Angwisch Also Atte laste to this Schipe Cam he to. And whanne thedir he was Comen ful Ryht, Ful wery he was, and hadde non Myht. Thanne sawh he that bothe his feet In fere, Alle for hete for-sckorchid were, and Ek for-Rent they weren Also, For the lytel weye that he hadde go; So that Er thike vij miles hadde he gon, It was Of the day the tyde Of Noon; thanne was he bothe feynt, wery, &amp; fastynge, and Al distrowbled for his Travaillynge. Anon thanne loked he A lytel beside Vppon the Ryht half of him In that tyde, thanne Sawh he A Schipe A-Ryde Evene fast by him Also blyve; thanne thowhte him it was the same thing that Al day hadde he Sein to his Supposing; So to-wardis that Schipe he torned Anon Also faste As that he Cowde Gon. the Schipe, So Riche &amp; So fair it was, And Merveillede how that It Cam In to √æat plas. And whanne he be-gan thus it longe to beholde, In his herte he Merveilled Many folde; And Mochel More Merveil thanne hadde he, For Nethir Man ne womman ne cowde he se that Schip with-Inne to warde O√æer Gye: thus telleth this Storie ful Openlye. thanne gan he him drawen Neer &amp; Neere, Til that to the Schipe he was Come there; and In han Entred ful fayn wold he, ?if Ony Mon there-Inne mihte he Se, and forto proven the trewthe there Of that Bewte In Alle Manere, ?if with-Inne it were As fayre Owt Ryht, As with-Owten it was there to his syht. Anon As In-to the Schip Entren Wold he, In that for-schip he Sawh ful Sekerle lettres Of Gold, I vndirstonde, that As Writeng it was of Caldee londe, that As pitous word they gonne to Speke. thanne Nasciens Ner to the Schip gan Reke; For that Word there so dowtable was To Ony man that Entren wolde Into √æat plas. Lo, these wordis seide the Scripture as I the schal Schewe, I the Ensure, ‚Äúthow that wilt with-Inne me Entren here, loke thou be stedfast In alle manere, And that thou ful of feyth algates be; For with-Innes me nis thing non but feith sekerle; therfore I Rede, devise the ful wel that thow be Clene Everydel, and stedfast In feith &amp; In Creaunce, O√æer elles the be-happeth Som Meschaunce. For stedfast feith, Creaunce it is; and Anon As thow thy Creaunce dost mis In Ony partie Or In Ony degre, I the forsaken Schal ful Sekerle, that Of me Sostenaunce shalt √æou non have, Ne√æer non helpe, thowh thou Crye and Crave, but I schal the faillen In thyn most nede, and leten the fallen with-Owten drede, So that thou schalt I-lost thanne be For fawt of beleve, And thow it fle.‚Äù thanne with-stood this Nasciens In that stede, and these lettres of gold he gan forto Rede; and whanne he hadde longe him bethowht how that Schipe thedir was I-browht, Into the Schipe he wolde han gon, but that word him Stoned Anon that was so dowtful &amp; Charchable, For they Weren Wordis Of non fable. and whanne In this thowht he hadde longe I-be, Other wyse he gan tho him be-se, and him bethowht In Other Manere How that he Scholde Governe him there. Thanne In this manere thus gan he Seyn: ‚ÄúO goode lord God, of Alle thinges Sovereign, the wordis Of this Schipe Seith here, that but feyth nys there-Inne in non manere; and ?if these lettres now trewe here be, thanne wot I wel ful certeinle that this Schipe be ?ow hedir Is I-sent; this knowe I wel thanne verament. And ?if only it be Comen from ?ow, thanne In My Creaunce knowe I now that non Evel thing there-Inne May be, Ne Contrariowsness In non degre that scholde A?ens ?oure glorious Name ben Reprof, velenie, O√æer elles schame. but, lord, I beleve In ?ow ful feithfully; wheche Creawnce I took ful devoutly Of thin One Seriaw[n]t so dere, That √æou wost ben worschepid &amp; beleved In alle manere; And In Stedfast beleve, the Ay worschepinge, I schal In Entren for Ony thinge. For who that Is In thi stedfast beleve, From Alle Misaventures it doth him Meve, and Saueth him, and Ek Alle tho that In thy beleve stedfast go; In what Maner peryl that so he be, thi beleve him saveth Sekerle.‚Äù thus sone Sire Nasciens left vp his hond, and made the signe of Holy Cros, I vndirstond, And Entred In to the Schip Anon Also Faste As he myhte Gon. And whanne that Entred he was with-Inne, Fast loked he Abowtes, and nolde not blynne; In Alle parties loked he ful faste; And so faste he loked Atte laste, So that him thowhte In non Maner of Se A fairere Schipe ne Myhte be; And thus to him Selve he gan to seyn, ‚ÄòThat So fair a schip he Sawh neuere Certein,‚Äô Ne so ful of Bewte ne√æer of Richesse Sawh he neuere to fore As that, I Gesse, As that Same was to his Avis, for of Alle Schepis it bar the pris. And whanne Alle the Corners he hadde Serched Abowte, Aboven and benethen, with-Owten dowte, thanne to √æe bowk of √æ? schipe gan he gon, and there atte laste he fond Anon; he beheld Where heng A Cloth of Whit; it was ful plesaunt to his delyt; and lik A Cowrtyn him thowhte it was, that was hanged In that plas. thanne Anon lefte he vp this Courtyn In haste; there-vndir, a faire bed he fond atte laste, the Wheche the fairest &amp; √æ? Richest bed it was that euere to fore he Saw In Ony plas; and at the hed of the Same bed was A Crowne of gold In that sted; and at the beddis feet Sekerliche A swerd there was, bothe faire &amp; Riche, Wheche vppon the bed it lay Ouerthwert, Al this, Sire Nasciens, it Sawh Apert‚Äî Whiche that Owt of √æ? Skawberk was drawe half A fote &amp; an handful, thus seith this Sawe. this swerd was of diuers facioun Sekerlye, as here Witnesseth this holy Storye, For the pomel was of swich A ston That Colours it hadde Manyon, As Manye As on the Erthe myhte be To his Sihte there weren vpon, sikerle; and Ech Of the Colours hadde a Clerte, and Ech Clerte A vertu, as √æat storie scheweth me, Where As this Storie doth declare Of Mani mo thinges whanne he Cometh thare. thanne to the handyl Of this swerd, there nas non swich In Middillerd; For tweyne Skales it hadde, with-Inne the hond, Of two diuers bestes, as I vndirstond; the ton sckale was In Maner of A Serpent, that In Caldiens lond was most present thanne In Ony O√æer lond Certein; there was his hawntyng I telle ?ow pleyn. and ‚Äòpapagast‚Äô was this Serpentis Name, Whiche was a Serpent of A wondirful fame. For this is the kynde of that Serpent, What man that A bone of his hath verament, him Nedeth neuere non Other hete, Nethir of sonne, ne of travaille, to don him swete; but that Evere In Mesurable hete he schal be; this vertw hath his bon ful Sekerle, Whereoffen the ton sckale of the handele it is, As I haue ?ow told with-Owten Mys. The tothir Skale is Of A fysch of the Se, That In Ewfrate most wont is forto be; And In Othir water Is it non, but only In Ewfrate Al Alon. ‚ÄòTortenavs‚Äô is the Name Of this fysch, As we it Mown Sownen In Englysch. And his bones of these strengthe ben, As Me declaren here schole ?e sen; For As long As Ony man it hath On honde‚Äî I do ?ow ful wel forto vndirstonde‚Äî that nethir of ioye ne of sorwe schal he have In Mende, but onlich Of that bon, swich is the kende; and whanne Owt his hond it is I-don, To his kende Memorie Cometh he Anon As Owhte forto ben In A kendly man. Lo, swich A vertu this bon hath than! behold what vertw Is In these bones tweyne, Where offen the handele is Mad In Certeine! Wheche handele &amp; sckales, I-keuered it was With A Riche Red Cloth In that plas, I-set wel ful of lettres Of Gold, (As he myhte there pleynly behold,) Wheche that Spoken In this degre ful Openly, As he myht wel Se; ‚ÄúI am Merveillous to beholde On A rowe, And ?it moche more Merveillous I Am to knowe; For me Schal neuere man taken On honde‚Äî As I do the Forto vndirstonde,‚Äî be his hand neuere So large &amp; gret, Me schal he not drawen, I the behet; Ne non Man that is Erthly levenge, but Onlich On Man with-Ovten varienge. And he Schal ben the most worthiest, the Most Able, &amp; the Most best, that Euere was him before, And schal passen Alle √æat is bore, Of prowesse and of konnenge, Of alle tho that to-forn him weren levenge, O√æer Evere Scholen ben In tyme Comenge; Swich Schal his strengthe ben &amp; his konnenge.‚Äù and thus the lettres of the handelyng spak To this Sire Nasciens with-Owten lak. and whanne Sire Nasciens beheld al this, Ful Sore he was Astoned with-Owten Mis; and Merveilled ful Mochel In his thowht In what Manere these lettres weren wrowht; And what they weren forto Mene, In his herte he Merveilled be-dene. thanne beheld he the blad of √æ? swerd that so drawen lay, As to-fore ?e han herd; And there-vppon loked he wonder faste, And Rede lettre he Aspide √æat Onne atte laste, Wheche weren As Red as Any Blood; thus him thowhte √æere As he stood. thanne took he this swerd A lytel Ner, And gan to Reden tho lettres In this Maner; thanne Rad he how this Resown Mente As I schal ?ow declaren here presente: It seide that ‚ÄúNeuere man Scholde ben hardy Me Owt forto drawen ful Sekerly, but better thanne Anothir he Mowe fyhte, and more hardiere, &amp; more Of mihte; And hos Otherwise drawe it In ony sted, he schal ben the ferst that schal be ded.‚Äù (and this proved wel Schal ben, As aftir In this Storie here scholen ?e sen.) and whanne Nasciens these lettres hadde Red, he Merveilled him Mochel In that Sted, Most Of Ony Othir thinge that he Sawh sethen the begynneng. And It was on of √æ? thinges most In his talent, that Swerd owt to drawen verament, and Owt of the Sckavberk it forto se, to knowen what Meneng It Myhte be; For the lettres that it seide with-Owte, ?af Nasciens Most Talent with-Owten dowte. thanne Nasciens beheld the Sckawberk tho, that for Merveille he Niste what to do; And for Al that he Cowde be-holde, Benethen, O√æer Aboven, In Ony folde, and ?it Nethir In herte, Mynde, ne thowht, he ne Cowde not weten where-offen it was wrowht; but wel he wiste it was Al so Red, and As Ony Red Rose In that sted; Where-aboven weren lettres of gold, As he gan there to be-hold; Euere On Of Gold, Anothir Of Asure; thus weren they set, I the Ensure. And A thowsend braunches on this schawberk were, (Whiche was so Riche, As I Rehersed ?ow Ere,) that issweden Owt from that Onle, that Most Merveillous thing it was to se; For Of so fowl Mater they were, and therto So powre In √æat plase there, And as of spittynges and Caytyvetes, Of febelnesses, of filthes, in many degres, that bothe be Semblaunt &amp; Countenaunce It was to hym gret dowtaunce: For An Our the swerd it myhte not Sosteine, So feble it was, him thowhte Certeine. And the lettres that On sckawberke were, In this Maner Seiden they there; ‚Äúhos that Me vppon him doth bere, Ful Sewr he Schal ben Euery where; And more hardy therto schal he be thanne Ony O√æer man In his degre. ?if he bere me In that Manere as the lettres Of √æ? swerd Rehersed Ere. For what man that Abowtes him bereth Me, he ne schal neuere ben schamed In non degre as longe as with these braw[n]ches he is gert, and that On his body I hange Ouerthwert. but that neuere non be so hardy that the Raunges that here ben to don Awey; for him schal happen Manie Misaventure And Manye Evel dedes, I the Ensure, that he, ne non Man levenge, Of him schal tellen non Amendynge; Ne behoten neuere schal be to Man So hard as to him Schal be than that now Is, ne that Neuere schal be, but ?if In sauf Ostag he be Sekerle; And ?it him be-hoveth to ben Osteyed In the Manere as here Is seide, Wheche sholde ben be A wommannes hond, bothe kynges dowhter &amp; qweene, I vndirstond. this womman be √æ?

And whanne he tornede, &amp; it be-held, For discomfort he ne Myhte hym weld; For to him it semede tho As Red As blood; and √æervppon wondirful lettres there stood, that As Ony Cole so blak they were, the Resoun that was I-weten there; Wheche lettres Seiden In that Stede, As that tyme I Cowde hem Rede: ‚Äúhos that Me preiseth most here, Most Schal I him fynde In O√æer Manere, So that In gret Nede blamed schal he not be In non wise, As I telle it the. and to hym to whom I scholde ben Most debonayre, To him with most Anger I wele Repeire: Which schal be-happe but Ony[s], Sekerly, As I the telle here now Openly: For with-Owten faille so moste it be At that tyme Onys ful Sikerle.‚Äù Swiche wordis seide the lettrure there that on √æ? swerd weren wreten In that manere. and the Skavberk he be-held Agein: than merveilled he gretly In Certein, For that partye was non Othir I-liche, but to his Sihte As blak As Ony pich; thanne Abasched he was ful Sore, that he ne wiste what to sein no More, For he ne Cowde demen of what kynde, Ne nether to purposen In his Mynde; but As him thowhte there be Resoun, Aftir A maner of tre was the facioun; and O√æer whille him thowhte √æat it was Of lether I-mad In that plas, but he ne Cowde devise In non degre Of what Maner Of Beste it Myhte be; Anothir tyme him thouhte Of yrne it was, Owthir of sum O√æer Metal In that plas: Thus wolde he han declared it be him selve; but ?it Cowde he not putten the Ex In √æ? helve. Thus doth Nasciens with gret Entencioun; but Ay he is In ful gret Trebulacioun, For the Skawberk to haven Offe knowenge, but he ne Cowde for non manere thinge, O√æer Whille to On thing In Certeinte, And √æerwhille to Anothir; but it wolde not be. thus nethir the swerd hondel, ne pomel, Ne Cowde he declaren Neuere A del; Where-Offen the swerd I-forged was, And whens it Cam, &amp; from what plas, Ne ho that the Swerd schold thedir bringe, he ne cowde not weten for non thinge; Nether the strengthe of that schethe √æere he ne Cowde declaren it In non Manere, Ne not devisen of what kynd it was he ne Cowde for non Maner of Cas, Ne√æer of the grete Merveilles that ben comenge In diuers Reawmes with-Owten varyenge; And of the grete Breteyne Also, What Merveilles that schal Comen hire to: Of Alle these thinges that to forn Rehersed be, this Storye ?it declareth not Sekerle. but whanne that tyme Cometh therto, That declareng of √æ? swerd we scholen gon to; Thanne schal that swerd be knowen ful wel, And the propre Name there Offen Everidel, And the lettres that vppon the schethe be, thanne scholen they ben knowen Openle. For whanne that Cometh bothe tyme &amp; day, Al this schal ben declared sauns delay, the kynde of the Swerd, and schethe also, And Alle the vertwes that longen therto. thanne Openly I-schewed scholen they be, Lik as this holy Storie telleth Certeinle. Now beleveth this Storye here Of the Swerd and the schethe, In this Manere; and Speketh here of Anothir Entent that Oppon the Bed was verament: A spyndele was there schoten forth Ryht thorwh the bordis Of the bed, I the plyht; and Anothir Spyndele Ouerthwert was √æere do, that bothen to-Gederis metten they tho; and bothe Spindelis, As long they were As lengthe &amp; brede of √æ? bed Everywhere. And to the hed Of the two spyndelis certein Ano√æer spyndele was Ioyned, I sey ?ow pleyn; Of these thre, ful Mochel there is to schewe, Of manie diuers poyntes vppon A Rewe. but now this Storye telleth here, that the ferste spyndle was In Alle Manere, was Also whit As ony snow snewenge; And the laste was as Red as blood bledenge; And the ouerth-wert that Aboven was, lik to An Emerawde In that plas; As Grene As An Emeraude it was there To his Syhte In Al Manere: Of these thre Colowres Sekerlye Weren these iij spindelis trewelye, that with-owten Naturel peyntyng were, but Offe here Owne kynde Alle there; For nether be Erthly man ne wommane thedyr ne weren they now browht thanne. And for As mochel as to the peple it is dowtaunce, but declareng √æere-onne be with-owten variaunce, And but √æere-offen they knewen more vndirstondeng, Elles wolden they holden it for A gabbyng, There-fore here turneth this Storye, and of Anothir thing Maketh Memorye that is ful swete forto here, bothe forto lestene &amp; ek to lere; And In tyme Comeng, this Storye the thre spyndelis schal declaren Openlye, And Of the Schipe Al the knowlechinge, Alle this Scholen ?e knowen In tyme Comenge. CHAPTER XXIX. Thus be Aventure As gan be-falle, that Eve the ferst womman of Alle, that the ferst Synne Evere wrowhte, wherthorwh mankynde was browht to Nowhte be the Cownseyl Of the moste dedly Enemy, wheche was the devel, ful Sekerly, that Envie hadde to Mankynde Anon For he In paradis was So I-don. Thanne bethowhte him the devel In haste how he myhte hem of paradis Owt Caste, that dide he Al hys fowl konnenge, Adam &amp; Eve Owt of paradis to bringe, And fondede to Eve there forto gon, To Maken here to Eten of that tre Anon which sche was forboden Ouer all thing Only of that tre the Neygheng, Wheche sche was forboden of hire Creatoure, that tre forto Neyghen In non Oure. to wheche tre the devel hire tempted faste, tyl that Eve A branch kawhte Atte laste, and there-Offen An Apelle Anon sche took, and there-Onne sche gan ful faste to look; thanne there Offen sche bot anon, and faste to hire spowse ward sche gan to gon, and Conceilled him there-Offen to Ete, &amp; that for non thing he scholde it lete. So Adam Ete that Appel Anon, To his grete peyne, and Owre distroccioun. Whanne Eve had him taken this appel, I vndirstond, ?it lefte the braunch Stille In hire hond; but it was A?ens hire knowenge that the braunch In hire hond was Abydinge. thanne whanne they hadden Eten of this tre‚Äî Wheche dedly froyt wel clepid May be, For there thorwgh dedlich becam he tho, and alle that Euere Aftir from him gonnen go;‚Äî thanne knew they wel that Naked they were; to-forn hem thowhte Spiritwel In Alle Manere, For they weren formed to Everelasting lif; but that fowle Synne browhte vs Alle In Strif. And whanne hem Self they gonne beholde, Aschamed they weren ful Many folde; For Al Naked knewen they √æat they were, And Aschamed Ech Of O√æer Membres was there; &amp; with here hondis they kouerided hem tho; So dyde there Eve thanne Also, And the braunch Euere stille In hire hond, but that Cowde sche not tho vndirstond. Thanne he whiche Alle thowhtes doth knowe, To hem Cam there In A throwe, and knew here Synneng Everydel, Wheche was to hem A sory Mel. There ferst Adam he gan to Calle, that him thowhte most Resoun of Alle that Ferst Chalanged that he were, thanne the womman In Ony Manere; For the womman is of so feble Complexioun that of Mannes Rib was mad, As Axeth Resoun, and that Obeischawnt scholde be to Man; Wherfore Crist ferst clepid Adam than. And whanne god hadde Reproved him of his synne, thanne to him he seide, &amp; nolde not blynne, ‚Äúthy bred In Swetyng shalt thow Ete; thy liflode with travaille shalt thou gete; And for thi wif In feleschepe with the was tho, With the, compenie to be, schal she go;‚Äù and Seide to hire, ‚Äúthat In Sorwe &amp; gret drede hire lif in Erthe Scholde sche lede, And In gret peyne to beren hire pariture; Of this Eve thow schalt ben Seure.‚Äù thanne Owt of paradys weren they bothe Caste, And be An Aungel owt dreven Atte laste, Wheche is clepid ‚Äòparadys of delyt,‚Äô there-offen weren they sone bothe qwyt; And Evere, As √æat I vndirstond, held stille Eve √æ? braunch In hire hond, and ne left it neuere for non thing; And ?it was it not be hire wetyng. thanne Atte laste sche gan beholde Vppon this Braunch ful Manifolde, and Evere lich Grene it was, As ferst sche it polde Owt of √æ? plas. Anon wiste sche thanne certeinly that they hadden Synned tho dedly, and that it was cawse of here disheritaunce; Wherfore that braunch kept sche In remembraunce, and that she wolde it putten In swich A plase Often tymes to sen it, In hire fase, there-offen forto haven ful Remembryng that sche was Cause of here disherytyng. thanne bethowhte sche hire on this Manere, that nothing had sche to putten it In there, Nethir huchche ne non O√æer thing, For that tyme was non swich In Makyng; So thanne this braunch took sche Anon Ryhte, And there In the Erthe Anon sche it pyhte. thanne seide sche ‚Äò√æat often scholde sche it sen, For In hire face Ay scholde it ben.‚Äô And whanne this Braunch In the Erthe don was, Anon it wax, &amp; Roted be goddis gras. This brawnch that Eve the ferste Synnere Owt of paradys browht with here there, Signefied ful Mochel gladnesse In tyme Comeng, And Ek lyhtnesse. And ?it al this tyme was Eve A Clene Maide, As this storie doth preve; And thanne sche seide ‚Äúdismaie ?ow nouht; for they out of Oure Eritage we ben browht, ?it for Evere han we it not lost, but therto A?en Restoren we most.‚Äù And ?if ?e welen E[n]qweren of this storie What the Cause was, &amp; the Skele ‚Äòwhye that Man the Braunche Owt of paradis not bar, As wel as the womman dide tho thar, Sethen that man is Of heighere degre than is the Woman ful Sekerle;‚Äô To this answerith this Storye, and seith ‚Äòthat to √æ? Man It belongeth not trewlye, but Al only to the womman that Owt of paradis brouht it than: It signefieth that √æ? womman Owt it browhte, that be womman the world was brouht to nowhte; and be A womman Restored schal it be; wheche signefiet be √æ? blessed virgine Maree.‚Äô Lo Now torneth the Storye here ful pleyn to groweng of this braunch Anon here ageyn; and how it Molteplyed So hugely that a gret tre it wax trewly, and gan to brawnchen &amp; schadwen ful fere; and this was with-Inne riht fewe ?ere. bothe braunches, leves, and bark, as I telle ?ow, Was Also whit As ony snow; Whiche that signefyeth virgenite, that this vertu hath ful Sekerle, a mannes body it kepeth Clene, and the sowle whit al be-dene. For In as moche as that √æ? tre whit was, It signefieth virginite in that plas; For virgine sche was whanne sche it sette; thus Recordeth the Storye with-Owten lette; for ?it At that tyme clene virgine sche was from Alle thowhtes of lecherie In that plas. but Maydenhod and virginite Ne ben not bothe In on degre; but gret defferense betwene hem Is, as ?e scholen heren with-Owten Mis. For Maydenhod In non degre Nis not lik to virginite; and I schal ?ow telle the Resown why; For Maydenhod is In this maner trewly, that felte neuere man fleschly, ne√æer In weye of lecherie lay hire by. but virginite is An heighere thing, And More vertwos to thin vndirstondyng: For bothe Man &amp; Womman that virgines be, Ne thowhte neuere Amys In non degre of Bodily lust to ony luxure: this is virginite bothe good &amp; pure. and thus was Eve In Clene virginite Whanne Owt Of paradis Cast was sche; and ?it the same Our sche plaunted this braunch, Virginite with-Inne here was ful staunch. but Aftir Crist Comanded to Adam Anon that ‚Äòto his wif there scholde he gon, and here to knowen there fleschly, As Man And Womman Scholde trewely‚Äô; thanne loste sche Anon virginite thorw desireng of lust, sekerle. and whanne Adam &amp; Eve thus hadden I-do, and fleschly to-Gederis knewen they tho, thenne Maden they bothe ful Mochel Mornenge Vndir this tre, bothe lementacion &amp; wepinge. and whanne that Adam In his herte gan devise his Exyleng Owt of paradise, Ful hevy Chere Ech other gan to Make, And Eche was Sory for Otheris Sake. thanne Seide Eve to Adam tho, ‚ÄúSire, ne merveille ?e not so gretly so; For non wondir it nys In non Manere thowh Owre trespas [we] Remembren here; For ther may non Abiden vndir this tre‚Äî thowh glad &amp; Joyful that he be,‚Äî but ?if In Moroneng he parte Away;‚Äî Sire, it were wondir, I ?ow Say;‚Äî For the tre of deth this May wel be, as Myn herte Remembreth now me, whiche tre that we resten vndir, Vs Maketh so hevy, it nis non wondire.‚Äù Anon As sche hadde this word I-spoke, Abowtes hem faste they gonne to loke; A vois than herden they with here Ere, That In this Manere to hem Seide there; ‚ÄúSey, ?e Caytives, why demen ?e so Ech Otheris deth, as ?e now do? Ne deme ?e no more in swich degre Of disperaunce, I warne ?ow Certeinle; but Comforte ?ow In All wise Ech o√æer, As ?e best Connen devise; For the lif Is to ?ow moche Nerre Iustly thanne Ony deth Certeinly.‚Äù Thus Spak the vois to hem riht tho; thanne mochel Comfort they token hem to. thanne Aftirward Clepid they that tre ‚Äòthe tre of lyf,‚Äô ful Sikerle; For the goode Comforte √æat √æere-ondir hadden they there, ‚Äòthe tre of lif‚Äô they clepid it Every where. and for the Ioye they hadden of this tre, Many brawnches they plauntid √æere-offen Sekerlye; and As sone As it was Set In the grownde, bothe it took &amp; Roted with-Inne A stownde; and In Alle degre it kepte the Colowr, As it was the wyl Of Oure Savyowr. than often tymes it be-happed So, that vndir theke tre gonnen they go, hem forto Resten ful often Sithe, whiche Mad hem bothe glad &amp; blythe. So that it happid vppon a day, that Adam with Eve with-Owten delay Seten to-gederis bothe tweyne,‚Äî thus √æis holy Storie Reporteth Certeine, that vppon A fryday it happede so that vndir theke tre bothe gonnen they go,‚Äî and longe there gonne they hem Reste til A vois there Cam √æat Sowned be Este, Whiche vois Seide to hem verraily, ‚Äòthat Adam his wif Scholde knowen fleschly.‚Äô thanne So Achamed bothe they were, Swich Manere of thing forto don there, that Nethir of hem On Othir dorst loke that dede to don, so seith this boke; For as sore Aschamed √æ? Man was there As the womman In Alle Manere, For they Nesten thanne In non degre how here Lordis Comaundement sckapen scholden hee; and for be encheson of √æ? ferst trespas, they dradden hem of here lordis Gras; and so Rewfully Ech on O√æer loked than For gret schame, bothe man &amp; womman. thanne beheld Iesus, Owre worthy lord, here Schamefullest &amp; drede be here Owun Acord, that God In hem Anon hadde gret pite For here Schamfastnesse In that degre; And, for his wille distorbeled ne schold not be, For hem he disposede ful worthile, that be hem two the lygne of Man the tenthe Order of Awngelis Restore scholde than, that Owt of hevene weren Cast Adown for pride Into helle, that lowe doniown. And therfore A?ens here schame Comfort he sent to hem bothe there Anon presente; and, Al here Schame-fastnesse forto hyde, In Maner of A Nyht God sent hem that tyde, that So Mirk it was with hem there that non myhte Other sen In non Manere. thanne Abasched weren they wondir Sore how √æat so sodeinly that dirknesse Cam thore. thus sone the ton the tother gan to Callen tho, and to-Gyderis they felten thanne bothe two there with-Owten sighte Of Ony day, thus to-gederis knewen they with-owten delay. For it behoveth that Alle thing be do Aftir goddis wille; he wele √æat it be So; and that tyme Ech Other fleschly gan to knowe, Only goddys Comandement forto Avowe; So that there, thorwh here Comownenge, Seed forth browhte to here Synnes Aleggynge. For there thoruhe hem bothe was conceyved than Whiche that me Clepid Abel, that Rihtwis man, and the ferste man that to his god dide worthy Servise, him to worschepen &amp; plesen In Alle wyse. In this Manere was Abel vnder the tre of lyf be-geten of Adam, Conceyved of his wif; Wheche was don vppon a fryday, As this Storye thus doth here Say. thanne there behelden they bothe Anon that thus sone this dirknesse was gon; thanne knewen they wel ful verraylly, that God it dyde ful specyaly Forto hyden here Schame-fastnesse, Where-thorwgh they weren bothe In distresse. and Anon A gret Merveille to hem √æere was, that God there schewede In that plas; For As grene be-Cam √æ? tre In that stede As Evere dyde Gras In ony Mede; And so diden Alle that Out of √æat tre gonne gon, Aftyr that Adam and Eve so hadden I-don; bothen bark, bowh, Ek lef, and tre, From whit to Grene I-torned they be. thanne Anon Aftyr Evene Ryht There This tre flowres &amp; froyt began to bere; and whiles √æat Tre &amp; braunches weren white Echon, thanne nethir flowres ne froyt ne bar it non; but Aftir that it was woxen Grene, It bar bothe flowres &amp; froyt Alle be-dene. For the whitnesse of theke tre Only betokeneth virginite; but whanne Virginite was Agon, thanne be-Cam √æis tre Grene Anon; Wheche that signefieth √æ? seed of Manne that vnder thike tre was Conserved thanne, that Chast and trewe was to his Creatour, and In Alle tymes dyde him honour; and the froyt of that tre doth Signefie that Evere he was Religious Sothfastlye. Thus Contenued ful longe this Tre there, So that Evere was grene, &amp; In on Manere, tyl that Abel was woxen wel of Age, and to his god did moche Servage; And Euere deboneure to his Creatour he was, ?eldenge him that his was In Every plas, As wel of tithes, As of Offrenge; thus to his god dide he worschepinge; and of the best thing that his were, he offrede to God In Ech Manere. but Cayn his brothir ne dide not so; For Evere of his werste took he tho, and to God there-Offen made his Offring, Swich as that to Cayn was fowlest thing. Lo, and God to hym sente As gret plente As to his brother Abel; thus √æ? storie scheweth me. So whanne they comen bothe In-to the plase that for Sacrefyenge be God Ordeyned was; and for to maken there here offrenge, bothe Cayn &amp; Abel weren thedyr Comenge, lyk as it was be Goddis Comandement Thedir Comen they bothe verament. and whanne Abel his Sacrefyse gan to do, Streyht vp-ward to hevene thanne gan it go; but Cayines Offreng In that Stede, the fwme spred Abowtes al the Mede, Which was bothe blak, fowl, &amp; stynkkenge; thus was the Maner of Cayines Offrenge. and thike that of abelis offring was, was Cler &amp; swete smellyng In that plas. and whanne Cayin beheld this Manere, that abelis Offreng Resceived was so there passinge his In alle degre, therto gret Envye Anon had he, and gret wraththe A?ens his brothir took, that God Abelis Resceyvede, and his forsook. thanne Cayin bethouhte him sone Anon In what wyse Abel he myht vengen him on: thanne to him Self he seide tho, ‚Äòthat Sekerly his brothir wolde he slo, So best on Abel avenged Myhte he be;‚Äô thus thowhte Cayin In his Memore. Thus bar longe Cayin this fowl Envye to his brothir abel Gyltleslye; ?it perceyved abel neuere Chere ne Contenaunce that Cayin him thouhte Ony Grevaunce. So longe Cayin helede this haterede In his herte, that ilke fowle stede, tyl that it happed vppon a day that Abel gan to walken, as I ?ow say; For Owt of his fadris Syhte tho Gan this abel thanne forto go, tyl that he Cam to the tre of lif, For there wenten his schepe with-owten strif. the day gan wexen hot ful faste, and of the sonne strong hete In haste, So that strong [hete] not suffren myhte he, but wente to schadwen him vndir that tre; So that gret lust Cam him √æere vppon that Nedis moste he Slepen anon, and so vndir this tre he gan him leye‚Äî as now that me ?e heren Seye,‚Äî and to slomberen he gan there Anon. thanne Gan Cayin forth to gon, that longe hadde thowht √æis felonye: there abel his brothir he gan aspye. thanne beheld Cayin √æat selve day Where abel his bro√æer vndir √æ? tre lay, and faste hin hyede forto sle, &amp; wende Aparceyved it schold not han be. but Abel ful wel sawh him comen tho, &amp; vp him dressed, and A?ens him gan go,‚Äî For he him lovede wondirly wel as it was √æere sene Everidel;‚Äî and seide, ‚Äúwelcome, my brother dere, I am ful glad we ben In fere:‚Äù and Evene In this manere of gretyng spak Abel to Cayin At here Metyng. Anon this Cayin there to him Ran, and A op-Courbed knyf he drowh out than, and vndir the pappe smot him Anon Also fer as the knyf wolde gon. and thus abel Anon ded was there Of his vntrewe brotheris hond In √æis manere. lo, In the same stede that he Conceyved was Of his Modir, In that plas Suffrede he his deth with vnriht, As was be the Suffraunce of god Almyht. And Evene lik In the same Manere as on the Fryday he was begeten there, Lik So vppon a fryday be Cayin was he ded, as this holy storye Recordith In this sted. Lo, whanne √æat abel suffrede deth be trasown, In Al thys World ne weren but thre men In-virown! behold how that the deth of Rihtwas Abel Is likned to Cristes deth Everydel! Be Cayin signefyed was Iwdas, the falsest Tretour that Evere was. For lik As Cayin his brothir gan to heylle, So dide Iudas to Crist Sawn faille; So that these tweyne dethes Acorden wel As be fals tresown Everydel; and As Abel vppon A fryday was slayn, So be tresown was Iesus In Certayn. So that Iudas In alle Manere To Cayin Is likned Everywhere; For Iudas hadde non Maner Enchesown To don his lord to √æat distroctiown, For to him myhte he han non haterede For Owht that Jesus dyde In Ony dede; and for he say neuere In him but goodnesse, ther-fore was he ful Of Irfulnesse; For it is √æ? Condisciown Of A cursed Man To haten A good Man, what that he Can. and Of the tresown √æat Cayin to his brothir hath do, Spekith Jesus Crist, and of Many Mo, be kyng davy In the Sawter book‚Äî ho that there-after wile there-Inne look;‚Äî That A dredful word now speketh there that thus Seith, and In this Manere, ‚Äòthow purposist, &amp; seist fals felonye to thy brothir, &amp; seist al trechorye; and to thin Owne Modris sone swich tretories thou dost As is thy wone; Wherfore I schal the Chastise, and the pvnschen In hard wise.‚Äô and thus In the Sawter schole ?e it fynde of dauid his enditenge, kyng good &amp; kynde. thanne oure lord, Cayin gan to Calle Aftir this dede thus was befalle, and seide, ‚ÄúKayin, where is thy brother Abel, that to the trespased neuere A del?‚Äù Whanne that kayin vndirstood Al this, that he hadde So fowle don Amys, and that so gret tresoun he hadde I-wrowht, Anon it tornede than In his thowht, and kouered Abel with the leves of √æ? tre That Aspyd ne schold not than be. thanne Axede him Owre lord Ageyn, ‚ÄúCayin, where is thy brothir, sey me pleyn.‚Äù thanne Kayin Answerid A?en Anone, ‚ÄúWith him have I not for to done; For I ne haue hym not In kepinge, Ne√æer of him I ne Can tellen non tydynge.‚Äù thanne Answerid Oure lord to hym ful sone, ‚Äúthat fowle dede that thow hast done, and slayn thyn Brothir So falslye, Aforn Me veniaunce his blood doth Crye. therfore Acursed schalt thow be thorwh-Owt Alle the Erthe ful sikerle, and the Erthe, A-corsed I wel it be do, that thy brotheris blood hath Resceyved so.‚Äù thus Crist the Erthe Cursed there; but not the tre In non Manere Where-vndir that Abel was ded, he it not Cursede In non sted. but A wondir Merveille of that tre Wondirly befel, hos myhte it se: For Anon As Abel there-vndir was Slayn, his Grene Colour it torned Anon Certayn, And becam As Red as ony blood, that same tre, there as it stood, In remembranse Of hym that ded was there, holy Abel In swich A Manere. and alle his plawntes that Abowtes him were, deyden Anon In Schort Manere; but that tre Grew so Merveillously, that the fayrest tre it be-Cam trewly that Evere man Myhte beholde with Eye; So ful of Bewte this tre was Sekerlye, Ne Neuere chonged ne peyred nowht there Sethen Abel was √æer-vndir ded, In non Manere, Saufe that flowr ne froyt ne bar it neuere non Sethen there-vndir that fowle dede was don. but tho that of him weren I-set to-forn, bothe flowres and froit of hem ben born; and so these Trees gonnen to Multiplye, and the world Encresid ful plentevouslye, So alle that of Adam &amp; Eve Comen tho, To that tre ful Moche Reuerence they do; and Eche of hem Other doth telle In what Manere that it befelle, ‚ÄòThat how here ferste Modir it plaw[n]ted there, and how thedir it cam, &amp; In what Manere; and they Scholden Restoren agayn here ferste Eritage In Certeyn, Where-Owt here ferste Modir was Cast, but A?en we scholen it haven Atte laste.‚Äô and whanne they weren In Ony disseise, That Ony thing here hertes dide Misplese, and Anon to √æat blessed tre they wente, here Conceil to taken veramente; whanne that to theke tre they Comen Anon, Comforted they weren thanne Everichon; and Sethen they Clepeden it ‚Äò√æ? tre of Consaile And the Tre of Comfort‚Äô with-Owten faile. This tre Grew &amp; wex ful faste, and alle that Euere of him Comen Atte laste, bothe that weren of √æ?

For it was Goddis wille tho that the world distroyed scholde be so, Sauf only hem that god trewe fond Aforn Alle Othere, I vndirstond; and be hem the world Restored Schold be, that to-forn tyme was lost In swiche degre. but wete ?e wel for Certeyn, thowh tho trees to here kynde comen Ageyn, ?it boren they neuere Aftyr so kendly As to fore tymes they dyden vtterly, that they ne losten Clene √æ?

CHAPTER XXX. Thus longe durede this ilke tre, Of Colour, of Savour, and of Bewte, Tyl that Salamon Regnede than Aftir king david his fadir, √æat holy Man. To wheche Salamon Only Crist Sente Manie passing konnenges aftir hese Entente; he sente him more wit &amp; discressiown In his lyve Thanne ony wit of Erthly man cowde discrive; For of Alle Scienses he was konnenge, Where-offen the peple hadd merveillynge. For he was konnenge In precious stones, and knew al here vertwes for the nones; and the strengthe of herbes he knew also, And what ther-with he myhte wel do. he knew the Cors of the firmament, And of alle the sterres √æere-onne, verament, So that there nas neuere non Erthly man That non discressiovn to him ne kan; ?it Neuertheles, be bewte of a womman Ouertaken and disceyved was he than, So that he wrowhte A?ens Goddis wille, that of Sum thinges he dide ful Ille. This womman that with Salamon was, be-thowhte hire in Many diuers Cas hym to disceyve, and be?ondis him go, with Alle the deceites sche Cowde do. Where-offen ful lytel wondir it is; For there nys non Man that lyveth I-wys that offen Owhten forto Merveille, a?ens A wommans wile with-Owten faille; For there sche putteth hire Engyn &amp; hire Entent, that wit of non liveng Man verament Schal hire withstonde of hire Concettyng: tak kepe of √æ? ferst womman that Evere was lyveng. Whanne Salamon Sawh that in non degre To withstonden hire Engyn It nolde not be‚Äî Where-offen he gan to Merveillen Anon, and wax Right wroth, and forth gan gon‚Äî thanne Anon his book he spak that to him was with-Owten lak, Wheche that ‚Äòparables‚Äô he Calde the Name, To him A book of ful gret fame: ‚ÄúWith this Book I have Sircvit √æ? world Abowte, that there is non Erthly Man with-Owten dowte that to serchen Abowtes the woerld In-virown, Onnethes there-Inne to fynde, be good Resown, On good womman to his Supposing.‚Äù And thus Seide he for A wondir thing, For he ne Cowde In non Manere From wyles of his wif to kepen him there; So that he Merveilled In Alle degre That so Manie wyles In A womman scholde be, so that he gan dispisen hem ful faste, and of hem [seide] mochel Evel Atte laste, And of Speritwel thinges neuere they Come, but Of Enmyte Al &amp; some. As vppon A nyht In his bed he lay, thvs to him self he gan to say,‚Äî Ful thowhtful he was &amp; ful Mornenge, that thus to him self he made pleynenge,‚Äî ‚Äúthow man Caytyf, ful of disseise, why nisse ther non thing that the May plese? Why Merveillest thow so Moche of wommans wile, that the hass distorbled with-Inne A while, and In Sorwe and Errour hath put the?

But the Cristene owht not forto don so; but As A myhty Bole they scholden do, that is Sekir of Fote And of fundement, whanne that he is asaylled of his Enymyes present; Ryht so stedfastlych In Alle Manere Scholde Evere Cristen Man lyven here; And stedfastly beleven In holichirche, And there-Inne Alle goode werkys to wirche, Forto defenden hem with strengthe &amp; Myht A?ens that Enemy that, bothe day &amp; nyht, doth what he Can hem forto withdrawe bothe from god &amp; from holy Chirche lawe. And therfore I Rede now Every Man to fownden him In the fadir, what that he kan, the wheche is Crist, Goddis Sone of hevene, that Into therthe discended with Mylde stevene. ‚ÄúAnd lik As the Schipe, Ordeyned it was thorwh the See to Gon In Every plas, And with-Owten peryl to Comen to londe; So Is holy Chirche, as √æat I vndirstonde, For to Susteyne the Cristene In this world here, That they ne perschen not In non Manere. ‚Äúbe the Schipe vndirstonde thow holy Chirche; And be the See, the world, ?if √æou wilt wirche. And lyk As the Schipe thorwgh the See Saveth the Men that there Inne be From Alle Maneres perilles of here Body, lik So doth holy Chirche ful trewely; Evere Goddis Servauntes doth he kepe, whethir that they waken other Slepe, From Alle Maner of dedly Synne, That Non Schal Entren hem with-Inne. For holy Chirche povrgeth Also Clene Alle Manere of goddis Servauntes bedene, lik As the Gold Resceyveth his Clernesse be Sevene weyes In Sekernesse, Wheche that Maken hym to Schyne So bryht Aboven Alle O√æer Metales that ben more lyht; And lik As the Sonne passeth the sterre, So doth gold Alle Metales bothe Ny &amp; ferre. ‚ÄúNow of the Schip I haue the told the signifiaunce; And now of the bed I wele with-Owten variaunce. the Bed Signefyeth In Certein the holy table, I sey the ful pleyn, where that Every day Goddis sone of hevene Is Onne I-Sacred with ful Mylde Stevene; Where that the wyn Is I-torned blood Red, And the bred to verray flesch In that Sted, be the vertu of the holy wordys there that the blessed man Seyth In his Manere. So be this Schalt thou vndirstonde the cros that Crist was on Crucified In Ivrie londe, Where onne I-Sacred that he was, and Made Redempcioun In that plas, Mannes Sowle to byen from helle,‚Äî The develis powste forto felle,‚Äî Whiche Every day to forn his ded Wenten to helle, that fowl√´ Sted. ‚ÄúAlso ?it myhtest thou vndirstondyn More be the Bed what it is to Signefye thore, A thing that Mad is on forto Reste Whanne Crist had Suffred deth, As hym liked beste.

Now of the thre Spyndelis wil y fonde, Owther braunches, whethir ?e welen vndirstonde;‚Äî For, with-Owten gret Tokenyng, Abowtes that bed Envirownenge was not don, wel myhtes thou wete, As I schal the Openly declaren itte,‚Äî Of wheche on was whit, Ano√æer was Red, the thridde was grene In that Sted: what the Signefyaunce is of these thre, Schortely I wele it declaren to the. ‚ÄúFerst, be the whit thou schalt vndirstonde, Whanne Crist Cam ferst In to Erthly londe, he Cam Only In virgenite, And Into the blessid virgine so Entred he; And hire virginite ne dide Neuere schende, but Clene virgine Abideth with-owten Ende. For Into hire bosom he Entred As Clos As A ?ate is schet √æer that no man In gos; And As holyche he Isswede Ageyn, And Euere the ?ate clos schyt In Certein. So this betokeneth virginite In Alle degres, As thou myht se. ‚ÄúThe Rede braunch that vppon that bed lay, which of his owne kynde is profay, therby schalt thou vndirstonden charite, In Crist that So lowliche wolde be, that bowed his body to passiown, For Mannes Sowle to maken Redempcioun. behold, swich lownesse he schewed √æere! and the grettest ?ifte for man In ony Manere ?af Crist there! his Owne Body, the wheche that is lyf Euere lastyngly. lo, hire Charite myhtest √æou vndirstonde, whanne that In dedly flesch he hym wond In the welle of Charite and of pite; lo, thus dyde Crist for love of the! ‚ÄúBe the tothir Spyndele that grene was, wheche On the bed was In that plas, that to An EMeraude I-figured it Is,‚Äî The wheche that to paciense with-owten Mys Is the Semblaunce Of that ston, As men it knowen ful Manyon; the wheche Emeraude is Evere Grene, lik so is paciense with Owten wene; the wheche may neuere ben taken Away For non deseisse, I dar wel Say, Nethir for non Maner Adversite, ?if In A Cristen Mannes herte I-grounded it be. For be pacyense schalt thow han victorye, And with paciense discomfit thyn Enemye; For there as paciense I-herberwed he ys, There is Evere victorye with Owten Mys. For thouhe thy Enemy be neuere So wood, and these thre thou wel vndirstood, And kepe hem Sadly In thin herte,‚Äî thanne schal thyn Enemy neuere the Asterte,‚Äî Whiche is ferst virgynite, Meknesse, and thanne Charite; And with these thre Certeinlye was the bed I-couerid sothfastlye, Whiche the verray Cros doth Signefye, On wheche that Crist gan vpon deye; For whanne On the Cros he suffred ded, Alle these thre weren In his Manhed; For As holy writ it doth Certefye, with-Owten these thre was he not Sekerlye; For these three vertwes weren with him there whanne he suffrede deth In Alle Manere; So with virgynyte, Charite and pacyense,‚Äù [He conquerd Death, and bought us bliss intense.] In this Mene while that this good Man Of Alle these thinges to Nasciens spak than, and told hym Al the Signefiaunce of Schipe and bed with-owten variaunce, that plesed to Nasciens So wondirly wel Al that this Man Seide Everydel; For so swete and so delicat his wordis were, that Nasciens fil on Slepe ryht there, And Evere him thowhte, As he lay, that this good man to hym talked Alway. And whanne that he whiche In the vessel was, Sawh Nasciens On Slepe In that plas, thanne thens Anon he gan to hye, And with-Inne A litel while Sekerlye he was thennes A gret Iorne, Ful fer Abrod Into the Se. Whanne this good man was forth gon, And Nasciens Slept stille as a ston, In his sleep he thowhte, be his Entent, that to forn him Cam a gret Serpent, And him Asaillede wonder faste, Tyl that he hurt hym Atte laste, And smot hym sore vndir the lefte syde.

Thus thowhte Nasciens In his Slepinge. And whanne he Awok, with-owten varyenge he was Abascht, And wende Sekerly √æat with the Serpent he hadde fowhten Certeinly; and fully Awaked thanne was he, thanne wiste he wel ful Sekerle that verrayly Aslepe he was thorwh the Swete wordes √æat In that plas that the goode man Seide to him tho, whiche In the vessel was Ago, that he ne Cowde be non-were Aspye In Al the See, nether fer ne Nye. thanne to hym Self he gan to Compleyne, And thus to hym Self he gan to seyne, ‚Äòthat he was bothe A fool &amp; A Caytyf that In sweche degre hath led his lif, So that In his Slepe was taken Away Al that the goodman to hym gan say, And ful lytel of wit thanne was he that this for?at In Alle degre, Of Alle the wordis of this good Man that In the yl to hym seide he than, And In his Sleepe it was from him gon, Onne this word Cowde he tellen non.‚Äô but leve we now of his talkynge, And Celidoyne his sone let vs forth bringe, And tellen forth of his Storye, That to him be-fil ful Certeinlie.

This was the trowthe and the veryte: Whanne Augustus Cesar Emperour was he, The same Our that ypocras to Rome Cam, Mochel Morneng &amp; Sorwe Made Every Man As thowh here Fadrys hadden ben ded To forn hem lyggeng In that Sted. thanne ypocras Abascht hym wondir sore Of the Morneng that he Sawh thore, So that he preyde A lytel Child that to forn hym was bothe Meke and Myld, that he wolde tellen hym the Cawse why Wherfore the peple there was so sory. ‚ÄúNow, Certes,‚Äù quod this Child thanne, ‚ÄúWhy that thus Mornen Alle these Menne,‚Äî It was for A Nevew of the Emperour (Whiche was A persone of gret honour) that ful longe Syk hath be, and now they seyn that ded Is he: and therto he was so fayr and so good That Every man hym lovede with his Mood.

And whanne he hadde thus I-do, the Emperesse to hym gan to go, and Seide, ‚ÄúSire, ful wel thou be! A glad womman hast thou Maked me!

And so scholden they han don for Evere More, Ne hadde on thyng At Rome behapped thore: What it was, I schal now telle, Swich An Aventure hym befelle. Thike tyme whanne ypocras At Rome was, and worschepyd he was In Every plas, It happed so there be Aventure that A fair lady, I the Ensure, Of the partyes of Galele, to the Emperour thedir Cam sche.

And whanne so longe he hadde loked there On, Tyl that the day was Al A-gon, that he Cowde knowen non lettrwre, So dirk it was, I the Ensure; and whanne that lettrure Cowde he knowen non, Into his Bosom he it putte Anon, And A?ens his brest he gan it to leye with Al His Mynde ful Enterelye; And as Faste he gan that writ to hym folde, as the Child of the Modir doth to √æ? pappes holde bothe for pyte and Ek for love, thus dyde he for the good lord above.

And whanne Nasciens hadde told hym Al this, thanne Axede he Of hym with-Owten Mys, ‚ÄòOf what Contre that he was.‚Äô the goodman him answered In that plas, ‚ÄúI am Of swich a Contre that thou neuere Inne Come sekerle, ne Neuere ne schalt in non Manere whiles that thou lyvest here. but of the writ √æat thow hast in honde, loke that thou wel vndirstonde.‚Äù ‚Äúthat schal I, quod Nasciens, with good wille, For √æat myn herte wel mochel falleth vntylle; For whiles that I there-Onne don thinke I ne have non lust ne√æer to Eten ne drynke. but Of ij thinges fayn wold I knowe (?if I Myhte with-Inne A throwe,) whiche Myn herte myhte gretly Ese, And I wiste ?ow Not to mysplese;‚Äù and tolde the goodman Every del, lik as vppon his herte it lay ful wel.

For he is a gret fool with-Owten les, that desireth to knowen his lordis secres More thanne he Owhte forto do: be war, sire Nasciens, do √æou not so.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow trewely, Sire, quod Nasciens Ageyn, ?e sein ful soth, Sire, In Certein.‚Äù ‚ÄúFor this Cause syre Nasciens, I telle it the, that the wysere Evere scholdest thou be, and Also no More to ben so vnkonneng Of thy lordis secrees to han knoweng; Sethen that god Of his gret pete, Of his specyal grace and debonewryte, Hath the schewed be demonstraunce Of alle the lynes Every chawnche, how they scholen happe, and what to be; and ?it me thinketh it pleseth not the, but Evere desirest from day to day hit forto knowen More verray, whiche that Non thing Oweth to the, Sethen that thou art Erthly &amp; Mortalite.

That is ?it now More for to seyn: Of Chevalrye he schal passen Alle his fadris pleyn, bothe of Erthly prowesse, Of bownte, and Of alle godnesse. For a virgyne Evere schal he be alle dayes Of his lyve Certeinle; And the Ende Of him More Merveillous schal be thanne Of Ony O√æer Man Certeynle; For Of Condiscions he schal han non pere Of non Erthly Man lyvenge here.

Now scholen we tornen here Owre storye, and to Flegentyn, Nasciens wyf, scholen we hye. CHAPTER XL. OF FLEGENTYNE'S MEEKNESS, AND HOW SHE HAS THE THREE TOMBS BUILT AND CARVED. Whanne that Nasciens from his Castel was go, Thanne Flegentyne his wyf made mochel wo that he nowgher myhte ben fownde, Nethir fer, nethir Nygh, In non stownde: thanne left sche stylle ful of Morneng, Of Sorwe, and of lewmentyng, as sche that hire lord loved Sovereinly Aboven Alle Creatures √æat weren Erthly; and ?it Neuere for non temptacioun hire herte was Neuere In Mwtacyoun; but Evere As A womman good &amp; Clene hire persecucions suffred, As I wene; And Evere thanked God Of hire trebulacioun, Of hire deseisse and hire persecuciown, and Evere As A womman ful Of Meknesse Sche hire kepte In Al hire distresse; and thowgh In Ioye O√æer In sorwe sche were, For hire lord sche preyde In hire Manere, and for here ?onge sone Also, That God hem kepe from peyne &amp; wo, and that here Sowlis Myhte Comen to blysse; Of this preyere dide sche not Misse. And thus Morned sche Everyday tho For that hyre lord was so Ago, and wisten Neuere whider becomen they were, Into non place, Nethyr Fer ne Nere. and whanne it was toward the Nyht, and Men Of Sarras Comen hom ful Ryht, and non tydynges ne Cowden telle Of hire lord in non wise how it befelle, thanne Moche sorrere Abasched sche was, More thanne to-fore In Ony O√æer plas. thanne grettere sorwe hadde sche with-owten variaunce Othirwyse thanne sche made Offen Semblaunce; and thus Al √æat Nyht In sorwe sche lay Tyl uppon √æ? Morwen it was lyht Of day. On the Morwe Erly, whanne it was lyht, toward the Chirche this lady took hire way Ryht, wheche that hire lord Sire Nasciens Of Godis Modir hadde mad it In reuerens.

Whanne that sche vndirstood Al this tale, how that hire lord was browht In bale, and how Saved he was be goddis Mercy, thanne thydirward faste she gan hyre hy, And took with hire bothe Silvir &amp; Gold To fulfille that hire lord wold. and to that Mowntayng wente Anon there that hire lord the bataille hadde don, And Aftir werkmen sente sche faste Tho thre tombes to Maken In haste; lyk as hire lord devysed hem hadde, The werkmen faste sche maken badde: So that with-Inne thre Month of day they weren Redy dyht; and sche wente hire way.

CHAPTER XLI. HOW JOSEPH AND HIS COMPANIONS CROSS OVER TO BRITAIN ON JOSEPHES'S SHIRT. Now telleth here this Story Anon, That aftir Josephe from Sarras was gon, So that betwene hym and his Compenye Manye Jornes wenten they Sekerlye tyl they weren past the flowm Of Ewfrate, And Manye Othir Jornes bothe Erly and late. And as they wenten, Mochel folk they fownde that hem Arested In that stownde; but Evere god deliuered hem Anon bothe Owt Of Castel and Owt of ston; So that Nyhtes thanne Manyon In Wodes weren they logged Echon, and In Every mannes loggenge Alle Manere Of vyande bothe of Mete and drink; what that here hertes Cowden Axen O√æer Crave, with-Owten dowte Anon they it have. that Nyht lay Josephe with his wyf, A Noble woman to God, and Clene Of lyf; For Of Alle wommen that thike tyme were, Of hire degre hadde sche non pere. Thanne descendid A vois there Anon, and to Josephe there spak thus son, and seide ‚Äúthat the grete Maister √æ? word sent thy wyf fleschly to knowen In good Entente; This Niht Only that thou so do, For it is goddis will that it be so. So that here thorwgh the seed Of the this lond may Repleynsched be: and ?if that it be a knave Chyld, Galaaz thou him Clepe, bothe mek and Myld, For thus Commandeth the grete lord that Alle thing Ordeyneth be his Owne Acord.‚Äù thanne Answerid Josephe there riht Anon, ‚ÄúI am Redy his Comandement to don, but that I am so Feble and so Old that I not how this thing ben schold.‚Äù quod this voys, ‚Äúdismaye the non thing, For thus Moste it be with-Owten varyeng.‚Äù his wyf, Josephe knew that Nyht, and begat Galaaz thorwgh goddis Myht, whiche was A good man, and Clene of lif, and the peple kepte from Mochel stryf; and therto A worthy knyht he was, which was fulfild be goddis gras. So On the Morwe, whanne it was day, Josephe and his Meyne tooken here way there that holy arche it was, And Maden here preyeres In √æat plas; Afore that holy vessel Alle knelynge, they preiden there ful sore wepinge And besowhten Oure lord Of good Cowndyt Ouer that Se to passen ful qwyt Into the lond that was behoten hem, To Alle here Children, and to here stren. Thanne whanne here preyers they hadden I-do, Towardis the Se thanne Gonne they go, And this be-fyl vppon a satirday that be-Nyhgted they weren In fay. and whanne they weren Come to the see, Nethir Galeye ne Schipe ne fownden they sekerle where-Inne they myhten Over see gon. thanne Maden they mone Everichon; and for Sorwe and fol lewmentyng they borsten Alle In Sore wepyng, and preyden Owre lord Of his Socour hem forto senden In that langowr; and for his Mercye &amp; his pyte Sawf to bryngen hem Over the See. and with this they Comen wepyng ful sore alle to Josephes the Bischope thore, ‚ÄúA, Sire bischope, how scholen we do?

And Anon he seide these wordis Milde, ‚ÄúDismaye ?ow not, ne√æer lord lady ne Childe, For he that hath Counveyed vs In Every weye, Ouer this See he wele vs now Conveye. But alle, at this tyme, Cowndeye not he wele; and why, I schal tellen yow the Skele.

Thus hath he ?olden to ?ow his beheste, To Man womman and Child, both lest and Meste. ‚ÄúBut ful Evel Aqwyt hym han ?e For his kendenesse, As ?e scholen Se: Herkeneth me now what I schal say. ‚ÄúWhanne he to ?ow spak ?isterday Atte Entre Of the forest here That Agas is Clepid In Old Manere, and there he warned ?ou genneraly In Chastete to kepen ?ow Only, and Clene In body and In herte, that non vnclennesse ?ow Asterte; Ne not with ?owre wyves forto Melle but be his leve, As I ?ow Spelle; and this promyse Maden ?e, As ?e wel knowen Certeynle: Now, behold how ?e han this holden, ?owre promyses lik as ?e tolden!

Thanne the kyng Al Redy was, and Ek his Meyne In that plas; ‚ÄúSeweth me, he seyde, Echon; for On Owre Enemyes welen we gon.

And swiche Merveilles there he wrowhte that Eche Man Merveilled In his thowhte; So that no man In al that Rowte dorst hym Abyde, swich was here dowte. And whanne the kyng Al this be-held, that Nasciens So Ferde In that Feld, he seide he was non Erthly Man, but As A devel So fawht he than; and Nasciens, that Every Renge he sowhte In that bataille, and not Of hem Rowhte; For he ne dredde for non Man, were he Neuere so hardy than. thus Evere fyhteng vp &amp; down he Rod, So that No man there hym withstood; And Atte laste he Mette with the kyng: and whanne he knew hym be his Armeng, And ok what harmes that he bar, To him faste thanne Rod he thar. Thus Nolde Sire Nasciens him refuse, but faste towardis hym gan he to Muse, And vppon hym sette his hors hed, And towardis him prikyde In that sted. thanne sone to hym Aproched he was, And lefte vpe his swerd In that plas For to han smeten therwith the kyng; For In Nasciens Nas non Abydyng. and whanne the kyng this beheld That he so fawht In the feld, and sawh his swerd Aboven his hed, Anon he fledde In that sted Also faste As he Myhte Ryde, &amp; Nasciens Aftir hym In that tyde; So that his strok he ne Myhte restreyne, but that his hors he smot so sore Certeyne that his Chyne he smot In sonder. the hors down fyl, it was non wondir, and the kyng was √æere sone Alyht, &amp; Sire Nasciens kythed On hym his Myht; and vppon his helm he smot hym so that On bothe knes the kyng fyl tho; for non power he ne hadde to Ryse, So nyghe was he to his Iwyse. and whan Nasciens beheld Al this Cas, that he there In Swowneng was, he took the kyng be the helm Anon Er he wolde Ony ferthere gon, and took it Of Anon Of his hed, So that Open he lay In that sted. and whanne he hym Sawgh In this Manere, and hym to slen In his powere, ?if he ne wolde Mercy Crye, hym wolde he slen ful sekerlye. ‚Äú?elde the, sire kyng, ful Certeynle, Other Ellis In feyth I schal the Sle be the helpe Of Goddis Myht, but √æou the ?elde Anon Ryht.‚Äù ‚ÄúSle me thanne, quod this kyng, For I have levere with-Owten faillyng A paynem To dien In this place, thanne Cristene to be, and haue grace.‚Äù Whanne Nasciens him herde thus tho seyn, Anon his swerd he took Certein, and smot Of there his hed, Evene from the scholdres, In that sted.

Whanne here Enemyes so Ouercomen were, Anon here loggen brenden they there, And seiden pleynly Anon thenne, that here good wolden they brenne; for Of here good wolden they non, but √æere it brende Amonges hem Echon. thus hadden the Cristene victorie Of the Sarazines ful sekerlye, In the Erthe Of grete bretaygne, this I sey ?ow In Certeyne. thanne seide these Cristene Everichon, that ‚Äòbe hem this bataille was Neuere don, but Onliche, they wisten, be goddis Myht that hem hadde sosteyned In here fyht.‚Äô thanne was this a gret Afermeng To here Creaunce with-Owten letteng; Thanne knewen they wel ful verrayly That He Was Lord God Al Myhty; so that to God weren they ful Meke, ful stedfast Of feith, and debonere Eke; For the grete victore he hadde hem sent, here thankynge they ?oven to god verament. Now leveth the storye here Anon Ryht Of Alle these Meyne, I ?ow plyht, And Torneth to Josephes now Ageyn, as I schal ?ow declaren In Certeyn. CHAPTER XLV. HOW JOSEPHES WAS IMPRISOND, AND HOW MORDREINS ARRIVD IN GREAT BRITAIN. whanne Iosephes Owt of Galafort was gon, and his Fadir with hym wente Anon, and An hundred and fifty of his Meyne wente forth with hym In Compene; but forto kepen Ioseps wif, lefte Nasciens Meyne with-owten stryf, and Celidoynes, and of his kyn O√æer Also, Ioseps wyf tenden vnto.

Whanne the thrydde day Was Agon, thanne seide kyng Orkaws to Piers Anon, ‚ÄúSire Piers, ?e han me don Good Servise, And I Myhte it ?ow qwyten In Ony Gyse; but Axeth Of Me what ?e welen Crave, and be my CreAwnce ?e scholen it haue: And ?if it be In My powere, what that Evere ?e Axen here.‚Äù ‚ÄúSire, quod Piers Ageyn hym to, Myn Askynge ?e mown ful Esely do: For non Good Of ?owre ne wil I haue, Nether Of non Richesse ne wil I Crave; but On thing that ?e wolde don for me whiche schal profyten ?ow In Eche degre.‚Äù thanne kyng Orkaws Answerid hym Ageyn that he it wolde don In Certeyn. ‚ÄúNow, Sire, non thing Ellis I Axe Of the, but Cristene Man that thou wilt be, and forsaken now thy fals lay that thou hast worschepid Many A day;‚Äù and be-gan him forto schewe Of Cristes passiown with-Inne A throwe, and the holy vangelye gan him vndo, And Of Other poyntes Manye Mo; so √æat with-Inne two dayes Aftyr Sewynge he browhte hem Alle to Cristenynge, and Reneyeden the Sarasynes lay that they hadden kept ful Many A day. and there sente he Aftyr An Ermyt Anon, and lete hem Cristenen there Everichon. thanne the kyng that Orkaws I-Clepid was, his Name was torned In that plas, and ‚ÄòLamet‚Äô In baptesme Clepid was he, And his dowhter ‚ÄòCamylle‚Äô Certeynle. thanne, for the love Of the kyng, they Of the Contre Maden gret Beldyng, And A Cyte they gonne to Make, And ‚ÄòOrkanye‚Äô It Clepyd for his sake. Whanne that Cristened Alle they were For the Moste part In that Rem there, Thanne kyng Lamet seyde In his wyse To Sire Piers, that knyht Of pryse, ‚ÄúNow, Sire Piers, Myn Owne Frende that to Me han ben so good &amp; hende, Now that I have Fulfild to the Alle that Evere thow hast Axed Of Me, therfore, Sire, herteliche I ?ow preye that myn Request ?e welen not denye.‚Äù thanne seide sire Piers ful Sekirly, ‚Äòthat his Reqwest he ne schold deny ?if that It were In his powere Ony thing that he myhte don there.‚Äô ‚ÄúI ?ow beseche thanne, quod the kyng, that ?e wolden fulfillen now myn Axyng: My dowhter Camylle that ?e wolden take To ?owre wyf, Sire, for my sake; For sche is I-comen Of kyng &amp; qwene, and √æerto A good womman with-Owten wene; And I schal ?ow Sesen In Al Myn lond, and Maken hem Buxom to ?owre hond; &amp; ?yf thus, Sire Piers, it Myhte be, there nas neuere thing so Ioyful to Me as ?ow tweyne to ben knyt In Maryage, So worthy persones Of so hy parage.‚Äù thanne him Answerid Sire piers ful stille, ‚ÄúSire, sethen ?e han fulfyld My wille, ?owre Askyng gladliche, Sire, wile I do, I Sey ?ow Sykerle with-Owten Mo.‚Äù Thanne the kyng thanked hym Often Sithe, and Of that tydynge was Ioyful and blythe; and thus sone he sente aftyr this Mayde &amp; tolde hire how this Gentyl knyht hadde saide, So that Ensured thanne bothe they were, And for the Mariages they Ordeyned there. And happede that A?ens the day Of weddynge Thedyr was Comen Sire Lwcye the kynge, and Merveillede that Alle I-Cristened weren there In so schort tyme sethen to-gederis they were; ?it Neuertheles he desirede so Sore To knowen Sire Piers And Of his lore, and forto haven his Aqweyntawnce he ne wolde not leven for Al this Chawnce. So that In the Cyte of Orkanye was this Maryage ful Ryalye; and there kyng Lwcye Abod viij dayes Fulliche, As this Storye here Sayes, To beren Sire Piers √æere Compenye that was so worthy In Chevalrye; For the kyng him preisede so wel Of Bewte &amp; bounte Euerydel, so that neuer wheche he Say So Mochel him pleside be hys lay. And Er the viij dayes I-past they were, Sire Piers kyng Lwcye so preched there, And Al his Compenye Ek therto that thike tyme with hym comen tho, &amp; hem gan schewen Cristes lawe, where-Offen kyng lwcye was ful fawe; So that Cristened thanne wolde he be be swych A Covenaunt As I schal tellen the, with this, that Piers In Compenye with kyng Lwcye wil holden Chevalrye; And herto Swrawnce to √æ? kyng he Made, where-Offen that Meyne weren ful glade; and √æat he wolde hym loven Aboven Alle Othir, As love scholde ben be-twene brothir &amp; brothir. Thus kyng Lwcye there Cristened was And his Meyne Also In that plas; Thorwh the teching Of Sire Perown, thus weren they Crestened Alle In-virown, As witnesseth Sire Robert Borron here that from latyn to Frensch translated this Matere. and Ek the Olde Storye Recordeth Also That In this Manere this was I-do; And ?it Neuertheles Brwtes Storye Of Sire Piers ne Maketh non Memorye; For it Is ful Syker, with-Owten dowte, that he which In Romawnce this drow Owte, he knew ful lytel Of Seynt Graal, Owther Of the Storye Of Sank Ryal; And therefore noman Merveille hym here thowgh of Sire Piers he speketh not there; but they ne Connen not hem Excuse, Neuere owt Of this storye him to Refuse. Ryht longe lyvede Sire Piers there In worthinesse and strengthe, In diuers Manere; and vppon his wyf there be-gat he A worthy Eyr In Alle Maner degre; And Herlawnt was that Childes Name, A vayllawnt knyht, And Of gret Fame. For whanne to harmes that he Cam, he wax A worthy Chevalrows Man; And whanne that Sire Piers ded was, he Comaunded his Meyne In that plas In Orkanye hym forto Entere, In A Chirche Of Seynt Phelyp there; that be his lyve he dyde Don Make In Worschepe Of God And Seint Phelyppes sake; and thus Entered there he was with Mochel worschepe In that plas, and Aftyr his deth his sone harlan the Regne Aftyr hym ReIoysched than, and Anon kyng was Crowned there; &amp; √æerto A good Man in Many Manere, and wedded √æ? kynges dowhter Of Irland, &amp; On hire begat, As I vndirstond, An Eyr that A kyng I-Crowned was, A worthy knyht In Every plas, hos Name was Callid Melyan, that was A Chevalrows &amp; A worthy Man. and Of Melyan descended Anothir kyng, A worthy Man In Alle thing hos Name √æat was Agristes, A worthy Man In Every ples, and √æerto bothe wys and Redy; and to his wyf A fayre lady, A womman Gentyl &amp; Of hy parage, and √æerto I-Comen Of gret lynage; so that On hire begat an Eyr of fame, kyng hedor Aftir was his name. and this hedor was On Of √æe beste knyhtes that Evere In Orkanye was In fyhtes, &amp; wedded √æ? kynges dowhter Of Northgales, As In this Manere vs scheweth these tales; And An Eyr On hire Engendred he that Aftyr kyng was Of Orkane; And kyng loot thanne was his Name, A worthy Man &amp; Of gret Fame; &amp; On Of kyng Arthures kyn weddede he,‚Äî which was A man Of gret powste‚Äî and sche was lady faire and gent. &amp; on hire he Engendrede verament Foure sones ful trewelye, As Recordith this Storye,‚Äî Of wheche the ferste Gawneyns hyhte, that was A worthy Man In fyhte, but that luxoryows he was, A gret vys In Every plas. The secund ne was not so worthy A knyht, And Granayns be his Name he hyht, and √æerto A prowd Man was he, but not to Comende for Chevalre. the thrydde brothir hyhte Gwerrehes, A worthy Man In Every pres, and longe Endurede In travaille; but Atte laste with-Owten faille Ful velenosly he was Slayn be Boort O√æer lawncelot In Certeyn. The fowrthe brothir, was his Name Gahenet, A man Of Fame. this Gahenet was a worthy knyht, bothe trewe and stedfast In Every fyht; and this of the fowre bretheren wisest was, this forseid Gahanet In every plas. but ?yt Cam he neuere to Gaweyn, As this storye seyth Certein. but thanne was there On Mordret, that men Supposen hadde ben be-get Be-twene kyng Loot and his wif; but it was to-foren with-Owten stryf, kyng Arthewr On his Soster Engendrid hym, As Manye bokys it telleth In Rym; For he wende the Maiden Of Yrland it hadde be, whanne that to his Soster wente he. and whanne that he knew Apertly that with his Soster he hadde synned fleschly, Thanne Repented they hem Wondir Sore Of that dede they hadden don thore. but this was Er he weddede Gonnore, That A worthy lady was, and Of good lore. Now here Mown ?e sen In Certeyn, the Generacioun bothe hol and pleyn; And how that Gaweyn Of √æ? lyne Cam Of Iosephes Of Armathie, that Good Man; and this Supposeth not the peple here; but It is thus In Alle Manere. And now leveth here this Storye &amp; of Al this lyne ful Sekerlye, and Only torneth to Iosephes Agayn As here Aftyr ?e scholen heren ful pleyn. CHAPTER LIII. OF JOSEPHES AGAIN, AND OF HIS YOUNGEST BROTHER GALAS. Now forth this Storye gynneth to procede, and to Othere Materis it wyle vs lede. whanne that Iosephes departyd thenne From Piers &amp; Pharans, thike two goode Menne, whiche pharans hadde In Governaunce, thorwh happeng Of A lytel Mischaunce: and whanne that Iosephes from hem was gon And Ek his Compenye Everychon, Ful Manye Iornes they wenten In fere, and but wilde forest ne fownden they there, &amp; Ek wylde bestes In that plas, where-Offen the lond repleynsched was; and ful Mochel harm they gonnen do To √æ? peple that wente bothe to &amp; fro; For that tyme Bretaygne Repleynsched not was Toward scotland but In lytel plas: and where that Evere Iosephes wente, he prechid Goddis Name veramente; and Euere where the Moste peple was, Sorrest he prechede In that plas, And wrowhte Only be goddis Myht, and be the holy gost that was so bryht. So that he Cam Neuere In non Contre, but ?if his wille Of the peple hadde he. And thus wente Iosephes Al Abowte Into straunge Contres, with-Owten dowte, Into Scotlond, wales, &amp; Into yrland, and Into manye O√æer partyes, I vndirstand. &amp; whanne thus he hadde travailled In this Manere, and departed his kynnes Men bothe here &amp; there, Forto Anhawncen there goddis Name In Every Contre where that they Came, that so Atte laste him took A talent To Galafort to Gon thanne verament; and whanne the Castel he Aprochid so Ny, And saugh It wel Amendyd Sothfastly, More dowble Ouer that It was Sethen he departed from that plas; but Merveille √æer-Offen was but lytel there, For he hadde ben thens Fyftene ?ere; and Abowtes that Castel weren there dyht Manye Abbeyes In worschepe Of God Almyht, that Manye goode men hadden don Mad Sethen Iosephes departed from that sted. And whanne he was come to galafort, And Ek his Meyne thider gonne Resort, be that tyme his Modyr I-beryed was In An Abbey besides that plas, that by the Castel was there, worthily I-beryed and In fayr Manere; but Galas that his brothir was, whiche Iosephes lefte In that plas but of ?ong Age At his departyng, was A knyht Aforn his A?en Comeng, the worthiest holden In Chyvalre that was knowen In Ony Contre; And Ordre Of knyht took this Galas Of Nasciens that Stille Abod In that plas, where-Offen Iosephes Merveilled sore whanne his brothir A knyht that he say thore. and whanne they of Galafort Iosephes sye, Ful gret Ioye they Maden, and Melodye, Of Iosephes and Ek of his fadyr Iosepe; A?ens hem √æere Ronnen A ful gret hepe, and to hem ful grete Festes made, and to here Compenye, to Maken hem Glade; For swich Ioye as Made dewk Gaanor whanne Iosephes and his fadyr he sawh thor, Neuere so gret Ioye half he Made as that tyme he dyde, he was so glade; For In herte to forn tyme ful sory he was that Iosephes so longe was from √æat plas. A while whanne that Iosep[he]s was rested there, Of the Maners of his brothir he gan Enqwere; and dewk Gaanor him Answerede Anon, &amp; seide, ‚Äúswich A man As Galas was On, Of body, Of prowesse, and of dede, knew I neuere In non kyngrede.‚Äù and whanne Iosephes of galas herde this, thanne was his herte ful Of blis, and to hym thanne Galas was ful dere, and herteliche hym lovede In Alle Manere. The ferste Mownthe √æat Iosephes Cam to Galafort, Thedyr Messengeris to him gonnen Resort, and thedyr they browhten hym newe tydynge, that sekerly ded was here kynge Of the Rem of hotelise, that was tho Cald, and After cleped Gale?, as now it is hald. and bencheson that here kyng ded was, to Iosephes they senten Into that plas, and hym preyden ‚Äòfor his honowr to Geten hem A lord and a Governour, wheche that worthy here Crowne were forto bere In defens Of here lond Every where; for ?if oure Rem with-Owten kyng be Ony while, It Myhte sone thanne fallen Into Exylle.‚Äô whanne Iosephes herde Of Al this Fare, Anon dewk Gaanor to hym Clepid he thare, and also dede he sire Nascien, To taken Cownseyl of these two Men; ‚ÄúFor ?if the Rem of hotelice with-owten kyng were, It Were to the peple a ful gret dere, and lyhtly Myht Tornen In to Exyl, whiche were to the peple ful gret peryl. wherfore In goddis Name I ?ow preye, that trewe Conseil Of Ryht ?e welen Me seye, what Maner of Man that best worthy be that Rem to governe In Alle degre, and that the sothe ?e welen me say, In charge of ?oure sowles at domesday.‚Äù ‚ÄúSire, quod dewk Gaanor and Nasciens thenne, the sothe to Morwe we scholen ?ow kenne.‚Äù vppon the Morwen whanne it was day, thus bothe to Iosephes gonnen they say, ‚ÄúSire, Of that ?e gonnen vs to Refreyne, vppon Oure sowles √æ? sothe we scholen ?ow seyne, that In this Lond Man so worthy Is Non Of worthynesse In chevalrye Of flesch ne bon. Ne non so worthy A Rem In governaunce to have, As Is Galas ?owre brothir, so god vs save. and therfore now doth ?oure likynge, For we holden hym best worthy to be A kynge.‚Äù ‚Äúwel, quod Iosephes, ?it schal I Enqwere of Other Men that ben not so Nere.‚Äù thanne sente Iosephes forth ryht Anon, Aftyr twelve the wysest Of Al that won. Anon to forn hym they Comen thus sone, and to hem there spak he Al Alone; lyk As he hadde Seyd to dewk Gaanore, to these xij worthy men he seyde Ryht thore; and Anon On styrte forth be-forn, and seide they scholden hym Answeren vppon √æ? Morn. vppon the Morwen they Comen Alle twelve, and Aftyr Gaanor they seyde the Selve, and seiden that Non So worthy Nas to ben A kyng, As was his brothir Galas. thanne Iosephes, his brothir Gan he to Calle, and thus to hym seide Aforn hem Alle, ‚ÄúBrothir Galas, come hydyr to Me! kyng Of the Rem of hotelyce schal I Maken the be Cownseyl of these goode Men Certeyn, For the grete goodnesse that Of ?ow they seyn; For sekerly it Nys not don by Me Althowh that ?e my brothyr be; but sethen that ?e ben Of swich prowesse, I am Ryht Ioyful In Sykernesse that ?e ben worthy to haven swich honour, Of the Rem Of hotelyce to beren the flour.‚Äù thanne knelede Galas down Anon, And of Iosephes this ?ifte Resceyvede thus son. Thanne Aftyr Anon the thrydde day Iosephes from Galafort took the way, So dede Ek Sire Nasciens &amp; dewk Gaanore, And this ?onge knyht Galas with hem Rod thore, and with hem Also gret Chevalrye To hotelyce Ryden In Compenye; and Anon ful worthyly Resceyved they were Of Alle the baronage that was there, and ful gret Ioye Of hem they Made, And ek Al the lond of hem weren glade. So that it happede On whyt-sonday that for this Galas was Mad gret Aray Atte Moste worthiest &amp; worschepful Cyte Of Al hotelyce, As I telle the, which that Palagre was Cleped thanne; Thedir Resorted ful Many A Manne For to sen the kynges Coronacyon, Thedir they wenten with good devocion; so that there A kyng I-sacred was Galaa?, Of his Owne brothir Iosephes in that plas. Thus helden they there A worthy feste, and weren ful welcome bothe Mest and leste; So that Galaaz stille kyng dwelde there, and hyghly beloved was Every where Of dewks, Erles, &amp; of Barown, and Also of Alle his Regyown; So that for his good beryng and his fame The lond Euer Aftyr hym bar the Name; For Aftyr the tyme that Galaaz was ded, It is Evere clepyd Galez In that sted, whiche Name Neuere Chongen schal In this world whiche is Fynal. Thanne this Galaaz wedded A wyf, A kynges dowhter with-Owten stryf, and On hyre he be-gat, the sothe to say, A sone that was kyng Aftyr his day; and of that sone be Ryht Engendrwre desendid kyng Vryens, I the Ensure, that was ful of worthynesse In kyng Arthures tyme, and of prowesse; and a felawe was Of the Rownde-table, As I ?ow here telle with-Owten fable, and slayn was with kyng Arthowr In bataylle vppon the pleyn Of Salysbery with-Owten faille, where As kyng Mordret and kyng Arthowr To-gederes hadden A ful gret Schowr; And there Ryht kyng Mordret was slayn, And kyng Arthour I-wownded ful sore Certayn. vppon A day as Aftyr it befylle, I schal ?ow Of kyng Galaaz telle, that hadde I-Ryde Alle A day In A wylde forest, the sothe to say, tyl that It was A?ens the Nght, that Nethir of his Meyne ne Of howndis hadde he non syht; and so dyrk it be-Cam Anon that he ne wyste whedir to gon, Ne Cowde not knowen his Owne weye, Certeinly As I ?ow Seye. so that Into A wast lawnde he happede there, but non Manere Of weye sawhe he nowhere, and thus travers he Rod tyl Myd Nyht tyl atte laste he say A qweynte syht, In a drye diche A ful gret Fyr: thanne thedirward to drawen was his desyr. and whanne he was Comen to that plas, there hovede he, and Abod A ful gret spas, and Merveillede what this fyr myhte be, that so lyht brende In Alle degre. And whiles that Galaaz so hovede there, he herde A voys As it Come from fere, whiche that Seyde there to Galaaz, ‚Äúlo, here thy Nygh Cosyn In this plas, that here In this torment do dwelle, and hens ne May not, I the telle.‚Äù whanne Galaaz herde hym Cosyn so Calle, he Merveillede how that myhte befalle, and hym Abaschet wondyr Sore Of the voys that he herde thore, And seyde to hym, ‚Äúthat thow telle Me, wherby I May knowen In Ony degre what Maner Of thing that thow Art, And why to the delyvered Is this part Of so gret Angwysch and torment, As here with myn Eyen I se present; whiche thing I desire ful sore to knowe, Of Alle this tormentis vppon a Rowe.‚Äù ‚ÄúI Am Symew, thyn Owne Cosyne, that here now dwelleth In this pyne Forto qwenchen My Mysdede that I dede to Perown of Falshede, the wheche Myn Owne Cosyn was As thou hast to forn herd In O√æer plas, and therfore non More I schal the Seye; but, for his love √æat On Cros Gan deye, So that In Aleggeng Of my peyne, do for me On thing that I schal seyne, and fownde here som place of Religyown, that with good herte and good devocyown they Mown to Iesw for Me preyen, here My peynes forto Aleggen.‚Äù thanne Answeryde Galaaz, ‚ÄúSykerle, Symew, I have wel herd speken Of the; but telle me now Symew my Axyng, Schal this turment ben Euere duryng?‚Äù ‚ÄúI schal the telle,‚Äù quod Symew tho, ‚Äú?if that this thing that thou wilt do.‚Äù ‚ÄúI the graunte, quod Galaaz thanne, Ryht As I Am A trewe Manne. and ?it for the I schal don More; with Manye fayre Goodes I schal it store, and √æerto here don Maken A Riche Abbeye, Trustylich, Symew, As I the Seye; ?it More-Over I schal preyen be my levynge, that I, Aftyr this worldes departynge, In that same Abbeye I-beryed to be, For Mochel it ben Amendid be Me; and that I hope schal don the Ese, Aleggeng thy peyne, And Ek god to plese.‚Äù Anon thanne Symew be-gan to Crye, And thanked Galaaz with voys ful hye. Thanne Seyde Symew √æere to Galaaz whiche that hovede √æere In that plas, ‚Äúvndirstondeth, Sire Galaaz, Ryht wel, that this torment schal passen Every del Al so sone As that A worthy knyht that Aftyr the schal hoten ful Ryht Cometh to vysiten this Ilke place; God with hym schal senden his grace, and In this diche stawnchen this feer, that thou here Sixt brennen so Cleer; and √æat be Encheson Of On thing is this, that neuere with luxvre he was brend Iwys; and Into this lond Of his Entrynge, Alle the poyntes of seint graal scholen hauen Endynge.‚Äù Thanne lefte Symew his talkynge, And no More Spak to Galaaz the kynge; And Alwey kyng Galaaz Gan hym Refreyne, but neuere Aftyr word to hym wold he seyne. And whanne √æ? kyng Sawh that he Nolde to hym no More speken vppon that Molde, In to his weye he tornede Ageyn (As that tyme hym happede In Certeyn,) where as he departyd the day to fore, there As Al his Meyne hadden hym lore; and there with his Meyne Mette he Anon, that for hym hadden Mad ful gret Mon, lest that som Misaventure to hym hadde Comen, I the Ensure; but whanne they syen hym wel At his Ese, thanne In here hertis it dede hem plese. vppon the Morwen, whanne it was day, the kyng Abowtes sente be Every way bothe Aftyr Masowns And Carpentere, An hows Of Religiown to Fownden there where As Symew to hym spak: thus dede kyng Galaaz with-Owten lak, and fownded An hows Of the Trenite, And there-Inne Syxty Monkes serteinle, and therto fownded hem with good Inowhe, Of londes and Rentes, Oxen And plowhe, So that they hadden Suffysawnt levynge for Alle Cristen Sowles to preyen &amp; synge. And Al so sone As kyng Galaaz was ded, he let hym beryen In that same sted; And with hym Al his Armure, And Also his helm, &amp; his swerd, I the Ensure; &amp; √æere In A Riche grave hym pytte, For that non Man scholden Remeven Itte to Fore tymes that lawncelot the lake thedyr come, √æat body vp to take, that with gret peyne it scholde Remeve. lo here of Galaaz the storye doth leve, and telleth now of Iosephe, how that he departyd from that hepe, From Iosephes, and from his brothir Galaaz, And tornede A?en In to Anothir plas. CHAPTER LIV.

CHAPTER LVI. OF CELIDOYNE AND HIS DEATH, AND THE GOOD KING LANCELOT. OF THE BLEEDING TOMB, AND THE END OF THE HISTORY OF THE HOLY GRAAL. Now Scheweth forth this Storye and putteth vs into More memorye; For whanne that Iosephes hens scholde pase, Nasciens And Celidoigne weren In that plase, And Ek Narpus the sone of Celidoygne, A ful worthy knyht In Certaygne. and whanne this terement was I-do, thanne Anon Celidoygne wente hem fro, and sire Nasciens with Mordreyns lefte Sikerle To beren hym Felischepe and Compeyne; and so that Aftyr It happede, As I ?ow Say, that Alle thre they deyden In On day, bothe Nasciens and Flegentyne his wyf, and Also Mordreins qwene there left hire lyf, that Noble qwene Sarracynte, Of Goddis Servise Neuere sche stynte. Thus bothe the ladyes Enterid were In that same Abbey with-Owten dwere where As Mordrayns bedered lay; bothe weren they Enterid In On day. but Nasciens liked not there for to be, but to Anothir Abbey was born Sekerle; and with him was born that Scheld that non knyht ne dorste be-weld; and ?it Cam thedyr ful Many A knyht For that scheld there to proven his Myht; but Abowtes his Nekke henge it neuere Man but Er he thens wente Repented than, that Owther Of sodeyn deth they deiden Anon, Owther som Othir Mischevis fyl hem vppon, that with-Inne Schort tyme I-Maymed they were, Owther som Othir Misaventure to hem Cam there. and thus In that Abbey lefte theke scheld stille tyl that worthy knyht Cam, As was goddis wille, That hyghte worthy Galaaz, Lawncelottes sone, That Abowtes his Nekke henge it Anone. Now Of this scheld Resteth this Storye, and A?en to Celydoygne doth it hye. Whanne Celydoygne from his Fadyr partyd was, he took forth Narpus his Sone A ful gret pas, and to-gedris wenten I Compeneye Into that lond ful certaynlye that toforen kyng Mordreins him hadde betake; and there Narpus his sone A knyht gan he Make; and dwelled there xij ?er In pes and Reste, And that Lond wel Governede with the best, So that non Regne that by hym was, dorste with hym werre In Non plas. he lovede God ful Enterly, and mochel Almesdede ded he trewly; For so gret Of Almesse he was that to peple wolde he ?even In Every plas; and so ful he was Of Almesdede that he wolde Stynten In non stede; thowgh Al the world hadde ben his, to Almesse it scholde han gon I-wys. And so Mochel he knew Of Astronomye and ek Of the Corps of √æ? sterris sekerlye, So that he knew what scholde beFalle; And so that Amonges Othir thinges Alle, As the sterres he beheld, I ?ow Ensure, √æere say he A wondyr Aventure; For there Sawhe he sekerly and In Certaigne a famyne that Schold fallen In gret Bretaygne; So that for hunger men Scholden deye but ?if it were Remedyed be Other weye. Thanne spak he to his Styward Anon, and bad ful faste that he schulde gon and taken his tresour, where so it were, &amp; Al abowtes the Contre to Serchen there, there-with Cornes To beyen, and faste him spede. ‚ÄúSire, quod his Steward, it Nys non nede, For Of Cornes ?e haven, Sire, gret plente, More thanne be ?oure howshold spendid schal be Of Ony tymes this two ?er; Of Cornes ?e haven both hol &amp; feer.‚Äù ‚ÄúSire steward, what is that the vntylle Go forth, and My wyl √æou fulfille!

Whanne that Alle Assembled they were, thanne seide kyng Celidoygne to hem there, ‚ÄúLordinges, vndirstonde ?e Owht why so sone ?e hider ben browht?‚Äù ‚ÄúNay, Syker, Lord, with-Owten lye We ne knowen wherfore ne whye, But ?if It lyke ?ow vs to seye; and there-Offen, Sire, we scholen ?ow preye.‚Äù ‚Äúand I schal tellen Ryht Anon to ?ow thyng that schal tornen to ?oure prow. ‚Äúthis same Nyht Atte ferst kok Crowe Moche peple scholen ?e sen vppon A rowe, And Al so strong As they Mown gon here scholen they Aryven Everichon. and weteth wel that In Certayn, Oure londis they Casten to wasten ful pleyn, For they han foure men A?ens Oure On; √æerfore bethenk ?ow what ?e wyl don.

So that whanne It Cam to the Nyht, they wenten to Armes Every wyht, And Entreden In to thike Forest, Alle the Baronage bothe lest &amp; Mest, and leften but fewe In that Castel, that forto Governen wondirly wel. thanne Anon, Aftyr the ferst kok krowe, these schepis Aryvede vppon A Rowe; and whanne Owt Of here schepis that thei weren gon, Into a faire Medwe they Entred Anon, And Comanded here Men, I ?ow Ensure, Forto don bringen hem here Armure; and whanne that they with-Inne the Forest thowhten whanne here tyme was best, they prekeden here hors with gret Ire As swyft As Sparkle Owt Of fyre; bothe with lawnce and Ek with swerd, that ilke Meyne they Maden Aferd. and whanne they wolde han torned Ageyn streith to here Schepis In Certeyn; thanne Metten they with A nothir Meyne That they Weren not War Offen Sykerle; So that with Scharpe dyntes Inowe, that hedis &amp; hondis Into that feld flowe. thanne to the Castel wolde they han gon, For Owt they wenden han ben Echon; thanne Entrede √æere-Owt A gret Rowte, and that Meyne fyl Al Abowte. and therto the Mone schon ful bryht, that they myhte knowe Eche wyht; so √æat on hem Of Sessoigne fil the scomfiture, For vnarmed they weren, &amp; no thing sure, and so sore Abasched Also they were, that Echon weren they Slayn there. And thus savede Celidoygne his lond be tweyne skelis, ?e Mown vndirstond, bothe from famyne &amp; Ek his Enemyes, thus his lond there savede he twyes. and whanne that he was ded, God it wot, he was beried and Entered At kamalot. and Aftyr hym was Crowned kyng his Sone Narpus, with-Owten lesyng. whiche Same Narpus A son he hadde, That Nasciens, be cristeneng Clepen he badde; that In his tyme was A worthy Man, For A bettyr body non Man knew than. and Of this Nasciens there Cam Isswe A worthy Body bothe good and trewe wheche that was clepid Elayne the Gros, A ful worthy Man and Of gret los. and ?if that his fadyr A good Man were, ?it bettere was he, As I Can lere; For moche levere he hadde ded to be, that Ony thing to mysplesen God sekerle. thanne Of this Eleyns decendid A kyng that Isaies hyhte with-Owten lesyng, that worschepede his God In Alle degre, and for non thing neuere wroth sekerle. the Fyfthe kyng, that of Isaies decended than, hyhte Ionas, That was ryht A worthy Man; and therto he was An hardy knyht, and ful Of prowesse in Eche fyht; and holy Chirche he worschepede ay, With Al his Myht and strengthe Evereich a day. thanne Owt of gret Breteygne he gan to gone, and Into wales he wente thus sone, and wedded the kynges dowhter dere that hyhte Maroniex with-Owten dwere; On whom he be-gat the kyng Avme, that kyng of wales was Sikerle. and this kyng Avme longe lyved there, and √æere A sone he hadde, As ?e scholen here, whiche that lawncelot was his Name, A worthy knyht and Of gret Fame, that Owt Of wales he gan to Gon, and Entrede Into gret breteygne thus son; and weddid A kynges dowhter Of Irlonde, As I do ?ow to vndirstonde. this lawncelot hadde Al his fadris good, and was A Man Of ful gret Mood, and tweyne sones he hadde that kynges were, and √æerto ful dowhty with-Owten dwere, the ton hihte baun, the o√æer brons hyhte, &amp; bo√æe weren Men Of ful gret Myhte.

This same man that lawncelot hyhte, was A man of ful gret Myhte, and not A bettere with Inne his Rem that born was Of Ony barntem. besides the Cyte there he Abod, A ful fair Castel besides there stood; where-Inne A lady dwellede In Certeyne that was weddid to A Cosyn germeyne to Selidoygne that worthy kyng, he was Cosyn with-Owten lesyng; And the fairest lady forsothe sche was Of Al grete Bretaygne In Ony plas; And therto sche was the beste womman that Ony wyht Owher knew than, and √æerto Of hygh lyf, and Of good, and Also benygne Of herte &amp; Mood; and Alwey hire tresses behinden hire was dyht, that weren schineng As torche lyht; For that myhte sche not hyden In non wyse, It schon so bryht As thing of pryse; And euere was this lady ful Of Bownte, and worschepede god In Eche degre; So that fore hire bownte desired lawncelot to knowen that lady, As I wel wot; and so Often tymes hire he wente to se, And this storye here telles Me; And for that ladyes gret goodnesse ful Often tymes he gan thedir prese.
