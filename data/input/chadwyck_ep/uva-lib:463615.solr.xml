      <field name="fulltext">Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. An Elegy upon the death of M??? Anne King. I dare not say that Death in heav'n hath powre, Or that we have a second fatall howre: 'Tis impious to beleeve that soules doe range, Or that they can affect that foolish change Of happinesse, for Earth, (as if they thought Gadding to be felicity, or sought, A moderation of their joyes) that heav'n, The roomes being empty which she first had giv'n, Strives to make good afresh, that this should be The cause, deare Ghost, why we are robb'd, of thee. Yet pardon Heav'n, if I am bold to dare A question: you doe know how few they are That sucke your Ayre and goodnesse, how the earth Lookes like the errour of a monstrous birth, With scarce one perfect member, and will you Robbe us of our one peice, and make the few No number? Pardon then if for this wrong We leave your precepts, to live ill, and long. Be we once good, we shall not be at all; Vertue does onely hast a funerall. If that a mortall may but give advice, Teach not the world sinne by your Avarice; Spare us a while that little which we have, Let vertue finde somewhat besides a Grave; You first command us to be good, and then You take away the goodnesse with the men, Will not the bad say, Justice here is scant, To take our store, and punish us for want? But you are just, and wise, nor will acquaint Man with your reasons: Why an Embryon Saint Suddenly droppes into the Earth, which he, Had he liv'd long, would but have liv'd to see, And not affect, does pose all earth, and so Now we may weepe, because we cannot know: Now I but weep, that we have lost the wife That Overbury would have fain'd, my strife About your Iustice I disclaime; for I Know it is just that what was borne must dye. Yet without touch at your prerogative, I may summe up my losse, and dare to grieve With a full sorrow, I may say there dy'd One that was Heav'ns, as well as Henries bride; One that was match'd unto the Church, that she Might learne a Marriage with the Deity. Sure there were Velvet-cloakes that woo'd, &amp; those That could weare Scarlet for a need, and close Which Ladyes out of play bookes, that could earne A Mistris with a congy, and could learne How many sighes must carry her, which she By her wise choyce, left them to multiply. And would they onely griev'd, would I could raise Their teares a fresh, by adding to her dayes More yeares with Henry, that their envy might Cause them to burst, and dye for her in spight, Such funeralls were fit: but since that Heav'n Has harshly snatch'd what it had kindly giv'n; And thou must be the Sacrifice, and he Must have thy sorrow that erewhile had thee, Ile spare my teares which must of force cause his: 'Tis rudenesse when we cannot restore blisse To adde more to unhappinesse (then thou Sometime the happy choice of her, and now The sad survivor) pardon if my strife To grieve enough, give thee a griefe, not wife, If that my sighes could her to life repreeve, I would create aswell as now I grieve, To the Deane, from Flower in Northampton shire 1625. now the worthy Bishop of Norwich. Still to be silent, or to write in Prose Were a like sloath, such as I leave to those, Who either want the grace of wit, or have Vntoward arguments: like him that gave Life to the flea, or who without a guest Would prove that famine was the onely feast: Selfe tyrants, who their braines doubly torment Both for their matter, and their ornament. If these doe stutter sometimes, and confesse That they are tyr'd, wee could expect no lesse. But when my matter is prepar'd and fit, When nothing's wanting but an equall wit, I need no Muses help to ayde me on, Since that my subject is my Helicon, And such are you: ô give me leave, deare Sir (He that is thankfull, is no flatterer) To speake full truth: where ever I finde worth I shew I have it, if I set it forth: You reade your selfe in these, here you may see A ruder draught of Corbets infancy, For I professe if ever I had thought Needed not blush if publish'd, were there ought Which was call'd mine, durst beare a Critick's view, I was the instrument, but the Author you. I need not tell you of our health, which here Must be presum'd, nor yet shall our good cheare Swell up my paper, as it hath done me, Or as the May'rs feast does Stowes History, Without an early bell to make us rise, Health calls us up, and Novelty; our eyes Have divers objects still on the same ground, As if the earth had each night walk'd her round To bring her best things hither: tis a place Not more the Pride of Shires then the Disgrace, Which Ide not leave had I my Deane to boot, For the large offers of the cloven-foot Vnto our Saviour, but you being not here, Tis to me though a rare one but a Shire, A place of good earth, if compar'd with worse, Which hath a lesser part in Adams curse. Or for to draw a simily from the Hig'st Tis like unto Salvation without Christ, A fairely situate Prison: When againe, Shall I injoy that frendship, and that braine: When shall I once more heare in a few words What all the learning of past-times affords, Austin epitomiz'd, and him that can To make him cleare contract Tertullian, But I detaine you from them: Sir adjeu You reade their workes, but let me study you. To M?. Holiday Archdeacon of Oxon: from Flower 1625. Now that you dare receive a messenger, Now that the tyr'd-out plague begins to weare It selfe away, not people: when the street Begins a new acquaintance with the feet Of lowd coach-horses and the bells high call Is for Devotion more then Buriall, Now you dare read, accept what I here send A poore remembrance of an healthy friend. Trust me (deare Sir) I linger, and the day Though by the method of the yeare hee may Truly be said to shorten, and to slight Former conceits, make Britaines know a night Long, unto tediousnesse, yet to me Seemes like Alcides night lengthen'd to three, Whilst I want you: Yet doe not misconceive The earnest of your friend, as if to leave My former company I were so faine; I would have them, and you: if I complaine Hotly of times delay, expound that fire Not to have flames of anger, but desire. To see the poverty of man! he still Receives but curtall'd happinesse, his skill Makes him not capable of a full store, But if he have some, he must want the more. How could I prize my selfe lesse then a marke For an high envy, when (as in the arke Onely poore eight were rescu'd from the waves, And that which drowns the world, their vessel saves, The depth of the devourer) not uneven In Fortune, though in Number, not past seven, Our preservation lasts unto this hower From the fierce plague in the dry arke of Flower? When that I had the daily happinesse Of conversation with my Deane, when lesse Then Heaven I could not thinke on, when I saw A face, that might heav'n to affection draw, When I injoy'd beauty, and wit, to trye Which could be more delighted eare, or eye; Yet I was not delighted not that ought Was wanting, which Ide covet to be bought; Nor what was bought was envi'd me; tis true, Yet I had a neer want, the want of you. But had I wanted them had I liv'd still With my deare Holiday; had there to my will Beene an agreeing lucke, I can conceive Happly I might have wish'd those, whom I leave. Nor is this accusation: fancy not That I am changeable: if in the hot Rage of the dogge, I goe but thinly clad, And in the winters other rage am glad To beare a fire too in my cloathes, theres none Will call this Lightnesse, but Discretion. Nor is it Fond, which I professe my suite, To wish the good of which I'm destitute, He cannot be accus'd like to the weather, Who'd have by parts, what he must want together. You are that part now: whom if I injoy, No thwarting chance shall possibly destroy My blisse: the other want strikes not my soule, Ile sweare this halfe does comprehend the whole. Vpon the death of his worthy friend M?. Iohn Deane of New-Colledge. Nature, will it ever be That we must complaine or thee? Shall then all our search ne'r finde Age at least to worth assign'd? Must this constant truth be knowne Vertue dead as soone as Growne? Happy Deane then, who may'st call Thirty, Climactericall, And in spite of Envies sport Prove thy good life by thy short, Thus when others that doe dye Old or in their Infancy, Must (if our Divines say true) Be transform'd and shap'd a new, That at length they may appeare Much about our Saviours yeare (For in Heav'n there never shall Enter either Old or Small Since that these can ne'r agree Weakenesse and Æternity,) Thou, deare shadow, needst not have Any wonder in the grave, Done for thee, nor thinke upon Future augmentation Reader, he that herein lies Dy'd as old as he shall rise. To his Detractors. Deane, (then which no other name Is of better, of more Fame) Sleepe in quiet: if there be Tongues of that Malignity, That will dare to wound thy grave And not suffer thee to have Slumber here, Ile say no more; May they when they have plai'd ore All their scenes of life, but know The same Rigor, that they shew That 'tis not generous, nor scarcely safe To make a Libell, for an Epitaph. A Song for the Musicke lecture. Strike againe; ô no, no more I implore, Such another touch would be My destiny. What bewitching soundes are these Which so please; As that we beginne to feare What we heare: Sound yet lowder, raise a Tone Which to owne, The cælestiall Quire would be Suitors t'yee, Sound yet lowder, that if Fate Make this date To my yeares, I yet may dye Speedily, And that this Ditty sweetly strong May be my Death and Fun'rall song. An Elegie upon the Noble Merchant M?. Fishborne. Doe they walke London still, and can we meet With any now but mourners in the street? Such a stupidity exceeds beleefe, To have so great a cause, so small a griefe: The kinder Marble weepes against a shower, And can these more then Marble-hearts not poure One teare for Fishborne? shall that VVorthy lie, Like vulgar trophees of mortality, Vnwept, and unremembred? or at best Have common showers, such as become the rest, Vassalls of death? who never thinking why They were plac'd her, doe onely live, and die, Who by no worthy act ayding their Name, Perish at once in person and in Fame. Where are our Cataracts? whereis the eye That strives for sorrowfull præcedency? That Poet now shall be accounted chiefe Whose wit is not the highest, but whose griefe: And he is most officious to this hearse, Who flowes more in his eye, then in his verse. Fishborne is dead, alas that Fishborne can Onely in goodnesse be above a man And not in lasting! that such men should have For all their worth, but a more noted grave, A sigh in earnest! Piety we see Will not afford us an Æternity, And hence we may collect the reason why So few are studious of Piety, So few are like to him: whom shall we see His holy rivall in Virginity? Whom shall we finde, that in an active life Like his, injoy'd the meanes, without the wife? Nay I may aske how few there are that shunne Like him, the sinne in the occasion? How few there are that looser thoughts defie! And onely in good deeds doe multiply. Him no deformity, no want of Fire, Of lively blood did tame in the desire Forc't to cold goodnesse, but his minde, as free From the tyrannicall necessity, As from the vice; he therefore liv'd not well Because he did not know the way to Hell, Chast out of weaknesse, no, he might have beene A strong delinquent, powerfull in sinne, He might have made, had he but heard his sense, His lust as famous as his continence, As was his friendship: which none can expresse So full, but that the prayse will be the lesse. How like unto a fable we esteeme, What heretofore did most Heroicke seeme, The Græcian frendships, when that we doe crowne Our happy thoughts with Fishborne and his Browne? His belov'd Browne, with whom he joyn'd in all Which Avarice would it's particular call, Cares, pleasures, hopes, and feares, nay they goe on Heavenly in a combin'd devotion, That they appeare, when ever we would scanne Which were the kinder or the better man, Æquall in all, their charity the same, Their continency too, all but the Name, So ready unto good, to bad so loth, They one another, love, but Heav'n loves both. O what an heate! what constancy was there! How did their love teach them how to persevere In holy duties! as if they had ment By such an exquisite astonishment To shew there was no difference in effect Betweene the Friendly man and the Elect; How were they ne're asunder but to meet! How all their parting was to make more sweet Their next embraces! nothing had the power, Deare Shade, to make thee feare thy latest how'r But a divorce from him, from his lov'd sight, That thou shouldst thy Browne too with the light. Add yet it was a kinde of friendship too That thou so rare a courtesie wouldst doe, To lead the way to death, in which alone Thou couldst not wish him thy companion. But is he dead? and does that harsher bell Toll with such horrour noble Fishbornes knell, Sure here's no funerall, or if there be, It is a Funerall of Poverty. Where are the preparations, the rich dresse Of Death, the gawdy tyre of Rottennesse? Where are the Hearlds? those great gods of earth, Who can bestow on man a second birth? And make him stand upon his honour now, Who yesterday did leane upon the Plow? Those grand Logicians, who exactly just Can shew the punctuall difference of each dust, And satisfie the most ambitious Dame Discreetly, from what noble worme she came? No, none of these does he vouchsafe to hire, Who onely make a well-clad Gull admire At his full vanity, which fill our minde With pride, I feare, farre higher then our kinde, Then our progenitors ere knew: but he Chooseth the Heralds of that Majesty, Who swaies the world, those men who heav'nly wise Instruct us to below in our owne eyes; Who shew us that the way to the most High Is by dejection and humility, Which blazon to us our Originall, The lowly earth, and then our baser fall Beneath that lownesse, unto these he payes A tribute after he hath spent his dayes: When natures due was pai'd, his wealth is theirs, Whose life did call th? fathers, whose death, heyres. By his wise zeale the Churches the Priests are, And they have now the meanes, who had the care: Nor doe they longer finde, to breed despaires, The tythe another's, when the Pulpit's theirs. I have no Art of wonder, nor no skill To make an action greater by my quill, Yet thus much truly can say without the ayde Of figure, Twas an act fit for a maid, For him, who leads us in the way he trod, Bringing himselfe, then others unto God; That if the world have such another birth, Our Saviour comming, may finde faith on earth It would be injury after this to call Him the true Surgion of the Hospitall, Which he hath so releiv'd, that there are found Some, who are sorry that they want a wound, That they have no defect in any limme, Which they should venture to be cur'd by him. Thus when the greater sort after much care, Much watchfulnesse, much cos'nage too, who dare, So they may raise their states, ransacke the Seas And after all their toyle cannot appease, Their endlesse thirst of gaine, although they mine So deepe in earth, Hell hath some hope to shine, And all this onely but to change a sinne, That what in covetousnesse did beginne Might end in riot, that to mocke their paines Their spending might be worse then were their gaines: Thou gatherst with much conscience, and then With greater goodnesse do'st disperse agen, That this praise to thy memory may be giv'n Here lies the merchant which hath purchas'd heav'n. Vpon a vertuous Magistrate. Sleepe lov'd soule, and let those eyes Which to rest were enemies Be atton'd at last, and lye Quiet to Æternity, Lie they quiet, but let ours Earnestly distill salt showers, And though they doe see the lesse Make a mourning businesse: 'Twere an act too neere to hate Him in rest to imitate? Howle ye Poore, now he is gone Who shall stop oppression? Who shall make the wary Law Speake uprightly, and not draw Specious colours, to indeare What were foule if it were cleare? Now ther's none your cause indures, Not because 'tis naught, but yours, Who will make the rich to see That unto an injury They are poore themselves? and find All their sinnes within their mind. For his wisedome did provide That they should hurt none beside. But now all the world may doe What they are addicted to: Lye, dissemble, cogge, and cheate, Make the easie poore their meate, And when they have raged thus Still be counted vertuous, Have the name, which he deserv'd And be prais'd though they have swerv'd. This in publike. But his life Did maintaine a glorious strife VVhich should be commended most, VVhether we might trulier boast Close, or open acts: If we Looke on that, which we can see, That is thought the best, but then VVhat we heare excells agen; So that which to trust we feare, If our eye, or else our eare, And there is no meane debate Twixt the Man, and Magistrate. But I interrupt the rest, Thou, who now amongst the blest Lookst on thy Creators face, Countst our praise a kind disgrace; And dost feare those acts were bad, VVhich no better praisers had. Sleepe then still, and let those eyes, VVhich to rest were enemies, Be atton'd at last, and lye Seal'd up to Æternity. THE EXPLANATION of the Frontispice. It was when Industry did sleepe The Wolfe was Tutor to the Sheepe, And to amaze a plainer man, The thiefe was made the guardian. But can a Wolfe forget to prey? Can Night be lightened into Day? Without respect of lawes or blood, His charge he makes to be his food. With that triumphant he sits downe, Opprest, not honour'd with a Crowne, And on the lesser beasts does try A most Authenticke Tyranny: This the French Lyon heares, and when He's thought fast sleeping in his denne, Vengeance and He at once doe wake, And on the Wolfe their fury slake. Bad acts may bloome somtimes, but n'er grow high, Nor doe they live so sure, as they shall dye. THE LEVITES REVENGE: Containing POETICAL Meditations, VPON the 19. and 20. Chapters of Jvdges TO HIS VVORTHILY RESPECTED FRIEND, Master Barten Holiday ARCH-DEACON OF Oxford. The explanation of the Frontispice. A Levite in his journey goes To wicked Gibeah for repose, VVhich is deny'd, but having found Another lodging then the ground, (Such is th'unkindnesse of their sinne) They make a prison of his Inne. From whence he shall not issue free, But by his wifes Adultery, So when from thence to hast he minds, Her dead before the doore he finds, VVhen to expresse their crime, and make The villaines at their owne guilt quake, Into twelve pieces he divides The body that was once his Brides, Now Gibeah is besieg'd, and though They twice have giv'n the overthrow Unto their betters, yet at length They finde Vice hath no lasting strength: For now their town's as hot as their Desire, And as they burnt in Lust, so that in fire. To my learned and highly esteemed Friend, M?. Robert Gomersall. Had such a Labour in this jugling age Sought after Greatnesse for its patronage, Not after Goodnesse, I had then beene free To love thy worke, though not to fancy thee; But thou hast wonne me: since I see thy booke Aymes at a judging eye, no smiling looke. Greatnesse doth well to shelter errours, thou Not having any, fear'st no frowning brow, But wisely crav'st a view of his, that can Not onely praise, but censure of a man. Thou needst not doubt severer eyes, if he Adde but applause unto thy Poety. His workes such monuments of fame doe raise, That none will Censure if he once but Praise. Commend I would, but what? here's nothing knowne Can be call'd thine, when each hath claim'd his owne. Jove-bred-Minerva challengeth the wit. Mercury flyes and sweares he languag'd it. Thy Artes the Muses claime; the History Savours of nothing but Divinity, Transcrib'd from Gods records; then nothing's thine (But griefe for th'Levites sinne) since th'use is mine. But now deare friend, though this sufficient be To raise up Trophees, and eternize thee: Give leave to him that loves thee to desire To serve thee friendlike, though in meane attire. The glittering starre that darts a glorious light Were lost if not commended by the night? So stands it with thy verse; I writing set Their beauty off, as Christall is by Iett. Nor doth it trouble me; since that my end Is not to be a Poet, but a friend. And yet perhaps these looser lines of mine May prove eternall; cause they usher thine. Midd. Temp. C. L. I. C. Epitaphium Concubinæ. Englished thus. Who suffer'd Gibeahs Lust, and her Lords knife, Whom not one Suitor would have had to wife; By many Suitors perishing, here lyes, A not-one Coarse, and many sacrifice. O who would trust in formes, that houres impaire, Vertue's true shape, and onely Goodnesse fayre. Psal. 92 I will bee glad and rejoyce in thee, yea my Songs will I make of thy name, O thou most High. Father of Lights, whose praises to rehearse Would pose the boldnesse of the ablest verse; Who art so far above what we can say, That what we leave is greatest: shew the way To my weake Muse, that being full of thee She judge Devotion the best Poesie, Teach her to shunne those ordinary wayes, Wherein the greater sort seeke shamefull praise By witty sinne, which ill affections stirres, Whose pennes at leastwise are Adulterers. O teach me Modesty: let it not be My care to keepe my verse from harshnes free And not from lightnesse; let me censure thus, That what is Bad, that too is Barbarous. Then shall my soule warm'd with thy sacred fire, Advance her thoughts, and without Pride aspire, Then shall I shew the glory of my King, Then shall I hate the faults which now I Sing, THE LEVITES Revenge. Canto. I. The Argument. The Levites Love, her flight, his stay In hope to bring his Runne-away: Gibeahs harsh usage, with the free, Vnlookt for old mans courtesie: Their base attempt, her wretched fate; This song to Time doth consecrate. VVhilst Israels government was yet but rude, And Multitudes did sway the Multitude, Whilst all the Nation were so many Kings, Or else but one great Anarchy: Fame sings That there a Levite was (Levites may erre) Who had a Concubine, and doubted her. Durst Lust and Iealousie so high aspire To one that onely knew the Altars fire? Must he feele other Flames? to wanton eyes Must ev'n the Priest be made a sacrifice? Or hath he offerd incense so long time For Judah's fault, that he hath gain'd their crime? Appeas'd for sinnes to learne them? in times past Whilst yet the ancient innocence did last, Levi could kill a Ravisher, but now Levies base off-spring does not disavow To be a Ravisher. Perhaps to show His Grandsires bloody rashnesse, who would so Punish that crime, which some years past might be His owne, at least in his Posterity. For so 'twas now: the Levite loves, and more, Suspects at last, whom he did first adore: For Fame speakes hardly of her: but poore man Fame speaks no more th? thou should thinke: for can One that hath broke with honesty, be true To him that made her breake? or else are you The onely Tempter? does there no blood boyle Besides the Levites? can they onely toyle In sinnes, that preach against them? if they can, Yet such as she are made for every man. What none can challenge his, is due to all, Lust should not imitate a Nuptiall. She now suspects her Levites jealousie, And hasts home to her fathers house: ô why To goe or come againe couldst thou dispense, And bring not backe againe, what thou broughtst thence? Was then a Father to be visited When thou wert made a Mother? what hope bred That madnesse in thee, that unto a mild Father, thou shouldst be welcome for a child? But unto whom wouldst thou have welcome beene? A Father? 'tis the nature of thy sinne: To make them doubtfull: they that live like thee, Asham'd of nothing but of modesty, Banish themselves from all, but their deare sinne; And lose at once their vertue, and their kinne. But when the Levite saw that she was gone, That she was lost, whom he so doted on, Reason almost forsooke him too, to prove Anger can blind a man as well as love: It may be Israel was holy then And sacrifices for the guilty men Came slowly in, this might increase his griefe, And be an accessory, if not chiefe: This might confirme him in his angry sinne, Rob'd of his profit and his concubine. But hee'l not lose her: wilt thou seeke her then That does fly thee? that to an host of men Hath giv'n thy due? as if she meant to try Which were the most unvanquisht luxury Of Priest or people: whom if thou shouldst finde, Thou hast not yet recovered her lost mind, That wanders still, and wilt thou fetch her thence To try, or else to teach thee Patience? Can she teach any vertue? can there be Ought learnt from her besides immodesty? All that this journey can effect, that thou Can'st promise to thy selfe, if thou speed'st now, Is, that shee'l lose the bashfulnesse she had, And onely prove more confidently bad. You now may thinke him neere his journeyes end, Where long before his thoughts had met his friend, Scorning his bodies sluggish company, And now both are arriv'd, where to his eye She first appear'd, for whom alone, I find, He thank'd the heav'n that did not make him blind, For which he should have thank'd them: he had been Then nor a Lover, nor a Priest: no sinne Had crept in with the light, nor ever made In that good Darknesse, an unhallowed shade But who had seene him when he first descry'd Who 'twas that met him, how he slipt beside The wearied beast, and with full speed did run As if he meant to tempt temptation; He would have judg'd that women strongest were, And men object the weakenesse which they are. Thus when he should wisely have understood, And thank'd the kinder heav'ns, who made him good Against his will almost, having remov'd That which did hinder him from being belov'd Of God, and goodnesse, not unlike the Fish Which seemes to be desirous of the dish, (As if for his delivery he did waite, And therefore were ambitious of the baite:) Into a knowne snare, he does gladly run, And foolishly pursues, what he should shun. And is not this, Ide know, the readiest way To make God thinke, we mocke him when we pray? When we pretend desire, that we may be, As from the Fault, so the Temptation free: Whilst (as we had not knowne what we had said, Or hop'd, that God observ'd not how we prai'd) Lest that we should receive our hurt from farre, We both the Tempted, and the Tempters are, And thus the holyest name we take in vaine, Praying as never meaning to obtaine. And now her father comes, who after words As kind and elegant as that place affords, Intreats her pardon: but alas, good Age, Who shall intreat thy pardon, or asswage The Levites passion now? who does averre, That he alone does sinne, who taxes her: With this he smiles on her, and yet does feare Lest she should thinke that this a Pardon were, Or reconcilement: without much adoe, You might perswade him now he came to wooe, And not to fetch her backe; but by the hast Of carrying her from thence, fearing the wast Of the least minute, she might well descry, What ere his words, his deeds spoke Iealousie. Hardly he condiscends to one nights stay Though 'twere with her: but how he spent the day, How his desires were speedier then the Sunne, (Whom then he thought to creep, and not to runne) Twere tedious to relate, though the old man With all the Art, and all the Cheare he can, Detaines him three daies longer, which appeare As long as fancy can extend a yeare. Minutes are Ages with him, and he deemes He hath out-lingred grave Methusalems Nine hundred yeare by such a stay, and feares That she may once more shunne him for his yeares. Sure such accounts the wise Egyptians made Who added wings to Time, as if he had Mov'd on too slowly, or as if they meant To take his fore-top from him, with intent To make him bald before too, whose records Had very neere as many yeares as words. Making full forty thousand ere the fall, And pu'ny Adam of no age at all. The fifth day dawnes, but ere the rising Sunne Had shew'd the victory which he had wonne Of cloudy night, before the sleepy Cocke Had prov'd himselfe to be the Country Clocke Shewing the mornings houre, when now we might Have spoke no falshood had we call'd it Night; Our Levite for his journey does prepare, And his are drest, ere Phoebus horses are: To whom the Father comes, and gently chides His earely sonne-in-law, who, forst, abides Till after noone with him, and then he goes Not from the house so fast, as to his woes, Sure the old man did prophecy the harme, Which would insue, when he did seeke to charme Our Levite to a longer stay: but O Tis double misery beforehand to know We shall be miserable! then why hath man That curst ability, that well he can Prognosticate mishapps, when they are neere? And all his knowledge teaches but to feare. Which yet our Levite hath not learnt, who rides Doubting no danger: now the worlds eye glides To his west Inne, when Jebus he espies, Whom he counts his, because Gods enemies. Hearken ye Gallants that will crosse the seas, And are industrious for a new disease, If you will needs be gadding, and despise For forraine toyes, our home-bred rarities, Take this example with you, if you goe Travell not from Religion: why, although You never touch at Rome, or else perchance You scarce see Spaine, and gleane but part of France, You may be weary, thinke your travell great, And spare at once your conscience, and your sweat; You see our Levite though the night draw neere, His love be weary, and no towne appeare Where she may rest herselfe, although the way Were troublesome enough eu'n in the day, Yet he resolves gladly to undergoe More miseries then Night and danger know, Ere he will venture there to make his stay From whence the Idols had drove God away: O farre unworthy of thy future Fate By this best Action! miserable state Of too great vertue ill-imploy'd! to be Punish't, when he did shunne Iniquitie, As he did Jebus. How he spurs, how rates His tardy beast! how his owne slacknesse hates? Which forc't him by his travelling so late If not to stay, yet to deliberate. Within the Center of the Earth there stands Neere to the fiery streames, and ashy sands, A dreadfull palace, of such uncouth frame, Each part so shap't as if twere built to shame All Architecture, that if one did see The vastnesse of it, and deformity, He would not make the least demurre to tell That 'twas a lodging for the Prince of Hell. What ere does beautifie a house, here wants, The walls are blacke as the Inhabitants, Made out of Iett, into such figures fram'd That Nature dare not owne them, nor be blam'd With so much Monster: we in doubt may call, Whether the trimming, or materiall, Had the more horror. No birds here are heard, But such whose harsher accents would have feard The most resolv'd: they punish in their rimes, And all their ditty does consist of crimes. They sly Præcisian that could gull the eye Of the most sharpe, by close hypocrisie, Whose mischiefes onely he that did, could tell, Who, we may thinke might ev'n have cheated Hell With such dissembling, sees his vices bare, Naked, and foule, as when they acted were: One layes oppression to his charge, another His sisters incest, murther of his brother, They shew his zeale was onely to contend, And all his reformation not to mend But to confound the State, that his knit brow (Which lookt so sterne as it would disallow The most indifferent act, and like of none But such as did pretend perfection) Was but an easie Vizor, such as Rage Can give it selfe, and must receive from Age. That he did onely know externall Grace, And all his holinesse was in his face. Is goodnes in a wrinkle? can we finde That what does cloud the face, does clense the mind? To me it is a tricke of rarest art That hollow browes should have the soundest heart. These are the sounds, but then the smells are worse, Enough to make that Harmony no Curse. Vnder the walls there runnes a brimstone flood The top of flames, the bottome was of mud: Of such grosse vapour, that to smell was Death, Prisons are sweet, compar'd unto that breath. And to maintaine the fire and stench at once, The fewell is prepar'd of usurers bones, Loose Madams lockes, the fethers of their Fanne, With the foule inside of a Puritan. In this sweet place as sweet a Prince doth dwell, The chiefe of fiends, the Emperor of Hell Grand Lucifer, whom if I should relate In the worst figure that the eye doth hate: I should but faintly his foule selfe expresse, Nor reach unto his unpattern'd uglinesse, Death keepes the entrance, a tall sturdy groome Who emptying all places fills no roome, But like the fond Idolater of pelfe, Denyes men, what he cannot have himselfe: Here does this shade send challenges to all, Who would have entrance first to try a fall, They try, and they are throwne; ther's none so great But yeelds to him, who knew but one defeat And that long after, but his prime was now, His bones some marrow had, some grace his brow. No plagues as yet, no famines had beene knowne, The sword was thrifty, making few to groane Vnder his edge. Death yet had lusty thighes, Nor spent himselfe with too much exercise. Here there stand numbers, which exceed all sums (For they refuse none here, who ever comes) The murtherer first, and without much adoe, Sometime he will admit the murtherd too. Then the incontinent, but if that he Be knowne by Incest or Adultery His seat is chiefe: nor have they a low place, Who with an open and alluring face, Delude their trusting friends, till they have wonn Their deeper projects, which they built upon. The rest of lower crimes, whom we may call, Downe-right offenders, such as after all Their time of trespasse, have not gain'd the skill, And onely know the taint, not art of Ill: Have no distinguisht roomes, but venture in As headlong to their paines, as to their sinne, But now some other enter; for a charge Past from the Prince of shadowes, to inlarge Th'imprison'd Crimes, that they might all conferre (Such is his will) with their Lord Lucifer. What noyse there was? what striving at the doore? This would be first, and that would goe before: Pride claimes precedency, and cryes who ere Ventures to make a step before her there Is impudently foolish, that the place Is hers by due, and onely theirs by grace, When she would yeeld it: unlesse first they would Bring more convincing reasons then she could: For who should to the Prince of Hell first goe To visit him, but she that made him so? And who had made him so, shee'd know, but she, When with his God he claim'd Æquality? Peace, wrath exclaimes, and with so deepe an oath As all those fiends, with Hell to boot, were loath To heare another such he vowes no more To beare the bravings of that scarlet whore, Hee'l first a Rebell, first a Vertue be, And no more Wrath, but Magnanimity. She smil'd, and bid him be so, but whilst they Were hot in this contention, Envy lay Gnawing her breasts: faine would she have bin higher Had but her spirit equall'd her desire. But since she cannot be reveng'd of them, She useth an unheard of stratagem, Teares her owne haires, and her gimme face beslimes Thus punishing her selfe for others crimes. By this time Idlensse comes in the reare, As proud, thoug not as active, as they were; He scarce would take the paines to speake, but loth To lose his dignity by too much Sloth, He gives them these few words, Why strive you so About the place which all to me doe owe? Doe notye know, I am the raigning Crime, Most generall, and most lofty of the time? I make the Lawyer silent, though he see His clyent full; I am beyond a Fee: When Lawes doe not I make the Preacher dumbe Ev'n when the Tyger, or the Wolfe doe come: But above all, I in the Court doe grow, Beggers are proud, but Emperors are slow. Drunkennesse could not answere, but does thinke Twas fit that Idlenesse should yeeld to drinke: And reeling to encounter him, does fall Iust in the entrance, and excludes them all. Now is the skirmish hotter then before, Now Pride begins to scratch, and Wrath to roare; Drunkennesse lies unmov'd, and Sloths intent Is to sit still, and to expect th'event. But in this civill broyle, at last comes Craft Of whom no Painter ere could take a draft, He had such change of shapes, who when he saw These tumbling warriours, and that no awe, No feare of Lucifer could reach them peace, Hee'l try his skill to make these broyles to cease, Fie Pride, sayes he, What? give your selfe the fall? And Wrath are you no more discreet withall Then quarrell with a woman? Come agree, If not for feare of Hell, for love of me. But out alas, you doe too well agree, When Wrath is Proud, and Pride will Wrathfull be. Goe hand in hand (thus friendly Craft decides) Onely the upper hand let that be Prides. They enter the great hall, where they doe see The Hellish Monarch in his Majesty, Where having made obeysance, he beginnes, Thus to breake silence and upbraid the sinnes. The reason why I call'd you (not to dwell On an unnecessay præamble) Is to informe you, that we finde of late You have not beene officious to the State: Tis true, yon bring me daily what's mine owne, And plentifully reape what I have sowne. In the grosse Heathen you doe hourely cause Vices, which never were forbid by Lawes, Because ne'r thought of? but what's this to me, Whether that Lust or infidelity Fill Hell with those, nay and oppresse it too, Which must come thither, whatsoere they do? You doe like those, who in the other life Buy their owne lands, and wooe againe their wife. A goodly act, and wherein's danger store, You give me that, which was mine owne before. Whilst Judah all this while hath me withstood, And dares, when I forbid them, to be good. They honor Parents with a zealous strife, And with their goodnesse doe prolong their life. In them no malice nor no rancor lies, Nor shed they blood, but for a sacrifice: Adultery's scarce heard of in a life, And they'are men onely unto their owne wife. In such a lou'd community they live, None need to steale, all are so apt to give. While you suppose that highly yon deserve If you can say that you have made them swerve From goodnesse that ne'r had it: well y'aue done If that Semiramis once doate upon Her wondring issue, and begin to swell With such a birth, that would pose us to tell How she should call it; and what she did beare If it her daughter, or her granchild were, You have discharged your office, if you make Some bloody Nations their owne issue take And offer unto me; or if you draw Some to the practice of that wicked Law That after fifty they their parents kill, And not that onely, but suppose that ill To be their duty. O fond thought! and thence Doe estimate their childs obedience. Hence truant Crimes, avant, no more appeare In my dread presence, no more let me heare Those petty actions, if you doe not straight Revenge my wrongs, and ease me of this waight, Which thus oppresseth me, if Israel still Shall dare to crosse what I shall call my will; By Hell Ile doe—but what? I say no more, If you are wise, prevent, if not, deplore. This said he star'd so fiercely that they fear'd He would performe much more then they had heard, Nor know they wel how they their tongues should use, Whether 'twere best to promise or excuse. At last Lust rises, and becalmes him thus, Why doe you loose your wrath, great Prince, on us? Vs your sworne vassals? who nor thinke nor doe But what your will is their command unto. What though w'ave spent our paines not the right way? Yet they were paines, nor can an enemie say But we were active Furies, and have done What lesser fiends durst not have thought upon. And yet (if that I may have leave to tell From your dread grace) precifer Israel Hath not escap'd us wholy, nor hath bin More noted for their Law, then for their Sinne. Was that a Vertue too, when being led By Gods owne hand, and fill'd with Angels bread, They did, (I joy to caus't, but blush to tell,) They did repine ev'n at that miracle. Fasting and full they murmure, nor are lesse Angry with Manna then with Emptinesse. I could speake more, and truely: but in summe, To prove my past acts by my act to come; If by your gracious leave, I have the fate To have a joynt commission with Debate, Ile make a fire within their blood to burne, Shall their proud Cities into ashes turne: And they shall know how foolishly they erre, Who are not willing slayes to Lucifer. Lucifer nods, and Lust does swiftly runne With his unlimited Commission: Which with what Art, what mischiefe he did use, Is now the griefe and bus'nesse of my Muse. But now she must to our sad Levite hast Whom we left trav'lling, when the day was past. The sunne sets over Gibeah; when that he Drawes neerer thither ward, but then to see The blush of Heav'n, with what a red it shin'd, (As if the Sun his office had resign'd Vnto those clouds) to all that understood, It would have shew'd that it did figure blood, And now our Levite is arriv'd, but finds The walls more courteous then the peoples minds: For these had gates which let him in, but they Were mercilesse, and rougher then the way: Men that had onely studied to oppresse, Whose mindes were shut against the harbourlesse: And yet he sees large houses, some so high As if they learn't acquaintance with the sky, What ever pleas'd their fathers now growes stale, Their buildings to the hills exalt the vale: And such thicke Palaces the mountaines fill, As if the quarry grew without the hill, Some are of that circumference you'd guesse, They had beene built for him, who had no lesse Then the whole world his Family. But when Our Levite was inquisitive, what men Fill'd up that Princely dwelling; and if there Might be found hope of rest for them that were But two more then the Family; they tell That two are the whole Family, 'twas well, And stately too (as state is at this day) So might they live at home, and yet away, O the great folly of Magnificence! Houses are little Cities, and from thence Cities are lesser worlds, that man may have Roome enough here that cannot fill a grave. He must have Halls, and Parlors, and beside Chambers invented, but not nam'd by pride: And all this for one man, as if he sought To have a severall lodging for each thought, But none for any stranger: this truth seemes Too certaine to our Levite, who esteemes That pris'ners are in better state then he; Nay, ev'n the pris'ners of mortality, Such as are fast immur'd within the grave Who though they want a life, a lodging have. Inhumane wretches! have you then forgot That you were sometime strangers? Were you not In Egypt once? where the Propheticke land Did justly scourge your basenesse before hand, Knowing you would be barbarous, and so Made you to feele the harshnesse which you show. O cruelly forgetfull! that indure To act, or else out doe the Epicure, Whilest he feeds on the Ayre, that thinke it meet To lye in Downe, while he lies in the street! An old man thought not thus, but to his house Intreats the strangers: 'tis malicious To lay the imputation upon Age That it is covetous (as if the sage Haires of the Ancient were therefore white To signifie their silver Appetite.) Peace you blasphemers, see an aged man Covetous onely of a Guest, who can Repay him nothing, but his Prayer, and be Indebted once more for his Piety; But if my Muse have any power o'r time And sinne hath more mortality then rime, Old man thou shalt be ever old, and have No entertainment in the silent grave For this thy entertainment: here a while Let me admire how that a towne so vile, Which we would thinke with strangers had decreed To shut out Vertue too, should rarely breed Such a strange Vertue? quietly we heare Of courtesies in Rome; of kindnesse there Where Greece is nam'd, who counted it a sinne Not to have made each noble house an Inne For worthy strangers: but when one shall fall In commendation of the Canniball, Shall say that they, who on their guests doe gnaw And entertaine their strangers in their maw, Are hospitably minded, that ev'n there May be a mouth which is no Sepulcher: We stand agast, as if we did conspire Not to beleeve the good we did desire. Whence sprung this Singularity? whence came This worth which so deserves and conquers Fame? Our Vertues are not borne with us, and they Which will innoble man till times last day Live after them they make to live, what we Call goodnesse, is the gift of Company, Our study not out Nature, and could these Teach any other thing besides disease In manners? it is fit then we confesse Mercy is learn't amongst the mercilesse, And rather then a Levite shall want rest Avarice selfe shall entertaine a Guest. But now the Levite hath forgot that he Had left the hard streets hospitality; He finds such kindnesse, that he does suppose Courtesie wore no other haires then those, To grieve the honest world, who now might feare. That she was hasting to her sepulcher. Into an anticke roome he leads him first, Where one would guesse that Abraham had beene nurst Or a more ancient Patriarch, the walls Compos'd of that which from a wett shooe falls In weeping winter, which a man would thinke Their age had now dry'd up into one Chinke Yet such a roome one comfort does afford, It was not built to ruine its sad Lord. For who will begge a Cottage? who would make A guilty wretch, that he his rags might take? To that whence nothing comes is no regard: None would be vicious too but for reward. No, let them feare who dwell in arched vaults, Who in much roome doe seeke to hide their faults. Where hundred columnes rise to mate the skie, And mocke their Lords with false Divinity. Envie is proud, nor strikes at what is low, And they shall onely feele who scorne her blow: She on no base advantage will insist, Nor strive with any but that can resist. Now is the table spred, and now the meat Be'ing set, each takes him his appointed seat: No courtship here is shew'd, no carving grace, The entertainment (homely as the place Spoke onely hearty, and that plaine intent Which greater entertainers complement. So Abraham feasted heav'nly guests, as when He made the Angels eat the bread of men: So on the like guests, hospitable Lot Bestow'd the diet which they wanted not; In this ours differs, nay in this exceeds, That he bestowes his kindnesse where it needs. One would have thought so, when he heard the noise, Of confus'd multitudes, men mixt with boyes, All ages in the cry, as if they meant That now the Babes should not be innocent: Bees doe not murmure so, and angry hounds In their full rage send forth but easy sounds, Compar'd to this: their inland Sea stood still, Wondring to heare him selfe out roar'd, and till This time, that noise hath such a silence bred, That ever since it hath beene styl'd the Dead. Now they besiege the house, and one would feare That their loud tongues so many engines were To batter it: downe with the Gate, cryes one, Another laughes at that, and with a stone Threatens to force a Gate, and deepely swore To give them entrance, all the House was Doore, But then another that would needs be wise, And counted chiefe in this great enterprise, Exhorts them to a Parley: Why, my friends, Make you such hast, sayes he, to lose your ends? Have you indented with the stones you throw To misse the Levit? Doe you thinke no blow Can fasten on him, or d'ye meane to prove If that the stones are rivalls in your Love? Stones and not men! with that the hands were still, But all the noise, the Hubbub, with an ill Consent, cries for the Levite, whom they faine Would onely know, and so returne againe. And could you see him in the street so long, As farre from being hid, as this your wrong Shall be from after-Ages, when he had No cover, but the kinder heav'ns, (whose sad Compassion hindred them from shedding teares, Lest such a griefe should make th'unkindnes theirs) Had you so full a view of him, and yet Doe you desire to know him? No, forget That ever there was such a one, and then Posterity may thinke that you were men: How will they wonder else, when they shall heare You lov'd him in the house, whom you did feare To bring into your house; that you were mad, In the pursuit of that you might have had? You ai'm'd another, a worse way, and just His answere is, that calls your Knowledge, Lust, But how, were they so long time innocent? How was this Prodigy of Desire ev'n spent Before it was exprest? here we may see In impudence there was some Modesty: They would not sinne at home, the worst abhor'd To be a beast, where he should be a Lord. And it seem'd better to the vilest breast Not to receive, then to abuse a Guest. Now the Old-man not fearing any harme That might ensue, whether he hop'd the warme Lust of their Youth, would by his Age be quelld, And that those flames would to such winter yeeld: Or whether he was then rather addrest To offer up himselfe before his Guest Vnto their Fury, forth he goes: they thought That now they should obtaine what they had fought, Whom thus he does bespeake; Have Patience My friends, I come, not to intreat you hence, But to fulfill your pleasure, onely change The Sex; I have a daughter, and what's strange In this hot towne, a Virgin: at your suite I am content to make her prostitute, So that my stranger may not injur'd be: Nature shall yeeld to Hospitality. O constant goodnesse! O best act, which can Conclude the Vertue, older then the Man! How I could lose my selfe in praysing thee, Man not of Age, but of Æternity! Who didst respect thy guest beyond thy blood, And knewst the difference betwixt Fond, and Good. Henceforth scorne all comparisons below, Onely thy Maker, thy Superiour know: Such was his Mercy that he did bestow His onely Sonne a ransome for his Foe; (This was a patterne fit for the most High) Yet next this Mercy, was thy Charitie, Thy Act in this is second to the best, Thou wouldst not spare thy Daughter for thy Guest. But they'l not be prescrib'd in their desire, Who thinke, to alter, were to quench their fire: They must the Levite or his Sister know, (For Sister they interpret her) to show Our sawcy Lay-men how they should expound Their Preachers actions, not to be profound To search their faults, but well and wisely too, Doe what they speake, and not speake what they do, This they exclaime, and this our Levite heares, Who now hath spent his Reason, and his Feares. Such a Confusion he is fallne into, He knowes not what to shunne, nor what to doe. So in rais'd Seas, when that the angry wind Threatens destruction to that daring kind, Who to a flying house themselves commit, (Seeming at once to flye too from their wit.) The well-stor'd passenger, (when he does find That all this fury of the wave and wind Is for his Treasure) now resolves to dye: (Death is not so much fear'd as Poverty) And now resolves that he will venture on More losse, before that Resolution: He does from this unto that purpose skip, And now his minde more totters then his ship. Till after all this tedious, foolish strife, Which he shall save, his treasure, or his Life, He shall save neither; and thus being loath To hazard either, he does forfeit both And now she shall be Passive. O Fates sport! Hee'l now betray that should defend the Fort, Such Revolution did you ever see? Who earst was Iealous, will a Pander be. O Life thou most desir'd, and wretched thing! Thy love betrayd his love, from thee did spring This Contradiction of crosse Faults, O why Chose he not rather to doe well, and Dye? Why did he so desire to shunne his Friend, And call that Misery, which was an End? The Dead doe feare no Ravisher, no Lust Was ere so hot, to dote upon cold dust, Were he once dead he should feare no crimes then, Neither his owne, nor those of other men: And could he wish a longer life: let those Who doe not know (but by inflicting) woes, Hugg that desire, but he who wisely waighs What many miseries are in many dayes, Let him not be so mad to wish his feares, And onely prove his Dotage by his Yeares. Never did Morning blush so much as that Which next appear'd; when up our Levite gat, And running nimbly to the doore, he sees His love before the doore with her faire knees Growne to the Earth, so close, that one would feare, She tooke a measure of her Sepulcher, With hands out stretch'd, as if, fearing to faile, She meant to make a Sexton of her naile To dig her grave: or else (for who can tell?) Suspecting by her injuries an Hell Not to be farre, where such sinnes had a birth, She lay so close, to feele if it were Earth. He wonders at the posture, nor knowes why She had not chose to rest more easily. And now he will be satisfy'd, but she Had lost her tongue too, with her Chastity. He thinkes she sleepes, and therefore louder cryes, Why doe we dally here? Wake, and Arise. But let him cry on, she hath heard her last, Deafe to all sounds now, but the latest blast. And art thou dead, he cryes? what dead? with that You'd wonder which had beene alive, as flat He lay, and speechlesse glad of the same death, But that thicke sighes betray that he had breath: Which onely serves his Anger: now he hyes Home to mount Ephraim all his jelousies Are dead with her, and now he meanes to make Her common after death: each Tribe shall take A peice of her; O the obdurate mind That so could part, what God had so combin'd! I faint in the relating it, {illeg.}well What he durst act, dare undertake to tell. Twelve made of one? O who would not be mad, To thinke upon that madnesse? if she had But such another griefe, with both opprest, My Muse would the be dumbe, which now doth rest. Canto. II. The Argument. The twelve peices of his wife Cut out by the Levites knife, To the field to doe him right, Draw the angry Israelite. Abrahams Prayer, Heav'ns decree, Benjamins glad victory Twice repeated, doe prolong My story to a second song. Svch crimes amongst the Israelites? I feare Incredulous posterity will sweare Mine was the fault, and when they muse hereon They'l judge the Crime was in my Fiction, When Vice exceeds a Probability It gaines excuse, so that to sinne on high Is politicke offence, for he that shall Sinne so, is thought not to have sinn'd at all. 'Tis the corruption of the minds of men To judge the worst of actions, but 'tis when The fault is frequent, when the daily use Gives it at once, the guilt, and the excuse: But if a crime swell to the height of this, Murder, or Incest, or if any is Of fowler name; when man will man abuse, We doe absolve more gladly then accuse, Can it be possibly presum'd that they To whom the God of Jacob shew'd the way, Both of their feet and manners, who had seene His frequent Miracles, nay who had beene Part of the wonder too, so to have fell As to commit a greater Miracle? Sodom in Judah? now the Fable winnes Credit, and is out-acted by true sinnes: Report hath made Pygmalion to have lov'd That which he made, who by his Art was mov'd To palpable Idolatry, yet so At least he lov'd a woman in the show: Hee's fixt on his faire Image, so that one Would wonder which had beene the truer stone. Yet 'twas a Woman Image, so that I Wonder at's lucke, more then his vanity, A Painted Woman will cause love: I'me mov'd More, how he did obtaine, then why he lov'd, These doe affect what to obtaine is worst, What in the very thinking is accurst: In other loves the wife may barren prove, In this the barrennesse is in the Love, In other faults there have excuses beene, This hath no other Motive then the Sinne. And can this sinne be theirs? Yes know it can, Man forsakes God, and then he doates on man. But who did tutor them to this offence? For, though we find it in each conscience That we are naturally vicious, That ther's no true good in the best of us, That we pursue our ill, as drawne by Fate, Yet 'tis example does specificate, That teacheth us This sinne: 'tis mine owne Vice, But that I am more lost in Avarice, That I doe choose Adultery, or preferre The lustfull man before the Murtherer, I have from Præsident: and thus our ill Comes from the Patterne too, as from the Will. Egypt denyes to have an hand herein, (Egypt the house of bondage, not of sinne.) Their cruelty I heare, and which is odd, I reade that their chiefe sinne, is their chiefe god. They make their gardens heav'ns, and in each plant They find a Deity: If that any want Be in their fields, if thence they doe not gaine, It is their gods they want, and not their graine, Their superstition might issue hence. The Calfe, on which they plac'd their confidence, Which act this glory to them doth afford, They make themselves the beast which they ador'd Or did the Desart make them thus to stray, And cause them lose their Manners with the Way? Did those vast places, which wise Nature fram'd, Wherein wild man should by his feare be tam'd, His feare of wilder beasts, instruct these men, That there are beasts which are not in the Denne; And that when ever we neglect, or scanne The Lords commands; the Monster is the Man? No, these suspitions may suspected be, As farre from Truth, as they from Honesty: Egypt was free from this fault, and much lesse Can we impose it on the Wildernesse. They had no King: as well the fooles as wise Did all what did seeme right in their owne Eyes. And Sodomes crime seem'd right to some: to see When every man will his owne Monarch be, When all subjection is tane quite away, And the same man does governe and obey; How there is no obedience, nor rule, How every man like to the Horse and Mule, Which want the understanding of their bit, And neither have their owne nor Riders wit, Make a swift pace to Ruine. Giue me then Leave to admire, and pitty those poore men, Who thinke that Man should his owne Ruler be, And exercise Home-principality: Who in one speedy minute strangely doe What Alexander but aspir'd unto, Conquer all Kingdomes, which they affirme to be, No better then a well-nam'd Tyranny. Let me inquire of these, if they have read Any such crimes where people had an head? Let me inquire of men, as yet not wild, Whether they thinke th?selves Lords of their child? Whether their servants Masters? whether they Suppose that God did not make some t'obey? In Innocence there was Dominion, And the first man was the first Lord: that one King of the Creatures, whom for this none blames, He prov'd his Soveraignty by their Names. That he was his wives Soveraigne, in the Fall He fell not from his Monarchy, when all His Righteousnesse was vanish't, that remain'd, And so a knowledge of this truth he gain'd, (A truth he could not know had he still stood) We can be longer Powerfull then Good. Nay let us looke on Hell, and we shall see That there's a Prince of that obscurity. It is a torment such as Hell hath none, To want that order in confusion: That is the best; we may conclude from hence, That is in Hell, and was in Innocence. But I doe wonder at the fault so long That I deferre the punishment: my song Must to the Levite turne, or rather he No more a Song, but a sad Elegy. He having carv'd his Love, as you have heard, And done that act, which Hell and Furies fear'd; Sends a choice piece to every Tribe, to plead Their injuries, and tell why she is dead: Benjamin shall have one of them, lest he Might dare commit a crime, he durst not see, A severall messenger to each Tribe is sent: But he that unto Princely Judah went, Carying the head of the dismembred coarse, With such a voice which sorrow had mad hoarse, (Least he should rave too highly) thus beginnes! Is there an Heav'n? and can there be such sinnes. Stands the Earth still? me thinkes I hardly stand, Feeling the Seas inconstancy on Land. After this Act, why flowes the water more? Why does't not staine, which alwaies clear'd before? It is not Ayre we draw now, 'tis a breath Sent to infect us from the Land of Death: The Fire, whose office 'tis to warme and shine, Growes blacke and downewards, as it did repine To see the fact, and sheds a kinde of teares, Quenching his heat, because he cannot theirs. Can you behold these eyes without a teare? Can you with patience longer thinke they were, And are not the worlds wonder? yet I erre, It is Revenge, and not a Teare fits her: Let women weepe for women, then you shall Shew you have sorrow'd heartily, if all Doe sorrow which have injur'd her, and be Examples, as of Crimes so Misery. Gibeah 'twas (O'twas not Gibeah) Credit me not, beleeve not what I say, I scarce dare trust my selfe, and yet agen, Gibeah 'twas that did this Fact: and then He tells them all, what I before have wept; Now Judah stormes, and as a River kept From its owne course by Weares and Milles, if once It force a passage, hurryes or'e the stones, Sweepes all along with it, and so alone Without stormes makes an Inundation: Such was the peoples fury, they're so hot That they will punish what we credit not, And be as speedy as severe: but some Who loath'd the bloudy accents of the Drumme, Who thought no mischiefes of that foulnesse are, But that they gaine excuse, compar'd with warre, And warre with brethren; these, I say, of age The chiefe amongst them, doe oppose their rage, Exhort them to a temper: Stay, sayes one, And be advis'd before you be undone. Whence is this fury? why d'yee make such hast To doe that act which you'l repent as fast? Are any glad to fight? or can ought be Mother of warre, beside Necessity? Be not mistaken; brethren, take good heed, It is not Physicke frequently to bleed. He that for petty griefes incision makes Cannot be cur'd so often as he akes. Are then your sisters, daughters, wifes too chast? Or are you sorry that as yet no wast Deformes your richer grounds? or does it stirre An anger in you, that the souldier Mowes not your Fields? Poore men, do you lament That still you are as safe as innocent? We yet have Cities proudly situate, We yet have people: be it not in fate That your esteeme of both should be so cheape To wish those carcasses and these an Heape. Me thinkes our Iordan hath an happier pace, And flowes with greater majesty and grace In his owne naturall wave, then if the sword Should higher colour to his streames afford; Should paint and so deforme it: to mine eye A River's better then a Prodigy. But I desire, deere Countrymen, to know, Whose is the blood that we must lavish so? Perhaps the Philistins ambition Would to our Shiloh bring their Ascalon, And these you would encounter: or't may be Egypt still envying that you are free Intends a second bondage: or perchance Your daily conquer'd Enemies advance Their often flying ensignes, those at hand Possessors and destroyers of the Land; Whom God reserving for our future Pride, Left to our eyes as thornes, prickes to our side. No none of these, but all your swords intend, I grieve to speak't, the ruine of a friend: And all the sonnes of Israel doe presse That Israel may have a sonne the lesse. Joseph I've read suffer'd his brothers hate, (Joseph of neere acquaintance unto fate The mouth of Destiny,) they would kill him first But after sell him, to try which was worst: And yet no reason for this spleene appeares, But that his glory was beyond his years. To hate the yonger still is too much sinne, And after Joseph to spoile Benjamin. Hath twelve no mystery? doe ye ascribe Meerely to Chance, that there is no odd Tribe? Trust me my brethren, they doe injure God, Who say that he delights in what is odd: I thinke 'tis parity best pleaseth heav'n; And what is most just, loves what is most ev'n. Doe I excuse them then to please the time, And onely make an error of a Crime? Am I sinnes Advocate? farre he't from me To thinke so ill of Warre as Sodomy: For Sodomy I tearme it, Iustice calls That, fact; which never into action falls, If it hath past the license of the will: And their intent reacht to that height of ill; But whose intent? O pardon me, there be Benjamites spotlesse of that Infamy. Shall these be ioyn'd in punishment? a sinne You'd warre against, O doe not then beginne To act a greater, as if you would see Whether Injustice æquall'd Luxury? This madnesse was from Gibeah, 'tis true, Yet some doe more distast the crime, then you Even in that City: heare then my advice, And God shall prosper what you enterprize. Exhort them to doe justice, if that then They still be partiall to these guilty men, Their guilt is greatest, let them perish all And equall their offences with their fall. Thicke acclamations breake off his discourse, Theyle heare no more because they like't: Remorse Ceizeth each conscience, they already hate The civill warre, which they so wisht of late. Embassadors by generall voice are sent: But Benjamin conceits that to repent Were the worse sinne, and that who ere will doe A wicked act, he ought defend it too. But are not we true Benjamites in this, And aggravate what ere we doe amisse By a new act? as if the second deed Excus'd the former, if it did exceed. Did we not thus, an end were come to warre; Did we not thus, no more should private jarre Molest our peace; Kings might put up their swords, And every quarrell might conclude in words: One conference would root out all debate And they might then most love, who now most hate, The most sworne foes: for shew me, where is he Would seeke Revenge without an injury? A wrong receiv'd, or thought one? then no need But to deny, or to excuse the deed, Why is Defence? O what doe they intend Who justifie those acts, which they should mend! O Pride! O folly! O extreme disease! O Fact, which he condemnes who practises! Who in his soule confesseth he offends. And yet doubles his guilt when he not ends. Great crimes find greater patrons: impudence Followes each fault, to make us thinke that sense Hath fled us with our Vertue, and that men By such an hardnesse were turn'd stones agen. So wifes of Entertainment (who doe know More then one Husband) in the publicke: shew As vertuous as the best whilst undescry'd, Whilst they have this good left, that they will hide And veile o're their offences: but if once Either their husbands just suspicions, Or their security betray their fact, No more doe blush to answere, then to act, As if 'twere meritorious, and so, did Appeare no sinne no longer then 'twas hid. Why should the bad be bold? why should there be Audaciousnesse joyn'd to impiety? Whence is this daring? Sinne was child to Night, How dares he then approach and blast the light? How dares he stand th'examining, and try If men can find out his deformity? I have the reason, we are flatterers all, And to our selves the most; if any fall Into grosse errors, still he thinkes hee's free, And Pride supplies the place of honesty. He thinkes tis good to have a vertuous name, And cares not for the goodnesse, but the fame. Which makes the Benjamites reply: we admire (To say no more) at your so strange desire. And at the craft on't most, that you pretend Love and advice, when you subjection send: Are we so stupid, and so senslesse growne As to be thought not fit to rule our owne? Benjamin was the youngest we confesse Of Jacobs sonnes, and yet a sonne, no lesse Then Levi, or proud Judah: he that gave Life to each Tribe, intended none a slave, Nor shall you make us. But youle say that you Out of a generall love to goodnesse sue For justice 'gainst her Enemies, Tis poore If what we would we cannot cover o're With specious pretences: tis an ill Physitians part so to betray his pill, That children may perceive its want of dresse, And chuse disease before seene bitternesse; But let me tell you, who so ere do's deale, In the affaires of a strange common-weale, Is tyrannous or mad: he would be knowne Either anothers Lord, or's not his owne. Yet what is't your grave Masters doe advise Our sleepy Councell of? whose duller Eyes See onely open vices: we have heard The Levite and his Concubine, we feard You'd have us punish him: then you relate That comming unto Gibeah some thing late, And willing to depart the earlier thence, He found his Chast one dead: O dire offence! She had the punishment she deserv'd, and just It was, that who had liv'd should dye by Lust. And yet for feare Levits in time to come Might want such easie favourites, and some Would leaue their courteous trade, if there be found No cure, no remedy for such a wound: We are content to be severe: but then We doe expect, you name those guilty men. Our's the more hard and thanklesse taske I trow, For we will punish those whom you but show. These mockes doe whet the Isra'elites so farre, Nothing remaines now but a civill warre: When all the Tribes have unto Mispah ran, With such consent you'd thinke they were one man. If warre had ever reason, or if men Had ere authority to kill others, then Certainely these, in so divine a cause, Twas not the peoples quarrell, but the Lawes. Here no ambition, no untam'd desire Of Principality, of growing higher, Put on these Armes, nor was it fault enough That Benjamin was rich, to raise these rough Spirits of Mars, nor is't a true surmise That private wrongs did cause these Enemies: These fight the battel of the Lord, herein Iustice on the one side fights, on th'other Sinne: So that in height of blood, heat of the warres, They rather Iudges are, then Souldiers. The Israelites if they now spare, are shent, The more they kill, the more they're innocent. Our Age makes us againe these actions see, An Age of warre, though not of victory. For 'tis not victory to winne the Field, Vnlesse we make our Enemies to yeeld More to our Iustice, then our Force, and so As well instruct as overcome our Foe Call you that Conquest, or a Theft of State, When in a Stranger region of late, The Eagle built his nest, having expell'd (Vpon a meere pretence that he rebell'd) The former Ayry, for no other cause, But that his bill was strong, and sharpe his clawes. To see the malice, and the power of hate, That made ev'n the Elector Reprobate. When Cæsar did not sticke, nor blush to doe What they detested, who advis'd him too, When that all lawes their ancient force might loose, He made a Choyce of him that was to Choose. Now all occasions can perswade to fight, When Power is misinterpreted for Right. There is a Lust of killing men so great, Rivers of blood can scarce asswage the heat Our lives are cheaper then the lives of beasts, Then those whose very being is for feasts; Who have no use but for the throat: hard plight! Anger not kills them, but our appetite If we have eaten once, we spare: and then If we are full are kind: but to kill men We have a lasting appetite, shedding blood, Our famine is increas'd ev'n by our food: Such Erisichthons are we; they that have Vnlimited desires, Death and the Grave But shadow this affection, and to it Compar'd, the Horse-leach wants an Appetite: It may be weighing mans high faculties (Which make him claime a kinred with the skies) Wee seeme to doubt of his mortality And onely strive to know if he can die. Nor doe we care on what pretence (lest ought Should make our crime the lesse) no reason's sought To mitigate our fault, and we are thus So farre from good, we scarce are cautelous. But 'tis a sore will fester, if you touch, Away my Muse, sometimes a truth's too much For Honour, or for safety: he alone Prospers who flatters. But if any one Shall aske a colour, a pretence for this How such a multitude, such a swarme is Assembled of the Israelites (for then There met at once foure hundred thousand men Against their brother Benjamin,) whilst yet They had not dispossest the Canaanite, (There was a mixture not a Conquest made) How durst they then so foolishly invade Their brethrens Countrey, when they left their owne Subject to imminent destruction? Or when was this invasion made? To me The Number hath a more Facility For credit, then the Time; doe we not finde, That Israel wanting Iudges was assignde To bondage, as to Anarchy? they groane Vnder a forraigne yoake, wanting their owne. Carries it any likelyhood; or can It sincke into the fancy of a man, That when they were opprest, they should oppresse? As full of folly as of savagenesse: This were to perfect Eglons victory, And act what Jabin but desir'd should be. And yet it might be, Joshua being dead, Then was the time, the people lack'd an head: Who taking no care for posterity, Twas the worst act of Joshua to dye. Moses deputed him, and if that he Had left another Governor, it might be Our Levite had beene chast, and Benjamin Beene noted for his vertue; not his sinne. Then were those multitudes no miracle, And Canaan so oft beat by Israel, In likelihood would rest quiet, and expect If these would doe what they could not effect. Besides, their dwellings in the Valleys be So that their seat teaches humilitie: And then to climbe the mountaines was such paine As that the labour did exceed the gaine. And thus you see, that they may fight, but ere Their enemies Countries by them wasted were, They to the Oracle repaire, to know If victory shall grace them, or their Foe. Yet pardon me, I erre, they are so strong As that they would imagine it a wrong Done to their valor, if we should suppose, That they intreated conquest of their foes; No, being sure of victory, they aske Which of the Tribes shall undertake the taske Of the first onset, and the Tribes refus'd, Envy at Judahs choyce, as if abus'd, And injur'd they esteem'd themselves, that they Should lose the dangerous honour of the day. Such was their pride, such thoughts their Numbers bred; Numbers, whose feare might strike the Enemy, dead: Whose hands deserv'd a fiercer Enemy, And matter of an higher victory. With these they think, they might to Memphis passe, And make the Egyptians know, what bondage was. VVith these they thought with ease to force a VVay (Though nature did oppose) to India. And in a sawcy victory out-runne, The primitive uprising of the Sunne. How large are our desires? and yet how few Events are answerable? So the dew VVhich early on the top of mountaines stood (Meaning at least to imitate a flood) VVhen once the Sunne appeares, appeares no more, And leaves that parch'd, which was too moist before. That we are never wholy good! that still Mixt with our Vertue, is some spice of ill! The Israelites are Iust, but they are Proud, As if a lesser fault might be allowd For punishing the greater; yet I'de know VVhilst yet they might suffer an overthrow, VVhy they rejoyce as if th'ad wonne! or why They have a Pride ere they have Certainty? Their numbers are incredible, 'tis true, Yet multitudes have beene orecome by few: Their army is compleat, 'tis right, but then VVe know it is an army but of men. Of future carkasses, so quickly some They have no time to thinke of death to come: To whom no starre a certainty does give, That they at least to the next Field should live. Foure hundred thousand carkasses; enough To give the beasts a surfet, and allow Fertility which Nature had deny'd Vnto those Lands: So that their height of pride, Of hope, of glory, and of all their toyle Is to inrich the Land which they would spoile. So thought the Benjamites, who though they saw That Pow'r too was against them with the Law, Yet resolutely they intend to die, And such despaire gives them the victory. They are not Cowards, yet, though they are bad, They slay more numbers then wee'l thinke they had. Whence comes this Courage to the Desperate? The bad me thinkes should be effeminate, And as the Bees (the subject or the King) Having abus'd it once, doe loose their sting: And to inforce a Stoick unto laughter, Being once too fierce, they are alwaies sluggish after Converted unto Droanes, so it seemes fit (And not so much heavens Iustice, as its wit) That who hath lost his Vertue once, should straight Lose courage too, opprest with his owne weight. The Israelites though amaz'd at this defeat, Yet gather head, and to their Campe retreate; There might you see Sorrow and Anger joyn'd, Nor doe they grieve so much as they repin'd. Here fathers weepe their onely sonnes, and there Brothers for as deare losses dropp a teare, Accompany'd with threatnings, they are mad Till they bestow the sorrow which they had. Once more to Shiloh they repaire, to heare If God at last will aide them, and for feare That it was pride did frustrate their first sute, They're now as humble, as then resolute: In stead of fighting they now weepe a day, Sighes they doe thinke and teares can make a way Where swords are uselesse, they'l gaine victory No longer by their hand, but by their Eye, Great and just God, sayes one, we doe confesse That all this heavy anger is farre lesse Then our deservings: should'st thou fully weigh Our sinnes enormity, 'tis not a day Losse to the Foe, can expiate: did we feele What ere we saw in Ægypt, did the steele Peirce deeper in our bowells, should the skes Shed those hot showers in which Gomorrah fryes, We could not taxe the Iustice of our King, But after all, owe still a suffering. Yet thou hast ancient mercies, we've beene told Of all thy courtesies, which were of old Shew'd to our Fathers; O vouchsafe them still, And make us heires of those: we have done ill, Prodigiously ill, there's no offence Which we are guiltlesse of, each conscience Accuseth, and amazeth us: yet now Our flinty hearts to a repentance bow: Yet now at last vouchsafe thy favour to us, And as thy rod hath scourg'd, let mercy wooe us; We dare not looke for victory: O no, Give us at leastwise a more vertuous Foe. Thy wrath is just, great God, and 'tis our sute Onely just men thy wrath may execute. We beg not for our lives, they are thy loane Which when thou wilt receive, yet as thine owne. Let not their swords bereave us of our breath, And we shall find a benefit in death. Yet what a glory can it be to thee That we are dead? and that the Heathen see Thy anger on thy Children? that thy wrath Instead of being left, is told in Gath, And publisht in fierce Ascalon; spare us then If not for us, yet for thy selfe; and when Thou think'st of plaguing us, thy selfe exempt, Since that our Ruine will breed thy contempt: Let then thy mercy above justice shine; If we are bad, consider we are thine. Thus grumbled they a pray'r: and he that sees Councells unhatchd, and what he will, decrees, (Yet ever justly) does perceive that they VVhat ere they faine, doe murmur, and not pray. VVhich he decrees to punish: they would know VVhether that once more they shall fight or no? Once more he grants that they shall fight: and thus They're not so craving, as he Courteous. If they but aske him, he will not deny, Fight's their desire, and then his answere's, I. Had they but ask'd the victorie, as well, He would have heard his troubled Israel: He that deliver'd them from forraine armes, And taught their weake hands to repaire their harms VVith admirable victory, He I say VVould have bestow'd the honor of the day On them, had they desir'd it; they have knowne How he hath warr'd for th? from heaven, &amp; showne Such miracles in their defence, they fright Those whom they save, as when the wondring night Thought herselfe banisht from the world (the Sunne Standing unmov'd, forgetting how to runne,) If they now lose the day, the fault is theirs, God does no mercy want, they want right prayers. But they suppose it too too fond to stand Begging of that which is in their owne hand. This they conceive were to mocke God, to crave That to be giv'n which they already have, A pow'r to use their armes: No, if once more They may have field-roome, may but fight it o're, Though Heav'n doe not fight for them, they suppose They cannot lose, if Heav'n doe not oppose. They thinke no chance can possibly bestow The foile on them, the Lawrell on the foe. What though they lost the praise of the first day, And fought as though they came to runne-away: Twas not for want of courage sure, but either The foe had got advantage of the weather Or else the wind had rais'd the dust so high That they suppos'd fresh enemies to be nigh, And fear'd to be environ'd round: what ere Occasion'd their first overthrow, no feare, No chance, shall cause another; and the slaves That now triumph, shall find their trenches, graves. Is this their Crime alone, or doe not all Partake as of their fault, so of their fall? Israel is not onely mad, there be Some vices which we give posterity, And this is one of them: O how vaine is man! O how his Reason too is but a spanne, And not his stature or his Age! we have long Injur'd the beasts, and done them too much wrong, By calling them Irrationall; could they speake, Thus in rough language, they would fiercely breake Their mind unto us: O you onely wise To whom kind Nature hath imparted Eyes, Leaving all other blind; pardon if we Doe tell you where you have forgot to see, Where we are clearer sighted: can you show Where ever beasts did to that madnesse grow, As to pronounce of that, which is to come, Of that which onely seemes in Chances doome? Yet thus you doe; and doing thus have showne; Reason's your title, our Possession. The Israelites had to their cost of late Found confidence to be unfortunate; (Their confidence in Numbers) and yet still (Though now contain'd in smaller roome) they will Forespeake their victory: why, because they see That they are many yet; poore vanity! When they were more, they were o'recome, yet dare Conceive a Conquest when they fewer are; Because still some are to be kill'd: as though Successe to Multitudes did homage owe, And multitudes impair'd: as if the way To winne another were to lose one day. But had we seene the City now! what joy Raign'd in those streets, sufficient to destroy Those whom it comforted (for pleasue too Can find a way to death, and strangely doe The worke of heavinesse and griefe) I say Had we but seene the glory of that day: The whooping, dancing, and the generall noyse To which the sea and thunder are but toyes; We should have thought it (so the sounds agree,) No noise of Triumph, but Captivity. At last they doe repose themselves, and one Of highest judgement and discretion, Instructs them thus: My dearest Countrymen, Who ere intends his private ends, does pen A speech unto the Eare, his study is Which words so?d wel, &amp; which are thought amisse, He tryes all wayes, he layes all colours on To cheat the Iudgement, sooth the Passion, So that he hopes at last that it must hit Either the subject, or the clothing it: But I whose end is Publike good, intend Nothing but that which caryes to that end: Pardon me then if I am harsh, and round, If that I am not Plausible, but found. We wonne a victory last day, so great We hardly dare beleeve we were not beate: Our conquest easier was then our beleife; And with great reason too: fortell, what chiefe, What petty captaine is so vaine, so mad As to ascribe to his conduct the glad Event of last dayes hazard? to my sense The Conqueror was onely Providence, And we but instruments: then I'de advise That as you have beene happy, you'd be wise: That man does still in greatest glory stand, Whose braine is better thought of then his hand; And so I wish that yours should be: we know That what is gain'd by Fortune is lost so, She hath no constant Favorite; then now Whilst yet our victory does meanes allow To purchase peace at our owne rate, and thrive By Covenant more then Battle: let us drive All thought of warre farre from us, tis in vaine To get that hardly, which we may obtaine By easier meanes, and he does more then rave Who hazards that which he may certaine have. More was he speaking, when a thousand tongues Made his be silent, one would thinke their lunges To be unequall to that noyse, so fierce Their clamor is, such sounds the heavens doe peirce. So have I oft heard in our Theater (When that a daintier passage wan the Eare) A thousand tongues, a thousand hands rebound, (As if the Plaudite were in the sound, And most noise were most pleasing:) they expresse Their liking so, as these their frowardnesse. Who rave from noise to action, one stoopes downe, To reach a stone, another fiercer clowne Shakes a steel'd Iavelin at him, all the hands, Against which Israel but weakely stands, Ayme now at one; who dreadlesse, unimpair'd In courage, neither wisht life, nor despair'd. At last a serious Counceller stood up; Much had he tasted of the liberall Cup, And thankefully exprest it in his face, To which a larger wound would be a grace By hiding his rich pimples: This brave man Raises himselfe, and with what speed he can Stutters thus to them; Cease my noble boyes, Quiet your threatnings now, and stint your noyse. Tis a just anger you have showne, but yet The time in which you shew it is unfit. Now should we dance, my bloods, now should we sing, And make the wondring firmament to ring With joyfull acclamations; now brave spirits To shew the most joy, is to shew most merits. Sadnesse is onely Capitall: in fine, Now should we shed no blood but of the vine. For you Sir whom we doubly guilty see, Of Treason first, and then Philosophy, If these doe please, thus we pronounce: to shew How little we doe feare you, or the Foe, Wee'l send you first unto their campe, and then Wee'l fetch you by our conquest home agen. This is a mercy if well understood, You shall injoy the fortune you thinke good. Here his breath failes: when all the people cry He hath spoke nobly, none this day shall dye. And yet the Traitor shall not scape at last, Whose execution is deferr'd, not past. Twas neither peace, nor warre now, either side Having sufficiently their forces try'd, Take breath a while: O happy men, if still This mind continue in them! If they kill Their appetite of killing! if this rest Can at the last informe them what is best! To bury their slaine friends, both sides agree Vnto a two dayes truce: Stupiditie Not to be borne with! had they knowne the use At first of that which they now call a truce, This truce had beene unnecessary, then They might have spar'd, whilst now they bury men. And that they now may bury, they intreat Respite a while from warre: thus all their heate Is buried for the time: good heav'n to see Th'Omnipotency of Necessity, Whom all the nearest ties of Neighbourhood, Religion, Language, nay of the same Blood Could not containe from fight, but that they would (To see if it were theirs) shed their owne blood, These are intreated to a forme of peace, Their fury for a day or two can cease, Commanded by Necessity: they feare Lest th'Ayre by so much carcasse poysoned were: Lest to revenge the blood which they had shed, They now might feele the valour of the dead, Of strong corrupti?: these thoughts hold their mind These thoughts a while inforce them to be kind On both sides (for they doe not jarre in all) Nature prevailes not, but a Funerall, Nor doth this long prevaile, for when they had Interr'd some carcasses, they yet are mad Till they have made some more, till they have done A second fault, as not content with one, They see their Error, and commit it, thus Who are not eminently vertuous, Are easily entrapp'd in vices snares, And want the poore excuse, that unawares They were ingag'd; we greedily runne on Offending with Deliberation. And can you call this but Infirmity? Nick-name a Vice? O call it Prodigy. Call it—O what? What name can well expresse The miracle of humane guiltinesse? Could he pretend an ignorance at least And be in Nature as in Fact a beast, He were not worse then they, then he might be Both from the Vse and fault of Reason free. But what new horror ceizeth me? what fire Raignes in my thoughts, &amp; prompts me to rise higher Hence you low soules, who groveling on the Earth Basely deject your selves below your birth, Sold to your senses: I intend to tell What none can know but in whose breasts doe dwell Cœlestiall fires, and unto whom 'tis given To have a neerer intercourse with Heav'n. Yet pardon you pure soules, whom no one dares Eas'd of our flesh, to trouble with our cares: Pardon I once more aske, if my weake pen Fitting it selfe to ordinary men, Attaine not to your height (to us unknowne) And give you those words which you shame to owne. The Lawgiver, who saw as in a glasse All in the Word, what ever 'twas did passe In these neer enmities, as farre as Man Perfectly happy knowes a griefe, began To feele Compassion: Have I then said he Deliver'd Israel for this misery? And did I free them from the Ægyptian Onely to find them graves in Canaan? I did foretell their Land shall overflow, But never thought to be expounded so; Never with bloud: I meant that they should have More blessings then the covetous can crave, The flowing Vdder, and the untir'd Bee, An happy Deluge of Fertility. O how would now proud Pharaoh rejoyce! How he would have a joy beyond a voyce, Beyond his tyranny, could he but know What Israel does indure without a Foe! Was it for this I did so oft repeat Wonders before him, wonders of so great Exuberance of powre, so highly done, That they contemne all admiration? How wert thou Nilus bloody'd into Red, Thy waters as unknowne as is thy Head? When all thy finny progeny did find That to destroy now, which did breed their kind, When by a nimble death they understand, The River as discourteous as the Land? Can I forget that when I did bestow A liberty as heretofore to flow Vnto thy now pale waters, there did passe An issue stranger then his Colour was From the too fertil river? Frogges are found With such a multitude to hide the ground That there's no grasse appeares, no corne is seene. The spring does blush because he lookes not greene. Their numbers and their noise equally harsh Make Egypt not a Region but a Marsh. What a small portion of my acts where these? How scarcely to be counted passages In my large story? Dust is chang'd to Lice And now beginnes to creepe, which the most nice And curious eye before could never find To move at all, unlesse't were by the winde: Which could not scatter those thicke clouds of Flyes That would not let them, no, not see the skyes. When I but threaten, all the cattle dye, And Egypts Gods find a Mortality. But lest the men should thinke that they were free From the fault too, if the Calamity, I taught their bodies with blacke goare to runne, And imitate their soules corruption. What was a Face, is now a pimple growne, And in each part is plentifully sowne A store of blaines, so ugly, that to me It was a kind of Iudgement but to see. And if this were but little, was't not I That call'd those candy'd pellets from the sky, Which in a moment overwhelming all Did badly change their colour in their fall: And by the murthering every one they found Within their reach came red unto the ground? When to repaire the numbers they had slaine (Beasts of all sorts) the land is fill'd againe, But tis with Locusts, such a swarme they see Made for the shame of all their Husbandry, That they could wish, so they were rid of these, The former Murrein, ere this new increase. But who can tell the following Prodigy? Last day the Earth was hid, but now the sky Chaos returnes, the Sunne hath lost his rayes And Nights obscurity is turn'd to Dayes. Who could a greater miracle afford? God made the Light, I Darknesse by a Word, Which had it lasted, had it ne'r beene spent, They would have call'd it a kind punishment, They had not seene then their first borne to dy, To challenge death by their Nativity: All this I did, but why? was it to see My people suffer fuller misery? To gaine the Country which they could not hold, From which their owne armes ignorantly bold Expell their owne selves: O let no man tell That Israel did banish Israel. My prayers forbid, nor let it ere be said That Moses was unkind since he was dead, That in the grave I left my goodnesse too; And could not pity when not feele a woe. Having said this, with all the speed he may He seekes out holy Abraham, who that day, By his deere Isaac seconded did sing The ancient mercies of their heavenly King. One tells how having now worne out a life, And so being fitter for his Grave then Wife, Nay then when she had liv'd unto those yeares, To be accounted with the Grandmothers, When Sara now was so unweildy growne, Her legges could scarcely beare her selfe alone, She beares another burthen, and does swell Not with a child, but with a Miracle. This said, he stops; and then againe goes on No more with story, but Devotion. O praise the Lord my soule, let me not find My body was more fruitfull then my mind. O let that teeme with thankefulnes, and be Made sweetly pregnant by my memory. Father, sayes Isaac, I have often heard That we doe tell with Ioy what we have Feard, And what in suffering terrifies our sense, Does in relating please: what violence Of blisse possesseth me when I compare My dangers past with joyes that present are! Methinkes I yet carry that fatall wood (A burden which I hardly understood Should carry me) me thinkes I still enquire Where is the sacrifice, and where the fire? How little did I thinke, or feare till then That God commanded sacrifice of men! How little could I guesse in any part That God in such sort did desire the Heart? Yet pardon Father, if you now must know, Your silence seem'd more cruell then your blow: Could I oppose my mind against your will, Or wish him spar'd, whom you decreed to kill? Wherefore was as all this circumstance? what need But first to tell, and then to act the deed? I never knew what disobedience meant. And your distrust was my worst punishment, I must confesse I was amaz'd, my blood Congeal'd within me, and my faint haires stood Yet not for feare of death (Death was my profit) But for the manner and the Author of it. Was this the heav'nly promise? and must I So strangely borne, somewhat more strangely die? What should I say now? or what should I doe? That frustrate by my death Gods promise too. Should I invoke Heav'ns ayde? alas, from thence Came the injunction for this violence: Should I implore my fathers helpe? why, he Would sooner hearken unto heav'n then me. And so he did: for when the trembling sword As if he knew the temper of his Lord Theatned a death, most fortunately then He that did arme you did disarme agen; Shewing your will was all he did require, Commanding you to that you most desire, To be againe a Father: O the power And mercy of our God! who in an houre, Who in a minute, can make all things well, Can bring and then deliver out of Hell. These were their Accents, when that Moses sayes, It is an holy businesse to praise, To magnifie our Lord, so to goe on In the intent of our Creation. To this all times, all reasons doe obey, And we may praise as often as we pray. But now let's change these tones, let us be mute In all discourses now, but in a suite; Let us at once conjoyne our prayers, and see If our one God will hearken unto three. Your issue, and my charge, whom I have led Thorow those paths that never man did tread. (As if they fear'd a scarcity of foes) Doe their owne selves against themselves oppose, And their destruction (unlesse we repaire Sooner to ayde them) will prevent our pray'r. It was a place above the Ayre, the Sky, Whither Man cannot reach, not with his Eye, Nay if th'exactnesse of the height be sought, Whither Man cannot reach, not with his thought. Beyond the place where haile, and raine doe growe, Above the chill-white treasures of the snow; To which compar'd the starry heav'n is fell Vnto a neerer neighbourhood with Hell. And when I shall of Gods abode intreat It does become his prospect, not his seat. To which compar'd, the Chrystall heav'n does meet With Earth, to be a stoole unto his feet, This was the Place (yet pardon 'twas not so, Places are things which onely bodies know, Our bounds of Ayre, from which the heav'ns are free As from Corruption and Mortality) But here it was His sacred throne did stand, Who with a word created Sea and Land: Who with a word was Maker of his Throne, Who till he made it never wanted one. Bring me the richest goldsmiths treasuries (Those baites that doe allure our hearts and eyes) The dusky Sapphire, the Pearle richly white, The sparkling Diamond, yellow Chrysolite, Or if there be a gemme Nature hath fram'd, Of so high price that Art hath never nam'd, Ransacke the Inga's tombes, where there doth lie With their corrupted dust their treasury: (Who to that pretty bounty doe attaine That they bestow their gold on earth againe.) Search me their graves, or if you fearfull be Of treasure guarded by Mortality, Rob all the mines fenc't with so many barres, (Where Nature in the Earth hath fancy'd starres, Whose luster lest our weaknesse cannot beare Her kinder wisedome made her store up there) Bring these unto the view, to an exact Figure, which Phidias durst call his act: Yet to this throne compar'd, it will appeare So farre from shining, it will scarce looke cleare. Here does the Ancient of dayes disclose The glory of his Majesty to those To whom he daignes his presence, who enjoy At full, what would a weaker eye destroy: Whose blisse shall never have a period, Who therefore live because they see their God, How could I ever linger, ever dwell In this so blest Relation! O how well Should I esteeme my selfe entranc'd; if I By staying here should lose my History! Here thousand thousands wait upon his call Of humane servants, and Angelicall, And such a multitude invest his throne (Millions of Spirits waiting upon One,) That it may be we should not say amisse, Their Number stranger then their Nature is: Here sound the Hallelujahs, here the Quire Of Heav'n is high, and full as their desire: No voice is here untun'd, they doe not find A jarre, more in the sound, then in the mind. Their power of singing growes on with their song; And they can longer sing, because thus long; Thus here themselves they fully strengthned see, To a melodious eternitie. Here Abraham presents himselfe; and sayes O thou above the injury of Dayes; Who making Times art subject unto none, Who giv'st all knowledge, and art never knowne; Who in my dayes of flesh didst gladly lend An eare unto my suite, and wouldst not bend Thy plagues against thine enemies, untill I knew th'intent, and thou hadst askt my will, The will of me poore mortall, nay farre worse Of me a sinner then, the ancient curse Stucke deeply in me, that I might have feard My faults, and not my pray'r should have been heard: Could I speake then, and am I silent now? Did Sodom move, and cannot Israel bow? O pardon me if I bewaile their state, If I their Father prove their Advocate, Didst not thou promise when I had giv'n ore All hope of Father, when I wisht no more Then a contented Grave, that then from me, Should come so numerous a progeny: That all the cleerer army of the sky And the thicke sands which still unnumbred lye Should come within account before my seed, Which not my Sara, but thy truth should breed? How oft I thought that promise did include Their lasting too as well as multitude; That their continuance should be as sure, As long as either sands or starres indure. If they have sinn'd, thou know'st they may repent And be the better by a punishment, Never by Ruine: O then use thy rod Thinke that they are thy People, thou their God, And if they are so, O then let not be Any more strife, but who shall most serve thee, If they are so, let Abraham once more Receive those children which thou gav'st before. Now they have left their heav'nly ecchoing, Now all the Quire does wonder and not sing, When from th'eternall Majesty are heard Speeches, which all but the dread Speaker fear'd. Am I as Man that I should change? or like The sonne of man to threaten and not strike? If I pronounce my wrath against a Land Shall that continue, and my word not stand? If I doe whet a sword, shall it be blunt, And have no direr sharpnesse then t'was wont? Benjamins crime h'as such an horror in't, (Who have confirm'd their faces like a flint Against all dye of modesty) that till Their blood (which now their too hot veines doe fill) Flow in their fields, till that their numbers be Of as small note as is their Chastity, It shall not be remitted: yet to show That I can pay that which I doe not owe, A remnant shall escape: but for the rest, (Those other Tribes which boast they are the best.) And yet to verifie their goodnesse lesse; Speake, as if they were injur'd by successe, So making the fault mine: who therefore have Beene lib'rall benefactors to the grave By their thicke deaths: untill that I doe see A confirm'd truth of their humility, They shall not see a victory: Ile make Benjamin punish these, and after take Vengeance on the Revengers, till they see My mercy hath not spent mine Æquity. This I pronounce, this is my constant will. Now all the holy company doe fill The heav'ns with shouts of praise, and loudly cry All Honor, Glory, Power to the most High. But now the Israelites once more have brought, Their troopes into the field, once more have fought; And whether 'twas the fault of them that led, Or of the Soldier, once more they have fled: And now because their battle was not long I will not be more tedious in my Song. Canto. III. The Argument. The Levites vision, Phineah's Prayer, The Israelites late caus'd despaire Now turn'd to courage, when by them A new invented stratagem Drawes the enemy from the walls, Untill within their net he falls, With the full righting of the wrong Does both conclude, and crowne my Song. When will Vice faile? wh? shall we see th'event Of wicked acts as bad as the Intent? As yet the worst are prosperous, and worse, The good as yet have never miss'd their curse: Review the Levites wife, and you shall see When she had forfeited her honesty, Her father entertain'd her; but once more When she was come to what she left before, Her Lord and Vertue, when that all her strife Shall be to gaine the name of a good wife, Gibeah will not harbour her; O poore! Gibeah were guiltlesse had it done no more: But Gibeah will murder her; review The Campe awhile, and that th'campe is true Which was in her; Twice had that army try'd The valour of their enemies, and twice dy'd The fields with their best blood, so hardly crost That they have fought no oftner then th'have lost: And yet their cause was best: neither were they The onely people which have lost the day, Which they deserv'd to winne: search the records Of every Age, and every Age affords Examples of like strangenesse: who can tell What the Assyrian did to Jsrael? How in despite of all their lofty towers, (Which hop'd a standing to the last of hours) He made one houre their last: unlucky howre, Where vice shew'd what't could do when it had power. The sword did sport with lifes, nor were they such Whose losse or preservation did not much Pertaine unto the State: but the Kings sonnes In the same time, the same Pavilions, By the same tyrant are inforc'd to die, And which exceeds all, in their father eye. Poore Zedekiahs kingdomes first is gone And then his heyre's, O harsh inversion If he had lost them first, it might be thought His kingdomes losse would not have mov'd him ought He would have made the best of th'other crosse Esteeming it an easing, not a losse. As he might now to be depriv'd of sight When he should covet the kind screene of Night, Betweene his woes and him: if in his mind He saw, it was a blessing to be blind: That then he should be forc't to see no more When he could not see what he saw before, This Israel suffer'd, and this Ashur did, And yet I dare affirme it was not hid No not from Ashur ev'n in his owne doome That they were better who were overcome, Or if the goodnesse to his side he drawes, 'Tis that his sword was better, not his cause I could goe on in presidents as true, Actions betweene the Heathen and the Iew, Betweene the Turke and Christian: but what need To shew there is no birth without a seed? No speech without a tongue? or if there be More truths of such knowne perspicuity. How doe they doate then, who would tye the Lord To be so ayding to his childrens sword, As that he ne're should use his owne, nor doe Any one act, but what they wish him too? Are they so good? or is his love so fond As of a courtesie to make a bond? Shall they indent with him? and say thus farre Thou maist correct, but if thy judgements are Of longer date, they are unjust? for shame (All ye that glory in a purer Name,) Hence those blasphemous thoughts, far hence remove, Lest they deserve the plagues they would reprove. Is it injustice to suppresse our pride, To bring unto our eyes what we would hide, Ev'n from our selves, our close deformities? Or, may not God, to shew how he does prize His servants labours, make them thus appeare, As does the Sunne after a cloud, more cleare? His judgement certainly wee'l say's too quicke, Who'l prove one bad because he sees him sicke; These judgements are diseases, and bestow'd At pleasure, and not where they most are owd: Yet due they are where ever they are found, Since there are none so Catholikely sound, But in a word, but in a thought have strayd, Perhaps in those Afflictions, when th'ave wayd Their deeds and suffrings, which they thinke to be Of farre more rigor then Æquality. Then courage noble Countrymen, nor feare, Though you should want successe a while, to reare Your names up to your ancestors, (who did Those acts which now were better to be hid: Lest that they should upbraid us) doe not feare That Spaine is neerer the Almighties Eare Then our devotions: he that could bestow A victory after a second blow Vpon the doubting Israelites, can still Create our better hopes ev'n out of ill. Or if he doe not, if he have decreed That our just plague shall be their unjust deed: That Israel shall be once more overcome, And David flie away from Absalom: Yet let this glad us in our chiefest woe, Man may be good and yet unhappy too. Now are they truly humbled, now although No curious eye could guesse their overthrow When he had seene their numbers, yet at length They will rely upon another strength, Or if to numbers they will trust agen, 'Tis to Gods numerous mercies, not their men. He can deliver (they have seene) by few, And they doe thinke it possible and true That he can help by many too, they find Without him all their actions full of wind, Of emptinesse, and with him they not doubt To be as well victorious as devout, Now Pride hath left them, now they goodnesse yeeld, Now have they lost their vices with the field. Such holy lessons doe misfortunes teach, Which make our once bad thoughts bravely to reach At Heav'n and glory: if you marke it well Whilst yet it was a populous Israel It was a proud one too, but when that now God lookes upon them with an angry brow, When all their troopes halfe weary and halfe sicke, Are growne to easier Arithmeticke, Th'are truly penitent; hence we may see The pow'r, the good pow'r of Adversitie, W'are bad if we are happy, if it please Heav'n to indow us with a little ease, If riches doe increase, untill our store Meet our desires, till we can wish no more, If that our garners swell (untill they feare Ruine from that with which they furnisht were) We but abuse these benefits: our Peace Brings forth but factions, if that strangers cease To give us the affront; our selves will be Both the defendant, and the Enemy. Our riches are our snares, which being giv'n, To man, to make a purchase of the heav'n, We buy our ruine with them, the abuse Is double, in the getting, and the use, So that our summes unto such heaps are growne When Avarice succeeds Oppression. In briefe, our garners so well stuff'd, so cramm'd, Detaine our Corne, as if that it were damn'd, To everlasting prison, none appeares, And thus we give dearth to the fruitfull yeares: Being to such a proud rebellion growne, Famine is not heav'ns judgement but our owne, So wretched are we, so we skilfull grow In crimes, the which the heathen doe not know. We wrong God for his blessings, as if thus We then were thankfull, if injurious. Why should not mercy winne us? why should we Be worse by that, whence we should betterd be? Blessings were ne're intended for our harme, Nor should the snake have stung, when he was warme Him that had warm'd him. O how base is man! How foolish Irreligion has wanne Vpon his reason too! Doe we not say That hee's a beast, whom onely stripes can sway. O what is man then! who ne're heares his Lord, Till that the famine call him, or the sword. Who (as he meant to tyre his patient God) Yeelds not unto his favours, but his rod. And can we yet intreat him to be kind, To alter his, when wee'l not change our mind? If we are heard, we will offend agen, And all our pray'r does but intreat a Sinne. Thus pray'd the Israelites, but if th'are heard If he that made them scorn'd, will make them feard: It is in chance, no, tis as sure as fate, Having forgot their misery of late They will rebell againe: like those good hearts Who though they know the paines, the many smarts Which fruitfulnesse is fruitfull with, still give Death to themselves, to make their issue live: And if they scape this death, they try againe, And boldly venture for a second paine, As if twere pleasure, or as if they meant Rather to dye, then to be continent. Thus have we seene a barren, sandy soyle (Made onely for the husbandmans sad toyle And not his profit) when the full heav'n powres His moisture downe, easing himselfe by showres, Drown'd with the drops, to make us understand A figure of the Sea upon the Land; When once those drops are spent, when that the sky Smiles with his new restor'd serenitie, Swifter then thought, before that we can say This was the place, the water's gone away, Theres a low Ebbe, againe we see the Land Changing its moisture for its ancient sand. Yet he that knowes this their infirmity, At last will pitty it, and from on high, (When now their thoughts of war they will adjourne When there's no talke now, but of their returne) Hee'l hinder it by victory: with that (About the time that pitchy night had gat The conquest of the day of which being proud He wrapt himselfe within his thickest cloud, Thinking perhaps his conquest to be voyd, If any saw the triumphs he injoyd) Vnto our Levite he a vision sends Clad in her dearest shape, in whom he ends All thoughts of Fancy: Whom when he had seene (And quickly he had spy'd her) Fairest Queene Of heav'n, he sayes, what is there here on earth That could perswade thee to a second birth, Thus to appeare agen? needs must thou know (For ignorance belongs to us below Excluded out of heav'n) that our sad state Is for its goodnes prov'd unfortunate; That Benjamin is conqueror, and that we Could not revenge, but onely follow thee: Nor was't one losse, one petty overthrow Hath daunted us, but (as if fate would shew All her choyce malice on us) we have try'd How many wayes 'twas possible t'ave dy'd. Beleeve it, heavenly one, no cowardise (Which heretofore being base; is now tearmd wise) Lost us the day, no providence; no zeale Nor that (which can the maymes of actions heale) Councell, and grave advice was wanting to us: Only the heav'ns, which we had thought would wooe us To prosecute thy vengeance, and from whence We look'd for daies, like a good conscience Shining and cleare, with cruelty unheard Give vs an overthrow for a reward; That we can onely (such our wretched fate) Deplore the losse, which we should vindicate. Is this your Iustice heav'ns? nay I would know If it at least be wisedome, thus to show Your wrath upon you followers? if there be Such a desire in you to make us see What powre you have, wherefore d'ye not use That powre on those, who impiously abuse Vs and your selves? O there are heathen still, People that neither feare, nor know your will, If you will ruine these, or any wise But lessen, y'ave the fewer Enemies: On these be powerfull; but if you doubt Whether such nations may be singled out, That sinne hath fled the world, then here begin, For all the Heathen are in Benjamin. Are we the onely faulty? or am I Pickt out for eminent Iniquity? All lights on me, twas I that rays'd these warres, Twas I that this thicke people like to starres, Have lessend into Number; I alone Merit both peoples curses joynd in one, Benjamin does detest me, and I guesse Israels hatred is more close, not lesse. What shall I doe, what course is to be tryde When safe I cannot goe, nor safe abide? No more sayes she, nor foolishly conclude To give complaints in stead of gratitude Wee'are heard my deare, and he at whose command The earth will learne to move, the heav'n to stand Fast as the Center, who brings downe to hell, And out of deeper mercies (which to tell Would pose th? that they blesse) brings backe againe, Making the pleasure greater by the paine,) Hath crown'd our wishes; O joyfully good! Not to be had on earth, nor understood: Heav'ns high superlative, for unto me Revenge is better then Æternity. Revenge upon Gods enemies: know my deare (And know that thou must doe what thou shalt heare) It is the will of heav'n, when once the skye Is proud of the next mornings livery, All Israel should meet, where what shall fall Iust with our wishes, or exceed them all, I must not now discover, yet thus much I dare deliver (my affection's such) A truth, that is confest as soone as heard, That he who knew to plague, knowes to reward. Our Levite wakes, but stretching out an arme He feels no body, no, nor no place warme To prove she had beene there, he thinkes 'tmay be No vision, but a birth of Phantasie: An issue of a troubled braine that fram'd Formes to it selfe which Nature hath not nam'd: Have I not slaine enough he sayes, but still Is it my office and my curse to kill? Twas but a dreame injoyn'd me to be bad, A dreame, a vapour, and am I so mad For nothing to be monstrous, and commit A crime, that men shall feare to dreame of it! But can I disobey what it hath pleas'd Heav'n to command me? O how I am ceaz'd With strange extremes! nor readily can tell Whether this Revelation should dwell Clos'd in my brest; or whether I goe on As counting it a Revelation: There may be guilty silence, if we feare In the affaire of heaven to wound an eare With threatning Rhetoricke; this will not be Excus'd by a pretence of modesty: Rather twill prove the judgement of just heav'n, We shall receive the doome we should have giv'n, Now all the people know what he hath heard, Now they have all their forwardnesse declar'd In sacrifice, when Phineas appeares, One that had lived unto so many years; He knew not how to count them, and that knew The Desert wonders, and could prove them true By his owne sight, that could the more ingage Men to beleeve, not by his tongue, but age. Nay I have heard some having duely waigh'd How long in that high office he had stayd, Conceive they may affirme without a checke, Him of the order of Melchisedec; And prove (as onely judgeing what they see) Their Priesthoods, by their Priests eternity. Who having enter'd, all the people bow'd: (For 'twas not yet as perfect zeale allow'd To be irreverent to their Priest, that name Which now is prov'd a title but of shame, Then was the badge of glory) he indeares Himselfe, more by his office, then his yeares, To those, who thinke thinke these two can ne'r agree, To scorne the Priest, and serve the Deitie. Before the Altar his weake knees he bends, Which age before, but now devotion sends Vnto the ground, where with a voice so low, That he could onely heare it, who could know What it would have before it spake, he thus Whisper'd a prayer; King of Heaven, of Earth, of Seas, And of men exceeding these: Thou that when thy people ranne From the proud Ægyptian, Leadst them through a liquid path Safe, and scarce wet, when thy wrath Wonderfully made them know, Twas a Sea unto the foe. Thou that when the heat, the sand Of a barren thirsty land, Made our tongues be so confin'd To our roofes, they scarce repin'd, But in secret, so that we Onely fear'd a blasphemy. Thou then by a powerfull knocke Mad'st a Sea within a Rocke, And gav'st Israel to know For them drought should overflow: Thou art still the same, and we Stand in the same need of thee, Pardon then if we presume To an hope, and so assume Courage to us, when we joyne Our wants to that power of thine. Yes our wants, for we can find None of merit, w'ave declin'd Ev'ry good way, and have still Beene ambitious of ill, So that when we are exact, And have all our good deeds rackt To the highest rate, ther's snone Dares appeare before thy throne: Onely this desert we see, Continuance of adversity. Nay such monsters have we bin, Such proficients in each sinne, That we durst not looke on heav'n, Nor intreat to bee forgiv'n. Hadst not thou vouchsaf'd to doe What our wishes reacht not to: Hadst not thou vouchsaf'd to be Tutor to our Infancy: And bestow'd when we were mute Both our prayer and our sute. O the Courteous Respect heav'ns beares us! Scarcely had he done, Scarce finisht his impos'd devotion, When on the sudden ere you could have said The Priest had sacrificd, or he had pray'd, Through all the Campe a light was spread, to this Compar'd, the Sunn but a darke body is: And in respect of so divine a light Our day is honor'd, if he be tearmd night, Nor this alone, but that they there might see And feare their God in his full Majesty, Such voyces and such thunders fright tho Ayre, That they suppose they want another prayer To be assur'd from them; so they declar'd They were afraid to heare, that they were heard. Downe on the pavement every knee is fixt, Some groveling on their faces, when betwixt Astonishment and hope, whilst yet they doubt What all this preface meanes, and whilst the rout Fear'd judgements which they merited, they heare A voice for which they wish a larger eare, It was so sweetly mercifull: Once more Goe up (it sayes) and though that heretofore Y'ave had the worst: yet thus my sentence stands Ile now deliver them into your hands. Have you beheld how some condemn'd to dy, When they were fitted for Æternity, When life they did despise, and all below, Receiv'd a pardon, when they fear'd the blow That should unman them, have you seene them then Almost forgetting that they were but men; How to expresse their mind they want a word, Ioy having done the office of the sword, And made them speechlesse? then you may in part Conceive the wonder of their joy; which Art Confesseth it exceeds her power to show At full, which onely they that have can know. Thus brave Corvinus, then whom fame nere knew Any that to an higher vertue grew, When once it pleas'd Fortune to leave her frowne, Made an exchange of Fetters for a Crowne, Thus, not to seeke a forreigne president, Our Henry, whom the Heav'ns courteously sent To set a period to our Civill broyles, To joyne both Roses: after many foyles, Receiv'd and conquer'd, after he had seene Himselfe an Exile, who a Prince had beene, When banishment was envy'd him, when nought Would please his Enemy, unlesse he bought His death of him that harbour'd him; ev'n then, To foole the projects of the cunning'st men, This wither'd root begins afresh to spring, And from a banisht coarse revives a King. Thus (not to seeke out a stale president, Mentioning mercies after they are spent, And lost in story) Englands present Ioy (Whom Fate can onely threaten, not annoy,) How hath he try'd variety of griefe! How beene in dangers, as in Rule our Chiefe; That when there is a speech of suffering, He is no lesse our Patterne, then our King. The Seas spoke loud, yet if we rightly poyse, There was more danger, where there was lesse noyse: Yet was he freed from both, when in mans eye, Successe had seem'd to smile on Trechery. These are your wonders, Heav'n, and not so much Favours, (although the Favour too be such, That it does pose our gratitude, and so Onely proclaimes that we are made to owe Our proverty of merit) to be short, Th'are not so much your Favours, as your Sport. You in an instant rayse, whom we would sweare, Nayl'd to the Earth, him that had left to feare More then he suffer'd, that had beene so long Acquainted with ill lucke, with such a throng Of misadventures, that he does not know VVhat it is to be free from them, and so This courteous intermission he expounds Rather a Change then Cure of his neer wounds: You in an unthought Minute can depresse, VVhom we beleeve in league with Happinesse. And as upon the Stage we oft have seene, Him act a Beggar, who a King hath beene: For no default, but that the Poets art Thought at that time he best would fit that part: So in our serious Theaters, when you please Kings are as varying persons as are these, Onely in this their disadvantage lyes; That they may fall, but cannot hope to rise. They, whom the bands that make a kingdome strong; Succession to the Crowne both right and long From worthy Ancestors, obedience At home, and lastly sure intelligence Abroad hath fortifyed, those that suppos'd True joy to be wholly in them inclos'd: If you but please to frowne, in one short day (When they not thinke their Enemies on their way) Are conquer'd by them, and at last retaine This comfort onely to allay their paine That their misfortune (if the heavens decree) May be the portion of their Enemy. Why then doe trifling miseries so grate Our minds, and make us more unfortunate Then heav'n intended? if out of a summe Of mony (not so rich as troublesome By the large roome, it occupies,) some one Willing to teach us moderation, Nibble a little, how we fret! we rave! How for our treasure we distraction have! As if we did beleeve (to say no more) Heav'n had the onely powre to make us poore. Israel thought not thus, but does prepare All things that for the action needfull are: He thinkes now double diligence is due, That he may be victorious, and God true. On the Eastside of Gibeah there stood An overgrowne and unfrequented wood, The trees so thickly plac'd, that you would guesse, (Had you beheld that horrid wildernesse: How darkenesse all the Mastery had wonne,) Twas made for the discredit of the Sunne; Never did any raye pierce through those leaves, And if at any time it light receives Tis onely when the heavens doe misse their stroke, And passing wicked men, murder an Oke. So that the brightnesse that adornes the same Serves not so much to'inlighten, as inflame, Here never did the nimble Fairy tread, Nor ever any of the Wood-nymphes bred Within this grove, but it was singled out For Pluto's regiment, for that bad rout Of Hell-borne furies, there you might have seene Alecto stretch'd at her full length betweene Two fatall Yughs, where while her rest she takes, She gives an intermission to her Snakes, Who in a thousand curles there hissing lye, And she sleepes sweeter by their harmony. Here had the Canaanite in former times (Whilest that Religion did consist in crimes) Offer'd his sonnes in sacrifice, as though He meant to pay backe heav'n all he did owe Or did conceive, (that which he should despaire) To be without sinne, when without an heire. This horrid place till now had emptie stood, But now the Israelites conclude it good To plant an ambush there: for thus they plot That when the skirmish shall be growing hot, They will draw backe, to make the Benjamite Conceive that stratagem to be a flight, And leave the towne for the pursuit; when straight Vpon a signe giv'n, they that lie in waite Shall ceize upon the City, and so force Their Enemy to such a desp'rate course, That being pursu'd by those he put to flight, He shall not know, whether to flie or fight, Hearken ye silly ones that doe suppose You ought not to beare Armes against your foes: VVho having cast off ordinary sense, Affirme that they doe warre with Providence, VVho providently warre, that they distrust The powre, or care of heav'n, who will be just To their owne cause, which you will noyse to be A spice of wiser Infidelity. To these I need no other answer find: Shall we be foolish because heav'n is kind? And when your industry might doe as well, VVill ye inforce God to a Miracle? It is a truth I grant, which you pretend That God hath destin'd all things to their end, Which stands immoveable: nor is't in Fate To alter what he will præordinate: Yet never any did so farre proceed In folly, to affirme that he decreed Onely the end, that was in Gods intents, Whilest we did sleepe, to blesse us with events We dreame not of: Such fondnes cannot find Any excuse (unlesse they were design'd Inevitably to't:) for I would know (If they suppose it possible to shew Their mind in these affaires, or if they be Not hindred from an answer by Decree) Why they doe eate; and why they doe not hence Conclude rebellion against Providence; Why they doe cloath themselves; and why desire When cold oppresseth them to choose a fire; Have you forgot that for his holy ones, God can at ease produce e'ne out of stones As solid sustenance? or is it lost In your fraile memory, that when Israel crost The Desert out of Ægypt, forty yeares Nor Taylors they imploy'd, nor Shoomakers? Trust me if you your selves thinke your selves true, Your care does vilify Gods care of you; And every dish that to your board is brought Vpbraides him to his face, as if you sought To mend his purpose; and by this odd feat, You doe blaspheme as often as you eate. The Israelites are wiser farre, although They have that unknowne happinesse, to know Their victory aforehand, though they heare This truth from him, from whom they cannot feare Any deceit, (whose powerfull word alone Makes that a truth which he resolves upon,) Although they will allow his Act for chiefe, Yet they will doe their part too: to be briefe, Every soldier to himselfe sayes thus; God will bestow the victory, but by us. The night they spend in prayer, but wh? the morne Had dimm'd the pride of Cynthia's cleerest horne By higher luster, being call'd away Not by the Cocke, the Trumpetter of Day; But by an earlier trumpet, then you might By her unwilling, and yet hasting light, Discerne, and seeing, almost rightly poyse Whether were more, their number, or their noyse, And unto which more feare was to be giv'n. Who fill the Earth with Numbers, with noyse Heav'n. Benjamin takes th'alarme, and having chose One in whose faithfulnesse they might repose A wary confidence; they quit the wall And to the wider field issue out all, Lest if they stay'd within, and did oppose Rampiers and ditches onely to their foes, They might have bragg'd, (as if that they had won) Making a prison of their garrison. Now both the Hoasts themselves so neere do find, That it would aske more labour t'have declin'd The field, then to have wonne it, yet they stay Hoping that innocence is in delay, If they are slowly guilty: now speares flye Shiver'd in thousand fitters to the skye; And whether it revenge or fortune were, Every peece becomes a Murtherer. And from their bodies frees a many soule, Doing that broken, which they could not whole. Could Xerxes here have sate upon an hill, To see these warriors, he would not still Fondly lament, nor lavish out a teare Because they could not live an hundred yeare, But melt into just passion away Because they could not live out all that day. Now might you have beheld the fiery horse Proud of his owne, and of his Masters force. Robb'd of his Master, whom you now might see Running, as if twere after Liberty, Or you'd conceive, had you but seene the race That 'twas no more a battle, but a chase. No stroke falls idle, nay they are so neere; They need not strike at all: death is caus'd here By their bad neighbourhood, the whole and sound You might have seene here dead without a wound. To save the guilt and labour of the sword, Bodies to bodies their owne ends afford. Now nothing but the dust is to be seene Which like so many Emblems flyes betweene They mingled armies, which in silence sayes, They are no better then the motes they raise, Th? those poore Atomes: but they think to shrowde Their acts from sight of heav'n under that cloud, And therefore doe their utmost: yet as though Those hands were sluggish, or this fury slow, The trumpets chid them to a lustier guilt, And the loud drums proclaim'd, you have not spile Blood enough yet: O what were they that found Out first the use and malice of that sound? Which makes us kill with greedinesse, and when Tis the Corrupted Nature of most men Hardly to yeeld unto the destitute, These will not suffer us to heare their suite. This drowns the groanes: but now both armies reele, Now this gives backe some ground, now that doth feele That it is prest too hardly. Thus the seas When over it the angry winds doe please To exercise their fury, doe not know What course to take, nor whither they should flow: This wave breakes that, and then another blast Makes that the conqueror, which was conquerd last. At length the Israelites give backe indeed, And though in order, yet with such a speed, Benjamin calls it Flight, all's ours they cry, If we can runne we have the victory: With that, what ever men the towne affords, Skilfull to use their fingers or their swords, For spoyle or for pursuite, issue out thence With such a noyse, they give intelligence That they have left it emptie: O the vaine Attempts of foolish man! O deserv'd paine! Th'are made the spoile, that they intend to make, So wisely can just heav'ns their vengeance take On bad attempts, so all our heate asswage, And make our Ruine greater then our Rage. It never entred into their proud thought, They should receive the damage which they sought To give unto their brethren: who having left Their woody covert, and the friendly cleft, Which entertain'd them, by a quicke surprize, Take the unguarded towne: O who can prize Those losses to the full? or who rehearse Those misadventures in an equall verse? They spare no age, but (cruell) take away From the old men, the solitary day They could expect to live: now Infants dye, Ev'n those, who yet within their mothers lye, Finding a Night before they see the Morne, Being buri'd thus, before that they were borne, For whom their murtherers no crime could choose, But that they were, and had a life to loose, Nor does the weaker sex escape the rage Of these intruders, and as every Age, So every Person suffers, onely here May be the difference, (if that any were) Either they're killd out-right, or which is worse, They thinke their life to be the greater curse. Here mothers see their daughters whom they bred As Votaries unto their Maidenhead, Vn-virgin'd in their sight, where having lost That peerelesse jewell, which they valewd most, They doe receive to vindicate their name A death from them, from whom they had their shame. Avarice followes Lust, now they have leisure To ransacke all those Mineralls of treasure Long peace and thrift had hoarded up, at last As children when their Appetite is past Spoyle what they cannot eate, and badly kind Pamper their dogs with that they leave behind: So these, as surfeiting with such a store, (Which made them lose all teare of being poore) What is not ready spoyle, give to the fire, Whose conqu{illeg.}ring flames unto the heav'ns aspire, As boasting of their service: through the towne, Swifter then any thing that has renowne For speedinesse, they runne, one houre does spoile (Vnlucky houre) what was an Ages toyle, Now cracke the houses, now the Temples fry, Now the poore Citizens resolv'd to dye, Doubt of what death: and know not which to try, The fire, the downefalls, or the Enemy, Had this misfortune hapned in the Night (Though Nature had oppos'd) such a full light Had made a day, and so againe had wonne A Conquest of the towne, and of the Sunne. Never did Sailor with such joy behold Castor and Pollux when his ship was roll'd Vpon the angry Ocean, (whose proud waves Made the most haughty mindes freeze into slaves With a base feare,) as Israel does view Those flames, which he does feare not to be true They are so great, and yet he hopes to see These flames to light him to a victory. Now all the face of things is chang'd anew, Now those which earst seem'd vanquish'd, do pursue: The Israelites confirming by their Fight, That they could cause as well as act a Flight. Bejamin growes amaz'd, and does not know What he should doe, nor on what grounds to goe, Which probably seeme safe: if he should flye He runnes away unto the Enemy: And shall he fight: alas! but he will find It is impossible to fight behind, Where he shall be assay'ld: yet he shifts ground, And figures out his battle in a round. And since he hath no hope to scape away, Hee'l nobly sell, not give away the day. They never fought till now, all the whole day Before, was onely somewhat fiercer Play, Murder in jest, but now they are so fierce As if they would inforce their swords to pierce Beyond the body; this a while, at length Despaire does yeeld the victory to strength; And Fortune (that the world henceforth might find That they had injur'd her who call'd her blind) Crownes the best side, and providently tryes At once to prove their Conquest, and her Eyes. The Parallell is easie; was't not thus, When Heav'n was pleas'd to be as kind to us? We felt the prickles first, but then our Nose Suckt in the sweeter vertue of the Rose We had successe, as it were chose, and pickt, And, what we feard to suffer, did inflict. When Brett and Burrowes (that I speake their due) Reviv'd to France, Talbot and Montague. (O too like Montague, that lost thy breath, By the same fatall Engine of quicke death.) When the choyce valour of each rancke; and fyle Made up a double Sea within the Isle Of blood and teares, O give us thankes, kind heav'n, And adde a vertue to our Fortune giv'n. But soft, I heare the wise man say, Commend No man, nor action till you see the end. Our night is not yet past, or if it be Tis but the dawning, not the day we see, And but a misty dawning, we must know That yet we have not payd God what we owe And that would worse then any Madnesse be To have a joy ere a security, Vnder the rodd to laugh: yet we conclude Patience does please no lesse then gratitude; And he that can orecome a losse, nor be Too much cast downe for want of victory, Is in some part victorious, and can say Tis blest to be a conquerour any way. That we may all acknowledg his desert, Who nobly gain'd a conquest of the heart Of them, whose bodies he had conquer'd first, To whom he then discover'd, what he durst, And after what his Nature was, when he In the sad field had spent his Cruelty, For when they offer'd to redeeme their dead, Summes which another would have vanquished, He freely yeelds unto the sutors breath, And gives the Grave, as easily as the Death, Whilst they doe give—O how I blush to tell, A poisond knife, a poison that will dwell And eate into their fame till earth be gone, Till poyson have no more to worke upon. Teach us our right to him, but then to yon What shall we give? and yet what not leave due? Then, O kind Heav'n, for this let me be pleader, May we still sing your praise, who led our Leader, And now I hast unto my songs conclusion; Israels conquest, Benjamins confusion: Of all that valiant number which but now Made treble numbers to their valor bow: Onely sixe hundred scape away, so few, They were scarceable to commit anew The Crime for which they suffer'd; had not Night Became their Vmpire and forbad the Fight, Those few had perisht too; then at the last Let future Ages learne of Ages past How vice rewards her servants! Let them be Afraid at leastwise of the misery, Who slight the sinne: why should a beauteous face Make my soule foule? and an externall grace Bereave me of my inward? O despaire! Shall I be bad, because another's faire? Hence that poore folly, rather let us winne A conquest by the losse of Benjamin. To know that those bely'd, and stolne delights Are not of so long lasting as the Nights, In which we did injoy them, how the Day Takes both their darknesse, and our sweets away: To understand that tardy heav'n is just, That Ruine is the consequent of Lust. And now O Father, once more I repaire To thy great presence, O thou onely Faire, (Who dwelling in the light that none comes neere, Canst not be seene of us, because too cleer; To whom created beauties if compar'd, Ev'n such as have the wisest eyes ensnar'd, Are nothing but Deformity at best, Durt somewhat better colourd then the rest) Instruct my youth, O teach that I may know, What mischiefes lurke under a seemely show; What a sweet danger woman is: O thou To whom the knees that doe not love, doe bow, Whom all obey, ev'n such as have no sense, Who doe not know their owne obedience; Whom all obey, ev'n such as doe goe on In a perpetuall Rebellion, The Spirits accurst: Grant me, that chastly wise I enter into Covenant with mine eyes, Never to looke on Woman, not to see What would perswade my soule to forsake thee, To make a God of flesh: But if that I Forc'd by Temptation, or Necessity, Must see my Ruine, yet thus much, O thou Wh? my soule loves, &amp; would more, knew she how, (For his deare sake and worth, in whom was found Onely a place, no reason for a wound) If I must have the sight, yet I require I may at leastwise not have the desire, If I must see, let it be to despise So shall my heart be chast, if not mine eyes. FINIS. A Thanksgiving for a recovery from a burning Feaver. I burne againe, methinkes an holy fire Kindles my dull devotion, and farre higher Raiseth my spirit, then my hot disease Inflam'd my blood: how with a sacred ease Feele I these flames through my glad soule to rush! Like those, which made a Chappell of the bush Whence God did tutor Moses; would 'twere found That this place too were such an holy ground: Then should I boldly vent my Gratitude, And being Godly, not be counted Rude, The Night approacht, when by my paines I might Suspect it would have beene my lasting Night: I had a griefe beyond a Cowards feares, And such a griefe, it robb'd me of my teares. I was all Fire, the greedy Element Left no one part unsing'd, as if it meant To crosse the vulgar notions of our birth, And prove that man was not compos'd of Earth; That he was made of Flames, that past all doubt To dye was nothing, but to be put out. And yet the truth of this, this truth denyes, Man is not made of that by which he dyes. And had I dy'd thus, they had beene unjust Who had pronounc'd, we give dust unto dust. Ashes they well might tearme me, and so turne My Christian buriall to a Pagan urne. Without a tedious pilgrimage to Rome, (If that the torment make the Martyrdome) I might be Canoniz'd, and sooner farre Then some whose names in the gulld Calender Burne in red letters, of whom none can tell Whether they onely felt a Fire in Hell. O heat! O drought! O am I quencht as yet, Or is not this Remembrance a new fit! Yet in my fiercest fit how oft I thought (Whilst yet there was some moisture left, which fought With my hot Enemy) how durst liberall men Give us a freedome of our wills, that when Ever we list we may be good, and so Owe to our selves as well the Cure as Blow? Who gave us this strange power, can any tell, Not to be Bad, and yet not to be Well? Can we command our sinnes so easily, And faint at a poore Feaver? tell me why You will consent to dye? and wherefore still You plead not then a liberty of will? My God cry'd I, though I must needs confesse Vnto my shame, that all my paines are lesse Then my demerits, yet I grant us free That they exceed all possibility Of mine owne cure, and yet I sooner can (Spite of disease) turne my Physitian Then my Redeemer, thou alone canst doe A powerfull cure on soule and body too. With that I felt recovery: my flame Was kindly lessen'd to a lower name, To moderate heat: Sleepe did my senses charme, And I that burnt before, was now but warme, Health and Devotion ceize on me, my fire Had left my bones to live in my Desire, And I was sicke of thankfulnesse: then now Teach me O Lord not why to praise, but how: Bow my stiffe knees, that they may beg a pow'r, Of full thanksgiving to my Saviour. Some praise for lesse: I've read of Jonah's arke (Which was of furer cariage then his Barke) Th'inhabitable Fish, and yet we see That he gives thankes for his Delivery From his Preserver, and shall retchlesse I Deliver'd from a neerer death, now dye In the Remembrance? first, O Lord returne My tutor-torment, let me againe burne. And now great God, I doe intreat, and change My praise into a pray'r, (for tis not strange That benefits should make a suppliant, Since courtesies cause pray'r as well as want) Twas thy great mercy made my body whole, O let me find that mercy to my soule, Then shall I boldly hasten to the grave, And wanting Life, not want what I would have. Upon our vaine flattery of ourselves that the succeeding times will be better then the former. How we dally out our dayes! How we seeke a thousand wayes To find Death the which if none We sought out, would shew us one. Why then doe we injure Fate, When we will impute the date And expiring of our time, To be hers, which is our Crime? Wish we not our End? and worse, Mak't a Pray'r which is a Curse? Does there not in each breast lye Both our soule and Enemy? Never was there Morning yet (Sweet as is the Violet) Which mans folly did not soone Wish to be expir'd in Noone; As though such an hast did tend To our blisse, and not our End; Nay the yong ones in the nest Sucke this folly from the breast, And no stamm'ring ape but can Spoyle a prayer to be a Man. But suppose that he is heard, By the sprouting of his beard, And he hath what he doth seek The soft cloathing of the Checke: Would he yet stay here? or be Fixt in this Maturity? Sooner shall the wandring starre Learne what rest and quiet are: Sooner shall the slippery Rill Leave his motion and stand still. Be it joy, or be it Sorrow, We referre all to the Morrow, That we thinke will ease our paine, That we doe suppose againe Will increase our Ioy, and so Events, the which we cannot know We magnifie, and are (in summe) Enamor'd of the time to come. Well, the next day comes, and then, Another next, and so to ten, To twenty we arrive, and find No more before us then behind Of solid joy, and yet hast on To our Consummation: Till the baldnesse of the crowne, Till that all the face doe frowne, Till the Forehead often have The remembrance of a Grave; Till the eyes looke in, to find If that they can see the mind. Till the sharpnesse of the Nose, Till that we have liv'd, to pose Sharper eyes, who cannot know Whether we are men or noe: Till the tallow of the Cheeke, Till we know not what we seeke; And at last of life bereav'd, Dye unhappy, and deceiv'd. FINIS. AN ELEGY VPON the untimely, yet Heroicall death of Gustavus Adophus the Victorious King of Sweden, &amp;c. Are all our hopes but this? did we expect that thou our falling Fortunes shoulst erect, And must thou fall thy selfe? a little dust Remaine of him, who, we did surely trust, Should into dust have brought Romes prouder walls, And hastned the great whores just Funeralls? Is this the noble Conquerour? this he, Who was the Favourite of victory? Who, whatsoever he attempted, wrought, Event still gladly lackying his wise thought, Who wrought no other thing, then what he should, His power being still confin'd to what was good: How could he choose then but be happyest, Who had his will, who will'd that which was best? Alas how pale he lookes! sure tis not He, This is the count'nance of the Enemy, When Sweden prest him, thus did Tilly looke, When in the field of Leipsich, that sad booke, He read his following miseries, which did reach, As farre as Elve is distant from the Leach; Where he receiv'd his Death at his proud knee, Because before he would not bow to thee, This was Bavaria's colour when he saw His Arts could not diswade, nor forces draw Thee from thy high designes, this was his hew, When after all his projects, he not drew A sword in his defence, and threw away His lands without the hazard of a day, As if hee'd see, how nobly thou wouldst use them, Or he had had his countryes, but to lose them. Or thus look'd Fridland, when he saw the field Strew'd with his slaughter'd souldiers who doe yeeld Riches to those grounds, wh?ce they took the spoile; And their dead bodies doe manure the soile, Which, living, they had wasted, in that howre, When Sweden foyld the Emperours Emperour. If these looke pale 'tis fit, a pretty art, That their owne cheekes, should represent the heart Of their dead forces, should want blood as well, And by their Faces, shew us how They fell. Let's looke againe: Alas! tis He, tis He, This was Gustavus, was? ô misery, Was it, and ist not? ô that face! those eyes! Where Spaine and Austria read their destinies Are they the dainties for the worme? that hand, Lift up to Prayer alway, or Command Must that lye still for Ever? must it bee, So still, as it would make the Enemy? Was it for this thou leftst thy native soile, Thy Queene, thine Heire, was it for this? to toile For others benefit, and after, have For all thy travells but a German grave? Could not thy Sweden bury thee? nor give Rest to thy bones, which whilst that thou didst live Bestow'd a Crowne upon thy head? was't more To give a Graye, then a whole Realme before? Yet this is thy reward, that thou doest lye, In the, by thee twice reskew'd Saxony: Yet what reward is this for thee? they have From thee their Right, fr? them thou but thy Grave. Farre be all blessing from that man, who first Found out that Fatall instrument, who durst Thunder on Earth, and teach mankind a way How they might send mankind unto their clay, Not knowing who 'twas sent them, by whose skill The Coward is instructed how to kill, And the brave man must at a distance dye By him, whom neerer, his owne livelyer eye Would look to Death: how could he have the braine, To teach the world by what a world is slaine, Or since he knew the mischiefe of his Art, If he could have the Braine, yet how the Heart? Is this the Cloysterd study? cannot they Deny the world; unlesse the world they slay? Is this (I'de know) their owne selfes to deny, To cause, besides themselves all else should dye? Are they coop'd up for this? but I admire In vaine, how from the Devill, and the Frier Commeth ought, that is not, Hellish, how those two Should thinke, what 'twas not a lowd crime to doe? Wert not for them 'twould be no wondred thing To see at once one Aged, and a King, Since we doe learne in Sage experience Schoole Crownes would be sacred wert not for the Cowle. Nor are we longer ign'rant now, who gave Birth to our sorrow, to our joy a grave, What ever mist to blind our eyes they spread, The Hand we doe not know, we doe the Head, Which that we may curse home, to pay his due, Let us their triumph and our losse review. Many have beene victorious, ev'ry Age Hath once produc'd some Worthies on the Stage, Sacred to glory: Rome doth Cæsar praise, Carthage her Hannibal to Heav'n doth raise Thy Bruce ô Scotland is farre fam'd by thee, Their Henry, France doth boast, our Edward we, All these were Conqu'rours, but upon what right May we inquire, did some of them first fight? Some were but Royall robbers, and the best Made man so cheape for their owne Interest, Revenge, or Profit drove them unto Fame, And thus they injur'd, whilst they gain'd their name: Whilst all Thy power is spent in doing good, And thou gain'st nothing but the losse of blood, Whilst all thy power is spent the wrong'd to right, And thus thy acts are Iudgement, and not Fight, Thus whilst their actions in this currant ran To make th'Oppressour greater the Man, Had there beene none opprest, thou hadst lien still That thou might Save thou wert inforc't to Kill: Whilst all thy power is spent in Gods owne Cause, To plant, or to establish his pure Lawes To make Professours fearelesse, that it might No longer be a crime to be i'th' Right, Nor a sufficient cause to make one Dye That he would seeke a true Æternity. These are thy Acts—to make the Enemy yeeld, By force to make him quit the blood-died field; To take in townes with as much ease, as though Their walls were like to those of Jericho, Would fall to give thee entrance; to or'e come Whole countryes with more speedinesse then some Could view them, all these are thy acts tis knowne, But these, with others, thine; those, thine alone. I challenge thee proud Greece and prouder Rome, From their first birth unto their latest tombe, Peruse your Heroes, read their actions or'e Make what was somewhat, by your Fabling, more, Add lye and all to boot, then if you dare Bring them: if with Gustavus you compare, They shall as much that competition shunne, As a weake Taper yeelds to the bright Sunne, Which of them ever fought for others gaines, That theirs might be the Profit his the Paines? I could be infinite thee to commend, But thou thy selfe doest not despise an end I therefore hasten: having done thus much Thou now wouldst see whether another such Would after thy departure rise, or why May I not say, that thou wouldst therefore dye That man should grudge no longer at his Death Nor strive to keep whe heav'n would take his breath? Must we all Dye? proud death then doe thy worst, What ere thou canst, Sweden hath sufferd first And he being dead who now would live? mine eies Begin to flow a fresh; new fountaines rise, Which threaten inundations, but I stay, When I consider, thou hast found one way, Not to doe all for others: Princely shade! This is thy Art of warre at length t'invade Heav'n for Thy selfe, there all the gaines are Thine, Thou wert not Kill'd for the Prince Palatine: When I thinke this then doe I spare mine eye: For others thou dost Fight, for thy selfe Dye. [The Epitaph] In English thus Me Sweden bred, there I receiv'd my breath, Leipsich twice gave me honour, once my Death, I free'd th'opprest, brought down th'oppressors pride, Won crowns, that other men might weare th? dy'ed. A bullet, out of what piece none can tell, Brought me that dismall message, thus I fell, Death at adventure my last blood hath spill'd, No man must boast that he hath Sweden kill'd. Reader shed one teare for my death, but one, Whose life took order, that thou shouldst shed none. FINIS.</field>
