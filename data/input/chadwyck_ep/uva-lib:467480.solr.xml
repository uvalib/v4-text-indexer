TITUS, CAIUS PLACIDUS Placidus, though not expressly mentioned as one of the Roman generals engaged, had a command previously in Syria., TIBERIUS ALEXANDER, TERENTIUS RUFUS, DIAGORAS, &amp;c. TITUS. Advance the eagles, Caius Placidus, Even to the walls of this rebellious city! What! shall our bird of conquest, that hath flown Over the world, and built her nest of glory Even in the palace tops of proudest kings, What! shall she check and pause here in her circle, Her centre of dominion? By the gods, It is a treason to all-conquering Rome, That thus our baffled legions stand at bay Before this hemm'd and famishing Jerusalem. PLACIDUS. Son of Vespasian! I have been a soldier, Till the helm hath worn mine aged temples bare. Battles have been familiar to mine eyes As is the sunlight, and the angry Mars Wears not a terror to appal the souls Of constant men, but I have fronted it. I have seen the painted Briton sweep to battle On his scythed car, and, when he fell, he fell As one that honour'd death by nobly dying. And I have been where flying Parthians shower'd Their arrows, making the pursuer check His fierce steed with the sudden grasp of death. But war like this, so frantic and so desperate, Man ne'er beheld. Our swords are blunt with slaying, And yet, as though the earth cast up again Souls discontented with a single death, They grow beneath the slaughter. Neither battle, Nor famine, nor the withering pestilence, Subdues these prodigals of blood: by day They cast their lives upon our swords; by night They turn their civil weapons on themselves, Even till insatiate War shrinks to behold The hideous consummation. TITUS. It must be— And yet it moves me, Romans! it confounds The counsels of my firm philosophy, That Ruin's merciless ploughshare must pass o'er, And barren salt be sown on yon proud city. As on our olive-crowned hill we stand, Where Kedron at our feet its scanty waters Distils from stone to stone with gentle motion, As through a valley sacred to sweet peace, How boldly doth it front us! how majestically! Like a luxurious vineyard, the hill side Is hung with marble fabrics, line o'er line, Terrace o'er terrace, nearer still, and nearer To the blue heavens. Here bright and sumptuous palaces, With cool and verdant gardens interspers'd; Here towers of war that frown in massy strength. While over all hangs the rich purple eve, As conscious of its being her last farewell Of light and glory to that fated city. And, as our clouds of battle dust and smoke Are melted into air, behold the Temple, In undisturbed and lone serenity Finding itself a solemn sanctuary In the profound of heaven! It stands before us A mount of snow fretted with golden pinnacles ???? ?? ??? ???????????????? ??????, ???????? ?????? ???? ?????? ?????? ???????????, ??? ??? ???? ?? ????????? ?????????? ??. (Joseph. lib. v. c. 5.) See the whole description.! The very sun, as though he worshipp'd there, Lingers upon the gilded cedar roofs; And down the long and branching porticoes, On every flowery-sculptured capital, Glitters the homage of his parting beams. By Hercules! the sight might almost win The offended majesty of Rome to mercy. TIBERIUS ALEXANDERTiberius Alexander had been governor of Judea about twenty years before (from A.C. 46 to 48): he was an apostate Egyptian Jew, the son of Alexander, the Alabarch of Alexandria, and nephew of the celebrated Philo. The only act recorded of his short government was the crucifixion of James and Simon, two sons of Judas the Galilean, who had attempted to disseminate the dangerous doctrines of their father. (Hist. of Jews, ii. 202.) Wond'rous indeed it is, great Son of Cæsar, But it shall be more wond'rous, when the triumph Of Titus marches through those brazen gates, Which seem as though they would invite the world To worship in the precincts of her Temple, As he in laurell'd pomp is borne along To that new palace of his pride. TITUS. Tiberius! It cannot be— TIBERIUS. What cannot be, which Rome Commands, and Titus, the great heir of Rome? TITUS. I tell thee, Alexander, it must fall! Yon lofty city, and yon gorgeous Temple, Are consecrate to Ruin. Earth is weary Of the wild factions of this jealous people, And they must feel our wrath, the wrath of Rome, Even so that the rapt stranger shall admire Where that proud city stood, which was Jerusalem. DIAGORAS. Thy brethren of the porch, imperial Titus, Of late esteem'd thee at the height of those Who with consummate wisdom have tamed down The fierce and turbulent passions which distract The vulgar soul Reginald Heber's “Stoic tyrant's philosophic pride” will occur to the memory at least of academic readers.; they deem'd that, like Olympus, Thou, on thy cold and lofty eminence, Severely didst maintain thy sacred quiet Above the clouds and tumult of low earth. But now we see thee stooping to the thraldom Of every fierce affection, now entranced In deepest admiration, and anon Wrath hath the absolute empire o'er thy soul. Methinks we must unschool our royal pupil, And cast him back to the common herd of men. TITUS. 'Tis true, Diagoras; yet wherefore ask not, For vainly have I question'd mine own reason: But thus it is—I know not whence or how, There is a stern command upon my soul. I feel the inexorable fate within That tells me, carnage is a duty here, And that the appointed desolation chides The tardy vengeance of our war. Diagoras, If that I err, impeach my tenets. Destiny Is over all, and hard Necessity Holds o'er the shifting course of human things Her paramount dominion. Like a flood The irresistible stream of fate flows on, And urges in its vast and sweeping motion Kings, Consuls, Cæsars, with their mightiest armies, Each to his fix'd, inevitable end. Yea, even eternal Rome, and Father Jove, Sternly submissive, sail that onward tide The following sentence of Seneca may show that the Stoic Predestination is not too strongly expressed. “Eadem necessitate et Deos alligat. Irrevocabilis humana pariter et divina cursus alligat. Ille ipse omnium conditor ac rector scripsit quidem fata sed sequitur. Semper paret, semel jussit.” (Seneca de Providentiâ, c. 5.). And now am I upon its rushing bosom, I feel its silent billows swell beneath me, Bearing me and the conquering arms of Rome 'Gainst yon devoted city. On they pass, And ages yet to come shall pause and wonder At the utter wreck, which they shall leave behind them. But, Placidus, I read thy look severe. This is no time nor place for school debates On the high points of wisdom. Let this night Our wide encircling walls complete their circuit The days shall come upon thee when thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side. Luke, xix. 43. For the remarkable and perfect completion of this prophecy, see the description of the wall built by Titus. (Josephus, lib. v. c. 12.); And still the approaching trenches closer mine Their secret way; the engines and the towers Stand each at their appointed post—Terentius, That charge be thine. TERENTIUS“Terentius Rufus, or Ternus Rufus (as his name appears in the Rabbinical traditions, ever coupled with the most rancorous expressions of hatred, and confounded with the no less obnoxious T. Annius Rufus, the governor of Judea in the time of Hadrian) executed the work of desolation, of which he was left in charge, with unrelenting severity.”—Hist. of Jews, Vol. iii. 68. This work was the total demolition of the city after its capture. Compare, on the curious coincidence of a general named T. Annius Rufus being employed on the same work of destruction by Hadrian. —Hist. of Jews, iii. p. 119. There spoke again the Roman. Faith! like old Mummius, I should give to the flame Whate'er opposed the sovereign sway of Cæsar, If it were wrought of massy molten gold: And though I wear a beard, I boast not much Of my philosophy. But this I know, That to oppose the omnipotent arms of Rome Is to pluck down and tempt a final doom. The Fountain of Siloe The fountain of Siloe was just without the walls. The upper city, occupied by Simon, (Joseph, v. 6,) ended nearly on a line with the fountain. Though, indeed, Simon commanded parts also of the lower city. —Joseph. v. 1. Siloe's brook, that flowed Close by the oracles of God. Milton.—Night. JAVAN. Sweet fountain, once again I visit thee! And thou art flowing on, and freshening still The green moss, and the flowers that bend to thee, Modestly with a soft unboastful murmur Rejoicing at the blessings that thou bearest. Pure, stainless, thou art flowing on; the stars Make thee their mirror, and the moonlight beams Course one another o'er thy silver bosom: And yet thy flowing is through fields of blood, And armed men their hot and weary brows Slake with thy limpid and perennial coolness. Even with such rare and singular purity Mov'st thou, oh Miriam, in yon cruel city. Men's eyes, o'erwearied with the sights of war, With tumult and with grief, repose on thee As on a refuge and a sweet refreshment. Thou canst o'erawe, thou in thy gentleness, A trembling, pale and melancholy maid, The brutal violence of ungodly men. Thou glidest on amid the dark pollution In modesty unstain'd, and heavenly influences, More lovely than the light of star or moon, As though delighted with their own reflection From spirit so pure, dwell evermore upon thee. Oh! how dost thou, beloved proselyte To the high creed of Him who died for men, Oh! how dost thou commend the truths I teach thee, By the strong faith and soft humility Wherewith thy soul embraces them! Thou prayest, And I, who pray with thee, feel my words wing'd, And holier fervor gushing from my heart, While Heaven seems smiling kind acceptance down On the associate of so pure a worshipper. But ah! why com'st thou not? these two long nights I've watch'd for thee in vain, and have not felt The music of thy footsteps on my spirit— VOICE AT A DISTANCE. Javan! JAVAN. It is her voice! the air is fond of it, And enviously delays its tender sounds From the ear that thirsteth for them—Miriam! JAVAN, MIRIAM. JAVAN. Nay, stand thus in thy timid breathlessness, That I may gaze on thee, and thou not chide me Because I gaze too fondly. MIRIAM. Hast thou brought me Thy wonted offerings? JAVAN. Dearest, they are here: The bursting fig, the cool and ripe pomegranate, The skin all rosy with the emprisoned wine; All I can bear thee, more than thou canst bear Home to the city. MIRIAM. Bless thee!—Oh my father! How will thy famish'd and thy toil-bow'd frame Resume its native majesty! thy words, When this bright draught hath slak'd thy parched lips, Flow with their wonted freedom and command. JAVAN. Thy father! still no thought but of thy father! Nay, Miriam! but thou must hear me now, Now ere we part—if we must part again, If my sad spirit must be rent from thine. Even now our city trembles on the verge Of utter ruin. Yet a night or two, And the fierce stranger in our burning streets Stands conqueror: and how the Roman conquers Let Gamala, let fallen Jotapata Gamala and Jotapata, towns before taken by the Romans. In the earlier editions it stood, Gischala. The conduct of the conqueror to Gischala, which surrendered, was marked with far greater lenity than to Jotapata and Gamala, which were given up to general massacre. —Compare Joseph. B. J., iii. 7. and iv. 1. —Hist. of Jews, ii. 305, 308, and 333. Tell, if one living man, one innocent child, Yet wander o'er their cold and scatter'd ashes. They slew them, Miriam, the old grey man, Whose blood scarce tinged their swords—(nay, turn not from me, The tears thou sheddest feel as though I wrung them From mine own heart, my life-blood's dearest drops)— They slew them, Miriam, at the mother's breast, The smiling infants;—and the tender maid, The soft, the loving, and the chaste, like thee, They slew her not till— MIRIAM. Javan, 'tis unkind! I have enough at home of thoughts like these, Thoughts horrible, that freeze the blood, and make A heavier burthen of this weary life. I hoped with thee t' have pass'd a tranquil hour, A brief, a hurried, yet still tranquil hour! —But thou art like them all! the miserable Have only Heaven, where they can rest in peace, Without being mock'd and taunted with their misery. JAVAN. Thou know'st it is a lover's wayward joy To be reproach'd by her he loves, or thus Thou would'st not speak. But 'twas not to provoke That sweet reproof, which sounds so like to tenderness; I would alarm thee, shock thee, but to save. That old and secret stair, down which thou stealest At midnight through tall grass and olive trunks, Which cumber, yet conceal thy difficult path, It cannot long remain secure and open; Nearer and closer the stern Roman winds His trenches; and on every side but this Soars his emprisoning wall. Yet, yet 'tis time, And I must bear thee with me, where are met, In Pella, the neglected church of Christ. MIRIAM. With thee! to fly with thee! thou mak'st me fear Lest all this while I have deceived my soul, Excusing to myself our stolen meetings By the fond thought, that for my father's life I labour'd, bearing sustenance from thee, Which he hath deem'd heaven-sent. JAVAN. Oh! farewell then The faithless dream, the sweet yet faithless dream, That Miriam loves me! MIRIAM. Love thee! I am here, Here at dead midnight by the fountain's side, Trusting thee, Javan, with a faith as fearless As that with which the instinctive infant turns To its mother's bosom—Love thee! when the sounds Of massacre are round me, when the shouts Of frantic men in battle rack the soul With their importunate and jarring din, Javan, I think on thee, and am at peace. Our famish'd maidens gaze on me, and see That I am famish'd like themselves, as pale, With lips as parch'd and eyes as wild, yet I Sit patient with an enviable smile On my wan cheeks, for then my spirit feasts Contented on its pleasing thoughts of thee. My very prayers are full of thee, I look To heaven and bless thee; for from thee I learnt The way by which we reach the eternal mansions. But thou, injurious Javan! coldly doubtest! And—Oh! but I have said too much! Oh! scorn not The immodest maid, whom thou hast vex'd to utter What yet she scarce dared whisper to herself. JAVAN. Will it then cease? will it not always sound Sweet, musical as thus? and wilt thou leave me? MIRIAM. My father! JAVAN. Miriam! is not thy father (Oh, that such flowers should bloom on such a stock!) The curse of Israel? even his common name Simon the Assassin!—of the bloody men That hold their iron sway within yon city, The bloodiest? MIRIAM. Oh cease! I pray thee, cease! Javan! I know that all men hate my father; Javan! I fear that all should hate my father; And therefore, Javan, must his daughter's love, Her dutiful, her deep, her fervent love, Make up to his forlorn and desolate heart The forfeited affections of his kind. Is't not so written in our Law? and He We worship came not to destroy the Law. Then let men rain their curses, let the storm Of human hate beat on his rugged trunk, I will cling to him, starve, die, bear the scoffs Of men upon my scatter'd bones with him. JAVAN. Oh, Miriam! what a fatal art hast thou Of winding thought, word, act, to thy sole purpose; The enamouring one even now too much enamour'd! I must admire thee more for so denying, Than I had dared if thou hadst fondly granted. Thou dost devote thyself to utterest peril, And me to deepest anguish; yet even now Thou art lovelier to me in thy cold severity, Flying me, leaving me without a joy, Without a hope on earth, without thyself; Thou art lovelier now than if thy yielding soul Had smiled on me a passionate consent. Go! for I see thy parting homeward look, Go in thy beauty! like a setting star, The last in all the thick and moonless heavens, O'er the lone traveller in the trackless desert. Go! if this dark and miserable earth Do jealously refuse us place for meeting, There is a heaven for those who trust in Christ. Farewell!— And thou return'st!— MIRIAM. I had forgot— The fruit, the wine—Oh! when I part from thee How can I think of aught but thy last words? JAVAN. Bless thee! but we may meet again even here! Thou look'st consent, I see it through thy tears. Yet once again that cold sad word, Farewell! The House of Simon. MIRIAM. Oh God! thou surely dost approve mine act, For thou didst bid thy soft and silver moon To light me back upon my intricate way. Even o'er each shadowy thing at which I trembled She pour'd a sober beauty, and my terror Was mingled with a sense of calm delight. How changed that way! when yet a laughing child, It was my sport to thread that broken stair That from our house leads down into the vale, By which, in ancient days, the maidens stole To bathe in the cool fountain's secret waters. In each wild olive trunk, and twisted root Of sycamore, with ivy overgrown, I have nestled, and the flowers would seem to welcome me. I loved it with a child's capricious love, Because none knew it but myself. Its loneliness I loved, for still my sole companions there, The doves, sate murmuring in the noonday sun. Ah! now there broods no bird of peace and love! Even as I pass'd, a sullen vulture rose, And heavily it flapped its huge wings o'er me, As though o'ergorged with blood of Israel. MIRIAM, SALONE Perhaps I ought to state, in justice to myself, that this Poem was published before the Pirate of Sir W. Scott, whose beautiful Minna and Brenda I might be suspected of having attempted to imitate in the contrast of these Jewish sisters.. MIRIAM. Sister, not yet at rest? SALONE. At rest! at rest! The wretched and the desperate, let them court The dull, the dreamless, the unconscious sleep, To lap them in its stagnant lethargy. But oh! the bright, the rapturous disturbances That break my haunted slumbers! Fast they come, They crowd around my couch, and all my chamber Is radiant with them. There I lie and bask In their glad promise, till the oppressed spirit Can bear no more, and I come forth to breathe The cool free air. MIRIAM. Dear sister, in our state, So dark, so hopeless, dreaming still of glory The reader of Josephus will scarcely think these visions of glory beyond the legitimate bounds of poetic embellishment. False prophets are said by the historian to have been paid by the leaders of the insurrection to keep up the courage of the populace. —Joseph. B. J., vi, 5. 2.! SALONE. Low-minded Miriam! I tell thee, oft I have told thee, nightly do the visitations Break on my gifted sight, more golden bright Than the rich morn on Carmel. Of their shape, Sister, I know not; this I only know, That they pour o'er me like the restless waters Of some pure cataract in the noontide sun. There is a mingling of all glorious forms, Of Angels riding upon cloudy thrones, And our proud city marching all abroad Like a crown'd conqueror o'er the trampled Gentiles. MIRIAM. Alas! when God afflicts us in his wrath, 'Tis sin to mock with wild untimely gladness His stern inflictions! Else, beloved Salone, My soul would envy thee thy mad forgetfulness, And dote on the distraction of thy dreams, Till it imbibed the infection of their joy. SALONE. What mean'st thou? MIRIAM. Ah! thou know'st too well, Salone, How with an audible and imperious voice The Lord is speaking in the streets of Judah, “Down to the dust, proud daughters of Jerusalem! “The crownings of your head be bitter ashes, “Your festal garments changed to mourning sackcloth, “Your bridal songs fail into burial wailings.” SALONE. Our bridal songs It must be recollected, that the unmarried state was looked on with peculiar horror by the Jewish maidens. By marriage there was a hope of becoming the mother of the Messiah.! Away! I know them now, They were the rich and bursting cadences That thrall'd mine ears. I tell thee, doubting woman! My spirit drank the sounds of all the city. And there were shriekings for the dead, and sobs Of dying men, and the quick peevish moan Of the half famished: there were trumpet sounds Of arming to the battle, and the shouts Of onset, and the fall of flaming houses Crashing around. But in the house of Simon, The silver lute spake to the dulcimer; The tabret and the harp held sweet discourse; And all along our roofs, and all about The silence of our chambers, flow'd the sweetness. Even yet I hear them—Hark! yet, yet they sound. MIRIAM. Alas! we listen to our own fond hopes, Even till they seem no more our fancy's children. We put them on a prophet's robes, endow them With prophets' voices, and then Heaven speaks in them, And that which we would have be, surely shall be. SALONE. What, mock'st thou still? still enviously doubtest The mark'd and favour'd of the Everlasting? MIRIAM. Oh gracious Lord! thou know'st she hath not eaten For two long days, and now her troubled brain Is full of strangeness. SALONE. Ha! still unbelieving! Then, then 'tis true, what I have doubted long. False traitress to our city, to the race, The chosen race of Abraham! loose apostate From Israel's faith! Believer in the Crucified! I know thee, I abjure thee. Thou'rt no child Of Simon's house, no sister of Salone: I blot thee from my heart, I wipe away All memory of our youthful pleasant hours, Our blended sports and tasks, and joys and sorrows; Yea, I'll proclaim thee. MIRIAM. Sister! dearest sister! Thou seest that I cannot speak for tears. SALONE. Away! thou wilt not speak, thou dar'st not—Hark! My father's armed footstep! at whose tread Sion rejoices, and the pavement stones Of Salem shout with proud and boastful echoes; The Gentiles' scourge, the Christians'—tremble, false one! MIRIAM, SALONE, SIMON. SALONE. Father! MIRIAM. Dear father! SIMON. Daughters, I have been With Eleazar, and with John of Galilee, The son of Sadoc. We have search'd the city, If any rebel to our ordinance Do traitorously withhold his private hoard Of stolen provision from the public store. SALONE. And found ye any guilty of a fraud So base on Judah's warriors? SIMON. Yes, my children! There sate a woman in a lowly house, And she had moulded meal into a cake; And she sate weeping even in wild delight Over her sleeping infants, at the thought Of how their eyes would glisten to behold The unaccustom'd food. She had not tasted Herself the strange repast: but she had raised The covering under which the children lay Crouching and clinging fondly to each other, As though the warmth that breath'd from out their bodies Had some refreshment for their wither'd lips. We bared our swords to slay: but subtle John Snatch'd the food from her, trod it on the ground, And mock'd her. MIRIAM. But thou didst not smite her, father? SIMON. No! we were wiser than to bless with death A wretch like her. But I must seek within, If he, that oft at dead of midnight placeth The wine and fruit within our chosen house, Hath minister'd this night to Israel's chief. MIRIAM, SALONE. SALONE. Oh, Miriam! I dare not tell him now! For even as those two infants lay together, Nestling their sleeping faces on each other; Even so have we two lain, and I have felt Thy breath upon my face, and every motion Of thy soft bosom answering to mine own. SIMON, SALONE, MIRIAM. SIMON. Come, daughters, I have wash'd my bloody hands, And said my prayers, and we will eat—And thee First will I bless, thou secret messenger, That mine ambrosial banquet doth prepare With gracious stealth: where'er thou art, if yet Thy unseen presence lingers in our air, Or walks our earth in beauty, hear me bless thee. MIRIAM (apart). He blesseth me! me, though he means it not! I thought t' have heard his stern heart-withering curse, And God hath changed it to a gentle blessing. SIMON. Why stands my loving Miriam aloof? Will she not join to thank the God of Israel, Who thus with signal mercy seals her father His chosen captain. MIRIAM (apart). Yet must I endure— For if he knew it came from Christian hands, While the ripe fruit was bursting at his lips, While the cool wine-cup slak'd his burning throat, He'd dash it to the earth, and trample on it; And then he'd perish, perish in his sins— Father, I come—but I have vow'd to sing A hymn this night,—I'll follow thee anon. SIMON. Come then, Salone; while we feast, I'll tell thee More deeds of justice which mine arm hath wrought Against the foes of Salem, and the renegades That have revolted from the arms of Israel: And thou shalt wave thy raven locks with pride To hear the stern-told glories of thy father. MIRIAM (alone). Oh Thou! thou who canst melt the heart of stone, And make the desert of the cruel breast A paradise of soft and gentle thoughts! Ah! will it ever be, that thou wilt visit The darkness of my father's soul? Thou knowest In what strong bondage Zeal and ancient Faith, Passion and stubborn Custom, and fierce Pride, Hold th' heart of man. Thou knowest, Merciful! That knowest all things, and dost ever turn Thine eye of pity on our guilty nature. For thou wert born of woman! thou didst come, Oh Holiest! to this world of sin and gloom, Not in thy dread omnipotent array; And not by thunders strew'd Was thy tempestuous road; Nor indignation burnt before thee on thy way. But thee, a soft and naked child, Thy mother undefiled, In the rude manger laid to rest From off her virgin breast. The heavens were not commanded to prepare A gorgeous canopy of golden air; Nor stoop'd their lamps th' enthroned fires on high: A single silent star Came wandering from afar, Gliding uncheck'd and calm along the liquid sky; The Eastern Sages leading on As at a kingly throne, To lay their gold and odours sweet Before thy infant feet. The Earth and Ocean were not hush'd to hear Bright harmony from every starry sphere; Nor at thy presence brake the voice of song From all the cherub choirs, And seraphs' burning lyres, Pour'd thro' the host of heaven the charmed clouds along. One angel troop the strain began, Of all the race of man By simple shepherds heard alone, That soft Hosanna's tone. And when thou didst depart, no car of flame To bear thee hence in lambent radiance came; Nor visible Angels mourn'd with drooping plumes: Nor didst thou mount on high From fatal Calvary With all thine own redeem'd outbursting from their tombs. For thou didst bear away from earth But one of human birth, The dying felon by thy side, to be In Paradise with thee. Nor o'er thy cross the clouds of vengeance brake; A little while the conscious earth did shake At that foul deed by her fierce children done; A few dim hours of day The world in darkness lay; Then bask'd in bright repose beneath the cloudless sun: While thou didst sleep beneath the tomb, Consenting to thy doom; Ere yet the white-robed Angel shone Upon the sealed stone. And when thou didst arise, thou didst not stand With Devastation in thy red right hand, Plaguing the guilty city's murtherous crew; But thou didst haste to meet Thy mother's coming feet, And bear the words of peace unto the faithful few. Then calmly, slowly did'st thou rise Into thy native skies, Thy human form dissolved on high In its own radiancy. The House of Simon—Break of Day. SIMON. The air is still and cool. It comes not yet: I thought that I had felt it in my sleep Weighing upon my choked and labouring breast, That did rejoice beneath the stern oppression; I thought I saw its lurid gloom o'erspreading The starless waning night. But yet it comes not, The broad and sultry thundercloud, wherein The God of Israel evermore pavilions The chariot of his vengeance. I look out, And still, as I have seen, morn after morn, The hills of Judah flash upon my sight The accursed radiance of the Gentile arms. But oh! ye sky-descending ministers, That on invisible and soundless wing Stoop to your earthly purposes, as swift As rushing fire, and terrible as the wind That sweeps the tentless desert—ye that move Shrouded in secrecy as in a robe, With gloom of deepest midnight the vaunt-courier Of your dread presence! will ye not reveal?— Will ye not one compassionate glimpse vouchsafe, By what dark instruments 'tis now your charge To save the Holy City?—Lord of Israel! Thee too I ask, with bold yet holy awe, Which now of thy obsequious elements Choosest thou for thy champion and thy combatant? For well they know, the wide and deluging Waters, The ravenous Fire, and the plague-breathing Air, Yea, and the yawning and wide-chasmed Earth, They know thy bidding, by fix'd habit bound To the usage of obedience. Or the rather, Look we in weary yet undaunted hope For Him that is to come, the Mighty Arm, The Wearer of the purple robe of vengeance, The Crowned with dominion? Let him haste; The wine-press waits the trampling of his wrath, And Judah yearns t' unfurl the Lion banner Before the terrible radiance of his coming. SIMON, JOHN, ELEAZAR, THE HIGH-PRIEST, AMARIAH, &amp;c., &amp;c. JOHN. How, Simon! have we broken on thy privacy! Thou wert discoursing with the spirits of air. Now, Eleazar, were not holy Simon The just, the merciful, the righteous Simon, A vessel meet for the prophetic trance? Methinks 'tis on him now! SIMON. Ha! John of Galilee, Still in the taunting vein? Reserv'st thou not The bitter overflowings of thy lips For yon fierce Gentiles?—But I will endure. JOHN. And then perchance 'twill please the saintly Simon, When he hath mumbled o'er his two-hour prayers, That we do ope our gates, and sally forth To combat the uncircumcised— SIMON. Thy scoffs Fall on me as the thin and scattering rain Upon our Temple. If thou art here to urge That, with confederate valiant resolution, We burst upon the enemies of Jerusalem; The thunder followeth not the lightning's flash More swiftly than my warlike execution Shall follow the fierce trumpet of thy wrath! JOHN. But hast thou ponder'd well, if still there be not Some holy fast, new moon, or rigid sabbath, Which may excuse a tame and coward peace For one day longer to your men of Edom? HIGH-PRIEST. Oh! 'tis unwise, ye sworded delegates Of Him who watcheth o'er Jerusalem, Thus day by day in angry quarrel meeting To glare upon each other, and to waste In civil strife the blood that might preserve us. The Roman conquers, but by Jewish arms. The torrent, that in one broad channel rolling Bears down the labour'd obstacles of man, The o'erstriding bridge, the fix'd and ponderous dam, Being sever'd, in its lazy separate course Suffers control, and stagnates to its end. And so ye fall, because ye do disdain To stand together—like the pines of Lebanon, That when in one vast wood they crown the hill, From their proud heads shake off the uninjuring tempest; But when their single trunks stand bare and naked Before the rushing whirlwind, one by one It hurls the uprooted trunks into the vale. ELEAZAR (apart). Curse on his words of peace! fall John, fall Simon, There falls an enemy of Eleazar. SIMON. Now, John of Galilee, the High-Priest speaks wisely. JOHN. Why, ay, it is the privilege of their office, The solemn grave distinction of their ephod. Even such a discourse as this, so calm, so sage, Did old Mathias hold Simon put to death Mathias the High Priest and his sons, by whom he had been admitted into the city.; and therefore Simon, Unwilling that the vantage of his wisdom Should rob our valour of its boasted fame, Did slay him with his sons upon our wall! SIMON. Peace, son of Belial! or I'll scourge thee back To the harlot chambers of thy loose adulteries. I slew my foe, and where's the armed man That will behold his enemy at his feet, And spare to set his foot upon his neck? The sword was given, and shall the sword not slay?— HIGH-PRIEST. Break off! break off! I hear the Gentile horn Winding along the wide entrenched line. Hear ye it not? hill answers hill, the valleys In their deep channels lengthen out the sound. It rushes down Jehoshaphat, the depths Of Hinnom answer. Hark! again they blow, Chiding you, men of Judah, and insulting Your bare and vacant walls, that now oppose not Their firm array of javelin-hurling men, Slingers, and pourers of the liquid fire. AMARIAH. Blow! blow! and rend the heavens, thou deep-voiced horn! I hear thee, and rejoice at thee. Thou summoner To the storm of battle, thou that dost invite With stern and welcome importunity The warrior soul to that high festival, Where Valour with his armed hand administers The cup of death! JOHN. Again, again it sounds! It doth demand a parley with our chiefs. AMARIAH. Ay, father! and let Israel's chiefs reply In the brave language of their javelin showers, And shouts of furious onset. JOHN. Hold, hot boy! That know'st not the deep luxury of scorn. We'll meet them, Simon, but to scoff at them; We'll dally with their hopes of base surrender, Then mock them, till their haughty captain writhe Beneath the keen and biting contumely. Now, Eleazar, lead the way; brave Simon, I follow thee—Come, men of Israel, come. The Walls of the City. Below—Titus, the Roman Army, Joseph of Jotapata, &amp;c. Above—Simon, John, Eleazar, Amariah, Jews. TITUS. Men of Jerusalem! whose hardy zeal And valiant patience in a cause less desperate Might force the foe to reverence and admire; To you thus speaks again the Queen of Earth, All-conquering Rome!—whose kingdom is, where'er The sunshine beams on living men; beneath The shadow of whose throne the world reposes, And glories in being subjected to her, Even as 'tis subject to the immortal gods— To you, whose mad and mutinous revolt Hath harrow'd all your rich and pleasant land With fiery rapine; sunk your lofty cities To desolate heaps of monumental ashes; Yet with that patience, which becomes the mighty, The endurance of the lion, that disdains The foe whose conquest bears no glory with it, Rome doth command you to lay down your arms, And bow the high front of your proud rebellion, Even to the common level of obedience That holds the rest of humankind. So doing, Ye cancel all the dark and guilty past: Silent Oblivion waits to wipe away The record of your madness and your crimes; And in the stead of bloody Vengeance claiming Her penal due of torture, chains and death, Comes reconciling Mercy. JOHN. Mercy! Roman! With what a humble and a modest truth Thou dost commend thy unpresuming virtues. Ye want not testimonies to your mildness— There, on yon lofty crosses, which surround us, Each with a Jewish corpse sublimely rotting On its most honourable eminence; There's none in all that long and ghastly avenue Whose wind-bleach'd bones depose not of thy mercy. We know our brethren, and we thank thee too; A courteous welcome hast thou given them, Roman, Who have abandon'd us in the hour of peril. They fled to 'scape their ruthless countrymen; And, in good truth, their City of Refuge seems To have found them fair and gentle entertainment Titus crucified round the city those who fled from the famine and the cruelty of the leaders within.—Joseph. v. c. 13. Sometimes, according to Josephus, (lib. v. c. 11.) 500 suffered in one day.. SIMON. Peace, John of Galilee! and I will answer This purple-mantled Captain of the Gentiles; But in far other tone than he is wont To hear about his silken couch of feasting Amid his pamper'd parasites—I speak to thee, Titus, as warrior should accost a warrior. The world, thou boastest, is Rome's slave; the sun Rises and sets upon no realm but yours; Ye plant your giant foot in either ocean, And vaunt that all which ye o'erstride is Rome's. But think ye then, because the common earth Surfeits your pride with homage, that our land, Our separate, peculiar, sacred land, Portion'd and seal'd unto us by the God Who made the round world and the crystal heavens A wond'rous land, where Nature's common course Is strange and out of use, so oft the Lord Invades it with miraculous intervention; Think ye this land shall be a Heathen heritage, An high place for your Moloch? Haughty Gentile, Even now ye walk on ruin and on prodigy. The air ye breathe is heavy and o'ercharged With your dark gathering doom; and if our earth Do yet in its disdain endure the footing Of your arm'd legions, 'tis because it labours With silent throes of expectation, waiting The signal of your scattering. Lo! the mountains Bend o'er you with their huge and lowering shadows, Ready to rush and overwhelm: the winds Do listen panting for the tardy presence Of Him that shall avenge. And there is scorn, Yea, there is laughter, in our fathers' tombs, To think that Heathen conqueror doth aspire To lord it over God's Jerusalem! Yea, in Hell's deep and desolate abode, Where dwell the perish'd kings, the chief of earth; They whose idolatrous warfare erst assail'd The Holy City, and the chosen people; They wait for thee, the associate of their hopes And fatal fall, to join their ruin'd conclave. He whom the Red Sea 'whelm'd with all his host, Pharaoh, the Egyptian; and the kings of Canaan; The Philistine, the Dagon worshipper; Moab, and Edom, and fierce Amalek; And he of Babylon, whose multitudes, Even on the hills where gleam your myriad spears The camp of Titus comprehended the space called the “Assyrian's Camp.”, In one brief night the invisible Angel swept With the dark, noiseless shadow of his wing, And morn beheld the fierce and riotous camp One cold, and mute, and tombless cemetery, Sennacherib: all, all are risen, are moved; Yea, they take up the taunting song of welcome To him who, like themselves, hath madly warr'd 'Gainst Zion's walls, and miserably fallen Before the avenging God of Israel! THE JEWS. Oh, holy Simon! Oh, prophetic Simon! Lead thou, lead thou against the Gentile host, And we will ask no Angel breath to blast them. The valour of her children soon shall scatter The spoiler from the rescued walls of Salem, Even till the wolves of Palestine are glutted With Roman carnage. AMARIAH. Blow, ye sacred priests, Your trumpets, as when Jericho of old Cast down its prostrate walls at Joshua's feet! PLACIDUS. Let the Jew speak, the captive of Jotapata; Haply they'll reverence one, and him the bravest Of their own kindred. TERENTIUS. See! he speaks to them; And they do listen, though their menacing brows Lower with a darker and more furious hate. JOSEPH. Yet, yet a little while—ye see me rise, Oh, men of Israel, brethren, countrymen! Even from the earth ye see me rise, where lone, And sorrowful, and fasting, I have sate Compare Josephus, B. J. v. 9. 3. These three long days; sad sackcloth on the limbs Which once were wont to wear a soldier's raiment, And ashes on the head, which ye of old Did honour, when its helmed glories shone Before you in the paths of battle. Hear me, Ye that, as I, adore the Law, the Prophets; And at the Ineffable thrice-Holiest name Bow down your awe-struck foreheads to the ground. I am not here to tell you, men of Israel, That it is madness to contend with Rome; That it were wisdom to submit and follow The common fortunes of the universe; For ye would answer, that 'tis glorious madness To stand alone amid the enslaved world Freedom's last desperate champions: ye would answer, That the slave's wisdom to the free-born man Is basest folly. Oh, my countrymen! Before no earthly king do I command you To fall subservient, not all-conquering Cæsar, But in a mightier name I summon you, The King of Kings! He, he is manifest In the dark visitation that is on you. 'Tis He, whose loosed and raging ministers, Wild War, gaunt Famine, leprous Pestilence, But execute his delegated wrath. Yea, by the fulness of your crimes, 'tis He! Alas! shall I weep o'er thee, or go down And grovel in the dust, and hide myself From mine own shame? Oh, thou defiled Jerusalem! That drinkest thine own blood as from a fountain; That hast piled up the fabric of thy guilt To such portentous height, that earth is darken'd With its huge shadow—that dost boast the monuments Of murder'd prophets, and dost make the robes Of God's High-priest a title and a claim To bloodiest slaughter—thou that every day Dost trample down the thunder-given Law, Even with the pride and joy of him that treads The purple vintage—And oh thou, our Temple! That wert of old the Beauty of Holiness, The chosen, unapproachable abode Of Him which dwelt between the cherubim, Thou art a charnel-house, and sepulchre Of slaughter'd men, a common butchery Of civil strife;—and hence proclaim I, brethren, It is the Lord who doth avenge his own: The Lord, who gives you over to the wicked, That ye may perish by their wickedness. Oh! ye that do disdain to be Rome's slaves, And yet are sold unto a baser bondage, One that, like iron, eats into your souls. Robbers, and Zealots, and wild Edomites! Yea, these are they that sit in Moses' seat, Wield Joshua's sword, and fill the throne of David; Yea, these are they— AMARIAH. I'll hear no more—the foe Claims from our lips the privilege of reply. Here is our answer to the renegade, A javelin to his pale and coward heart Josephus gives more than one speech which he addressed to his countrymen. They only mocked and once wounded him.! JOSEPH. I am struck, but not to death! that yet is wanting To Israel's guilt. JEWS. Oh, noble Amariah! Well hast thou spoken; well hast thou replied! Lead—lead—we'll follow noble Amariah! TITUS. Now, Mercy, to the winds! I cast thee off— My soul's forbidden luxury, I abjure thee! Thou much-abused attribute of gods And godlike men. 'Twas nature's final struggle; And now, whate'er thou art, thou unseen prompter! That in the secret chambers of my soul Darkly abidest, and hast still rebuked The soft compunctious weakness of mine heart, I here surrender thee myself. Now wield me Thine instrument of havoc and of horror, Thine to the extremest limits of revenge; Till not a single stone of yon proud city Remain; and even the vestiges of ruin Be utterly blotted from the face of earth! Streets of Jerusalem near the Inner Wall. MIRIAM, SALONE. MIRIAM. Sweet sister, whither in such haste? SALONE. And know'st thou not My customary seat, where I look down And see the glorious battle deepen round me? Oh! it is spirit-stirring to behold The crimson garments waving in the dust, The eagles glancing in the clouded sunshine. MIRIAM. Salone! in this dark and solemn hour, Were it not wiser that the weak and helpless, Bearing their portion in the common danger, Should join their feeble efforts to defend— Should be upon their knees in fervent prayer Unto the Lord of Battles? SALONE. Yes; I know That Zion's daughters are set forth to lead Their suppliant procession to the gates Of the Holy Temple. But Salone goes Where she may see the God whom they adore In the stern deeds of valiant men, who war To save that Temple from the dust. Behold! I mount my throne, and here I sit the queen Of the majestic tumult that beneath me Is maddening into conflict. Lo! I bind My dark locks, that they spread not o'er my sight. Now flash the bright sun from your gleaming arms, Shake it in broad sheets from your banner folds, Mine eyes will still endure the blaze, and pierce The thickest! MIRIAM. And thou hast no tears to blind thee? SALONE. Behold! behold! from Olivet they pour, Thousands on thousands, in their martial order. Kedron's dark valley, like Gennesareth, When over it the cold moon shines through storms, Topping its dark waves with uncertain light, Is tossing with wild plumes and gleaming spears. Solemnly the stern lictors move, and brandish Their rod-bound axes; and the eagles seem, With wings dispread, to watch their time for swooping! The towers are moving on; and lo! the engines, As though instinct with life, come heavily labouring Upon their ponderous wheels; they nod destruction Against our walls. Lo! lo, our gates fly open: There Eleazar—there the mighty John— Ben Cathla there, and Edom's crested sons. Oh! what a blaze of glory gathers round them! How proudly move they in invincible strength! MIRIAM. And thou canst speak thus with a steadfast voice, When in one hour may death have laid in the dust Those breathing, moving, valiant multitudes? SALONE. And thou! oh thou, that movest to the battle Even like the mountain stag to the running river, Pause, pause, that I may gaze my fill!— MIRIAM. Our father! Salone! is't our father that thou seest? SALONE. Lo! lo! the war hath broken off to admire him! The glory of his presence awes the conflict! The son of Cæsar on his armed steed Rises, impatient of the plumed helms That from his sight conceal young Amariah. MIRIAM. Alas! what means she? Hear me yet a word! I will return or e'er the wounded men Require our soft and healing hands to soothe them. Thou'lt not forget, Salone—if thou seest Our father in the fearful hour of peril, Lift up thy hands and pray. SALONE. To gaze on him— It is like gazing on the morning sun, When he comes scattering from his burning orb The vapourish clouds! MIRIAM. She hears, she heeds me not. And here's a sight and sound to me more welcome Than the wild fray of men who slay and die— Our maidens on their way to the Holy Temple. I'll mingle with them, and I'll pray with them; But through a name, by them unknown or scorn'd, My prayers shall mount to heaven. Behold them here! Behold them, how unlike to what they were! Oh! virgin daughters of Jerusalem! Ye were a garden once of Hermon's lilies, That bashfully upon their tremulous stems Bow to the wooing breath of the sweet spring. Graceful ye were! there needed not the tone Of tabret, harp, or lute, to modulate Your soft harmonious footsteps; your light tread Fell like a natural music. Ah! how deeply Hath the cold blight of misery prey'd upon you. How heavily ye drag your weary footsteps, Each like a mother mourning her one child. Ah me! I feel it almost as a sin, To be so much less sad, less miserable. CHORUS. King of Kings! and Lord of Lords! Thus we move, our sad steps timing To our cymbals' feeblest chiming, Where thy House its rest accords. Chased and wounded birds are we, Through the dark air fled to thee; To the shadow of thy wings, Lord of Lords! and King of Kings! Behold, oh Lord! the Heathen tread See Psalm, lxxx, 7, &amp;c. The branches of thy fruitful vine, That its luxurious tendrils spread O'er all the hills of Palestine. And now the wild boar comes to waste Even us, the greenest boughs and last, That, drinking of thy choicest dew, On Zion's hill in beauty grew. No! by the marvels of thine hand, Thou still wilt save thy chosen land! By all thine ancient mercies shown, By all our fathers' foes o'erthrown; By the Egyptian's car-borne host, Scatter'd on the Red Sea coast; By that wide and bloodless slaughter Underneath the drowning water. Like us in utter helplessness, In their last and worst distress— On the sand and sea-weed lying, Israel pour'd her doleful sighing; While before the deep sea flow'd, And behind fierce Egypt rode— To their fathers' God they pray'd, To the Lord of Hosts for aid. On the margin of the flood With lifted rod the Prophet stood; And the summon'd east wind blew, And aside it sternly threw The gather'd waves, that took their stand, Like crystal rocks, on either hand, Or walls of sea-green marble piled Round some irregular city wild. Then the light of morning lay On the wonder-paved way, Where the treasures of the deep In their caves of coral sleep. The profound abysses, where Was never sound from upper air, Rang with Israel's chanted words, King of Kings! and Lord of Lords! Then with bow and banner glancing, On exulting Egypt came, With her chosen horsemen prancing, And her cars on wheels of flame, In a rich and boastful ring All around her furious king. But the Lord from out his cloud, The Lord look'd down upon the proud; And the host drave heavily Down the deep bosom of the sea. With a quick and sudden swell Prone the liquid ramparts fell; Over horse, and over car, Over every man of war, Over Pharaoh's crown of gold, The loud thundering billows roll'd. As the level waters spread Down they sank, they sank like lead, Down without a cry or groan. And the morning sun, that shone On myriads of bright-armed men, Its meridian radiance then Cast on a wide sea, heaving, as of yore, Against a silent, solitary shore. Then did Israel's maidens sing, Then did Israel's timbrels ring, To him, the King of Kings! that in the sea, The Lord of Lords! had triumph'd gloriously. And our timbrels' flashing chords, King of Kings! and Lord of Lords! Shall they not attuned be Once again to victory? Lo! a glorious triumph now; Lo! against thy people come A mightier Pharaoh! wilt not thou Craze the chariot wheels of Rome? Will not, like the Red Sea wave, Thy stern anger overthrow? And from worse than bondage save, From sadder than Egyptian woe, Those whose silver cymbals glance, Those who lead the suppliant dance, Thy race, the only race that sings “Lord of Lords! and King of Kings!” Streets of Jerusalem—Evening. MIRIAM. Ah me! ungentle Eve, how long thou lingerest! Oh! when it was a grief to me to lose Yon azure mountains, and the lovely vales That from our city walls seem wandering on Under the cedar-tufted precipices; With what an envious and a hurrying swiftness Didst thou descend, and pour thy mantling dews And dew-like silence o'er the face of things; Shrouding each spot I loved the most with suddenest And deepest darkness; making mute the groves Where the birds nestled under the still leaves! But now, how slowly, heavily thou fallest! Now, when thou mightest hush the angry din Of battle, and conceal the murtherous foes From mutual slaughter, and pour oil and wine Into the aching hurts of wounded men! But is it therefore only that I chide thee With querulous impatience? will the night Once more, the secret, counsel-keeping night, Veil the dark path which leads to Siloe's fountain? Which leads—why should I blush to add—to Javan? Oh thou, my teacher! I forgot thee not This morning in the Temple—I forgot not The name thou taught'st me to adore,—nor thee— But what have I to do with thoughts like these, While all around the stunning battle roars Like a gorged lion o'er his mangled prey? Alas! alas! but the human appetite For shedding blood,—that is insatiate! —Time was, that if I heard the sound of arms, My heart would shudder, and my limbs would fail. When, to have seen a dying man had been A dark event, that with its fearful memory Had haunted many a sad and sleepless night. But now—now— SALONE, MIRIAM. MIRIAM. Sister! my Salone! Sister! Why art thou flying with that frantic mien, Thy veil cast back and streaming with thine hair? Oh, harbinger of misery! I read A sad disastrous story in thy face; 'Tis o'er, and God hath given the city of David Unto the stranger. SALONE. Oh! not yet; our wall, Our last, our strongest wall, is still unshaken, Though the fierce engines with their brazen heads Strike at it sternly and incessantly. MIRIAM. Then God preserve the lost! and oh, our father! SALONE. All is not lost! for Amariah stands Amid the rushing sheets of molten fire, Even like an Angel in the flaming centre Of the sun's noontide orb— Hark! hark!—who comes? SIMON. Back—back—I say, by— MIRIAM. 'Tis my father's voice! It sounds in wrath, perhaps in blasphemy; Yet 'tis my living father's voice—He's here. SIMON, MIRIAM, SALONE. SIMON. Now may your native towers rush o'er your heads With horrible downfal, may the treacherous stones Start underneath your footing, cast you down For the iron wheels of vengeance to rush o'er you— Flight! flight! still flight;—Oh, infidel renegades! The above, John, Amariah, High-Priest, &amp;c. SIMON. Now by the living God of Israel, John! Your silken slaves, your golden sandal'd men,— Your men! I should have said, your girls of Galilee!— They will not soil their dainty hands with blood. Their myrrh-dew'd locks are all too smoothly curl'd To let the riotous and dishevelling airs Of battle violate their crisped neatness. Oh! their nice mincing steps are all unfit To tread the red and slippery paths of war; Yet they can trip it lightly when they turn To fly— JOHN. Thou lying and injurious Pharisee! For every man of thine that in the trenches Hardly hath consented to lay down his life, Twice ten of mine have leap'd from off the walls, Grasping a Gentile by the shivering helm, And proudly died upon his dying foe. But tell thou me, thou only faithful Simon! Where are the men of Edom, whom we saw Stretching their amicable hands in parley, And quietly mingling with the unharming foe? SIMON. Where are they? where the traitors meet, where all The foes of Simon and Jerusalem, In th' everlasting fire! I slew them, John,— Thou saw'st my red hand glorious with their blood. JOHN. False traitors! in their very treachery false; They would betray without their lord—In truth, Treason, like empire, brooks not rivalry. SIMON. Now by the bones of Abraham our father, I do accuse thee here, false John of Galilee! Or, if the title please thee, John the Tyrant! Here, in our arm'd, embattled Sanhedrin, Thou art our fall's prime cause, and fatal origin! From thee, as from a foul and poisonous fount, Pour the black waters of calamity O'er Judah's land! God hates thee, man of Belial! And the destroying bolts that fall on thee From the insulted heavens, blast all around thee With spacious and unsparing desolation. Hear me, ye men of Israel! do ye wonder That all your baffled valour hath recoil'd From the fierce Gentile onset? that your walls Are prostrate, and your last hath scarce repell'd But now the flush'd invader? 'Tis from this— That the Holy City will not be defended By womanish men and loose adulterers. Hear me, I say, this son of Gischala, This lustful tyrant, hath he not defiled Your daughters, in the open face of day Done deeds of shame, which midnight hath no darkness So deep as to conceal? It is his pride T' offend high heaven with crimes before unknown. Hath he not mock'd the austere and solemn fasts, And sabbaths of our Law, by revellings And most heaven-tainting wantonness? Yea, more, Hath he not made God's festivals a false And fraudful pretext for his deeds of guilt; Yea, on the day of the Unleavened Bread, Even in the garb and with the speech of worship, Went he not up into the very Temple This was the mode in which John surprised Eleazar, who before was in possession of the Temple.? And there before the Veil, even in the presence Of th' Holy of Holies, did he not break forth With armed and infuriate violence? Then did the pavement, which was never red But with the guiltless blood of sacrifice, Reek with the indelible and thrice-foulest stain Of human carnage. Yea, with impious steel He slew the brethren that were kneeling with him At the same altar, uttering the same prayers. (Speak, Eleazar, was't not so?—thou dar'st not Affirm, nor canst deny thine own betrayal.) And since that cursed hour of guilty triumph There hath he held the palace of his lusts ?????????????? ?? ??? ?????, ?????? ???? ???????, ?????????? ?? ???? ??????????, ???????? ???????? ??????????. Joseph. lib. iv. c.9, 10. There is a long passage to the same effect., Turning God's Temple to a grove of Belial: Even till men wonder that the pillars start not From their fix'd sockets; that the offended roof Fall not at once, and crush in his own shame The blasphemous invader. Yea, not yet, I have not fathom'd yet his depth of sin. His common banquet is the Bread of Offering, The vessels of the altar are the cups From which he drains his riotous drunkenness. The incense, that was wont to rise to heaven Pure as an infant's breath, now foully stagnates Within the pestilent haunts of his lasciviousness. Can these things be, and yet our favour'd arms Be clad with victory? Can the Lord of Israel For us, the scanty remnant of his worshippers, Neglect to vindicate his tainted shrine, His sanctuary profaned, his outraged Laws? JOHN. Methinks, if Simon had but fought to-day As valiantly as Simon speaks, the foe Had never seen to-morrow's onset— SIMON. Brethren, Yet I demand your audience— JEWS. Hear him! hear The righteous Simon! SIMON. Men of Israel! Why stand ye thus in wonder? where the root Is hollow, can the tree be sound? Man's deeds Are as man's doctrines; and who hopes for aught But wantonness and foul iniquity From that blaspheming and heretical sect, The serpent spawn of Sadoc, that corrupt The Law of Moses and disdain the Prophets? That grossly do defraud the eternal soul Of its immortal heritage, and doom it To rot for ever with its kindred clay In the grave's deep unbroken prison-house? Yea, they dispeople with their infidel creed Heaven of its holy Angels; laugh to scorn That secret band of ministering Spirits; Who therefore, in their indignation, stand Aloof, and gaze upon our gathering ruin With a contemptuous and pitiless scorn. They that were wont to range around our towers Their sunlight-wing'd battalia, and to war Upon our part with adamantine arms. JOHN. Oh! impotent and miserable arguer! Will he who values not the stake as boldly Confront the peril as the man that feels His all upon the hazard? Men of Galilee, The cup of life hath sparkled to our lips, And we have drain'd its tide of love and joy, Till our veins almost burst with o'erwrought rapture. And well we know, that generous cup, once dash'd, Shall never mantle more to the cold lips Of the earth-bound dead. And therefore do we fight For life as for a mistress, that being lost, Is lost for ever. To be what we are Is all we hope or pray for: think ye, then, That we shall tamely yield the contest up, And calmly acquiesce in our extinction? We know that there stands yawning at our feet The gulf, where dark Annihilation dwells With Solitude, her sister; and we fix Our steadfast footing on the perilous verge, And grapple to the last with the fierce foe That seeks to plunge us down; and where's the strength That can subdue despair?—For the other charge, We look not, Simon, to the sky, nor pray For sightless and impalpable messengers To spare us the proud peril of the war. Ourselves are our own Angels! we implore not Or supernatural or spiritual aid; We have our own good arms, that God hath given us, And valiant hearts to wield those mighty arms. SIMON. Oh heavens! oh heavens, ye hear it, and endure it, Outwearied by the all-frequent blasphemy To an indignant patience! and the Just Still, still must suffer the enforced alliance Of men whose fellowship is death and ruin. JOHN. Why, thou acknowledged Prince of Murderers! Captain Assassin! Lord and Chief of Massacre! That pourest blood like water, yet dost deem That thou canst wash the foul and scarlet stain From thy polluted soul as easily As from thy dainty ever-dabbling hands; That wouldst appease with rite and ordinance, And festival, and slavish ceremony, And prayers that weary even the stones thou kneel'st on, The God whose image hourly thou effacest With mangling and remorseless steel! 'Tis well That graves are silent, and that dead men's souls Assert not the proud privilege thou wouldst give them; For if they did, Heaven's vaults would ring so loudly With imprecations 'gainst the righteous Simon, That they would pluck by force a plague upon us, To which the Roman, and the wasting famine, Were soft and healing mercies. SIMON. Liar and slave! There is no rich libation to the All-Just So welcome as the blood of renegades And traitors— MIRIAM (apart). Oh! I dare not listen longer! The big drops stand upon his brow; his voice Is faint and fails, and there's no food at home. The night is dark—I'll go once more, or perish. [Departs unperceived. SIMON. What, John of Galilee! because my voice Is hoarse with speaking of thy crimes, dost scoff, And wag thy head at me, and answer laughter? Now, if thy veins run not pure gall, I'll broach Their tide, and prove if all my creed be false; If traitors' reeking blood smell not to heaven Like a sweet sacrifice. JOHN. Why, ay! the victim Is bound to th' horns of th' altar! Strike, I say, He waits thee—Strike! HIGH-PRIEST. Hold, Chiefs of Israel! Just Simon! valiant John! once more I dare To cast myself between you, the High-Priest, Who by his holy office calls on you To throw aside your trivial private wrongs, And vindicate offence more rank and monstrous. Avenge your God! and then avenge yourselves! The Temple is polluted—Israel's Lord Mock'd in his presence. Prayers from thence have risen, Prayers from the jealous holy Sanctuary, Even to the Crucified Man our fathers slew. JEWS. The Crucified! the Man of Nazareth! HIGH-PRIEST. This morn, as wont, our maidens had gone up To chant their suppliant hymn; and they had raised The song that Israel on the Red Sea shore Took up triumphant; and they closed the strain, That, like th' Egyptian and his car-borne host, The billows of Heaven's wrath might overwhelm The Gentile foe, and so preserve Jerusalem; When at the close and fall a single voice Linger'd upon the note, with, “Be it done Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son.” My spirit shrank within me; horror-struck, I listen'd; all was silence! Then again I look'd upon the veiled damsels, all With one accord took up the swelling strain To him that triumph'd gloriously. I turn'd To the Ark and Mercy Seat, and then again I heard that single, soft, melodious voice, “Lord of Mercies, be it done Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son.” Here, then, assembled Lords of Israel, Whoever be the victim, I demand her; Your wisdom must detect, your justice wreak Fit punishment upon the accursed sacrilege. SALONE (apart). Miriam! Miriam! Ha!—She's fled.—Guilt! Guilt Prophetic of the damning accusation It doth deserve! Apostate! 'twere a sin Against Jerusalem and Heaven to spare thee! HIGH-PRIEST. I do commend you, brethren, for your silence! I see the abhorrence labouring in your hearts, Too deep and too infuriate for words. SIMON. Now, if it were my child, my Sarah's child, The child that she died blessing, I'd not sleep Till the stones crush her. Yea, thus, thus I'd grasp, And hurl destruction on her guilty head. Here, John, I pledge mine hand to thee, till vengeance Seize on the false and insolent blasphemer. SALONE. (Half unveiled, rushing forward, stops irresolutely.) Their eyes oppress me—my heart chokes my voice— And my lips cling together—Oh! my mother, Upon thy death-bed didst thou not beseech us To love each other! HIGH-PRIEST. Veiled maid, what art thou? SALONE. Off! off! the blood of Abraham swells within me— As I cast down my veil, I cast away All fear, all tenderness, all fond remorse. It is too good a death for one so guilty To perish for Jerusalem— [She stands unveiled. SIMON. Salone! HIGH-PRIEST. The admired daughter of the noble Simon! VOICE AT A DISTANCE. Israel! Israel! HIGH-PRIEST. Who is this, that speaks With such a shrilling accent of command? VOICE. Israel! Israel! JEWS. Back! give place! the Prophet! ABIRAM (the false prophet). Israel! Israel! HIGH-PRIEST. Peace! ABIRAM. Ay! peace, I say! The wounds are bound! the blood is staunch'd! and hate Is turn'd to love! and rancorous jealousy To kindred concord! and the clashing swords To bridal sounds! the fury of the feud To revel and the jocund nuptial feast. HIGH-PRIEST. What means Abiram? ABIRAM. It is from on high. Brave Amariah, son of John! Salone, Daughter of Simon! thus I join their hands; And thus I bless the wedded and the beautiful! And thus I bind the Captains of Jerusalem In the strong bonds of unity and peace.— And where is now the wine for the bridegroom's rosy cup In the prophecy of our Saviour concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and that of the world, it is said that, “as in the days of Noe, they shall marry and be given in marriage.” —Matt. xxiv. 38.? And the tabret and the harp for the chamber of the bride? Lo! bright as burnish'd gold the lamps are sparkling up, And the odours of the incense are breathing far and wide; And the maidens' feet are glancing in the virgins' wedding train; And the sad streets of Salem are alive with joy again? THE JEWS. Long live Salone! Long live Amariah! SALONE. Am I awake?—how came I here unveil'd Among the bold and glaring eyes of men? THE JEWS. Long live Salone! Long live Amariah! SIMON. He speaks from Heaven—accept'st thou, John of Galilee, Heaven's terms of peace? JOHN. From earth or heaven, I care not— What says my boy? AMARIAH. Oh! rather let me ask, What says the maid? Oh! raven-hair'd Salone, Why dost thou crowd thy jealous veil around thee? Look on me freely; beauteous in thy freedom; As when this morn I saw thee, on our walls, Thy hair cast back, and bare thy marble brow To the bright wooing of the enamour'd sun: They were my banner, Beauty! those dark locks; And in the battle 'twas my pride, my strength, To think that eyes like thine were gazing on me. SALONE. Oh no, thou saw'st me not!—Oh, Amariah! What Prophets speak must be fulfill'd. 'Twere vain T' oppose at once the will of Heaven—and thee. JOHN. Now, if there be enough of generous food, A cup of wine in all the wasted city, We'll have a jocund revel. SIMON. Prophet Abiram, I have a question for thy secret ear. Thou man, whose eyes are purged from earthly film, Seest thou no further down the tide of time? Beyond this bridal nothing?—Answer me! For it should seem this designated union Of two so noble, this conspiring blood Of Israel's chiefs, portends some glorious fruit To ripen in the deep futurity. ABIRAM. Simon, what meanest thou? SIMON. The Hope of Israel? Shall it not dawn from darkness? Oh! begot In Judah's hour of peril, and conceived In her extreme of agony, what birth So meet and fitting for the great Discomfiter? ABIRAM. A light falls on me. SIMON. Prophet! what shall dye The robe of purple with so bright a grain As Roman blood? Before our gates are met The lords of empire, and our walls may laugh Their siege to scorn, even till the Branch be grown That's not yet planted—Yea, the wrested sceptre Of earth, the sole dominion—Back, Abiram, To thy prophetic cave—kneel, pray, fast, weep; And thou shalt bless us with far nobler tidings, And we will kiss thy feet, thou Harbinger Of Judah's glory— Now lead on the Bridal. Blow, trumpets! shout, exulting Israel! Shout, Amariah! shout again, Salone! Shout louder yet, the Bridegroom and the Bride! Rejoice, oh Zion, now on all thy hills! City of David, through thy streets rejoice! Fountain of Siloe—Night—An approaching Storm. MIRIAM. He is not here! and yet he might have known, That the cold gloom of the tempestuous skies Could never change a faithful heart like mine. He might have known me not a maid to love Under the melting moonlight, and soft stars, And to fall off in darkness and in storm. Ah! seal'd for ever be my slanderous lips! Alas! it is the bitterest pang of misery That it will force from us unworthy doubts Of the most tried and true. Oh, Javan, Javan! It was but now that with presumptuous heart I did repine against the all-gracious heavens, That wrapt me round in charitable darkness, Because my erring feet had well-nigh miss'd Their known familiar path. JAVAN, MIRIAM. JAVAN. What's there? I see A white and spirit-like gleaming—It must be! I see her not, yet feel that it is Miriam, By the indistinct and dimly visible grace That haunts her motions; by her tread, that falls Trembling and soft like moonlight on the earth. What dost thou here? now—now? where every moment The soldiers prowl, and meeting sentinels Challenge each other? I have watch'd for thee As prisoners for the hour of their deliverance; Yet did I pray, love! that thou might'st not come, Even that thou might'st be faithless to thy vows, Rather than meet this peril—Miriam, Why art thou here? MIRIAM. Does Javan ask me why? Because I saw my father pine with hunger— Because—I never hope to come again. JAVAN. Too true! this night, this fatal night, if Heaven Strike not their conquering host, the foe achieves His tardy victory. Round the shatter'd walls There is the smother'd hum of preparation. With stealthy footsteps, and with muffled arms, Along the trenches, round the lowering engines, I saw them gathering: men stood whispering men, As though revealing some portentous secret; At every sound cried, ‘Hist!’ and look'd reproachfully Upon each other. Now and then a light From some far part of the encircling camp Breaks suddenly out, and then is quench'd as suddenly. The forced unnatural quiet, that pervades Those myriads of arm'd and sleepless warriors, Presages earthly tempest; as yon clouds, That in their mute and ponderous blackness hang Over our heads, a tumult in the skies— The earth and heaven alike are terribly calm! MIRIAM. Alas! alas! give me the food! let's say Farewell, as fondly as a dying man Should say it to a dying woman! JAVAN. Miriam! It shall not be. He, He hath given command, That when the signs are manifest, we should flee Unto the mountains Matt. xxiv. 16, and following verses.. MIRIAM. Javan, tempt me not: My soul is weak. Hast thou not said of old, How dangerous 'tis to wrest the words of truth To the excusing our own fond desires? There's an eternal mandate, unrepeal'd, Nor e'er to be rescinded, “Love thy Father!” God speaks with many voices; one in the heart, True though instinctive; one in the Holy Law, The first that's coupled with a gracious promise. JAVAN. Yet are his words, “Leave all, and follow me, “Thou shalt not love thy father more than me Matt. x. 7.”— Dar'st disobey them? MIRIAM. Javan, while I tread The path of duty I am following him, And loving whom I ought to love, love him. JAVAN. If thou couldst save or succour—if this night Were not the last— MIRIAM. Oh, dearest, think awhile! It matters little at what hour o' the day The righteous falls asleep; death cannot come To him untimely who is fit to die: The less of this cold world, the more of heaven; The briefer life, the earlier immortality. But every moment to the man of guilt And bloodshed, one like—ah me! like my father, Each instant rescued from the grasp of death, May be a blessed chosen opportunity For the everlasting mercy—Think what 'tis For time's minutest period to delay An infidel's death, a murderer's— JAVAN. Go! go, dearest! If I were dying, I would have thee go— Oh! thou enspher'd, unearthly loveliness! Danger may gather round thee, like the clouds Round one of heaven's pure stars, thou'lt hold within Thy course unsullied. MIRIAM. This is worse than all! Oh! mock not thus with wild extravagant praise A very weak and most unworthy girl. Javan, one last, one parting word with thee— There have been times, when I have said light words, As maidens use, that made thy kind heart bleed; There have been moments, when I have seen thee sad, And cruelly have sported with thy sadness: I have been proud, oh! very proud, to hear Thy fond lips dwell on beauty, when thine eyes Were on this thin and wasted form of mine. Forgive me, oh! forgive me, for I deem'd The hour would surely come, when the fond bride Might well repay the maiden's waywardness. Oh! look not thus o'er-joyed, for if I thought We e'er could meet again this side the grave, Trust me, I had been charier of my tenderness. Yet one word more—I do mistrust thee, Javan, Though coldly thou dost labour to conceal it; Thou hast some frantic scheme to risk for mine Thy precious life—Beseech thee, heap not thou More sorrows on the o'erburthen'd. JAVAN. Think'st thou, then, I have no trust but in this arm of flesh To save thee? MIRIAM. Dearest Javan! pray not thou That I may live, that is too wild a pray'r; That I may die unspotted, be thy suit To Him who loves the spotless. JAVAN. Ha—the thought! It pierces like a sword into my heart! MIRIAM. And think'st thou mine unwounded;—Fare thee well! Our presence does but rack each other's souls. Farewell! and if thou lov'st when I am dead, May she be to thee all I hoped to be. JAVAN. Go—go— MIRIAM. Thou bidd'st me part, and yet detain'st me With clinging grasp—ah no, 'tis I clasp thee. I knew not that my fond unconscious hand Had been so bold—Oh, Javan! ere the morn 'T will have no power to offend thee—'t will be cold. JAVAN. Offend me! Miriam, when thou'rt above Among the Saints, and I in the sinful world, How terrible it were if I should forfeit The hope of meeting thee in blessedness! MIRIAM. Forfeit! with faith like thine? JAVAN. Thou well rebukest me. To thy Redeemer I commit thee now. To leave thee here, or take thee to himself. Farewell, farewell! the life of this sad heart,— Dearer than life—I look for thee, and lo! Nought but blind darkness— Save where yon mad city, As though at peace and in luxurious joy, Is hanging out her bright and festive lamps. There have been tears from holier eyes than mine Pour'd o'er thee, Zion! yea, the Son of Man This thy devoted hour foresaw and wept. And I—can I refrain from weeping? Yes, My country! in thy darker destiny Will I awhile forget my own distress. I feel it now, the sad, the coming hour; The signs are full, and never shall the sun Shine on the cedar roofs of Salem more; Her tale of splendor now is told and done: Her wine-cup of festivity is spilt, And all is o'er, her grandeur, and her guilt. Oh! fair and favour'd city, where of old The balmy airs were rich with melody, That led her pomp beneath the cloudless sky In vestments flaming with the orient gold; Her gold is dim, and mute her music's voice; The Heathen o'er her perish'd pomp rejoice. How stately then was every palm-deck'd street, Down which the maidens danced with tinkling feet; How proud the elders in the lofty gate! How crowded all her nation's solemn feasts With white-rob'd Levites and high-mitred Priests; How gorgeous all her Temple's sacred state! Her streets are razed, her maidens sold for slaves, Her gates thrown down, her elders in their graves; Her feasts are holden 'mid the Gentiles' scorn, By stealth her Priesthood's holy garments worn; And where her Temple crown'd the glittering rock, The wandering shepherd folds his evening flock. When shall the work, the work of death begin? When come the avengers of proud Judah's sin?— Aceldama! accursed and guilty ground, Gird all the city in thy dismal bound, Her price is paid, and she is sold like thou: Let every ancient monument and tomb Enlarge the border of its vaulted gloom, Their spacious chambers all are wanted now. But never more shall yon lost city need Those secret places for her future dead; Of all her children, when this night is pass'd, Devoted Salem's darkest, and her last, Of all her children none is left to her, Save those whose house is in the sepulchre. Yet, guilty city, who shall mourn for thee? Shall Christian voices wail thy devastation? Look down! look down, avenged Calvary! Upon thy late yet dreadful expiation. Oh! long foretold, though slow accomplished fate, “Her house is left unto her desolate;” Proud Cæsar's ploughshare, o'er her ruins driven, Fulfils at length the tardy doom of Heaven; The wrathful vial's drops at length are pour'd On the rebellious race that crucified their Lord! Streets of Jerusalem—Night. MANY JEWS MEETING. FIRST JEW. Saw ye it, father? saw ye what the city Stands gazing at The prodigies are related by Josephus in a magnificent page of historic description.? As I pass'd through the streets There were pale women wandering up and down; And on the housetops there were haggard faces Turn'd to the heavens, where the ghostly light Fell on them. Even the prowling plunderers, That break our houses for suspected food, Their quick and stealthful footsteps check, and gasp In wonder. They, that in deep weariness, Or wounded in the battle of the morn, Had cast themselves to slumber on the stones, Lift up their drowsy heads, and languidly Do shudder at the sight. SECOND JEW. What sight? what say'st thou? FIRST JEW. The star, the star, the fiery-tressed star, That all this fatal year hath hung in the heavens Above us, gleaming like a bloody sword, Twice hath it moved. Men cried aloud, “A tempest!” And there was blackness, as of thunder clouds; But yet that angry sign glared fiercely through them, And the third time, with slow and solemn motion, 'Twas shaken and brandish'd. SECOND JEW. Timorous boy! thou speak'st As though these things were strange. Why now we sleep With prodigies ablaze in all the heavens, And the earth teeming with portentous signs, As sound as when the moon and constant stars Beam'd quietly upon the slumbering earth Their customary fires. Dost thou remember, At Pentecost, when all the land of Judah Stood round the Altar, at the dead of night, A Light broke out, and all the Temple shone With the meteorous glory? 'twas not like The light of sun or moon, but it was clear And bright as either, only that it wither'd Men's faces to a hue like death. THIRD JEW. 'Twas strange! And, if I err not, on that very day The Priest led forth the spotless sacrifice, And, as he led it, it fell down, and cast Its young upon the sacred pavement. FOURTH JEW. Brethren, Have ye forgot the eve, when war broke out Even in the heavens? all the wide northern sky Was rocking with arm'd men and fiery chariots. With an abrupt and sudden noiselessness, Wildly, confusedly, they cross'd and mingled, As when the Red Sea waves dash'd to and fro The crazed cars of Pharaoh— THIRD JEW. Who comes here In his white robes so hastily? FIRST JEW. 'Tis the Levite, The Holy Aaron. LEVITE. Brethren! Oh, my Brethren! THE JEWS. Speak, Rabbi, all our souls thirst for thy words. LEVITE. But now within the Temple, as I minister'd, There was a silence round us; the wild sounds Of the o'erwearied war had fallen asleep: A silence, even as though all earth were fix'd Like us in adoration—when the gate, The Eastern gate, with all its ponderous bars And bolts of iron, started wide asunder, And all the strength of man doth vainly toil To close the stubborn and rebellious leaves. FIRST JEW. What now? ANOTHER JEW. What now! why all things sad and monstrous. The Prophets stand aghast, and vainly seek, Amid the thronging and tumultuous signs Which crowd this wild disastrous night, the intent Of the Eternal. Wonder breaks o'er wonder, As clouds roll o'er each other in the skies; And Terror, wantoning with man's perplexity, No sooner hath infix'd the awed attention On some strange prodigy, than it straight distracts it To a stranger and more fearful. THIRD JEW. Hark! what's there? Fresh horror!— (At a distance.) To the sound of timbrels sweet The bridal ceremonies are from Calmet, Harmer, and other illustrators of Scripture. It is a singular tradition that the use of the crown was discontinued after the fall of Jerusalem. A few peculiarities are adopted from an account of a Maronite wedding in Harmer., Moving slow our solemn feet, We have borne thee on the road, To the virgin's blest abode; With thy yellow torches gleaming And thy scarlet mantle streaming, And the canopy above Swaying as we slowly move. Thou hast left the joyous feast, And the mirth and wine have ceast; And now we set thee down before The jealously-unclosing door; That the favour'd youth admits Where the veiled virgin sits In the bliss of maiden fear, Waiting our soft tread to hear, And the music's brisker din, At the bridegroom's entering in, Entering in a welcome guest To the chamber of his rest. SECOND JEW. It is the bridal song of Amariah And fair Salone. In the house of Simon The rites are held; nor bears the Bridegroom home His plighted Spouse, but there doth deck his chamber; These perilous times dispensing with the rigor Of ancient usage— VOICE WITHIN. Woe! woe! woe! FIRST JEW. Alas! The son of Hananiah! is't not he? THIRD JEW. Whom said'st? SECOND JEW. Art thou a stranger in Jerusalem, That thou rememberest not that fearful man? FOURTH JEW. Speak! speak! we know not all. SECOND JEW. Why thus it was: A rude and homely dresser of the vine, He had come up to the Feast of Tabernacles, When suddenly a spirit fell upon him, Evil or good we know not. Ever since (And now seven years are past since it befel, Our city then being prosperous and at peace,) He hath gone wandering through the darkling streets At midnight under the cold quiet stars; He hath gone wandering through the crowded market At noonday under the bright blazing sun, With that one ominous cry of “Woe, woe, woe!” Some scoff'd and mock'd him, some would give him food; He neither curs'd the one, nor thank'd the other. The Sanhedrin bade scourge him, and myself Beheld him lash'd, till the bare bones stood out Through the maim'd flesh, still, still he only cried, “Woe to the City,” till his patience wearied The angry persecutors. When they freed him, 'Twas still the same, the incessant “Woe, woe, woe!” But when our siege began, awhile he ceased, As though his prophecy were fulfill'd; till now We had not heard his dire and boding voice. VOICE WITHIN. Woe! woe! woe! JOSHUA, the Son of Hananiah. Woe! woe! A voice from the East! a voice from the West! From the four winds a voice against Jerusalem! A voice against the Temple of the Lord! A voice against the Bridegrooms and the Brides! A voice against all people of the land! Woe! woe! woe! SECOND JEW. They are the very words, the very voice Which we have heard so long. And yet, methinks, There is a mournful triumph in the tone Ne'er heard before. His eyes, that were of old Fix'd on the earth, now wander all abroad, As though the tardy consummation Afflicted him with wonder—Hark! again. CHORUS OF MAIDENS. Now the jocund song is thine, Bride of David's kingly line; How thy dove-like bosom trembleth, And thy shrouded eye resembleth Violets, when the dews of eve A moist and tremulous glitter leave On the bashful sealed lid! Close within the bride-veil hid, Motionless thou sitt'st and mute; Save that at the soft salute Of each entering maiden friend Thou dost rise and softly bend. Hark! a brisker, merrier glee! The door unfolds,—'tis he, 'tis he. Thus we lift our lamps to meet him, Thus we touch our lutes to greet him. Thou shalt give a fonder meeting, Thou shalt give a tenderer greeting. JOSHUA. Woe! woe! A voice from the East! a voice from the West! From the four winds a voice against Jerusalem! A voice against the Temple of the Lord! A voice against the Bridegrooms and the Brides! A voice against all people of the land! Woe woe— [Bursts away, followed by Second Jew. FIRST JEW. Didst speak? THIRD JEW. No. FOURTH JEW. Look'd he on us as he spake? FIRST JEW (to the Second returning.) Thou follow'dst him! what now? SECOND JEW. 'Twas a True Prophet! THE JEWS. Wherefore? Where went he? SECOND JEW. To the outer wall; And there he suddenly cried out and sternly, “A voice against the son of Hananiah! “Woe, woe!” and at the instant, whether struck By a chance stone from the enemy's engines, down He sank and died!— THIRD JEW. There's some one comes this way— Art sure he died indeed? LEVITE. It is the High-Priest. The ephod gleams through the pale lowering night; The breastplate gems, and the pure mitre-gold, Shine lamplike, and the bells that fringe his robe Chime faintly. HIGH-PRIEST. Israel, hear! I do beseech you, Brethren, give ear!— SECOND JEW. Who's he that will not hear The words of God's High-Priest? HIGH-PRIEST. It was but now I sate within the Temple, in the court That's consecrate to mine office—Your eyes wander— JEWS. Go on!— HIGH-PRIEST. Why hearken then!—Upon a sudden The pavement seem'd to swell beneath my feet, And the Veil shiver'd, and the pillars rock'd. And there, within the very Holy of Holies, There, from behind the winged Cherubim, Where the Ark stood, noise, hurried and tumultuous, Was heard, as when a king with all his host Doth quit his palace. And anon, a voice, Or voices, half in grief, half anger, yet Nor human grief nor anger; even it seem'd As though the hoarse and rolling thunder spake With the articulate words of man, it said, “Let us depart!” JEWS. Most terrible! What follow'd? Speak on! speak on! HIGH-PRIEST. I know not why, I felt As though an outcast from the abandon'd Temple, And fled. JEWS. Oh God! and Father of our Fathers! Dost thou desert us? CHORUS OF YOUTHS AND MAIDENS. Under a happy planet art thou led, Oh, chosen Virgin! to thy bridal bed. So put thou off thy soft and bashful sadness, And wipe away the timid maiden tear,— Lo! redolent with the Prophet's oil of gladness, And mark'd by heaven, the Bridegroom Youth is here. FIRST JEW. Hark—hark! an armed tread! SECOND JEW. The bold Ben Cathla. BEN CATHLA. Ay, ye are met, all met, as in a mart, T' exchange against each other your dark tales Of this night's fearful prodigies. I know it, By the inquisitive and half-suspicious looks With which ye eye each other, ye do wish To disbelieve all ye have heard, and yet Ye dare not. If ye have seen the moon unsphered, And the stars fall; if the pale sheeted ghosts Have met you wandering, and have pointed at you With ominous designation; yet I scoff Your poor and trivial terrors—Know ye Michol? JEWS. Michol! BEN CATHLA. The noble lady, she whose fathers Dwelt beyond Jordan— SECOND JEW. Yes, we know her, The tender and the delicate of women “The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.” (Deuter. xxviii. 56 and 57.) See also Lamentations, ii. 20. The account of the unnatural mother is detailed in Josephus., That would not set her foot upon the ground For delicacy and very tenderness. BEN CATHLA. The same!—We had gone forth in quest of food, And we had entered many a house, where men Were preying upon meagre herbs and skins; And some were sating upon loathsome things Unutterable the ravening hunger; some, Whom we had plunder'd oft, laugh'd in their agony To see us baffled. At her door she met us, And “We have feasted together heretofore,” She said, “most welcome, warriors!” and she led us, And bade us sit like dear and honour'd guests, While she made ready. Some among us wonder'd, And some spake jeeringly, and thank'd the lady That she had thus with provident care reserved The choicest banquet for our scarcest days. But ever as she busily minister'd, Quick, sudden sobs of laughter broke from her. At length the vessel's covering she raised up, And there it lay— HIGH-PRIEST. What lay?—Thou'rt sick and pale. BEN CATHLA. By earth and heaven, the remnant of a child! A human child!—Ay, start! so started we— Whereat she shriek'd aloud, and clapp'd her hands, “Oh! dainty and fastidious appetites! “The mother feasts upon her babe, and strangers “Loathe the repast”—and then—“My beautiful child! “The treasure of my womb! my bosom's joy!” And then in her cool madness did she spurn us Out of her doors. Oh still—oh still I hear her, And I shall hear her till my day of death. HIGH-PRIEST. Great God of Mercies! this was once thy city! CHORUS. Joy to thee, beautiful and bashful Bride! Joy! for the thrills of pride and joy become thee; Thy curse of barrenness is taken from thee, And thou shalt see the rosy infant sleeping Upon the snowy fountain of thy breast; And thou shalt feel how mothers' hearts are blest By hours of bliss for moment's pain and weeping. Joy to thee! THE ABOVE, SIMON, JOHN. SIMON. Away! what do ye in our midnight streets? Go sleep! go sleep! or we shall have to lash you, When the horn summons to the morning's war, From out your drowsy beds—Away! I say. HIGH-PRIEST. Simon, thou know'st not the dark signs abroad. JOHN. Ay! is't not fearful and most ominous That the sun shines not at deep midnight? Mark me, Ye men with gasping lips and shivering limbs, Thou mitred priest, and ye misnamed warriors, If ye infect with your pale aguish fears Our valiant city, we'll nor leave you limbs To shake, nor voices to complain—T' your homes. SIMON, JOHN. JOHN. In truth, good Simon, I am half your proselyte; Your angels, that do bear such excellent wine, Might shake a faith more firm than ours. SIMON. Brave John, My soul is jocund. Expectation soars Before mine eyes, like to a new-fledged eagle, And stoopeth from her heavens with palms ne'er worn By brows of Israel. Glory mounts with her, Her deep seraphic trumpet swelling loud O'er Zion's gladdening towers. JOHN. Why, then, to sleep. This fight by day, and revel all the night, Need some repose—I'll to my bed—Farewell! SIMON. Brave John, farewell! and I'll to rest, and dream Upon the coming honors of to-morrow. MIRIAM. To-morrow! will that morrow dawn upon thee? I've warn'd them, I have lifted up my voice, As loud as 'twere an angel's, and well nigh Had I betray'd my secret: they but scoff'd, And ask'd how long I had been a prophetess? Then that injurious John did foully taunt me, As though I envied my lost sister's bridal. And when I clung to my dear father's neck, With the close fondness of a last embrace, He shook me from him. But, ah me! how strange! This moment, and the hurrying streets were full As at a festival, now all's so silent That I might hear the footsteps of a child. The sound of dissolute mirth hath ceased, the lamps Are spent, the voice of music broken off. No watchman's tread comes from the silent wall, There are nor lights nor voices in the towers. The hungry have given up their idle search For food, the gazers on the heavens are gone; Even Fear's at rest—all still as in a sepulchre! And thou liest sleeping, oh Jerusalem! A deeper slumber could not fall upon thee, If thou wert desolate of all thy children, And thy razed streets a dwelling-place for owls. I do mistake! this is the Wilderness, The Desert, where winds pass and make no sound, And not the populous city, the besieged And overhung with tempest. Why, my voice, My motion, breaks upon the oppressive stillness Like a forbidden and disturbing sound. The very air's asleep, my feeblest breathing Is audible—I'll think my prayers—and then— —Ha! 'tis the thunder of the Living God! It peals! it crashes! it comes down in fire! Again! it is the engine of the foe, Our walls are dust before it—Wake—oh, wake— Oh Israel!—Oh Jerusalem, awake! Why shouldst thou wake? thy foe is in the heavens! Yea, thy judicial slumber weighs thee down, And gives thee, oh lost city! to the Gentile Defenceless, unresisting. It rolls down, As though the Everlasting raged not now Against our guilty Zion, but did mingle The universal world in our destruction; And all mankind were destined for a sacrifice On Israel's funeral pile. Oh Crucified! Here, here, where thou didst suffer, I beseech thee Even by thy Cross! Hark! now in impious rivalry Man thunders. In the centre of our streets The Gentile trumpet, the triumphant shouts Of onset; and I,—I, a trembling girl, Alone, awake, abroad. Oh, now ye wake. Now ye pour forth, and hideous Massacre, Loathing his bloodless conquest, joys to see you Thus naked and unarm'd—But where's my father?— Upon his couch in dreams of future glory. Oh! where's my sister?—in her bridal bed! MANY JEWS. FIRST JEW. To the Temple! To the Temple! Israel! Israel! Your walls are on the earth, your houses burn Like fires amid the autumnal olive grounds. The Gentile's in the courts of the Lord's house. To the Temple! save or perish with the Temple! SECOND JEW. To the Temple! haste, oh, all ye circumcised! Stay not for wife or child, for gold or treasure! Pause not for light! the heavens are all on fire, The Universal City burns! THIRD JEW. Arms! Arms! Our women fall like doves into the nets Of the fowler, and they dash upon the stones Our innocent babes. Arms! Arms! before we die Let's reap a bloody harvest of revenge. To the Temple! FOURTH JEW. Simon! lo, the valiant Simon. THE ABOVE, SIMON. SIMON. He comes! he comes! the black night blackens with him, And the winds groan beneath his chariot wheels— He comes from heaven, the Avenger of Jerusalem! Ay, strike, proud Roman! fall, thou useless wall! And vail your heads, ye towers, that have discharged Your brief, your fruitless duty of resistance. I've heard thee long, fierce Gentile! th' earthquake shocks Of thy huge engines smote upon my soul, And my soul scorn'd them. Oh! and hear'st not thou One mightier than thyself, that shakes the heavens? Oh pardon, that I thought that He, whose coming Is promised and reveal'd, would calmly wait The tardy throes of human birth. Messiah, I know thee now, I know yon lightning fire Thy robe of glory, and thy steps in heaven Incessant thundering. I had brought mine arms, Mine earthly arms, my breastplate and my sword, To cover and defend me—Oh! but thou Art jealous, nor endur'st that human arm Intrude on thy deliverance. I forswear them, I cast them from me. Helmless, with nor shield Nor sword, I stand, and in my nakedness Wait thee, victorious Roman— A friendly critic, the admirable Bishop Heber (Quarterly Review, vol. xxiii. p. 222), among his other animadversions on the Author's conception of the character of Simon, particularly objected to his coming forth “unarmed and inactive,” and his final surrender on the frustration of his hopes, in the unchecked destruction of, as at length it seemed to him, the heaven-abandoned Temple. Perhaps Simon, the Edomite, may not have been judiciously chosen as the impersonation of this Pharisaic zealotism, which to the last clung to the hope of preternatural deliverance by the Messiah; but, as Simon could not but be the prominent character, and this the predominant feeling which constituted the poetry of this fanaticism, I cannot quite repent of the poetic licence which I have taken; nor can I discover anything incongruous in this high-wrought enthusiasm, either with the ambition, the craft, or the cruelty of Simon. The fact, that to this moment the Jews expected their deliverance from the appearance of the Messiah, appears from Josephus, who assigns, as the cause of the immense multitudes who at this moment had crowded into the Temple and perished in the unrelenting massacre, that a false prophet had predicted that on that very day “God commanded the people to go up to the Temple, to behold the signs of their salvation.” —Joseph. B. J. vi. 5. 2. JEWS. To the Temple! SIMON. Ay, well thou say'st, “to the Temple”—there 'twill be Most visible. In his own house the Lord Will shine most glorious. Shall we not behold The Fathers bursting from their yielding graves, Patriarchs and Priests, and Kings and Prophets, met A host of spectral watchmen, on the towers Of Zion to behold the accomplishing Of every Type and deep Prophetic word? Ay, to the Temple! thither will I too, There bask in all the fulness of the day That breaks at length o'er the long night of Judah. CHORUS OF JEWS, (FLYING TOWARDS THE TEMPLE.) Fly! fly! fly! Clouds, not of incense, from the Temple rise, And there are altar-fires, but not of sacrifice. And there are victims, yet nor bulls nor goats; And Priests are there, but not of Aaron's kin; And he that doth the murtherous rite begin, To stranger Gods his hecatomb devotes; His hecatomb of Israel's chosen race All foully slaughter'd in their Holy Place. Break into joy, ye barren, that ne'er bore “And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days.” —Matt. xxiv. 19.! Rejoice, ye breasts, where ne'er sweet infant hung! From you, from you no smiling babes are wrung, Ye die, but not amid your children's gore. But howl and weep, oh ye that are with child, Ye on whose bosoms unwean'd babes are laid; The sword that's with the mother's blood defiled Still with the infant gluts the insatiate blade. Fly! fly! fly! Fly not, I say, for Death is every where, To keen-eyed Lust all places are the same: There's not a secret chamber in whose lair Our wives can shroud them from th' abhorred shame. Where the sword fails, the fire will find us there, All, all is death—the Gentile or the flame. On to the Temple! Brethren, Israel on! Though every slippery street with carnage swims, Ho! spite of famish'd hearts and wounded limbs, Still, still, while yet there stands one holy stone, Fight for your God, his sacred house to save, Or have its blazing ruins for your grave! The Streets of Jerusalem. MIRIAM. Thou hard firm earth, thou wilt not break before me, And hide me in thy dark and secret bosom! Ye burning towers, ye fall upon your children With a compassionate ruin—not on me— Ye spare me only, I alone am mark'd And seal'd for life: death cruelly seems to shun me, Me, who am readiest and most wish to die. Oh! I have sate me by the ghastly slain In envy of their state, and wept a prayer That I were cold like them, and safe from th' hands Of the remorseless conqueror. I have fled, And fled, and fled, and still I fly the nearer To the howling ravagers—they are every where. I've clos'd mine eyes, and rush'd I know not whither, And still are swords and men and furious faces Before me, and behind me, and around me. But ah! the shrieks that come from out the dwellings Of my youth's loved companions—every where I hear some dear and most familiar voice In its despairing frantic agonies. Ah me! that I were struck with leprosy, That sinful men might loathe me, and pass on. And I might now have been by that sweet fountain Where the winds whisper through the moonlight leaves, I might have been with Javan there—Off, off— These are not thoughts for one about to die— Oh, Lord and Saviour Christ! AN OLD MAN, MIRIAM. OLD MAN. Who spake of Christ? What hath that name to do with saving here? He's here, he's here, the Lord of desolation, Begirt with vengeance! in the fire above, And fire below! in all the blazing city Behold him manifest! MIRIAM. Oh! aged man And miserable, on the verge of the grave Thus lingering to behold thy country's ruin, What know'st thou of the Christ? OLD MAN. I, I beheld him, The Man of Nazareth whom thou mean'st—I saw him, When he went labouring up the accursed hill. Heavily on his scourged and bleeding shoulders Press'd the rough cross, and from his crowned brow (Crown'd with no kingly diadem) the pale blood Was shaken off, as with a patient pity He look'd on us, the infuriate multitude. MIRIAM. Didst thou not fall and worship? OLD MAN. I had call'd The curse upon my head, my voice had cried Unto the Roman, “On us be his blood, “And on our children!”—and on us it hath been— My children and my children's children, all, The Gentile sword hath reap'd them one by one, And I, the last dry wither'd shock, await The gleaning of the slaughterer. MIRIAM. Couldst thou see The Cross, the Agony, and still hard of heart? OLD MAN. Fond child, I tell thee, ere the Cross was raised He look'd around him, even in that last anguish, With such a majesty of calm compassion, Such solemn adjuration to our souls— But yet 'twas not reproachful, only sad— As though our guilt had been the bitterest pang Of suffering. And there dwelt about him still, About his drooping head and fainting limb, A sense of power; as though he chose to die, Yet might have shaken off the load of death Without an effort. Awful breathlessness Spread round, too deep and too intense for tears. MIRIAM. Thou didst believe?— OLD MAN. Away! Men glar'd upon me As though they did detect my guilty pity; Their voices roar'd around me like a tempest, And every voice was howling, “Crucify him!”— I dared not be alone the apostate child Of Abraham— MIRIAM. Ah! thou didst not join the cry? OLD MAN. Woman, I did, and with a voice so audible Men turn'd to praise my zeal. And when the darkness, The noonday darkness, fell upon the earth, And the earth's self shook underneath my feet, I stood before the Cross, and in my pride Rejoiced that I had shaken from my soul The soft compunction. MIRIAM. Ha!—but now, oh! now, Thou own'st him for the eternal Son of God, The mock'd and scourg'd, and crown'd, and crucified. Thou dost believe the blazing evidence Of yon fierce flames! thou bow'st thyself before The solemn preacher, Desolation, That now on Zion's guilty ruins seated Bears horrible witness. OLD MAN. Maiden, I believe them, I dare not disbelieve; it is my curse, My agony, that cleaves to me in death. MIRIAM. Oh! not a curse, it is a gracious blessing— Believe, and thou shalt live! OLD MAN. Back, insolent! What! would'st thou school these grey hairs, and become Mine age's teacher? MIRIAM. Hath not God ordain'd Wisdom from babes and sucklings? OLD MAN. Back, I say; I have lived a faithful child of Abraham, And so will die. MIRIAM. For ever!—He is gone, Yet he looks round, and shakes his hoary head In dreadful execration 'gainst himself And me—I dare not follow him. What's here? It is mine home, the dwelling of my youth, O'er which the flames climb up with such fierce haste. Lo, lo! they burst from that house-top, where oft My sister and myself have sate and sung Our pleasant airs of gladness! Ah, Salone! Where art thou now? These, these are not the lights Which should be shining on a marriage-bed. Oh! that I had been called to dress thy bier, To pour sweet ointments on thy shrouded corpse, Rather than thus to weave thee bridal chaplets To be so madly worn, so early wither'd! Where art thou? I dare only wish thee dead, Even as I wish myself. 'Tis she, herself! Thank God, she hath not perish'd in the flames! 'Tis she—she's here—she's here—the unfaded crown Hanging from her loose tresses, and her raiment Only the bridal veil wrapt round her—Sister! Oh! by my mother's blessings on us both, Stay, stay and speak to me—Salone! SALONE. Thee! 'Tis all thy bitter envy, that hath made The exquisite music cease, and hath put out The gentle lamps, and with a jealous voice Hath call'd him from me. MIRIAM. Seest thou not, Salone, The city's all on fire, the foe's around us? SALONE. The fire! the foe! what's fire or foe to me? What's aught but Amariah? He is mine, The eagle-eyed, the noble and the brave, The Man of Men, the glory of our Zion, And ye have rent him from me. MIRIAM. Dearest, who? SALONE. I tell thee, he was mine, oh! mine so fondly, And I was his—I had begun to dare The telling how I loved him—and the night It was so rapturously still around us— When, even as though he heard a voice, and yet There was no sound I heard, he sprung from me Unto the chamber-door, and he look'd out Into the city— MIRIAM. Well!—Nay, let not fall Thy insufficient raiment—Merciful Heaven, Thy bosom bleeds! What rash and barbarous hand Hath— SALONE. He came back and kiss'd me, and he said— I know not what he said—but there was something Of Gentile ravisher, and his beauteous bride,— Me, me he meant, he call'd me beauteous bride,— And he stood o'er me with a sword so bright My dazzled eyes did close. And presently, Methought, he smote me with the sword, but then He fell upon my neck, and wept upon me, And I felt nothing but his burning tears. MIRIAM. She faints! Look up, sweet sister! I have staunch'd The blood awhile—but her dim wandering eyes Are fixing—she awakes—she speaks again. SALONE. Ah! brides, they say, should be retired, and dwell Within in modest secrecy; yet here Am I, a this night's bride, in the open street, My naked feet on the cold stones, the wind Blowing my raiment off—it's very cold— Oh, Amariah! let me lay my head Upon thy bosom, and so fall asleep. MIRIAM. There is no Amariah here—'tis I, Thy Miriam. SALONE. The Christian Miriam! MIRIAM. Oh! that thou too wert Christian! I could give thee A cold and scanty baptism of my tears. Oh! shrink not from me, lift not up thy head, Thy dying head, from thy loved sister's lap. SALONE. Off! set me free! the song is almost done, The bridegroom's at the door, and I must meet him, Though my knees shake and tremble. If he come, And find me sad and cold, as I am now, He will not love me as he did. MIRIAM. Too true, Thou growest cold indeed. SALONE. Night closes round, Slumber is on my soul. If Amariah Return with morning, glorious and adorn'd In spoil, as he is wont, thou'lt wake me, sister? —Ah! no, no, no! this is no waking sleep, It bursts upon me—Yes, and Simon's daughter, The bride of Amariah, may not fear, Nor shrink from dying. My half-failing spirit Comes back, my soft love-melted heart is strong: I know it all, in mercy and in love Thou'st wounded me to death—and I will bless thee, True lover! noble husband! my last breath Is thine in blessing—Amariah!—Love! And yet thou shouldst have staid to close mine eyes, Oh Amariah!—and an hour ago I was a happy bride upon thy bosom, And now am—Oh God, God! if he have err'd, And should come back again, and find me—dead! MIRIAM. Father of Mercies! she is gone an infidel, An infidel unrepentant, to thy presence, The partner of my cradle and my bed, My own, my only sister!—oh! but thou, Lord, knowest that thou hast not drawn her to thee, By making the fond passions of the heart, Like mine, thy ministers of soft persuasion. She hath not loved a Christian, hath not heard From lips, whose very lightest breath is dear, Thy words of comfort. I will cover her. Thy bridal veil is now thy shroud, my sister, And long thou wilt not be without a grave. Jerusalem will bury all her children Ere many hours are past. There's some one comes— A Gentile soldier—'tis the same who oft Hath cross'd me, and I've fled and 'scap'd him. Now, How can I fly, and whither? Will the dead Protect me? Ha! whichever way I turn, Are others fiercer and more terrible. I'll speak to him,—there's something in his mien Less hideous than the rest. MIRIAM, THE SOLDIER. MIRIAM. Oh! noble warrior, I see not that thy sword is wet with blood: And thou didst turn aside lest thou shouldst tread Upon a dying man; and e'en but now, When a bold ruffian almost seiz'd on me, Thou didst stand forth and scare him from his prey. Hast thou no voice? perhaps thou art deaf too, And I am pleading unto closed ears— —Keep from me! stand aloof! I am infected. Oh! if the devil, that haunts the souls of men, They say, with lawless and forbidden thoughts, If he possess thee, here I lift my voice— By Jesus Christ of Nazareth, I adjure The evil spirit to depart from thee. Alas! I feel thy grasp upon mine arm, And I must follow thee. Oh! thou hast surely In thine own land, in thine own native home, A wife, a child, a sister: think what 'twere To have a stranger's violent arms around her. Ha! every where are more—and this man's hand Did surely tremble; at the holy name He seemed to bow his head. I'll follow thee, Let me but kiss the body of my sister, My dead lost sister— Bless thee! and thou'lt spare me— At least thou art less savage than the rest. And He that had a Virgin mother, He Will surely listen to a virgin's prayer. There's hope and strength within my soul; lead on, I'll follow thee—Salone, oh that thou Hadst room in thy cold marriage bed for me! The Front of the Temple. SIMON. They fight around the altar, and the dead Heap the chok'd pavement. Israel tramples Israel, And Gentile Gentile, rushing where the Temple, Like to a pit of frantic gladiators, Is howling with the strife of men, that fight not For conquest, but the desperate joy of slaying. Priests, Levites, women, pass and hurry on, At least to die within the sanctuary. I only wait without—I take my stand Here in the vestibule—and though the thunders High and aloof o'er the wide arch of heaven Hold their calm march, nor deviate to their vengeance, On earth, in holy patience, Lord, I wait, Defying thy long lingering to subdue The faith of Simon. 'Twas but now I passed The corpse of Amariah, that display'd In the wild firelight all its wounds, and lay Embalm'd in honour. John of Galilee Is prisoner; I beheld him fiercely gnashing His ponderous chains. Of me they take no heed, For I disdain to tempt them to my death, And am not arm'd to slay. The light within Grows redder, broader. 'Tis a fire that burns To save or to destroy. On Sinai's top, Oh Lord! thou didst appear in flames, the mountain Burnt round about thee. Art thou here at length, And must I close mine eyes, lest they be blinded By the full conflagration of thy presence? TITUS, PLACIDUS, TERENTIUS, SOLDIERS, SIMON. TITUS. Save, save the Temple! Placidus, Terentius, Haste, bid the legions cease to slay; and quench Yon ruining fire. Who's this, that stands unmoved Mid slaughter, flame, and wreck, nor deigns to bow Before the Conqueror of Jerusalem? What art thou? SIMON. Titus, dost thou think that Rome Shall quench the fire that burns within yon Temple? Ay, when your countless and victorious cohorts, Ay, when your Cæsar's throne, your Capitol, Have fallen before it. TITUS. Madman, speak! what art thou? SIMON. The uncircumcis'd have known me heretofore, And thou may'st know hereafter. PLACIDUS. It is he— The bloody Captain of the Rebels, Simon, The Chief Assassin. Seize him, round his limbs Bind straight your heaviest chains. An unhop'd pageant For Cæsar's high ovation. We'll not slay him, Till we have made a show to the wives of Rome Of the great Hebrew Chieftain. SIMON. Knit them close, See that ye rivet well their galling links. (Holding up the chains.) And ye've no finer flax to gyve me with? TERENTIUS. Burst these, and we will forge thee stronger then. SIMON. Fool, 'tis not yet the hour. TITUS. Hark! hark! the shrieks Of those that perish in the flames. Too late I came to spare, it wraps the fabric round. Fate, Fate, I feel thou'rt mightier than Cæsar, He cannot save what thou hast doom'd! Back, Romans, Withdraw your angry cohorts, and give place To the inevitable ruin. Destiny, It is thine own, and Cæsar yields it to thee. Lead off the prisoner. SIMON. Can it be? the fire Destroys, the thunders cease. I'll not believe, And yet how dare I doubt? A moment, Romans, Is't then thy will, Almighty Lord of Israel, That this thy Temple be a heap of ashes? Is't then thy will, that I, thy chosen Captain, Put on the raiment of captivity? By Abraham, our father! by the Twelve, The Patriarch Sons of Jacob! by the Law, In thunder spoken! by the untouch'd Ark! By David, and the Anointed Race of Kings! By great Elias, and the gifted Prophets! I here demand a sign! 'Tis there—I see it. The fire that rends the Veil! We are then of thee Abandon'd—not abandon'd of ourselves. Heap woes upon us, scatter us abroad, Earth's scorn and hissing; to the race of men A loathsome proverb; spurn'd by every foot, And curs'd by every tongue; our heritage And birthright bondage; and our very brows Bearing, like Cain's, the outcast mark of hate: Israel will still be Israel, still will boast Her fallen Temple, her departed glory; And, wrapt in conscious righteousness, defy Earth's utmost hate, and answer scorn with scorn The capture of Simon was in fact attended by circumstances almost as extraordinary, and with a tendency to supernatural effect, at least as striking. The unity of the Poem prevented me from following the true history, which I venture to transcribe in my own words.—“Many days after, towards the end of October, when Titus had left the city, as some of the Roman soldiers were reposing amid the ruins of the Temple, they were surprised by the sudden apparition of a man in white raiment, and with a robe of purple, who seemed to rise from the earth in silent and imposing dignity. At first they stood awe-struck and motionless: at length they ventured to approach him; they encircled him, and demanded his name. He answered, ‘Simon, the son of Gioras; call hither your general.’ Terentius Rufus was speedily summoned, and to him the brave, though cruel, defender of Jerusalem surrendered himself. On the loss of the city, Simon had leaped down into one of the vaults, with a party of miners, hewers of stone, and iron workers. For some distance they had followed the natural windings of the cavern, and then attempted to dig their way out beyond the walls; but their provisions, however carefully husbanded, soon failed, and Simon determined on the bold measure of attempting to over-awe the Romans by his sudden and spectral appearance. News of his capture was sent to Titus; he was ordered to be set apart for the imperial triumph.” —Hist. of Jews, vol. iii. p. 67.. The Fountain of Siloe. MIRIAM, THE SOLDIER. MIRIAM. Here, here—not here—oh! any where but here— Not toward the fountain, not by this lone path. If thou wilt bear me hence, I'll kiss thy feet, I'll call down blessings, a lost virgin's blessings Upon thy head. Thou hast hurried me along, Through darkling street, and over smoking ruin, And yet there seem'd a soft solicitude, And an officious kindness in thy violence— But I've not heard thy voice. Oh, strangely cruel! And wilt thou make me sit even on this stone, Where I have sate so oft, when the calm moonlight Lay in its slumber on the slumbering fountain? Ah! where art thou, thou that wert ever with me. Oh Javan! Javan! THE SOLDIER. When was Javan call'd By Miriam, that Javan answer'd not? Forgive me all thy tears, thy agonies. I dar'd not speak to thee, lest the strong joy Should overpower thee, and thy feeble limbs Refuse to bear thee in thy flight. MIRIAM. What's here? Am I in heaven, and thou forehasted thither To welcome me? Ah, no! thy warlike garb, And the wild light, that reddens all the air, Those shrieks—and yet this could not be on earth, The sad, the desolate, the sinful earth. And thou couldst venture amid fire and death, Amid thy country's ruins to protect me, Dear Javan! JAVAN. 'Tis not now the first time, Miriam, That I have held my life a worthless sacrifice For thine. Oh! all these later days of siege I've slept in peril, and I've woke in peril. For every meeting I've defied the cross, On which the Roman, in his merciless scorn, Bound all the sons of Salem. Sweet, I boast not; But to thank rightly our Deliverer, We must know all the extent of his deliverance. MIRIAM. And I can only weep! JAVAN. Ay, thou shouldst weep, Lost Zion's daughter. MIRIAM. Ah! I thought not then Of my dead sister, and my captive father— Said they not “captive” as we passed?—I thought not Of Zion's ruin and the Temple's waste. Javan, I fear that mine are tears of joy; 'Tis sinful at such times—but thou art here, And I am on thy bosom, and I cannot Be, as I ought, entirely miserable. JAVAN. My own beloved! I dare call thee mine, For Heaven hath given thee to me—chosen out, As we two are, for solitary blessing, While the universal curse is pour'd around us On every head, 'twere cold and barren gratitude To stifle in our hearts the holy gladness. But, oh Jerusalem! thy rescued children May not, retir'd within their secret joy, Shut out the mournful sight of thy calamities. Oh, beauty of earth's cities! throned queen Of thy milk-flowing valleys! crown'd with glory! The envy of the nations! now no more A city—One by one thy palaces Sink into ashes, and the uniform smoke O'er half thy circuit hath brought back the night Which the insulting flames had made give place To their untimely terrible day. The flames That in the Temple, their last proudest conquest, Now gather all their might, and furiously, Like revellers, hold there exulting triumph. Round every pillar, over all the roof, On the wide gorgeous front, the holy depth Of the far sanctuary, every portico, And every court, at once, concentrated, As though to glorify, and not destroy, They burn, they blaze— Look, Miriam, how it stands! Look! MIRIAM. There are men around us! JAVAN. They are friends, Bound here to meet me, and behold the last Of our devoted city. Look, oh Christians! Still the Lord's house survives man's fallen dwellings, And wears its ruin with a majesty Peculiar and divine. Still, still it stands, All one wide fire, and yet no stone hath fallen. Hark—hark! The feeble cry of an expiring nation. Hark—hark! The awe-struck shout of the unboasting conqueror. Hark—hark! It breaks—it severs—it is on the earth. The smother'd fires are quench'd in their own ruins: Like a huge dome, the vast and cloudy smoke Hath cover'd all. And it is now no more, Nor ever shall be to the end of time, The Temple of Jerusalem!—Fall down, My brethren, on the dust, and worship here The mysteries of God's wrath. Even so shall perish, In its own ashes, a more glorious Temple, Yea, God's own architecture, this vast world, This fated universe—the same destroyer, The same destruction—Earth, Earth, Earth, behold! And in that judgment look upon thine own! HYMN. Even thus amid thy pride and luxury, Oh Earth! shall that last coming burst on thee, That secret coming of the Son of Man. When all the cherub-throning clouds shall shine, Irradiate with his bright advancing sign: When that Great Husbandman shall wave his fan, Sweeping, like chaff, thy wealth and pomp away: Still to the noontide of that nightless day, Shalt thou thy wonted dissolute course maintain. Along the busy mart and crowded street, The buyer and the seller still shall meet, And marriage feasts begin their jocund strain: Still to the pouring out the Cup of Woe; Till Earth, a drunkard, reeling to and fro, And mountains molten by his burning feet, And Heaven his presence own, all red with furnace heat. The hundred-gated Cities then, The Towers and Temples, nam'd of men Eternal, and the Thrones of Kings; The gilded summer Palaces, The courtly bowers of love and ease, Where still the Bird of Pleasure sings; Ask ye the destiny of them? Go gaze on fallen Jerusalem! Yea, mightier names are in the fatal roll, 'Gainst earth and heaven God's standard is unfurl'd. The skies are shrivell'd like a burning scroll, And the vast common doom ensepulchres the world. Oh! who shall then survive? Oh! who shall stand and live? When all that hath been is no more: When for the round earth hung in air, With all its constellations fair In the sky's azure canopy; When for the breathing Earth, and sparkling Sea, Is but a fiery deluge without shore, Heaving along the abyss profound and dark, A fiery deluge, and without an Ark. Lord of all power, when thou art there alone On thy eternal fiery-wheeled throne, That in its high meridian noon Needs not the perish'd sun nor moon: When thou art there in thy presiding state, Wide-sceptred Monarch o'er the realm of doom: When from the sea depths, from earth's darkest womb, The dead of all the ages round thee wait: And when the tribes of wickedness are strewn Like forest leaves in the autumn of thine ire: Faithful and True! thou still wilt save thine own! The Saints shall dwell within th' unharming fire, Each white robe spotless, blooming every palm. Even safe as we, by this still fountain's side, So shall the Church, thy bright and mystic Bride, Sit on the stormy gulf a halcyon bird of calm. Yes, mid yon angry and destroying signs, O'er us the rainbow of thy mercy shines, We hail, we bless the covenant of its beam, Almighty to avenge, Almightiest to redeem. THE MARTYR OF ANTIOCH.

Officers. Citizens. Christians. A Shepherd. Margarita, daughter of Callias. Maidens of Antioch. SCENE—Antioch in the reign of the Emperor Probus. SCENE—The Front of the Temple of Apollo, in the Daphne near Antioch. OLYBIUS, MACER, ROMANS, CITIZENS OF ANTIOCH, CALLIAS, PRIESTS. CHORUS OF YOUTHS. Lord of the golden day! That hold'st thy fiery way, Out-dazzling from the heavens each waning star; What time Aurora fair With loose dew-dropping hair, And the swift Hours have yoked thy radiant car. Thou mountest Heaven's blue steep, And the universal sleep From the wide world withdraws its misty veil; The silent cities wake, Th' encamped armies shake Their unfurl'd banners in the freshening gale. The basking earth displays Her green breast in the blaze; And all the Gods upon Olympus' head In haughty joy behold Thy trampling coursers bold Obey thy sovereign rein with stately tread. CHORUS OF MAIDENS. Lord of the speaking lyre! That with a touch of fire Strik'st music, which delays the charmed spheres; And with a soft control Dost steal away the soul, And draw from melting eyes delicious tears— Thou the dead hero's name Dost sanctify to fame, Embalm'd in rich and ever-fragrant verse; In every sunlit clime, Through all eternal time Assenting lands his deathless deeds rehearse. The lovesick damsel, laid Beneath the myrtle shade, Drinks from thy cup of song with raptured ear, And, dead to all around, Save the sweet bliss of sound, Sits heedless that her soul's beloved is near. CHORUS OF YOUTHS. Lord of the unerring bow, Whose fateful arrows go Like shafts of lightning from the quivering string: Pierced through each scaly fold, Enormous Python roll'd, While thou triumphant to the sky didst spring; And scorn and beauteous ire Steep'd with ennobling fire Thy quivering lip and all thy beardless face; Loose flew thy clustering hair, While thou the trackless air Didst walk in all thine own celestial grace. CHORUS OF MAIDENS. Lord of the holy spring, Where the Nine Sisters sing, Their dearest haunt, our Syrian Castaly: There oft the entranced maid, By the cool waters laid, Feels all her labouring bosom full of thee: The kings of earth stand near In pale religious fear; The purple Sovereign of imperial Rome In solemn awe hath heard The wild prophetic word, That spake the cloud-wrapt mystery of his doom. CHORUS OF YOUTHS. Lord of the gorgeous shrine, Where to thy form divine The snow-white line of lessening pillars leads The colossal statue of Apollo, according to Ammianus Marcellinus, was equal in size to the Olympian Jupiter, which was sixty feet high—Simulachrum in eo Olympiaci Jovis imitamenti æquiparens magnitudinem. —Am. Marc. lib. xxii. c. 13.: And all the frontispiece, And every sculptured frieze, Is rich and breathing with thy god-like deeds. Here by the lulling deep Thy mother seems to sleep On the wild margin of the floating isle; Her new-born infants, thou, And she the wood-Nymph now, Lie slumbering on her breast, and slumbering smile. Here in her pride we see The impious Niobe, Mid all her boasted race in slaughter piled, Folding in vain her vest, And cowering with fond breast Over her last, her youngest loveliest child. CHORUS OF MAIDENS. Lord of the cypress grove, That here in baffled love The soft Thessalian maid didst still pursue; Until her snowy foot In the green earth took root, And in thine arms a verdant laurel grew. And still thy tenderest beams Over our falling streams At shadowy eve delight to hover long; They to Orontes' tide In liquid music glide Through banks that blossom their sweet course along. And still in Daphne's bower Thou wanderest many an hour, Kissing the turf by her light footsteps trod; And nymphs at noontide deep Start from their dreaming sleep, And in his glory see the bright-hair'd God The spot was ennobled by fiction; and the fancy of the Syrian Poets had transported the amorous tale (of Daphne) from the banks of the Peneus to those of the Orontes. The ancient rites of Greece were imitated by the royal colony of Antioch. A stream of prophecy, which rivalled the truth and reputation of the Delphic oracle, flowed from the Castalian fountain of Daphne. —Gibbon, ch. xxiii. vol. iv. p. 111. Edit. 1838.. CHORUS OF YOUTHS AND MAIDENS. Phœbus Apollo, hear! Great Lycian king, appear, Come from thy Cynthian steep or Xanthus' shore, Here to thy Syrian home In visible godhead come, And o'er our land thy choicest influence pour. CALLIAS. Break off the hymn. And now the solemn rites Are duly paid; the hundred steers have bled; O'er all the Temple the rich incense curls In clouds of fragrance! and the golden cups In generous libation have pour'd forth The honied wine; and all along the shade Of sacred Daphne hath your pomp been led, Waking the slumbering echoes from their caves, To multiply the adoring Io Pæan To great Apollo. SECOND PRIEST. Callias! our God, That yesterday on our Elean games Shone with a splendor, even as though a veil, Which to that day had dimm'd his full divinity, Had been rent off; our God hath center'd now As 'twere the gather'd light of many moons Within his orb to honour this our festival. MACER. Nor wonder! for did ever elder Greece, When all her cities and her kings were met On the Olympic plain In the adjacent fields a stadium was built by a special privilege, which had been purchased from Elis; the Olympic games were celebrated at the expense of the city; and a revenue of thirty thousand pounds sterling was annually applied to the public pleasures. —Gibbon, ch. xxiii. vol. iv, p. 111. Edit. 1838., or where the priestess Sate, speaking fate, upon her Delphic tripod, With richer rite, or statelier ceremony, With nobler or more spotless hecatombs, Propitiate the immortal Gods? OLYBIUS. Great Rome Herself not costlier. MACER. What, then, is wanting? SECOND PRIEST. What, but the crown and palm-like grace of all, The sacred virgin, on whose footsteps Beauty Waits like a handmaid; whose most peerless form, Light as embodied air, and pure as ivory Thrice polish'd by the skilful statuary, Moves in the priestess' long and flowing robes, While our scarce-erring worship doth adore The servant rather than the God. THIRD PRIEST. The maid Whose living lyre so eloquently speaks, From the deserted grove the silent birds Hang hovering o'er her; and we human hearers Stand breathless as the marbles on the walls, That even themselves seem touch'd to listening life, All animate with the inspiring ecstasy. FIRST ROMAN. Thou mean'st the daughter of the holy Callias; I once beheld her, when the thronging people Press'd round, yet parted still to give her way, Even as the blue enamour'd waves, when first The sea-born Goddess in her rosy shell Sail'd the calm ocean. SECOND PRIEST. Margarita, come, Come in thy zoneless grace, thy flowing locks Crown'd with the laurel of the God; the lyre Accordant to thy slow and musical steps, As grateful 'twould return the harmony, That from thy touch it wins. THIRD PRIEST. Come, Margarita. This long, this bashful, timorous delay Beseems thee well, and thou wilt come the lovelier, Even like a late long-look'd for flower in spring. SECOND PRIEST. Still silent! some one of the sacred priests Enter, and in Apollo's name call forth The tardy maiden. CALLIAS. Shame upon the child, Who thus will make th' assembled lords of Antioch, And sovereign Rome's imperial Prefect, wait Her wayward pleasure. FOURTH PRIEST (returning from within). Callias! CALLIAS. Ha! what now?— FOURTH PRIEST. Callias! CALLIAS. Hath lightning smitten thee to silence? Or hath some sinister and angry sign, The bleeding statue of the god, or birds Obscene within the secret sanctuary, Appall'd thee? FOURTH PRIEST. In the holy place we sought her; Trampled in dust we found the laurel crown, The lyre unstrung cast down upon the pavement, And the dishonour'd robes of prophecy Scatter'd unseemly here and there—and— CALLIAS. What? FOURTH PRIEST. And Margarita was not there. CALLIAS. Not there! My child not there! Prefect Olybius, This is thy deed—I knew that thou didst love her, And mine old heart was proud to see thee stand Before her presence, awed; the sovereign lord Of Asia, Rome's renown'd and consular captain, Awed by my timid, blushing child; whom now His Roman soul hath nobly dared to rend From her afflicted father. OLYBIUS. Holy Callias, By Mars, my god, thou wrong'st me! CALLIAS. Oh, my lord! Tyrant, not lord! inhuman ravisher! Dissembling Tarquin!—but it is no fable That great Apollo once avenged his priest, When broke the wasting plague o'er Agamemnon, And all the myriad ships of Greece. OLYBIUS. Old man, But that thy daughter's unforgotten loveliness Hallows thy wrath— CALLIAS. By Heaven! yet I'll have justice, If I do travel to the emperor's throne. I'll raise a cry so loud, that all the palace In which great Cæsar dwells, the Capitol, And every stone within the Eternal City, Shall with my wrongs resound. Ah, fond old man! My trembling limbs have lost their only stay, And that sweet voice that utter'd all my wishes, Reading them in my secret heart within, Shall never thrill again upon mine ears! I may go wandering forth another Œdipus, But with no fond Antigone— CITIZENS. Hark! hark! A trumpet sound! a messenger from Rome. CALLIAS. From Rome! from Rome! it is thy doom, destroyer! The sunbeams have beheld thy deed of shame, And have proclaim'd it; the arraigning winds Have blown my injuries and thy disgrace Over the wide face of the listening earth; And Cæsar's arm of justice is outstretch'd To strike and punish! THE ABOVE, VOPISCUS. VOPISCUS. Great Olybius, I am the bearer of the emperor's mandate, Would I might add of wonted thanks and praise. 'Tis said that here in Antioch, the high place And chosen sanctuary of those Galileans, Who with their godless and incestuous rites Offend the thousand deities of Rome, Making them waste our mildew'd lands with dearth, Attaint our wholesome air with pestilence, And shake th' indignant earth, even till our cities, With all their unwarn'd multitudes sink down Into the sudden yawning chasms beneath them!— 'Tis said, even here Olybius hath let sleep The thunders of the law, which should have smitten With the stern frequency of angry Jove, When with fierce storms he darkens half the world! Wherefore, instead of flying in close haunts, And caves, and woods, the stern extermination, They climb our palaces, they crowd our camps, They cover all our wide and boundless realms; While the sad Priests of all our Gods do sit Round their cold altars and ungifted shrines, Waiting in vain for victim or oblation. OLYBIUS. It moves no wonder that Vopiscus comes To taunt with negligence Olybius' rule, Not ignorant that Vopiscus were well pleased If that this Eastern Prefecture should pass To abler hands, perchance his own.—To the charge. It is most true that I have sought to stay This frenzy, not with angry fire and sword, But with a lofty and contemptuous mercy, That scorn'd too much to punish. For my heart Was sick of seeing beardless youth and age Wearying the pall'd and glutted executioner; Exhausting all the subtlest arts of torture With cheerful patience: even soft maidens moving, With flower-crown'd locks, and pale but smiling cheeks, To the consuming fire as to their bridal. I saw in this wild scorn of death a grandeur Worthy a nobler cause; 'twas Roman virtue, Though not for Roman glory. But, Vopiscus, I am not one that wears a subject's duty Loose and cast off whene'er the changeful will Would clothe itself in sole authority. The edict of the Emperor is to me As the unrepealed word of fate. To death It doth devote these Christians, and to death My voice shall doom them. Not Vopiscus self, Whom I invite to share my stern tribunal, But shall confess th' obedience of Olybius. THE PEOPLE. Long live the Christians' scourge!—long live Olybius! Haste, drag them forth, the accursed of our gods. SECOND PRIEST. She comes—she is here—the beauteous Margarita. CALLIAS. My child! and thou art breathing still!—Come back Unto my desolate heart—thy father, child— These choking tears! they would not flow but now. MARGARITA. Dear father! CALLIAS. But, sweet daughter, how is this, Upon our solemn day of festival, Thus darkly clad, and on thy close-bound locks Ashes, and sackcloth on thy tender limbs! MARGARITA. I thought the rites had been o'erpass'd ere now, Or— CALLIAS. Hath the god afflicted thee, my child? MARGARITA. My God, indeed, afflicts me, father. OLYBIUS. Priests! We mourn, that we must leave th' imperfect rites, Deeply we mourn it, when bright Margarita Vouchsafes her late and much-desired presence. So then to-morrow for our Judgment Hall. Let all the fires be kindled, and bring forth The long-disused racks, and fatal engines. Their rust must be wash'd off in blood. Proclaim That every guilty worshipper of Christ Be dragg'd before us.—Ha!— MACER. What frantic cry With insolent interruption breaks upon Rome's Prefect? MANY VOICES. Lo the priestess! Lo the priestess! SECOND PRIEST. She hath fall'n down upon her knees; her hair Is scatter'd like a cloud of gold; her hands Are clasp'd across her swelling breast; her eyes Do hold a sad communion with the heavens, And her lips move, yet make no sound. THIRD PRIEST. Haste—haste— The laurel crown—the laurel of the God— She's rapt—possess'd! MARGARITA. The crown—the crown of glory— God give me grace upon my bleeding brows To wear it. SECOND PRIEST. She is distracted by our gaze— She shrinks and trembles. Lead her in, the trance Will pass anon, and her unsealed lips Pour forth the mystic numbers, that men hear, And feel the inspiring deity. OLYBIUS. On—away! THE PEOPLE. Long live the Christians' scourge!—long live Olybius! CHORUS AROUND THE TEMPLE. Phœbus Apollo hear, Great Lycian king appear, Come from thy Cynthian steep, or Xanthus' shore; Here to thy Syrian home, In visible godhead come, And o'er our land thy choicest influence pour. CHORUS AROUND OLYBIUS. Go on thy flow'r-strewn road, The champion of our god, By Phœbus' self his chosen chief confess'd; His brightest splendors bask Upon thy glowing casque, And gild the waving glories of thy crest. The Grove of Daphne.—Evening. MARGARITA. My way is through the dim licentious Daphne, And evening darkens round my stealthful steps; Yet I must pause to rest my weary limbs. Oh, thou polluted, yet most lovely grove! Hath the Almighty breathed o'er all thy bowers An everlasting spring, and paved thy walks With amaranthine flowers—are but the winds, Whose breath is gentle, suffer'd to entangle Their light wings, not unwilling prisoners, In thy thick branches, there to make sweet murmurs With the bees' hum, and melodies of birds, And all the voices of the hundred fountains, That drop translucent from the mountain's side, And lull themselves along their level course To slumber with their own soft-sliding sounds; And all for foul idolatry, or worse, To make itself a home and sanctuary? Oh, second Eden, like the first, defiled With sin The Daphnici mores were proverbial:—Syriacas legiones luxuriâ diffluentes et Daphnicis moribus. —Original Letter of Marcus Antoninus, in Hist. August.! even like thy human habitants, Thy winds and flowers and waters have forgot The gracious hand that made them, ministers Voluptuous to man's transgressions—all, Save thou, sweet nightingale! that, like myself, Pourest alone thy melancholy song To silence and to God—not undisturb'd— The velvet turf gives up a quickening sound Of coming steps:—Oh, thou that lov'st the holy, Protect me from the sinful—from myself! 'Twas what I fear'd—Olybius! OLYBIUS, MARGARITA. OLYBIUS. Margarita, I heard but now that thou hadst wander'd hither, And follow'd thee, my love. MARGARITA. My lord, mine haste Brooks no delay. OLYBIUS. What sudden speed is this? Behold the Sun, our God— MARGARITA. Not so, my lord. OLYBIUS. What! thou'rt become a tender worshipper Of yon pale crescent, that alone in heaven Breathes o'er the world her cold serenity. Trust me, my sweet, it is a barren service. MARGARITA. My lord, I do beseech you let me pass, I have nor time nor wish— OLYBIUS. Ha, Margarita! At this luxurious hour, when all is mute But the fond lover at his mistress' ear, Through the dusk grove, where every conscious tree Bears in its bark the record of fond vows And amorous service— MARGARITA. Hath the Prefect seen Aught loose in Callias' daughter, aught unholy, That he would breathe suspicion's tainting blight On the pure lily of her fame? OLYBIUS. Ungrateful! I have endured this day for thee the taunts Of thy distracted sire; but will not bear The thought, that thou art hurrying hence to hear Some favour'd lover pour into thy soul— MARGARITA. Olybius, thou dost not truly think it— I had forgot—Lord Prefect, thou art tyrannous, That thus with harsh and most untimely violence Imped'st my way. OLYBIUS. Fond maiden, know'st thou not That I am clothed with power? my word, my sign, May drag to death, whoe'er presumes to love Th' admired of great Olybius. MARGARITA (apart). My full heart! And hath it not a guilty pleasure still In being so fondly, though so sternly chided? OLYBIUS. Hear me, I say, but weep not, Margarita, Though thy bright tears might diadem the brow Of Juno, when she walks th' Olympian clouds. My pearl! my pride! thou know'st my soul is thine— Thine only! On the Parthians' fiery sands I look'd upon the blazing noontide sun, And thought how lovely thou before his shrine Wast standing with thy laurel-crowned locks. And when my high triumphal chariot toil'd Through Antioch's crowded streets, when every hand Rain'd garlands, every voice dwelt on my name, My discontented spirit panted still For thy long silent lyre. MARGARITA. Oh! let me onward, Nor hold me thus, nor speak thus fondly to me. OLYBIUS. Thou strivest still to leave me; go then, go, My soul disdains to force what it would win With the soft violence of favour'd love. But ah, to-day—to-day—what meant thine absence From the proud worship of thy God? what mean Thy wild and mournful looks, thy bursting eyes So full of tears, that weep not?—Margarita, Thou wilt not speak—farewell, then, and forgive That I have dared mistrust thee:—No, even now, Even thus I'll not believe but thou art pure, As the first dew that Dian's early foot Treads in her deepest, holiest shade.—Farewell! MARGARITA. I should have told him all, yet dared not tell him— I could not deeper wound his generous heart Than it endures already. My Redeemer, If weakly thus before the face of man I have trembled to confess thee, yet, oh Lord, Before thine angels do not thou deny me. And yet, he is not guilty yet, oh Saviour, Of Christian blood! Preserve him in thy mercy, Preserve him from that sin.—Ah, lingering still, While lives of thousands hang upon my speed, Away! The Burial Place of the Christians.—Night. FABIUS, DIODOTUS, CHARINUS, CALANTHIAS, &amp;c. FUNERAL ANTHEM. Brother, thou art gone before us, and thy saintly soul is flown Where tears are wiped from every eye, and sorrow is unknown; From the burthen of the flesh, and from care and fear released, Where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. The toilsome way thou'st travell'd o'er, and borne the heavy load, But Christ hath taught thy languid feet to reach his blest abode. Thou'rt sleeping now, like Lazarus upon his father's breast, Where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. Sin can never taint thee now, nor doubt thy faith assail, Nor thy meek trust in Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit fail. And there thou'rt sure to meet the good, whom on earth thou lovedst best, Where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. “Earth to earth,” and “dust to dust,” the solemn priest hath said, So we lay the turf above thee now, and we seal thy narrow bed; But thy spirit, brother, soars away among the faithful blest, Where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. And when the Lord shall summon us, whom thou hast left behind, May we, untainted by the world, as sure a welcome find; May each, like thee, depart in peace, to be a glorious guest, Where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. FABIUS. So, by the side of martyr'd Babylas Babylas, bishop of Antioch, suffered martyrdom in the persecution under the emperor Decius. Chrysostom has two homilies concerning his life and death., Brother, thou slumberest; silent as yon stars, And silent as the falling dews around thee, We leave thy verdant grave. But oh! shall we, When we put off the load of mortal life, Depart like thee as in a deeper sleep, With the sweet smile of life on the closed lips, Or in an agony of mortal pain, By the pitch'd stake, or den of raging lions? THE ABOVE, MARGARITA. MARGARITA. I'm here at last before them, and ye live. FABIUS. What means the gentle Neophyte? MARGARITA. Good sir, Thou hast not heard—Hark—hark! they are behind me. FABIUS. Who, maiden, who? MARGARITA. The Prefect's ruthless soldiers; They come to drag us to their Judgment Hall. Already is the scourge prepared; the dungeons Ope their expecting gates; the outpour'd city Pants for the spectacle. FABIUS. Is it so, my child? Makes the fierce Heathen bloody preparation For slaughter—then must we for death. His zeal Doth furbish up his armoury of murder; We, ours of patience. We must gird around us Heaven's panoply of faith and constancy, And so go forth to war. MARGARITA. Alas! alas! If they should take thee—thee, upon whose lips The living fire of inspiration burns, Severing by gentle force the willing spirit From this low earth, and pluming it for heaven; That makes the conscious immortality Stir in our souls, and pant for that pure life With Christ beyond the grave. Oh, thou that teachest Our charities to flow in heaven's own light, Like some bright river in the desert sands, Round which the gladdening pilgrims sing for joy; That send'st us forth to pour sweet oil and wine Into the bleeding wounds; to take our seat By the sick couch; to shed a tender health On the pale prisoner's cheek—Oh, who shall lead The foldless sheep to life's eternal pastures When their good shepherd's gone? FABIUS. Hast thou forgot The Master of the flock? MARGARITA. Oh, no—no—no— But how shall I endure to see thy head, Thy venerable head, bow'd down to scorn? I have call'd thee father, and have fondly pray'd That mine own parent were like thee; and now I must behold thy blood flow drop by drop Beneath the knotted scourge, or hungry fires Preying upon thy shuddering flesh. FABIUS. My child, Think thou each lash that rends my bleeding skin A beauteous sign of brotherhood with Christ; That the pale fire which wastes my perishing flesh Is heaven's own lambent glory gathering round me. CHARINUS. Why now, most holy Fabius, I had look'd For joy and triumph on thy brow, to hear That we may mount the everlasting heavens In those angelic chariots, wont to wrap The Martyr's spirit. Lo! the eternal gates Lift up their heads to greet us! Shall we then Waver and pause? or shall we not go forth Through all the city to the Roman's throne Hymning our Christ, and calling on our heads The glorifying axe? CALANTHIAS. Away! I see The waving of the purple robe. The Lord Shall tread even now the wine-press in his wrath; The signs are labouring forth, the latter days Run to their dregs. He comes t' avenge his own. No more, no more, your vain and baffled songs, “Holy and True, how long?” ascend to heaven— The day of vintage, and the day of dread, The day of desolation is at hand, The day of vengeance! FABIUS. Cease, Calanthias, cease; And thou, Charinus. Oh, my brethren, God Will summon those whom he hath chosen, to sit In garments dyed with their own blood around The Lamb in Heaven; but it becomes not man To affect with haughty and aspiring violence The loftiest thrones, ambitious for his own, And not his Master's glory. Every star Is not a sun, nor every Christian soul Wrapt to a seraph. But for thee, Calanthias, Thou know'st not whether even this night shall burst The impatient vengeance of the Lord, or rest Myriads of human years. For what are they, What are our ages, but a few brief waves From the vast ocean of eternity, That break upon the shore of this our world, And so ebb back into the immense profound, Which He on high, even at one instant, sweeps With his omniscient sight. Beloved brethren, And ye, our sisters, hold we all prepared, Like him beside whose hallow'd grave we stand, To give the last and awful testimony To Christ our Lord. Yet tempt not to our murder The yet unbloody hands of men. They come: Pale lights are gleaming through the dusky night, And hurrying feet are trampling to and fro. Disperse—disperse, my brethren, to your homes!— Sweet Margarita, in the Hermitage By clear Orontes, where so oft we've met, Thou'lt find me still. God's blessing wait on all! Farewell! we meet, if not on earth, in heaven. The Front of the Temple.—Day-break. MARGARITA. Yet once again I touch thy golden strings, My silent and forgotten lyre, oh! erst The joy of Antioch, when on festal days At the proud idol's foot I sate; and all, Even as thy raptures rose and fell, bow'd down Or stood erect before the shrine. I, too, Like thee, was hallow'd to an impious service, Even till a touch from heaven waked my soul's music, And pour'd it forth in ecstasy to him Who died for men. And shalt not thou, my partner In mine unholy worship, mingle now Thy sweetness with my purer vows. Oh! fountain Of sounds delicious, shall I not unseal thee, Thou that didst flow through Daphne's flowery grove, Timing the dancing steps of youths and maids? Dwell not within thy secret wreathed shell Sounds full of chaste and holy melancholy, As ever mourn'd in angels' moonlight chants O'er the night-visited graves of buried saints— Even sounds accordant to the weary steps Of him, that, loaded with the ponderous cross, Toil'd up the steep of Calvary? CALLIAS, MARGARITA. CALLIAS. My child, My own, my loved, my beauteous child! once more Thou art thyself; thy snowy hands are trembling On thy loved lyre, and doubtless thou art hailing Our God, who from his golden eastern chamber Begins to dawn. I have commanded all The ministering priests and sacred virgins Their robes and verdant chaplets to prepare. Thou too shalt come, with all thy richest songs To hymn the triumph of our God around The pile whereon these frantic Galileans Writhe and expire. MARGARITA. My father! CALLIAS. What is this? Wilt thou not go? MARGARITA. Alas! I shall be there Too surely. CALLIAS. Ay, and when thy ivory brows Are dimly shaded by the laurel crown; And when thy snowy robes in folds of light Enwrap thee, like the glittering ocean foam In which the sea nymph bowers her gliding form; The God shall make thy breast his shrine, and pour Such all-enchanting harmony around thee, Men's senses, spell-bound by their captive hearing, Shall own the manifest godhead, and bow down In worship. MARGARITA. Ah, that thou and all might know The God that hath possess'd me—would adore The eternal words of light and life and truth That I could utter! CALLIAS. Oh my child! my pride! While the infected daughters of the land Fall off to this new faith; while they are led To expiate in the fire their sinful deeds, How shall I gaze on thee, through Daphne gliding Amid thy white-robed choir of sacred maids, Like the presiding swan on smooth Cayster, And bless Apollo, that hath stamp'd thy soul His own. MARGARITA (apart). Ah me! and how t' unbarb the dart, Which I must strike into his inmost soul! CALLIAS. Thrice-dearest of our god! MARGARITA. Beloved father! Those tender maids led forth to sacrifice, To bear upon their blushing, delicate limbs Rude stripes and shameful insults, have they not Fond parents, loving as thyself, whose hearts Weep blood, more fast than even their flowing wounds? Oh think on her, thy Margarita, her— The breathing image thou hast often call'd her Of thy youth's bride—exposed to pain, to death! To worse—to nameless shame! CALLIAS. When Margarita Hath from her God revolted, I'll endure Even that, or more. MARGARITA. No, father, no, thou couldst not, Thou wilt not, when she meets her Christian brethren, Patient to bear their Master's mournful lot Of suffering and of death— CALLIAS. How? what? mine ears Ring with a wild confusion of strange sounds That have no meaning. Thou'rt not wont to mock Thine aged father, but I think that now Thou dost, my child. MARGARITA. By Jesus Christ—by him In whom my soul hath hope of immortality, Father! I mock not. CALLIAS. Lightnings blast—not thee, But those that by their subtle incantations Have wrought upon thy innocent soul. Look there!— MARGARITA. Father, I'll follow thee where'er thou wilt: Thou dost not mean this cruel violence With which thou dragg'st me on. CALLIAS. Dost not behold him, Thy God! thy father's God! the God of Antioch! And feel'st thou not the cold and silent awe, That emanates from his immortal presence O'er all the breathless temple? Dar'st thou see The terrible brightness of the wrath that burns On his arch'd brow? Lo, how the indignation Swells in each strong dilated limb! his stature Grows loftier; and the roof, the quaking pavement, The shadowy pillars, all the temple feels The offended God!—I dare not look again, Dar'st thou? MARGARITA. I see a silent shape of stone, In which the majesty of human passion Is to the life express'd. A noble image, But wrought by mortal hands, upon a model As mortal as themselves. CALLIAS. Ha! look again, then, There in the East. Mark how the purple clouds Throng to pavilion him: the officious winds Pant forth to purify his azure path From night's dun vapours and fast-scattering mists. The glad earth wakes in adoration; all The voices of all animate things lift up Tumultuous orisons; the spacious world Lives but in him, that is its life. But he, Disdainful of the universal homage, Holds his calm way, and vindicates for his own Th' illimitable heavens, in solitude Of peerless glory unapproachable. What means thy proud undazzled look, to adore Or mock, ungracious? MARGARITA. On yon burning orb I gaze, and say,—Thou mightiest work of him That launch'd thee forth, a golden-crowned bridegroom, To hang thy everlasting nuptial lamp In the exulting heavens. In thee the light, Creation's eldest born, was tabernacled. To thee was given to quicken slumbering nature, And lead the seasons' slow vicissitude Over the fertile breast of mother earth; Till men began to stoop their grovelling prayers From the Almighty Sire of all to thee. And I will add,—Thou universal emblem, Hung in the forehead of the all-seen heavens, Of him, that with the light of righteousness Dawn'd on our latter days; the visitant dayspring Of the benighted world. Enduring splendor! Giant refresh'd! that evermore renew'st Thy flaming strength; nor ever shalt thou cease, With time coeval, even till Time itself Hath perish'd in eternity. Then thou Shalt own, from thy apparent deity Debased, thy mortal nature, from the sky Withering before the all-enlightening Lamb, Whose radiant throne shall quench all other fires. CALLIAS. And yet she stands unblasted! In thy mercy Thou dost remember all my faithful vows, Hyperion! and suspend the fiery shaft That quivers on thy string. Ah, not on her, This innocent, wreak thy fury! I will search, And thou wilt lend me light, although they shroud In deepest Orcus. I will pluck them forth, And set them up a mark for all thy wrath; Those that beguiled to this unholy madness My pure and blameless child. Shine forth, shine forth, Apollo, and we'll have our full revenge! [He departs. MARGARITA (alone). 'Tis over now—and oh, I bless thee, Lord, For making me thus desolate below; For severing one by one the ties that bind me To this cold world, for whither can earth's outcasts Fly but to heaven? Yet is no way but this, None but to steep my father's lingering days In bitterness? Thou knowest, gracious Lord Of mercy, how he loves me, how he loved me From the first moment that my eyes were open'd Upon the light of day and him. At least, If thou must smite him, smite him in thy mercy. He loves me as the life-blood of his heart, His love surpasses every love but thine. HYMN. For thou didst die for me, oh Son of God! By thee the throbbing flesh of man was worn; Thy naked feet the thorns of sorrow trod, And tempests beat thy houseless head forlorn. Thou, that were wont to stand Alone, on God's right hand, Before the Ages were, the Eternal, eldest born. Thy birthright in the world was pain and grief, Thy love's return ingratitude and hate; The limbs thou healedst brought thee no relief, The eyes thou openedst calmly view'd thy fate: Thou, that wert wont to dwell In peace, tongue cannot tell Nor heart conceive the bliss of thy celestial state. They dragg'd thee to the Roman's solemn Hall, Where the proud Judge in purple splendor sate; Thou stoodst a meek and patient criminal, Thy doom of death from human lips to wait; Whose throne shall be the world In final ruin hurl'd, With all mankind to hear their everlasting fate. Thou wert alone in that fierce multitude, When “Crucify him!” yell'd the general shout; No hand to guard thee mid those insults rude, Nor lip to bless in all that frantic rout; Whose lightest whisper'd word The Seraphim had heard, And adamantine arms from all the heavens broke out. They bound thy temples with the twisted thorn, Thy bruised feet went languid on with pain; The blood, from all thy flesh with scourges torn, Deepen'd thy robe of mockery's crimson grain; Whose native vesture bright Was the unapproached light, The sandal of whose foot the rapid hurricane. They smote thy cheek with many a ruthless palm, With the cold spear thy shuddering side they pierced; The draught of bitterest gall was all the balm They gave, t' enhance thy unslaked, burning thirst: Thou, at whose words of peace Did pain and anguish cease, And the long buried dead their bonds of slumber burst. Low bow'd thy head convulsed, and, droop'd in death, Thy voice sent forth a sad and wailing cry; Slow struggled from thy breast the parting breath, And every limb was wrung with agony. That head, whose veilless blaze Fill'd angels with amaze, When at that voice sprang forth the rolling suns on high. And thou wert laid within the narrow tomb, Thy clay-cold limbs with shrouding grave-clothes bound; The sealed stone confirm'd thy mortal doom, Lone watchmen walk'd thy desert burial ground, Whom heaven could not contain, Nor th' immeasurable plain Of vast Infinity inclose or circle round. For us, for us, thou didst endure the pain, And thy meek spirit bow'd itself to shame, To wash our souls from sin's infecting stain, T' avert the Father's wrathful vengeance flame: Thou, that couldst nothing win By saving worlds from sin, Nor aught of glory add to thy all-glorious name. The Prefect's Hall of Justice. OLYBIUS, VOPISCUS, MACER, PRIEST, ROMANS, &amp;c. CALLIAS. DIODOTUS, CHARINUS, CALANTHIAS, AND OTHER CHRISTIANS. PRIEST. The sacrifice hath pleased the immortal Gods. With willing foot the golden-horned steer Moved to the altar, and in proud delight Shook the white fillet on his brow: the blood Pour'd forth its purple stream profuse; the Aruspex Gazed on the perfect entrails; and the smoke Rose in a full unbroken cloud. Great Prefect, Thy deed is holy to our Gods. OLYBIUS. The Gods, Whose honour we espouse, espouse our cause. Hear me, ye Priests on earth, ye Gods in heaven! By Vesta, and her virgin-guarded fires; By Mars, the Sire and guardian God of Rome; By Antioch's bright Apollo; by the throne Of him whose thunder shakes the vaulted skies; And that dread oath I add, that binds th' immortals, The unblessed waters of Tartarian Styx: Last, by the avengers of despised vows, Th' inevitable serpent-hair'd Eumenides; Olybius swears, thus mounting on the throne Of justice, to exhaust heaven's wrath on all That have cast off their fathers' Gods for rites New and unholy. From my heart I blot Partial affection and the love of kindred; Even if my father's blood flow'd in their veins, I would obey the Emperor, and the Gods! VOPISCUS. So nobly said, as nobly be it done. OLYBIUS. Lead forth the prisoners! Ye of nobler birth, Diodotus, Charinus, and Calanthias, And ye, the baser and misguided multitude, Ye stand denounced before our solemn throne As guilty of that Galilean faith, Whose impious and blaspheming scorn disdains Our fathers' Gods; ye serve not in our temples; Crown not our altars; kneel not at our shrines; And in their stead, in loose and midnight feasts Ye meet, obscuring with a deeper gloom Of shame and horror night's chaste brow. DIODOTUS. Olybius! Were these foul deeds as true as they are false, We might return, that we but imitate The Gods ye worship—ye, who deify Adultery, and throne incest in the skies: Who, not content with earth's vast scope defiled, Advance the majesty of human sin Even till it fills the empyreal heavens. Ye sit Avengers of impure, unhallow'd licence. 'Tis well:—why summon then your Gods to answer, Wrest the idle thunderbolt from amorous Jove, Dispeople all Olympus,—ay, draw down The bright-hair'd Sun from his celestial height, To give accompt of that most fond pursuit Through yon dim grove of cypress. OLYBIUS. Do we wonder That Heaven rains plagues upon the guilty earth; That Pestilence is let loose, and Famine stalks O'er kingdoms, withering them to barrenness; That reeling cities shake, and the swoln seas Engulf our navies, or with sudden inroad Level our strong-wall'd ports! But, impious men, We will no longer share your doom; nor suffer Th' indiscriminate vengeance from on high To plunge mankind in wide promiscuous ruin: Impatient earth shall shake you from her bosom, Even as a city spurns the plague-struck man From her barr'd gates, lest her attainted airs Be loaded with his breath. DIODOTUS. Hath earth but now Begun to heave with fierce intestine fires, Or the hot South from his unwholesome wings Drop pestilence? Have changeless slumbers lock'd Th' untempested and stagnant seas, and now Awake they first to whelm your fleets and shores? But be it so, that angry nature rages More frequent in her fierce distemperature. Upon yourselves, ye unbelieving Heathen, The crime recoils. The Lord of Hosts hath walked This world of man; the One Almighty sent His everlasting Son to wear the flesh, And glorify this mortal human shape. And the blind eyes unclosed to see the Lord; And the dumb tongues brake out in songs of praise; And the deep grave cast forth its wondering dead; And shuddering devils murmur'd sullen homage: Yet him, the meek, the merciful, the just, Upon the Cross his rebel people hung, And mock'd his dying anguish. Since that hour, Like flames of fire his messengers have pass'd O'er the wide world, proclaiming him that died Risen from the grave, and in omnipotence Array'd on high; and as your lictors wait Upon your earthly pomp, portentous signs And miracles have strew'd the way before them. But still the princes of the earth take counsel Against the Eternal. Still the Heathen rage In drunken fury. Therefore hath the earth Espoused its Maker's cause; the heavens are full Of red denouncing fires; the elements Take up the eternal quarrel, and arise To battle on God's side. The universe, With one wide voice of indignation, heard In every plague and desolating storm, Proclaims her deep abhorrence at your sins. OLYBIUS. Diodotus, thou once didst share our love; I knew thee as a soldier, valiant; wise, I thought thee; therefore once again I stoop To parley with thy madness. Noble warrior, Wouldst thou that Rome, whose Gods have raised her up To empire, boundless as the ocean-girt And sun-enlighten'd earth; that by the side Of her victorious chariot still have toil'd, While there were hosts t' enslave or realms to conquer; That have attended on her ranging eagles Till the winds fail'd them in their trackless flight;— Wouldst thou that, now upon her powers meridian, Ungrateful she should spurn the exhausted aid Of her old guardian Deities, and disclaim Her ancient worship This was the argument, which was urged again and again, during the long period of the simultaneous decay of the Roman greatness, and the progress of Christianity. It was uttered, as it were, by the dying voice of Paganism in the celebrated oration of Symmachus; to which St. Ambrose and the poet Prudentius replied. St. Augustine's great work, the City of God, was designed as a full and conclusive decision of this solemn question.? Did not willing Jove His delegated sceptre o'er the world Grant to our fathers? Did not arm'd Gradivus His Thracian coursers urge before our van, Strawing our foes, as the wild hurricane The summer corn? Where shone the arms of Rome, That our great sire Quirinus look'd not down Propitious from his high Olympian seat? And shall we now forsake their hallow'd fanes, Rich with our fathers' piety: refuse The solemn hecatomb; dismiss the flamen From his proud office; rend the purple robe Pontifical, and leave each sumptuous shrine A nestling place for foul unhallow'd birds? DIODOTUS. Olybius, thou wrong'st our Roman glory. No fabled Thunderer, nor the fiery car Of Mavors, nor long-buried Romulus, Set up great Rome to awe the subject world: It was her children's valour, that dared all things, And what it dared, accomplish'd. Rome herself, Th' Almighty willing her imperial sway, Was her own fortune, fate, and guardian deity. She built the all-shadowing fabric of her empire On the strong pillars of her public virtues, And reign'd because she was most fit to reign. But ours, Olybius, is no earthly kingdom, We offer not a sceptre, that proclaims Man mightier than his brethren of the dust; No crown that with the lofty head that wears it Must make its mouldering pillow in the grave. This earth disowns our glories: but when Rome Hath sepulchred the last of all her sons, When Desolation walks her voiceless streets, Ay, when this world, and all its lords and slaves, Are swept into the ghastly gulf of ruin; High in immortal grandeur, like the stars, But brighter and more lasting, shall our souls Sit in their empyrean thrones, endiadem'd With amaranthine light. Such gifts our God Hath promised to his faithful. OLYBIUS. Bounteous God! That, as an earnest of your glory, leaves you For every spurning foot to trample on, To feed unstruggling the fierce beast of rapine, To stand with open and untented wounds Beneath the scorching sun! Where sleep the bolts Of your Almighty, when we hale you forth To glut the fire, or make a spectacle Of your dread sufferings to the applauding people? DIODOTUS. Our God and Saviour gives us what we pray for; On earth a portion of his bitter cup To purify the world from our gross souls, And disencumber us for heaven. CHARINUS. Diodotus! Why stand'st thou thus, and dalliest with this man? Hear me, I say, proud Pilate! on thy throne Of judgment we defy thee,—loose thy hell-hounds! OLYBIUS. I'll hear no more—Away with them!—we'll glut Their mad desires with suffering! Ha, what's here? THE ABOVE, SHEPHERD, GUARDS, &amp;c., WITH A VEILED MAIDEN. OLYBIUS. Why drag ye forth that maid, who by her fillet And flowing robes should seem a virgin, chosen For Phœbus' service? SHEPHERD. Hear us, great Olybius. There is a cave beside Orontes' stream Roof'd with the dropping crystal, and the ivy And woodbine trail their tendrils o'er its porch As to conceal its secret chamber. There, 'Tis said, the Naiads, after cool disport In the fresh waters, carelessly recline Their dripping limbs upon the fragrant moss; And when the light winds lift the verdant veil, Some have beheld the unearthly loveliness That slept within; and some have heard at noon Bewitching sounds, that made the sultry air Delicious. We, with venturous foot profane, At that nymph-hallow'd hour had wander'd thither, When, horror struck, we heard two murmuring voices; One of a man, and of a maiden one, Pouring upon the still and shudd'ring air Their hymn to Christ—we seized and bore them hither. OLYBIUS. Ha! rend they then the dedicated maids Even from our altars?—Haste, withdraw the veil In which her guilty face is shrouded close— —Their magic mocks my sight—I seem to see What cannot be before me—Margarita! Answer, if thou art she. CALLIAS. Great Judge! great Prefect! It is my child—Apollo's gifted priestess! Within that holy and oracular cave Her spirit quaffs th' absorbing inspiration. Lo, with what cold and wandering gaze she looks On me, her sire—it chokes her voice—these men, These wicked, false, blaspheming men, have leagued To swear away her life. OLYBIUS. Callias, stand back. Speak, virgin: wherefore wert thou there? with whom? CALLIAS. Seal, Phœbus, seal her lips in mercy. OLYBIUS. Peace! MARGARITA. I went to meet the minister of Christ, And pray— OLYBIUS. Now where is he? by all the Gods I'll rend asunder his white youthful limbs; I'll set his head, with all its golden locks, Upon the city gate, for each that passes To shed his loathsome contumely upon it— I'll—Now by heaven, she smiles!—Apostate!—still I cannot hate her. (Apart.) Priestess of Apollo, Advance, and lend thy private ear. Fond maid, Is't for some lov'd and favour'd youth thou'rt changed? Renounce thy frantic faith, and live for him; For him, and not for me. MARGARITA. Oh, generous Prefect! I do beseech thee, for thy soul's sake, shed not The innocent blood; for him that I have loved— Behold him here. GUARDS, WITH FABIUS. GUARD. The second criminal! FABIUS. Thou'rt here before me, daughter;—may thy path To heaven precede me thus. MARGARITA. Amen! Amen! OLYBIUS. He!—he! that man with thin and hoary hair, Bow'd down, and feebly borne on tottering limbs! Ye Gods—ye Gods, I thank you! CALLIAS. Wizard! Sorcerer! What hast thou done to witch my child from me? What potent herbs dug at the full of the moon, What foul Thessalian charms dost bear about thee? Hast thou made league with Hecate, or wrung From the unwilling dead the accursed secret That gives thee power o'er human souls? FABIUS. Thou'st err'd Into a truth: the dead hath risen, and walk'd The unconscious earth; and what he taught, I teach. CALLIAS. Away with him!—he doth confess—away! OLYBIUS. Off with him to the torturers! FABIUS. Hear me, Prefect; Hear me, I charge thee by the eternal God, Him whom thou know'st not, yet whose name o'erawes thee; Nor think ye that I speak to sue for mercy Upon these children or myself: expend Your subtlest tortures, nought can ye inflict But what we are proud to suffer. For yourselves I speak, in mercy to your forfeit souls. God—at whose word the vast creation sprang, Exulting in its light and harmony, From the blank silence of the void abyss; At whose command at once the unpeopled world Brake out in life, and man, the lord of all, Walk'd that pure Paradise, from which his sin Expell'd him—God, that to the elder world Spake with the avenging voice of rolling waters, When the wide deluge swept from all the earth The giant-born—He that in thunder-peals Held dreadful converse with his chosen people; And made the portent-teeming elements, And the rapt souls of Prophets, to proclaim His will almighty—in our latter days That God hath spoken by his Son. He came, From the dark ages of the infant world Foretold,—the Prophets' everlasting Burthen. The Virgin bare the Son, the angelic hosts Burst out in song—the Father from his clouds Declared him. To his miracles of might Consenting, Nature own'd her Lord. His power, His sorrows, all his glory, all his shame, His cross, his death, his broken tomb bare witness, And the bright clouds that wrapt him to the Sire Ascending. And again he comes, again, But not as then, not clad in mortal flesh, To live the life, or die the death of man: Girt with his own omnipotence, his throne The wreck of worlds; the glory of his presence Lighting infinity: He comes to assume Th' eternal Judgment Seat. Then thou and I, Olybius, and thy armed satellites, And these my meek and lowly followers; Thou, that art there enthroned in purple robes, The thrice-triumphant Lord of all our Asia, And I, a nameless, weak, unknown old man, That stand a helpless criminal before thee, Shall meet once more. The earth shall cast us up, The winds shall waft our thin and scatter'd ashes, The ocean yield us up our drowned bones; There shall we meet before the cloudy throne— Before the face of him, whose awful brightness Shall be the sun of that dread day, in which The thousand thousands of the angelic hosts, And all the souls of all mankind shall bask, Waiting their doom eternal. Thou and I Shall there give in the accompt of this day's process, And Christ shall render each his due reward. Now, sir, your sentence. MARGARITA. Merciful Jesus! melt His spirit in its hardness. MACER. By our Gods, The very soldiers lean their pallid cheeks Upon their spears; and at his every pause The panting of their long suppressed breath Is audible. VOPISCUS. Methinks the stern Olybius Is lost in mute admiring meditation. OLYBIUS. There needed not your taunt, sir, to awake Olybius to his duty. CHARINUS. They demur, And will defraud us of our glorious crowns. Must we not scoff them back into their rage? What, Heathens, shake ye at an old man's voice? What will ye when the archangel trumpet thrills Upon your souls? FABIUS. Charinus, if thou lov'st Thy soul, be silent—pride must fall: the boastful Denied his Lord, and thou— CHARINUS. I?— OLYBIUS. Drag them forth, Some to the dungeons, to the torturers some, As we give order;—and to-morrow morn, Whoe'er adores not at Apollo's shrine In Daphne, him the headsman's gleaming steel, Or the fierce lions, or the flaming pile, Shall cut away, as a corrupted branch From flourishing Antioch.—Off with them, I say! CHRISTIANS. Hallelujah! Lord our God! Now our earthly path is trod; Pass'd are now our cares and fears, And we quit this vale of tears. Hallelujah! King of Kings! Now our spirits spread their wings, To the mansions of the blest, To thy everlasting rest. Hallelujah! Lord of Lords Be our last and dying words, Glory to our God above, To our slaughterers peace and love. The Prison. MARGARITA. I'm safe at last: the wild and furious cries That drove me on are dying into silence. These cold and damp and gloomy prison walls Are my protection. And few hours ago My presence would have made an holiday In Antioch. As I've moved along the streets, I've heard the mother chide her sportive child For breaking the admiring stillness round me. There was no work so precious or so dear But they deserted it to gaze on me. And now they bay'd at me, like angry dogs: And every brow was wrinkled, every hand Clench'd in fierce menace: from their robes they shook The dust upon me, even more loathsome scorn Was cast upon my path. And can it be, Oh Christ! that I, whose tainted hands so late Served at the idol's altar; on whose lips And lyre still ring the idol's votive hymns, Am chosen to bear thy cross, and wear on high The martyr's robes enwoven of golden light? CALLIAS, MARGARITA. MARGARITA. Alas! my father! CALLIAS. Oh my child! my child! Once more I find thee. Even the savage men, That stand with rods and axes round the gate, Had reverence for grey hairs: they let me pass, And with rude pity bless'd me—Thou alone Art cold and tearless in thy father's sorrows. MARGARITA. Oh say not so! CALLIAS. And wilt thou touch me, then, Polluted, as thy jealous sect proclaims, By idols? Oh, ye unrelenting Gods! More unrelenting daughter, not content To make me wretched by depriving me Of my soul's treasure, do ye envy me The miserable solace of her tears Mingling with mine? She quits the world, and me, Rejoicing— MARGARITA. No! CALLIAS. And I, whose blameless pride Dwelt on her—even as all the lands', no more. The sculptor wrought his Goddess by her form, Her likeness was the stamp of its divinity. And when I walk'd in Antioch, all men hail'd The father of the beauteous Margarita, And now they'll fret me with their cold compassion Upon the childless, desolate— MARGARITA. My father, I could have better borne thy wrath, thy curse. CALLIAS. Alas! I am too wretched to feel wrath: There is no violence in a broken spirit. Well, I've not long to live: it matters not Whether the old man go henceforth alone. And if his limbs should fail him, he may seize On some cold pillar, or some lintel post, For that support which human hands refuse him; Or he must hire some slave, with face and voice Dissonant and strange; or— MARGARITA. Gracious Lord, have mercy! For what to this to-morrow's scourge or stake? CALLIAS. And he must sit the livelong day alone In silence, in the Temple Porch. No lyre, Or one by harsh and jarring fingers touch'd, For that which all around distill'd a calm More sweet than slumber. Unfamiliar hands Must strew his pillow, and his weary eyes By unfamiliar hands be closed at length For their long sleep. MARGARITA. Alas! alas! my father, Why do they rend me from thee, for what crime? I am a Christian: will a Christian's hands With tardier zeal perform a daughter's duty? A Christian's heart with colder fondness tend An aged father? What forbids me still To lead thy feeble steps, where the warm sun Quickens thy chill and languid blood; or where Some shadow soothes the noontide's burning heat; To watch thy wants, to steal about thy chamber With foot so light, as to invite the sleep To shed its balm upon thy lids? Dear sir, Our faith commands us even to love our foes— Can it forbid to love a father? CALLIAS. Prove it, And for thy father's love forswear this faith. MARGARITA. Forswear it? CALLIAS. Or dissemble; any thing But die and leave me. MARGARITA. Who disown their Lord On earth, will he disown in heaven. CALLIAS. Hard heart! Credulous of all but thy fond father's sorrows, Thou wilt believe each wild and monstrous tale Of this fond faith. MARGARITA. I dare not disbelieve What the dark grave hath cast the buried forth To utter: to whose visible form on earth After the cross, expiring men have written Their witness in their blood. CALLIAS. Whence learnt thou this? Tell me, my child; for sorrow's weariness Is now so heavy on me, I can listen Nor rave. Come, sit we down on this coarse straw, Thy only couch—thine, that wert wont to lie On the soft plumage of the swan, that shamed not Thy spotless limbs—Come. MARGARITA. Dost thou not remember When Decius was the Emperor, how he came To Antioch, and when holy Babylas Withstood his entrance to the Christian church, Frantic with wrath, he bade them drag him forth To cruel death? Serene the old man walk'd The crowded streets; at every pause the yell Of the mad people made, his voice was heard Blessing God's bounty, or imploring pardon Upon the barbarous hosts that smote him on. Then didst thou hold me up, a laughing child, To gaze on that sad spectacle. He pass'd, And look'd on me with such a gentle sorrow; The pallid patience of his brow toward me Seem'd softening to a smile of deepest love. When all around me mock'd, and howl'd, and laugh'd, God gave me grace to weep. In after time That face would on my noontide dreams return; And in the silence of the night I heard The murmur of that voice remote, and touch'd To an aerial sweetness, like soft music Over a tract of waters. My young soul Lay wrapt in wonder, how that meek old man Could suffer with such unrepining calmness; Till late I learnt the faith for which he suffer'd, And wonder'd then no more. Thou'rt weeping, too— Oh Jesus, hast thou moved his heart? CALLIAS. Away! Insatiate of thy father's misery, Wouldst have the torturers wring the few chill drops Of blood that linger in these wither'd veins? MARGARITA. I'd have thee with me in the changeless heavens, Where we should part no more; reclined together Far from the violence of this wretched world; Emparadised in bliss, to which the Elysium Dream'd by fond poets were a barren waste. CALLIAS. Would we were there, or anywhere but here, Where the cold damps are oozing from the walls, And the thick darkness presses like a weight Upon the eyelids. Daughter, when thou served'st Thy fathers' Gods, thou wert not thus: the sun Was brightest where thou wert—beneath thy feet Flowers grew. Thou sat'st like some unclouded star, Ensphered in thine own light and joy, and mad'st The world around thee beauteous; now, cold earth Must be thy couch to-night, to-morrow morn— —What means that music?—Oh, I used to love Those evening harpings once, my child! MARGARITA. I hear The maids; beneath the twilight they are thronging To Daphne, and they carol as they pass. CALLIAS. Thou canst not go. MARGARITA. Lament not that, my father. CALLIAS. Thou must breathe here the damp and stifling air. MARGARITA. Nay, listen not. CALLIAS. They call us hence.—Ah me, My gentle child, in vain wouldst thou distract My rapt attention from each well-known note, Once hallow'd to mine ear by thine own voice, Which erst made Antioch vacant, drawing after thee The thronging youth, which cluster'd all around thee Like bees around their queen, the happiest they That were the nearest. Oh, my child! my child! Thou canst not yet be blotted from their memory. And I'll go forth, and kneel at every foot, To the stern Prefect show my hoary hair, And sue for mercy on myself, not thee. MARGARITA. Go not, my father. CALLIAS. Cling not round me thus; There, there, even there repose upon the straw. Nay, let me go, or I'll—but I've no power, Thou heed'st not now my anger or my love; So, so farewell, then, and our Gods or thine, Or all that have the power to bless, be with thee! [Departs. EVENING SONGS OF THE MAIDENS. (Heard at a distance). I. Come away, with willing feet Quit the close and breathless street: Sultry court and chamber leave, Come and taste the balmy eve, Where the grass is cool and green, And the verdant laurels screen All whose timid footsteps move With the quickening stealth of love; Where Orontes' waters hold Mirrors to your locks of gold, And the sacred Daphne weaves Canopies of trembling leaves. II. Come away, the heavens above Just have light enough for love; And the crystal Hesperus Lights his dew-fed lamp for us. Come, the wider shades are falling, And the amorous birds are calling Each his wandering mate to rest In the close and downy nest. And the snowy orange flowers, And the creeping jasmine bowers, From their swinging censers cast Their richest odours, and their last. III. Come, the busy day is o'er, Flying spindle gleams no more; Wait not till the twilight gloom Darken o'er th' embroider'd loom. Leave the toilsome task undone, Leave the golden web unspun. Hark, along the humming air Home the laden bees repair; And the bright and dashing rill From the side of every hill, With a clearer, deeper sound, Cools the freshening air around. IV. Come, for though our God the Sun Now his fiery course hath run; There the western waves among Lingers not his glory long; There the couch awaits him still, Wrought by Jove-born Vulcan's skill Of the thrice-refined gold, With its wings that wide unfold, O'er the surface of the deep To waft the bright-hair'd God asleep From the Hesperian islands blest, From the rich and purple West, To where the swarthy Indians lave In the farthest Eastern wave. V. There the Morn on tiptoe stands, Holding in her rosy hands All the amber-studded reins Of the steeds with fiery manes, For the sky-borne charioteer To start upon his new career. Come, for when his glories break Every sleeping maid must wake. Brief be then our stolen hour In the fragrant Daphne's bower; Brief our twilight dance must be Underneath the cypress tree. Come away, nor more delay, Youth and maiden, come away Page 183, stanzas 4 and 5, from a beautiful fragment of Mimnermus. Poet. Min. Græci. Edit. Gaisford.

Night.—A splendid, illuminated Palace. MARGARITA. Am I brought here to die? My prison open'd Softly as to an angel's touch, and hither Was I led forth among the breathing lutes Of our blithe maidens, as to lure me on. And still where'er I move, as from the earth, Or floating in the calm embosoming air, Sweet sounds of music seem to follow me. I breathe as 'twere an atmosphere distill'd From richest flowers; and, lest the unwonted light Offend mine eyes, so late released from gloom, 'Tis soothed and cool'd in alabaster lamps. And is it thus ye would enamour me Of this sad world? Your luxuries, your pomps, Your vaulted ceilings, that with fond delay Prolong the harp's expiring sweetness; walls Where the bright paintings breathe and speak, and chambers Where all would soothe to sleep, but that to sleep Were to suspend the sense of their soft pleasures; They are wasted all on me: as though I trode The parching desert, still my spirit longs To spread its weary wings, and be at rest. Oh, vainly thus would ye enhance my loss, By gilding thus the transient life I lose! Were mine affections dead to all things earthly As to these idle flatteries of the sense, My trial were but light. There's some one comes— Is it the ruthless executioner? OLYBIUS, MARGARITA. OLYBIUS. Fairest, it is— MARGARITA. Lord Prefect, it becomes The dying Christian to be mock'd in death; But it becomes not great Olybius To play the mocker. OLYBIUS. Mock thee! I had rather Fall down and worship at thy feet. MARGARITA. My Lord, I said before, thou dost not well to heap Cold insult on the head thou tramplest on. If that mine hour is come, command thy slaves To lead me forth. OLYBIUS. I will—but they shall wear The bridal saffron; all their locks shall bloom With garlands; and their blazing nuptial torches, And hymeneal songs, prepare the way Before Love's blushing martyr. MARGARITA. Sir, go on; I can endure even this. OLYBIUS. Sweet Margarita, Give me thine hand—for once—Oh! snowy treasure, That shall be mine thus fondly clasp'd for ever. Now, Margarita, cast thine eyes below— What seest thou? MARGARITA. Here Apollo's temple rests Its weight upon its snow-white columns. There The massy shades of Daphne, with its streams, That with their babbling sounds allure the sight, Where their long dim-seen tracts of silvery whiteness Now gleam, and now are lost again. Beyond, The star-lit city in its wide repose; Each tall and silent tower in stately darkness Distinct against the cloudless sky. OLYBIUS. Beneath thee, Now, to the left? MARGARITA. A dim and narrow court I see, where shadows as of hurrying men Pass and repass; and now and then their lights Wander on shapeless heaps, like funeral piles. And there are things of strange distorted shape, On which the torches cast a colder hue, As though on iron instruments of torture. A little farther, there are moving lamps In the black amphitheatre, that glance, And, as they glance, each narrow aperture Is feebly gilded with their slanted light. It is the quick and busy preparation For the dark sacrifice of to-morrow. OLYBIUS. There, If thou canst add the scorn, and shame, and pain, The infuriate joy of the fierce multitude, The flowing blood, and limbs that writhe in flame, Thou seest what thou preparest for thyself. Now what Olybius' love prepares for thee, Fairest, behold!—This high irradiate roof Fretted with lamps; these gorgeous chambers, each As it recedes of costlier splendor, strew'd With all the barbarous Indian's loom hath wrought, Or all the enslaved ocean wafts to Tyre. Arabia's weeping groves are odourless, Her balmy wealth exhausted o'er our couches Of banquet, where the revelling Syria spreads Her fruits and wines in vases cool with snow From Libanus. Around are summer gardens Of sunny lawn and sweet secluded shade, Which waft into the gilded casement airs Loaded with dewy fragrance, and send up The coolness of their silver-dashing fountains, As Nature's self strove in fond rivalry With Art to pamper every sense. Behold Yon throne, whereon the Asiarch holds his state, Circled with kings and more than kingly Romans; There by his side shall Margarita sit, Olybius' bride; with all the adoring city, And every province of the sumptuous East, Casting its lavish homage at her feet; Her life one luxury of love, her state One scene of peerless pomp and pride; her will The law of spacious kingdoms, and her lord More glorious for the beauty of his bride Than for three triumphs. Now, my soul's beloved, Make thou thy choice. MARGARITA. 'Tis made—the funeral pyre. OLYBIUS. Dearest, what say'st thou? Wouldst thou have me woo thee So that the burning blushes should— MARGARITA. Oh! hear me, Olybius—Should we look to-morrow eve On that sad court of death, the winds that bore The groans of anguish will have died in silence; The untainted earth have drunk the blood, nor trace Remain of all those Christian multitudes, Save some small urns of dust. A few years pass'd, Could we look round where stands this spacious palace, Yon throne of gold, these high and arching roofs, Even on thine own majestic shape, Olybius, Will the distinguish'd dust of these proud chambers, Or even thine own embalmed ashes, wear The stamp and impress of their kingly lord? With the same scorn will the coarse peasant's foot Tread all beneath it. But the soul—the soul, What then will be its separate doom? What seats Of light and bliss will hold to-morrow's victims! On what dark beds shall those recline, who have shone A little longer in this cloudy sphere, And bask'd within the blaze of human glory, Ere yet the eternal night hath gather'd them In darkness!—Oh! were this world all, Olybius, With joy would I become thy cupbearer, And minister the richest wine of life, Long as thy mortal lips could quaff of bliss. But now a nobler service doth become me; I'll use thy fabling poet's phrase, and be Thy Hebe, with officious hand to reach thee The ambrosial cup of everlasting gladness. OLYBIUS. How doth the rapture of her speech enkindle The brightness of her beauty! never yet Look'd she so lovely, when her loosen'd locks Flow'd in the frantic grace of inspiration From the burst fillet down her snowy neck. MARGARITA. Roman, I know thy spirit pants for glory; There is a thirst within thine inmost soul, Which triumphs cannot satiate, nor the sway Of earth. I'll tell thee how to win a record That shall be register'd by flaming hands In the adamantine heavens. OLYBIUS. But canst thou win me An immortality of thee? MARGARITA. I can. OLYBIUS. Name then the price, be it the forfeit life Of the most hardy in yon Christian crew, 'Tis given. MARGARITA. I ask thine own eternal soul— Believe in Jesus Christ, and I am thine. —Thou smil'st on me as with a scornful pity; I may not scorn, but from my inmost soul I pity thee. These tears, these bursting tears, Flow but for thee, Olybius! Little know'st thou What sacrifice it were t' abandon now The saintly quiet of the unwedded state; Where all the undistracted spirit dwells On heaven alone; nor love, nor hope, nor duty, Nor daily thought, nor nightly dream withdrawn From him, who is the sun to that pale flower The virgin's heart. Those silent stars above us Are not so pure, so calm, so far removed From earth, as maidens dedicate to Christ; And I would quit that cloudless course on high To wander in the darkling world with thee. OLYBIUS. There was a time, I will not say thy lips, But thy full sparkling eye spake softer language; Then— MARGARITA. Oh! reproach me not my days of shame. I will not say I loved thee not, Olybius, With a most fond and earthly love. In truth, Or ere I learnt this unimpassion'd faith, Thou wert my soul's idolatry—thy form Usurp'd Apollo's pedestal, diverting All to thyself, mine incense and my vows. Thou wert mine all on earth, nor knew I aught Beyond to rival thee. Olybius, gaze not In wonder thus; learn thou this faith, and then Thy bride will bring to thee a nobler dowry Than her poor beauty. Thou wouldst bless me, then, Nor chide me as an alien to thy love. Or should a darker destiny await us, If, ere the twilight hour that gave me to thee, We were led forth to die; if funeral fires Were all our bridal lights, our bridal couch The rack, and scorn our hymeneal song, Thou wouldst turn to me in thine agony, In full and unrepining fondness turn, And bless me still, while thou hadst breath for blessing! Nay, turn not from me. OLYBIUS. Curse upon this faith, That thus hath wrung the love from thy pure soul! Curse on thy— MARGARITA. Ha! thou shalt not curse the Saviour. Alas! and there's no hope—he's lost—he's lost— So now farewell for ever, proud Olybius! Henceforth our way along this world of woe Must be far separate to our separate graves, And separate too our everlasting dwellings— Though my voice fail, I'll weep a last farewell! OLYBIUS. Now whither goest thou? MARGARITA. To my prison, sir. OLYBIUS. Ay, and thou shalt. But hast thou thought, fond maid, To what my wrath may doom thee? Will those limbs, Wont once to tremble at the zephyr's breath, That lightly disarranged thy bashful robes— Thou, that didst blush, like morning, when the eyes Of men beheld thy half-veil'd face—wilt thou Endure thy unrobed loveliness to be The public gaze? MARGARITA. Will great Olybius take Such poor revenge? OLYBIUS. By heaven! but I must leave her, Or she will tempt me to unmanly violence, Or melt within me all my Roman virtue. By all the Gods! I'll find a way to tame This wayward fawn.—So, since thou wilt, proud woman, Return to solitude and gloom, to-morrow Thou wakest to the bridal or to death! MARGARITA. He's gone—how suddenly!—and still I hoped, And surely 'twas no sin to hope so fondly, That He, who made the proud rebellious waves Of the vex'd sea in smooth obedient calmness Sink down, might yet rebuke his haughty spirit. CALLIAS, MARGARITA. CALLIAS. Queen of the East! thy father doth thee homage. The Egyptian that quaff'd off the liquid pearl, That changed her beauty's slaves but as the world Its lords, shall pass into the oblivious Lethe, And my bright daughter be henceforth the proverb Of loveliness— MARGARITA. What mean'st thou? CALLIAS. And Orontes Shall put to shame pale Cydnus, when thou sailest In gilded galley down the obsequious tide, The air all music, and the heavens all brightness; And all the shores alive with Antioch's sons, Yea, those of utmost Asia, that shall bear The thought of thee, like precious merchandize, Back to their homes, henceforward held in honor For having gazed on queenly Margarita. MARGARITA. Ah! how to check this frantic rapture? CALLIAS. She, The haughty mistress of the Palmy City, Whom great Aurelian and the arms of Rome Scarce bow'd, no more shall fill Fame's brazen trump, That shall devote alone to Margarita The fulness of its sound. MARGARITA. Why so, sir? CALLIAS. Why? Doth not Olybius, great Olybius, The Emperor's second self, the Lord of Asia, Whose triumphs gild our late degenerate days With splendor worthy elder Rome! whose form Were fittest by imperial Juno's side To walk the clouds, her chosen mate; to lacquey Whose royal state barbaric monarchs vie— Hath he not deign'd to call thee bride? MARGARITA. My father, Thou know'st the way I'm going, and canst lead me. CALLIAS. Whither, my child? Are not these chambers thine, That with their splendor load my unwonted eyes? Are not the banquet and the couch of rest Prepared? MARGARITA. They are:—the prisoner's bitter bread, And earth-strewn couch. CALLIAS. Hath he deceived me, then? MARGARITA. No; thou'st deceived thyself. CALLIAS. What! and to-morrow, No bridal pomp, no hymenean song? MARGARITA. Oh yes, my father, I shall wed to-morrow, But with no earthly bridegroom; songs there will be, But of this sinful world unheard. CALLIAS. Thou mean'st not That thou shalt die? MARGARITA. I shall begin to live To-morrow—Father, I would have thee with me, That I may say, Adieu— CALLIAS. Liars and murderers! Did they not tell me, with a flattering smoothness Of voice, like spaniels fawning at my feet, That they were leading thee to be their queen, Olybius' bride? And will they cast thee back Into the loathsome dungeon, to come forth And bow this neck, this soft and ivory neck, To the fierce headsman? MARGARITA. It was truth they spake. CALLIAS. Well, then!—Ah, now 'tis clear—'tis age hath crazed me. And made this dim confusion in my brain, And hence such strange things seem to be, and are not. Come, I'll go with thee where thou wilt; I know Old doting age should be obedient. Thou Wilt tell me what this hurrying alternation Of light and gloom, and palaces and prisons, Of nuptials and of murders, means:—in truth, I do begin to hope it is a dream. Life's dying flame, they say, like waning lamps, Casts oft unreal shadows, that perplex The parting soul—But this is certain; yet I have not lost thee, for I feel thine hand Trembling and warm in my cold palm. Go on, But hold me thus, I'll follow thee for ever. Another Chamber. OLYBIUS. Put out those dazzling lights, nor weary me With that incessant music. Cruel Fates! Have ye thus pamper'd my insatiate soul, Preventing all my wishes by fulfilment; And led me step by step unto the Capitol Of man's felicity, to laugh me there To scorn, by setting up a golden crown Of all my toils, that withers in my grasp? Th' inured to misery are inured to suffering; But he on whom Success hath ever waited, The thunder-bearing eagle of his war, In peace his busy minister of pleasure, To him the thought of one thing unpossess'd Casts back a gloomy shadow, that o'erclouds All his pass'd tract of glory and of bliss. Oh! that the barren earth had borne to me But shame and sorrow's bitter fruits. But I, That boasted in my single soul to centre The rigid virtues of old Rome, myself The nobler Scipio of a looser age, Am I thus sunk? There were in elder days Who from the bottom of their hearts have pluck'd Rooted affection, and have proudly worn Their lives, thus self-despoil'd of their best treasures— Fathers have led their gallant sons to th' axe— Oh! but to doom that neck, round which I thought Mine arms should grow, upon the block;—that face, Which oft my dreams presented me composed In loving rest upon my slumbering bosom, Convulsed!—The heavens and earth shall fall together Ere this shall be!—But how to save her—how— And must Olybius stoop to means beyond His own high will? This pale and false Vopiscus Hath from great Probus wrung his easy mandate: Him Asia owns her Prefect, if Olybius Obey not this fell edict.—I must plunge The world in civil strife, uplift the banner Of arm'd rebellion 'gainst mine Emperor, The father of my fortunes—trample down My solemn oaths sworn to th' assembled people— What then?—howl war, and to the dust my glory. Shall it be so?—Who comes?—Vopiscus! OLYBIUS, VOPISCUS, MACER, ROMANS. VOPISCUS. See, My friends, that empire's weight is no light burthen: The nightly sleep may seal the vulgar eye; The public weal denies to great Olybius That base plebeian blessing. OLYBIUS. Is the night So nearly pass'd? VOPISCUS. The purple dawn begins To tip with light the misty eastern hills. MACER. Already doth the wakeful people throng In gay and holiday attire; even now I heard the clamour of the baser sort, In merry conflict for their foremost seats In the Amphitheatre, and round the piles On which the Christians are to burn. VOPISCUS. 'Tis time, Great Prefect, that we too prepare. Olybius Were doubtless loth to check the people's zeal, That shout for death on every Christian head. OLYBIUS. When I am bow'd beneath thy rule, mine acts Shall render their accompt to thee. MACER. Olybius, Beseech thee hear me these few words apart. Whom thou wouldst save, I know, nor speak of it But in officious love—But, on thy life, I pray thee. OLYBIUS. On my life! MACER. This night I have heard Along the streets and in the noisy taverns, All Antioch, madden'd by the angry priests, Even thine own soldiers, swear to glut their eyes With the apostate maiden's blood. Shouldst thou, All loved and fear'd and honour'd as thou art, Outspread thy purple mantle over her, They'll pluck her thence, and rend her limb from limb. OLYBIUS. What! dare the rabble menace him whose wrath The royal Parthian fled? MACER. But yield thus far— Let her be led forth with the rest; to me Entrust the order that she suffer last. My life upon't she yields; the soul of woman Fears not in thought the anguish, which, if seen, Appals her back into her nature's softness; They can defy the pain they cannot gaze on. OLYBIUS. Excellent! excellent! my noblest friend, To thee I trust my more than life. Lead on; Ere one hour pass we meet before the temple. Away! VOPISCUS. 'Tis time. OLYBIUS. Thou, Macer, stay with me. To each and all, till morn hath broken, farewell! The Prison. MARGARITA. Oh Lord! thou oft hast sent thy plumed angels, And with their silent presence they have awed The Heathen's violence to a placid peace. The ravening beasts have laid their fawning heads In love upon the lap of him, whom man Had cast them for their prey: and fires have burn'd, Unharming, like the glory of a star, Round the pale brows of maidens; and the chains Have dropt, like wither'd flax, from galled limbs; And whom the infuriate people led to death, They have fallen down, and worshipp'd as a deity. But thou hast sent a kindlier boon to me, A soft prophetic peace, that soothes my soul, Like music, to an heavenly harmony. For in my slumber a bright being came, And with faint steps my father followed him, Up through the argent fields, and there we met And felt the joy of tears without the pain. What's here? the bridal vestments, and the veil Of saffron, and the garland flowers. Olybius, Dost think to tempt me now, when all my thoughts Like the soft dews of evening, are drawn up To heaven, but not to fall and taint themselves With earth again? My inmost soul last night Was wrung to think of our eternal parting; But now my voice may tremble, while I say, “God's will be done!” yet I have strength to say it. But thou, oh morn! the last that e'er shall dawn Through earthly mists on my sad eyes—Oh blue, And beautiful even here, and fragrant morn, Mother of gentle airs and blushing hues! That bearest, too, in thy fair hand the key To which the harmonious gates of Paradise Unfold;—bright opening of immortal day, That ne'er shalt know a setting, but shalt shine Round me for ever on the crystal floors Where Blessed Spirits tread. My bridal morn, In which my soul is wedded to its Lord, I may not hail thee in a mourner's garb: Mine earthly limbs shall wear their nuptial robes, And my locks bloom once more with flowers that fade. But I must haste, I hear the trumpet's voice; Acclaiming thousands answer—yet I fear not. Oh Lord! support me, and I shall not fear. But hark! the maidens are abroad, to hail Their God; we answer through our prison grates. Hark! CHORUS OF HEATHEN MAIDENS. Now glory to the God, who breaks, The monarch of the realms on high; And with his trampling chariot shakes The azure pavement of the sky. The steeds, for human eyes too bright, Before the yoke of chrysolite Pant, while he springs upon his way, The beardless youth divine, who bathes the world in day. CHORUS OF CHRISTIANS(from the prison). Now glory to the God, whose throne, Far from this world obscure and dim, Holds its eternal state alone, Beyond the flight of Seraphim: The God, whose one omnific word Yon orb of flame obedient heard, And from the abyss in fulness sprang, While all the blazing heavens with shouts of triumph rang. HEATHENS. Now glory to the God, that still Through the pale Signs his car hath roll'd, Nor aught but his imperious will E'er those rebellious steeds controll'd. Nor ever from the birth of time Ceased he from forth the Eastern clime, Heaven's loftiest steep his way to make To where his flaming wheels the Hesperian waters slake. CHRISTIANS. Now glory to the God, that laid His mandate on yon king of day; The master-call the Sun obey'd, And forced his headlong steeds to stay, To pour a long unbroken noon O'er the red vale of Ajalon: By night uncheck'd, fierce Joshua's sword A double harvest reap'd of vengeance for the Lord. HEATHENS. Now glory to the God, whose blaze The scatter'd hosts of darkness fly; The stars before his conquering rays Yield the dominion of the sky; Nor e'er doth ancient Night presume Her gloomy state to re-assume; While he the wide world rules alone, And high o'er men and Gods drives on his fire-wheel'd throne. CHRISTIANS. Now glory to the Lord, whose Cross Consenting Nature shrinking saw; Mourning the dark world's heavier loss, The conscious Sun in silent awe Withdrew into the depths of gloom; The horror of that awful doom Quench'd for three hours the noontide light, And wrapt the guilt-shak'n earth in deep untimely night. HEATHENS. Now glory to the God, that wakes With vengeance in his fiery speed, To wreak his wrath impatient breaks On every guilty godless head; Hasty he mounts his early road, And pours his brightest beams abroad: And looks down fierce with jocund light To see his fane avenged, his vindicated rite. CHRISTIANS. Now glory to the Christ, whose love Even now prepares our seats of rest, And in his golden courts above Enrolls us 'mid his chosen Blest; Even now our martyr robes of light Are weaving of heaven's purest white; And we, before thy course is done, Shall shine more bright than thou, O vainly-worshipp'd Sun! The Front of the Temple. On one hand the Prefect's Palace, on the other the Amphitheatre. MANY CITIZENS. FIRST CITIZEN. Didst e'er behold a spectacle so rich And sumptuous? How yon strong Centurion With all his band are labouring to advance Toward the temple; like to rolling rivers The people flood around them. Lords and slaves, Gown'd senators, and artisans in doublets, Mothers with infants, and old tottering men, All reverence lost for state or rank or age, Swell the vast uproar. SECOND CITIZEN. Antioch doth not hold Such multitudes; all Syria hath pour'd in, Choking the roads with tumult. THIRD CITIZEN. I beheld The Amphitheatre, its spacious circle, From the arena to the highest seat, One mass of living turbulence. FIRST CITIZEN. No wonder; For him who lingered in the city all Assail'd as they pass'd by with imprecation, And hurl'd huge stones at his devoted head, Deeming him guilty of this faith accursed. FOURTH CITIZEN. On every tree they hang like birds; the courts Around the Prefect's palace are as throng'd As here before the temple. But for that Beyond, wherein the executioners Stand with bare arms around their dreadful engines, Men struggle for the entrance as for life; He that hath won it looks back on his comrade More proud than if he had storm'd an enemy's camp. FIRST CITIZEN. How noble is this rage! Like one wild fire The zeal of vengeance for their fathers' Gods Wraps all these myriads. FOURTH CITIZEN. Ay, those stormy clouds, To which these gather'd hosts may best be liken'd, Are pregnant with the thunderbolts of heaven. FIRST CITIZEN. Thought ye all Antioch still so sound? FOURTH CITIZEN. I know not; But this I know, 'twere ill for him who wore A face of sorrow in an hour like this; 'Twere treason 'gainst the tyrant of the day— The assembled people. FIRST CITIZEN. Back! fall back! the Prefect! FOURTH CITIZEN. Hark, friends! as now the brazen clarions cease, How sweetly shrill the silver trumpets pierce The eager ear. Again that general shout From all that vast and boundless multitude! It peals up all the Amphitheatre, And every court takes up and multiplies The exulting clamour, like the thunders rolling Amid the rugged mountains. SECOND CITIZEN. Would not Jove Almost exchange his high immortal state, Where gods before his footstool bow, to win The homage round the great Olybius pour'd? FOURTH CITIZEN. 'Twere worth a life to be one hour as he is. SECOND CITIZEN. Behold the priests of all the temples bear Their gods in state to see themselves avenged: As they sweep on, the reverent crowd falls back. Lo, first the loose-hair'd Bacchanals dance on In wanton Thiasus, their cymbals catch The radiant light, that falls in glancing flakes O'er their white robes, and freshening ivy wreaths. Lo, now the beardless youths of Dyndymene! Half timorous, the yoked lions drag along The golden car, where sits the tower-crown'd Queen. Now the Egyptian timbrels ring the praise Of Isis; and, behind, Jove's flamen walks In state supreme, like his own god. SECOND CITIZEN. Fall down, Ye men of Antioch! lo, your ancient Gods! Astarte, diadem'd with her crescent moon, And him whom by the side of Lebanon The maidens yearly weep, soft Thammuz. THIRD CITIZEN. See! The high-tiara'd Magian bears his fire. FOURTH CITIZEN. Oh, proud assemblage of Divinity! Lo, all the earth's conspiring Gods in league! The ruling powers of heaven and hell are met T' exterminate this all-abhorred faith. SECOND CITIZEN. But think ye that Apollo's aged priest Will come? FIRST CITIZEN. I have been gazing toward the vestibule In anxious hope to see his reverend face. SECOND CITIZEN. What, know'st thou not how yesterday— THIRD CITIZEN. Peace, peace! He's here—Give place. THE ABOVE, CALLIAS. CALLIAS. All true, and real all: My sleep is fled, but not my hideous dreams. Ah! there they stand, their baskets full of flowers, The censers trembling in their timid hands, All, all the dedicated maids, but one. SECOND CITIZEN. Why doth he gaze around? he seems to seek What he despairs of finding. CALLIAS. No, there's none That taller than the rest draws all regards; And if they touch their lyres, they will but wake, With all their art, the memory of that voice Which is not of their choir— SECOND CITIZEN. Ah, poor old man! CALLIAS. What! who art thou that dost presume to pity The father of the peerless Margarita? I tell thee, insolent! beside the stake I shall be prouder of my single child Than if my wife had teem'd like Niobe With such as thine. THIRD CITIZEN. He hath no children, sir: CALLIAS. Would I were like him!—Ah, no—no,—my child! I know that I'm come forth to see thee die For this strange God thy father never worshipp'd; Yet all my wrath is gone, and half my sorrow, But nothing of my love. Whate'er thou dost Is sanctified by being done by thee— Thy crime hath lost its hatefulness. I pass'd By Phœbus' shrine, and, or his angry form Wore less of terror, or my soul had learn'd To scorn a God, that could not save his faithful From misery, or teach them to endure it. FOURTH CITIZEN. Heard ye?— CALLIAS. Alas! what hath the old man said. That ye lower on me with reproachful brows? Oh friends! I have been dreaming of my daughter, Dreaming in sleep, which but the soft remembrance Of her bewitching ways shed o'er mine eyes, And know not what I think, or what I say. THE MULTITUDE. Olybius! Back—back—Olybius! FIRST CITIZEN. Rend, rend the heaven with shouts, cast high your caps, And wave your garlands as the autumn wind Waves the vine-tendrils. SECOND CITIZEN. Citizens, behold him! With how serene a step he mounts the throne, As 'twere his birthright to o'erawe mankind With his superior state. FOURTH CITIZEN. How like to Neptune! That sits upon his lofty car, and rules All ocean with the shaking of his trident; The Ægean and the barbarous Pontic seas, The Tyrrhene and the stormy Adriatic, And the wide surface of the Libyan main, To where it breaks on Calpe's rock, rise up In tumult, or lie strewn in breathless peace Beneath his nod,—even thus Olybius sways The surges of yon boundless multitudes. FIRST CITIZEN. If Cæsar's self looks from his Capitol With nobler and more Jove-like brow, mankind Must shrink into the earth before him. OLYBIUS. Callias! FOURTH CITIZEN. Thou'rt beckon'd from the crowd by great Olybius. Happy old man! CALLIAS. Accursed happiness! And will he set my childless misery up To be a wider gaze?—My Lord, I'm here. OLYBIUS. Sit, Callias, here, beneath our feet. CALLIAS. 'Tis well: He from whose heart ye rend the sacrifice Should have an eminent station to behold it. OLYBIUS (apart). Forbear thy bitter speech—there's hope— CALLIAS. What hope? Alas! I'm now so sunk in misery, I know not what to hope, or what to fear. Will it offend thee should I veil my face, Lest my weak tears reprove thy sterner justice? OLYBIUS. Rack me not thus—but—peace!—Let the rites begin. MACER. The maids lift up their hymn around the temple. HYMN TO APOLLO. I. Io Pæan! as we sing Light our fragrant censers swing, And each laden basket showers All its painted store of flowers. Io Pæan! Clarian God! Come and fill thy proud abode. Io Pæan! we behold Nought but walls that flame with gold; Long retiring colonnades Crowded with the sacred maids: Io Pæan! youth divine, Opes not yét thy secret shrine? Io Pæan! 'tis not vain; Far be every foot profane! Lo, the golden tripod shakes, And the marble pavement quakes: Spare, oh spare our dazzled sight, Lo, unveil'd the Lord of Light! II. The God! the God! behold him come Down through the round and sky-like dome, In one wide flood of radiant gold O'er all the kindling statue roll'd; From his unclouded throne on high Rushes the effulgent Deity. The God! the God! in every vein The panting marble lives again: The cheeks with beauteous anger glow, And burns the high exulting brow: The motion of the irradiate hair Proclaims Latona's offspring there. III. Io Pæan! we adore thee, Phœbus, low we bow before thee. Io Pæan! Lycian king! Syria's crowding myriads sing: Io Pæan! Heaven and earth Mingle in our holy mirth. OLYBIUS. Now lead the captives forth to hear their doom— To worship at yon sumptuous shrine, or die. VOPISCUS. They come! they come! the universal yell Of execration follows them along, Deepening as it approaches, like the roar Of thunders travelling up the cloudy heavens, Till o'er our heads it bursts. OLYBIUS. What sounds are these, So melancholy, yet so full of joy, Like songs of victory round some aged chief, That in the war hath lost his only son? THE ABOVE, THE CHRISTIANS. CHRISTIAN HYMN. Oh Jesus! by the mortal pains we bear, And by the galling chains and garb of shame we wear, Sad son of Mary! are thy children known:— And by our flesh with ruthless scourges torn, By unrelenting man's insatiate hate and scorn, Crucified Sufferer! are we not thine own? Oh man of sorrows! and with grief acquainted, Along the path of woe, like thine, our feet have fainted: And anguish soon shall choke our parting breath, And soon our tortured limbs, like thine, be cold in death. Oh Jesus! by the strength thou givest still, And by our cheerful scorn of infamy and ill, Son of the Highest, are thy children known. By all the exulting joy we inly feel Beneath the lictor's rod, or headsman's biting steel, Triumphant Saviour! are we not thine own? Oh Lord of glory, to the Sire ascended, Like thine, our anguish soon shall be in rapture ended, And we shall stand thy starry host among, And round the sapphire throne swell high the Hosanna song! MACER. What, madmen! hath the scourge and torture taught No wisdom? OLYBIUS. By the Gods! look there, look there, Callias! she wears the bridal robe, and holds The sacred lyre. VOPISCUS. All Antioch waits the doom Of great Olybius! wherefore doth he pause, And bend to that old priest? MACER. He rises—Peace! OLYBIUS. Hear me once more, ye proud rebellious men, Or never hear again the voice of man. Behold the temple, where all Antioch serves! Behold the God himself, whose dreadful brow Awe-strikes the soul to speechless homage! Serve And live, or die on earth in fiery anguish, And be thrust down t' infernal Nemesis, For Hell's dark Gods t' avenge insulted Heaven. CHRISTIANS. The Lord our God is with us, and we fear not. OLYBIUS. The Lord your God—where? FABIUS. Every where—the worlds Are all his chambers; this capacious earth Is but the footstool of his throne, the heavens Hang in their folds of light t' o'ercanopy The Omnipresent. CHARINUS. Where?—in thunderclouds Of vengeance, which but wait our voice to launch them Upon thine head. OLYBIUS. We call'd you not before us To stun our ears with this unholy madness. The hour of mercy's o'er—or sacrifice Or die. CHRISTIANS. We will not sacrifice to gods Wrought by man's hands. CHARINUS. Ye laugh, but your mad laughter, Proud Heathens, shall be changed to scalding tears. OLYBIUS. Diodotus! brave soldier, wilt thou fall In this ignoble warfare? DIODOTUS. Rather call it The noblest conquest Roman ever won. OLYBIUS. Charinus! dost accept the proffer'd mercy? CHARINUS. False infidel! OLYBIUS. Enough.—Calanthias! CALANTHIAS. I thought t' have seen, even in my flesh, the Lord Come down t' avenge his own; but I shall see him, A blazing follower in his kingly train. OLYBIUS. Fabius! thine age should teach thee wisdom. FABIUS. Youth, Mine age does only make me fondly mourn, That I have but the dregs and lees of life To pour for my Redeemer. OLYBIUS. What! are all So full of frenzy? CHRISTIANS. All so full of faith. OLYBIUS. Last then to thee, fair Priestess! Art thou still Resolved with this ungodly crew to share Our vengeance, or declares that bridal dress A soft revolt, and falling off to love? MARGARITA. To love—but not of man. Oh! pardon me, Olybius, if my wedding garb afflict Thy soul with hope; I had but robes of sadness, Nor would I have my day of victory seem A day of mourning. But as the earthly bride Lingers upon the threshold of her home, And through the mist of parting tears surveys The chamber of her youth, even so have I With something of a clinging fondness look'd Upon the flowers and trees of lovely Daphne. Sweet waters, that have murmur'd to my prayers; Banks, where my hand hath cull'd sweet chaplets, once For rites unholy, since to strew the graves Of buried saints! and thou, majestic temple! That wouldst become a purer worship, thou, How oft from all thine echoing shrines hast answer'd To my soft lyre—Farewell! for heaven I quit you. But yet nor you, nor these my loved companions Once in the twilight dance and morning song, Though ye are here to hymn my death, not you Can I forsake without a bleeding spirit. OLYBIUS. She weeps! Wise Macer—such a melting nature Will ne'er endure— MARGARITA. Olybius, wilt thou scorn A criminal's blessing? God repay thy love, Forgive thy cruelty!—But thou—oh thou! That liv'st but in my life, no parting bride But in her ecstasy of sorrow clasps Her father's knees, and sobs upon his bosom, That is no more to be her place of refuge. Father! my fetter'd arms are stretch'd in vain, But haply They are merciful, and prevent A keener pang. CALLIAS. Let me approach her! OLYBIUS. Never Till she accept our mercy. Sacrifice, Nor aught of bridal joy or bridal sorrow Shall be denied thee. Beautiful! what mean'st thou? Why dost thou look to yon bright heaven? what seest, That makes thy full eyes kindle as they gaze, Undazzled, on the fiery sky?—Give place— Strike off those misplaced fetters from her limbs: The sunshine falls around her like a mantle, The robes of saffron flame like gold—Give place. MACER. Great Phœbus conquers! See, she strikes the lyre With his ecstatic fervor. CALLIAS. Peace—oh peace! And I shall hear once more before I die That voice on which I've lived these long, long years. Hark, even the winds are mute to hear her—Peace! MARGARITA. What means yon blaze on high? The empyrean sky Like the rich veil of some proud fane is rending. I see the star-paved land, Where all the angels stand, Even to the highest height in burning rows ascending. Some with their wings dispread, And bow'd the stately head, As on some mission of God's love departing, Like flames from midnight conflagration starting; Behold! the appointed messengers are they, And nearest earth they wait to waft our souls away. Higher and higher still More lofty statures fill The jasper courts of the everlasting dwelling. Cherub and Seraph pace The illimitable space, While sleep the folded plumes from their white shoulders swelling. From all the harping throng Bursts the tumultuous song, Like the unceasing sounds of cataracts pouring, Hosanna o'er Hosanna louder soaring; That faintly echoing down to earthly ears, Hath seem'd the consort sweet of the harmonious spheres. Still my rapt spirit mounts, And lo! beside the founts Of flowing light Christ's chosen Saints reclining; Distinct amid the blaze Their palm-crown'd heads they raise, Their white robes even through that o'erpowering lustre shining, Each in his place of state, Long the bright Twelve have sate, O'er the celestial Sion high uplifted; While those with deep prophetic raptures gifted, Where Life's glad river rolls its tideless streams, Enjoy the full completion of their heavenly dreams. Again—I see again The great victorious train, The Martyr Army from their toils reposing: The blood-red robes they wear Empurpling all the air, Even their immortal limbs, the signs of wounds disclosing. Oh, holy Stephen! thou Art there, and on thy brow Hast still the placid smile it wore in dying, When under the heap'd stones in anguish lying Thy clasping hands were fondly spread to heaven, And thy last accents pray'd thy foes might be forgiven. Beyond! ah, who is there With the white snowy hair? 'Tis he—'tis he, the Son of Man appearing! At the right hand of One, The darkness of whose throne That sun-eyed seraph Host behold with awe and fearing. O'er him the rainbow springs, And spreads its emerald wings, Down to the glassy sea his loftiest seat o'erarching. Hark—thunders from his throne, like steel-clad armies marching— The Christ! the Christ commands us to his home! Jesus, Redeemer, Lord, we come, we come, we come! THE MULTITUDE. Blasphemy! blasphemy! She doth profane Great Phœbus' raptures—tear her off! OLYBIUS. Ha! slaves, Would ye usurp our judgment throne? MACER. Be calm. CALLIAS. Alas! what mean ye, friends? can such a voice Offend you? Oh, my child! thou'rt forced to leave me, But not to leave me with averted eye, As though thy father's face were hateful to thee. But yet I dare not chide thee, and I will not. I do remember, when thy mother pass'd I hid my face in my cold shuddering hands, But still I gaze on thee, and gaze as though There were a joy in seeing thee even thus. OLYBIUS. Macer, thou know'st their separate doom. Lead off The victims, each to his appointed place. CHRISTIANS. Glory! Glory! Glory! the Lord Almighty liveth, The Lord Almighty doth but take the mortal life he giveth. Glory! Glory! Glory! the Lord Almighty reigneth, He who forfeits earthly life, a life celestial gaineth. CALLIAS. Why do ye hold me back!—My child! they bind me With the hard fetters of their arms—thou hear'st not. Speak! have ye children? have ye ever heard An infant voice that murmur'd to you “Father!” Ye Gods, how have ye peopled this fierce Antioch, That the fond natural love of child and parent Is made a crime. Howl, howl; ay, bloody men, Howl in your Amphitheatre with joy: Glut your insatiate hearts with human blood. —Nay, ruthless Prefect, thou'st not sent her there To perish: not to have her tender limbs Rent—torn— THE ABOVE, OFFICER. OFFICER. Great Prefect, he is dead— CALLIAS. He—he— 'Twas he, thou said'st? OFFICER. Diodotus, great Prefect. In the arena, as became a soldier, He stood with undiscolour'd cheek, while lay The crouching lion stiffening all his mane, With his white-gleaming teeth, and lashing tail, Scourging to life the slumbering wrath within him. But the calm victim looked upon the people, Piled o'er each other in the thronging seats, And utter'd these strange words—“Alas! lost souls, “There's one that, fiercer than yon brinded lion, “Is prowling round, insatiate to devour—” Nought more we heard, but one long savage howl Of the huge monster as he sprang, and then The grinding of his ravening jaws. THE ABOVE, SECOND OFFICER. CALLIAS. Another— And what hast thou to say? SECOND OFFICER. Calanthias died Beneath the scourge; his look toward the sky, As though he thought the golden clouds conceal'd Some slow avenger of his cause. OLYBIUS. What now? VOPISCUS. The voice of triumph clamours up the skies, And Phœbus' name is mingled with the shouts Of transport. CALLIAS. Can it be? THE ABOVE, THIRD OFFICER. THIRD OFFICER. Apollo triumphs! CALLIAS. Thou say'st not so—she will not sacrifice— My child, I look'd not yet for this. What's here? THE ABOVE, CHARINUS. CALLIAS. Back, thou foul wretch! I rush'd not forth to thee. CHARINUS. Foul wretch, indeed! I have forsworn my God. The blinding flames scorch'd up into mine eyes; And the false devils murmur'd all around me Soft sounds of water. OLYBIUS. Hurry him away! On to the altar! THE MULTITUDE. Io! Io Pæan! Io Triumphe! CHARINUS. Hah! they point at me, The angels from the clouds, my blissful brethren, That mount in radiance: ere they're lost in light, With sad, and solemn, and reproachful voices They call me Judas—Judas, that betray'd, That murder'd his blest master—and himself— Accurst of men—and outcast from thy fold, Oh Christ! and for my pride?—why then I'll wrap My soul in stern obduracy, and live As jocund as the careless Heathen here. No Peter's tears fill my dry eyes; no beam Of mercy on my darkening soul—On, on— And I will laugh, and in my laughter sing Io Triumphe! Io Pæan! OLYBIUS. Now Give him the knife of sacrifice. CHARINUS. Down! Down! 'Tis wet, and reeks with my Redeemer's blood. OFFICER. He's fled. OLYBIUS. Go after—drag him back. OFFICER. 'Tis vain. He cried aloud—“The devil hath wrestled with me, “And vanquish'd!”—and he plunged the sacred knife To his unhallow'd heart. OLYBIUS. Ignoble wretch! Who dared not die—yet fear'd to live. But pause— What means this deathlike stillness? not a sound Or murmur from yon countless multitudes. A pale contagious horror seems to creep Even to our presence. Men gaze mutely round, As in their neighbour's face to read the secret They dare not speak themselves. Old man! whence com'st thou? What is't? CALLIAS. I know not! I approach'd the place Of sacrifice, and my spirit shrank within me; And I came back, I know not how. OLYBIUS. Still mute! Even thus along his vast domain of silence Dark Pluto gazes, where the sullen spirits Speak only with fix'd looks, and voiceless motions— And ye are like them.—Speak to me, I charge you, Nor let mine own voice, like an evil omen, Load the hot air, unanswer'd. CALLIAS. Hark! VOPISCUS. Didst hear it? That shriek, as though some barbarous foe had scaled The city walls. OLYBIUS. Is't horror or compassion? Or both? THE ABOVE, FOURTH OFFICER. OLYBIUS. What means thy hurried look? Speak—speak! Though thy words blast like lightning. OFFICER. Mighty Prefect, The apostate Priestess Margarita— OLYBIUS. How? Where's Macer? OFFICER. By the dead. OLYBIUS. What dead? OFFICER. Remove Thy sword, which thou dost brandish at my throat, And I shall answer. OLYBIUS. Speak, and instantly, Or I will dash thee down, and trample from thee Thy hideous secret. OFFICER. It is nothing hideous— 'Tis but the enemy of our faith.—She died Nobly, in truth—but— CALLIAS. Dead! she is not dead! Thou liest! I have his oath, the Prefect's oath; I had forgot it in my fears, but now I well remember, that she should not die. Faugh! who will trust in gods and men like these? OLYBIUS. Slave! Slave! dost mock me? Better 'twere for thee That this be false, than if thou'dst found a treasure To purchase kingdoms. OFFICER. Hear me but a while. She had beheld each sad and cruel death, And if she shudder'd, 'twas as one that strives With nature's soft infirmity of pity, One look to heaven restoring all her calmness; Save when that dastard did renounce his faith, And she shed tears for him. Then led they forth Old Fabius. When a quick and sudden cry Of Callias, and a parting in the throng, Proclaim'd her father's coming. Forth she sprang, And clasped the frowning headsman's knees, and said— “Thou know'st me, when thou laid'st on thy sick bed “Christ sent me there to wipe thy burning brow. “There was an infant play'd about thy chamber, “And thy pale cheek would smile and weep at once, “Gazing upon that almost orphan'd child— “Oh! by its dear and precious memory, “I do beseech thee, slay me first and quickly; “'Tis that my father may not see my death.” CALLIAS. Oh cruel kindness! and I would have closed Thine eyes with such a fond and gentle pressure; I would have smooth'd thy beauteous limbs, and laid My head upon thy breast, and died with thee. OLYBIUS. Good father! once I thought to call thee so, How do I envy thee this her last fondness; She had no dying thought of me.—Go on. OFFICER. With that the headsman wiped from his swarth cheeks A moisture like to tears. But she, meanwhile, On the cold block composed her head, and cross'd Her hands upon her bosom, that scarce heaved, She was so tranquil; cautious, lest her garments Should play the traitors to her modest care. And as the cold wind touch'd her naked neck, And fann'd away the few unbraided hairs, Blushes o'erspread her face, and she look'd up As softly to reproach his tardiness: And some fell down upon their knees, some clasp'd Their hands, enamour'd even to adoration Of that half-smiling face and bending form. CALLIAS. But he—but he—the savage executioner— OFFICER. He trembled. CALLIAS. Ha! God's blessing on his head! And the axe slid from out his palsied hand? OFFICER. He gave it to another. CALLIAS. And— OFFICER. It fell. CALLIAS. I see it, I see it like the lightning flash—I see it, And the blood bursts—my blood!—my daughter's blood! Off—let me loose. OFFICER. Where goest thou? CALLIAS. To the Christian, To learn the faith in which my daughter died, And follow her as quickly as I may. OLYBIUS, MACER, AND THE REST. OLYBIUS. Macer! is this thy faithful service? MACER. Ah, So rapid— OLYBIUS. Not a word! Thou think'st I'll stoop To dash thee to the earth—But I'm so sick Of this accursed pomp, I will not use Its privilege of vengeance. Fatal trappings Of proud authority, that like the robe Of Nessus shine and burn into the entrails!— Supremacy! whose great prerogative Is to be blasted by superior misery! No more will I possess the fatal power Of murdering those I love. All-ruling sceptre! That wert mine instrument of bloodshed, down! Mine hand shall never grasp thee more. Vopiscus, Assume the vacant Prefect's seat, and be Curst like myself—with sway—I cannot wish thee A doom more hateful— Who comes here? OFFICER. Great Prefect! The enchantress Margarita by her death Hath wrought upon the changeful populace, That they cry loudly on the Christians' God. Embolden'd multitudes from every quarter Throng forth, and in the face of day proclaim Their lawless faith. They have ta'en up the body, And hither, as in proud ovation, bear it With clamour and with song. All Antioch crowds Applauding round them—they are here, behold them. CHRISTIAN HYMN. Sing to the Lord! let harp, and lute, and voice Up to the expanding gates of Heaven rejoice, While the bright Martyrs to their rest are borne; Sing to the Lord! their blood-stain'd course is run, And every head its diadem hath won, Rich as the purple of the summer morn; Sing the triumphant champions of their God, While burn their mounting feet along their sky-ward road. Sing to the Lord! for her in Beauty's prime Snatch'd from this wintry earth's ungenial clime, In the eternal spring of Paradise to bloom; For her the world displayed its brightest treasure, And the airs panted with the songs of pleasure. Before earth's throne she chose the lowly tomb, The vale of tears with willing footsteps trod, Bearing her Cross with thee, incarnate Son of God! Sing to the Lord! it is not shed in vain, The blood of martyrs! from its freshening rain High springs the Church like some fount-shadowing palm; The nations crowd beneath its branching shade, Of its green leaves are kingly diadems made, And wrapt within its deep embosoming calm Earth sinks to slumber like the breezeless deep, And war's tempestuous vultures fold their wings and sleep. Sing to the Lord! no more the Angels fly Far in the bosom of the stainless sky The sound of fierce licentious sacrifice. From shrined alcove, and stately pedestal, The marble Gods in cumbrous ruin fall, Headless in dust the awe of nations lies, Jove's thunder crumbles in his mouldering hand, And mute as sepulchres the hymnless temples stand. Sing to the Lord! from damp prophetic cave No more the loose-hair'd Sibyls burst and rave; Nor watch the augurs pale the wandering bird: No more on hill or in the murky wood, Mid frantic shout and dissonant music rude, In human tones are wailing victims heard; Nor fathers by the reeking altar stone Cowl their dark heads t' escape their children's dying groan. Sing to the Lord! no more the dead are laid In cold despair beneath the cypress shade, To sleep the eternal sleep, that knows no morn: There, eager still to burst death's brazen bands, The Angel of the Resurrection stands; While, on its own immortal pinions borne, Following the Breaker of the emprisoning tomb, Forth springs the exulting soul, and shakes away its gloom. Sing to the Lord! the desert rocks break out, And the throng'd cities, in one gladdening shout; The farthest shores by pilgrim step explored; Spread all your wings, ye winds, and waft around, Even to the starry cope's pale waning bound, Earth's universal homage to the Lord; Lift up thine head, imperial Capitol, Proud on thy height to see the banner'd Cross unroll. Sing to the Lord! when Time itself shall cease, And final Ruin's desolating peace Enwrap this wide and restless world of man; When the Judge rides upon the enthroning wind, And o'er all generations of mankind Eternal Justice waves its winnowing Fan; To vast Infinity's remotest space, While ages run their everlasting race, Shall all the Beatific Hosts prolong, Wide as the glory of the Lamb, the Lamb's triumphant song!

Within the cloud-pavilion of my rest, Amid the Thrones and Princedoms, that await Their hour of ministration to the Lord, I heard the summons, and I stood with wings Outspread for flight, before the Eternal Throne. And, from the unapproached depth of light Wherein the Almighty Father of the worlds Dwells, from seraphic sight by glory veil'd, Came forth the soundless mandate, which I felt Within, and sprung upon my obedient plumes. But as I sail'd my long and trackless voyage Down the deep bosom of unbounded space, The manifest bearer of Almighty wrath, I saw the Angel of each separate star Folding his wings in terror, o'er his orb Of golden fire; and shuddering till I pass'd To pour elsewhere Jehovah's cup of vengeance. And now I stand upon this world of man, My wonted resting place—But thou, oh Earth! Thou only, dost endure my fatal presence Undaunted. As of old, I hover o'er This haughty city of Chaldean Bel, That not the less pours forth her festal pomp To do unholy worship to her Gods, That are not Gods, but works of mortal hands. Behold! the Sun hath burst the Eastern gates, And all his splendor floods the tower'd walls, Upon whose wide immeasurable circuit The harnessed chariots crowd in long array. Down every stately line of pillar'd street, To each of the hundred brazen gates, young men And flower-crown'd maidens, lead the mazy dance. Here the vast Palace, whence yon airy gardens Spread round, and to the morning airs hang forth Their golden fruits and dewy opening flowers; While still the low mists creep, in lazy folds, O'er the house-tops beneath. In every court, Through every portal, throng, in servile haste, Captains and Nobles. There, before the Temple, On the far side of wide Euphrates' stream, The Priests of Bel their impious rites prepare: And cymbal clang, and glittering dulcimer, With shrill melodious salutation, hail The welcome morn, awakening all the City To the last dawn that e'er shall gladden her. Babylon! Babylon! that wak'st in pride And glory, but shalt sleep in shapeless ruin, Thus, with my broad and overshadowing wings, I do embrace thee for mine own; forbidding, Even at this instant, yon bright orient Sun, To shed his splendors on thy lofty streets. Oh, Desolation's sacred place, as now Thou'rt darken'd, shall the darkness of the dead Enwrap thee in its everlasting shade! Babylon! Babylon! upon the wreck Of that most impious tower your Fathers rear'd To scale the crystal battlements of Heaven, I set my foot, here take my gloomy rest Even till that hour be come, that comes full soon. Before the Temple. KALASSAN—THE PRIESTS. FIRST PRIEST. Didst thou behold it? SECOND PRIEST. What? FIRST PRIEST. 'Tis gone, 'tis past— And yet but now 'twas there, a cloudy darkness, That, swallowing up the rays of the orient Sun, Cast back a terrible night o'er all the City. THIRD PRIEST. Who stands aghast at this triumphant hour? I tell thee that our Dreamers have beholden Majestic visions. The besieging Mede Was cast, with all his chariots, steeds, and men, Into Euphrates' bosom. KALASSAN. Do ye marvel But now that it was dark? yon orient Sun, The Lord of Light, withdrew his dawning beams, Till he could see the glory of the world, Belshazzar, in his gilded galley riding Across Euphrates. FIRST PRIEST. Give command that all The brazen gates along the river side Stand open to receive the suppliant train. SECOND PRIEST. Hark! with the trumpet sound their strong recoil Upon their grating hinges harshly mingles. THIRD PRIEST. Lo! how the bridge is groaning with the gifts Of the great King. The camels bow their heads Beneath the bright and odorous load they bear; The proud steeds toss their flower-enwoven manes, And the cars rattle with their ponderous sound; While, silent, the slow elephants pursue Their wondering way, and bear their crowded towers, Widely reflected on the argent stream. FOURTH PRIEST. How proudly do the waters toss and foam Before the barges, that with gilded prows Set the pale spray on fire! The rowers, clad In Egypt's finest tunics, as they strike The waters with their palmy oars, awake Sweet music, as it seems, from all the tide; So exquisitely to the dashing strokes Are the sweet lutes and floating hautboys timed. FIRST PRIEST. Yon bark, in which, at times, the silken curtains Are by the courteous breezes fann'd aside, Is that in which the mother of the mightiest, Nitocris, sits. Her presence seems to awe At once, and give a pride to those who row Her queenly state— KALASSAN. Behind—'tis he!—'tis he!— Belshazzar's self—the waters crowd around, As though ambitious to reflect their Sovereign; And all the throng'd and living shores, that now To the far limits of the City, pass'd His name in one long shout, have paused to hear Our loftier homage.—Are the Seventy here? FIRST PRIEST. All. KALASSAN. Lift we, then, the solemn strain, in praise Of the great King, and all the suppliant court Will answer us in praise of mightiest Bel. SONG OF THE PRIESTS. Where are the thousand-throned kings, Beneath whose empires' spacious wings The wide earth lay in mute repose? He rose—Chaldea's King arose! And bow'd was every crowned head, And every marshall'd army fled; Before his footstool bow'd they down, The all-conquering Lord of Babylon Compare Rabshakeh's speech, II Kings, xix. 11–13. Isaiah xxxvii. 11–13.! SONG OF THE SUPPLIANTS. Where are the thousand-shrined Gods, Within whose temples' proud abodes The nations crowded to invoke? He woke, Chaldea's God awoke! And mute was every sumptuous feast, And rite, and song, and victim ceased; And every Fane was overthrown, Before the God of Babylon Compare Rabshakeh's speech, II Kings, xviii. 34, 35. Isaiah xxxvi. 19. Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?—Where are they among the gods of the countries, that have deliveréd their country out of mine hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?! PRIESTS. Ammon's crested pride lay low, And broke was Elam's horned bow; Damascus heard the ponderous fall Of old Benhadad's palace wall; The ocean redden'd with the fire From the rock-built strengths of Tyre. False was fierce Philistia's trust, Desert Moab mourns in dust. Lo! in chains our Captains bring Haughty Zion's eyeless King So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon, to Riblah, and they gave judgment upon him. And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon. —II Kings, xxv. 6, 7.. Kedar's tents are struck, her bands Scatter'd o'er her burning sands, And Egypt's Pharaoh quails before The Assyrian Lion's conquering roar. SUPPLIANTS. From his high Philistine fane, Sea-born Dagon fled amain; Moloch, he whose valley stood Deep with infants' blameless blood: Chemos, struck with pale affright, Left his foul unfinished rite. Her waning moon Astarte veil'd, When the Tyrian's sea-wall fail'd. In vain Damascus' children meet At lofty Rimmon's molten feet. And vain were Judah's prayers to him, Between the golden Cherubim; In vain the Arab in his flight, Call'd on the glittering stars of night; And vain Osiris' timbrels blew Over Egypt's maddening crew. KALASSAN. Lord of the world, and of the eternal city, That wear'st Chaldea's regal diadem Wreath'd with Assyria's, wherefore art thou here Before the Temple of all-powerful Bel? BELSHAZZAR. Chief of the Seventy chosen Priests, that serve Within the Temple of our God, thou know'st That the rebellious Mede, confederate With Ashkenaz and Elam, and the might Of Persia, hath begirt with insolent siege Our city walls, and I would know what swift And terrible vengeance is ordain'd on high For the revolted from Chaldea's sway? KALASSAN. Live thou, oh King, for ever! We are holding This day our solemn rite. Our Priests and Seers Each at his office stands throughout the Temple; And all our eight ascending towers that rise, Each above each, in heavenward range, are throng'd With those that strike the cymbal, and with voice And mystic music summon down the Gods To give us answer. BELSHAZZAR. Priests of Bel, and thou High mitred Chief, Kalassan! Lo, I bring Gifts worthy of the gods and of Belshazzar: All that the world in its vast homage casts Before our royal feet; the gold that flows In the red waters of the farthest East; The fragrant balm that weeps from glittering trees; The ivory, the thin and snowy robes Of Egypt; and the purple merchandize Of Sidon; and the skins of beasts that far In the dark forests fly the sight of man, Yet not so far but that Assyria's servants Track them, and rend away their bloody tribute; And slaves of every hue, and every age, From all the kingdoms of our rule. KALASSAN. Great King, What answer wouldst thou, which such sumptuous offerings May not compel. BELSHAZZAR. Declare ye to our Gods, Thus saith Belshazzar: wherefore am I call'd The King of Babylon, the sceptred heir Of Nabonassar's sway “Nebuchadnessar—Nabonassar—Ce nom est confondu par les Orientaux avec celui de Nabocadnassar, quoique les Grees et les Latins les distinguent.” —D'Herb lot, Bibl. Oriental., if still my sight Must be infested by rebellious arms, That hem my city round; and frantic cries Of onset, and the braying din of battle Disturb my sweet and wonted festal songs? NITOCRIS. In the God's name, and in mine own, I answer! When Nabonassar's heir shall take the sword Of Nabonassar in his valiant hand; With the inborn awe of majesty appal Into the dust Rebellion's crested front: When for the gliding bark on the smooth waters, Whose motion doth but lull his silken couch, He mounts the rushing chariot, and in arms Asserts himself the lord of human kind. SABARIS. Will he endure it? NITOCRIS. Oh, my son! my son! Must I repent me of that thrill of joy I felt, when round my couch the slaves proclaim'd I had brought forth a man into the world, A child for empire born, the cradled Lord Of nations—oh, my son!—and all the pride With which I saw thy fair and open brow Expand in beauteous haughtiness, commanding Ere thou could'st speak? And with thy growth, thy greatness Still ripen'd: like the palm amid the grove Thou stood'st, the loftiest, at once, and comeliest Of all the sons of men. And must I now Wish all my pangs upon a shapeless offspring, Or on a soft and dainty maiden wasted, That might have been, if not herself, like her Thy martial ancestress, Semiramis, Mightiest—at least the Mother of the Mighty? BELSHAZZAR. Queen of Assyria, Nabonassar's daughter! Wife of my royal father, Merodach! Greater than all, from whom myself was born! The Gods that made thee mother of Belshazzar, Have arm'd thee with a dangerous licence. Thou, Secure, may'st utter what from meaner lips Had called upon the head the indignant sword Of Justice. But to thee we deign reply. Is't not the charge of the great Gods t' uphold The splendor of the world that doth them homage? As soon would they permit the all-glorious Sun To wither from their palace vault in heaven, As this rich empire from the earth. NITOCRIS. And therefore Be as the Gods, Belshazzar, and stand forth To sweep away the desolating foe! As when the thunders scatter all abroad The lowering clouds at midnight, all the stars Look glittering through the bright pellucid sky, And in the glorious calm themselves have strew'd, Repose triumphant the great Gods. BELSHAZZAR. Oh, queen! The mother of Chaldea's royal lord Ne'er ask'd in vain. Myself this day will mount The car of battle, and along the walls Display my terrors, for Assyria's hosts To kindle into valour at my presence; And the pale rebels from their distant camp, Like hunters that have roused the sleeping lion, Snatch up their toils, and fly— NITOCRIS. Along the walls! And not along the dusty battle plain? Yet 'tis enough—the fire but sleeps within thee. And as the warhorse that hath sported long On the green meads, beholds the flash of arms Bright on the fountain where he bathes, and hears The martial trumpet sounding, start erect His kindling ears, his agitated mane Trembles; already on his back he feels The gorgeous trappings and the armed rider, And treads the sward as though he trampled down Whole hosts before him; thus Belshazzar's soul, At sight of Babylon's exulting foes, Shall waken to the warrior's noble wrath. BELSHAZZAR. Give instant order! NITOCRIS. Oh, tiara'd Mede! And thou fierce Persian that dost boast thyself As hardy as thy native mountains! Thou, The shepherd's nursling, Cyrus! feel ye not A prescient terror of your coming conqueror? The towers with which ye have girt your spacious camp, Do they not rock even to their deep foundations, In conscious awe? But thou, my noble son! Thy mother's heart, that beat but in thy presence, Even when thou laid'st in soft inglorious dalliance, When home thou com'st, high plumed with victory, hosts In chains around thee, and the routed armies Crowding to gaze upon their conqueror, As though it were a solace in their fall That great Belshazzar stoop'd to overthrow them; When all the myriads of vast Babylon Shout in the triumph of their kingly lord; That heart, my son, with such excess of pride Will swell, that it will burst. Even now it fills My woman's eyes with tears: when I should wear A brow all rapture, I can only weep. KALASSAN. Lord of the Nations! with our richest rites Do we propitiate the eternal Gods. Upon the golden altar, never wet Save with the immaculate blood of yearling lambs From Diodorus. We sacrifice—and on our topmost tower, Where, on his couch, amid his native clouds, The God reposes, must the chosen Virgin Herodotus, Clio, clxxxii., relates this usage as taking place not only in Babylon but in the temple of the Egyptian Jupiter, at Thebes, and elsewhere. But the worthy historian ventures to doubt the actual descent of the God,—???? . . . ???? ??? ?? ????? ????????., Whom to our wandering search he first presents, Await the bright descending Deity. BELSHAZZAR. What then!—the Gods hold festival to-night! And shall the courts of great Chaldea's palace Be silent of the festal song? At eve Our banquet shall begin; and dusky night, Astonish'd at our splendor, think his reign Usurp'd as by a brighter day. Kalassan! Whence are those golden vessels richly carved, And bossy with enchased fruits and flowers; Goblets, and lavers, and tall chandeliers, That, like to blossoming almond trees, branch out In knosps of glittering silver?—meet were they To minister at great Belshazzar's feast. KALASSAN. King of the Universe! those vessels stood Erst in the Temple of the Hebrew's God; But when Chaldea's arms laid waste the City, And from their Temple, with destroying fire, Scar'd the unresisting Deity, the spoils Were seiz'd, and consecrate to mightier Bel. BELSHAZZAR. Let them be borne to grace our feast! KALASSAN. Most honour'd Were they by such a noble profanation! Give ye the order— Ha! what frantic shriek Peals through the courts? PRIEST. The slaves that girt themselves To bear those vessels, on a sudden, all, As though by viewless lightnings struck to earth, Lie grovelling on the pavement, and they clench Their vacant hands in horror. KALASSAN. Raise them up, And lash them to their duty. SECOND PRIEST. King of Earth! The armed statue of thy ancestor, Great Nabonassar, on its firm-set pedestal Shakes, and its marble panoply resounds Like distant thunder! KALASSAN. How! the pavement rocks Beneath our feet, like a tempestuous sea! BELSHAZZAR. What! are Belshazzar's mandates thus delay'd For the pale fears of slaves, and idle sounds That shake the earth, but not his kingly soul? Away with them! we will not brook remonstrance From vanquish'd men, or Gods;—Away! I say— CHORUS. Sovereign of all the streams that flow From hills of everlasting snow, Through vast Chaldea's fertile reign, Down to the red and pearly main; The Erythrean Sea, the Gulf of Persia, celebrated for the pearls of Ormuz. And ere thy giant course is done, Through all imperial Babylon; By stately towers and palace fair, And blooming gardens hung in air; By every glowing brazen gate, Rollest thy full exulting state. Proud River! strew thy waves to rest, And smooth to peace thy azure breast, While slowly o'er thy willing tide, Belshazzar's gilded galleys ride. Hear, King of Floods! Euphrates, hear! And pay the homage of thy fear. CHORUS OF SUPPLIANTS. Sovereign of all the lamps that shine In yon empyreal arch divine, That roll'st through half the fiery day, O'er realms that own Chaldea's sway; O'er thrones, whose monarchs wear her yoke, And cities by her conquests broke; Thou Sun, whose morning splendors dwell Upon the temple towers of Bel, The quiver of thy noontide rays Exhaust in all their fiery blaze, Upon the cloud-aspiring throne Where rests the God of Babylon! So shall the God in glory come Down to his sumptuous earthly home. Hear!—Monarch of the Planets! hear— And pause upon thy fleet career. The Quarter of the Jewish Slaves. IMLAH, NAOMI, BENINA. BENINA. Father! dear Father! said'st thou that our feet Shall tread the glittering paths of Sion's hill; And that our lips shall breathe the fragrant airs That blow from dewy Hermon, and the fount Of Siloe flow in liquid music by us? IMLAH. Oh, daughter of captivity, and born To eat the bitter bread of servitude, Benina, child of sadness!—yet the dearer Because thou art the joy of desolate hearts That have no joy but thee!—what knowest thou Of that fair city, where our Fathers dwelt While unforsaken by their God? BENINA. My father! Have I not seen my mother and thyself Sit by the river side, and dwell for ever On Salem's glories, and the Temple's pride, Till tears have choked your sad though pleasant speech? In the deep midnight, when our lords are sleeping, I've seen the Brethren from the willows take The wind-caressed harps, their half-breathed sounds Scarce louder than the rippling river's dash Around the matted sedge; and still they pour'd Their voices down the stream, as though they wish'd Their songs to pass away to other lands Beyond the bounds of their captivity. I've listen'd in an ecstasy of tears, Till purer waters seem'd to wander near me, And sweeter flowers to bloom beneath my feet, And towers of fairer structure to arise Under the moonlight; and I felt the joy Of freedom in my light and sportive limbs. IMLAH. My sweetest child, and thou that gav'st to me This dearest treasure, Naomi—thyself, Even as thou wert in virgin loveliness My plighted bride, renewed to tenderest youth! I will not say I hope not (though my fears And conscience of our ill desert reprove me) That God even now prepares the promised hour, When Israel shall shake off Assyria's chains, And build long-wasted Sion's lovely walls. The sands of the appointed years are run; The signs break out, as in the cloudy night The stars; and buried Prophets' voices seem As from their graves to cry aloud, and mark The hour that labours with our Israel's glory; And, more than all, but yesterday I saw The holy Daniel— NAOMI. Daniel! what of him, Dear Imlah? IMLAH. Till but lately he was girt With sackcloth, with the meagre hue of fasting On his sunk cheek, and ashes on his head; When, lo! at once he shook from his grey locks The attire of woe, and call'd for wine; and since He hath gone stately through the wondering streets With a sad scorn. Amid the heaven-piercing towers, Through cool luxurious courts, and in the shade Of summer trees that play o'er crystal fountains, He walks as though he trod o'er moss-grown ruins, 'Mid the deep desolation of a city Already by the almighty wrath laid waste. And sometimes doth he gaze upon the clouds, As though he recognized the viewless forms Of arm'd destroyers in the silent skies. And it is said, that at the dead of night He hath pour'd forth thy burden, Babylon! And loud proclaim'd the bowing down of Bel, The spoiling of the spoiler. Even our lords, As conscious of God's glory gathering round him, Look on him with a silent awe, nor dare To check his motion, or reprove his speech. NAOMI. Oh, Imlah! shall our buried bones repose In our own land? BENINA. Speak on, my dearest Father, Thy words are like the breezes of the west, That breathe of Canaan's honey-flowing land. IMLAH. My child! my child! thy nuptials shall not be With song suppress'd, and dim half-curtain'd lamp, Stol'n from the observance of our jealous lords, As mine and thy fond mother's were.—Who's here? BENINA. 'Tis Adonijah: he hath heard thee name him, And he will see the burning on my cheek, And so detect our cause of fond discourse. IMLAH. I named him not— BENINA. Nay, father, now thou mock'st me. IMLAH. Alas! poor deer, thou'rt deeply stricken! Well— It is a noble boy, that dares to fear His God, nor makes his youth a privilege For licence, and intemperate scorn of rule. THE ABOVE, ADONIJAH. IMLAH. Whence com'st thou, Adonijah, with thy brow Elate, and full of pride, that scarce beseems A captive? ADONIJAH. Imlah! from the dawn of day I have been gazing from the walls, and saw The Persian reining in his fiery squadrons. Like ostriches they swept the sandy plain, As though they would outstrip the tardy winds; And paus'd and wheel'd, and through the clouds of dust That rose around them, as round terrible Angels, Their scimitars in silver radiance flash'd. Oh, will it ever be, that once again The Lord of Hosts will lift the Lion banner Of Judah, and her sons go forth to war Like Joshua, or like him whose beardless strength O'erthrew the giant Philistine! BENINA. Ah, me! And would'st thou, Adonijah, seek the war, The ruthless, murderous, and destroying war? ADONIJAH. Why, yes! nor would Benina love me less For bringing home the spoil of God's proud foes, To hang within his vindicated Temple. BENINA. So thou didst bring thyself unharm'd, unchanged, Benina were content. ADONIJAH. Heaven's blessings on thee! IMLAH. Hear me, young Adonijah; thou dost love My child: Benina, shall I say, or leave it To thine own lips or eloquent eyes to tell, How well thou lov'st the noble Adonijah? But, youth, I seek not to delay thy joy With the cold envious prudence of old age, That never felt the boiling blood of youth; For if I did, there's one would chide me here For my forgetfulness of hours like these. But yet I would not have my daughter wed With the sad dowry of a master's stripes; I would not, Adonijah, on the eve Of our deliverance, that the wanton Gentile Should pass his jest on our cold entertainment, And all the cheerless joy when captives wed, To breed a race, whose sole inheritance Shall be their parents' tasks and heavy bondage. Our father Jacob served seven tardy years For beauteous Rachel, but I tax not thee With such a weary service. ADONIJAH. Be they ages So the life beat within this bounding heart, The love shall never fail! IMLAH. Here's one would trust thee, Youth, should my cautious age be slow. Come hither, Thou tender vine, that need'st a noble stem: Repine not thou because I wed thee not To this fair elm, until the gentle airs Of our own land, and those delicious dews That weep like angels' tears of love, o'er all The hill of Sion, gladden your sweet union, And make you bear your clustering fruits in joy. So now, enough, thou dost accept the terms, And in the name of Him that rules on high, I thus betroth the noble Adonijah To soft Benina.— Now, to him that hears The captive's prayer. How long—oh, Lord!—how long Shall strangers trample down thy beauteous Sion? How long shall Judah's hymns arise to thee On foreign winds, and sad Jerusalem On all her hills be desolate and mute? God of the Thunder! from whose cloudy seat The fiery winds of Desolation flow: Father of Vengeance! that with purple feet, Like a full wine-press, tread'st the world below. The embattled armies wait thy sign to slay, Nor springs the beast of havoc on his prey, Nor withering Famine walks his blasted way, Till thou the guilty land hast seal'd for woe. God of the Rainbow! at whose gracious sign The billows of the proud their rage suppress: Father of Mercies! at one word of thine An Eden blooms in the waste wilderness! And fountains sparkle in the arid sands, And timbrels ring in maidens' glancing hands, And marble cities crown the laughing lands, And pillar'd temples rise thy name to bless. O'er Judah's land thy thunders broke—oh, Lord! The chariots rattled o'er her sunken gate, Her sons were wasted by the Assyrian sword, Even her foes wept to see her fallen state; And heaps her ivory palaces became, Her Princes wore the captive's garb of shame, Her Temple sank amid the smouldering flame, For thou didst ride the tempest-cloud of fate. O'er Judah's land thy rainbow, Lord, shall beam, And the sad City lift her crownless head; And songs shall wake, and dancing footsteps gleam, Where broods o'er fallen streets the silence of the dead. The sun shall shine on Salem's gilded towers, On Carmel's side our maidens cull the flowers, To deck, at blushing eve, their bridal bowers, And angel feet the glittering Sion tread. Thy vengeance gave us to the stranger's hand, And Abraham's children were led forth for slaves; With fetter'd steps we left our pleasant land, Envying our fathers in their peaceful graves. The stranger's bread with bitter tears we steep, And when our weary eyes should sink to sleep, 'Neath the mute midnight we steal forth to weep, Where the pale willows shade Euphrates' waves. The born in sorrow shall bring forth in joy; Thy mercy, Lord, shall lead thy children home; He that went forth a tender yearling boy, Yet, ere he die, to Salem's streets shall come. And Canaan's vines for us their fruits shall bear, And Hermon's bees their honied stores prepare; And we shall kneel again in thankful prayer, Where, o'er the cherub-seated God, full blaz'd th' irradiate dome. The Walls of Babylon. BELSHAZZAR IN HIS CHARIOT, NITOCRIS, ARIOCH, SABARIS, &amp;c. BELSHAZZAR. For twice three hours our stately cars have roll'd Along the broad highway that crowns the walls Of mine imperial City, nor complete Our circuit by a long and ample space. And still our eyes look down on gilded roofs, And towers and temples, and the spreading tops Of cedar groves, through which the fountains gleam; And everywhere the countless multitudes, Like summer insects in the noontide sun, Come forth to bask in our life-wakening presence. Oh, thou vast Babylon! what mighty hand Created thee, and spread thee o'er the plain Capacious as a world; and girt thee round With high tower'd walls, and bound thy gates with brass; And taught the indignant river to endure Thy bridge of cedar and of palm, high hung Upon its marble piers?—What voice proclaim'd, Amid the silence of the sands, “Arise! And be earth's wonder?” Was it not my fathers'? Yea, mine entombed ancestors awake, Their heads uplift upon their marble pillows; They claim the glory of thy birth. Thou hunter, That didst disdain the quarry of the field, Choosing thee out a nobler game of man, Nimrod! and thou that with unfeminine hand Didst lash the coursers of thy battle-car O'er prostrate thrones, and necks of captive kings, Semiramis! and thou whose kingly breath Was like the desert wind, before its coming The people of all earth fell down, and hid Their humble faces in the dust! that mad'st The pastime of a summer day t' o'erthrow A city, or cast down some ancient throne; Whose voice each ocean shore obey'd, and all From sable Ethiopia to the sands Of the gold-flowing Indian streams;—oh! thou Lord of the hundred thrones, high Nabonassar! And thou my father, Merodach! ye crown'd This City with her diadem of towers— Wherefore?—but prescient of Belshazzar's birth, And conscious of your destin'd son, ye toil'd To rear a meet abode. Oh, Babylon! Thou hast him now, for whom through ages rose Thy sky-exalted towers—for whom yon palace Rear'd its bright domes, and groves of golden spires; In whom, secure of immortality Thou stand'st, and consecrate from time and ruin, Because thou hast been the dwelling of Belshazzar! NITOCRIS. I hear thy words: like thine, thy mother's heart Swells, oh, my son! to see thy seat of empire. But will the Lord of Babylon endure What in yon plain beneath offends our sight, The rebel Persian? BELSHAZZAR. Gave we not command, To Tartan and to Artamas, to sweep Yon tribes away, or ere our car approach'd The northern wall? ARIOCH. They hasted forth, oh King! But Tartan came not back, nor Artamas. BELSHAZZAR. Slaves! did they dare to fall off from their allegiance? ARIOCH. To the dominion they fell off of him That hath the empire o'er departed souls. NITOCRIS. Look down! look down! where, proud of his light conquest, The Persian rides—it is the youthful Cyrus; How skilfully he winds through all the ranks His steed, in graceful ease, as though he sate Upon a firm-set throne, yet every motion Obedient to his slack and gentle rein, As though one will controll'd the steed and rider; Now leaps he down and holds a brief discourse With yon helm'd captain; like a pouncing falcon, Now vaults he to the patient courser's back. Happy the mother of that noble youth! BELSHAZZAR. Now, by great Bel! thou dost abuse our patience. Is that the rebel king to whom Belshazzar Should vail his pride, and stoop to be his foe; Him with the brazen arms, that, dimly bright, Scarce boast distinction from the meaner host? Where are his golden attributes of power, The glorious ensigns of his sovereignty; The jewel'd diadem, the ivory sceptre, The satrap-circled throne, the kneeling hosts?— NITOCRIS. Dost ask, my son, his marks of sovereignty? The armies that behold his sign, and trust Their fate upon the wisdom of his rule, Confident of accustom'd victory; The unconquerable valour, the proud love Of danger, and the scorn of silken ease; The partnership in suffering and in want, Even with his meanest follower; the disdain Of wealth, that wins the spoil but to bestow it, Content with the renown of conquering deeds. BELSHAZZAR. By all our Gods!— SABARIS. Great Queen! it ill beseems The lowest of Chaldea's slaves to oppose The mother of our king with insolent speech; But my bold zeal for him that rules the world Has made me dauntless. Is it not heaven's will, Written in the eternal course of human things, Some kings are born to toil, and some to enjoy; Some to build up the palace domes of power, That in their glowing shade their sons may sit Transcendent in luxurious ease, as they In conquest? 'Tis the privilege of the chosen, The mark'd of fate, and favourites of the Gods, To find submissive earth deck'd out, a fair And summer garden house, for one long age Of toilless pleasure, and luxurious revel. BELSHAZZAR. The slave speaks well: and thee, oh queen Nitocris! This eve will we compel, with gracious violence, To own our loftier fate. This sacred eve We'll have an army wide as yon that spreads Its tents to the hot sands; and they shall feast Around me, all reclined on ivory couches, Strew'd with Sidonian purple, and soft webs Of Egypt; fanned by bright and glittering plumes Held in the snowy hands of virgin slaves; And o'er their turban'd heads shall lightly wave The silken canopies, that softly tremble To gales of liquid odour: all the courts Shall breathe like groves of cassia and of nard. And every paradise of golden fruits, The forests and the tributary streams, In this one banquet shall exhaust their stores Of delicates; the swans and Phasian birds, And roes and deer from off a thousand hills, Serv'd in the spices of the farthest East. And we will feast to dulcimers and lutes, And harps and cymbals, and all instruments Of rapturous sound, till it shall seem the stars Have stoop'd the nearer to our earth, to crown Our banquet with their heavenly concert. There, Our captains and our councillors, our wives And bright-eyed concubines, through all the palace Th' array of splendour shall prolong—while I, In state supreme, and glory that shall shame The setting sun amid his purple clouds, Will on my massy couch of gold recline: Then shalt thou come, and seeing thy son the orb And centre of this radiance, even thyself Shalt wonder at thy impious speech, that dared To equal aught on earth to great Belshazzar. And now, lead on!— THE ABOVE, BENINA, IMLAH, ADONIJAH, PRIESTS. BENINA. Ah, save me! save me! ARIOCH. Peace! Before the king!— BELSHAZZAR. What frantic maid is this, That shrieks and flies, with loose and rending garments, And streaming hair?—And who are these that circle her, And sing around her? SABARIS. Live, oh king, for ever! Chaldea's priests, that seek this evening's bride For mightiest Bel. PRIESTS. Beauteous damsel! chosen to meet First our wandering heaven-led feet. Spotless virgin! thee alone The great God of Babylon, From his starry seat above, Hath beheld with looks of love. Bride of him that rules the sky! Cast not down thy weeping eye. Daughter of the captive race! For thine high and blissful place, In the heaven-hung chamber laid, Many a Babylonian maid To the voiceless midnight air, Murmurs low her bashful prayer. With enamour'd homage see, Round and round we circle thee; Round and round each dancing foot Glitters to the breathing lute. SABARIS. Why dost thou struggle thus, fond slave? BENINA. My father!— My dearest Adonijah! speak to him— The panting breath swells in my throat, my words Can find no utterance, save to thee. IMLAH. Great king! They rend away my child, mine only child!— BELSHAZZAR. Peace! she is borne to serve the God of Babylon: And ye should fall, and kiss their garment hems, And bless them for the glory that awaits The captive maiden— ADONIJAH. Glory! call ye it, To be the lustful prey— BENINA. Sweet youth! no more. Oh, speak not!—by the love thou bearest me— By all our hopes—alas! what hopes have we?— Let me endure no sufferings but my own. BELSHAZZAR. Priests, to your office!— BENINA. Oh! no mercy—none— Not even in thee, that wear'st a woman's form, But all the cold relentless pride of man— Mightiest of queens!—would I might add most gracious— IMLAH. God of our fathers! that alone canst save, Look down upon this guileless innocent. Lo! pale and fainting, like a wounded fawn She hangs upon their arms—death scarce could throw A sadder paleness, or more icy torpor, Over that form, whose loveliness is now Its bane, and stamps it for the worst of misery. ADONIJAH. Oh, for a Median scimitar! ARIOCH. What said he? BENINA. Nought—nought— ARIOCH. The slave forgets that scourges hang Upon our walls— IMLAH. And we had fondly thought The bitter dregs of our captivity Drunk out! Farewell, my child! thou dost not hear me— Thou liest in cold and enviable senselessness, And we might almost fear, or hope, that death— Compassionate death—had freed thee from their violence. What now, my child? ADONIJAH. Oh, beautiful Benina! Why do thy timorous dove-like eyes awake, And glow with scorn? why dost thou shake away The swoon of bashful fear, and stand erect, Thou, that didst hang, but now, like a loose woodbine, Trailing its beauteous clusters in the dust? BENINA. Give place, and let me speak unto my father, And to this youth.— Fierce men! your care is vain— I will not stoop to fly. IMLAH. My soul is lost In wonder; yet I touch thee once again, And that is rapture. BENINA. Did ye not behold him Upon the terrace-top?—the Man of God! The anointed Prophet! IMLAH. Daniel! BENINA. He whose lips Burn with the fire from heaven! I saw him, father: Alone he stood, and in his proud compassion Look'd down upon this pomp that blaz'd beneath him, As one that sees a stately funeral. IMLAH. He spoke not? BENINA. No:—like words articulate, His looks address'd my soul, and said—‘Oh maid, Be of good cheer’—and, like a robe of light, A rapture fell upon me, and I caught Contagious scorn of earthly power; and fear And bashful shame are gone, and in the might Of God, of Abraham's God, our father's God, I stand, superior to the insulting heathen. BELSHAZZAR. What! wait ye still to lead the Gods their slave, And thus delay Belshazzar's course? BENINA. Your Gods! Whom I disdain to honour with my dread. BELSHAZZAR. Off with her! and advance our royal car:— Set forward.— [Belshazzar departs with his train. BENINA. Ye shall need no force to drag me. My father!—Adonijah!—gaze not thus, Blaspheming, with your timorous doubts, the arm Of the Most High, that waves above mine head In silent might unseen!— And thou—go on, Go on thy stately course—Imperial Lord Of golden Babylon! the scourge that lash'd The Nations, from whose mantling cup of pride Earth drank, and with the fierce intoxication Scoff'd at the enduring heavens. Go on, in awe And splendor, radiant as the morning star, But as the morning star to be cast down Into the deep of deeps. Long, long the Lord Hath bade his Prophets cry to all the world, That Babylon shall cease! Their words of fire Flash round my soul, and lighten up the depths Of dim futurity! I hear the voice Of the expecting grave!—I hear abroad The exultation of unfetter'd earth!— From East to West they lift their trampled necks, Th' indignant nations: earth breaks out in scorn; The valleys dance and sing; the mountains shake Their cedar-crowned tops! The strangers crowd To gaze upon the howling wilderness, Where stood the Queen of Nations. Lo! even now, Lazy Euphrates rolls his sullen waves Through wastes, and but reflects his own thick reeds. I hear the bitterns shriek, the dragons cry; I see the shadow of the midnight owl Gliding where now are laughter-echoing palaces! O'er the vast plain I see the mighty tombs Of kings in sad and broken whiteness gleam Beneath the o'er grown cypress—but no tomb Bears record, Babylon, of thy last lord; Even monuments are silent of Belshazzar! PRIEST. Still must we hear it?— BENINA. Yea, ye must!—the words Of God will find a voice in every wind; The stones will speak, the marble walls cry out! PRIEST. Maid, in Bel's appointed bride We must brook the words of pride; Mortal voice may ne'er reprove Whom the bright immortals love; Nor hand of mortal violate Her, the chosen immortal's mate. BENINA. Oh, Adonijah! sooth my mother's tears; Be to my father what I should have been; And now farewell! Forget not her whose thoughts, In terror and in rapture, still will dwell On thee: in prayer, at morn and eve, forget not Her who will need prayers worthier than her own. Before the House of Imlah. IMLAH, ADONIJAH. IMLAH. We are here at length:—we two have glided on Like voiceless ghosts along the crowded streets. The miserable pour their tale of anguish Into the happy ear, and feel sweet solace From his compassion; but the wretched find No comfort from imparting mutual bitterness. I know I ought to feel that God protects My child—I can but think that heathen arms Have torn her from my bleeding heart! I know I ought to kindle with the heavenly fire Of her rapt spirit, to dauntlessness like hers. I can but tremble for her tender loveliness, That us'd to cling to me for its support, Like a soft lily, for the world's rude airs Too frail. ADONIJAH. Scarce dare I speak, lest I speak rashly. I have rebuked and struggled with my sorrow, Till I detected in my secret heart A proud reproach, that I was born a son Of Abraham, to be trampled in the dust Like a base worm, that dare not turn to sting The insulting foot. IMLAH. Oh cool decline of day, That wert the captive's hour of joy, his tasks Fulfill'd, his master's wayward pride worn out, How wert thou wont to lead my weary foot To such a blissful home,—I've oft forgot It was a captive's. Naomi, my wife, I never fear'd to meet thy loving looks Till now. THE ABOVE, NAOMI. NAOMI. So, Imlah, thou'rt return'd:—and thou, My son, I'll call thee.—Sweet it is t' anticipate, And make the fond tongue thus familiar With words that it so oft must use. Stay, stay, Beloved! and I'll call forth, or ere ye enter, My child, whose welcome will be sweeter to you Than the cold babbling of her aged mother:— I had forgot—she went abroad with you. IMLAH. Have mercy, Heaven! NAOMI. Now, whither is she gone? To seek for thee the cup of sparkling water With which she used to lave thy burning brow; Or gather thee the rosy fruit, that gain'd Fresh sweetness to thy taste, from that dear hand That offer'd it. She ever thought—though weary Herself and wanting food—of ministering First to the ease and joy of those she lov'd.— Ha! tears upon thy brow, thy noble brow, Which I have seen endure— IMLAH. Go in!—no, stay Without! I cannot venture where some mark Of her fond duty and officious care Will be the first thing mine eyes see.—My wife, Why dost thou tear thine hair, and clasp thy brain? I have not told thee— NAOMI. What hast thou to tell me? Thou'rt here without her:—thou and this brave youth Have eyes that burst with tears. She's lost!—she's dead! IMLAH. Would that she were! NAOMI. Unnatural father! wretch, That hast no touch of human pity in thee, To tell a mother thou canst wish her child Where her fond arms can never fold her more!— Oh, Imlah! Imlah! tell me—tell me all— Ye cannot tell me more than what I fear. IMLAH. They tore her from us, for a paramour For their false Gods— NAOMI. 'Tis ever thus:—most bless'd But to be made most wretched! IMLAH. Pardon her, Oh Lord! oh, we can chide on others' lips, What our own burn to utter! NAOMI. All my care, My jealous, vigilant, and restless care, To veil her from the eyes of man, to keep her Like a sweet violet, that the airs of heaven Scarcely detect in its secluded shade, All waste and vain! I was so proud, to think I had conceal'd our treasure from the knowledge Of our rude masters—and I thought how envied I should return among our barren mothers, To Salem. IMLAH. Dearest! she beheld—she felt The arm of Israel's God protecting her. Thou canst not think with what a beauteous scorn Our soft and timorous child o'erawed the spoiler— How nobly she reproved our fears. NAOMI. Poor fool! To be deluded by those tender arts She ever used—her only arts—to spare Our bleeding hearts from knowing when she suffer'd. What! she look'd fearless, did she? She in the arms Of sinful men, that trembled at heaven's airs, When they came breathing o'er her blushing cheek. And ye—thou Adonijah, that dost know Her timorous nature, wert deceived?—cold comfort! Have ye no better? IMLAH. Oh, weep! weep, my wife! Look not upon me with those stony eyes! Oh, think—the cup is bitter, but the Lord May change it;—think of him that lost so many, His sons and daughters, at their jocund feast, All at one blow—and said—God gave, and God Hath taken away Job i. 21.. NAOMI. Had he but one, like ours; One that engross'd his undivided love; One such as ne'er before blest human heart, Would he have said so? Wilt not tell me, too, How Sarah in her old age bore a child, To be a joy within her desolate house. Go on—go on—recount each act of love, Each merciful miracle, that we may know How gracious God hath been to all—but us. IMLAH. Hear her not, God of Israel!—oh, my son! We must distract this frenzy, or 'twill blight Heaven's hoped for blessings to a barren curse, And intercept some soft descending mercy. What shall we do?—what say?—to dissipate Her brooding thoughts? We'll take the harps that hang Around us, and are used to feel the hand Of sorrow trembling on their mournful strings. When ye demand sweet Sion's songs to mock them, Proud strangers, our right hands forget their cunning. But ye revenge you, wringing from our hearts Sounds that might melt your senseless stones to pity. HYMN. Oh, thou that wilt not break the bruised reed, Nor heap fresh ashes on the mourner's brow, Nor rend anew the wounds that inly bleed, The only balm of our afflictions thou, Teach us to bear thy chastening wrath, oh God! To kiss with quivering lips—still humbly kiss thy rod! We bless thee, Lord, though far from Judah's land; Though our worn limbs are black with stripes and chains; Though for stern foes we till the burning sand; And reap, for other's joy, the summer plains; We bless thee, Lord, for thou art gracious still, Even though this last black drop o'erflow our cup of ill! We bless thee for our lost, our beauteous child: The tears, less bitter, she hath made us weep; The weary hours her graceful sports have 'guiled, And the dull cares her voice hath sung to sleep! She was the dove of hope to our lorn ark; The only star that made the strangers' sky less dark! Our dove has fall'n into the spoiler's net; Rude hands defile her plumes, so chastely white; To the bereaved their one soft star is set, And all above is sullen, cheerless night! But still we thank thee for our transient bliss— Yet, Lord, to scourge our sins remain'd no way but this? As when our Father to Mount Moriah led The blessing's heir, his age's hope and joy, Pleased, as he roam'd along with dancing tread, Chid his slow sire, the fond, officious boy, And laugh'd in sport to see the yellow fire Climb up the turf-built shrine, his destined funeral pyre— Even thus our joyous child went lightly on; Bashfully sportive, timorously gay, Her white foot bounded from the pavement stone Like some light bird from off the quivering spray; And back she glanced, and smiled, in blameless glee, The cars, and helms, and spears, and mystic dance to see. By thee, oh Lord, the gracious voice was sent That bade the Sire his murderous task forego: When to his home the child of Abraham went His mother's tears had scarce begun to flow. Alas! and lurks there, in the thicket's shade, The victim to replace our lost, devoted maid? Lord, even through thee to hope were now too bold; Yet 'twere to doubt thy mercy to despair. 'Tis anguish, yet 'tis comfort, faint and cold, To think how sad we are, how blest we were! To speak of her is wretchedness, and yet It were a grief more deep and bitterer to forget! Oh Lord our God! why was she e'er our own? Why is she not our own—our treasure still? We could have pass'd our heavy years alone. Alas! is this to bow us to thy will? Ah, even our humblest prayers we make repine, Nor, prostrate thus on earth, our hearts to thee resign. Forgive, forgive—even should our full hearts break; The broken heart thou wilt not, Lord, despise: Ah! thou art still too gracious to forsake, Though thy strong hand so heavily chastise. Hear all our prayers, hear not our murmurs, Lord; And, though our lips rebel, still make thyself ador'd. The Front of the Temple Herodotus states that the Temple of the Babylonian Jupiter was standing in his days. In the midst of it was a tower, a stadium (about a furlong) in length and breadth; upon this rose a second tower, and above that another, to the number of eight. The ascent wound in a circle round all the towers. In the middle of the ascent were seats and resting places, where those ascending might repose. In the last tower was a large shrine, and within the shrine, a richly strewn couch and a golden table. There was no statue within the shrine, nor did any man pass the night there, but only one of the native women, whichever the God might choose. So say the Chaldeans who are the Priests of the God. —Clio. clxxi. I have interposed mere resting places, and assigned each tower to some particular purpose.. PRIESTS WITHIN. Hark! what dancing footsteps fall Light before the Temple wall? Who are ye that seek to pass Through the burnish'd gate of brass? Come ye with the gifts of Kings, With the peacock's bright-eyed wings? With the myrrh and fragrant spice? With the spotless sacrifice? With the spoils of conquer'd lands? With the works of maidens' hands, O'er the glittering loom that run, Underneath the orient sun? Bring ye pearl, or choicest gem, From a plunder'd diadem? Ivory wand, or ebony From the sable Indian tree? Purple from the Tyrian shore; Amber cup, or coral store, From the branching trees that grow Under the salt sea-water's flow? PRIESTS, WITH BENINA. With a fairer gift we come To the God's majestic home Than the pearls the rich shells weep In the Erythrean deep. All our store of ebony Sparkles in her radiant eye. Whiter far her spotless skin Than the gauzy vestures thin, Bleach'd upon the shores of Nile; Grows around no palmy isle Coral like her swelling lips, Whence the gale its sweetness sips, That upon the spice-tree blown Seems a fragrance all its own; Never yet so fair a maid On the bridal couch was laid; Never form beseem'd so well The immortal arms of Bel. PRIESTS, LEADING HER IN. Mid the dashing fountains cool, In the marble vestibule, Where the orange branches play, Freshen'd by the silver spray, Heaven-led virgin, take thy rest, While we bear the silken vest And the purple robe of pride Meet for Bel's expected bride. ALL THE PRIESTS. Bridelike now she stands array'd! Welcome, welcome, dark-hair'd maid! Lead her in, with dancing feet, Lead her in, with music sweet, With the cymbals glancing round, And the hautboy's silver sound. See the golden gates expand, And the Priests, on either hand, On their faces prone they fall Entering the refulgent Hall. With the tread that suits thy state, Glowing cheek, and look elate, With thine high unbending brow, Sacred maiden, enter thou. FIRST PRIEST. Chosen of Bel, thou stand'st within the Temple, Within the first and lowest of our Halls, Yet not least sumptuous. On the jasper pavement, Each in his deep alcove, Chaldea's Kings Stand on their carved pedestals. Behold them! Their marble brows still wear the conscious awe Of sovereignty—the mightiest of the dead, As of the living. Eminent, in the centre, The golden statue stands of Nabonassar, That in the plain of Dura, to the sound Of harp, and lute, and dulcimer, received The homage of the world It does not appear certain what this statue was, which Nebuchadnezzar erected on the plain of Dura. I have taken the poetic licence of supposing it to be his own.. The Scythian hills, The margin of the Syrian sea, the Isles Of Ocean, their adoring tribes cast down; And the high sun, at noonday, saw no face Of all mankind turned upward from the dust, Save the imperial brow of Nabonassar, That rose in lonely loftiness, as now Yon awe-crown'd image. BENINA. Have ye wrought him, too, As when he prowl'd the plain, th' associate Of the brute herd that browsed around, nor own'd The dread of a superior presence, beat By the uncourtly rains and wintry winds Upon the undiadem'd head? PRIEST. Cease, cease, nor tempt The loving patience of the God too far! Advance; and wind along the aspiring stair. PRIESTS. Haste! the fading light of day Scarce will gild our lofty way. Haste, nor tremble, tender maid! To the sculptured balustrade Cling not thus with snowy hand; None but slaves around thee stand, On thy footsteps proud to wait: Hark! the slow-recoiling gate Opens at our trumpets' call; Enter, now, our second Hall. SECOND PRIEST. Well mayest thou hold thine alabaster hand, Through which the rosy light so softly shines, Before thine eyes, oh! maiden, as thou enterest The Chamber of the Tribute. Here thou seest The wealth of all the subject world, piled up In order—from its multitude that seems Confusion: in each deep, receding vault, O'er all the spacious pavement, 'tis the same; The flaming gold, and ivory, and the gems— If all mankind were Kings, enough to crown Each brow with an imperial diadem! BENINA. Oh! rapt Isaiah, were they not thy words— How hath she ceased—the golden city ceased! Will all that wealth but ransom thee an hour, Or bribe the impartial and undazzled Ruin One instant to suspend its swooping wing? PRIESTS. Breathe again the clear blue air: Mount again the marble stair: Still we mount—on high—on high, To the exulting harmony! Hark! the strain of triumph rings In the Hall of Captive Kings. THIRD PRIEST. Now pause again: yon chained images Are those that ruled the world, or ere the Lord Of great Chaldea took the all-ruling sceptre Into his iron hand, and laid the pride Of all the kingdoms prostrate at his feet BENINA. Oh! King of Judah, thou art there! Thy foes, In charitable cruelty, did quench Thy sightless eyes, lest thou should'st see the dwelling Which thou had'st changed for Sion's beauteous hill; Lest thou should'st more than hear thy sorrowing people Doom'd by thy sins, and by their own, to bondage. Thou, Zedekiah Zedekiah, carried away at the last and final desolation of Jerusalem., did'st desert thy God, And wert of God deserted;—nor to thee Is given, withdrawn into a foreign grave, To feel again soft Canaan's fragrant gales On thy blind brow, almost persuading thee That, in thy darkness, thou canst still behold Some once-lov'd spot, or dim-remember'd scene. The glad deliverance that comes to Judah Comes not to thee. Alas! to sad Benina, Oh, gracious God of Abraham, will it come? PRIESTS. Maid, again we lift the song; Thy soft feet have rested long; Nearer, nearer, as we climb To the highest Hall sublime, Bride of the Immortal, thee All the city throngs to see, Floating, like a snowy dove, In the azure clouds above. Lo! the fourth of our abodes, Chamber of the captive Gods! BENINA. Oh, Lord of Hosts! I dare not gaze around me, Lest in yon heaps of monstrous forms uncouth The scaly Dagon, and the brute Osiris, Moon-crown'd Astarte, or the Sun-like Mithra, Some shape I should behold by the blind Gentile Held worthy to enclose th' Illimitable That fills the Heaven and Earth. The Cherubim, Perchance, are here, behind whose golden wings Thy fiery presence dwelt, but dwells no more. I know that danger waits me on yon height, But hither haste I rather than behold Profaning Heathens scorn what thou hast glorified. Lead on— PRIESTS. Half thy journey now is past; Who shall wonder at thine haste:— Dost not wish for wings to fly To thy blissful destiny? Yet, oh tread with footstep light As the falling dews of night; Like the gliding serpent creep Where the gifted Dreamers sleep; Fold thou close thy fluttering dress, Even thy panting breath suppress, Lest some glorious dream we break:— Lo! 'tis vain—they move—they wake! THE DREAMERS. Hark! hark! the foot—we hear the trembling foot, With motion like the dying wind upon a silver lute: Upon our sleep it came, as soft itself as sleep; It shone upon our visions like a star upon the deep. Lo! lo! the form, the graceful form we see That seem'd, through all the live-long night, before our eyes to be: Above, the eyes of sparkling jet, the browlike marblefair; And down, and o'er the snowy breast, the dark and wandering hair. Hark! hark! the song—we hear the bridal song— Amid the listening stars it flows the sounding heavens along! It follows the Immortal down from his empyreal sky, Descending to his mortal bride in full divinity! BENINA. What! are your dreams so soft; and saw ye nought Of midnight flames, that clomb the palace walls, And ran along the terrace colonnades, And pour'd the liquid walls in torrent flames Of dark asphaltus?—Heard ye not the wail Of wounded men, and shrieks of flying women; And the carv'd Gods dash'd down in cumbrous ruin On their own shrines? PRIESTS. Great Bel avert the omen! PRIESTS. Hurry on, nor more delay; Shadows darken on our way; Only in the hall we tread; Ask of those the stars that read, Catching every influence Their all-ruling orbs dispense. From those silent Prophets bright That adorn the vault of night, Watchers of the starry sky, Know ye, feel ye, who is nigh? ASTROLOGERS. What planet rolls its pearly car, What orb of mild or angry hue? The star of love, the silver star, Glides lonely through yon depth of blue. We see her sailing motion calm; We hear the music of her sound; We drink Mylitta's The Assyrian Venus. —Herod. breathing balm, In odorous clouds distill'd around. And calm, and musical and sweet Is she that star's mild influence leads— The maid that, with her snowy feet, Even now the sacred pavement treads. BENINA. Enough of this! Oh! chaste and quiet stars, And pure, as all things from infecting Earth Remov'd, and near the throne of God; whose calm And beautiful obedience to the laws Of your great Maker is a mute reproach To the unruly courses of this world, Would they debase you to the ministers And guilty favourers of their sinful purpose? PRIESTS. Now our toil is all but done; Now the height is all but won; By the High Priest's lonely seat, By Kalassan's still retreat, Where, in many a brazen fold, The slumbering Dragon lies outroll'd, Pass we on, nor pause. And thou Gaze not, Priest, with wondering brow! Lovelier though her cheek appears For her toil and for her tears; And the bosom's vest beneath Heaves the quick and panting breath. KALASSAN. More beautiful ne'er trod our marble stairs! PRIESTS. None!—but still the maid dismiss To her place of destined bliss:— That no mortal eye may see— On! we may not follow thee: Only with our music sweet We pursue thy mounting feet. Now, upon the topmost height, Thou art lost to mortal sight! Lo! the couch beside thee spread, Where the Heaven-loved maids are wed. Till the bridal midnight deep Bow thy head in balmy sleep— Sleep that shall be sweetly broken When the God his bride hath woken. BENINA. Alone! alone upon this giddy height! Yet, better thus than by that frantic rout Encircled: yet a while, and I shall breathe With freedom. Oh! thou cool, delicious silence, How grateful art thou to the ears that ring With that wild music's turbulent dissonance! By slow degrees the starlight face of things Grows clear around my misty, swimming eyes. Oh, Babylon! how art thou spread beneath me! As some wide plain, with rich pavilions set Mid the dark umbrage of a summer grove. Like a small rivulet, that from bank to bank Is ruffled by the sailing cygnet's breast, Euphrates seems to wind. Oh! thou vast city, Thus dwindled to our human sight, what art thou To Him that from his throne, above the skies, Beyond the circuit of the golden Sun, Views all the subject world! The parting day To twilight and the few faint early stars Hath left the city. On yon western lake A momentary gleam is lingering still. Thou'rt purpling now, oh Sun, the vines of Canaan, And crowning, with rich light, the cedar top Of Lebanon, where—but oh! without their daughter— Soon my sad parents shall return. Where are ye, Beloved? I seek in vain the lonely light Of our dear cabin on Euphrates' side, Amid yon kindling fires. And have ye quenched it, That all your dwelling be as darkly sad As are your childless hearts?—And thou—mine own, I thought this morn, and called thee—Adonijah, Art thou, too, thinking of that hour like this; The balmy, tranquil, and scarce starlight hour, When the soft Moon had sent her harbinger, Pale Silence, to foreshow her coming presence; To hush the winds, and smooth the clouds before her?— That hour, that, with delicious treachery, stole The secret from Benina's lips she longed From her full heart t' unburthen? Better, now, Had it been buried in eternal darkness, Than thus have kindled hopes that shone so softly— Were quench'd so soon, so utterly.— Fond heart, These soft, desponding, yet delightful thoughts, Must not dissolve thee to mistrust of Him That fill'd thee as with fire, and touched thy lips With holy scorn of all the wealth and pride That blazed around thy path. Even now I feel My trembling foot more firm; and, like the eagle's, Mine eyes familiar with their cloudy height— What's here?—a hurried tread— What art thou? speak! KALASSAN. The honour'd of the God that honours thee. Oh, miracle of beauty! I beheld thee, And strove with my impatient spirit within To wait th' appointed hour;—but, as the pilgrim Sees the white fountain in the palmy shade, Nor brooks delay, even thus my thirsty eyes Demand their instant feast. BENINA. Thou should'st have brought The sage Diviners to unfold the meaning Of this dark language. KALASSAN. Loveliest bashfulness! Or is it but the sportive ignorance That laughs beneath the dark and glittering eyelids, At the delighted dupe of its dissembling? BENINA. Peace, and avaunt! KALASSAN. O maid! who art so beauteous That yon bright moon is rising, all in haste, To gaze on thee, or to display thy grace To him, that, lost in wonder, scarce hath melted To love. The snowy light falls where she treads, As 'twere a sacred place! in her loose locks It wanders, even as with a sense of pleasure! And trembles on her bosom, that hath caught Its gentle restlessness, and trembles, too, Harmonious. BENINA. Must mine ears endure thee still? KALASSAN. And know'st thou not why thou art here; what bliss, What bridal rapture waits thee? BENINA. There are sins Whose very dread infects the virgin's soul, Tainting the fountain of her secret thoughts; I'm here to suffer evil—what, I know not, But will remain in holy ignorance, Till my dark hour of trial. KALASSAN. Hast thou never, Soft maid, when fervid noon bathes all the world In silence, in thy fond and wandering thoughts, Beheld a noble bridegroom seated near thee, And heard him, 'mid sweet falls of marriage-music, Whispering what made thy pale cheek burn? BENINA. Away!— And must he see my tears? and think me weak, And of my God abandon'd? KALASSAN. Lo! the couch Bestrewn with flowers, whose fragrance and whose hues Shall not have faded, till great Bel come down Beneath that dimly canopied alcove— BENINA. There's that within thy words I ought to fear: But it should seem, that with the earth I've left All earthly fears beneath me. I defy Thee and thy Gods alike. KALASSAN. Alike in truth; For sometimes doth the Mightiest not disdain To veil his glories in a mortal shape, Even great Kalassan's. Look on me, and say If he could choose a nobler. BENINA. What! and fear'st not Thine own false Gods—thou worse than Idol worshipper? Why even the senseless wood and stone might wake To indignation, and their fiery vengeance Break forth from Heaven. Alas! and what have they, Whose name thou dost usurp to cloke thy sin, To do with Heaven more than thy loathsome self? KALASSAN. Thine eyes, albeit so full of scorn, survey not My form in vain. I tell thee, Maid, I tread This earth so conscious that the best of Deity, The power and majesty, reside within me, That I but stoop to win myself a bride Beneath another name: here 'mid the clouds I stand, as in mine own appropriate place. BENINA. The darkest pit of Tophet were too light For thine offence. KALASSAN. Oh! soft and musical voice, Art thou so lavish of injurious words? Erewhile thou'lt be as prodigal of fondness. So now prepare thee: ere two hours are past Thou wedd'st Kalassan, or Kalassan's God, Or both, or either, which thou wilt. Farewell A little while: but I beseech thee, wear When I return this soft becoming pride; Nor imitate, as yet, the amorous slaves Who weary with officious tenderness. Be as thou seem'st, a kindred spirit with mine, And we will mate like eagles in the Heavens, And give our children an immortal heritage To bathe their plumage in the fiery sun. BENINA (alone). Did the earth bear thee, monster! or art thou Th' Eternal Enemy in the human shape? Oh! 'tis the innocent's best security, That the unrighteous pluck the thunderbolt With such resistless violence on their heads. Lord of the insulted Heavens! thou canst not strike This impious man without delivering me; Me, else unworthy of thy gracious mercy. But lo! what blaze of light beneath me spreads O'er the wide city. Like yon galaxy Above mine head, each long and spacious street Becomes a line of silver light, the trees In all their silent avenues break out In flowers of fire. But chief around the Palace Whitens the glowing splendor; every court That lay in misty dimness indistinct, Is traced by pillars and high architraves Of crystal lamps that tremble in the wind: Each portal arch gleams like an earthly rainbow, And o'er the front spreads one entablature Of living gems of every hue, so bright That the pale Moon, in virgin modesty, Retreating from the dazzling and the tumult, Afar upon the distant plain reposes Her unambitious beams, or on the bosom Of the blue river, ere it laves the walls. Hark! too, the sounds of revelry and song Upon the pinions of the breeze come up Even to this height. No eye is closed in sleep; None in vast Babylon but wakes to joy— None—none is sad and desolate but I. Yet over all, I know not whence or how, A dim oppression loads the air, and sounds As of vast wings do somewhere seem to brood And hover on the winds; and I that most Should tremble for myself, the appointed prey Of sin, am bow'd, as with enforced compassion, To think on sorrows not mine own, to weep O'er those whose laughter and whose song upbraid My prodigality of mis-spent pity. I will go rest, if rest it may be call'd— Not, Adonijah—not to think of thee. Oh, bear a brief unwilling banishment From thine own home, my heart; I cannot cope With thy subduing image, and be strong. CHORUS OF BABYLONIANS BEFORE THE PALACE. Awake! awake! put on thy garb of pride, Array thee like a sumptuous royal bride, O festal Babylon! Lady, whose ivory throne Is by the side of many azure waters! In floating dance, like birds upon the wing, Send tinkling forth thy silver-sandal'd daughters; Send in the solemn march, Beneath each portal arch, Thy rich-robed lords to crowd the banquet of their King. They come! they come from both the illumined shores; Down each long street the festive tumult pours; Along the waters dark Shoots many a gleaming bark, Like stars along the midnight welkin flashing, And galleys, with their masts enwreath'd with light, From their quick oars the kindling waters dashing; In one long moving line Along the bridge they shine, And with their glad disturbance wake the peaceful night. Hang forth, hang forth, in all your avenues, The arching lamps of more than rainbow hues, Oh! gardens of delight! With the cool airs of night Are lightly waved your silver-foliaged trees, The deep-embower'd yet glowing blaze prolong Height above height the lofty terraces; Seeing this new day-break, The nestling birds awake, The nightingale hath hush'd her sweet untimely song. Lift up, lift up your golden-valved doors, Spread to the glittering dance your marble floors, Palace! whose spacious halls, And far-receding walls, Are hung with purple like the morning skies; And all the living luxuries of sound Pour from the long out-stretching galleries; Down every colonnade The sumptuous board is laid, With golden cups and lamps and bossy chargers crown'd. They haste, they haste! the high-crown'd Rulers stand, Each with his sceptre in his kingly hand; The bearded Elders sage, Though pale with thought and age; Those through whose bounteous and unfailing hands The tributary streams of treasure flow From the rich bounds of earth's remotest lands; All, but the pomp and pride Of battle, laid aside, Chaldea's Captains stand in many a glittering row. They glide, they glide! each, like an antelope, Bounding in beauty on a sunny slope, With full and speaking eyes, And graceful necks that rise O'er snowy bosoms in their emulous pride, The chosen of earth's choicest loveliness; Some with the veil thrown timidly aside, Some boastful and elate In their majestic state Whose bridal bed Belshazzar's self hath deign'd to bless. Come forth! come forth! and crown the peerless feast, Thou whose high birthright was the effulgent east! On th' ivory seat alone, Monarch of Babylon! Survey the interminable wilderness Of splendor, stretching far beyond the sight; Nought but thy presence wants there now to bless; The music waits for thee, Its fount of harmony, Transcending glory thou of this thrice glorious night! Behold! behold! each gem-crown'd forehead proud And every plume and crested helm is bow'd, Each high-arch'd vault along Breaks out the blaze of song, Belshazzar comes! nor Bel, when he returns From riding on his stormy thunder-cloud, To where his bright celestial palace burns, Alights with loftier tread, More full of stately dread, While under his fix'd feet the loaded skies are bow'd. The Hall of Banquet. CHORUS. Mightiest of the sons of man! The lion in his forest lair, The eagle in the fields of air, Amid the tumbling waves Leviathan, In power without or peer or mate, Hold their inviolable state: Alone Belshazzar stands on earth, Pre-eminent o'er all of human birth, Mightiest of the sons of man! Richest of the sons of man! For thee the mountains teem with gold, The spicy groves their bloom unfold, The bird of beauty bears its feathery fan, And amber paves the yellow seas, And spread the branching coral trees, Nor shrouds the mine its deepest gem, Ambitious to adorn Belshazzar's diadem, Richest of the sons of man! Fairest of the sons of man! Tall as the cedar towers thine head, And fleet and terrible thy tread, As the strong coursers' in the battle's van; An Eden blooms upon thy face; Like music, thy majestic grace Holds the mute gazer's breath suppress'd, And makes a tumult in the wondering breast, Fairest of the sons of man! Noblest of the sons of man! The first a kingly rule that won, Wide as the journey of the sun, From Nimrod thine high-sceptred race began; And gathering splendor still, went down From sire to son the eternal crown, Till full on great Belshazzar's crest Its high meridian glory shone confest,— Noblest of the sons of man! Happiest of the sons of man! In wine, in revel, and in joy Was softly nursed the imperial boy; His golden years, like Indian rivers, ran, And each more rapturous hour surpast The glowing rapture of the last, Even till the plenitude of bliss Did overflow and centre all in this, Happiest of the sons of man! SABARIS. Peace! peace! the king vouchsafes his gracious speech. Sit ye like statues silent! ye have quaff'd The liquid gladness of the blood-red wine, And ye have eaten of the golden fruits That the sun ripens but for kingly lips, And now ye are about to feast your ears With great Belshazzar's voice. ARIOCH. The crowded hall Suspense, and prescient of the coming joy, Is silent as the cloudless summer skies. BELSHAZZAR. Oh ye, assembled Babylon! fair youths And hoary Elders, Warriors, Councillors, And bright-eyed Women, down my festal board Reclining! oh ye thousand living men, Do ye not hold your charter'd breath from me? And I can plunge your souls in wine and joy; Or by a word, a look, dismiss you all To darkness and to shame: yet, are ye not Proud of the slavery that thus enthrals you? What king, what ruler over subject man Or was, or is, or shall be like Belshazzar? I summon from their graves the sceptred dead Of elder days, to see their shame. I cry Unto the cloudy Past, unfold the thrones That glorified the younger world: I call To the dim Future—lift thy veil and show The destined lords of humankind: they rise, They bow their veil'd heads to the dust, and own The throne whereon Chaldea's Monarch sits The height and pinnacle of human glory. Oh ancient cities, o'er whose streets the grass Is green, whose name hath wither'd from the face Of earth! Oh ye by rich o'erflowing Nile, Memphis, and hundred-gated Thebes—and thou, Assyrian Nineveh, and ye golden towers That redden o'er the Indian streams, what are ye To Babylon—Eternal Babylon! That's girt with bulwarks strong as adamant, O'er whom Euphrates' restless waves keep watch, That, like the high and everlasting Heavens, Grows old, yet not less glorious? Yes, to you I turn, oh azure-curtain'd palaces! Whose lamps are stars, whose music, the sweet motion Of your own spheres, in whom the banqueters Are Gods, nor fear my Babylonian halls Even with your splendors to compare. Bring wine! I see your souls are jocund as mine own; Pour in yon vessels of the Hebrews' God Belshazzar's beverage—pour it high. Hear, earth! Hear, Heaven! my proud defiance!—Oh, what man, What God— [The hand appears upon the wall, slowly tracing the characters, which burst out into flame. SABARIS, AND MANY VOICES. The king! the king! look to the king! ARIOCH. Where? I can see nor king nor people—nothing But a bewildering, red, and gloom-like light That swallows up the fiery canopy Of lamps. SABARIS. Hath blindness smitten thee? ARIOCH. I know not; But all things swim around me in a darkness That dazzles— SABARIS. See, his shuddering joints are loosen'd, And his knees smite each other: such a face Is seen in tombs:—what means it? ARIOCH. See'st not thou That taunted'st me but now—upon the wall— There—there—it moves— BELSHAZZAR. Oh dark and bodiless hand, What art thou—thus upon my palace wall Gliding in shadowy, slow, gigantic blackness? Lo! fiery letters, where it moves, break out: 'Tis there—'tis gone:—'tis there again—no, nought But those strange characters of flame, that burn Upon the unkindled wall:—I cannot read them— Can ye? I see your quivering lips that speak not— Sabaris—Arioch—Captains—Elders—all As pale and horror-stricken as myself! Are there no wiser? Call ye forth the Dreamers, And those that read the stars, and every priest; And he that shall interpret best shall wear The scarlet robe and chain of gold, and sit Third ruler of my realm. Away!—No—leave me not To gaze alone;—alone, on those pale signs Of destiny—the unextinguishable, The indelible—Strew, strew my couch where best I may behold what sears my burning eyeballs To gaze on—and the cold blood round my heart To stand, like snow. No—ache mine eyes, and quiver My palsied limbs—I cannot turn away— Here am I bound as by a thrice linked brass, Here, till the burthen of mine ignorance Be from my loaded soul taken off, in silence Deep as the midnight round a place of tombs. The Summit of the Temple. BENINA. How long, O Lord! how long must I endure This restlessness of danger?—I have wish'd That even the worst were come, I am so sick And weary with suspense: I have sate and gazed Upon the silent moon, as she pursued Her journey to yon blue celestial height. Pilgrim of Heaven! the white translucent clouds, Through which she wanders, fall away, nor leave A taint upon her spotless orb: Shall I, O Lord! emerge in purity as stainless From the dark clouds that dim mine earthly course? And sometimes as a whispering sound came up, Though but the voice of some light-breathing wind Along the stair, I felt my trembling heart, And I grew guilty of a timorous doubt In Him, whose guardian hand is o'er me. Hark! Hark! all around—above—beneath—it bursts, The long deep roll of—in yon cloudless skies— It cannot be God's thunder; and the fires, Blue as the sulphurous lightning, rise from earth, Not Heaven. Oh madly impious! dare ye thus Mimic the all-destroying arms that rage Against the guilty? the vast temple shakes, And all the clouded atmosphere is red With the hell-born tempest—like to rushing chariots Upon a stony way, like some vast forest Ablaze with a heaven-kindled conflagration, It comes, it comes—as in a tent of clouds, Rent at each moment by the flashing light, The gloom rolls back—it bursts. Speak!—who art thou, Whose robes are woven as from the starry Heavens? What means that sceptre, and the wreaths, like mist, That turban thy dusk brow?—I know thee now— I see it grow into a hideous likeness— Kalassan! KALASSAN. Oh most sweet humility, That doth disdain the modest palliation Of being a Deity's enforced bride; Her fond detection pierces every veil, And springs in raptures to her mortal lover. BENINA. Oh can I wonder that thou dost belie The innocent helpless virgin, when thy falsehood Aspires with frantic blasphemy t' attaint The immaculate heavens? KALASSAN. Roll on! I say,—roll on My bridal music! the ear-stunning tambour— Blaze forth my marriage fires! BENINA. Avaunt!—My cries— KALASSAN. Thy cries! Thou might'st as well, on Taurus' brow, Call to the shipman on the Caspian Sea! See'st thou how far thou art from earth? BENINA. See'st thou How near to Heaven? KALASSAN. To Heaven! behold, the stars Pierce not the cool pavilion, where soft Darkness, Our handmaid, hangs her nuptial canopy, At times illumin'd by the flashing light That loves to linger on thy kindling beauty. BENINA. 'Tis as he says!—nor sound, nor gleam of succour— Thy bride—oh, Adonijah!—ah, no bride Of thine!—lost—lost to thee—would 'twere by death! Is't for the sin of loving thee too fondly I am deserted!—Spare me, Man of Terror, And prayers for thee (they say, God loves the prayers Of the undefiled) shall rise as constantly As summer-dews at eve. KALASSAN. Now louder! louder! Let there be triumph in your martial sounds. BENINA. Oh God! oh God! I have condemn'd myself, And fallen from the faith. Ah, not for me! For thine own glory suffer not the Heathen To boast of—Ha!—all silence, and all gloom— I tremble—but he trembles too— KALASSAN. With wrath! Slaves! wherefore have ye quench'd mine earthly light, And still'd my storm? VOICE BELOW. Kalassan! KALASSAN. Slaves! VOICE. Kalassan! BENINA. Thou'rt call'd— VOICE. Kalassan! to Belshazzar's presence We are summon'd:—Priest, Diviner, Seer, thyself;— If thou delay'st, stern Arioch's sword must sever The disobedient head! BENINA. With tears, not words, I bless thee, Lord! KALASSAN. Is this thy God? BENINA. My God, In his omnipotence, doth make the wrath Of hurricanes and desolating fires His ministers—why not the breath of Kings? KALASSAN. The hour will come in which to tame thy scorn! BENINA. The hour is come that frees me from thy presence: Haste, haste— VOICE. Kalassan! KALASSAN. Slaves! I come. BENINA. Away! MANY VOICES. Kalassan! BENINA. Hark! they wait, they call, they threaten! Down! down! away or perish! KALASSAN. Fare thee well Till I return. BENINA. Till thou return'st—He's gone! I did not think that I could hear his tread, His angry tread, with such a deep delight. Oh! my fond parents! when we meet again, We shall not meet with strange, averted looks: Ye will not, in sad pity, take me back A shamed and blighted child to your cold bosoms. And thou, betroth'd, belov'd—I shall endure To stand before thy face, nor wish the earth To shroud me from thine unreproaching gaze; For were I all I fear'd, thou hadst ne'er reproach'd me; And oh, sweet Siloe! oh, my Father's land! Land where the feet may wander where they will— Land where the heart may love without a fear! I feel that I shall tread thee; for the Lord Pours not his mercies in a sparing measure. This is the earnest of his love—the seal With which he marks us for his own, his blest, His ransom'd! Oh! fair Zion, lift thou up Thy crown, that glitters to the morning Sun! They come—thy lost, thy banish'd children come— Thy ruin'd streets rise up to sounds of music! The Hall of Banquet, with the Fiery Letters on the Wall. ARIOCH. Hath the King spoken? SABARIS. Not a word: as now, He hath sate, with eyes that strive to grow familiar With those red characters of fire: but still The agony of terror hath not pass'd From his chill frame. But, if a word, a step, A motion, from those multitudes reclined Down each long festal board, the bursting string Of some shrill instrument, or even the wind, Whispering amid the plumes and shaking lamps, Disturb him—by some mute, imperious gesture, Or by his brow's stern anger, he commands All the vast Halls to silence. ARIOCH. Peace! he hears Our murmur'd speech. SABARIS. No. ARIOCH. Did ye not observe him, When his hand fell upon the all-ruling sceptre, The bitter and self-mocking laugh that pass'd O'er his pale cheek? SABARIS. His lips move, but he speaks not! All still again— ARIOCH. They are here:—The Priests and Seers; Their snowy garments sweep the Hall. SABARIS. Behold! He motions them to advance and to retreat At once—and pants, yet shudders, to demand Their answer. BELSHAZZAR. Oh! Chaldea's worshipp'd Sages— Oh! men of wisdom, that have pass'd your years— Your long, and quiet, solitary years, In tracing the dim sources of th' events That agitate this world of man—oh! ye That in the tongues of every clime discourse; Ye that hold converse with the eternal stars, And, in their calm prophetic courses, read The destinies of empires; ye whose dreams Are throng'd with the predestined images Of things that are to be; to whom the Fates Unfold their secret councils; to whose sight The darkness of Futurity withdraws, And one vast Present fills all Time—behold Yon burning characters! and read, and say Why the dark Destinies have hung their sentence Thus visible to the sight, but to the mind Unsearchable?—Ye have heard the rich reward; And I but wait to see whose neck shall wear The chain of glory— Ha! each pale fallen lip Voiceless! and each upon the other turns His wan and questioning looks.—Kalassan! thou Art like the rest, and gazest on thy fellows In blank and sullen ignorance.—Spurn them forth! Ye wise! ye learned! ye with Fate's mysteries Entrusted! Spurn, I say, and trample on them! Let them be outcast to the scorn of slaves! Let children pluck their beards, and every voice Hoot at them as they pass! Despair! Despair! This is thy palace now! No throne, no couch Beseems the King, whose doom is on his walls Emblazed—yet whose vast empire finds not one Whose faithful love can show its mystic import! Low on the dust, upon the pavement-stone, Belshazzar takes his rest!—Ye hosts of slaves, Behold your King! the Lord of Babylon!— Speak not—for he that speaks, in other words But to expound those fiery characters, Shall ne'er speak more! NITOCRIS (entering). As thou did'st give command, My son, I'm here to see the all-glorious feast That shames the earth, and copes with Heaven! Great Powers! Is't thus? Oh! look not with that mute reproach, More terrible than anger, on thy mother! Oh, pardon my rash taunts!—my son! my son! Thou art but now the beauteous, smiling child, That from my bosom drank the flowing life; By whom I've pass'd so many sleepless nights In deeper joy than slumber e'er could give! The sole refreshment of my weary spirit To gaze on thee!—Alas! 'twas all my crime:— I gave to thy young lips the mantling cup Of luxury and pride; I taught thee first That the wide earth was made for thee, and man Born for thy uses! BELSHAZZAR. Find me who will read it, And thou wilt give me, then, a life more precious Than that I once received of thee. NITOCRIS. 'Twas he; I saw him as I pass'd along the courts, The Hebrew, who when visions of the night Shook the imperial soul of Nabonassar, Like one to whom the dimly-peopled realms Of sleep were clear as the bright noontide Heavens, Spake— BELSHAZZAR. With the speed of lightning call him hither, No more, my mother—till he comes, no more. A long silent pause. ARIOCH. King of the world, he's here. BELSHAZZAR. Not yet! not yet! Delay him! hold him back!—My soul's not strung To the dire knowledge. Up the voiceless hall He moves; nor doth the white and ashen fear, That paints all faces, change one line of his. Audacious slave! walks he erect and firm, When kings are groveling on the earth?—Give place! Why do ye crowd around him? Back! I say. Is your king heard—or hath he ceased to rule? NITOCRIS. Alas! my son, fear levels kings and slaves. BELSHAZZAR. Art thou that Daniel of the Hebrew race, In whom the excellence of wisdom dwells As in the Gods? I have heard thy fame:—behold Yon mystic letters, flaming on the wall, That, in the darkness of their fateful import, Baffle the wisest of Chaldea's sages! Read, and interpret; and the satrap robe Of scarlet shall invest thy limbs; the chain Of gold adorn thy neck; and all the world Own thee third ruler of Chaldea's realm! DANIEL. Belshazzar, be thy gifts unto thyself, And thy rewards to others. I, the servant Of God, will read God's writing to the King. The Lord of Hosts to thy great Ancestor, To Nabonassar, gave the all-ruling sceptre O'er all the nations, kingdoms, languages; Lord paramount of life and death, he slew Where'er he will'd; and where he will'd men lived; His word exalted, and his word debased; And so his heart swell'd up; and, in its pride, Arose to Heaven! But then the Lord of earth Became an outcast from the sons of men— Companion of the browsing beasts! the dews Of night fell cold upon his crownless brow, And the wild asses of the desert fed Round their unenvied peer! And so he knew That God is Sovereign o'er earth's sceptred Lords. But thou, his son, unwarn'd, untaught, untamed, Belshazzar, hast arisen against the Lord, And in the vessels of his house hast quaff'd Profane libations, 'mid thy slaves and women, To gods of gold, and stone, and wood; and laugh'd The King of Kings, the God of Gods, to scorn. Now hear the words, and hear their secret meaning— “Number'd!” twice “Number'd! Weighed! Divided!” King, Thy reign is number'd, and thyself art weigh'd, And wanting in the balance, and thy realm Sever'd, and to the conquering Persian given! ARIOCH. What vengeance will he wreak? The pit of lions— The stake— BELSHAZZAR. Go—lead the Hebrew forth, array'd In the proud robe, let all the city hail The honour'd of Belshazzar. Oh! not long Will that imperial name command your awe! BELSHAZZAR, NITOCRIS. BELSHAZZAR. And ye, my bright and festal halls, whose vaults Were full of sweet sounds as the summer groves, Must ye be changed for chambers, where no tone Of music sounds, nor melody of harp, Or lute, or woman's melting voice?—My mother!— And how shall we two meet the coming ruin? In arms! thou say'st; but with what arms, to front The Invisible, that in the silent air Wars on us? Shall we seek some place of silence, Where the cold cypress shades our Fathers' tombs, And grow familiar with the abode of Death? And yet how calm, how fragrant, how serene The night!—When empires fall, and Fate thrusts down The monarchs from their ancient thrones, 'tis said, The red stars meet, with ominous, hostile fires; And the dark vault of Heaven flames all across With meteors; and the conscious earth is rock'd; And foaming rivers burst their shores! But now, Save in my soul, there is no prescient dread:— Nought but my fear-struck brow is dark and sad. All sleeps in moonlight silence: ye can wave, Oh happy gardens! in the cool night airs Your playful branches; ye can rise to Heaven, And glitter, my unconscious palace-towers; No gliding hand, no Prophet's voice to you Hath rent the veil that hides the awful future! Well, we'll go rest once more on kingly couches, My mother, and we'll wake and feel that earth Still trembles at our nod, and see the slaves Reading their fate in our imperial looks! And then—and then—Ye Gods! that I had still Nought but my shuddering and distracting fears; That those dread letters might resume once more Their dark and unintelligible brightness; Or that 'twere o'er, and I and Babylon Were—what a few short days or hours will make us! Above the City. THE DESTROYING ANGEL. The hour is come! the hour is come! With voice Heard in thy inmost soul, I summon thee, Cyrus, the Lord's anointed! And thou River, That flow'st exulting in thy proud approach To Babylon, beneath whose shadowy walls And brazen gates, and gilded palaces, And groves, that gleam with marble obelisks, Thy azure bosom shall repose, with lights Fretted and chequer'd like the starry heavens: I do arrest thee in thy stately course, By Him that pour'd thee from thine ancient fountain, And sent thee forth, even at the birth of Time, One of his holy streams, to lave the mounts Of paradise. Thou hear'st me: thou dost check Abrupt thy waters, as the Arab chief His headlong squadrons. Where the unobserved Yet toiling Persian breaks the ruining mound, I see thee gather thy tumultuous strength; And, through the deep and roaring Naharmalcha The royal canal which connected the waters of the Euphrates with the artificial lake., Roll on, as proudly conscious of fulfilling The Omnipotent command! While, far away, The lake, that slept but now so calm, nor moved Save by the rippling moonshine, heaves on high Its foaming surface, like a whirlpool gulf, And boils and whitens with the unwonted tide. But silent as thy billows used to flow, And terrible the hosts of Elam move, Winding their darksome way profound, where man Ne'er trod, nor light e'er shone, nor air from Heav'n Breathed. Oh! ye secret and unfathom'd depths, How are ye now a smooth and royal way For th' army of God's vengeance! Fellow slaves, And ministers of the Eternal purpose, Not guided by the treacherous injured sons Of Babylon, but by my mightier arm, Ye come, and spread your banners, and display Your glittering arms as ye advance, all white Beneath th' admiring moon. Come on! the gates Are open—not for banqueters in blood Like you!—I see on either side o'erflow The living deluge of arm'd men, and cry Begin, begin, with fire and sword begin The work of wrath. Upon my shadowy wings I pause and float a little while to see Mine human instruments fulfil my task Of final ruin. Then I mount, I fly, And sing my proud song, as I ride the clouds, That stars may hear, and all the hosts of worlds, That live along the interminable space, Take up Jehovah's everlasting triumph! The Streets of Babylon. ADONIJAH, IMLAH. ADONIJAH. Imlah! this way he motion'd me to pass. IMLAH. My son! (alas! I ever call thee son, Though my old childless heart but bleeds the more At that fond name), the broad Euphrates lies That way, nor boat nor bark is wont to moor By that inhospitable pier; he meant Toward the Temple—that way leads not thither. ADONIJAH. Father, the Lord will make a way, where'er His prophets do direct our feet. Thou saw'st not As I; they led him at the king's command Along the streets, in scarlet clad, and made Their trumpets clamour, and their voices shout Before great Daniel; but it seem'd he mark'd Nor trumpet sound, nor voice of man: the garb, Th' array, the triumph touch'd not him: he held A strange, elate, and voiceless intercourse With some dark being in the clouds; for now I saw him, as the torches shone upon him— His brow like some crown'd warrior's, when his hosts Are spreading, in their arm'd magnificence, Over a conquer'd realm; and now he seem'd To count impatient the slow time; and now He look'd, where in the distant darkness rose The Temple, now where still the palace shone With its rich festal light, as though he watch'd And listen'd for some earthquake to o'erthrow them. His ominous looks were terrible with ruin; The majesty of God's triumphant vengeance Was in his tread: even thus the Patriarch look'd, When, mounting in his ark, he saw the deluge Come sweeping o'er the doom'd yet heedless world. Something, be sure, the hand of God prepares To rescue, to revenge. IMLAH. Too late! too late! Oh if last night! ADONIJAH. My father! IMLAH. Thou art right; 'Twas rashly, madly spoken—but my spirit Is wrung almost to find a deadly pleasure In madly uttering what the heart abhors. I'll on with thee. ADONIJAH. He motion'd me alone. IMLAH. He did—and he must be obey'd: farewell, Dear youth—dear son! if thou should'st meet with her Cast forth in scorn, and groveling on the earth, Chide her not, Adonijah—speak not to her, Lest thy compassion seem to mock her shame: But, pray thee, lead her to the old man's home— To the old man's heart, that will not love her less, Though his love have less of pride and more of sorrow Farewell, and prosper! I'll go wander on Through the dusk streets. Poor Naomi! I left thee, Thy wretchedness had wrought its own relief, Asleep. Oh thou, if thou should'st never wake, Thrice bless'd. Beloved, I should mourn for thee, But envy while I mourn'd. Great King of vengeance, God of my fathers! thou art here at length. Behold! behold! from every street the flames Burst out, and armed men, proud conquering men, Move, in the blaze they've kindled, to destroy. Are ye the avenging Spirits of the Lord Descended on the blast, and clouding o'er The Heavens, as ye come down, with that red cope Deeper than lightning? No—it is the Mede, The ravaging, the slaughtering, merciless Mede. This way they fly, with shrieks, and clashing arms, And multitudes that choke th' impassable streets, Till the fierce conqueror hew his ruthless way. Shall not I fly? and wherefore? Oh! waste on, And burn, triumphant stranger! trample down Master and slave alike!—there is one house Thou canst not make more desolate: thou canst not Pour ills on any of these guilty roofs, So hateful as have burst on mine.—Who comes? NITOCRIS, IMLAH. NITOCRIS. My son! my son! I heard the cries—I saw The flames; I rush'd through all the shrieking palace To seek him—and I found him not; and sprang To find him, where, I thought not, where, I knew not. One moment do I plunge within the gloom Of some dark court, to shun the foe—the next, I bless the angry and destroying light, Because I think it may disclose the face, The beauteous face of mine Imperial Boy. I've pass'd by widows, and by frantic mothers, That howl and tear their hair o'er their dead children: I cannot find my child, even to perform That last sad duty of my love—to mourn him. I've cried aloud, and told them I'm their queen; They gaze on me, and mock me with their pity, Showing that queens can be as desolate As slaves: and sometimes have I paused and stoop'd O'er dying faces, with a hideous hope Of seeing my son! I dare not cry Belshazzar, Lest he should hear me, and come forth and meet The slaughtering sword. Ye Gods! his very beauty And majesty will mark him out for slaughter: And the fierce Persian, that in weary pride May scorn to flesh his sword on meaner heads, Will win himself an everlasting glory, By slaying th' unarm'd, the succourless Belshazzar. Here's one—hast seen him? Slave, I'll give thee gold, I'll give thee kingdoms—ah! what gold and kingdoms Hath the sad queen of captive Babylon To give? but thou hast haply known the love That parents bear to those who have been a part Of their own selves; whose lives are twined with theirs So subtly, that 'twere worse than death to part them. Hast seen the king—my son—the pride of kings— My peerless son? IMLAH. I had a child this morn, Beautiful as the doe upon the mountains, Pure as the crystal of the brook she drinks; And when they rent her from her father's heart, To death—oh no!—to deeper woe than death, The queen of Babylon swept proudly by, Nor stoop'd to waste her pity on the childless. NITOCRIS. O ye just Gods! but cruel in your justice! And never met ye more? IMLAH. No more! NITOCRIS. Great Heaven! I own your equal hand: the bitter chalice That we have given to others' lips, our own Must to the dregs drink out. So, never more Shall I behold thee—not to wind thy corpse— To pour sweet ointments on thy clay-cold limbs. Alas! and what did Nabonassar's daughter In the dark streets alone? when there were men To rally, arms to array—my voice, my look, The hereditary terror that is said To dwell on mine imperial brow, had pour'd Dismay and flight upon the conquering Mede, Semiramis, for empire, cast away The woman, and went forth in brazen arms. I could not for my son! My naked feet Bleed where I move; and on my crownless head (For what have I to do with crowns?) beat cold The chilling elements; till but now I felt not My loose, and thin, and insufficient raiment. Well, there's enough to shroud the dead; and thee To colder nakedness, my son! my son! The spoiler will have stripp'd.— IMLAH. God pardon me For taunting her distress! Rest here, oh queen! Under this low and wretched roof thou art safe; The plunderer wars upon the gilded palace, Not the base hovel. There's a mother there As sad as thou, and sleep may be as merciful To thee as her. NITOCRIS. Sleep! sleep! with Babylon In flames around me; Nabonassar's realm, The city of earth's sovereigns rushing down, The pride of countless ages, and the glory, By generations of triumphant kings Rear'd up—my sire's, my husband's, and my son's, And mine own stately birth-place perishing: The summer gardens of my joy cut down; The ivory chambers of my luxury, Where I was wed, and bore my beauteous son, Howl'd through by strangers! No—I'll on, and find Death or my son, or both! My glorious city! My old ancestral throne! thou'lt still afford A burial fire. I've lived a queen, the daughter Of kings, the wife, the mother—and will die Queen-like, with Babylon my funeral pile! Before the Temple. BENINA. Oh thou dread night! what new and awful signs Crowd thy portentous hours, so calm in heav'n, With all thy stars and full-orb'd moon serene Sleeping on crystal and pellucid clouds! How terrible on earth! as I rush'd down The vacant stair, nor heard a living sound, Save mine own bounding footstep, all at once Methought Euphrates' rolling waters sank Into the earth; the gilded galleys rock'd, And plunged and settled in the sandy depths; And the tall bridge upon its lengthening pier Seem'd to bestride a dark, unfathom'd gulf. There, where blue waters and the ivory decks Of royal vessels, and their silver prows, Reflected the bright lights of heav'n, they shone Upon the glancing armour, helms, and spears Of a vast army: then the stone-paved walls Rang with the weight of chariots, and the gates Of brass fell down with ponderous clang: then sank O'er the vast city one sepulchral silence, As though the wondering conqueror scarce believed His easy triumph. But ye revellers That lay at rest upon your festal garments, The pleasant weariness of wine and joy, And the sweet dreams of your scarce-ended pleasures, Still hanging o'er your silken couches! ye Woke only, if ye woke indeed, to see The Median scimitar that, red with blood, Flash'd o'er you, or the blaze of fire that wrapt In sulphurous folds the chambers of your rest. Oh Lord of Hosts! in thine avenging hour How dreadful art thou! Pardon if I weep When all my grateful heart should beat with joy For my deliverance. KALASSAN, BENINA. KALASSAN. All is lost! Great Bel, Thus, thus dost thou avenge thy broken rite! Now, by thy thunders, 'tis the beauteous bride— Thou givest her to me yet. BENINA. Miscreant! what mean'st thou? KALASSAN. 'Twas love before; and now 'tis love and vengeance; And I will quaff the doubly-mantling cup, In all its richness. BENINA. Guilty man! look around, Thou see'st my God, the God of Gods, reveal'd In yon wide fires! Nor thou, nor one of those That walk the death-doom'd streets of Babylon, Hath even an hour to live. KALASSAN. Then I've no hour To waste. 'Tis said the Indian widows mount In pride and joy their husbands' funeral pyres; Thou, in thy deep devotion, shalt excel them, And wed thy bridegroom for the loftier glory Of dying by his side. BENINA. Oh mercy! KALASSAN. Mercy! Ask of the Babylonian maids and wives If they find mercy? BENINA. Ah! and I presumed To speak of pitying others! KALASSAN. Come—What's here? KALASSAN, BENINA, ADONIJAH. ADONIJAH. With unwet foot I trod the river depths: It is the privilege of Israel's sons To walk through seas as on dry land. BENINA. Oh stranger! That bear'st a Persian scimitar—No stranger! Is it his angel, with his beauteous brow— His eyes, his voice—his clasping arms around me?— Mine own, my brave, my noble Adonijah! Too bounteous Heaven! KALASSAN. Fond slave! unclasp thine arms. ADONIJAH. What—must I rob the Persian of his victim? Oh! not in vain this bright and welcome steel Glitter'd to court my grasp! What! the first foe My warrior arm hath met, retreat before me? I'll follow thee to earth's remotest verge. BENINA. Oh! I could shriek, and weary Heaven with cries For my sad self—for thee—for thee! My lips Are parch'd to silence; and my throat—Come back! Their swords clash—some one falls—and groans:—he calls not Upon the God of Israel.—Ha! perchance He cannot cry! All's dark.—Ah me! how strong, How dreadful was the Heathen in his strength! He's here!—I dare not ask, which art thou? which— Alas, prophetic spirit, hast thou left me To ask? 'Mong thousands, Love! thou us'dst to know His tread— ADONIJAH. Where art thou, Sweet? BENINA. Here—on thy bosom. ADONIJAH. The Lord hath triumph'd by his servant's hands: He lies in death, blaspheming his own Gods. BENINA. Merciful! I almost thank thee for the dread And danger of this night, that closes thus In such o'erpowering joy! ADONIJAH. Hast suffer'd nought But dread and danger? BENINA. What? ADONIJAH. Thou'st been where evil Riots uncheck'd, untamed! BENINA. Oh Adonijah! I have endured thy lip upon my cheek, And I endure thine arms clasp'd fondly round me. And on thy bosom I recline, and look Upon thy face with eyes suffused with tears, But not of shame. What would'st thou more? ADONIJAH. Nought, nought. Oh pardon that my jealous fears misdoubted Thy pure, thy proud, thy holy love! Come on! Come to thy parents' home that wait for thee, And change the voiceless house of desolation To an abode of joy, as mute. Come! come! Beauteous as her that with her timbrel pass'd Along the Red Sea depths, and cast her song Upon the free airs of the wilderness— The song of joy, of triumph, of deliverance! The Streets of Babylon in Flames. BELSHAZZAR. I cannot fight nor fly: where'er I move, On shadowy battlement, or cloud of smoke, That dark unbodied hand waves to and fro, And marshals me the way to death—to death That still eludes me. Every blazing wall Breaks out in those red characters of fate; And when I raised my sword to war, methought That dark-stoled Prophet stood between, and seemed Rebuking Heaven for its slow consummation Of his dire words. I am alone: my slaves Fled at the first wild outcry; and my women Closed all their doors against me—for they knew me Mark'd with the seal of destiny: no hand, Though I have sued for water, holds a cup To my parch'd lips; no voice, as I pass on, Hath bless'd me; from the very festal garments, That glitter'd in my halls, they shake the dust: Ev'n the priests spurn'd me, as abhorr'd of Heaven. Oh! but the fiery Mede doth well avenge me! They're strew'd beneath my feet—though not in worship! Oh death! death! death! that art so swift to seize The conqueror on his triumph day, the bride Ere yet the wedding lamps have waned, the king While all mankind are kneeling at his footstool— Thou'rt only slow to him that knows himself Thy fated prey, that seeks within the tomb A dark retreat from wretchedness and shame. From shame!—the heir of Nabonassar's glory! From wretchedness!—the Lord of Babylon— Of golden and luxurious Babylon! Alas! through burning Babylon! the fallen, The city of lamentation and of slaughter! A fugitive and outcast, that can find, Of all his realm, not even a grave!—so base, That even the conquering Mede disdains to slay him! Before the House of Imlah. IMLAH, ADONIJAH, BENINA, NAOMI. IMLAH. Naomi! Naomi! look forth—she's here! NAOMI. I know she is—in dreams: through all the night I've seen her, gliding from the fountain side With the pure urn of water, or with lips Apart, and bashful voice, that faintly breath'd One of her country's songs! I've seen her kneeling In prayer, alas! that ne'er was heard on high! And thou hast scared my vision's joys away— To see—all heav'n on fire, and the vast city— Imlah! what mean those massy clouds of smoke, Those shrieks and clashings?—and—that youth and maid, Why stand they there? we need no sad remembrancers Of our deep desolation! BENINA. Doth my mother With such sad salutation welcome home Her child? NAOMI. No! no! ye can no more delude me! Twice have I woken, and heard that voice, and stretch'd My arms— BENINA. But hast not folded to thy bosom, As thus, thy child, thy lost, thy loved Benina! NAOMI. 'Tis living flesh! it is a breathing lip! And the heart swells like—Oh no!—not like mine! Oh! thou twice born! the sorrow and the joy, Which I endured to bring my beauteous babe Into the world, were nought to this! BENINA. Dear mother, May I ne'er cost thee bitterer tears than these! IMLAH. My father's God, thou show'dst thyself of old, By smiting water from the stony rock, And raining manna on the desert sands! Here is thy best—most gracious miracle! Making the childless heart to laugh with gladness; The eyes, that had forgot to weep, o'erflow With tears delicious! Thou hast rais'd the dead, And to the widow given her breathless child See 1 Kings xvii. 17, 21. I make this reference because a poetical critic, very profound in biblical history, supposed that, by a trifling anachronism, I alluded to our Saviour and the Widow of Nain. I have altered one word, to preclude similar misapprehension.! But what was that pale boy to her that stands So beautiful before us? What was death To her dark trial? And she's here—and life Bounds in her bosom—the young doves that erst, Ere yet the cold airs soil'd their snowy plumes, Were offer'd in thy Temple, not so pure! NAOMI. How cam'st thou hither? BENINA. Ask of him that led me— Of him—whom all but I seem to have forgotten. ADONIJAH. Love, I shall take a sweet revenge hereafter, Resuming to myself the boon that now They have no time to thank me for.—What's he, That rushes where proud War disdains to spoil? That tread was wont to move in marble halls, To sounds of music. Round his limbs, that shake And quiver, as with pain, he wraps his robes, Like one men wont to gaze on. Even despair On such a brow looks noble!—Hark! he speaks— THE ABOVE, BELSHAZZAR. BELSHAZZAR. 'Tis come at last! the barbed arrow drinks My life-blood. 'Mid the base abode of slaves I seem to stand: not here—my fathers set Like suns in glory! I'll not perish here, And stifle like some vile, forgotten lamp! Oh, dreadful God! is't not enough?—My state I equall'd with the Heavens—and wilt thou trample me Beneath these—What are ye that crowd around me? I have a dim remembrance of your forms And voices. Are ye not the slaves that stood This morn before me? and— IMLAH. Thou spurn'dst us from thee. BELSHAZZAR. And ye'll revenge you on the clay-cold corpse. IMLAH. Fear not: our God, and this world's cruel usage, Have taught us early, what kings learn too late. BELSHAZZAR. Ye know me, then—ye know the King of Babylon— The king of dust and ashes? for what else Is now the beauteous city—earth's delight? And what the King himself but—dust and ashes? BENINA. He faints—support him, dearest Adonijah! BELSHAZZAR. Mine eyes are heavy, and a swoon, a sleep, Swims o'er my head:—go, summon me the lutes, That used to soothe me to my balmiest slumbers; And bid the snowy-handed maidens fan The dull, hot air around me. 'Tis not well— This bed—'tis hard and damp. I gave command I would not lie but on the softest plumes That the birds bear. Slaves! hear ye not?—'tis cold— 'Tis piercing cold! BENINA. Alas! he's little used To feel the night winds on his naked brow: He's breathing still—spread o'er him that bright mantle; A strange, sad use for robes of sovereignty. THE ABOVE, NITOCRIS. NITOCRIS. Why should I pass street after street, through flames That make the hardy conqueror shrink; and stride O'er heaps of dying, that look up and wonder To see a living and unwounded being? Oh! mercifully cruel, they do slay The child and mother with one blow! the bride And bridegroom! I alone am spared, to die Remote from all—from him with whose cold ashes To mingle mine, a desperate hope I've cherish'd. 'Tis all the daughter of great Nabonassar Hath now to ask!—I'll sit me down and listen, And through that turbulent din of clattering steel, And cries of murder'd men, and smouldering houses, And th' answering trumpets of the Mede and Persian, Summoning their bands to some new work of slaughter, Anon one universal cry of triumph Will burst; and all the city, either host, In mute and breathless admiration, lie To hear the o'erpowering clamour that announces Belshazzar slain!—and then I'll rise and rush To that dread place—they'll let me weep or die Upon his corpse!—Old man, thou'st found thy child. IMLAH. I have—I have—and thine! Oh! rise not thus, In thy majestic joy, as though to mount Earth's throne again. Behold the King! NITOCRIS. My son! On the cold earth—not there, but on my bosom— Alas! that's colder still. My beauteous boy, Look up and see— BELSHAZZAR. I can see nought—all's darkness! NITOCRIS. Too true: he'll die, and will not know me! Son! Thy mother speaks—thy only kindred flesh, That lov'd thee ere thou wert; and, when thou'rt gone, Will love thee still the more! BELSHAZZAR. Have dying kings Lovers or kindred? Hence! disturb me not. NITOCRIS. Shall I disturb thee, crouching by thy side To die with thee? Oh! how he used to turn And nestle his young cheek in this full bosom, That now he shrinks from! No! it is the last Convulsive shudder of cold death. My son, Wait—wait, and I will die with thee—not yet— Alas! yet this was what I pray'd for—this— To kiss thy cold cheek, and inhale thy last— Thy dying breath. IMLAH. Behold! behold, they rise; Feebly they stand, by their united strength Supported. Hath yon kindling of the darkness, Yon blaze, that seems as if the earth and heaven Were mingled in one ghastly funeral pile, Arous'd them? Lo, the flames, like a gorg'd serpent, That slept in glittering but scarce-moving folds, Now, having sprung a nobler prey, break out In tenfold rage. ADONIJAH. How like a lioness, Robb'd of her kingly brood, she glares! She wipes From her wan brow the grey discolour'd locks, Where used to gleam Assyria's diadem; And now and then her tenderest glance recurs To him that closer to her bleeding heart She clasps, as self-reproachful that aught earthly Distracts her from her one maternal care. IMLAH. More pale, and more intent, he looks abroad Into the ruin, as though he felt a pride Even in the splendor of the desolation! BELSHAZZAR. The hand—the unbodied hand—it moves—look there! Look where it points!—my beautiful palace— NITOCRIS. Look— The Temple of great Bel— BELSHAZZAR. Our halls of joy! NITOCRIS. Earth's pride and wonder! IMLAH. Ay, o'er both the fire Mounts like a conqueror: here, o'er spacious courts, And avenues of pillars, and long roofs, From which red streams of molten gold pour down, It spreads, till all, like those vast fabrics, seem Built of the rich clouds round the setting sun— All the wide heavens, one bright and shadowy palace! But terrible here—th' Almighty's wrathful hand Everywhere manifest!—There the Temple stands, Tower above tower, one pyramid of flame; To which those kingly sepulchres by Nile Were but as hillocks to vast Caucasus! Aloof, the wreck of Nimrod's impious tower Alone is dark; and something like a cloud, But gloomier, hovers o'er it. All is mute: Man's cries, and clashing steel, and braying trumpet— The only sound the rushing noise of fire! Now, hark! the universal crash—at once They fall—they sink— ADONIJAH. And so do those that rul'd them! The Palace, and the Temple, and the race Of Nabonassar, are at once extinct! Babylon and her kings are fallen for ever! IMLAH. Without a cry, without a groan, behold them, Th' Imperial mother and earth-ruling son Stretch'd out in death! Nor she without a gleam Of joy expiring with her cheek on his: Nor he unconscious that with him the pride And terror of the world is fallen—th' abode And throne of universal empire—now A plain of ashes round the tombless dead!— Oh, God of hosts! Almighty, Everlasting! God of our Fathers, thou alone art great! END OF VOL. I.</field>

Beauteous Isle, And plenteous! what though in thy atmosphere Float not the taintless luxury of light, The dazzling azure of the Southern skies; Around thee the rich orb of thy renown Spreads stainless, and unsullied by a cloud. Though thy hills blush not with the purple vine, And softer climes excel thee in the hue And fragrance of thy summer fruits and flowers; Nor flow thy rivers over golden beds; Thou in the Soul of man, thy better wealth, Art richest; nature's noblest produce thou, The immortal Mind in perfect height and strength, Bearest with lavish opulence; this thy right, Thy privilege of climate and of soil, Would I assert: nor, save thy fame, invoke, Or Nymph, or Muse, that oft 'twas dream'd of old By falls of waters under haunted shades Her ecstasy of inspiration pour'd O'er Poet's soul, and flooded all his powers With liquid glory: so may thy renown Burn in my heart, and give to thought and word The aspiring and the radiant hue of fire. Forth from the gates of Troynovant The legendary and romantic name of London. hath pass'd King Vortigern; the Princes of the Isle Around him; on the walls, for then (though now Boundless her mighty wilderness of streets, Spreads in magnificence of multitude And vast illimitable grandeur) walls With jealous circuit and embattled range Girt Britain's narrow Capital; where swarm'd Eager her wondering citizens to see The Monarch. Him the Saxon Hengist met, And Horsa, with their bands in triumph led, As from a recent victory; their blue eyes Sparkled, and proud they shook their saffron hair, And o'er the bickering of their spears, the toss Of ponderous mallets, the quick flash of swords, Th' emblazon'd White Horse on their banners waved Triumphant. Thus King Vortigern began: “Welcome, Deliverers! of our kingdom's foes Thrice-honour'd Conquerors, welcome! never more Shall painted Caledonian o'er our realm The chariots of his rapine wheel, so full The desolation, havoc so complete Hath smote and blasted in Erle Hengist's path. The mouldering ruins of our Roman wall, Leagued with the terror of the Saxon name, Shall be defence more mighty, than when soared Its battlements unbroken, and above Th' imperial Eagle shook its wings of gold. Oh, toil'd with victory, burthen'd with renown, For you our baths float cool and clear, our air Is redolent with garland wreaths, and rich Within our royal citadel is crown'd For you the banquet; welcome once again, Mighty to save, and potent to defend!”— A faint acclaim, a feeble sullen din Ensued, with less of gladness than fierce grief, And wrath ill stifled. Seeming all unmoved, Elate the Monarch onward led the way; Slow follow'd Saxon Hengist's martial train, Clashing their armour loud, as though to daunt All Britain with the clamour. Th' island Chiefs Behind them march'd; and save some restless hands Were busy with their sheathed swords, they mov'd Silent, and cold, and gloomy, as a range Of mountain pines, when cloudy lowers the storm. Upon the azure bosom of the Thames Reclining with its ponderous mass of shade, Arose the royal Citadel, the work Of the great Cæsar. The foundation of the Tower of London, by Cæsar— “Ye towers of Julius, London's lasting shame.” —Gray. Holinshed, quoting Hector Boece, says, Now when he (Vortigern) with treason, fraud, and great deceit, at length obtained that for which he had long looked, he first of all furnished the Tower of London with a strong garrison of men of warre. —Book v. c. 2. He the Lord of Rome, Of Rome, earth's mistress; yet 'gainst savage foes Vantage of trench and tower and massy wall Scorn'd not; so swift, so perilous, so fierce Cassivelan Cassivelaunus, the King of Britain, opposed to Julius Cæsar. his painted charioteers Whirl'd to the frantic onset, standing forth Portent of freedom mid a world enslav'd. They pass'd the portal arch; the sumptuous hall Flung back its gates; around the banquet board Rang'd Prince and Chieftain, where luxurious art Shower'd prodigal her dainties; poisons sweet; And baleful splendour! Fierce the Saxon gaz'd On goblet, and huge charger carv'd in gold, Contemptuous wonder. But the monarch's brow Grew lighter, as with greedy joy he quaff'd Oblivious bliss; thus still the guilty soul Wooes frenzy, and, voluptuous from despair, Forgets itself to pleasure. High aloof, Each in his azure robe, the band of Bards Mingled the wanton luxuries of sound; Gentle melodious languor, melting fall, With faint effeminate flattery beguil'd The soul of manhood. Silent veil'd his harp White-haired Aneurin, and indignant tears Stood in the old man's eye, for wrathful shame To hear his godlike and heaven-breathing art Pampering loose revels with obsequious chime. Then rose the glorious madness; forth he sprung, And with one stroke along the clashing chords Won silence deep as of a summer eve After a noontide storm; his silver locks Wav'd proud, the kindling frenzy of his eye Flash'd triumph, as the song of Chariots rose. The song that o'er the van of battle shower'd Pale horror, when that scourg'd Icenian Queen Through the square legions drove her car; were heard Her brazen wheels to madden, the keen scythes Gride through their iron harvest; then rush'd route, Wail'd havoc, while Bonduca Boadicea, in Fletcher's play she is called Bonduca. fiercer urg'd The trampling steeds; behind her silence sank Along the dreary path of her revenge. Ceas'd the bold strain, then deep the Saxon drain'd The ruddy cup, and savage joy uncouth Lit his blue gleaming eyes: nor sate unmov'd The Briton Chiefs; fierce thoughts began to rise Of ancient wars, and high ancestral fame. Sudden came floating through the hall an air So strangely sweet, the o'erwrought sense scarce felt Its rich excess of pleasure; softer sounds Melt never on the enchanted midnight cool, By haunted spring, where elfin dancers trace Green circlets on the moonlight dews; nor lull Becalmed mariner from rocks, where basks At summer noon the Sea-maid; he his oar Breathless suspends, and motionless his bark Sleeps on the sleeping waters. Now the notes So gently died away, the silence seem'd Melodious; merry now and light and blithe They danced on air. Anon came tripping forth In frolic grace a maiden troop, their locks Flower-wreath'd, their snowy robes from their clasp'd zones Fell careless drooping; quick their glittering feet Glanc'd o'er the pavement. Then the pomp of sound Swell'd up, and mounted; as the stately swan, Her milk-white neck embower'd in arching spray, Queens it along the waters, up the hall Advanced a shape, so wondrous fair, she lull'd The music into silence, yet herself Prolong'd th' undying sense of sweetest sounds. Her grace of motion and of look, the smooth And swimming majesty of step and tread, The symmetry of form and feature, set The soul afloat, even like delicious airs Of flute or harp: as though she trod from earth, And round her wore an emanating cloud Of harmony, the Lady mov'd. Too proud For less than absolute command, too soft For aught but gentle amorous thought: her hair Cluster'd, as 'twere an orb of gold, cast out A dazzling and o'erpowering radiance, save Here and there on her snowy neck repos'd In milder brilliance some thin wandering tress. The azure of her flashing eye was fring'd With virgin meekness, and her tread, that seem'd Earth to disdain, as softly fell on it As the light dew-shower on a tuft of flowers. The soul within seem'd feasting on high thoughts, That to the outward form and feature gave A loveliness of scorn. Her harbingers, As she advanced, fell back, their modest eyes Downcast, and drooping low their slender necks In graceful reverence: she, by wond'ring gaze Unmoved, and stifled murmurs of applause, Nor yet unconscious, slowly won her way To where the King, amid the festal pomp, Sate loftiest; as she rais'd a fair-chas'd cup, A great supper therefore was prepared by Hengist, at the which it pleased the king to be present, and appointed his daughter, when everie man began to be somewhat merrie with drinke, to bring in a cup of gold full of good and pleasant wine, and to present it to the king, saieng, Wassail. Which she did in such comely and decent manner, as she that knew how to doo it well ineugh. So as the king marvelled greatlie thereat, and not understanding what she meant by that salutation, demanded what it signified. To whom it was answered by Hengist, that she wished him well, and the meaning of it was, that he should drink affter her, thereto forming this answer, Drinke, haile. Whereupon the king, as he was informed, tooke the cup at the damsels hand and drunke. Finallie this young ladie behaved herself with such pleasant words, comelie countenance, and amiable grace, that the king beheld her so long, till he felt himself so farre in love with her person, that he burned in continuall desire to enjoy the same; insomuch, that shortlie after he forsooke his own wife, by whom he had three sones, Vortimerus, Catagrinus, and Pascentius, and required of Hengist to have his daughter, the said Rowen or Rowena in marriage ? and so the marriage was concluded and solemnised; all Kent being assigned unto Hengist in reward, the which countrie was before that governed by one Guorongus (though not with most equall justice), which Guorongus was subject unto Vortigern, as all other the potentats of the Ile were. —Holinshed, b. v. c. 3. Something of sweet confusion overspread Her features; something tremulous broke in On her half-failing accents, as she said, “Health to the King!”—the sparkling wine laugh'd up, As eager 'twere to touch so fair a lip. A moment, and the apparition bright Had parted; as before, the sound of harps Was wantoning about the festive hall. As one just waking from a blissful dream Nor moves, nor breathes, lest breath or motion break The soft enchantment, that hath all entranc'd His fancy, sate King Vortigern. “Whence came, And whither went she? of what race and stem Sprang this bright wonder of our earth, that leaves The rapture of her presence in our hall, Though parted thence too swiftly?”—“King (replied Erle Hengist)—in our ancient Saxon faith, Ill bodes the joyless feast, where maiden's lips Pledge not the wassail goblet.”—“By my soul,” Cried Vortigern, “a gallant faith! and I Discredit not such omen sweet; the health Those smooth lips wish'd me, well those lips might give, A fragrance and a sparkling have they left Even on the wine they touch'd.” He said, and press'd The goblet to his own. “A father's ear, King Vortigern, must love the flattering tongue That descants thus upon his daughter's praise.”— “Thy daughter? Saxon!”—“Mine, though vaunt not I Her beauty, many a German Erle and King Hath vow'd at his life's peril to proclaim Her far surpassing comeliness.”—None heard The secret converse that ensued. Anon Rose Vortigern, and from his brow transferred A coronet of radiant Eastern gems To the white hair of Hengist, and drank off A brimming cup, and cried, “To Kent's high King, A health, a health to Vortigern's fair bride, The golden-hair'd Rowena.”—All at once Each Saxon seiz'd the exulting strain, and struck The wine-drain'd goblet down, “Health, King of Kent!” As mid the fabled Libyan bridal stood Perseus, in stern tranquillity of wrath, Half stood, half floated on his ankle plumes Out-swelling, while the bright face on his shield Look'd into stone the raging fray; Ovid. Metamorphos. lib. iv.—I do not believe that I had seen even a cast of Canova's statue when this was written; but it perhaps resembles the statue more than the passage of Ovid, on which it was grounded, rather than imitated. so rose, But with no magic arms, wearing alone Th' appalling and control of his firm look, The solemn indignation of his brow, The Briton Samor; at his rising, awe Went forth, and all the riotous hall was mute; But like unruffled summer waters flow'd His speech, and courtly reverence smooth'd its tone. “Sovereign of Britain's Sovereigns! The political state of Britain at this period, after the final retirement of the Roman forces, is not very clearly known. “At length the connexion between Britain and Rome was entirely severed. Britain broke, as it were, into various independent and rival communities.” —Palgrave's History of England, p. 29. of our crowns The highest! in our realm of many thrones Enthron'd the loftiest! mighty as thou art, Thou dost outstep thy amplitude of sway; Thine is our isle to govern: not to give. A free and sacred property hast thou In our allegiance; but a master's right Over our lives, our princedoms, and our souls— King Vortigern, as well mayst thou presume To a dominion o'er our winds, to set Thy stamp and impress on our light from heaven. This Britain cannot rest beneath the shade Of Saxon empire, this our Christian soil The harvest of obedience will not bear To Heathen sway; and hear me, Vortigern, The golden image that thou settest up, Like the pride-drunken Babylonian king, Though dulcimer and psaltery soothe us down To shameful patience, and submission tame, We will not worship.”—From the hall he pass'd Thus saying. Him the Island's brave and proud Follow'd, the high and fame-enamour'd souls, Never to Britain wanting, though in hours Loosest of revels soft, and wanton ease. But Vortigern, more largely pouring in The vine's delicious poison, sate, and cried, “Whom the flax binds not, must the iron gyve, Whom sceptres daunt not, must the sword control.” Evening fell gentle, and the brilliant sun Was going down into the waveless Thames, As bearing light and warmth to his cold Nymphs Within their crystal chambers, when the King Left the hall of banquet. Lofty and alone, Even as the Pillar great Alcides set, The limit of the world and his renown, On Calpe, round whose shaft the daylight left Its last empurpling; on the battlements Stood Samor, in the amethystine light, And “Sink in darkness, thou majestic orb! To-morrow shall the nations bask again In thy full glory.”—Thus he said, and turn'd To where the King went hurrying by.—“And thou, Thou to thy setting hastest, never more Thy lost benighted splendour to renew; Late at thy noon of pride, now fall'n, declin'd For ever from thy fair meridian, go Into thy cloudy rest!”—The solemn tone Of his deep voice seiz'd on the King, as frosts Arrest the rapid flowing stream.—“What means The Sovereign of the Vales I imagined Samor the king of the Dobuni, the inhabitants of the beautiful Gloucestershire valleys., even in my halls, And on my castle battlements, to cast Bold scorn on Britain's King? Ingrate and blind, When I the valiant Saxon have brought in To check the Caledonian, through your isle Marching amid the light of burning towns; Ye, wedded to your sorrow and your shame, Mock at the safety my free love provides.”— “Ah, provident! ah, sage! ah, generous King! That sets the ravening wolf to dog the flock; The hawk to guard the dovecote.”—“Wisest chief, I thank thee for thy phrase: doves are ye, doves That fly with piteous and imploring speed Before the Scottish kites, that swoop your nests, And flesh their greedy talons in your young.”— “Monarch! the eaglet, were it smoothly nurst In the dove's downy nest, at its first flight Would shrink down dazzled from the morning sun; But with strong plumes refresh'd, anon 'twould claim Its old aspiring birthright, and unblench'd Bathe in the splendour of his noontide fire. Oh, we have slumber'd on soft luxury's lap To her loose tabret; but, misjudging King! Britain is like her soil; above, the turf Lies velvet smooth, hard iron lurks beneath. I know the northern Pagans waste our land; And the tame mission to the Roman sent I know, ‘The fierce Barbarian to the sea Drives us, the sea to the Barbarian back Merciless’: so ran the plaintive legend. See the Letter, taken from Gildas, in Hume. True! But soldiers would it cast us back; despair Hath its own valour; war makes warriors. King! Calamities are on us, evil days O'er our isle darken, but the noble wear Disaster, as an Angel wears his wings, To elevate and glorify. Nor us Alone the enveloping gloom o'ershrouds, the frame And fabric of our world is breaking up. Rome's dome of empire, that o'ervaulted earth With its capacious shadow, rent and split, Disorders the smooth course of human things, Leaving confusion lord of this wide ball, While to and fro the Nations roll and plunge Like a tempestuous sea. Oh, mid such wreck, T' uphold our free and independent land, On every side 'gainst gathering foes to rear A rampire of hard steel, or firmer far, The bulwark of a high undaunted spirit, From her thron'd Sovereign to her humblest sons, This were a theme for Heaven's immortal harps. So He whose sceptre glitters in thy grasp, He the Deliverer, the Defender nam'd, So Constantine had done, had the high Soul's bane, Ambition, never madden'd him t' usurp The purple, madly worn, yet nobly lost On the sad plain by Arles.” See the Preface.—“I knew full well 'Twould come to this, that Constantine would end The high-wrought orat'ry. I am amused at finding in Sir F. Palgrave's History a sort of resemblance to traditions which I picked up, I scarcely know where, in our old writers:—“As far as we can judge, two great parties prevailed in the southern tracts of our island. A Roman party, headed by Aurelius Ambrosius, a chieftain of imperial descent, who claimed or acquired the imperial dignity; and another, supporting the cause of the too famous Vortigern.”—Page 29. I did not expect to find myself so near to authentic history. On the other hand my friend, Sir Francis, seems inclined to resolve into poetry much of that which my authorities, the old chroniclers, relate as grave history. Of the whole story of Vortigern and Rowena, of Hengist and Horsa, he thus writes, as a disciple of Niebuhr's historical school:—“I conceive (these details) bear no nearer relation to the real history of Anglo-Saxon England, than the story of Æneas, as related by Virgil, does to the real history of the foundation of Rome. We may seek for the groundwork of the narrative in the historical ballads of the Anglo-Saxons, in which their early enterprises were commemorated. And even the names of Hengist and Horsa seem only to be epithets derived from their standard, the snow-white Steed, which still appears as the ensign of Kent, in England, as it anciently did in the shield of the ‘Old Saxons,’ in Germany.” Yet, with due deference to our learned antiquarian, are not most of these British, rather than Anglo-Saxon, traditions? This too I know, And this I tell thee, Samor! nor yet add Rebel! thy secret commerce with his sons, To undermine my rightful throne; the right, So babble ye in your licentious phrase, Conferr'd by our assembled British Kings On Constantine for ever and his heirs.”— “Alas! how better were it to know nought, Than, like kings, darkly. Constantine's brave sons And Samor oft have met, have met to mourn The peril of their native land, to swear Before the altar of the eternal God, Never, amid these rude and dangerous times, To blow the trump of civil strife, but prop With their allegiance Britain's throne, though fill'd By one they deem usurping. Vortigern! I touch the string that jars thy inmost soul, And it must vibrate to its highest pitch. Oh what a royal madness, that might build Upon the strong rock of a people's love, Yet chooses the loose quicksand of distrust. Oh monarch! thou dost fear thy subjects arm'd, Fear, lest the old valour in their hearts revive, And therefore fight'st their wars with foreign steel. And is this he, the noble and the wise, The Vortigern, that Britain on the plain Of Arles, that fatal plain, hail'd Captain, King? Arise, be King, be Captain, be thyself! And we will stand around thy throne, and mock The wide-spread ruin of the times.”—“Away! My royal word is to the Saxon given.”— “Oh, Vortigern! this knee hath never bow'd, Save to the King of Kings, thus low on earth I sue thee, cast the Saxon off.”—At once The swift contagious grandeur set on fire The Monarch—“I am thine, am Britain's all: Now by my throne, thus, thus I have not felt, Since first this golden circle girt my brow, So free, so upright, and so kingly; chains Fall from me, mists are curling off my soul.” Like two bold Venturers, silently they stand, Launching amid the sun-light their rich bark O'er glassy waters to the summer airs: Their solemn pondering hath the lofty look Of vaunting, over each high brow flames out A noble rivalry of hope and pride. Even at that instant, smoothly sliding came A car, in which, like some fair idol, led Through the mute tumult of adoring streets, Bright-hair'd Rowena pass'd the portal arch. Have ye a sense, ye gales, a conscious joy In beauty, that with such an artful touch And light ye float about her garment folds, Displaying what is exquisite display'd, And thinly scattering the light veil where'er It may enhance the grace, that thus ye love To lose yourselves about her, and expire Upon her shape, or snow-white robes? She stood, Her ivory arm in a soft curve stretch'd out, As only in the obedience of her steeds Rejoicing; they their necks arch'd proud and high, And by her delicate and flower-soft hands Sway'd, as enamour'd of her mastery, mov'd. But as the Monarch she beheld, she caught The slack rein up, and with unconscious check Delay'd the willing coursers; and her head, Upon her snowy shoulder half declin'd In languor of enjoyment, rising wore Rosy confusion; and her stately pride A moment sank to sweet embarrassment. Haughty to all the world, save him alone, She seem'd, and almost trembled as she gaz'd. Alone she came, alone she went not on. BOOK II. ARGUMENT. Meeting of British kings in an ancient grove.

Prophecy of Merlin. Constans the Monk, the elder of the sons of Constantine, declines the Throne. Noon is ablaze in Heaven; but gloom, the gloom Of the brown forest's massy vault of shade, Is o'er the Kings of Britain; the broad oaks, As in protection of that conclave proud, Like some old temple's dome, august and huge Meet overhead, their rugged trunks around Shew like fantastic pillars closely set By Druids in mysterious circle, wont Here, when the earth abroad was bright and clear With moonshine, to perform their midnight rites By blue nor earthly kindled fires, while Bards Pour'd more than music from their charmed harps. Each on his mossy seat, in arms that cast A glimmer which is scarcely light, they sit Colossal, stern, and still; on every brow Indignant sorrow and sad vengeance lower. Them had the Pagan peasant deemed his Gods, In cloudy wrath down stooping from the heavens To blast the mighty of mankind, and wreak On some old empire ruin and revenge. And first majestical, yet mild, arose A lofty shape, nor less than monarch seem'd, Whose royal look from souls bold, brave, and free, Not stooping slavery claim'd, but upright awe And noble homage; yet uncrown'd he wore Dominion. Him with stately reverence heard That armed Senate. “Princes of the land, Lords of the old hereditary thrones Of Britain, we, the sons of Constantine, Emrys and Uther, come not here to charge Inconstant counsel on your wisdom, nought Arraigning, that the sceptre to our line Solemnly given, in those disastrous days, When for the Empire of the Occident, For Gaul o'er-master'd, and submitted Spain, Warr'd Constantine, and warring nobly fell, Ye placed in elder hand; our right foregone For the more precious public weal. Oh Chiefs, 'Twas well and wisely done; a stripling's arm May rear the kingly standard in its pomp To play with Zephyrs under cloudless skies; But when the rude storm shakes its ponderous folds 'Twere hard for less than the consummate man Aloft to bear it, and unstooping. Well Stemm'd your new standard bearer Vortigern The o'ershadowing tempest, well his brow became Your crown's old glories; till, alas! dire change! Dread fall! the sceptre that ye fondly hoped Would blossom, like the Hebrew Hierarch's rod, With the almond bloom of mercy and of love, More like the Egyptian magic-worker's wand Became a serpent, blasting all your peace With its infection. Then your virtues wrought Your sorrows, from your valour grew your shame. Your borders were o'erleap'd, your towns on fire, And the land groan'd beneath fierce Rapine's wheels. Ye cried unto your king for arms; but he In cold and jealous wisdom fear'd to arm, Whose arms might brave himself, and cast control On the fierce wanderings of his despot will. Then Saxons fought our wars, our hard-wrung gold Bought us ignoble safety, till the slaves Swell'd into Lords, and realms must pamper up Our hirelings into Princes; Kent, fair Kent, The frontlet of our isle, where yet are seen The graves great Cæsar peopled with his dead, When on his rear the Briton conqueror hung; Where first the Banner of the Cross was wav'd, Sinks to a Heathen province. Warriors! Kings! This must not be among baptized men, This cannot be 'mong Britons. Therefore here, Here in your presence dare we call again, Your throne our throne, and challenge in your love A Sovereign's title. By our youth we fell From that great height, but Vortigern hath fall'n By his own guilt: we therefore rise again In majesty renew'd; he falls, no more To occupy the sacred royal seat.” Thereat with concord loud, and stern acclaim, Gave answer that proud Senate, and denounc'd Judgment irrevocable. But with mien Somewhat appall'd, as one in high debate And solemn council unassay'd, arose Prince Uther: ere he spake, his clanging mail Fiercely he smote, mute audience to enchain, Then at the battle sound enkindling, high His haughty brow and crested helm he raised, And rude his fiery eloquence pour'd forth. “Warriors of Britain! me nor pomp of words Beseems, nor strife of smooth and liquid phrase, In the debate of swords, the fray of steeds No combatant unskill'd. I will not boast That I have brook'd with Emrys' patient pride A sceptre's loss: a boy, I wept to hear My father's crown was on a stranger's brow. But when my arm could grasp a sword, those tears, Those soft unseemly waters, turn'd to drops Of burning indignation. At his height And plenitude of power I yearned to rise Against th' enthroned Usurper—now, oh Kings! Thus charter'd, thus commission'd, thus array'd, With what a noble frenzy will we rush, And trample down Saxon and Vortigern. Our path shall be as rapid and as bright As summer meteor, more pernicious; that Waning into the dull unkindling air, We burning, desolating as we pass. Rise, Britons, rise, a tyrant fills your throne! Nor fitter monument may tyrant find Than his throne's ruins; let the flat earth close O'er both at once. The stranger Saxon lords Within our island, let the seas which bore Here his storm-braving navy, bear him back Weltering and tossing in their drowning surge.” Low'ring he stood, still in fierce act of speech, Yet speechless. Sudden, then, in dread uproar Rose shout of war, with thundering clash of arms Mingled; then hurrying spears and nodding helms With glittering tumult in the pale gloom flash'd; War, war each voice, each stricken shield denounc'd. Amid the multitudinous din arose Solemnly the Bright City's Lord. Down sank Instant all tumult; broke abruptly off Fierce voice and clash of arms; so mute and deep Settled the silence, the low sound was heard Of distant waterfall, the acorn drop From the green arch above. Still and abash'd Sate the fierce conclave, while with mild reproof Winning all hearts, the gracious Chieftain spake. “Brave sight for earth and heaven! it doth not fail A nation's cry for freedom and for faith, Nor faint, nor deaden in the mist and gloom Of this low earth; it takes the morning's wings, Passes the crystal skies, and beats heaven's gate; There glides it through rejoicing Angel choirs, That fan it onward with their favouring plumes, To the eternal sapphire throne, and him That sits thereon, Ineffable. Oh Kings, Our council, thus appealing, may not speak The voice of earthly passion, lust of sway, Or hasty vengeance: we must rise in wrath, But wear it as a mourner's robe of grief, Not as a garb of joy: must boldly strike, But like the Roman, with reverted face, In sorrow to be forced to such dire deed. It would mis-seem a Briton, noble Chiefs! To trample on the fallen, though a King; It would mis-seem a Christian to rejoice Where virtue hath play'd false, and fame's pure light Hath sicken'd to dishonourable gloom. Vortigern is our foe, no more our King, Yet King he hath been, King he had been still, Had never his high vaulting pride disdain'd The smooth dominion of old use, nor striven To fix on our impatient necks the yoke Of foreign usurpation; our free land Will not endure the heathen Saxons rule, Nor him that rules by heathen Saxon power. So march we forth in th' armour of our right, From our once King not falling off in hate Or fickleness, but by severe constraint Of duty to ourselves and to our God. So march we forth, in state that well may make Our mother country proud of us: raise up, Side by side, winning the fair airs of heaven To an approval of our upright deed, Our royal banner and the Cross of Christ; And move beneath their holy shadow, calm, And yet resistless, as the bright-man'd steeds That bear the Morn to disenthrone old Night. “And now our kingly sceptre, forced aside, By stress and pressure of disorder'd times, Devious into an alien hand, reverts To the old line; the heir of Constantine, Constans, as elder than this noble pair, Stands foremost on succession's golden roll. Nor know not I his gentle soul more apt, To listen to the peaceful vesper hymn, Than danger's spirit-stirring trump, yet deem, Thus once forewarn'd, 'tis dangerous to divert The stream of royal blood, that broken, pours Waters of bitterness and civil strife O'er th' harass'd land, and therefore thus I hail Constans the King of Britain. Speak I well? I pause, and wait, oh Chiefs, your high award.” He ceased, nor time for voice or swift acclaim, With a short sullen laugh of scorn, leaped up The mountain King, the Sovereign of the lakes And dales this side the Caledonian bound; He only, when the Kings sate awe-struck, stood Elate with mocking pity in his frown; A mighty savage, he of God and man Alike contemptuous: nought of Christian lore Knew he, yet scoff'd unknown, 'twas peaceful, meek, Thence worthless knowledge. Him delighted more Helvellyn's cloud-wrapt brow to climb, and share The eagle's stormy solitude; 'mid wreck Of whirlwinds and dire lightnings, huge he stood, Where his own Gods he deem'd on volleying clouds Abroad were riding, and black hurricane. Them in their misty pride assail'd he oft With impious threat, and laugh'd when th' echoing glens His wild defiance cast unanswered back. Now with curl'd lip of scorn, and lofty brow, Lordly command, not counsel, thus he spake. —“Shame, coward shame! as though the fowls of heaven, When in dusk majesty and pride of wing Sails forth the monarch eagle, down should stoop In homage to the daw. Oh craven souls, When Snowdon or high Skiddaw's brow is bare, To plant the stately standard of revolt Upon a molehill. Constans! that to him Caswallon should bow down; aloft our crown Upon the giddy banner staff, that rocks On Troynovant's tall citadel, uphang, And who the dizzy glory will rend down, Or Constans or Caswallon? The bright throne Environ with grim ranks of steel-girt men: Huge Saxons black with grisly scars of war, Who first will hew to that triumphal seat His bloody path? Hear, sceptred Britons, hear, A counsel worthy the deep thoughts of kings. Of valorous achievement and bold deeds Be guerdon to the mightiest of our Isle, The Sov'reignty of Britain; spurn my voice, And I renounce your councils, cast you off, And with my hardy vassals of the north I join the Saxon.”—Then fierce sounds again Broke out, wan flames of brandish'd armour flash'd. In rude disorder and infuriate haste Sprang every warrior from his seat: as clouds Amid the sultry heaven, thunderous and vast, Gather their blackening disarray to burst Upon some mountain turret, so the Chiefs Banded in fierce confusion to rush on, And whelm in his insulting pride the foe. He stood as one in joy, and lower'd a smile; With wolf-skin robe flung back, broad shield outstretch'd, And battle axe uplift: vaunting and huge As fabled giant on embattled Heaven Glaring not less than utter overthrow, And total wreck. Forthwith a youth rush'd out, His moony buckler high upheld to bar The onset, and with voice, which youthful awe Temper'd to tone less resolute, address'd The haughty Chieftain. “Father, deem not thou Malwyn confederate in thy lawless thought, Mine is a Briton's soul, a Briton's sword, But mortal man that seeks thy life, must pass O'er Malwyn's corpse.” Back Chief and King recoil'd, In breathless admiration. Nobler pride, And human joy almost to softness smooth'd Caswallon's rugged brow. “Well hast thou said, Son of Caswallon, worthy of thy sire! On thine own track mount thou to fame, nor swerve For man, or more than man.”—Awhile the Kings Brief parley held, then stately and severe Rose Emrys, and pronounc'd their stern arrest. “Caswallon of the Mountains, long our isle Hath mark'd thy wavering mood, now friend, now foe; Now in the Caledonian inroad prompt To bear thy share in rapine, foremost now In our high councils. This we further say, We scorn thy war, Caswallon, hate thy peace, And deem it of our mercy that, unscath'd, We banish thee our presence.” Nor reply Caswallon deign'd; calm strode he as in scorn Of wrath 'gainst foes so lowly. Far was heard His tread along the rocky path, the crash Of branches rent by his unstooping helm. They in blank wonder sate, nor wholly quell'd Wrath and insulted majesty, with look As he were still in presence fix'd and stern. Then Emrys, “It demands no trivial toil To shape the rude trunk of our enterprise To full perfection; each must have his charge In this great enterprise. Be, Samor, thine To bear our brother Constans Britain's crown, In name of our assembled Kings. Be mine From the Armoric shore, King Hoel's realm, (Our father's brother, Hoel) to embark The succours of his high-fam'd Chivalry. Thou, Uther, to the West; each other King Unto his own, at signal of revolt To lead his armed Vassalage abroad.” So saying, each departed; fell again The ancient silence on the solemn place. Together from the forest pass'd the friends, Samor and Elidure; downward their way Went wandering on through flowery meads, or sank Beneath green arches dim of beechen shade. Around the golden hills in summer wealth Bask'd in the sunshine; on a river bank Long gleaming down its woodland course, repos'd Many a white hamlet: even fierce shrines of war Wore aspect mild of peace; towers dark of yore And rugged in the Roman war array, With wanton ivy and grey moss o'ergrown, Their green crowns lifted to the azure heavens. “Oh grief! o'er yon fair meads and smiling lawns Must steeds of carnage batten, men of blood Their fell magnificence of murtherous pomp Pavilion in yon placid groves of peace. The brutal savages of wood and air, In meet abodes of wilderness and woe, Shroud their blood-thirsty revels; the gaunt wolf Prowls gloomy o'er the wintry blasted heath; Brood desolate on some bare mountain peak Raven and screaming vulture. Man, fell man, Envious of bliss he scorns, 'mid haunts of peace, The fairest, the most blissful spots of earth, Plays ever his foul game of spoil and death, Ruthless; then vaunts himself Creation's pride, Supreme o'er all in deeds of blood alone.” Thus Elidure; but Samor, from deep trance Wakening, replied: “Soft man of peace, my prayer Would ask of heaven no theatre of strife Save yon fair plain, there forth the weak would start In the resistless valour of despair, The timorous proudly tower in scorn of death: There, where each tree, each dell, each grassy knoll, Lovely from memory of some past delight, Is kindred to the soul; his house of prayer, The altar of his bridal vow, the font Of his sweet infants' baptism, kindred all, Holiest and last, his fathers' peaceful graves: Oh, were all Britain, like yon beauteous plain, Blissful and free, that angels there might walk Forgetful of their heavenly bowers of light, Friend of my boyhood, these all-conquering foes, Who fetter the free winds, and ride the sea Kinglike, their menacing prows would turn aloof, And bitterly, in baffled lust of prey, Curse the proud happiness that mock'd their might.” Lo, ere they paus'd, gay files of dazzling light Slow o'er the plain advancing, the long blaze Broke gradual into form; lance, bow, and helm, Standard and streamer, chariot and tall steed, Start from the mingled splendour. On their height Unseen, the Chieftains watch'd the winding pomp. And all before the azure-vested Bards From glancing instruments struck bridal glee. Then came the gorgeous chariots, rough with gold, And steeds their proud heads nodding with rich weight Of frontlet wreathed with flowers and shadowy plumes; Therein sate ladies robed in costly state, Each like a Queen; the noble charioteers, Briton in garb, with purple mantle loose, O'er steel, in network bright, or scale o'er scale Glittering, and aventayle barr'd close and firm, As though the gaudy traitors shamed to meet The piercing glance of countrymen betray'd. Dark in their iron arms, some wildly girt With Caledonian spoils, their yellow hair Down from the casque in broad luxuriant flow Spreading, and lofty banner wide display'd, Whereon a milk-white courser reinless shone, Wound forth the Saxon warriors. High o'er all, Tempestuous Horsa, chafing his hot steed, And Hengist with his wreath of amber beads, He is so decorated by the Welsh Poets. See Translation of the Brut of Tysilio, by Peter Roberts. His hoary strength, in spite of age or toil, A tower of might. With a tall grove of spears, Circled, and rampart close of serried shields, The bridegroom Monarch rode; his bright attire Peaceful, as fitting nuptial pomp; his robe Rich-floating strew'd the earth with purple shade; And on his lofty brow a regal crown, Bright as a wreath of sunbeams; high his arm The ivory sceptre bore of kingly sway: Yet who his mien and bearing watch'd, had seen Dim gleams of jealous steel, or lurking mail Beneath those glorious trappings, for his look, Now jocund, chang'd anon to restless gaze, Fearful and wild, as though the air were rife With deadly vengeful javelins; his pace Hurried, yet tardy, as of one who rides O'er land still tottering with an earthquake shock. And him beside, on snowy palfrey, deck'd With silver bells its pendant mane profuse, Of silver and of stainless ermelin The bright caparisons, and all her robes White as of woven lily cups, the Bride Majestic rode as on a moving throne. Her sunbright hair she wav'd, and smil'd around, As though, of less than kingly Paramour Scornful, she said, Lo, Britain, through your land I lead the enthralled sovereign of your isle. Yet so surpassing fair, one instant wish'd Those wrathful Briton Chiefs their leafy screen A thin transparent cloud: of his high charge Awhile forgetful, Samor stood entranced, Fearing her form should fleet too swift away. Came it from earth or air, yon savage shape, His garb, if garb it be, of shaggy hair Close folding o'er his dusky limbs; his locks And waving matted beard like cypress boughs On bleak heath swaying to the midnight storm? I took this from Mr. Ellis's abstract of the Metrical Romance of Merlin. The reader, if he is curious in such matters, may find how Merlin happened to be born in this state, in “Ellis's Metrical Romances,” vol. i. p. 223. Came he from yon deep wood? On the light spray No leaf is stirring. On the winged winds Rode he? No breeze awakes the noontide air. Mid that arm'd throng, dismaying, undismay'd, With a strange eye dilated, as unus'd To common sights of earth, and voice that seem'd Rarely to hold discourse with human ears, “Joy,” and again, and thrice he utter'd “Joy.” Cower'd Horsa on his palsied steed; aghast As toiling to despise the thing he fear'd, Sate Hengist. “Joy to Bridegroom and to Bride! Why should not man rejoice, and earth be glad? Beyond the sphere of man, the round of earth, There's loud rejoicing,—'tis not in the heavens! And many ministrant Angels shake their wings In gladness—wings that are not plum'd with light. The dead are jocund—not the dead in bliss. Your couch is blest—by all whose blessings blast, All things unlovely gratulate your love. I see the nuptial pomp, the nuptial song I hear, and full the pomp, for Hate, and Fear, Shame and Dishonour, Discontent and Grief, And Infamy, and Servitude are there, A blithesome troop, a gay and festive crew. And the Land's curses are the bridal hymn; Sweetly and shrilly doth th' accordant Isle Imprecate the glad Hymenean song. So joy again, I say, to Britain's King, That takes unto his bosom Britain's fate, Her beautiful destruction, to his bed. And joy to Britain's Queen, who bears her Lord So bright a dowry and profuse, long years Of war and havoc, streams of kindred blood, And widest ruin, loss of crown and fame, And full perdition of the immortal soul; So thrice again I utter ‘joy,’ joy,’ ‘joy!’” Then upsprung lance to strike, and bicker'd bow; Ere lance could strike, or shaft could fly, the path Was bare and vacant; shape nor sound remain'd; Only the voice of Vortigern moan'd out, “Merlin;”—and on the long procession past. Down in a quiet dale, where beechen groves With interchanging gold and glossy green O'ermantled the smooth slopes, that fell around Like a fair amphitheatre: beneath, A brook went wand'ring through fresh meadow banks, With a cool summer dashing: here the Chiefs The royal Hermit found. His gentle brow Smooth as a slumbering Angel's plumes, e'en now Effaced all traces of this lower earth, Wore that calm holiness the sainted dead Smile on the dreams of those they lov'd on earth: His life was like a sleep, with heavenly sights, And harmonies, as of seraphic sounds Visited ever: nor his barren heart Touch'd not the light affections, trembled not His spirit with love's fervent swell; but all Most wont to bear man's soul to earth, round his, As the thin morning clouds around the lark, Gather'd, to float it upward to the heavens. They laying at his feet the kingly crown, Fulfill'd their lofty mission. He, the while, With that mild sadness he had watch'd the leaves Drip from the sere autumnal bough, survey'd Its stately glittering. “Men of earth, why mock, With gaudy pageantry, and titled pomp, The frail and transient pilgrims of this world? The fading flag-flower on yon streamlet brink, Were garland meeter for our mortal brows Than yon rich blaze of gems.”—“Prince,” Samor spake, “Sweet is it down the silent vale of life To glide away, of all but Heaven forgot, Forgetting all but Heaven. To king-born men, Lords of mankind, Heaven's delegates, belongs A loftier doom, their rare prerogative The luxury of conferring bliss. Oh, Prince, Not by the stream to slumber, not to waste Idly in joyous dreams the drowsy hours, Hath Heaven thy kingly heritage ordain'd. God's noblest service is to serve mankind, To save a nation all that man may do To imitate the Lord who saved the world.” Calm answer'd Constans, “Earth's exalted fame, Grandeurs and glories gleam upon my soul Like wintry sun-light on a plain of snow. With prayers, a Hermit's arms, I aid your cause, Farewell. Why pause ye, as to question more The wisdom of my choice? Lo, yon bright orb; How spotless the pure azure where he holds His noontide throne, nor knows his golden light A stain of dimness, till th' abode of men Infects it with its tainting mists.”—“Oh, Prince, 'Tis not the glory of that peerless light, The barren glittering, the unfruitful waste Of splendour on the still inanimate skies, It is the life, the motion, and the joy It breathes along this world of man, the broad Munificence of blessing that awakes, And in its rapturous gratitude springs up To glorify its bounteous source of pride.” “I see thy brow at thine own words on fire; Mine, Samor, yet is calm and cold.”—“Dost thou, Constans, all title, claim, and right renounce To Britain's throne?”—“Freely as I renounce The everlasting enemy of man.”— “Will thy voice mingle with the general cry, ‘Long live King Emrys?’”—“Long may Emrys live, Even the eternal life beyond the grave.” “Yet one word more; 'tis perilous in the storm For the tall pine, nor less, in evil days, For the high born and exalted of the state. The Saxon blood-hounds are abroad for prey, Seek thou some quiet solitude remote Beyond their prowling range.”—His arm to Heaven Slowly uplifted, “Will they reach me there?” Spake the meek Hermit, “there is rest secure.” They parted; gentle Elidure alone, Lingering, with somewhat of an envious gaze View'd the deep quiet of that placid dell. That night were seen along the dusky wood, Of more than human stature moving forms, Pale faces circled with black iron helms; Not of the Briton shape their garb or arms; Stealthy their pace and slow; the peasants thought Demons of evil that sad night had power, And pray'd Heaven's grace to guard the saintly man. At morn roved forth a shepherd, down the dale His dog went bounding to the Hermit's cell, For all mute creatures loved the man of God. A quick and desolate moaning nearer call'd The peasant; in officious grief the dog Stood licking the cold hand that drooping hung Lifeless; the mild composure of his brow On the cross rested; praying he had died, And his cold features yet were smiling prayer.

The preparation for the Sacrifice of the Maiden. Orient the bright-hair'd Charioteer of heaven Pour'd daylight from his opal wheels, and struck From the blue pavement of the sky clear flakes Of azure light upon the Eastern sea. And as the grey mists slowly curl'd away, Rose the white cliffs of Kent, like palace fair, Or fane of snowy marble, to enshrine Blue Amphitrite, or the Sea-Gods old Of Pagan mariner. Rode tall below The Saxon navy, as from midnight sleep Wakening; the white sails in the breeze of morn 'Gan tremble, gleaming oars flash in the spray. The Sea-Kings on the beach in parley stern Were met, nor less than nation's doom and fate Of kingdoms in their voice. Lo, in the midst Stood huge Caswallon, word of mild salute Deign'd not, but thus addrest the Ocean Lord. “Saxon! that o'er this fair and princely isle Thou would'st win empire by the sword of war, I marvel not, arraign not—'tis a dream, Noble as o'er the heavens to walk abroad, Companion of yon bright majestic sun. Now by my glory, Saxon, mortal peer Never Caswallon brook'd, save thee alone, Thee, rival in his race of pride and power. Arm'd with myself and all th' embattled North, (No Roman Britons, sons of sires who dash'd The purple Conquerors' haughty wall to earth, And trampled their strewn ramparts; who ne'er deign'd Barter for gaudy robe and marble pile Fierce naked freedom, and wild mountain cave) Will I, and thou with Saxon spears begirt, Bow this fair Britain to our lordly sway. Then will we two, from pale perplexed earth Seen, like twin meteors battling in high heaven, On some lone eminence wage glorious strife; Sole empire meed of conquest, of defeat Death honourable, unsubmitting death The solace and the comfort.” Bold he paus'd, Nor Hengist with pale sign of awe or dread Shamed the proud peerage, but with hardy speech Guileful, won faith by seeming scorn of guile. “Briton, to dare high deeds, and to disown, Argues a wavering valour; the firm soul Vaunts resolute its lofty dangerous scope. To us our Gods o'er ocean and its shores Kingly dominion and wide sway have given; Were insult to our might and base reproach, The freedom of one sea-girt isle. To thee Honouring, not fearing, 'mid our prime we grant Superior state, and eminence of power. Now speed we of th' immortal Powers in Heaven, Our high omniscient Fathers, to demand If on the eternal shield of fate be graven Ruin or Conquest, ere to bold emprize We gird our brazen arms.”—“Of mighty men The gods are mighty, whom the Saxon fears, The paramount of men, 'twere rash to scorn, No calm and sunshine deities of peace.” So spake Caswallon, the mild faith of Christ Scoffing with covert mockery; thus th' All Wise The imaginations of the proud on earth Silent endures, till some brief point of time Crumbles the high-built insolence of years. “Wilt thou behold our gods?” fierce Horsa cried. “Then mount the bark, abroad her wings are spread, And fleet along the obedient deep she speeds. Fear not, proud Briton.”—“Fear!” Caswallon cried; All iron as he stood, o'er surf, surge, wave He bounded, hollow rang his heavy arms, The bark her tall side to the troubled waves Stoop'd groaning, nor delay'd the Ocean King. “Brother, farewell! not singly the bold wolf Scatters the mountain herd; in grim repose He rests expectant of his kindred troop, Numberless from their shaggy dens they sweep, And spacious o'er the antler'd monarch's realm Spreads the wide ravage of their muster'd might.” Stern Horsa bow'd assent, yet paus'd to watch The proud bark tilting o'er the azure plain. Stately she rode her path of light, her sails In dalliance with the courteous winds: bold Man! Well may thy full heart bound: in earth and air The thunder-maned steed, the eagle thron'd In the pavilion of his plumes, stand forth Creation's glories; but the noblest shape That walks the deep, thy workmanship sublime Owneth, and starts from thee to life. Boast thou, Yet humbly boast, all greatness is from God. What dolphin glancing in his silver sport, So graceful with translucent pinion parts The liquid azure? what Leviathan, Huge heaving on the thick Norwegian foam, So lordly as the white-wing'd bark, that wafts The Sea King o'er his empire? the fair waves Rise in their gamesome turbulence, and pay Wild homage to that royal Mariner. The motion and the murmur of the deep, The rushing of the silent, solemn sky, Each in its deep abyss and pure expanse, Seeming its secret mysteries of might, Its ruling soul of everlasting change, To veil from mortal knowledge, ever pour, Even o'er the rudest minds, a pleasing awe, And th' agitation of a thrilling dread. Rapt in vague notions of infinity, And listening to eternal sights and sounds, Inactive though the body, the free spirit Ranges along the illimitable void, 'Mid perils strange and rich uncertainties, In restless course; now gathering treasures rare, That gem the caverns of the hoary deep, Or bathes with sea-maids in their crystal bowers, Or with gay creatures and fantastical Peoples some dreamy land; such joys of old Lured the fierce Saxon from his darksome woods, To launch along the vast and barren sea. Such joys through this long voyage, wean'd brief while From thoughts of war and war-won empire wide, Haughty Caswallon, or from him assum'd Fierce aspect, and a martial character. 'Twas midnight, but a rich untimely dawn Sheets the fir'd Arctic heaven; forth springs an arch, O'erspanning with a crystal pathway pure The starry sky; as though for Gods to march, With show of heavenly warfare daunting earth, To that wild revel of the northern clouds: They now with broad and bannery light distinct Stream in their restless wavings to and fro, While the sea billows gleam them mellower back; Anon like slender lances bright start up, And clash and cross with hurtle and with flash, Tilting their airy tournament. “Brave signs,” Cried Hengist; “lo, our Gods their standards rear, And with glad omen of immortal strife Salute our high-wing'd purpose.”—“Yea (return'd Caswallon) from mine own Helvellyn's brow, Never a brighter conflict in the skies Taught me that war was dear in Heaven: dream ye Of tamer faith in gentle Southern skies Your smooth and basking deities! our North Wooes not with tender hues and sunny smiles Soft worship, but emblazons all the air With semblance of celestial strife, unveils To us of their empyreal halls the pomp, The secret majesty of godlike war.” Oh Lord of Lords! incessant thus assail'd That Pagan with his frantic railings Thee, Th' Ineffable, yet worshipp'd of thy power A faint and pale effect, reflection dim From thy soul-blinding glories. On they sail'd, Till o'er the dark deep now the wintry winds Swept on their murky pinions; huge and high The liquid legions of the main arose; Like snow upon the sable pines, the foam Hung hoary on their towered fronts; but slow, Like a triumphant warrior, their bold bark Wore onward, now upon the loftiest height Shaking its streamers' gay defiance, now With brave devotion to the prone abyss Down plunging; but the sternest Saxon cheek Put not to shame that dauntless Landsman; he In the strong passion of a new delight On the fierce tumult feasts, and almost grieves, When now beneath the haven rocks embayed, The angry waves seem wearying to repose, And the slack sails slow droop their flagging folds. Their port was southward of that Strait, where bursts The Baltic, with her massy waves of ice Encumbering far and wide the Northern main. South, North, and East, the rapid heralds speed, Summoning from fen or forest, moor or wild, Britain! on thee to banquet, all who bathe In Weser, Elbe, or Rhine, their saffron locks, Hertog and Erle and King; the huntsman bold Of bear, or bison, o'er the quaking moss, Or grim Vikinger, who but sues his Gods For tempests, so upon some wealthy coast His midnight frigate unforeseen may burst, And freight its greedy hold with amplest spoil. And now have Hengist and Caswallon climb'd The chariot of the Oracle; no wheels Bear that strange car; like wind along the sea, It glides along the rapid rein-deer's track, Beauteous those gentle rein-deer arch'd their necks, And cast their palmy antlers back, and spread Their broad red nostrils to the wind; they hear Old Hengist's voice, like arrows down the gale, Like shot-stars through the welkin, start they forth. The car slides light, the deer bound fleet: they pass Dark leagues of pine and fir, the filmy light, Shivering with every motion of the wind, On their brown path lies tremulous, o'er them sails, Heard through the dismal foliage hissing shrill, And hoarser groaning of the swaying boughs, The funeral descant of the ominous birds. Around them the prophetic milk white steeds, Proprium gentis, equorum quoque præsagia ac monitus experiri: publicè aluntur iisdem nemoribus ac lucis. Candidi, et nullo mortali opere contacti, quos pressos sacro curru sacerdos ac rex vel princeps civitatis comitantur, hinnitusque ac fremitus observant. Tac. Germ. Their necks yet virgin of the taming curb, With all their loose long glories, arch, and pass In solemn silence, and regardless paw The unechoing earth. But Hengist, resolute With bolder hand inflexible, to draw The veil of dusk futurity, disdains These tamer omens. Still the car slides light, The deer bound fleet; they pause not, save to quaff The narrow cruise, to share their scanty store. Like swallows o'er the glassy rivers smooth, O'er the pellucid lake, with glittering breast Yet wrinkled with its rippling waves, they skim, The dead unstirring ocean bears them on; Amid the immortal ice-hills wind they now. In restless change God's softer summer works Glitter and fade, are born and die; but these, Endiadem'd by undissolving snows, High Potentates of winter's drear domain, Accumulate their everlasting bulk, Eternal and imperishable; they Amid Creation's swift inconstant round, In majesty of silence undisturb'd, Save when from their long-menacing brows they shake The ruining Avalanche; unvisited By motion, but of sailing clouds, when sleets From their unwasting armoury barb their darts, And the grim North-wind loads his rimy wings. Nor trace of man, save many a fathom deep, Haply dark signs of some tall people strange, That walk'd the infant earth, may shroud profound Their legends inaccessible. They soar In precipice abrupt, or pyramid Linking the earth and heaven; to which the piles Where those Egyptian despots rot sublime, Or even that frantic Babylonian tower, Might veil inglorious their inferior heights. Nor wants soft interchange of vale, where smiles White mimicry of foliage and thin flower. Feathery and fanlike spreads the leafy ice, With dropping cup, and roving tendril loose, As though the glassy dews o'er flower and herb Their silken moisture had congeal'd; and yet Within that slender veil their knots profuse Blossom'd and blush'd with tender life: the couch Less various where the fabled Zephyr fans With his mild wings his Flora's bloomy locks; But colourless and cold, these flowering vales Seem meeter for decrepit Winter's head To lie in numb repose. The car slides light, The deer bound fleet; the long grey wilderness Hath something of a roseate glimmering dim, And widens still its pale expanse: when lo, A light of azure, wavering to display No sights, no shapes of darkness and of fear. Tremblingly flash'd the inconstant meteor light, Shewing thin forms, like virgins of this earth, Save that all signs of human joy or grief, The flush of passion, smile or tear had seem'd On the fix'd brightness of each dazzling cheek, Strange and unnatural; statues they might seem By nature, in fantastic mood congeal'd From purest snow, the fair of earth to shame, Surpassing beauteous; breath of mortal life Heaved not their bosoms, and no rosy blood Tinged their full veins; yet moved they, and their steps Were harmony. But three of that bright troop, The loveliest and the wildest, stood aloof, Enwrapt by what in human form were like Impulse divine, but of their nature seem'd The eternal instinct. Them no less survey'd Caswallon with the knitted brow of scorn, Bitter he spake—“No marvel Saxon souls Revel in war's delights, so stern, so fierce Their deities.” Severe with wrath supprest, As one ill-brooking that irreverent mirth Scoff'd the dread lore, himself ne'er dar'd to doubt, Answer'd the son of Woden. “These, proud Chief, So snowy soft, so seeming gentle, these Are ministers of destiny and death, The viewless Riders of the battle field: When sounds the rushing of their sable steeds, Down sink the summon'd mighty, and expand Valhalla's cloudy portals; to their thrones They the triumphant strangers lead, and pour Lavish the eternal beverage of the Gods. Yon bright-hair'd three behold'st thou? would thy soul Grasp the famed deeds of ancient time; or know The acts and exploits of our present world? Lo Gudur, she whose deep mysterious soul Treasureth the past, and Rosta, who beholds All deeds and agents of this living earth; She too is there before whose spacious sight The years that have not been, start up and live, Who reads within the soul of man unborn The unimagin'd purpose, of the sage Skulda the sagest. Ask and thou shalt know.” —“I am not King of Britain, have not been; Hateful the present and the past, my soul Thirsts for what is to come.”—Then Hengist spake In tone of mix'd authority and prayer, “Queen of the Future, Valkyr, hear and speak, Speak to the Son of Woden.” The thin air Instant absorb'd that glittering troop, alone Stood Skulda with her white hair waving wide, As trembling on the verge of palpable being, Ready to languish too in light away. “O'er Britain's isle doth Woden to his sons Give empire?” She, but in no human tone, Still from the soul's emotion harsh or soft, In one shrill sweet unvarying tone replied, “To thine, but not to thee.”—And, “I am thine,” Caswallon shouted loud, and sternly shook His visionary sceptre. “Whence the foe Fatal to Hengist, and to Hengist's sway?”— “Not from the mountain, Saxon, from the Vale.” Heard, heeded not the Mountain Chief that strain Dire and ill-boding, or if heard, disdain'd Adverse, what prosperous seem'd a voice from Heaven. “By what rich rite,” he cried, “may Briton Chief Win favour from high Woden?”—“Not the blood Of steed or stag; a flower of earth must fade. Blest o'er all virgins of the earth, the chaste, The beautiful, by Heaven ordain'd to lead The souls of valiant men to the pale hall Of the Immortals; air her path, and Heaven Her dwelling, with the fair and brave of earth Her sole communion.”—“By my future throne, Proud office for the daughter of a King! A royal damsel, mine own blood, shall join Your cloudy mysteries.”—A hue like joy Overspread all her face and form, while slow Into the air she brighten'd, indistinct Even now, and now invisible. Sad seem'd In gloomy converse with his own dark mind Old Hengist; nor despair'd that bold of soul, In pride of human wisdom, to revoke The irrevocable, what himself deem'd fate By force or fraud to master or elude. O glorious eminence of virtuous fame, Glorious from peril! Warrior of the Vales, Fate-signal'd Samor, vaunt not thou the love Of a blind people, or weak prince: thy boast The sworn unerring hate of Britain's foe. So pass'd they forth, one in wild joy elate, Already in his high disdainful thought Wielding supremacy; each of fix'd fate Nought heeding, but what fed his fierce desires. The car slides light, the deer bound fleet, nor sun Nor star in all the hazy heavens. Snow, snow, Above, around, beneath. Unblinded yet, Drive on the kingly charioteers, and shake The showery plumage from their locks; fast fades The long pale plain, the giant ice-hills sink, Lakes, rivers, seas are patient of their speed, Huge, dim, and dusk the forest pines rush back, Now pant the brown deer by that ocean bay. How desolate are now thy unplough'd waves, Dark Baltic! wandering Elbe, thy icy breast How silent of thy hunters. Sleep thou calm Amid thy wanton vineyards, Gaul! no more The blue-eyed Plunderers, bridging thy broad Rhine, Waste thy inebriate harvests' clustering pride. Sing songs of joy, soft Italy! o'er thee But Alaric and Attila drive on Their chariot wheels of conquest, this their peer In wide-destroying havoc, in renown Of devastation, this, the fiercer third Of human Furies, scap'st thou, therefore sing, Soft Italy! For lo, at Hengist's call Vast Germany dispeoples all her realm, Deserts to silence and the beast of game Her long and soundless forests. Seems the North The forge of Nations, in one fleet t'exhaust Her iron wealth of warriors; helmed high The Suevian with his Insigne gentis obliquare crinem, nodoque substringere—In altitudinem quamdam et terrorem, adituri bella, compte, ut hostium oculis, ornantur. Tac. Germ. 38. towery knotted locks, Frisian and Scandinavian, Cimbrian rich In the old glory of his sires, who clomb The Alpine snows, and shook free Rome with dread. And others nameless, numberless, send forth Their bands; but three almost in nations came: The Jute, the Anglian, and the Saxon, each Leaving earth bare for many a lonesome league, His wives, his children, and his Gods embarks, On the fierce quest of peril and of power. Then forth arose each Chieftain to salute The polestar of their baleful galaxy, Prime Architect of ruin: him who sway'd Their hot marauding, desultory strife To cool and steady warfare, of their limbs The domineering soul. As each pass'd on The Scald awoke his harsh-strung shell, and cast The war tones of each nation to the winds; While Hengist with imperious flattery met Each tall and titled Leader: “Art thou here, Bold Frisian Hermengard! a broader isle And fairer than thy azure Rhine laves round, Spreads for thee her green valleys. How brook'st thou, Strong Scandinavian Lodbrog, thou the Chief Of the renown'd Vikinger, On the Vikinger, and the more savage Berserkir, see Turner's Anglo-Saxon History, vol. i. p. 462, &amp;c. while the waves So nobly riot with the wintry storms, The tame and steadfast land? Now freely leap, Arngrim, along thy Suevian forests brown The bear and foam-tusk'd wild boar; let them leap, A braver game is up on Britain's shore. O Cerdic, grey in glory, young in power, The Drave ran purple with thy boyish deeds; A darker, redder dye, o'er silver Thames Shall spread before thy ancient battle axe. Ho, Offa, the rich-flowing mead hath worn Your Jutland cups, beneath the British helms Capacious goblets smooth and fair await Offa's carousals. Heir of Cimbric fame, Cimbri parva nunc civitas sed gloriâ ingens. Tac. Germ. Frotho, whose sires within his shrine appall'd Rome's Capitolian Jove, disdain'st not thou To war against the slaves of Rome? Thou too My gold-hair'd brother, are the British maids, Or British warriors, Abisa! the first In the fierce yearnings of thy boyish soul? And lo the mighty Anglian; oh, unfold Ocean! more wide, more wealthy realms, too brief, Too narrow for Argantyr's fame, the bounds Of this the noblest of thy wave-girt isles.” Thereat a sound of clattering shields arose, As though the rocks around with one harsh rift Had rent asunder: “Fair must be the land, And brave the conquest, ample the renown, Where Hengist leads strong Woden's sceptred sons!” But inly laugh'd Caswallon, as he long'd With each or all to match his Briton strength; On the prophetic Valkyr thought, and frown'd Proud pity on the legends of their praise. Advanced Argantyr, his bold grasp apart, As peer his peer, led Hengist. “Thou and I, Saxon, must have our compact; dark I know Thy paths of strife, while my frank valour loves The broad bright sunshine, thou by sleight and art Min'st thy slow conquest; I with naked sword Affront my peril, till its menacing height Bows to the dust before me; for bold war, For noonday battling, tender I mine arm, But no allegiance own to subtle craft; To peace Argantyr doth revolt, when thou Array'st stern war in the smooth garb of guile.”— “The weak, Argantyr, and the friendless, need Such politic skill; I take thee at thy word. Who skulks a fox when he dare prowl a wolf? Power charters force, where strong Argantyr stands Is power.—And now aboard, brave Chiefs, aboard, Or the soft spring o'ertakes our tardy keels, And with her slothful breezes smooths the skies.” Wondrous that ocean armament; in shoals Ride boat and shallop, countless as the waves That show white slender streaks of foam between Their tawny sides; save here and there towers up Some statelier admiral in lordlier height O'er the rude comm'nalty, whose limber ribs Are the light wicker, cased with sturdy hides Their level bottoms smooth. Navigat oceano.Lucan. Oh, that frail Man, Uncharter'd from the boisterous licence rude Of pitiless winds, and fierce unfetter'd waves; To that unshackled libertine, wild Chance, Surrender'd, unprotected from the burst And inroad of the boiling surge; that he, With such thin barrier between life and death, Should skit and skim along the ocean waste, Careless as maiden in a flowery field; Valour or frenzy is it? They their toil Ply nimbly, and with gallant oar chastise The insurgent billows, their despotic sails Lord o'er the wild democracy of air. Less vast, and manned with tamer, feebler spirits, In later days, against our Virgin Queen, The Spaniard's mad Armada; but the flag Of Howard, and the Almighty's stormy hand, Belied their braggard baptism, so they won Brave conquest! graves in ocean's soundless depths Or on the whirlpool-girded Orcade s. So onward rides that Pagan fleet: young Spring Hath scarcely tipt the leafless woods with green; Tyne's jetty tide is blanched with German oars. Now whither with that dark-brow'd priest set forth Old Hengist and the Briton Mountain Lord? Is it, fell Hengist, that Caswallon's name Transcend thine own in British hate, that he Close-link'd by fellowship in rites accurst, Be hence entirely, execrably thine? Or, from weak credence in such impious Gods, Urgest thou that fell sacrifice? Oh, where The spotless Virgin doom'd (so wild the creed) The Valkyr's airy troop to join, and glide Immortal through Valhalla's cloudy halls? BOOK IV. ARGUMENT. Scene. The Banks of Derwent Water.

Sunk was the sun, and up the slope of heaven, Like maiden on a lonely pilgrimage, Moved the meek Star of Eve; the wandering air Breathed odours; wood, and waveless lake, like man, Slept, weary of the garish babbling day. Dove of the wilderness, thy snowy wing In slumber droops not; Lilian, thou alone, 'Mid the deep quiet, wakest! Dost thou rove, Idolatrous of yon majestic moon, That like a crystal-throned queen in Heaven, Seems with her present deity to hush To beauteous adoration all the earth? The solemn silent mountain tops stand up As though to worship; the translucent streams Down th' hill sides glittering, cherish the pure light Beneath the shadowy foliage o'er them flung At intervals; the lake, so silver white, Glistens, that indistinct the snowy swans Bask in the radiance cool: doth Lilian muse To that apparent Queen her vesper hymn? Nursling of solitude, her infant couch No mother watch'd, within th' untimely grave She slept unwaking; scornful turn'd aloof Caswallon, of those pure instinctive joys By fathers felt, when playful infant grace, Touch'd with a feminine softness, round the heart, Winds its light maze of undefin'd delight, Contemptuous; he with haughty joy beheld His boy, fair Malwyn, him in bossy shield Rock'd proudly, him upbore to mountain steep, Fierce and undaunted, for their dangerous nest To battle with the eagle's clamorous brood. But she the while from human tenderness Estranged, and gentler feelings that light up The cheek of youth with rosy joyous smile, Like a forgotten lute, play'd on alone By chance-caressing airs, amid the wild Beauteously pale, and sadly playful, grew, A lonely child, by not one human heart Belov'd and loving none; nor strange, if learnt Her nature's fond affections to embrace Things senseless and inanimate: she lov'd All flow'rets that with rich embroidery fair Enamel the green earth, the odorous thyme, Wild rose, and roving eglantine, nor spar'd To mourn their fading forms with childish tears. Grey birch and aspen light she lov'd, that droop Fringing the crystal stream; the sportive breeze That wanton'd with her brown and glossy locks, The sunbeam chequering the fresh bank. Ere dawn Wandering, and wandering still at dewy eve, By Glenderamakin's flower-empurpled marge, Derwent's blue lake, or Greta's wildering glen. Rare sound to her was human voice, scarce heard, Save of her aged nurse, or shepherd maid Soothing the child with simple tale or song. Hence, all she knew of earthly hopes and fears, Life's sins and sorrows; better known the voice Belov'd of lark from misty morning cloud Blithe carolling, and wild melodious notes Heard mingling in the summer wood, or plaint, By moonlight, of the lone night-warbling bird. Nor they of love unconscious, all around Fearless, familiar they their descants sweet Tun'd emulous. For she was known by all That tenant wood or rock, dun roe or deer, Sunning his dappled side at noontide crouch'd, Courting her fond caress, nor fled her gaze The brooding dove, but murmur'd sounds of joy. One summer noon, the silvery birchen shade, Pendent above from dripping crag, her brow Veil'd from the fiery sunbeam; gems of spray Gleam'd cool around with watery rainbow-light, From a pure streamlet down its rocky bed Dashing sweet music; she on mossy couch Sate listening to the thrush, whose blithesome notes In amorous contention Echo caught Responsive. Sudden droop'd its flagging wing The timorous bird of song, and fluttering sought Soft refuge in the maiden's snowy breast. She o'er the nestling prisoner folding light Her careless vest, stood gazing, where, awhile Dark in a sun-illumin'd cloud, came down A swooping falcon: at her sight it check'd; Its keen eye bright with joy, th' admiring bird, Fearfully beauteous, floated on the air, Its silver wings, and glossy plumage grey, Glanc'd in the sun light. Up the maiden gaz'd, Smiling in pale and terrified delight, And seem'd for that lov'd warbler in her breast Beseeching mercy. 'Mid the green wood sank Th' obedient bird; she, joyous at his flight, Her bosom half reveal'd, with gentle hand Caressing smooth'd her captive's ruffled plumes. Anon a frighted thankful look around She cast—and lo a human shape stood there, Or more than human; stately on his arm The falcon sate, and proudly flapp'd his wings. She turn'd to fly, yet fled not, turn'd to gaze, Yet dared not raise her downcast eye; she felt Her warm cheek, why she knew not, blush, her hand Unconscious closer drew her bosom's fold. With accent mild the Stranger brief delay Entreated; she, albeit his gentle words Fell indistinct on her alarmed ear, Listening delay'd, and still at fall of eve Delay'd, e'en then with dim reverted eye, Slow lingering on her winding homeward path. No more in pomp of war, or vaulting steed, Joyeth the Son of Vortigern, nor feast With jocund harpings, and rich-jewell'd dames, Outshining in their pride the starry heavens. As fair the spring-flowers bloom, as graceful droops The wild ash spray, as sweet the mountain bee Murmurs, melodious breathes the twilight grove, Unheard of her, unheeded, who erewhile Visited, constant as the morning dew, Those playmates and sweet sisters of her soul. In one sole image sees the enamour'd maid Concentrated all qualities of love, All beauty, grace, and majesty. The step Of tall stag prancing stately down the glen, The keen bright fierceness of the eagle's glance, And airy gentleness of timorous roe, And, more than all, a voice more soothing soft Than wild-bird's carol, or the murmuring brook, With eloquence endued and melting words So wondrous; though unheard since eve, the sounds Come mingling with her midnight sleep, and make The damask of her slumbering cheek grow warm. And now she sits beneath the moonlight rock, Chiding the rippling waters that efface That image fancy-drawn on its pure breast, Garb, form, and feature, Vortimer; though mute, As prodigal of fondness, his bright face Seems to look up to her with tenderer love, Than wild-dove to its mate at earliest spring. Oft hath that moonlight wax'd and wan'd, since last He parted, all of him that could depart; Save what no distance could remove, the words, The look, the touch, that live within her still, The promise of return sworn on her lips. And hark it comes, his steed along the glen; She o'er the lucid mirror stooping, braids Hasty her dark-brown tresses; bashful smiles Of virgin vanity flit o'er her cheek, Tinging its settled paleness. Now 'tis near— But ne'er did Vortimer with iron hoof Bruise the green flowery sward that Lilian loves. A gentle frown of winning fond reproach Arch'd her dark eyelash, as her head she turn'd, Ah! not on Vortimer. Her father stood Before her, stern and dark, his trembling child Cheer'd nor fond word, nor greeting kiss; his arm Clasp'd round her, on his steed again he sprung. And on through moonlight and through shade he spurr'd, Like some rude hunter with a snow-white fawn His midnight prey. And all his flinty road Gleam'd like a meteor's track. Ere long the path 'Gan upward wind, the fiery courser paus'd Breathless, she faintly raising up her form; “Oh, whither bear ye me?” with panting voice, Murmur'd. Caswallon spake unmov'd, “To death.” “Death, father, death, ah didst thou say to death! Aye me! when maiden dies, the smiling morn, The wild birds singing on the twinkling spray, Wake her no more; the summer wind breathes soft, Waving the fresh grass o'er her narrow bed, Gladdening to all but her. Senseless and cold She lies; while all she lov'd, unheard, unseen, Mourn round her.” There broke off her faltering voice. Dimly her farewell glance she cast around. Never before so beautiful the lake Lay, like a sky, distinct with stars; the groves, Green banks and shadowy dells, her haunts of bliss, Smil'd, ne'er before so lovely, their last smile; The fountains seem'd to wail, the twilight mists, On the wet leaves were weeping all for her. Had not her own tears blinded her, there too She surely had beheld a youthful form Wandering the solitary glen. But loud The courser neigh'd, down bursting, wood and rock Fly backward; the wide plain its weary length Vainly outspreads; and now 'tis midnight deep. Ends in a narrow glen their fleet career. That narrow glen was pal'd with rude black rocks, There slowly roll'd a brook its glassy depth; Now in the moon-beams white, now dark in gloom. She liv'd, she breath'd, she felt, to her denied That sole sad happiness the wretched know, Ev'n from excess of feeling, not to feel. Behold her gentle, delicate, and frail, Where all around, through rifted rock and wood, Grim features glare, huge helmed forms obscure People the living gloom, with dreary light Glimmering, as of the moon from iron arms Coldly reflected: lovely stands she there, Like a blest Angel 'mid th' accurst of Hell. A voice is heard.—“Lo, mighty Monarch, here The stream of sacrifice; to man alone Fits the proud privilege of bloody death By shaft or mortal steel; to Hela's realm, Unblooded, woundless, must the maid descend; So in the bright Valhalla shall she crown For Woden and his Peers the cup of bliss.” Her white arms round her father's rugged neck Winding with desperate fondness, she 'gan pour, As to some dear, familiar, long-lov'd heart, Most eloquent her inarticulate prayers. Is the dew gleaming on his cheek? or weeps The savage and the stern, yet still her sire? But some rude arm of one, whose dreadful face She dared not gaze on, seiz'd her. Gloomy stood, Folding his wolf-skin mantle to conceal The shuddering of his huge and mailed form, Caswallon. Then again the voice came forth, “Fast wanes the night, the Gods brook no delay, Monarch of Britain, speed.” He, at that name Shaking all human from his soul, flung back The foldings of his robe, and stood elate, As boastful of some glorious deed; nor knew Barbarian blind as proud, who feels no more The mercies and affections of his kind, Casts off God's image from his darken'd soul. A sound is heard amid the silent night, A sound of broken waters; rings of light Float o'er the dark stream, widening to the shore. Homo autem quem sors immolandum obtulerat, in fontem qui ad locum sacrificiorum scaturiebat, vivus immergebatur: qui si facile efflaret animam, faustum renunciabant sacerdotes votum: moxque inde ereptum in vicinum nemus, quod sacrum credebant, suspendentes, inter Deos translatum affirmabant. Quo factum erat, ut beatum se crederet, qui eo immolatione e vivis excederet. Accidit nonnunquam reges ipsos simili sorte delectos victimari. Quod quia faustissimum regno libamen æstimabatur, totius populi multitudo cum summâ congratulatione tam insignes victimas prosequebantur. Enimvero sic defunctos non omnino mori, sed tam illos quam se ipsos immortales esse. Olaus Magnus, book iii. cap. 6. And lo, her re-appearing form, as soft As fountain Nymph by weary hunter seen, In the lone twilight glen; the moonlight gleam Falls tenderly on her beseeching face, Like th' halo of expiring Saint; she seems Lingering to lie upon the water top, As though to feel once more that light belov'd; And tremulously mov'd her soundless lips As syllabling the name of Vortimer. Then deep she sank, and quiet the cold stream, Unconscious of its guilt, went eddying on, And look'd up lovely to the gazing moon. What deepest thoughts, young Vortimer, have place Within thy secret breast? thou slowly rid'st By Eamont's alder brink, thy silver arms Through the brown copse with moonshine glittering dim. Is't that late fight by Thanet, when the fire From thine and Horsa's steel, frequent and red, Burnt the pale sea-spray? Vortimer, or Guortemir, according to Nennius, the son of Vortigern, did keep up a brave and successful warfare against the Saxons, until the return of Hengist with an overpowering force. See Nennius and Mr. Turner's Anglo-Saxon History, vol. i. p. 243, The death of Horsa I reserved for a later part of the poem. or thy kingly charge, With show of British war, to curb and check The threatening Caledonian? or what bathes Youth's cheek in bitterest and most gall-like tears; Thy father's shame, the curse that, unredeem'd By thy young valour, his once kingly name Devotes to everlasting infamy? Or is't that gentle Maid by Derwent lake, Her flower-wreath'd tresses and her pale sweet smile? How pleasant, after war and journeying fleet To Britain's Northern realm, from Kent's white cliffs, Once more to see her early gliding foot Skimming the morning dews, to hear her voice, As artless, as melodious, melt on air, Among the wood-birds' matins, to surprise Thine own dear name upon her bashful lips! What floats along the waters, a dead white Amid the glittering moonshine! where the stream Runs black beneath the thicket boughs, still white, Still slowly drifting, like a dying swan, In snowy beauty, on its watery bier? Oh, were but Lilian here! perchance its neck May struggle up, to the still waves to chant Its own soft requiem, the most gentle breath, Most fancifully, delicately sweet, That ever soothes the midnight's dewy calm. I fear that I have, not very correctly, introduced a classical vulgar error about the beauty of the notes of the dying swan, where it was not likely to prevail. Near, and more near—it takes a human shape: Some luckless maiden; haply her lov'd youth Awaits her at the well-known place, upbraids Her broken faith, as fond as Vortimer, As full of love. 'Tis closer now; he leaps From his high steed: he draws it to the shore. Scarce time for fancy or for fear, the moon Quench'd her broad light behind a rushing cloud, And utter darkness settled round. He sate In solitude, with that cold lifeless corpse; He dared not leave it, for a hideous thought Flash'd through his brain.—“Why is it like to thee, My Lilian! be it any one but thou— Cold, deathly, irremediably cold: It cannot be, and yet 'twas like: her height, Her slender waist like Lilian's, and her hair As dainty soft, and trick'd with flowers; 'tis she, And I will kiss her, pardon if I err, If stranger lips—round, smooth like thine; but oh! So coldly passive! when we parted, thine Thwarted me with a struggling bashfulness, And, won at length, with meek surrender swell'd. Wild and delirious fancy! many a maid Hath full round lips, to trick the hair with flowers 'Tis common vanity. If dead, even dead, So chilly senseless Lilian could not be To Vortimer's embrace. Oh, but for light, Though dim and scanty as a glow-worm's fire, To make me surely, hopelessly undone! Aught but this racking ignorance. Dawn forth, Thou envious sluggard, Morn! one beam, but one— Thou pitiless cold Moon!”—Morn dawn'd not yet, And pale and dusk remain'd the moonless sky. Darkness around, the dead within his arms, He sate, even as a poison'd man awaits, Yet haunted by a miserable hope, Death's manifest mortal sickness in his veins, And yearns to live or die, scarce cares he which, So one were certain. But when slow the dawn Unveil'd its filmy light, he turn'd away From that which might be Lilian's face, and pray'd Even for the hateful, dun, uncertain gloom; As though the doubtful, not quite desperate grief, Were comfort, and not lightly to be lost. It seem'd unconsciously he raised her up, Unconsciously declined his heavy eye, Where slowly brighten'd on that lifeless face The unwelcome beauty; one tress lay across, Permitting yet a miserable doubt; Move it he dare not, but the officious wind Cast it aside. As if the thought, the fear Were new, were sudden, like the lightning flash That sears the infant in its mother's arms, Smote on him the dire certainty. He clasp'd Her damp dead cheek to his.—“Thus, meet we thus, Lilian! my Lilian! silent, strange, and cold? I do not bid thee fondly gaze, nor ask Long rapturous welcoming,—but speak, but move! Lilian; ne'er thought I, I should live to loathe Thy gentle presence.—Oh, for thee, for thee Have I forsaken all my warrior trust, Been truant to my country's cause for thee. By the green Tees my murmuring camp upbraids My soft unwarlike absence—aye, upbraids! For I am past fate's utmost malice now. Shall Fame with its vain pomp, and hollow clang Of cymbal praise, allure me forth, a bland And courteous parasite in her fond train? No; hang thou there, my helm, and thou my shield Rust on yon bank, my sword, one duty more, To shape the smooth turf for my Lilian's grave; Thy bridal bed, sweet Maid, it should have been, Where thou and Vortimer had met. Thy grave Shall be my field of honour, all my palms The flowers the courteous spring shall lavish there; And I'll have glory—in my depth of woe— A wild and strange delight—in my despair— Not yet, the cold earth must not part us yet, Unfold, once, once again those dark-fringed eyes, One throb, one tremor, though it be the last In thy soft limbs—dead, senseless, icy dead!”— Thus o'er his buried Love that wretched Prince, Unknown the hell-born secret of her doom, Arraign'd blind Chance for Man's most impious sin. But southward far the savage fleet bore on. On Flamborough-head the morning sun look'd dusk Through their dim sails; where Scarborough's naked foot Spurns back, and saith, “No further,” to the waves, From cleft and cave the sullen sea-birds sprang, Wheeling in air with dizzy flight, and shriek'd Their dreary fears abroad. The Shepherd, wont To view o'er level Lindesay the broad sea, Blue trembling to the soft horizon's line, Sees, like a baleful portent from the heavens, That sable Navy warping slowly past. Th' Icenian coast Norfolk and Suffolk, the kingdom of the Iceni, of which Boadicea was Queen. (that sceptred woman's realm, Bonduca, who from her fair body wash'd The stain of Roman lust in Roman blood) Looks haggard, with distracted faces wan, Of age and youth, the woman and the child, From beach or steep cliff, gazing now to Heaven, Now on that ocean army's watery march. A brighter and more British battlement, Than tender forms of women, trembling crowds Of infants and decrepit age, from Thames To Thanet crown the pale-brow'd cliffs of Kent. As when from Aulis that immortal fleet Swept the Ægean, all the hollow beach, And every Phrygian promontory glow'd With brazen battle; here the Morning's Son, Swarth Memnon, here the invulnerable strength Of Cycnus, here the beardless Troilus, Unwounded yet by Cresseide's arrowy eyes; Here Hector, seeking through the watery route The tall Thessalian prow, with fatal thirst Furious even then the silver-footed Queen To orphan of her heaven-soul'd boy. So bold, In bright-arm'd splendour tower'd the rampart brave Of British Warriors on that pallid shore. On Thanet are the Sea-King Brethren met. Their greeting in that fiercely sportive strain That, elevate with imminent success, Scoffs at past ill.—“On Thanet's marge well met, Erle Horsa; now methinks our spacious realm Is somewhat waste and shrunken, since we last View'd its fair confines; for such noble guests And numerous as attend our royal march, Our kingdom's harbours seem too close, our land Narrow and brief for such free spirits' range. Ill husbandry! our fertile province wide To barter for this spare and meagre isle. Horsa, for anchorage and breathing space Our weary mariners must e'en go sue Their gentle Briton neighbours; haply they, Knowing our native courtesy, may cede From their abundance some fair leagues of earth.” “Ingrate and blind (cried Horsa), they forswear Our mild dominion; to their King's behest Rebellious, they proclaim the British earth The undivided, indivisible right Of their old British sires, nor may't descend Sever'd and mutilate to their British sons.— ‘They shook not off the Roman's gentle sway, To slave it to Barbarians.’—Specious terms, But with such cogent arguments enforc'd, We could but shroud us in this narrow isle From such fierce disputants; a desperate spirit Was that old Cæsar, who first planted here The tree of conquest.”—“Holds the King his faith?”— “Oh, thy fair daughter hath a soft-link'd chain For the old royal Lion; he obeys, Like a slim greyhound in a silken leash, Her eye-won empire. But there walks abroad A youngling of the brood; no blood but mine Might flesh the ravening of his dainty jaws, This Vortimer, this bright-ey'd, beardless boy. Aye, front to front I met him, but their bands Rent us asunder, and my crest-lopp'd helm, My scatter'd blood, pass'd unaveng'd. Now earth Swallow me in my wrath, Heaven's bolt sear up My constant heart, if I forget thee, Boy, Nor shear the gay sprouts of thy budding fame!”— “A child their mightiest!”—“Scornful Hengist, no; A manlier spirit rides the furious storm, One in whom bravery and counsel vie For excellence: wild battle wears the shape His will ordains; and if the rebel swerve, He forces it with his strong sword t' obey His high behest, and take the fate he gives.”— “His name—his name!”—“The Chieftain of the Vales, So sounds his title.”—Then a bitter groan, 'Twere hard to tell from what bad passion, hate Or dread, or savage hope, from Hengist's breast Burst forth; with his mail'd hand he clasp'd his head, As though to mould the discord of his thoughts To one strong mass; then, as though all resolv'd, A light and laughing carelessness relax'd Those knitted furrows, while his eager soul Clasp'd the dim future with a fearless joy. But on the mainland, in sad council, meet The Baronage of Britain, timorous hearts In hollow unsubstantial valour trick'd, While those who dare show fear, fear undisguis'd. Their first fierce rush of courage pass'd, like flame The mountain heath devouring, with fleet blaze, But transitory! they of generous thoughts, Of appetites whose sole rich draught is fame, Wanting the steadfast strength, the impulse bold Wanting of love devotional, heart-deep To their own native land; they hence, but now With power in fierce and gallant charge to sweep From Kent's fair valleys Horsa's Saxon train, Downcast in mien and mind, with prospect sad Now count that countless navy's gathering sails. Not now the rapture and the restlessness, The riding and the racing, burst and shock, And sudden triumph, or as sudden death; Now long, long wasting of the limbs and life, The circumspect cold strife, drear march, damp watch, Forepining day, and vigilant sleepless night, Eternal and interminable war, Before them spreads its wide and endless tract. Gone all soft joys, all courtly luxuries gone: The languor of the bath, the harp, the song By twilight in the lady's sleepless porch, The loitering in the sunny colonnade, The circus, and the theatre, the feast Usurping the mild midnight's solemn hours; The remains of Roman cities, villas, and baths, so frequently discovered, show that Britain, under the Romans, had attained to a high state of civilization; in some parts, no doubt, to luxury. From holier hearts, the chapel and the prayer, The matins, and melodious vesper hymn, The bridal with its gay and jocund route, The baptism with its revel, gone—all gone. The burial on cold battle field, unhymn'd, Unmourn'd, untomb'd; nor taper, tear, nor rite: Even pious commerce between God and man Broke off, save hasty prayer ere battle morn, Cold orison upon the midnight watch. Sole pillar of the quaking temple, firm, Inflexible, on the foundation deep Of his stern spirit, Samor bears the weight Of imminent danger; and his magic voice With shame, with praise, with soothing, and with scorn, Scatters the languid mists from off their souls, And from their blanch'd cheeks drives the faint dismay. What ho! a trumpet from the Thanet shore, Truce for the Saxon's embassage! His hand Outholding the white wand of peace, came on Old Cerdic, and address'd the assemblage proud. “Britons, most strange 'twill sound, while our vast fleet Affronts your pale cliffs with fierce show of war, Yet would we peace with Britain. Deem not this, In the vain arrogance of brief success, The enforc'd concession of faint fear; look round Your narrow camp, then gaze abroad, our sails Outnumber your few helms, and fear ye know No wonted tenant in the German breast. This know ye further, what we Saxons dare, That dare we nobly, openly. Far south A rich and wanton land its champaign green Spreads to the sun, there all the basking hills Glow with the red wine, there the fresh air floats So fragrant, that 'tis pleasure but to breathe, Where endless summer paints the cloudless skies; And our old Bards have legends, how of yore From that soft land bright eagles, fledged with gold, Danube or Rhine o'erflew, their Cæsars fired Our holy groves with insolent flames, and girt Our fierce free foresters with slavish chains, That scarce bold Herman The German popular name for Arminius. rent their massive links. Not to despoil a mild and gentle isle, For full fierce vengeance on Imperial Rome, Embattled Germany pours forth. Then hear, Brave islanders! our Saxon terms of peace: Ransom this province, ours by royal boon Of Vortigern, your King, at liberal price; And for your gold we cede, what deepest wounds Our German souls to part with, our revenge. With most unwonted patience will we bear Erle Horsa's camp with fierce assault o'erborne, And British wolves full-gorged with Saxon gore. Then not as foes, but friends, we disembark Our sea-worn crews; ourselves, the Chiefs of war, In solemn festival to your high Lords, Pledge on the compact our unwavering faith. But if ye still with lavish thirst desire War's crimson goblets, freely let them flow! If the fierce pastime of the fire and sword Be jocund to you, then let slip the game! Your city walls are not so tall and high, But our fleet flames may climb their dizzy towers, And revel on their pinnacles of pride; Your breast-plate not so adamantine proof, But our keen falchions to your hearts may find A mortal passage. And not we alone, Caswallon, at our call, o'er the wide North Wakes the hoarse music of his rushing cars; Then choose your bride, oh Britons, lo, each courts Your arms with rival beauties, Peace and War.” Thus half in courtesy, defiant half, To wait their answer he withdrew. Ere died His voice, ere from a single lip assent Had parted, Samor rose, and cried aloud:— “Britons! oh Britons! hinds fear fawning wolves, The peasant flies the snake that smoothly coils Round his numb foot its gay enamell'd rings; I dread a peaceful Saxon. Was't for this, Round Vortigern's tame soul that proud-ey'd Queen Wound her voluptuous trammels? did the meek, The hermit Constans, bleed for this? Oh, Peace Is like the rain from heaven, the clouds must burst, Ere earth smile lovely with its lucid dews. Peace must be won by war; swords, swords alone Work the strong treaty. Shall our slaves, who sold Their blood, their lives to Britain for base hire, On our fair provinces set now their price? Give gold! as wisely might the miser lead The robber to his treasury, and then cry, ‘Go hence, and plunder;’ 'twere to tempt, to bribe The undream'd perjury, and spread a lure, To bring the parted spoiler swiftly back. Outnumber us! and are we sunk so low To count our valour by our helmet crests?— Oh, every soul that loves his native land, It is a legion; oh what fire shall sear The hydra heads of liberty? Our earth Shall burst to bearing of as boon a crop Of sworded soldiers, as of bladed grass, And all our hills branch out in groves of steel. So thought our fathers, so they bravely strove For the bleak freedom of their steamy moors, Their black oak's fruitage coarse, and rites uncouth Of Druid, by the beal-fire's lurid flame. But we whose land refin'd and civilised, Spreads golden plenty round her marble towns; Where handmaid arts anticipate our wants, Where bloodless altars to the Lord of Hosts Arise, and his Incarnate Son. Shall we Our gifted Britain yield, our hallow'd isle To godless rude Barbarians? 'Tis not now Merely to 'scape the heaven-branded name of slaves, For licence to breathe where we choose, and wield At our own wayward will unfetter'd limbs. Oh, if we fail, free Christians must sink down To Heathen slaves, our gilded palace roofs Echo the riot of new Lords, our wives Be like base plunder, vilely bought and sold; Worse shame! worse sin! the murky Heathen groves O'er our fallen Churches their pale gloom advance; Our holy air go dim and reeking up With impious incense to blood-beverag'd Gods; The deep damnation of a Pagan creed Rot in our children's souls! Then be our peace Not hasty, as of timorous souls that snatch At every feeble reed, but stoop we to it As with a conqueror's pride, with steel-glov'd hand Seal our stern treaty. So if they depart, And with their spread sails seek their mad emprize. But while one prow dash menace on our shore, Our earth is patient of one armed hoof, Tame treaty, temporizing truce, avaunt! The foreign banner that usurps our winds, Be it a foe! strange steel that doth divert One ray of sunlight from our shores, be that The scope and centre of all British swords! So build we up our peace on the strong rock Of brave defiance, cement it with scorn, Set bright-arm'd Valour in its jealous porch Bold Warden; from our own intrinsic strength, Not from the mercy of our foes, be free.” Oh the soul's fire, of that swift element Th' intensest, spreads around, and mounts on high With unrestrain'd contagion; it hath caught In all that kingly conclave, it hath blazed. But then rose Elidure, with bashful mien, Into himself half shrinking, from his lips The dewy words persuasive dropt, and smooth, And crept into the chambers of the soul, Like the bee's liquid honey:—“And thou too, Enamour'd of this gaudy murderer, War! Samor, in hunger's meagre hour who scorns A fair-skinn'd fruit, because its inward pulp May be or black or hollow? gentle Peace May be a rich-rob'd evil; war, stern war, Wears manifest its hideousness, and bares Deformities the Sun shrinks to behold. Because 'tis in the wanton roll of chance That he may die, who desperately leaps Into the pit, with mad untimely arms To clasp annihilation? Were no path But through the grim and haunted wilds of strife To the mild shrine of peace, maids would not wear Their bridal chaplets with more joy, than I Th' oppressive morion: then th' old vaunt were wise, To live in freedom, or for freedom die. Then would I too dissemble, with vain boast, Our island's weakness; wear an iron front, Though all within were silken, soft, and smooth. For what are we, slight sunshine birds, thin plum'd For dalliance with the mild, luxurious airs, To grapple with these vultures, whose broad vans, Braced by their icy tempests, with the wind Of their strong flight would dash us down to earth. Then, Samor, eminent in strength and power, It were most proud for thee alone to break The hot assault, with single arm t' arrest The o'erwhelming ruin—ruin, ah! too sure. It were most proud; to us sad comfort; sunk, Amerc'd of all our fair, luxurious hours, Our rich abodes the wandering war-flame's feast. Samor, our fathers fear'd not death; cast off Most careless their coarse lives; with nought to lose, They fear'd no loss; too blest this state of ours, Its joyances, affections, hopes, desires, For such rash venture. Oh, then, be we not Most wretched from the fear of wretchedness? If war must be, in God's name let war be: But, oh, with clinging hand, with lingering love, Clasp we our mistress, Peace. Gold! what is gold? My fair and wealthy palace set to sale, Cast me a beggar to the elements' scorn; But leave me peace, oh, leave my country peace, And I will call it mercy, bounty, love!”— So spake he, with vain show of public zeal Blazoning his weak intent; and so prevail'd His soft and languid eloquence. Each rent The golden frontlet from his helm, cast down His breastplate's golden scales, in liberal strife Prodigal rivals at rich price to buy That baleful merchandise, their country's shame. Oh, where the royal Brethren now? the pride Serene of Emrys? where thy Dragon crest, Prince Uther? for thy voice, young Vortimer! Seal, Samor, thy prophetic lips; in vain Thou warnest, threatenest, as if heaven-inspired. Will the winds hear thee? will the rocks obey? Or hearts than wind more light, than rocks more cold? Grey Cerdic hath their faint award; they part Jocund, and light of hope; but Samor grasp'd The hand of Elidure:—“My childhood's friend, I sue thee by all joys we two have shared, Our interchange of souls, communion free Of every thought and motion of our hearts, Our infant pastimes, and our graver joys, Go not thou to this feast.”—“Doth Samor go?”— “Britain must have no danger, gentle friend, That Samor shares not; thou art noted well To hate the riotous and brawling feast. With thy fond bride, thy Evelene, await Silent the knowledge whether thou or I Have err'd in this day's council.”—“No, best friend, Samor must have no danger Elidure Shares not; oh, why this cold and gloomy dread? In the deep centre of our isle be held This dreaded banquet. Samor, ne'er thought I, While my mild blood ran constant, thine would flag, And curdle with the pallid frost of fear.” 'Tis famed, that then, albeit amid the rush Of clamorous joy unmark'd, in drearier days Remember'd, signs on earth, and signs in heaven, With loud and solemn interdict arraign'd That hasty treaty; maniacs kindled up With horrible intelligence the orbs Of their deep hollow eyes, and meaning strange Gave order to their wandering utterance: stream'd Amid the dusky woods broad sheeted flames; The blue fires on the fen at noon-day danc'd Their wavering morrice, and the bold ey'd wolves Howl'd on the sun. Life ominous and uncouth Seiz'd upon ancient and forgotten things; The Cromlechs rock'd, the Druid circles wept Cold ruddy dews; as of that neighbouring feast Conscious, the tall Stone Henge did shrilly shriek As with a whirlwind, though no cloud was mov'd In the still skies. A wailing, as of harps, Sad with no mortal sorrow, sail'd abroad Through the black oaks of Mona. Old deep graves Were restless, and arm'd bones of buried men Lay clattering in their stony cells. 'Twas faith, White women upon sable steeds were seen In fleet career 'neath the rank air; the earth Gave up no echo to their noiseless feet, And on them look'd the moon with leprous light Prodigious; haply like those slender shapes In the ice desert by Caswallon seen. From Mona to the snowy Dover cliffs, From Skiddaw to St. Michael's vision'd mount, Unknown from heaven, or earth, or nether pit, Unknown or from the living or the dead, From being of this world, or nature higher, Pass'd one long shriek, whereat old Merlin leap'd From his hoar haunt by Snowdon, and in dusk And mystic descant mutter'd all abroad, What the thin air grew cold and dim to hear. 'Tis said, rude portents in the Church of God, With insolent noises, brake the holy calm, The grey owl hooted at the noontide chaunt, The young owl clamour'd at the matin song, The pies and ravens, from the steeple top, To the priest's Benedicite moan'd back A sullen hoarse Amen; and obscene bats Around the altar candlesticks did flap Their leathern wings. Yea, from his stricken hand The white stol'd Bishop to the earth let fall The consecrated chalice; the Lord's blood Flow'd, and was mingled with th' unhallow'd dust. BOOK V. ARGUMENT. General rejoicing on account of the Peace. Banquet of Peace on Salisbury Plain, near Ambri (Ambresbury). Massacre. Samor. Stonehenge. House of Elidure. The Bright City (Gloucester). The House of Samor. Desolation. Samor's vow of Patriotism and Vengeance. Swan of the Ocean! on thy throne of waves Exultant dost thou sit, thy mantling plumes Ruffled with joy, thy stately neck elate, To welcome peace, like Angel visitant, Descending, amid joy of earth and heaven, To bless thy fair abode. The laughing skies Look bright, oh, Britain! on thy hour of bliss. In sunshine fair the blithe and bounteous May O'er hill and vale goes dancing; blooming flowers Under her wanton feet their dewy bells Shake joyous; clouds of fragrance round her float. City to city cries, and town to town, Wafting glad tidings: wide the churches throw Their flower-hung portals, resonant with pomp Of priests and people, to the Lord their prayers Pouring, the richest incense of pure hearts. With garland and with song the maids go forth, And mingle with the iron ranks of war Their forms of melting softness; gentle gales Blow music o'er the festal land from harp And merry rebeck, till the floating air Seems harmony; mute all fierce sounds of war; No breath within the clarion's brazen throat; Soft slumber in the war-steed's drooping mane. Not in the palace proud, or gorgeous hall, The banqueting of Peace; on Ambri plain The part of Salisbury Plain near Ambresbury is the place where tradition places this scene. Glitter the white pavilions, to the sun Their snowy pomp unfolding; there the land Pours its rejoicing multitudes to see Briton and Saxon, in majestic league, Mingling their blazon'd banners' streaming folds. Blithe as a virgin bridal, rich and proud As gorgeous triumph for fair kingdom won, Flows forth the festal train; with arms elate The Mothers bear their infants to behold That Hengist, whose harsh name erewhile had blanch'd Their cheeks to paleness; they their little hands Clap, smiling, half-delighted, half in dread. Upon that hated head, from virgin hands, Rain showers of bloom; beneath those hated feet Is strewn a flowery pavement; harp and voice Hymn blessings on the Saxon, late denounc'd Th' implacable, inexorable foe. Lordly they pass'd and lofty; other land Save Britain, of such mighty despots proud, Had made a boast of slavery; giant men In soul as body. Not the Goth more dread, Tall Alaric, who through imperial Rome March'd conqueror: nor that later Orient chief, Turban'd Mohammed, who o'er fall'n Byzance His moony ensign planted: they, unarm'd, Yet terrible, went haughty on, of power A world to vanquish, not one narrow isle. The hollow vault of heav'n is rent with shouts, Wild din and hurry of tumultuous joy Moves the vast throng, for lo, in perfect strength, Consummate height of manhood, but the glow, The purple grace of youth, th' ambrosial hue Of life's fresh morning, on his glossy hair, His fair and speaking features, Samor comes. His name is on the lisping infant's lips, Floats on the maiden's song; him warrior men Hail with proud crest elate; him present, deem Peace timorous mercy on the invading foe. With him the Kings of Britain, some her shame, Downy and silken with luxurious ease; Others more hardy, in whose valiant looks Were freedom and command: of princely stem Alone were absent the forsaken King And his sad Son, and those twin royal youths, Emrys and Uther; nor the Mountain Lord, With that young eaglet of his race, deigned share The unstirring luxuries of peace; save these, All Britain's valiance, princedom, and renown March'd jubilant, with symphony and song. 'Tis Noon; from his empyreal throne the Sun Floods with broad light the living plain; more rich Ne'er blaz'd his summer couch, when sea and sky, In royal pomp of cloudy purple and gold, Curtain his western chambers; breathing men Gorgeous and numberless as those bright waves Flash, in their motion, the quick light; aloof The banqueters, like Gods at nectar feast, Sit sumptuous and pavilion'd; all glad tones From trembling string, or ravishing breath or voice, In clouds of harmony melt up to Heaven; O'erwhelming splendour all of sight and sound, One rich oppression of eye, ear, and mind. 'Tis Midnight: in thick darkness, heavy, chill, In silence rigid, deep and breathless, stands On the wide plain one lonely man. Wan light, From dim decaying firebrand in his grasp, Feebly, with gleam inconstant, shows his mien Hopeless, too haughty to despair: His eye, As watching some dark foe, is wandering round: Yet seems he one more fear'd than fearing; rent His robes' rich splendour; and his ponderous arm, With its strange weapon wearily declin'd, Bears token of rude strife—though rude, though fierce, By thy brow's pride, thou sad and stately Man! No faint inglorious craven hast thou shrunk, In dread of death, or avarice base of blood. At that dead hour, in Cæsar's city Salisbury.—Sarisburga, qu. Cæsaris burga. gates The Briton wives and mothers sate; at eve, They from the plain had home returned, to rock Their infants' rosy sleep, or trim the couch For him belov'd and loving; some, from joy Sleepless, and in no sad impatience, sate Watching the falling shadows; slumbering some, From weariness of pleasure, in light dreams Liv'd o'er again the morning's jocund hours. That hour, one horn with long and solemn blast Went wailing up the heavens; less shrill, less drear, Blew through the fatal Roncesvalles' pass, In after times, Roland's deep bugle, heard Dolorous, so poets feign, on Paris' wall. From the Morgante of Pulci. The air seem'd shivering where the knell pass'd on, As with a cold wind shudder'd the thick trees. But those fond women hail that brazen sound, Joy's harbinger, sweet signal of return; As the soft maid her lover's moonlight lute, They drink in its dire harshness, busy round Gazing, if aught neglected, careless aught Belie the welcome, or to wakening child Smile the glad tidings, or along the walls People the dim air with the forms they love. Oh, fond of fancy! credulous of hope! Ye hear but music in that horn; but see, In the dim tumult of yon moving lights, Your husband's swift return. The slow delay Is now a lengthen'd rapture: steps are heard, And figures indistinct are in the gloom Advancing; yet no festal pomp proclaim'd By music's merry breath, but mute and slow, As from dark funeral: haply wearied all With the long revel day. Ye fondly trace Some well-known gesture, dear familiar step, Each boastful of her lover's speedier pace. Saxon the first, how wearily slow they pass! Still are they Saxon, Saxon still, the last Saxon! in wonder they, not yet in fear, Question the dark air with their searching eyes, Incredulous arraign the deepening gloom, That with an envious melancholy shroud Hides the long-look'd for, late-returning. Them, Ah, deeper darkness covers; to their homes Ne'er to return again! Lo, all at once The bloody knives, in every Saxon hand Borne boastful and aloft, their sanguine light Flash murtherous; known is all ere aught is fear'd. “Of this kind of weapon they had two sorts, the one whereof being long were worn for swords, and the other being short, as hangers or sword-knives, and these they called hand-seaxes, and such they were which after their coming into Britain, they had still in use, and did weare privately hanging under their long skirted coates; wherewith, at a banquet on Salisbury plaine where Hengistus had envited king Vortiges, and about 300 of his nobles, the watch-word, Nem eowr seaxes, that is, take your seaxes, being given, were all of them suddenly slain.” —Verstegan, Restitution of Decayed Intelligence, p. 22; see also p. 130. “Amongst other of the Britains, there was one Edol, earle of Gloucester, (Eldulph de Samor), or (as others say) Chester, which got a stake out of an hedge or elsewhere, and with the same so defended himself, and laid about him, that he slew seventeen of the Saxons, and escaped to the town of Ambrie, now called Salisburie; and so saved his own life.” —Holinshed, b. v. c. 5. I have made Ambri, Amesbury, and Salisbury different towns. And yet are there unfaded on their brows The crowns ye wove so gaily. From these walls, At morn, three hundred breathing valiant men Went proudly forth—in solitary life Moves o'er the plain that one majestic shape, Like Spirit of Vengeance o'er some ghastly land That scoff'd erewhile, in high portentous guilt, The slumbering of God's wrath; now blasted lies, Infecting with the ashes of its wreck The late-chastising heavens. So lone, so dark, But pale with human sorrows at his heart, The King of that Bright City in the Vales Walks the waste gloom; around him the night winds Speak voices from the dead, and oft he turns, Brandishing defiance on the air, and smites Some seeming Saxon with his smouldering brand. Now rests he in that old mysterious ring, The dateless and the numberless Stonehenge, It is said that no one has ever been able to count the stones of Stonehenge. That is, and hath been, whence or how, none knows. But even the Master Druid with slow dread Its dangerous precincts trod, though noontide bright Was revelling in the heavens, and holiest harps Purified the calm air: like the vast wreck Of some old world the shadowy temple rose, Shapeless magnificence! Here souls profane Deem'd rites so potent held, as made the oaks Stand still and motionless 'mid the wild storm, And with a light, nor of the stars nor moon, Sheeted the midnight heavens: deem'd some, more sage, Th' Invisible his cloudy presence here Embodied, and with wisdom heavenly and high Full feasted the tranc'd soul; all fled the place And fear'd the more, unknowing what they fear'd. Amid those stony giants that uptower In massy darkness, or in the wind's rush Seem swaying on their dizzy balance, stands, If virtue of aught earthly may feel awe, Awe-struck the Christian. Now his calmer soul Has time for grief, for memory, o'er him flows Deep-lulling quiet; here the light and gay Had felt a motion on their lips like prayer, Nor marvel then that holy thoughts oppress'd With suppliant ecstasy the Christian soul. “Merciful! by whose will mine arm hath pav'd With the strewn corpses of my murderous foes A dismal passage, while around me Death Mow'd Britain with his secret scythe! oh God, I thank thee, if I die, a warrior's death May be my brave distinction: if this life Be worthy thy upholding, though all lost, The friendships and the prides, that made its course Blissful and bright, I thank thee for my life: Thank thee, that yet on British earth shall breathe A Briton, resolute on that last crag, That knows not the rude Saxon's tread, to rise Erect in stately freedom, and uplift The dim yet fatal beacon of revenge. Or deign'st thou for thy minister of wrath To choose this humble frame, I not with prayer Vain and presumptuous summon from the clouds Thy thunders, nor invoke prodigious Death To smite my foes. Hopes perishable man, At his wild bidding, thou the laws wilt burst Wherewith thou fetterest thy Omnipotence? Harden to stern endurance these frail limbs, With adamantine patience sheathe my soul, That nor pale shrinking of the coward flesh, Nor inward palsying turn from its brave scope Th' aspiring spirit; grant thou this sole prayer, And I thus lone, thus desolate, proclaim, Single, yet dauntless, to yon Saxon host Stubborn defiance, resolute to bear The wreck of Britain with unstooping neck.” Now over all the orient sky, the Morn Spread rosy in her youthful light: as fair, As bright her rising on this plain of death, As yesterday, when festal multitudes Greeted her dawn; so vain the boast of man, That earth, and air, and sky, their mimic hues Borrow from his fantastic woes and joys. Then o'er the plain began his lonely way The Warrior, on his brow the unheeded wind Fann'd freshness, and the wandering lark unheard, Quiver'd her blithe song, like an airy voice, Bathing in light. Anon a dale beneath Open'd, and slow withdrew the misty veil, That o'er her hamlets' roofs and bowery trees Ting'd with a tranquil azure the thin air. Along the winding path he roves, that none, Save feet habituate to its maze, could thread, Heedless that here to Elidure's green home He came, unweeting visitant. Within, Breathless, as though she listen'd in her sleep, Close to the door, as jealous lest some ear Earlier than her own should catch the sound Of Elidure's returning tread, or voice Anticipate the welcome of her own, Reclin'd his bride, soft Evelene. That step Up from the pillowing hand her flushing cheek Waken'd, or ere the threshold he o'erpast, The form yet indistinct to her quick sight, Her fond upbraiding murmur'd. “Truant Lord, Art thou too chang'd, thou too of midnight feast Enamour'd? time hath been the rosy cup, Thou Saxon in thy revels! had look'd pale To Evelene's cheek.”—'Tis wretched solace, yet 'Tis solace in the drear extreme of grief, To find one human heart whose deeper woe Makes weakness of our wailing. Though alone Of the fray's dizzy tumult lay distinct Elidure's image on the Wanderer's soul, His image as beneath the Saxon steel Dying, he struggled back to life from joy To see his mightier friend with fiery brand Piercing his path of flight; less bitter seem'd His cup of woe, when from him sprang that bride, Nor knew him; knew him but no Elidure. Then sued for tidings, and with all her soul Listen'd, but could not hear; mistrusting all While yet but fearing, but when all assur'd, Mistrusting even her fears, even then to hope Clinging with desperate energy of soul. Her Samor left in that dead night of mind, When madness were a comfort; all wild whirl, All dizzy hurry of rack'd sense, were bliss, Were transport, to that blank and dismal void, When one incessant miserable thought Becomes the life, the being of the spirit. Him scared no Saxon clarion, the drear blast Winding of fleet pursuit; his soul recalled His own, his wedded Emeric, her babes Hushing, while greedily with ear and heart She drinks each sound, that busy babbling fame Spreads on the wandering winds; the fleetest steed Of Elidure bestriding, still he moves A tardy laggard to his soul's desire. Sedulous each throng'd haunt of man he shuns With jealous speed, and still from town and tower Came blithely forth the jubilant hymns of peace; Still unextinguish'd their glad brilliance, wan'd In morn's grey mists the yellow festal fires. Day pass'd, day sank; 'tis now the dewy eve. Beneath him, in the soft and silent light, Spread the fair Valleys; mead and flowery lawn, With their calm verdure interspers'd, allay The forest's ponderous blackness, or retire Under the chequering umbrage of dim groves, Whose shadows almost slumber: far beyond Huge mountains, brightening in their secret glens, Bathe their cold peaks in the red setting sun. Sweeps through the midst broad Severn, deep and dark His monarchy of waters, their full flow Still widening, as he scorn'd to bear the main Less tribute than a sea; or inland roll'd Ambitious ocean, of his tide to claim The wealthy vassalage. High on their marge Shone the Bright City, in her Roman pomp, Of bath, and theatre, and basilic, Smooth swelling dome, and spiring obelisk, Glittering like those more soft and sunny towns, That bask beneath the azure southern skies In marble majesty. Silent she stands In the rich quiet of the golden light. The banner on her walls its cumbrous folds Droops motionless. But Samor turn'd aloof, Where lordly his fair dwelling's long arcade On its white shafts the tremulous glittering light Cherish'd, and, starry with the river dews, Its mantle of gay flowers the odorous lawn Down sloped, as in the limpid stream to bathe. No watch-dog, with glad bark and fawning joy, His Lord saluted. Samor mark'd it not. No menial caught the slack rein from his hand, He heeded not. No swift familiar step Forth started at his coming; face of joy Brightened not—vacant all; yet heeds he not. No infants, in their giddy tottering speed, Cling round his knees. So early at their rest, Thought the fond father. Emeric's chamber door Stands open; he but paused his name to hear Low mingled with her murmur'd orisons. All hush'd as in a tomb; perchance she sleeps, At his long absence heartsick. He the folds Gently withdrawing of his nuptial bed, As with the amorous violence of his lips To wake her to delicious fear, bends down. Cold, cold as marble, the forsaken bed Received the fervent pressure. Back he sprung, And strange, like one that moveth in his sleep, Stood with loose arms and leaden listless gaze. Unconscious, to the city walls, far seen From that high chamber, rove his eyes: behold Against the Sun's last light a wandering breeze Swells up the heavy banner; in the gleam The White Horse of the Saxon shakes his mane. Then felt he the blank silence, then perceiv'd The tumult, and rude disarray that marr'd The face of his fair dwelling. Forth he rush'd, As eager that his soul at one wild draught Might glut itself with perfect woe, all ill Exhausted, laugh all future griefs to scorn. Cradle and infant's couch with frantic hand Hurrying he explores; the sad chill void Almost delights. Now on the river brink He watches yon huge forms that pace the walls, Saxon their long black lances, Saxon helms Nod o'er their lofty brows' terrific gloom. Lo! at his feet, beneath a primrose bank, Half veil'd, and branching alder that o'er-droop'd Its dark green canopy, a slumbering child— If slumber might be call'd, that but o'erspread A wan disquiet o'er the wither'd cheek; Choked the thin breath that through the pallid lips Scarce struggled; clos'd not the soft sunken eye. Well Samor knew her, of his love first pledge, First, playfullest, and gentlest: he but late Luxurious in the fulness of his woe, Clings to this last hope like a drowning man, Not yet, not yet in this rude world alone. Lavish of fond officious zeal, he bathes With water from the stream her marble brow, Chafes her; and with his own warm breath recals The wandering life, that like a waning lamp Glimmer'd anon, then faded: but when slow Unfix'd her cold unmeaning eye regain'd Brief consciousness, powerless her languid arm Down fell again, half lifted in his hair To wreathe as it was wont, with effort faint Her harden'd features sadly strove to smile. The half-formed murmurs of her lips began Intelligible to his ear alone. “And thou art come—too late—yet thou art come,”— He, soothing her with hope he knew most false, Slow modell'd from her broken faltering voice One sad continuous story.—“'Twas at eve We went to rest, I never slept so soft; Our mother lull'd us with assurance sweet Of thy returning.—By and by I woke, But the bright morning was not shining fair, Nor the birds singing as they us'd. I saw, By a dim dusky light, huge iron men With hair like fire, and their fierce voices spake Strange language: of my prayers I thought, and strove My eyes to close, still those grim-visag'd men Stood in the wavering darkness, by the light Of their blue weapons—then they went away. I crept out to my mother's couch; she lay Asleep, but not as I have seen her sleep, When I have stol'n at morn to look on her, And thou hast laid me by her quiet side. She shiver'd in her sleeping, and her skin Was chilly to the touch, yet, oh! I long'd To sleep like her—for those fierce shapes came back. Before their rugged faces I felt cold As in the snow time; my eyes could not see, Oh, but I heard a dizzy sound, like shrieks Of many voices all at once. I thought Rude hands were busy on my mother's couch, As though to bear her thence—yet woke she not. Oh Father, I have never looked on death, But she was dead, I felt that she was dead. I could not breathe, yet from my thirsty throat My voice was bursting, then down o'er me fell The foldings of the couch—long, long it seem'd, Ere from that cumbrous weight I struggled forth. Then all was silent, all except the dash Of distant oars; I cried aloud, and heard But my own voice, I search'd, yet found I none; Not one in all these wide and lofty halls, My mother, my sweet brothers gone, all gone. Almost I wish'd those fierce men might return To bear me too in their dread arms away. Hither I wander'd, for the river's sound Was sweeter than the silence that came cold Over my bosom, since the Sun hath shone, Yet it seem'd dark—but oh, 'tis darker now, Darker, my Father, all within cold, cold. The soft warmth of thy lips no more can reach This shuddering in my breast—yet kiss me still.” Vain, all in vain, that languid neck no more Rises to meet his fondness, that pale hand Drops from his shoulder, that wooed voice hath spent Its last of sweetness; this alone remain'd That could enhance his agony, baffled hope. Quiet and cool the deep tide at his feet Rolls with a tranquil murmur; one lone gleam Still lingering from the sunken Sun, beneath The moving surface, lightens its cold depth. How pleasant in its secret caves to quench The soul, the body's fever; to cast off This restless, trembling consciousness, that clings Enamour'd to its anguish, sedulous To nurse its own disquiet: not to feel, Though cast by wandering waves on Emeric's grave; Though Saxon barks triumphant bound above, To feel not, and have freedom though in death. For why this barren wilderness of earth Still haunt, man's pity, and the enemy's scoff; Why to the wearying wretchedness of life Cling with a coward fondness?—but a step To quiet—to forgetfulness, a step. But alien to proud Samor those base thoughts Startled his nature; his soul burned with shame, That such unholy musings dare intrude On its sad sanctity; upright he sprung; Oh, not in vain a Christian, with clench'd hand And inward rack convulsive of choked pain, Forc'd calmness to his brow: his hollow voice Assumed a mournful fortitude.—“Oh thou, Glorious in thy prosperity of crime, Hengist! and thou, that barter'st thy old fame For sweet lascivious chambering, hast unking'd Thy stately soul within the wreathing arms Of that fair Saxon, in loose dalliance soft To steep the inebriate sense! on Samor's state Look, and be pale with envy; he dare stand Lofty beneath yon starry throne of God, And bless him that his fate is scant and poor In joys like yours, by all your pomp, your bliss, Enamour'd of his misery; still he feels The haughty solace of disdain; still soothes The madness of his grief by pitying you. Nor yet, oh impotent of cruelty! I am not utterly from this dark world Estrang'd and outcast: gone, for ever gone, Those exquisite delights of purest hearts, That summer sunshine of the soul, sweet love, That makes life what we dream of heaven; yet still Hardier, severer joys remain. Oh reft Of all thy brave, thy princely, of my faith, Thou hast a stronger need—be thou my bride, Oh Britain, to thy wreck I proudly wed The sadness of my widowhood, and bid Pale bridemaids to our nuptials, holy Wrath And sacred Retribution; I invoke Death, that dark minstrel from expiring mounds Of Saxons, to awake our bridal hymn; And spread for torch light on our spousal eve Wild gratulation of their funeral fires. “And thou, oh stainless denizen of heaven, Soft soul of my lost Emeric, endure Though jealous my new bride bereave thee still Of the tumultuous day, the midnight hour I consecrate to thee; then glide thou down, Like moonlight on the darkness' raven wing. And oh, if human passion, human love, Stain the pure essence of immortal spirits, Leave heaven in heaven; earth's frailer loveliness Resuming, chaste mild fondness, timorous warmth, Visit my desert fancy. Him by day, Savage and merciless, with soul of steel, And pale brow clouded with a nation's cares, Shall midnight find an amorous dreamer fond, A dotard on a dim unreal shade.” Then o'er what was so rosy, playful, warm, Now pale, now changeless, icy cold, the girl Whose blue eyes danc'd with rapture, whose light step Was consort to the air-roving winds, yet loath To part from what he shudder'd to behold, Heaps Samor the light earth; ere o'er her face He placed the primrose knot, once stooped his lips, And started to find cold, what he knew dead. Now closed that mournful office, nearing fast Is heard a dash of oars, and at his side Forth leap'd an armed Saxon, with rais'd arm Menacing; but Samor down with scornful strength The grim intruder dash'd to earth, and fix'd His stern heel on his neck, and stood in act The life to trample from the gasping trunk. Sudden withdrawn his angry tread, he spake, “Thee first of Saxon race, thee last, this arm Spares, not of mercy, but as meet to serve My soul's all-righteous purpose; go unscath'd, And tell to Hengist, tell thy Lord, who robs The Lion's den, should chain the Lion first; Add, Samor is abroad.”—Then to the boat He sprang, and pass'd to Severn's western shore. BOOK VI. ARGUMENT. The Voice heard throughout Britain. Submission of Britain. The Unknown. The Avenger. His exploits related in a Banquet of the Saxons. Offa the Jute. Abisa, the Brother of Hengist. His Slave and Mistress, Myfanwy. Combat of Abisa with the Avenger. Morning. The Camp. Myfanwy sets forth to seek the body of Abisa. Offa. The Avenger. A voice o'er all the waste and prostrate isle Is heard, an awful voice; the hill, the dale, Forest and mountain, heath and ocean shore Treasure its mystic murmurs; all the winds From the bleak moody East to that soft gale That wantons with the summer's dewy flowers, Familiar its dark burthen waft abroad. Is it an utterance of the earth? a sound From the green barrows of the ancient dead? Doth fierce Cassivelan's cold sleep disdain That less than Cæsar with a master's step Walk his free Britain? Doth thy restless grave, Bonduca, to the slavish air burst ope, And thou, amid the laggard cars of war, Cry, “Harness and away!” But far and wide, As when from marish dank, or quaking fen, Venomous and vast the mists uproll, and spread Pale pestilence along the withering land: So sweeps o'er all the isle his wasting bands The conqueror Saxon; he, far worse, far worse His drear contagion; that the body's strength Wastes, and with feverish pallor overlays The heaven-shap'd features; this the nobler soul With slavery's base sickliness attaints. Thames rolls a Saxon tide; in vain delays Deep Severn on Plinlimmon's summits rude His narrow freedom, tame anon endures Saxon dominion: high with arms uplift, As though he march'd o'er necks of prostrate kings, Caswallon, on the southern shore of Trent, Drives onward, he nought deeming won, while aught Remains unwon. But still that wonderous voice, Like vulture in the grisly wake of war, Hovers, and flings on air its descant strange, “Vengeance and Vigilance!”—in van, in rear, Around, above, beneath, the clouds of Heaven Enshroud it in their misty folds; earth speaks From all her caves, “Vengeance and Vigilance!” Aye, at that sound the Briton crest assumes High courage and heroic shame; he wears With such bold mien his slavery, he might seem Lord over fortune, and with calm disdain Clashes his fetters, like proud battle arms. Without a foe o'er this wide land of foes The Saxon marches. City, tower, and fort On their harsh hinge roll back their summon'd gates, But with such sullen and reluctant jar, Submission seems defiance. Though to fear Impassive, scarce the Victor dares unfurl Banner of conquest on the jealous air. Less perilous were frantic strife, were wrath Desperate of life, and blind to death, or hate, Of being struck all heedless, so it strike, Than this high haughty misery, baffling still Fierce woe by brave endurance; which confronts With cold and stern contentedness all ill, Outrage, and insult, ravage, rape, and wreck, That dog barbaric Conqueror's march of war. 'Tis like the sultry silence, ushering forth The thunder's cloudy chariot; rather like The murky smothering of volcanic fire Within its rocky prison; forth anon Bursts the red captive, to the lurid heaven Leaps up, and with its surging dome of smoke Shuts from the pale world the meridian Sun. But in their camp, in fierce divan and full, The lordly robbers sate, assemblage proud, Ethling, and Erle, and King, for council met, For council and carousal; De pace denique ac bello plerumque in conviviis consultant; tanquam nullo magis tempore aut ad simplices cogitationes pateat animus, aut ad magnas incalescat. Tac. Germ. so they deem'd The drunken sense would hardier deeds resolve; And the bold revel of the blood enflame The soul to nobler valour, strong desire In fierce embrace to meet that mistress dark, Danger. Hoarse din of merriment around Rose, with meet music blending loud and deep. But Horsa, kindling with disdainful mirth His broad bright eye, 'gan scoff with rugged jest. “Ill have we done, though for one sumptuous feast This spacious isle be ours, ill have we done;— That in our prodigal and heedless waste Of those tall high-born Britons spared we none To tilt at with our idle spears, and scare The frost and slumber from our sluggish hearts. Now hang we up our banners to disport In the smooth breeze, our armour's steeled clasps To summons soft of Lady's tender hands Surrender; or go joust the hardy oaks For pastime. Oh, along these velvet plains To prance 'mid timorous hinds with their pale souls In their white faces, heralds crouching low, With looks beseeching, voices meek, clasp'd hands: 'Tis tame and wearisome as at dead noon To rock upon the flat and hazy sea.” “This too,” cried hoary Cerdic; this bright sword Loathes its long Christian fast, yet not despairs Erewhile to glut with banquet rich and full Its ravening blade; for trust me, fiery Erle, Many a fierce steed hath brook'd the brazen curb, That chaf'd anon, from his high seat to dust Hath shaken his bold rider; Erle, I read In yon bow'd foreheads sterner characters Than abject, tame allegiance, homage base: There the firm purpose, meditation deep, And study of revenge.”—A bitter laugh Came with the fierce reply, “Shall Horsa watch The shifting in the visage of a slave; I issue forth my mandate, and 'tis done, Whether with cloudy or with sunshine brow I know not and regard not.”—Cerdic's voice, Ruffled to somewhat of prophetic tone: “Not, Horsa, to the stones, the deaf dull stones, Nor the cold current of the senseless winds Speaks that wild orator, the Man, whose paths Are hidden as the ways of fate; unknown Who knoweth all, who seeth all unseen; Nor, like the lightning's shaft, his presence dread Divulges, but to shatter, but to slay. Whose breath beneath the soft dove's snowy down Might breathe a soul of power to soar above The falcon's pitch of pride. I tell thee, Erle, This soft effeminate Britain to our sway Gentle and pliant as a willow wand, Will that dark Man uprear a ponderous Mace To crush our infant empire.”—“Man! hath man Curdled the blood of Offa?” cried aloud A wrathful voice, “and made his dauntless soul Patient of base and pale and trembling fear? And Offa lives, lives shameless of his shame, Amid his peers with unblench'd front to say, These knees have quail'd, these stubborn joints have felt The aspen's coward fluttering, and the Sun That saw his flight, hath seen not his revenge. Cerdic, the name of perishable man Thou dost belie, so titling beings dim; Viewless and formless denizens of air, That sport and dally with the human shape, Themselves to death impregnable. We swore, Gurmund and Sigvart, Ælla, Attilar, And other six, than whose no German arm Sways heavier the long lance, nor German foot Treads firmer battle's crimson paths,—I speak, Fiery-soul'd Horsa, to thy front; to thine, High-sceptred Hengist! mortal steel we swore Should choke that daring Wanderer's clamorous breath. Sage oath! as to adjure our souls, and vow Th' irregular mad ocean our word ‘Peace’ Should hearken, and abase his cresting waves. But gaily went we forth with brand and bow, Like hunters to the chase, scoffing our prey. ‘Now if he meet us in his mortal shape, Let him melt back into his native air; Then shall he 'scape’—high o'er our path a rock Hung beetling, from its summit came a voice, ‘Behold him!’—with the voice a fragment vast, An earthquake scarce had rent it from its base. Two stately necks to the low earth sank down, And o'er them that huge mass lay stern and still, Like an old giant's monument. But we Leap'd onward, Ælla met the dark unknown, Heavy with ruin hung his arm in air, But in his valiant heart a javelin stood, Drinking the crimson life. Still on we swept, Many a wild league o'er moor and marish swamp, Forest and wold, and still our pathway lay O'er the warm corpses of our foremost peers. The sole survivors of our host, we came, Sigvart and Offa; on the giddy brink Of precipice abrupt the Conqueror paus'd, As weary with his prowess, our defeat, To mock us with the calmness of his rest. ‘Now come what will,’ cried Sigvart, ‘come what may, Or thou, or I, or both.’—Then on he sprung: Yet not the more relax'd that shape of gloom Its stern contemptuous quiet, his arm wav'd With motion less of strife than proud command, And then of Sigvart's fall the deep abyss Sent up a hollow sound. I fled, proud Peers, I say again, I fled; and, or disdain'd That being dark a lone and single foe, Or by the shielding of our mightier gods, I 'scap'd.”—“I too (cried Hermingard), I too Of that mysterious Wanderer have known The might and insolent mercy. I had stray'd Into a fabric fair, it seem'd a fane Of Christian gods, rich-crested pillars rang'd On either side, above the hollow roof, Aye lessening, seem'd to melt into the air On which it floated.—High uprear'd there shone An altar, bright with chalice, lamp, and cup, All of the flaming gold. I rush'd to seize, An arm was on my neck, that dash'd me down Like a soft infant; then a vengeful voice Struck on my dizzy ears.—‘But that thy blood Would dye this holy pavement with foul stain, Heathen! thy soul and mortal shape were rent Asunder.’—As I fled, I turn'd—reclin'd Low by that altar on his knees, all quench'd Fierce wrath and fiery menace, drooping all Stern pride of mastery, triumph, and high scorn, That wild Unknown, calm, not with weariness; Gentle, but not with sleep. Majestic light Beam'd on the quiet of his heavenward brow, Yet human tears stood glittering in his eyes. My thoughts were vengeance, but the cold clear air Went creeping up my veins, an awful frost Drank up the languid current of my blood, And unrevenged I fled that tranquil Man.” Up sprang young Abisa, and beauteous scorn Curl'd his smooth cheek—“in tumult or in calm; But have he blood within his beating veins, Mine is a steel of such a searching thirst, 'Twill drain its crimson source.”—“Thou! wanton boy.” “Thou! thou! (cried Offa) with thy mother's milk Yet white within thy beardless cheek.”—“Proud Jute, The stem of Woden is a mounting tree, Its saplings soar to meet the golden Sun, While tamer shrubs creep with base trail on earth. Hengist, my King, my Brother! by our Sire I swear, that ne'er again metheglin cup Shall sparkle on these lips, till I have met This mystic deity of Offa's fear.” Then on the Monarch turn'd all eyes; he sate In darkness, or by chance, or art, the lamps Stream'd bright and yellow down the festal board, But fell no ray within his folded robe. Yet wore not Hengist on his brow his soul, High spake he from its cold and stately calm, Law to the lawless, to the dauntless dread; But his were rarer qualities of power, Dominion o'er himself; deep, deep within Dwelt all the stormy passions; by no eye Pierc'd in its dark abiding, lay the spirit With all its secret family of lusts. Though now there seem'd beneath his royal crown A faint uncertain paleness, as of fear Not wholly quell'd, and on his cheek and lip Hover'd a quivering motion, ere he spake, But cool his speech.—“Presumptuous youth, thy oath, Though wild, is holy—Woden guard thee well! Yet stand'st thou forth alone? the time hath been When the brave frenzy of rash daring spread, A broad contagious flame, through all our camp, Till scarce a sword endured its sluggish sheath. Nor needed Saxon king, as now, to gild Fair danger ere it pleas'd, as now, proclaim Rich guerdon to the warrior, who aspires To rival Woden's blood, and be the peer Of Abisa in peril and renown. More lofty duties fetter thee and me, High Horsa”—(for the fiery warrior's hand Had started to his sword's familiar hilt) Rob we not of their fame the valiant Erles.” No seat was vacant—not a voice was heard— As he were single in his shame, sate each, Nor dared on his compeers to look, in fear Soul might be there more dauntless than his own. Blank silence all! but loud that silence spake, Samor! not undeserved thy title proud, Avenger! by thy country's Conquerors thou Magnificently deified; so soar'd Thy mortal virtue o'er their tamer Gods. Not that the vassal elements thy sway Obey'd, nor beings of the middle air Stoop'd on their glistening wings to work thy will; Avenger! but for thee, the Almighty wrought Most marv'lous, most mirac'lous; in thy soul, That nobler field, high wonders manifold Labour'd to light and lustre: for what thought, Unwing'd by inbreath'd Godhead, e'er might dream Of glory to be born from this broad night Of desolation and deep darkness, strive For faint impalpable, and distant good, Through the thick clouds of evil and of woe, Strong, stately, constant, like an eagle set To drink the last light of the parting sun? What heart of earthly clay, that near imbib'd Holier and purer ether, might endure Danger, dismay, despair, all ills, that wring Man's inmost spirit with anguish? not alone Fierce wrong and insult of triumphant foe, But worse, far worse, from those our friends misdeem'd, Pity of calm, cold cowards, or rude scorn From sleek and smiling slaves; or scoff and mock At our hard sufferings from those ingrate hearts For whom we suffer. But thou still didst strive, Didst still endure, and hope against all hope: And therefore in thy dark and silent deeds Beam'd manifest God's Spirit; till in thee Even the base body that for ever clouds The nobler energies, its state infirm Shook off, and by communion close assum'd The soul's immortal essence; or the soul A climate and peculiar atmosphere Spread round its weaker instrument of power. Hence human accidents of heat and cold, Famine and thirst, wasting and weariness, Unharming fell upon thy tranquil frame, Like flakes of snow upon th' unbroken lake; Thus didst thou pass most fearless, and most fear'd; By virtue, and thy foeman's dread, array'd In attributes of strong divinity; Danger became thy safety, thy renown Grew from thy utter desperate wretchedness. But now the more that Saxon youth enjoy'd His solitude of glory; forth he springs Hasty, lest valorous repentance fire Some rival Erle of half his peril yet To wrong him. In his tent, soft languid sounds Expiring on her falling lute, arose To welcome home her Lord his beauteous slave; His slave! is that her slavery, round his neck The snowy girdle of her arms to wreathe? To catch a master's mandate doth she raise The bashful fringes of her eyes, and meet Those glances of no lordly scorn, that soothe Her gentle wayward angriness of love, Soothe, dare not chide, that coldness faint and brief That would be wooed, but sweeter to be won? Nor dares not she withhold that arm, uprais'd From their high stand the furniture of fight Glaive, corslet, morion, to displace; her touch Now clings with soft resistance, playful now Thwarts his stern purpose.—“Oh, remove not them; In hours of absence thou too dearly lov'st, They are my comfort, my companions they, My all but thou: the dusky shades of eve Brown o'er their radiance steal, and there array A bright and armed man, th' officious air Gives motion, and with all thy graceful pride Shakes the light plumage; thou art there, in spite Of thy own tardy lingering, thou art there. Oh, I have woke at midnight, when my soul With thee hath been a wanderer through sad fields, 'Mid death and battle, though my lightest touch Had prov'd thee by my side, my timorous hand Lack'd courage with that dangerous proof to front My unsubstantial fears. Oh then, if light Of star or moon on their blue surface gleam'd, Or wind awoke them into sound, again Calm on my pillow droop'd my cheek to rest, Secure to find thee sweetly slumbering there. Yet, yet unwon, oh, lighten that cold brow, And I will sing the soft and sleepy song That makes a woman's of thy angry eyes, Lulls the rude tumult in thy troubled breast, Leaving nought there but melody and me.” Then started she to feel how hard and cold Between her and her bosom's resting place The corslet lay, by stealth her fond embrace Supplanting; gently his one arm declin'd Over her neck, in careless fondness hangs, Busy the other, its rude task performs, Linking the breastplate's clasps; now holds he back From her approaching lips his cheek, to fix The weighty morion; but her garrulous grief Paus'd not—“At midnight! now! oh brave misdeem'd, Misdeem'd, who but the open day would front With his bold armour; who save I would love, I, weak and brainsick, one whose valour shrouds Its prowess in the cloudy gloom of night? Oh not, oh not to war, thou goest to win Some lovelier or some newer bride. Go, go, Though faithless, barbarous, cruel, cold to me, Yet make not her too wretched, make not her Heartsick with sad expectance.”—But her arms Belied her desperate language, closer clasp'd With more than maiden strength.—“Oh, stony heart! And I for thee forsook my infant home, Where all my steps were music, all my smiles Glad sunshine to my parents' wintry blood, That glanc'd like summer waters at my sight: For thee did violence to my virgin fame: By war's rude force might I have seem'd enthrall'd. A luckless, pitied damsel; my fond heart Ill brook'd the coarse reproach of ravisher Should couple with a name so dear as thine. At night-fall fled I to thee; even as now The stars shone beauteous, and a kindly gloom Curtain'd our meeting even as now; no change From soft and fond and tender, but in thee.”— “Peace, trembler, peace! to-morrow's dawn shall hail, Borne in the shield of honour, on the necks Of his tall peers, thy Abisa; no voice Silent, no quiet in the troubled air, Restless with his hymn'd triumph, Offa's heart Sick with wan envy. Then Myfanwy, I borrowed this name from the Welsh poetry. Myfanwy was the celebrated mistress of one of the bards; the Laura of an ancient British Petrarch. then My glory shall make rapture of thy tears, And thou shalt bless the grief that wrings thee now.”— “Oh, glory hath a stern and savage mate, Danger, her lawless paramour, enfolds Her beauties in his churlish arms. Oh pause, And yet farewell—'tis exquisite to part, For oh, thou weep'st at parting—'twas past hope To see a tear on that stern face for me.” She hath her last cold kiss, through the barr'd helm Won hardly; she is calm as though it dwelt Yet on her lips, she hears his parting steps, Yet lingers on her cheek that liquid glow, That brilliant harmony of smile and tear That at the presence of the one belov'd Flits o'er the settled purple of the cheek. Oh, if soft woman hath her wilder fears, She hath her wilder hopes, for man's stern grasp Too thin, too airy! “Never yet found false, Thou wilt return; (so prophesied her dreams) So young, so lovely, fate scarce dare cut off, Untimely thus, the noblest boast of earth.” Then sate she down triumphal coronets To weave, but not in modest quiet grief, And gentle resignation pale and mild, But with a dancing heart and bright blithe eye; And when her eyelids droop'd, soft o'er her came A sweet inconstant slumber, such as sleep Love-dreaming maidens ere their bridal morn. But through the clear calm night (the azure plain Of heaven, with all its glittering paths of light Distinct and dazzling) mov'd that fair-hair'd youth; So, if old fable may be won to smile Its grace upon our darker tale, the boy, Smooth-cheek'd Endymion, his enamour'd Moon Woo'd with no lawless witchcraft from her sphere: Nor she delay'd; her silver-sandal'd feet Gliding and glancing o'er the dews she came, And curtain'd in a cloud of snowy light, Mock'd mortal harps that hymn'd her cold and chaste. No amorous fancies o'er thy downless cheek Flushing their rosy heat, no love-lipp'd tones In sweet disturbance stealing on the air, Young Abisa! with more imperious charm Thou summon'st from wild wood or cavern'd heath, Nor vainly, their fierce habitant. Behold, A shadow by thine own, its stately length On the white dews advancing; at thy side The Avenger, as upsprung from nether earth. Then fatal gladness leap'd in that young heart, He flung his vizor'd helmet sternly up, Proud to defy fierce Offa's conqueror. But Samor, for when his pure heart was wean'd From all the weakness of his mortal kind, The mercies clung within, and gentleness So mingled with his nature, that it slaked Even the blood-thirsting frenzy of revenge; Samor survey'd that beauteous youth, the stars Glimmer'd with blue and hazy light, that shewed His soft locks spreading their bright clusters wide, His vermeil cheek most lovely in its wrath, And brow that seem'd to wonder and delight At its own dauntlessness. So tall, so fair, Oft had he imag'd his own perish'd boy In flower of youth, that flower which never bloom'd. Tender and mild his voice, as though he spake Even to that dead belov'd—“Oh, brave and fair, Why thus abroad amid the silent night, With menace and fierce gesture wild and strange?”— “Thou heardst my call, thou see'st my arms, my aim Idly thou question'st.”—“'Tis not, gentle youth, Thy golden luxury of hair, nor cheek Warm in the rosy wantonness of youth, But thy brave bearing, gallant mien and proud, That winds long-banish'd mercy round my sword, To save from it one Saxon life.”—“Soft praise, And sweet from lady's lips! but not to hear Smooth Flattery's descant come I, but to win What, being won, is in its lofty self Imperishable beauty, crowns the youth With honour passing the white hairs of age, Glory, the life of life.”—“And is there none Whose pillow dreams of thee are haunting now? No mother, whose last waking thought was hope, At morn to meet thee in thy wonted glow Of loveliness and life? No gentle maid Whom the bare thought of paleness in thy cheek, Of death's wan chill upon thy brow, would waste And wither like the canker'd flower of spring? Return to her, oh fair, high-minded youth! Ere yet too late, return.”—But more delay The hot youth brook'd not; down he clasp'd his helm, And leaping to the frantic onset, cried, “Now, Offa, for thy shame, and for thy meed, My brother Hengist!”—As when lightning flame Dashes at midnight o'er his slumbering lids, Up starts the wild steed, all his tawny mane Bristling and blazing, he devours the earth In fury; even so sudden those rash words Set flames upon the Avenger's brow, set wrath On the impetuous motion of his spear. Oh, holy Night! in thy injurious gloom How blank the proud distinctions of man's fame! Languor and loftiness, and shame and pride, In one dead darkness, deep forgetfulness, Lie, as within a grave, till Virtue's self, But for her haughty consciousness within, Might weary of her mute and viewless deeds. Secret and still! that I might violate Thy mysteries, and redeem from envious gloom That Saxon boy's dead honours, dearly won, Most dearly, yet most nobly. Morn shall tell The issue of that conflict, but no morn Will dawn upon his silent, perish'd praise. Two hours are past, alone the Avenger moves Under the stars of heaven; 'tis midnight deep: Now comes his hour of softness; love-sick boy, Tuning soft frenzies to his wanton lute, Is not more wild, fantastical, or fond, Than Britain's stately hope, high Hengist's dread. For, ever at this hour, of parted joy Dim gleams revisit his forsaken soul, Like once-lov'd music o'er a maniac's ear, Faintly and feebly sweet: the dead put on Their earthly lustre; Emeric comes, as fair As from the bridal altar, but less coy, In fervent full abandonment of love. The breezes are melodious with her voice, The dews are printed by her slender feet, She flows into his arms, her fond embrace Is warm upon his soul. Thus aye she comes. Or when 'tis wintry in the starless skies, Or when the moonlight bathes the earth, to her Heaven opes its crystal portals, beauteous light Ushers her presence, sleep can ne'er estrange That luxury from his heart; when consciousness Of all things earthly slumbereth and is dead, She haunts within, her sweet intrusion clings To the lull'd spirit, senseless but to her, All, all that liveth of the man is her's. Oh, in their dreamings, their communions wild With airy, immaterial visitants, Most differ Guilt and Virtue; there are shapes Hideous and hateful, snaky Gorgon smiles, And all the fabled populace of hell, Brooding disquiet o'er the thorny couch. But Virtue's visions are almost as fair As angels' blest realities. To thee Lovely thy nightly visitant, sad Chief! As to man, sinless yet in Eden bowers, On beds of odorous amaranth asleep, Yet uncreated, came his virgin bride, Delightful phantom; then his fresh pure soul Amorous enchantment first entranc'd; first rose That our best feeling, of lost Paradise That sole surviving pleasure, holy love. Beauteous thy blue uprising, mist-rob'd Morn! All thy bright glittering of fantastic dews With their thin tissue silkening the green meads, And all thy music of blithe leaves that dance In the caressing breeze, and matins gay From all the living woodland, Sleep is pleas'd To be so sweetly banish'd her soft reign. But dreary are thy sounds, and sad thy light On the lewd wassail, riot's orgies rude, Polluting day with sights that shame dark night. Now from the state pavilion forth are pour'd The synod of high banqueters, their eyes Hot with loose raptures and distemper'd joy, Voluptuously turbulent their souls. Right in their way stood fix'd a lofty spear, Not with gay garland crown'd, or streaming silk, But with that beauteous head that yesternight Confronted them with graceful pride; the cheek Where wantonly youth's freshest purple gleam'd Pale, dewy, stiffening, lifeless, lustreless; Part matted with red damp, the golden locks Clung round the spear, part curling on the air, Sad semblance shew'd of life, in all the rest Making the stillness and fix'd cold more dread. No cheek was there so bright, voluptuous heart So hot, but, like bleak snow, fear fell on it With chill and searching numbness; if their sight Had yet perception, humbler chiefs might draw From high example comfort for their dread; Brow might they see with kingly crown beset White, sad, and shrunken as their own. Alone, Fierce smil'd the pride of Offa; he held up To those wan lips the sparkling shell of mead: “Drink, thou hast kept thy oath, drink, soft-lipp'd boy!” O'er all the camp spread loud and wide and far The name of Abisa; Myfanwy heard Where lay she dreaming half, and fabling half Of garlands and of gay triumphal pomp. How nimble are the feet that bear light hearts! She is gone forth, and all for joy forgot The veil e'er wont to dim her dazzling cheek, Forgot the braiding of her hair, the maid So soft, so timorous, at the wanton breeze She us'd to tremble, 'neath day's eye to shrink Even from the fondness of her own loved youth. Through files of warriors, who uncasque their brows To fill their curious gaze, she hurries on, She knows not what she sees, and only knows, She sees not what she seeks, that cheek, that eye Which fed on her with such excess of love As if 'twere worse than blindness to lose sight Of its sole idol; only she is blithe, She only smiling 'mid those many sad. She meets even all she longs for; up from earth (For now from that sad eminence of scorn Had friendly hand remov'd it, now had cleans'd Its damp defilement) that dear face on her Settled its fixed and inexpressive gaze. Her mien was strangely rational, her look Like one that calmly ponder'd what it saw, Her voice articulate and passionless. “Who hath done this?”—“The Avenger, the Unknown,” Spake many voices.—“Oh, my hands are weak, Ye see them soft and delicate and white, But thou, and thou, and thou, art bold and strong, And bear'st bright armour, ye will sure requite The slaughter on the slaughterer's head.”—Ensued Brief moments of a stagnant grief, life paus'd, As 'twould prolong unconsciousness, delay Yet, yet that state that wakes with waking sense. Then kindled up her eye, but not with joy, Then flush'd her cheek a light and sanguine red, That colour'd its pure marble, leaving there Nor tinge nor warmth; she snatch'd up to her heart That lifeless thing and fled. As the fond bird With spread wings hovering o'er her nest, looks round At some terrific shape, then turns to see If yet her callow brood, are slumbering safe. So wandering her dim eye on all around, Anon with full intensity of love, Settled on her cold care. She reach'd the tent There miserly her treasure she o'erbroods; She lays it on her lap, and sings to it; Now gazes, as she thought even yet those eyes Might open, those wan lips their wonted sounds Murmur, now almost sees a forming smile: Now gaily carols on her broken songs, Ever his favourite, most familiar tones; And now breaks off, as fearful to disturb His quiet slumbers; only speaks in smiles, Language by him e'er understood; and once, Once her rash lips approach'd. So pass'd the hours From earliest morning till the setting sun. Then that wild sport and playfulness of grief Sadden'd to drear sobriety, gave place Sweet-dreaming twilight to the bright clear day. Then first she thought of beasts and fowls obscene Battening on his fair limbs, no hand to heap The scanty pity of a little earth Upon the brave, the princely, and the fair. Envious of partner in her sacred toil, Bearing her precious burthen in her arms, Alone upon the pious quest she speeds. She fears not, ah too wretched now to fear! Darkness is on her steps, but what to her Though nature's rich varieties are blank? Her guide the unblinded sympathies within; The love that link'd her to his living soul Will light her to him lifeless; yon wan stars, That struggle with the haze, are bright enough To beam upon the dead. But now more fast Their golden cressets multiply, more clear— And lo, fierce Offa in her path: his eye Fix'd on her with a rude imperious lust, As the pollution of his bad desires Did honour to their victim. But the maid, Unbelieving, unsuspecting aught impure, With sweet beseeching, almost with caress, Would win her onward passage; when her soul Was startled into fear, she would not think Such savage nature dwelt in human hearts. She wept, she sued, she drew the veil away, Held up the pallid head she bore—in vain: The snowy dove is in the rude kite's grasp, Pale, fluttering, fainting: upon Heaven she call'd, Cruelly calm look'd on her the cool skies; She call'd on Abisa, but only felt More deeply that cold glassiness of face, That dull, indifferent witness of her shame. But in the stress and hurry of despair Strange energies were hers, with frantic voice She call'd on the Avenger.—Lo, he comes, Terrible in the silence of his arms, And earth is red with Offa's lustful blood. But her first motion, was a frantic kiss On Abisa's cold lips, as though for him Proud of the untainted treasure of her love; Then turn'd to her preserver, but with looks Of loathing more than thankfulness. He stood In gentle majesty serene, yet proud Of that light victory, of prevented crime Severely joyful. Bitter strife of heart Spake in her language—“Had it been but death, I yet had curs'd thee! oh, look here, look here! (And she withdrew the clust'ring curls that veil'd The rigid, lifeless, but still lovely, brow) Oh, one sole feeling to this dead heart seem'd A duty and delight, the hate of thee. Cruel, even that thou enviest me, even that.”— “That, British maiden! is a Saxon's face, Yet mourns thy amorous heart in guilty tears?”— “Is there not beauty in a Saxon's cheek, Is there not music on a Saxon's tongue, Is there not tenderness in Saxon hearts? Oh, he is kind and true, his love to me Almost as deep and fond as mine to him, Wild that I am, he was, that fatal ‘was’ Makes agony my sacred thought of him.”— “Maiden, by Wye's transparent stream abode An aged pair, and their declining day One beauteous child enlighten'd, and dispens'd Soft moonlight o'er their darkening eve; they thought The only pang of death from her to part. But heavy was their sinking to the grave, For that fair beam in unchaste darkness quench'd Its virgin lustre, and its light withdrew, Of their old limbs the life: alone they dwelt, In discontent and cold distaste of all, For her ingratitude had made them sick Of the world's hollowness, and if she fail'd All earthly things must needs be false and frail. They ne'er reproach'd her, for so near the grave They could not hate; but for her sake they loath'd Each old familiar face, that once they lov'd. Where she was wont to wander, wander'd they; The garden flowers she tended, they bound up With woeful care; their chill and shaking hands Made tremulous music with her lute—I shrunk In hoary age to see such childish joys. They felt one after pleasure, the same hour They glided from their woes; their parting breath, Blended in languid blessings on her head, For her went suppliant to the throne of God, Their lost Myfanwy.” Trembling stood she there, Like one that strives to weep, but the hard tears Are frozen in their source. “Oh thou and I, Sweet Abisa (to that cold head she spake), We will go weep upon their graves, and win Their spirits to forgiveness; when they hear How fervent and how fatal were our loves, Heaven will lend airs to waft their pardon down.”— “Fond Maid, beware! repentance must be chaste And spotless as the unsunn'd snow; wilt thou Yet wanton with the memory of thy sin, Bad thoughts at revel in thy heart, with vows Lightly made up of guilty breath impure, Pollute and sicken the clear air that dwells About the holy dwellings of the dead? Waver from God to Pagan paramour With wandering loose affections?”—“Hard and cold, Be thou content to have robb'd this widow'd heart Of that most lovely breathing thing earth bore, But spare, oh spare, the sinless, senseless dead! Cruel! by yon bright stars I oft have sworn Ne'er to forego him; shall I crown my sins With perjury? I will weep, and fast, and pray, And wear the rough stones with my tender knees, So thou wilt leave me my sad thoughts of him. Oh, God hath grace for all; my earliest prayer Shall be for mercy on his perish'd soul, The next for those who dying pray'd for me, And for my sad and sinful self the last.” Most exquisite sorcery of womankind! Even to the fall'n some cherish'd loveliness Yet clings, with innocent hypocrisy Tricking their failures in such tender hues, We blame with tears, admiring while we blame. Even thus her fervent constancy of love Brighten'd that guilty maiden. “God will weigh With righteous hand thy sorrows and thy sins, Damsel, I nor absolve thee, nor condemn. Come thou with me, and we will reunite That beauteous boy's remains; oh thou, even thou, Knew'st thou the studious cruelties, cold crimes By these barbarians wrought on this sad land, Wouldst pardon this dishonour to the corpse Of that brave youth.” She leap'd up to his neck, “And who art thou, that dost such savage deeds, Yet forcest us to love thee?” On they passed, They reach'd the place of death, he dug away The earth that fenc'd from wandering kite and wolf Young Abisa's fair limbs; he sooth'd her woes By soft participation, her consol'd By suffering, and the Christian's voice rose up In prayers for mercy on a Saxon's soul. BOOK VII. ARGUMENT. Hengist on the Throne of Britain. Caswallon on the Throne of the North at Caer Ebranc (York). Samor. The Vale of Towey, near Caer Merddhyn (Caermarthen), now the capital of Vortigern's kingdom of Dyfed (or Dimetia). Queen Rowena. Samor in Caer Merddhyn. His interviews with Rowena in the Palace, and at midnight on the heath. Meeting and combat with Argantyr. Samor wounded, succoured by Myfanwy. How measureless to erring human sight True glory! Glorious thy majestic state, Hengist! with captive cities for thy thrones, And captive nations thy pale satellites, Britain, and all her beauty, power, and wealth, Thy palace of dominion. Glorious thou, Caswallon, in Caer Ebranc's stately courts, By the slow waters of the wandering Ouse, Bright-sceptred Renegade! Even in your crimes Glitters a dazzling and meteorous pomp, Though your wild voyage hath lain through waves of blood, Ye ride triumphant in your royal port. But he, sad Pilgrim, outcast and forlorn, How doth the midnight of his honour shame Your broad meridian, his wild freedom pass Your plenitude of sway, his nakedness Transcend your sweeping purples, rayed with gold! Nor wanteth to his state its gorgeous pride, And high peculiar majesty; the pomp Of the conspiring elements sheds on him Tumultuous grandeurs; o'er his midnight couch, Amid the scath'd oaks of the mountain moor, On its broad wings of gloom the tempest stoops. Around his head in crystal coronets The lightning falls, as though thy fiery hand, Almighty! through the rolling clouds put forth, Did honour to the Freeman. Mighty winds And the careering thunders spread around Turbulent music; darkness rivals day, And day with darkness vies in stateliest pride The Avenger's lofty miseries to array. When from the East forth leaps the warrior Sun In panoply of golden light, dark cowers His own proud eagle, marvelling what strong form, Uprising to usurp his haughty right, Drinks in the intensé magnificence with brow Undazzled and unshrinking; nor to him Fails homage from the living forms of earth: Fawning to him beasts fierce and savage pay Tame adoration; from his rugged sleep The wild boar, all his bristling wrath subdued, Shrinks, the grim wolf no more his rest disturbs, Than the calm motion of the moon she bays. Now, by her native sylvan Wye, that Maid Left to cold penitence and prayer, again Sets forth the high Avenger: now his path Through Towey's vale winds velvet soft and green. The year is in its waning autumn glow; But the warm Sun, with all his summer love, Hangs o'er this gentle valley, loath to part From the blue stream that to his amorous beams Now her cool bosom spreads, now coyer slides Under her alder shade, whose umbrage green, Glancing and breaking the fantastic rays, The deep dark mirror frets with mazy light. A day that seems in its rich noon to blend All seasons' choice deliciousness; high hung On Dinevaur and Carreg Cennon rude, And on bold Drusslyn gleam'd the woods with hues, Changeful and brilliant, as their leaves had drunk The sun's empyreal fountains; not more bright The groves of those Atlantic Isles, where rove (Dream'd elder Poesy such fancies sweet) The spirits of the brave, stern Peleus' son, And Diomede, through bowers o'erarching all With an immortal spring of fragrant gold. The merry birds, as though they had o'erdream'd The churlish winter, spring-tide virelays Carolling, pruned their all-forgotten plumes. Upon the sunny shallow lay the trout Kindling the soft gems of its skin; the snake As fresh and wanton in its green attire Wound its gay rings along the flowery sward. That overpowering beauty in mild bonds Of sweet amazement and infatuate bliss, Took prisoner Samor's spirit. On a rock, 'Neath a white canopy of glistening birch, He lay surrender'd. The thin whispering leaves, The welling waters' flow, the lingering, long, Love-dwelling descant of the joyous birds, Came mingling with the languor of his sense, Most soothing each in turn, most slumb'ring soft. 'Tis no harsh breaking in that train of sound Delicious, but a low and measur'd dash That blends and deepens all the mingling tones; 'Tis nought to cloud or dim that slow intrudes On the universal brilliance, crowning all Moves the gay apparition, and fires up The restless glittering to intenser blaze. Slow up the tide the gaudy bark comes on, Her oars scarce startling the unruffled air; The waters to her swan-like prow give place, Along the oar-blades leap up to the sun In lucid flakes, and dance, as 'twere their sport To waft that beauteous freight. And exquisite As that voluptuous Memphian on the stream Of Cydnus, leading with bliss-breathing smiles Her throngs of rash beholders, glided down To welcome to his soft imprisonment The Lord of half the world: so wond'rous fair Under an awning cool of fluttering silk The Lady of that graceful galley sate. But not in her instinct the melting form With passion, the smooth limbs in dazzling glow Translucent through the thin lascivious veil, Skilful with careless blandishments to fire The loose imaginations, she herein Least like that Oriental harlot Queen. Pride seem'd of all her shape, of all her soul The sustenance, the luxury, the life; The innate scorn of her full eye repaid With lofty thanklessness the homage fawn'd By her fair handmaids, and her oarmen gay, Who seem'd to wanton in their servile toil. Around she gaz'd, as, in her haughtiness, She thought that God had form'd this living pomp Of woodland, stream, and rock, her height of soul To pamper, that to welcome her the earth Attired its breathing brightness, and the sun Only on her look'd from his azure sphere. Knows Samor that bright Lady? Who knows not Amid her twinkling retinue of stars The queenly summer moon? You too he knows, The minion rowers of her royal state, Entitled once by courteous falsehoods bland Nobles of Britain, from the general wreck Most despicably saved by Saxon scorn, Meet vassalage for Vortigern, now shrunk And dwindled from proud Britain's sov'reign lord To petty Prince of Dyfed. Or, Dimetia, i.e. South Wales. I supposed that Vortigern had retreated into Wales, assumed the kingdom of Dimetia, or South Wales, of which Caer Merddhyn (Caermarthen) was the capital. Ye yet cling Even to the hollow semblance of a crown, Ye gauzy summer motes, that float and bask In the warm noontide of a court, light things Of noise and glittering, that to royal ears Tinkle your poisonous flatteries, then most proud When most obtrusive your gay nothingness. Under a rock where Samor lay unseen Beneath the sparkling birchen shade, the bark Glided so near, the silver-twinkling leaves Play'd like a wavering veil o'er the bright face And marble neck of that reclining Queen. Now, Samor, now 'tis at thy thirsty lips The cup of vengeance, now quaff deep, quaff deep! Now, by the bones that bleach on Ambri plain, By thy lost Emeric's silent chamber bowers, By that soft cheek o'er which the primrose blooms, Now launch the unerring javelin! lo she tempts, The Saxon's daughter, and the false King's bride, The tame and baffled lingering of revenge. And up the Avenger stood, a ray of light Quiver'd his brandish'd javelin, creeping awe Froze up the rowers' hearts, down fell the oars, And to the shore round swung the ungovern'd bark. But 'mid those feminine and timorous men Intrepid that soft lady her fair front Advanc'd, and, “Who art thou, whose impious arm 'Gainst royalty's anointed head dare sway Irreverent menace?”—“One whom grinding wrong, And injuries cruel, black, and manifold, Have almost madden'd to the unwarlike guilt Of soiling his bright arms with woman's blood. (He cast the javelin from him, and went on) But tell thy sire, Rowena, tell thy lord, Britons have yet to learn their codes of war, That yet fastidious vengeance will not slake But on a worthy victim its deep thirst.” Then was the mingling of their looks elate, As when two falcons, far from this low earth, Meet in the sun's broad blaze, they, glad and proud Each of their kindred, flap their radiant wings. “I know thee now, majestic Rebel! thee The untraceable, untameable! I know The chosen Man of Fate! of all our race The designated danger; merciful, Saxon ne'er coupled with thy name till now. Yet think not thou from rivalry aloof In proud and lonely excellence to stand, For with requital royal and profuse I will transcend thee; this my woman's hand Shall cast thee Hengist's pardon for thy deeds Of guilty fame; this smooth and damask cheek Smile thee fair honours in Caer Merddhyn's court.” “Pardon, and honour, Lady! one alone Jealous prerogative of pardon holds O'er Samor's soul, the universal God! Caer Merddhyn's honours! to fall'n Vortigern To be install'd prime flatterer, meekly laud The bounteous-hearted monarch, who cast off His throne, his people, and his fame, and thought For bride so fair the dowry all too poor.” No wrath, but brighter joy the Lady's cheek Emblazon'd: “Why should slight and tinsel ties Of blood and birthplace hold asunder hearts Kindred in grandeur? thou art brave and free, And brave and free is Hengist; why disdains Valour to mate with valour, might with might?”— “Valour beneath the sun goes proudly forth; And in the cloudy battle's van affronts His hauberk'd foe, but folds not secret steel Under the mild and festal robe of peace, Nor creeps with midnight stealth on the weak sleep Of women and soft infants.”—Then appear'd Tears in her haughty eyes, tears beautiful, For drops of shame they were for those black crimes That fleck'd and dimm'd her father's blaze of fame. Still paus'd not the Avenger. “Did my God, Did Britain claim the offering, I dare hope Yet I could rend from this worn heart away Its cherished lust of vengeance; private wrongs Are but as drops in my full tide of hate; But all my country's injuries, all my God's, Concentrate in the mighty passion flood, My life, my soul, my being; we must be, I and thy father, through all space of time, Even to the end, Destroyer or Destroy'd.” “Harsh and Implacable! yet be not thou Discourteous: wilt thou to Caer Merddhyn come, An honour'd guest, in freedom to depart When, where, thou wilt, thy pledge my royal faith?” “A Saxon's faith!” burst bitter from his lips, He check'd the upbraiding tone. “If fraud and sin In such a lovely temple hold their shrine, It were not strange did fiends of darkness dwell Within yon beauteous sun!” But she with smile Mild as May morning on a violet bank, “Why stayest thou? can the Unconquerable fear—?” “Fear, Lady! fear and I are strangers now.”— “What wondrous spell,” pursued her playful mirth, “So steels thee.”—“One most simple and most strong, A tranquil conscience, and a faith in God.” Then sate he by the Lady's side, the bark Upon its dancing voyage down the tide Set forth obeisant to its dashing oars. But those gay rowers, veering with the wind Of soft court favour, 'gan with subtle joy And cold factitious transport hail again Their gentle peer, their old and honour'd friend. But with a glance the imperial lady froze To silence their smooth-lying lips, nor brook'd Idle intrusion on her rapturous feast. Deep drank she in, the majesty and pomp, Wherewith instinct the Avenger mov'd and spake, And what high beauty from heroic soul Emanates on the outward shape: nor pall'd On her insatiate appetite the joy; Even till that intercourse of lofty thoughts, Proud admiration, and intense delight In what is heart-exalting and sublime, Became a fiery passion; o'er her flow'd Secret the intoxicating ecstasy, Love, dangerous, deep, intolerable love. What beauteous seeming and magnificent, Wears that enchanting sin! now not o'er her Came it in melting languor, soft and bland; But like her own high nature, eminent, Disdainful, and elate, allied to all That beautified, that glorified; and seem'd Mysterious union of two soaring spirits, The wedding lofty thoughts with lofty thoughts, The noble joy of being to this earth A boast and wonder: and as floats the air Clear, white, and stainless in the highest heavens, Thus, from its exaltation fresh and pure, Above all taint her amorous madness rose. Had it seem'd love, her pride had timely quell'd The unplum'd phantasy, her inbred scorn Repress'd the young infirmity; but now Upon her soul's bold crest it planted high Its banner of dominion, and she hail'd Its coming as a guest of pomp and power. But though o'er all her features mantling spread A vivid restlessness, a brighter glow, A deepening purple, though her eye indulg'd Richer delirium, though her languid breath Came with a throb and struggle from her heart, Yet in that noble blindness that disdains With greedy and suspicious gaze to search The sin that may be, rather chastening all With his own native purity, serene The Warrior sate. The placid gliding bark, With motion like to stillness, drifted down, Where with green diadem of woods above, Beneath the white breadth of the expanding stream, Caer Merddhyn in the liquid noontide rose. Fair rose Caer Merddhyn, rose enriching air With her bright towers: nor misbecame a king Such stately dwelling; populous her streets, And throng'd with human faces; but o'er all A lassitude and heavy sadness hung, Blankness of looks and weariness of hearts, And listlessness of motion faltering on. With all the pomps, the luxuries of life, It seem'd a city of the dead. The shapes, The steps of men were there, but soul and spirit, And stirring energy, and vivid mind, Passion and earnestness, in torpor slept, The cold blood stagnate in the drowsy veins. Alike all feelings lazy languor seal'd; To still them, not delight, the mothers held Their infants, as the radiant Queen pass'd on; But even in them the laughing spring of joy Was dead, and dry, and frozen. “Oh, high God! (So spake the Wanderer in his secret soul) Hath tyranny such bleak and withering power Man's heavenly essence to embrute, and thou, Once princely Vortigern, the tyrant thou!” Worse sight! worse shame! they reach the broad hill's brow, Where in its royalty the palace look'd Awe on its vassal city; there, even there, On that high threshold, armed Saxon files From the weak people fenc'd the weaker King. But through that legion hateful and accurst Onward the Avenger that bright Lady's hand Led, as the Sybil sage the Love-queen's son Calm through the doleful regions of the dead. Within the hall with royal banners hung, And shields of royal blazon, royal arms, Least royal he, sate Vortigern; deep thought And miserable on his faded brow Traced its deep lines, before him glittering lay The crown of Britain, which his eye perused With a sick sadness, as each gem were full Of woeful ruminations, blank remorse; And as bad Angels loathe, yet upward watch, Heaven's Sun, bright type of their once radiant state, Even so in bitterness that fallen King, Painfully banqueting on self-reproach, Mournful remembrance of lost grandeurs drew From that fair ring; and curs'd its blaze that flash'd Past splendours o'er the darkness of his soul, Recalling from what height to what depth sunk, He welters in the abyss of shame profound. Beside him o'er his harp Aneurin bow'd, The white-hair'd Bard, sole faithful he, sole friend; For minds of poets from their own high sphere Look down on earth's distinctions, high and low, Sunken or soaring, as the equal sun Sheds light along the vale and mountain's brow. He in the hall of feasting who fast seal'd The treasures of his harmony, now pours Into the wounded heart his syrups sweet, And laps it in the silken folds of sound. But even along his strings the infectious grief Hath crept, and wither'd up their wantonness, And lost in wayward wanderings of despair Stray the vague tones; anon bursts full and free A start, a swell of pride; then sinks away Involuntary to such doleful fall, Misery so musical, its languid breath Feeds, while it softens the deep-rooted woe. Such melodies at tragic midnight heard 'Mid a deserted city, gliding o'er The deep green moss of tower and fane o'erthrown, Had seem'd immortal sorrows in the air, O'er man's inconstant grandeurs. Sad such wreck, More sad, more worthy Angels' woe the waste And desolation of a noble mind. But at their entrance startling, half in wrath The King began—“Who thus unbidden bursts On this our solitude? why ask I thee? No brow, between the Scot and Southern sea, Moves in such dauntless insolence abroad, But Samor, the wild Wanderer, the denounc'd, The desperate! Art thou here to stun mine ears With ‘Vortigern is abject, lost, disgrac'd?’ 'Tis well that with thee comes my bright excuse, My poverty's rich treasure, my night's star, Beauteous Rowena.” Joy seem'd his, but yet That joy was forced, constrain'd, unnatural all, The striving of a barren heart to force The perish'd bloom of pleasure,—“King, I come To put a spell upon thee, conjure up Thy valour from its tomb within thy breast, To rend the adamant that trammels fast Thy strength of soul. By yon bright glaive that smote On Esk's wild bank, beneath his father's shield, The royal Caledonian's son; yon flag, That, when by fated Arles rash Britain lost Her noble hazard for imperial state, Clouding the car of adverse victory, shook Untarnish'd in the sun its blazon broad, Nor stoop'd, though all was fallen; by yon rich crown, Whereon when flow'd the holy oil, this isle From all her seas her gratulant acclaim Sent up, and overcast heaven's vault with joy; By Vortigern, the great, the brave the wise!”— “Brave! wise! aye, that it is. The veriest wretch That from base birth-place to his baser grave, Creeps with his fellow reptiles, that ne'er knew What luxury 'tis, what loftiness to soar, And with one soul to wield a host of souls In free subjection: oh that fireless dust, Clay uninform'd that only lives to die, That is to me a God! to me whose curse, And brand, and mock it is, to have been great— And be—oh! Samor, Samor, I was King, King of this spacious, rich, and glorious isle, And thou, and such as thou, my regal state Didst vassal; now, but now an eye may trace The circuit of my realm, a shepherd's boy Count my thin people, like his mountain flock.” “Oh, Monarch, ill must be atoned by good, And to repentant deeds of mightiest fame Heaven can upraise the farthest sunken. Power Fails not the aspirant will. I knew thee once A being of those arduous energies, Strong aspirations, graspings undefin'd, Tumultuous thirsts and passions, that of man Make Fiend or Angel.”—“True, too true, but thou Hast seiz'd the Seraph's air-plum'd wings, and I The Demon's vans of darkness. Had all fallen, All perish'd, one wide ignominy swept Princes and Lords and People, I had found Comfort forlorn in the universal wreck; But in its curst sublimity thy fame Obtrudes its radiant presence, and makes groan This ruin of a Monarch.”—“Rare it is, Oh King, in Fame's rich galaxy to shine With stedfast blaze unwithering, but to dawn From darkness, scatter off the black eclipse That veils the wither'd lustre, this most rare Makes of man's soul an everlasting fire Worthy the God that hung the Heavens with light. 'Tis hard for downcast spirit to o'erleap Ruin's sad barriers, but Heaven's angels drop Soft dews beneath his burning feet, his flight Imp with strong plumes; his coming doth adorn The earth he moves on; till Remorse abash'd Before the orient glories fades and flies.” “Peace! peace! thou canst not see what cold within Lies like a palsy on the flagging powers, Makes me a thin and shrinking reed, the sport Of every lazy wind, the shape, the life, The woe, without the faculties of man, Shame, shame! I stoop my spirit to endure, Of all this nation, the curse-wrinkled lips, Out-pointed fingers, ribald jests, coarse scorns! Men that have lick'd the dust beneath my feet, Worn their tame faces by the mould of mine, Them, to confront even them.” Unkingly tears Chok'd the full utterance, but he met the glance Of that proud Queen, who, all unmark'd, observ'd That passionate discourse, from her contempt, Though far below his own, he shrunk, and wrought To a brief pride his wan dejected mien. “Here is my throne, my kingdom in this breast, My diadem the wealth of light that shines From yon fair brow upon me.” Stronger pain Burst in upon the infant pride: forth fled The monarch, happy could he fly himself. Him follow'd that old Bard. “'Tis vain, all vain!” (Thus spake the high Avenger.) “Beauteous Queen, I claim thy faith, and part.”—“So swift, so soon, Our festal cheer untasted, welcome cup Uncrown'd?”—“Fair Queen, in the pellucid stream My beverage dances; the coarse mountain boor Shares his hard fare with me; the hand that feasts The winged wanderers of the air, feasts me.” With lips in act of speech apart, the Queen, As to her will her tongue disdainful scorn'd Allegiance, chain'd in silence stood again. Twice she essay'd to speak, twice o'er her Shame Swept his petrific hand, and rosy fire O'er face and neck and forehead flush'd, till shrunk From that strong heat the eye, and down on earth Settled its close fring'd orb; with pressure soft Her blushing fingers his bronz'd hand embrac'd. “Here in this palace is my rule, this land Is mine by my prevailing power, would'st thou Of this high seat, this realm, be Lord?—Why starts Unwonted colour to thy cheek? why shrinks Into its sphere thine eye? Said I this soul, And what soft beauty glitters in this shape, Had it appall'd thee?” Eagerly she grasp'd The hand she held, as though from thence to wring A swift reply, yet gaz'd upon the earth, As wistful 'neath its darkness she might shrink From her own shame. Blank wonder Samor's brow To living stone congeal'd—“This then the close To all thy lavish love of Vortigern!” “My love! he was a King! upon his brow The beauty of a royal crown, his height Dominion, like a precious mantle, dipt In heaven's pure light, array'd, and o'er him flung Transcendent grandeur; above all he stood, And I by such fond splendours wooed and won, Took seat upon his eminence; a plant To spread, and mantle an imperial throne, Not like tame ivy round a ruin creep, Or wreathe the tomb of royalty. His pride I wedded, not his shame. He, he himself By self-abasement has divorc'd me, set Distance between us wide and far as heaven From the black pit of infamy.”—“High Queen, What seest thou in this bleak and batter'd brow, These rough scath'd limbs, this wan and sunken face, With misery's rugged furrows deeply plough'd, To dazzle or delight? Lone outcast I, Friendless, but daily, nightly, by fierce foes Beset, and hunted like a loathsome brute; Thy nation's mothers vent all hate on me, Link with a scathing curse no name but mine. Oh, what would'st thou and softness with a life Like mine so dreary, desperate, dark, and fierce?” “Oh, 'tis because all hate thee, that I love, Because all dread thee, I would mate with thee. Thy miseries, thy dangers deeper plunge My soul in passion; that alone thou walk'st, Smote at by every arm, yet struck by none. That mastery of thy single soul holds down The Saxon's mounting empire; that thy fame, Like a rich rainbow cloud, sails on through air, To mortal grasp impalpable, to sight In lonely brilliance manifest; my soul To that thy airy chariot would aspire, And dazzle by thy side, and daunt the world.” “Loose and unrighteous to thy lawful Lord, Yet would'st thou poison with adulterous shame Its spotless lustre, its pure white defile, And clog with guilt its vaunted wheels.”—“Guilt! Guilt! Ah, now I know why mine eye shrunk from thine, Why droop'd to earth, and why my tongue disdain'd The motions of my will—but we—shrink we? The lofty are their own high law; dull codes, Cold customs, trammel but the base; our sins Shall be the wanderings of the meteor fire, More wonder'd than the regular calm stars. Our acting shall ennoble what tame tongues Falter at, even in word; opinion's hues Shall at our haughty bidding shift and change, And what we do, shall therefore be call'd great. Yes, yes, I feel thy shrinking hand, I see Abhorrent anger quivering in thy mien, As at some loathsome viper. Woe, oh woe To him that tramples on the viper's wrath.” Then shook she back her golden hair, away Cast his cold hand.—“Ho, Saxons at the gate, Ho, Saxons, to your injured Queen!” The hall Sudden was walled with fiery arms, and spears Gleaming fierce menace; numerous, swift, and strong, As when old Cadmus by clear Dirce spread That dangerous seed uncouth, long, wide, and bright Under the fatal ploughshare leap'd to life, To havock, the wild harvest, and shook up Its bearded grim fertility of death. But then his sword the Avenger grasp'd, and cried, “Twice have I trusted Saxon faith, and twice Beneath my feet the smooth fair ice hath burst Its glassy treachery; once this arm redeem'd The infatuate blindness. Saxons, I am he, Who with his single strength on Ambri plain Scared your hot massacre, your proudest necks Strew'd for his pavement of retreat, ye see Mine arm unwither'd, my unbroken sword.” But they sprung onward; that bright Lady's brow Awful delight absorb'd the while, she moved Before their wrath, her arm's high sway waved back Their fury from her presence. Swift they came, Swift they departed; silence down the walls Crept o'er the banners broad, and pendant shields. She look'd on Samor, all his pride was hers, She look'd on Samor, all that pride was quench'd In wild delicious transport; at his feet The Queen, the haughty, the disdainful, fell. Her fine fair hair lay floating on the earth; Her round arms clung beseeching to his knees. “A curse upon me, that my wilful heart 'Gainst head so brave, so noble, dream'd of wrath, Of danger and rude menace. What I did, I know not, what I said; it pleased not thee; Enough! 'twas base, 'twas criminal, 'twas false. Oh Chief! when we would compass wild desires, Words alien to the heart start up, yet seem Most strong persuasion; of all serpents, scorn Stings to worse frenzy, worst a woman's soul. Forget all, all forget, but one soft word, And that I charge thee, by thy rescued life, Forget not.”—“Lady, were I rich in love, As yon full Sun in light, I could not spare A beam upon a Saxon. Now, but now The fountains of my heart are dry, the stock Where fresh and rich my green affections bloom'd, Is wither'd to the root; rigid and dead, My breast's impassive iron scatters off All melting blandishments, all soft delights, As the wav'd banner the thin morning dews. With one harsh discord to consummate all; Thou art thy Father's daughter.” She arose In miserable calmness resolute. She took his hand, she led him forth, beneath The angry scowling of those Saxons stern, Whose curious wonder scarce herself controll'd: Gave one fond lingering pressure, and but one, Then watch'd him through the city, up the vale, If gazing with such emptiness of eye Were watching, which his distance seem'd to freeze Gradual to hollower wanness; down her arms Hung, only that she stood and faintly breath'd, Pulse, motion, sense, life, all seem'd fled with him. Sudden above her, the mild air 'gan waft Wild fiery sounds, like those of battle morn Which champing war-steed's neigh, and lance's rush, Impatient answers. On the palace top Aneurin in his bardic glory stood. The sunlight on his old prophetic brow Flash'd strong, yet dazzled not, his long white locks Stream'd back upon his azure robe, like rack O'er heaven's unclouded blue, his pale thin hand With strength of mounting frenzy launch'd abroad The war-song of Cassivelan: glad sounds To that tranc'd queen, for Samor's hastier port Deliberate grandeur slacken'd, he look'd back, Proud gratitude for that wild flattery. “All, All in one wide conspiracy (so spake Rowena's bitter joy), thee, only thee To glorify. Oh, were man mute, this earth Would leap to utterance of thy fame, the winds Find voices eloquent, the streams, the stones, To lofty music burst of thy renown.” Slowly retired the Queen; she call'd around Her slaves, her handmaids; arrogant their looks Seem'd to confront her, eyes once wont to shrink Before her gaze, now seem'd to pry and pierce Her deepest soul's recesses; and she blush'd Even in her plenitude of scorn. They stood Trembling before her wayward mood, yet seem'd Their fears to mock her; solitude she sought, Yet solitude found none, things senseless took Stern cognizance of all her acts, her thoughts. Eyes hung the empty walls, weak laughing sounds Of triumph o'er her shame pervaded wide The tranquil air; all with herself at league Shook scorn upon herself. Dim evening falls, O'er earth and sky slow flits the shadowy night. “Slaves there!” she cried, “my steed! alone I ride.” She wont to find her every look a law, Now almost wonders all so swift obey. The moon's white sickle tenderly array'd With dubious lustre the grey heavens; scarce tinged The dew-webs, whiten'd not the yellow crown Of the unwaving forest; ignorant, Or with feign'd ignorance 'guiling even herself, Long upon Samor's track the Lady rides. 'Tis not a stag that couches on the heath; Hope on her dim cheek brightens, from her steed Soft she dismounts, she ruffles not the fern, The moss springs printless up beneath her feet, So light her gliding to that slumbering man. She knows him, she starts back. “Oh, came I here, Lost and abas'd, him, only him to seek, That answers mine immodest heart with flight, With scorn, perchance with hate! yet wondrous he, Wondrous in rest as action! Sleep'st thou calm, While, numberless as these brown heath-spikes, rise Legions of spears around thee, for thy blood Leagued in one furious thirst? Unwise and rash! To night thou slumber'st not unguarded; sleep, And if Rowena mingle with thy dreams, Sleep calmly, breathingly as now! He wakes— Oh, hateful even in slumber that harsh name Grates on his sense.” His eyes unfold, nor start; So soft the vision, wonder's self is calm, And dwells on it with mild unshrinking gaze. Her long bright hair, like threads of silver, streak The moonlight, her fair forehead's marble arch Wild joyous fearfulness, ecstatic doubt, Bathe with the dewiness of melting snow, Ere yet unblanch'd its stainless glitter pure. Oh, soft and slow that melody of mien Steals o'er the slumberer; ere the reason woke, The sense was drunken; one hand folded her's That answer'd not its pressure, nor withdrew, Tremulous, yet motionless: his rising head Found on her other arm such pillowing soft, As the fond ringdove on its mate's smooth down. They spake not, moved not. 'Tis the noon of night, Hour known to Samor not by sign or sound Of man's wise art to mark the fleeting time, Nor changing of the starry heavens; but e'er By motion of the secret soul, by calm Habitual sliding into the sooth'd heart, Distinct from turbulent day and weary eve, Emeric's own hour, her consecrated spot In his life's wilderness. She comes, she comes, The clouds have dropt her from their silvery folds; The mild air wafts her, the rank earth impure Stainless she skims; distrust, doubt, fear, no place Find in the sinless candour of her mien. In languid soft security she melts On Samor's fever'd soul, she fills his sense, Her softness like the nightingale's first notes After rude evening, o'er his passion steals. He cast not off Rowena's hand, it fell As from a dead man's grasp; slow rose his head From its fair zone, as from a bank of snow The winter traveller, by its smoothness 'guil'd Almost to deathful sleep; he dares not now Welcome that heavenly visitant, nor could, Nor would he her mild rescue bid depart. Nor dares he now with chill abhorrence shrink From that empassion'd Lady; on his lips A sad imploring silence clung, that framed Nor word nor sound. But time for thought in her Gave time for shame, for struggling pride gave time. “Thou deem'st me loose, wild, wanton, deem'st me come To lure thee with light sweets of lawless love, Hunting mine own shame through the midnight woods. Oh false, all false!—How thee shall I persuade, Ah me! that scarce persuade myself, 'twas chance, 'Twas fate, 'twas ministration of bad spirits, That led me thoughtless, hopeless—did I say Hopeless? yet scorn not thou, the lightest won Are oft best won. Oh why, ere now so mild, So gentle, why so stern, so ghastly still?”— “Thou lov'st my pride, my honour, my renown; Now, Queen Rowena, may'st thou do a deed Shall make my pride thine own, make thee my fount Of honour, all my noontide of renown On thee in all its golden brilliance shine; And if henceforth man's voice cry out, High deeds Hath Samor's arm achiev'd, thy heart shall bound And thy lips answer, ‘Mine! all mine!’ and I Will bless thee, thank thee, praise thee for that truth.” O'er proud Rowena pass'd his solemn voice Terrifically pleasing, as the sound Of thunder over Jove's bolt-minist'ring bird, That sternly rocks on th' agitated air. “Speak, speak, 'tis hours, 'tis years until 'tis done.” Return'd one brief, one powerful word—“Depart.” She struggled yet to wear the lofty light That flush'd her brow, she struggled, and she fell, Her white arms round his neck. Light as the breeze Pass'd over his her cheek. Then back She started, seiz'd her courser's rein; far, far The rocks gave answer to its trampling hoofs. To solitude, to peace,—ah, not to peace!— Was Samor left; large dewy beads distil From his full brow, as from the forest leaves The sunny icicle: fierce, merciless, Relentless inquest o'er himself he holds; In him a sin in thought is sin in deed. “And I, that on the frantic waxen wings Of mine own arrogance, have deem'd my soul Kindred and heritor of that rich bliss That bathes the Angels' radiant wings in strength; That wander'd o'er this sublunary wild As with a charter'd scorn; that mix'd with men But in disdainful mastery to o'er-rule Their dim and wavering destinies; that took With noble violence admiring earth: O'er me hath passion wound her silken nets; And that soft Dalila, lascivious sin, Shorn my full honours. Now, who clothed my steps With darkness, dread, and danger, hung my arms With lightning, kept at bay the envious death That feasts upon the famous of mankind; God, God abandons me. So farewell pride, And with pride farewell strength, the burning hope, Glad agonies, brave bliss of holy war, Transports of trampling on my country's foes, And all the beauty, majesty, renown, Vengeance, of thy triumphal state! Ye too, Farewell, soft midnights, delicate regards Fix'd on me from fond eyes yet bright from heaven, Mild agitation of the purer sense, Fresh bloomings of my faded joys, ye dreams Lovelier than actual bliss, as heaven than earth, Emeric abandons me. For how can snow Drop on this foul earth stainless? how canst thou Visit unsullied thy sad shrine defil'd, Or beam upon his lust-benighted heart? Oh never felt before, the fear to front Mine own past life, the ignoble shame that burns At human sight, and memory that ne'er sleeps, Heart-sickening at its own deformities, A miserable welcome bid I you: Come, dismal comforters, faint-footed guides, Teach me the hate of life, the dread of death.” And Samor wander'd on, not now with scope Resolv'd, and steady purpose that absorb'd And fix'd on one stern centre all his soul, True as the arrow to its mark. Now where, Whither, is all indifferent, he pursues The wildering of the forest track, the brook Winding its lucid error: two sad days And chance hath led him back to Wye's green bank. Sudden before him swept, in gallant pack, Fleet hounds, whose keen scent quaff'd the morning dews. Sole on their track a noble huntsman bow'd O'er his steed's high-curv'd neck. But when he saw Samor, that scarce his coming mark'd or heard, He vaulted from his uncheck'd steed so fleet, The courser seem'd to feel it not, but on Went stately bounding down the glen. But he Unslung his bugle horn, his hunting spear Cast to the winds, and held his burnish'd sword To heaven, as though to paragon its light. “Oh, thunderer Thor, but one bold prayer of mine E'er scaled thy heavens, and that, munificent, I thank thee for thy granting. Samor now, Now Christian, now baptiz'd in German gore, Avenger, we are met, and ere we part, Earth must be ruddier with thy blood or mine.” “Noble Argantyr, deem not thou unknown Thy name, thy presence! nor forgot, how thou, When Murther quaff'd his glut on Ambri plain, Didst hold thy jealous steel aloft, lest stain From gore by treason shed should dim its gleam; And when I burst my iron toils, and won My dangerous safety, how indignant joy Stood bathing thy stern brow. Brave Anglian, thou, But thou, of German race, to faint sloth chill'st My sword's quick wrath.”—“What, Samor out of love With strife, and music of conflicting steel? Hath Abisa's pale blood so quench'd his fire? Were't not I now could force my glorious will, Yea, I could sue thee, Briton, for the joy. Thou wilt not credit, air hath been defil'd With creeping whispers cold, that I, I shrunk To second in his dangers that brave boy. As though Argantyr would partake a foe, And, with division spiritless and base, Mete out his province in one man to slay; Hear; ‘Well the famous Anglian won his half Of that great conquest!’ But I have thee now Whole, undivided. Now, or man, or more, If aught be mortal in thee, guard that spot, My steel will search it.”—“Samor is not now As Samor was, but knows not yet to scorn Such brave allurements.” Forth his anlace flash'd, But not as wont, uplooks he to the sky; He thinks not now, oh, if I fall, float near, My Emeric, that no Angel's voice but thine Welcome thy Samor to his opening heaven: And if I vanquish, Britain and the Lord Take to your hecatomb one Saxon more. Onward Argantyr sprung, as wanton boy To the cool health of summer streamlet pure. Around, above, beneath, his winged sword Leaps in its fiery joy; red, fierce, and far As from a midnight furnace start the sparks. As brazen statue on proud palace top Shakes off the pelting tempest, so endur'd Samor; but not in patient hope austere Of victory, but habitual skill and power Protracting long the cold indifferent strife. Till twice that sword that in its downward sweep Flash'd the white sunlight, cloudy rose and dim With ominous purple: then his nature burst Its languid bonds; not front alone to front, But soul to soul the riot of the fight They mingle. Like to giddy chariot wheels The whirling of their swords, as fierce the din Of buckler brast, helm riven, and breast-plate cloven, As when the polar wind the ice field rends. Such nobleness sublime of hideous fight From Ilion's towers her floating mantled dames Saw not; nor Thebes, when Capaneus call'd down Jove's thunder, and disdain'd its fall: nor pride Of later Bards, when mad Orlando met On that frail bridge the giant Sarzan king, And with him in the boiling flood dash'd down. Ariosto. Orlando Furioso. Canto xxix. 47, &amp;c. Till that fond eagerness, that brave delight O'erpower'd frail nature, breathless each, and each Careless, yet conscious of deep trenching wounds, For admiration paus'd, for hope, for power To satiate the unwearying strong desire. Argantyr first descried the distant hills Radiant with spearmen, and he cried, “Away, 'Tis Hengist with his bloody bands, I know The motion of his crest; brave Chief, away.”— “Away! and leave Argantyr here to boast Samor hath fled him!”—“Oh, we meet again; Thou art a quarry for the Gods, base lance Must ne'er vaunt blood of thine. Argantyr spares But for himself such noble game. Still here! Froward and furious, if thou need'st must die, Why so must I. Fell Hengist will not spare An inch of quivering life on all thy limbs: And I with such a jealous lust pursue A noble conquest o'er thee, I must shield Thy life with mine, for my peculiar fame; Freely mine own death on the hazard cast, For such a precious stake as slaying thee.” As through dusk twilight stolen, love-breathless maid, For interchange of gentle vows, by noise Startled of envious footstep, chides away Her lingering youth, yet for his lingering loves, Till her fond force hath driven him from her side. So earnest the brave Anglian sued to flight Reluctant Samor; o'er his sword hilt bow'd, Stood sorrowing for the wounds himself had made, That marr'd his speedier flight. Anon approach'd Hengist, encircled by his state of spears, And bright Rowena by his side. “But now Thy steed along our camp rush'd masterless, Therefore we seek thee, Anglian. How! thou bleed'st! And strange! thy foeman bites not the red earth. What might hath scathless met Argantyr's steel?” “He, gasp'd he here in death, thy soul would dance, The Wanderer!”—“He! he wars but on soft boys, He dare not front Argantyr.”—“False, 'tis false!” Burst from Rowena; “he dares deeds our Gods Had shrunk from (Hengist's cloudy brow she mark'd), Or whence his proud claim to my father's hate?”— “Where hath the Recreant fled? Pursue, pursue!” Cried Hengist. “Hast thou wings to cleave the air? Or windest the deep bosom of the earth, Thou may'st o'ertake. Yet Samor is not now,” He said, “as Samor was; were Samor more, Earth and Argantyr had been wed ere now.” So spake the Anglian; leap'd Rowena's heart In hope, in shame, in anguish, in delight. “Oh, hath my softness sunk so deep, to change Thy steadfast nature, yet thus chang'd, thy might Wrests honour from thy foeman's lips.”—“Oh now,” Laughing in baffled bitterness, exclaim'd The Saxon King, “now weave we softer nets To toil this dangerous Wanderer. What say'st thou, Fair-ey'd Rowena, now thou hast cast off Thy fond, thy love-sick Vortigern? Perchance The sunshine of thy beauty might melt down This savage to a tame submissive slave.” Rowena, whose proud look with beauteous awe Smote her beholders, wore her loveliness As though she gloried in its power; now close Crowded o'er all, her face her mantle's folds, That ill conceal'd the purple fire within. Then forward pass'd they to the Saxon camp. But far by Wye's green marge had Samor fled; Till now the ebbing blood with short quick throb Beat at his heart, his languid feet were clogg'd With the thick forest leaves, the keen air search'd With a cold thrill his wounds. He falls, scarce sobs; “Merciful God, on this in all my life The sole, the single day I would not die.” Then faint, and sickly, an oppressive rest Seal'd sight and sense. When sleep fell on him, eve Was gathering fast, but when he woke, morn shot From the grey east her faint pellucid light. His blood was stanch'd, a soothing coolness lay On his mild wounds; the rude arch of the boughs Seem'd woven with officious care, to veil The bright Sun from his eyelids; the dry leaves Were gathered round him, like a feathery couch. He lay and listen'd; a soft step approach'd Light as the wren along the unshaking spray; And o'er him lean'd a maiden, pale, yet blithe With tinge of joy, that settled hue. “Is't thou, Gentle Myfanwy?”—“Oh, thou wak'st at length; I long'd to tell thee what sweet dreams have sooth'd My sorrows since we parted; in my sleep My parents came, and with them that fond youth, And they smil'd on him kindly. Think'st thou God Can have such mercy on sins dark as mine!”— “God's choicest blessings pay thy timely care Of me, sweet maiden.”—“Pardon me, oh thou, Heaven pardon me, when first I saw thee cold, Helpless, and bleeding, evil thoughts arose Of my poor Abisa's untimely death.” But deeper meditation Samor's mind Beset. “Almighty, truly thou ordain'st Wisdom from infant lips; what moral high Breathes in this simple maid's light-hearted smiles! And I, for wisdom fam'd, for pride of mind, Insulted with weak doubts thy infinite, Illimitable goodness; she so soft, So delicate, so sinful and so sad, Springs on her airy plumes of hope to thee. Oh, were mine guilt of act, not thought, the stain Thy fount of living mercy might efface.” He pressed a kiss upon her cheek so pure Even Abisa had granted it. “Farewell, My kind preserver, cherish thou thy hope, As 'twere an infant fondling on thy breast.” And fresh with hope, like gay stag newly bath'd, Forth on his voyage lone the Avenger past.

The many fountains, that glide wandering down Plinlimmon's huge round side, with murmurs smooth Flow round him; Idris, that like warrior old His batter'd and fantastic helmet rears, Scattering the elements' wrath, frowns o'er his way A broad irregular duskiness. Aloof Snowdon, the triple-headed giant, soars, Clouds rolling half way down his rugged sides. Slow as he trod amid their dizzy heights, Their silences and dimly mingling sounds, Rushing of torrents, roar of prison'd winds; O'er all his wounded soul flow'd strength, and pride, And hardihood; again his front soar'd up To commerce with the skies, and frank and bold His majesty of step his rugged path Imprinted. So in old poetic faith Hyperion from his native Delian bowers, 'Mid the rich music of those sisters nine, Walk'd the bright heights of Helicon, and shook His forehead's clustering glories wide, and flush'd The smoothness of his fair immortal face With purple Godhead. Whence, ye mountains, whence The spirit that within your secret caves Holds kindred with man's soul? Is't that your pomp Of exaltation, your aërial crowns In their heaven-scaling rivalry, cast forth Bold sympathies of loftiness, and scorn Contagious? or in that your purer air, Where, fresh and virgin from its golden fount, Lies the fine light at morning, or at eve Melts upward and resolves itself from earth, The soul, unwound its coarse material chains, Basks in its own divinity, and feels There in the verge and portal of the heavens The neighbourhood of brighter worlds unseen? Where the blue Glasslyn hurries her fleet course To wanton on the yellow level sands, On either side in sheer ascent abrupt The rocks, like barriers that in elder time Wall'd the huge cities of the Anakim, Upblacken to the sky, whose tender blue With mild relief salutes th' o'erlabour'd sight. There on the scanty, slippery, way, that winds With the stream's windings, Samor loiters on. But who art thou, that in the Avenger's path Standest in dark serenity? what joy Instinct amid thy thick black locks reveals The full voluptuous quietude within? Oh, Prophet! in thy wanderings wide and far Amid the pregnant hours of future time, Haply the form of Samor, disarray'd Calamity's sad vesture, hath appear'd In plenitude of glory. Hence thine eye With recognition glad and bright salutes The Man of Fate. To earth that Prophet old Bow'd down, then look'd he on the waters dark, Then upward to the mountains. “Stony earth, Within thy secret bosom feel'st not thou A wondrous presence? dwells not, thou blue stream, Under thy depth of waves a silent awe?— Yea, Snowdon, lift thou up in sternest pride Thy cloudy mantled brow; ye know him all, Ye know the Avenger.”—“Merlin, mock not thou Thy fellow creature of the dust, the child Of sin and sorrow, with o'erlabour'd phrase, Abasing the immortal elements From their high calm indifference to sense Of our light motions. Simple truth severe Beseems the lips of age. Oh, holy famed And sage, how ill strong Wisdom's voice melts down To the faint chime of flattery.”—“Poor of pride! Feeble of hope! thou seest thyself forlorn, An hunted wanderer in thy native land. I see thee clad in victory and revenge, Thy glory sailing wide on all the winds, Triumphant with thy blessings at thy feet Thy own fair Britain: Fate so freely spreads Her mystic volume to my sight.”—“Oh, blind, And ignorant as blind our insect race! The mole would count the sunbeams, the blind worm Search the hid jewels in the depths of earth; And man, dim dreamer, would invade the heavens, Self-seated in the Almighty's councils read The secrets of Omniscience, yea, with gaze Familiar scrutinize the Inscrutable. I tell thee, Merlin, that the soul of man Is destiny on earth! God gave us limbs To execute, and intellect to will Or good or evil, and his unseen Spirit Our appetites of holiness, else faint And wavering, doth corroborate: hence man's deeds Of glory and of virtue all are God's. If yet this heart unwearied may bear on, Nor from its holy purpose faintly swerve, Praise be to God, its fate is pride and joy. But if, and oh the peril! it play false Its country's lofty hazard, shall it shift On wayward destiny its sloth and sin? Evil is not, where man no evil wills, And good is not, where will not man and God.” “Chief wise as brave! as to our feeble sight Yon pebble's slight circumference, the Past, The Present, and the Future of this world Are to the All-seeing vision; oft doth Heaven In sign and symbol duskily reveal The unborn future; oft Fate's chariot wheels Are harbinger'd by voices that proclaim The manner of their coming: gifted Seers Feel on their lips articulate the deeds Of later days; and dim oracular sights Crowd the weak eyes, till pall'd attention faint To dizziness.”—“Oh, Merlin, time hath been When in the guilty cities the Lord's voice Hath spoken by his Prophets, hath made quail, By apparitions ominous and dire, Strong empires on their unassailed height. But oh, for us of this devoted isle, Drench'd with the vials of Almighty wrath, To gaze up, and beseech the clouds to rain Bright miracles on this heaven-wasted land—” “Shame choke thy speech, despondent slanderer! thee, Avenger! this from thee! Away! my lips Burn with the fire of heaven, my heart flows o'er With gladness and with glory. Peerless Isle, How dost thou sit amid thy blue domain Of ocean, like a sceptred Queen! The bonds Like flax have wither'd from thy comely limbs. Thou, the strong freedom of thy untam'd locks Shaking abroad, adornest God's fair world. Thou noblest Eden of man's fallen state, Apart and sever'd from the common earth, Even like a precious jewel! deep and far In the abyss of time thy dawn of pride Still with a fuller and more constant blaze Grows to its broad meridian; and Time's rolls Are silent of thy setting. Oh, how fair The steps of freemen in thy vales of peace; Thy broad towns teem with wealth, thy yellow fields Laugh in their full fertility; thy bays Whiten and glisten with thy myriad barks. The Angels love thee, and the airs of heaven Are gladden'd by thy holy hymns, while Faith Sits on thy altars, like a nestling dove, In unattainted snowiness of plume.” “Now, by my soul, thou strange and solemn Man! Mistrust thee more I dare not; be't a dream Or revelation of immortal truth, Of Britain's fame I cannot choose but hear With a child's transport.” Then the Prophet shook The dark profusion of his swelling hair With a stern triumph; then his aged eye Grew restless with delight: his thin white hand Closing around the warrior's arm, lay there Like a hard glove of steel. He led him on, Till now the black and shaggy pass spread out To a green quiet valley, after named The Bed of Gelert, that too-faithful hound Slain fondly by his erring Lord. I must refer to my old friend Wm. Spencer's spirited Ballad of “Bethgelert.” The stream Here curl'd more wanton, lightly wafting down The last thin golden leaves the alders dropt, Like fairy barges skimming the blue waves. That stream o'erpass'd, rightward their silent way Lay to the foot of Snowdon. Pause was none: They front the steep ascent, and upward wind A long, sheer, toilsome path; their footfalls strike Upon the black bare stillness, audible As in thick forest the lone woodman's axe. 'Twas strange, yet slack'd not that old reverend Man His upward step, as though the mountain air Were his peculiar element, still his breath Respir'd unlabouring, lively bounded on His limbs, late slow and tremulous. Three long hours, Now front to front upon that topmost peak, Erwydfa, This is the name of the loftiest of the three peaks of Snowdon. sit they motionless, alone: As when two vultures on some broken tower, That beetles o'er a dismal battle field, In dark and greedy patience ruminate Their evening feast, a stillness as of sleep Heaves in their ruffled plumes, their deep bright eyes Half clos'd in languid rest; so undisturb'd, So lofty, sat the Avenger and the Seer. The atmosphere, that palls our restless world, Lay coiling in its murky folds below: So in some regal theatre, when droops The unfolding curtain, and within it shrouds The high disastrous passions, crimes, and woes Erewhile that fretted on its pomp of scene; Thus Earth, with all its solemn tragedies, Heroic vauntings, sumptuous imageries, Was veil'd in silent darkness from their sight. The filmless, the pellucid heaven above One broad pure sheet of sunlight. “Gifted Man, (Cried Samor,) wherefore to this desolate Untrodden”?“Ha! untrodden! know ye not, Where coarse humanity defiles not, there The snowy-footed Angels lightly skim The taintless soil, the fragrance of their plumes Fans the pure air, where chokes no breath of sin The limpid current? Desolate! the motes, Which flicker in the sun, are few and rare To the immortal faces, which smile down, Exquisite transport on the ravish'd sense. Here, from their kindred elements, emanate The festive creatures of the heavenly fields, Glories, and Mercies, and Beatitudes: Some dropping on the silent summer dews, Some trembling on the rainbow's violet verge, Some rarely charioteering on the wings Of the mild winds, in moonlight some.—Why shakes The Man of Vengeance? wherefore of mine hand This passionate wringing?”—“Tell me, truly tell; The name of Emeric, from some mild-lipp'd tone Hath it e'er trembled on thine ear? Old Man! Is't sin to say her presence might adorn That gentle company?”—“To souls like thine, Warrior, Heaven grants sweet intercourse and free With its beatified.”—“Ah, now thou rak'st The ashes of a buried grief: gone all, My gentle visitations broken off, My spirit's fond discoursings silent, ceas'd! Oh, I talk idly, Prophet, speak thou on.” “Warrior! no more of soft and gentle sights! Grandeurs there are, to which the gates of heaven Set wide their burnish'd portals: midnight feels Cherubic splendours ranging her dun gloom, The tempests are ennobled by the state Of high seraphic motion. I have seen I, Merlin, have beheld. It stood in light, It spake in sounds, for earth's gross winds too pure. Between the midnight and the morn 'twas here; I lay, I know not if I slept or woke, Yet mine eyes saw. Long, long this heart had yearn'd, Mid those rich passings and majestic shows, For shape distinct, and clear perspicuous sound. It burst at length, yea, front to front it stood, The Immortal Presence. I clench'd up the dust In the agony and rapture of my fear, And my soul wept with terror and deep joy. It stood upon the winds, an Angel plum'd And mail'd and crown'd; his plumes cast forth a tinge, Like blood, on th' air around: his arms, in shape Etherial panoply complete, in hue Like moonlight on the dark Llanberis lake, A bright blue rippling glitter; for his crown, Palm leaves of orient light his brow enwreath'd, That bloom'd in fair divinity of wrath, And beautiful relentlessness austere. Knowledge was in my heart, and on my lips; I felt him, who he was.—‘Archangel! hail, Destroyer! art not thou God's Delegate, To break the glassy glories of this world? The gem-knosp'd diadem, the ivory ball, Sceptre and sword, imperial mantle broad, The Lord of Nations, Thundershaft of war, Are glorious on the pale submissive earth: Thou com'st, and lo, for throne, for sword, for king, Bare ashes and thin dust. Thou art, that aye Smoulder'st the rich-tower'd cities to rude heaps Of lazy moss-stones; and aye after thee Hoots Desolation, like a dank-wing'd owl, Upon the marble palaces of Kings. Thou wert, when old Assyrian Nineveh Sank to a pool of waters, waste and foul. Thou, when the Median's brow the massy tiar Let fall: and when the Grecian's brazen throne Sever'd and split to the four winds: and now Consummatest thy work of wreck and scorn, Even on Rome's Cæsars, making the earth sick Of its own hollowness. Archangel! Hail, Vicegerent of destruction! Cupbearer, That pour'st the bitter liquor of Heaven's wrath! A lamentable homage pay I thee, And sue thee tell, if Britain's days are full, Her lips for thy sad beverage ripe.’ Thereat Earthward his sunny spear its lurid point Declin'd: and lo, a White Horse, through the land Ranging in stately speed; our city gates Shrunk open at his coming, our fair fields Wither'd before his fiery flashing breath. Triumph was in the trampling of his feet, And the strong joy of mockery, for he trod On broken principalities; his mane Familiar Conquest, as a rushing wind, Fann'd in loose brilliant streamings.”—“False-lipp'd Seer, Thou spak'st of gladness, and thy ominous tone Is darkness and dismay.”—“Hark, Warrior, hark: That wanton mane was trail'd down to the dust, That fiery trampling falter'd to dull dread, That pale victorious steed, Thee, Thee I saw Visible as thou stand'st, with mastering arm Drag down, and on his strong and baffled neck Full trod thy iron-sandal'd heel. The sight Was wine unto my soul, aloud I laugh'd, And mock'd the ruinous Seraph in the clouds. “Yet stood he in the quiet of his wrath, Angelic Expectation, that awaits, Calmly, till God accomplish God's high will, Full on his brow. Then stoop'd the spear again, And lo, Seven Steeds, like that pale One, bestrode The patient Isle, and they that on them rode Wore diadem and regal pall; The Heptarchy. then rose To war against those royal riders fierce, From a round table, Knights in sunlike arms, Shields bossy with rich impress quaint, and fair Their coursers, as the fire-hoof'd steeds of Morn. To white-arm'd Ladies in a stately court Bards hymn'd the deeds of that fam'd chivalry, The Wars of Arthur against the Saxons. And their crown'd captain's title smote mine ear, ‘Arthur of Bretagne.’—Years went rolling on, Cloudy, discordant, and tempestuous years, For the sword reap'd the harvest of the land, And battle was the may-game of her sons. And lo, a Raven o'er the Eastern sea The Danish Standard, the Reafan. Swoop'd desolation on the Isle; her wings Blasted wheree'er they wav'd, the earth wept blood In her foul talons' gripe. But he that rode On the White Steed, the Sovereign of the Land, (Patience, Avenger, patience!) fair was he That Sovereign, as the virgin's spring-tide dream, Holy as new anointed Christian Priest, Valiant as warrior burnish'd for the fight, Fond and ecstatic, as love-dreaming Bard, Solemn and wise, as old Philosopher, Stately as kingborn lion in the wood; As he his fine face heavenward turn'd in prayer, The Angels bent down from their throning clouds, To wonder at that admirable King: Sky-wandering voices peal'd in transport out— ‘Alfred!’ the baffled Raven cower'd aloof, The isle look'd up to heaven in peace and joy. “Still stood he there, betwixt me and the sun, Th' Archangel; not in sleep, nor senselessness Absorb'd, but terrible inaction spread Over his innate menace. Oh, I strove, Yet dared not hope the dregs of wrath were drain'd, The mission of dismay fulfill'd and done. Yet had those wings of fatal hue droop'd down Folded and motionless, enwreathing light Had crept and wound around that dusky spear. At once that light fell off; at once those wings Started asunder, and spread wide and red The rain of desolation: thicker roll'd The pedestal of clouds on which he stood, As to sustain the effort of his wrath. Again the Eastern Raven snuff'd our air, The frantic White Horse laved his hoofs in blood: Till from the Southern Continent sprung forth A Leopard, on the ocean shore he ramp'd. Woe to the White Horse, to the Raven woe, Woe for the title of the Leopard Lord, The Conqueror! and a Bell I heard, that sway'd Along the isle, and froze it into peace With its majestic tyranny of sound. The Norman Banner.—The Curfew. “But he, upon the air, th' Archangel, he, The summons of whose eye from climes remote Beckon'd those grisly ministers of wrath, Northward he look'd, no northern ruin came; To th' East, there all was still; the South, nor shape Nor sound; the West, calm stretch'd th' unruffled sea. Ha! thought I, earth hath now no ruin more, The race of havoc is extinct for us, Angel of wreck, away! thy task is o'er; Majestic Mischief, from our isle away! He went not; as an earthquake's second shock, With dreadful longing watch'd I what might come; Moments were years; and lo, the Island's sons Nor Briton they, nor Saxon, nor the stock Of those new comers, but from each had flow'd All qualities of honour and renown, The foul dishonest dregs had drain'd away, And the rich quintessence, unmix'd, unsoil'd, An harmony of energies sublime, Knit in that high-brow'd people. Courtesy, Death-scorning valour, Fame's immortal thirst, And Honour inbreath'd like the life of life. Then rose that strong Archangel, and he smote The bosom of the land; at once leap'd up That mighty people. Here a Snow-white Rose, And there a Red, with fatal blossoming, Wars of York and Lancaster. And deadly fragrance, maddening all the land. I heard, I saw—ah, impious sights and sounds! Two war-cries in one tongue, two banner-rolls Wov'n in one loom, two lances from one forge, Two children from one womb, in conflict met: 'Gainst brother brother's blood cried out to heaven; And he that rent the vizor of his foe, Look'd through the shatter'd bars, and saw his son. Hah, Britain! in thine entrails dost thou flesh Thy ravine! thy Baronial castles blaze With firebrands from their hospitable hearths. “Mercy, I cried aloud, thou Merciless! Destroy no more, Destroyer! Prone I fell, And hid mine aching eyes deep in the dust; So from my shrinking memory to shut out Those wars unnatural. Pass'd a sound at length As of a Wild Boar hunted to his death; Battle of Bosworth, death of Richard. The bristly boar in infant gore Wallows beneath the thorny shade. —Gray. I rais'd mine head, still there the Archangel stood; Another pause, another gleam of hope. But in that quiet interval me-seem'd Trumpetings, as of victory from the sea, Flow'd o'er the Isle, and glories beam'd abroad From a triumphant throne, where sate elate A Virgin: all around her Poets' harps Strew'd flowers of amaranth blooming; and methought Joy rose and solemn welcoming in Heaven Of a pure incense, that from all the Isle Soar'd to the unapproached throne of God. Elizabeth and the Reformation. “Then saw I through the Isle, a River broad And full, and they that drank thereof look'd up, Like children dropt forth from a nobler world, So powerful that proud water work'd within, Freshening the body and the soul: and each Courage array'd and a frank simple strength. The river's name was Freedom: her fair tide So pleasant thrall'd mine eye, I saw not rise Th' Archangel's spear: th' earth's reeling woke me then. For lo, upon a thone, a gallant Prince, Charles the First. That with misguided sceptre strove to check That powerful stream: at which the rebel tide Swell'd up with indignation, and aloof Stood gathering its high-cresting waves; down came The deluge, that fair throne, and all its strong Nobility of pillars, with a crash Fell to the earth; while they that drank rush'd forth Inebriate with excess of that fierce stream, And cast a bloody sacrifice, that head Endiadem'd with royalty, to glut The tide implacable. 'Tis sad to hear, Aye Samor, what was it to see! Brave Chief, Cold winter leads the pleasant summer on, The night must darken ere the morning dawn. The summer came, the morning dawn'd: I saw The arch'd heavens open o'er the angelic shape, And upward, like a cloud, he mingled in To the sky's cloudiness. I cried aloud ‘For ever!’ the close settling in the heaven Seem'd to reply ‘For ever.’ Not with him Pass'd off my vision fair. Another throne Stood by the venturous margin of that stream; Then merriment, and loose harp'd wantonness Smooth'd the late ruffled air; immodest tones, To which fair forms in dancing motion swam: They paus'd, then dark around that throne it seem'd, Whereat those holy hymns that scarce had ceas'd To float up in their airy-winged course, Fainting, began to tremble and break off. Court of Charles II. That stream again collected its full wrath, And foamy menace. When behold, a fleet Came tilting o'er the ocean waves, and cast A Princess and a Warrior on the shore, And kingly crowns William and Mary. The Revolution of 1688. around their brows august Out blossom'd. On the throne they took their seat; Soar'd gladness on the wings of those pure hymns; And the majestic stream in sunlight flow And full rejoicing murmur, all its waves Wafted around the high unshaken throne. Now listen with thy soul, not with thine ears, Briton! beside that stream a Tree sprang out, With ever-mounting height, and amplitude Aye-spreading; deep in earth its gnarled roots Struck down, as though to strengthen this frail world: Its crown amid the clouds seem'd soaring up To calmness high above our troubled sphere. And its broad branches spread so wide, its shade Lay upon distant realms; one golden bright, Close by the cradle of the infant sun, And others in new western worlds remote; And from that mystic river, Freedom, flow'd A moisture like the sap of life, that fed And fertilized the spacious Tree; the gales Of ocean with a gorgeous freshness flush'd The beauty of its foliage. Blossoms rare Were on it; holy deeds, that in the airs Of heaven delicious smelt, and fruits on earth Shower'd from it; making its sad visage smile, For life and hope and bliss were in their taste. Amid the state of boughs twin Eagles built Their eyries, Victory and Renown, and swung In rapturous sport with the tumultuous winds, But birds obscene Dishonour, Shame, Dismay, Scar'd by the light of the bright leaves, aloof Far wheel'd their sullen flight, nor dar'd to stoop. I saw the nations graft their wasted trunks From those broad boughs of beauty and of strength, And dip their drain'd urns in that sacred stream. But underneath its holiest shade there stood A Throne, an Altar, and a Senate-house. Upon the throne a King sate, triple-crown'd As by three kingdoms; voices eloquent, In harmony of discord, fulmin'd forth From that wise Senate: in swift intercourse To and fro from heaven's crystal battlements To that pure altar Angels stoop'd their flight. And through the sunny boughs Philosophers Held commerce with the skies, and drew from thence The stars to suffer their sage scrutiny; And Poets sent up through th' embowering vault Such wond'rous harmonies, the charm'd air seem'd Forgetful of its twinkling motion dim. “Oh, admirable Tree! thou shalt not fall By foreign axe, or slow decay within! The tempests strengthen thee, the summer airs Corrupt not, but adorn. Until that tide, Freedom, the Inexhaustible, exhaust, Lives thy coeval Immortality.” The Prophet ceas'd: still Samor on his face, That in solemnity of firm appeal Look'd heavenward, with a passionate belief Gaz'd, and a glad abandonment. “Ha, Seer, But now when thou begann'st 'twas noon of day, And now deep night. Yea, Merlin, and by night The Tamer of the White Steed must go forge His iron curb.” Forth like a cataract He burst, and bounded down the mountain side. “Yet once again, tumultuous world, I plunge Amid thy mad abyss; thou proud and fierce, I come to break and tame thee! see ye not, Wise Hengist! strong Caswallon! how the sand Is under your high-towering thrones, the worm Is in your showy palms.” And then a pause Of tumult and proud trembling in his soul. And, “False it was not, but a gleam vouchsaf'd From the eternal orb of truth, the sense That inbred and ingrain'd with my soul's life, Hath made of Britain to this leaping heart A name not only to be deeply lov'd, But full of pride and majesty. I feel, And from my earliest consciousness have felt, That in the wide hereafter, where old Fate Broods o'er the unravelling web of human things, Wov'n by the Almighty, spreads thy tissue broad In light, among the dark and mazy threads: Vicissitude or mutability Quench not its desolate lustre, on it winds Unbroken, unattainted, unobscur'd.” So pass'd he, who had seen, him then had deem'd, By the proud steedlike tossing of his crest, His motion like the uncheck'd August sun Travelling the cloudless vacancy of air, A monarch for his summer pastime gone Into the shady grove, with courtier train, And plumed steed, and laden sumpter mule, Cool canopy, and velvet carpeting. But he beneath the sleety winter sky, Even his hard arms bit into by the keen And searching airs, houseless, by hazard found His coarse irregular fare, his drink, the ice Toilsomely broken from the stiff black pool. The furr'd wolf in the mossy oaken trunk Lapp'd himself from the beating snow, but on Went Samor with unshivering naked foot. The tempest from the mountain side tore down The pine, like a scath'd trophy casting it To moulder in the vale, but Samor's brow Fronted the rude sky. The free torrent felt The ice its rushing turbulence o'ergrow, Translucent in its cold captivity It hung, but Samor burst the invading frost Of cold despair from his free soul, and mov'd Uncheck'd along his deep unfathom'd course. And thou, wild Deva, The Dee. Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream. Milton's Lycidas. how hast thou foregone Thy summer music, and thy sunny play Of eddies whitening 'mid thy channel stones. Bard-belov'd river, on whose green-fring'd brink The imaginative Grecian sure had feign'd 'Twixt thy smooth Naiads, and the Sylvans rude Of thy grey woods, stol'n amorous intercourse. With such a slow reluctance thou delay'st Under the dipping branches, that flap up, With every shifting motion of the wind, Thy limpid moisture, and with serpent coil Dost seem as thou would'st mingle with thyself To wander o'er again the same lov'd course. Now lies thy ice-bound bosom mute and flat As marble pavement, thy o'ershadowing woods One bare, brown leaflessness, that faintly drop At intervals the heavy icicles, Like tears upon a monumental stone. But though thy merry waters and brisk leaves Are silent, with their close-couch'd birds of song; Even in this blank dead season, music loves Thy banks, and sounds harmonious must be heard Even o'er thy frozen waters. 'Twas a hymn, From a low chapel by the river side, Came struggling through the thick and hazy air; And made a gushing as of tears flow o'er The Wanderer's soul; the form winds could not bow, Nor crazing tempests, those soft sounds subdue; Those dews of music melt into the frame Of adamant, proof against the parching frost. Under the porch he glided in, and knelt Unnotic'd in the throng: whose motion sway'd The beasts of ravine, he before his God Wore nought distinctive; save of those bruis'd reeds Was he the sorest bruis'd; and deepest seem'd The full devotion settling round his heart. More musical than the music, on that soul, So long inured to savage scenes and wild, Came the sensation of a face belov'd. The calm of that old reverend brow, the glow Of its thin silver locks, was like a flash Of sunlight in the pauses of a storm. For lo! the white stol'd Bishop lifting up His arms, his parting benison descends Like summer rain upon his flock. Whose ear, Oh, holy Germain, felt thy gentle tones As Samor's? ah, when last thy saintly brow For him look'd heavenward, and less tremulous then Thy voice on him breath'd blessing, 'twas in times Far brighter, at that jocund bridal hour When Emeric, rosy between shame and joy, Stood with him by the altar side:—“Thus live In love till life's departure;”—Such thy prayer! Vain prayer! and blessing ne'er to be enjoyed! The throng hath parted; in the House of God Still knelt the armed man; with pressure strong He clasp'd old Germain's hand—“Good Bishop, thou Art skill'd in balancing our earthly sins. I was a man, whose high ambitious head Seem'd among God's bright stars; I deem'd this earth A lowly place, whose dust my feet shook off With an heaven-gifted scorn; so far, so high Seem'd I above its tainting elevate. At midnight, on my slumber came the sin; I will not say how exquisite and fair; Mine eyelids sprung apart to drink it in, My soul leap'd up to clasp it, and the folds Of passion, like a fiery robe, wrapt in My nature: I had fall'n, but bounteous Heaven Of its most blest permitted one t' extend A snow-white arm of rescue.”—“The hot tears Corrode and fret the warrior's brazen helm; I will not ask thee if thine outward eyes, Hath thy soul wept?”—“Aye, Bishop, tears of blood; Sorrow and shame weigh'd down my nerveless arm, And clipp'd th' aspiring plumage of my soul; Within mine own heart scorn hiss'd at me.”—“Well, Strong Man of arms! hast fought the inward fight, And God remit thy sins, as I remit.” “Then take thou to thine arms thy ancient friend.” So saying, up rose Samor, like a star Out of the ocean, shining his bright face With the pure dews of penitence. But he, The old man, fell upon his neck and wept, As though th' endearing name, “my Son,” were voic'd By nature, not by saintly use; a sound Not of the lips, but th' overflowing heart. Their's was a broken conference, drear thoughts Of anguish, desolation, and despair, So moulded up with recollections sweet, They made the sunken visage smile through tears. 'Tis th' one poor luxury the wretched have To speak of wretchedness—yet brief their speech, “Vengeance and Vigilance,” the stern adieu Even in that hoary Bishop's ear, he parts. But by the Bishop's side, just there where knelt Th' Avenger, a new form: 'twas man in garb, But the thin fringing of the humid eye, The delicate wanderings of the rosy veins, The round full alabaster of the skin, The briefness of the modest sliding step, Something of womanly composure smooth, Even in the close and girt habiliments, Belied the stern appearance.—“Priest, with him But now who parted, is my soul allied In secret, close society; his faith Must be my faith, his God my God.”—“Fair youth, I question not by what imperious tie Of admiration or strong love thou'rt led; For as the Heavens with silent power intense Draw upward the light mists and fogs of earth, And, steeping them in glory, hang them forth Fresh, renovate, and radiant; virtue holds The like attractive influence, draws around Souls light and earthly-tainted, till they catch The fair contagion of her beauty, beam With her imparted light. Hear, heathen youth, Hear and believe.” As when beneath the nave Tall arching, the Cathedral organ 'gins Its prelude, lingeringly exquisite Within retir'd, the bashful sweetness dwells; Anon like sunlight, or the floodgate rush Of waters, bursts it forth, clear, solemn, full: It breaks upon the mazy fretted roof; It coils up round the clustering pillars tall; It leaps into the cell-like chapels; strikes Beneath the pavement sepulchres; at once The living temple is instinct, ablaze With the uncontrolled exuberance of sound. So with persuasive gentleness began The mitred Preacher, winning audience close: Then rising up, the rapid argument Soar'd to the Empyrean, linking earth With heaven by golden chains of eloquence; Till the mind with its faculties and powers Lay floating, self-surrender'd in the deep Of admiration. Wondrous 'twas to see, With the transitions of the Holy Creed, The workings of that regular bright face; Now ashy blank, now glittering bright, now dew'd With fast sad tears, now with a weeping smile, Now heavy with droop'd eyelids, open now With forehead arch'd in rapture; 'till at last Listening she stood with mute suspended breath. But as the voice severe wound up the strain, And from the heavenly history to enforce The everlasting moral, 'gan extort, From the noviciate in the jealous faith, Passionless purity, and life sincere From all the soft indulgences of sin; Forbidden in the secret heart to shrine A dear unlawful image, to reserve A sad and narrow sanctuary for desire: Then stood in speechlessness, yet suppliant, With snowy arms outstretch'd, and quivering loose, The veiling mantle thrown in anguish back, Confest the Woman: starting from their band, Like golden waters o'er a marble bed, Flow'd out her long locks o'er her half-bare neck. “To tell me that in such cold solemn tones, All, all unwelcome, bitter as it is, I must believe, for its oppressive truth Loads my lost soul, and he believes it all: To tell it me here, here, where all around Linger his vestiges, where the warm air Yet hath the motion of his breath, the sound Of his departing footsteps beating yet Upon my heart. Long sought! and found in vain! In sunshine have I sought thee and in shade; O'er mountain have I track'd thee, and through vale; The clouds have wrapp'd thee, but I lost thee not, The torrents drown'd thy track, but not from me, I dared not meet thee, but I sought thee still: To me forbid, alone to me, what all The coarse and common things of nature may; The airs of heaven may touch thee, I may not; All human eyes behold thee—all but mine. And thou, the senseless, enviable dust! May'st cherish the round traces of his limbs, His fresh fair image must away from me. Oh that I were the dust whereon thou tread'st, Even though I felt thee not!”—And is this she, The Virgin of the festal hall, who won A kingdom for a smile, nor deign'd regard Its winning, and who stoop'd to be a Queen? And is this she, whose coming on the earth Was like the morn in her impearled car, Loftiest or loveliest which, 'twere bold to say? She whose enamouring scorn fell, luxury-like, On her beholders, blest in her contempt? This she, the Lady of her summer bark, To whom the sunshine and the airs, and all Th' inconstant waters play'd the courtier smooth; That cast a human feeling of delight, At her bewitching presence, o'er the blind Unconscious forms of nature? Is this she! Those rich lips, for a monarch's banquet meet, Visiting the dust with frantic kiss; thus low, Thus desolate, thus fallen, of her fall Careless, so deep in shame, yet unasham'd! But thou, Heaven-reconcil'd, on earth the seal'd, The anointed by the prophet's gladdening oils, God's instrument! hath midnight now resum'd Its spirit-wafting function? Emeric, she On earth so mild, in her had anger seem'd Unnatural as a war-song on a lute, As blood upon the pinion of a dove. In heaven hath she her heavenly qualities Unlearnt? is she the angel now in all But its best part, forgiveness? Wherefore then Does Samor from his mossy pillow, stretch'd Under the oak, uplift his head, and then Like one bliss-overcome, subside again? Half sleep, half sense he lies, his nuptial hymn, Articulate each gay and dancing word, Distinct each delicate and dwelling fall, Is somewhere in the air about him; looks Are on him of a bashful eye, too fond To turn away, too timorous to fix And rest unwavering. All the marriage rite Is acting now anew; the sunlight falls Upon the gold-clasp'd book of prayer, as then It fell, and Germain speaks as Germain spake. And Emeric, on her cheek the tear is there, Where then it hung in lucid trembling bright; The very fluttering of her yielded hand, When gliding up her finger small the ring Made her his own for ever, throbs again Upon his sensitive touch. He dares not move Lest he should break the lovely bubble frail, His tranc'd eyes stir not, lest they rove away From that delicious sight; his open hand Lies pulseless, lest the slightest change disturb That exquisite sensation; so he lies, Knowing all false, yet feeling all as true. And it was false, yet why? that is indeed, Which is to sense and sight. Ah, well beseems Us, the strong insects of an April morn; Steady and constant as the thistle's down When winds are on it; lasting as the flake Of spring snow on the warm and grassy ground: Well beseems us, ourselves, our forms, our lives, The earth we tread on, and the air we breathe, The light and glassy peopling of a dream; T' arraign our visions for their perishing, And on their unreality to rail, Ungrateful to the illusion, that deceives To rapture; and unwise, to cast away Sweet flowers because they are not amaranth. Thou, Samor, nor ungrateful nor unwise, That, 'scaping from this cold and dark below, Dost spread thee out for thy peculiar joy A land of fair imaginings, with shapes, And sounds, and motions, and sweet stillnesses Dost give up all the moon beholds to woe And tumult, but in some far quiet sphere Findest thyself a pure companionship With spirits thou did'st love, and who lov'd thee While passionate and earthly sense was theirs.

Scene of the Massacre on Salisbury Plain. Who tracks the ship along the sea of storms? Who through the dark haste of the wintry clouds Pierces to where the planet, in retired And constant motion, the blue arch of heaven Traverses? Sometimes, on the mountain top Of some huge wave, the reappearing bark Takes its high stand, with pennon fluttering far And cautious sail half furl'd, yet eminent, As of th' assaulting element in disdain. Sometimes amid the darkness falling off, And scattering from its crystal sphere away, Bursts out the argent orb refresh'd, and shows Its lamp unquenchable. Thou, Voyager 'Mid the rude waves of desolation! Star Of Britain's gloomy night! so bafflest thou My swift poetic vision! now the waves Ride o'er thee, now the clouds devour thee up; And thou art lost to sight, and dare I say Lost to thy immortality of song. Thee too anon I see emerging proud From the dusk billows of calamity, That, swoln and haughty from the recent wreck Of thy compatriot navy, thee assail With their accumulated weight of surge. Thou topp'st some high-brow'd wave, and shaking off On either side their fury, brandishest Thy solitary banner. Thee I see, Within th' embosoming midnight of the land, On gliding with smooth motion undisturb'd, And through the glimpses of the breaking gloom, Sometimes a solemn beauty sheddest forth On the distemper'd face of human things. Full in the centre of Caer Ebranc York. stood A temple, by the August Severus The Emperor Severus died at York. The remains of Roman antiquities in that city and in other parts of Britain, may perhaps justify this description. rear'd To Mavors the Implacable; what time That Cæsar stoop'd his eagles on the wreck Of British freedom, when the mountaineer, The King of Morven, if old songs be sooth, Fingal, from Carun's bloody flashing waves Shook the fled Roman on his new-built wall; And Ossian woke up on his hill of dreams, And spread the glory of his song abroad, To halo round his sceptred Hero's head. Fingal, whose fame, with that of his heroes and bards, has been revived in our language, by a recent publication, is said to have commanded the Caledonians in that memorable juncture, to have eluded the power of Severus, and to have obtained a signal victory on the banks of the Carun, in which the son of the King of the world, Caracul, fled from his arms along the field of his pride. Gibbon, ch. VI. vol. i. p. 220. Edit. 1839. If Gibbon might indulge the pleasing supposition that Fingal lived, and that Ossian sung, this was at least good poetic authority for adopting this notion. But not the less his work of pride pursued Th' imperial Roman; up the pillars rose, Slow lengthening out their long unbroken lines; In delicate solidity advanc'd, And stately grace, toward the sky, till met By the light massiveness of roof, that sloped Down on their flowery capitals. Nor knew That man of purple and of diadem The Universal Architect at work, Framing for him a narrow building dark, The grave's lone building. Th' emperor, and his bones, Into the blank of things forgot and past Had moulder'd; but this proud enduring pile, By wild weeds overgrown, by yellow hues Of age deep tinted, still a triumph wrought O'er time, and Christian disregard; and stood As though to mock its builder's perishing. Upon the eastern pediment stood out A bold relief, where the tumultuous stone Was nobly wrought into a fit device For th' immortal Homicide within: it showed His coming on the earth; the God had burst The gates of Janus, that fell shattering back Behind him, from the wall the rearing steeds Sprung forth, and with their stony hoofs the air Insulted. Them Bellona urg'd, abroad Her snaky locks from her bare wrinkled brow Went scattering; forward th' haggard charioteer Lean'd, following to the coursers' reeking flanks The furrowing scourge with all herself, and hung Over their backs half fury, and half joy, As though to listen to their bruising hoofs, That trampled the thick massacre. Erect Behind, with shield drawn in and forward spear, The con'd helm finely shaped to th' arching brow, The God stood up within the car, that seem'd To rush whenever the fleet wind swept by. His brow was glory, and his arm was power, And a smooth immortality of youth, Like freshness from Elysium newly left, Touch'd with a beauty to be shudder'd at His massy shape, a lightning-like fierce grace, That makes itself admir'd, whilst it destroys. There on a throne, fronting the morning sun, Caswallon sate; his sceptre a bright sword Unsheath'd; with savage art had he broke up His helmet to the likeness of a crown, On which uncouthly set and clustering bright Rich jewels glitter'd. To his people, rang'd Upon the steps of marble sloping down, Barbaric justice minist'ring, he sate, Expounding th' absolute law of his own will; And from the abject at his feet receiv'd Homage that seem'd like worship. Not alone From his wild people, but from lips baptiz'd, Came titles that might make the patient Heavens Burst to the utterance of a laughing scorn; Might wake up from the bosom of the grave A bitter and compassionate contempt, To hear the inheritance of her dull worms, Nam'd in his dauntless and unblushing style “Unconqu'rable! Omnipotent! Supreme!” But all along the ranging column files, And all abroad the turgid laudings spread, “Unconqu'rable! Omnipotent! Supreme!” Yet he, the Stranger, whom Prince Malwyn leads, He bows not, those hymn'd flatteries seem to jar Upon his sense, so high his head he bears Above them, like a man constrain'd to walk Amid low tufts of poisonous herbs; he fronts The monarch and begins his taunting strain: “Unconqu'rable! whose conquering is the wolf's, That when the shifting battle rages yet, Steals to some desert corner of the field, And riots on the spoils. Omnipotent! Aye, as a passive weapon, wielded now, Now cast away contemptuous, for the dust To canker and to rust around. Supreme! O'er whom is Ruin on its vulture wings, Scoffing the bubble whereupon thou rid'st, And waiting Hengist's call to swoop, and pierce, And dissipate its swoln and airy pride. Whose diadem of glory, sword of power, Even breath of life, at Hengist's wayward will, Cling to thee, ready at his beck to fade, And shiver, and expire.”—“At Hengist's call! At Hengist's beck! at Hengist's!”—the word chok'd; With eyes that glared upon the Stranger's face, Yet so by wrath bewilder'd, they had lost Distinction, rose Caswallon. From the wall A lance he seiz'd, huge as a pine-tree stem, That on Blencathara stands sheer 'gainst heaven's storms: Far o'er all heads a long and rapid flight It cut along the air, till almost fail'd The sight to track it to its ponderous fall. Then taking on his throne his quiet seat, “Back, back to Hengist, say my lance flies thus, Bid him o'ercast it, then come here again To menace at Caswallon.”—“Soft and weak, (Pursued the unwondering Stranger) know'st thou not, There is a strength, that is not of the arm, Nor standeth in the muscles' sinewy play? It striketh, but its striking is unseen, It wieldeth, what it wieldeth seeming yet Sway'd by its own free motion. King, I say, Thou stepp'st not, speak'st not, but obedient still To Hengist's empire, thou'rt a dog that hunts But as thy master slips thee on his game, A bridled steed that vaunteth as his own His rider's prowess.”—“Hah! I know thee now, Insolent outcast, Samor!”—“And I thee, Self-outcast, once a Briton—oh thou fall'n When most thou seem'st exalted, oh most base When most ennobled, a most pitiful slave When bearing thee most lordly! Briton once! Ay, every clod of earth that makes a part Of this isle's round, each leaf of every tree, And every wave of every streamlet brook, Should look upon thee with a mother's glance, And speak unto thee with a mother's voice. But thou, most impious and unnatural son, Hast sold thy mother to the shame and curse Of foreign lust, hast knit a league to rend And sever her, most proud if some torn limb Be cast thee for thy lot.” Then rose again Caswallon, from his brow the crown took off, And placing it in Samor's hand—“I read Thy purpose, and there's fire in't, by my throne! Now, Samor, place that crown upon my head, Do me thy homage, kneeling, as thy king, And thou and I will have a glorious tilt At these proud Saxons. Turn not off; may boys Gild their young javelins in Caswallon's blood, And women pluck me by the beard, if e'er On other terms I league with thee.” The crown Samor received, and Samor look'd to heaven, And Samor bow'd his knee,—“Almighty God, If thine eternal thunderbolts are yet Unweary of their function dire, if earth Yet, yet have not exhausted and consum'd Thy flame-wing'd armoury of wrath, reserve Some signal and particular revenge For this man's head: so this foul earth shall learn, Ere doomsday, that the sin, whose monstrous shape Doth most offend thy pure and sensitive sight, Is to bear arms against our native land. Make thou of him a monumental ruin, To publish in the ages long remote, That sometimes is thy red right hand uplift Against the living guilty.” And to earth, Upleaping, Samor dash'd the crown; the gems Lay starry on the pavement white. On high Caswallon the rear'd sword of justice swung, Heavy with death, above the Avenger's head. But he—“Caswallon, hold thine hand, here, here Thy warrant for my safety, by thy son A poniard given, upon his heart to wreak All evil done myself.” With bosom bare Stood Malwyn by the Avenger's side. But he Viewing that downy skin empurpled o'er With youth's light colouring, and his constant mien, Cast down the dagger, and “Fall what fall may, Excellent boy, my hand shall still be white From blood of thine.” Like wild-boar in his rush Baffled, or torrent check'd, Caswallon paus'd— “Now, Christian, where learnt thou the art to wrest My vengeance from me?—Go, go, I may strike, If the fit fire me.—By Andraste, boy, Boy Malwyn, there's thy father in thy blood. Hah, Samor, thou hast 'scaped me now, erewhile I'll make a footstool of thy neck, to mount On Britain's throne: alive or dead, I'll have A knee as supple, and a front as low From thee, as any of my milk-fed slaves: Go, go.” And Malwyn led the Avenger forth Along the dull and sleepy shore of Ouse, Till all Caer Ebranc's sounds flagged on his ear, And all its towers had dwindled from his sight. Ere parting, Malwyn clasp'd his hand, and tears Hung in his eyelids. “Oh, thou know'st not yet How Hengist sways my father's passive mind! My sister, my sweet Lilian, she whose sight Made mine eyes tremble, whom I've stol'n to see, Despite my father's stern command, asleep With parted lips, and snowy breathing skin: Scarce knew she me, her brother; her knew I So only that my spirit yearn'd to mix With hers in fondness, she, even she, the soft, The innocent, a wolf had lov'd her; she Hath felt the drowning waters o'er her close, Fair victim of a hellish sacrifice.” After a troubled silence, spake the Chief: “Malwyn, my Christian pupil, God will give The lov'd on earth another meeting place; Adieu, remember, Vengeance, Vigilance.”— The Spring had made an early effort faint, T' encroach upon the Winter's ancient reign; And she had lur'd forth from the glittering earth The snowdrop and pale cowslip, th' elder tree And hawthorn their green buds shot out, yet fear'd T' entrust the rude air with their dainty folds. A fresh green sparkled where the snow had been, And here and there a bird on the bare spray Warbled a timorous welcome, and the stream Of Eamont, as rejoicing to be free, Went laughing down its sunny silvering course. The only wintry thing on Eamont's shore Is human; powerless are the airs that touch To breathing and to kindling the dead earth, Powerless the dewy trembling of the sun, To melt around the heart of Vortimer The snow that flakes and curdles there—that bank, That little bank of fair and cherish'd turf, Whereupon his head reclines, ah, doth not rest! By its round swelling, likest were a grave, Save that 'twere brief and narrow for all else But fairy, or those slender watery shapes That dance beneath the stream. Yet there the Spring Hath dropp'd her first, her tenderest bloom; the airs Find the first flowery odours on that spot; Cowslip is there and primrose faint and pale, The daisy and the violet's blue eyes, Peeping from out the shaking grass. The step Of Samor wakens the pale slumberer there. He lifts his lean hands up, and parts away The matting hair from o'er his eyes, which look As though the painful sunlight wilder'd them. Save that a shepherd's scrip lay near, had seem'd That man ne'er ventured there; that every sound Was strange and foreign, save the pendant arms Swinging above with heavy knolling din. But Samor's presence made a sudden break In his fantastic frenzy's wonted thoughts; He motion'd first with bony arm, then spake. “Away, away, thou'rt fearful, thou'lt disturb, Away with thy arm'd head and iron heel, She will not venture, while thy aspect fierce Haunts hereabout, she cannot brook a sound, Nor any thing that's rude, and dark, and harsh, Nor any voice, nor any look but mine. She will not rise, if thou art lingering here; Hard and discourteous man, why seek to keep My own, my buried from me? why prevent The smiling intercourse of those that love?”— “Sad man, what mean'st thou?”—“Speak not, but begone. I tell thee, she's beneath, I laid her there, And she'll come up to me, I know she will, Trembling and slender, soft and rosy pale. I know it, all things sound, and all things smile, As when she wont to meet me.”—“Woeful youth, The dead shall never rise but once.”—“And why? The primrose that was dead, I saw it shed Its leaves, and now again 'tis fresh and fair; The swallow, fled on gliding wing away, Like a departing spirit, see it skims The waters; the white dormouse, that went down Into its cave, hath been abroad; the stream, That was so silent, hark! its murmuring voice Is round about us; Lilian too, to meet The voices and the breathing things she lov'd, Amid the sunshine and the springing joy Will rise again.”—“Kind Heaven, I should have known, Though rust-embrown'd yon breast-plate, and yon helm, I should have known, though furrowy, sunk and wan, That face, though bowed and wasted, that tall form. Prince Vortimer! in maiden or in child Fancies so sick and wild had been most sad, But in a martial and renowned chief Might force unwonted pity from a fiend; Oh, much abus'd! much injur'd! well, too well Hath that fell man the deed of evil wrought.”— “Man, man! then there is man, whose blood will flow, Whose flesh will quiver under the keen steel, Samor!” And up he leap'd, as though he flung Like a dead load the dreamy madness off. “Samor! thou tranquil soul! that walk'st abroad With thy calm reason, and thy cloudless face Unchangeable, as a cold midnight star. Thou scarce wilt credit, I have found a joy In hurling stones down on that glassy tide; And with an angry and quick-dashing foot Breaking the senseless smoothness, that methought Smiled wickedly upon me, and rejoic'd At its own guilt and my calamity. But oh, on mortal thing that feels and bleeds, And shrieks, and shudders, with avenging arm To spring! Where is't and who? good Samor, tell.” And Samor told the tale, and thus—“Brave youth, Not only from yon narrow turf come up From Britain's every hill, and glen, and plain, Deep voices that invoke thee, Vortimer, To waken from thy frenzied rest. Thy arm No selfish, close, and singular revenge Must nerve and freshen; in thy country's cause, Not in thy own, that fury must be wreak'd.” His answer was the brandishing his sword, Which he had rent down from th' o'erhanging bough, And the infuriate riot of his eye. “Oh, perilous your hazard,” still went on Samor, “ye foes of freedom, ye take off Heaven's bonds from all our fiercer part of man; Ye legalize forbidden thoughts, the thirst Of blood make seem a duty, give the hue Of honour and self-admiration proud, To passions moody, dark, unreconcil'd: This Pagan vengeance almost sanctify T' a Christian virtue; and our prayers, that mount Unto the throne of God, though harshly toned With imprecations, take their flight uncheck'd.” But Vortimer upon the grassy bank Had fall'n, “Not long, sweet spirit, oh not long, Shall violets be wanting on thy grave.” Yet unaccompanied the Avenger pass'd,— As though the wonted dark and solemn words, “Vengeance and Vigilance,” had fix'd him there, Prince Vortimer remains by Eamont side. Samor! the cities hear thy lonely voice, Thy lonely tread is in the quiet vale, Thy lonely arm, amid his deep trench'd camp, The Saxon hears upon some crashing helm Breaking in thunder and in death. But thee, Why see I thee by Severn side? what soft And indolent attraction wiles thee on, Even on this cold and gusty April day, To the sad desert of thy ancient home? Why mingle for thyself the wormwood cup? Why plunge into the fount of bitterness? Or why, with sad indulgence, pamper up, Wilful, the moody sorrow, and relax Thy high-strung spirit? Oh, so near, no power Hath he to pass from those old scenes away, He must go visit every spot belov'd, And think on joys, no more to be enjoy'd. Ruin is there, but ruin slow and mild, The spider's wandering web is thin and grey On roof and wall, here clings the dusky bat, And, where his infants' voices us'd to sound, The owlet's sullen flutter and dull chirp Come o'er him; on his hospitable hearth The blind worm and slow beetle crawl their round. Yet is no little, light, and trivial thing, Without its tender memory; first with kiss, Long and apparent sweet, the primrose bed He visits, where that graceful girl is laid. Then roves through every chamber; eye, and ear, And soul, all full of her, that is not there: Emeric haunts everywhere, there's not a door Her thin form hath not glided through, no stone Upon the chequer'd marble where her foot Hath never glanc'd, no window whence her eyes Have never gaz'd for him; the walls have heard Her voice; her touch, now deathly cold, hath been Warm on so many things; there hangs, even now, The lute from whence those harmonies she drew, So spherelike sweet, they seem'd to drop from heaven. There, where the fox came starting out but now, There, circled with her infants, did she sit. And here the bridal couch, the couch of love, A little while, and then the bed of death. And lo that holy scroll of parchment, stamp'd With many a sentence of the word of God, Still open, Samor could not choose but read In large and brilliant characters emblaz'd, The Preacher's “Vanity of vanities.” How like is grief to pleasure! here to stay One day, one night, to see the eve sink down Into the water, with its wonted fall, 'Tis strange temptation—and to gather up Sad relics. And the visionary night! How will its airy forms come sliding down, Here, where is old familiar footing all, 'Tis strange temptation.—But the White-horse flag Pass'd waving o'er his sight, at once he thought Of that seal'd day of destiny, when his foot Should trample on its neck, and burst away. Oh secret traveller o'er a ruin'd land, Yet once more must I seek thee 'mid the drear, The desolate, the dead. On Ambri plain, On Murder's blasted place of pride. It seem'd At distance like a favour'd meadow, bright With richer herbage than the moorland brown Around it; the luxurious weeds look'd boon, And glanc'd their many colours, fleck'd with dew. Seen nearer, scatter'd all around appear'd Few relics of that sumptuous feast, the wrecks Of lifeless things, that gaily glitter'd still, While all the living had been dark so long. Fragments of banners, and pavilion shreds, Or broken goblet here and there, or ring, Or collar on that day how proudly worn! A stol'n and hurried burying had there been. Here had the pious workman, as disturb'd At his imperfect toil, left struggling out A hand, whose bleach'd bones seem'd even yet to grasp The earth, so early, so untimely left. And here the grey flix of the wolf, here black Lay feathers of the obscene raven's wing, Shewing, where they had marr'd the fruitless toil. And uncouth stones bore here and there a name, Haply the vaunted heritage of kings. It was a sad and stricken place; though day Was in the heaven, and the fresh grass look'd green, The light was wither'd; nor was silence there A soothing quiet; busy 'twas, and chill And piercing, rather absence of strong sound, Than stillness, like the shivering interval Between the pauses of a passing bell. Oh Britain! what a narrow space confines Thy powerful and thy princely! that grey earth Was what adorn'd and made thee proud; the fair, Whose beauty was the rapture of thy maids, The treasure of thy mothers; and the brave, Whose constant valour was thy wall of strength; The wealthy, whose air-gilding palace towers Made thee a realm of glory to detain The noon-day sun in his career; thy wise, Whose grave and solemn argument controll'd Thy councils; and thy mighty, whose command Was law in thy strong cities. Beauty, wealth, Might, valour, wisdom, mingled and absorb'd In one cold similarity of dust, One layer of white and silent ashes all. The air breathes of mortality; abroad A spirit seems to hover, pouring in Dim thoughts of Doomsday to the soul; steal up Voiceless sensations of eternity From the blank earth. Oh, is it there beneath Th' invisible, everlasting? or dispers'd Among its immaterial kindred free, The elements? Oh man! man! fit compeer Of worms and angels, trodden under foot, Yet boundless by the infinite expanse Of ether! mouldering and immutable! But thou, Avenger, in that quiet glebe, How many things are hid, once link'd to thee By ties more gentle than the coupling silk That pairs two snowy doves! hands used to meet In brotherly embrace with thine, and hearts Wherein thy image dwelt, clear, changeless, full As the spring moon upon a crystal lake: Faces in feast, in council, and in fight, That took their colouring from thine. And thou Alone art breathing, moving, speaking here, Amid the cold, the motionless, the mute! Among that solemn multitude of graves One woman hath her dwelling: round and round She wanders with a foot that seems to fear That it is treading over one belov'd. She seems to seek what she despairs to find. And ever and anon she stops to hear, Then, as in bitter disappointment, shakes Her loose hair, and again goes wandering on. She shriek'd at Samor's presence, and flung up Her arms, and in her shriek was laughter. “Thou! What dost thou with that face above the earth, Thou should'st be with the rest!”—“My friend's soft bride, The dainty Evelene!”—“That's it, the name Wherewith the winds have mock'd me every morn, And every dusky eve—or was it then? Aye then it was, when I was wont to sleep On a soft bed, and when no rough winds blew About me, when I ever saw myself Drest glitt'ringly, and there was something else Then, which there is not now.”—“Thy Elidure! Sad houseless widow!”—“Ha! thou cunning man, 'Twas that, 'twas that! and thou canst tell me too Where they have laid him—well thou canst, I know There's deep connexion 'twixt my grief and thee. Thou, thou art he that wakest sleepers up, And send'st them forth along the cold bare heath, To seek the dark and disappearing. There Sound howlings at the midnight bleak, and blasts Shivering and fierce. And there come peasant boors That bring the mourner bread, and weave the roof Above her, of the brown and rustling fern! But never sounds the voice, or comes the shape She sought for. Oh, my wakings and my sleeps How exquisite they were, upon his breast I slept, and when I woke there smil'd his face.” Even as the female pigeon to her nest, All ruffled by rude winds and discompos'd, Returning, with full breast sits brooding down, And all sinks smooth around her and beneath: So when the image of departed joy Revisited the heart of that sad wife, Its wayward frenzy settled into peace. Sweetly she spake, and unconfusedly heard, Of him the low, the undistinguish'd laid, Of Samor's friend, her bridegroom, Elidure. And something of its soft and tender bloom Faintly enlivened her pale hollow cheek. But when again alone, o'er heart and brain Flash'd back the wandering, recommenc'd the search Ever with broken questionings, and mute Lip-parted listenings, pauses at each grave, As though she almost hoped, where lay her lord, That some inherent consciousness should stir Within her; though 'tis nature's law, that one Cold undistinguish'd silence palls the dead, Yet seem'd it hard and cruel not to grant One low sound, even the likeness of a sound, To tell her where to lay her down and die. Sure there are spirits round her, yet all leagued T' abuse and lead astray, and his, even his, Pitiless as the rest, with jealous care Concealing its felt presence. Ghostly night Wafts her no dusk intelligence; the day Shews nothing with its broad and glaring rays. BOOK X. ARGUMENT. Shore of Cornwall. Uther Pendragon at the siege of Tintagel. Samor. Rescue of Igerna. Arthur. Fleet of Hoel, King of Armorica (Bretagne). Craft of Gorlois. The firing of the Beacons from one end of the Western part of the Island to the other, from Cornwall to Cumberland. But thou from North to South hast rang'd the isle, From Skiddaw to the Cornwall sea-beat rocks, One icy face of desolation cold, One level sheet of sorrow and dismay, Avenger! thou hast travers'd, hast but held Companionship with mourners and with slaves. Upon the northern rocks of Cornwall meet Th' Avenger and the Warrior; thus spake he— “How name ye yon strong castle on the rock?”— “Tintagel, the prince Gorlois' towers.”—“And whose Yon soldiers cresting with their camp the shore, And yon embattled navy on the sea, Rounding their moony circle?”—“Mine.”—“And thou?” “Methinks, most solemn questioner, the helm Might well proclaim Pendragon.”—“No, the front, Whereon that scaly blazon us'd to glow, Had ne'er been girding with unnatural siege A British castle, while all Britain lay In chains beneath the Stranger.”—“What art thou, That beardest in thy high and taunting vein The Princes of the land?”—“A Prince.”—“Thus arm'd And thus attir'd!”—“Misjudging! must thou learn His actions are the raiment of the man: Better to serve my country in worn weeds And dinted arms like mine, than 'gainst her sons To lace a golden panoply. This rust, 'Tis Saxon blood, for thine, its only praise Is its bright stainlessness. Look not, fierce Prince, As from my veins its earliest spots should fall, 'Tis Britain barbs the arrows that I speak, And makes thy heart its mark.”—“What man or more Thus fires and freezes, angers and controls With the majestic valour of his tongue, The never yet controll'd, and bears the name Of Britain, like a shield before him, broad And firm against my ripe and bursting wrath? Samor! come, honour'd warrior, to my arms; Oh shame to see, and seeing not to know The noblest of our isle.”—“No arms may fold Samor within them, but a Briton's; thou By this apostate war disown'st the name, And leaguest dark alliance with her foes.” “Ah, then thou know'st not, in yon rock is mew'd The crafty kite that hath my dove in thrall, My dove, my bride, my sweet Igerna; This seizure of the fair Igerna, the wife of Uther Pendragon, by Gorlois, is related in the romantic histories, or the historical romances, of the period; but I must acknowledge that the general tradition is not quite so much in favour of Uther's original right to the hand of Igerna. She is more often represented as the wife of Gorlois, from whom her heart and at length her person were won by the superior person and valour of Pendragon. her That Gorlois with his privy talon swoop'd, The gentle, the defenceless; and looks down From his air-swinging eyrie on my wrath, That like the sea against that rooted rock Lashes and roars in vain.”—“Thy bride!”—“My bride, By holy vows in saintly chapel pledged; And all before, the twilight meetings stolen Upon the shelly beach, when came my bark Sliding with smooth oar through the soundless spray From the Armoric shore; and words so fond The unfelt waters crept up round our feet: All after, rapturous union undisturb'd, Her father's blessing on our bridal couch, Promise of infant pledges, all destroy'd, All wither'd by that Gorlois, that low worm I had disdain'd to tread on heretofore. He with some cold and antiquated plea Of broken compact by her sire, away Reft with a villain stealth th' ill-guarded gem, And hoards it in his lone and trackless cave.” “A darker crime, more lawless robbery, Hath made this land of free-born Christian men The plunder of fierce Heathens. Uther, hear! Hear, son of Constantine! most dear the ties Of wedlock, earthly woven, yet seal'd by God. But those, that link us to our native land, Are wrought out from the eternal adamant By the Almighty. Oh, thy country's call, Loud with a thousand voices, drowns the tone Of sweet complaining, even from wife belov'd— Forego the weaker, Uther, and obey The stronger duty.”—“Bloodless man and cold! Or wrong I thee? perchance the Saxon holds Thy Emeric, and my claims must cede to thine, Even as all beauties to that peerless star.” “Spare, Uther, spare thy taunting, she is safe, Briton or Saxon harm not her.”—“'Tis well, Fair tidings!—but thy shuddering brow looks white.”— “There's a cold safety, Uther, with the dead! There is where foes disturb no more, the grave!”— “Pardon me, friend—oh pardon—but my wife, She too will seek that undisturbed place, Ere yield to that pale craven's love; if false She dare not live, and yet, oh yet she lives.” Uprose the Avenger, and his way he took To where the rock broke off abrupt and sheer. Before him yawn'd the chasm, whose depth of gloom Sever'd the island Castle from the shore. The ocean waves, as though but newly rent That narrow channel, tumbled to and fro, Rush'd and recoil'd, and sullenly sent up An everlasting roar, deep echoed out From th' underworking caverns; the white gulls Were wandering in the dusk abyss; and shone Faint sunlight here and there on the moist slate. The Castle drawbridge hung aloof; arm'd men Pac'd the stern ramparts; javelins look'd out From embrasure and loop-hole; arbalist And bowstring loaded lay with weight of shaft Menacing. On the dizzy brink stood up Th' Avenger, like a Seraph when absolv'd His earthly mission, on some sunny peak He waits the gathering cloud, whereon he wont To charioteer along the azure space; In vain he waits not, under his plum'd feet, And round about his spreading wings it floats, And sails off proudly with its heavenly freight. Even thus at Samor's call down heavy fell The drawbridge, o'er the abyss th' Avenger springs: Tintagel's huge portcullis, groaning up Its grooves, gives way; then up the jealous bridge Behind him springs, the gate falls clashing down. Half wonder, and half fear, Pendragon shook The terrors of his crest, and gasping stood, As when a hunter is gone in to brave The bear within his shaggy den, down peers His fellow through the dusk, and fears to see What his keen eyes strain after. But elate Appear'd upon the rampart that tall Chief, Seeming on th' outpour'd garrison to cast Words potent as the fabled Wizard's oils, With the terrific smoothness of their fire Wide sheeting the hush'd ocean; th' arbalist Discharg'd its unaim'd bolt; the arrow fell From the slack bowstring: careless of his charge, The watchman from his turret lean'd; o'er all Bright'ning and stilling the high language spread, Giving a cast of pride to vulgar brows, Shedding o'er stupor and thick-breathing awe A solemn hue of glory. Far it spread Beyond the sphere of sound, th' indignant brow, The stately waving of the arm discours'd, Flow'd argument from every comely limb, And the whole man was eloquence. From cliff, From bark gaz'd Uther's soldiery, one voice Held in suspense the wild and busy war, And on the motion of his lips, the fate Of two strong armies hung. Anon the gate Flew up, the bridge lay shuddering o'er the chasm. Forth Samor comes, a Lady by his side, And Gorlois in the garb of peace behind. Tremblingly she came gliding on, and light, As the west wind o'er beds of flowers; a child Was with her: the cool freshness of the air Seem'd o'er her marble cheek a flush unus'd To breathe, and human faces o'er her threw A modest, faint disturbance. Uther rush'd To meet her, ere he came her failing frame Seem'd as it sought some breast to sink upon, Though feebly resolute, that none but his Should be the chosen resting place. But he Severe withheld her. “Can the snowdrop bloom Untainted on the hemlock bank; near thee, Igerna, long hath trail'd a venomous plant, Hast thou the sullying influence scap'd?” She strove To work displeasure to her brow, the joy, The fondness would not give it place: she held Her boy on high; she pointed from the lines Of his soft face to Uther's, with appeal Half rapture, half reproach; and cast herself With timid boldness on her rightful couch, Her husband's bosom, that receiv'd her in, Even as the opening clouds an angel home Returning. But the joyous boy relax'd His features to a beautiful delight; To the fierce Dragon on his father's helm Lifting his sportive hand, and smoothing down The horrent scales, and looking with glad eye Into the fiery hollow of his jaws. Mute lay the armies, the pale Gorlois wrought His features to a politic joy. Alone Stood Samor and aloof, he stood in tears. Samor, amid the plain of buried men Tearless, and in his own deserted home, In tears unveil'd before th' assembled camp. It was so like a meeting after death, That union of the husband and the wife, So ghostly, so unearthly. Thus shall meet The disembodied, Emeric and himself, Not with rude rocks their footing, the cold airs And cloudy sunshine of this world around; But all of life must intervene, and all The long dark grave mysterious: yet even here It was a sweet impossibility, Wherewith at times his soul fond dalliance held, An earthly, bodily, sensible caress, Even long and rapturous, as that hanging now On Uther's neck from soft Igerna's arms. Upon the silence burst a voice that cried “Arthur,” whereat the child his sport broke off With that embossed serpent, and stretch'd out His arms, where, on the fragment of a rock, Stood Merlin. “Arthur, hail! hail, fatal Boy, Bright arrow from the bow of Destiny, Go forth upon thy fiery course! the steeds Are in the meadows, that shall bear thee forth, Thee and thy barded chivalry! the spears Are forg'd, wherewith in tourney and in fight Ye shall o'erbear the vaunting Saxon! shields Are stamping with your bright devices bold! And Bards are leaning on their high-strung harps, Awaiting thee, to flower out in their boon And ripe fertility of song. Go forth, Strong reaper in the harvest of renown, Arthur! the everlasting Lord of Fate Hath summon'd thee to thy immortal race!” The infant clapp'd his hands, Pendragon flung Aloft his scaly bickering crest, her child Igerna folded to her heart, and wept. And forward leap'd the Avenger to salute Snowdon's dark Prophet! Merlin was not there.— Good fortune on good fortune follows fast; Tidings come rapid of a Breton fleet Seen on the southern shore; the chiefs are pass'd To where th' Archangel's Mount o'erlooks the sea. Oh go not to thy couch, thou bright-hair'd Sun! Though Ocean spread its welcoming breast, yet pause 'Mid that ethereal architecture, wrought Around thee by thine own creative light. How broad the over-vaulting palace arch Spreads up the heavens, with amethyst ceil'd, and hung With an enwoven tapestry of flame, Wav'd over by long banner, and emblaz'd, Like hall of old barbaric Potentate, With scutcheon and with shield, that now unfold, Now in their cloudy texture shift; and paved With watery mosaic rich, the waves Quick glancing, like a floating surface, laid With porphyry and crystal interwrought. There's yet a sight, oh Sun! to check awhile Thy setting; lo, the failing breezes lift The white wings of that fair Armoric fleet To catch the level lines of light; the oars Flash up the spray, that purples as it falls: While wearing one by one, their armed freight They cast out on the surfy beach. The Kings, King Emrys, and Armoric Hoel, meet Pendragon, Samor, and their band of chiefs. There meet they on the land's extremest verge To conquer, to deliver, few, but strong, Strong in the hardihood of soul. As rose The giant wrestler from his mother's breast, Earth-born Anteus, his huge limbs refresh'd For the Herculean combat; so shall ye, Kings, Chiefs, and Warriors, from your native soil Draw to the immortal faculties of mind A springtide everlasting and unchang'd. The armour of a holy cause outshines The iron or the knosped brass, and hopes And memories, to the home-returning brave Crowding from every speck of sacred earth, Outplead the trumpet's wakening blast, till leaps Vengeance to Glory's vanguard post, and leads The onset, and looks proudly down to see The red blood deepening round her laving feet. Alas, that in your harvest of high thoughts, Thick set with golden promise of renown, The poppy seeds of envy and distrust Should take their baleful root. Slow winds along Gorlois, the sower of that noxious crop, Scattering it in with careless toil; now stands By royal Emrys' side, now mines beneath Pendragon's towery soul, now sadly warns, With cautious words and dark speech broken off, Hoel, the crown'd Armorican; his looks Belying his feign'd confidence of speech, But half surmising fear, and killing hope By his cold care of keeping it alive. “Not that I love not, whom all love; admire On whom the admiration of all hearts Falls with such free profusion; 'tis no shame For us mean lamps before great Samor's light To wane and glimmer in our faint eclipse. Yet whence this fettering of all eyes and hearts? This stern unsocial solitude of fame? True, from that fatal banquet 'scap'd he, true, Undaunted hath he rov'd the isle, nor doubt For some high purpose, that 'twere rash for us To search with our obscure and misty sight. Nor think, King Emrys, I thy crown assert Unstably set upon thy royal brow; But there's a dazzling in its jewel'd round Might tempt a less self-mastering grasp. Who holds The souls of men in thraldom with his tongue, Makes bridges grow before him, stony walls Break up to give him way,—I speak not now In vengeance of Tintagel, 'twas a deed Most worth my richest praise, that made me friend To brave Pendragon. But ambition wreck'd The angels, and the aspiring soul of man Hath sinn'd for meaner gain than Britain's throne.” So one by one he wound his serpent coil Around the Chieftains' souls; and inly breath'd The creeping venom. But Pendragon's heart, Too fiery or too noble to suspect, In Samor's teeth flung fierce th' oppressive doubt. Th' Avenger's tranquil smile was like the change Of aspect in a green and lofty tree, Touch'd by the wings of some faint breeze; nor shakes The massy foliage, nor is quite at rest, While languidly the undisturbing air Falls away and expires. “Will Emrys hold At midnight on St. Michael's Mount his pomp Of Coronation? Samor will be there.”— “At midnight!”—“Aye, the fires will gaily blaze, The silent air is meet for solemn oaths.” The night is starless, soft and still, the heavens O'erwoven with a thin and rayless mist. A long low heavy sound of breaking surge Roams down the shore, and now and then the woods Flutter and bend with one short rush of wind. The tide hath risen o'er the stony belt, That to the mainland links the Mount: where meet Even now the Chieftains, ocean all around, On every side the white and moaning waves. On the bare summit, 'neath the cope of heaven, The conclave stands, bare, save a lofty pile Of wood, compacted like funereal pyre Of a departed hero, in old time On some Ægean promontory rear'd, Or by the Black Inhospitable Sea. The Axenos, afterwards called the Euxeinos Sea. The crown is on king Emrys' head, his hair Is redolent with the anointing oil. “Hail, King of Britain!”—Samor cried, and “Hail!” Replied that band of heroes; Hail! the shores Echoed, from bark and tent came pealing up The universal Hail, the ocean waves Broke in with their hoarse murmur of applause. “Air, earth, and waters, ye have play'd your part, There's yet another element,”—cried aloud Samor, and in the pyre he cast a brand. A moment, and uprush'd the giant fire, Piercing the dim heavens with its blazing brow, And on the still air shaking its red locks. There by its side the Vassals and their King, Motionless with their shadows huge and dun, Show'd like destroying Angels, round enwrapp'd In their careering pomp of flame; far flash'd The yellow midnight day o'er shore and sea: The waves now ruddy heav'd, now darkly plung'd; Upon the rocks, within the wavering light Strong-featur'd faces fierce, and hard-lin'd forms Broke out and disappear'd; the anchor'd fleet Were laving their brown sides in rainbow spray. No sound was heard, but the devouring flame, And the thick plashing waters. “Keep your faith, (Cried Samor) ye eternal hills, and ye Heaven-neighbouring mountains!” Eastward far anon Another fire rose furious up; behind Another and another: all the hills Each beyond each held up its crest of flame. Along the heavens the bright and crimson hue Widening and deepening travels on: the range O'erleaps black Tamar, by whose ebon tide Cornwall is bounded; and on Heytor rock, Above the stony moorish source of Dart, It waves a sanguine standard; Haldon burns, And the red City Caer ruth, Exeter. glows a deeper hue. And all the southern rocks, the moorland downs In those portentous characters of flame Discourse, and bear the glaring legend on: Even to the graves on Ambri plain, where woke That pallid woman, and rejoic'd, and deem'd 'Twas sent to guide her to the tomb she sought. Fast flash they up, those altars of revenge, As though the snake-hair'd Sister torch-bearers, Th' Eumenides, from the Tartarean depths Were leaping on from hill to hill, on each Leaving the tracks of their flame-dropping feet. Or as the souls of the dead fathers, wrapt In bright meteorous grave-clothes, had arisen, And each sate crowning his accustom'd hill, Radiant and mute: or the devoted isle Had wrought down by her bold and frequent guilt Th' Almighty's lightning shafts, now numberless Forth raining from the lurid reeking clouds, And smiting all the heights. On spreads the train, Northward it breaks upon the Quantock ridge; It reddens on the Mendip forests dark; It looks into the cavern'd Cheddar cliffs: The boatman on the Severn mouth awakes And sees the waters rippling round his keel In spots and streaks of purple light, each shore Ablaze with all its answering hills: the streams Run glittering down Plinlimmon's side, though thick And moonless the wan night: and Idris stands Like Stromboli or Ætna, where 'twas feign'd E'er at their flashing furnace wrought the Sons Of Vulcan, forging with eternal toil Jove's never idle thunderbolts. And thou, Snowdon, the king of mountains, art not dark Amid thy vassal brethren gleaming bright. Is it to welcome thy returning Seer, That thus above thy clouds, above thy snows, Thou wear'st that wreathed diadem of fire, As to outshine the pale and winking stars? O'er Menai's waters blue the gleaming spreads, The Bard in Mona's secret grove beholds A glitter on his harp-strings, and looks out Upon the kindling cliffs of Penmanmawr. Is it a pile of martyrdom above Clwyd's green vale? beside the embers bright Stands holy Germain, as a Saint new come From the pure mansions of beatitude, The centre of a glory, that spreads round Its film of thin pellucid gold. Nor there Pauses the restless Messenger, still on Vaults it from rock to rock, from peak to peak. Far seen it shimmer'd on Caer Ebranc wall, And Malwyn blew a bugle blast for joy. The sun uprising sees the dusk night fled Already from tall Pendle, and the height Of Ingleborough; sees Helvellyn cast A meteor splendour on the mountain lakes, Like mirrors of the liquid molten brass. The brightest and the broadest and the last, There flakes the beacon glare; and in the midst Dashing the ruddy sparkles to and fro With the black remnant of a pine-tree stem, Stands, arm'd from head to foot, Prince Vortimer.

Mighty in thy endurance, in revenge Mightier! thou shak'st thy slavish patience off, Oh Britain! as a snake its wither'd skin, That boastful in the sun uncoils and spreads In bright and cruel beauty. Not in vain Have those wild beacons rear'd their fires, thou wak'st, The slumber falls from thee, as dewdrops shed From the morn-kindling falcon's wing. On hill, In vale, in forest and in moor, in field And city, like the free and common air, Like the wide-spreading golden hue of dawn, Ranges the boundless passion uncontroll'd. The “Vigilance” hath dropp'd, absolv'd, away From the fierce war-cry, one portending word, “Vengeance,” rides lonely upon all the winds. Alas, delicious Spring! God sends thee down To breathe upon his cold and perish'd works Beauteous revival; earth should welcome thee, Thee and the West wind, thy smooth paramour, With the soft smiling of her flowery meads, Her joys, her melodies. The bounding stag Flutters the shivering fern; the steed shakes out His mane, the dewy herbage silver-webb'd With proud step trampling; the wild goat looks down From his empurpling bed of heath, where break The waters deep and blue with crystal gleams Of their quick leaping people: the fresh lark Is in the morning sky; the nightingale Tunes evesong to the dropping waterfall. Creation lives all loveliness, and melts To one mild harmony of conscious joy. Man only, savage and discordant Man, Strews for thy tender feet the battle field, Makes all thy gentle-breathing airs to jar With his hoarse trumpetings, scares thy sweet light With gleams of violent and angry brass. Away! it is a yearly common joy, A rapture that ne'er fails the solemn Sun In his eternal round, the blossoming And fragrance of the green dissolving earth. But a fresh springtide in the human soul, A nation from its wintry trance set loose, The bursting ice of servitude, the bloom Of freedom in the withered mind obscure, These are earth's brightest glories, these transcend All nature's fairest and most splendid shows. Therefore the young Sun with rejoicing light Shall beam on ensigns; the blithe airs shall waft Jocund the lofty pealing battle words; And, not unwelcome, fierce crests intercept The spring-dews from the thirsty soil; and earth For vestment shall put on war's brazen garb, More proudly than her brightest robe of green. Throughout the isle was base subjection tame: Throughout the isle, hath Freedom rear'd her, plum'd With terror, sandal'd with relentlessness: Her march like brazen chariots, or the tramp Of horsemen in a rocky glen; and clouds Of javelins in her front, and in her rear Dead men in grizzly heaps, dead Saxons strewn Upon their trampled White Horse banners. Them Her fury hath no time to scorn, no pause To look back on her deathful deeds achiev'd, While aught remains before her to achieve. Distract amid the wide spread feast of blood The wandering raven knows not where to feed, And the gorg'd vulture droops her wing and sleeps. War hath the garb of holiness! bear proof, But their approch being known, (that of the Saxons and Picts) Bishop Germaine took upon him the leading of the British host, and over against the passage, thorough the which the enemies were appointed, he chose forth a fair vallie, enclosed with high mounteins; and within the same he placed his new washed (“baptised”) armie. And when he saw the enemies now at hand, he commanded that everie man, with one generall voice, should answer him, crieing aloud the same crie that he should begin. So that even as the enemies were readie to give the charge upon the Britains, supposing that they should have taken them at unawares, and before anie warning had been given, suddenly the Bishop Germaine with the priests, with a loud and shrill voice, called Alleluia, thrice; and therewith all the multitudes of the Britains, with one voice, cried the same crie, with such a lowd shout, that the Saxons were therewith so amazed and astonied (the echo from the rocks and hills adjoining redoubling in such wise the crie) that they thought not onelie the rocks and cliffs had fallen upon them, but that even the skie itself had broken in pieces, and come tumbling doune upon their heads. Herewith, therefore, throwing awaie their weapons, they tooke them to their feet, and glad was he that might get to be foremost in running awaie. Many of them for haste were drowned in a river which they had to passe. —Holinshed B.v.c.6. Thou vale of Clwyd, to our cold late days, By the embalming of tradition named, Maes Garmon, of her saintly Bishop. He His grey thin locks unshaken, calm his port As if he trod a chapel's rush-strewn floor, Comes foremost of his Christian mountaineers Against th' embattled Pagans' fierce array. By the green margin of the stream, the band Of Arngrim glitter in the morning light. Their shadowy lances line the marble stream With long and level rules of trembling shade; The sunshine falling in between in streaks Of brightness. They th' unwonted shew of war Behold, slow winding down the wooded hill. “Now, by our Gods,” cried Arngrim, “not content To scare our midnight with their insolent fires, They break upon our calm and peaceful day.” But silent as the travel of the clouds At breathless twilight, or a flock that winds, Dappling the brown cliff with its snowy specks, Foldward along the evening dews, a bell Now and then tinkling, faintly shrill, come on Outspreading on the meadow the stern band Of Britons with their mitred Captain; front Oppos'd to front they stand, and spear to spear. Then Germain clasp'd his hands and look'd to heaven; Then Germain in a deep and solemn tone Cried “Alleluia!” answer was flung back: From cliff and cavern “Alleluia” burst; It seem'd strong voices broke the bosom'd earth, Dropt voices from the clouds, and in the rush Of waters was a human clamour; far The scattering and discomfiting appeal Swept o'er all nature in its boundless range. Ceaseless and countless, lifeless, living things Multiplied “Alleluia;” all the air Was that one word, all sounds became that sound, As the broad lightning swallows up all lights, All quench'd in one blue universal glare. On rush'd the Britons, but 'gainst flying foes! Quick smote the Britons, but no breast-plate clove Before them! then the ignominious death First through the back found way to Saxon hearts. Oh, Suevian forests! Clwyd's vale beholds What ye have never witnessed, Arngrim's flight— Fleet huntsman, thou art now the deer! the herd, Whereof thou wert the prime and loftiest horn'd, Are falling fast around thee, th' unleash'd dogs Of havock on their reeking flanks: and thee, The herdsman of the meek and peaceful goats, Thee, the soft tuner of the reedy flute Beside Nantfrangon's stony cataract, Mordrin pursues. So strong that battle word, Its holy transmutation and austere Works in the soul of man; the spirit sheathes In the thrice folding brass of valour; swells The stagnant blood into a current fierce And torrent like, and in the breast, erewhile But open to the tremulous melting airs Of passions gentle and affections bland, Plants armed hope, and eagle-wing'd desires. Therefore that youth his downy hand hath wreath'd In the strong Suevian's knotted locks, drawn up Like a wrought helm of ebon; therefore fix His eyes, more us'd to swim in languid light, With an implacable and constant stare Down on the face of Arngrim, backward drawn, As he its writhing agony enjoy'd: And therefore he, whose wont it was to bear The many sparkling crystal, or the cup Of dripping water-lily from the spring To the blithe maiden of his love, now shakes A gory and dissever'd head aloft, And bounds in wild ovation down the vale. But in that dire and beacon haunted night King Vortigern his wonted seat had ta'en Upon Caermerddhyn's topmost palace tower. There, the best privilege of greatness fall'n, He saw not, nor was seen: there, wrapt in gloom, 'Twas his soul's treasur'd luxury and sole joy From nature many a mournful parallel To draw, fantastic, of his abject state. Sad desperate consolation!—All around Lay cloudy, dim, and indistinct; the last Faint glimmering like to light, was what remain'd Of day, just not so utterly extinct And quench'd, as yet to shew splendour had been, And was not; the dusk semblance of himself Delighted, royal once, now with a mock And mimic of his lustre haunted. Why, Why should not human glory wane, since clouds Put out the immortal planets in the sky? Why should not crowns have seasons, since the moon Hath but her hour to queen it in the heavens? Why should not high and climbing souls be lost In the benighting shroud of the world's gloom? Lo, one inglorious, undistinguish'd night Gathers the ancient mountains in its train, While still the densest and most turbulent clouds Thicken upon the stateliest; but beneath The lowly and contented waters lie Asleep upon their weedy banks, yet they Have all the faint blue brightness that remains. Then moodier the capricious humour grown, Stoop'd upon mean and trivial things, them too Wrought to his wayward misanthropic scope. Amid the swaying and disturbed air The rooks hung murmuring on the oak-tree tops, As plaining their uneasy loftiness. While, solitary as himself, the owl Sate calling on its deaf and wandering mate. Him at that sound seiz'd merriment, that made The lip drop, the brow writhe, “Howl on,” he cried, “Howl for thy dusky paramour,”—and turn'd To where Rowena's chamber casements stood, Void, silent, dark of their once-brilliant lights. Sudden around blaz'd up the mountain tops Each with its intertwisted sheaf of flame, South, North, and East and West, fire everywhere, Everywhere flashing and tumultuous light. Then gaz'd the unking'd, then cried out the fallen, “Now, by my soul, when comets gaze on kings Even from the far and vaulting heavens, 'tis faith There's hollowness beneath their tottering thrones; But when they flash upon our earth, and glare Close in our faces, 'tis ripe time and full For palaces to quake, and royal tombs To ope their wide and all-receiving jaws. What is 't to me? ye menace at the Great! Ye stoop not to be dangerous and dread, Oh haughty and mysterious lights! to thrones Low and despis'd like mine; in earlier days Vortigern would have quail'd, he mocks you now. Ye are not of the heavens, I know, I see, Discomfiters of darkness, Conquerors Of midnight, ye are of the earth. Why stands Caermerddhyn and the realm of Dyfed black Amid this restless multitude of flame? 'Tis not for idle or for fruitless show That with such splendid violation Man Infringeth on stern nature's laws, and rends From night her consecrate and ancient pall; Samor, thy hand is there! and Vortigern Hath not yet learnt the patience cold and tame To be outblaz'd and stifled thus.” Down pass'd The Monarch from his seat; brief time elaps'd, And lo, within that Palace all look'd red, And hurried with a deep confusing glare: And over it a vaulting dome of smoke Surging arose and vast, till roaring out Columns of mounting fire sprung up, and all, Whelm'd in one broad envelopement of flame, Stood. As when in heroic Pagan song Apollo to his Clarian temple came; At once the present Godhead kindled all, Th' elaborate architecture, glory-wreath'd The pillars rose, the sculptur'd architrave Swam in the liquid gold, the Worshipper Within the vestibule of marble pure Held up his hand before his blinded eyes, And so ador'd: but the unconsuming fire Innoxious rang'd th' unparching edifice. But ne'er was Palace or was Monarch seen More in that city, one a shapeless heap Lay in its ashes white; how went the King And whither, no one knew, but He who knows All things. 'Twas frequent in the vulgar tale, (None saw it, yet all knew them well that saw, Henry Huntingdon, Hist.) At midnight manifest a huge arm came Forth from the welkin; once it wav'd and twice, And then it was not: but a bolt thrice fork'd, Each fork a spike of flame, burst on the roof, And all became a fire, and all fell down And smoulder'd, even as now the shapeless walls Lie in scorch'd heaps and black. At that same hour A dark steed, and a darker rider pass'd, With speed bemocking mortal steed, or man, Down the steep hill precipitous. 'Twas like In shape and hue black Favorin, on whose back King Vortigern was wont to ride abroad; Like, surely not the same, for fire came out From under his quick hoofs, and in his breath; And sulphurous the blasted foot-tracks smelt, Some dinted deep in the hard rock, some seared On meadow grass, where never since have dews Lain glittering, never the fresh verdure sprung. Now is the whole Isle war. But I must crave Pardon from those in meaner conflict slain, Or conquerors; Poesy's fair treasure-house Contains not all the splendid names that gem The course of humankind; in heaven alone Th' imperishable brass preserves enroll'd In letters deep of amaranthine light All martyrs to their country, and their God. Oh that my spirit, holding the broad glass Of its invention, might at once condense All rays of glory from the kindling Isle Full emanating. As of old 'tis famed The philosophic Syracusan caught The wide diverging sunbeams, by the force Of mind creating to himself a right And property in nature's common gifts, And domineering the free elements. He that heaven-seiz'd artillery pour'd forth To sear the high beaks of the 'sieging fleet, That burnt, unknowing whence, 'mid the wet waves. So I the fine immortal light would pour Abroad, in the long after-time to beam A consecrate and vestal fire, and guide Secure o'er danger's precipices wild, And the smooth slopes of luxury and false bliss, All lovers of their country. They my song Embosoming within their heart of heart, Like mine own Samor, should bear on, too strong To perish, and too haughty to despair. They happier, he uprearing on the sand A Pharos, steady for a while to stem The fierce assaulting waves, in after times To fall; they building for eternity Britain's rock-founded temple of renown. In the Isle's centre is a champain broad, Now broken into cornfield and smooth mead, Near which a hill, now with the ruin'd towers Of Coningsborough (from that fight of Kings Nam'd in old Saxon phrase,) soars crested; Dune Skirts with her azure belt the level plain. Morn dawn'd with all her attributes, the slow Impearling of the heavens, the sparkling white On the webb'd grass, the fragrant mistiness, The fresh airs with the twinkling leaves at sport, And all the gradual and emerging light, The crystalline distinctness settling clear, And all the wakening and the strengthening sound. There dawn'd she on a battle-field The chronicles give a succession of battles, which I have condensed into one.—“Thus an armie being assembled, Aurelius Ambrosius went against them, and valiantlie assailed them; so that within the space of a few daies they fought three battels with great fiercenesse on both sides, in triall of their high displeasures and uttermost forces, in which at length the Britains put the Saxons to flight, Horsus, the brother of Hengist, being slaine, with a great number of his people. But yet notwithstanding the enemie's rage was little abated hereby, for within a few daies after receiving out of Germanie a new supplie of men, they brake forth upon the Britains with great confidence of victorie. Aurelius Ambrosius was no sooner advertised thereof, but that without delaie he set forward towards Yorke, from whence the enemies should come, and hearing by the way that Hengist was encamped about seven-and-twentie miles distant from that citie, neare to the bank of the river at this day called Dune, in the place where Doncaster now standeth, he returned out of his waie, and marched towards that place, and the next day set on the enemies and vanquished them.” The chronicle adds, that Hengist was slain in the battle, differing from the tradition preserved by Harrison, and hereafter quoted. superb. The beauty that is war's embellishment, The splendour, under whose quick-glancing pall Man proudly moves to slay and to be slain, How wonderful! In semicircle huge, Round that hill foot, the Saxon camps his strength; A many-colour'd dazzling cirque, more rich Than the autumnal woods, when the quick winds Shake on them broken sunlight, than the skies When thunder-clouds are bursting into light, And rainbow-skirted hangs each fold, or fring'd With liquid gold: so wav'd that crescent broad With moving fire, bloom'd all the field with brass: Making even fear voluptuous, and the sense Of danger in deep admiration lost— Oh beauteous if that morning had no eve! The Eastern wing, his tall steeds to his car Harness'd, whose scythes shone newly burnish'd, led Caswallon; he his painted soldiery, Their naked breasts blue-gleaming with uncouth And savage portraitures of hideous things, Human and monstrous terribly combin'd, Array'd; himself no armour of defence Cumber'd, as he were one Death dare not slay, A being from man's vulgar lot exempt, Commission'd to destroy, yet dangerless Amid destruction, against whom war shower'd All its stor'd terrors, but still baffled, back Recoil'd from his unwounded front serene. The centre were the blue-eyed Germans, loose Their fierce hair, various each strong nation's arms; A wild and terrible diversity In the fell skill of slaughter, in the art Of doing sacrifice to death. Some helm'd, Whose visors like distended jaws appear'd Of sylvan monster; some in brinded furs Wrapt shaggy, on whose shoulders seem'd to cling Yet living the fix'd claws; with cross bows some, Some with long lances, some with falchions curv'd. The Arian, wont to make the sable night A pander to his terrors, Cæterum Arii super vires, quibus enumeratos paullo ante populos antecedunt, truces, insitæ feritati arte ac tempore lenocinantur; nigra scuta, tincta corpora: atras ad prœlia noctes legunt: ipsâque formidine atque umbrâ feralis exercitûs terrorem inferunt, nullo hostium sustinente novum ac velut infernum aspectum: nam primi in omnibus prœliis oculi vincuntur. —Tac. Ger. c. 43. in swarth arms He bursting from the forest, when the shades Were deepest, like embodied gloom advanc'd, Shap'd for some dreadful purpose, now he mov'd Unnatural 'mid the clear and golden day. Here Hengist, Horsa there amid the troop Wound their war-horses; he his weapon fell Shook, a round ball of iron spikes chain'd loose To a huge pike-stave, like a baleful star, Aye gleaming devastation in its sweep. Hengist begirt with that fam'd falchion call'd The “Widower of Women;” over all The fatal White Horse in the banner shone. Round to the left, Argantyr with the Jutes And Anglians; these for Offa's slaughter wild T' exact the usurious payment of revenge; He sternly mindful of that broken fight By Wye's clear stream, his sword defrauded then Of its hope-promis'd banquet, Samor's blood. Above the armed multitude the heights Were crowded with the wives and mothers, —et in proximo pignora: unde feminarum ululatus audiri, unde vagitus infantium; hi cuique sanctissimi testes, hi maximi laudatores. Ad matres, ad conjuges vulnera ferunt: nec illæ numerare, aut exigere plagas pavent. Cibosque et hortamina pugnantibus gestant. —Tac. Ger. they With their known presence working shame of flight, And the high fear of being thought to fear. With them the spoils of Britain, vessels carv'd, Statues, and vestments of the Tyrian dye, Standards with antique legend scroll'd, of deeds Done in old times, and gorgeous arms, and cups, And lamps, and plate, or by fantastic art Minister'd to fond luxury's wayward choice, Or consecrate to th' altar use of God. And there the Saxon Gods, the wood and stone To which that people knelt, and deified Their own hands' work; the Father of the race Woden, all arm'd and crown'd; the tempest Lord, The thunder-shaking Thor, This great reputed god, being of more estimate than many of the rest of like sort, though of as little worth as any of the meanest of that rabble, was majestically placed in a very large and spacious hall, and there set, as if he had reposed himself upon a covered bed. On his head he wore a crowne of gold, and round in compasse above, and about the same, were set, or fixed, twelve bright burnished golden starres. And in his right hand he held a kingly scepter.—Verstegan, Restitution of Decayed Intelligence, page 74. This old author gives engravings of these Deities. The Saxons had besides these the Idoll, Ermensewl, in great reputation, his name of Ermensewl, or Ermesewl, being as much as to say, as the Pillar or Stay of the Poore. This God (or more truely Divell) was made armed, standing among flowers. In his right hand he held a staffe, having at it a banner, wherein was painted a read Rose. In his other hand he held a paire of ballance, and upon his head was placed a Cocke. On his breast was carved a Beare, and before his middle was fixed a scutcheon, in chief whereof was also a pair of ballance, in face a Lion, and in point a Rose; and this Idoll the Franks and the other Germans, as well as the Saxons, did serve and adore. —Page 79. twelve radiant stars His coronet, and sceptred his right hand; Upon his stately couch reclining: fierce In his mysterious multitude of signs, Arminsul: and th' Unnameable, They adored also the Idoll Flint, who had that name for his being set upon a great flint stone. This Idoll was made like the Image of Death, save only a sheet about him. In his right hand he held a torch, or, as they termed it, a fire-blase. On his head a Lion rested his two fore-feet, standing with the one of his hinder feet upon his left shoulder, and with the other in his hand, which, to support, he lifted up as high as his shoulder. —Page 80. he fix'd On his flint pedestal, his skeleton shape Garmented scantly in a winding sheet, And in his hand a torchblaze, lighting up Earth's utmost bounds. In act to spring, one paw Upon his head, upon his shoulder one, His faithful Lion ramp'd in sculptur'd ire. Southward, its crescent with out-stretching horns Circling the foe, lay stretch'd the British camp; King Emrys led the centre, on the right Pendragon, on the left th' Armoric King, With all his tall steeds and brave riders; they The fathers of that fam'd chivalric race Of knights and ladies, glorious in old song, White-handed Iseult, Launcelot of the Lake, Chaste Perceval, that won the Sangreal quest. But every where and in all parts alike The Avenger held his post; all heard his voice, All felt his presence, all obey'd his sway. As western hurricane whirls up from earth, And bears where'er it will, the loose-sheaf'd corn, The fluttering leaves, the shatter'd forest boughs, Even so his spirit seiz'd and bore along, And swept with it those proud brigades. With him Rode forth young Malwyn, he his helmet wore Light shadow'd by an eagle plume, so sued His sire; lest in the wildering battle met Their cars should clash in impious strife; nor sought The father more obedience from the son, For Britain and with Samor fix'd to war. And in his brown and weather-beaten arms Came Vortimer, a pine-tree stem his mace, That clove the air with desultory sweep. But by the river brows'd a single steed, Sable as one of that poetic pair, On the fair plain of Enna, in the yoke Of Pluto, when Proserpina let fall From her soft lap her flowers, and mourn'd their loss Lavish, nor for herself reserv'd her tears. The horseman, not unlike that ravisher, Wore kingly aspect, and his step and mien As though his realm were in a gloomier clime, Amid a drearier atmosphere, 'mid things Sluggish and melancholy, slow and dead. As though disclaimed by each, and claiming none, He lay, with cold impartial apathy Eyeing both hosts, as though their fates to him Were equal, and not worth the toil of hope. But over either army silence hung, Silence long, heavy, deep, as if each heart Were busied with eternity; all thoughts Seem'd bidding farewell to the Sun, whose rise They saw, whose setting they might never see. And all the heavens were thinly overdrawn With light and golden clouds, as though to couch The angels and the spirits floating there; While heaven the lucid hierarchy pour'd forth To view that solemn spectacle beneath, A battle waged for freedom and for faith. First rose a clamour and a crowding rush On the hill side, and a half-stifled cry, “The Prophetess! the Prophetess!” was heard. Upon a waggon, 'mid her idol Gods, She of the seal'd lip and the haunted heart, The aged Virgin Vetere apud Germanos more, quo plerasque feminarum fatidicas, et augescente superstitione, arbitrantur deas. Tac. Hist. 4–61. sate; her thin grey hair And hollow eyes with a strange sparkling ting'd. Twice in the memory of the oldest spake Her voice! when Gothic Alaric had set His northern ensign on Rome's shatter'd walls, That day, along the linden-shadow'd Elbe She went, with bitter smile and broken song That mock'd at grandeur fall'n, and pride in dust. Once more, when Vortigern in that fam'd feast Crown'd the fierce Hengist; in the German woods She roam'd, with lofty and triumphal tone Shrieking of sceptres dancing in her sight, And Woden's sons endiadem'd, that rose, And swept, and glitter'd past her. Now with eye Restless, and churning lip, she sate, and thrice She mutter'd—“Flight! Flight! Flight!” Then look'd she out Upon the orient Sun, and cried, “Down! down!” Then westward turn'd she, and withdrew her hand From dallying with her loose and hanging chin, And beckon'd to the faint remaining haze Of twilight. “Back, fair darkness, beauteous gloom, Back!” Still the Sun came on, the shades dispell'd. Then rose she up, then on the vacant space Between both armies fix'd her eye; half laugh, Half agony her cheek relax'd. “I see, I see you, ye Invisible! I hear, Soundless, I hear you! Choosers of the slain! Ye of the white forms hors'd on thunder clouds! Ye of Valhalla! colourless as air, As air impalpable! wind on and urge Your sable and self-govern'd steeds; they come, They whom your mantling hydromel awaits, Whose cups are crown'd, the guests of this night's feast. They come, they come, for whom the Gods shall leap From their cloud thrones, and ask you whom ye bring In stern troops crowding to their secret joy.” She shook her low-dropt lip, and thus went on: “The bow is broken, and the shafts are snapt; The lance is shiver'd, and the buckler rent; The helm is cloven, and the plumes are shed; The horse hath founder'd, and the rider fallen; The Crown'd are crownless, kingdomless the Kings; The Conquerors conquer'd, and the Slayers slain! One falls not, but he shall not stand! the axe Shall glean th' imperfect harvest of the sword; The scaffold drink the lees of battle's cup. And one is woundless amid myriad wounds, And one is wounded where there is but one.” She had not ended, when a single steed Burst furious from the British line: with flight That seemed to tread the air, and not the earth, Fierce and direct he hurried to the charge His youthful Rider. Upright sate the Boy Arthur, at first with half reverted look, As to his mother to impart his joy, His transport. Early, oh fame-destin'd Child! Putt'st thou thy sickle in the field of fame. Over his head a dome of fiery darts, And cross-bow bolts, vaults o'er th' encumber'd air. Yet forward swept the child his rapid course, And all at once to rescue all the Chiefs Rush'd onward: Uther's dragon seem'd to burn The winds with its hot waving; Emrys struck His courser's reeking flanks, his weapon huge Rear'd Vortimer, and Malwyn's wheels 'gan whirl. And on the other side Argantyr tall, Hengist and Horsa, all the titled brave, Burst from their tardy lines, that vast behind Came rolling in tumultuous order on. As when at spring-time under the cold pole Two islands high of ice warp heavy and huge Upon the contrary currents: first th' assault The promontories break, till meets the whole With one long crash, that wakes the silence, there Seated since time was born; far off and wide Rock'd by the conflict fierce old ocean boils. Still th' upright Child seem'd only to rejoice In the curvettings of his wanton steed, And in the mingled dazzling of bright arms. But over him a shield is spread, before A sword is wav'd; on every side the shield Repels each deadly blow, whirls everywhere The rapid and unwearied sword; the rein Of the fleet steed hath Samor grasp'd, and guides Amid the turmoil. As when the eagle sire Up in the sunshine leads his daring young, Sometimes the dusk shade of his wing spreads o'er, And soft and broken through the mantling plumes Gleams the unblinding splendour. So secure Wag'd that fair Child his early war. But wild The wavering fray rock'd to and fro, and burnt Like one huge furnace the quick-flashing plain. Ever, as 'twere the same the Apostle saw In the Apocalypse, Death's own pale steed, Over the broad fight shook the White Horse; spread, Where'er its gleaming lighten'd the dun gloom, Steamy and vast the curdling slaughter pools. And such confusion burst around of lines Mingling and interchanging, Valour found No space for proud selection, forc'd to strike What cumber'd and obstructed its free path; To hew out through a mass of vulgar life A passage to some princely foe. Twice met Horsa and Vortimer; Argantyr twice Smote at Pendragon; but the whirlpool fierce Asunder swept them, and the deep of war Swallow'd them; many a broad and shapeless chasm Was rent in either battle, but new fronts Rush'd in, and made the shiver'd surface whole. The sun was shut out by a sphere of dust That wrapt the tumult: 'twas no sight for Heaven That rending and defacing its prime work, That waste of man, its masterpiece. But far Th' Avenger had borne off the Child, his steed First drew his breath before Igerna's tent. With her soft face upon the dust she lay, Struggling to hush her own lament, in hope From the fierce din of war might haply come Some sound of cheer and comfort; yet when full It rush'd upon her hearing, loud she shriek'd To drown the very noise she strove to hear. But when her Child's voice sounded, she look'd up With a cold glance which said, “that sound I've heard Every sad moment since he went, my soul Is sick of self-deception, will not trust Again, to be again beguil'd.” She saw, And forc'd a sportive look to her sad face To lure him to her snowy arms. While he Back to the battle as a scene of joy Look'd waywardly, she clasp'd him to her breast With a fond anger, and both smil'd and wept. A moment Samor gaz'd on her, and—“All All have their hopes, and all those hopes fulfill'd, But I, this side the grave no hope for me And no fulfilment.” Fast as sight could track The battle felt him in its thousand folds. But the undistinguished and chance-mingled fight Young Malwyn brook'd not; he his virgin shield Disdain'd mean blood should stain: where Hengist fought He swept, the Saxon saw the eagle plume And turn'd aloof, and on some other head Discharg'd the blow for him uprear'd. But he Next plung'd, where Horsa's starlike weapon shone, Disastrous, shaking ruin; yet even that Glanc'd aside from the eagle plume. The Boy Utter'd a wrathful disappointed cry, And 'gainst Argantyr drove his car. He paus'd And cried aloud, “the eagle plume,” and plung'd Elsewhere for victims. That Pendragon heard, Even as he toil'd the third time to make way Amid' the circling slain to the Anglian crest, And taunting thus,—“Methinks the eagle plume Hath some few feathers of the dove, so soft Spreads its peace-breathing influence.” But the Youth, “Ha, Father! thus, thus guil'st thou to a faint And infamous security thy son? Thus enviest thou a noble foe? thus guard'st With a base privilege from peril? Off, Coward distinction! off, faint-hearted sign!” And helm and plume away he rent, his hair Curl'd down his shoulders, radiant on his brow The beauty of his anger shone, the pride Of winning thus a right to glorious death. Then set he forth on his bold quest again Impatient. Him Prince Vortimer beheld Sweeping between himself and Horsa, met Their sea-shore fight by Thanet to renew; But something of his sister in his face, Something of Lilian harden'd and grown fierce, As if the ungodly creed were true, and she, Familiar to rude deeds of blood, had come One of Valhalla's airy sisters hence To summon him she lov'd: that gleam of her, Albeit ungentle and unfeminine, still Exquisite, in 'mid air his rugged mace Suspended; but fierce Horsa on the Boy, Just on his neck, let fall the fatal spikes, And him the affrighted steeds bore off. And then Began a combat over which Death seem'd To hover, as of one assur'd, in hope Of both for victims at his godless shrine. Then wounded and bareheaded Malwyn urged On Hengist his remaster'd steeds, the scythe Ras'd his majestic war horse. But aside He sprung, and flank'd the chariot; long the strife, Long, though unequal: like a serpent's tongue Vibrated Malwyn's battle axe, twice bow'd The Monarch to his saddle bow.—'Twas fame More splendid, thus with Hengist to have fought Than to have conquer'd hosts of meaner men. Heavy at length and fatal glided in The wily Chief's eluding falchion stroke. Fast flew the steeds, the master lay behind, Dragging with his face downward, still the reins Cling in his cold and failing fingers, trail His neck and spread locks in the humid dust, His sharp arms character the yielding sand. Per terram, et versâ pulvis inscribitur hastâ.—Virgil. Æn. On fly they, him at length deserting mute And gasping on the bank, their hot hoofs plunge Into the limpid Dune, and to the wood Rove on. It chanc'd erewhile that thither came To freshen with the water his spent steeds, And lave the clogging carnage from his wheels, Caswallon. He his huge and weary length Cast for brief rest upon the bank; a groan Came from a helmless head that in the grass Lay undistinguish'd. “'Tis a Briton,” cried Caswallon, “cast the carrion off to feed The dogs and kites, that thus irreverent breaks Upon its monarch's rest.” Even as a flower, Poppy or hyacinth, on its broken stem, Languidly raises its encumber'd head, And turns it to the gentle evening sun: So feebly rose, so turn'd that Boy his face Unto the well-known voice; twice rais'd his head, Twice it fell back in powerless heaviness. Even at that moment from the dark wood came, Lured by their partners in the stall and field, His chariot coursers, heavily behind Dragging the vacant car, loose hung the reins, And mournfulness and dull disorder slack'd The spirit of their tread. Caswallon knew, And he leap'd up; the Boy his bloodless lips With a long effort opened. “Was it well, Father, at this my first, my earliest fight, To mock me with a baffled hope of fame? Well was it to defraud me of my right To noble death?”—and speaking thus he died. Above him his convuls'd unconscious hands Horribly sporting with his shaggy beard, Wrenching and twisting off the rooted locks, Yet senseless of the pain, the Father lean'd. Then leap'd he up, with cool and jealous care Within his chariot plac'd the lifeless corpse; And with his lash fierce rent the half-unyok'd Half-harness'd steeds; disorderly and swift As with their master's ire instinct they flew, Making a wide road through the hurtling fray. Briton or Saxon, friend or foe alike, Kinsman or stranger, one wide enmity 'Gainst general humankind, one infinite And undistinguishing lust of carnage, fill'd The Master and the coursers; so wild groans Follow'd where'er he mov'd, 'twas all to him, So slaughter dripp'd and reek'd from the chok'd scythes. The low lay mow'd like the spring grass, down swept On th' eminent, like lightning on the oaks, His battle axe, each time it fell each time A life was gone, each time a hideous laugh Shone on the Slayer's cheek and writhing lip. As in the oriental wars where meet Sultan and Omrah, under his broad tower Moves stately the huge Elephant, a shaft Haply casts down his friendly rider, wont To lead him to the tank, whose children shar'd With him their feast of fruits: awhile he droops Affectionate his loose and moaning trunk: Then in his grief and vengeance bursts, and bears In his fierce trampling rout and disarray To either army, ranks give way, and troops Scatter, while swaying on his heaving back His tottering tower, he shakes the sandy plain. Meanwhile had risen a conflict dread and fierce For Britain's royal banner; Hengist here, Argantyr, the Vikinger, Hermingard, And other Chiefs. But there th' Armoric King, Emrys, and Uther, with the Avenger stood, An iron wall against their inroad; turn'd Samor 'gainst him at distance heard and seen, The car-borne Mountaineer, then Uther met Argantyr, Hengist and King Emrys fought, The rest o'erbore King Hoel; one had slain The standard bearer, and all seiz'd at once The falling banner, all with hostile hand. When lo! that sable Warrior, that retir'd And careless had look'd on, upon his steed And in the battle: like a thundercloud He came, and like a thundercloud he burst, Black, silent, sullen, conquering without pride And slaying without triumph; three that grasp'd The standard came at once to earth, while he Over his head with kingly motion sway'd The bright redeemed ensign, and as fell The shaken sunlight radiant o'er his brow, Pride came about him, and with voice like joy He cried aloud, “Arles! Arles!” and shook his sword, “Thou'st won me once a royal crown, and now Shalt win a royal sepulchre.” The sword Perform'd its fatal duty, down they fell Before him, Jute and Saxon, nameless men And Chieftains; what though wounds he scorn'd to ward, Nor seem'd to feel, show'r'd on him, and his blood Ooz'd manifest, still he slew, still cried, “Arles! Arles!” Still in the splendour the wav'd standard spread Stood glorying the arm'd darkness of his form; Stood from his wounded steed dismounted; stood Amid an area of dead men, himself About to die, none daring an assault, He powerless of assailing. But the crown That on the flag-staff gleam'd he wrench'd away, And on his crest with calm solicitude Plac'd it, then planting 'mid the high-heap'd slain The standard, to o'ercanopy his sleep, As one upon his nightly couch of down Composes quietly his weary head, So royally he laid him down to die. But now was every fight broke off, a pause Seized all the battle, one vast silence quench'd All tumult; slain and slayer, life and death One torpor cover'd; droop'd at once and fail'd All passions, pride, wrath, vengeance, hate, dismay, All was one wide astonishment: save two That undistracted on each other gazed, Where helpless in their death-blood they lay steep'd, And slowly ebbed away each life, till first Horsa groan'd forth his fiery soul: then came A momentary tinge, soft and subdued As of affections busy at his heart, On Vortimer's expiring brow; his lip Had something of the curl men wear, when names Belov'd are floating o'er the thought; the flowers On that lone grave made fragrant his sick sense, And Eamont murmured on his closing ear. But he, whose coming cast this silence on Before it, as the night its widening shade, Curtaining nature in its soundless pall: An atmosphere of dying breath, where'er He moved, his drear envelopment; his path An element of blood: so fleet, so fast The power to fly seem'd wither'd, ere he came, Men laid them down and said their prayers and look'd For the quick plunging hoofs and rushing scythes. As when the palsied Universe aghast Lay, all its tenants, even Man, restless Man, In all his busy working mute and still, When drove, so poets sing, the Sun-born youth, Devious through heaven's affrighted signs, his Sire's Ill-granted chariot; him the Thunderer hurl'd From th' empyrean headlong to the gulf Of the half-parch'd Eridanus, where weep Even now the Sister Trees their amber tears O'er Phaeton untimely dead. And now Had the Avenger reach'd the path of death, And stood in arms before the steeds, they came Rearing their ireful hoofs to dash him down; But with both hands he seiz'd their foaming curbs, Holding them in their spring with outstretch'd arm Aloft, and made their lifted crests a shield Against their driver. He with baffled lash Goaded their quivering flanks, but that strong arm Held them above avoiding, their fore-hoofs Beat th' unhurt air, and the fast-falling foam, Like a thick snow-shower, overspread his breast, Then leap'd Caswallon down, back Samor hurl'd Coursers and chariot, and, “Now,” cried aloud, “Now, King of Britain, in the name of God I tender thee a throne, two yards of earth To rot on, and a diadem, a wreath Of death-drops for thy haught aspiring brow.” “There, there, look there,” Caswallon cried, his hand Stretch'd tow'rd his son, and in a frantic laugh Broke out, and echoed, “Diadems and thrones!” With rigid finger pointing at the dead. A moment, and the fury broke again; Down came the ponderous battle-axe, from edge To edge it rived the temper'd brass, as swift As shot-stars the thin ether; but the glaive Of Samor right into his bosom smote. Like some old turret, under whose broad shade At summer noon the shepherd oft his flock Hath driven, and in the friendly cool rejoic'd; Suddenly, violently, from its base Push'd by the winter floods, he fell; his look Yet had its savage blasphemy: he felt More than the blow, the deadly blow, the cries Of joy and triumph from each army sent, Vaunting and loud; to him to die was nought, He could not brook the shame of being slain. But other thoughts arose; hardly he crept To where dead Malwyn from the car hung down, Felt on his face the cold depending hand, And with a smile half joy, half anguish, died. Th' Avenger knelt, his heart too full for prayer, Knelt, and held up his conquering sword to heaven, Yet spake not. But the battle, as set free, Its rugged game renew'd, nor equal now Nor now unbroken; Flight and shameful Rout Here scattered, Victory there and Pride, array'd, And mass'd in comely files and full square troops, Bore onward. Mountaineer and German break Around the hill foot, and like ebbing waves Disperse away. Argantyr, Hengist move In the recoiling flood reluctant. Them Nought more resembled than two mountain bulls Driven by the horse and dog and hunter spear, Still turning with huge brow and tearing up The deep earth with their wrathful stooping horns. But as the hill was opened, from the top Even to the base ran down a shriek and scream, As when some populous Capital besieg'd Sees yawning her wide-breached wall, and all Her shatter'd bulwarks on the earth, so wild, So dissonant the female rout appear'd Hanging with fierce disturbance the hill side. Some with rent hair ran to and fro, some stood With silent mocking lip, some softly press'd Their infants to their heart, some held them forth As to invite the foe, and thus implore The mercy of immediate slaughter. Some Spake fiercely of past deeds of fame, some sang In taunting tone old songs of victory. Wives With eye imploring and quick heaving breast Look'd sad allusions to endearments past; Mothers, all bashfulness cast off, rent down Their garments, to their sons displaying bare This, if I remember right, was suggested by the description of the defeat of the Cimbri by Marius, in Plutarch. Vit. Marii, c. 27. The fountains of their infant nourishment, Now ready to be pierc'd with murtherous swords. Some knelt before their cold deaf Gods, some scoff'd With imprecation blasphemous and shrill Their stony and unwakening thunders. Noise Not fiercer on Cithæron side, th' affright Not drearier, when the Theban Bacchic rout, Their dashing cymbals white with moonshine, loose Their tresses bursting from their ivy crowns, And purple with enwoven vine-leaves, led Their orgies dangerous. In the midst the Queen Agave shook the misdeem'd Lion's head Aloft, and laugh'd and danc'd and sung, nor knew That lion suckled at her own white breast. See the striking scene in the Bacchanals of Euripides. But Elfelin the Prophetess her place Chang'd not, nor the near horror could recal Her eye from its strange commerce with th' unseen. There had she sate, there had she sate in smiles All the long battle; just before the spear Or falchion drank a warrior's life-blood, she Audible, as an high-tribunal'd judge, Spake out his name, and still her speech was doom. Nor long the o'erbearing flight enwrapt thy strength, Argantyr! thou amid the shattering wreck Didst rise, as in some ruinous city old, Babylon or Palmyra, magic-built, A single pillar yet with upright shaft Stands, 'mid the wide prostration mossy and flat, Shewing more eminent. Rush'd the Saxon by, And look'd and wonder'd, even that he delay'd; Cried his own Anglians—“King, away, away!” First came King Hoel on, whose falchion clove His buckler, with a wrest he burst in twain The shivering steel; came Emrys next, aside His misaim'd blow he shook; last Uther, him His war horse, by Argantyr's beam-like spear Then first appall'd, bore in vain anger past. From his late victory in proud breathlessness Slow came the Avenger, but Argantyr rais'd A cry of furious joy, “Long sought, late found, I charge thee, by our interrupted fight, I charge thee, give me back mine own! my sword Weary of bathing thus in vulgar gore Thirsts in some nobler blood to plunge; with thine I'll gild and hang it on my Father's grave, And his helm'd ghost in Woden's hall shall vaunt The glories of his son.”—“Generous and brave, When last we met, I shrunk to see my sword Bright with God's sunlight, now with dauntless hand I lift it, and cry ‘On, in the name of God.’” They met, they strove, as with a cloud enwrapt In their own majesty; their motions gave Terror even to their shadows; round them spread Attention like a sleep. Flight paus'd, Pursuit Caught up its loose rein, Death his furious work Ceas'd, and a dreary respite gave to souls Half parted; on their elbows rear'd them up The dying, with faint effort holding ope Their dropping eyelids, homage of delight War from its victims thus exacting. Mind And body engross'd the conflict. Men were seen At distance (for in their peculiar sphere, Within the wind and rush of their quick arms None ventur'd) following with unconscious limbs Their blows, and shrinking as themselves were struck. Like scatter'd shiverings of a scath'd oak lay Fragments of armour round them, the hard brass Gave way, and broke the fiery temper'd steel: The stronger metal of the human soul, Valour, endur'd; and power, thrice purified In Danger's furnace, fail'd not. Victory, tired Of wavering, to those passive instruments, Look'd to decide her long suspense. Behold Argantyr's falchion, magic-wrought, his sires So fabled, by the Asgard dwarfs, nor hewn From earthly mines, nor dipp'd in earthly fires, Broke short. The Anglians saw the ancestral steel, Sign of their Kings, and worship of their race, Give way, and wail'd and shriek'd aloud. The King Collected all his glory, as a pall To perish in, and scorn'd his sworded foe To mock with vain defence of unarm'd hand. The exultation and fierce throb of hope Yet had not pass'd away, but look'd to death As it had look'd to conquest, death, so well, So bravely earn'd, to warrior fair as life: Stern welcoming, bold invitation lured To its last work the Conqueror's sword. Him flush'd The pride of Conquest, vengeance long delay'd, Th' exalted shame of victory won so slow, So toilsomely; all fiery passions, all Tumultuous sense-intoxicating powers, Conspir'd, with their wild anarchy beset His despot soul. But he—“Ah, faithless sword, To me as to thy master faithless, him Naked at his extreme to leave, and me To 'guile of this occasion fair to win Honour or death from great Argantyr's arm.” “Christian, thy God is mightiest, scorn not thou His bounty, nor with dalliance mock thy hour— Strike and consummate!”—“Anglian, yes, my God, Th' Almighty, is the mightiest now and ever, Because I scorn him not, I will not strike.” So saying, he his sword cast down. “Thus, thus Warr'st thou?” the Anglian cried, “then thou hast won. I, I Argantyr yield me; other hand Had tempted me in vain with that base boon Which peasants prize and women weep for, life: To lord o'er dead Argantyr fate might grant, He only grants to vanquish him alive, Only to thee, well nam'd Avenger!” Then Both hosts the Captive and the Conqueror saw Gazing upon each other with the brow Of high-arch'd admiration. O'er the field From that example flow'd a noble scorn Of slaughtering the defenceless; mercy slak'd The ardour of the fight. As the speck'd birch After a shower with the odour of its bark Freshens the circuit of the rain-bright grove; Or as the tender argent of Love's star Smiles to a lucid quiet the wild sky: So those illustrious rivals with the light Of their high language and heroic act Cast a nobility o'er all the war. That capture took a host, none scorn'd to yield, So loftily Argantyr wore the garb Of stern surrender; none inclin'd to slay, When Samor held the signal up to spare. But where the Lord of that dire falchion nam'd The Widower of Women? He, the Chief Whose arms were squadrons, whose assault the shock Of hosts advancing? Hath the cream-blanch'd steed, Whom the outstripp'd winds pant after, borne away His master, yet with hope uncheck'd, and craft Unbaffled, th' equal conflict to renew? Fast flew the horse, and fierce the rider spurr'd, That horse that all the day remorseless went O'er dead and dying, all that Hengist slew All he cast down before him. Lo, he checks Suddenly, startingly, with ears erect, Thick tremor oozing out from every pore, His broad chest palpitating, the thick foam Lazily gathering on his dropping lip: The pawing of his uplift forefoot chill'd To a loose hanging quiver. Nor his Lord Less horror seiz'd; slack trembled in his left The bridle, with his right hand dropt his sword, Dripp'd slowly from its point the flaking blood Of hundreds, this day fall'n beneath its edge. For lo, descended the hill side, stood up Right in his path the Prophetess, and held With a severe compassion both her arms Over her head, and thus—“It cannot be, I've cried unto the eagle, air hath none; I've sued unto the fleet and bounding deer, I've sought unto the sly and mining snake; There's none above the earth, beneath the earth, No flight, no way, no narrow obscure way. I've call'd unto the lightning, as it leap'd Along heaven's verge, it cannot guide thee forth; I've beckon'd to the dun and pitchy gloom, It cannot shroud thee; to the caves of earth I've wail'd and shriek'd, they cannot chamber thee.” He spoke not, mov'd not, strove not: man and steed, Like some Equestrian marble in the courts Of Emperors; that fierce eye whose wisdom keen Pierc'd the dark depths of counsel, hawk-like roved, Seizing the unutter'd thoughts from out men's souls, Wrought order in the battle's turbulent fray By its command, on the aged Woman's face Fix'd like a moonstruck idiot. She upright With strength beyond her bow'd and shrivell'd limbs Still stood and murmur'd low, “Why com'st thou not, Thou of the Vale? thou fated, come! come! come!” The foes o'ertook, he look'd not round, their tramp Was round him, still he mov'd not; hostile hands Seiz'd on him, still the enchanted falchion hung Innocent as a feather by his side. They tore him from his steed, still clung his eyes On her disastrous face; she fiercely shriek'd Half pride at her accomplish'd prophecy, Half sorrow at Erle Hengist's fall; then down Upon the stone that bore her, she fell dead.

Oh Freedom, of our social Universe The Sun, that feedest from thy urn of light Our starlike commonwealth; from those mean lamps Modestly glimmering in their sphere retir'd, Even to the plenar and patrician orbs, That in their rich nobility of light, Or golden royalty endiadem'd, Their mystic circle undisturb'd round thee Move musical; but thou, thy central state Preserving, equably the fair-rank'd whole In dutiful magnificence maintain'st, And stately splendour of obedience. Earth Wonders, th' approval of th' Almighty beams Manifest in the glory of the work. Though sometimes drown'd within the red eclipse Of tyranny, or brief while by the base And marshy exhalations of low vice, And popular licence madden'd, thou hast flash'd Disastrous and intolerable fire; Yet, ever mounting, hast thou still march'd on To thy meridian throne. My waxen wing Oh, quenchless luminary! may not soar To that thy dazzling and o'erpowering noon; Rather the broken glimpses of thy dawn Visiting, when thy orient overcast A promise and faint foretaste of its light Beam'd forth, then plung'd its cloud-slak'd front in gloom. Even with such promise dost thou now adorn Thy chosen city by the Thames, where holds Victorious Emrys his high Judgment court. Thither the long ovation hath he led, Amid the solemn music of rent chains, The rapture of deliverance; where he pass'd Earth brightened, and the face of man, but now Brow-sear'd with the deep brand of servitude, Its old and upright privilege resumed Of gazing on his kindred heaven. The towns Gladden'd amid their ruins, churches shook With throngs of thankful votaries, Then did Aurelius Ambrosius put the Saxons out of all other parts of the land, and repaired such cities, towns, and also churches, as by them had been destroyed or defaced, &amp;c. Hol. Book 6, Chap. 8. till 'twas fear'd Transport might finish Desolation's work, And the glad crowd o'erthrow the half-moulder'd walls. 'Tis fam'd, men died for joy, untimely births Were frequent, as the eager mothers press'd To show their infants to the brightening world. They that but now beheld the bier-borne dead With miserable envy, pass'd them by Contemptuously pitying, as too soon Departed from this highly gifted earth. So they the Trinobantine City reach'd. Without the walls, close by the marge of Thames, The synod of the Conquerors met; a place Solemn and to the soul discoursing high. Here broad the bridgeless Thames, even like themselves Thus at their flush and high tide of renown, Swell'd his exulting waters. There all waste The royal cemetery of Britain lay, The monuments, like their cold tenantry, Mouldering, above all ruin, as beneath, A wide profound, drear sameness of decay. Upon the Church of Christ had heavily fallen The Pagan desolation, loose the doors Hung on their broken and disused hinge, And grass amid the chequer'd pavement squares Was springing, and along the vacant choir The shrill wind was God's only worshipper. Even where they met, through the long years have sate In Parliament our nation's high and wise. There have deep thoughts been ponder'd, strong designs On which the fate of the round world hath hung. Thence have the emanating rays of truth, Freedom, and constancy, and holiness, Flow'd in their broad beneficence, no bound Owning but that which limits this brief earth, Brightening this misty state of man; the winds That thence bear mandates to th' inconstant thrones Of Europe, to the realms of th' orient Sun, Or to the new and ocean-sever'd earth, Or to the Southern cocoa-feather'd isles, Are welcome, as pure gales of health and joy. Still that deep dwelling underneath the earth Its high and ancient privilege maintains, Dark palace of our island's parted Kings, Earth-ceil'd pavilion of our brave and wise, Disus'd for two long ages, it became The pavement of our sumptuous minster fair, That ever and anon yet gathers in King, Conqu'ror, Poet, Orator, or Sage To her stone chambers, there to sleep the sleep That wakens only at the Archangel's trump. Little did I foresee, when I wrote this as a youth, that, long years after, at the time that I should be correcting it for republication, I should lay to rest in this hallowed place (Westminster Abbey) a lovely little girl, whose early intelligence gave me the fond hope that she would hereafter take an interest in my pursuits, and love my poetry, at least, because it was her father's— My child! my child! among the great and wise, Thou 'st had thy peaceful solemn obsequies, Seem'st thou misplac'd in that fam'd company? Heaven's kingdom is made up of such as thee. February 4, 1839. First in the synod rose King Emrys; he, The royal sword of justice from his side Ungirding, plac'd it in the Avenger's hand, And led him to the judgment-seat. He shrunk, And offer'd back the solemn steel. “Oh! King, Judge and Avenger! who shall reconcile The discord of those titles, private wrongs Will load my partial arm, and drag to earth The unsteady balance. Only God can join And blend in one the Injur'd and the Judge.” But as a wave lifts up and bears along A stately bark, so the acclamation swell Floated into the high Tribunal throne Reluctant Samor: on his right the King Sate sceptred, royal Uther on the left: While all around the assembled Nation bask'd In his effulgent presence. 'Twas a boast In after ages this day to have seen Him whom all throng'd to see; memory of him, Each recollection of his mien and height, Became a heir-loom; mothers at the font Gave to their babes his name, and e'er that child Was held the staff and honour of the race. So met the Nation in their Judgment Hall, Its pavement was the sacred mother earth, Its roof the crystal and immortal heavens. Then forth the captives came, Argantyr first, Even with his wonted loftiness of tread: Nature's rich heraldry upon his brow Emblazing him of those whose scorn the world Bears unasham'd, by whom to be despis'd Is no abasement. Men's eyes rang'd from him To Samor, back to him—in wonder now At conquest o'er such mighty foe, now lost The wonder in their kindred Conqueror's pride. Then said the Anglian—“Wherefore lead ye here?” The sternness of his questioning appall'd All save the Judge. “What Briton,” he replied, “Witnesseth aught against the Anglian Chief?” Thereat was proclamation, East and West And North and South: the silent winds came back With wings unloaded: so that noble mien Wrought conquest o'er man's darkest passions, hate, And doubt, and terror, so the Captive cast His yoke on every soul, and harness'd it Unto his valiant spirit's chariot wheels. Then spake the stately and tribunal'd Judge— “Anglian Argantyr! Britain is not wont T' inflict upon a fair and open foe Aught penal but defeat; her warfare bows Beneath her feet but tramples not; her throne Hath borne the stormy brunt of thy assault, And dash'd it off, and thus she saith, ‘Return, Return unto thy German woods, nor more, Once baffled, vex our coasts with fruitless war. And thy return shall be to years remote Our bond and charter of security; A terror and a trembling at our name Shall pass with thee; the land that hath spurn'd back Argantyr's march of victory, shall be known T' eternal freedom consecrate. Your ships Shall plough our seas, but turn their timorous prows Aloof, while on the deck the Sea King points To our white cliffs, and saith—‘The Anglian thence Retreated, shun the unconquerable shore.’”— “So nevermore shall my hot warhorse bathe In British waters, nor my falchion meet The bold resistance of a British steel, Thus wills the Conqueror, thus the Conquer'd swears.” So spake Argantyr; sudden then and swift Loftier shot up his brow, prophetic hues Swam o'er his agitated features, words Came with a rush and instantaneous flow. “I tell thee, Briton, that thy sons and mine Shall be two meeting and conflicting tides, Whose fierce relentless enmity shall lash This land into a whirlpool deep and wide, To swallow in its vast insatiate gulf Her peace and smooth felicity, till flow Their waters reconcil'd in one broad bed, Briton and Anglian one in race and name. 'Tis written in the antient solemn Runes, 'Tis spoken by prophetic virgin lips. Avenger! thou and I our earthly wars Have ended, but my spirit yet shall hold Noble, inexorable strife with thine. It shall heave off its barrow, burst its tomb, And to my sons discourse of glorious foes In this rich Island to be met: my shade Shall cross them in their huntings, it shall walk The ocean paths, and on the winds, and seize Their prows, and fill their sails, and all its voice And all its secret influences urge To the White Isle: The Welsh called it Inis Wen, the White Island. Speed, B. 5. C. 2. Some derive Britain from Pryd Cain, Beauty and White. Ibid. their slumbers shall not rest, Their quiet shall be weariness, till lull'd Upon the pillow of success repose The high, the long, hereditary feud.” So saying, he the bark, that lay prepar'd With sail unfurl'd, ascended. She went forth Momently with quick shadow the blue Thames Darkening, then leaving on its breast a light Like silver. The fix'd eyes of wondering men Track'd his departure, while with farewell gleam The bright Sun shone upon his brow, and seem'd A triumph in the motion of the stream; So loftily upon its long slow ebb It bore that honour-laden bark.—Nor pause, Lo, in the presence of the Judgment Court The second Criminal; pride had not pass'd Nor majesty from his hoar brow; he stood With all except the terror of despair, Consciously in fatality's strong bonds Manacled, of the coming death assur'd, Yet fronting the black future with a look Obdurate even to scornfulness. He seem'd As he heard nought, as though his occupied ears Were pervious to no sound, since that dim voice Of her who speaking died, the silver hair'd, The Prophetess, that never spake untrue: As ever with a long unbroken flow Her song was ranging through his brain, and struck Its death-knell on his soul. Nor change had come Since that drear hour to eye or cheek; the craft, The wisdom that was wont to make him lord Over the shifting pageant of events, Had given its trust up to o'er-ruling fate, And that stern Paramount, Necessity, Had seal'd him for her own. Amid them all He tow'rd, as when the summer thunderbolt 'Mid a rich fleet some storm-accustom'd bark Hath stricken, round her the glad waters dance, Her sails are full, her strong prow fronts the waves But works within the irrevocable doom, Th' inundant surge wells up her secret hold, And th' heavy waters weigh her slowly down. The Judge for the arraignment made a sign. And the first witness was a mighty cry, As 'twere the voice of the whole Isle, and hills And plains and waters their abhorrence spake. Hoarse harmony of imprecation seem'd To break the ashy sleep of ruin'd towns, And th' untomb'd slumbers of far battle fields: As though the crowd about the Judgment Court Did only with articulate voice repeat What indistinct came down on every wind. Then all the near, the distant, sank away, Only a low and melancholy tone, Like a far music down a summer stream Remain'd; upon the lull'd, nor panting air Fell that smooth snow of sound, till nearer now It swell'd, as clearer water-falls are heard When midnight grows more still. A funeral hymn, It pour'd the rapture of its sadness out, Even like a sparkling soporific wine. But now and then broke from its low long fall Something of martial and majestic swell, That spake its mourning o'er no vulgar dead. Lo to the royal burying place, chance borne Even at this solemn time, or so ordain'd From their bright-scutcheon'd biers to bear their part In this arraignment, came King Vortigern, And th' honour'd ashes of his Son. But still And voiceless these cold witnesses passed on, Unto the place of tombs. Along the Thames Far floated into silence the spent hymn: And one accusing sound arose from them, The heavy falling of their earth to earth. One female mourner came behind the King, Half of her face the veil conceal'd, her eyes Were visible, and though a deadly haze Film'd their sunk balls, she sent into the grave, Following the heavy and descending corpse, A look of such imploring loveliness, A glance so sad, so self-condemning, men (So softly, tremulously it appeal'd) Might wonder that the spirit came not back To animate for the utterance that she wish'd Those bloodless lips; forgiveness it was plain She sought, and one so beauteous to forgive, The dead might almost wake. And she sate down Leaning her cheek upon a broken stone (Once a King's monument) as listening yet Th' acceptance of her prayers: nor cloister'd Nun Hath ever since, mourning her broken vows, And his neglect for whom those vows she broke, Come to the image of her Virgin Saint With such a faded cheek and contrite mien, As she who by those royal ashes sate. But lo, new witnesses; a matron train In flowing robes of grief came forth, the wives And mothers of those nobles foully slain At the Peace Banquet: them the memory yet Seem'd haunting of delicious days broke off. On Hengist, even a captive, dared not they Look firmly; as their helpless loneliness Spake for them, they their solitary breasts Beat, wrung their destitute cold hands, and pass'd. Then rose the mitred Germain, glanc'd his hand From that majestic criminal, where lay The ruins of God's church, and so sate down. But Samor look'd upon the mourner train, As though he sought a face that was not there, That could not be, soft Emeric's.—“I have none, I only none to witness of my wrongs.”— So said he, but he shook the softness off, On the tribunal rose severe, and stood Erect before the multitude. “Thou King, And ye, assembled People of this Isle, If that I speak your sentence right, give in Your sanction of Amen. Here stands the man, Who two long years laid waste with fire and sword Your native cities and your altar shrines: Here stands the man, who by slow fraud and guile Discrown'd your stately Monarch, Vortigern: Here stands the man, hath water'd with your blood The red and sickening herbage of your land: Here stands the man, that to your peaceful feast Brought Murder, that grim seneschal, and drugg'd With your most noble blood your friendly cups.” And at each charge came in the deep Amen, Even like the sounds men hear on stormy nights, When many thunders are abroad. Nought moved Stood Hengist, if emotion o'er him pass'd, Twas likest an elate contemptuous joy And glorying in those lofty worded crimes. Then, “Saxon Hengist, as thy sword hath made Our children fatherless, so fatherless Must be thy children!” But when this Hengist in processe of time thirsted after the whole kingdom of the South, he was banished, and yet afterward being restored, he conspired with the Scots against Aur. Ambrose, the son of Constantine, the just inheritor of this whole dominion. But his untruth and theirs were both recompensed together, for he was taken prisoner by Eldulph de Samor, a noble man of Britain, and his head for his traitories stricken off, at the commandement of Aurel. Ambrose.—Wm. Harrison. Description of Britain prefixed to Holinshed. A marginal note adds, “Some think the Seimors to come from this man by lineal descent, and I suppose no lesse.” I know not whether this noble family will own my hero for their ancestor. The Welsh tradition not merely bears out the fact of the execution of Hengist by Edol, or Eldol (Samor), but gives these words of Scripture, relating to the death of Agag, as used on the occasion.—Robert's Translation of the Brut of Tysilio. And Amen knoll'd back, As a plague-visited Metropolis Mourning the wide and general funeral, tolls From all her towers and spires the bell of death. “Thy children fatherless! not so—not so”— Rose with a shriek that Woman by the grave. And she sprang forth, as from beneath the earth, As a partaker of, no mourner near That kingly coffin. Veil fell off, and band Started, through her bright tresses her pale face Glitter'd, like purest ivory chas'd in gold. Between the Criminal and Judge her stand Rowena took; him as she saw and knew Flush'd a sick rapture o'er her face and neck, A fading rose-hue, like eve's parting light On a snow bank; but from her marble brow She the bright-clustering hair wip'd back, and thus, “Samor, the last time thou this brow beheld'st 'Twas lucid with the moonlight, since that hour The water hath flow'd o'er it, holy sign Hath there been left by Christian hand, and I Have learn'd thy creed, and one word breathes it all, Mercy.”—“But Justice is God's attribute, Lady, as well as Mercy, Man on earth Of both must be Vicegerent, lest the Power Of over-ramping Evil trample down The prostrate world. The doom hath been pronounc'd, The doom must be.”—“Ha! Man with heart of clay, To answer with that cold and stedfast mien; Oh, I'll go back and sue the dead again, There's more forgiveness in the cold deaf corpse, Than the relentless living. From that vault I felt sweet reconcilement stealing up, And peace came lulling to my inmost soul I ask not for myself, not for myself, The ice of death is round my heart, there long I've felt the mortal anguish prey, I feel The trembling ebb of my departing life. That hoary head, though granted to my prayers, Shall never rest upon my failing knee, The father that ye give me back (I feel Ye give him, thou that bear'st the Avenger's name, I know thee by a milder character) That father cannot long be mine; his hands May lay me in the grave, his eyes may weep, For they can weep, although ye think it not; Those hands ye deem for ever blood-embrued, I've felt them fondling with my golden hair, When with gay childish foot I danc'd to meet His far resounding horn. That horn shall sound, But on my deaf and earth-clos'd ears no more, No more.”—“Rowena, when a Nation speaks, The irrevocable sentence cannot change.” Then up her fair round arm she rais'd, and wrapt, Like a rich mantle round her, her old pride; As the poetic Juno on the clouds Walking in her majestic ire, while slow Before her th' azure-breasted peacocks draw Her chariot. “Tell me, thou that sitt'st elate, And ye, who call yourselves this British realm, By what new right ye judge a German King, Where are your charters, where your scrolls of law, Whose bright and blazond titles give ye power To pass a doom on crowned head? Down, down, Ye bold Usurpers of the Judgment seat, Insolent doomers of a sacred life, Inviolable by your impious breath.” “Lady, we judge by the adamantine law, That lives within the eternal soul of man, That God-enacted charter, ‘Blood for blood.’” Exhausted she sank down upon her knees, Her knees that fainted under her. “Nor can, Nor will ye shew unto a woman's eyes That bloody consummation, not to mine. Oh, thou that speakest in that sternest tone Implacable, the last time thou and I Discours'd, thy voice was broken, tender, soft, Remember'st thou? 'twas then as if it caught The trembling of the moonlight, that lay round With rapturous disquiet bathing us. Remember'st thou?” Almost the Judgment sword Fell from the Avenger's failing hand, but firm He grasp'd it, and with eyes to heaven upturn'd, “Oh, duty, duty, why art thou so stern?” Then “Lady, lo, the headsman with his steel; To that dark Priest 'tis given to sacrifice The victim of to-day—depart! depart!” Stately as lily on a sunshine bank, While drops from its curl'd leaves the o'ercharging dew, Freshens and strengthens its bow'd stem; so white So brightening to a momentary pride, A trembling majesty, Rowena sate. Fierce Hengist's dropping lip and knitted brow Seem'd but to mock her fate-opposing prayer, And that was all. But she—“Proud-hearted Men, Ye vainly deem your privilege, your right, Prerogative of your high-minded race, The glory of endurance, and the state Of strong resolving fortitude. Here I, A woman born to melt and faint and fail, A frail, a delicate, dying woman, sit To shame you.” She endur'd the flashing stroke Of th' axe athwart her eyesight, and the blood That sprung around her she endur'd: still kept The lily its unbending stateliness, And its unfading beauty sparkled still, But all its odours were exhal'd—the breath Of life, the tremulous motion was at rest; A flower of marble on a temple wall, 'Twas fair but lived not, glitter'd but was cold; While from the headless corpse t' its great account Went fiercely forth the Pagan's haughty soul. THE BELVIDERE APOLLO: It is right to observe that this Prize Poem was published many years before the 4th Canto of Childe Harold, in which occur the fine lines on the same subject. A Prize Poem, RECITED IN THE THEATRE, OXFORD, IN THE YEAR MDCCCXII. Heard ye the arrow hurtle in the sky? Heard ye the dragon monster's deathful cry? In settled majesty of calm disdain, Proud of his might, yet scornful of the slain, The heav'nly Archer stands The Apollo is in the act of watching the arrow with which he slew the serpent Python.—no human birth, No perishable denizen of earth; Youth blooms immortal in his beardless face, A God in strength, with more than godlike grace; All, all divine—no struggling muscle glows, Through heaving vein no mantling life-blood flows, But animate with deity alone, In deathless glory lives the breathing stone. Bright kindling with a conqueror's stern delight, His keen eye tracks the arrow's fateful flight; Burns his indignant cheek with vengeful fire, And his lip quivers with insulting ire: Firm fix'd his tread, yet light, as when on high He walks th' impalpable and pathless sky: The rich luxuriance of his hair, confined In graceful ringlets, wantons on the wind, That lifts in sport his mantle's drooping fold, Proud to display that form of faultless mould. Mighty Ephesian! Agasias of Ephesus. I assigned the statue to Agasias of Ephesus on the authority, if I remember right, of the French Encyclopedie, not having, at that time, the opportunity of consulting better authorities. with an eagle's flight Thy proud soul mounted through the fields of light, View'd the bright conclave of Heav'n's blest abode, And the cold marble leapt to life a God: Contagious awe through breathless myriads ran, And nations bow'd before the work of man. For mild he seem'd, as in Elysian bowers, Wasting in careless ease the joyous hours; Haughty, as bards have sung, with princely sway Curbing the fierce flame-breathing steeds of day; Beauteous as vision seen in dreamy sleep By holy maid on Delphi's haunted steep, Mid the dim twilight of the laurel grove, Too fair to worship, too divine to love. Yet on that form in wild delirious trance With more than rev'rence gazed the Maid of France. Day after day the love-sick dreamer stood With him alone, nor thought it solitude; To cherish grief, her last, her dearest care, Her one fond hope—to perish of despair. Oft as the shifting light her sight beguiled, Blushing she shrunk, and thought the marble smiled: Oft breathless list'ning heard, or seem'd to hear, A voice of music melt upon her ear. Slowly she waned, and cold and senseless grown, Closed her dim eyes, herself benumb'd to stone. Yet love in death a sickly strength supplied. Once more she gazed, then feebly smiled and died. The foregoing fact is related in the work of Mons. Pinel sur l'Insanité. JUDICIUM REGALE, This Poem was written after the fall of Buonaparte, and previous to the visit of the Allied Sovereigns to this country. AN ODE. I slept, and as in solemn judgment court, Amid a tall imperial city, sate The sceptred of the world: their regal port Show'd lords of earth; and as on empire's fate They communed, grave each brow, and front serene; Holy and high their royalty of mien; Seem'd nor pale passion, nor blind interest base, Within that kingly Sanhedrin had place. Abroad were sounds as of a storm gone past, Or midnight on a dismal battle field; Aye some drear trumpet spake its lonely blast, Aye in deep distance sad artillery peal'd, Booming their sullen thunders—then ensued The majesty of silence—on her throne Of plain or mountain, listening sate and lone Each nation to those crowned Peers' decree; And this wide world of restless beings rude Lay mute and breathless as a summer sea. To the Universal Judge, that conclave proud Their diadem-starr'd foreheads lowly bow'd; When, at some viewless summoner's stern call, Uprose in place the Imperial Criminal. In that wan face nor ancient majesty Left wither'd splendor dim, nor old renown Lofty disdain in that sad sunken eye; No giant ruin even in wreck elate Frowning dominion o'er imperious fate, But one to native lowliness cast down. A sullen, careless desperation gave The hollow semblance of intrepid grief, Not that heroic patience nobly brave, That even from misery wrings a proud relief; Nor the dark pride of haughty spirits of ill, That from the towering grandeur of their sin, Wear on the brow triumphant gladness still, Heedless of racking agony within; Nor penitence was there, nor pale remorse, Nor memory of his fall from kingly state, And warrior glory in his sun-like course, Fortune his slave, and Victory his mate. 'Twere doubt if that dark form could truly feel, Or were indeed a shape and soul of steel. With that from North and South an ireful train Came forth that mighty culprit to arraign. The first was as a savage Horseman bold, The Cossack. Uncouth his rude attire, his bearing wild; But gallant was his brow that lightly smiled, As seeming war some merry sport to hold: The air whereon his fleet steed seem'd to prance Flamed with the steely bickering of his lance. And on the waves of his broad banner's fold An old barbaric Capital he bore, Moscow. Like some tall grove of pinnacle and spire, Or snowy white, or gleaming rich with gold: But the red havoc of upspringing fire A fatal flood of glory seem'd to pour; And still from gilded roof or dome upbroke In dusky pillars huge the cloudy smoke. Nor word that Horseman spake, but as he came Waved his grim standard like a pall of flame. And next came one all trim in fearful grace And tall majestic symmetry of war, Musket and bayonet flashing bright and far; Deliberate valour in his slow firm pace, And scorn of death—him at the portal arch Saluted blithe old Frederick's bugle march. Heavy his charge—of lordly King bow'd down In his own royal city to the frown Of the base minion to a despot's hate— Alluding to a governor being set over the King of Prussia in Berlin. Then blanch'd the Soldier's bronzed and furrow'd cheek, While of coarse taunting outrage he 'gan speak, To her the beautiful, the delicate, The queenly, but too gentle for a Queen— But in sweet pride upon that insult keen She smiled—then drooping mute, though broken hearted, To the cold comfort of the grave departed. The next like some old Baron's lordly son Bore what a rich imperial crown had been, But from its stars the pride of light was gone; The joy of vengeance on that warrior's mien Was chasing the red hues of ancient shame: Not of Marengo's fair-fought field he told, Nor the wide waves of blood huge Danube roll'd; But him that in strong Ulm play'd that foul game, Bartering his country and his soul for gold: And that fair royal Maid, by battle won Like thing that hath nor will nor sense, and borne A bright and beauteous trophy to adorn The brittle grandeur of an upstart's throne. Next came a stately Lady, once was she Queen of the Nations: of her despot sway Earth boasted, every flood and every sea Water'd her tributary realms, and day Rose only on her empire: now it seem'd That she had cast her cumbrous crown away To slumber in her vales that basking lie In the luxurious azure of her sky; On Saint or Virgin, such as Raphael dream'd, In almost blameless fond idolatry, Speechless to gaze, and bow the adoring knee; In the soul's secret chambers to prolong The rapturous ravishment of harp and song. Music was in her steps, and all her eye Was dark and eloquent with ecstasy. Rapine her charge—of Florence' princely halls, And that fall'n Empress by old Tiber's side Reft of the sole sad relics of her pride; For the iron conqueror ravish'd from her walls Those shapes that in their breathing colours warm In tall arcade or saintly chapel lived, And all wherein the soul of Greece survived The more than human of each marble form. Of the proud bridegroom of the Adrian Sea, Once like his bride magnificent and free, Sunk to a bond-slave's desperate apathy. And him the Holiest deem'd, the chosen of God, Beneath an earthly lord bow'd down to kiss the rod. And next came one, the bravery of whose front Crested hereditary pride; his arms Were dark and dinted by rude battle's brunt: Spain. Of Sovereign young he spake, by wizard charms Of hollow smiling treachery from the throne Of two fair worlds to felon durance lured, A King in narrow prison walls immured; And some rude islander's soul-groveling son Set up to be a princely nation's Lord:— But then the Spaniard with fierce brow and bright Brandish'd the cloudy flaming of his sword; Full was his soul of Zaragoza's fight, And the high Pyrenean snows o'erleap'd, And other Pavias with Frank carnage heap'd. The brother of his wrongs and of his wrath Portugal. Was with him in the triumph of his path. He of his exile Prince 'gan loudly boast; To be a sceptred slave, a pageant King, He scorn'd, and on his fleet bark's gallant wing For kingly freedom the wild ocean crost. Whom saw I then in port and pride a Queen, Come walking o'er her own obsequious sea? I knew thee well, the valiant, rich, and free!— As when old Rome, her Roman virtue tame, Gazed, when in arms that bold Dictator came; With the iron ransom of her Capitol Startled to flight the fierce insulting Gaul— Camillus of mankind! thy regal mien Gladdened all earth; the nations from their rest Joyful upleaped: with modest front elate, Like one that hath proud conscience in her breast, Thou brakest the blank silence—“Woe and hate To this bad man for those my good and great, That sleep amid the Spaniard's mountains rude In the sad beauty of the hero's fate. To this bad man immortal gratitude, For he hath taught, who slaves the free of earth Fettereth the whirlwind: hath given glorious birth To deeds that dwarf my old majestic fame, Make Blake and Marlborough languid sound and tame To Nelson and that Chief to whom defeat Is like an undiscovered star—hath shown More than the Macedonian victories vain To rivet on the earth the Oppressor's chain: As little will yon Sun's empyrean throne Endure a mortal seat, as this wide globe Be one man's appanage; or my fair isle, That precious gem in ocean's azure robe, Cast Freedom's banner down, by force or guile Mastered, and forfeit earth's renown and love, And her bright visions of high meed above.” Then all at once did from all earth arise Fierce imprecations on that man of sin; And all the loaded winds came heavy in With exultations and with agonies. From the lone coldness of the widow's bed, The feverish pillow of the orphan's head, From dying men earth's woful valleys heaping, From smouldering cities in their ashes sleeping, Like the hoarse tumbling of a torrent flood Mingled the dismal concord—“Blood for blood.” But then arose a faded shape and pale, Once had she been a peerless princely dame; France. Downcast her grace of grief; she seemed to veil The mournful beauty of her face for shame. And is this she whose sprightly laughing mirth Was like the blithe spring on the festal earth; Aye dancing at the moonlight close of day, 'Mid purple vineyards, graceful, light, and gay; Or in high pomp and gallant pride of port Holding rich revel in her gorgeous court?— Abrupt her speech and wild—“When I 'gan wake From that my sleep of madness, all around Of human blood a broad and livid lake Was in my splendid cities; mound on mound Rose peopled with my noble princely dead: And o'er them the fell anarch, Murther, stood Grimly reposing in his weary mood— I turned, all trembling turned, my guilty head: There humankind had leagued their arms of dread 'Gainst the Blasphemer of fair Freedom's name, Heaven gave no hope, for heaven I dared disclaim. High in the flaming car of victory riding, From Alp to Alp his chamois warriors guiding, The peril of wild Lodi's arch bestriding, I saw yon Chieftain in his morn of fame; Cities and armies at his beck sank down, And in the gaudy colours of renown The fabling Orient vested his young name. The bright and baleful Meteor I adored, Low bow'd I down, and said—‘Be thou my Lord!’ Like old and ruinous towers, the ancient thrones Crumbled, and dynasties of elder time; The banners of my conquest-plumed sons Flouted the winds of many a distant clime: On necks of vanquish'd kings I fix'd my seat, And the broad Rhine roll'd vassal at my feet. Thrice did the indignant Nations league their might, Thrice the red darkness of the battle night Folded the recreant terror of their flight. Realms sack'd and ravaged empires sooth'd my toils, And Satrap Chiefs were Monarchs from my spoils. In solitude of freedom that rich Queen Sate in her sanctity of waves serene. From cliff and beach, dominion in their motion, I saw her stately navies' broad array, Like jealous lords at watch, that none but they Adulterate with their fair majestic ocean. And cries I heard like frenzy and dismay Of Nelson, Nelson deepening on their way. But what to me though red the western deep With other fires than of the setting sun? And what to me though round Trafalgar's steep My haughty pennon'd galleys, one by one, Come rolling their huge wrecks on the waves' sweep? Go rule thy brawling and tumultuous sea, Briton, but leave the servile earth to me. And what to me though in my dungeons deep By this new Charlemagne dark deeds were done— Will the stones start and babble to the sun How that bold Briton Wright, and Pichegru sleep? At noon of night I heard the drum of death, The Death of D'Enghien. Like evil spirits on the blasted heath By the drear torchlight iron men were met. The mockery of justice soon was pass'd; Again the drum its dismal warning beat: Then flashing muskets deathful lustre cast A moment on the victim; he sedate In calm disdain of even a felon's fate His royal breast bared to the soldiers' mark, Seeming to pity with his steady sight Those poor mechanic murderers—then 'twas dark, All but yon crown'd Assassin's visage bright, Who waved his torch in horrible delight. O blood of Condé! could thy spirit rest In thy tame country's cold ungrateful breast? Yet in my drunkenness of pride I mock'd Mean crimes that would a petty tyrant shame, For still in glory's cradle was I rock'd, Mine eagle eyrie crown'd the steep of fame. Nought heeded I, that the proud son of Spain, Like a fierce courser that has burst his chain, Shook the base slavery from his floating mane. And that new British Arthur's virgin shield Won its rich blazon on Vimeira's field. For lo, my cities throw their portals wide; Gorgeous my festal streets, as when of old The monarchs met upon the Plain of Gold— Lo, on my throne a bright and royal bride! Vain all my pomp, imperial beauty vain The reveller in battles to restrain. And at his word, as at the fabled wand Of old magician, from the teeming land, Myriad on myriad, harness'd warriors rise; The earth was darkened with excess of light, Line after line, insufferably bright; The black artillery, in their cloudy might, Impious defiance launched against the skies. With tamer sounds did that wild Heathen Salmoneus. vaunt Amid his thunderous heavens high Jove to daunt. Day after day I saw their pomp depart; Then said the haughty frenzy of my heart, When o'er this world thy victor wheels are driven, Wilt thou go vanquish the bright stars of Heaven? And lo, the rival nations hurrying To crowd beneath my passing eagle's wing; Lo, 'mong my captains many a sceptred king. Now, now the Northern skies are all on fire As with some mighty Empire's funeral pyre! Why bring they not proud Catherine's trophies home? I hear the sound of wheels—‘They come, they come.’ A solitary sound—no pomp of war, One dastard pale accomplice of his flight, He comes, whom earth, and all earth's sons obey, The peerless and the paragon of might; The pinnace of the Persian runaway Was glory to his lone and hurrying car. I ask'd for those in fight, in triumph tried, The partners of his peril and his pride. He, in a tyrant's mockery of my woe, Bade me go seek them in the Scythian snow. Then felt I what a pitiful tame slave Was I, who vaunted me mankind's sole queen, The satellite of one man's wayward spleen— The remnant of my fair, my young, my brave, Were rent once more to forge the adamant chain Burst by the nations, who with one accord Shook the bright vengeance of the freeman's sword— Another year—and the broad Rhine again Shrouded the sceptred fugitive's pale train, Then turned a rebel, rolled her free waves to the main. And now the banners of the embattled world Their folds of vengeance on my vales unfurled. Oh, bloody was the evening of thine ire, Thou gorgeous comet of disastrous fire! I wont to see, as from some quiet star, Deluging slaughter this fair earth o'erwhelm, On the rich bosom of my sunny realm Gave quarry to the ravening dogs of war. But mercy shone upon the merciless! Strong but to save and valiant but to bless, No ruthless Cæsars clad in blood and flame, Royal in virtue the Avengers came. Those whom I spoiled, no spoilers came to me, I said, ‘Be slave, O earth!’ but they—‘O France, be free.’ For yon dark Chief of woe, and guilt, and strife, O sceptred Judges! punish him with life. Fear not he seek with the old Roman pride, That weakness to the noble soul allied, To die as Cato, and as Brutus died. Fear not that in his abject heart he show That martyr fortitude, that smiles in woe. By him shall that great secret be betrayed, Of what poor stuff are earth's dread tyrants made. Oh, let him live to be despised, to see France happy, and the glorious nations free; Death were delight to that deep misery!”— Then did that kingly conclave, with one voice, Pass the dread sentence on the gloomy man; In his soul's icy deadness he alone By others' woes seemed hardened to his own. From land to land the penal tidings ran; Earth lifted up her rich face to rejoice, The bright blue heavens bade wintry warring cease, And spring came dancing o'er a world at peace. FORTUNE. (FROM THE ITALIAN OF GUIDI.) A Lady, like to Juno in her state, Upon the air her golden tresses streaming, And with celestial eyes of azure beaming, Entered whilere my gate. Like a Barbaric Queen On the Euphrates' shore, In purple and fine linen was she pall'd, Nor flower nor laurel green, Her tresses for their garland wore The splendour of the Indian emerald. But through the rigid pride and pomp unbending Of beauty and of haughtiness, Sparkled a flattery sweet and condescending; And from her inmost bosom sent, Came accents of most wonderous gentleness, Officious and intent To thrall my soul in soft imprisonment. And, “place,” she said, “thy hand within my hair, And all around thou'lt see Delightful chances fair On golden feet come dancing unto thee. Me Jove's daughter shalt thou own, That with my sister Fate Sits by his side in state On the eternal throne. Great Neptune to my will the ocean gives; In vain, in well appointed strength secure, The Indian and the Briton strives The assaulting billows to endure; Unless their flying sails I guide Where over the smooth tide On my sweet spirit's wings I ride. I banish to their bound The storms of dismal sound, And o'er them take my stand with foot serene; The Æolian caverns under The wings of the rude winds I chain, And with my hand I burst asunder The fiery chariot wheels of the hurricane: And in its fount the horrid restless fire I quench, ere it aspire To Heaven to colour the red Comet's train. This is the hand that forged on Ganges' shore The Indians' empire; by Orontes set The royal tiar the Assyrian wore; Hung jewels on the brow of Babylon, By Tigris wreath'd the Persian's coronet, And at the Macedonian's foot bow'd every throne. It was my lavish gift, The triumph and the song Around the youth of Pella loud uplift, When he through Asia swept along, A torrent swift and strong; With me, with me the Conqueror ran To where the Sun his golden course began; And the high Monarch left on earth A faith unquestion'd of his heavenly birth; By valour mingled with the Gods above, And made a glory of himself to his great Father Jove. My royal spirits oft Their solemn mystic round On Rome's great birth-day wound: And I the haughty Eagles sprung aloft Unto the Star of Mars upborne, Till, poising on their plumy sails, They 'gan their native vales And Sabine palms to scorn: And I on the seven hills to sway That Senate House of Kings convened, On me their guide and stay Ever the Roman councils lean'd In danger's lofty way. I guerdoned the wise delay Of Fabius with the laurel crown, And hot Marcellus' fiercer battle tone; And I on the Tarpeian did deliver Afric a captive, and through me Nile flow'd Under the laws of the great Latin river; And of his bow and quiver The Parthian rear'd a trophy high and broad: The Dacian's fierce inroad Against the gates of iron broke, Taurus and Caucasus endured my yoke: Then my vassal and my slave Did every native land of every wind become, And when I had o'ercome All earth beneath my feet, I gave The vanquished world in one great gift to Rome. I know that in thine high imagination, Other daughters of Great Jove Have taken their Imperial station, And queen-like thy submissive passions move; From them thou hop'st a high and god-like fate, From them thy haughty verse presages An everlasting sway o'er distant ages, And with their glorious rages Thy mind intoxicate, Deems 'tis in triumphal motion, On courser fleet, or winged bark, Over earth and over ocean; While in shepherd hamlet dark Thou liv'st, with want within, and raiment coarse without; And none upon thy state hath thrown Gentle regard; I, I alone To new and lofty venture call thee out; Then follow, thus besought, Waste not thy soul in thought; Brooks nor sloth nor lingering The great moment on the wing. “A blissful lady and immortal, born From the eternal mind of Deity, (I answer'd, bold and free,) My soul hath in her queenly care; She mine imagination doth upbear, And steeps it in the light of her rich morn, That overshades and sicklies all thy shining; And though my lowly hair Presume not to bright crowns of thy entwining, Yet in my mind I bear Gifts nobler and more rare Than the kingdoms thou canst lavish, Gifts thou canst nor give nor ravish: And though my spirit may not comprehend Thy chances bright and fair, Yet neither doth her sight offend The aspect pale of miserable care: Horror to her is not Of this coarse raiment, and this humble cot; She with the golden Muses doth abide, And oh! the darling children of thy pride Shall then be truly glorified, When they may merit to be wrapt around With my Poesy's eternal sound.” She kindled at my words and flamed, as when A cruel star hath wide dispread Its locks of bloody red, She burst in wrathful menace then: “Me fears the Dacian, me the band Of wandering Scythians fears, Me the rough mothers of Barbaric kings; In woe and dread amid the rings Of their encircling spears The purple tyrants stand; And a shepherd here forlorn Treats my proffered boons with scorn. And fears he not my wrath? And knows he not my works of scathe; Nor how with angry foot I went, Of every province in the Orient Branding the bosom with deep tracks of death? From three Empresses I rent The tresses and imperial wreath, And bar'd them to the pitiless element. Well I remember when his armed grasp From Asia stretch'd, rash Xerxes took his stand Upon the formidable bridge to clasp And manacle sad Europe's trembling hand: In the great day of battle there was I, Busy with myriads of the Persian slaughter, The Salaminian sea's fair face to dye, That yet admires its dark and bloody water; Full vengeance wreak'd I for the affront Done Neptune at the fetter'd Hellespont. To the Nile then did I go, The fatal collar wound The fair neck of the Egyptian Queen around; And I the merciless poison made to flow Into her breast of snow. Ere that within the mined cave, I forced dark Afric's valour stoop Confounded, and its dauntless spirit droop, When to the Carthaginian brave, With mine own hand, the hemlock draught I gave. And Rome through me the ravenous flame In the heart of her great rival, Carthage, cast, That went through Lybia wandering, a scorn'd shade, Till, sunk to equal shame, Her mighty enemy at last A shape of mockery was made: Then miserably pleased, Her fierce and ancient vengeance she appeased; And even drew a sigh Over the ruins vast Of the deep-hated Latin majesty. I will not call to mind the horrid sword Upon the Memphian shore, Steep'd treasonously in great Pompey's gore; Nor that for rigid Cato's death abhorr'd; Nor that which in the hand of Brutus wore The first deep colouring of a Cæsar's blood. Nor will I honour thee with my high mood Of wrath, that kingdoms doth exterminate; Incapable art thou of my great hate, As my great glories. Therefore shall be thine Of my revenge a slighter sign; Yet will I make its fearful sound Hoarse and slow rebound, Till seem the gentle pipings low, To equal the fierce trumpet's brazen glow.” Then sprung she on her flight, Furious, and at her call, Upon my cottage did the storms alight, Did hurricanes and thunders fall. But I, with brow serene, Beheld the angry hail And lightning flashing pale, Devour the promise green Of my poor native vale. THE LOVE OF GOD. TWO SONNETS. I. Love Thee!—oh, Thou, the world's eternal Sire! Whose palace is the vast infinity, Time, space, height, depth, oh God! are full of Thee, And sun-eyed seraphs tremble and admire. Love Thee;—but Thou art girt with vengeful fire, And mountains quake, and banded nations flee, And terror shakes the wide unfathom'd sea, When the heavens rock with thy tempestuous ire. Oh, Thou! too vast for thought to comprehend, That wast ere time,—shalt be when time is o'er; Ages and worlds begin—grow old—and end, Systems and suns thy changeless throne before, Commence and close their cycles:—lost, I bend To earth my prostrate soul, and shudder and adore! II. Love Thee!—oh, clad in human lowliness, —In whom each heart its mortal kindred knows— Our flesh, our form, our tears, our pains, our woes,— A fellow-wanderer o'er earth's wilderness! Love Thee! whose every word but breathes to bless! Through Thee, from long-seal'd lips glad language flows; The blind their eyes, that laugh with light, unclose; And babes, unchid, thy garment's hem caress. —I see Thee, doom'd by bitterest pangs to die, Up the sad hill, with willing footsteps, move, With scourge, and taunt, and wanton agony, While the cross nods, in hideous gloom, above, Though all—even there—be radiant Deity! —Speechless I gaze, and my whole soul is Love! THE SLAVE SHIP. [Founded on the following fact:—“The case of the Rodeur, mentioned by Lord Lansdowne. A dreadful ophthalmia prevailed among the slaves on board this ship, which was communicated to the crew, so that there was but a single man who could see to guide the vessel into port.” —Quart. Rev. vol. 26, p. 71.] “Old, sightless man, unwont art thou, As blind men use, at noon To sit and sun thy tranquil brow, And hear the bird's sweet tune. There's something heavy at thy heart, Thou dost not join the pray'r; Even at God's word thou'lt writhe and start,”— “Oh! man of God, beware! “If thou didst hear what I could say, 'T would make thee doubt of grace, And drive me from God's house away, Lest I infect the place.” “Say on; there's nought of human sin, Christ's blood may not atone:” “Thou canst not read what load's within This desperate heart.”—“Say on.” “The skies were bright, the seas were calm, We ran before the wind, That, bending Afric's groves of palm, Came fragrant from behind. “And merry sang our crew, the cup Was gaily drawn and quaff'd, And when the hollow groan came up From the dark hold, we laugh'd. “For deep below, and all secure, Our living freight was laid, And long with ample gain, and sure, We had driven our awful trade. “They lay, like bales, in stifling gloom, Man, woman, nursling child, As in some plague-struck city's tomb The loathsome dead are piled. “At one short gust of that close air The sickening cheek grew pale; We turn'd away—'t was all our care— Heaven's sweet breath to inhale. “'Mid howl and yell, and shuddering moan, The scourge, the clanking chain, The cards were dealt, the dice were thrown, We staked our share of gain. “Soon in smooth Martinico's coves Our welcome bark shall moor, Or underneath the citron-groves That wave on Cuba's shore. “'T was strange, ere many days were gone, How still grew all below, The wailing babe was heard alone, Or some low sob of woe. “Into the dusky hold we gazed, In heaps we saw them lie, And dim, unmeaning looks were raised From many a blood-red eye. “And helpless hands were groping round To catch their scanty meal; Or at some voice's well-known sound, Some well-known touch to feel. “And still it spread, the blinding plague That seals the orbs of sight; The eyes were rolling, wild and vague; Within was black as night. “They dared not move, they could not weep, They could but lie and moan; Some, not in mercy, to the deep, Like damaged wares, were thrown. “We cursed the dire disease that spread, And cross'd our golden dream; Those godless men did quake with dread, To hear us thus blaspheme. “And so we drank, and drank the more, And each man pledged his mate; Here's better luck, from Gambia's shore When next we load our freight. “Another morn, but one—the bark Lurch'd heavy on her way— The steersman shriek'd, ‘Hell's not so dark As this dull murky day.’ “We look'd, and red through films of blood Glared forth his angry eye: Another, as he mann'd the shroud, Came toppling from on high. “Then each alone his hammock made, As the wild beast his lair, Nor friend his nearest friend would aid, In dread his doom to share. “Yet every eve some eyes did close Upon the sunset bright, And when the glorious morn arose, It bore to them no light. “Till I, the only man, the last Of that dark brotherhood, To guide the helm, to rig the mast, To tend the daily food. “I felt it film, I felt it grow, The dim and misty scale, I could not see the compass now, I could not see the sail. “The sea was all a wavering fog, The sun a hazy lamp, As on some pestilential bog, The wandering wild-fire damp. “And there we lay, and on we drove, Heaved up, and pitching down; Oh! cruel grace of Him above, That would not let us drown. “And some began to pray for fear, And some began to swear; Methought it was most dread to hear Upon such lips the prayer. “And some would fondly speak of home, The wife's, the infant's kiss; Great God! that parents e'er should come On such a trade as this! “And some I heard plunge down beneath, And drown—that could not I: Oh! how my spirit yearn'd for death, Yet how I fear'd to die! “We heard the wild and frantic shriek Of starving men below, We heard them strive their bonds to break, And burst the hatches now. “We thought we heard them on the stair, And trampling on the deck, I almost felt their blind despair, Wild grappling at my neck. “Again I woke, and yet again, With throat as dry as dust, And famine in my heart and brain, And,—speak it out I must,— “A lawless, execrable thought, That scarce could be withstood, Before my loathing fancy brought Unutterable food. “No more, my brain can bear no more,— Nor more my tongue can tell; I know I breathed no air, but bore A sick'ning grave-like smell. “And all, save I alone, could die— Thus on death's verge and brink All thoughtless, feelingless, could lie— I still must feel and think. “At length, when ages had pass'd o'er, Ages, it seem'd, of night, There came a shock, and then a roar Of billows in their might. “I know not how, when next I woke, The numb waves wrapp'd me round, And in my loaded ears there broke A dizzy, bubbling sound. “Again I woke, and living men Stood round—a Christian crew; The first, the last, of joy was then, That since those days I knew. “I've been, I know, since that black tide, Where raving madmen lay, Above, beneath, on ev'ry side, And I as mad as they. “And I shall be where never dies The worm, nor slakes the flame, When those two hundred souls shall rise, The Judge's wrath to claim. “I'd rather rave in that wild room Than see what I have seen; I'd rather meet my final doom, Than be—where I have been. “Priest, I've not seen thy loathing face, I've heard thy gasps of fear;— Away—no word of hope or grace— I may not—will not hear!” THE TAKING OF TROY. CHORUS FROM THE TROADES OF EURIPIDES. A sad, unwonted song, O'er Ilion, Muse! prolong, Mingled with tears of woe, The funeral descant slow. I too, with shriek and frantic cry, Take up the dismal melody; How, lost through that strange four-wheel'd car, Stern Argos' captive chains we wear, What time the Greek, or ere he fled, Left at our gate the armed steed, Menacing the heavens with giant height, And all with golden housings bright. Shouted all the people loud, On the rock-built height that stood,— “Come,” they sang, and on they press'd,— “Come, from all our toils released, Lead the blest image to the shrine Of her, the Jove-born Trojan maid divine!” Lingered then what timorous maid? Nor age his tardy steps delay'd;— With gladsome shout, and jocund song, They drew their treacherous fate along! And all the Phrygian rout Through every gate rushed out. On the dangerous gift they lead, The beauty of th' unyoked, immortal steed, With its ambush'd warrior freight, Argos' pride and Ilion's fate. Round the stately horse, and round Cord and cable soon they wound; And drag it on, like pinnace dark Of some tall and stately bark, To the temple's marble floor, Soon to swim with Trojan gore. O'er the toil, the triumph, spread Silent night her curtained shade; But Lybian pipes still sweetly rang, And many a Phrygian air they sang; And maidens danced with airy feet, To the jocund measures sweet. And every house was blazing bright, As the glowing festal light Its rich and purple splendour streamed, Where the mantling wine-cup gleamed. But I, the while the palace-courts around, Hymning the mountain queen, Jove's virgin daughter, Went with blithe dance, and music's sprightly sound,— When, all at once, the frantic cry of slaughter All through the wide and startled city ran! The shudd'ring infants on their mothers' breasts Clung with their hands, and cowered within their vests. Forth stalk'd the mighty Mars, and the fell work began, The work of Pallas in her ire!— Then round each waning altar-fire, Wild Slaughter, drunk with Phrygian blood, And murtherous Desolation strewed, Where, on her couch of slumber laid, Was wont to rest the tender maid, To warrior Greece the crown of triumph gave, The last full anguish to the Phrygian slave! DEBORAH'S HYMN OF TRIUMPH. Thus sang Deborah and Barak, son of Abinoam, In the day of victory thus they sang: That Israel hath wrought her mighty vengeance, That the willing people rush'd to battle, Oh, therefore, praise Jehovah! Hear, ye kings! give ear, ye princes! I to Jehovah, I will lift the song, I will sound the harp to Jehovah, God of Israel! Jehovah! when thou wentest forth from Seir! When thou marchedst through the fields of Edom! Quaked the earth, and poured the heavens, Yea, the clouds poured down with water: Before Jehovah's face the mountains melted, That Sinai before Jehovah's face, The God of Israel. In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, In Jael's days, untrodden were the highways, Through the winding by-path stole the traveller; Upon the plains deserted lay the hamlets, Even till that I, till Deborah arose, Till I arose in Israel a mother. They chose new gods: War was in all their gates! Was buckler seen, or lance, 'Mong forty thousand sons of Israel? My soul is yours, ye chiefs of Israel! And ye, the self-devoted of the people, Praise ye the Lord with me! Ye that ride upon the snow-white asses; Ye that sit to judge on rich divans! Ye that plod on foot the open way, Come, meditate the song. For the noise of plundering archers by the wells of water, Now they meet and sing aloud Jehovah's righteous acts; His righteous acts the hamlets sing upon the open plains, And enter their deserted gates the people of Jehovah. Awake, Deborah! awake! Awake, uplift the song! Barak, awake, and lead thy captives captive, Thou son of Abinoam! With him a valiant few went down against the mighty, With me Jehovah's people went down against the strong. First Ephraim, from the Mount of Amalek, And after thee, the bands of Benjamin! From Machir came the rulers of the people, From Zebulon those that bear the marshal's staff; And Issachar's brave princes came with Deborah, Issachar, the strength of Barak: They burst into the valley on his footsteps. By Reuben's fountains there was deep debating— Why satt'st thou idle, Reuben, 'mid thy herd-stalls? Was it to hear the lowing of thy cattle? By Reuben's fountains there was deep debating— And Gilead lingered on the shores of Jordan— And Dan, why dwelled he among his ships?— And Asser dwelled in his sea-shore havens, And sate upon his rock precipitous. But Zebulon was a death-defying people, And Naphtali from off the mountain heights. Came the kings and fought, Fought the kings of Canaan, By Tannach, by Megiddo's waters, For the golden booty that they won not. From the heavens they fought 'gainst Sisera, In their courses fought the stars against him: The torrent Kishon swept them down, That ancient river Kishon. So trample thou, my soul, upon their might. Then stamp'd the clattering hoofs of prancing horses At the flight, at the flight of the mighty. Curse ye Meroz, saith the angel of the Lord, Curse, a twofold curse upon her dastard sons: For they came not to the succour of Jehovah, To the succour of Jehovah 'gainst the mighty. Above all women blest be Jael, Heber the Kenite's wife, O'er all the women blest, that dwell in tents. Water he ask'd—she gave him milk, The curded milk, in her costliest bowl. Her left hand to the nail she set, Her right hand to the workman's hammer— Then Sisera she smote—she clave his head; She bruised—she pierced his temples. At her feet he bow'd; he fell; he lay; At her feet he bow'd; he fell; Where he bow'd, there he fell dead. From the window she look'd forth, she cried, The mother of Sisera, through the lattice: “Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the wheels of his chariot?” Her prudent women answer'd her— Yea, she herself gave answer to herself— “Have they not seized, not shared the spoil? One damsel, or two damsels to each chief? To Sisera a many-coloured robe, A many-coloured robe, and richly broider'd, Many-colour'd, and broider'd round the neck.” Thus perish all thine enemies, Jehovah; And those who love thee, like the sun, shine forth, The sun in all its glory In the above translation an attempt is made to preserve something like a rhythmical flow. It adheres to the original language, excepting where an occasional word is, but rarely, inserted, for the sake of perspicuity. DOWNFALL OF JERUSALEM; FROM THE BOOK OF JEREMIAH. How solitary doth she sit, the many-peopled city! She is become a widow, the great among the Nations; The Queen among the provinces, how is she tributary! Weeping—weeps she all the night; the tears are on her cheeks; From among all her lovers, she hath no comforter; Her friends have all dealt treacherously; they are become her foes. —i. 1, 2. The ways of Sion mourn: none come up to her feasts, All her gates are desolate; and her Priests do sigh; Her virgins wail! herself, she is in bitterness.—i. 4. He hath pluck'd up his garden-hedge, He hath destroy'd his Temple; Jehovah hath forgotten made the solemn feast and Sabbath; And in the heat of ire He hath rejected King and Priest. The Lord his altar hath disdain'd, abhorred his Holy place, And to the adversary's hand given up his palace walls; Our foes shout in Jehovah's house, as on a festal day.ii. 7, 8. Her gates are sunk into the earth, he hath broke through her bars; Her Monarch and her Princes are now among the Heathen; The Law hath ceased; the Prophets find no vision from Jehovah.—ii. 10. My eyes do fail with tears; and troubled are my bowels; My heart's blood gushes on the earth, for the daughter of my people; Children and suckling babes lie swooning in the squares— They say unto their Mothers, where is corn and wine? They swoon as they were wounded, in the city squares; While glides the soul away into their Mother's bosom.ii. 11, 12. Even dragons, with their breasts drawn out, give suck unto their young; But cruel is my people's daughter, as the ostrich in the desert; The tongues of sucking infants to their palates cleave with thirst. Young children ask for bread, and no man breaks it for them; Those that fed on dainties are desolate in the streets; Those brought up in scarlet, even those embrace the dunghill.—iv. 3, 4, 5. Behold, Jehovah, think to whom thou e'er hast dealed thus! Have women ever eat their young, babes fondled in their hands? Have Priest and Prophet e'er been slain in the Lord's Holy place? In the streets, upon the ground, lie slain the young and old; My virgins and my youth have fallen by the sword; In thy wrath thou 'st slain them, thou hast had no mercy. Thou hast summon'd all my terrors, as to a solemn feast; None 'scaped, and none was left in Jehovah's day of wrath; All that mine arms have borne and nursed, the enemy hath slain.—ii. 20. 1, 2, Remember, Lord, what hath befallen, Look down on our reproach. Our heritage is given to strangers, Our home to foreigners. Our water have we drank for money, Our fuel hath its price.—v. 1, 2, 3. We stretch our hands to Egypt, To Assyria for our bread. At our life's risk we gain our food, From the sword of desert robbers. Our skins are like an oven, parched, By the fierce heat of famine. Matrons in Sion have they ravish'd, Virgins in Judah's cities. Princes were hung up by the hand, And age had no respect. Young men are grinding at the mill, Boys faint 'neath loads of wood. The Elders from the gate have ceased, The young men from their music. The crown is fallen from our head, Woe! woe! that we have sinn'd. 'Tis therefore that our hearts are faint, Therefore our eyes are dim. For Sion's mountain desolate, The foxes walk on it. END OF VOL. II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. STANZAS ON AN INCIDENT OBSERVED DURING THE FUNERAL OF THE DAUGHTER OF SIR WALTER SCOTT, THE WIFE OF MY FRIEND MR. LOCKHART. “Over that solemn pageant mute and dark, Where in the grave we laid to rest Heaven's latest, not least welcome guest, What didst thou on the wing, thou jocund lark! Hovering in unrebuked glee, And carolling above that mournful company? “O thou light-loving and melodious bird! At every sad and solemn fall Of mine own voice, each interval In the soul-elevating prayer, I heard Thy quivering descant full and clear— Discord not inharmonious to the ear! “We laid her there, the Minstrel's darling child. Seem'd it then meet that, borne away From the close city's dubious day, Her dirge should be thy native woodnote wild; Nursed upon nature's lap, her sleep Should be where birds may sing, and dewy flowerets weep? “Ascendedst thou, air-wandering messenger! Above us slowly lingering yet, To bear our deep, our mute regret; To waft upon thy faithful wing to her The husband's fondest, last farewell— Love's final parting pang, the unspoke, the unspeakable? “Or didst thou rather chide with thy blithe voice Our selfish grief, that would delay Her passage to a brighter day; Bidding us mourn no longer, but rejoice That it hath heavenward flown, like thee, That spirit from this cold world of sin and sorrow free? “I watched thee, lessening, lessening to the sight, Still faint and fainter winnowing The sunshine with thy dwindling wing; A speck, a movement in the ruffled light; Till thou wert melted in the sky, An undistinguish'd part of the bright infinity. “Meet emblem of that lightsome spirit thou! That still, wherever it might come, Shed sunshine o'er that happy home. Her task of kindliness and gladness now Absolved, with the element above Hath mingled, and become pure light, pure joy, pure love.” May 22, 1837. END OF VOL. III.</field>
