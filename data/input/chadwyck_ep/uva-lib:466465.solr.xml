      <field name="fulltext">THE BISHOP'S WALK AND THE BISHOP'S TIMES DEDICATION TO JOHN HUNTER, Esq. CRAIGCROOK My friend, I bring this little offering To thee, assured, how small soe'er its worth, That for the love which prompts me thou wilt love it, And with thy love wilt make it beautiful. How oft among thy flower-beds we have held Free converse, where the budding yellow rose, Prolific of its gifts the long year through, Breaks into beauty, or the myrtle rare With orient perfume scents the nimble breeze; Now in the Spring, when faint-sweet violets Peep with their dim eyes, coy, amid the leaves, Breathing forth raptures; in the Autumn now, When the red creeper flushes all the house, Save where the ivy clasps around the tower, Or trails, with wandering shoots, about the eaves And gargoyles grim, fantastic,—fearless homes Held by old swallows on a lease of love Unbroken, immemorial. And at times, When Summer rain pattered upon the leaves, In the green cloisters of the ivy-walk We mused, with ample range of large discourse;— Of science broadening from phenomena Diverse, to the great Unity which is God; Of forces correlate, forecasting dim Presages of a new philosophy; Of history made meaningless, alas! And lacking human interest, for lack Of its diviner import, waiting still The Epic soul. And ever with our speech Mingled the interval of silent thought, Not without reason, and the blithesome ring Of cheery laughter, which had reason too, And nimble wit and repartee, and apt Quotation from the poets who have sung Unchanging wisdom to a changeful world. Then, by and by, along the breezy heights And lichened crags orange and grey and brown, We strolled, where mountain ash and sombre pine Crest with their various plumage thy loved hill; Whence looking we could spy the far-off May Dim in the sea, the Lomonds' shadowy heights Crowning the winding shores of kingly Fife, North Berwick Law, the grey sea-withered scalp Of Bass (where the wild sea-mew wings amidst Heroic memories of a nation's sorrow Still haunting there), and nearer Arthur Seat Shouldering the dingy surge of mist and smoke From his great flanks, while the old Castle looms Darkly above the city roofs and spires, And pillared Calton veils amid the dusk His monumental forms, and at our feet Nestles among the chestnuts and the elms Jeffrey's green turret and thy happy home. So as we walked amid the beautiful, And shaped our speech about the beautiful In art or nature, evermore we found, Though years of ripened wisdom lay between us, And varied rich experience, rare agreement And vision eye to eye; like instruments Of diverse form and substance which record An unexpected harmony, each to other Filling the chord, to make a perfect strain. And when the Winter early closed the day, And the log crackled, and the lamp was lit, And the long wind howled through the groaning trees, And the great arm-chair to the fireside drawn Allured to mild repose, which yet the glass Of golden sack, or generous claret purpling The quaint old flask of Venice-work, forbade To become vacant idleness; then we Held high discourse of God and Destiny, And the dear Christ of human love and hope Gathering the weary wandering ages round The throne which was a cross, and conquering By His meek passion; till Theology Stript off its sorrowful garb again, and grew An impotent scholastic. Or at times We talked of those whose songs had charmed our youth; Who of them were forgot, and who were still Daily companions, faring on the road With us, and with a deeper meaning speaking Unto our deepening wants: Of Wordsworth doing A tuneful ministry of love to all God's common creatures, till the hedgerows sung With choiring seraphim at cottage doors; Of Coleridge dreaming, and discoursing words Mystic and musical—formative fire-mist Luminous, with a star or two in it, Deeper in heaven than any star we know, And sweeping over vaster breadths of space: Of Keats, whose senses were a kind of soul, Living at every point of his fine frame, And clothing subtlest thought in imagery Tinted and perfumed and melodious: Of Shelley, with the skylark singing, soaring, And now in cloud invisible, and now Without a cloud invisible, but still Throbbing with passionate music, when the sense Gurgled but half articulate: Of Hunt, Playing with lambent lightnings innocent About life's surface, cheerily singing, genial And very human, and yet now and then Unconscious, childlike, lifting up the veil, And glancing at the holiest with wonder— Soon lost among the pictures and the pathos Of our familiar life: of Tennyson, Dropping so calmly down a quiet stream— A witchèd river, yet an English stream— 'Mong the broad lilies, and the whispering sedges, Musing and singing, noting thoughtfully The passionate throbbings of a troubled heart, And passionate struggles of a wondrous age. These all we canvassed, having sympathies With all. Nor lacked discourse of nobler still— Of people's Epic, and the learned muse Of Milton; of the tragic sock, and eke Of tragic symbol, tracking through the maze Of sorrow and temptation the footprints Mingled of God and man. So Goethe sang His Faust; and so in Runic strain, unmeasured, Guttural, yet with rarest tones of beauty, Wailing the broken idols and the shrines Even while he hurls them down, our modern Titan Essays his vision of life's mystery. Thus having shared thy fellowship, and heard Manifold wisdom, truth profound, and pure Utterance of taste; which I delightedly Recall and treasure, and delightedly Look forward to, making a threefold joy Of hope and memory and present gladness, I, grateful, bring mine offering to thee, Assured thy love will scan it lovingly. THE BISHOP'S WALK PART I THE CATHEDRAL TOWN 1 A gray old Minster on the height Towers o'er the trees and in the light; A gray old town along the ridge Slopes, winding downward to the bridge— A quaint, old, gabled place, With Church writ on its face. 2 The quiet Close, secluded, dim, The lettered scroll, the pillar slim, The armorial bearings on the wall, The very air you breathe, are all Full of Church memories, And the old sanctities. 3 And beautiful the gray old place With characters of antique grace, That tell the tale of pious work Beneath the spire and round the kirk, And growth of Law and Right Where Christ had come with light. 4 Begrimed with smoke, a monotone Of equal streets in brick or stone, With squalid lane, and flaunting Hall, Infrequent spire, and chimneys tall;— You know the place wherein The weary toil and spin. 5 With jalousie and portico, And oriel large, where sea-winds blow, And light parade, and ample streets, Where idler with the idler meets;— You know the haunt of pleasure, Or sick resort of leisure. 6 Far otherwise the old church town, With the gray minster for its crown: Its tide of work has ebbed away; Its pleasuring was never gay; Yet there the morning broke, And the new world awoke. 7 And it is well, amid the whir Of restless wheels and busy stir, To find a quiet spot where live Fond pious thoughts conservative, That ring to an old chime, And bear the moss of time. 8 Like ivy clasping ruin gray, And greenly clothing its decay; Like garden haunted to this hour With smell of some old-fashioned flower; So sweet the dim old town Still with its minster crown. 9 There is a strange philosophy Among the wondrous things that be: Even that the path which man has trod Progresses still away from God, And that we flourish most As piety is lost; 10 As sacred turns to secular, As worship wanes, and temples are Unvisited and voiceless grown, And only rigid law is known: Even so, they say, do we Work out our destiny. 11 Alas! and must the deep, divine Impress of God, and the grand line Of our high parentage be lost, To reach the meagre winning-post Of modern social saw, Or hard mechanic law? 12 Nay, but in this quaint place I see The nobler thought of history; The birth of civil right and peace, And progress that shall never cease, Amid the chaunt and hymn In cloistered alley dim. 13 And sweeter far and grander too The ancient civilisation grew, With holy war and busy work Beneath the spire and round the kirk, Than miles of brick and stone In godless monotone. 14 For here, in wild and lawless days, The Culdee waked a song of praise For Gospel light and liberty, And help of man's great misery; And Darkness from its throne Fled at the Cross alone. 15 So was it then—so is it now, And will for ever be, I trow: The only spell of might is He, The watchword and the victory; And thou shalt suffer loss, But conquer in the Cross. 16 Back rolls the Darkness, as they come, The victor griefs of Christendom; Omnipotent sorrows only heal The evils of the commonweal; And dim and ever dimmer All other lights shall glimmer. 17 The good monk had his working day, The good priest also passed away, The mitre faded, and the crook, And chaunted hymn, and lettered book; But in this quiet place They left a natural grace. 18 A quaint old place—a minster gray, And gray old town that winds away, Through gardens, down the sloping ridge To river's brim and ancient bridge, Where the still waters flow To the deep pool below. PART II THE WALK 19 Where looks the western window far Unto the liquid evening star, And can Benledi dimly view, And the gray mists on Benvenue, And long brown uplands, felt In distant air to melt; 20 There where the green ash interweaves Irregular branch and slender leaves, For umbrage soft—a pale green shade With broken sunlights in the glade, There lies a pleasant way In gloaming all the day. 21 And far below the waters clear Murmur their presence on the ear, Scarce seen for dipping boughs that seek The light, or only when a streak Of sunshine cometh home Upon the crisp white foam. 22 A pleasant walk, when singing bird, Upon the bending twig is heard, And rustling leaf that bids you hush! And hear the slow still waters gush Incessant and unseen, Beneath the branches green. 23 A pleasant path at noonday bright, With arching boughs to screen the light; A pleasant walk at close of day, With red lights glancing on the way, And golden showers that fall On the old churchyard wall. 24 Here swell the Ochils green; and there The Cromlex heaths are brown and bare; Benledi and Benlomond far Front the rude crags of U-am-var; And by the shady way Still towers the minster gray. 25 The many-pillared western gate With rounded arch elaborate, But weather-worn, you partly see:— A net-work of fine tracery; A cunning antique lace Draping a vacant space. 26 And high above the churchyard wall Springs the light western window tall, And be it window, be it niche, An almond form with carving rich, Set on the gable high, Looks like a watchful eye. 27 And in the roofless nave you see Lofty light-pillared gallery In vista long, and windows still Of lances clasped with simple skill, And fern and lichen doing Their work of graceful ruin. 28 Nor gargoyle lacks, grotesque and quaint, Nor saintly niche without its saint, Nor buttress lightsome, nor the tower Where the bell marks the passing hour, And peals out with our mirth, And tolls our earth to earth. 29 And o'er the dim old centuries The minster bridges, unto these Dull times of toil and commonplace, From days of chivalry and grace, Spanning the vague abyss With memories of bliss. 30 Oft Leighton's subtle fancy sped Far back unto its youth, and read, In sculptured forms and texts and rhymes, The secret of the ancient times, And their divinest sense Of mystic reverence. 31 And in its Cross the Christ he saw; And in its pillars stedfast law; Its dim light bade with awe admire; And thought soared heavenward on the spire, Urged onwards by the chime That told the fleeting time. PART III THE BISHOP 32 Two hundred years have come and gone, Since that fine spirit mused alone On the dim walk, with faint green shade By the light-quivering ash-leaves made, And saw the sun go down Beyond the mountains brown. 33 Slow-pacing, with a lowly look, Or gazing on the lettered book Of Tauler, or a-Kempis, or Meek Herbert with his dulcimer, In quaintly pious vein Rehearsing a deep strain: 34 Or in the Gold-mouthed Greek he read High rhetoric, or what was said Of Augustine's experience, Or of the Gospel's grand defence Before assembled lords, In Luther's battle-words. 35 Slowly-pacing, with a downcast eye, Which yet, in rapt devotion high, Sometimes its great dark orb would lift, And pierced the veil, and caught the swift Glance of an angel's wing, Where of the Lamb they sing; 36 And with the fine pale shadow, wrought Upon his cheek by years of thought, And lines of weariness and strain, That told of o'ertaxed heart and brain; So went he to and fro With step infirm and slow. 37 A frail, slight form—no temple he, Grand, for abode of Deity; Rather a bush, inflamed with grace, And trembling in a desert place, And unconsumed with fire, Though burning high and higher: 38 A frail, slight form, and pale with care, Made paler by the raven hair That folded from a forehead free, Godlike of breadth and majesty— A brow of thought supreme And mystic glorious dream. 39 And over all that noble face Lay somewhat of meek pensiveness In a fine haze of subtle thought, That seemed to waver light, and float This way and that way still, With no firm bent of will. 40 God made him beautiful, to be Drawn to all beauty tenderly, And conscious of all beauty, whether In things of earth or heaven or neither; So to rude men he seemed Often as one that dreamed. 41 But true it was that, in his soul, The needle pointed to the pole, Yet trembled as it pointed, still Touched with an awe unspeakable, As it turned for the light Unto the Infinite. 42 Beautiful spirit! fallen on days When little was to love or praise; Still seeking peace amid the strife, Still working, weary of thy life, Toiling in holy love, Panting for heaven above: 43 I mark thee, in an evil day, Alone upon a lonely way; More sad-companionless thy fate, Thy life more truly desolate, Than even the misty glen Of persecuted men. 44 For none so lone on earth as he Whose way of thought is high and free, Beyond the mist, beyond the cloud, Beyond the clamour of the crowd, Moving, where Jesus trod, In the lone walk with God. PART IV THE MEDITATION 45 So musing on the dim green way, Beside the minster old and gray, Beside the river murmuring slow Far down the dipping boughs below, As sunk the evening sun Amid the shadows dun; 46 So musing to and fro he went, Dreaming of law and government, And civil broil, and discontent That struggled to have scope and vent, And of a nation sick Of crafty politick. 47 “Alas!” he said, “an evil time, When seeking truth is civil crime, And God's anointed goes in quest Of foolish mirth and ribald jest; And the high task of rule Falls or to knave or fool. 48 “A king that only cares for pleasure, A court that dances to his measure, A policy of passing shifts, A parliament that, thoughtless, drifts With any tide to-day On any evil way! 49 “And strange, alas! the work they plan; For, without faith in God or man, In human worth, or truth divine, Or holy priest, or sacred shrine, Or aught the wise revere, Or aught the lowly fear, 50 “They care not for thy kirk, O Lord, They reck not of thy blessed Word, Alike the mitre and the rood, Alike to them the cap and hood, Their only wish on earth To skim its froth of mirth: 51 “And yet they persecute and slay For mere opinion day by day; As if they had a zeal for truth That stilled the pitiful voice of ruth, And bade them quench in death The enemies of faith. 52 “Ay me! ay me! I cannot tell How on such hapless times I fell, That they should cloak the wrong they do With my poor name, and call it too A work for God, a work For Christ and holy kirk. 53 “The wolf is ravening in the fold, The robber prowling there for gold, The wheat is trampled for the tares, The vineyard sown with hates and cares, Nor prayer nor psalm is heard, Nor ever healing word. 54 “The trooper with the curate swears, The curate calls it troopers' prayers, And subtle craft and cruel deed Sow broadcast o'er the land a seed That shall be reaped in sorrow On many a dark to-morrow. 55 “And God's dear saints, alas! are dead, Or to the misty moorlands fled, Or, with oppression mad, they come To battle with the trump and drum, Soon trampled by the force Of the rider and his horse. 56 “And all for what? alas, the while! Those deal in wrath, and hate, and guile, And these to madness yield them, all For forms ecclesiastical; And for the seed of grace We but the husk embrace. 57 “Ay me! ay me! I seem to see An angry God look down on me; The fleece is dewy on the hills; But dry and dewless now all else; Nor reverence, nor fear, Nor touch of grace is here. 58 “O weary time! O dreary age Of mine unhappy pilgrimage! A nation brooding discontent, And Christ's fair garment soiled and rent, A king in folly sunk, His lords in madness drunk! 59 “And I—alas! I was not meant For tasks of crafty government To moderate the angry stir Of troubled kirk and presbyter, And settle wordy jars Of harsh polemic wars. 60 “I have no gift that way; I think At good men's errors I would wink; A good man's foible should be borne: Yet shall I get but double scorn From those the wrong that do, And those that suffer too. 61 “Yet that were light, if I might serve The blessèd Christ, and never swerve; Nor do I grudge the sacrifice Of all that I esteem of price To do Thy will, O Lord, According to Thy Word. 62 “I care not for the weary care, I heed not of the hate I share, I would not murmur or complain At cruel wrong or bitter pain; For thou, O Lamb of God, This way Thyself hast trod. 63 “But Lord, I pray Thee, send Thou him Whom Thou wilt send; mine eyes are dim For lack of faith and hope: and see Thy work will suffer now in me; For I am all alone, Trusted and loved by none. 64 “Alone, like one untimely born, And wandering through his age forlorn, Too early he, or else too late, His heritage a common hate, By no one understood, And impotent for good. 65 “The men I love my way deplore; The men I loathe do hate me more; With whom I live I have no ties; With whom I left, sad memories; With none have I the power To help this evil hour. 66 “And doubtless all the blame is mine; Yet, Lord, let not the scaith be Thine; They love me not; and yet for them This dark and troubled tide I stem; And I could almost be Accursed for them and Thee. 67 “O weary heart! O hapless fate! O evil times of strife and hate! The raven finds a carcass there To settle on, but in the air The sad dove flutters, fain To seek the ark again. 68 “Lord, take me hence; what profit I In this great flood of misery? I am but tempted to repine At mine own doings, Lord, and Thine; I have no heart to live, Having no help to give. 69 “For lo! I have no power to heal The evils of the commonweal; I was beguiled to be the tool Of those who now hold sway and rule In this distracted land, They nowise understand. 70 “And now the people trust me not; How could they, when these rulers plot To crush their freedom, and discrown The only King the Church may own As Lord of conscience here, Whose right is sure and clear? 71 “This people will not be constrained Except by truth and love unfeigned; But give them doctrine undefiled, And you may lead them like a child That holds its father's hand, And feels that life is grand. 72 “I know them and their noble deeds, Which still are more than all their creeds; I know their patience to endure The evils which they may not cure, While they may go their way, And sing their psalms and pray. 73 “Set up for them a lofty aim, And they will put your soul to shame, By readiness to pay the price In suffering and sacrifice, That they the Lord may serve, Nor from His Law may swerve. 74 “I know them, but they know not me, And love them, but they will not see How I do yearn to do them good, And ponder on their wrongs and brood, Although my way is not Along their line of thought. 75 “I heed not much of forms; I thought 'Twere well indeed if we were brought From our lax ways and hot debate, To primitive episcopate, And prayers lisped of old By infants in the fold. 76 “Yet reck I not of forms; though well I know the pearl gives to the shell Some beauty and virtue like its own, And shining hue and gorgeous tone; And the old forms to me Gleam with old sanctity. 77 “Yet what boot they? And what boots all Our garb ecclesiastical, The white-stoled priest, the altar high, If we do err from charity? O God, that reigns above, Knit us with cords of love. 78 “I think there was a Church of Christ, That this poor earth of ours rejoiced, Ere Luther championed the high truth, Or Calvin taught our eager youth To leave the ancient ways, Our guides in former days. 79 “Perhaps I err; but such a break With the old faith I could not make— Such prayers I thought the saints had breathed, Such hymns apostles had bequeathed, Such customs spake to me Of Christ in Bethany. 80 “What, if the ages could espy More truth than either you or I? What, if their wants discovered gold, And treasures rare and manifold, Which do not often fall To mere art logical? 81 “We are not single; age with age Is linked; and truth's high heritage Is the slow fruit of bended knees Through the long growth of centuries; Nor is it yet complete, Nor yet all counterfeit. 82 “Oh, I would purge the holy kirk Of pagan form, and heathen work, And idol carved, and idol hymn, And also Hebrew Teraphim, Which tinge our thoughts, I fear, More than doth well appear. 83 “Yet would I leave the altar high, And the old chaunted melody, The symbol cross above the wall, The angel-crownèd capital, And Bishop minister To faithful presbyter. 84 “There surely was a Church of old, With pious customs manifold, That ruled the savage in the wild, And brought him to the Lord a child And reared the structure high, Of noblest chivalry. 85 “Christ was not buried in the tomb All those long centuries of gloom; Nor did the ages drift ashore Only loose waifs upon the hoar Old billows, as they chime God's doings through all time. 86 “Yet oh, I love not man's device Of policy and statecraft nice; Nor would I plant what I love most, Christ's very Gospel, at the cost Of hate and blood which we Bequeath to history. 87 “And I had been content to try What Christ's flock wished for. What care I For priest or presbyter, or lawn And mitre? I am nowise drawn By words and names and shows, But what they do enclose. 88 “But men of crafty policy, That neither love the land nor me, Nor God, nor Christ, nor prayer, nor praise, Have dragged me on their evil ways, And torn my heart from them That love Jerusalem. 89 “Ay me! ay me! that I should be The tool of this great perjury, For Lauderdale and Middleton And Sharpe to wreak their fury on The pasture-sheep of Christ, Inveigled and enticed! 90 “Oh that I were in still Douay, Among the quiet priests that pray In chapel low or chancel dim, Chaunting the plain-song or the hymn, Perchance the ‘Stabat Mater,’ perchance ‘Veni Creator.’ 91 “I may not bind me with their creed, Though some of them are free indeed, Or only thrall to heaven above; And oh they bind me by their love Of Him whose name on earth Is ointment pourèd forth. 92 “Nor can I say but vesper hymn, Low-chaunted in the chapel dim, Sounds to me as an infant's voice When Faith is young, and doth rejoice, And goeth all day long Singing a quiet song:— 93 “A voice that lingers on mine ear From bride, whose Bridegroom still is near; In her mysterious mirthfulness, And trembling joy, and wondering grace, A tender music sighing Upon his bosom lying. 94 “But yet they wrong me much who say That I have erred, and gone astray From Christ, the Way, the Truth, the Life, Because I shrink from civil strife, And schoolmen's quirks, and faint Cobwebs of argument. 95 “I love the kirk, with ages hoar; I love old ways, but Christ far more; I love the fold, I love the flock, But more my Shepherd and my Rock, And the great Book of grace That mirrors His dear face. 96 “O sweet the story and the psalm, And prophecy is healing balm, Like virgin-comb apostle's lips, Like Heaven the grand Apocalypse; But sweet above all other, His words, our Saviour-Brother. 97 “Once my soul wandered; for I lent Mine ears to faithless argument. Yet not my heart erred, but my head, For still my fainting spirit bled To think that, day by day, God seemed to fade away. 98 “I fain had clung to Thee, O Lord; I fain had kept Thy holy Word; I did not seek to 'scape from Thee, But Thou didst fade away from me; And all Thy glory seemed A dream which men had dreamed. 99 Dark thoughts were these—a weary time; Father, impute it not for crime, That in his fever Thy poor child Raved wildly in his fancies wild; For still I found no rest Save lying on Thy breast. 100 “Ay me! ay me! would I might be In old Ulshaven by the sea, To dream beside the dreamy wave, And choose me out a quiet grave, Where the long ocean chime Tells the slow march of time. 101 “O just to seat me by the tide Of life, and see its galleys glide, With every sail on every yard, And speculate their whitherward Upon the shoreless sea, Dim with man's destiny! 102 “To stand apart, and set my heart Alone upon the better part, And hear far off the idle din Of evil tongues and bruit of sin, And soar to Thee, O Lord, High on Thy holy Word! 103 “I was not meant for action; I Like wind-harp in the window sigh, When breath of Heaven is passing by; But from a ruder finger fly The long-drawn notes, and fall Harsh and unmusical. 104 “Lord, place me where Thy breath may be Tremulous all day long on me; So shalt Thou get my little worth, So shall my use be to the earth; For this is all of me— A voice that cries to Thee. 105 I have no fight in me to stay The rush and wrestle of the fray: My father would have battle done, And braved all, were he only one Against an host, but then He was a king of men.— 106 A warrior stout to hold the field With loving words for sword and shield, A Ruler, too, with resolute soul The people's humours to control; But none of these did he Bequeath to strengthen me. 107 I have no help for this poor life Of controversial storm and strife, Nor skill to order the debate, So long maintained, of Church and State, I can but think and pray As I hold on my way. 108 What, if some men were never meant To serve their day, but be content Some day somewhere, when life is past, To have their use found out at last, And fruitful branches wave Above the quiet grave. PART V THE INCIDENT 109 Thus musing to and fro he went, Dreaming of kirk and government; While cawing rooks were homeward winging, And bird on leafy bough was singing, And Allan far below Was rippling soft and slow; 110 And kine stood listless in the stream Where the red lights of evening gleam, And whispering winds were tripping free Down the high pillared gallery, Or sighing as they pass Over the churchyard grass. 111 Still was the hour—the evening still: Peace slumbered on the distant hill; Peace, dreaming, smiled upon the cloud; And earth seemed whispering Peace! aloud, When any voice awoke And that deep silence broke. 112 And in the calm of such an hour Old memories have a witching power, Old times come back, old faces look Up to us from the unread book; The very grave seems made To yield us back our dead. 113 So dreaming, there appeared to rise A certain form before his eyes, Personal, real; and yet he knew 'Twas but the mind's fine shadow grew From dimness into clearness, With a strange sense of nearness. 114 They had been friends, when friend-ship is A passion and a blessedness; And in a tender sacrament Unto the house of God they went, And plighted love, caressing The same dear cup of blessing. 115 Their busy day was a delight; Nor less the thoughtful studious night, With high discourse, and large debate, Unmixed by bitterness or hate— Their fellowship I ween, A pleasant thing had been. 116 He in Dalkeith, a guide of men, And he in near Newbattle then Pastured the flock of Christ; and they Like children had made holiday, In old light-hearted times, Under the elms and limes. 117 But parted by unhappy fate In sorrow deep, disconsolate, One got the mitre—one the rod Of persecution for his God; And both had suffered loss, Bearing a separate cross. 118 Alas! if you look back and see Friendship's old picture-gallery, Where some are gone, and some are changed, And some embittered and estranged, And some you wronged, perchance, Upbraid you with a glance, 119 A sadder strain you shall not find In all the measures of the mind, Than these remembered faces wake, When, silent as the falling flake, Ghostly and pale and dumb, In twilight dim they come. 120 O bitter grief! O vain regret! O ye, if ye were living yet! O foolish youth, and cursèd pride, That kept me from a brother's side! What is there of such price Worth so great sacrifice? 121 Seemed now at hand that friend of youth, Who had loved God, and man, and truth— He knew it but an empty shade, An image which the mind had made; Yet shook with hope and fear, As if he might be near. 122 Then said the Bishop? “Where is he? In lettered Utrecht by the sea? Among the wilds of Annandale? Or where the Mayflower dropt her sail, And dusky savage flew Past in his light canoe? 123 “No man of blood, or craft, or trick Of cunning art and politic, Or hare-brained dreamer fancy-sick, But full of thought, and calm and meek, A man of men wert thou Of the great eye and brow. 124 “And where art thou? we need thee still: Thine own folk need thee on the hill For counsel and courage to meet their fate; And thou art needed in the state— Oh for but one like thee To guide our destiny. 125 “But woe's me! such as you are driven To loathe the earth and long for heaven; And well for you, aspiring thus; But ill for our poor world and us; Without the salt we rot, Alas! and heed it not.” 126 Even as he spoke, one straggled through The wild-rose white with blossoms new, With tottering step, and panting breath, And on his face the brand of death, Pallid and pinched and dim; And stood confronting him. 127 They gazed a moment face to face; He tall and with a stately grace; A thin gray man, with thin gray hair, And worn with hunger, grief, and care; And the good Bishop shook, As his lean hand he took. 128 “My brother! O my brother!” More He could not; but the stranger wore A gentle smile upon his face That softened with a tender grace, As the old years of love Bent, beaming from above. 129 “I came to seek thee in my need, Robert, as to a friend indeed; And come too late; yet that is well For me, I think; for who can tell What a weak heart may do For life, and live to rue? 130 “For days I have been hunted still, From heath to heath, from hill to hill, No time to sleep, no time to eat, No pause for my unresting feet, And weary now and faint, My feeble life is spent. 131 “Yet if I might have chosen where My death should hap, it had been there, Where thou could'st speed me on my flight, And trim my lamp for gathering night; Though I have wished to be A twilight hour with thee. 132 “No matter—all is well; thou art Still mine old friend, still in my heart; My journey ended, home is near; And, as we part, the lights appear, Flashing from sapphire floor Through heaven's open door. 133 “And grieve not, Robert; would'st thou weep To see the sick child drop asleep, Hushed on a mother's loving breast, And gently sobbing into rest; Now from all sorrow free, Pain and anxiety? 134 “And all is well; and we are well; And thou wilt toll the passing bell For a poor brother, who hath run A sorry race that now is done, And with thine own hands lay Me gently in the clay. 135 “That was our covenant; for you Promised beneath the dark old yew, Whose branches o'er my Mary wave, Whose shadow sweeps my children's grave, That dying before thee There thou would'st bury me. 136 “And, Robert, hear me ere I die; I know thy clear sincerity, Thine old love of the old Church ways, And the old ritual of praise, And that thy fancy still Dwelt pure amid the ill. 137 “I never doubted thee; when some Would have it thou wert almost come, In feebleness and false compliance, To seek with Rome a base alliance, I held their words but light, Knowing thy heart was right. 138 “Yet, Robert, hear me ere I die; The mitre sits uneasily Upon a lowly head like thine, Betrinketing a gift divine; And there is blood below Its vain and empty show. 139 “Think, brother, of the crimes they do, And consecrate them all with you; Think of this poor afflicted realm, And all the sorrows that o'erwhelm The Lord's belovèd sons, His dear redeemèd ones. 140 “You love the old Church primitive, In the old manner you would live, But yet I know that Christ is more To you than all your learned lore; Ah! be not joined with them That harm Jerusalem. 141 “Now speak to me; and speed me on; The night grows dark; I've been alone For weeks among the moorlands bare, Yet not alone, for Christ was there; Eerie they were and sad, But yet He made them glad. 142 “How dark it grows! Is Robert here? No matter, Lord, if thou art near; And yet I wist that he would say A kind word, ere I passed away, A word on which to die With a great hope peacefully. 143 “He used to go down with a soul Into the valley of death and dole Farther than any I ever knew; A convoy great and precious to Full many a troubled heart Sad from the earth to part. 144 “But, Lord, I think that I have fought A good fight, and Thou wilt allot To me, a frail yet faithful child, A crown unfading, undefiled, And that Thy dear ‘well-done’ Waits me beyond the sun.” 145 Thus wandering, but right-hearted, he Sank on his friend, and peacefully Gave up his spirit unto God, His body to the earth it trod; Each turning to its source When it had run its course. 146 And as he died, across his face, That beamed with such a tender grace, There passed a look of quiet, quaint, And subtle humour, all too faint For any but an eye Familiar, to espy. 147 But Leighton knew it long ago; And as he watched it flickering low, Lightening the eyes as they grew dim, It rent the very heart of him, To see that smile so quaint Gleam from the dying saint. 148 As one that, in a lumber-room, Cobwebbed, and left in dingy gloom, Comes on a battered baby-doll, With bitter anguish to his soul, (For we from pleasures borrow The pathos of our sorrow), 149 So Leighton, as he watched the smile Play on the dying lips a while: Old times came back, old humours gave A deeper pathos to the grave, A keener edge to grief That now found no relief. 150 Never again, oh never more Shall they hold speech of learned lore, And saintly hymn, and pious work, And hallowed love of holy kirk, And duty to be done As these last ages run; 151 Never again, oh never more Together shall their thoughts explore Far-reaching wisdom, deep, divine, Hid in some mystic word or line, Nor probe the hidden part Of man's deceitful heart; 152 Never again, oh never more Shall taste the joys they knew of yore, The fellowship of love and truth, The gaiety of hopeful youth, The glory of the time That made their life sublime. PART VI BESIDE THE DEAD 153 Then cried the Bishop, kneeling by The dead, as if himself would die, In broken tones of wrath and grief That struggled to obtain relief, And if they found not vent Had burst their tenement:— 154 “O God—my God and his—how long? When shall this sorrow cease and wrong? O pitiful Christ, who lovest all, Hope of the hopeless, shall we call Upon Thy name in vain To ease our cruel pain? 155 “Unhappy country! thou art left This day to mourn as one bereft Of wisdom, counsel, courage here, And antique faith, and lowly fear, And skill to guide the way In wild distracted day. 156 “Good men have fallen on either side— The Great Montrose in haughty pride, Keen Warriston, and deep Argyle, And Napier, sagest of our isle; And since the great are dead, Small men are great instead. 157 “But thou, my friend, wert brave and true, And had'st the scope of things in view; Equal to greatest times, and still Full of their good, free from their ill; Too good for faction, yet Driven to have part in it. 158 “In troubled times of kirk or state, Hurrying on change precipitate, God sent the peoples heretofore Of great and good men ample store, And still the wasteful strife Was charged with noble life. 159 “But we are fallen on days of dearth Of generous mind and manly worth; O all is little, mean, and-bad, And growing dark and waste and sad; For thriftless too are we In our great poverty. 160 “There is no one to whom the eye Of all the land turns hopefully; But little men, with little shift, Do let the groaning kingdom drift, Through fickle change and chance, To insignificance. 161 “A noble land, once nobly led, By them who God's deep counsel read, Along a path of wisdom high And blended law and liberty; But now become a scorn, And helpless and forlorn! 162 “O Christ, to the oppressèd dear, Who in Thy bottle every tear, And every drop of blood and sweat, And every scorn, and word of hate, Keepest for evermore, Numbering o'er and o'er; 163 “O Thou who sittest on the throne, I know Thou wilt avenge Thine own; Thou seest not as mortals see, Thou lovest them that trust in Thee, And Thou wilt yet befriend Thy people and defend. 164 “But we have built a Babel tower, Presumptuous, in an evil hour; Sorry foundation we have laid, Who in the blood of saints have made Altar, and priest, and shrine, Hateful, O Lord, to Thine. 165 “A few short years—a fewdark days— Whose wrath shall yet work out Thy praise, And all our glory in the dust Shall crumble, Lord, for Thou art just: Who build upon the sand Their fall is near at hand. 166 “But Thou upon Thy people look, Whose names are written in Thy Book, And who are standing in Thy sight Robed in the garments clean and white,— And for salvation come To Thy vexed Christendom! 167 “O King of glory—Lord of might, Who hatest ill, and lovest right, Although Thy ways in darkness be And strangeness and perplexity, Hear from the depths our cry, Shine forth in majesty; 168 “And look upon this land of ours, And save it from unhallowed powers Of darkness, that enthronèd be, And stablish foul iniquity, Yet call it law divine, And holy will of Thine. 169 “Oh, hear the fainting voice that cries From earth, afflicted, to the skies; Helpless, the cause is now appealed From desolate home and stricken field To Thee, the Lord of might, And Judge who doest right. 170 “Surely for some great destiny This ancient land was led by Thee, Through foreign war and civil strife, To such a pitch of noble life, With freedom for its crown, And genius and renown. 171 “And thou, brave soldier of thy Lord, Sleep in the peace of his sure Word, Sleep, for thy works have gone before, Sleep on, but not for evermore; For thou hast vanquished death In victory of faith. 172 “Oh might I only go with thee! I'm weary of this misery, I'm weary of a hopeless task, I'm weary of their pious mask, That hides the deed of shame With Christ's beloved name. 173 “To see the arts of government And law unto oppression bent, And lies, and cruelties, and slights, Breed treason unto human rights, And mockery of Him Between the cherubim! 174 “Lord, take me hence, if it may be, Away from this, away to Thee; Where, in exulting angel strain, He now forgets all grief and pain, Lost in the love of Thee, To all eternity.” PART VII THE CONCLUSION 175 Slow tolled the bell its mournful knell, As earth and stone on coffin fell— Still tolling slowly, while, meek and lowly, He read for the dead the scriptures holy, Where the dark yew sadly waves Over the household graves. 176 “Earth to earth, and dust to dust, We yield in certain hope and trust; Who sleep in Jesus—only sleep, Who sow corruption yet shall reap Pure incorruption, tried, Refined and glorified. 177 “Cometh ere long the trump of doom To dust and darkness of the tomb; Cometh the judgment, and the throne White, exalted; and thereon Sits the Lamb that died, For sinners crucified.” 178 Mellow and low the words were spoken, With falling tear and accents broken, For with the hope the sorrow strove, And sad sweet memories of love; As earth on coffin fell, And on his heart as well. 179 In old Newbattle 'mong the limes, Where they had walked in happier times, There now the friend of youth he laid Beside his loved ones, by his dead; Then turned him to the strife And weary task of life. 180 “Too long,” he said, “have I, too long, Witnessed oppression, grieved for wrong, And played the coward to the truth, Even seeming false to human ruth, Although my heart was burning, And pity in me yearning: 181 “I have indulged me with the thought Of peace on earth, when peace was not, And made a dreamland for my soul, Where God's stern law held no control, Of fact or duty till Earth groaned with growing ill. 182 “Forgive me, Lord; Thou gavest me A warfare to be fought for Thee, And I the conflict high declined For vagrant fancies of the mind, And mine appointed lot Neglected and forgot. 183 “Vain wisdom his—presumptuous sense, Who will not take from Providence The cup it mingles, but will go In sparks of his own kindling. Lo! The mighty age sweeps on; He eddies there alone. 184 “May no man leave the solid earth, And call his dream a thing of worth; May no man lightly turn away From strife or sorrow of his day:— The godlike is to do What God has laid to you. 185 “We have an hour allotted thus; We have a task appointed us; Nor culture of the mind and heart Shall be the Christian's only part; But he shall bend his will To present duty still. 186 “In life of others we do live, And joy in all the joy we give; If mine own soul alone I cherish, My soul shall in my brother perish; Living, alas! I die; But dying live thereby. 187 “So let me gird my loins with prayer, And for the weary task prepare; Nor falter, irksome though it be, Nor do the right despondingly: I did not take the mitre To make my labour lighter. 188 “Yea, I will hope, O Lord, in Thee That faithful work shall fruitful be: Tears, bitter tears, may fall like rain, And shower upon the earth in vain; But the true work is never A profitless endeavour. 189 “Perchance the fruit is not to-day, For the quick growth hath quick decay; But we shall sow and others reap, And they shall joy though we did weep; Yet in the harvest shall Be gladness unto all. 190 “Then, what if my small seed should be Reaped in another century, And understood, and loved by them Who then, in our Jerusalem, Shall peacefully combine To love the life divine? 191 “What if my little light now lost In our wild turmoil, tempest-tossed, Should gleam upon another age, And beacon, on their pilgrimage Of hope and blessing, some Who unto Christ would come? 192 “What if the shadow I project Upon the clouds that now deject Our weary times, seen far away By kindlier eyes some distant day, Should lead them to be just When I am in the dust? 193 “Or what, if, to rebuke my vain And foolish thoughts, the Lord maintain Nothing of all I do or say, But sweep the structure all away, And me and my poor fate Wisely obliterate? 194 “Oh what am I, or aught I've done, That I should 'scape oblivion? That Death, when he dissolves this frame, Should spare my shadow and my name? Lord, as the ages run, Still let Thy will be done. 195 “We would be something who are nought; And if we work where Thou hast wrought, The hodmen of Thy temple, we Would hand our name to history, With the great architect Who did it all erect. 196 “O proud ambition to be known! Envious that he should be alone. Still on our little self we brood, Still boastful of our little good, Still panting for a name On crumbling niche of fame. 197 “Work all intent, while work ye may; Work now while it is called to-day; Strive for the duty to be fit, Then toil with might to perfect it; Think not what thou hast done, Think of thy task alone. 198 “Enough, if such poor work as thine Hath place at all in His design; Enough in Temple grand, divine, To hew a stone, or hold a line; High honour thou hast got; Rejoice and murmur not. 199 “So let me sink to nothingness, For I am nothing—I am less; Nought have I, for I am in debt; Nought would I, Lord, but to forget My foolish self in thee Unto Eternity. 200 “And thou, my friend, farewell again! I weep no more, for tears are vain; But, if from spheres of light thine eye Bend sometimes on our misery, As often it hath seemed, Or I have fondly dreamed; 201 “If eyes that look on glory ever Can look upon our poor endeavour, Me no more dreaming shalt thou see— Thy death hath given life to me, And I have seen that duty Is the most Holy Beauty.” THE BISHOP'S TIMES FROM THE BASS There were three of us, when we took the road, To warn our folk that the hawks were abroad. And we met by chance in the market place, Under the gibbet we thought to grace, Some day yet, with an honest face. A black night, I remember me: The wet wind roared in the creaking tree, Where the hoarse raven was hard bestead To balance himself on a dead man's head, Holding on with claw and beak, And clapping his wings to the withered cheek Grimly at each sudden gust. “Hist!” quoth my neighbour Irwine, “Hist! To the hornet's nest in the castle rock: They're stirring now. God help the folk On the Pentland Hills to-night!” Quoth I, At sunset I was hurrying by St. Giles, when the courier, white with spray From the bit and flanks of his jaded bay, Pulled up on his haunches sudden; and forth Rushed our dry-weasened curate, that came from the north, And patters the prayers from his painted missal With a squeaking voice like a penny whistle, Nodding his wig like a downy thistle. So I pricked up my ears for news, the while Our priestling stood with a greasy smile Wrinkling a countenance sallow with bile. “Ho! now, sir curate, 'tis our time at last, And we'll tutor the Whigs to feast or fast, Or pray with candle and book and bell, Or any thing likes you in heaven or hell. Hast heard the news, man? At noon a crew Of psalm-singing villains beset and slew The good archbishop on Magus Moor— Burley and Hackston and some few more— Answered his prayers with a rascal laugh, And split his skull with a Jeddart staff. There's news makes your ears to tingle.—Ho! What crop-eared dog have we here, I trow Eavesdropping?” Then I heard a crash, And there came on my crown a sabreslash; And the courier galloped along the street. But that my bonnet was padded, to meet By-strokes of this sort, I had been dead; For all that our sucking bishop said, Was “Now will our dean get the vacant see, And what may the prospect be for me?” So, neighbour Irwine, you well may say, “God be on the Pentland Hills this day.” We parted then, each with a burden of thought; As a gust of wind from the castle brought The din of arms and of clattering hoof From the rough causeway far aloof; While the raven croaked his rusty caw, Cawing over the soldier's law— It was ever a friend to the raven's maw. Never another word crossed our lip; Only we knew by the steadfast grip Of each other's hand—a certain token— That each had a matter as yet unspoken. I was the youngest of all the three; And they should have left this gear to me. And I should have told them plainly too What it was in my heart to do. But somehow or other that courier's sabre Rang in my head like a sounding tabor; And then we were hurried, for two or three Might not meet, but the devil would be Right in the midst of them, syne or soon, In the shape of a curate or dragoon, To worm the secret out of your head. Yet I was the youngest, and should have said Plainly out to them all my will; And the old man's gray hairs haunt me still— The weird gray locks, and the withered skin, And the dark red pool they were dabbled in. As I say, I was young, and in troth, till of late, Tippet and rochet, church and state, Missal and Bible, bishop and priest, Mitre and altar, fast and feast, Little recked I of them, better or worse, If they left me only my hound and horse, A broad brown moor and a stag to course. Nay, I had been mettlesome, given to frolic, And once on a day gave our bishop a colic, By stately robing our old gray cat In Episcopal raiment, rochet and hat, And sending her out to hunt a mouse, Just as his Lordship left the house. But my wife Meg—I was courting her then— Would not hold nor bide from the westland men; And I never could round a word in her ear, If I went not with her to pray, and hear Saintly men in cellars hidden, And Gospel truth from lips forbidden. So I followed with never a graver thought, Till found of Him whom I had not sought; For, mirthful and meddlesome, God's own grace Plucked me a brand from the burning place. Now, there was a rumour that Christ would spread A table next day by the watershed Of the Pentland Hills where curlews bred. And I thought, as I heard the gathering hum, The trumpet call, and the rolling drum, The pawing hoof, and the jangling rein, Up in the castle rock again,— “They are gathering here for deeds accursed; They are gathering there with hearts a-thirst For the water of life; and I must to the road, And keep the wolf from the lambs of God. Here's Turner with his hireling loons, And Clavers'e with his devil's dragoons, And Grierson o' Lagg and Dalzell o' the Binns, With the blood of saints on their leprous skins; And the blood of the bishop on Magus Moor, Pricking them on for vengeance sure. And there, by misty glen and rock, Old men and maidens, the best of the stock Our land ever bred—be the others who may— In maud and bonnet they gather to pray. And God sees all: but the bishop's ghost Will be in, I fear, at the winning post.” So I mused down the street, till I reached my own door, Where I swithered uncertain, a minute or more; Then I crossed to the other side, hoping to see My wife busy as wont at her housewifery; For she had no thought of what was astir, And it might be the last I should see of her. Then I took up my stand in a darksome nook, Where the rain guttered on me, just craving one look Of her bonny blithe face ere I set to the road, And to leave her the peace and the blessing of God. But when I glanced up, where she stood with our child, Looking wistfully out on the tempest wild, And hushing the baby that wept on her breast, And moving about with the strange unrest, And standing by the window wrapt in light, And peering out into the darksome night, I could not abide to part from her so: Just a word, and a kiss, and then I would go; No harm could come of a word and a kiss; And how could I leave her in wretchedness? But alas! when I found me in her embrace, And the babe on my knee crowing up in my face, And the fire blazing cheerily there on the hearth, And her eyes glancing clear, and the light-hearted mirth Gleesomely singing about the room, Blithe as the birds in the early bloom— I had not the heart to break in on her joy. So the hours flew by; she cradled the boy Asleep on her round and dimpled arm, Asleep on her bosom soft and warm, And held him up for a parting kiss, With a look of beaming happiness. And then with mingled smiles and tears, She spake of boding thoughts and fears, Weird dreams and tales and luckless rhymes Of murdered men in the olden times, Which haunted her the live-long night; And she could not get rid of them do what she might; She had heard them last by her grandam's knee; And what a foolish thing was she, To have such silly thoughts of me! You may be sure I had much to do, Hearing her speak, to keep steady in view The thing it was in my heart to do. And once or twice it was on my tongue; And once or twice the devil had sung A pretty lying song in my ear: But I drowned it quick with a word of prayer. So the hours flew by till the midnight fell, And the baby slept, and the mother as well; And I crept from her side, like a guilty one, To speed on the work that must be done— God bless thee, Meg, and the little one! On the Borough-muir road I had stabled a roan, With plenty of mettle and plenty of bone; And just as the lights of morning broke By fits, like a flame leaping up in the smoke Of a fresh green log, I was trotting along, At a great round pace, with a silent throng Of stars overhead, beheld now and then Through a rift in the clouds, or a pause in the rain, A chill eerie night! there was that in its breath Made you creep, like the air in a room where Death Is busy at work: and here and there, Ghostly glimmering through the air, Phantom-lights were twinkling late, Quenchless either by wind or wet. I was troubled at heart; for I thought at times Of my wife, with her dreams and her luckless rhymes, That would not go out of her head all night; And whether she slept till morning light; And how bitterly there she would weep and moan, When she waked and found the bird was flown, And would clasp the child, and be sure that they Were widow and orphan made this day. And then my conscience pricked me sore That I should have been there long hours before. But I never knew Turner's hireling loons, Nor any of Claverse's devil-dragoons Leave the flagon ere break of day, Till they slept the fumes of the drink away. So I thought 'twould be hours ere they were astir, And silently gave my roan the spur, As she snorted, and pricked her ears forward, and strode With her long round pace on the plashy road; Holding on bravely by tower and tree, By Glencorse water, and Woodhouselee, And Rullion Green where the battle befell 'Tween the westland folk and the bloody Dalzell. And I never drew bridle and scarcely drew breath, For I rode on an errand of life and death, And I felt as if nought but a galloping pace Could quiet my mind's uneasiness: When all of a sudden my good roan steed, Who never yet failed me in hour of need, Sprang right from the path, with a cry of quick fear— A frightened cry and frightful to hear; While caw, caw, caw! from under her hoof, The raven lazily rose aloof; Lazily rose on his broad black wing, As loth to leave some horrible thing; And I fell without sense of life or pain On the brown heath 'mid the plashing rain— The plashing rain, and the raven black, Croaking and hopping lazily back. How long in that stupor dull I lay By the big white stone, I may not say: But when I awoke, with senses dim, And stiff and racked in each joint and limb, The dawn had brightened into the day, And the light birds sang on the bending spray, And the rain-drops hung on the leaves overhead, And the sunshine on the moorland played, Like a radiant smile kindling up in a face, And turning the rude into loveliness. And there in the sunshine the old man lay, And the pool was red, and his hair was gray;— Grisled locks in a pool of blood; While sleepily gorged the raven stood, Blinking dull in the golden sun. And God sees all: and the deed is done; And the old man's race at length is run. Too late—too late; my neighbour was dead; The saints were slain, and the birds were fed; From east and from west the trooper rode, And the curate was priest, and the trooper his God; And the wily informers had scent like a beagle, And wherever the carcass was there was the eagle; And the crook and the mitre were serfs to the sword, And sanctified slaughter with texts from the Word; And old men and maidens, preacher and people, From kirk and from kirkyard, from pulpit and steeple, They must take them to hiding, where hiding is sure, By the bleak Moffat water or Annandale moor, To the rocks and the mountains and dens of the earth; And now in the wilderness all that is worth Of us, withers and wanes, as the meek and the brave Wait for the dawn, or look out for a grave. But I have no part in their struggle or hope, Though I hear now and then, something faintly, their scope Whispered low in the ear, as the salt waves pass And the sea-bird screams on the rocky Bass. For they found me laid by my neighbour dead, And they tried me with boots and a cord on my head, That started the eyes from their pits; but the twine Wrung not a word from lips of mine. And the last that I saw of my wife was then When I witness bore in the sight of men, And while the crafty lawyers plied me, The crowd opened up and she stood beside me, And she held up the boy, with a blush without shame, Saying—“He shall be proud of his father's name.” ROTHES 1 What will my wife say now? She will be mad at our doin's: Good lass, she'll not swear, but she'll bow Her knees to the Lord, and avow We are bringing the glory to ruins. 2 If she would but just rap out an oath, It would ease her as much as a prayer, And be very much better for both; For I don't know how, but I'm loth To face her meek look of despair; 3 And to know that, all night on her knees, She will pray for the land and the kirk, And the crown and the sword and the keys, And the sinners that sit at their ease, Forgetting the covenant work. 4 And it's that which drives me to drink; With less than a bottle or two, To help me to hiccup and wink, I'd face a cannon, I think, Sooner than come in her view. 5 And yet she's a good little saint: What a knack she has now at praying! With her texts, and her phrases quaint, And a voice so low and faint; And no one to hear what she's saying! 6 Not a soul to hear even a word; Alone in the dark there at night, She will keep it up with the Lord; And I wish just the Archbishop heard How she prays the old Ethiop white. 7 Ecod! if she knew him as I, She'd leave him alone in his skin. Why, lass, he wishes to try A screw on your thumb by and by, And his boot on your tight little shin. 8 But, curse him, before he does that I'd give him an inch of cold steel Right through the ribs and the fat, As the man in the Judges gat, For the good of the commonweal. 9 Who could have told the kite That I warned your chickens to run? And he threeped it on me, in spite Of my swearing black and white,— Which a gentleman wouldn't have done. 10 O wouldn't you just, my Lord Archbishop, rejoice to twist Round my wife's forehead a cord, And wring from her lips a word With a wedge on her poor little wrist? 11 And what would you say to a clutch Of my hand on your lying old throat? I don't think the land would care much, Though it found in the Leven such A pious Archbishop afloat. 12 It's the parson's business to preach A hell, when we give up our breath; But you make a hell for each Who differs from what you teach, And you don't put it off till death. 13 Still that ugly test must be tried, A snare and a lie though it be; For Lauderdale's Bess must hide, With acres of land and pride, Her sins and her pedigree. 14 And there will be nice pickings too, By Jove, for me and the like; Ay, ay, Bess, the test will do For me and the Bishop and you, Rather more than our prayers belike. 15 She's a rare one that for gold! I wonder how Noll got on With the jade: she's bought and sold Fat Lauderdale, foolish and old, And he can't call his soul his own. 16 Ah! well; but commend me still To a regular saint for a wife; For, do what you like, good or ill, They only just pray for you still, And sweeten the bitter of life. 17 There's my Anne now; she loves me, I swear, Though she knows me as bad as the devil; And when she found out that affair, She did nothing but offer a prayer To keep the old sinner from evil. 18 And I've used her rascally bad; There's no doubt of that, I admit; And her dear little heart, when it's sad, No comfort on earth ever had, But a quiet religious fit. 19 And yet I've agreed to the test Which the crafty Archbishop may put her; And I know that she'll only protest, And pray, and go on like the rest, With appeals to the Lord and the future. 20 Why can't she be still, and content With her preachings, her psalms, and her prayers, And to live like a sweet little saint, And leave me to judge what is meant By the things which they tell her are snares? 21 And where is the text and the line For thus causing domestic strife? Is there Father, or Pope, or Divine Who will say that her God should be mine, And that man should give in to his wife? 22 Ah! well, but it's true, I have none, Or nothing to speak of at least; And I'd rather she prayed there alone For a change in my heart of stone, Than chose me old Sharpe for her priest. 23 And they shan't touch a hair of her head, While I have a hand and a dirk: Bishop! ay, he's a Bishop we made To bless all the blood that we shed, And to rule in the devil's own kirk. 24 Ho! bring me a bottle of sack: Is my lady waiting upstairs? Say—I'm off and can hardly be back, Say—I'm searching the pedlar's pack, Say—I'm gone, if you like, to my prayers. 25 I can't see her face to-night; I am sure she suspects what is doing; And then things get wind; and they slight Me at council, and say in their spite That I bring all their plans unto ruin. 26 Now, I will see nobody till I shall be as drunk as a lord,— And then I'll see nobody still; But the parson may go, if he will, Unless he would stretch a hemp cord. 27 He's been with her all day, and he's gruff, Yet a gentleman too, of his kind, With good blood in him, and stuff To make a good fellow enough If he had not a twist in his mind. 28 Say, I don't want his blood on my head, And am very much needing his prayers, As I mean to go drunk to my bed, And am apt to be wild in the head, If I find anybody upstairs. 29 It's a dreary place that den Between the Lomonds bleak; But better for ghostly men The ghostly and eerie glen Than to hear the gallows creak. 30 Let the Archbishop gloom as he will; Let Lauderdale rant and swear; I've but kept them from doing some ill, And we'll all have our nice pickings still, When we ask them to vow and declare. PEDEN THE PROPHET 1 Ah! woe for the Lamb's dear Bride! And woe for this covenant-land! Compassed on every side With hate and treason and pride, And feeble in heart and hand; The Lord will His wrath command On a faithless land and Bride. 2 Dark is the day; but worse The night that is drawing near, With Death on his pale white horse, And the dead lying hid in the gorse, And floating in river and mere, While the streets of the city appear Red with the blood of the corse. 3 I see the lean dogs creeping To their feast in the lone dark street; I see the foul birds leaping To the house where a child is sleeping On a mother's bosom sweet— But her heart hath ceased to beat; And the foul birds are croaking and leaping. 4 And we've not seen the worst of it yet; And I wot not whether I may, Though I sought the Lord, when we met Near the black Moffat water, to get Just a blink of light on my way, And to know if I should play The man, in the worse times yet. 5 But he said, “Content ye now, You shall be where I think best”: “Yea, Lord,” quoth I, “but Thou Knowest I never did bow To Baal with the rest, Nor took the black, false test”: But he said, “Content ye now.” 6 I was sitting alone on the hill By a thunder-blasted tree, Where a corby had gorged his fill Of a lamb that was lying ill; And in the red light he Stood winking drowsily, With the blood and fat on his bill. 7 The gray, cold mist was creeping At gloaming over the hill, The whaup in the stank was sleeping, And the lonesome heron keeping Its watch where the pool was still, And slow and gray and chill The gloaming mist was creeping. 8 Then I saw, as plain as eye Could see, the veil uplift, And the dark years sweeping by In terror and misery— Dark years, with never a rift In the cloud of blackness, swift Went sweeping gloomily by. 9 Airds Moss was nought but a ploy, And the Pentlands only a jest, And Bothwell Brig was a toy, And the Highland raid a joy; For East shall cry to West, And the dead shall seem to be blest, And all the past but a ploy. 10 I saw the trooper ride, With the blood on his bridle hand, Down by the Solway tide, And over the banks of Clyde; I saw o'er all the land The gruesome gibbet stand, And the godless trooper ride. 11 Silent the song of labour; And the clap of the mill was dumb; Hushed were the pipe and the tabor; And only the clash of the sabre Rang to the fife and the drum, As the red troopers come, Trampling the fields of our labour. 12 The maid with her milking pail Wept at the empty byre; Dazed and eerie and pale, The husbandman with his flail, Stood by the smouldering pyre, As the wild red sparks of fire Blazed up in the rising gale. 13 Wailing down in the glen, Weeping up on the hill, A cry from the cities of men, And the cleft of the rock and the den; For the dead lay unburied, until The time and half time fulfil The word of the Lord of men. 14 There was none to woo or to wed, There was none to speak of cheer, There was none to lift up the head, As the land sat down with its dead— Sat down in the dust with fear, While the Baal-priests drew near, And mocked at the bowed-down head. 15 Labour, and pleasure, and faith, All of them were forgot, And men held in their breath At the ghastly riot of death; For terror did quite besot Even them who had wrestled and fought Hitherto in the hope of the faith. 16 I saw it all, and I think The Lord hath shown to me Sometimes, a wonderful blink Of things beyond the brink Of the dark futurity,— Even more than I want to see; But it's all for your good, I think. 17 You call me a prophet, and Maybe I am, indeed, All the prophet a land That hath broken its covenant band, Either shall get or need— And yet but a shaking reed In a dreary desert land. 18 Sometimes I'm tempted sore To say, Lord, let me be As blind as others or more; And sometimes I've thought, before, It was but guessing in me, And nothing of prophecy,— Shrewd guessing, and nothing more. 19 So the Tempter will sift me like wheat, Till I say to him, Get thee behind! Or trample him under my feet:— And bless me not when you meet, For it's not all blessing, I find; Yea, I had liefer be blind, When Satan will sift me like wheat. 20 And guess or grace, I am sure There are dark days near at hand For the Lord's afflicted poor And the Lamb's bride to endure, In a waste and weary land, From gaol and gibbet and brand, And the trooper's vengeance sure. 21 For if God ever spoke to me, It was just that night on the hill, As I sat by the blasted tree, And the gray mists eerily Crept, ghostly and slow and chill, And the corby gorged his fill, As the word was given to me. OLD GREYFRIARS 1 All of us from the western shires, Fifteen hundred men, They marched us into the Old Greyfriars, About the stroke of ten: Hungry and wounded and worn and weary, We wist it was but for a night That they marched us into the kirkyard eerie, In the dusky evening light. 2 A bonny kirkyard is the Old Greyfriars, When the wallflower blooms in June, And scatters its scent with the fresh sweetbriar's Under the glint of the moon: And we ranged us on the green grass there, Or under the ivy-tod, And raised our psalm and offered our prayer To Jacob's mighty God. 3 But long ere the dank November day, When the earth was sodden with rain, And the chill fog clung where the long grass lay Rotting with damp amain, Of all who came from the western shires, The fifteen hundred men, Had you reckoned us well in the Old Greyfriars, Not three were there for ten. 4 There were some that died in the summer tide, Rotting away like sheep; There were some went mad with the visions they had, Between awake and asleep; And some were traitors to the faith, And signed their hope away— Better for them had they met their death On Bothwell Brig that day. 5 O Bothwell Brig! that wert so big With hope to us and more; O Bothwell Brig! the westland whig May well thy name deplore. And ye who would guide the stormy tide, Think well ere ye begin; For ye scrupled away our lives that day, Ere we the bridge could win. 6 It's oh for courage! and oh for sense! And a Joab with the host! That we may stand on our sure defence, Ere yet the day be lost. Here were we from the western shires, Good fifteen hundred men; And reckon us now in the Old Greyfriars, There are not three for ten. THE CONFESSION OF ANNAPLE GOWDIE, WITCH 1 Annie Winnie and me Were both at Yester kirk;— She on a broom, and I on a straw, “Horse and hattock” o'er North Berwick Law We rode away in the mirk. 2 It was Fastern's Even, And we lichted down on a grave, Where an ape preached loud to a ghostly crowd, Surpliced well with a bonny white shroud, And a corby sang the stave. 3 “The covin” all was there; Thirteen of us with “the maid”;— She was Bessie Vickar from Kelvin side; And wow! but she hotched in her unco pride— Deil thraw her neck for a jade. 4 And there was Pickle-the-wind, And there was Over-the-dyke, And Ailie Nesbit, Able-and-stout, And Elspie Gourlay, Good-at-a-bout; Buzzing all like a byke. 5 Black Jock was in his tantrums; And hech! but he was daft! Alick Flett, with his chanter het, Fizzing whenever his lips it met, Skirled away in the laft. 6 Oh, we were crouse and canty A' doon in Yester kirk, And we supped on the toad and the hooded craw, Daintily spread on a coffin braw, At midnight in the mirk. 7 And syne we held a session, And tried the lassies there; Twal gruesome carles were elders good, And a black tom-cat for bethral stood, And the foul fiend took the chair. 8 And Elspie Gourlay first Confessed to a strangled bairn; And Bessie Vickar allowed that she Whummled a boat in a quiet sea, With a bonny young bride in the stern, 9 And some had played their cantrips Wi' poor wives' milking kine; And one had made an image good, And crucified it on holy rood, That the Laird's ae son micht pine. 10 But me and Annie Winnie, The foul thief kissed us baith; For we choked the priest on the Eucharist When he was glowering at Effie M'Christ, And speaking of holy faith. 11 Hech! sirs, but we had grand fun Wi' the muckle black deil in the chair, And the muckle Bible upside doon, A' gangin' withershins roun' and roun', And backwards saying the prayer; 12 About the warlock's grave Withershins gangin' roun', And kimmer and carline had for licht The fat o' a bairn they buried that nicht, Unchristened beneath the moon. 13 And, when the red cock crew In the farmstead up on the hill, And the black tom-cat began to mew, Witch and warlock, away we flew In the morning gray and chill. 14 And my gudeman was sleeping, Wi' the besom at his side, And hech! but he kissed the bonny broom, My braw gudeman, my auld bridegroom, As I lichted doon frae my ride. 15 And Annie Winnie and me Crack crouse o' Yester kirk, And how she on the broom and I on a straw, “Horse and hattock” o'er North Berwick Law Rode away in the mirk. 16 But what if it all was a dream Of things I had heard before, And I only said what they wished to be said, When they twisted the cord round my old gray head Till flesh could bear no more? THE COMPLAINT OF DEACON BIRSE, Burgess, Aberdeen 1 A plague on their kirks and their covenants both! And their preachings long and rife! I wot not how many a test and oath I have ta'en for a quiet life. First I must swear to Master Cant, And then to the Solemn League; And then they would have me both recant, And join some other intrigue. 2 I've sworn at their bidding black and white, And signed and sealed and declared; I've boxed the compass round outright, And the feint a boddle I cared; And I hardly know what I am to-day, Or what was the last I swore; But hey! for the friar of orders gray! He's ready to clear my score. 3 A plague on them all—their mitre and bishop, Their presbyter and their Book! Can't they leave me alone to barrel my fish up? And hang my pot on the crook? A bonny kirk! as poor as a rat, And hungry as ever a beagle, A brat that an imp of the devil begat, The Protestant wallydraigle! 4 I want to trade in timber and hide, And salmon from the Dee, And the bonny white pearls from Ythan side, And the herring that crowds the sea; For silk to busk my lady fine, Or brandy in the flask, Or a drop of the kindly claret wine, Or malvoisie in the cask. 5 I've a lugger good with Tarland wood For Flushing ready to sail; And my dainty smack, by the almanac, Should be home from Portingale; But what with their kirk and their covenant work, Hardly a wind blows right; And we'll never have luck till the ancient kirk Comes to her own some night. 6 That's a vintage coming from Portingale, Will make old Rothes smack; And the tippling Chancellor pays me well, When he sends me a cargo back— A cargo of canting preachers for't, To sell in the new plantation; Hee! they set me once in a sackcloth shirt To win my soul's salvation. 7 A plague on them all! but they won't grow fat In my old schooner's hold, With a skipper who knows what I would be at, And who likes the chink of the gold. And, if some of them happen to die on the way, Who forced their oaths down my throat; It's hey! for the friar of orders gray Who assoilzies me all for a groat. MARION BROWN'S LAMENT 1 “What think you now of your braw goodman?” Ah! woe is me! My heart was high when I began, My heart was high, and my answer ran, “More than ever he is to me.” 2 Mickle thought I of my bridegroom brave, Ah! woe is me! Mickle I thought of him douce and grave, When he waled me out among the lave, Me, a poor maiden, his wife to be. 3 But there on the greensward lying dead, Ah! woe is me! As I laid on my lap his noble head, And kissed the lips that for Jesus bled, More than ever he was to me. 4 My heart was high when I began, Ah! woe is me! I was so proud of my brave goodman, Never a tear from my eyelids ran, Although they gathered in my e'e. 5 But when I laid him on his bed, Ah! woe is me! And spread the face-cloth over his head, And sat me down beside my dead, O but my heart grew sair in me. 6 Weary and eerie the night went by, Ah! woe is me! Dark and cold, and so was I, And aye the wind moaned drearily Over the moor, and back to me. 7 And aye as I looked at the empty chair, Ah! woe is me! And the Book that he left open there, And the text that bade me cast my care On the Father of all that cared for me; 8 And aye as my Mary and little Will, Ah! woe is me! Whispered, Father is sleeping still, And hush! for Minnie is weary and ill, My heart was like to break in me. 9 It's well for men to be heroes grand; Ah! woe is me! But a woman's hearth is her country, and A desolate home is a desolate land; And he was all the world to me. M'KAIL'S FAREWELL 1 Farewell, my friends, and parents dear; And weep not o'er my bloody bier, For grace and glory triumph here. 2 Farewell, my foes; I pray for you; Shew mercy, Lord, for Thou art true; Alas! they know not what they do. 3 Farewell, thou earth, where I have trod, And seen the wondrous ways of God, With comfort of His staff and rod. 4 Farewell, ye sun and moon and stars, And planets pale, and fiery Mars, And comets dire, foreboding wars: 5 Star-pavement of His house are ye, Shining in glorious majesty. But soon beneath my feet to be. 6 Farewell, thou Book of grace divine, So loved and pondered every line, Book of the world's best hope and mine: 7 Soon, face to face, I'll see with awe The gospel truth and holy law, Which yet as in a glass I saw. 8 And farewell, Church, the Lamb's dear Bride, Whose garments now with blood are dyed, With blood, too, washed and purified; 9 And farewell, time; I part with thee, And welcome immortality, And incorrupted life to me. 10 Mortal, immortal now, to Him, Who sits between the cherubim, I sing the everlasting hymn— 11 “Worthy the Lamb for us that died, With crown of thorn and wounded side, Despised, rejected, crucified.” 12 I hear the strain, and would away To them who neither preach nor pray, But praise for ever, night and day. 13 Farewell, I step on that bright shore; My weary pilgrimage is o'er, And welcome home for evermore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OLRIG GRANGE BOOK FIRST EDITORIAL I, Herr Professor Künst, Philologus, Editor of these rhymes—having no knack That way, myself, to make my words go chime, Or none that makes a crystal of my thought, Face answering to face, and so built up By inward force of Law inevitable— Care not to tag mere fringes to my lines, And mar their meaning. 'Tis a pretty sight The lissom maiden dancing her light measure, And keeping time with castanet or timbrel, When maiden, dance, and timbrel all are one Joy of great nature. But enough for me The unwonted dance without the castanet, The measured tread without the timing jingle. God giveth speech to all, song to the few. A quaint old gateway, flanked on either side By grim, heraldic beasts with beak and claw And scaly coating—yet four-footed beasts— Opened into a long, straight avenue, Lined by rough elms, stunted, and sloping west, And nipped by sharp sea-winds. Without a turn, It ran up to a tall, slim, grey, old house, With many blinking windows, row on row, And high-pitched gables rising, step by step, Above heraldic beasts with beak and claw, That pranced at every corner. A green bank, Broken with flower-plots, on the one side dropt Down to a brattling brook; upon the other A group of brown Scotch firs reared their straight boles And spreading crowns, breaking the chill east wind; And then a holly hedge enclosed the garth, Which altogether covered scant an acre. Eastward, you saw the glimmer of the sea, And the white pillar of the lighthouse tall Guarding the stormy Ness: a minster church Loomed with twin steeples high above the smoke Of a brisk burgh, offspring of the church And of the sea, and with an old Norse love Of the salt water, and the house of God, And letters and adventure. On the west, Cleft by the stream, a slow-retiring hill Embayed a goodly space which once had been Waste moorland for the curlew, and the snipe Haunted its marshes. Lately, growing wealth, From fleets of fishing craft, and ventures far To Greenland and Archangel, had subdued The peat-hag and the stony wilderness: And here and there a citizen's countryhouse Stood among fields where cattle browsed, or corn Was rustling: yet there still were, here and there, Stretches of heathy moss and yellow gorse, And desert places strewn with white bleached stones, And grey rocks tufted o'er with birch and hazel. And through the gorse, and over rock and stone, The brattling brook leaped downward to the sea. The slim, grey house with its heraldic beasts, Nestling in its scant acre of flower-plots And green sward, at the end of the elm-tree drive, Stood plainly in ancestral dignity, Aloof from citizen's villa: shorn of wealth, It was the home of culture and simple taste, And heir of fine traditions. By the door, Where it was hid by honey-suckle sprays And briar-rose that trailed around the porch, There stood a youth, at early twilight, making Impatient gestures, switching thistle-down And nettle and dandelion, and whate'er His hasty stroke might reach; yet humorous Rather than fretful, for the art was his To break vexations with a ready jest, As one that, on the stirrup duly rising, Rides lightly through the world. A graceful youth, And tall, and slightly stooping, with features high And thin and colourless; yet earnest life Beamed, full of hope and energy and help, From his great lustrous eyes, though now and then They swam into a dreamy, far-off gaze, As seeing the invisible. He was A student who had travelled many a field Of arduous learning, planted venturous foot On giddy ledge of speculative thought, And searched for truth o'er mountain, shore and sea, In stone and flower, and every living thing Where he might read the open secret of God With his own eyes, and ponder out its meaning. Intent he was to know, and knowing do The work laid to his hand; yet evermore, As he toiled up the solemn stair with joy, Caught by some outlook on a larger world, He seemed to pause, and gaze, and dream a dream. These moods I noted when he was my pupil, And some strange vocable from India, Or fragment of the old Semitic speech Would suddenly arrest his eager quest, And sunder us, like the ocean or the grave. So stood he, in the twilight, near his home, And waiting for his sister, smote the weeds; Impetuous, humorous, bright, and mystical, The wonder and the glory of the place, Scarce out of boyhood, yet the pride of all. Trained for a priest, for that is still the pride And high ambition of the Scottish mother, There was a kind of priestly purity In all his thoughts, and a deep undertone Ran through his gayest fancies, and his heart Reached out with manifold sympathies, and laid Fast hold on many outcast and alone I' the world. But being challenged at the door Of God's high Temple to indue himself With armour that he had not proved, to clothe With articles of ready-made Belief His Faith inquisitive, he rent the Creed Trying to fit it on, and cast it from him; Then took it up again, and found it worn With age, and riddled by the moth, and rotten. Therefore he trod it under foot, and went Awhile with only scant fig-leaves to clothe His naked spirit, longing after God, But striving more for knowledge than for faith. The Priest was left behind; the hope of Glory Became pursuit of Fame; and yet a light From heaven kept hovering always over him, Like twilight from a sun that had gone down. LOQUITUR THOROLD Quick, Hester, quick! the old scarlet cloak And silken hood are dainty trim 'Mong birch and hazel and lichened rock; The sun is but a little rim Above the hill, and twilight dim Is setting o'er the leaping brook Where we our summer pleasance took, When youth was light of heart and limb, And Life was the dream of a Fairy Book. Quick! let us spend the gloaming there— A plague on bonnets, shawls and pins, And last nice touches of the hair, That just begin when one begins To lose his patience! Women's sins Are not alone the ills they do, But those that they provoke you to, While smiling lips and dimpling chins Wonder what can be the matter with you. Well, minx! I hope you're pleased at last: You've made yourself an angel nice, And me a brute this half-hour past. Now, did you ever count the price When each new grace costs some new vice? You fondle a curl—my wrath I pet; You finger a ribbon—I fume and fret; You'd ruin a husband worse than dice, Buying your beauty at such a rate. Look, how the slanting sunbeams long Gird with light-rings the grey birch trees; And from his unseen place of song The sky-lark on the evening breeze Shakes down his fluttering melodies: The coneys from their burrows creep, The troutlets in the still pools leap, The pines their odorous gums release, And the daisies are pink in their dewy sleep. Perchance we ne'er shall hear again, Thus hand in hand, the swift brook flow, Except in dreams when we are fain To haunt the fabled long-ago; For ere to-morrow's sun is low, I haste me to the crowded street Where every stranger face I meet Shall less of kithely feeling show Than the rippling gleam of this water sweet. Nay, dear; my heart is full of hope; Bid me not stay in my career. Our little Bourg hath little scope For aught but gossip in the ear; And I must gird me to appear A man among the strong and brave, A man with purpose high and grave, Still fronting duty without fear, And helming my prow to the threatening wave. 'Twas sweet to dream as we have dreamed Together in years long ago, When Life might be as Fancy deemed, For aught the happy child could know, A bright illusion, and a show Create at will, and shaped to meet Each changeful whim, and quaint conceit, And varying mood of joy or woe, Nor ever with tragic end complete. But ill for him who will not see The dream to be a dream indeed, And life a fateful mystery, And iron fact the only creed To lean on in the hour of need. The child may dream; the man must act With reverence for the world's great fact; And look to toil and sweat and bleed, And gather his energies all compact. Why might I not my battle fight Here by your side with pen and book? Girls never understand aright That men must leave the ingle-nook And for a larger wisdom brook Experience of a harder law, And learn humility and awe: And books are mirrors where you look But on shadows of things which others saw. How sweet the old brook tinkles still Through daisy mead and golden broom, Where once we placed our water-mill, And heard it clicking in the gloom, Hushed, sleepless, in our little room! Yonder, we caught the tiny trout— Our first—you carried it about All day, complaining of its doom, And trying each pool if its life were gone out. There are no traces of the mill: But lo! our garden in the nook, The walks we shaped with simple skill, Bordered with white stones from the brook; And there are still some flowers we took From garden plots, and planted here: Our works decay and disappear, God's frailest works abide, and look Down on the ruins we toil to rear. Here is the sloping mossy bank, With slender pansies purple-eyed, And drooping hare-bells, and the rank Plume-fern in all its palmy pride; And yonder the still waters glide Where big raspberries and brambles grew:— The stream was deep and broad for you, And there my imping manhood tried To reach at them for my sister true. Lo! here we dreamed the Pilgrim's dream; And went forth, that bright summer day, To seek the New Jerusalem, Along the strait and thorny way Tangled with gorse and bramble spray, But never found the wicket-gate: Distraught, our mother wandered late, While we beside the mill-dam lay, And saw the newt creep 'mong the bulrushes great. There, too, we dreamt a lonely isle, With white waves girdled by the sea That stormed along the beach, the while A good ship struggled gallantly; And I alone must saved be, And thou wert Friday, by-and-by, Whose mystic footprint caught my eye On the brown sand; and thou to me Wert slave ever ready to run or fly. And we had Genii of the Lamp— The lamp was ne'er so rubbed before; And jars and crocks we left in damp Odd corners, all the night or more, Which we as fishers hauled ashore, Listening to hear the prisoned Jinn Bemoan his captive fate within: And what, if he were free to soar Like a dreadful giant with smoke and din! Ay me! What happy dreams we had! And still they linger fondly here; The air seems nimble with the glad Quaint fancies of our childhood dear; And here, at least, they do appear Half-real still; it seems profane To reason them down as fancies vain, Where all that meets the eye and ear Brings the faith and glory of youth again. Then by-and-by great thoughts were ours Of triumph and high enterprise, As knowledge broadened with our powers, And Science oped our wondering eyes To Nature's fruitful mysteries. No life of vulgar wealth we sought, Nor pleasure from indulgence got; We would be brave and true and wise, And hoard all treasures of noble thought. The heroes of historic age Beckoned us on to glorious deeds And hardy training, and to wage Victorious war on foemen weeds: And now we breathed on oaten reeds, Or conned, apart, a secret song, Ashamed as if the deed were wrong; And now we rubbed your amber beads For trial of their attraction strong. We gathered wild flowers in the woods, We wandered miles for heath and fern, We found in brakes the callow broods Of singing birds; we sought the erne On its lone cliff; and strove to learn All Nature's kindly providence For all its creatures, and the sense Of all its changes to discern, With all the infinite why and whence. We turned the glass to moon and stars, The Pleiads, and the Milky Way, To Saturn's ring, and fiery Mars, And Venus haunting close of day: We bent the glass to watch the play Of spasm-like life in water drops; And where the red stone upward crops We hammered, eager for a prey Of moss or fern from the old-world copse. And oh those days beside the sea! The skerries paved with knotted shells, The bright pools of anemone, The star-fish with their fretted cells, The scudding of the light foam-bells Along the stretch of rippled strand Spotted with worms of twisted sand, The white gulls, and the shining sails, And the thoughts they all brought from the Wonder-land! And fondly watched our mother dear, The dawning promise of our youth, Lilting a ballad low and clear, And fostering fearless love of truth And meekness, piety and ruth, And charity and womanhood; For so she said, that to be good Was to be rich in very sooth; And the good Lord gave His children food. And still the unfailing laughter pealed At homely jests that ne'er grew old; And still we breathless heard, and thrilled When the old winter's tale was told; And still, as thought grew keen and bold, Her loving instinct steadied all The march of mind with faithful call To patient duty manifold, And to wait and work when the light was small. O happy childhood! wakening first In moony realms of fond romance; And quenching soon a deeper thirst In science that refrained to glance Scorn at old faiths: so we could once Believe we heard the mermaid sing, And that the deft Fays shaped the ring, Footing o' moonlights in the dance, And that the Spirit lay hidden in every thing. Nor need that early faith be all In clear definéd knowledge lost: Though never Greek to Ilium's wall In the swift ships the sea had crossed, Each wrathful king with banded host, The tale of Troy were true to me, More than bare fact of history: There is more truth than is engrossed In your musty sheepskin guarantee. And there is truth transcending far The way of scientific thought, Which travels to the farthest star, And verges on the smallest mote, But all beyond it knoweth not; Its ladder, based on earth, must lean Its summit on the felt and seen; But ever our hearts their rest havesought In that dim Beyond, where it hath not been. 'Tis wisdom, doubtless, for the man To learn the fact and stedfast Law; Yet Wisdom also in its plan Embraced the child's great wondering awe Which found the Unseen in all it saw, Whom now we seek with cruel strain Of longing heart and 'wildered brain, Tossing our barren chaff and straw In search of the old diviner grain. Can it be wisdom to forget What wisdom taught us yesterday? What if the form may change, and yet The truth abide that in it lay? And what if Jinn, and Ghost, and Fay, Were but the form of highest truth— The Father's parable for youth, To teach that Law is Will, to say, I am the worker of all, in sooth! So might the dream be, after all, The key which confident Science lost, And hath been groping round the wall Of mystery, perplex'd and toss'd, In search of, making many a boast, Yet conscious that her universe Of several facts and laws is scarce God's living world; yea, is at most His graveyard, whither she drove His hearse. Our Science knows no Father yet; He seems to vanish as we think; And most of all, when we are set To fish for Faith upon the brink Of Nature; we draw, link by link, A line of close-plied reasoning Elaborate, and hope to bring, Besides the baited thought we sink, God from the depths at the end of a string! Ah! who shall find the perfect Whole In the small fragment that we see? Or mirror in the flesh-bound soul The image of Immensity? Our hearts within us faint, and we, Amid the storm and darkness driven, Cry out for God to earth and heaven: But what if all our answer be Only our cry by the echoes given? As light outside the Temple vast Coming and going with sudden gleams On altar, pillar, and pavement cast, Down on our lower world he streams An externe glory. So it seems; But who can tell? The things that press On our dream-life's half-consciousness, Though real as the hills and streams, Are the stuff dreams are made of nevertheless. O days of Faith! when earth appeared A Bethel sure, an House of God, And in the dream His voice was heard, And sorrow was His chastening rod; And stony pillow and grassy sod Seemed, lying on the Father's breast; And men had many an angel guest, And ever where the pilgrim trod God was near him, The Highest and Best. Great days of Faith and miracle! When nature might not be explained, And the earth kept her secret well, But there was worship high, unfeigned, And men were noble, and God reigned; They were not barren though we laugh, And swear their mills ground finest chaff; For peace and love and truth unstained Are more than steam and a telegraph. How is it that our modern thought Has travelled from these sacred ways, And every certain truth is bought By parting with some Faith and Praise? We light our earth with the quenchéd rays Of heaven: and yet we only seek Truth for the strong and for the weak, Loving it more than length of days, Or the ruby lip and the blooming cheek. Our science, with its several facts And fragmentary laws, hath lost The unity that all compacts, And makes a cosmos of the host. Force changes, but its changes cost, And in the elemental war Conserving transformations are So wasteful, Time shall one day boast But a burnt-out sun and a cinder star. Well, well; our mother knew no laws, Except the Ten Commandments clear, Nor talked of First, or Final Cause, But walked with God in love and fear, And always felt that He was near By instinct of a spirit true; And she had peace and strength, in lieu Of that unrest and trouble here Which break like the billows on me and you. Enough; we have not yet redeemed The promise of our early days; We are not all that we have dreamed, Nor all that she would crown with praise; But we have loving been always, And earned some little fame, and hope For more where there is ampler scope; And you will crown me with my bays, Sweet sister mine, when I reach the top. Nay, say not that I shall forget, And find a dearer love than thee; A sweeter love was never yet Than this sufficing joy in me: Thou art my fulness. I shall be But half a heart and head and will, Except thou be beside me still, For in our being's mystery Ever the better part thou didst fill. Not jealous, say you? but afraid About my principles and views? Why, it was you that first betrayed, You little sceptic, dangerous, loose, And unsound doctrine: I but use The wicked weapons that you made: Even as a child you never prayed With half my faith in those old Jews, And we ne'er got the Catechism into your head. But my Faith is not gone, although At times it seems to fade away. I would I were as long ago; I cling to God, and strive to say The devil and all his angels Nay: But in the crucible of thought Old forms dissolve, nor have I got, Or seem to wish, new moulds of clay To limit the boundless truth I sought. Can the great God be aught but vague, Bounded by no horizon, save What feeble minds create to plague High reason with?—We madly crave, For definite truth, and make a grave, Through too much certainty precise, And logical distinction nice, For all the little Faith we have, Buying clear views at a terrible price. Too dear, indeed, to part with Faith For forms of logic about God, And walk in lucid realms of death, Whose paths incredible are trod By no soul living. Faith's abode Is mystery for evermore, Its life to worship and adore, And meekly bow beneath the rod, When the day is dark, and the burden sore. What soft, low notes float everywhere In the soft glories of the moon! Soft winds are whispering in the air, And murmuring waters softly croon To mossy banks a muffled tune; Softly a rustling faint is borne Over the fields of waving corn— God's still small voice, we drownatnoon, Which is everywhere heard in the even and morn. Hush! let us go. The stars shine out, Yonder the moonlight on the sea,— The fishers spread their sails about Its tangled rings; from yon lime tree The hum of some belated bee Sways as if lost; I seem to hear A boding murmur in my ear Of coming storm. What, if it be Omen of tempest in my career? Strange! that whene'er the hour arrives, Which we have longed for day and night, To act the purpose of our lives, Fades all the glory and the light, Fails too the sense of power and might; And there are omens in the air, And voices whispering Beware!— But never victor in the fight Heeded the portents of fear and care. BOOK SECOND EDITORIAL She sat alone at evening by the fire In a dim parlour panelled with brown pine, Some sewing in her lap—yet she sewed not, A book in hand—and yet she did not read, My Hester, as she sits beside me now, His sister, twin in birth, in culture twin, And with a marked unlikeness, strangely like. For he was tall, and a black shock of hair, Of stiff, rough hair, rose o'er a forehead broad And noticeable, though you noticed only The large grey eyes beneath—not cruel-grey, But swimming dreamy eyes that seemed to gaze Into a world of wonders far away. And she was fair, a golden blue-eyed maid, A slight, small girl, with the Norse aspect frank, And sunny and intelligent, and firm Of purpose; for she never dreamt, or dreamt Knowingly, swinging on an anchor held Fast to a bottom of clearest consciousness: A lady practical, imperative, With mind compact and clear and self-possessed, And reason peremptory and competent; Ne'er blinded by the glamour of loving thought, And yet not less enamoured with her thought, But loyal, true and womanly. Wherein The unlike likeness lay you could not tell; But as you travelled with them day by day, And grew familiar with their looks and ways, And knew the tenor of their thoughts, you felt The twain were twin alike in mind and body. Deft is she to detect, and to dissect Folly and foible and weakness, and with keen Shaft of light humour, or bolt of piercing wit Can reach the joints and marrow; yet she says That if her hero is but brave and true, She knows herself to be so little and poor, And knows the world, beside, so mean, and false, And knows how hard the battle to be true, That she bates not her faith or love or worship For seams and flaws that only show him human, And linked by weakness closer to our love. And in those years her brother she adored, And he was worthy; and she loves me now; With all my sins and mine infirmities At large writ in her book, she loves me still, My Hester who is sitting by my side, And in whose features, scanning one by one, I trace, amid unlikeness, likeness strange To him who halved a common life with her. Of an old stock, lairds of the barren moorland While mitred abbots lorded there supreme, But Vikings from Norwegian fiords long Before the cross or mitre or the light Of Christian Faith left but the names of Thor And Thing and Balder clinging to the shores; In later times they gathered from the sea Wealth that the land denied, and swept the coast With net and yawl, and had their ironbound fleets Spearing the Arctic-whale, whose jawbones arched A lofty gateway to their busy wharf; Or hunting seal, and walrus fierce in battle, But faithful and piteous to its uncouth young: And thereof many a stirring tale was told Of perilous combat, touched with pathos rude, By weather-beaten mariners at home In the long nights beside the winter fire. So they grew rich, and had enriched the land; But the last Burgher-laird died young, and left Many large ventures on the perilous sea, And in more perilous mines. His gentle widow, Harassed by alien cares, retired at length With her twin children from the 'wildering task, Cheerfully leaving three parts of her wealth Somewhere—she knew not where—in falling scrip, And flooded mines, and meshes of the law. But from that hour, a happy mother, she Lived for her children, trained them faithfully With generous culture to all nobleness, Giving them for inheritance the wealth Of the old wisdom and the new research: And then she also died. Thorold and Hester Were last of all the Asgards of Olrig. And so she sat that evening by the fire, In the dim parlour panelled with brown pine, And nothing seemed to do, and nothing see, But all the more she was alert to hear, As if she listened eager for the coming Of one who yet came not; she only heard The far-off moaning of the restless sea, The nearer rippling of the lightsome brook, The rising breeze that tossed the brown Scotch pines, The rooks that cawed, high-cradled by the breeze, The creak and slamming of a wicketgate, The barking of a dog in upland farm, The untimely crowing of a wakeful cock, And all the inexplicable sounds that haunt Turret and stair and lobbies in old houses, When the wind stirs o' nights. And then she felt The creeping of an eerie loneliness. LOQUITUR HESTER So he is gone, and I am left Alone, and very lone it is, To keep the dear old home, bereft Of all that made it home and bliss, Of all on earth that I should miss. I almost fear my heart will break; And yet it must not, for his sake; But it is hard to suffer this, For there's nothing I look on but makes my heart ache. It is like living with the dead, These pictures, and the old arm-chair, And all I meet when I turn my head In every room, on every stair; Their eyes gaze on me everywhere, And all so silent; yet I seem At times to hear, as in a dream, Dear voices calling here and there, And mocking my heart as I stitch and seam. I must not turn a silly maid, A feather-pated girl, the prey Of weak nerves and an empty head, That sighs through all the vacant-day, And trembles, in the evening grey, Over a dull dog-eared romance, To see the stealthy moonbeams glance, Or hear the wind in crannies play, Or the mice in the wainscot squeak and dance. Why might I not have gone with him? We ne'er were parted heretofore; I am as strong of heart and limb: At worst, I could not suffer more Than fretting here. Oh, it was sore To stand upon the windy pier, And try to wave my hand, and cheer, With something in my heart's wild core That surged with rebellion and trouble and fear. I deem it barbarous, this way Of making woman a helpful wife By keeping us poor girls away From all the enterprise of life, Its hardship, and its generous strife.— All men are Turks at heart, and hold That sugar plums, and rings of gold, And pretty silks, and jewels rife Are all that we need till we're fat and old. And yet they want us, ne'ertheless, To think their thoughts, and sympathise With all the struggle and distress Of souls that would be true and wise, To laud them when they win the prize, To cheer them if they strive and fail, And gird anew their glorious mail, And then sink back to house-wiferies, To shirts and flannels, and beef and ale. What, if I were to follow him To that great London? I have tried To think and write, and I might swim, With other minnows, by the side Of the great fish that keep the tide.— A tale, a woman's touch of art, And insight into woman's heart, Not deeply thought, but keenly spied, That were not, surely, too lofty a part. But it would vex him: and his love Is more to me than all the world: There's nothing he dislikes above A short-haired woman, frizzly, curled, Her flag for woman's rights unfurled, Her middle finger black with ink, Her staring eyes that will not wink, Like spectacles—a double-barrelled Terror, he says, to mén that think. So that would never do: beside, There's plenty of other reasons. He Would keep the old household by my side, And all things as they used to be; The plants, and stones, and library, The fossils rare, and etchings nice, And other things beyond all price: And there's another might long for me, And his evening chess-board, once or twice. I'm cold, and yet the night is warm; And restless, yet the hour is still; And haunted by a vague alarm, Yet all is hopeful, and he will Surely a glorious fate fulfil. I dare not doubt it. He is true To the high aim he has in view, Intolerant of hoary ill, But open to all that is good and new. The doubts of venturous thoughts have cast Uncertain shadows o'er his mind; His soaring spirit has not passed Above the realm of clouds, to find The light serene that lies behind: But he is pure and undefiled, Unworldly as a little child, And still amid the darkness blind, Clings to the Lowly One, meek and mild. He has a scholar's culture, hence A Greek-like taste, calm, purified; He has the poet's delicate sense Of beauty, ever with good allied; A nature large and free and wide And plastic and impressible— Too much perhaps: a stronger will, A little more of self and pride, And he would be safer from earthly ill. And then he has more sympathy, Perchance, with truth and beauty than The power creative: he would be A stronger, if a narrower man, Less balanced; for his equal plan, Diffused on all sides from his youth, Unto all wisdom, grace, and truth, Into most just proportions ran, With risk of being but graceful and smooth. A perfect critic of all good, But longing ever to be more: Well understanding every mood Of genius, finding every door Of knowledge open, and the lore Of ages to his insight free, For he has still the master-key; Yet would he launch out from the shore, And plough for himself an untravelled sea. And there is risk that such a mind Shall be too nice and delicate, And in its equipoise may find A very impotence, and wait, And never dare a glorious fate, The sense of fine perfection still Embarrassing the purposed will, Until the shadows gather late, And the mist is folded about the hill. Yet if he were not what he is, I could not love him then as now: It were another mind than his, Other, not better then, I trow: He hath such courage to avow His faiths, such knowledge to impart, Such boundless sympathy with Art, Such fancies, like the blossomed bough That clasps the fruit in its fragrant heart. Then he is brave and beautiful In manhood, radiant with the might Of that rich life and grace which rule The admiration and delight Of Fashion—witty, airy, bright: I dread for him a woman's wiles, And cunning arts, and winsome smiles, And trifling with the heart and right, Tangling his love in her loveless toils. I would not have him not to love Another, dearer life than mine: Let but a maiden worthy prove, And with his love my love shall twine To clothe her with a joy divine. But he esteems all women pure, Can spy no craft in looks demure, Holds them all angels good that pine For heaven in a world they strive to cure, And so I fear for him; I dread That he may set his love on one With little either of heart or head Save what he dowers her with, and run After a shadow in the sun, Only to learn his weary fate When the great heart is desolate, And the fire burns, and there is none Cometh to cheer him early or late. And once I feared that he had placed His all on such a chance. And she— The grand, fine lady, scarcely graced With outsides of hypocrisy— True to the flesh she seemed to be: And yet he made a god of her, And girt her with an atmosphere Of incense, light, and poesie— But the glory was all in the worshipper. 'Tis strange, the finest insight still Seems blindest to a woman's art. The base get love unto their fill; The noble thirst for that true heart Whereto they may their life impart, And find in it their solace meet: But clothing with their fancies sweet A wanton or a fool, they start To know in their love but their sorrow complete. Out of the world he lives afar In chivalrous ideal trust, Enshrining woman like a star For worship of the good and just, Where no unworthy thought or lust May enter with unhallowed tread; And though he has a sister made, Like other girls, of sorry dust, He never would see that our gold was but lead. Oh if men knew us only—knew The cowardice and common-place, The petty circle of our view, The meanness and the littleness That lie behind a pretty face! Thank heaven, I was not bred with girls, A thing of ribbons, scents and curls, And quaint in fancies of a dress, And gold and jewels and strings of pearls. Our mother trained me up with him To love the right, the truth to speak, The scholar's thoughtful lamp to trim, And trace the rhythm of numbered Greek, And in the world of God to seek Wisdom in knowledge of His ways, And gladness in the song of praise Which rises from the strong and weak To the Father that keepeth us all our days. And this, at least, I've learnt, that man Can be more godlike far than we, And never is more glorious than When bending low a suppliant knee In his pure-hearted chivalry, Entranced with his own spell of might, Blind with his own exuberant light, Lost in love's rapture and ecstasy, Which girls only trifle with, day and night. Therefore I fear his life may be A disenchantment day by day, A glory that he seems to see, Only to see it fade away: And then perchance he may not play The great part that he would in life, But waste him in a petty strife With little cares, and be the prey Of fretful thoughts, and a foolish wife. Then will he die, and leave no trace Of all the great work he has schemed; And men will say for such a race He had not trained, but only dreamed; And that pure light of heaven which streamed Along his morning pilgrimage, Broadening and brightening every stage, No forecast true shall be esteemed Of the battle which genius has to wage. Hence, idle fear! He's brave and true, With patient toil as well as fire; What fruitful effort can, he'll do To crown with triumph high desire, And make the wondering world admire, And win himself a lofty name.— Yet what were all the pride of Fame If he were linked in bondage dire To a heartless flirt, or a haughty dame! The Herr Professor says I'm not Just to the croqueting, crocheting kind Of girls; for they fulfil their lot Like flowers which want no subtle mind, But waft their sweetness on the wind, And flash their beauty on the eye, And bloom, and ripen, and then die; And they are lovely, and we are blind If we think that the world is not better thereby. Maybe I am not just to them; Maybe I ask more mind and heart; Maybe a woman, like a gem, Is but a bauble of precious art, And as a toy should play her part. God meant her for an help-meet true, But men have quite another view: Let her bright eyes like diamonds dart, And she may be hard as the diamond too. Yet one may harden, he avers, By thought as well as thoughtlessness; And women's minds may equal theirs, Have wit as keen, nor reason less; Only they will not bear the stress Of manly toil, and keep the good Pure quality of womanhood: And logic is not more than dress For the sweetening of life in its weary mood. The Herr Professor speaks indeed Many odd quips and crusty jokes. He vows that I have too much creed To have much faith; and daily shocks My thought with some mad paradox: And in the ancient truth he sees But an old bunch of rusty keys, Hung at the belt of the Orthodox, To open a dungeon which they call Peace. And yet I know he loveth much, And walks with God in truth and right; And if the world had many such, It were indeed a world of light, All radiant with a glory bright: And sometimes, in his quaintest words, He seems to touch the deepest chords, And with a master's skill and might Holds high discourse of the Lord of Lords. But, psha! what matters what he thinks? And yet why do my thoughts still veer, As drawn to him by subtle links Of yearning hope, and trembling fear How in his sight I shall appear? And wherefore do I watch for him In the elm-tree walk at evening dim, As he comes singing loud and clear A Burschen song, or a Luther hymn? Can this be love? and could I charge Thorold that he would by-and-by Love with a love more deep and large Than sister's love could satisfy? And all the while, alas! was I But taxing him to hide my own Lapse into passionate depths unknown? Nay, but this foolish thought would die If I were not left here brooding alone. And yet I know not. Heretofore I used to bring my thoughts to book, And opened every chamber door, And searched my soul through every nook; But into this I shrank to look: It came with silent, owly flight In the still quiet of the night; I heard the wind, I heard the brook, But the love slid into my soul like light. And when I found it nestling there, Like swallow twittering in the eaves, It felt like summer warm and fair, And blossomy spray, and fragrant leaves. A cosy nest my bright bird weaves— My bird which is but a German swallow, Guttural-speaking, big and sallow: Only his heart with great thought heaves, And there's nought in him little or poor or shallow. Am I ashamed to say I love, Yet proud of him I love so well? O strange proud shame? yet hand and glove Could fit no better, truth to tell. I used to laugh at girls who fell Blushing and lying time about, And sware I would love out and out, Or not at all; yet now the spell Holds me in transport and terror and doubt. What can it mean, this love and fear, This open shame and secret pride, The yearning gladness, and the tear That comes so often by its side; This thought we fondle while we hide, This trembling dread when he is late, And pouting joy that makes him wait, And passion passionately denied, And the feeling of overmastering Fate? I will to Thorold's room. Nay, that I may not. Last night I went there, And the pale moon in silence sat So ghostly on the great arm-chair, And the mice pattered here and there, And the wind in the chimney moaned, And the old pine at the window groaned, And something stepped the creaking stair.— I dare not sit in the room he owned. Come back, come back, my brother dear: The storm is gathering on thy way, And mine is no more calm and clear; The mist is creeping dull and gray O'er surfy beach, and troubled bay, And I am friendless and alone, And doubtful of myself, with none To counsel me; and day by day Fear is chilling my heart like stone. Am I grown fanciful, to muse On school-girl whimseys foolishly? What should I fear, except to lose The great true heart that loveth me Better than I deserve to be, With tender strength, and manly care, And modest hope his lot to share, And share his thoughts, too, high and free, And bear all the burden which he must bear? To mine own soul let me be true; I love my love by night and day, I love my love—the sound is new, But oh how sweet it is to say! I love my love—it is like play, But yet I love with heart and mind, And passion trembling, fond and blind; I love my love in Love's old way, And ever in loving new life I find. I cannot rest; he cometh not; And yet, a little while ago, What wildest fancy could have thought A day of tumult and of woe Among the peoples, stricken low, Who rose up in a wrath divine, On Seine, the Danube, and the Rhine, Would shoot, in that volcanic glow, A flame from their heart to kindle mine? I should as soon have looked to see Some bright star from the stormy heaven, Glide down to earth, and rest on me, From all its glorious comrades riven. So strangely fates are interwoven!— And how he loves his Deutsch-land dear, Its patient thought, that knows no fear, Its Luther, Goethe, Heine, given For lights to the ages far and near. I will go forth. The moonlight dim, Dusks with broad shade the silent hill; I will go up, and think of him, Where the old brook is tinkling still, With memories of our water mill;— I think he sometimes strolls that way, With pipe and book at evening gray; But memories of childhood will Pleasantly wind up a weary day. BOOK THIRD EDITORIAL Lady Anne Dewhurst on a crimson couch Lay, with a rug of sable o'er her knees, In a bright boudoir in Belgravia; Most perfectly arrayed in shapely robe Of sumptuous satin, lit up here and there With scarlet touches, and with costly lace Nice-fingered maidens knotted in Brabant: And all around her spread magnificence Of bronzes, Sevres vases, marquetrie, Rare buhl, and bric-à-brac of every kind, From Rome and Paris and the centuries Of far-off beauty. All of goodly colour, Or graceful form that could delight the eye, In orderly disorder lay around, And flowers with perfume scented the warm air. Stately and large and beautiful she was Spite of her sixty summers, with an eye Trained to soft languors, that could also flash, Keen as a sword and sharp—a black bright eye, Deep sunk beneath an arch of jet. She had A weary look, and yet the weariness Seemed not so native as the worldliness Which blended with it. Weary and worldly, she Had quite resigned herself to misery In this sad vale of tears, but fully meant To nurse her sorrow in a sumptuous fashion, And make it an expensive luxury; For nothing she esteemed that nothing cost. Beside her, on a table round, inlaid With precious stones by Roman art designed, Lay phials, scents, a novel and a Bible, A pill box, and a wine glass, and a book On the Apocalypse; for she was much Addicted unto physic and religion, And her physician had prescribed for her Jellies and wines and cheerful Literature. The book on the Apocalypse was writ By her chosen pastor, and she took the novel With the dry sherry, and the pills prescribed. A gorgeous, pious, comfortable life Of misery she lived; and all the sins Of all her house, and all the nation's sins, And all shortcomings of the Church and State, And all the sins of all the world beside, Bore as her special cross, confessing them Vicariously day by day, and then She comforted her heart, which needed it, With bric-à-brac and jelly and old wine. Beside the fire, her elbow on the mantel, And forehead resting on her finger-tips, Shading a face where sometimes loomed a frown, And sometimes flashed a gleam of bitter scorn, Her daughter stood; no more a graceful girl, But in the glory of her womanhood, Stately and haughty. One who might have been A noble woman in a nobler world, But now was only woman of her world, With just enough of better thought to know It was not noble, and despise it all, And most herself for making it her all. Awoman, complex, intricate, involved; Wrestling with self, yet still by self subdued; Scorning herself for being what she was, And yet unable to be that she would; Uneasy with the sense of possible good Never attained, nor sought, except in fits Ending in failures; conscious, too, of power Which found no purpose to direct its force, And so came back upon herself, and grew An inward fret. The caged bird sometimes dashed Against the wires, and sometimes sat and pined, But mainly pecked her sugar, and eyed her glass, And trilled her graver thoughts away in song. Mother and daughter—yet a childless mother, And motherless her daughter; for the world Had gashed a chasm between, impassable, And they had nought in common, neither love, Nor hate, nor anything except a name. Yet both were of the world; and she not least Whose world was the religious one, and stretched A kind of isthmus 'tween the Devil and God, A slimy, oozy mud, where mandrakes grew, Ghastly, with intertwisted roots, and things Amphibious haunted, and the leathern bat Flickered about its twilight evermore. LOQUITUR MATER DOMINA So, there you are at last. Please draw That odious curtain, will you? Do. A hideous thing as e'er I saw! It gives one such a corpse-like hue. But I might be a corpse for you: It's little any of you cares How your heart-broken mother fares, Burdened with sorrows old and new, As the world entangles you all in its snares. Please, no excuse: it does no good. Of course, you have your morning calls, Your shopping, and your listless mood After late dinners, drums, and balls; My world is these four dreary walls, My body, but an aching back, My life, a torture on the rack, My thoughts, like dizzying water-falls That never will silence, or change, or slack. I get my jellies, soups, and stews, My little wine—what need I more? My morning paper with the news That everybody knew before. I hear the street calls, and the roar Of the town traffic, and the clash Of milk-bells, and the angry crash Of brass bands, and the drowsy snore Of an organ as dull as the flat seawash. And then the night falls, and the clock Ticks on the mantel, and the wheels Crunch the hard gravel, as the flock Of weary revellers homeward reels, Until the opal morning steals Up in the sky. So, day by day, My life crawls on its weary way; No hope it stirs, no joy it feels; But it's all like a foggy November day: A grey fog in the early prime, A blue fog by the breakfast hour, A saffron fog at luncheon time, At dinner a persistent shower Of smut, and then a dismal power Of choking darkness and despair Thickening and soddening all the air:— But we are all a fading flower, And life is a burden of sorrow and care. I don't complain; it is the lot Appointed me by wisdom best: 'Tis meet that I should be forgot By all of you, and learn to rest Content, while ye have mirth and jest, And I religion. Still I feel; I hide the wounds I cannot heal, I keep my sorrow unexpressed— But I'm not quite so hard as a lump of steel. My nerves are not just wires and cords, I'm not a mere rhinoceros Where arrows stick as in deal boards, And bullets fall as soft as moss. My patient heart can bear its cross, And bleed unseen—but yet it bleeds, And all the more that no one heeds, And all the more to see your loss Of sound evangelical views and creeds. Oh, were I only dead and gone! It's hard to live, and see the way That all of you are hurrying on Blindly unto the dreadful day. You prate of fossils, while I pray, And beetles occupy your heart More than your own Immortal part: Your father's hairs are turning grey, In this impious babble of science and art. Poor fools! that fain would break a spear With Moses and the Pentateuch, And only blinded reason hear, And will no revelation brook, Nor miracle nor inspired Book! But for some sweet refreshing showers Of doctrine, during Sabbath hours, 'Twould break my heart on you to look; But the Book and Day are still happily ours. Ah! what were life without the Book? And what this world without its story? And what were man if he forsook The Sabbath, foretaste of Heaven's glory! A den of wild beasts, dark and gory! A being quite devoid of grace, A heathen with a tattooed face, That burns his widows! I implore you, Set your heart, Rose, in the proper place. But you have no religion—none. It is the heart that's wrong, my dear: If you had not a heart of stone, You could not leave me lonely here.— And men may do, who have not clear Decided views; they go about The clubs, and hear who's in and out, And which is “Favourite” this year, And bet, and are dreadfully wicked, no doubt. But women who have lost their Faith Are angels who have lost their wings, And always have a nasty breath Of chemistry, and horrid things That go off when a lecturer rings His bell.—But they will not go off; They take a mission or a cough; For men will marry a fool that sings Sooner than one that has learnt to scoff. You don't believe me: you go in For science, culture, common-sense, And think a woman sure to win Because she knows the why and whence, And looks at vermin through a lens: And yet you've seen a score of girls With empty heads and silly curls, And laughter light, and judgment dense, Wedded to Marquises, Dukes, and Earls. And why? They started fair with you: You dressed as well—for that was mine; You were as handsome and well-born, too, And you had wit like sparkling wine: But they all took to things divine Like sober, pious girls. I know That some were High Church, and would go, Like nuns, with beads and crosses fine— But they all were wives in a season or so. Men may be bad, but still they like A pious wife that lives for heaven; Your wit may shine, your beauty strike, But not to these their love is given. Ah! had you with your prayer-book driven To church, and kept a Sunday-school, And visited, and lived by rule— But that is past and all forgiven, Though you played your cards like a perfect fool. You cannot be a hypocrite, To mumble out a false remorse, And wear a look of prim conceit Only to be the winning horse?— Of course, you cannot, and of course I never meant you should. But yet, You might feel true grief and regret For sin; and could be none the worse For the strawberry leaves in a coronet. You wonder at me, with my views Of doctrine sound, and worship pure, That I should plead the least excuse For girls whom Romish arts allure, Through Ritualism to Babylon sure. But did I say their views were right? Or did I call their darkness light? Or did I only try to cure Your heart, which is turned from the Gospel quite? It's grace you need, Rose, to illume Your darken'd nature. What an age Since I have seen you in my room! Though I have nothing to engage My thoughts, except the sacred page, And that sweet book which is so clear Upon the Beast and his numbered year:— Yet all the while there's quite a rage For some wonderful May-fair novel, I hear. And after all I have done for you!— But daughters are not what they were, And you are only proving true What all the Prophets do aver. Oh had you heard our minister Upon The Signs of the End, and how The children of the saints shall grow Still wickeder and wickeder!— Till all to the Beast and the Woman shall bow. That is the worst part of my trial: But prophecy must be fulfilled, And we are in the Seventh Vial, The Witnesses will soon be killed, And all the land with blood be filled And Papists; and a cruel fate Shall separate the Church and State, And then more blood is to be spilled By the Frogs,—that's your Radical friends of late. It's clear the Woman and the Beast Are Buonaparté and the Pope; The Prophets won't explain the least Without them; they're the merest rope Of sand in that case: and I hope I know my Bible. Still the Book Is sealed, and you shall vainly look To find its meaning and its scope, If the Jews don't return, and the Pentateuch. Ah, we had such a sermon on it!— The Vicar's wife she was not there; She had not got her new spring bonnet— But all the world was. Do you care For the new mode? You blondes must wear Pink, shaped like tiny little shells; So natural! with silver bells.— But that great sermon! I declare, I can't for the world think of anything else. So searching and pathetic! He Soaked two clean handker chiefs in tears, While clearing up the prophecy, The mystic number, and the years, And Daniel: and it still appears That this Napoleon is the Beast That was and wasn't, you know; at least The Armageddon swords and spears Were long ago shipped from Marseilles to the East. Nay, tell me not you do not care Although the end of the world were come. It's very wicked to despair; You should be gentle, patient, dumb, Thinking that any day the hum Of myriad angels, leading saintly crowds, With rainbow trimmings round their shrouds, May greet you at a kettle-drum, Coming in glory among the clouds. We live in wondrous times; such times The world has never seen before; With earthquakes in the tropic climes, And kingdoms shaken to the core, And revolutions at our door; And Kings and Queens discrowned appear In London every other year, While Barons clothed in rags implore You to buy pens and sealing-wax, dreadful dear. And Ritualists our Church defile, And Rationalists our faith deny, And Papist nuns and chaplains wile Our very thieves in gaol. And I Went to a chapel once hard by, And heard a Nonconformist say The Sabbath was a mere Jewish day! I left, of course, and had to fly In the rain, but I hailed a cab by the way. And there's your “Robertson of Brighton,” He's lying now on every table, With Ecce Homo to enlighten Our carnal hearts, and minds unstable. We have no anchor now or cable; Our admirable Liturgy, Our very Bible is not free From criticism lamentable; And everybody is all at sea. What next? The land is rotten quite, And infidel and Papist too: There's Gladstone ruled by Mr. Bright, The very Bishops hardly true, And the Queen knows not what to do. But prophecy is coming clear, The awful end is drawing near, And bitterly this land will rue The way it has treated the Jews, I fear. Last week our Vicar plainly told— He's a converted Jew, I know— How seven fine ladies should lay hold Even on the man that cries “Old Clo',” To save them in the day of woe; And proved it from the Prophets clear. So then I thought I'd ask you, dear,— The poor man looked so shabby and low— If you knew any Jew of the better class here. For though all Israel shall be saved, And all the lost tribes found again, And all be proper and well-behaved, And all be free from sorrow and pain; Yet even in heaven it is quite plain, As stars with different glory shine, There shall be people poor and fine, For perfect order there shall reign: And one would not like to go over the line. You did not come to speak of Jews— They're Charlie's friends, and he can tell; Nor yet about the Vicar's views Of millenarian heaven or hell:— My dear, that's hardly spoken well. But what, then, did you come about? A call, a lecture, or a rout? A flower, a beetle, or a shell? Or a prodigy found in some country lout? Eh! What say you? That puling boy With the Scotch brogue and hungry look? Your genius whom you made a toy Last winter at your drums, and took About with you by hook or crook! Tush, tush! I do not like your set; But what's come of the baronet? As for the writer of a book, You're not come quite to the curates yet. Oh yes, you love him; that's of course:— It's your fifth season, isn't it, dear? But really you are little worse:— And I am sure you loved last year, Sir Wilfred with his rent-roll clear.— A person at St. John's Wood? Shame! No proper girl should ever name A person there or person here; And, no doubt, she is the one to blame. They always are, these creatures. Ah! This wicked world we're living in! There should be some severer law For low-born creatures who would win Youth over to the ways of sin. But there's that shameful act which frees Their vice from want and from disease, Although they neither toil nor spin,— Right in the face of all heaven's decrees. It's shameful, shocking; quite enough To bring down on us wrath divine; I don't care for their facts and stuff, I won't believe a single line. I know it's sin. And I opine Gladstone our morals means to sap And then, his wickedness to cap, The House of Lords he'll undermine And bring in the Pope like a thunderclap. All men are dreadful wicked. Sad It is to say it; but it's true; You hardly would believe how bad; So bad that it would never do If girls before their marriage knew. And if you will be prude and nice, And yet go poking into vice, And shying when it comes in view, You will never be married at any price. Now, hear me, Rose: give up at once Your silly fancy for this boy Whom you have led an idle dance, I daresay, only to annoy Sir Wilfred; and for once employ The arts that others use for sin His erring heart again to win Back to a purer life and joy, Which you're certain to do if you'll just begin. Be patient now; leave all to me; Don't fly off in a girlish huff. You'll need a new dress—let me see— Of some soft, lustrous, dainty stuff; Made Christian-like and low enough— You did not get a bust like this To hide like some raw country miss— Say poplin of a delicate buff; With Honiton lace, for a taste like his; You never yet knew how to dress, You never have a gown to fit, Your things are always in a mess That's shocking, even to look at it; Your colours somehow never hit, They never match themselves nor you; They're always out of fashion too; And as for gloves, you must admit They're just the one thing that you cannot do. Anyhow, leave all that to me. Could I but see you settled well, As, sure, my daughter ought to be, I'd die in peace unspeakable. Why am I here? why do I dwell In this unhappy world? unless, To help my children, and express Undying faith in principle— Though I don't like your baronet's quite, I confess. He wants to open the Museum Upon the blessed Sabbath-day; He wants the bands to play “Te Deum” When we should go to church and pray; It will be masses next, I say;— His views of sin are far from sound, Eternal punishment, I found, He will not hear of; and his way Is altogether on dangerous ground. But then, woe's me! you're all the same; All turned from Bible-teaching quite, All snared in folly, sin, and shame, And blinded to the only light. And he at least is of the right Old blood, and has an income nice, And never touches cards or dice Or horses. It's a happy sight, A man of his rank with a single vice. It's wonderful, most wonderful, The times we're living in! And yet We're born, and christened, and go to school, And marry Lord or Baronet, And dress and dine, and vex and fret, And strive the tide of Fate to stem Which Prophets had revealed to them, And never think the times are set For the Jews going back to Jerusalem. The Prophets say that there shall be A Highway and a Way: we read Also of ships upon the sea, Made of bulrushes; and we need, Unless you think I'm blind indeed, Unless I'm blinder than a bat, No prophet to interpret that, With a steam-boat running at full speed On the Suez Canal, like a water-rat. There could not be a clearer sign That now the end draws near in view, And that it's Providence' design To bring deliverance to the Jew, And break their bonds.—Now, shame on you! To scoff with your unhallowed wit; There's almost blasphemy in it:— I don't mean bonds of I.O.U., Such as Charlie gives when he's badly hit. But wherefore speak of things like these To things like you, who heed no more The murmur of prophetic breeze Than creaking of a rusty door? You walk along the solemn shore Washed by the tide of awful doom, While lights and shadows flash and gloom And neither wonder nor adore, But stamp and “pshaw” through the drawing-room. BOOK FOURTH EDITORIAL I will not answer for my wife's reports; Quite true, no doubt, in the main, as true at least As the most excellent women can report People they don't much like; not meant to bear Lawyer's cross-questioning, which they detest With a good conscience, conscious that they speak True to the idea, if the facts hang loose At one point, at another have been joined Ingeniously. Men are so troublesome! Rose was not faultless, as her lovers swore, Nor yet so faulty as my Hester thought: Women judge women hardly; hit perchance The likeness true enough by instinct keen That, piecing trivial incidents, detects The soul of character; but they have no shading, No softening tints, no generous allowance For circumstance, to make the picture human, And true because so human. Rose was human; And for a woman born of such a mother, And for a woman reared in such a world, And for a woman dowered with queenly beauty Set out for sale, and buzzed by flatterers All her life long, was even womanly, And better truly than she might have been. So stately as she left my lady's chamber, Her full eyes flashing scorn, yet with her scorn Contending to retain a mother still, If no more shrined in natural reverence, Yet cloaked with charity. But in the hall Her heart failed, and she pressed her forehead flushed On the cold fluting of a marble pillar, And wept to feel her life so desolate, And wept still more because the world had made it So desolate, yet was the world her all; She loathed it, but she knew it was her all. Thus she with passionate rebellion wept, Printing the fluted pillar on her brow, And then with weary, lifeless steps she went Heavily to her father's chamber door. The Squire was banished to a little room That overlooked a paved court and a mews. A small, close chamber, lined with dusty books And dingy maps; and savage crania Grinned from high shelves, with clubs and arrow-heads And tools of flint, and shields of hide embossed. There were great cobwebs on the windows dim, Where bloated spiders watched their webs, and heard The blue-fly knock his head against the pane, And buzz about their snares. And through the room, On table and chair, were globes and glasses tall, Retorts and crucibles, electric jars And batteries, and microscopes and prisms And balances, and fossil plants and shells, Disorderly and dusty; and the floor Was carpeted with papers and thick-dust,— Papers and books and instruments and dust. A grey old man sat in that dim grey room Wrapt in a dressing-gown of soft grey stuff, And puzzling o'er a paper wearily Of circles, squares and pentagons, and lines Of logarithms, he strove to disentangle. He was a little, brisk, bald-headed man, With fiery eyes, and forehead narrow and high And far-retiring: one who could have led A regiment to the belching cannon's mouth If wisely ordered when; or might have headed The cheery hunt across the stubble field, Taking the fences gallantly, nor turning From the wide brook to seek the safer ford. But being held in London half the year, And with no taste for politics or fashion, Or such religion as he came across, He took to Science, made experiments, Bought many nice and costly instruments, Heard lectures, and believed he understood Beetle-browed Science wrestling with the fact To find its meaning clear; but all in vain. He thought he thought, and yet he did not think, But only echoed still the common thought, As might an empty room. The forehead high And fiery eye had no reflexion in them To brood and hatch the secret of the world. He could but skim and dip, like restless swallow Fly-catching on the surface of all knowledge Anthropologic and Botanical And Chemical, and what was last set forth By charlatan to stun the vulgar sense. But yet a strain of noble chivalry Ran through his nature, and a faint crisp humour Rippled his thought, and would have been a joy Had life been kindlier; but his cheeriest smile Verged on a sneer, and ran to mocking laughter. Yet under all his pottering at science, And deeper than his feeble cynic sneer, Lay a great love, to which he fondly clung, For Rose, the stately daughter of his house. LOQUITUR PATER I will not hear of it. No more; Besides, I'm busy, as I said; You come and knock, knock at my door, And drive all thought clean from my head, Just when at last I've caught the thread, Subtle and brittle and sought-for long, That would most surely bind a throng Of facts together, firmly wed By doctrine of Science clear and strong. I labour and experiment, I methodise and meditate, I watch the bias and the bent Of the mind's idols. Still I wait And verify and speculate, When rat-tat-tat! my mind's a blank; My thread of thought, a tangled hank; My ordered facts, confusion great;— And it's always you women I have to thank. You've heard of Newton's dog that spoiled The calculations of long years, And of that brutish maid whose soiled And sooty fingers used the tears Of genius and its hopes and fears, Page after page, to light her fire— A horrible and impious pyre! So all my laboured thought appears To melt, like the snow, into slush and mire. I say it's worse than Suttee, or The sacrifice of beautiful youth, This waste of thought long-waited for, This fruitless birth of still-born truth. What matters for the silly, smooth, Meaningless face of widow trim, Slow roasting to a drowsy hymn? But you do rob the world in sooth, When the lights of Science are quenched or dim. Is't not enough to have your maids Scrubbing and brooming at my door, With whispers shrill, and sudden raids On cobwebs that have taught me more Wisdom and beauty, than a score Of chattering girls? Only last night I found my favourite beetle quite Crushed and mangled upon the floor; And the jade held to it she did quite right. A plague on maids! and him who first Invented them! They're all the same. I've tried them saucy, tried them curst, I've tried them sluts, and tried to tame Their natural instincts, and to shame Their ignorance, and to abate Their furious and unfeeling hate Of fellow-creatures; but my claim Was vain as appeal to the wheels of Fate. Whate'er they do not understand Is dirt, and must be brushed away; They'd broom all science from the land And scour from heaven the Milky Way. I plan by night, I work by day With chemic and electric Force, And tremble as I watch the course Of Nature; all in vain, for they Baffle in some way my best resource. And now you come, like all the rest, My daughter, but a woman still, My daughter, whom I thought the best Of possible daughters, trained with skill, And schooled in Science to fulfil The part of Cuvier's daughter true; And when I hope and trust in you, You fall in love, and coo and bill, And want to know what I mean to do. Of course, the fellow came to me, And talked of marriage, love, and trash, As if he thought I did not see He meant just settlements and cash. But there's my banker gone to smash, Shares fallen to nothing, farmers' rents Begged off, and half my Three per Cents Gone to save Charlie from a smash; And where is the money for settlements? O yes! He did not care for that, He did not woo you for your gold, He wished for nothing, cared not what You brought or did not bring him; told His means and prospects, and was bold To think that love like his and yours, Would work miraculous works and cures, Keep you from hunger, debt, and cold, And all the evils that man endures. The old story, Rose; the silly stuff Of fools and beggars superfine! Why! he has hardly means enough To keep you in gloves and flowers and wine. You could not dress, you could not dine, You could not keep a maid or horse, Or drive but in a cab, or worse;— The man's a fool; no child of mine Could marry a beggar like him, of course. I marvel at his impudence; A fellow with some paltry three Hundred a-year! A grain of sense— But that he hasn't—had made him see The silliness of plaguing me. His genius and his prospects! Well; Can you eat prospects? Will they sell? And will his trumpery genius be A dinner, or only a dinner-bell? There there; don't cry: I do not mean He is not all that you would say— A handsome fellow, as I've seen, And true and modest in his way: And it is hard to say you nay; Yet why should your old father lose His one ewe-lamb? Why, should he choose To steal my only joy away, Since Charlie went to the dogs and Jews? And that reminds me, Charlie says Your friend's a screw, and awful close: But then he's poor, and no doubt pays His way, which Charlie never does. That makes a difference, for those May freely give and lend, whose purse Is shut to all their creditors. I wish I knew their secret, Rose, How never to pay, and be never the worse. Well, yes; I liked him, as you say, And praised him to my friends; and he May wed their daughters any day He likes,—that's no concern to me. But this I could not bear to see, My Rose stuck in his button-hole, And shunned, like any stainèd soul, By a world that hates all poverty— And the world is perfectly right, on the whole. But tush! with marriage and affiance; The Medium waits me at the door, That Pythoness of modern science, Who brings back Intellect once more To hear and wonder and adore. She photographed by electric light My old Grandmother's ghost last night, The very cap and wig she wore, While the spirit sat by me there bolt upright. I did not see Her; but I saw The portrait like as like could be, And felt a kind of creeping awe, And old religion back in me; A hand was laid upon my knee, And there was music in the air, The very song she whiled my care Away with in my infancy; And she lives in some kind of a sphere somewhere. And conscience twitched me, like a spasm, For hitherto I had no faith In anything but protoplasm; I held that spirit was but breath, And all the Future silent death. And what, if Science shall restore The faith it robbed me of before? For call it spirit, ghost, or wraith, One was there who did not come in by the door. It's wonderful what now we do; This is a mighty age indeed, With march of Intellect so true, From prejudice and bondage freed, And pious fraud, and worn-out creed! We weigh the farthest stars in scales, We comprehend the wandering gales, We summon spirits at our need From the shadowy world which love bewails. I don't deny, that heretofore The spirits have not much to tell, That Shakespeare's something of a bore, That Milton proses about Hell, That Scott has lost his wizard spell, That Plato has forgot his Greek, That Byron's dull, and Goethe weak; But then, deal tables could not well Utter the thoughts they might wish to speak. We wait for better instruments— Wind harps to suit the spirit hand, Sweet lutes to place beside the rents In the dim walls of the spirit-land. No Maestro with his cunning wand Beethoven's symphonies could get From bones and bagpipes. We are yet But groping 'mong the secrets grand Of the mystic spiritual Alphabet. At any rate, this is the age Of miracles proper,—wonders done By careful reading the dark page Of Nature, searching one by one Her secrets till there shall be none. And he who reads them is the true Prophet-Apostle of this new Annus mirabilis, whose sun Shines its great light now on me and you. Wonders of Science! marvels high, Beyond our wildest dream or hope, Found in the sunlight and the sky By spectroscope and telescope! Miracles in a dirty drop Of water from a stagnant pool! And every lichened rock is full Of history; and there's a crop Of marvels now in a table or stool! Now, go to your mother, Rose, she'll give Excellent counsel in Heaven's name; Right worldly wisdom, as I live, And all in pious phrase and frame. I wish I knew that little game, It is a secret worth the knowing, To clothe with Scripture language glowing The devil's plain common-sense, and claim The Word of truth for truth's o'er-throwing. What? You have only come from her? Well, I'm a beast, a perfect brute, To fret and fume and stamp and stir With fretful word, and angry foot, While my poor girl stands still and mute, With that taste in her mouth, where all Nauseous bitters scriptural Are mingled by a branch-and-root Right Low-church Evangelical. But come, now, tell me what she said. Yet what needs asking that? Of course, Her heart was broken, and she prayed For “Death” to come on his pale horse, And all the world was waxing worse; And then she blamed your wicked views And touched upon the elected Jews Going to Zion back in force— And they can't go sooner than I would choose. And still beneath the grieving saint, You found the nether millstone hard; She's not a fool, nor given to faint, But maundered nonsense by the yard, Until she had you off your guard, Then lisped soft words that stung you sore, And hints that maddened you still more. You bit the peach and for reward Cracked your teeth on the stony core. I know it all; the winding stream Of pious babble linked along, As loose as some fantastic dream, Oblivious of all right and wrong, Here swirling round in eddies strong 'Neath twisted roots of old dead thought, There slushing among mud and rot, And chill as salt and snow among The tremblings of feeling highly wrought. Our modern science has not left A leg for faith to stand upon; Of all its miracles bereft, Its history to myth all gone; Yet would it surely hold its own But for that nether millstone bit That lieth in the heart of it. A little mercy would atone For failure of reason, and lack of wit. She is your mother, and my wife? Well, yes! and may be I have been No wise guide for a troubled life, To lead it to the peace serene. A brighter girl was never seen; There's none of you who may compare, A moment, with her beauty rare, Her perfect sense, and insight keen.— How she headed the hunt on that wild black mare! Ah! well; that's past. And I am vexed If I have added to your pain. I did not mean it. I'm perplexed With Charlie's gambling debts again. Do what I will, 'tis all in vain: He plays to-night, and prays tomorrow, Now tries to preach, and now to borrow Among the Jews; and then is fain To come to me when he comes to sorrow. Now, kiss me, Rose, and let me go; And put this business quite away Out of your thoughts. You surely know. 'Tis easier far for me to say A yea to any one than nay; And yea to thee, was pleasant still, And nay, against my heart and will; But it would quench my light of day, If aught should happen to thee of ill. Even when you leave me for a home, Happy and honoured, it will be The last bright day shall ever come With sunshine to my home and me; And the years afterwards will flee Like drift of dry and barren sand Along the shore, between the land And the low moaning of the sea That creeps with the great mist, hand in hand. If you had loved with love supreme, Which to itself is all in all; If you were lapt in blissful dream, Which wakens not at any call, But still loves on whate'er befall; If worldly custom, pride, and show, And all your wonted life might flow Past you unheeded, and the small Tattle of fools, like the winds that blow; If I could think you loved like this, And had no half-heart for the world, If perfect Love were perfect bliss, Whose spotless flag you had unfurled, And its serene defiance hurled At toil, contempt, and hardships great— But you have ne'er confronted Fate: Your love is rosy, scented, curled, And dreams of a carriage, and man to wait. My dear, you know it not; but yet That is the truth; I've read your heart: You are no heroine; you would fret To play a common, obscure part, To watch the coming baker's cart, To tremble at the butcher's bill, To patch and darn and hem, and still To make yourself look neat and smart In a twopenny print and a muslin frill. There's nothing of the hero, Rose, In any of us. We could fight, I daresay, if it came to blows, Almost like the old Norman knight Who won our lands—Heaven bless his might! We could not win them if we tried— We can but shoot and fish and ride, And lightly spend what came so light, And I don't know we can do ought beside. Indeed, you must not think of it. For us there's nought but common-place. A dinner good, a dress to fit, A ride to hunt, a pretty lace, Old wine, old china, and old lace: We can no more. I've tried to know Science, but Science will not show Her secrets to the trifling race Of Dilettanti, brisk or slow. You don't like this, you don't like that; You don't like horsey-hunting squires, You don't like parsons sleek and fat, You don't like those whose only fires Are the quenched ashes of their sires: Nor do you love this Thorold so, That you with him, like Eve, would go Into a world of thorns and briers, Glad to be with him in weal or woe. That is the curse upon us, Rose; We cannot dare a noble fate, And yet our hearts find no repose In all our empty show and state: We can be neither small nor great; With strong desire and feeble power We hanker through our weary hour, Like flowers that try to blossom late, In a sickly struggle with frost and shower. Our race is run: the Norman knight Is distanced by the engineer; The cotton-spinner beats us quite When all the battle is to clear A hundred thousand pounds a-year: That is the glory of our age, Six figures on the Ledger's page— And no bad glory either, dear, As glory goes among saint and sage. Our life is all a poor illusion, And nothing is that seems to be; Our knowledge only breeds confusion, Our love is moonshine on the sea, Our faith is but the shadow we Cast on the cloud that bounds our view; And to be virtuous and true Is trouble, plague, and misery, If we have not the funds when the bills come due. BOOK FIFTH EDITORIAL Dressed, like a penitent, in sombre black That hung about her limp and scrimp, and all Without relief of ribbon, lace, or tucker, Collar, or cuff, or any lightsome thing; Her hair, that wont in regal braid to fold A shining coronet around her brow, Stuffed loosely in a net; nor ring nor jewel Gracing the hand that trembled as it lifted A book, a pencil, or an ornament, And could not help but lift them; so arrayed, A nun-like woman over all dull and sad, In tragic dress of studied negligence, Which covered not the less a tragic pain,— For there are souls that live in symbolisms, And are most true in most dramatic seeming,— Thus Rose awaited for the sacrifice. She could not rest, but paced about the room; Now drawing curtains close, to dim the light; Now watching the slow movement of the clock, Uncertain whether to chide its tardy pace, Or its unfeeling haste; now sitting down, Holding her side, or white, spasm-choking throat; And anon starting up to stamp and frown, With flashing look defiant, saying “I will”; But soon she drooped her head, and sobbed, “I cannot; God, pity me, a creature pitiful; I dare not say, God help me, for this business Is one He cannot help in. I am to choose Deliberately the mean life I have proven, And knowing it so hollow, heartless, vain, And knowing, too, the better life of love, And knowing it may break a noble heart, And make mine own a lean and barren heart, I am to seal a covenant with darkness, And sign mine own death-warrant. Can I do it? Is there no hope, no other way but this, As they all tell me?—how I hate them all! Why was there none to back my better thought, And help the struggling spirit to do right? O father, mother, brother, why do all Forsake me? ply me so with reasons strong To play the baser part? Was ever girl So hard beset with preachers of a lie? Was ever girl so drawn by cords of love To break the cord of Love? Or can it be, As they do all aver, and I myself Half feel, yet hate myself for feeling it, That this poor world of Custom is my Fate; That I must be what yet I scorn to be; That empty as it is, it is my all; That I should only wreck another soul, Trying another life;—that I have lost, With their upbringing, simple womanhood And patient strength of love? Too late, too late! That is his step, his ring. I know them well, As the fond wife her husband's foot-fall kens, Home-coming while she watches for his coming. Ah me! how often I have sat intent To hear it, while they thought I heeded them Dully haw-hawing, which he never did; Stupidly flattering, which he never did; Or peddling in the devil's small-ware, gossip And innuendo, which he never did; For he is gracious, generous, and true: And all the time my spirit was not here, But hovering by the door, and out and in, And, hungering for him, hated them the more. And now I shake and shiver like a rush To hear the step which I shall hear no more. No more! he will not see me any more! No more! and I must snap with mine own hand The gold-thread in my life, and make it all Leaden and passionless for evermore! I hate it all; I'll do some wicked thing, I know, ere all is ended. How I dread The future they have fashioned out for me, And fierce rebellion of the best in me Against the doing what is bound on me! Heaven help me to be true at least to him When falsest to myself; my way is hard.” Then she sat down, and was composed and calm To look at, as a marble monument. LOQUITUR ROSE Nay, sit down there, and touch me not: I am not worthy; and I feel In my shamed soul the leprous spot Burn in thy presence. I would kneel, Or put my neck beneath thy heel, If Nature had her way, and youth Its old simplicity and truth: But the wolf's gnawing we conceal 'Neath a surface passionless, bland, and smooth. No more ashamed of doing wrong, We are ashamed of feeling right, Ashamed of any feeling strong, And of all shame ashamèd quite: And I am like the rest; the light Laughter of fools arrests my shame And self-contempt and bitter blame: So we must meet as if the might Of passion and pain were an empty name. Ah me! 'tis hard for me to speak, And will be hard for you to hear; Yet do not comfort me, nor seek To soothe one pang or stay one tear.— No fear of that, alas! no fear; More like to scorn me for the lot Which I have chosen; yet scorn me not; I've been so happy, being so dear; Yet I'd rather be hated than quite forgot. I've been so happy, and can be No more as I have been again; And my most cherished memory Henceforth shall be my keenest pain. I have been loved; that will remain The treasured thought of all my prime, The treasured grief of all my time; And I have loved, and not in vain, Though my Love, in Love's vision, was almost crime. I loved above myself—above Mine own capacity of soul, As one that with an earthly love Seeks Heaven, yet spurns its high control. I did aspire unto the rôle Of a great blessedness, unmeet For such as me. 'Twas very sweet, While the dream lasted round and whole, But the sorrow of waking is more complete. Yet do not let me wholly pass Out of your mind, though I must be Apart from your true life, alas! And from a meaner level see, As one looks where the stars go free, Its struggle brave and triumph great, For you will strive and conquer Fate: And think not bitterly of me When you take to your bosom a worthier mate. But let me speak all I must say, For I must say it, though my heart Protests with an indignant nay! And loathes to play the ignoble part. Ignoble it is: I have no art To picture wrong as it were right; But if I sin I sin outright, And know it sin, and know the smart Will follow as surely as day and night. I hate a sham; let bad be bad, And good be good for evermore: Who doeth right, let him be glad, Knowing the good he liveth for; Who doeth wrong, let him, too, pour Unshrinking light upon his ill, And do it with determined will:— Our devil clings to his rôle of yore, And is fain to play the good angel still. I had a schoolmate once—a girl Much like myself, not very good, Nor very bad; no precious pearl, Or perfect flower of womanhood; But one that graced and understood Our pleasant, artificial life, And would have made a charming wife, Had she been only gaily wooed By a fine red-coat and a drum and fife. But there came one across her way— A Priest: a grave, high-thoughted man, Who did not lag behind his day, But bravely dared to lead the van Of Progress: with a lofty plan, Not counting for himself the price, Up the great stair of Sacrifice, Trod by the meek and lowly One, He would lead our gay world into Paradise. He came across her path, and she Caught up his dream, and dreamt awhile; She came across his path, and he Found dreams angelic in her smile; He had no knowledge, she no guile:— Leave that to satire-novels; both But dreamt a happy dream, not loath; There was no woman's art or wile When she gave to him freely her plighted troth. And for a while she strove to live His life, and meekly played her part; And for a while she tried to give Not service only, but her heart To sacred work and thought and art; To help the poor, the sick to cheer, And breathe sweet love instead of fear Into our worship, and impart To all men the feeling that God was near. Why do I dwell on this? Because 'Twas not herself, but he that spoke In her. And soon there came a pause In her hot zeal. The spell was broke, And once more, her old self awoke With yearning for the former days, The laughter crisp, the empty praise, The dressing, dancing, and the flock Of butterflies sunning them in her rays. Then by and by, in her old place We met her; first, a matron meek, Come to diffuse a light of grace; But for this task she was too weak, When guardsmen gathered round to seek The old smiles, and the banter light, And midnight chatter sparkling bright With airy bubbles; while a bleak Loneliness reigned in her home all night. What would you? There was nothing wrong In our sense, only flirting gay. Meanwhile the grave priest went along, With heavy heart, his weary way, Heavier-hearted every day, Till, as a shield for her good name, Weary and dreary he, too, came To ball and rout and drum and play; And she squandered his life in her reckless game. His vow to cherish her he deemed First of all duties binding; so The glorious dream which he had dreamed Of a great battle with sin and woe, And dealing them a deadly blow, With a brave woman by his side, Became a mournful strife to hide A broken heart, nor let her know How the hope and the light of his life had died. Now, hear me: I too had my dream, The which I fondled day and night, It shed upon my life the gleam Of a new world of truth and right; Nor all in vain, for in its light I see as I had never seen Before; I see that life is mean Without the purpose and the might Of a noble Faith, and a Hope serene. And yet 'tis but a dream with me, Vague, feeble, and unsolid: I Am of the world, worldly; I can see; Admiring still, the vision high, And feel the sentiment and sigh Of truer nature in my breast, Our artificial world confessed A proven vanity and lie,— But the owl sees the sunshine and winks in its nest. I am not fit to live your life, I am not meet to share your thought, I am not able for the strife Of any high and glorious lot, I am not worthy to be brought Into companionship of those Who heed not custom as it goes, Who heed not what opinions float, Who heed but the light that high Reason throws. I will not be to you a care, A burden only changed for death; I will not be to you a snare, As she was to the Priest of Faith; You shall not tremble lest the breath Of slander dim a wife's pure name, And feeling shame deny the shame, And sadly smiling bear the scaith Of a nature too shallow to get much blame. Nay, think not these are motives good Framed but to hide the ill I do, Nor drive me to a bitter mood When my sore heart would most be true And faithful and tender unto you. I have done wrong, and hide it not, But yet it was not in my thought; And bitterly your heart would rue Blending me with your life and lot. Therefore my dream I must dispel, Therefore my love I must refuse; It was a sweet and tender spell Of soft enchantment I did use: I was to blame; I therefore lose The one great bliss I ever knew, The false love which yet made me true, Bathing me in its cleansing dews But I know it grew irksome already to you. Nay, don't deny it; it was right; You could not help it; I have seen Often the anxious, doubtful light Of those true eyes when I have been Showing a nature small and mean; I've watched the shadow of regret, The pleading look when our looks met, The pain and fear you fain would screen,— And I could not be other, and cannot yet. And then, too, though I am not old, I know my years are more than thine; And that quaint thing, your sister, told, By many an angry look and sign, That she did more than half divine That I, in wanton idlesse, angled, And had, with crafty art, entangled Your love, and strained upon the line, Nor cared how your heart was torn and mangled. Little she knew—but let that pass; Perhaps I played at love; perhaps The game to earnest grew, alas! Ere I could mark the gradual lapse. The unnoticed tide crept up the gaps, And circled us with foaming sea, And there was no escape, and we, Enforcèd, clasped the love that wraps Forgetfulness in its ecstasy. Yet mine is not a love like thine, Which brooks no rival, fears no ill, Which time would mellow like old wine, Which hath no separate end or will, And is content with loving still. Such life would grow insipid soon To me, and tiresome as a tune Ground on a barrel-organ, till A change were as welcome as flowers in June. It should not, but I know it would; It seems as if some evil spell Were on me, holding me from good, And from the peace unspeakable; There is that in me like a bell Cracked in the belfry, where it swings Shaming its office, for it rings, For Christmas cheer and passing knell, The same false note for all truest things. Women are fickle—I am more; Women are contrary—I am worse; Even ficklest women can adore, And in adoring gain a force Which holds them to a stedfast course; But I've no reverence; mine eyes Have only learnt to criticise, To find out flaws, and trace their source, And to weary of folk that are good and wise. I love enough to part with pain, But not enough to wed thee poor; I dare not face the way of men Who nobly labour and endure, Seeking a great life high and pure. But I have one true purpose yet; I will not lead thee to forget The splendid hope of glory sure, Which was all your thought until we two met. Ah! you will not believe the truth, Because it shows me poor and mean; You've dreamt that I am all in sooth, Which I have dreamt I might have been; And should, perhaps, if I had seen In early years the generous life Of aspiration high, and strife For truth and love and faith serene, Which oft you have pictured for you and your wife. But this it was not mine to see; A household ours where Home is not, We carp and criticise, and we Never do anything we ought. Ah! happy was your sister's lot! My brother idles, trifles, spends, And here he borrows, there he lends, And I, like him, have never thought Of doing a thing that makes or mends. Yet we must eat and drink and dress, And drive in carriages, and ride In Rotten Row, and crush and press, Bejewelled at St. James's, tied Fast to the chariot of our pride, Have spacious rooms, and sumptuous fare, And waiting-maids and grooms to share Our vicious idleness, and hide The dull stupid ennui shot with care. It's all a lie, this life we lead; And breeds in all of us sloth and sin; The coachman wigged and tippeted, The maid who cannot sew nor spin, The brawny giant that let you in, Who should have been a grenadier, They're good for nothing before a year, Save lazy gossip, tippling gin, And keeping a tap-room, and drawing beer. How could I hope to escape the taint? I've not escaped it—I am just Like all the rest, on folly bent. Like all the rest—devoured with rust Of idleness; a hollow crust Of sentiment, and surface wit, And scraps of knowledge. I am fit For no brave life of love and trust, Or a home where the lamp of truth is lit. You think I draw my portrait ill, Beclouded by some fitful mood; And fancy you could raise me still Into a nobler world of good.— 'Tis kindly meant; but as I brood Over the thought, I seem to see You failing of your destiny; And for myself I never could Live the life you have pictured to me. I could not bear the poky rooms Where Bloomsbury students talk and smoke, I'd sicken at the steamy fumes, The maid-of-all-work would evoke; I'd sooner hear a raven croak Than hearken to the flow of wit, And watch the gleams of genius flit, While shabby artist fellows broke The silence with laughter loud and fit. 'Twas nice, of course, to hear from you About their wild Bohemian ways; One likes to know how people do Who are not in the world. We gaze Upon their splendid works, and praise Their genius, and we long to hear About their naughty vices dear, So charming in our books and plays, Like beings quite in another sphere. You do not like this tone? I know You hate a false, affected vein; What, then, if we were bound to row, Like galley-slaves, together, twain Linked each to each by loathsome chain; And by that union sundered more, Until the fretting bondage wore Your heart, and left and aching pain, As the only trace of the love you bore? It may not be, it may not be; 'Twere grievous sin in me to wed A soul to so great misery, Binding the living with the dead. And now this parting word is said, We, being twain, may still love on, Who, being one, had turned to stone; We loose our vows, but link, instead, Our hearts more surely to love alone. A sad love? Yes! I call to mind, That fisher-woman long ago Who, in the storm of sleet and wind, Lost all her sons at one fell blow— Three stalwart men. We saw her go, Don't you remember? with her dead, Side by side the corpses laid, Three long black coffins in a row, On the bench of the boat, head touching head. Never a word came from her lips; She took the helm, and bent the sail, And silently slid by the ships, Where strong men sob, and women wail; Across the bar she caught the gale, And sped on o'er the darkening wave Into black night: she never gave One sign, but tearless, hard, and pale, Sailed with her dead to their father's grave. And now I go like her, with all My dead hopes lying cold in me; The great mist cometh, like a wall Of darkness, striding o'er the sea; And all my dead are orderly Spread out beside me; and I know That they and I together go Into the black night, leaving thee,— I and my dead hopes all in a row: Into the moonless, starless gloom, Into the grey and trembling cloud, Night closing o'er me like a tomb, The wet mist clinging as a shroud, And the wind wailing dirges loud:— Men will call it a wedding gay, And maids will flutter, priests will pray, And joy-bells gather the village crowd, To toast the dead on her bridal day. Or dead or worse; they drive me mad; I wot not what the end may be; And there are times I feel so bad, And in the shadowy future see, In dark revenge of misery, A sinful woman scorning shame, Spurning a hateful home and name. I've known such, yearning to be free That they recked not either of guilt or blame. I wot not what it means; but now The stories of your grey North Sea Keep running in my head, somehow; And weird and eerie tales they be. Was it yourself that told it me? Or some one else?—I do not know— How 'mong the isles the tide-waves flow, Like maddened steeds that franticly Are lashed into fury as on they go; And how a fisher-lad was once Caught in the race, and swept away; And how his oars, by evil chance, Were reft from him; and how he lay Helpless among the tossing spray; And how he saw the grim crags loom, And heard the big waves crash and boom, Through mists that darkened on his way, Darkened and deepened like walls of his tomb; And how his heart in him grew cold, As still the boat went hurrying on, Past foaming skerry and headland bold, Into the darkness all alone; And weird, witch forms, with eyes of stone, Looked on, and mocked with laughter dread, As hungry waves, like fierce wolves, sped, And leaped on him; and hope was gone; And he fain would pray, but cursed instead: And how he lifted up his hand To pray or curse, as it might be, And in that moment grazed the land, When something smote his palm, and he Grasped a strong rope unconsciously— A fowler's rope that dangled there, Down on his darkness and despair, Barely dipping the swollen sea— And the half-uttered curse gasped into a prayer. Even so am I on fateful tide Borne on, and by the surges tossed, And helplessly I rock and ride, Alone, and in the darkness lost, Haunted by many a mocking ghost; No help without, no help within, Forsaken in my way of sin, Forsaken by myself the most, But I reach out in vain through the gloom and the din. I reach out, but I reach in vain; No help for me; I touch the shore; They only push me back again; The tide sweeps on, the waters roar, My head is dizzy, my heart is sore; I reach out, but no help is near, A cloud is on my soul, and fear, And hate and madness evermore Are hissing their whispers in my ear. There is no cord of life for me Amid my darkness and despair; Pity me, look not cold on me; There's cursing in the heart of prayer, And cursing in the very air. Will you not kiss me once? and say You love me still and ever? Nay? So be it. Wherefore should I care To chafe back the life which were better away. O heart, lie dead, and feel no more; So best, if I must still live on: The desert life that lies before Were best to have a heart of stone. Now leave me; I would be alone. You will be happy yet, and free, And I accept my destiny. We had a dream, and it is gone; And I wake, but there's no day breaking for me. BOOK SIXTH EDITORIAL Home! in the grey old house beside the brook; Home! in the dim old room among his books; Home! with his sister sitting by his side, And a fond throng of clinging memories Hovering about him, as the swallows fluttered Round their old nests, and twittered in the eaves, White-throated: there he lay in his young manhood, A fever-flush upon his wasted cheek, And a fire burning in his large grey eye; Waiting, he said, for that uncourtly valet Who doth unclothe us of our fleshly robes, Preparing us for sleep. I had my fears; Yet life was strong, only it had no relish, And hope was broken; and the springs of life Being gone, he only longed to see the end Of its hard jolting. Then the Doctors came, And tapped, and stethescoped, and spoke of râles, And lesions and adhesions and deaf parts, Cells, stitches, mucus, coughs, and blisterings: And then, with kindly knowing helplessness, They shook their head, and went upon their way. But he, in full persuasion that the end Had well begun, was tender, cheerful, kind; Not bitter with this world, nor greatly troubled About the other: yea, he had great peace Thinking of Hester and me, and laying plans About our wedding, making settlements Preposterous, and buying heaven knows what From heaven knows where, but restless till he saw it: Still glad to hear no murmur of the streets, And see no pile of books and sorted task Urging the o'er-wrought brain, and hold no more The sluggish pen in weary, fevered hand. Could he but sleep a little! Oft he lay, Seeing old faces flit by as in dreams, Hearing old voices talking in the air, All senses strangely keen, and fancy quick, Yet, as it were, a passing instrument Played on by passing sounds and subtle smells And lights and shadows, and all fleeting things. At peace he was with God, at peace with man; Only he had forgotten how to sleep. I'm not a poet; I have no romance, But stand by facts, and laws o' the Universe; Though doubtless rhyme and rhythm and play of fancy Are facts too, and have laws like utter prose. But what I mean is, if a man abuse Stomach and brain, they will revenge themselves For sleepless nights, and hastily-snatched meals, And life at fever-heat. You must not think Of a heart broken, dying in despair Of unrequited love. He loved, and lost That sweetest relish of laborious life Which henceforth was all labour—that was all. It did not change his spirit, did not fill His mouth with the big words of tragedy, Much pitying himself; it only set him Doggedly to his task of work, with force Unbroken, undivided, unrelieved; And therein he had lived, and therein found A joy and fulness of life, till something cracked With the overstrain of so unresting toil. Moreover, he had planned a scheme so vast That only a Goethe-Methuselah, with a power Of vision, and a power of master-work, Prolonged a thousand years, had seen the end on't. But now it is not given to any one To overarch the structure of all knowledge, And crown it with its dome and golden cross; Nor is it given to any one to work, As God does, leisurely, because He draws Upon the unmeasured ages, wherefore He Alone may say “'Tis finished, and very good.” We only do a part, and partly well, And others come and mend it. Thorold tried Too much for our brief life—a cosmic work, And toiled to do it in his week of days That had nor fresh-breathed morn, nor restful eve For him. So he broke down, a wreck, at last, Achieving but a fragment of his thought, A porch, a pillar, and an outline dim. Some deemed he was a failure; others saw The germ of grand discovery in his thought, And worked it to their profit. Ah! well, well: There are who give us all they have, complete, Nothing omitted, nothing lying behind, All formulated, tidy, docketed, Tied neatly up in ribbons, laid in drawers, And handy for our use—an entire soul, With all its thoughts booked up to the last hour In double entry: these don't interest me; I know them, and am done with them; they have No infinite possibilities, no shadows Of the great God upon them, and their light Is but a row of foot-lights and reflectors Shining upon the stage, and on themselves. But others, more aspiring than achieving, Achieve all in suggestion. They lie down With Nature, as Ruth lay at the feet of Boaz, Who longed for his upwaking, and yet feared What the day-break might bring; so they with dread And yearning wait, till god shall speak to them The thing they cannot utter, save in fragments, In broken strains of angel melody, Or visions momentary behind the veil; Yet more suggestive of Divinity, More helpful by their infinite reaching forth Than all completed thinking. Thorold thus Pushed at the gates of God, and through the chink Caught, wondering, some gleams of inmost Light Transcendent, and some chords of harmony Entrancing; unexpected mysteries Of unison and beauty, heretofore Or jarring, or divided, blended now In reconciling vision of higher truth. LOQUITUR THOROLD Thanks, Hester dear, this little hand Was always gentle; none like thee Can smooth a pillow in all the land, Or sweeten the sick-room delicately: A tender, loving hand to me— Too good, for I was rough and bold; Now, let me to the sunshine hold The dainty fingers up, and see The red light through, as in days of old. How sweet the day gleams through the faint Pink curtains of the dear old room, Like heaven-sent visions of a saint Tinged with the nature they illume! You've kept all here as fresh as bloom, Just as it was long years ago; I have not felt blanch linen so Lavender-sweet since fateful doom Lured me abroad to a world of woe. The old flowers through the window toss Wafts of sweet incense; roses pink Knock at the pane, cushioned in moss, And yellow buds, too, smile and blink Over the sill; and as I drink The fragrant breath, an airy jet From the sweet-pea and mignonette Falls on the sense, and makes me think Of the old bright mornings, dewy wet. Why should, at times, a passing scent, Just sniffed a moment on the breeze, Its sensuous power so swiftly spent, Come laden with more memories Than the low hum of honey bees, Or sound of old familiar strains, Or rustling of the autumn grains, Or voices from the whispering trees, Or the running brooks, or the pattering rains? The smell of these moss-roses sweet, More than aught meets the ear or eye, Speaks of old times, and seems to greet Me kindly from the days gone by:— There by the window you and I Hearken the kirk-bell in the air, I see our mother on the stair, And white-capped matrons leisurely Trudging along to the house of prayer. They are all gone, all sainted now, All clothed in raiment clean and white; With palm-crown on each grave sad brow, They stand before the Fount of light, And praise His glory day and night; No wrinkles on their face I see, No toil-rough hand, nor stiffening knee, Yet clinging to their glory bright Is the scent of the sweet thyme and rosemary. How the old books look bright in gold! You must have dusted them all day To keep them so from moth and mould. Those were school prizes near you; pray Give me my Homer, that I may Smell the old Russia smell once more, And feel the old Greek torrent pour, Like plashing waves on shingly bay, As the King mused, wrathful, along the shore. Have you forgot your Greek, and all Our quarrel? How you would have sent Fair Helen from the Trojan wall Back to the King of men, nor spent One arrow though the bow were bent, Nor borne a dint on Hector's shield, Nor planted banner on the field, Nor shouted from the battlement, For a woman whose faithless heart could yield. You held the men unfit to rule Who'd launch their galleys on the deep, And leave their realms to mickle dule, And lonely wives to watch and weep, By sandy shore and rocky steep, For leman false, and lover faint; Yea, were she pure as purest saint, Better have died than so to keep The kings from their high task of government. What scornful beauty you would show In scorning beauty and its charms! How eloquent your words would grow O'er lordless realms and vague alarms, And feeble age with rusty arms Fending the matrons, while the men Were bleeding on the sand or fen, Or dreaming of their homes and farms, Or fattening the lean wolf in his den. I think you should have been the boy, You were so politic and wise, Impatient of an idle toy, And piercing with those stedfast eyes The heart of all great enterprise. While I—ah me! my life is sped, Already numbered with the dead; And with the vanities and lies Clasp it up in its coffin lead. Yes, yes; I know you'll say me nay; You still believe in me, though I Have lost faith in myself, and pray For nothing but in peace to die, And be forgotten by and by. O sister's faith, so fond and true, Still hiding failure from our view! Close-clinging ivy green and high, That covers the ruin with glories new! Dear, there's a small flower lying in My Terence, near the fortieth page: 'Twas the first honour I did win In science, and my youthful gage Of earnest battle to assuage The thirst for knowledge. Near a stone I found it blooming all alone, Upon an eager pilgrimage: I was first to discover where it had grown. 'Tis almost the sole mark to know That I have lived; and I would feel What then I felt, when bending low I saw its delicate petals steal A coy glance, almost where my heel Had crushed the treasure; and I drew A long breath, trembling; and I knew The passion of science, and the zeal To broaden the realm of the known and true. I found it: but the shepherd lad Had found it centuries before, And made his rustic maiden glad By gilding with its golden store Her golden hair—nor cared for more. We find we know not what; we know, And idle blossoms, as they blow By mountain burn or cottage door, Fashion our life into which they grow. That little flower gave bent to all The best years I have lived on earth To any purpose. I recall Gladly our days of childish mirth, The blithe home, and the kindly hearth; But a rarer light still gilds the hour, When happening on this tender flower, I found an impulse that gave birth From an aimless life to a life of power. Of power? Ah no! This life hath been Feeble and fruitless, like the faint And watery glimmer you have seen Of broken rainbows, never bent In glory athwart the firmament— A sickly splendour, would-be light, That had not beauty's awful might: And now the bootless years are spent, And the darkness cometh on me like night. Oh for more time! a little more! I am so young; and I had planned So many years for gathering lore, So many for my work in hand— My Book which, with a purpose grand, Our fragmentary truth should knit In cosmic clearness, wholly lit And by one sovran doctrine spanned— And now, alas! it will never be writ. How strangely Destiny is ruled! This small pale flower became my lot; And all my wandering fancies schooled, And gave my life a fixèd thought, Which to one centre all things brought; And henceforth this base earth was all Instinct with meaning, prodigal Of riches; yet there cometh not One full-ripe fruit to my blossomed wall. So be it; God hath ordered all The way by which my life was led. Success it had not, or but small; Nor care I now for laurelled head, Or sleeping with the glorious dead. Slight are the trophies I have won, Meagre is all the work I've done; But I have lived, at least, and fed On that which the noblest live upon. And now that we are here alone, Sweet sister, let me tell you all; I could not speak to any one As unto you. Can you recall A lovely girl, stately and tall, A maiden with a queenly look, And how she praised my little book, And spake of Fame that should befall The grey old house by the brattling brook? You did not like her much, I know. But there was never maiden fair Seemed worthy, as queen flower, to grow Well gardened in my heart with care, The chiefest treasure and glory there. Fond, foolish Hester! you could see No Eve my help-meet fit to be Of all that breathed the common air, Unless God should fashion her purposely. And I deceived you, Hester dear, And spake of loving none like you, And talked of seeking a career Of ardent toil and science true, When all the while I had in view Her stately form, her glorious eye, Her high imperial majesty Of sovran beauty; for I knew She was my Fate, to live or to die. And so I left the dear old home, And so I left you, sister dear, And precious scroll, and cherished tome, The gathered wealth of many a year; And listed no more to appear With hammer deftly bringing forth The buried records of the earth, Or to enhance their facts with clear Thought, which gives to them all their worth. And I went forth from thee and them To the great world of London, where Men crowd, they say, to touch the hem Of Wisdom's robes, and breathe the air Of serene Science; and the care Of a wise State has garnered all Fruits of research, since Adam's fall By wisdom made our wisdom rare, And man forgot what we now recall. Heaven help me! I used all the slang Of penny-a-liner big words then; I guessed 'twas cant, and yet I rang The changes on't, like other men; Sweet, you may count that nine in ten Have nought to say but cant prolific; The pious kind is more terrific, But there's as much in people when They are literary and scientific. Abhorred it is of scholar true, High musing with his books alone; Abhorred of accurate science too, Slow-pondering a leaf or stone; But fashion has its torrid zone Where sages in a week shall grow Ripe and ready, and seem to know All that long painful thought hath won From the heaven above, and the earth below. I left you then with little truth In me—and truth alone is power; I left you in your lonely youth For her; and found her like a flower Bee-haunted in the sunny hour, With a great crown of wits and beaux, And varied hum of verse and prose Encircling her, while she would shower Several influence as she chose. And they were mainly fools—a set Of parlour-pedants chattering science, Their thoughts all tangled in a net Of hard, dry fact; the pigmy giants Hurled at the gods their proud defiance, Tracing fit genealogies Far back among the cocoa trees, And fondly hugging brute-alliance With the monkey tribes and the chimpanzees. All heresies of art came there, All heresies of science too, All theorists were free to air All social heresies, and new Commandments that a man should do, And women who had wrongs and rights, And patriots from disastrous fights, And geniuses came there, who grew Quicker than mushrooms overnights. A Babel of confusèd tongues! A Limbo of the inchoate! A gasping of distempered lungs That blamed the air, and not their state! All fain to mend the world and fate, All hating labour, and the slow Results that from its patience grow; And oh, the froth was very great As they swirled and eddied to and fro. Yet wherefore should I speak in scorn? God made them in their kind, and He Had use for them, at least had borne With their most flippant vanity: As in his Universe we see A province for all meanest things; Even for the earth-worm's twisted rings A service and a ministry, To silence our hasty cavillings. And London is not One. It is A group of villages, a lot Of cliques and clubs and coteries; Where the fresh fact or novel thought, Filtered from stage to stage, may not Long time the simple fact remain, Or thought as sent from the thinker's brain; Rogues sweat their sovereigns; fools, I wot, Clip smaller the thoughts of their wisest men. But she? Well, she was like a spring Of purest water, cold and clear, Where bright birds come to preen their wing, And owls and ravens too appear: She mirrored all as they drew near, And they all drank, and left no trace; But each man deemed he saw his face Deep in her heart, and had no fear That the shadow changed when he changed his place. Me for a while she honoured with Selectest intercourse of few, Rehearsing every night a myth Of what I was, and how I grew In a lone country-house, and knew Science like Pascal, with no aid, Except the quaintest little maid Who was a delicate genius too, And how she had drawn me out of the shade. I tired of this; 'twas weary all, And all unlike the glorious dream, Which now with smiles I can recall, Of a fair woman who did seem Down on my lower world to gleam, Like something from the heavens untainted, And for whose love my spirit fainted, And would all lowliest worship deem Too poor for her I had enshrined and sainted. Perhaps I judged her wrong; her way Was harder than at first I knew; Her young life panted to be gay, Her young heart panted to be true, Her home was all divided too, False science false religion met, And lavish waste with scrimping debt; Poor heart! the wonder is she grew Half so noble as she was yet. You did not know—you could not guess; But we had plighted love before; We pledged it in a long caress One evening on the grey sea-shore, As thought came surging like the hoar, Wild, bursting waves upon the beach; It was a passion beyond speech, Ne'er quite articulate, and the more Dumb, that its hope seemed so far out of reach. And I do think she loved as well As she could love; at any rate I will not judge her, but will tell The sorry issue of my fate. I spake: she said she might not wait For the slow ripening of my fame, And the high honours that my name Would win for some more worthy mate, But she would cherish it all the same. Enough! why dwell on it? She chose, After her kind, one of the set; A man of blue-books, cold and close, A scientific baronet, A creature who would vex and fret Her soul with circumstantials, And pottering among chemicals, And prosing about funded debt, And his articles in the serials. So all was over. I had striven 'Gainst clearest proofs, to prove them wrong, Had fought with doubts, as if for Heaven, To cherish a delusion strong: And oh the cruel, bitter throng Of haunting memories that came, Still summoned by her cherished name, Sweeping like mocking ghosts along, As the drear night wind shook the window-frame! Seemed now the world a weary waste, A heartless world, a thing to scorn; 'Twas only coldness made the chaste, And Cupid was of Plutus born; And evermore my soul was torn With jealous rage to think of him, The dainty prig, so spruce and trim, Whose acres made my heart forlorn, Whose love was nought but a summer whim. Then turned I to my work. Not mine I said, to pule for woman's love; With searching thoughts will I entwine Round Nature's porches; I'm above Being a slight girl's silken glove Shaped to her hand, and laid away, Or taken up, as fancy may: I have a problem high to prove, And the facts to gather, and set in array. Alone, through many a weary day, Alone through many a silent night, I wended on my patient way, Groping through darkness into light, Now sore perplexed, now staggered quite, Yet slowly working out a thought That all to clearest order brought: It held me with a spell of might, And my days were happy, for I forgot. Happy, for I forgot! Ah me! I met her one day in the street, Looking so sorrow-stricken! he Was glancing at his dainty feet, And with his ready smirk would greet Me heavy-laden: but I hid My sorrow as a thing forbid, And while my pained heart madly beat, Silently into the throng I slid. Again I met her in the Park; I was then thin and worn and faint; It was about the gathering dark, And scarcely did she know me bent With toiling day and night. I went Close to her carriage, and she said, “Cruel! I hoped to crown your head With laurel; must my care be spent On pallid flowers for a grave, instead?” A weary look was in her eye, A wasting grief on her cheek so pale; And in my heart then muttered I, “So, the stony heart has an unheard wail Low moaning on the midnight gale, And sighing now for love like mine, When love alone is felt divine, And life is flat, and riches stale, And the soul awakens to long and pine.” An evil thought! God pardon me; The fevered joy of passion fell, A lurid light, could only be, Glared upward from the depths of hell! Nay, be not wroth: I loved her well, Loved her, and love is ne'er in vain, Loved her, and found in all its pain A dew and blessing, and the swell Of a life that joyed like the bounding main. And I had died in early youth At any rate. Oh blame her not; She did but make my path more smooth, And shed some sunlight on my lot. I had of old this hectic spot— Our mother's gift of delicate bloom: And it is well she 'scaped the doom Of early widowhood. I sought To wed her young life to a fated tomb. And as I loved her, you will love, And gently scan her, hap what may; Sweet, as we hope to meet above, You promise, ere I go away. There, kiss me in pledge of it. I lay A wager, that's your Hermann strong, His deep bass booming a Luther-song Out of a heart as big as gay: What a great life is that coming tramping along! Would I be like him? Nay, not now; Best as it is, dear: all is best. I've lived my life; and gladly bow Unto the high, supreme Behest, As I draw near the hour of rest, Leaving no care behind me here: Soon all the mystery shall be clear, Or in high fellowship of the Best Little we'll heed, with the great God near. My sun sinks without clouds or fears; No spectral shadows gather round The gateway of the endless years, Where we, long blindfold, are unbound, And lay our swathings on the ground, To face the Eternal. So I rest Peacefully on the Strong One's breast, Even though the mystery profound Ever a mystery be confessed. My old doubts?—Well, they no more fret, Nor chafe and foam o'er sunken rocks. I don't know that my Faith is yet Quite regular and orthodox; I have not keys for all the locks, And may not pick them. Truth will bear Neither rude handling, nor unfair Evasion of its wards, and mocks Whoever would falsely enter there. But all through life I see a Cross, Where sons of God yield up their breath: There is no gain except by loss, There is no life except by death, And no full vision but by Faith, Nor glory but by bearing shame, Nor Justice but by taking blame; And that Eternal Passion saith, “Be emptied of glory and right and name.” Anselm and Luther, Tauler, Groot, With reverent search and solemn awe, Saw each some angle of God's great thought, Saw none of them the perfect Law, And, in defining much, some flaw Marred all their reasoning; nor may I fashion forth the truth which they Only in broken fragments saw; But the way of the just, is to trust and pray. I wonder how the twilight shines On the tinkling brook that cleaves the hill, And how it rays with great broad lines Through rifted clouds that slumber still, And how the fall that turned our mill Glistens, and how the shadows fold Around the dew as night grows cold, And how the lark with tuneful bill Sings o'er the meadows we loved of old. I ever loved our earth, and still I love its scaurs and brooks and braes, The long bleak moor, the misty hill, And all their creatures, and their ways, And many waters sounding praise; It seems as if my lingering feet Clung to its moss and grasses sweet, And ferny glades, and golden days When cowslips and ladybirds made our hearts beat. Throw up the window; let me hear The mellow ousel once more sing, The carol of the sky-lark clear, The hum of insects on the wing, The lowing of the kine to bring The milk-maid singing with her pail, The tricksy lapwing's far-off wail, The woodland cushat's murmuring, And the whish of the pines in the evening gale. Fain would I carry with me all Blithe Nature's blended harmony; The half-notes and the tremulous fall Of her young voices, and the free Gush of full-throated melody; And, like a child, I'm loath to go, And leave the elders to the flow Of speech and song and memory, And take me to sleep in the room below. But I can yet take up the prayer Of childhood at the mother's knee, And breathe it as the natural air Of truest Faith and Piety, Its meanings deepening as I see My deeper needs, His deeper light; For wonder grown to wisdom, might Find there fit utterance, and a key To the thoughts that reach to the Infinite. Our Father, lo! the end draws near, And in Thy presence I am dumb; Have mercy on my lowly fear, And Father, let Thy kingdom come: I thank Thee for my daily crumb, Forgive me, as I do forgive; And in my dying may I live; And when the hours of trial come, Help and deliverance do Thou give.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BORLAND HALL BOOK FIRST COLLEGE LIFE There's an old University town Between the Don and the Dee Looking over the grey sand dunes, Looking out on the cold North Sea. Breezy and blue the waters be, And rarely there you shall fail to find The white horse-tails lashing out in the wind, Or the mists from the land of ice and snow Creeping over them chill and slow. Sitting o' nights in his silent room, The student hears the lonesome boom Of the breaking waves on the long sand reach, And the chirming of pebbles along the beach; And gazing out on the level ground, Or the hush of keen stars wheeling round, He feels the silence in the sound. So, hearkening to the City's stir, Alone in some still house of God Whose solemn aisles are only trod By rarely-coming worshipper, At times, beneath the fret and strife, The far-off hum, the creaking wain, The hurrying tread of eager gain, And all the tide of alien life, We catch the Eternal Silence best, And unrest only speaks of rest. O'er the College Chapel a grey stone crown Lightsomely soars above tree and town, Lightsomely fronts the Minster towers, Lightsomely chimes out the passing hours To the solemn knell of their deep-toned bell; Kirk and College keeping time, Faith and Learning, chime for chime. The Minster stands among the graves, And its shadow falls on the silent river; The Chapel is girt with young Life's waves, And the pulses of hope there are passioning ever.— But death is in life, and life is in death; Being is more than a gasp of breath: We come and go, we are seen and lost, Now in glimmer, and now in gloom; And oft this body is the tomb, And the Life is then with the silent host. In the old University town, Looking out on the cold North Sea, 'Twixt the Minster towers and the College crown, On a winter night as the snow came down In broad flakes tremulously, Falling steady, and falling slow, Nothing seen but the falling snow, A youth, with strained and weary looks, Sat by a table piled with books, And a shaded lamp that gleamed among Pages of writing, large and strong. A glance of sharp impatience flashed Out of his dark and deep-set eye, As he lifted his head, and hastily dashed The hair from a forehead broad and high: For there was a crash and a clamour and ringing In the room overhead, and a chorus singing, As the bell tolled midnight from near the graves, And ere its slow deep note had died, The chime from the College crown replied, And then came the boom of the breaking waves. Some twenty and three years he had seen, Or more perchance; 'tis hard to tell The age of a face so strong and keen, The years of a form that was hardened well By the winter's cold and the summer's heat, And the mountain winds and the rain and sleet. Big-boned, with the look of unformed power; In body and brain and passion strong: Over his square brow fell a shower Of black hair, waving and thick and long. It was a great brown hand that gripp'd The pliant quill o'er the blotted sheet,— No soft and clerkly finger slipt Over the pages, glib and fleet; More like that of a man with sword equipt, Grasping the hilt his foe to meet. An eager, strenuous spirit, meaning To do with might what he had to do, And rarely trusting, never leaning, But self-reliant and bold and true; A nature rugged and hard and strong; Yet, as among the rocks and fells, Where most the storms rage loud and long, The deepest silence also dwells, And there are brightest mossy wells Among the nodding heather bells: So in his stormy spirit dwelt The hush of that religious sense, The silence of that great reverence Which the strong and brave have always felt; Nor less the tender beauty wrought By fresh well-springs of feeling deep And Love, that whether we wake or sleep, Brightens and sweetens every lot. In the room overhead a clamour rang, But hushed for a moment, as some one sang Cheery and clearly, each note like a bell Floating the words off, round and well. PARTY OF STUDENTS IN THE UPPER ROOM First Student. —Look, how Darrel is moping; ask him to sing; They are dull fellows poets, unless they can get All the say to themselves: there he stands in a pet, Like a hen on one leg with her head 'neath her wing. Second Student. Nay, let him alone; Cupid hit him last night; I heard the sharp twang of his bow, and it broke his Poor Muse's wing, who came down, in sad plight, With a flutter of anapæsts, dactyls, and trochees. Third Student. —Ralph, come, pluck up heart, man, and give us a stave: Love is life to the poet, like wind to a ship, It will give you a song, though she give you the slip, Which you'll sing at her wedding, or else o'er her grave; For the song is as much as the Love to the poet;— 'Tis the fruit, and the passion was but soil to grow it. Song— She is a Woman She is a woman to love, to love, As flowers love light, And all that is best in you is at its best, When she enters your heart as a welcome guest, Making it bright. She is a woman to love, to love With a love sincere, For all that is bad in you hides away, Like the bats and the owls from the glory of day, When she is near. She is a woman to love, to love As maid or wife, And all of her that is sweet and true— Which is all of her—she will give to you, To perfect life. You cannot help but love, but love, Nobody can, She carries a charm with her everywhere In her gait, in her glance, in her voice, in her hair, Bewitching man. What is it in her you love, you love? Is it her face, Beaming with beauty along the way? Is it her wit so nimble and gay? Is it her grace? None of them truly, but one and all, And the something unseen Which should lie behind beauty and wit and art— The noble nature, the soul, the heart, With its joy serene. Hear her laugh, as the children play, See her bring Light to the eyes of the old and weak; And oh how wisely her lips can speak As well as sing! That is a woman to love, to love, And to wonder at, For whether she talks, or walks, or rides, 'Tis as if she had never done aught besides But perfect that. First Student. —A fig for your love-ditties! Cupid's an ass, And the wise man will drown the small elf in his glass. Second Student. —Ha, ha! lads, I told you our Ralph had been hit: Now, guess the rare mixture of beauty and wit. Third Student. —Nay, we name not the name of a damsel of honour; Enough that such verses come showering upon her. Now for something more stirring. I sing like a horse; But here's for the old land of heather and gorse. Sings—Up in the North Up in the North, up in the North, There lies the true home of valour and worth; Wild the wind sweeps over moorland and glen, But truth is trusty, and men are men, And hearts grow warmer the farther you go, Up to the North with its hills and snow. Ho for the North, yo ho! Out of the North, out of the North, All the free men of the nations came forth; Kings of the sea, they rode, like its waves, Crash on the old Roman empire of slaves, And the poor cowed serfs and their Cæsars saw Rise from its ruins, our Freedom and Law. Ho for the North, yo ho! Up in the North, up in the North, O but our maids are the fairest on earth, Simple and pure as the white briar-rose, And their thoughts like the dew which it clasps as it blows; There are no homes but where they be, Woman made home in the north countrie. Ho for the North, yo ho! O for the North, O for the North! O to be there when the stars come forth! The less that the myrtle or rose is given, The more do we see there the glory of heaven; And care and burden I leave behind When I turn my face to the old North wind. Ho for the North, yo ho! First Student. —Pshaw! your patriotsong now is only sonorous; And, besides, people laugh at us talking so grand, And praising ourselves, and our crusty old land. Come, set us a catch with a rattling good chorus. Third Student. —Nay, none of your catches. Ralph, let's have a stave With a touch of the pathos, like that which you gave At the Doctor's last evening: I noted his eye: How he sipped his glass daintily while it was dry! How he gulped it in tumblers a frigate might float, With the tear in his eye, and the lump in his throat! You may roar out a chorus, lads: but to my thinking, There is nothing like pathos, for good steady drinking. All. —Ay, ay, Ralph, touch up the feelings a bit; And let each prime his glass: weeping's drier than wit. Darrell. —But nothing will please you. Well, never mind; The birds sing their songs to the trees and the wind. Song— Mysie Gordon Now where is Mysie Gordon gone? What should take her up the glen, Turning, dowie and alone, From smithy lads and farming men?— Never seen where lasses, daffing At the well, are blithely laughing, Dinging a' the chields at chaffing: Bonnie Mysie Gordon. Mysie lo'ed a student gay, And he vowed he lo'ed her well: She gave all her heart away, He lo'ed naething but himsel': Then he went to woo his fortune, Fleechin', preachin', and exhortin', Got a Kirk, and now is courtin'— But no his Mysie Gordon. Every night across the moor, Where the whaup and pewit cry, Mysie seeks his mither's door Wi' the saut tear in her eye. Little wots his boastfu' Minnie, Proud to tell about her Johnnie, Every word's a stab to bonnie Love-sick Mysie Gordon. A' his letters she maun read, A' about the lady braw; Though the lassie's heart may bleed, Though it even break in twa; Wae her life may be and weary, Mirk the nicht may be and eerie, Yet she'll gang, and fain luik cheerie, Bonnie Mysie Gordon. Whiles she thinks it maun be richt; She is but a landward girl; He a scholar, and a licht Mickle thocht o' by the Earl. Whiles she daurna think about it, Thole her love, nor live without it, Sair alike to trust, or doubt it, Waesome Mysie Gordon. Mysie doesna curse the cuif, Doesna hate the lady braw, Doesna even haud aloof, Nor wish them ony ill ava: But she leaves his proudfu' mither, Dragging through the dowie heather Weary feet by ane anither; Bonnie Mysie Gordon. First Student. —A sell! a sell! why, I've emptied my glass: And it's only a fellow that jilted his lass. Second Student. —I wonder now Ralph, you can look in my face! We asked you for pathos, and lo! commonplace. Third Student. —Silence there! Ralph, you must try it again. Hark! how the sea moans: give us a strain Caught from the wail of the lonesome main. Song— The False Sea I Singing to you, And moaning to me; Nothing is true In the false, cruel sea. Where its lip kisses The sands, they are bare, Where its foam hisses, Nothing lives there; When it is smiling, Hushed as in sleep, It is beguiling Some one to weep. II They went seafaring, With light hearts and free, And full of the daring That's bred of the sea: It crept up the inlet, And bore them away Where it laughed in the sunlight, And dimpled the bay, Singing to them, But moaning to me, Tripping it came, The cold, cruel sea. III I heard the oars dipping, I heard her bows part The waves with a rippling That went through my heart. And I saw women weeping And wringing their hands For the dead that were sleeping That night on the sands: For nothing is true In the false cruel sea Which is singing to you, And moaning to me. Long and loud the clamour rose, Bells were ringing, doors were banging, Feet were tramping, glasses clanging; Seemed the racket ne'er would close: And listening to the uproar loud Thus his thoughts upon him crowd. AUSTEN LYELL College-Musing Crash! crash! there they go, Ralph, Darrel and Hugh, And little Tom Guild, and that jovial crew. First, cups in the tavern, and brawls in the street, A springing of rattles, and scuffling of feet, A laughter and screaming of girls, and a thud As of some one that falls in the slush and the mud; Then a rush up the stairs, and tramp, tramp overhead, With a Babel of speech that might waken the dead, A clinking of glasses, and ringing of bells, And song after song till the daylight draws near— Ralph sings like a bird, how his voice trills and swells! And the rogues make a chorus that catches the ear: Love song and drinking song, madrigal, glee, Breaking in on the long-rolling boom of the sea. What to do with their tramping and chorusing so Through the still hours of thought, with the lamp burning low? Let me read as I will, I read nothing but words; And somehow they run into quavers and chords— Metaphysics in music, crabbed Latin in tunes, With no more clear meaning than so many Runes: At the trick of the singer they trip in light measure, But shake from their folds the fine thought which they treasure. What to do?—Why not join in their jolly carouse? Ralph's a splendid young scamp, and has plenty of nous, Ay, and more Greek and Latin than half of the fellows Who are cramming for honours, dull, bilious, and jealous. Now, were Socrates here, and saw how they mope, And travail in pain with a theme, or a trope, And drag out a thought as with pulleys and cranks, How his jests would go crack like a whip on their flanks! But for Ralph—there the Greek eye would brighten to witness His beauty and vigour, his swiftness and fitness For wisdom or valour, for pleasure or power, For speech to the Demos, or maid in her bower, For bridling the wild horse, or quaffing the bowl, Or holding discourse of the gods and the soul: For dear to the sage was a beautiful youth, And the wholeness of manhood was precious as truth. And I too am young; and my blood too is hot With the lust of all broad roads where pleasure is got. They think me a bookworm, a winner of prizes, Full of priggish decorums, and learned surmises; Precise as a Puritan; feeding on Scholia, And Elzevir classics, and black Melancholia: Yet the craving of passion is gnawing within, And the strong human hanker to dally with sin. Ho! a flask of old wine, grey with cobwebs, whose scent Made the grim spiders jolly in bloated content. Rare topers! no fly buzzed their darkness, or brought The grossness of appetite into their thought; Nor bubble nor bead marred the rapture divine, But they netted aroma, and breathed the bright wine, And folding the cork in their mouse-coloured wraps, They boozed on, and dreamt not of time and its lapse. And oh for my Horace's Daphne or Phyllis, Low-browed, and breathing of wreathed amaryllis; How her eyes beam, and her golden curls break, Like tangled laburnum drops, round her white neck!— Shell-tipped her fingers are, taper and long, Tripping she comes to me, lissom and strong, Yet coy too, and hard to be caught, till I kiss The blushes and dimples, and revel in bliss. Why not? Why should phantoms of beauty and grace, Pink and gold with the sunniest hues of delight, Hang like clouds in their glory before the warm face Of our youth, as it comes, in its morning and might, Shining and singing and fresh with the dew; Yet all be but shadows, and nothing be true?— All but vanity, dream and inanity, Nothing to shower down a blessing on you! How was it that Goethe in full measure tasted All that Life had to give him, nor missed aught, nor wasted! Sat Shakespeare alone thus, and heard the dogs bark, Like an owl in a barn staring into the dark, And warming its five wits to find out the mystery Of this wonderful world, and its wonderful history! Did they shrink from love-tryste, song, or bright-beaded wine, As if only the dulness of life were divine? Nay, their nets swept the stream of our full-flowing gladness, Its still pools of thought, and side-eddies of sadness; Where life was the deepest, and passion was strong, They fished in its waters, and lingered there long, And so they were rich in the glorious sense Of a wealth of world-wide experience. And what is it all for—this heaping of ashes On the hot fire of youth till you smother its flashes?— This stating again of our hopeless imbroglios, And dulling the brain with the dust of old folios? There's my old school-companion, Dick Gow of the Glen, With the brains of a half man, and labours of ten; How he toils on, and mopes over volumes patristic, And dogmas forensic, and rites eucharistic, And fictions of law, that he calls gospel verity, And tries to believe he believes in sincerity. Meanwhile in the glen where his childhood had been Stands the lowly turf hut, where the house-leek is green; Near by it, the burn rushes hurrying down Through the rocky gorge headlong, and turbid, and brown, Or glistens o'er slippery shelves, green with long moss, Where the maiden-hair tresses stretch half-way across, Or sleeps in the pools where the speckled trout play, And leap to the fly when the evening is grey, Or sings through the woodland its few plaintive bars To the slender oak-fern, and the pale sorrel-stars. There, cramped with rheumatics, and bending with age, His grave father sweats at the ditch and the hedge, And sisters and brothers are patiently drudging From day-break till dark, unrepining, ungrudging; And all, as they stint food and raiment and fire, Have but one hope that cheers them—to see the Kirk spire In the glory long prayed for, when crossing the hill. Lo! the folk are fast gathering from farmstead and mill, From the shepherd's lone hut in the deep mountain shade, And the wood-ranger's hid in the dim forest glade, All to hear their boy preach the great Gospel, and sever Himself from the old home and old life for ever.— That's the end of his struggle, when Priesthood has riven The fondest of earth's ties, that bind us to heaven; Has sundered those hearts that were loving and true, And linked him now fast to the Laird, and the few Respectable folk who have nothing to do! Or there is young Barbour; his factoring father Heeds of nothing but charters, and wadsets, and leases, Rotations of cropping, and how he shall gather Biggest rents for my Lord whose waste daily increases. But his boy, he must ponder high questions of Law, And store up old precedent, rubric, and saw, Load his memory daily with cases in point, Learn the sharp fence of Logic to pierce through a joint In his learned friend's argument, parry his hits, Or to pester a witness half out of his wits. Great the thoughts of his youth, to determine all right By the law which the landlords have voted is light, For ever immutable, sacred, divine, To the serf of the glebe, and the thrall of the mine. So his days and his nights shall be spent, and his youth Dried up into parchment, amassing the truth Which entails the broad acres of meadow and corn, And the heath-purpled hills where the wild deer are born, And the fish of the river, and bird of the air To the high chosen people for whom the gods care— Whose the anointing is, whose is the money, And whose is the land, with its milk and honey, So he squanders bright youth with its wonder and awe For a wig and a gown, and this vision of Law! Oh, but Culture? and what all the culture we get? Old furniture crammed into “Lodgings to let,”— Nothing blending in harmony, graceful in beauty, Or meet for a high life of courage and duty; Only that which will pay: for our culture is meant Not to make noble men, but a handsome per cent. We touch on all topics, but nothing we know; We open all questions, and still leave them so; Never look to the end of them, dare not abide By the issues we raise, but glance ever aside; For there is not a lie, spite of God's high decree, But has made its nest sure, on some branch of our tree, And has some vested right to exist in the land, And some who will have it the tree could not stand If the sticks, straws, and feathers, that sheltered the wrong, Were swept from the boughs they have cumbered so long. Let me toss to the wind every dream; let me know All that Nature full-blooded, full-handed, can show; Let me touch at all points the whole life that man lives, And taste with a relish all pleasure it gives, Link the sweet notes of music with sweet words of song, Wreathe the arms in the dance, and go tripping along, Kiss the peach-blossom cheek, rich with life's glowing dyes, And know the wild rapture of love-gleaming eyes, Crown the cup with its flowers, purple lip with old wine, And let young vigour rage—in its passion divine. Ah! we grow hydrocephalous, swelling the brain At the cost of our manhood, till thinking is pain, And the surfeited mind labours wearily through A task which the healthful Greek lightly would do— Lightly and laughing, for subtle and strong, He lived at full pitch, and his life was a song. Why, what demon is this, with the logic of Hell, That pleads for the wild Beast within me so well— The Beast that was doomed to a Cross by the Three Awful names, that are named in the great Mystery? Down, down, thou foul fiend! Hence to leprous romance Of the demi-monde poisonous mushrooms of France. Better sin like a man, doing after his kind, Than sit here cold-blooded, debauching the mind.— Hark! Ralph sings again, but he sings all alone, And he wails now, poor fellow, the days that are gone. Song— The Hours Brown, gipsy hours, with white teeth laughing gay, Came trooping by me, when a child at play, And with their coaxing stole my life away Where bird in bush was idling all the day. Soft, roguish hours, that in the gloaming peep At woodland nooks a dewy tryste to keep, Stole my young life away, and in a heap Of rose leaves, sweetly smelling, hid it deep. Dark, robber hours, like burglars in the night, They broke into my house, by cunning sleight, And bound me fast, as with a spell of might, And reft my life away ere morning light. The idle bird is silent on the tree, The rose leaves withered now and scentless be, The spell is broken; lo! mine eyes can see— O thievish hours that stole my life from me! Lost, lost! and now the mists, low trailing, screen The visioned glories that I once have seen, And all the hours are grey and cold and mean— Lost, lost my life—and oh, the might have been! So the young soul to darkness is hopelessly wending— And this is the dream that I dreamt, and its ending! But why was it ever dreamt? How could I spirt The froth of that dead sea, or stir up its dirt? Ah! we strike a few chords ere the music we play, Preluding the strain, as if light fingers stray Dreamily over the keys, till they find The melody shape itself clear in the mind; So we dream, and from dreaming we glide into act, And our life is the dream in a rhythm of hard fact. And can this be the prelude to mine, like the moan Of the sea as it laps the curved sand or the stone In the moon-glimmered bay, while its far depths are stirred By the throes of the storm that is coming? I've heard That the knight, ere he buckled giltspur to his heel, Or belted his thigh with the good sword of steel, Laid his arms on the altar, helmet and shield, Breastplate and banner, and watched there, and kneeled All the long night on the pavement of stone, All the long night in the darkness alone, All the long night, while fiends in the air Plied him with terrors, or strove to ensnare; But I, what a watch have I kept! Here suddenly he rose, and stood Close by the window in dreamy mood. The snow had ceased to fall, and lay White o'er all the level reach, White to the sand-dunes and the beach Where the tumbling breakers fell, And what was snow, and what was spray, It was hard for the eye to tell. The broad white moon was hurrying swift, Trailing her pale skirts over the drift Of the flying clouds; and through a rift, Here and there, in the distance far, He caught the gleam of a throbbing star; And away to the north was a band of light, That wavered like the sheen of spears Swaying about in some ghostly fight— For all was ghostly in that wan night, And the shadows passed like fears— Wan the moon looked, and wan the cloud, And wan the earth in its snowy shroud. So, as he gazed, his eyes grew dim, And moon and stars were hid from him By some strange mist, and then the mist Shaped itself into forms, I wist: And he saw his old home, 'neath the wooded hill, Between the bridge and the red-roofed mill, And the village near it, sleepy and still. O'er the high pine-tops the clouds were creeping, And all the heavens were grey and cold; And he was aware that Death was there, For amid the hush was a sound of weeping, And as it were muffled, the kirk bell tolled. Was it the bell?—or only the boom Of the waves that mixed with his dreamy thought? Whose face was that in the darkened room? The features changed in the shadowy gloom, But the passionless calm, it changèd not. Sometimes, he thought it was his own; Sometimes, it had his mother's look; And his quivering lip gave a low, faint moan At the pathos of its still rebuke.— Had he broken her heart by the way he took? Then Austen; Can this be a dream I am dreaming; Yet I see the clouds drifting o'erhead, the moon gleaming On the cold hard blue of the sea, and the stars— Lo! yonder the Pleïades, yonder red Mars; But they seem to shine in through an oak-panelled ceiling Which is solid and real, with a weird, alien feeling, As if they were the shadows, and it alone true. Or was it the shadow of Fate that I saw On my old mother's home, with a chill sense of awe? She is not what she was, and her letters have strange Longings of late in them, hinting of change. She used to be hard, though as true as the steel, And is not one to utter the half she may feel; Now she'd fain have me with her, is weary alone In the wild winter evenings; and ere she is gone There is so much to say; yet I must not let that, Or the thought of her, hinder the work I am at. That's not like her, somehow; its mild, mellow light Is soft as the gloaming that fades into night; Yet here have I been adding shadows of sin To the shadow of death she is walking in; Help me, O God, that my life may yet prove True to Thy thought, and the hope of her love. From the old University town Looking out on the cold north sea He carried high honours down To his home in the hill country: And proud was the mother that bore him then, Though little she said, for that was her way; But all the village, and all the glen, When they saw her, dressed in her goodliest grey, Walk to the kirk on Sunday, knew That whether the sermon was old or new, Whether the prayers were brief or long, Or the psalms were all sung out of tune, Or the doctrine all unsound and wrong, Or the service stayed till afternoon, This once at least, she would not hear For the voices of triumph that filled her ear: And bonnets, too, might be gay and bright, And ribbons flash in the gleams of light, And eyes might turn from the pulpit, too, To gaze at the young laird's stately pew; For once the sin would be forgot Of garment gay and wandering thought; And sooth to say, they blamed her not. They liked the youth; and learning still Is more esteemed among the folk Who till the glebe, or watch the flock, In lonely glen, or silent hill, Than wealth of gold; and also he Was wont to mix with them pleasantly: And it was as if honour had come on them all When he stood up among them grave and tall, At the smithy door, or the bowling green, Hurling the quoit, or rolling the ball, Foremost scholar the year had seen. BOOK SECOND BORLAND GLEN As, you come over the hill, a little way down, the road Suddenly sweeps to the right, and lo! a green valley and broad; Through it a river runs swift, its water broken by rocks And boulders, cleaving its way as by rapidest bounds and shocks; Now with a clear rush on, and now recoiling again, To wheel round the barrier huge, it has hammered for ages in vain, Only dinting deep holes in its ribs, and chafing itself into foam, Then swirling away to the bank to bite at the softer loam. Yonder an old peel tower, hid in clumps of the ivy green, Perched on its crag like an eyrie, and there the whole valley is seen; Not an approach South or North, East or West, but the watchman's eye Would catch the sheen of the spears, and the banners would well descry, And sound the alarm in time for hoisting the drawbridge high. Away to the right on its lawn, close-shaven by mowing machines, Stands the house which the great cotton-lord built out of his bobbins and skeins: Brand-new, all gables and turrets and chimneys, stack upon stack, Something top-heavy it looks, and bare too and cold, but the lack Of trees is made up, by acres of glass for magnificent vineries, Palm-houses, ferneries, cucumber beds, and great melon-frames and the pineries. Far at the end of the valley, open three narrow glens, Each with its own marked features, charactered clear as men's; Each with its own fair water finding its fitting way, Rough o'er the rocky channel, or still by the broomy brae. That to the left is rugged; one side, a bare bleak hill With a cataract, rugged, of stones down-rushing as if they would fill The glen with grey desolation; and half-way down a thorn Seems as it stayed the torrent, and was bent with the weight and worn. Only that thorn on the hillside grapples the stones with its root, Only some scraggy hazel bushes straggle about its foot, Only the curlew wails there, and the grouse-cock crows at morn: Only the goat and the coney poise on those stony heaps, Only the parsley fern along their barren spaces creeps. And far below in the hollow the stream goes plunging on From the rocky steep to the rocky pool, and the rumbling boulder stone. The middle glen is wooded; there the ancient lords of the land, Leaving their high-pitched eyrie, built a stately house and grand Right under the Murrough-crag, pine-clad up to the top, And they belted the woods all round them, and bade the highways stop, And they made them a goodly forest, stocked with the wild red deer, And they drew the stream into fishponds, and swept with their nets the mere. The wild deer bound in the woodlands now, but there is none to care, And the trout are fat in the fishponds, and the water-lily is fair, Stately and grand the house is still, and the terraced gardens fine, But the young lord comes not ever—he is drinking the beaded wine, Or pigeon-shooting by Thames, or marking the red by the Rhine. Fair is the glen to the right, in its pastoral beauty still, Green in its holms and hollows, green to the top of each hill; A line of alder and drooping birch marks where its river flows, But in its bare upper reaches only the juniper grows: The stream comes out of a tarn on the hill, whose oozy edge Is fringed with a ring of lilies and an outer ring of sedge; And there is no road beyond that, only a mountain high, And a cairn of stones where the withered bones of Three brave Martyrs lie. Now, at the mouth of that green glen, hid in a bosk of trees, The oak and the beech and the chestnut, and lime, honeyed haunt of the bees, And the yew and the ash, and many a shrub, blossomy, fragrant, green, Nestled a quaint old mansion; bit by bit, it had been Built now and then, as they could, yet it rambled somehow into shape, Picturesque, here a low gable rising step upon step, There a long corridor broken with quaint dormer windows, and then An old square tower of rough rubble, built for the rough fighting men; But the front is all draped now with creepers, with scarlet and golden flower, Till it looks in its summer beauty like some fairy-haunted bower, Hid in its bosk of trees, under the shade of the hill Where the river sweeps clear from the bridge down to the red-roofed mill. Austen sat there with his mother, alone at the close of day, Sat with a visage perplexed, while she looked hard and gray, With furrows drawn deep on her forehead, and temples fallen away Into blue-veined pits, and you plainly saw the shadow of death on her face; But she sat erect in her high-backed chair, and sternly held her place, As if she would say, While there's breath in me, lo! in weakness I will show Weakness to no one, but keep at arm's length the terrible foe. So, with a Bible before her, and a spinning-wheel at her side, Hardly and sharply she spoke, and he, with bated breath, replied. BORLAND'S WIDOW I am your mother, and Scripture saith Thou shalt honour me until death; Yea, not even death shall set you free From the honour and duty owing to me; For what I have willed, and signed, and sealed, Ere I go to the other world, worse or better, Though it wound with a wound that shall never be healed, Thou shalt carry it out to the uttermost letter. Now, wilt thou promise me this, or no; And get my blessing before I go? Yes, there is something upon my mind, Ill to keep there, and worse to tell; Yet it's borne upon me that I must find A way to utter it, ill or well, To you of all men, and only you. Sooner than speak I could die the death, But death will not come to me till I do; And oh I am weary of life and breath. Yet my lips shall be sealed, as death can seal them, And the devil may shuffle the cards, and deal them To all of you, as he did to me, If you will not swear to me faithfully, Over the Book here, to do my will, Whether you reckon it good or ill. Oh! you will do all that a son may do, In honour and right, for his mother's name! Fine words! But “honour and right” from you As if your old mother would set you to Work of dishonour and deed of shame!— But perhaps you have reason—who can say? Maybe I taught you to lie and cheat, And drink and steal, as well as pray: A rogue is but half a rogue, incomplete Till he burst out a full-blossomed hypocrite; So I brought you up in the good old way, To fit you the better for deeds of dishonour Your wicked old mother had taken upon her!— Nay, none of your fondling and kissing and weeping; That's not in my way; I'd as lief you were heaping Your fine-scholar words into fine tricks of speech— Though they bite in the quick, and stick fast as a leech. I am your mother, and loved you well, But I never could babble and prattle, or jingle Small rhymes like a fool with a cap and bell, Or an idiot bird in the dewy dingle Squirming away to the gaping forms That care for nothing but slugs and worms. Baby or boy, it was not from me That you learned to be mawkish and womanly. Cautious and scrupulous!—You have no doubt You can do what I wish, but you just wish to know it!— Go, leave me alone; I can die here without A love that has nothing but fine words to show it. Ay, ay; you'll do well for yourself in the end, Ne'er to sign a blank cheque for lover or friend, Treat the dearest on earth as a possible rogue, Trust none but yourself—it's the wisdom in vogue, The counting-house wisdom, proper for those Of the clerk and the shopkeeper kind, I suppose. And yet I've heard say, by wise men in my day, That none are outwitted so easy as they Who reckon with all men as if they suspect them, And traffic in caution, and watch to detect them. But no doubt, you're wise; far wiser than I; Go your way, then, and leave your old mother to lie In the death-grips of nature, and wrestle it out, With a weight on her heart and a fire in her brain, In death as in life, alone with her pain, Alone with the devils within and without. A minister! Tush, they are feckless gear— All of the kind now I see or hear. I have been kirk-going all my life, As maiden and mother, as widow and wife: It was the thing that we had to do, Ever as Sabbath or Fast came due, Girl and boy, young man and maiden, Burning with passion, or sorrow-laden; Though why we did it I never knew, Only that others did it too. For the Parsons are dumb dogs, turning round, And scratching their hole in the warmest ground, And laying them down in the sun to wink, Drowsing, and dreaming, and thinking they think, As they mumble the marrowless bones of morals, Like toothless children gnawing their corals, Gnawing their corals to soothe their gums With the kind of watery thought that comes.— Bonnie-like guides with their whilly-wha, All about loving, and nothing of law; All about Gospel, and nothing of hell, All tinkle-tinkling like a bell, And telling you ever that all is well. I heard their sough; but all the time I would con the words of the Hebrew prophet, That crashed on the soul with an awful chime, Like charges of guilt and sin and crime, And burnt them in with the fires of Tophet. Ah! these were men: but your minister, Nowadays, is a weak kind of milliner: Shaven and smooth, the creature stands With soft white hands, and long lawn bands, His weak chest panting a plaintive whine, As he turns into water the sacred wine Given by the prophets strong and divine. That's the one miracle he can do, Turning the wine into water true. Leave the minister, then, to his Sunday's sermon: We have matters of earnest to determine. So you promise me now to do my will, Whether you reckon it good or ill. There, let me see how best to begin The old, old story of trial and sin. Look from the window, boy, and see The bonnie green braes of Borland Glen; Cornland and woodland and lily-white lea, Up to the skyline, hill and tree, All will be yours to the waterhead Where it flows from the bosom of big Knockbain, And the Kelpie's pool lies dark and dead Under the great rocks, towering red, And only the ripple of water-hen Stirs its surface, now and then, As she oars her way from the outer edge Through the bending ring of spotted sedge, And the ring of water-lilies, within, That fringes with beauty the dark pool of sin. O but Borland Glen is dear to me; It cost me dear; but it is not that: Nor yet for its wealth do I love to see Its soft round hills, or its meadows flat; But summer and winter I've been there, Till it filled my heart, and unaware Its beauty stole away my care. There are green oak woods on Brierybrae, And sleek are the kine on Fernielea, Blithe are the holms of Avongray, And the sheep-walks good on Ard-na-shee, And wild thyme blooms, and pansies grow On many a knoll where harebells blow; And I sat, and dreamed there long ago. Yet somehow this day I cannot see Green oak-scrub, or milk-white lea, Or the drooping birch, or the red pinetree, Cows knee-deep in the aftermath, Or lines of sheep on the mountain path, Nothing of all I cared for then— Nought save the frightened water-hen Rippling the pool beyond the edge Of water-lily and spotted sedge. But all the long, green glen is mine, And I'll pay the price that it may be thine: I counted the cost when I had it to do, And I will not shrink when the bill is due. You were a baby when I came here, And I was a widow of half a year, Poorly left when your father died: But I was not one to sit down and pine, And wring my useless hands and whine, While work might be done, and the world was wide. So I came to keep house for the Laird, for all Was going to wreek here in Borland Hall; And he was a far-off cousin; I trow He counted kin with my mother somehow. He was a widower, and he had Only a girl to heir the land; Never before had they failed of a lad To follow his father, good or bad, And take the reins from his failing hand. And it irked the Laird, though he loved her dearly— As well he might, his bonnie May, For meet her late, or meet her early, Ever she met you blithe and gay; Ever so dainty, white and saintly, Scented ever with perfume faintly, Flitting like butterfly over the green In clouds of muslin soft and clean, With a flower in her hair, and a song on her lips, Thrilling with joy to her finger-tips. Yet fondly as he loved the maiden Tripping about in the garden trim, Like a gleam of light, with her figure slim, Now and then he was heavy laden That Borlands of Borland should end with him. I liked her not from the first, for she Came ever between me and a thought Growing up in my heart, and warming me With a hope that gladdened my widowed lot: But soft and silly, she knew it not, And vowed she should be broken-hearted, To be like me from my baby parted. I liked her not, but I will not lie, It was partly because she was better than I, For I was not good, and I did not try. There are people whose blood is honey and milk, And people whose veins are filled with gall; As some are born to the gold and silk, And some must be beggars, and go to the wall; There's a higher than we that orders all. She was gentle and good, and I was not; But I had the wit and the keener thought. So all the while I hated her: She stood between me and the thought That silently in my bosom wrought, Like the leaven that makes so little stir, Yet changes every grain of the meal; I knew it was there, but did not dare To bring it forth to the open air, And face the thought which I liked to feel: Till one day—I can ne'er forget— She bent across the Kelpie's pool, To seize a water-lily wet, That shewed its egg-cup, yellow and full, Just outside the fringe of sedge, As the water-hen oared from the muddy edge; When plunge into the loch she fell, And I felt my heart leap with the hope of Hell. At first, she laughed, then screamed, I ween, As deep she sank in the muddy slush; A little more, and there had been But a bubble of air, and an awful hush, And the whish of the sedges in the wind, And the laughter that rippled my heart and mind.— Nay, stare not so with horror; I Wished it, but did not let her die; I was not wicked enough for that, Though I felt my heart go pit-a-pat, And it was not with sorrow or fear or pain; But I knew the thing that was in me then. It was not of myself I thought, It was not for myself I wrought, It was not hate that prompted me, It was the love I bore to thee: I only sinned, if sin was done, For the love I bore to my only son. And yet you look on your mother's face With a horror-stricken and ghastly stare! I tell you I was not near the place When her stifled scream rose in the air: But I ran, and drew the silly fool, Draggled and dazed, from the Kelpie's pool. That night he vowed that he would make A home for you in Borland Hall, And love you for your mother's sake, Only next to her who was heir of all; And what less could they do or say To her who had saved the bonnie May? Thus it was that you came here, And then my way of life was clear. I saw you playing among the flowers, I heard your laugh in the ringing woods, O'er the tiny nests, and their tiny broods, And I sware that the land should all be ours. You were but a child, not two years old, But your looks were sunny, your ways were bold, And the Laird was fond of you. Had she been A baby like you!—for a moment I thought of it, Till I plainly saw that I could make nought of it— You might have married the pretty May-queen; But she made a doll of you, petted and kissed you, Told you stories, and deared you, and dressed you, Called you her wee pet darling, and won Your love so, she turned my heart into stone; For I—I was selling my soul for you; And there was she, coming between us two. I was not a young mother, and had but you, And she, with the wealth of her youth, would steal The only joy that my heart could feel! Coming about the house just then Was one of your fine-feathered, gay young men, Curled and scented, ringed and gloved, Selfish and useless, and feeble of will, With nothing to do but his time to kill, Take care of himself, and be tenderly loved, Quote the old Poets, and sing the new songs, And talk about younger sons and their wrongs In the evil days he had fallen upon, When they had to compete with the grocer's son— One of the sort that fathers hate, But girls will fancy to be their Fate. Idly he loitered shooting and fishing, And mending the world in the evening with wishing; Idle and listless. What could I do? Was it my affair how he came and went? I could not be keeping her always in view; And I did tell the Laird, and I warned her too, But she only looked injured innocent. So he came and went, though her father forbade, And I saw her sicken of love to the lad, Sicken of love, and saunter away Through the woodland paths in the evening grey, Looking so listless till the hour, Looking so fevered when it came; And I just stood by my drooping flower Quietly seeing her play my game; And who shall say that I was to blame? The Laird did not blame me, with all his wrath,— And terrible was the storm which broke That morning when the household woke, And the little bird was not found in her nest, Nor flitting about the garden path, Nor came evermore to be caressed, Or to fasten the dewy flower in his breast. And he never looked on his bonnie May After she wedded her popinjay. The Laird was a fool—He was sharp with his wit, Critical, clever, but still a fool. With scheme after scheme he was fever-smit, And somebody always made him a tool; But when he was most in his logic-fit, Then most of all would he play the fool. Now, he would lay you out plans sagacious, Of planting, draining, and strange manures; Brimful now of reforms audacious, Oh but he had new-fangled cures, Would have poisoned the sweet-breathed cows in the byre, Only we flung the rank trash in the fire— Every one knew the Laird and his way, And quietly heard what he had to say, But none for a moment thought to obey. He was never so happy as when he had Poets and painters, good or bad, Actors and fiddlers and editor folk, Fishing the water from bank and rock, And gathered at evening round his table, Jesting and drinking, as each was able, And story-telling with laughter long, Till the early cock from the roost would crow, And the laverock lilted his morning song, And it was time for the maids to go A way to the kine on the meadows low. Oh but there was no care or thrift, Only how to spend, and how to shift, How to borrow, and how to lend; And nobody looked to the bitter end. There would be botanists now to dine, Dry as their withered leaves and flowers! We did not stint their meat and wine, We did not grudge the weary hours, Pottering along the glens and brooks With microscopes, or fishing-hooks; But when they spoke of shrubs and trees In other lands beyond the seas, Nothing would do but the Laird must send, And bring them here from the far world's end, Though where to plant them nobody knew, And they rotted away in the sun and dew. And prints and pictures must be bought, Wherever the money was to be got, When he had artist visitors, Though they covered the walls, and stood on the floors, And crowded out in the corridors— Dusty rubbish that cost a ransom. And our rhymers and fiddlers and actors gay Were always borrowing something handsome, And always forgetting the time to pay. But the Laird must be patron of all the arts When he should have been seeing to ploughs and carts; And food and drink were never spared: The factor's books were never squared; And groom in the stable, woodland ranger, Scullion wench, and lass in the byre, All were living at hack and manger, With hardly a peat for the parlour fire: And had I not taken his gear in hand, The Laird would have lost every acre of land. So I looked into this, and saw to that, And had my eye upon everything: There was not a tinker, or beggar's brat Got handful of meal from the kitchen bing, Nor a toothless tyke, or a useless cat Was left to lie on a rug or mat, Doing nought for its meat and drink, But only to lie in the sun and wink. I taught the household, man and maid, To waste not a crumb of their master's bread, To waste not an hour of their master's day, Gadding about as it was their way; But to rise with the sun the whole year round, And to work with the sun in house or ground:— God was working and so must we, They could rest on the Sabbath as well as He: They must do their duty to man and beast, Ere they get food or wage off me; And I would not see their master fleeced, And brought by their waste to poverty.— We had many sharp words; but sharper still The ways that I took to have my will. He was angry, of course, when they complained:— I counted on that—he was grieved and pained; For Borland Hall had always been Noted well for its kindly ways To beast and body, and all who had seen, Feckless creatures! the best of their days; And from mother to daughter, as each had grown, Service there had been handed down. I only said, “We must begin To save the money we cannot win: And all had been waste, and spendthrift all, In stable and bothie, in byre and hall; But service should be service true, If I had anything there to do. Fitter it were his father's son Should clip and pare at the other end Where the waste was most, and the ruin done; But they were neither kith nor friend, That saw, and did nothing to make or mend. Was there not a bond on Brierybrae? And a wadset heavy on Fernielea? And what would he do when his hairs were grey, And the fiddlers had fiddled his land away? And it was breaking my heart to see The wanton waste upon every hand That was robbing him both of house and land.” Thus it was that, day by day, And bit by bit, I got my way. I scraped and pinched, but I saw to it That the Laird was served with all things fit, All in their season, good and plenty:— He was just the man to be nice and dainty. And I gathered moneys, here and there, To meet his bills when they came due: He had careless grown from very care; To be able to pay was something new, And resting on me, scarce aware, He had more of ease than he ever knew. That made him think; so he brought to me Papers to find what his debts might be; He had tried to make out, but he tried in vain; They bothered his head till it ached with pain. That was just what I wished; so I summed up his debts, And sorted his papers, bills and bets; And I made him give heed to the plans I laid— At least he agreed to all I said, And learnt to lean on me, and leant. We thinned the woods, and raised the rent— The land was good, and underlet— And the running bills, with their heavy per cent., And all the careless rust of debt. We began, at once, to be clearing off, Learning never to mind the scoff Of fools that trust in a chance tomorrow, Learning the worth of honest thrift, And the shabbiness of the debtor's shift. So happily now the days went by: Our geniuses were not so many, But happier we for the want of any:— Always hungry and always dry, Always hankering for the penny, Always forgetting the time to pay; I found the means to keep them away. We were not patrons now of art, We heard not many sayings smart: We got not dedications fine, Nor long accounts for costly wine: We were not the great man we had been; We saw not the grand days we had seen; But plack and penny we paid our way, And were not afraid of the reckoning day. He leant on me, and took to you; But he came in the end to stint and pare, Now that he had not a child to heir The hoarded wealth, as it daily grew; And I think I scorned him for his greed Even more than for his wastefulness: It was myself that had sown the seed, And yet I scorned him none the less; He was less of the gallant gentleman, Since all his thoughts upon money ran. He grudged my wage, he grudged to you The schooling meet and the clothing due, And I think it was only in hope to save, And keep together his goods and gear, That he wedded me, when he saw his grave And the end of all things drawing near. But wedded we were, and then he sent, And signed and sealed with the Notary, And over all the land he went— The land he had orderly willed to me, To hold and keep, sell or dispone, Ploughland and pasture, hill and wood, Fishing and messuage, every rood, All the rights that had been his own, And his fathers before him, ages gone, From the big Nine-stanes to the Kelpie's pool, And along the hills to the skyline clear, The good corn lands by the kirk and school, And the sunny haughs for kine and steer, The bonnie green woods of Brierybrae, And the long sheep-walks, and the peat moss blae. It is all set down in a clerkly hand, And he writ me heir of all the land; He was sane in mind and body as you, And he went to kirk and market too. Boy, look not on me so glum and cold: I did nothing was wrong; or if I did It was all for you, that you might hold Your own with the bravest, and none forbid. And so you shall too, whatever they say Of me,—it's little I care for them; For if I have sinned, I am ready to pay The stake that I lost when I played my game. But I did nothing wrong, I did my duty; And the girl was vain in her wilful beauty; And he would never have named me heir, If the thing that I did had not been fair. And your right, at least, has never a flaw; It is sound in morals, and clear in law: My soul may suffer — that's my concern; It can hardly be worse than it has been of late, It can hardly be worse though it frizzle and burn In the quenchless fires of the sinner's fate. But with me and my guilt, you have nothing to do; And you've pledged me your word, if they plea it with you— She and her popinjay husband are dead, But there were children, people said, And it's not to be doubted they'll try the law, And search the will for a loop or flaw— But you'll grip to the land, and be laird of all The bonnie green glen, and Borland Hall. What say you? what?—You cannot do it! You take back your word that you gave ere you knew it! You palter with faith, and play with an oath, Hard on your mother, and false to your troth! You have scruples, forsooth, to do my will, But never a scruple to break your word, Never a scruple, although you kill The mother that bore you, and loved you still Better, woe's me! than she loved her Lord! Can it be I have sold my soul for nought, Counting the cost, and ready to pay? Shall I fail in the thing so dearly bought? And you—will you be the one to say, “She gambled away her soul for me; And only the devil shall profit by it?” Hark! how the wind is howling! see The sun is out in its maddest riot; How the great trees moan and creak, and toss Their big arms, hairy and rough with moss, And shake to their roots with ‘the sudden shocks! Terrible to the cowering flocks. I knew they would come, and let them come: I never had faith in the dainty hum Of new-fangled doctrine buzzed about, As if hell and the devil were all a doubt. But let them come; I am well content Eternal justice should be done, And the guilty reap their punishment, And the Lord be true, and He alone. But I have your oath, and I hold you to it, And earth or heaven may not undo it, Your oath on the book, and you'll keep it truly, And grip to the land I have willed you duly. If her bairns are poor, there is money in hand, Quite as much as the worth of the land When I took the charge of it;—give them that; I have not squandered goods or gear, Nor wasted any gift I gat On belly or back, this many a year; But seeing the break-neck laird of Rhynns Racing as fast as horse and bet Could run him into the black Gazette, I thought we might add his scrubs and whins, Some day yet, to our bonnie glen— They're better sport for gentlemen.— But give them the gold, if they make a rout; Maybe it were a good turn to me, If you helped them a bit in their poverty,— But that's little better than papistry.— Only grip to the land, and plea it out; It is yours by right, there is never a doubt. Scarce were the words from her mouth, when, lo! the hand with its puckered skin Powerless fell at her side, her side that was all drawn in By a sudden stroke, and her eyes were hard and set, and she tried Vainly to say something more. Wildly he pled with her, cried For pity to the great Heavens, but she nor they replied; And so it went on through the night, until at cock-crowing she died. BOOK THIRD THE FUNERAL All the day long, and the next night he sat, With the dread Presence, in that chamber dim, And neither stirred nor uttered any word, Nor ate nor drank; and much they grieved thereat; And greatly wondered, greatly pitying him: Nor spake, nor stirred, nor gave one sign of life, Or knowledge of the life that still went on, Like one a-dream, or like a frozen stream With the ice-grip upon its fret and strife, So fixed was he, and changed as into stone. Stony his face, his feelings stony too, Stony and icy was the hard, set eye, And stony felt the heart that would not melt, And all his weary world a desert grew, A wilderness of stones, where dead hopes lie. Hushed were the household, as they came and went A-tiptoe through dim lobby, and dusky room, And whispered low of that heart-breaking woe Which lined the young face as it sternly leant On the clenched hand, and never changed its gloom. They brought him dainties which he never saw, The choicest of the vintage, old and rare; They culled fresh flowers he loved in happier hours, And laid them near him with a silent awe, But they all knew he knew not they were there. Two days he sat with that awed Silence dread, Death's silence, deeper than to be alone, And you could hear hearts beat for very fear, Noting the corded hand, and fixed head Which stared at that white Form with eyes of stone. For as they went in pairs, and passed his door, The charm of terror made them pause and look, And by the sight rouse to more utter fright Their beating hearts that trembled so, before, And no control of reasoned thought would brook. Eerie and lone, the east wind moaning low Billowed the carpets high on lobby and stair, The timid mouse went pattering through the house, And from the roof a spider dropped below, Knotting its thread to his unmoving hair. The dog howled from his kennel, and his chain Harsh grated, as the owl screeched from the barn, A phantom fear seemed ever creeping near, And in the wood the wild cat yelled amain, And boomed the bittern from the lonely tarn. He heeded not, for nought outside he knew, Swept by the rush and whirl of maddening thought, And deaf and blind, with agony of mind, At that dark tale which ever darker grew, And all his soul to desolation brought. For she had been his bulwark 'gainst the sea Of doubts that lashed, and vexed his unquiet spirit; His forest-land that stayed the desert-band And drifting sand-storms from the fields which he Cultured and kept that God might them inherit. Him she had straitly trained in ways of truth And righteousness and piety and awe, Nor spared the rod to drive him unto God, But with a ruthless method taught him ruth, And schooled him in the Gospel by stern law. Yet for that all she taught was surely good, And for that she exalted God supreme In all she did, and all that she forbid, And for that love wrought in her hardest mood, To him she had been type of worth extreme. Now, Heaven and all the gods rushed madly down, Like Dagon's house when its main pillar fell: And truth and right, and all things clean and white, Angel and saint, and the Eternal crown, All, all seemed lost in thickest smoke of Hell. Gone the fond vision of his trustful youth, Gone all the awe of natural reverence, Gone the pure love that seemed of heaven above, Gone all the certainty of worth and truth— The fell-mist clouded every higher sense. Could that be true which she, in falsehood, taught? Could that be good, which, being ill, she praised? And oh the pain, the ache of heart and brain! To think that mother could be base and naught, On whom as God's stern witness he had gazed. For still our common Heaven is seldom reared On solid arch of reason, firmly built, But the high Faith that has to vanquish death Rests on the lap where first we prayed, and feared, And wondered in the dawn of thought and guilt. Still lies its weight on mother-love and truth; And oh the sorrow if her truth should fail! Still its strong bands are her so just commands; And oh the weakness when they break! and youth Finds its Heaven dark, and hears the night-winds wail! On the third day, he went out on the hill, And wandered restless, yet unwearying; Then sat him down, and with a rigid frown Gazed steadfast on the yellow tormentil, And little milk-wort peeping through the ling. Long there he sat, as one by some fell blow Stunned, which had loosened every joint and band, And cast into amazement strange and new All ordered thought, so that he did not know The marks and bearings now of sea or land. But coming from the breezy mountain top, All saw a change, and yet with pain they saw: For lightsome now, the cloud swept from his brow, Words fierce and bitter from his lips would drop, And laughter too that made them creep with awe. Far stranger than the silence and the gloom Seemed now the order sharp, and words precise, And the hard reason that sounded out of season, And satire grim that mocked the very tomb, And clear, cool sense, prompt with its fit advice. Seemed never madness like that perfect sense, Seemed never raving like that reason clear, So out of place, so without touch of grace; Even dull, dim souls that were of judgment dense Drew off, estranged, and shivering, and with fear; Which made him harder than he was before, And tipped his mocking speech with sharper scorn, Till they were all met for the funeral, When the mad impulse taunted them, and tore Away the mask from every face forlorn. This was his thought, These neigh-bours all have known The shameful fact, and yet have silence kept; They made no din, for wealth can gild a sin; They never told me, that I might atone, But fawned like beaten hounds, and round her crept. Hollow and false our life, and this they knew; Hollow and false, although I knew it not; And she is gone, and I am left alone, To right the cruel wrong I did not do;— So bitterly he spake from bitter thought. THE WILL Kinsmen and friends and neighbours, all of you Giving me the sad honour of your presence, I thank you, as I surely ought to do, For judged by looks, you are not here for pleasance: I see each face shaded by doleful gloom, I hear but dismal whispers round the room; And therefore the good custom of our land Offers you wine and cake and potent spirit, Which the sad heart, by scriptural command, Should take upon occasion fit to cheer it: Drink, then, and stint not whisky good or wine, Your souls are heavy, and the cost is mine. Friends, I am young; I wot not how the chief Mourner should act on such occasions solemn,— Whether to bury my face in handkerchief, Or stand up silent as a marble column. I ne'er was at a funeral before, I never saw such faces as I see, I never heard such creaking of a door, And no one swearing at it furiously; Perhaps I should be silent, or should groan— All of you did it when our Pastor here Spake of the crown which had become her own The moment that she left our lower sphere; Forgive me, friends; I am not used to these Appropriate moans, appointed agonies, Which sigh the weary to their place of rest, And groan the saints to mansions of the blest. The Pastor spoke good words and excellent— I hope his name is mentioned in the Will; It will be hard to have canonised a saint, Yet find no church or cleric codicil For all the charity that did by her Handsomely, as became her minister— Yet everybody groaned, and looked as sad As if the glorious crown were something bad. Now, for myself, when once the wick is crushed, I ask not where the light is, which is not, Nor where the music, when the harp is hushed, Nor where the memory which is soon forgot. Death comes to all; that's certain; heaven and hell Are just as you believe, or don't believe: But Faith is hard, and therefore we will leave That matter, if you please, for time to tell: But come or life or death, we all must dine, And come or joy or sorrow, wine is good; And be her gathered savings yours or mine, The Will must needs be read and understood; And therefore when we've laid her in the ground, And smoothed the turf upon the lowly mound, We'll dine here, if you please, and read the Will— And by my Faith it will be rare to see How sinks the glass of most sweet charity At this bequest and that odd codicil. Pray come; I've killed my beeves and broached my wine, The living die, but living, they must dine; The dead depart, but then their goods remain, To soothe our sorrow, and relieve our pain. Some murmured “Shameful!” “Shocking!” “Bad, too bad!” “His mother's funeral too!” and “Drink, I fear!” “Enough to call down judgments on us all”; And others hinted that he must be mad; Yet all came back to feast, who bore the bier. And seated at the head of that full board, Outstretching his great limbs, his eye on fire, Young Austen quaffed the brimming ale, and laughed A scornful laugh, and bade his guests accord Good heed to duty ere they fed desire. We'll take the Will first, as a tooth-some whet; It's hanging o'er us like a pending debt, Spoiling all appetite, forbidding rest With hopes uncertain of a rich bequest: Lo! here are cousins thrice-removed, but blood, Thicker than water, sticks to one like mud. When poor, they wounded not my mother's soul With humbling gifts of money or of dress; But if they shrank with sorrow to condole, They failed not to congratulate success, But when she needed nothing, nought they spared In costly tokens of their fond regard. The Will, the Will, then! she was good and wise; Their blushing virtues, no doubt, they forgot, And did all this as though they did it not; And so the Will will be a glad surprise. And you, her Pastor, faithful to your charge, You scrupled not to tell her, round and large, How hard the rich do find the way to heaven, As camels through a needle's eye are driven. She liked not sermons much, I must confess, Even slighted them as marrowless dry-bones, And wanting bread, she said they gave her stones, But she could not forget your faithfulness. Nor yours, good doctor, ever at her call, But never called, because she physic hated, Moreover she was never sick at all; But still the yearly fee was ne'er abated, Though powder, pill, or potion, great or small, Blister or clyster, never knew in her What healing virtues they might minister. But where is she to whom the place belongs, The bonnie May, so dear to all the glen, Prankt with her flowers, and tripping to her songs In those white robes that witched the hearts of men? Old neighbours, ye whose lives are memories Of better days, when all was sunny and blithe, And in the wet grass ye would stay the scythe To catch her greeting smile at sweet sunrise; She came and went 'mong you a gleam of light, That warmed the heart, and made the old Hall bright; There was no mate seemed good enough for her, Nor any fate but that she would confer Honour upon it, as religion brings Glory and beauty to the highest things. Of course, you're here to see how wrong is righted, And justice to the orphan is requited. The Will, the Will, then; let us have the Will;— For all our hopes it surely must fulfil. They understood him not, but felt the tone Of irony that hardened all his speech, And mocking laughter that, coming quickly after, Crept fast, and tingled keen through flesh and bone. With shock of shame as deep as words might reach. But when the Will was read which all bequeathed, Monies and lands, unto her only son, Nor other name named, but with mark of shame Or bitter taunt, a biting scorn that breathed— A scorn she never hid, and spared to none; Straightway they rose in wrath, and left untasted The ample viands, scowling as they went; And silent long, remembered now the wrong Done to the heir, nor heeded, as they hasted, His urgent pleas that they were weak and faint. Surely they needed food, and must not go Till they had tried his beeves, and drunk his wine; Would not the priest say grace for them at least? And might not some strong waters break the blow? But only the cool lawyer stayed to dine. He stayed to dine, and yet he did not dine; For lo! the heir must have the village poor To eat the feast, unblessed by Christian priest; And he too high and dainty was, and fine, And flouncing forth, indignant, banged the door. So, with the lame and halt and maimed and blind, And all the pauper world for miles about, The feast was high, and noisy revelry, And with their songs they startled the night wind, And shook their tattered duds with drunken shout. For he, with strange, wild recklessness would stir All weird and eerie thoughts to feed his mood, And nought too grim or gruesome seemed for him; Maddened, that night, by memory of her, He shrank from all pure springs of bright or good. So it went on until the morning broke; And when the morning broke he was alone, The household all had vanished from the Hall At the strange coming of the beggar folk, And now again he felt his heart like stone. One only word he spake: “O misery! Never to see her, hear her nevermore, No hope of change—oh pitiful and strange! And she went drifting on that sunless sea, And she lies wrecked upon that silent shore! “Dead! and this wrong unrighted, unrepented! Dead! and to me this horrible bequest! Dead! and my faith, too, dying in her death! Mother, O mother!—if you had relented! But now there is no joy for me or rest!” And at the morning's dawn he rose and went All through the house, and every window barred, And every door he locked on every floor, And with the keys his weary way he bent Along the mountain pathway, rough and hard. Faintly the sunshine tipped the clouds with red, Faintly the spring-birds fluttered into song, The mountain stream rippled as in a dream, And dream-like in the mist the sleek kine fed On the low meadows, moving slow along. And slow and weary up the glen he passed, Weary and slow amid the dim, slant light, Until he stood beside the old pine-wood Above the red crag which its shadow cast O'er the dark pool, and water-lilies white. All round the rim still rustled the tall sedge, Broad leaves of lily paved the pool within, The water-hen, unconscious now of men, Oared herself, rippling outward from the edge. And with her young brood paddled out and in. And standing in the pine-wood's darkling shade, He hurled the keys down, with a mighty curse Upon his lips! his soul in dark eclipse, And with the keys, the Will that she had made, And strode in gloom across the moor and furze. But as he sped along that trackless way, Stumbling o'er snake-like roots that twisted white On the black peat, and caught his hurrying feet, The strong-knit moral fibre claimed its sway, And kindlier feelings brought a sweeter light:— A sweeter light that humbled him, and shed Upon his jagged nature calm rebuke, And made him hate his anger passionate; And by and by he lifted up his head, Knitting his forehead with a resolute look. Lord God, to whom the hidden things belong, Pardon my burdened, darkened spirit, long Prying at every crevice of this wrong. Burdened and darkened, mad to find some light, And in my madness making deeper night; Calm Thou my heart, and help me to do right. I do remember her, the gentle May, Like a soft morning star whose melting ray Hung, lingering, dewy o'er mine early day; Faint as a dream of something white and pure, A shapeless form that search would not endure, Which ever changing, ever seemed unsure; Yet ever in its wavering loveliness, It brought to me a sense of tender bliss, Like lips that from the past clung with a kiss A downy cheek that warmly lay on mine, And eyes that shined on me a light divine;— A shadow, and its voice an echo fine! One task remains to me; let me but find The secret of those children left behind; No oath that binds to wrong can ever bind. Or if it do, better the curse I bore Than bind upon a mother evermore This bitter wrong, and bolt her prison door. Too late? I know not, for He changeth not; Too late? Our hearts change, and they change our lot; Who ever changed, and yet no mercy got? But be it fruitful of a curse on me; And be it fruitless, mother, now to thee; It is the right, and that is all we see. BOOK FOURTH THE HOWFF A little cottage, trim and neat, The simple home of simple folk, Stood by itself, well off the street, Not far from where the two roads meet Beneath the dingy Town-house clock: The Howff, or haunt of favoured youth, The envy of the lads who yet Had to make good their love of truth, Whether the way were rough or smooth, By fearless thought or searching wit. It was an University For all the spirits bright and free. Weekly they met, and held discourse Of science, and its march sublime, And what is Matter, what is Force, And what Creation, and the course Of its development in time; Nor was the policy forgot Of nations, though the man was more, The nation less than in the thought Of many, and they counted not To remedy the ills he bore, And fill his cup unto the brim, Yet have no remedy for him. And still their converse verged on things, More sacred, where the reason passed From common earth, and needed wings To soar up to those higher springs That lie amid the shadows vast Where God dwells, making darkness light Unto the faith that can attain: And some of them beheld the light, And some were in a chill dark night, And some were hesitating, fain To give old words a novel sense; But all were full of reverence. A sister and a brother there Kept house together, rich in love, And in the thoughts that filled the air, And sympathies that everywhere, Around, beneath them, and above Found kindred souls and faithful friends, For that they had the master-key— The love that all things comprehends, And opens every heart, and bends All to its clear simplicity: Artless and gentle, wise, and true, All wise and gentle souls they drew. Yet he was but an artizan, And hardly twenty years had seen; A humble, absent, dreamy man, Whose mind on mathematics ran, Or planned some new machine; And guileless as a child was he, Yet daring as a man who walks, In his most meek simplicity, In a far world of theory, And with the hard world seldom talks, Or tests his visionary thought By the experience it has bought. An artizan, but artist too, Inventive; none like him could make The optic glass, and shape it true, And polish it for perfect view Of far-off hidden stars that break The blank black spaces in the sky. And he, by mathematic fit, Knew when to turn the searching eye Upon the field where it must lie, And seek till he discovered it; And therefore science crowned his name With its award of early fame. And he was greatly loved, but still More loving, and by all esteemed For upright walk, and curious skill, Inventive thought, and steadfast will, Yea, even for the dreams he dreamed; So true he was, and seeking truth, So rich in multifarious lore, So patient with impetuous youth, So helpful oft their path to smooth By drawing from his varied store; So humbly reverent of the wise, It humbled them to watch his eyes. But she, his sister, fond and brave, And jealous of his due respect, Who rose up like a threatening wave, And proudly curled her lip, and gave Such glance of scorn, with head erect, When some one risked a thoughtless jest At his abstract and dreamy mood— She held him wisest, truest, best; And in protecting, but expressed Her reverence for a soul that stood Above the common world as far As some serene and distant star. A glorious girl, high-thoughted, bright And beautiful, with woman's sense, And woman's tact, and keen insight, A loving heart, and gay and light In her assured innocence; A scholar eager still to learn, A teacher careful to instruct, She toiled her daily bread to earn, She toiled high wisdom to discern, And in the pleasant evenings pluckt The fruit that was her young life's dream, To see him held in such esteem. Chiefly she had with men conversed, Men of fresh mind and generous heart,— With youth in noble dreams immersed, And sages, rich in lore, who erst Had dreamt like dreams of life and art; And therefore she more womanly And gentle was than other girls Whose gossip is with women; she Enshrined in her clear modesty, And walking pure amid its perils, Was worshipped like a saint, and grew More womanly the more she knew. Here had their widowed mother spent, In patient toil, her latter days, Days sweetened by a blithe content, And by a household love that lent Sunshine and song to all her ways; And by respect of all the wise, And by the love of all the good, And by the faith whose hopes arise, Like evening stars in darkening skies, Soft-pulsing o'er the dewy wood; And the fine odour of her grace Still fondly lingered in the place. PAUL GAUNT In the still old town Where the minster towers Toll the passing hours To the chiming College Crown, Sat the sister and her brother In their quiet room, Amid the gathering gloom Of murky storm-girt weather; She restless fingers twitching, And he absorbed in sketching. With a long, low wail Moaned the fateful sea, Foretelling woeful tale Of wreck and misery By and by to be: And the fisher-women, Gathering in bands, With the cry of human Anguish wrung their hands, Gazing seaward ever With a yearning and a shiver, As they searched the wave and spray For the boats that sailed away At the dawning of the day. Deep wrapt up in scheming Was his inventive brain, While his sister, fondly dreaming, Seemed to nurse an aching pain, And the women's eyes were streaming Tears upon the sand like rain. But mastered by the craving Of inventive thought, How the sea was raving Then he heeded not, Nor how hearts were braving, Or trembling, at their lot. On a forehead massive Brooded thought serene; Seemed his face impassive, And features sharp and lean— Features thin and pale and lean; Fingers long and steady Held pencil ever ready For some new machine Shaping in his brain, I ween. And her restless fingers twitched As he brooded on, and sketched, And the fisher-women gazed From the sand-dunes, numb and dazed; But he neither felt nor wondered At the anguish of their pain, Only silent sat, and pondered! Tracing o'er and o'er again Novel figures from his brain. So he often found relief From the bitter thought of grief Which his heart was keen to feel, But his hand was weak to heal; And the world was all forgot In his novel forms of thought, Though its passion and its pain Gave the hint on which he wrought. Then his sister, turning slowly, With a wistful melancholy, As of one with listening weary, As of one with waiting dreary, As of one who had a pain Lying where a joy had lain, Said, “The sky is wild and eerie, And I fear there will be sorrow On the sea, and on the land A dread of the to-morrow, And the forms upon the sand. I am heavy as I think; I am dull and scarce know why; But I feel as on the brink Of some unknown misery. Shall I sing? You must be weary: And that pencil-scratch is dreary With its monotone. I'll hum Something just as it will come, Something just as it is sent— Never mind the instrument.” Milly Gaunt's Song —Late, late. Late, late in May the hawthorn burst in bloom, Long searched by chill blasts from the nipping East; Late, late the fire-balls flamed upon the broom, And golden-barrèd bees began to feast. Late, late the bluebells in the forest glade Made skyey patches, starred with primrose sheen, And lady-ferns, uncoiling in the shade, Turned serpent-folds to plumes of waving green. Late, late the bright fringe tipped the branching spruce, And golden fingers sprouted on the pine; And June came in before the curls were loose Of gay laburnum in the clear sunshine. Late, late they came, but yet they came at last, Lilac, laburnum, sweet Forget-me-not; But waiting for my summer, summer passed In flowerless hoping, and in fruitless thought. Came sunshine to the blossoms and the flowers, Came gladness to the earth and wandering bee, Came balmy airs and dews and tender showers, But my spring never came, for ne'er came he. Paul. —Why, Milly dear, what is the matter with you? There's a crack in your voice, and a shake in your head, As if out on the strike, and with nothing to do, You had gone to the street with a baby or two, And a ballad to sing for your bread. Come try something else, and we'll see what is wrong, And how that cracked quaver got into your song. Milly sings again —Row, Burnie, Row Row, burnie, row Through the bracken-glen; Row, burnie, row By the haunts of men; Where the golden cowslips glint, Through the wild thyme and the mint, By the barley and the lint; Row, burnie, row. Row, burnie, row Tinkling under heather bells; Row, burnie, row Down to where my true love dwells; Singing songs down to the sea, Singing of the hill countrie, Singing to my love from me: Row, burnie, row. Row, burnie, row To him that's far awa, Row, burnie, row, And mind him o' us a'. Say there's naething to regret, Say I never can forget, Say I lo'e him dearly yet: Row, burnie, row. Row, burnie, row Through the gowans white, Row, burnie, row, Gleaming in the light: Let ilka ripple bear Fond kisses to him there; O my heart it's longing sair, Row, burnie, row. Paul. —There, that's how a girl should sing. I've been forgetting, While puzzling out notions that nobody heeds, Stupid owl that I am! not to see you were fretting, While I sit here all day, neither gaining nor getting, With the fancies an idle head breeds. Yet there's something in this one, I think; but it's true, I always think that while the fancy is new. Milly. —Yes, Paul, I'm sure there is, There's always something in it: Only leave it for a minute, For it's worse than loneliness When you sit beside me silent, Like some shadowy mountain island Washed by waves I cannot see, Hid in canopy of clouds, Peopled too by shining crowds That speak to you, but not to me. It's like waiting—don't you see?— By some veilèd mystery. Don't go back, now, to your scheming; It will do you good to rest; Thought will drift away to dreaming In a brain too hardly pressed: And this strike so long has been That my little purse grows lean. Paul. —Ah! the strike!—yes, it's dreadful, I know: it is war For the wealth of the rich, but the life of the poor: Our new, modern warfare, and holier far Than ever was bannered by Cross or star, Or battled by hero pure: It is Capital, gathered on credit, that stands Against Capital, gathered in brains and hands. I'm a workman, dear, and I mean to be; I like the sound of the hammer and saw, And the feel of a file in my hands, and to see Work neatly done, as it ought to be, Turned out without fault or flaw, Nut and rivet and nail and screw All driven home, dear, right and true. I hate a fellow that scamps his job, False work never yet won the day; I'd sooner footpad it, and steal and rob, Or go pick-pocketing through a mob, Than play that dirty play; It's the pride of our land that the work is good In its wool and cotton, and iron and wood. Let us stand by our order, then, fighting it out: True men they are, in the main, and right; The quarrel is good, and our hearts are stout, And every one knows what it's all about, And our patience is our might: A fairer wage, and a shorter day, It is time we had time to think and pray. Yes, the strike is right: it is war, of course, And in war we must count upon rubs and blows; And who may be better, and who may be worse, Who may be stricken with grief and remorse, Only the end shall disclose: But true to each other, our life will be more And fuller and richer than ever before. Milly. —Ah! well, I do not know; I hope it may be so. But I judge by what I see, And my heart is failing me. Have you heard young Darrel's song Of the famine of the coal? Some will have it he is wrong, Though he sings with all his soul, Till my blood is tingling hot, Thinking of the poor man's lot. Song— The Coal Famine Coal, nor wood, nor peat, Nothing to put in the grate! And the east wind hurtling along the street, Dashing the windows with rain and sleet, And sifting through roofing and slate. What are the bairns to do, With their duds so worn and thin, For all the day long, all the night through, Shaking the soot from the smokeless flue, The gusts come roaring in? Oh I miss their noisy din, That once had made me scold, For now they are sitting so pinched and thin, With a shiver without, and a gnawing within, Silent, and dreary and cold. For there's little to boil or bake, Little to roast or fry, Little of daylight when we wake, Little to do but shiver and shake As the chill, dark hours go by. The great lord's iron heel, The rich man's selfish pride They were hard to bear; but it's worse to feel The poor man turning a heart of steel To the poor man at his side. Milly. —So Darrel sings his song; Some will have it he is wrong, Who are also wise and good, Yet the poet's eye sees more Than is often understood By the Reason we adore. Listen to the cry bewildering Of the women at the doors, And the wail of the small children Lying hungry on the floors, While the lads draw in their breath With their lips as white as death. Great their patience to endure, And if strikes will bring a cure To their ills, why, fight it out: But for aught that's come about Hitherto, to me they seem The lean kine in Pharaoh's dream, Eating up the bigger wage By their idleness and debt, Hurrying down another stage To a sorrow deeper yet. Oh I do not understand— We women never do— But I somehow think the land Was kindlier to the hand Of the workman long ago, When the furnace ne'er was quenched. And the work was never flinched, Nor the bellows ceased to blow On the cinders all aglow. Paul. —Why, of course, it was, Milly: for master and man Were brothers, and stood by each other then; They ate at the same board, and drank the same can, And the Master was master, and true artizan, And knew all the craft of his men: He was not a fellow that handled quills With a head for nothing but “doing bills.” And his men were men to him, not mere hands, And their only quarrel was who should smite The deftest blows where the anvil stands; And they were not driven by rough commands Off to the left and right.— Ah! a little more human brotherhood Would go far to sweeten the workman's mood. That's what is wrong, dear. The wealth of the land Comes from the forge and the smithy and mine, From hammer and chisel, and wheel and band, And the thinking brain, and the skilful hand, And yet we must toil and pine, That one may be rich by driving quills, And a floating credit of Banker's bills. They call that capital! it is a lie; The capital force of the country still Is the power of work, the nice-judging eye, The brain to perfect machinery, And the knack of well-trained skill; These are the source of all our gains; Much your credit will do without hands and brains. Just then on the creaking stair A weary step was heard, And she started from her chair With an eager, wistful air, And her heaving bosom stirred, But she uttered not a word, Only drew a long breath in Till her parted lips grew thin, Only flushed o'er all her face, With a look of tender grace, As a worn and haggard man Dragged his form into the room, Coming from the murky gloom With a ghastly face and wan, And great eyes all aflame. Seemed the gaunt and lanky form Like the spirit of the storm, Haggard at the work he came To perform. Then Paul: “Why, Milly dear, It is Lyell; what is wrong? He is wet and ill, I fear; But we'll give him hearty cheer: Welcome, brother, come along: Never welcomer to me Face of one long lost at sea Coming unexpectedly.” Austen. —What is wrong, Paul? Nothing that I know of; all is right. In this best of possible worlds, how should anything be wrong? All is ordered, man, by perfect love and wisdom Infinite, To go smooth as your machinery, and blithe as Milly's song. As for me, I have been going up and down, and to and fro, Like a personage you've read of in that queer old Book of Job, With a tinker, given to drinking, and his company was low, But he taught me one or two things that are happening on our globe; And my old professor says nothing's worthy more of praise Than an ardent thirst for knowledge in our curious youthful days. We camped in woodland corners 'mong the oak scrub and the broom, With a clear stream tinkling near us, and the pine-scents in the air, And our beds were white and fragrant with the hawthorn's falling bloom, And our caldron daily smoking with the coney and the hare: These fellows have an eye for the picturesque and pleasant, And a gentlemanly taste, too, for partridge, grouse, and pheasant. And he taught me no small wisdom, which is good for human souls, About the call of night-birds, about weasels, about moles, About salmon in their season, and to track the honey-bee, About stalking of the red-deer, and all bird economy, About tinkering of kettles, and cookery of game, About doctoring of horses, and transmuting of the same, About spaeing people's fortunes, and breeding in and in, And also a philosophy that quite gets rid of sin. Yet we had to part; and also I hope never more to meet him, He was such an arrant scoundrel, vermin worse than any rat; And though I'm not particular, I really had to beat him, And there's no gospel surer than that I was right in that. Now, I want a job of work, Paul; I have thews and sinews strong, And the arm that beat the gipsy might wheel a barrow 'long. I cannot be a craftsman, I cannot ply a tool, I cannot use the chisel and the hammer and the rule; I know nothing of your art, lad; but I could bear a hod, And handle pick and shovel, and carry earth and sod. Will you find me work to do, then? I am tired of working brains, Like a treadmill yielding nothing but my labour for my pains. A strike among the workmen! That's unlucky, I confess: I don't much wonder at it, but I'm soory none the less: Sorry for myself, perhaps; for it rather mars my scheme; But like other hopes I've cherished, it was maybe all a dream: And I think I feel their troubles even keener than my own— I have had so many lately it is not worth while to moan For another more or less; one is stunned upon the wheel By the first sharp wrench of agony; the rest you hardly feel: They are but the after-pains of an anguish that is past, Natural throbbings of the sorrow which your life has overcast.— Yes, of course, you have the right to work or idle, as ye will, To quench the blazing forges, and to stop the humming mill, And all the other rights by which you hope to right your wrongs, And by and by to turn the people's sorrows into songs. Yet there are noblest rights which the noble only use In fearfulness and trembling for the passions they let loose. Nations have the right of battle—none more sacred that I know Than the right to take your weapon, and to hurl it at your foe, The right to kill a creature made in likeness of his God, To trample a grand being underneath the reeking sod. Yet the wanton use of battle is the shame of history, Turning back the tide of progress, and of man's prosperity. This is now your day of power—and I am glad that it is yours; But shall workmen just repeat the sin of kings and conquerors? As the nations cease from battle, shall the classes rouse the fray, And scatter wanton sorrow for a shilling more a day? And what, now, if your fellows, lounging near the pot-house, idle, Get to loaf about, and like it, get to hate both spur and bridle? Lose the habit of hard labour, with its manliness; and then Comes the wreck of all you hope for in the wreck of noble men? When you organise a strike, it is war you organise; But to organise our labour were the labour of the wise, To bind it all together in the bundle of one life, Manifold in gift and service, linked as husband unto wife, With a common fund of skill and thrift. That partly was my thought When I came to you: I dreamt that, if I shared their weary lot, If I got a fustian jacket, and a hammer, and a file, Or wheeled the hodman's barrow, if for nothing better fit, And ate the bread of labour, maybe sweetened with a smile, And faced an earnest Universe as earnestly as It, Then some day they might trust me; for I know that they are jealous Of the patronage outside them, but will hearken to their fellows Who have laboured at the bench with them, and handled the same tools, And who know the hearts of workmen, that they are not rogues nor fools. Ah! well; no matter now; I daresay that was all a dream; But my way of life is changed, Paul; my sunshine was a gleam Through storm-clouds darkly gathering, now the sky is overcast, Like the day there, out of doors, where the rain is pelting fast; And I somehow cannot hang on to the skirts of the genteel, I would make the change as thorough as the change in heart I feel; The more obscure my life is the fitter now for me, The more mechanical its toil the happier I shall be; Though I look not for much happiness, yet that may also come; At least I will not whine; if I have grief I can be dumb. Can you help me, Paul? I must have work, and yet some leisure too; Some day I'll tell you more, perhaps—yet wherefore burden you? Enough; I must have leisure, for I have a task to do. Paul, with sorrow, caught the tone Of the sorrow of his friend; Yet he made as if its moan Were a thing for mirth alone, And it seemed that he would spend All his shafts of homely wit And of ridicule on it. To think of Lyell with a file Grinding slowly at a wheel! Or with hod of lime or tile, Tramping where the gangways reel! Or smiting with a hammer, 'Mid the clangour and the clamour Of the anvil and the bellows And the smithy, and the fellows Who can nothing more than play Mighty hammers, day by day! He, the scholar of his year, Knowing Latin, knowing Greek, Knowing all you'd care to hear, Knowing all that sages speak Of number and of form, Of the laws that guide the storm, Of fluids and their powers, And of how they may be ours!— Laughing light, and chuckling low As he tossed it to and fro, Paul kept playing with the thought, Mocking at it, scorning it, Jesting with the kind of wit Which a loving heart will hit, Though of humour knowing nought. Then he said that one who knew him Had lately spoken to him Something about editing A newspaper—which, of course, Was ridiculous, and worse— But it was the very thing For Austen with his free Flowing pen, and fresh discourse. Oh the pleasure it would be, Reading leaders every night Sparkling with a modern light, Yet with wisdom from the ages Mellowing all the thoughtful pages! Would not Milly surely like Austen's papers on the strike? And perhaps himself might pen Just a letter now and then. In silence Austen heard, Never uttering a word, But the strong lip gave a quiver, And his head bowed very low, And there was a tremulous shiver, Like the ripple on a river When a passing wind doth blow, And the tears began to flow— Tears that sorrow failed to bring, But the touch of love unsealed, Like the coming of a spring That awoke the heart it healed. And the others did not speak, For they knew that words are weak As the drip of falling rain 'Mid the silence of our pain, And in his grief they saw Something touching them with awe, Something more than natural grief, Something more than met the eye, Something mad for the relief Of a helpful sympathy. Now, because the strain was o'er, He yielded to the throng Of better thoughts that rushed along Through every open door, And every chamber of his mind, Uncontrolled and unconfined. Wild, without, the wind was roaring, Wild, without, the rain was pouring, Battering on the window pane; And the sullen waves were crashing Loud amid the angry dashing Of the drifting sleet and rain. Wild the anguish of his pain, Yet they bade it not to cease, For it was the way of peace. Left alone, ere long, she went Softly to her instrument, Touched a chord or two, and then Deftly warbled forth a strain, Not without its shade of pain. Milly (alone) sings— So she went Drifting So she went drifting, drifting Over the sea, Thinking that others were shifting; Surely not she. She no anchor had lifted, Meant not to move; Only she slowly drifted Deep into love. Oh she had held that a maiden Should not be first To sigh with a heart love-laden, And long and thirst; And mad at herself for her longing, Hard things she said, Then was mad at herself for wronging The love she had. He knew not how she was yearning Just for a word, And went on his way discerning Nothing he heard: Only he sometimes wondered What she could mean— Oh had he only pondered He might have seen. So she went drifting, drifting Day after day; So he went shifting, shifting, Farther away; Oh but a word would have done it— Word never spoken; So she went drifting, drifting With her heart broken. BOOK FIFTH VISITORS That night, though the storm was still raging, Austen and Paul went forth, Arm in arm, braving the rain, and the chill roaring wind from the North; It was nine on the Minster-clock as they knocked at a staring green door,— Grass-green it of the brightest,—and a big brass plate on it bore The name, Andrew Downie, Esquire, in letters readable, large, All staring out of the panel, shining and big as a targe. Yet he was kindly and human, a plump, little man by the fire, Slippered and cheery, drawing the wine and the walnuts nigher, Not without kettle on hob, not without spirit-case too, For an easy bachelor evening, lonely, with nothing to do: Prosy and garrulous he, and his face brightened gladly to see Paul and his student friend come to give him their company. ANDREW DOWNIE, Esq. Try the port, sir; it ought to be good, It cost me a mint of money; It's been twenty years out of the wood, With a taste of the olives it should Go down just like new milk and honey. I bought it in, let me say, When we sold up old Drumkeller; He was famed for his wines in his day, And the Duke carried half away, But the rest came to my poor cellar. It was I that wound up his affairs, And a pretty mess they were in: He had gone on 'Change, and the bears Turned his acres quickly to shares; They'd have robbed him soon of his skin. He was bit with the railways first, And then he went in for mines, Wheal-Bwbl, Wheal Dydl, Wheal Wuhrst,— I lost a big thing when they burst; But they smashed him clean off the lines. We sold him up for a song To a stupid stocking-weaver; I always thought we were wrong: And he did not hold out long— Heart, they said—but it was his liver. Had we waited, instead of a loss, He might have been good for a million; There was shale in those acres of moss, The laird and his pony would cross, With his wife sticking fast to the pillion. I told them to wait; peats may blaze, But they don't fly away in a hurry: But money was tight in those days, And the Banks took to watching your ways, So we sold, like fools, in a flurry. Well, I bought in his port, as I said, And it's sound every bottle as yet, Every cork with a wig on its head, And a bouquet might quicken the dead, Or savour a bailie with wit. But you sip it as if you were stung; You'd prefer it perhaps with more body? Old port for old fellows; the young Like the smack of the wood and the bung, Or even the flavour of toddy. Not drink! and a man in your line! Well, I don't set up for a teacher, But a lad that don't take to his wine Will not do for a learnèd divine, Or a popular, orthodox preacher. All the sound, solid parsons, I wist, Drink their port with a kindly good will; But your cold water dulls them like mist, Or they get some heretical twist, And go on, like the clack of a mill. Oh, you're not in the preaching way; You have come here about the newspaper; But these Editor fellows, they say, Must be soaked, like a wick, half the day Ere they light up their evening taper. Well; I'd not have believed it before That so many men of ability Could be standing about by the score, Looking out for an open door, And a job with a little gentility. Look there, at that huge pile of letters:— And that's not the half I am sure:— All scholars, sir, greatly my betters, All versed in political matters, And Science and Literature. What a wealth of brains there must be In this fine old country of ours, Which nobody ever can see, Till he advertises like me For a man of “original powers.” One has written reviews for the Times, One, paragraphs for the Spectator, One encloses a copy of rhymes, And another, he rings the chimes On an “Own Correspondent's” letter. And there's none of them but would as soon Criticise the Almighty as not, And see that the angels kept tune, And watch that the sun and the moon Do not squander the light they have got. Clever fellows, Sir, wonderful clever! But I want an original mind; And these run in the same rut for ever, Differing only in state of the liver, And amount of lungs for wind. You see, I have nothing to do: I made a bit money, and stopt, Then I tried this and that, with a view Of getting some happiness too, Ere my blossom of life was cropt. I had hard lines, most of my days, Rose just, as they say, from the gutters, Knew little of children's plays, Or country-folk and their ways, Since I learnt how to take down the shutters. We are all of us self-made here; So is every one worth his meat; And I don't know I ever was near So happy and proud as the year That I swept the rooms tidy and neat. Then I thought myself something. I'd stop And laugh, 'mid the dust right out, Looking down on the boys in a shop; And oh what a glory of Hope Seemed floating then all round about! Well, I made some money, and then I thought I would travel a while; That enlarges the mind of men; So they say, but nine out of ten Might as well sit and swing on a stile. Those French fellows gabbled so fast I could not make out what they said, And they shrugged and smiled, and went past, When I spoke their own tongue, till at last I was well-nigh losing my head. So I wearied of big empty Kirks, And cafés and pictures and shows, And the old German towns with their Storks, And Rome with its wonderful works, And the Alps with their guides and snows. Enlarge my mind, did you say?— Not a bit, Sir; I came as I went! It was six months of wearisome play, And some photographs got by the way, And food, like a long fast in Lent. After that, I bought an estate, Running still in a rut like the rest; I had better have bought a bad debt, For my money ran down like a spate, And my bogs grew an absolute pest. Rural life, lads, is all a mistake, Seeing nothing but grass fields and botany, And sleek, stupid cows half awake; And the birds your morning sleep break, And weary you with their monotony. I used to go sauntering round, And stare at my turnip drills, Or watch the old crows as they found Twisting worms in the fresh-ploughed ground, Or the shadows flit over the hills. But what human soul could exist On a vision of shadows and crows, And the trailing of clouds and mist, Or the thought of the worms as they twist Where the turnip or mangold grows? So I filled with fish-tackle red books, Sticking flies round my hat out and in; But the trout picked the bait from my hooks, And sniffed at my flies in their nooks, Though they jumped to a boy's crooked pin. Well, of all stupid sports that I know The absurdest is catching your fish, Getting tired as you walk to and fro, Getting wet, too, for nothing, although A sixpence would get you a dish. As to shooting, no bird would remain For a good steady shot; but as fast As the pointers would point, they were fain To be off, and I peppered in vain As they rose with a whir, and flew past. No; the country is stupid, or worse; The mice would get drowned in the cream, And then—no butter of course, Or something went wrong with your horse, Or the eggs vanished off like a dream. In the country I never could get What the country is meant to produce; But I got in a hank of debt, Till I advertised it to let, Or to go, if it must, to the deuce. Ah! the town, lads, for me! I don't care Though I never see grass or tree, Nor leave the old market square, For there's true life and motion there, Just to stand on the pavement and see Rural women with butter on blades, Fisher-women with loaded creel; How they chaffer with wives and maids! How they storm through the varying shades Of the passion they feign to feel! You should see the gardeners too, With their carrots and nosegays red: Their gardens always do— And there's nothing you want but you Shall find there, living or dead. Then on Fair-days and hiring-days—Ah! It's as good as a play to be there, As the ploughman jogs up with a straw In his hat, and the lasses guffaw At the jokes that are rife in the Fair. Or on great days, just to see The trades all out in procession, The man who is armed cap-à-pie, And Adam and Eve, and the Tree, And the Serpent, and all the Temptation! Oh, life, lads, there's nothing like life, The stir and crush of the folk, The bargaining, beering, and strife, And the small boys with trumpet or fife, And the gingerbread and the rock! They talk of the fine country air, But it never agreed with me; I'm a town-bird, you see, and don't care For the daisies and butter-cups there, As I do for the dulse and the sea. As for walks—what walk could you take Like a stroll to the point of the pier, To watch how the long tangles shake, And the gull and the kittiwake Dive and bob till your dinner hour's near? But the Newspaper! well, here am I In the town, and with nothing to do, And I hear it is going to die Of a Radical scamp who must try, Forsooth, a halfpenny Review. Now, the paper is part of the Town; It would not be the same place without it; I'd as lief the kirk-steeple fell down: Let it cost me a plack or a crown, We'll print it, sir, never you doubt it. It was always here, as I say, Coming out every week like the Sunday; Quite enough too; I can't see a way To have accidents fresh every day, Or eclipses each Friday and Monday. But business is business, and so We must make it pay, if we can, And I want one whose pen will not go In a rut of set phrases, you know, But a real original man. As to politics, them I don't mind; They go round and round like a jig; I'm a Tory myself, but I find Nothing pays so well as a kind Of steady respectable Whig. You may gird at the parsons a bit, They've got Sunday all to themselves, And don't spare their hearers a whit, But I won't have an infidel wit, Like that fellow Voltaire on the shelves. I'm not pious—I never had time, Though I learned all the Proverbs at school, And some of the Psalms too in rhyme, And I know that Isaiah's sublime, And the Parables beautiful. You must let religion alone; I'll have nought of the infidel kind, We must write in a sound moral tone, And not like that halfpenny drone, But with fresh original mind. And the main thing after all, Must be always the Town's affairs— How the Provost keeps up the ball, And the names the Town-Councillors call Each other, and nobody cares. Then the shipping, and harbour dues, And what's to be done with the bar, And the kirks with their empty pews,— Oh, there's plenty of capital news For the paper, without going far. Then there's accidents, railway smashes, And how the poor shareholder smarts, And the folk struck by fierce lightning-flashes, And now and then mercantile crashes, Or children run over by carts: There's the Circuit-Courts, and the Member, And the soirees wound up with a dance, And the College, of course, in November, And the woman the Queen will remember, With her three little babies at once. There's the stocking-trade, and the police, The catch of herrings and whales, And the cost of the wool in the fleece; Who cares about war or peace When our fishers have stormy gales? If you like, you may give us a claver About folk of the Town long ago, Or a song with some body and flavour, Though I don't deny that I never Read poems, unless I don't know. What we want is the news of the Town To know all about ourselves clearly; Now, I like your looks, I own, And I don't care although I come down, With a hundred-and-fifty yearly. There, I'm tired of these long-winded scrawls; Each harder to read than the other; Oh, they're all of them Peters and Pauls, Apostles of Wisdom that calls In the streets, always making a pother. But you have some sense, for you can Be silent while others are speaking; Now, I've told you all of my plan, Only mind, it is always a man Of original powers I am seeking. When they came out to the street, Austen burst into a shout Of such riotous, loud laughter, which he strove to check in vain, That neighbours to the windows came with curious peering out, As peal on peal rung, echoing, till the mirth grew very pain, And when he would have ceased, it only louder rose again. Why, Paul, he said, at length, you'll kill me with that solemn look: Don't you know, man, I'm an editor, and real “original”— A respectable Whig Editor, with a right to bring to book The Provost and the parsons and the halfpenny Radical, And to freely criticise all the local and the small? Original powers of mind, Paul, to tell the catch of herrings, And the nosegays of red carrots, and the current price of wool, To describe the hiring markets, and the lasses, and their fairings, And profound examinations of our learned grammar school, And the doings of the Councillors who call each other fool? Was there ever luck like mine?—and I just come from playing tinker! Oh the fresh thoughts I shall utter about the whaling ships! If the Bailies only knew that a true original thinker Was to criticise their speeches, and their little snacks and trips! And how that halfpenny Radical shall sink in dark eclipse! There's my destiny at last found, in this queer Universe, To play respectable Whig on a hundred-and-fifty a-year; A man of powers original paid duly to rehearse The condition of the weather and the Provost, who, I hear, Is a man of no condition, and a brewer of small beer. Well, we come into this world, wrapt up in superfine cocoon, Soft and silky, and our business is to reel it off again, And to know ourselves but worms, and care for nought beneath the moon, But to look about for what will eat, and eat it there and then, And get rid of all fine feelings, and high dreams of gods and men. I've been winding my cocoon off quite rapidly of late, And am very nearly naked, and ready to devour All that I can set my teeth too—and I am not delicate— Heaven and earth, they say, shall pass away, like fading autumn flower, But my heaven is gone, and earth alone has gript me with its power. Is it worth while living longer after you have reached the stage When life at last is possible, and you are purged of all The nobler thoughts you cherished, and the hopes of a great age, Coming with diviner visions to reverse the early Fall, And the soul is fairly harnessed to the local and the small? Ah! if one could only leave it, ere all higher dreams have left! Could but die before the death of that which is our life indeed! Could cease to be or ever one is utterly bereft Of that gleam of something better, which may chance to be the seed Of a hope for human hearts, when ours shall cease to beat and bleed! Nay, I do not rave and maunder; I am not a love-sick boy Whose life is all washed out, while he is whining through his teens; But there's that has come upon me, which has taken all the joy From my being; and when one has lost the staff on which he leans— Well, he finds that he is lame, and maybe knows not what it means. Perhaps I'll tell you more, Paul, on some day by and by. Perhaps I'll keep my sorrow to myself —I cannot tell; I know that I can trust you; but then I know not why I should bind upon your spirit that which binds me like a spell, Or lay on you my crushing burden, crushing you as well. I am weary, oh how weary! of all beneath the sun; There's no nature in my laughter, and no sweetness in my thought, I seem to have no Faith or Hope; my lights have one by one Died out, and left an evil smoke: God help me, I am not Good company this evening; better leave me to my lot. BOOK SIXTH MILLY GAUNT After they left, she sat a little while, Now brooding thoughtful, now with flickering smile Playing about her lips, and in her eyes, As the flame flickered in the fire likewise, And leaped up in the curling smoke, or lay Over the coal and purred itself away. Thus she a while to happy fancies yielding A willing tribute of sweet castle-building, Saw in the gleaming coal a hero strong, And a fond lover, and a blissful throng Of varied circumstance and generous life, When maiden blossom fruited into wife; Till looking up, behold an hour had passed! And wondering how the time had flown so fast, She wondered on a little more, to know If still the happy clock as quick would go When fancies grew to facts, and she should be All that the fire had pictured curiously; Then starting up, went tripping down the stair, Singing with cheerful heart a lightsome air— A lightsome air about the gallant lad, Who fired the heather with his white cockade. High beauty her's: a face as marble white, Shaded with glossy braids as black as night, But full of health, and clear intelligence, And cultured grace, and woman's delicate sense. A noble, generous spirit, meet to be The helpmeet of a noble destiny, Strong in all duty, in ambition high, Open in thought, and broad in sympathy, With nothing little, save the little ways Which brighten home, and are a woman's praise. All day she had been teaching in the school, And still at night, though weary of the rule Of noisy mirth and sullen dulness, she Had work to do, and did it cheerfully— Training deft fingers to the finest chords, And wedding the flute-voice to liquid words Of Scottish song, or German lieder good, Or roundelay of France for gayer mood. She had the artist soul and artist voice, And in the gift of song she would rejoice As doth the skylark trilling forth its lay At learly dawn and noon and close of day. Thus giving lessons in the evening, she Lightened home cares by that loved industry. A bright young girl, as glad as summer air, A laughing rosy girl, with sunny hair That loosely rayed about a joyous face Like a gold glory, tripped with winsome grace About her room, when Milly entered singing, And picked a letter up, and gaily flinging It to the ceiling, caught it as it fell, And danced about, and tossed it high and well. “A letter, a letter, Miss Milly, a letter! Now don't stiffen up so, as if you knew better Than to care for a letter that's all about you— Such a wonderful letter, and every word true! And it makes you a lady—but you're that, dear, already— But it makes you out clearly a something that's nearly As good as a Princess, my own Cinderella, Who trots every night, with that horrid umbrella, Through the sleet and the slush to poor me who am nothing But a commonplace lassie with nought of romance. But I always felt sure that you went home to dance With the beautiful Prince who was fuming and frothing Till you came to the ball: and now it's all true! And it's all in the letter that's all about you, Which came to my father this evening, and he Wished you to read it, and gave it to me.” And Milly read the letter, all amazed, Now and then wondering if her wits were dazed, And if she read aright; then read again, The double reading doubling all her pain. It came from Lawyer in a country town To Lawyer in the city, and set down The facts in business order, plain and clear; How in our quiet glens a lady here Died somewhat suddenly not long agone, And left estates unto an only son. They were not hers by right, and yet by law Her title was most sure, without a flaw; Freely she might enjoy them while she breathed, Freely she might bequeath them, as bequeathed. He knew the facts, for he had drawn the will, And Austen Lyell's claim was good as skill Could frame a legal deed to sanction wrong, And rob the orphan, which had grieved him long; Yet had he only done as he was bound, Giving his clients valid law and sound. Now at the funeral this son went mad, Insulted kith and kin, was wholly bad; Mocked at the minister, and laughed at Heaven, Was barely civil to his lawyer even, And gathered all the rogues and beggars near To eat the feast made for his mother's bier: Inexplicable, unless of reason reft. Then on the morrow afterwards he left, No orders given, no charge to anyone, No single duty of a landlord done; Nor had they since heard from him. He was seen, Indeed, that morning on the hillside green Beside a lonesome tarn, and for some days Walked with a gipsy poacher in wild ways, Thigging and sorning. They had dragged the mere And found enough to make his madness clear— The Hall-keys in a bunch, rusty and brown, Also the Will that made the place his own, Which no sane man could leave in such a place; But of himself they had not any trace. Some thought him dead, but most believed him mad, Some held it a good riddance, others sad; However that might be, he had to say The next heir, who was true heir, went away Twenty odd years ago, and had been wed To Gerald Gaunt, and both of them were dead, But there were children; so, at least, 'twas said. Now, would the city lawyer look about, And make inquiries, and resolve the doubt? Were Austen dead, they were the next of kin; If mad, as he believed, from pride and sin, They would have rights to see to, and the Trust Would charge itself with what was right and just: The lands were good, and free from bond and debt, And some loose monies too there were to get; Could he but find the children any way Of Gerald Gaunt and Borland's “Bonnie May.” She closed the letter with a moan of pain: His name was there, and burned into her brain,— His name, who was her secret glory and pride; And yet she could not say he was belied, And cast the misery from her, as the Saint Shook off the poisonous viper; she was faint, And sick at heart, and rose, and said, “Good-night; These are strange tidings, and my head seems light.” “How could he? Oh, how could he?” still she said, “My dream of life is gone, my hope is dead, Torn like the honey-bag from humble bee, Nought left me but a short, sharp agony. How could he?—And my brother loved him so, So trusted him in all of weal or woe, So held him stainless of ignoble thought, The truest friend that ever true life brought!— Oh, it is not the loss of heritage That makes life poor; it is that, stage by stage, Some leave us with a lessening faith in man, And less of love than when our life began, Till one day all our shining heaven shall tell But how the stars once shone, and how they fell. How could he?—And I held him hero true, Trained by the age for what the age must do, Full of its spirit, loyal to its hopes, And past the stage in which it only gropes; A man whom God had ready, when they say, Where is the Leader who shall guide our way? I thought that truth and right was all he craved, And that for truth and right all risks he braved, And that he had a noble wisdom proved; And so I loved him—but 'twas this I loved. How could he? Oh, how could he?” still she said, “My dream of life is gone, my hope is dead.” And so when they came jesting up the stair, And, tickled with quaint fancies, even there A moment paused to let their mirth explode, Their laughter jarred on her, and made her load Press on the sore, till of the sore were born Some bitter thoughts, and biting words of scorn. Sure, of a sudden, they were wondrous merry; She had not thought such grief could be so cheery In so short space; but 'twas a healthy power That healed a breaking heart in half an hour; Easy to break, easy to bind again, 'Twas pity to waste pity on such pain; So children wept and laughed, and that was good But men she wist had been of sterner mood:— She understood not; she was dull, no doubt; But saw not what there was to jest about; It looked to her a noble task for one To chronicle the common life of man, To tell the daily sorrows of the poor, To mirror all the ills that they endure, To watch the tide of mind, and guide its flow, To speak brave words that made the brave heart glow. It was the man made service great or small, For still the noble soul ennobled all It touched, and little natures made it less. And a great heart was throbbing in the Press Which was the prophet's roll of modern man, And faithful record, he might read who ran. But then, of course, it was a jest to think A man of wealth should waste his time and ink On such mean tasks; and yet she once had hoped— No matter what her hope was—there she stopped. Why, Milly, what is wrong? her brother said. And she uplift again the drooping head Which had, a moment, sunk at that sad look That seemed to read her like an open book: Nothing, of course, is wrong; what could be wrong? I think that was the burden of the song Which your friend sung about the Universe. Of course, it is beneath him to rehearse The common things of common folk, or right The wrongs which are not, or which are so light. Then he: “Yes, Milly Gaunt, I said all that; In bitterness of soul I uttered what You echo now in sharper tones than mine, Big words of little wisdom; undivine Because inhuman; yet they were not barbed To rankle, nor in mockery were garbed; They were not good words to remember, yet They were not words to move a deep regret. No matter — they were foolish; I am well Rebuked for speech that, like the hot sparks, fell From burning passion, being fiercely smote, And sputtering words when all unapt for thought. But there is more behind this wrath of thine Than any wild, blind, erring speech of mine. What is it, Milly? Why this bitter blame? I came to you in sorrow and broken shame, And untried poverty, and utter need, Thinking you would not break the bruised reed; For there had fallen on me a hapless fate, A knowledge that has made life desolate, As when the iceberg drifts on some green shore, Clasping its wooded bays, and bending o'er Its sunny meadows, till it lose itself, Melting on sandy beach, and rocky shelf, But blighting all the bright flowers with its breath, And wrapping all the scene in wasteful death. So had my hope all withered by the fact Which drifted on me, without will or act Of mine, and clung to me, and will not part Till its death-chill has frozen all my heart. And when my soul was wrung with its sharp pain, And troubled thoughts were tangling all my brain, You touched me almost unto hope again. For that, I thank you: what has changed your mood I know not, but I owe you only good. In such a gloom even briefest gleam of light Is something, though it sink in deeper night: And what of joy your life has shed on mine And peace and hope be doubly poured on thine.” Deep toned his voice and trembling as he spoke, And its great sorrow answering chords awoke, And almost all her angry purpose broke; For it was ringing with the truth sincere, And deep humility, and she could hear Her heart beat with the beat of perfect faith In all he said, which made her pale as death, And sick at heart, to think that she perchance Wronged the true soul by misjudged circumstance. So she: “This sorrow that you may not tell, Did it concern my brother who loves you well?” “Nay, surely not; nor part nor lot has he In my life, saving in the best of me: Dear Paul! was never sunshine to a scene More than his fellowship to me has been. But if you care to hear, perhaps 'twere well The story of a broken life to tell; For broken it is, like foam upon the sea Caught by the wind, and scattered aimlessly.” Knitting his brows, and gathering up his thought, With lips compressed to hide the pain that wrought And quivered in them, for a while he gazed In brooding silence where the faggot blazed. Then in low tones: “I know not how to speak— If I say little you will deem me weak; If I say more, the more will only blight Another name to set my own name right. Sometimes the half is better than the whole, And sometimes worse than none; the dubious soul Suspects the secret there in what is hid, And holds the rest but trash. I am forbid, By that which is more sacred than my right, To tell you much—to tell you all I might. There are some sorrows cannot be subjected To man's construction, — howsoe'er suspected.” And here he paused a while, and, brooding, gazed Again in silence where the faggot blazed. But Paul said, Never mind, now; let it be; Milly was wrong; I never doubted thee; She will be sorry ere to-morrow come. But she apart, biting her lip, and dumb, With vehement finger crushed a harmless crumb. Then he again: “You hold me rich and proud, Miss Gaunt, and scornful of the common crowd, Which never was a common crowd to me, And now less so than ever, for I see No hope for me except in hope for those Who stir your pity with their unvoiced woes. I too am poor—once reckoned heir of all A goodly pastoral land, a pleasant Hall, And the respects and honours which they bring; But think not I for these am sorrowing. I had no peace until I cast away A claim that could not bear the light of day, The deed of law that was a deed of sin, Which now is gone to pulp and blotches in The water-lilied haunt of tern and coot, Or folds its slush around the brown sedge-root. But life is poor when its old faiths are gone, Poorest when man can trust himself alone.”— She started, for it was her own sad thought He echoed, though he touched a deeper note; But silence kept, as he went on to tell How he had sworn to one who loved him well An oath he feared to break, and dared not keep, Which haunted him by day, and banished sleep With stony horrors from his nights, till he Was nigh distraught with his great misery. Enough; what Milly said was just and true; There was a noble work which one might do, Wielding a truthful pen with heart sincere, In days whose change was big with hope and fear; But he must find the heirs of Borland's May; And then no doubt but Heaven would guide his way. Then she rose pale and trembling, and her eyes Quailed at his glance of questioning surprise; “Can you forgive me?” piteously she pled, “I wronged you in my heart, yet my heart bled To wrong you; and it was not with my will: Yet my heart wronged you—Oh I have done ill. Our mother was May Borland; and I feared”— He heard no more; for never sky was cleared Of close-piled clouds by April wind and sun, Unravelling swift what they before had spun, So suddenly as he from utter sadness, Sodden and dreary, passed into a gladness Of joyous gratulation, that forgot All but the whole relief her words had brought. Oft in their childhood had their mother told, In the long winter evenings dark and cold, Of Borland nestling in its bosk of trees, Of the great lime filled with the hum of bees, Of the tall orchard wall with ivy clad, Where dainty nests the merle and throstle had, Of the three waters blending in the river Near where the red-roofed mill was clacking ever, Of the long windings of the narrow glen The water-lilied pool and water-hen; And how the Borlands had been lairds of all Since the wild Scots drave at the Roman Wall; And how her joyous girlhood had been there, Honoured and petted still as Borland's heir; And how the goodly heritage was lost All for her love, nor did she grudge the cost, Or only for her children sometimes grieved, And for her father's love, which was deceived. These tales the children heard with ear intent; Children are fain to know how mothers spent Their childhood, and to chatter of the day When the grave matron was as blithe as they, And went a-nutting through the autumn woods, Or twined her daisy chain, or sought the nestling broods. And Milly, in her secret thoughts, would dream That some day she should look on hill and stream, And trace her mother's footsteps o'er again, With Paul as Laird of all the long green glen. But he, impatient, called her little fool! To set her heart on sleepy hill and pool, Where life is always only half awake; And dreams, he said, are fetters hard to break; Though they be only shadows you have made, The life seems passing when the shadows fade. As for myself, could any man of sense Abide a dull laird's easy indolence, Whose talk is all of cattle, turnip field, And what the hay crop, what the oats will yield, And how to keep the rabbits and the hares From midnight poacher cunning with his snares? I will be lord of nothing but my mind, I will be held of nothing that can bind To vacant drowsiness the busy brain, Or dull the sense of pleasure or of pain. My days must be where thought has stedfast rule. And skilful fingers deftly ply the tool, And life is growing to a higher sense Of God's design and man's omnipotence. So would he silence her: but all the more She cherished in her heart a secret store Of hopes; and now the time had come when she Saw all she fondly dreamt about to be; But the bright cloud which gleamed, afar, like gold, Felt now as mist about her dim and cold, Or draggled robes that round her limbs enfold. Silent she sat, and humbled and ashamed, And much herself she questioned, much she blamed, More than was meet, for woman's penitent course Is prone to low prostrations of remorse. Close in her bosom that hard letter lay, And seemed to burn, and waste her life away: O cursèd letter! O unhappy day! “What should I do?” thus in her heart she said; “For what love hides is raised as from the dead Some day, and kills the love which covered it, And frankest truth is more than subtle wit:— But it will pain him knowing that I know; And oh the shame! that I should judge him so! But Paul, you will be noble still, and true To the high thought that always guided you?”— Then Paul, unconscious of a great intent, But simply natural, following the bent Of a true heart, and fine instinct of skill, Said: “Milly, you may go now if you will, Turn a fine lady, eat and drink the best, Drive in your carriage, lord it like the rest; You've always had a leaning that way; I Would rather live till nature bids me die, Would rather die than thrive upon the wreck Of one I loved.” Here falling on his neck, She hugged and kissed him, vowing ne'er to part, He had so true a soul, so brave a heart. But Austen: “You must do, Paul, as you will; The land is yours, with duties to fulfil— An heritage which, being lost, implies Loss of high opportunity likewise, Loss of ancestral love which clings to you, Loss of a work which only he can do Who has men's heart, already on his side, Looking to him, and willing to confide. Think, Paul, your heritage is more than fields Of grass and corn, and what the woodland yields, 'Tis something which could never have been mine. The love of all the people which will twine The closer round you from the sense of wrong, Righted at last, which you have suffered long. And there is something in the love our folk Bear to the scion of an ancient stock, May be, unreasonable, may be, more Worthy than things there are good reasons for, But beautiful, at least, and in its trust Nobler than money-bargaining and lust. What of your commune, with its spade and hoe To till the field, where every man should grow Enough for simple life, and still the loud, Gaunt clamours of the swarming city's crowd? Have I not heard you wisely eloquent On lonely glens which only deer frequent, Once filled with homesteads, furrowed by the plough, And clothed with rustling grain and fruitful bough, And how the men whose fathers owned it went, With breaking hearts, to far-off banishment: And bore to rolling prairies in the West A rankling sense of wrong in many a breast, Which made our nation's foes the men who loved it best? Surely you will not cast from you the power To test your cherished thought, and nip the flower When it is at the fruiting. As for me, I have thrown off a load of misery. You call it wreck—I call it haven at last, Where, bruised and battered, but the danger past, I am at peace. Paul, I have felt the strain Of sharp temptation, and the aching pain Of cold and hunger, and of discontent With all myself had done, or God had sent; I have not known the sleep of a right mind, Or ate or drank with honest human kind, Or felt as if I dared, until this night; And you, Paul, would you quench the dawning light That tips my cloud with silver, and breaks in With better hope on this dark world of sin? Now I have found my work, good work and true, And I have found the heart good work to do, Milly was right; it is the man who makes Noble or mean the task he undertakes, Who breathes a godlike spirit into that He has to do, or makes it stale and flat. I see my work before me, and my way Free from embarrassment, and clear as day, Bright with a throng of hopeful services That stir within me with a sense of bliss, Needing but righting of this wrong to be The tide of a new life of joy in me.” He looked at Milly here, and she at him, And as she looked, she felt her eyes grow dim With something gathering in them, then looked down, Conscious that he was conscious of the crown With which her love had crowned him in that look Which dimmed with pride and gladness. Then he took Her hand, and said, “One day, when I have done Good work, Paul, work which you can look upon And say, This true man truly played his part— You'll give me this soft hand; I have her heart I think, already; even as she has mine,— Worth little, but hers to take or to decline.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HILDA AMONG THE BROKEN GODS PROLOGUE It is a Church of the Ages, all Arched and pillared and grandly towered, With many a niche on the buttressed wall, And delicate tracery, scrolled and flowered: Gargoyles gape, and arches fly From base to base of the pinnacles high, And the great cross points to the solemn sky. A stately Church, and a Church all through, Everywhere shaped by a thought divine, With symbols of Him who is Just and True, And emblems of Him who is Bread and Wine; It is dowered with wealth of land and gold, And memories high of the days of old, And of sheep that were lost, gathered into its fold. Lord bishops sleep their slumber deep Under mitre and crosier carved in stone; There are brasses quaint for the warrior saint Who had battled at Acre and Ascalon; In the low-groined crypts lie dukes and earls, Resting now from their plots and quarrels, But they mix not their dust with the rustic carles. It is not day, and it is not dark, And the altar-lights are burning dim; One sings, but it is not priest nor clerk, And he chaunts no psalm, and he sings no hymn. Who are these that are trooping in, With grimy visage, and bearded chin, Rude and unmannered, with noisy din? Some one is wailing—a poor soul ailing Down in the dim aisles far away; Who is that droning? is he intoning The great Athanasian creed to-day? Silence that chatter and laughter there, And do not stand bonneted up to stare— Hush! that is surely the voice of prayer. First Voice They have made Thy Temple a place abhorred, They have mocked Thy Christ, for His own betrayed Him; And now they have taken away my Lord, Ah woe! and I know not where they have laid Him. Second Voice Now that the gods are certainly dead— Brahma and Zeus and the Father, and all— With a desk and a lime-light overhead, We might use this up for a lecture-hall. We could show them things on the altar there— Bringing the light to the proper focus— Wonderful transformations rare, Would beat the priests with their hocus-pocus: With two or three chemicals we could make Nature her miracle-power surrender, And a glass, at the angle fit, would wake As gruesome a ghost as the witch of Endor. Everything here would give point to my hits At the monk's huge faith, and his little wits, As I drive at Bigots, and shout for Truth, And laugh at the dreams of the world's raw youth. Third Voice A pest on all the reforming crew, Savant or Puritan, old or new! See how the rogues come tramping in, Now that they have not to praise or pray— Faugh! what a breath of tobacco and gin! They crowd to church because God is away! And they've smashed that pitying angel's face, That touched one's heart with a tender grace, None of their brute-wits could ever replace. If there be angels good or bad, I very much doubt, and I do not much care; But yet what a pitying look it had, Beaming down from the oriel there! Will no one silence that idiot's chatter About laws, forsooth, of health and riches? I'd rather the old priest's Stabat Mater— If we had but the ordeal now for witches, Wouldn't I souse him into the water! Fourth Voice Anathema Maranatha! Hark! Be he sinner or be he saint, There is no place in the saving Ark For one who keeps but a cobweb faint Of doubt in his heart, or doubt in his head, About any one article I have read. “Credo,” that is the key of heaven; The more incredible, so much more Virtue lies in the Credo, given To open the everlasting door. Thurifer, let the censer wave: “Hoc est corpus,” lift it high; Christ is risen from the stone-sealed grave; Now let us forth with him, and die Into the life that comes thereby. In high procession the priests will go Chaunting the Dies Irae low, Dies illa, sad and slow. So the Church in the days of old, Robed in linen and purple and gold, Foiled the devil, and all his tricks, And drove out the swine with a crucifix. First Voice (far away) “They have taken away my Lord, And I know not where they have laid him!” So it went wailing down the long aisle, Mixed with the hum of the priest and the people; And a shudder passed through the massive pile, From the low-groined crypt to the cross on the steeple: And the glimmering lights on the altar died, No more the priest-hymn sobbed and sighed, But a hollow wind wailed through the transept wide. BOOK FIRST CLAUD MAXWELL, POET I do not blame thee, Hilda; did not blame thee even then When all my life fell dark, and all my way was hard to see; And when I drifted, aimless, among clear-purposed men, Though often wroth at myself, I could never be wroth with thee. Where art thou, where, my darling? for thou art my darling still, So gladsome and so winsome, and in beauty so complete! The old home is as you left it, waiting for my Love to fill Her corner by the fireside, or the sunny window seat. But nevermore thou comest, though evermore I go Where thoughts of thee shall meet me as a sure-returning pain; I cannot keep from that which only keeps alive my woe, And I would not keep from it until thou comest back again. Lonely now the old familiar walks beside the brattling brooks, And lone with awful silence are the evening hours I sit; I think I should go mad, but for the trick of writing books, Though I care but for the writing, not for that which I have writ. Dead is all the old ambition; dead the heart to lettered fame, Though the humour have its pranks yet, and the fancy will have play; I heed not for the Public praise, nor for the Critic's blame, Nor for the larger shadow that I cast upon my way. Oh, my rose was only budding when I laid it on my breast, And I watched the leaves unfolding, and the tender blushes flit; Now my rose is broke and withered—and I broke it whom it blest— Yet the fragrance haunts my life still, and is all that sweetens it. No, I do not blame you, Hilda; we were both of us so young, And I had a peremptory way, ungracious, unbeseeming, And a petulant hot humour, and an often silent tongue Which you thought betokened anger when my mind was only dreaming. But I had no right to dream when I was called to play the man, And to cherish, with fond love, the love that put its trust in me: Better lose the wayward Artist in the drudging Artisan Than take the yoke of love, and live as free among the free. And oh, how could I mar, with one unsettling doubt, the Faith Which consecrated all the homely duty of her days, And winged quick seeds of hope beyond the bounding wall of death To make a life Eternal, full of peace and full of praise? Who would take from any weary head the pillow of its rest, Smoothed by a mother's hand, and leave it so to ache and throb? Or break beneath the unfledged soul the shaped and sheltering nest, And bid it on the bare bough sing, when it can only sob? But we wake in the young morning when the light is breaking forth, And look out on its misty gleams, as if the noon were full; And the Infinite, around, seems but a larger kind of earth Ensphering this, and measured by the self-same handy rule. And doubtful shadows come and go, and we, of nothing sure, Have yet no qualms in trifling with a tranquil faith and true! Ay me! it was her quiet faith that made her heart so pure, Yet I troubled its calm waters with the wanton stones I threw. But oh, I loved you, Hilda, and will love you evermore; I cannot choose but love you, be the anguish what it will, For the very pain of loving is all other joys before: Though you broke my heart in pieces, every bit would love you still. Though you broke my heart in pieces, I would love you more than all Who might seek to bind it up again; for love alone can bind What only love can break; and all the fragments broken small Would but glass as many Hildas in the mirror of my mind. What memories gather round me, sitting by the lonely hearth! They will not leave the house, those flitting ghosts of other days;— Here a whispering, there a rustling, or an echo of old mirth, Or a face out of the darkness with a sad, rebuking gaze. Ah me, but to remember how I placed you with your back Against the old wych-elm tree in the golden summer tide, As we went, with slate and satchel, down the dim, green Lovers' Walk, And half in fear, and half in jest, you vowed to be my bride! But with me it was right earnest; I exulted from that day That mine thou wert, and mine alone, and ever must be mine; And I played protector grandly if our schoolmates in their play Did but touch thy finger roughly, or lift their eyes to thine. Oh, had we ne'er as children played together in the street, Never waded in the burns, nor plaited rushes on the lea, Never busked us with the bluebells, never chanced on earth to meet, Till we looked upon each other when our Love had eyes to see! For cousinship will hardly grow to perfect wedded love; There lacks the charm of wonder, and the mystery of fear; It fits too easy on us, like a worn, familiar glove, And we tend it not so nicely, though we hold it all as dear. I cannot but remember—we were still but girl and boy— That night we went to buy the ring, how fain we were to linger, Half-afraid and half-ashamed to ask about the mystic toy, And how they all slipped loosely up and down the taper-finger. Then our cottage, and the garden with the sea-pink borders! Now, I bethink me, we came to it ere the apple-blossom fell, And the bloom was on our love as the bloom was on the bough, And there was singing in the trees, and in our hearts as well— Singing of our happy fancies, singing of our joyous hopes! All our life was filled with singing, as the skylark fills the sky: Oh the music of that gladness, in our hearts and in the copse, Swelling with a tender sweetness, and the peace that came thereby! Then, the lengthening summer twilights, as we looked down on the river Gleaming silvery in the shallows, glooming darkly in the pools! And the silent, sleepy village, with its blue smoke curling ever— Welcome sight to weary labour plodding homeward with its tools! And the tall green cones of poplar that around the kirkyard stood, And the gilded weather-cock that flashed the sunlight from the spire, And the red glow on the window panes; and then the quiet mood That came on with the stars, and drew us closer to the fire! I would not but remember those welcome, winsome hours That crowned the day's fit labour with fit recompense of rest, And how we watched the laden bees amid the honeyed flowers: Yet I hardly seemed at home in life, but somehow like a guest. There was a feeling haunted me, that all might be untrue— An unreal, phantom idyl—an illusion of the brain; It did not look like fact, but like a dream that only knew The lawlessness of Fancy, and had banished grief and pain. So passed in tender bliss the weeks and months of love and peace, And I wondered when I should awake, and find the dream was gone; So passed the year and day, and still the wonder did not cease, Although there came a frustrate hope that left us still alone. So passed the time in services of love and patient duty, And there was no cloud of trouble, and no fret of wearing strife; And still its memories cling to me, and clothe with dreams of beauty, As with ivy green and wallflower, the dim ruin of my life. For it is a dim, grey ruin where no cheerful work is done, Nor sound of gladness heard, but only moaning of the wind, And lonely desolation sits aweary of the sun, With little caring for myself, and little for my kind. I know that that is wrong; that it is weak to yield to it; That manhood has its duty even when life is cold and grey— Duty never half so noble, nor so strengthening and fit, As when the clouds have gathered thick, and darkened all the day. I plead not for myself; I know that I am weak and poor, A creature of the sunshine, and my sunshine was so brief: I have no heart to struggle now; I only can endure, And let the tide sweep on, as I sit clinging to my grief. What was it, first, that broke the spell, and showed that we were twain— United, and yet sundered by a strain of character? A trifle, yet it smote me with a disappointing pain Sharper than a grief more real, for it marred my thought of her. I had a fond ambition, and she did not share in it; I thought to make her famous, and she did not care for fame; And I often sat a-dreaming, and watched the moonbeams flit With the river flickering through them, and its ripple all aflame. Bit from days of early childhood with the love of rhythmic song, I had yet a curious shame for that which was my secret pride, And would hide my work in midnight, as if doing something wrong, Though I hoped the world would yet admire the thing I strove to hide. How I covered reams of paper! how I treasured every scrap! I might outgrow the fancy, yet was loath to let it go: How I watched the moods of Nature, as I lay upon her lap, And she spoke to me by flowers and birds, and streams that murmured low! The winter and the summer and the morning and the night, All seasons and all creatures brought her messages to me; I loved the very newt that crawled among the lilies bright, And the tiger-branded wasp, and the drowsy yellow bee. And the silence of the mountains spoke unutterable things; And the sounding of the ocean was as silence in my soul; And close to me, and conscious, lying warm as brooding wings, Lay the Mystery of mysteries that quickeneth the whole. I was glancing only lately at those stiff and futile rhymes, Where half-formed thought was struggling for the forms of perfect Art, And thinking how I treasured them, and read them many times; And even then to burn them, somehow went against my heart. Poor stuff they are enow—a drift of dry and shrivelled weed, Marking where once the tide of froth and flying scud had been; Yet will I keep this fragment, for scrawled on it I read, “My husband's nicest verses, though I scarce know what they mean”:— Contrasts Twain are they, sundered each from each, Though oft together they are brought; Discoursing in a common speech, Yet having scarce a common thought; The same sun warmed them all their days, They breathe one air of life serene; Yet, moving on their several ways, They walk with a whole world between. I think they never meet without Some sharp encounter of their wits; And neither hints a faith or doubt, The other does not take to bits; For what the one regards with awe, The other holds a creed outworn; And what this boasts as perfect law, That turns to laughter with his scorn. No envious grudge is in their hearts, Detracting from the honour due To nobler worth, or greater parts, Or larger grasp, or clearer view: Simply there is a gulf between Their ways of life, and modes of thought, And nothing is by either seen But as the other likes it not. With vision keen and thought complete Cool-headed Warham holds his way, And all that lies about his feet He makes it his, and clear as day; All common things of natural birth He sets forth in a novel sense; But never leaves the common earth To seek the dim Omnipotence. He gathers knowledge hour by hour, Forgetting nought that once he knew, And handling it with conscious power As matter certified and true; And all he knows gives added might That still with harder thought combines; We wonder at the shining light, He wonders less the more it shines! He has slight pity for our pain, For weakness, he has none at all; He is not proud, he is not vain; He is not either great or small; But he is strong and hard and clear As is a frosty winter day, And never sheds an idle tear, Nor flings an idle word away. He cannot breathe but in the breath Of certainty and knowledge clear; And where we have to walk by Faith He will not go; or will not fear To search into the mysteries, And bid the haunting shadows go; And yet, with all he knows and sees, True wisdom somehow does not grow. But Cromer is of finer make, And doth with subtler thoughts commune— Thoughts singing oft in dim daybreak, And silent oft in blaze of noon; He sees the process Warham saw, But to the Power he is not blind, Beholds the working of the Law, And bows to that which lies behind. Seeking what knife can ne'er dissect, Nor flame-wrapt blowpipe can set free, Nor chemic test can e'er detect, But only kindred mind can see, He finds in everything a light Which, shunning finest power of sense, Does more to make a man of might Than knowledge of the Why or Whence. And much he knows, and much he thinks, But he is more than all he knows; For still aspiring, still he drinks Fresh inspiration as he goes, More careful that the man should grow Than that the mind should understand: He loves all creatures here below, And touches all with tender hand. He pities all the pained and weak, And feels for their unhappy fate; Simple and true and brave and meek, He does not know that he is great; He looks to heaven with wondering gaze, And earth with awe by him is trod; We marvel at the words he says, He, at the silences of God. Thus on their several ways they go, And neither other comprehends, Yet it was God that made them so, And they do serve His several ends; That seeks for light to walk in it, And this for God to live in Him; One questions with a searching wit, The other trusts where all is dim. Why quarrel with their several parts, Where each is good if one is best? And who shall say that this departs, Restful, unto Eternal rest, While he who loves the light goes down Into the darkness of the night?— Life grows unto its perfect crown, And light unto a larger light. I often spoke to Hilda of the poetry that lay In all the rich and wondrous life that compassed us about, At the firesides of the people, in the wild-flowers by the way, In our trials, and our sorrows, in our Faith too, and our doubt. But she did not care for verses; thought all poets must be poor; And would rather some more money than be sung about in rhyme: Yet she kissed my cheek and forehead, and vowed that she was sure I should write a name immortal 'mong the great ones of the time. Oh, she knew that she was stupid; how I ever came to wed Such a silly girl as she was, she never could make out; But she could not keep the garden, if I would have every bed Free for birds and beasts and creatures to write poetry about. It was nice to hear the throstles answering on the evening breeze, And to watch the short, sharp rushes of the blackbird on the lawn; But there would not be a cherry left upon the loaded trees, And the pease were black with cawing rooks about the early dawn. A shadow fell on me at this; for love, young love, had thrown A glamour all about her, wreathed a glory round her face, Sought in her high inspiration; and one does not like to own That his dream is somewhat faded, and a little commonplace. Vexed, and slightly disappointed!—still our love was fond and true, And trustful and sufficing; so it did not matter much; But I sat the more alone, and hid my labour from her view, For I felt the poet's shrinking from unsympathetic touch. And my speech grew shallow to her, and my feeling oft was spent In small enforcèd humour to laugh poetry away; And crackling jests would flicker round the higher sentiment, Turning pathos into laughter, and earnest into play. Of course, it was not good for me; but I could shelter her, Belying my own nature; and I scrupled not at that, If I might but dream in secret when the owlets were astir, And hooted from the ivy to the moon-bewildered bat. And just on this point only there was silence 'twixt us twain; But silence bringeth sorrow where the trust should be complete; Love likes not shallow mirth, too; and a fear sprang up amain, That in the deeper life of life we yet might fail to meet. Not that spinning rhymes and verses is the deeper life of life, Though it may be a true fashion which that deeper life shall wear; But if heart must mate with heart to make the husband and the wife, Mind should also match with mind to make the perfect wedded pair. Not so with me and Hilda; there was love, and nothing more: But some ballads I had written, brought me praise and also pay; Then she changed her mind about them, as she tinkled o'er and o'er The little store of guineas that had dropt upon her way. Surely welcome were the guineas; but I had not writ for gold, And the gold was all she cared for, and I could have cursed the thing; But she had the care of housekeeping, and troubles manifold, That were bound upon her spirit by the slender marriage-ring. I should have thought of that, for it was burdening her youth— Her youth that never knew a care until she came to me; But I only saw that everything went orderly and smooth, And wist not of the frets and fears of small economy. Then, the handling of those guineas seemed to turn her little head; She was sure that I could write a score of better songs a week, And she need not vex her heart about the milk-books, or the bread, Or the men that came with nasty bills, and looked so sharp and sleek. And she wanted something pretty—a bit of ornament, A dress, or some fresh furnishing to brighten up a room; And we named them quaintly after, each, its poem, as we spent The little roll of gold that made her life to bud and bloom. “Noche Triste,” was a ballad of the fall of Mexico, And also a chintz curtain in our little parlour hung; And a band of scarlet ribbon, knotted up into a bow, Had its name of “English Harold” from a song that I had sung. Trifles! yet they lit our home with lamps of sweet significance, Made every chamber live, and put a soul in chairs and stools, That linked them with our highest, as the moonbeams where they glance Silver with heavenly beauty even the common water-pools. Trifles! little homely trifles; fireside jests that lose their way Out of doors; yet what a pathos in their memory may dwell! For I thought my heart would break when I came but yesterday On that rag of scarlet ribbon fastening up the jargonelle. Twice-paid I deemed my verses when the trifle they had brought Brightened her evening muslin then, and made her face to shine; And now it all came back to point the misery of our lot, As with a twice-told sorrow, in that ribbon's fate and mine. Hilda scarcely read my verses, never sang a song of mine, Though her voice was like a plaintive bird's, and thrilled you through and through; I have wept to hear her evening hymn, or Psalm with crabbèd line, Ring through the open casement as the stars lit up the blue. But she scarcely read my verses; even some that I had writ Of our wooing and our wedding, gave her but a passing thought; I was pleased to see her pleased, but still there was a sting in it, When she prized my labour only for the thing that it had bought. Yet I would not be disheartened; my purpose only rose The higher, and my fancies were but cherished more and more; I would seek out fresher fountains whose living water flows, Unnoticed, in a land where song had rarely been before. I would sing the life I saw—the world that lay about our door; Its passion and its longing, its error and its sin: It was fresh, if rather sunless, and it deepened more and more As I tilled the field whose harvest I was fain to gather in. Thus, long and late I brooded, well resolved to make my mark On the great age we live in, and my silence deeper grew; I went musing in the day-time, and sat mooning in the dark, And the rush of sudden fancies made my slumbers broken too. For the vision grew upon me, the more I did attain, Dwarfing still my poor achievement with some glimpse of nobler fruit; I scarce had caught a measure when some diviner strain, A-singing sweetly in my heart, would sing the other mute. Those were days of rich invention, like fresh goldfields, when they find Nuggets studding the first spadeful, grains that yellow all the sand; One has by and by to crush the quartz—to grind the barren mind, And pick a little precious thought with weary heart and hand. But those were fruitful times, when thought ran faster than the pen, And moulds of quaint invention shaped a hundred dainty strains, As I touched with playful fancy the odd characters of men, With kindly humours in their hearts, or maggots in their brains. If I have won a little niche—I know it is but small In Fame's proud temple, it was then I won it, being true, And sparing not myself, and without effort natural, And singing ever from my heart, and only what I knew. For mine eye was opened wide to all the glory and the beauty, And also to the error, and the failure, and the strife; My heart had tasted sorrow, as it clung to love and duty, And I felt my art was deepened with the deepening of my life. I sought about among the common facts of common day,— What chanced me in a corner, or what met me in a crowd,— For the undertones of pathos murmuring softly by the way, Or quaint, droll humours, mirthful with a laughter never loud. I cared not for the converse of Respectability, Choosing rather the blank Innocent that sauntered down the street, Singing the broken fragment of some weird old melody, As he drifted, to and fro, with vagrant thought and aimless feet. All the smug and well-conditioned, growing rich and growing stout, And the men that fussed and wrangled about the Kirk and State, And genteel, superior people, dressing well and dining out, I found them very dull, though their content was very great. I stored up thoughts and pictures; for I knew that Art is long, That you cannot rear a temple like a hut of sticks and turf; But I did not think what perils on a woman's life may throng, Sitting lonely with her thoughts that chafe and murmur like the surf. Ever more and more absorbed, I hardly noted as they came The changing moods, the chills, the frets that daily did increase; I would dig the deep foundations of a long-abiding Fame, And wist not that they undermined my home of love and peace. Ah me! that hungry passion! and it looked so innocent! A minister of love, belike, to brighten all our day, To gild the petty care of life, and homely incident, As we sat like summer birds, and sang our troubles all away! And yet it was self-seeking, let me paint it as I will, But the poet's eager craving for the vanity of Fame, But the witchery of Art enchanted with its own sweet skill, Seeking less to better life, than just to make itself a name. And perchance she saw its shallowness as I did by and by, And was truer to the fact, in all her seeming commonplace, And the simple, homely method of her quiet life, than I With my thoughts away in dreamland, and its haze about my face. For I have not won the glory which I lost my peace to gain; The critic world has praised me in a kindly sort of way, But I have not struck a chord that thrilled the common heart of men, Nor blazed forth as a star upon the forefront of the day. And yet the passion hankers in me, not to be gainsaid, In spite of all misgiving, and the verdict of the crowd, And I do not care for poverty, neglect, or little bread, If I may but spin my verses, though I only spin my shroud. That was the first night-frost that blanched our young life's tender bloom: Not much; and we had love enough to throw it off, had I But taken thought of the pale face that in the silent room Turned ever to the kirkyard with a tear-dimmed, weary eye: Turned ever to the kirkyard where the little grave was green That buried her young hope, and made her motherhood a wail, Silent and yet unceasing, for the bliss that might have been, But now was lying in a shroud, and nailed with coffin-nail. I did take thought a little then; and brought an old school friend To cheer her in her sorrow—but the girl was hard as steel, Who tried, I fear, to mar the peace I hoped that she would mend, And blended coldest sceptic thought with strangely burning zeal: A girl so unlike Hilda that I wot not how they drew Together for a moment—sharp-witted, and without An atmosphere around her mind; but many things she knew, And had not any light of faith, nor any shade of doubt. Of course we did not know it; but it was unlucky fate That brought into my life then such a thread of unbelief, Confirming troubled fancies that had come to me of late, And brooded o'er my life with dim foreboding of new grief. For pondering, as I could, the things around me, I began To piece them bit by bit into some pattern of clear thought; And lo! they grew too fast to fit into my little plan, And squared not with the hard and narrow faith that I had got. I had worn my baby-creed, just, as a thing of course, till now, Unthinking if it fitted on the grown man as the child; My mother made it for me when the yet unshadowed brow Was crowned with sunny curls, and the young soul was undefiled. But it was a thing apart from me, and compassed round with dread; Unquestioned and unsearched, it lay bathed in an awful light, Sacred as writ which had been sealed by the belovèd dead, And beautiful with memories of piety and right. But now my mind was darkened o'er with dim, disturbing doubt, And many roots of faith appeared to strike no further down Than customary thoughts that I had never reasoned out, Nor felt their pressure on my soul to own them, or disown. Could any juggling art transfer the sin that I had done, Unto another soul, and give his innocence to me? Could any claim of other's right be mine to stand upon, And urge His sinless sorrow as my justifying plea? And could I think the world lay all beneath the wrath of God, Seeing it folded in His light, and kept with tender care? Or that the Father's love could grasp an everlasting rod, Nor falter as it hearkened to the wail of dim despair? Could every heart be wholly wicked, every soul untrue, As if it were a spark from hell that kindled all desire? Could all be set to rights again when God had gleaned a few, While the harvest of the nations was faggoted for fire? At first I feared the venturous thought, and laid it quick aside; But still it would return, although in other form it came.— Is He not ever merciful who loved us all, and died, Gracious to-day and yesterday, and evermore the same? Trembling, I fluttered to and fro, like moth about the flame, Now saying, “It is light, and I must come unto the light”: Then pausing, for the moth unto a swift destruction came, When, curious for the light, it left the dim and dusky night. I think it did not grow to be strong-hearted faith in me; I only dared to doubt, and then made pictures of my doubt; This way the better reason drew that I might clearly see; That way old custom dragged, and bade me cast the reason out. So wave on wave arose, and burst, and eddied back again, But still the tide swelled higher till it covered all the beach; I saw old landmarks vanish, yet that smote me not with pain, Nor leaped my heart with gladness at the truth it hoped to reach. I longed for light; but all the light I found was second-hand; Reflected thought that had been tossed about, for ages past, From surface-minds that vainly claimed alone to understand The mystery of the Light that is like shadow on us cast. They say that doubt is weak; but yet, if life be in the doubt, The living doubt is more than Faith that life did never know; Pulp and jelly of the shell-fish, clasped in bony mail without, Crack the joinings and the sutures that the life within may grow. Could I have just believed with all my heart and soul and mind! But faith was slowly breaking up, and parting like a cloud, And yet the light that through the rifts was glancing from behind, Looked sickly in the wavering mist that wrapped it like a shroud. A zone of large indifference, then, I made, where easy hope Linked faith and unfaith, arm in arm, and sung along the road; All would somehow yet come right—at least, I did not mean to mope, If I could not feel the lightness, yet I would not feel the load. God was larger than the creeds: they were the cunning compromise For unanimous decision of the many and the few; Rafts that leaked at every log, so loose the binding of their ties: But they floated, and the thoughtless held that therefore they were true. This was the one decree, that God should yet be all in all, And in the Christ would reconcile all things in earth and heaven, And a new Paradise arise more glorious from the Fall, And bread of life be sweeter, raised from sin's disturbing leaven. By and by, I hinted lightly at this dawning hope of mine To Hilda, in a quaint conceit of ballad rudely rhymed: It put her friend in raptures, and she vowed it most divine, But it seemed a sorry jest to her, and wicked and ill-timed. Well; it was a foolish trifle, burnt well-nigh as soon as writ, A dream of death, and how all life shall come to fulness then, And how the love that sweetens earth, and mirth that brightens it Could never darken Heaven, for God had given them unto men. Was it strange, when Hilda frowned, that I should turn me to her friend, Who clapped her hands, ecstatic, and would have me read again? Perhaps she overdid it; and it turned out in the end That she was false and faithless—but I did not know her then. Maybe, I should have seen that there was nothing in my rhyme To lift up eyes of worship, softly swimming in a tear, Or to part the eager lips with breath-less rapture, all the time, As the humour of the dreamer dropt upon the listening ear. No doubt, she overdid it, turning up her thin, brown face With the dark eyes and eager; I had called her Caberfae, She looked so like a startled deer that, in a lonely place, Lifts her head among the bracken at the dawning of the day. And somehow, after that, she filled my life up, as the tide Creeps, beneath the waving tangles, up the sloping, shingly shore, And along the quiet sands, and softly lapping at your side, Girds about you ere you wot, and is behind you and before. She would look through books of reference, and mark the places right, And copy papers nicely, and be useful fifty ways; And sometimes on the darkling thought would glance a piercing light, Or with woman's nice suggestion touch a sentiment or phrase. I looked to her for sympathy, I leant on her for aid; Fanatical for Reason, still she loved the poet's Art, Or vowed she loved it dearly; and how cleverly she played, With artillery of praise upon the outworks of the heart! Ere long, I did not care to hear her raptures for they came To be mere ejaculations, monotonous, without Any critical discernment; and I felt a growing shame At the lauds which she kept singing, and the things they were about. And, besides, my floating doubts, which were like mists that slowly trail O'er the mountains, adding mystery and grandeur to their shapes, Were in her a chilling drizzle, or a driving sleet and hail, Hiding sun and moon and stars, and all the shining seas and capes. I could not cast her off, but yet I heeded not how soon She took herself away now, with that bitter sneer of hers; She was as coldly chaste as are “the glimpses of the moon,” But she laughed at all the faiths of men, and all their characters. And I saw that Hilda pined away—she did not fret nor frown, But whatever our discourse, she let a pallid silence linger On her lips from hour to hour, while moving slowly up and down, From knuckle to the point, the marriage-ring upon her finger. For Hilda had a faith serene, clear as the evening star, Keen-piercing through the changeful glow with its unchanging gleam, Wheeling in some calm zone where neither doubts nor tremors are, Nor shadowy, dim misgivings, that perchance we only dream. And now she was amazed because old Faiths broke up in me, With little feeling of a loss, or hope of higher gain, With little sense of sorrow or regret or poverty, But she beheld the change with fear and shivering and pain. BOOK SECOND HILDA, SAINT-WIFE Hilda's Diary March, 18— Winifred Urquhart and I, when we were tall school-girls, Chatting of wooings and weddings while twisting our hair up in curls, Or whispering some hush-secret, which was not secret a bit, Only we were confidential, and made a secret of it— Winnie and I made a paction, silly things that we were! That she would be sure to tell me, and I must be sure to tell her, Whoever, first of us, wedded, all the bitter and sweet Of the life of marriage that makes the life of a woman complete; The hope, the fear, and the bliss too, we were to set down all, And none of our Gardens of Eden be hid by a hedge or a wall. So now she writes me a letter, all underlined, to say She trusts that I do not forget the promise I made that day; Hints that, perhaps, I might keep a Diary locked with a key, And sacred To Early Friendship, which no other eye should see; And hopes that I will not act like commonplace wives, who drop Their friends and their French and pianos, and put to the Past a full stop, So to begin a new paragraph all about beeves and muttons, Darning, and troubles with servants, and gentlemen's shirts and buttons. Why does marriage, she adds, so often a woman degrade? Why is the wife so silly, who was ever so bright as a maid? Why should a husband like to fallow her intellect, And starve it on housekeeping cares that lower her self-respect? But she is sure that mine is all that he ought to be, Worthy of love and devotion, almost worthy of me. Yet oh, the young love of girls! it is purer, truer, and better! And so she concludes with a prayer for a long and an early letter. This has set me a-thinking that, maybe, I ought to write The things that my heart is full of, as the noon of heaven with light, The thoughts that I had not before, which gave me a larger life, And the bliss that never I knew till he called me his own little wife. Not that I mean to keep a silly promise like that— Winnie is clever and scheming; I know what she wants to be at. Give her a word, good or bad, and she'd spin such a web from the hint, And colour a meaningless phrase with so suspicious a tint, That folk would begin to whisper, sure there was something amiss: And then she would write me, bewailing the world and its wickedness. Dearly she loves a mystery, dearly she loves to be thought To know what she ought not to know, and to wit what none else ever wot: For Winnie is clever and scheming, even when she looks like a fool; She was not liked by the girls, and she was not happy at school, But I came to be fond of her, rather, by having to take her part, When others were hard upon her, and said that she had not a heart; Which is not true, I am sure, nor yet the tales that they told Of wicked books she had read before she was twelve years old. I have heard that, since she came home, she cultivates science, and writes, And lectures over the country, most of the winter nights, Having her hair cut short, and her finger-tips black with ink:— But Winnie could never forget what is due to a lady, I think. I am going to write in my book, but not for her eyes to see: Ought I to hide it from him who keeps not a thought from me? Oh, there is something in marriage, like the veil of the temple of old, That screened the Holy of Holies with blue and purple and gold; Something that makes a chamber where none but the one may come, A sacredness too, and a silence, where joy that is deepest is dumb. And it is in that secret chamber where chiefly my days are passed, With a sense of something holy, and a shadow of something vast, Till he comes, who alone is free to come and to go as he will, Till he comes, and the brooding silence begins to pulse and thrill. Oh come, for my heart is weary, waiting, my love, for thee! I will lock my bliss from the world, but my love shall have ever the key. March, 18— When I remember the way we girls were wont to talk Up in our rooms at night, or out on the daily walk, It seems like an unreal echo, ever so far away From the clear realm of nature, and light of the sun and the day. Yet it sounded to us, at the time, like absolute reason and good, As we chattered of woman's rights, and babbled in wrathful mood Of Maries, thoughtful and wise, that often were met at school, Changed into careful Marthas under a husband's rule, Heedless of mental culture, losing their nimble wits, To be housemaids dusting the rooms, or cookmaids turning the spits. Winnie was great on that—I thought she was eloquent even, As the small face kindled up with a light, as it were, from heaven, Vowing the wife became a traitor to woman in this, Betraying a noble cause for a petting word or a kiss; Wronging her husband, too, by giving a lower aim Of self-indulgence to life, which he knew not at home till she came. What greater wrong could she do him than teach him only to care For dainties, and kickshaws, and slippers, and naps in the easy chair?— But Nature is more than Logic, and wedlock is more than we Dreamed of then in our folly; and great is the change now in me: Motherhood, if it should come, will work more wonders still, For love it is all in all, and it does whatsoever it will; Dusting, darning, drudging, nothing is great or small, Nothing is mean or irksome, love will hallow it all; Sacrifice there is none if only I see him glad, And all my pleasure is gone if he be heavy and sad. April, 18— Past is the honeymoon; and I think it was not so good As the home-coming together, in quiet, thoughtful mood. Then our life truly began: it was like a dream before— A dream in a boat, while the pale moon glimmered from sea to shore, And we went swaying about still under the stars, and heard Dreamily plashing billow, and dreamily whispered word. Why should we go a-jaunting when the heart just wants to repose From agitation of bliss, and to know whereto it grows? Nothing felt real to me then, or brought me the feeling of rest, As we sped hither and thither, like birds flying far from the nest, Hid in the bosk of the greenwood, where they are longing to be, And cosy and warm, and sweet with the scent of the sheltering tree. I did not like then to say it, because all his plans had been laid To visit some beautiful spot which poets had famous made, Or to look on some ancient Abbey that sweetly went down to decay, Wrapt in the ivy green, amid trees in the lichen grey, And all with me there beside him, he said, to brighten the view, And bathe it for him in a light which for ever would make it new. Therefore my voice was silent; but oh, how I wearied to see The house-fire which love was to kindle, the home where my life was to be! For all the pert maids at the inns where we hoped for a little to hide, Scanning my bonnets and dresses, would smirk at the new-made bride; Scarcely a railway porter but knew my trunks to be out Fresh on a marriage trip, and led me, blushing, about, While Claud was looking so handsome and self-possessed, like a king, Proud and tender and ready, and seeing to everything. It is not nice to be stared at by everyone that you meet, As they smile and whisper together, and scan you from head to feet. I knew not the rest of love till we sat in our little white room, Close together, and watched the stars coming out of the gloom, In the hush of a raptured moment, his strong arm clasping me round, As on his bosom I leant to feel all the peace I had found; And he said, “We will fold our wings now, for here I have made you a nest, And lined it warm with the down of the love that warms my breast.” Oh, he can say such things! And I cannot say them to him; I am quietest when I am gladdest; but my heart was filled to the brim. Just a moment before, and my trembling would not cease, But now the shiver was stilled in a thrill of bliss and peace. April, 18— Our home is a bright little cottage, half-smothered in yellow rose, Not yet blooming, however; a still river sullenly flows Deep at the foot of a broomy brae, and the leaping trout Ripple its gloom in the evening as gay flies flicker about. Nor is it all so sullen, for down in a farther reach It leaps and sparkles and gleams o'er the stones of a pebbly beach, Under the birch and the hazel, just coming to leaf, and there are Blue-bell patches of sky, made bright with the primrose star. Behind is a group of great fir-trees, five of them, red-armed firs,— Druid sisters he calls them,—that moan when the night-wind stirs; Last of a great pine forest that stubs the heath with its roots For miles, till you come to a tarn where gulls and little round coots Are dipping and diving all day in a quiet solitude; There the bee haunts, and the air is blithe, and the lapwings brood. I hear the curlew scream, and the grouse-cock crowing at dawn, And yet when I stand at the door, where the cowslips laugh on the lawn— It is only a patch of green turf, enough to pasture a lark— I see the sleepy old town, and the spires of the Minster dark, And catch a glimpse of the sea-waves white on the yellow sand, Where the river leaps at the bar, and the coastguard houses stand. We have a bright little garden down on a sunny slope, Bordered with sea-pinks, and sweet with the songs and the blossoms of hope. Oh, it is all too good for me; often I catch myself singing In very lightness of heart, and I seem like the birds to be winging Merry from room to room, as they flutter from bush to tree, And each has her mate a-coming, as mine, too, is coming to me. Am I wrong to be always so happy? This world is full of grief; Yet there is laughter of sunshine, to see the crisp green on the leaf, Daylight is ringing with song-birds, and brooklets are crooning by night; And why should I make a shadow where God makes all so bright? Earth may be wicked and weary, yet cannot I help being glad; There is sunshine without and within me, and how should I mope or be sad? God would not flood me with blessings, meaning me only to pine Amid all the bounties and beauties He pours upon me and mine; Therefore will I be grateful, and therefore will I rejoice; My heart is singing within me; sing on, O heart and voice. May, 18— Winnie has writ me again—she offers a visit in June; Some day she must come, I daresay; but that is an age too soon. What could I do with her? I should be like one reading a book, Lost in the story and passion, while she would be eager to look Over my shoulder to find out what was absorbing me so, And why, when my heart is so happy, the tears are so ready to flow; And now she would hurry, and now would tarry my turning the leaf; And I'd hate her in less than a week; and I know it would end in grief. Alone! I must be alone, to read my romance, for the plot Is only slowly unfolding; and oh, what a hero I've got! Noble and true and brave, all that a hero should be; So much better than I am; and great is his love to me; Yet not greater than mine is, save that his mind is more, For oh I love him, I love, as a God I could almost adore. That makes me tremble at times, for oh if an idol I make, What if my idol were broken? Truly my heart it would break. What, if heaven should be wroth at me shrining and sainting a man Sinful and mortal as I? Yet God too I love, all I can; My heart is truer to Him the more I am loved and caressed; And surely He cannot be jealous of love He has bidden and blessed. June, 18— We have walks as the evenings lengthen; sometimes over the moor, Many-tinted and shadowed; brisk is the air there and pure Among the brown heath and the bracken that now from its snake-like bonds, Under the sun's deft fingers, is slowly uncoiling its fronds; Close-packed now, by and by they, overlapping, will hide The flower of the slender orchis purpling close by their side. Dry on the knolls is the whin-bush, massing its golden bloom; The cotton-grass low in the marshes tosses its small white plume; And from the hollows is wafted the scent of bog-myrtle or birch Fragrant after the rain; but, best of all, is the search Among the roots of the heather for stag-moss' antlers green Branching over the earth, far-spreading, and rarely seen. Here and there is a cottage, too, looking just like the heath, Green on the roof with house-leek, brown with its turf-wall beneath. Children play at the door, they are dirty and happy and fair, Sunbrowned all of their faces, sun-bleached their lint-white hair; The mother is milking the cow, the dog lies coiled in the sun, The fowls for the roost are making and the labourer's day is done. Sometimes we rest on a bank, and hear in the evening calm, Just as the stars come out, the sough of their grateful psalm. Often we go to the sea-marge, where the long sands give place To a belt of dark red storm-beaten crags, which grimly face The baffled billows that lie ever panting below at their feet, Or gurgling in black-throated caves where still they mine and beat. Perched on the cliff is a village and far in the cove below The boats are beached on the shingle, waiting the tide to flow; Hard-visaged, bunchy women are baiting the lines in hope, Or carrying laden creels, slow, up the long, shelving slope, Or spreading their fish on the rocks, or welcoming men from the sea, As the lugger trips daintily in, and the flapping sail is free. One thing strikes me about my husband's way with the folk, Whether the moorland shepherds, or fishermen perched on the rock. Freely we enter their homes, for he seems to be known to them all, And knows who is there in the corner, and who in the bed in the wall, And the idiot dreamily singing by the grandam racked with pain, And the lad that went off to the sea, and has never come back again— All the home life of the people, their good and their evil hap. So every door flies open just after a warning tap, And everywhere he is met with a welcome glad and free; The dogs come fawning upon him, the children get up on his knee, Great, rough hands are held out to give him a hearty grip, And the mother's face is shining as he kisses the baby's lip. Of course they are happy to see me, too, for my husband's sake, Only they daintily touch me, as fearful perchance I may break, And, making ungainly curtseys, they have not a word to say; But oh, I am proud to see him so loved in this lovingest way. Sometimes I think, for myself, I would like to tidy the room, To open the window a bit, and get rid of the smoke and the gloom, To teach the children a lesson, or read a page from the Book To the sick man tossed on his pillow, or the old man propped in his nook. But he does not try, in the least, to do any good, and yet Somehow they seemed to like him all the better for it. He is just like one of themselves, and talks of the weather and crops, The ewes and gimmers and lambs, or the luggers and nets and ropes, The take of fish, or the beds of mussels they have for bait, Or the old man's aching bones, or the teething baby's state, Laughing and joking with all, or telling a story, perhaps, To the children gaping around him, while grandfather nods and naps; Yet somehow, all the time, he seems as if reading a book Full of nature and humour, and leaves with a thoughtful look. Once I hinted that I would gladly be doing some good Among these neighbours of ours: and he said in his gentlest mood, “Yet, I suppose it is right to do all the good that you can; Only don't break up the peace of their homes, with a cut-and-dry plan Of tracts and visits and lessons, and scolding the women for dirt, And tramping on everyone's toes, and sitting on everyone's skirt. For when you know them as I do, and all their sorrows and cares, The brave hearts they keep through it all, their patience, their faith, and the prayers, Self-forgetting, that thrill here loud on the stormy shore For those on the stormy sea, they never may look on more, Then you may feel like me, half-ashamed of the good you can do, Compared with the good you are getting from lives so human and true. But try it—you're better than I—only mind they have hearts like your own; And hearts philanthropic, at times, have the trick of the old heart of stone.” November, 18— What is it ails me now? I hardly have written a line For days and weeks and months in this private record of mine. I seemed to have nothing to say, and I did not seem to care, And the days have gone wearily by, though there was not a cloud in the air. I think that my love is more, yet life is little and low, And surely a fulness of life from a fulness of love should grow, For love is summer, when all should be a-blooming and singing; Yet none of the old things now the old sweet bliss are bringing. I go a-dreaming and weary, every day and all; Something is aching within me, I fret at the simplest call Of commonplace duty that once I went about, cheerful and gay, Tripping and singing, light-hearted, all through the hours of the day. Everything burdens me now; and I could cry at a kiss From the dear lips that I love so: What is the meaning of this? I am not unhappy; at least, I have nothing to make me: and yet My gladness is broken and dashed, and comes by the mood and the fit: I weep when I'm left alone; and when he comes home, there are tears That mix with the smile of my greeting, and fill him with fond, loving fears. I want to be cheerful and happy, I want to be busy and good, Yet I louge through the day, doing nothing, and plain like the dove in the wood. What can it be? And my ring, too, will slip to my finger-tip, And it gives me a catch in the throat, and a pain, and a quivering lip: I know it is silly, and yet I cannot get rid of the fear That his love may grow loose as my ring, and be lost while I think it is here. November, 18— I wonder if every student sits brooding far into the night, And hides from the wife of his bosom the thing he is fain to write. Can it be right to conceal the work he is labouring at? I want to sit up beside him, but he will not listen to that; Yet rest I cannot; I lie there, sleepless, and feigning to sleep, When, in the hush of the darkness, soft to my side he will creep, Fearing to rouse me lying, broad awake, all through the hours, Watching the moonbeams flitting, or hearing the patter of showers, The grey owl screech to the bat, or the moan of the throbbing sea, Or puzzling over the house-books, which will not come right with me.— We are not rich, and, maybe, I do not keep house as I might, Though I want to be thrifty, and debt is a thing that I hate outright; Still there is waste, no doubt, and he has a right to complain, And maids are so careless, and break things that cannot be mended again; And will have their young men coming: and how can I say them nay, When I recall how I longed to see him at evening grey? I scrimp and save, and, at times, I am almost weary of life; It would have been better for him had he married a managing wife. Yet all my cares were as nothing it only my husband were right, If he were not so silent by day, if he were not so dreamy at night, Cared for things in the house as he cared for them once on a time, Sat by my side in the evenings, and made my life sweet and sublime, Did he not joke at my questions—a wife is not meant for sport, Always put off with a jest; and jesting is not his forte. Yet oh he loves me, he loves; and I hate myself when I complain, Only the hunger of love ever breeds dream-visions of pain. What is he always writing? Sometimes I tremble to think, What, if it be of Religion? what, if he be on the brink Of falling away from the Faith, and the way which his fathers trod, And, as the minister told us, out of the hand of God? Rarely he goes to Church, though he tells me I ought to go, When the kirk-bells on the Sabbath are chiming soft and low; “You have your window,” he says, “for outlook on all the vast, Dim, everlasting hills, and the shadows on earth they cast,— The old church-window that shines with white-winged angel forms, And martyred saints they are bearing from earth's most bitter storms; And life would be dark to you, dear, lacking the light that it brings, Even though the cobwebs dim the aureoles now, and the wings. I have my outlook too, but not so pretty as yours With dreams of the saintly souls, and the love that all endures; Colder my light and harder, but clearer, at least, to me, For cobwebbed angels somehow help not my vision to see. But to the same Eternal, we look for the breaking day Of an age that is surely coming, when shadows shall flee away.” I am troubled at sayings like these, though I hardly know what they mean, And I pray that he yet may see the truth which my heart has seen. For oh he loves me, loves me, ever so tender and true!— And yet if he loves not God, too, what shall my poor heart do? December, 18— Last night we went to Thorshaven; and the things that I heard and saw Of the “work” now going on there have filled me with wonder and awe. I had been told of their meetings, and how they rarely would cease Till many were conscience-stricken, and many were filled with peace; How the whole village was changed—its drunkards sober and calm, Lips that were wont to blaspheme now thrilling the air with a psalm; Boats were launched with a prayer, and the oars were timed to a hymn; And when the lines were set, or the ropes and the sails were trim, Someone took up the tale of the fishers on Galilee, And told how the Lord drew nigh to them walking over the sea. These were the marvels I heard, and oh my heart longed to be there Where the good Spirit was working, and grace was like dew in the air Dropping on thirsty grass, and making it live anew. Maybe my husband, beholding, would see that the Gospel was true; Maybe his soul would be touched; and maybe my own dull faith Would be refreshed and revived, for it seemed at the point of death. The night was starry and cold, but just a night for a walk, Brisk, in the tingling air; and at first I was fain to talk, His coming had made me so glad then, only my thoughts would not rest, Flitting about like the swallows that twitter around their nest, And then skim away to the river, and dip where the shadows lie Clear in the glassy calm, which they flick with their wings as they fly; So would I chatter a little; and by and by thought was away To the village perched on the cliff, and the people there gathered to pray, So that in silence at length, arm in arm, swiftly we sped On by the beetling crags, till we came to a low rude shed, Roofed with the upturned hull of a wreck that had drifted ashore, Battered by surf on the shingle there for a month and more; Gallantly once she had ridden the waves, and the tempest braved, And true hearts then had been lost in her; now in her wreck they were saved. Crowds were thronging about it; there was a crowd inside Singing a hymn that blended well with the wash of the tide— A wail of sorrow for sin, that swelled to a yearning hope; Then I heard some one praying, but caught not the words nor the scope, For many were sobbing aloud; we squeezed a little way in, Under a guttering candle stuck in a sconce of tin, The flame blown about by the wind, and shedding uncertain light Down on rough weather-beat faces. Clear and cold was the night; Outside, the passionless moon and the quiet stars; but here, Oh what a tempest of trouble and sorrow, and anguish and fear! Oh what a peace, at last, that folded its wings on a calm Throng of spirits entranced, and singing a grateful psalm! He was a keen-eyed, wiry, beetle-browed man who spoke, The pale-faced smith of our village; who pleaded loud with the folk, His voice half saying, half singing the faithful message he bore, Weirdly and hoarse, like the waves that were crashing down on the shore. It was not aught that he said—he was just a plain, blunt man, Earnest, I thought, and acquainted with God and the wonderful Plan Of saving by surety of Him who hung for our sins on the cross, And tasted death for our guilt, that we might have gain in His loss— A plain, blunt man, not a scholar; sometimes his sayings were odd, Nor could I help a smile though he spake of the great thoughts of God; But of the fisher-folk no one smiled, let him say what he would; It was not a season for laughter, nor were they at all in the mood. “The strength of sin is the law,” he said; “it is like the tree Serpents take for a purchase in lands where the serpents be; Clean and straight is its trunk, as the law too is right in its scope, Slippery the coils and the folds round its bark that are twined like a rope, Crushing each bone of its victim, and grinding the life out, within; So is the purchase of Law, for breaking the soul by its sin: Oh how feeble and helpless we are in its terrible grip! For the Law cannot be broken, and these knots never will slip! Coming along the street, I saw the old serpent to-night, Plainly as eyes could behold him—and oh 'twas a sorrowful sight!— Coiling round old men and children, as in a statue I know, Carved with his cunningest art by a wise Greek ages ago, But there to save His children the Father was wrestling grim, Here, as the serpent gripped them, they were all worshipping Him. Yes, I have seen the old serpent, the devil, the father of lies; And he had not a hoof or a horn, or a tail to whisk at the flies; Old men were buying his curses, children were taking his fire Home to their mothers in bottles, as briskly as hell could desire. Busy he is at Thorshaven, sails in your luggers with you, Never a boat goes to sea but the devil is one of the crew; You carry him too in your creels, and he is defiling your way, With swearing and lying and cheating, and breaking the Sabbath day, And sins that I will not speak of, sins that all of you know.— But oh the blood of the Lamb, it will wash you whiter than snow.” Always he came back to that, the blood that was shed for sin, Cleansing our way on the earth, and purging the soul within; He showed to me all my guilt, he showed me the love of God Until I wept at the plague of my heart, and the way I had trod, And the pity that sought me out, and the grace that died for me; And all were sobbing and swaying about like the waves of the sea. Then one dropped on the floor, and writhed in a foaming fit; “Glory to God,” cried the preacher, “He'll snaffle the fiend with his bit; Let her alone; while the devil is wrestling with her we will pray; Peace will come like the stars, and light as the dawn of the day.” Then another was smitten, and lay there with never a breath In her thin nostril, it seemed, and pallid and cold as death; I thought she was gone, till at length a smile of serenest grace Broke on her lips, and beamed all over her lovely face. She was the first to find Peace, and she said, “I have seen my love; He's not in the depths of the ocean, but high in the heavens above; His head is not twined round with tangles, but wreathed with a wreath of palm, And lo! in his hand is a harp, and loud in his mouth is a psalm.” (Her lover was drowned last spring, and his body had never been found, Till she saw him by faith, in her trance, robed in white raiment, and crowned.) Thus it went on for hours, at first with the women, but then, Ere long, the power and the wonder smote the strong hearts of the men; Awed and amazed I stood, unable to stir from the place, Sometimes thinking my heart might be touched by its marvellous grace, Sometimes feeling my flesh creep at an unearthly voice, Sometimes thrilling to hear their songs who for joy did rejoice. At length there fell a great calm, and the lights were glimmering dim, And the moon was low in the heaven, when we sang the parting hymn. On the way homeward I said, “Surely the Lord was there”; And he, “No doubt, and up in yon star too, and everywhere; Hard to say where He is not. Wonderful? Yes, I admit; Hard to say what is not wonderful, when you look closely at it; Why, I have wondered for hours at a flower, or a lichened stone, Or star-moss red on the heath, or a star-fish dry as a bone On the grey shore, till the tide-wave brought back the pulses of life. But does not yon queer evangelist tell a good story, dear wife? Done them some good, you think? Ah! well, we will hope so at least; God is a chemist who works with stuff that would sicken a priest. I think it did good to that girl whose lover was drowned at sea, Gave her some comfort she needed; but it would not do good to me!” Thus I come home heavy-hearted; he always is ready to mock, Turning from anything serious, still with a good-humoured joke. December, 18— Now I know why he sits so late and alone in his room, And why there comes over his face that shadow I took for gloom, Which falls like a sudden haze all over the summer sky, And makes him look stony and cold, with a dream-like fixèd eye, Seeing not what we see, for the outer vision is dim, As he looks on a world unseen, and hears it singing to him. Often it filled me with fear, for I thought he was wroth with me; But he is not angry at all—only trying, he says, to see Thoughts that are hard to get at, and hardly worth getting when done; But the fool's habit of dreaming he learnt when living alone; I must not fancy he sulks; he was only a bit of a poet, Dram-drinking verses in secret, and hoping that no one would know it. So then he brought me some poems, writ for our marriage-day, “Orange-blossoms” he calls them, “A wreath for a wedding gay.” I do not know that I care for poems—though hymns are sweet— I do not want to be talked of, or sung some day in the street, And at the time I was plagued with these horrible tradesmen's books, And maybe my words were dry, and listless also my looks. They are nice enough verses, I fancy —but oh those dreadful bills! And he just laughs at my trouble, and calls it the care that kills— A faithless terror of bakers and butchers and Philistines, Unworthy a true believer in orthodox, sound divines. Well, they are pretty verses, and so I will write them here— But how can he pen such trifles with that shadow of debt so near? ORANGE BLOSSOMS BUDDING It was the gloaming of the day, And first pale glimmer of the moon, The fishing-boats were in the bay, And to and fro they seemed to sway, Rhythmic, to a mystic tune, In the pale glimmer of the moon. We sat us on a thymy bank, Where sea-pink and the wild-rose grew, And blue campanulas were rank, And wild geranium blossoms drank Red sunsets that enriched their hue, And pansies twinkled, gold and blue. And fronting us the broad sea-sand Spread, ribbed and freckled, to the spray Crisp-curving to the curving land, And plashing on the pebbly strand; Beyond, the vague, vast waters lay Lazily heaving in the bay. Three children played along the beach With laughter, as the small waves broke; I heard their laughter and their speech Rippling along the sandy beach, Though fear and trouble in me woke Like the waves surging as they broke. I told my love, and for a space She gazed out far away from me. O throbbing heart, how still the place! Was that a smile that lit her face? Or but the moon drawn from the sea To kiss the lips that can bless me? I told the love you knew before; You said, I did not need to tell, And that you would not answer more, For that I also knew before The secret of your heart so well It did not need that you should tell. BLOOMING O bleak November morning chill, When trees are bare, and haws are ripe! Hopping upon my window sill I heard the cheery redbreast pipe; And through the crackling twigs there ran A twitter of birds since day began. With great frost-ferns the panes were white, The fields were white with dust-like snow, The trees, all crystalled overnight, In white robes made a ghostly show, And where the fountain used to drip The ice had clutched it in its grip. Chanticleer at barn-door crew, Geese were gobbling 'mong the stubble, My dog in circles round me flew, Barking loud at its shadow-double, And ploughed the crisp frost with his nose Right where the cluttering partridge rose. Crowding close, the dainty sheep Nibbled by the bridled brook, The hare pricked up her ears to leap Behind the ricks to a quiet nook, Knee-deep in straw the black ox lowed, His every breath like a steaming cloud. Jenny, looking tossed and tumbled, Stept out with her milking-pails; Yawning Robin crept and grumbled, Blowing on his finger-nails, Tingling fingers, purple-tipped, Sharply by the frost-wind nipped. But I laughed at ice and snow, Shouting to the shrill north wind; She is mine, I said, and no Winter in the world I find; Love, my life is filled with thee, And all is summer now with me. BURSTING O pathway through the meadow green, And thou, grey stile, beneath the thorn, And murmurous river softly borne In dimpling ripplets hardly seen, Sweet path by happy footsteps worn, If all our visions linger there, The poet now shall find thine air, More fancy-full than early morn. We wandered in a dreamland fair, Beside the huge, coiled willow trees, Discoursing of a life to please The Man who took our grief and care. Not ours the dull, ignoble ease Of cushioned seats, or routs and balls, Brain-dulling dinners, civil calls, And poor respectabilities; Not ours to care for marble halls; A modest home, and frugal fare, With love for cobwebbed wines and rare, And peace for pictures on the walls— For more than these we would not care: But generous culture should be ours, And pious use of all our powers, And knowledge, as the primal pair Knew all the beasts and birds and flowers; And with our best we'd serve the Best, And in His goodness find our rest, Untroubled through the years and hours. April, 18— These were the first of the poems he read to me up in my room; By and by others came, soon, like the coming of spring with its bloom; And we are rich now and happy, and everything goes quite smooth; All the newspapers praise him, but do not say half of the truth: I keep them all in a book, and read them often alone; They make me angry at times, when they speak in a critical tone, But I am happy and proud, for now I am nobody's debtor, Paying odd things with a verse which he writes me as fast as a letter. He laughs at me, vowing that poets should never pay bills, but draw At large on the shopkeeping world, exempt from all action at law; Honouring bakers and butchers enough by eating their things; For angels pay not a jot for repairing the plumes of their wings, And bees are not charged by the flowers they visit for tapping the honey— I am not quite sure what he means, but I know he is loose about money. May, 18— Sick! I am sure death is coming: I never have felt like this; Such giddy sinkings and swimmings, and fainting away into bliss! Life in the swooning of life, as if the soul fluttered within, Panting, exhausted, in hope to escape from the body of sin! Heart, O my heart so unquiet, why wilt thou not be at rest? Clinging to this life of trouble, shrinking from life of the blest! Better to be with Jesus! yet husband and home too are dear; And oh if my love be a sin, I cannot help sinning, I fear. All other idols are broken, this one I never can break. Could I be shout out of heaven because of the heaven that I make Out of my true love to him, and out of his great love to me, Arching as deep blue sky still over a deep blue sea? If this be death, as I take it, one thing fain would I do, Ere I go hence to the world where all things are made new: Again with my husband I'd walk, on the quiet Sabbath day, When bells from the old kirk chiming call Christian souls to pray, Down by the green footpath, and the sweet-briar hedge that leads Straight to the house of the Lord through the clover-scented meads; Under the high-arched roof there meekly to sit by his side, In love to remember the Love that bled for us once and died. Oh it were good to think, if I should be taken from him, That once we sat there together, where falls the light chastened and dim Through the tall thin-shafted windows, on hallowed bread and wine, And vows that we vowed together, of life for the love divine. I cannot die till we do it: God would not call me hence, A broken life and unfinished, with a fruitless influence. June, 18— Ah me! we plot and plan, but the great God orders all; And that is not good to Him, which good we are fain to call. Oh how I longed and hoped for the high communion day! Oh how my heart leaped up when he did not say me nay! Oh how I prayed, and was glad and tremulous through the Fast! Oh how happy I was, with my hand on his arm, at last, As gravely we paced together, down by the broomy brae, Along by the sweet-briar hedge, and the clover-scented way, All the maids robed in white, and the men in their sober black, Sweet birds a-singing, and sweet bells ringing; and Paradise back! Better I never had spoken; better he had not gone! Better a yearning sorrow than a heart that is turned to stone! What had come over our pastor, he so gentle and mild, Leading his flock to still waters as father leadeth his child, That day of all days, to preach terrors of wrath and hell, Darkening God's house with the smoke of those in the pit that dwell? Oh it was dreadful to listen! The very Psalms that he chose Rung in the ear like curses hurled at the heads of foes; The prayers were dry and dewless, and hard; and my heart grew sick, To glance at my husband's face with its curious laughing trick: I knew, in that furtive glance, that my hope was worse than lost, And that, in my effort to save, I had perilled and harmed him most. Pained there we sat in our pews, the victims of one man's mood, And vainly tried to be patient; and vainly tried to be good; E'en the sweet symbols of sorrow and love of the Crucified Failed to lighten the gloom, for he took not his place by my side. Never I sat at the Table so barren of grace as then, Joyless and undevout, and wroth at the thoughts of men. I had brought to the living water a thirsting soul with care, And there was no living water, but a broken cistern there. When we came home he sat alone in his room for a while; But all that night he was gentle; and said, at last, with a smile, “You want to know what I think of our minister's work to-day; But shrink to ask me outright, for the wild words you fear I may say. Why should you dread me, Hilda? You wished to do me some good; So did the parson, no doubt, if he only had understood The right way of going about it. He made a mistake; that is all; Hell is the weak point, you see, and a cleverer general Were fain to conceal the spot where the foe might thrust him sore; But he is honest, and plays his tune by the regular score. You are vexed that I happened to hear only that loud devil's chorus— Very well done by the way—which brought all the horror before us, When you had hoped to have only the lyric of love and endurance, Swelling out high, at the close, to the joy and the hope and assurance. But it is all of a piece, love, whether you like it or no, All of it close-knit together; branched, but the branches grow Out of the same deep root. I heard but the part of a whole; I know that the chorus needed the lyric to melt the soul, The lyric implies, too, the chorus; whichever you chance to hear, Always the other is present to fill the heart or the ear. I am not an unbeliever, love; only I cannot wink At things I had rather not see, and thoughts I had rather not think; Does it not seem, too, an odd way of quickening love and faith, Picturing wrath that refuses e'en the grim mercy of death? The higher my vision of God, the more I can trust and pray; The better I seem to know Him, the broader appears the way; God and charity grow together; and I cannot see Any dark moment of Time when Hope must cease to be. But will you hear what I thought as that sermon thundered on, With lurid flashes of horror, and God's heart turned to stone? So then he read to me this—“Other-world ballad” he calls it— Of the meek soul that for love heeds not what sorrow befalls it, Heeds not the bliss and the glory, but longs for them that are lying Dim in the outer darkness, tossed in the anguish undying. What can I think of it? what? who will guide me aright— Me, a weak woman—to walk in the straight pathway of Light? Sometimes it rings in my ear as deadly as error could be; Sometimes I feel in my heart it is true as the gospel to me, A thing I would do, myself, just then when my faith is most, As I remember the love that suffered to save the lost. But through the years and the ages, the Church, unchanging, cries, Sad are the foolish virgins, and glad for ever the wise. Dare I trust my heart's voice against the voice of the whole? Yet should the roar of the crowd ever drown the true voice of the soul? Oh, if clear it were only! THE SELF-EXILED There came a soul to the gate of Heaven Gliding slow— A soul that was ransomed and forgiven, And white as snow: And the angels all were silent. A mystic light beamed from the face Of the radiant maid: But also there lay on its tender grace A mystic shade: And the angels all were silent. As sunlit clouds by a zephyr borne Seem not to stir, So to the golden gates of morn They carried her: And the angels all were silent. “Now I'll open the gate, and let her in, And fling it wide, For she hath been cleansed from stain of sin,” St. Peter cried: And the angels all were silent “Though I am cleansed from stain of sin,” She answered low, “I came not hither to enter in, Nor may I go”: And the angels all were silent. “I come,” she said, “to the pearly door, To see the Throne Where sits the Lamb on the Sapphire Floor, With God alone”: And the angels all were silent. “I come to hear the new song they sing To Him that died, And note where the healing waters spring From His piercèd side”: And the angels all were silent. “But I may not enter there,” she said, “For I must go Across the gulf where the guilty dead Lie in their woe”: And the angels all were silent. “If I enter heaven I may not pass To where they be, Though the wail of their bitter pain, alas! Tormenteth me”: And the angels all were silent. “If I enter heaven I may not speak My soul's desire For them that are lying distraught and weak In flaming fire”: And the angels all were silent. “I had a brother, and also another Whom I loved well; What if, in anguish, they curse each other In depths of hell?” And the angels all were silent. “How could I touch the golden harps, When all my praise Would be so wrought with grief-full warps Of their sad days?” And the angels all were silent. “How love the loved who are sorrowing, And yet be glad? How sing the songs ye are fain to sing, While I am sad?” And the angels all were silent. “Oh clear as glass is the golden street Of the city fair, And the tree of life it maketh sweet The lightsome air”: And the angels all were silent. “And the white-robed saints with their crowns and palms Are good to see, And oh so grand are the sounding psalms! But not for me”: And the angels all were silent. “I come where there is no night,” she said, “To go away, And help, if I yet may help, the dead That have no day.” And the angels all were silent. St. Peter he turned the keys about, And answered grim: “Can you love the Lord, and abide without, Afar from Him?” And the angels all were silent. “Can you love the Lord who died for you, And leave the place Where His glory is all disclosed to view, And tender grace?” And the angels all were silent. “They go not out who come in here; It were not meet: Nothing they lack, for He is here, And bliss complete.” And the angels all were silent. “Should I be nearer Christ,” she said, “By pitying less The sinful living, or woeful dead In their helplessness?” And the angels all were silent. “Should I be like Christ were I To love no more The loved, who in their anguish lie Outside the door?” And the angels all were silent. “Did He not hang on the cursèd tree, And bear its shame, And clasp to His heart, for love of me, My guilt and blame?” And the angels all were silent. “Should I be liker, nearer Him, Forgetting this, Singing all day with the Seraphim, In selfish bliss?” And the angels all were silent. The Lord Himself stood by the gate, And heard her speak Those tender words compassionate, Gentle and meek: And the angels all were silent. Now, pity is the touch of God In human hearts, And from that way He ever trod He ne'er departs: And the angels all were silent. And he said, “Now will I go with you, Dear child of love, I am weary of all this glory, too, In heaven above”: And the angels all were silent. “We will go seek and save the lost, If they will hear, They who are worst but need me most, And all are dear”: And the angels all were silent. July, 18— O my baby, my baby! O sweet sunbeam of bliss! Brightening my earth for a moment as with a heaven-sealing kiss: Oh the sweet smile on his lips! it haunts me by night and day! All his brief life was a smile that slowly faded away, As if he just looked in on us here, on his heavenward road, And saw that we were not meet to rear up the child of God. Sometimes I try to think, oh, what a joy to have given Child of mine to the host that serve and praise in heaven! He did not need to be christened, his robes were clean and white, Touching the earth but a moment, he passed to the realm of light. Sometimes I shudder to think of the earth and the little grave Under the great church tower where the budding poplars wave. O my baby, my baby! whether in heaven or there, Why am I here, and my baby left with no mother's care? I thought I was dying at one time—would I were dying to-day; O my baby, how could the Father take thee away? August, 18— Winnie has come: my husband thought it might cheer me a bit, Having an old friend near me, clever and sparkling with wit, Sharing old memories with me, full of the gossip of town— The last new book or picture, or fashion of bonnet or gown. And she was nice, at first, with her chatter about the old times, When we were schoolmates, and sauntered under the oaks and limes, And heard the hum of the bees, and the hum of our future in them, Or watched the swift, brown squirrels climbing the grey beech-stem; Bright little pictures she cut me out of the old school-world— All about how we were dressed, and drilled, and scolded, and curled, And lectured; and then she knows where all the girls have gone— This with her husband to India, that to New Zealand alone, Trusting to pick up a husband somewhere away in the bush, Or, maybe, to set up a school, or to open a shop at a push. May Grant, the wildest of us, has married a Low Church vicar, Who holds by the orthodox faith, and port as the orthodox liquor; While Helen, her sister, is all for chasubles, roods, and stoles, Liftings and bowings, and Catholic manner of saving souls; Elphie Deering has sold herself to a widower, And drives in her carriage past his son who once courted her; Others are strumming pianos, or working in Berlin wools Pictures of foolish youths for catching the youthful fools; Lizzie Morrit is dead—she was jilted by a dragoon, When all her fortune appeared to be railway shares in the moon. Winnie is clever, but sharp and sarcastic; and lays herself out To please the men by her wit, which she scatters like sparks about; No matter who may smart, if only herself may shine With her spirits unflagging, that sparkle and gleam like wine. I do not quite like her way with my husband; but all the same I laugh, and she does me good, and I really am glad that she came. September, 18— Surely Winnie is changed; we ne'er had been friends together, Had she always been ready to sting like a wasp in October weather. I think there is hardly a name she has not some story about— Of all that we knew long ago—a story suggesting a doubt. Each face that I used to remember as beaming with kindly light, Is smirched with something or other, and no one escapes her spite. Sneering with scornful laughter, turn wherever she may, All the glory is dimmed of all that come in her way; She creeps on the noblest natures stealthily as a cat, Now with a bite of venom, and now with a wanton pat, Leaving them not till crushed. And one thing I cannot abide, The way that she flatters my husband even when I am beside, Now flopping down on her knees, and staring up in his face, Clasping her hands, and feigning an ecstasy quite out of place; Pumping up tears at his pathos, or sighing with heaving breast, Or giggling and clapping her hands when his humour is wickedest. He is weak enough to believe her, which makes me colder in praise, And I care for poetry less than I ever did all my days. She flatters him daily with words that are silky and soft and sleek, And no true wife can be pleased when seeing her husband weak. 'Tis growing quite dreadful to hear her now and then, when she speaks Jauntily of a Faith that needs no God, nor seeks To trace His work on the earth, or follow His way on high, Noting His glorious footprints clear in the starry sky; For Nature has in herself the reason for all that is, And God is an unscientific, needless hypothesis, Like witches, ghosts, and miracles—dreams of the slumbrous night Which the great dawn of reason has driven away with its light! Thereto my husband made answer—and oh I was proud and glad; “Look you, Miss Winnie,” he said, “it's your method of science that's bad; Good for its own end, of course; but here it is clearly at fault; God is not found by the tests that detect you an acid or salt. While you search only for secrets that process of science sets free, Nothing you'll find in the world, but matter to handle or see. Here is a book I am reading now; what can your method find there? Boil it, or burn it, dissect it, let microscope scan it with care; What does it show you but paper and ink and leather and thread, All made of chemical simples that, no doubt, you have in your head? But where is the thought, which is all the end and use of the book, And which flows on through its pages clear to my mind as a brook, Rippling and singing sweet music to him that hath ears to hear? Have you an acid will test it? a glass that will make it all clear? Or scalpel to cut it? And yet paper and leather and ink All are but trash, if I find not the thought which the writer can think. What, now, if Spirit and God are the thought which is written out plain On the great page of the world, and your method of seeking is vain?” October, 18— I'll not bear this any longer. I know that his heart is mine; But in my house no girl shall make my life sicken and pine. When dead—which may soon be— they may do what they list; I shall be With my sweet baby, who now smiles out of the darkness on me; My baby, whose soft little hands pull steadily at my heart, To think of the better land, and cleave to the better part. But this is my home while I live, and none shall bring trouble to it; And he is my own while I live, and she, with her saucy wit, Shall not come between him and me. He cares not for her in the least; If she respected herself she might see that the west and the east Are not more sundered than he from a woman who stings and pricks; He laughs at her sallies of wit, but he sees through all of her tricks. I know what is due to a wife; she thinks me a poor, silly fool, But I can be dignified too, and I don't mean to sit down and pule. Only last evening my ring slipped from my finger, and ran Under her chair—my finger is thin and wasted and wan— And picking it up, she put it, before my eyes, on her own, Bidding him look how it fitted her, tight to the joint and the bone, Just as if meant for her hand. And this was my marriage ring! How can she sit by my fire, and smile in my face and sting? Oh it is dreadful, a woman who has innuendoes and arts, And looks so simple and sweet, while she is breaking hearts. Yet I heed not her sneering; but oh to be once more alone, To lay my head on his shoulder, and thrill at the old true tone Of love that cherished me once, ever petting his fond little wife, And, making a nest for me, rounded off all the angles of life. Not that I care for petting—I'm not of the March-blossom kind, Best in its velvet-sheath wrapt up from the blustering wind; Rough weather I could bear, if only his heart were true Unto the love he once bore me, and unto the God he once knew. That is what troubles me most. The time was I prayed him to read Daily the Book where my soul found help in my sorest need, Light when my day was dark, and strength to my fainting will, Comfort in time of trouble, and healing from every ill. Now there is nothing dread so much as a text from him, It is as if all the old stars of heaven were changed and dim, Were not in their old places, and had not the same clear sense, Nor dropt on my spirit the dews which gave it a gladness intense. Changed is the meaning of all, though he keeps to the words and names; They are new pictures that look now out of the antique frames; They are new words that he sings now to the old tunes I know; And strange is the taste of the streams now that in the old channels flow. “Lo! as the rod of Aaron,” he says, “to minds perplexed The critical art brings water e'en out of the flintiest text, Clears a way through the desert, and gives to us angels' bread, And quickens anew to life the faith that was well-nigh dead.” But when I'm fain to learn the faith he is fain to boast, Oh but it seems like another God speaking to men not lost; No more the gate is strait, nor heaven is hard to win, No more the world is fallen, nor death the wages of sin— No more is there a curse now crucified on the tree— No more any Redeemer, nor ransom paid for me. Nothing is as it used to be; nothing is what it seems; Nothing says what it used to say; and the old Faiths are all dreams; Blindly the saints read the Scriptures, and like dotards obeyed them— They've taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him Now when I say this to him, he laughs in his good-humoured way, Putting me off with a jest, as one with a child might play, Which is not fair to his wife, however silly I be, And I am no fool, although I be not so clever as he. But Winnie, seeing me vexed thus, silently smiles where she sits, Turning her eyebrows up, and sharpening her scornful wits, Adding perhaps, by and by, “Ye buried your Lord in a creed, Dark as the Golgotha tomb, and there He lay dead, indeed; Should you complain that He is not there for you still to embalm With unguents and spices, the while ye praise your dead Christ in a psalm? If there's a chance for your gospel to live, which I very much doubt, It is in this new resurrection the critics would fain bring about, Laying aside the grave-clothes,—dogma, miracle, myth, All the dust that the ages have covered His glory with,— That we may look on the simple man as He lived and died, Loved and loving and worshipped, and hated and crucified.” So does she cap his wild words with others more wild, and a sneer Hardens her voice as she speaks, and grates on my heart while I hear. November, 18— Winnie has left us at length. I had some trouble about it; He laughed at her flattery, vowing he hardly could live now without it, Called her a nice little goose, his Caberfae, with the head, Brown, of a startled deer just raised from its ferny bed; And not a thing would he do, and never a word would he say; It was no business of his; the girl might go or stay; He would have nothing to do with it; women had ways of their own, No man could venture on trying, of letting their wishes be known. He trusted I did not think his heretic heart was smit By a girl, because her tongue had a trick of heretical wit; Sure, he was sound in heart, whatever his head might be; And, if not very devout, he was devoted to me; And held to the saying of Paul as the strong hope of his life, That maybe the faithless husband was saved by the faith of his wife. That is the way that he speaks now, always with some poor jest, Leaving a text in the mouth with a strange and a bitter taste. So he left me that morning. Oh, how my heart beat wild! As I went into my room, and prayed to be kept then meek and mild, Speaking the truth in love; and I said to myself a psalm That nerved my soul to be patient, and dignified too and calm. Hardly I know what followed. I meant to be firm, but kind, And for her own sake tell her the thing that was in my mind; But on the hint of it only, Winnie broke out in wrath, Scornful, vowing that I had all along darkened her path, Made her life fruitless, and that she laughed at my pious advice; I was but a watery saint, and lapt in a fool's Paradise; And she could shatter my baby-bliss, if she cared to do it. Oh how she pitied my husband! mated, and now, too, he knew it, Wived by mistake, with one who was wife of his weakness only, Hardly a housekeeper even, and leaving his intellect lonely, Having no part in his genius, meeting no play of his wit, Standing outside of his true life, only a drag upon it! Vain and weak as he was, had he met but a woman of mind He yet might have run in the race, but now he is left far behind. Thus she broke out in her wrath, and packing her boxes the while, Stole a look as she stabbed me, hiding a venomous smile, Furtive; but I was heedless of all that she said about me, Till the slighting of him made me wroth, as a wife should be. Pity I lost my temper; but, all the same, truly I would Lose it to-morrow again if they say of him aught but good. Altogether it was a weary and heartless day, But there is light towards evening, and peace, too, for she is away. BOOK THIRD WINIFRED URQUHART, MATERIALIST At “Prinkle's Establishment, On principles strictly religious, For finishing girls,” I spent A year in a manner egregious; 'Twas a school of the calender kind, Meant to put a fine gloss on the mind. It was there I met Hilda Dalguise, And thought her enchantingly fair, With drops of blue heaven for her eyes, And bands of sunbeams for her hair, And the form of a dainty, round dove Just made for soft touches of love. I was not of the gushing-girl sort; My soul with ambition was fired, My tongue something sharp at retort, And the people were few I admired: And I know I detested a saint More than gambling and poweder and paint. Yet I once had a fit of devotion, And worked in the Sunday school, And whipt up a frothy emotion, And prayed, and behaved like a fool; Till my eyes were opened to see I was growing a small Pharisee. But with Hilda I felt I could sit All the day, just stroking her hair, Now to smile at her sweet lack of wit, Now to kiss her, for love, anywhere, To pat her soft hand, or be near The pink, pearly shell of her ear. Sweet-breath'd as a baby, her mind Smelt all of the mother's milk still— Infant prayers, childish hymns, and the blind, Pretty faiths they are fain to instil; And she seemed, in her white, fluffy dress, Like a bird I must stroke and caress. I pitied the beautiful child, Knowing life as I thought that I did, With her pure soul as yet undefiled, Always doing the thing she was bid, And believing all hearts were as true As the one little heart that she knew. I was just a year older than she, But twenty years older in thought: She hardly knew more than the bee That wots where the honey is got, Nor dreams that the great purple bell Has poison hid in it as well. Yet now I'm not sure that I knew So very much more than she did: There's an instinct for all that is true, And for all by wise Nature forbid, Which is deeper than such wit as then I had gathered of life and of men. I was young, and I thought myself old; A fool, and conceited me wise; I ran my crude thoughts in a mould That shaped the crude thoughts into lies With a kind of Byronic belief In a world full of baseness and grief. How much I have lived since then! What rubs I have gotten and given! Some whine for their childhood again, Some pine for the quiet of heaven: But my tent, I have no mind to strike it; 'Tis a nice, wicked world, and I like it. Old Prinkle I took for a prude, With her hands in her black thread-mits, Chap-fingered, and painfully good, Yet half-scared out of her wits; And at first I could not make out What troubled a soul so devout. 'Twas not the mere burden of care For a score of commonplace girls, Whose manners and dresses and hair, Their finger-nails, teeth, and their curls, With their morals and dinners and laughter, 'Twas her calling in life to look after. But parents and guardians then wanted, For girls at a “Finishing School,” The old wine of Faith well decanted Into flasks which must also be full Of the world, and of woman's ambition To better her single condition. So she had to be worldly-wise, And train us for “marrying well”; And she had to put on a disguise, And warn us of Death, too, and Hell; For the earthly young soul must be given At least a top-dressing of Heaven. 'Twas against the grain, I admit, For she'd fain have been honest and true She had neither much culture nor wit, She was simply a woman that knew About womanly ways and things, Such as colours and dresses and rings. A good soul, kindly and just, But timid, and living in ways She would never have chosen, but must, If she meant to live out all her days In the highly respectable station Of finishing sound education. Not a person to train the young mind, For she was not at all intellectual, And oft her religion would find All its efforts were quite ineffectual To fix her stray thoughts on devotion, Or show the least touch of emotion. Thus, when sermon was over at noon On Sunday, she'd question us on it; But her speech would wander off soon To a ribbon, a gown, or a bonnet— Or anything pretty or new She had seen in the minister's pew. She used to bubble and bell About ladylike manners and ways, In soft purling accents that well Suggested her own brighter days; Then sighed and looked timid about, As if sure that she should be found out. And the terror that haunted her so Was fear of the Governess, Lane, Who was dismal and dreary as snow When it thaws in the drizzle of rain, And sharp-eyed, and wanted the school, And held our dear Prinkle a fool. Lane had laws for all that we did, And for every hour of the day; This and that we were strictly forbid, So and so we were always to say; And we lived, like nuns in their cells, 'Mid an hourly ringing of bells. We never did any great wrong, Such as schoolboys would do on a hint; And therefore she had to be strong On the tithing of anise and mint; And taught us to wet our hard pillows At the lightest of light peccadilloes. Oh, the old-maiden morals we had, So scrupulous, prim, and demure! What the decalogue never forbade Our consciences could not endure: But life was so low-pitched and sad, It was quite a relief to be bad. Then, the wearisome lessons!—the proper, Dull prose that we read every day, Which felt as if boiled in a copper To take all the flavour away! And the colourless paragraphs writ Without reason or fancy or wit! Yet the poems were worse; they were so Lack-a-daisical pretty-sublime, Spurting upward in little jets d'eau To fall with a musical chime; And we mouthed the sweet verses, Good Heavens! How we mouthed, all at sixes and sevens! Then the darning and hemming and stitching, The broidery and the brocade, The Berlin-wool figures bewitching, And the wonderful trees that we made, Like green triangles in bloom Stuck hard on the stick of a broom! And the scales that we practised for hours, Till we hated the sight of the keys! And the evenings when, ranged out like flowers, We had our æsthetical teas, With music, charades, and advices, While the parents had biscuits and ices! French was taught by a starved refugee Who had hurled at all tyrants defiance; And a student, who stormed like the sea, Administered globules of science Well wrapt up in texts to make sure That the bane should have always its cure. And thus we were “finished” at last On principles strictly religious, Made ready “to come out” and cast Our lines in the ocean prodigious; And begin the true business of life, To find some one in want of a wife. I do not blame Prinkle the least— She did what they asked her to do; They did not wish knowledge increased Of the wise and the right and the true; But they would have a gloss of devotion On girls who had not a notion, Except just to marry and dress, And to see to their cooks and their dinners, And live on in soft idleness, And on Sunday to call themselves sinners, And be mothers, ere long, of more fools To be sent to more “Finishing schools.” They were all odious girls, except Hilda; And she was a saint, and a pest To Julia, Maria, Matilda, Amelia, Joan, and the rest; For her conscience was sure to forbid Many things that we all of us did. I never liked saints, as a rule, Always flapping their texts in your face, With warnings of sorrow and dule To be dree'd in that sulphurous place; Meanwhile they do no good in this, As they strain at their glamour of bliss. But Hilda you could not help loving— She was not too prosily pious; And often our ways disapproving, Yet she always stood faithfully by us; And did not pretend to condemn Earthly things, while she coveted them. She was not at all clever, except That she warbled a song like a bird; You'd have sat through a whole night, and wept In a trance of delight, as you heard The thrill of that exquisite strain, Like the nightingale's lyrical pain. Why do I dwell on all this, Recalling those tender, low notes? And why would I give for one kiss Of her lips all my long-treasured thoughts? Pshaw! who ever yet understood The why of each whimsical mood? Besides, it's not true; it is only A waft of old sentiment blown O'er my mind, as I sit rather lonely Recalling the days that are gone; But now is far better than then, For I live in the thoughts of great men. When I left old Prinkle's I said, “Life is good, and I'll seek my good in it; 'Twill go hard if my hand and my head Cannot work for success there, and win it; But I have not much beauty to boast, I shall ne'er be a “belle” or a “toast.” So I felt as I turned from my glass, Having looked at the brown little features; The eyes and the forehead might pass, For they were an intelligent creature's; But the mouth had a sneer rather bitter, When a young-lady simper were fitter. But my brains I could trust to for thinking, My fingers were clever to write, And thus when my heart was half sinking, It rose again higher in might; And I vowed that I would not be sold For treasures of silver and gold. I do not affect to despise The riches that make a full life, With pictures and books and fair eyes, Beaming on you, of mistress or wife; Were I man, I would purchase, of course, A mansion, a maid, and a horse. But it's not the same thing to be sold, And, perhaps, to be laid on the shelf, As it is to have and to hold These chattels and goods for yourself; And, besides, I was tired of the way Men talked, who had nothing to say. So I gave up the young-lady life, The novels, the calls, and the moping, And the hope to be somebody's wife, And the cherished girl-dream of eloping, Or doing some thing that would ring Unlike the dull commonplace thing. I said, Men are stronger than we, Though our minds be as subtle as theirs; For they train the high Reason to see, While we put on fantastical airs, And are fain to look silly, although Our folly has cunning below. But I would be true to my sex, Would learn with the boldest to think, Would grapple with things that perplex, Would stand on the verge and the brink Where the seen and the unseen are met, There to gather what truth I could get. I had “finished” my education, But I found it was now to begin; For formless and void as creation, With the wan, diffuse light breaking in On the first day of darkness, I knew Neither what nor how I should do. So I read from morning till night, Brows knit, and with resolute brain, Till darkness turned slowly to light; Yet it came with an aching pain, For I passed not a word or a jot, Till it gave up its treasure of thought. Yet vague and unguided, I missed The right path among many ways, And found myself folded in mist Of a dim metaphysical haze, Till I went up to town, and began The true science-study of man. Then the first thing I learnt was, to know I had everything yet to learn— To begin with the taproots that grow In the life we can faintly discern, And trace from the great mother-earth The growth of our thought and our worth. It was to an uncle I went, A learned physician in town, Whose evenings of leisure were spent In converse with men of renown, Who joined in a happy alliance Of politics, letters, and science. They talked of the small and the great, They spoke of the near and the far, They searched the dim secrets of Fate, They traced through the fire-mist and star The growth of the marvellous Whole, And birth of the mind and the soul. They asked for no God to explain, They asked but slow shaping of time To account for the thought in the brain, And the conscience of duty and crime, And the rich, varied life of the creature, With its changes of organ and feature. What a world of high wonder was this, Growing all out of atoms in motion! Crowned at length with the glory and bliss Of life in the earth and the ocean! And all by the pure force of law, Without error or failure or flaw! So I turned to hard study of science— I had tasted it mixed up with creed, But I broke up that foolish alliance, Seeking truth, and the truth does not need Poor safeguards of faith to secure That the heart shall be humble and pure. Truth only is good for the soul, Truth only is safe to pursue, And Truth will her secrets unroll But to him who is fearless and true, And will search out the fact with his test, And bow where the reason is best. I had the clear courage of truth, And plunged into Häckel at once; The way was not easy and smooth As they make ways in England and France: But then it was thorough, and that Was the end I was fain to be at. How I toiled now that I had the key, And gathered up fact and example! How the world opened up unto me As knowledge grew lucid and ample! I hewed through the jungle a way From the dark into clearness of day. All realms of dear nature I sought, Far and near, both the vast and minute, What from depths of the sea had been brought, What had lain in the rocks at the root Of the hills, and the dead and alive From the lair and the nest and the hive. Girls called with their mothers to see The treasures my patience had stored, And talked with a simper to me Of the wonderful works of the Lord, And the beautiful butterfly wings, And the fishes and insects and “things.” They knew not the thoughts that I thought, They dreamed not the visions I saw, They wist not that, still as I wrought In the footsteps of infinite law, Their creeds seemed as vanishing cloud Which had wrapped the dead mind in a shroud. How I laughed at their priests, now I knew The high priests of nature serene, Who sought but the clear and the true, And the law which for ever hath been, And scorned every meaningless phrase Where a lie lay, perdue, in a haze. I thought how they spent their rich lives, Sweeping heaven for lost links in the stars, Or brooding o'er bees in their hives, Or watching the ants in their wars, Or peering with keen microscope Where the vibriole whirls in the drop, Or freezing through chill Arctic winters, Ice-bound in the Polar sea, Or daring wild beasts and adventures For a tropical bird or a tree; While the vicar grows wheezy and fat, And the minister sleek as a cat. The apostles and martyrs, I said, Of our new modern world are these; They have struggled and suffered and bled, They have sought neither honour nor ease, But they lead the great march in the van Of progress and freedom for man. Facts, ordered and tested with skill, They gather, which surely declare The law which all beings fulfil, And how through all ages they fare From the cell to the organ, and soar Ever up from the less to the more. How my bosom swelled high as I rose To the height of that formative thought, And saw the dim fire-mist disclose The worlds when as yet they were not, And the life which was one day to flower From its subtle and manifold power. What a poem of nature was there! How it linked all being in one, The tree and the bird in the air, And the lichen that tints the grey stone, And the coral that builds the wild reef, With man and his glory and grief! They tell of a Fall bringing thorns, They talk of a Lost Paradise, They prate of a devil with horns Ever plotting some wicked device, They will have it that death entered in, When Eve ate the apple of sin. But truth, searching out the old myths, Sees growth evermore going on, And, breaking old fetters like wyths, Finds death when no sin could be done; Not a lapse, but a law of survival, Where the fittest treads down its weak rival. Poor fools! we keep wrapping our minds In the old tattered rags of the Jew, And shiver and shake as fresh winds, Cloud-driving, make larger our view; And we draw our rags closer about, Though the faith be as chill as the doubt. But this is the truth that alone Can save from the fever and fret, That the high law changeth for none, That it holds all enmeshed in its net, And that life and death and endeavour Ever have been, and shall be for ever. And life is the fuller for each Whose death makes it richer for all; Immortal the race, bound to reach Ever onward; but singly we fall Into dim silent graves on the road, As the weary soul lays down its load. But the dim, silent graves by the way Are the footprints of progress for man; And we are not so selfish as they Who only will die, if they can Hope to knit up again from the dead The old tangled hank of their thread. A nobler faith ours; for we know That the organs, dissolving for ever, Shall paint the spring-flowers as they grow, But we shall return again never; And we grudge not the life that shall give Larger life unto them that do live. We work for the good of the whole; We work, and the rest cometh soon; We work with no fear for the soul; We work in a light as of noon; And the peace, by and by, shall be ours Of the long drowsy grass and the flowers. We have faith; we have passed from the mist Of doubt and denial and fear Into high and calm realms that are kissed By the sunshine of certainty clear; And the great thought of duty is freed From the dross of a self-seeking creed. Oh the gladness I had as this grew Into clearness now day after day! At first, I shrank back from the new, Startling thoughts that it brought into play, And the courage of truth that it needed, And the loneliness as it proceeded. But plunging, at length, in the tide, I flung off the shivering fit As the current swept stately and wide, And I cast myself wholly on it; And slowly the loneliness found A gladsome life gathering round. No shade of a drear world to come Lay dismally now on my earth; No fruitless regretting struck dumb The laughter of light-hearted mirth; I had conscience to prompt me, of course, But never to sting with remorse. The needle that points to the Pole Does not prick the poor sailor who errs As the big billows tumble and roll, Or the long swell throbs and stirs; But simply, by night and by day, The needle just tells him the way. Even so was I merry and glad As I walked in the law and the light; And so was I not very sad When I wandered at times from the right; And ever a needle was true, And showed me the thing I should do. I did not sin and repent, And then fall a-sinning again, As if conscience were properly meant To keep up a blister of pain; But I tried to walk in the truth, And to lose not a joy of my youth. They say that a vanishing creed Makes the heart very weary and sad, That its wounds must open and bleed, That its ways must be evil and bad; But I ne'er was in happier mood, Nor so true to the right and the good. Well; just then, I heard, by the way, That Hilda was wedded, and wrote A well-meaning letter to say How it pleased me to think of her lot, Reminding her, too, like a fool, Of a promise she gave me at school. I offered a visit, to share In the joy of a life that I loved; But I fancy she did not just care To be kissed and “honeyed” and “doved” Before me, but would be alone Till the honeymoon sweetness was gone. So she put me off for a year With this and the other excuse, Not one of them simple and clear, But all of them shifty and loose; And yet when she finally sent, And asked me to visit, I went. Then I dropt on a scene quite idyllic, A nook of the old Paradise— A rose-embowered cot on a hillock, With a garden sunny and nice, And my saint and her poet too yawning At the commonplace life that was dawning. I cannot describe; but I know The country was not picturesque; The granite lay barren below, And a broad moor, as flat as my desk, Stretched inwards, and down to the sea There was hardly a bush or a tree. But inside was pretty enough; The rooms all so fresh and so sweet— Not a jar, or a word that was rough, Not a thing but was dainty and neat, And Hilda so gentle and still, Though the meek little fool had a will. I did not much take to her now; She seemed to be stunted in growth,— A pale, sickly bloom on a bough, A flat, tasteless thing in the mouth; A chaste, cold, passionless ghost, Weeping much for a babe she had lost. I tried to cheer her a bit, But she did not interest me; She never did smack much of wit, But now she was dull as the sea When the east wind blows its grey haar, As it moans on the sand and the bar. It was always that baby, forsooth! As if blossoms had never been nipt, As if lambs never died in their youth, As if no other babies had slipt Away to the peace of the worm From life, and its trouble and storm. But her Poet was really a man; Not a clinker only of rhymes, But one who could thoughtfully scan The world, and the men, and the times, And see their meanings, and sing The vision of life which they bring. He was not the least of a saint; But worked, with a patient might, In the Artist's unconstraint, With the Artist's frank delight In the quaint and the unexpected Moulds which his thought selected. Still mooning in twilight dim, His humour was just to croon Any song that was pleasing to him,— Fresh words to the old, old tune, And his thought was but half-expressed In the manner of mirthful jest. He had ever a kindly touch In his quips and tricks and mocks, But playfully hinted much Abhorred by the orthodox; Yet he trifled, when he should have smote With the sharp battle-axe of his thought. He was vain too—he was a poet— You hardly could flatter enough; And you did not need to show it, He could swallow the rankest stuff; Though he laughed at himself as he did it, Yet next time he did not forbid it. He never was thorough or strong, But fanciful only, and odd, Never sure of the right and the wrong, And he still would believe in a God, And talked, with a vague kind of beauty, Of the soul, and its hope and its duty. But that is the way with most men; They darenot much more than to doubt; They dare not, one man out of ten, To think their thought thoroughly out; The practical plucks at their sleeve, And they're frightened to shock and to grieve. I played on his foible awhile; And made myself useful to him, Now giving a touch to his style, Now setting his papers in trim, Now glancing at nature to show it In lights that are new to the poet. But he never could cast off the shapes Or shallow and silly romance— The frost-work that dims, as it drapes, Our window, and hides from our glance The beauty of truth, and the story Of life with its wonder and glory. The poet will still be a child, And will curtain the sun to his slumbers; At the great chemic laws he half smiled, And laughed at the rhythm of its numbers, And joked at the glass or the knife Detecting the secret of life. Yet I liked him; but Hilda grew jealous— She cared not for verse or for rhyme, Except as the wind in the bellows, That brightened her hearth for the time; Yet she would have the whole of his heart, And was touchy and sniffy and tart. And one night he read us a ballad, As we sat the work-table around, Which his humour composed like a salad Of any green stuff that it found Cropping up on a fanciful soil, And he mixed it with wit as with oil. I am sure that I have it somewhere, For I wrote it all down the next day: Here it is; and a sorry affair It is to have made such a fray: Yet 'twas like him, it must be confessed To make sentiment flower out of jest. JUDAS ISCARIOT The very Prince of Darkness Came once to Heaven's gate, Where Peter and the angels Talk together as they wait; And he brought with him a spirit In a very dismal state. Then Satan: “I'm in trouble, And come here to get advice; I've been going up and down there Where you think we are not nice, And they will not have this fellow Among them at any price. “I took him first to Lamech And the bloody race of Cain, But they rose in flat rebellion, That so mean a rogue should gain A place with gallant fellows Who in simple wrath had slain. “Then I thought of those wild Herods With their burning diadem, And their spirits, ever haunted By the babes of Bethlehem: But they would not have the traitor Coming sneaking among them. “After that I looked to Ahab, And the panther Jezebel; But she sprang up like a fury, ‘It were shame unspeakable To lodge a half-hanged felon Where a queen of men must dwell.’ “I'm afraid there's not a corner Into which they'll let him in; The common rogues are furious To confound them with his sin, And my people are excited, And the place is full of din.” Then Peter: “Traitor Judas, Thou hearest what he says, How the murderers and demons Abhor thee and thy ways, Thou betrayer of the Holy, Who the Ancient is of Days.” Then Judas answered meekly: “Yea, Peter, they are right; Cain and Lamech, Ahab, Herod, They were godless men of might, But not so vile as I am— Oh they loathe me, and are right. “Jezebel that slew the prophets, Fawned not on the life she stole; Ahab only smote the servants, Not the Lord who bare our dole; There should be a hell expressly For my miserable soul. “Let my name be named with horror, Let my place be wrapt in gloom, Let me even be hell's lone outcast, With a solitary doom— I that kissed Him, and betrayed Him To the cross, and to the tomb.” Then Satan: “There's the mischief, He goes whining like a saint; I could keep my people quiet, But he'd have them penitent. It's as bad as if a parson Made their very hearts grow faint.” But, as Peter looked on Judas, Sunk in utter misery, Lo! there rose before his vision, A grey morning by the sea, And a weary, broken spirit On the shores of Galilee. “Oh, once, too, I despairèd, For my Lord I had denied, And once my heart was breaking, For I cursed Him, and I lied; I did not slay myself, but yet I wished that I had died. “Leave thy burden with me, Satan, He is not too bad for me; He will get ‘his own place’ duly, And it is not mine to be A breaker of the bruisèd, Or the judge of such as he.” I praised it; but she gazed to heaven As if he had sinned the great sin Which is not atoned or forgiven, And no touch of pity can win, And nobody knows what it is, But her soul sat and trembled for his. She said, “It was jesting with sin, And nothing but grief came of that; Few may play with the devil, and win, Whatever the game they are at; And Heaven was not surely a place For one who despaired of its grace.” I said, “It was quaint and bizarre, And its humour was what I liked best; And I thought they were much on a par, Who spoke, or in earnest or jest, Of the souls of the bad or the just, When their brains were a small pinch of dust.” She fired up at that; “Did I mean That the soul was all one as the brain? Had I only a faith in the Seen, With its animal pleasure and pain?— Had I left the old paths, that were trod By the saints, and the true men of God.” I could not help smiling to see Her look so bewildered and scared, When her anger broke out upon me, As if I had her husband ensnared In some terrible plot to disown All the gods that have ever been known. “It was I made him mock and blaspheme— I who knew no more than the cat! And her life had been bright as a dream Till I came with the dusk like a bat; For I hated the name of the Lord, Whom every true woman adored. “I was impious, false, and cruel; I could sit at her fire and sing; I would fain rob her life of the jewel She prized above everything; Yet all that she might have forgiven, But I mocked at her God up in heaven.” Of course, he behaved like a man, Tried to soothe her, and smooth matters down, And then, backing out of it, ran Away to some job of his own; But he got me persuaded to stay When I should have at once gone away. That was weak, I confess; but the place Was nice, and his humour was pleasant, And there was such a light in his face, Now and then, when his wife was not present, That—well, I remained for a time, Enduring her moods and his rhyme. But her temper got worse every day; She feared me, and her I despised; And he still let her have her own way, Only soothed her, and meekly advised; So I left them, at last, in a trance Of piety, love, and romance. I hear that she blamed me because I made myself useful to him; But what could I do when she chose To be distant and silent and prim! In truth, she was never his mate, Poor thing! she was only his Fate. Of course, he was nothing to me; He wanted a slave in his wife, Who should worship him low on her knee, And serve with the breath of her life; And there's nothing I ever abhorred Like a man for my Master and Lord. My Master is science divine, My Lord is the truth that I seek, My service is Freedom, and mine Was ne'er the poor heart of the meek: I would lean upon none, for I live On that which great Nature can give. Poor Hilda! I give her my pity, And I pity her husband still more; He will rhyme away life in a ditty, She will make of her soul a heartsore; Religion will quarrel in time With Romance—and he'll put it in rhyme: And be comforted, too, as he reads The tale of his sorrow and grief, Binding up his poor heart while it bleeds, With the balm of a smooth-rhyming leaf; He will drop for his Hilda a tear, And gloat o'er his verse for a year. Now I think of it, somebody said, That the crash had come some time ago; She had either gone off, or was dead, And a poem from that was to grow, Which was certain to touch every heart With its feeling of fine tragic Art. If I had not that paper to write On the dawning of mind in Molluscs, And that other to set people right On the subject of Molars and Tusks, I think, I would like just to see What he says about Hilda and me. BOOK FOURTH LUKE SPROTT, EVANGELIST Evangelist and village smith, a man of good report, And cunning among cattle, known to all the country near, Luke could make the bellows snore, and also painfully exhort, And feared the Lord, and had a new religion once a year. He had been a Chartist leader in his hot and hopeful youth, Talking gunpowder and bayonets about the rights of man, Until he got converted, when he preached about the Truth, The Blood and the Atonement, the Covenant and Plan. Tired of his parish kirk, he tried the Baptists for a season, Tired of them, and turned a Methodist, recanting all the past, Tired again, and took to shady faiths that shun the ways of reason; And every change, he vowed, had brought the peace of God at last. And every change had left a stratum of belief on him, With fossils here of Presbytery, there of his Baptist time, Then traces of the Methodist, and now the footprints dim Of creatures that had sprawled across the later mud and slime. For partly Antinomian now, and partly Manichee, He blundered back to Church, and deemed that he was orthodox, And stormed at modern thinking as the raging of the sea That cast up mire and dirt upon the everlasting rocks. And yet his heart was right, although his thought was so confused— A tangled knot of broken thrums he could not extricate; All ordered thought of reason and of science he abused, But he was full of pity, and his love was very great. And because he was so earnest, and because he spoke good words Whose meaning none searched nicely, and because he seemed to stir Serious thoughts in careless hearts, as if he touched their higher chords, He was sought, and he was looked to as a chosen minister. A great broad-headed fellow, working hard through all the week, And thinking hard, the while he worked, upon the fate of man, He was fain to save the sinner and the erring, and would speak A world about the chaff and wheat, and sifting with a fan. There was a thick husk in his voice that weirdly rose and fell, As with a knotted fist he smote upon a horny palm, And poured his prophet-burden about sin and death and hell, Now like tender, pleading Gospel, now like bitter cursing Psalm. The man had power, for certain, for he had a human heart, Gleams of humour, tender touches, too, of pathos, and throughout A vein of clear sincerity whose might is more than art, And the firmness of a soul that had not any wavering doubt. And when he came about our house, at first, I liked to hear His pithy words, good-humoured if you did not say him nay; And stories of himself that were like flotsam drifting near From tempests of an unknown sea whose storms were far away. He had a keen shrewd humour, but it mostly had to do With the meaner part of nature, and was blind to what is best; He put his finger on a blot that shamed and humbled you, And thought he read you truest when you showed unworthiest. Though God was always in his mouth, you did not feel the awe Which hangs about the Presence when he spoke of the Supreme; He was more at home with Satan; then he spake as if he saw; But to me his speech of God was like an echo, or a dream. And yet I liked him, swinging with long strides at gloaming late, And stretching his vast limbs beside the blazing winter fire, With pale, lean face, and lanky hair, and speech deliberate, That never ceased to flood the house, and never seemed to tire. Not that it was good to hear him, for it did not raise you higher; Is showed your baser self, but did not rouse the better part; He could search the hidden evil, but he never could inspire Unto any nobler life by his unveiling of the heart. Man was not lovely to him, not yet lovely was his God; The cynic thought breeds mostly bitter faith in things divine; Who sees no beauty in the soul that bears its human load Shall see but little glory where the gods of glory shine. There was humour in his sayings, though he meant them not for jest— Too earnest he for mirth, except a hard and bitter grin; Yet his shrewdness had an oddness being quaintly oft expressed, And I laughed with laugh the keener that I had to laugh within. 'Twas something fresh to me, to follow slowly up and down The windings of his tangled talk, and make the thought complete; I perused him like a volume whose leaves, dog-eared and brown, Held bits of the rough poetry that lies about our feet. There was a rude ideal which he struggled to attain, A poem floating in his mind, but mangled by the lack Of ordered thought to shape the hope, the passion and the pain; And he blundered into broken paths to shun the beaten track. What puzzled me about him was, to see him still so sure, So changeful, yet so certain that his way was always right; And that his vision was so dim, although his heart was pure, And that he could so grossly err, yet be a child of light. I read his meaning partly, as one reads a palimpsest, Dimly traced upon the vellum under monkish hymns and prayers And trumpery tales of wonder; and I understood him best When I watched his human kindness taking up our human cares. He fancied I was smitten with his views, when I was only Making him a curious study for the work I had to do, Just a theme for long reflection, as I sat in silence lonely, Shaping out the world around me in the poet's large review. But I had no right to trifle with the follies of a friend, Or to play upon his humour to find matter for a book; I might have known that that would come to some unhappy end, For to toy with human hearts, is more than human hearts will brook. 'Tis the sin of art's fine passion that it only seeks to know, Not to perfect, any creature that his lot he may fulfil; It has charity to bear with any rankest weeds that grow Unto any picturesqueness, and to leave them growing still. Priest and prophet try to save, and so their work is blessed; but mine Strove only just to see, and reproduce the picture true, Making sacrifice of duty for the trimming of a line, Heeding not of higher wisdom in the itch for something new. Oh my heart and its misgivings! I am never wholly sure. Was the art of Greece so perfect that its life was also high? Is the heavenly vision only seen what time the heart is pure? Is the poem but the poet as he dares to live and die? Could I be a mere onlooker, and yet see what should be seen? Standing calmly on the outside, could I paint this life aright? Nay, that could never come to any perfect fruit, I ween, Could yield but sickly blossom nipt by any frosty night. Better wield a pick or spade, or drive a furrow in the soil, Bear a hod, or hurl a barrow among fustian-wearing men, Win humblest daily bread by daily sweat of honest toil, Than live to find in life but stuff for scrawling with a pen! One evening Luke, as usual, held discourse of human ills, And I turned me somewhat weary from his everlasting bleat, Monotonous, like sheep among the solitary hills, As he mooned away to Hilda sitting on the window seat. Something, I know, had fretted me—I cannot now say what, Only living among dreams, and sitting far into the night, With none to bid good-speed unto the labour I was at, And a pained, though dumb suspicion that, perhaps, I did not right To peril all the tender bliss of home for such an aim, Bred an irritable temper when I was not all alone, And so it fevered me to hear—though they were not to blame— Her weary stitching needle, and his weary preaching drone. He had, somehow, raised the wonder that begets a woman's faith, The sense of power and mystery that awes her with belief; His God was not the Father that giveth life and breath, Yet she looked to him for guidance, and for comfort in her grief. Women cling to any spirit that is confident and bold, Taking doubt to be a sin, the sign of an untrustful mind; And I was sure of nought; I saw the shadows round me fold, And felt that life was very dark, and I was very blind. I was not fit to guide her, for myself I could not guide Through the valley of the shadow; only groping as I went, Step by step, and never certain of the shepherd at my side, And my soul was often troubled, and my heart was often faint. But he was sure of all things in earth and hell and heaven, Sure that we were devil's children all, and heirs of wrath to come, Sure that on the bitter cross a sum of ransom had been given To purchase men from Satan, or at least to purchase some. And this so certain dogmatism she took for faith divine, Infallible, intrenched within a wall of texts and creeds, And believed in him entirely, while she turned from words of mine As from henbane, hemlock, nightshade, or other deadly weeds. That night he went on, ceaseless, in his hortatory tone Half-saying and half-singing, and I could not choose but hear Broken snatches of his doctrine, like the melancholy moan Of the wind that in the crannies sounds so dismal to the ear. Luke's Discourse It is not our sins that send us there: There are sinners as bad in the heavenly choir, And souls as sweet as the summer air Up to their lips in the lake of fire. Stained with vices, as black as night, Some shall be found on the narrow way; For seen by the Lord from His holy height All your virtues are black as they. It is our unbelief slams the door, And rams in the bolt too, right in our face; But so much the more are our sins, the more Glory there is to abounding grace. What, if one wronged you, meaning it not? What, if one hurt you just by a word? No great credit to wipe that blot, Or to forget what you need not have heard. But if I hate you, make you a liar, Slay your dearest, and mock at his name, Oh, the mercy that rises higher The higher the sinner's guilt and blame! Only believe in the Lamb they slew, And in the blood that from Him did flow; Only believe that He died for you, And it shall wash you as white as the snow. Oh, but the Blood is the life of Faith! Even one drop would a world redeem. Blood on the lintels, and ancient Death Passed by the door like a hideous dream; Blood on his raiment made the Priest Holy to stand where the Lord was seen; Blood on the altar wrath appeased; Blood on the sinner, and he is clean. Science and learning are but snares, Reason and knowledge they are traps; Better lie down with wolves and bears Than with critical principles, books, and maps. Once I starved in the Hebrides, Nearly a month, on whelks and clams, And fishy birds from the grey salt seas, While I tried to think they were beeves and lambs: So is the soul that feeds on stuff Reason gives it instead of bread; So is the man who is swollen with fluff Science is fain to put into his head. These cannot take one sin away, Bring no peace to the troubled heart; As well down on your knees and pray To the graven image of heathen art. Children make-believe anything, whiles They have got plenty to eat and drink, Make a grand feast out of slates and tiles, And water is wine if you only wink. Oh how nicely they carve a stone! Oh how pretty they drink the toast! This is the shortbread, that the scone, There are the platters of boiled and roast! But let the thirst and hunger come, And give them for bread their slates and stones, And poor little hearts! all their prattle is dumb, And make-believe ends in tears and moans. So is the soul that plays with shams, So till there comes an hour of need; So shall it starve on whelks and clams Of rational thought and virtuous deed. But let him see the guilt and gloom, But let him smell the burning lake, And hear, as it were, the billows boom Where is no shore for them to break. Only the Blood then that atones, Only the Blood can give him rest: Hence with your make-believe slates and stones, He must have truth, for truth is best. Hell and the devil (I thought the words Came from his lips with a kind of smack, And round and rich, as the singing birds Dwell on a choice note, and call it back)— Hell and the devil will have their due; Oh, you may rush at a ditch or hedge, And scramble through with a scratch or two, And a tattered skirt to the other ledge; But there's no bottom to yonder pit, There is no other side to hell, There is no make-believe in it, And there for ever the faithless dwell. A terrible picture! aye, and whiles I have almost thought that it could not be, As I looked on the bay with its sunny smiles Glinting over the laughing sea. There the fishermen trim their boats, The wives at the door are baiting lines, Mirth of the children blithely floats Up from the beach as they touch the spines Of round sea-urchin under the dulse, Or hunt the crab in the shady pool, And the small waves beat like a tranquil pulse, And the seal comes out of the cavern cool, Bobbing his head above the sea, There where the white gulls dive and swim, And the swift ships pass like clouds that be Hung on the grey horizon dim. Then I have thought, till my heart grew faint, And my head swam with the vision dire: “O beautiful Earth, is it really meant Thou shalt be wrapped in the flaming fire? These happy homes where I oft have sat, These hands I have held in friendly grip, Those curly children I love to pat, Or to press their cheeks with a prayerful lip, Can they be fated—one of them even— Yet in the outer dark to lie, Far away hid from the glory of Heaven, And gnawed by the worm that cannot die? Oh, the anguish that thought has sent Thrilling all through my heart and brain! And Word and warning and argument The Spirit has pleaded with me in vain. I thought it was righteous to rebel, I thought that it was for God I spoke, When I wrestled against the pains of hell, Like Jacob, until the morning broke. But who am I to reject His word That tells of the deathless worm and fire? And where were the mercy of the Lord If it plucked not brands from the burning pyre? Here I broke in, You should have heard your heart, for it was true; I think it was the voice of God for pity pleading then, And you have crushed your pity with a text that deadened you, And texts are surely meant for quickening nobler thoughts in men. He took no notice of my speech; I wot not if he heard, Because there rose a gust of wind, shrill-whistling from the sea; But by and by there came a lull, and with the lull a word I was not meant to hear, though it was shrewdly meant for me. Truly you tell me his faith is gone, Truly I see only doubting in him: He has buried the Christ, and sealed the stone, And watches all night 'mid the shadows dim, That none may quicken his soul again, That none may quicken his hope anew; And I have noted the sorrow and pain Of the great love that was wasting you, Lady, as slowly the cloud came down, Slowly and coldly the mist was creeping Over a soul that is dear as your own; And angels were watching with you and weeping. Yea, I have grieved for him, and I have prayed Through the long night, as I watched afar, Sign of the poor part in life that he played, The lamp from his window that gleamed like a star; There he is toiling, I said, for a bubble, Which when he touches it, shall be no more, Reaping the harvest of sorrow and trouble,— Here I will pray till his labour is o'er: Long as his lamp burns for folly of fame, So long shall mine that his soul I may win; Shall he unwearying toil for a name, And I grow weary to save him from sin? Thus have I stormed at the gates of heaven All the more that he laughed at me, Just that his soul might to me be given All the more we could never agree. I see that he mocks me, and flouts me, and jibes At all the things that I honour most, And seeks the lore of the clerks and scribes More than the seal of the Holy Ghost. He would put me into a book, I know, That wits might crackle their jests so droll, And laugh at the preaching smith whose blow Could smite the iron, and miss the soul. Yet I have loved him, oh so well! Yet I have prayed for him, oh how long! But he would risk all the terrors of hell For the point of a jest, or the rhyme of a song. Oh, he is just like a schoolboy that cares Only to hear his whip go crack In the dim streets, and the silent squares, While the echo comes ringing back; High in the heaven he would sit and brood, With a flickering smile on his dubious lip; And down in hell would find some good In trying how loud he could crack his whip. You are wroth with me now, for the truth that I speak; You would have me to smile, and beck, and cringe, And not let the gate of darkness creak, But smoothly work on its well-oiled hinge, And silently close on an erring soul, With just a snap when the deed is done; And then I must whimper and condole, With a lying hope that the goal was won, Although he never had run the race, Never so much as made the start. But I cannot be sweet before your face, And false to you in my inmost heart. Tell me not of his love of truth, Kindly spirit, and thoughtful care, Or the pure love of his noble youth— Tell me of faith, if faith be there. Water the coals, and they will burn, Sun-dry the faggot, and it will flame; So virtue or vice will serve your turn, And make you ready for wrath and shame. Faith alone is the master-key To the strait gate and the narrow road; The others but skeleton picklocks be, And you never shall pick the locks of God. But hush! His thunders are in the heaven, Rumbling low through the clouded sky, Like the roll of wheels that are swiftly driven With flames from the whirling tires that fly. Who knows? They are maybe sent for him, To clothe his spirit with awe and fear: Close we the windows and sing a hymn, And pray while the Lord is plainly here. Well to improve the solemn hour, Well to smite while the bar is hot; Surely the Lord is great in power, Woe to him that believeth not. He had been speaking low to her, and wist not I could hear; And though I heard I heeded not, my thoughts were so intent Watching the signs of coming storm that darkled far and near, And all his words fell off from me, like arrows blunt and spent. From every part of heaven the clouds crept, slow, across the sky, Black clouds, with lurid edges, and rifts of leaden grey, And earth lay still and breathless as they mustered there on high, Nor lark nor throstle noting the dimly dying day. Now, all was wrapt in darkness, without twinkling of a star, And the big thunder-rain came down in sullen warning drops; Beneath the silent trees the silent kine were grouped, and far The sea moaned, and a shiver passed along the tall tree-tops. And then it burst in fury—rain and hailstones mixed with fire, And sudden gusts of wind that howled across the stony moor, With awful lulls, and shattering peals that nearer grew and higher; And one great ball of hissing fire fell almost at the door. A wild, black night of tempest, such as men remember long In the dull undated life of a sleepy country town, When forests fell before the wind, streams swept off bridges strong, And church-towers, lightning-shivered, reeled, and then came crashing down. Awe-stricken, yet entranced, I watched, with tremulous joy, each phrase And movement as it registered itself upon the mind, While the strained sense, exulting in the wonder and amaze, Jarred at a common sound amid the thunder and the wind. Thus when I heard his husky voice 'mid nature's grandest tones Of so transcendent harmony, for harmony was there In all the roll of thunder, that awethrilled my joints and bones, It smote me like an insult—that suggestion of a prayer. I did not speak at first; I did but grip his bony wrist, And whisper to be silent, and led him to his seat, Imperious in a wrath whose stern resolve was only hissed Into his ear; and he was cowed, and sat in silence meet. Silent only for a little; by and by there came a lull, And coughing, he spake something about the wrath of heaven; Then I said, When God was preaching other sermons sounded dull, And I wanted no “improvement” of the lesson He had given. I said that, for myself, I did not wish to be improved, And doubted if he could at all improve the work of God; But if he thought the wrath of heaven against himself was moved, He might pray there like a worm on whom his Deity had trod. I added that the tempest was a mercy clear to me, The very thing I needed for the volume that I wrote; It came in time precisely, and my book was sure to be A great success, with such a glorious picture in the plot. I had just come to a point where I required a thunderstorm, And heaven was kind to send it in the very nick of time; And I was very grateful not to be a trampled worm, But a favourite of the gods who gave me matter for my rhyme. If the Father cares for sparrows, He may surely care for books, And send a troubled author storm or sunshine which he needs; If winds were sent to farmers for the winnowing of their stooks, Surely poets might get weather for recording of His deeds. And why should men be grateful for a fine potato crop, Or sunshine for the oats, or rain to make the turnips grow, And thankless for the wholesome books that fruitful authors drop For a publisher's good season up in Paternoster Row. And God was good to me, I said, in gathering His cloud, I saw a special providence in letting loose the wind; That He cared to feed the hungry every pious heart allowed, But He must doubly care to feed the hunger of the mind. The more he stared and gasped at me, the more I pushed him hard; Saying, Surely the book-harvest was heaven's peculiar care; The Church might be God's vineyard, but the verses of the bard Were the ripe fruits of His orchard, and the flowers that made it fair; And novels were the poppies, red and sunny in the field, And histories were wholesome oats, and essays were the rich Clover-fields that fed His kine, and made the butter that they yield, While sermons were the small weeds growing in the hedge or ditch; And tracts were for his horses, like the vetches and the tares To be munched up by the bushel, being savourless and dry; But songs were his ripe apples; and his apricots and pears Were ballads and the lyric strains of love, that never die. I wot not why I chattered so amid the sullen lull, While the tempest took its breath, and gathered for another burst; It was his face that tempted me, it looked so blank and dull; And partly I revenged me for his talk with Hilda, first. Because he was a preacher, she had let him say to her What no one else had dared to say without her proud rebuke; But any thing that called itself a Christian minister She heard as she would hearken to the Volume of the Book. Low in my heart I laughed then to see him stare and gasp At that imagined book for which the thunder had been sent, And at his puzzled horror as I buzzed like stinging wasp, Too swift for his slow movements, in my wanton merriment. No book then was I writing that needed storm or calm, Nor could I copy Nature in that hard and soulless way, Barely cataloguing facts, although I heard, as 'twere a Psalm Of awe-inspiring joy, the grand orchestral thunder play. And truth may lie in laughter too, and wisdom in a jest, And wit may lend its sparkle to the reverential thought; And solemn fools shall talk to you their wisest and their best, And leave you very weary with the nothing you have got. At length he rose in anger, would not stay beneath a roof That might be smote with judgment for the blasphemies I said: Would I jest at the Eternal, while His thunders rolled aloof, And His awful sword was flashing in the lightning overhead? The world was blind and faithless, and full of vain conceit Of wisdom which was foolishness, and would not know the Lord; And I might write brisk words that, one day, I would fain delete When He came in His glory, whom the Universe adored. I did not bid him stay, although the storm burst forth anew, And snapt a grand old pine as if it had been but a reed; There were five behind our cottage, and I loved them, and I knew Their features and their voices, for they spoke to me, indeed. They were like living things to me, with thoughts and memories And passions of the women in the untamed Druid times; I heard them sing their skalds at night unto the raving seas, And moan their rugged lyke-wakes in the ancient Runic rhymes. I called them Druid sisters, for I wist that they had seen The black priests in the forest, and the altars, and the smoke; And in the evening still they talked to me of what had been Ere the Roman smote the savage, or the Christian morning broke. Now, startled by the sudden crash, I did not think of him, But of the tall grey sister who was growing bald atop, And grey with clinging lichen that had feathered every limb, And in my mind I saw her bow her lofty head, and drop, While o'er their fallen sister all the others scream and moan In unrestrained anguish; so I did not bid him stay; The night was wild and fearful, and the road was dark and lone, But he had the wild-beast instinct to surely find his way. And so I let him go, and then I thought that I did right; Could any soul have sat there to be drenched with commonplace, Slushed with dull ditch-water preachments, when the awe of that great night Had strung the mind to highest pitch, and touched the heart with grace? My being was at white heat, and he would have plunged it so, Hissing, into his cold water; and I did rebel at that; And there are times when silence, if the preacher did but know, Shall preach to better purpose than a sermon stale and flat. Thus he went forth in wrath, and I had no regretful thought Hearing him bang the door, and stride into the stormy night; I sat in silence, ordering all the pictures I had got, Or glancing now at Hilda through the glimmering candle-light. By and by, the storm abated, and the moon came forth, at length, In a clear breadth of heaven, with all the countless host of stars, And nature did assert the calm tranquillity of strength, And bridled with the Pleiades the wrath of angry Mars. I looked out from my window to Orion and his belt; She looked out from her window to the lone star near the Pole; And not a word we spake as yet, but in my heart I felt A shadow creeping coldly, like eclipse, across my soul. There she sat, pale and anxious, with a wistful frightened look That seemed to shrink from me, although she neither spoke nor stirred; There I sat, dull and listless, with my eyes upon a book Whereof, although I read and read, I knew not e'er a word. Very silent were we both; but how I yearned for her I loved! As gazing through the candle-light, I saw her quivering lip, And how the great tears gathered, and how the loose ring moved, Unconscious, from the knuckle to the slender finger-tip. I thought I had done right; but I was not so sure next day;— Morning thoughts are sweet and tender—and I whispered my regret; I had been vexed and angry; and I might have bid him stay; But hinted that his head would be the cooler for the wet. Ah me! ah me! that thoughtless itch for saying clever things! Ah me! ah me! that little sense of what a word may do! Ah me! the woeful echo from the weary past that rings Words that are very old now, but the grief is always new! That day was full of rumours sad, of boats swamped out at sea, Guns booming in the offing, and wrecks strewn along the shore, And the fierce-rushing river had flooded all the lea, And left but stones and gravel where the clover grew before. Weary and sad, at evening I hasted home, with all My budget of ill news, to find yet worse awaiting there, For Hilda, with a face that did my very heart appal, Sat, white and chill, beside the fire, with fixed and stony stare. A fixed and stony stare at me! I think she knew me not, But shivered when I spoke, and seemed to shrink from me in dread; And but for that long shudder my unwelcome presence brought, I hardly could have known if she were living then or dead. O misery! to think the only sign of life should be A chill and shrinking quiver at the tender words I spake! What was it? what had done it? who will tell the truth to me? And now I thought my head would reel, and now my heart would break. But bit by bit, I gathered that she had gone out at noon To walk across the moor, and see the shepherd's sickly wife, And nurse her sickly babe a while, and sing a quiet tune To still its ceaseless wailing, for it had faint hold of life. And what she saw, or what she heard, or what had touched her wits, Our handmaid wist not—only, she came home so ghastly pale, And spoke not any word to her, but fell in swooning fits, And then sat with a stony look, or wailed a piteous wail. Just then I heard a trampling and a shuffling at the door, And men came in thereafter with heavy, clumsy tread, And laid a wet, lank burden there beside me on the floor, And every face that looked at me was ghastly as the dead. They had been going home, and turned to look at the old pine Thunder-blasted in the tempest, when they saw him lying there; Poor Luke! he was a godly man, and eloquent divine, And also shod the horses well, and acted just and fair! So clumsily they told the tale, lowspeaking, sad at heart, Losing a faithful friend in days of weary grief and care; And now the truth flashed on me as I looked, and saw a part Of his hard features through the fell of moist and matted hair. Scarce had he left my door, or but a score of paces gone, That evening, when a sudden fate had laid him with the tree, And Hilda, coming home, had seen the dead man lying lone Among the pools of water, with reproach of her and me. And that had driven her from her wits, and now she sat and stared, And shivered when I spake to her, and was distraught and wild; And as I held her hand, and prayed, I vowed, too, that I shared Her sorrow and her faith and hope, and would be as a child. Yea, I would be a child of God, if she would only look, I would believe whate'er she said, if she would only speak, I would not care for fame or power, for glory or for book, If she would only kiss me with the kiss that I did seek. A weary, woeful night it was, unbroken night to her, Through all the dismal hours, and oh the anguish unto me! But with the morning light, the day began to faintly stir With faint gleams of returning thought as lights upon the sea. But from that day we were estranged: she spoke no word of blame, Or only blamed herself, but she was silent and apart; We never spake about him, and we never named his name, But yet his shadow coldly lay between me and her heart. It was as if my fate had been to drive her God away, To part her from all emblems and helps of things Divine; And she must walk without me now along the narrow way, And she must make atonement for the guilt that had been mine. BOOK FIFTH REV. ELPHINSTONE BELL, PRIEST “Yea, the world is very evil, full of vanity and lies, But the Lord is very patient, and the Church is great in might, With her orders, her traditions, and her sacred mysteries She can cleanse your sins away, and turn the darkness into light. “She only has the seal of Power—the apostle's grand device, Handed down through all the ages in a long unbroken line, The glorious right to minister the bloodless sacrifice, And offer it for you in sacramental bread and wine. “Only her Priests may wear the robes befitting that great act When bread and wine become the body and blood of God's true Son, Only her prayers avail to realise the awful fact And put into your mouths the life that by His death was won. “What can your sects do for you? they may bring the child to birth, But the child is never born, and the mother's breasts are dry; So you pine away and perish, for their prayers are little worth Without the priestly unction, and the grace that comes thereby. “You build an ugly barn, which you call a Kirk, and then One preaches in Geneva gown to men predestinate, This to go down into the pit with all his virtues fair, And that with all his sins to pass to heaven with heart elate. “And this you call the grace of God, electing whom He will, And passing by the others in His absolute decree, And the ransomed sing the praises of that grace inscrutable, And your angels tune their harps to laud that monstrous sovereignty. “Little help such teaching brings to him that wrestles with the lies, The rogueries and vices that tarnish all our days; Therefore do we lift the banner of the Church that loudly cries To repentance of your errors, and the cleansing of your ways.” So preached the Preacher to us once; an Oxford scholar, young, With bare, thin face and sallow, bare and shallow too his mind; A narrow spirit, with a pulpit rhetoric high-strung, Something stale and commonplace, but very telling of its kind. Rounded periods, rarely natural—fit movements of the hand— Tones liquid, but monotonous—ejaculations oft To emphasise a commonplace—a manner gravely bland In private, but with women very winning, gracious, soft; These had won the hearts of many, gathered crowds into his pews, Though he had little light to give, and none at all to me; And weekly in the Kirk the pulpit thundered at his views, And at all who to the Woman, or the Beast might bow the knee. A pretty Church-revival now sprang up, with dainty hymns Artistically sung, and prayers with high intoning read, And holly-wreaths at Christmas about the cherubims That smiled with puffy cheeks beside the tablets of the dead. There were candles on the altar, there was incense in the air, A reredos, and a crucifix that towered up like a mast; And with forty minutes' singing, and forty minutes' prayer, And fifteen minutes' preaching, we were coming right at last. Then he needed a new organ, and we had a grand bazaar, And raffles winning money as you might at whist or pool; And a lady-volunteer who carried on a pretty war With a choir of surpliced children, badly trained at Sunday school. 'Twas not the simple worship of our homely Presbyters, Nor yet the stately worship of the custom Catholic, But a modern imitation, smacking of the milliner's; Brand-new devotions fashioned on the model of antique. To me it felt all hollow; but yet the youth had zeal, Played pastor very diligent, had he had aught to say, Spent days among the sick, and by the fevered bed would kneel, And patter o'er his little book, and hurry on his way. Hilda took to him amazingly, went to his daily prayers And school and district work, and now was rarely found at home; Quoted his tinsel pretty words, was full of church affairs, And when I jested at him was as crisp to me as foam. Day by day the church she haunted, quite forsook her parish kirk, Took to wearing dingy dresses, russet-brown or iron-grey, Fasted often, made her life a weary penitential work, With all its natural brightness now put carefully away. Scarce an hour but had its service of reading or of prayer, Scarce a day but was a saint's day, and her saints were very grim; They frowned at every pleasure, and they smiled at every care, And still she spoke to me of God, and giving all for Him. Keenly I felt that, all the more the priestling was obeyed, The lonelier life was growing, and we drifted more apart; We had not any words, but something on her spirit preyed, And ever-widening waters seemed to sunder heart from heart. He led her on a way divine which was not human too, And that, I wist, was not the way that Christ had walked of old; And common, homely duty now a daily burden grew, And common life was trifling, and all earthly love was cold. What was it? People told me he was verging toward Rome; But Roman or Genevan, mattered little unto me; God had His little children out at nurse in many a home, Who laid their Bible on His lap, or Cross upon His knee That could never work this mischief; all the churches had their popes; And I cared not for Pope Calvin more than Pius; as for beads And crucifix and censers and chasubles and copes, If she had a fancy for them, they were prettier things than creeds. What was it, then, that chilled her into forsty silence now, As days went dimly by, without the wintriest gleam of mirth To brighten up her wistful look, or clear the clouded brow? And wherefore did she sigh like one a-weary of the earth? For all the house grew silent, and her laugh was never heard, That wont to ring so cheery, and she sang but doleful hymns About the pilgrim's travail, and the comfort of His Word, And the home that is eternal, and the shining seraphims. I comprehend now better what it was that preyed on her As she brooded in her loneliness, and yearned for higher love; For her heart went upward, dreaming of that little visitor Whom God had taken from her arms into the heaven above. She thought we were not worthy to rear the child of God, Our home-air was too worldly for so pure a soul to breathe, And while she meekly bowed beneath the chastening of the rod, About the rod of sorrow she would twine a holy wreath. Ever her heart was longing for the life that is not here, And love that death can never touch with withering of its bloom, And for the tender blossom that she laid with awe and fear, Yet with absolute assurance, in its little grassy tomb. Upward her daily musings soared in wonder, hope, and awe, The heavenward meditations of a heart that found no rest, Save in thought-reflected vision of the glory where she saw The children with the Father folded in among the blest. All this I learnt long after, when I read the secret Book Of her solitary musing, blurred with many a tearful stain; I had thought her cold unto me when I saw her absent look, But her soul was longing for the lost that cometh not again. I also found the priest upon her tender scruples played, Eager to make a saint now of the mediæval kind, Inventing fresh atonements, as the restless heart betrayed Their failure in the cravings of the still remorseful mind. She was daily in his thoughts, and she was ever in his prayers; He watched her sickly thought with pride, and nursed the deep disease: Oh the honour to his work, the rich reward of all his cares, To have the training of a saint in evil days like these! But this I knew not at the time; and as I cast about For any likely reason this new sorrow to explain, And could not find it in my work, nor in my deepening doubt, There sprang up in my brooding heart a thought of bitter pain. For calling up the former days which happily had flown, I paused at Winnie Urquhart, with her talent and conceit; Hilda was jealous at the time, I saw it in her frown, And heard it in the tapping, on the carpet, of her feet. Was this the shadow on our life? and could her love expire In fumes of jealous anger, and in self-tormenting thought? Had she so little faith in me, and in the altar-fire Which I had tended like a charge that from the heavens I got? My heart had never wandered for a moment from its place; My faith had been unshaken, and unshadowed for an hour; But now a chill crept o'er my soul, a gloom came on my face, And my distrusted love became a deep distrustful power. And thus the strangeness grew—a silent gulf between us twain, A wan, still water, drifting us yet more and more apart: A life of wrested meanings, and of keen mistaken pain, While each, with wistful longing, wondered at the other's heart. Yet once I tried to draw her close again, for love is strong, And oh my love yearned for her love, and oh my heart was sore! But cold love is slow to warm again; and now the nights were long, Like a stretch of barren sand upon the day's unhappy shore. But one bright summer evening—all the sadder for its brightness— I sat in the green arbour looking to the sleepy town; Slumbrous-sweet syringa-blossoms hung about me in their whiteness, And the summer in its glory bore the burden of its crown. Sat the coney on its haunches 'mong the grey sand near its hole, Crouched the hare in the long furrow where the tenderest barley grew, And I bade the living creatures loving welcome in my soul, For life was not so lonely with them frisking in my view. A yellow bee was drumming in the foxglove, where it showed A spire of purple-spotted bells upon the sunny brae, And my heart went back a-dreaming far along the changeful road, Till thought passed into tears, and all the scene grew dim and grey. Oh, sad our withered hopes amid the flush of leaf and flower; Sad the winter of the spirit with the summer's wealth around; And the weird feeling came again upon me in that hour, That life was but a shadow flitting dimly on the ground. Shadowy joys, and shadowy sorrows! shadows all I felt and saw! The old sense of unreality came back on me again; I had dreamt, and I was waking, and the morning air was raw, Or perhaps I only dreamt that I was waking up to pain. There was a fate upon me, and it drove me on and on, And I must “dree my weird,” alas, whatever it might be; Yet was I but a shadow among shadows sitting lone, And waiting for the doom that moaned around me like the sea. Then Hilda came up softly, and softly sat her down; I knew that she was very pale, and very often sighed, Although I looked away from her unto the sleepy town Expecting that sure fate which from afar I had descried. 'Twas all as if I knew before the thing that was to be; 'Twould not have startled me to hear that I must die that night! Yet 'twas as if a shadow of no moment unto me, A fate and yet a dream—and very strange, yet very right. In silence and constraint we sat, a short while, side by side, While leaf by leaf she plucked the flower in pieces at her waist With thin and trembling hand; and with mechanic foot I traced Senseless scores upon the gravel, to be speedily effaced. “I would do right,” she said, “and yet I know not what to think, For things are not the same now as they used to be before; And from the cross appointed us we may not dare to shrink, Nor close the ear to Him who standeth knocking at the door.” I knew this was her woman's way of drawing near to me, A hint that, like a bud, a little sunshine would unfold,— A feeling out for any touch of answering sympathy, That all the burdened secret of her trouble might be told. And oh I should have let my heart flow freely out to hers, I should have met her longing, and mingled it with mine, I should have wooed her o'er again, pleading with all that stirs The woman and the human, till she felt it was divine. But I was never ready yet, was always wise too late; Right words come swiftly to my pen, but slowly to my lips; And there was that Greek-feeling of the coming on of Fate, Which dulled me with its shadow like the gloom of an eclipse. And under all there lay the petulant, brooding sense of wrong, That her jealous love distrusted mine, that trusted once for all, And had been true to her as is the music to the song That subtly links its movement unto every rise and fall. Then, something seemed to break in me. I thought I heard it snap, Like string of lute or viol, and I did not seem to care; There was no more to win or lose; my life had lost its sap, And shook but leafless branches creaking in the wintry air. I scarce know what I answered, but it had no touch of grace;— 'Twas something about making crosses where no cross was meant; The anguish and the deadness drove me into commonplace, And the commonplace fell on her like a heartless argument. And still I see the great blue eyes, strange-gleaming like a ghost, From out of her pale face, as she made answer with a moan; “At least, I shall not have to pay the price I dreaded most; God's love will break no human heart, unless it break my own.” She had brought to me her burden, and she brought it all in vain; O cursed conceit of being right which kills all noble feeling! A little word of kindness would have saved a load of pain, A little word of love had wrought a miracle of healing. She meant to tell me all her grief, and all her young heart's care, And all the fond atonements she was minded then to try; She meant to seek my counsel for the purpose that she bare On a scrupulous, troubled conscience that was sorely vexed thereby. And I,—I had not heard her; but with blankest commonplace Had turned away from eager eyes that pleaded as for life, Had spoken in tones of iron, with an unmoved iron face, And every word a cruel stab as with a cruel knife. Now both again were silent; then she sighed, and went away, And by and by I rose, and passed down to the moaning sea, Until the moon arose, and spread long tresses on the bay, And silent stars, with sad rebuke, seemed looking down on me. Next day, I watched her going, calm, about her household work, Putting everything in order, sorting all with bated breath, Desk and drawer, and banded letter; and her face was like a mask, While she put all in its place, as one prepares for coming death. I could not but remember how, when that hope made us glad, Which ended in a little grave in the dim land of peace, She, hoping not for motherhood, had tidied all she had, And writ out full directions for the time of her release. They say, the strange new life that throbs beneath a mother's heart Feels often liker death; I cannot tell; but when I came By chance, then, on the sorted drawers, and understood, in part, Their meaning, oh the anguish, and the fear, and sense of blame! And now again she hung above her boxes all the day, And went about the house, too, with a look premeditate, Silent, counting all the linens, putting things in drawers away, And by the less disorder making home more desolate. Books were gathered from the tables, and shelved in order due, Things that crowded on the mantelpiece were laid aside in drawers, Familiar old disorder now took shape as neat and new, And there was bundling of receipts, and labelling of jars. She wrote out for our maid some thoughtful counsel for the days When I should be alone, and where to find what I might need, And what my special likings were, and what my common ways, And ended with a prayer that Heaven might bless her in her deed. I knew not this till after; and I could not then divine The meaning of the order, and the look of rooms to let, The packed and sorted linens, neatly marked with numbers fine, And careful noting of accounts, and clearing of her debts. Only the days went by, as haunted by a coming Fate, That well I knew was closing on me, like the darkling night, Till reaching home one evening, I found no loving mate Fluttering around our little nest amid the waning light. Instead, there was a letter on the mantelpiece, that leant Against the marble clock—a blotted letter, sealed with black; I did not need to read it then, to find out what it meant, As I saw the tremulous letters, faintly scrawled upon the back. And yet it stunned me for a while; I held it in my hand, Staring at the superscription, though I wist not what I saw; I know I locked the door too; for my sorrow could not stand The gaze of the scared housemaid, half in pity, half in awe. Alone! my soul would be alone! it was a lonely lot That henceforth must be mine; but now I wanted solitude; Like wounded deer that leaves the herd for some secluded spot To die in, so I shut me in, and felt that it was good. I broke the seal, and read I knew not what, but all the night I paced in silent anguish up and down the silent room, Now longing that the darkness might never see the light, Now praying for the light to scare the horror of the gloom. I have it now, that letter—it is brown and tattered now, Often read, although its every word is burnt into my brain; And well where every falling tear had blotted it I know, And every blot is in my heart a scar and aching pain. THE LETTER Husband and Dearest, be not wroth with me, Because I leave you for a little while— Only a little—one day to return, A better wife, and make a brighter home, For therefore do I go, with breaking heart; And secretly, for it would break your heart To let me go; and yet I needs must go, That worse may not befall, and we, the more We rub together, be but more estranged. Often I thought to tell you all the thought That brooded in me. But you did not care To speak of what might grow into debate; And I was fearful, knowing you have much Upon your mind, and that it is not well To fret the current of your larger thought With small obstructions. What I mean is this: Indeed, I did not mean to hide from you My purpose, or to purpose anything Unworthy; for wherever I may be, My wifely heart goes with me, and the troth I vowed to you; and that you know right well. But things are no more as they were with us; Somehow the light has gone out from our life, And we, together living, live apart In joyless solitude. I blame you not, Except that your too tender cherishing Fostered my self-love, making much of me, Petting myself, and pitying myself Too much already. Mine alone the blame Of that dim separateness. For I was not The wife you needed, though I tried to be, And never woman's love was more than mine. I have not shared the burden of your thoughts, I have not understood you, nor forgot Myself in your high purpose; my small lamp That feebly glimmered, failed, of course, to light The two large chambers of your life. Perhaps, I never should have been a wedded wife; Perhaps it had been better had I died, When God took baby from us. I have been Foolish and fretful, selfish, useless; only I loved so absolute—that is my excuse. Had I but loved my God as well! But there, The more I strove that you should cleave to Him, The more I seemed to lose my hold of Him, And drifted as you drifted, helping not Your soul, and hurting mine own faith, as day Slipt after day, with ever dimmer sense Of things unseen in me, and harder thoughts In you, until I felt my darkening way Was darkening yours, and dropping into death, As we more alien grew in all our thoughts, In feeling more estranged, in ways more sundered, And God appeared the farther from us both. That is the bitter end of all my striving— Harm to my own soul, cruel hurt to thine! And yet I meant so well; only I tried A work beyond my power; except the Lord, Do build the house, the builder builds in vain. Bear with me; I am full of self-reproach, As well I may be, and I must atone For that so fruitless past, ere peace will come. I have shunned sorrow, comforting myself Till I have lost all comfort in myself; And now I must seek sorrow for a while, And wear the crown of thorns, and bear the cross. And find a new life in them. Do not try To hinder that on which my heart is set, Which will redeem my life from shallowness, And make its homely service, by and by, Truer and purer; both to thee more helpful, And happier to myself, forgetting self. A little while, and then I shall come back, Wiser by lessons gathered where the shades Of the Eternal fold around man's life, Saying, Be still, and know that I am God. A little while—and but a little while, Not long enough for either to forget, Yet long enough for you to look beyond, And find the fountain of a surer peace Than ever I could give. A little while. And we shall wed again, and make a home, Where Christ will dwell with us, as we recall This break of our young marriage. Farewell, now; 'Tis hard to write, and could not have been spoken; And yet it must be: farewell, my beloved. I have gone over all the house, and left Some tears in every room, and take with me Its picture in my heart. I think that all Is left in order; if there's aught forgotten, Forgive me, for my heart was very heavy. I know you'll not forget to plant fresh flowers Around the little grave. 'Tis nothing; yet, When I return I would not like to see Another picture than I bear with me. You cannot doubt the love I bear to you, You cannot doubt the grief that weeps for you, You cannot doubt the purpose that for you Would school my heart by earnest discipline; You cannot doubt me, even in leaving you A little while, and but a little while, For surely God will spare me unto you. As I read that blotted letter, with its love so fond and true, Again in the dim morning, I was stung with new regret; Why had I mooned away the night, when there was that to do Which still might heal our sorrow, and restore my darling yet? O misery! O misery! to have been rich indeed, And to have wasted all that wealth of love by cold distrust! And what were I without her, but a shivering, withered reed With the glad water at its roots all gone to summer dust? I did not wish a wiser wife—I only wanted her? How could she think I cared for bookish women or their praise? If she only saw my heart, and if she only felt the stir Of pain and shame and self-contempt I had for all my ways! I hurried to our priestling; I was sure he had to do With this fresh sorrow of my life; and I misjudged him not; He was fain to make atonement where atonement was not due, And manufactured crosses when Providence forgot. I found him high and haughty in a saintly kind of way, But he allowed that she had joined a pious sisterhood Who from a distant harbour would be sailing on that day, To nurse the wounded in the war, and do the dying good. I waited not for more; 'twas idle to dispute with him: He had the true ascetic heart that knows no tie, or care Of wife or child or kindred, and was fain to sing a hymn For “those in peril on the sea,” when I was fain to swear. O that journey to the seaport! O the thoughts that surged on me! O the reasons I would urge! the triumph I must surely win!— But the anchor had been weighed, the ship was dropping out to sea, And I only looked on crowded decks, and heard confusèd din. I saw the ship sway o'er the bar, I saw the hurrying crowd, And the sailors sang light-hearted, and the landsmen gave a shout; But song and shout were in my ear lamentings low or loud, And whether all were truth or dream, I could not well make out. I rushed along the granite mole that stretched far out to sea, Where angry waves were howling loud, like hungry beasts of prey; O cruel waves whose crashing drowned the cry that came from me! O mocking waves that heeded not, but bore my love away. The rain came down in plashes, gusty, sputtering in my face, And little, gushing runlets flowed down by me to the sea; I felt their chill, but recked not, and shivering for a space Sat on the dripping stones, and leant my face upon my knee. What followed then I cannot tell, I cannot tell how long— Sounds that made my blood to tingle, laughter mingled with long sighs; And now I was athirst, and now was choking in a throng, And ever one pale visage looked on me with yearning eyes. O God forgive us, Hilda; and God be good to thee! O my cold, distrustful silence, it was not the better part! And oh what would I give to bring my love back from the sea Whose billows, ever breaking on me, break my very heart. Where art thou? Where, my darling? the noise of war is stilled, The wounded sun them at the doors, or cripple through the street; I ask them of my darling, and they tell me who were killed, Of the soldiers in the trenches, or the sailors in the fleet. They tell me of the sisters, but they never speak of her; There was a Sister Bridget, whom they never name without Rubbing a sleeve across the eye, and talking of the stir, When they broke out of the trenches to assail the great Redoubt. I wait and ask, and wait in vain; she passed away from me; The last glimpse that I had was when the ship swayed o'er the bar; And all the hope of love went down into the stormy sea, And never tidings came from it, or from the storm of war. EPILOGUE A mighty city of tented streets, And never a house of brick or stone, And the pulse of the city throbs and beats As if in a fever burning on; Nothing but tents in all the plain, Nothing but bronzed and bearded men, With clashing sabre and jingling spur, Plume of feather, or crest of fur. Here are banners, and there are flags; All of their bravery now is stained; As the wind flutters their tattered rags, Lo! where the powder and blood are grained: And the heavy air has a fœtid breath: Is it of blood? or is it of death? How the wild dogs and the birds are fat, Gorged where they lazily perch or squat! Now, at a tent-door steeds are champing, Now they are galloping forth with speed; Down the long streets there are companies tramping, Grimly silent, on some fell deed; Some in the wine-shop are drinking hard, Some are gaming with dice and card; Many a jolly stave trowls from those, But these are coming to oaths and blows. Hark! to the call of the bugle horn, Or the quick rattle of mustering drum! Swift to the summons, at even or morn, Bronzed and bearded, the gallants come. Balls from the rifle-pits ping about, Great guns boom from the big Redoubt, And the angry hiss of the burning shell Screams through the fire and smoke of hell. Far on the outskirts stands a tent, And over the tent a great red Cross; Balls lie round, but their force was spent Long ere they rolled o'er the silent moss; A cross is over the silent gate, A cross on the arm of them that wait, Emblem of pity and healing and peace, Bidding the wrath of war here to cease. One comes out of it, grave and sad; Just a whisper, and then returns; What are the tidings now? good or bad? Still she lives, but the fever burns. Then again silence reigns all about, And the twilight pales, and a star comes out, But yet the air seems to pulse and to throb, Now and again, with a stifled sob. Sudden, the sob is turned to a wail; What is it? where is it? Hush! the door Opens again now, and all hearts fail;— He too is weeping, for all is o'er. It is not night, and it is not day; Calm in the twilight she passed away, Just as the star, where the cloud was riven, Pointed her way through the opening heaven. Near the tent-door was a sickly group, And oh the tears ran down their cheeks like rain; One said, “There is not a man in our troop But would have died just to save her a pain: I would have died for her; so would a score of us; Broken and maimed, she was worth many more of us; God help the poor fellows, now she is gone; She was like my mother when last I was down.” When it was told at the drinking bar, The flagon untasted was dashed on the board; Hushed was the chorus of glory and war— Others were trusted, but she was adored. No one shuffled the cards again, Rattled the dice now, or called a main. “Who's for the trenches? we must have it out; Now is the time, lads, to try the Redoubt.” Belted with hell-fire, and shrouded with smoke, Girdled with rifle-balls as with a wall, Yet with a yell from the trenches they broke, Plunging through rifle-balls, hell-fire, and all. 'Twas not for glory they stormed the Redoubt; 'Twas that the grief of their wild hearts must out. That was her monument; and they cried, “God and Saint Bridget!” as each man died. L'ENVOI I do but paint a picture, just to show How cracks the old crust of Faith beneath our feet, Partly by light from heaven and fervent heat, Partly by fierce upheaval from below. Here fissures deep are gashed; there but a rent Scores the shrunk surface, thirsting for fresh showers To water its dry herbs and drooping flowers; But everywhere is great bewilderment. God's ploughshare trenches well, nor will He wait, And see His fallow lying all unbroke, Because another's heifer takes the yoke, Nor is His furrow always clean and straight, But still He maketh ready for His sowing, And scatters with the sweep of unseen hand Fresh seed of life upon the fresh-turned land, And gathers cloud and sunshine for its growing. Oh, weep ye for the Home whose tottering wall The trembling heart with unfeigned anguish saw, And with untempered mortar daubed its flaw, Faith lacking Faith that God is over all. Weep, yet rejoice! for her unselfish deeds, Mightier than words, have bidden doubt away, And led him into light of better day, And Love, which is the soul of all the Creeds</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RABAN RABAN When first I knew him, Raban was already Verging on age, yet full of lusty life; With all his senses perfect to enjoy The fatness and the sweetness of the earth, And all its beauty; and with all his mind Perfect to do its work—to reason well, To play with graceful fancy, or mirthful jest That rushed from him, like spark from glowing steel, I' the clash of argument: and he could soar Still into realms of thought that touch the stars, And lie about the Eternal; and his heart Was very young, and nothing loved so much As the fresh hopes of noble-purposed youth Not yet desponding of a glorious world. Trim and erect, with locks of iron-grey, A large eye full of light, and features thin That grew with age in beauty; a manner brisk And breezy; ready of speech for sharp retort, Or flowing period; given to dainty humour, Where delicate touches of quaint character Flitted like smiles upon his words; he knew Affairs and books and men, and it was like Great music just to sit beside the fire, And hearken his discourse. One of a race, Often much slighted, often serving much, Who miss their aim in the first spring, and fall, A season, out of sight among the waste Of prodigal life; yet better so kept back In the young bud, than in the bloom of promise To be frost-bitten, for he found a way, And filled a larger space by having failed Than first success had given him. He had once Sought the Priest's office, well content to be The humble pastor of a humble flock Of shepherds 'mong green hills, or of dull hinds Whose thoughts are of the mixen or the calves Hard to lift Heavenward. But he was not made For the Priest's work, whose Sundays domineer The week with preaching, as he goes about Slow sermon-grinding till his thought is thin As the shrill fife, the while he makes his rounds, And hears the parish-gossip, and grows small With its small interests, only, now and then, Lit up by broader lights that shoot athwart From that dread door which opens for all men. Orthodox? Well; I think he had not any Cut-and-dry scheme—equation nicely framed With plus and minus quantities and powers, Subtracting or dividing human sins And sorrows of the Highest, till the end Brought out salvation neatly. Some-how he Could never work the problem out so clear, Having an Infinite quantity to deal with, That would not balance with a sum of littles, However multiplied. Therefore he had No handy formulas for faith, and shunned Familiar phrase of preaching, which he called Old pulpit-dust beat from the cushion when Thought is most lacking; also he would try Perilous flights, at times, into far realms Of fine imagination, where his flock Followed him only with their eyes, as one Watches a cloud soar up, and fade away Into the setting sun. And yet his faith Was true to the old Creeds he left behind, As the fresh art of a new age still holds All past achievement in its scheme of progress, And moves on the old lines. He kept their spirit; Only the framework, and the rigid joinings Clamped, as with iron, by much-hammered texts, He loosened; for he deemed the truth was there, But yet in forms too rounded to be true, And clothed as with an armour which grew not Though the man grew within, till what was meant For a defence brought weakness. Thus, at times, He seemed to assail their most secure beliefs, And sap the main foundation of their hopes, When he was merely setting free the soul Of Truth, on which they lived, and which he loved; Only they knew it not without the husk, Nor could they live on it without the straw, Which they were used to, while he would refine, And from all gross admixture purify, Till he could sip it like an odorous dew. So have I heard him tell that, by and by, No flock would eat his pasture; where he came They wandered off to sit beside the fire, Or saunter in the fields considering The lilies how they grew, or to rehearse Questions once learnt beside a mother's knee, And pray for the old gospel of their youth. “And they were right,” he said; “man cannot live Without his formulas—I was a fool! Your disembodied, unfamiliar thought, Like disembodied spirit, frightens him; Or he seems left, as naked in the cold And dark, amid the crash of breaking ice, And polar fogs wherein he sees no light, But the ice-glimmer everywhere. And yet 'Tis well for you to-day that I was left To play the fool; I think ye have more light That I lie in the shade; your life is larger That mine was straitened—freer through my bonds.” I found among his papers sundry traces Of that old time, when he was preaching faith Just as he learned it, day by day, and oft Erasing one day what he writ the last Upon their puzzled minds; a hint or two Of hope and failure, and some things he called “Crystallised sermon,” tied up with a string. So he forsook the priesthood, trying first Scholastic tasks, and in his leisure hours Penning brief essays, quaintly humorous, Or thoughtful with the flavour of a soul Fresh from the vision of a dewy world That still seemed very good: and people noted The promise in them of an unknown power. Ere long the breakfast table mirthful grew With an incisive and sarcastic wit That played about our cloudy politics With ridicule like reason; now and then Unfolding, too, new depths of social right, And hopes for men that staggered the dull brain Of rural squires believing in their game, And rural priests believing in their teinds, And burghers cushioned in old customs, good For people well-to-do, but quickened life And expectation in the poor oppressed. Soon this man grew, by writing and by speech, A power among us; unto some he seemed A Firebrand fain to set the world ablaze, Class against class, and all against the Faith Which anchored men to God by prophet-forms, Where prophet-vision was not: but to some He brought the hope of better days a-coming, And brighter future for their dismal life. But when I knew him, he had dropt his pen, And done his work, and took his well-earned leisure Cheerfully, as a man who had not lived In vain; but could look back upon a path Troubled with battle and turmoil, hope and fear, And frequent disappointment and defeat, Yet brightened, too, by trophies of success— By growth of right, of freedom, and of knowledge, And power to grow still more, wherein he had No little part. Now, round his restful years Honour and love were gathered; gratitude Grew out of service lightly once esteemed, But in its full achievement plainly seen To fruit with good for all. A happy lot Wisely to serve your day, and in the glow Of evening feel its calm steal over you, And see the people glad, and hear them speak Of the ill times you helped to better for them. I met him, first, when hunting for a book Among the stalls, where he was hunting too, Now his life's chiefest business, and its joy: And I, being fearful that he sought the same Rare volume, looked askance at him, and weighed My scanty purse with his, doubtful; till he Who knew book-hunting minds, and slender means, Saluted me, and we grew friends ere long, Having a common love of curious lore. Thus meeting, by and by, I found my way Into his home, which once had been made bright By a fair helpmate, and by joyous girls Lightsome as flowers: but it was lonely now, And silent, for they all had gone before Into the silent land. I found his rooms All lined with books, and littered too with books On chair and table and floor; pale-vellumed classics— Sound English calf, respectable—grey-paper German, soon dog-eared—French like buttercups— Aldine editions costly, beautiful— And many tiny Elzevirs—and Scotch Imprints at Capmahoun—tall copies scarce— Fair tomes emitted by the press beloved Of him who, praising Folly, smote the monk, And grinned out of his hood: books everywhere,— Folio and quarto, duodecimo,— Luxurious editions—titles quaint With curious woodcuts—travels, stories, poems; All precious rubbish that a Book-worm loves; And there I revelled—who so happy as I? What joyous hours we had there as he showed How this was precious for a curious blunder, That for an autograph, one for a comma Oddly misplaced, another for its margin, Its type, its title, or its colophon! Skilled in this lore, he yet laughed at his skill, And passed a thousand jests upon a taste So foolish, while he fondled some loved prize, Quarto or folio, like a babe beloved, And told the story of its search and capture, And how he brought it home like one who walked Among the stars, and sang for very joy. We grew fast friends, for all his friends were young, And that which linked him with the Past, his love Of ancient lore, was less than that which drew His heart to the opening Future; full of hope He hung about the dawn, like morning star, And watched the coming day; not fearing greatly, Although he saw the germs of larger change, And deeper movements in the thoughts of man Wrestling for birth, than centuries had known. But falling sick, at length, he slowly sank Beneath a wasting ill that broke his strength, Yet not his spirit, for he still was gay, And grimly jested at his racking cough, Made merry with his bones that fleshless grew, Cheating the worms, he said; and under all Lay a great calm of Faith and surest Hope. One evening, sitting lonely by the fire A letter came to me, black-bordered, sealed With skull and cross-bones, yet his writing plain, I opened it in fear, and there I read THE LETTER I begged hard for an hour of grace From that grim ferryman who plies His wherry to the fore-doomed place Of all the foolish, and all the wise. But not an hour the churl will give, Nor deigns to answer me, though I, Who always was in haste to live, Would rather take my time to die. Another sun, and I shall know The secret Death has kept so well: What wonders in a day or so A letter writ by me could tell! And yet who knows? I've mostly found That secrets are but sorry stuff; And those that lie beneath the ground Perchance are commonplace enough. I've lived my life; it has not been What once I hoped, nor what I feared; And why should that we have not seen Be other than has yet appeared? There are no breaks in God's large plan, But simple growth from less to more; And each to-morrow brings to man But what lay in the day before. The river has its cataract, And yet the waters down below Soon gather from the foam, compact, And on like those above it flow: And so the new life may begin Where this one stopt, with finer powers, Perhaps, a subtler thread to spin, And years to work instead of hours. What has my life been that my heart Should be so tranquil at this time, So free to ply the careless art Of guessing, and of tagging rhyme? Here on this solemn brink of doom I seem not much to fear or care, But peer into the gathering gloom, And mostly wonder what is there. And that has been my bane all through That never yet would life appear So real that my hand must do Its work with earnestness and fear: Still I could dream and speculate, And turn it somehow into play, And nothing woke a perfect hate, Or love that had its perfect way. I tried the highest life—and failed; A lower, with a small success; I loved; I sorrowed; laughed and railed At fortune and her fickleness; And powers I might have trained to grow I frittered, for I was not wise; And now their fire is burning low, Their smoke is bitter in the eyes. Ah! wasted gifts and trifling gains! Ah! life that by the abysses played, And partly knew the griefs and pains That from the depths their moaning made, And partly felt them too, and yet Could be content to dream and write, Or in old story to forget, And never wrought with all my might! You'll find, in an odd drawer, the sum Of that life, rich in nought but friends— A grasshopper's dry-throated hum, A hank of broken odds and ends; Do with it as you will; I give My all to you; perchance it may Beacon another soul to live More wisely through its changeful day. You'll pay my debts—they are notlarge; You'll bury me where the poor folk sleep; And for the rest, my only charge Is that the dear old books you'll keep. If ghosts come back, mine will be met Upon the steps among the shelves, Searching for mildew, moth, or wet In the small quartos or the twelves. And now farewell, my lad; fear God, And keep your faith whole, if you can. And where the devil has smoothed your road, Keep to the right like an honest man; See that your heart is pure and just, See that your way is clean and true; By and by we shall all be dust, Yet by and by I shall meet with you. The world is losing faith in God, And thereby losing faith in man, For now the earthworm and the sod Wind up, they say, our little span; But they that hold by the Divine, Clasp too the Human in their faith, And with immortal hopes entwine The silence and the gloom of death. I read, and, hastening to his house, I found 'Twas even as he said. In his last hours He wrote, and gave strict orders not to send The letter till his final breath was drawn, And now he lay there mystic, beautiful. Never, in all those years, had I once dreamed That he, in secret, plied the Poet's art. He flaunted in the face the hardest facts, Brought reasons by the score, had strokes of wit When reasons failed, and bubbled o'er with fun; But never passing word, or tremulous tone, Hinted of Love's sweet sorrow, or of song, Long brooding o'er the tragic bliss o' the heart; Till now I found these lyrics scattered, most, Loose in a drawer, and cast them into shape As I could trace the thread: and gathered up The broken fragments with the care of love, That nothing should be lost of a true life. For he that truly lives, and clearly sees The truth wrapt in his life, and can set forth, Amid the trivial and the commonplace, The soul of truth for which he dared to live, Leaves to the world a nobler legacy Than wealth of hoarded gold, in that he kindles Lights on the dim, uncertain way we go. PRELUDES DREAMING I dream beside that silent sea Which yet has mystic voices low That whisper potent words to me From the dim, haunted long ago; And as the waves, with measured beat, Drift up the slow wrack to my feet, Faces gaze from it, sad and sweet. So come they, as the stars appear Even while you gaze on the blank night; For ere you wis, lo! far and near The dusk is all agleam with light; A mighty host, uncalled, they come, And without sound of trump or drum, But yet their silence is not dumb. They speak to me of hopes and fears That yet can make my bosom thrill, As o'er the weary waste of years The dead hands reach, and touch me still: For that old Past still lives to me; Its phantom faces still I see More life-like than the living be. WORK AND SPIRIT Is it the work that makes life great and true? Or the true soul that, working as it can, Does faithfully the task it has to do, And keepeth faith alike with God and man? Ah! well; the work is something; the same gold Or brass is fashioned now into a coin, Now into fairest chalice that shall hold To panting lips the sacramental wine: Here the same marble forms a cattletrough For brutes by the wayside to quench their thirst, And there a god emerges from the rough Unshapely block—yet they were twins at first. One pool of metal in the melting pot A sordid, or a sacred thought inspires; And of twin marbles from the quarry brought One serves the earth, one glows with altar-fires. There's something in high purpose of the soul To do the highest service to its kind; There's something in the art that can unroll Secrets of beauty shaping in the mind. Yet he who takes the lower room, and tries To make his cattle-trough with honest heart, And could not frame the god with gleaming eyes, As nobly plays the more ignoble part. And maybe, as the higher light breaks in And shows the meaner task he has to do, He is the greater that he strives to win Only the praise of being just and true. For who can do no thing of sovran worth Which men shall praise, a higher task may find, Plodding his dull round on the common earth, But conquering envies rising in the mind. And God works in the little as the great A perfect work, and glorious over all— Or in the stars that choir with joy elate, Or in the lichen spreading on the wall. CONSTRAINT I would not that another eye should see What I now write, or other ear should hear. Then wherefore do I write it, being clear To me, unwrit? and oh the pain to me! I hide my heart, and yet unbare it here, Then hide what I have writ, and mean to burn; I gather life's grey ashes in an urn, And brood o'er them with many a dropping tear, Dreading to keep, yet shrinking to destroy The treasured relics. O my Love! my bliss! Is it all ashes now, that infinite joy? Leaving no other joy to me but this, That I must open the old wound, and take This blood from it, or else my heart will break. THE HOUSE IN THE SQUARE THE HOUSE O the House in the Square! dear House in the Square! With the little grass-plots, and the mouldy green tubs Where the hoops fell away from the pale-flowering shrubs; But the widow was kind, and her daughters were fair, And all the day long there was sunshine there, In the House in the Square. A poor scholar's widow who still had her share Of life's vexing troubles, how kindly she took To our thoughtful life busy with lecture and book! And with motherly heart she would sweeten our care O'er the mild cup of tea, and the homely fare Of the House in the Square. To her all the way of our life we laid bare Its hopes and its fears, and she made them her own, And soothed us, or cheered us, as one who had known The outlets that open in depths of despair; And we all came away with a light-somer air From the House in the Square. The widow was kind; but her daughters were rare, Bright girls—our Muriel, Myra, and Loo: Nimble their fingers, their wits nimble too, And like sunbeams and singing of birds, unaware Of the brightness they brought, they would trip up the stair Of the House in the Square. Never maidens more frank, never maidens more fair, Never maidens were simpler or truer than they; They could think as we thought, yet their hearts were as gay As the feather-head fribbles that simper and stare, When you speak as we spoke all the long evenings there At the House in the Square. There our Logic we aired, splitting many a hair; And the quick-witted girls, skilled in mellow-toned Greek, Reading just what we read, of their Plato would speak, Or they sang an old song, or they played a blithe air, When discussion grew hot about any affair In the House in the Square. Their father, a scholar, would have them beware How they squandered their lives on the shallow and sweet; They should know what men knew, to be helps to them meet; And the learning he loved he was eager to share With the daughters he loved, until death found him there At the House in the Square. We were all of us poor; but we did not much care, For we sought the best riches of wisdom and truth With the courage of faith, and the ardour of youth; And with Homer and Shakespeare for friends, we could bear The dust of the carriage that passed with a stare At the House in the Square. How it haunts me, that home with its scholarly air! Those brave, gentle souls 'mid the city's turmoil, All so earnest in thought, and so patient in toil, And so true to the right, and so patient to bear! Ah! would I were now as I wont to be there At the House in the Square! MURIEL Whoever looked at Muriel, said: That girl has soul, her heart is high, And she has great thoughts in her head, And scorn of meanness in her eye; How sweetly gracious she can smile! Yet she looks haughty all the while, And beams on you in the goddess style. Whoever spoke to Muriel, thought: Her looks are nothing to her speech; That girl a noble strain has got, And soars beyond the common reach; Yet with her high and daring mood, And with her faith in human good, Will she be ever understood? Was it Mary Stuart, or Joan of Arc, Or Charlotte Corday that lived in her? Did she bewitch with glances dark, Or make your noblest pulses stir? Shall he who seeks her love to win, Ere he gather its harvest in, Be great in spirit, or great in sin? A fair enigma! Low-browed, small, Yet walking in her queenly grace, You would have vowed her stately, tall, Like Dian coming from the chase, With bow unstrung, and flushed with pride, The quivered arrows by her side, Every tip with crimson dyed. Was she a flirt whose roving eyes Entangled hearts with cunning wiles? Or was she maiden without disguise, Bright with sunny and artless smiles? What was the subtle charm that wrought, So that, hopeful or hoping nought, Still to win her love men sought? And when she spoke in homeliest strain, What was the spell that held them fast? And when she smote their hearts with pain, What was the glamour o'er them cast, That she had but to smile anew, And close to her again they drew Holding her all that is good and true? Still in extremes of good or ill, She seemed to play a fateful part; Some felt it bliss to do her will, Some found in it an aching heart; But let them joy or let them ache, The task she set them they would make Their chiefest business for her sake. She did not wonder at her lot, But, all unconscious, held her way, Nor cared for incense that she got, Nor heeded what the world might say: Unwittingly her spells she wove, And proudly lived apart, above All the surmise of hate or love. A beautiful enigma she, Our Muriel, with the dark bright eyes! And still her beauty seemed to be Flashed on you with a fresh surprise: And when they left her, men would look As if inspired by some great Book That did their meaner soul rebuke. LOO Loo, Loo! rather handsome than pretty, Deft at a pudding, or stocking, or ditty, Quick at a riddle, and keen in retort; Knitting her brows now o'er polyglot learning, Then toiling hard at her sewing and darning, Brimful of life, or at work or in sport. Loo, Loo! where on earth can she be? A Frau they tell me in Germany, Seeing to Saur Kraut, plump and fair: Now in the store-room, now at the dresser, Kitchen-maid, waiting-maid to her Professor, Just as she was at the House in the Square. Loo, Loo! she will toil at his Greek, Help his prelections, and fittingly speak To scholars of Homer, to Burschen of beer, Will search out in Plato the reference-passage, And see to the Calf's-flesh, the cabbage and sausage, And the pipe and the mug and the old household gear. Loo, Loo! she can sew, she can spin, Can boil, stew and fry, see to flagon and binn, Read the “Birds” and the “Clouds” with fine sense of the fun, Grasp Aeschylus' thought of the Fates, and the Human That softly gleams out in Euripides' Woman, Then seek the Beer-garden, and knit in the sun. Loo, Loo! what will she not do For a husband she loves, ever faithful and true? Is he off to the Sanskrit? she'll study the Veds: And Babylon's stone-books and arrow-head letters, Oh, she'll find the trick of them as soon as her betters, And then turn to making shirt-collars or beds. Loo, Loo! it was always her way; She said men were failures, and had had their day, But women were versatile, nimble as air, Fit for the humblest tasks, fit for the highest, Pouring life-blood into themes that were driest.— Happy Professor, put under her care! MYRA She was the fairest of all the three; Yet not at first she caught the eye, For in her maiden meekness she Wooed shadow like the primrose shy, And seventeen summers hardly brought Her lissom form to perfect grace, And the great purple eyes still shot Too large a light on the oval face; Yet she was fairest of all the three, E'en were she nothing at all to me. She was the wisest of them, though Not so nimble and deft of wit; But her heart thought, and made her know What for the loving heart was fit; And when you touched on higher chords, With eager eyes and parted lips, You caught her listening to your words, Quick with mind to the finger-tips: For she was wisest of all the three, Had she been nothing at all to me. She was the sweetest of them—sweet As summer air from clover field; And had a charity complete, A touch, too, and a word that healed, And therewith, oh so blithe a heart! That she would laugh as birds must sing, But could not play a bitter part That she might say a clever thing. Wisest, sweetest, fairest she, E'en were she nothing at all to me. And she was all the world to me; I loved her though she knew it not, And she loved, though I did not see She gave me back the love I sought; We loved, and yet we never wist Till many years had come and gone; We never spoke it, never kissed, But loved in silence and alone. Fairest, dearest of all the three, Oh, she was all the world to me. LOVE Oh, what is this that in my heart is singing, Like sweet bird, caged there, carolling all day? Oh, what is this such gladness to me bringing That life is bliss, and work is merry play, And round my steps, lo! sunny flowers are springing As I go singing, singing on my way? O Love, glad Love! Ah! what is this that in my heart is sighing, Like captive vainly moaning to be free? Ah! what is this so heavy in me lying? No rest there is, nor any work for me, And leaf and flower are drooping now and dying As I go sighing, sighing wearily? O Love, sad Love! What thing is this my foolish heart is dreaming, That I should love, and long for yon bright star? I sigh or sing, but she, unmoved, is gleaming As in high glory where the angels are— I but a glow-worm on the earth dull-beaming, While she is gleaming, gleaming there afar. O Love, vain Love! SPEECHLESS O thou fire-edged cloudlet Brimming o'er with light! Like my heart thou hangest 'Twixt the day and night. Silently thou hangest, Seemingly at rest, Yet there is strange tumult Boiling in thy breast. O my heart o'er-brimming With burning thought of her, Could'st thou only speak it, How her heart must stir! But my love is surging, Like the hurrying wave Breaking on the silence Of the dripping cave; Breaking on the silence Of the tangled shelf, And falling back in foam-bells Still upon itself. THE LICENTIATE DILL'S LODGINGS I see the little dingy street, The little room three stories high, The little woman, clean and neat, With kindly smile, and kindling eye, The paper chintz, the staring prints, The bird whose carol would not cease, And the cracked china ornaments Ranged stiffly on the mantelpiece. A dingy street among the poor, Thronging with children day and night, With sluttish women at every door Gossiping in the waning light: Yet oh the nights I there have seen! The humour kindling every face, The play of wit, the logic keen That glorified the homely place! Simple our life, with little change, And yet it was a bright romance, Fresh with the wonderful and strange Of youth's enchanted golden trance; How fresh in powers, in faiths, in thoughts! How full that fertile time appears!— We jotted down in pregnant notes The sum of all the after years. The scholar's aim we held aloft, The fearless search for what is true, As fresh discoveries called us oft Old schemes of Nature to review, And to adjust the thought and fact, And to make room for growth yet more, And to believe that God may act In ways we had not dreamed before. We had our passing hours of doubt, But did not nurse the shadowy throng, For we had work to go about That would not hold with doubting long. And looking back on those brave years, Unspotted by the world and free, Meagre and poor to-day appears, When earth is so much more to me. CONFIDENCE Strange, that for all the wrecks upon the shore, And all that, helpless, drift about the sea, We never dream that such our fate may be, Or shrink from life that may be one wreck more! But fresh hope comes to each fresh soul, as light Dawns on the waters, dimpling in their waves, With running laughter tripping o'er the graves Where former hopes lie buried out of sight. And we are sure, and eager for the race, And crowd all sail, and deem not for an hour That life is not worth living, or that power Is not in us to master time and space. Is it that Nature, with a wanton's smile, Allures, but to delude, and break our hearts, Or worse than break them, when the soul departs Of nobleness, that dwelt in us erewhile? Or does she seem to us what we desire, Though herself true, and hating all deceit, And all we hear is but our own heart's beat, And all we see but what our dreams inspire? SCATTERED Scattered to East and West and North, Some with the faint heart, some the stout, Each to the battle of life went forth, And all alone we must fight it out. We had been gathered from cot and grange, From the moorland farm, and the terraced street, Brought together by chances strange, And knit together by friendships sweet. Not in the sunshine, not in the rain, Not in the night of the stars untold, Shall we ever all meet again, Or be as we were in the days of old. But as ships cross, and more cheerily go Having changed tidings upon the sea, So I am richer by them, I know, And they are not poorer, I trust, by me. WAITING Wearily drag the lagging hours To him who, waiting to be hired, Is by enforcèd idlesse tired More than by strain of all his powers: Wearily, having in his heart The hope to play a worthy part, And scorning each ignoble art. Girt for the fight, he waits forlorn, And oh! it irks him sore to rest, And watch, too oft with mocking jest, Things done that fill his soul with scorn, As he with folded hands must sit, While lesser men, with scanty wit, Get all the work, and tangle it. So life grows bitter; or perhaps Hope flirts a moment in his face, Then trips off to another place, And pours its treasures in the laps Of some dull soul, whose easy feet Will tread the old familiar beat, Contented getting much to eat. And lo! the work remains undone, And work is what he hungers for, But cannot find an open door, And loiters idly in the sun, Still waiting with his heart on fire, And wasting with his great desire, Waiting and finding none to hire. A WISH Just a path that is sure, Thorny or not, And a heart honest and pure, Keeping the path that is sure, That be my lot: Life is no merry-making, Hark! how the waves are breaking! Just plain duty to know, Irksome or not, And truer and better to grow In doing the duty I know, That I have sought: Life is no merry-making, How the stiff pine trees are quaking! Just to keep battling on, Weary or not, Sure of the Right alone, As I keep battling on, True to my thought: Life is no merry-making, Ah! how men's hearts are breaking! SELF-CONTEMPT I bear a message to the sons of men, Faithful and true, And it should drop on earth like tender rain, But yet I bear my message all in vain, For let me do Whate'er I may, and plead howe'er I can, I touch no heart of man. How should I? Though I bear a message true, The thing I want Is, room for me to live, and work to do; And so I go about to places new With patience scant, And tell my tale, and then go on my way, And life grows dull and grey. And I am full of self-contempt and scorn To go about Thus, falsely speaking truth to hearts forlorn, And jibe myself that I, some ugly morn, Shall be found out To be no prophet whom the Lord hath sent, Or for His service meant. But is my message true? To-day, I seem Full of the lights That from the bleeding Christ so grandly stream; And lo! to-morrow, it is like a dream Of restless nights: And I have drifted back into the shade, Unsaying what I said. I seek a gospel which I should have found Before I tried To preach, with unfixed heart, the faith profound Which tells the captive that he is unbound By Him who died To ope his prison door, and set him free From all his misery. O heart that would be true! O hard estate, To falset bound! This only comfort is there in my fate; My message I did ne'er prevaricate With tinkling sound To tickle ears, nor played with showy trick Of tinsel rhetoric. I've mocked myself, and laughed with bitter jest At much I saw; But yet I kept a true heart in my breast, Nor turned, in all my trouble and unrest, From the high law Of present duty; and my peace is great Even in this hard estate. HOPE A little Kirk, beneath a steep green hill, With a grey spire that peeps o'er tall elm-trees, In a still, pastoral land of brook and rill, And broomy knoll, and sleepy, dripping mill, Far from the stir of cities and of seas: And near the Kirk, low nestling in the copse, With honeysuckle clad, and roses red, A little Manse, whose sweet-flowered garden slopes Down to the river where the river drops, With murmuring ripple, o'er a pebbly bed. How happily the days and years might flow Among the silent shepherds brooding long, In pious labour, studious to know, And patient service, till their life should grow From thoughtful silence into thoughtful song; To pass from house to house in visit free, Welcome as sunshine at the smoking hearth, To take the little children on the knee, And bless them, as He did in Galilee Who came with blessing unto all the earth; To speak to them of Duty and of God, And of the Love that clasped the bitter Cross, And of the health and comfort of His rod, And go before them on the way He trod, Who found Life's glory and fulness in its loss; To share in all the joys and griefs they have, To bless the bridal, not else thought complete, To stand beside the cradle and the grave, And tell them how the meek and true and brave Turn graves to cradles where the sleep is sweet. O happy lot! with one, to brighten life, Smiling soft-eyed beside the evening fire, Sharing the sorrow, sweetening all the strife, And leaning on her lord, a loving wife, And cherished by her lord with fond desire. Dream of the golden morning of the day! Dream of the night beneath the folding star! Dream of the hungry heart that in me lay! Dream by the river rippling soft away Into the tremulous moonshine—which dreams are. THE BROOK AND THE RIVER A stream from the heath-purpled mountain Comes, with a gush, From the star-moss round its fountain, Breaking the hush Of the silent, songless mountain. Pewit-and-curlew-haunted, Foaming, it flows There where the wild deer undaunted Bells, as it goes Pewit-and-curlew-haunted. It plays with the rowan and bracken And grey lichened stone, But never its pace will it slacken, Still hurrying on, Though it plays with the rowan and bracken. A river winds 'neath the shadows Of pine-wood and oak, And hums to the bee-humming meadows, And the white flock That bleats from the mists and the shadows. Down to the still river hastens The swift-flowing stream, And aye as the distance it lessens Its bright waters gleam, And it leaps and sparkles and hastens Till in the calm-flowing river Softly it sinks, And hears not and heeds not for ever What fern or tree thinks, But only the low-whispering river. O love! my river full-flowing, Wait, wait for me; O love! my love, ever-growing, Hastens to thee For rest in thy river calm-flowing. FAILURE I see the Kirk beneath the hill, The tall elms rustling in the breeze, The modest Manse, so calm and still, The dripping of the sleepy mill That hides among the nutting trees. I look down, with a hungry heart, On the broad river rippling cool; The fisher plies his patient art, The trout leaps, and the May flies dart About the slowly eddying pool. Low sunbeams on the meadows play, The moon shows like a film of cloud, A star from the red skirts of day Peeps to another star far away, And the hill is wrapt in a misty shroud. A shepherd's wife comes to the door, Shading her eyes with large brown hand, He is away on the upland moor, And nothing she sees but a kestrel soar, Keen-eyed, spying far over the land. There is no voice but the rushing rills, And creak of frightened pewit's wing, And bleat of young lambs on the hills, Heard only when a silence fills The soul, and all the space of things. What made my eyes grow dim and blind?— Ah, when the heart is heavy and low, The beauty that on earth we find, Or strain of music on the wind, Shall touch it like an utter woe! SUBMISSION I will remember it for aye, Though there I was forgotten soon; It haunts me in the sunny day, And under stars and moon. It was the only hope I had That unto near fulfilment grew; A while it made me very glad; A while it made me very sad; And then I knew 'Twas but another thread He wove In the mixed web of Father-love. MORALISING Roses fair on thorns do grow; And they tell me, even so Sorrows into virtues grow: Heigh-ho! It was a stroke Brought the stream from the flinty rock. Frosty winter kills out weeds; And they tell me, evil seeds Die out in the heart that bleeds: Heigh-ho! And some have faith That dying is the death of Death. Ah! the loss may yet be gain, Bitter bliss may spring from pain, As the bird-songs after rain: Heigh-ho! But nought shall be Ever again the same to me. CRYSTALLISED SERMONS NOTE He had no written sermons, only took Brief jottings upon any scrap of paper— Bits of old letters, envelopes, or labels— And there the thought was scrawled, but half the matter Was illustration roughly etched, a kind Of hieroglyph whereof he had the key, Now lost for ever: etchings strongly drawn, With a clear eye for form, and touched with humour Or pathos; so he penned his similes. But certain thoughts that took his fancy more, And, as I guess, had troubled hearers more, These he had gathered up, and put in verse, As sermon-matter crystallised, once spoken In amplitude of phrase, but now compact; Not to be preached, but crooned in quiet hours Of musing by the fire. Poor sermons truly For common folk with common thoughts and sins And sorrows, and no reaching out of hope To find a larger faith in Charity; Yet notable for a Licentiate Starting, on Saturdays, with little valise And threadbare garments, for some homely kirk Among the hills, or on the village green, Whither he went, and fired his aimless shot, Then passed away again, and was forgot. SACRIFICE “And there he builded an altar unto the Lord that appeared unto him.”—Gen. xii. 7. Is there Bridge-maker who can throw An arch across the gulf of years, That we may travel back, and know The brooding thoughts, and haunting fears, And clinging faiths of them who raised Their altars 'neath the evening star, And offered to the gods, and priased, And drave the dogs and birds afar? Vainly, I seek to know his mind Who smote the lamb with gleaming knife, And sprinkled blood, and hoped to find The peace of a diviner life. Far off he seems, I cannot tell Whether beneath me, or above, Or compassed round with shades of hell, Or trembling in the bliss of love! I gaze back from the brink of time On shadowy forms of early days, That in the morning, loom sublime, God-guided on untravelled ways; But o'er the vague, vast chasm that parts Their thought from mine I cannot go; I wot not how their troubled hearts Were calmed by making blood to flow. Yet once wherever man had trod, Or sin had grown from base desire, He built an altar to his god, And laid the faggot on the fire, And brought the choicest of the flock From frolic by its bleating dam, And laid upon the unhewn rock The tender kid, or spotless lamb. The knife into its throat was driven, The blood was sprinkled on the stone, The smell of fat went up to heaven, That on the leaping flame was thrown; And he before his god was glad, And prayed, and sang his evening hymn, And laid him down to sleep, and had Bright dreams until the stars grew dim. Thus did the Hebrew on the plain Of Moreh, while Heaven, many-eyed, Unweeping, saw the throbbing pain, Or smiled even as the victim died, And smelled a sweeter smell from blood, He wist, than from the myriad flowers That breathed, from shining bell and bud, Their incense through the dewy hours. The subtle-witted Greek with art Was fain the anguish to adorn, And singing with a sprightly heart, Led the young kid with sprouting horn, Flower-garlanded, into the grove, And there by crystal fount or brook, Into the life of Nature wove The slender thread of life he took. The Norseman slew the mighty steed That bore him in the battle fray, And ate the flesh, and drank the mead, And feasted Hella-thoughts away, And piled the logs upon the hearth, And called the gods, in stormy words, To send the hungry ravens forth To fatten at the feast of swords. Yet darker rites were theirs who kissed Their hand unto the placid moon; Or who the Tyrian Moloch wist To pacify with choicest boon Of babe or maid; or where the Priest Stood grim beneath the Druid oak; Or Aztec fed with ample feast The captives for the fateful rock. What was it entered thus the soul, To give it calm, or promise bliss? Strange that the ages, as they roll, Have dropped behind a thought like this, Which held the universal mind Of all the world when it was young! For now the key I cannot find In all that men have said or sung. In mocking scorn, the Prophet laughed Loud at a hungering, thirsting God Who craved the flesh of bulls, or quaffed The reeking blood that died the sod, For every beast is His, and all The cattle with their clover-breath, And Love, that quickened great and small, Can feel no pleasure in their death. They say the Giver of all life Is fain to take the life He gives, And will not spare, unless the knife May gash some other thing that lives; And they are sure, and they are clear, While I in dizzying darkness grope, But trust that God will yet appear In star-gleams of a nobler hope. I would not heed, though that old Faith Had spread its roots o'er all the earth, If they were withered now in death As having no abiding worth: But from those roots still branches spring That shape our thoughts of truth and right, And still of Sacrifice we sing, And blood that maketh clean and white. There was some passion, fear, or guilt That emphasised expression thus, As by a mighty oath, and felt A peace it cannot give to us. But what? Was it the soul's consent To die for sin that it had done? Nay; man's strong life was not yet spent On threads by morbid conscience spun. I know the anguish that is wrought Into the web of highest bliss; I know the Cross must be his lot Who thrills with Love's redeeming kiss. But when the Lamb or Bullock fell 'Neath the keen blade, or shattering blow, How that could make the sick heart well, Or nearer God—I do not know. And yet the Lamb of God was slain Or ere the age of sin began, And wrapt in that prophetic pain Is all the history of man; And all the fulness of his life, And all the greatness of his thought, And all the peace of his long strife Root in that Everlasting Ought. THE STANDING STONES “God at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers.”—Heb. i. I. A rolling upland, open and bare, A blasted heath where the night wind moans, Eerie and weird, to the curlews there, And the greedy kite and the kestrel scare Singing birds from the lightsome air. High on the heath are the Standing Stones, Great, gaunt stones in a mystic ring, Girdling a barrow where heroes' bones Crumble to dust of death that owns Them and their wars and faiths and thrones. Not far off is an oozy spring Feeding a black and dismal pool; There slow efts crawl, horse-leeches cling, And the dragon-fly whirs on restless wing, And near by the adder is coiled in the ling; And once an oak made a shadow cool, Woven of its green boughs overhead, And blithe birds sang in the leafage full; Now but a raven, bird of dule, Croaks on its stump from May to Yule. But silently watching the silent dead Stands the grey circle of sentinels, Scarred and lichened, as ages sped With snows, and dripping rains over-head, And suns, and the wasteful life they bred. Now, evermore where the dead man dwells The living have gone to seek for God, And the Altar-fire of the Unseen tells, Or the swing and the clash of Christian bells Summon to Lauds and Canticles. And there, of old, in that bleak abode Of wily lapwing and shrill curlew, To circle and cairn they carried their load Of burdened thought, as they wearily trod On to the brink where they lost the road. There dipped the Sun in the dripping dew His earliest beams; and there he met The Bel-fire kindling its answer true— Light for the light in heaven that grew, Worship-light to the Light-god due. So men acknowledged, and paid their debt, In the old days, to the powers above, Giving back that they were fain to get, And piling the faggots, dry or wet, Still as the keen stars rose and set. Was not the instinct true that wove Fire-worship thus for the god of fire? Give from below what ye get from above, Light for the heaven-light, Love for its Love, A holy soul for the Holy Dove. God tunes for Himself the hallowed lyre That shall truly His praises show; He gives the song that He will desire, Ever new from the trembling wire, Ever new from the heart on fire. Back to its fountain let it flow Whatsoever He sends to you; Mercy, if mercy of His ye know, And if your joy He has made to grow, Up to Him let its gladness go. So in all faiths there is something true, Even when bowing to stock or stone— Something that keeps the Unseen in view Beyond the stars, and beyond the blue, And notes His gifts with the worship due. For where the spirit of man has gone A-groping after the Spirit divine, Somewhere or other it touches the Throne, And sees a light that is seen by none, But who seek Him that is sitting thereon. Seek but provision of bread and wine, High-ceiled houses, and heaps of gold, Fools to flatter, and raiment fine, All the wealth of the sea and mine— And nothing of God shall e'er be thine. But who seeks Him, in the dark and cold, With heart that elsewhere finds no rest, Some fringe of the skirts of God shall hold, Though round his spirit the mists may fold, With eerie shadows, and fears untold. THE ANCIENT CROSS “God at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers.”—Heb. i. I. There is a long, green spit of land That juts into a loch; the sea Not far off thuds upon the sand, Or crashes where the red rocks be; But here the peace is very great, Small brooklets murmur as they list, And, green with oft-enfolding mist, The hills stand round in quiet state. The lady-birch, with drooping bough, Shows graceful by the sturdy pine; And his red scales more ruddy glow The more her silver branches shine; And here and there the rough-kneed oak Spreads its sharp-dinted glossy leaves Where the slow fisher, oaring, cleaves Its shadow with a lazy stroke. And on the spit of land a stone, With lichen tinted and with moss, Stands on the tufted grass alone, Its face graven with a simple Cross; There is no word of pious lore, Nor wreath, nor ring, nor ornament, Nor sacred letters nicely blent— A simple Cross, and nothing more. Not other is the stone from those That in the mystic circle stand; An unhewn slab, and yet it shows New light risen on a darkling land; In monumental speech, it tells The story of the ages gone, The story of the Pagan stone New-charmed with sacred Christian spells. Men had been giving blow for blow, And wrath for wrath, and tears for tears, And reaping duly grief and woe Through the long tale of blood-stained years: Still, with the summer, long ships steered Up the calm loch with Norsemen fierce, Whose gleaming swords were sharp to pierce, And neither gods nor men they feared. In vain the coracle was hid In cove beneath the branching trees; In vain they practised rites forbid, Or sought the hills, and shunned the seas; The Viking came with brass-beaked ship, And wrath and sorrow came with him, And many a shining eye grew dim, And quivered many a smiling lip. Lo! then there travelled o'er the sea, From the lone isle where saints were bred, A peaceful, unarmed company Who brought good news of God, they said: They suffered much, yet did not grieve, They laboured much, and wearied not, They bore with joy a bitter lot, And sang their hymn at morn and eve. They sang about the dim grey seas, And One that walked upon their wave; They sang about the streams and trees In a far land beyond the grave; And when Norse axe, or wild kern's knife, Unpitying, smote bare head or breast, They sweetly sang themselves to rest With songs about the Crown of Life. By suffering thus subduing wrath, They conquered those who vanquished them; And corn grew on the waste war-path, And nets dried where the long ships came, And there was wealth where had been loss, And ringing bells for clash of swords, And needing no explaining words, On the old stone they graved a Cross. They conquered; yet for many a day The fierce old spirit lingered still, And the hot passion had its sway, And the old war-gods wrought their will, And rites of fear and blood were done Amid the mists, and on the moss; They had but scratched a shallow Cross Upon the grim old Pagan stone. Ah me! and still we hardly know The depth and glory of the Faith That opens life to man by slow, Meek suffering, patient unto death; We still are fain, with wrath and strife, To seek for gain, to shrink from loss, Content to scratch our shallow Cross On the rough surface of old life. And there it stands, the cross-charmed stone, On the green spit beyond the trees; It hears by night the faint sea-moan, By day the song-bird and the breeze, And Christian bells, and sounding trains, And the hard grinding of the wheels; And now and then a pilgrim kneels, And tells to it his griefs and pains. THE ABBEY “God at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers.”—Heb. i. I. Near by the river the Abbey stands, Among old fruit trees, and on fat green lands, With a weir on the river to drive the mill, And cunning cruives at the salmon-leap; And the beeves on the clover are fetlock-deep, And the sheep are nibbling the grassy hill. 'Tis now but a ruin, spreading wide Broken gable and cloistered side 'Mong lichened pear-trees and Spanish nuts, Here a pillar, and there a shrine, Or niche where its sculptured lords recline:— Long a quarry for walls and huts. Oh, stately the Lady-Chapel there Once reared its cross in the upper air Near by the river among the trees, And sweet bells rung, and censers swung, And matins and vespers and lauds were sung, With solemn-chaunted litanies. O'er the high Altar a meek face shone, A Virgin-Mother and Baby-Son, Fashioned by art beyond the sea; And there, in linen or purple dressed, A priest gave thanks, or a soul confessed, With a psalm of praise, or a bended knee. And some would pore over vellum books, And some would feather the sharp fish-hooks, And some would see to the sheep and kine; Some went hunting the red-deer stag, Some would travel with beggar's bag, And some sat long by the old red wine; Some would go pleading a cause in Rome, And still found cause to be far from home, And near to St. Peter's costly door: They were not all bad, and they were not all good Who wore the Monk's girdle and sandal and hood, But some of them padded the Cross they bore. Yet was the Abbey a fruitful stage In the slow growth, and the ripening age Of the long history of man: For beaming Virgin and Holy Child Made many a fierce heart meek and mild, And the mastery there of mind began. The footsore pilgrim there found rest, The heartsore too was a welcome guest, And who loved books, got helpful store. It is God who guides the world's affairs, And ever life rises by winding stairs, Screwing its way from the less to more. He reads the story best, who reads Ever to find some germing seeds Sprouting up to a nobler end, And God's long patience working still Through all the good, and through all the ill, And always something in us to mend. From bud to bell the wild bee strays, Seeking the sweets of the sunny days, Probing deep for the honey-cell; Yet well for his theft he pays the flower, For he brings to the blossom a quickening power, And a richer life to bud and bell. Narrow and poor was the old Church-life As it prayed in its cell, amid storm and strife, With scourgings many, and fastings new; It knew no letters, it spurned at Art, It had no pleasures, and lived apart— Doomed to die as the world's life grew. But something of wisdom the Monk would know, Something of gladness here below, Something of beauty, and what it can; He was not sinless, and yet he brought A larger heart, and a freer thought, And a fuller life to the sons of man. And we are a stage too—not the end; Others will come yet our work to mend, And they too will wonder at our poor ways. Ah! Life is more than our sermons, prayers, Bourses, machineries, multiplied wares— Still the heart sighs for the better days. Still is a feeling of something in me Which yet I am not, and I ought to be, Vaguely reaching for more and more; And the gain is loss, when I do not win A larger life for the soul within, And hopes of an ever-opening door. A PARABOLIC DISCOURSE “A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country.”—Luke xx. 9. First Head of Discourse A stately mansion in its park Stands fair amid the oaks and limes, Throstle and ousel, cuckoo and lark, And flowers and shrubs of many climes, And stars and tides ring out the chimes, Telling the seasons and the times. And many guests there come and go, And make themselves at home in it, Some restless, hurrying to and fro, Some lounging where the sunbeams flit, Some with a curious craving smit, Some with the laugh of careless wit. All through the woods they hunt the game, Or snare the fish in brook and mere, They bake the wheat by the ruddy flame, Or roast the flesh of the fatted steer, And draw from cellars cool the clear Old wine that has ripened many a year. This stately mansion is their inn, Where many fret, and all make free; They set the tables to lose or win, They tune the strings to dance with glee: Only their Host they do not see, And many doubt if Host there be. They think that He is far away, And that the place is theirs by right; They think, if He were coming, they Could bear the searching of His light; They think He is a dream of night, That morn will banish from the sight. But there are some grave men and wise Who lead the guests to a silent room, Wherein a golden volume lies, And picture of One in youthful bloom, Whose face a glory doth illume; And by His side are a Cross and Tomb. And this, they say, is He who made The great house 'mong the oaks and limes, And He is living who once was dead, But far away in heavenly climes, Where are no stars or tides or chimes, Telling the seasons and the times. And some of His guests He keeps for bliss, And some of them He keeps for gloom, Some He seals with a loving kiss, And some He stamps with the brand of doom, Some He saves by Cross and Tomb, Meekly dying in their room. These He loves of very grace; But those He leaves to die in sin, Not evermore to see His face, Nor ever hope of life to win: For all the unbelieving kin Wrath Eternal shuts them in. And therefore all should bow the knee At the glory of His might, And glory of His justice see, That surely doeth all things right; And so in Him should they delight Whether He heal their hearts, or smite. Second Head of Discourse Once, pitying much their foredoomed lot, One came who gentle was and meek, And burdened with long-brooding thought, And when he heard the wise men speak, He deeply questioned them; and they Replied that he was vain and weak: For this had been the faith alway Of all the martyrs and the saints, And all the ages stretching grey Among the mountains of events, Since Luther held the world at bay, Or Paul was busy making tents. Then silently he turned away, And to himself the question put, Searching the matter, night and day. He did not argue nor dispute, But prayed that God would lead him right, And sat and brooded still and mute, Until he saw, as 'twere, the white Thin sickle of the new-born moon That yet holds all the round of light, And all to him grew clear as noon, And he came singing, like a bird That sings for very joy its tune: He deemed it the Eternal Word, The glory and the life of Heaven, Which his entrancèd soul had heard. Lo! I have sought, he said, and striven To find the truth, and found it not, But yet to me it hath been given, And unto you it hath been brought. This Host of ours our Father is, And we the children He begot. Upon my brow I felt His kiss, His love is all about our steps, And He would lead us all to bliss; For though He comes in many shapes, His love is throbbing in them all, And from His love no soul escapes, And from His mercy none can fall. Third Head of Discourse Now, when they heard his words, they rose, And drove him forth into the night With many bitter words like blows; And said that all would now be right, That all their trouble now would cease, And all the house be full of peace. Yet in the dark and in the cold, Out in the night among the dews, He ceased not fresh discourse to hold Amid the limes and elms and yews; It was “a still small voice,” and yet They heard it in the wind and wet. He wandered there among the trees, Or in the day, or in the dark, And in the whistling of the breeze They heard him singing like a lark; He is our Father dear, he cried, And for the love of man He died. And somehow, ever as he sang, It seemed as if the great Book shone, And mystic, pleading voices rang About the rooms of vaulted stone, And tears were on the pictured face, And it was like a haunted place. But they went on as they had done, Still eating of the earth's increase, Laughing or lounging in the sun, And vowing that they had great peace; But no one heeded now the old Strange story that the wise men told. And yet the wise men were content, And said that they had faithful been; And to the chamber door they went, Though not by them the lights were seen, And read the Book and sang and prayed, And ate their viands undismayed. Fourth Head of Discourse Ah! which is truth? The sovereign Will That worketh out a purpose vast, Beyond our ken, to end at last In severance of the good and ill? Or love that sweetly would enfold All creatures in a large embrace, And with the tears that blot its face, Blot also out their sins untold? Dear story of the Cross and Book! Is it our fabling hearts that speak Fond dreams in Thee? and shall we seek, In vain, through every field and nook Of Nature for a witness true, Affirming what thy words have said Of Him who liveth, and was dead, And liveth to make all things new? In vain, we try to reconcile His hapless lot with love divine, Who born with taint of lust or wine, Is brought up in the lap of guile, And gets no chance: his infant eyes Look out on riot, vice, and hate, And lies and blood, and horrors great, And learn to look without surprise. And yet I hold with them who say That God is love, and God is light; But this is faith, it is not sight, And waiteth, hoping for the day. 'Tis vain to wrestle with the doubt, Or think to reason it away, As well go wrestle with the grey Cold mist that creeps the hills about. Yet I can trust, and hope and praise, Weary and dark as is the road, Because I see the heart of God, When on the bitter Cross I gaze. O fellest deed of wrath and wrong! Yet in thine evil-seeming slept A large assurance, that hath kept The Faith of goodness calm and strong. ELIJAH 2 Kings ii. 2-11 It was the great Elijah in the chariot of heaven, With the horses of Jehovah, by a mighty angel driven, And the chariot wheels were rushing 'mid a mist of fiery spray, Through glory of the night to higher glory of the day. It was the great Elijah—but meek and still was he, For he trembled at the glory which his flesh was soon to see, Going, girdled in his sackcloth, as the prophets were arrayed, To the splendour of the Presence where the angels are dismayed. Unwonted was the honour which his Master would accord To his true and faithful witness, bravest servant of the Lord; Yet better had he borne, I trow, the sad, old human way Of entering by the gates of Death into eternal day. Aye, better had he borne to turn his face unto the wall, With his kindred in their kindness gathered round him, one and all, And to lie down with his fathers in the dust for some brief space; For the death, he once had dreaded, now appeared a tender grace. It was the great Elijah; and the form that would dilate In the presence of King Ahab, and his Councillors of State, Now bowed its head in lowliness, as if it dared not cope With the terror of the glory, and the wonder of the hope. Away from earth they travelled; yet he somehow seemed to know The road, as if his weary steps had trod it long ago: And was not that the wilderness to which he once had fled? And that the lonely juniper where he had wished him dead? And was not that the cave where he had sat in sullen mood, Until he heard the “still small voice” that touched his heart with good? And was not that the road by which from Carmel he had run Before the chariot of the king about the set of sun? Yea, God was backward leading him to heaven along the path Which he had erewhile travelled o'er in fear or grief or wrath, That by its mingled memories his heart He might prepare For the grandeur and the glory and the crown he was to wear. Now, as they drove, careering, with the fire-flakes round the wheels, And the sparks that rushed like shooting stars from the horses' flashing heels, Lo! he was aware of a throng of men lay strewn along the road; And straight at them the angel drave the chariot of God. “Stay, stay!” then cried Elijah, “rein up the fiery steeds; They will mangle those poor people lying there like bruised reeds; See, they stir not; they are sleeping; or their thoughts are far away, And they do not hear the wheels of God to whom perchance they pray. “Full oft have I been praying so, and chiding His delay, And lo! the work was done, or ere my lips had ceased to pray; For our ears are dull of hearing; stay, and put them not to proof Beneath the grinding of the wheel, and trampling of the hoof.” “Nay, it boots not,” said the angel, “they are but the ghosts of #those Three hundred priests of Baalim who fell beneath thy blows That glorious day on Carmel; let them perish, as they cry To the gods that cannot help them when they live, or when they die. “Drive on, ye horses of the Lord, across the weltering throng, It is the great Elijah ye are bearing now along, Let them see him once again in the triumph of his faith, And hear the bitter mockery, and taste the bitter death.” It was the great Elijah, the prophet stern and grand, Faithful only to Jehovah he in all the faithless land, Zealous even unto slaughter for the God of Israel 'Gainst Ahab and the minions of the Tyrian Jezebel. But he answered, “Stay thy running, and let me here descend, For the Lord has brought me hither surely for this very end: Ah! this thing I had forgotten—day of glory and of dole— And I wist not what did ail me, but its weight was on my soul.” Then he stept down from the chariot, looking oh, so meek and mild, For the burden of the glory made him humble as a child; And he lifted up the prostrate head of one and then another, For the burden of the greatness made him tender as a mother. “Ye priests of ancient Sidon, and of purple Tyre,” he cried, “I have heard a still small voice that hushed the storms of wrath and pride, And God who was not in the fire, and was not in the wind, Was in the still small voice that spake to the unquiet mind. “O worshippers of Ashtaroth, and priests of Baalim, I thought to please Jehovah, and I only grievèd Him; I flouted you, and mocked you, and I deemed that I did well When I smote you in the name of Him, the God of Israel. “But He hath no pleasure in the death of any man that dies, He delighteth not in blood or smoke of such a sacrifice; Yea, not a worm is crushed, but the writhings of its pain Touch a chord of His great pity who made nothing live in vain. “He had patience with thee, Sidon, and patience I had none; For the art of Tyre, perchance, He let the sin of Tyre alone, Something He saw to stay His wrath; but I would nothing see; Ye were the Priests of Jezebel, and hateful unto me. “I did not think how hard it is to find the way of truth; I did not think how hard it is to shake the faith of youth; Yet, if I was walking in the light, the credit was not mine, But God's who in His grace to me had made the light to shine. “If ye were walking in the dark, and I was in the light, I should have brought its help to you, and plied you with its might; But I made my heart a flaming fire, my tongue a bitter rod, And I did not hear the still small voice which is the voice of God. “I said ye might have right to live in Tyre beside the sea, But not in high Samaria, or fertile Galilee; And I smote you there on Carmel, as I thought, by His commands, But I smote my own heart also when your blood was on my hands. “For the strength departed from me as the pity in me died, And in an unloved loneliness I nursed unhallowed pride; And I wist there was none faithful on the earth, but only I, And sat beneath the juniper, and prayed that I might die. “For Jezebel and Ahab did as they had done before, And the idols were exalted, and idolaters were more, And the land was nothing better for the blood that had been shed, And I sat beneath the juniper, and wished that I were dead. “Then it was I heard the still small voice, and bowed me to the ground, Humbled by the gracious burden of the mercy I had found, But I may not enter into rest, or with the Lord abide, Till ye humble with your pardon him that smote you in his pride.” Then, one by one, he bore them gently from the angel's way, And, one by one, he laid them down, and kissed them where they lay; And he never was so human as in his meekness then, And he never was so godlike till he was like other men. And he said in yearning pity, “Oh that I might die for you, Hapless souls that are in darkness, and who know not what they do!” And the tearful eye was swimming, and he heaved a weary sigh;— He was very near to glory with that great tear in his eye. And the angel in his chariot sat, and watched him toiling long, And the angel's face shone radiant, and he broke into a song; For the choicest songs of angels are the anthems that begin With the sorrow of a contrite heart a-breaking for its sin. And ever as the prophet wept, the angel sang more loud, And his face was shining more, the more the prophet's head was bowed; Until the task was ended, and the flesh was crucified, When lo! they were at the gate of heaven, and the door was opened wide. Lo! they were at the gate of heaven, and there a mighty throng, Ten thousand times ten thousand, raised their shout, and sang their song, But the Lord remembered he was flesh, and downcast for his sin, And Enoch who had walked with God came forth to lead him in. LITTERATEUR NOTE So he forsook the priesthood just in time, And only just in time; for there had been Ominous whispers, here and there, about Doctrine unsound, unsettling, dangerous, In rural manses, and at cleric meetings; In smithies too, and where the shuttle clicked, Sharp wits discussed him, and the ploughman even Ceased whistling in the furrow, brooding o'er The thoughts that came to him, and drove his soul From its old furrow into a fresh soil. Unsettling and alarming! There was peace While the tea-table gossiped, and the smith Told his coarse stories to the laughing clowns (Heard also by the maids that bleached the linen Upon the green hard by)—peace when the weaver Talked treason with his thin and blood-less lips, Starved into revolutionary dreams— And peace while men grew brutal as the steer They harnessed to their plough! Then all went well; There was no danger to alarm the Church! But thought disturbs the world, and thought of God Unsettles most of all; for it is life, And only life can comprehend its force, Or guide it. 'Tis as lightning in the cloud; We know not what, or where its bolt may strike, But fear for the church-steeples, and ourselves, Nor dream there may be blessing even in it. Yet there are surely times when there is nought So needed as unsettling, just to get Out of old ruts, and seek a nobler life. Raban forsook the Church, whose service once Had been his fond ambition. But ere that There had been meetings of the cardinals At the headquarters, moved thereto by letters, Representations, visits, urging them That something must be done to save the Faith Which stood in peril from the hand of one Who should have stayed the ark. High Cardinals Bourgeon in all the churches; there red-stockinged, And crimson-hatted — here in sober black; Now bald with age, now shaven to look like age And gravity; and mostly portly men Of large discourse, and excellent taste in wines. They cultivate the wisdom of the serpent, And leave the rest to play the harmless dove, Fulfilling thus the scripture by division Of labour, as the modern law requires:— You do the simple dove, as Christ enjoins, And I will do the serpent. For the Church, As a world-kingdom, they are worldly-wise, Subtle diplomatists, far-seeing schemers Of crafty policy, yet often men Who would not sacrifice a dearest friend For its advantage, sooner than themselves Would bleed at the same altar; yet alas They offer sometimes, what is holier still, That charity which is the Church's life For the world-kingdom which they call God's Church. Men of long silence, they will seldom speak Till they are ready to strike; and so they held Many a quiet meeting, letting not A whisper of its purport from their lips, Only they looked more grave than customary, As they who have grave business on their hands. In truth, they wist not what they ought to do: The evil might be great; but then he was So slight a man, so inconsiderable, Unbeneficed, unpopular; and to break A fly upon the wheel was apt to rouse Unreasonable laughter, and such men Like not such mirth. And then as to these views— Who could pin down a shadow to the ground, And take its measure? Who could try the notes Of a wild bird by proper rhythmic laws? Or say if the wind whistled by the gamut? They understood not what he would be at: A mystic, vague and unsubstantial, true To no laws that they knew; but they were sure That he was vain and foolish, and would melt Like sugar in the mouth, and be forgot Save by some sweet-toothed children. Let him be; Contempt would kill that, like a nipping frost, Which, grown notorious, might live on a while, And work some mischief. They were very wise, The portly cardinals, and yet they knew not All that the future knew, and how the truth Works sometimes from without as from within. Meanwhile, he wist not what they communed of; None spake to him of trouble in the air, Of ill reports, of plans to wreck his hopes, If hope still clung to him; nor any brother Came in a brother's love to him, and said: Lo! we will reason it together; then God will give light perchance, and thou shalt be Saved from much sorrow, and I shall be blessed. They looked askance at him; they crossed the road, And passed on the other side; they lifted up Their eyes to heaven, and saw him not; or with Broad, brazen stare they silently wenton. He noted them, but heeded not, or thought But how the herd sweep past the stricken deer, Or how the wild wolves, padding o'er the waste, Eyeing a wounded comrade, note how soon The time may come when they shall lap his blood, Or gnaw his bones. But nothing then he knew Of their complaints, or of the storm a-brewing; He only thought that people had not loved His preaching, and would hear his voice no more; Else had he stayed it out to fight the fight, For sound of trumpet and the clash of swords Roused in him joy of battle, even then When hope of victory was none in him. So, wotting not his peril, he forsook The pulpit where they welcomed him no more— The wandering life that, weekly, pitched its tent In some fresh home, where children laughed and sang, And all the hopes that like the ivy grew Green about old church towers: and sat him down In a small garret with a new-made pen. Once they complained his sermons were like books, Essays original and quaint, which men Might read in print, and wisely meditate; And now they said his books did somewhat smack Of homely preaching, such as long ago Spoke to the times. He brought a sacred spirit Unto the secular task, and called on men To follow lofty aims and noble deeds. Even when he laughed at fools, his mirth would be Pitiful, and when he would edge his tool Sharper to smite the wooden wit o' the time, Yet was it in some cause of righteousness, Or large humanity, that might have been Theme of a prophet mocking at the devil. And thus he breathed into our common life, And round about the church, an atmosphere That changed them both, and loosed their bonds, and wrought As none might work within the Temple gate; For oft the Church must learn from those without Who paste the prophet-broadside on its wall, Or sing their burden on the busy street. SECULAR Who once has worn the priestly robe, and seen The upturned faces with their look of awe, As unto prophet giving forth the law Amid the hush which, even when thought is lean, Devoutly listens,—having ere while been 'Mong holy things within the altar rails, Is fain to hide his head, what time he fails, And seeks his pulpit in a magazine, Unfrocked of his own will. He shrinks with fear From buzzing critics carping at his wit, And on the buried past he drops a tear, Until he finds the secular life is knit And braced by freedom, and is, haply, more Large and full than his life before. CONTENT Howe'er it be with some, the broad highway Is better than the priestly path for me; For when it was my task, from day to day, To do official pieties, and pray, I think I might have grown a Pharisee, Pumping my heart, when it was dry as dust, For words of faith and hope—because I must. Then are we at our highest, when we touch The Infinite and Good in worship due, Bowing in lowly reverence to such As we deem holiest, and trusting much Because the holiest is most pitying too: Nothing so nobly human as the quest That seeks true man in God, and there finds rest. But he who all day handles sacred tasks, While his thoughts travail with the world, and he Nor hopes to get from God the thing he asks, Nor yet to hide from God the heart he masks To others—how it wounds his soul to be Praying-machine, until the day's chief sin Is the chief duty he has done therein! I did not turn a Pharisee; I fought Against the perils that my life beset, And when I felt no worship, worshipped not, And when my heart was merry, mirth I sought, Entangling jests like gay moths in a net, And laughed, and made laugh, though I saw, the while, They fancied not a priest so given to smile. Be the road stormy, be it calm and mild, Yet snares are spread there, pitfalls too are dug: The pious mother, longing that her child May keep his white robe clean and undefiled, Dreams of a peaceful parsonage and snug, Where the world comes not, neither any snare; Yet world and flesh and devil, too, are there. Just past their teens, we task young souls to do What needs a large experience deeply-tried; And oft I marvel they remain so true, Freshening the old, and bringing forth the new, And with the growing life still growing wide; For the cloud-incense of the altar hides The true form of the God who there abides. But now I do my work with hand and head, And do my worship with a separate heart; With a good conscience earning daily bread, And by the Heavenly Father duly fed, I keep the worship and the work apart; And yet the work has worship in it too, But willing service, not a task I do. My heart is more at one, my soul more calm, My Sunday more a welcome joy to me, Whose rest is sweetened by the folded palm, The bended knee, and the uplifted psalm, While once it was a fretful troubled sea Vexed by the thought of human praise or blame, And only partly lit by the Great Name. DISCONTENT Sitting apart, I hear the murmuring tide of life, Its onward rush, and foaming strife, Yet bid my heart String dainty words in fancies quaint, And be content. Lying abed, I dream, with method in my dream, And catch up any lights that gleam Into my head, And fondle a conceit, beguiled As by a child. Poring o'er books, Dingy, old volumes, by the hour, Which only I and moths devour, My eyes find hooks In each dim page, and I have peace In their increase. What would I more, Since I have dropt out of the race, But eddy in a quiet place Beside the shore, And make a play of life, and smile A little while? Yet now and then, A something pricks me, canst thou see The breaking waves that surge by thee; And has thy pen No service, but these fancies odd, For man or God? Ah! vexing heart, Rebellious! fain to seek the fight, Though broken all thy force and might, Thou hast no part In life, but with a patient will See, and be still. SUCCESS I have done well, I said, for I have found My place in life, the work that I can do, And in my garret, spurning the low ground, I can, at least, be manful, free, and true. Nameless, I go about, and sometimes hear The whisper of a fame that is to come; They wot not who I am, and I appear All unconcerned with that low-gathering hum. It is like being dead, and hearing what Verdict of history may one day speak; And now I laugh, and now I wonder at Myself, that I can be so vain and weak. But when I think, here will I make my nest, Ah me! the nest unfeathered is and cold, But sticks and thorns whereon there is no rest, And never love its weary wings could fold. There is a little islet that I know, Blue with forget-me-nots—a lonely spot, And no bird nestles where their gold eyes grow: 'Tis just a home of long forget-me-not. So lonely and so barren is my lot, Still dreaming, where the quiet water sleeps, To win a name that shall not be forgot; And that is all it either sows or reaps. A WALK A clear, crisp, Autumn day. Autumn is Scotch And lingers lovingly among the hills, Knee-deep in golden bracken, and golden grass That tints the moor, what time the purple heather Withers to brown, and golden pendants hang On the slim, drooping birch — the golden time Of all the Northern year. You shall find spring, Joyous with bursting life, in English lanes Where the May-blossom wafts from straggling hedge Its incense like a white-robed Thurifer, While the meek violet, like a saintly soul, Hid in a green obscurity, breathes out Its sweets, unseen, and the pale primrose woos The shadow at the foot of lush blue-bells. Green are the meadows there, and green the leaves Opening, with various shade, in chestnut whorls, And feathery birch, and plane and beech and lime, And late ash-bud and oak—the many tints Like many colours, yet one flush of green From the young life o' the year. But Autumn loves The ferny braes, the brown heath on the hills, The lichened rocks, orange and grey and black, The harebell and the foxglove in the shaws, The brisk and nimble air upon the moor, The flying cloud that scuds across the blue, Its shadow hurrying o'er the sunlight brow Of the still mountain, and the sleepy loch Quivering as in a dream of coot and heron, Or leaping trout; thither the antlered stag Leads forth his hinds to water at the dawn: And life is at full pitch of beauty then, When verging to its close. That Autumn day, I wandered forth alone, in sober ways While yet the shadow of the houses fell Around me, and the window-eyes looked on; Yet I was glad, for I had found my work. And when I reached the country, and beheld The loaded wains with the last harvest-sheaves Led homeward, and the reapers blithe and brown, And felt my feet among the rustling leaves By the wayside, and watched the shining spikes Of frost in shady nooks beside the burn, I could not walk, but leaped, and laughed at nothings In very joy of life; for anything Serves for a jest what time the heart is gay. So on and up I went, with tireless feet, And fertile mind suggesting victories My pen should win for me, as the slow years Ripened the powers which circumstance disclosed, And critics now approved. I had the trick Of hoping to the full, and building up Dream-palaces, creative, out of nothing, Collapsing into nothing at a touch Of adverse fact; and that day I was in The mood to make whole worlds, with suns and stars, And flowers and birds, and homes by love made glad. But crossing a waste moor, where hills of slag Rose bare, and sluggish pools were at their feet, Where no fish swam, but red lights ever glowed, I came upon a village mean and poor, Which no one cared for, save to draw much wealth From seams of coal, and veins of ironstone That undermined it; one long string of huts, Ugly and dirty and monotonous; And no bell rang there on the Sabbath morn, And only Death e'er spoke to them of God. Swart, stunted men were plodding from the pits, Weary, with little lamps stuck in their caps Instead of flower or feather; savage children Were skulking at the doors, but none of them Did run to meet their fathers, and be kissed And borne home shoulder-high; the mothers, too, Were fierce, and smiled not when the men came home, For they were weary, and not with woman's work. Oft had I seen the peasant from his plough Plod slowly home, but gladdened by his girl, Curly and sunny, chattering at his side, And by the baby nestling on his breast, And by the mother smiling at the door With the milk-pail; and often watched the fisher, Hard-faced and weather-beaten, leave his boat, At early morn with children gambolling, Barefooted, on the sand, or leading him Home in the pride of love, with the fresh spoils Of the old sea; but such a sight as this, So without hope or heart or any joy I had not seen before: a place so dreary, So God-forsaken in its ugliness, Each house alike, the people too alike Dismal and brutal; and the only spot With any brightness was a drinking house Shining with glass and brass and painted barrels. Therewith the thought again knocked at my heart, Urgent and loud: Was thy life given to thee For making pretty sentences, and play Of dainty humour for the mirthful heart To be more merry; or to serve thy kind, Redressing wrong? And all the long way home That thought kept ever knocking at my heart. LOST Sick, sick at heart and in despair, Through crowded street, and quiet square I seek my lost Love everywhere. A while, with shamed and broken mind, I hid from her, content to find Her shadow nightly on the blind; Content to hear her even-song Go up with tremulous note or strong, Go up the angels' hymns among, Meanwhile I stood beneath the lamp, And fretted on the pavement damp At the slow Watchman's patient tramp, Or noted where the shadows flit On quaint old gables, or a bit Of carving by the moonbeams lit. The shame of failure on me lay, And led me on a lonely way, Hoping for dawn of a new day. Yet now the day has come, and lo! It is like morning creeping slow Into a blinded house of woe. Gone! and she has not left a trace! And while I haunt the silent place, Oh! I am haunted by her face. O fool and coward! not to see That love, which would have trusted thee, Must die if it distrusted be! CHANGE Ah! to have lived at Love's high pitch, And then fall back on level lines Of commonplace! to have been rich, As one who ventures deep in mines, And then to toil at hedge or ditch, And dream of costly fares and wines! Gone from my life the impassioned strain That gave it all its tender grace, And now its gladness is the pain That draws deep furrows on my face; But I can never stoop again To the dull round of commonplace. Another passion must knit up These flagging energies of mine; No muddy water for my cup! But fill it full with generous wine; Who knows what Love is, may not sup On that which is not still divine. He who was caught up, as he said, To the third heavens, and heard and saw Unutterable things, would tread Earth, after, in a trance of awe, Nor might he ever bow his head To bear the yoke of meaner law. I saw the people sad and dumb, With none to utter their complaints, But preached to of a world to come, And damned because they were not saints: And there, I said, is work for some Whose heart with hunger in them faints. BAD TIMES An evil time! a time of deep unrest, And thoughts that reached out for a larger life, When bread was dear, the poor were sore distressed And work was scanty, and the taxes rife. Often, at night, I walked about the town, When the broad moon was silvering street and square, And all the loathsome now was lovely grown, For only light and shadow brooded there. Stately and fair the gabled houses rose, And hazy legend, or historic light Clung to each winding stair, or murky close, And with the past day filled the present night. And in a dream of history I went Along the centuries of pride and sin That me o'ershadowed, till my heart was rent With pity of the sights I saw therein. For often from the gloom and from the cold Where they lay shivering in a dusky nook, Gaunt faces glared at me, and children told Their misery in a wan and wasted look. And pest and hunger there went hand in hand, Invisible but strong, and some went mad, While good men licked their lips, and looking bland Over their port, allowed the times were bad. NOW AND THEN One rode amid a rabble throng, And laid about him with a sword; His heart was high, his hand was strong, Nor did he stint an angry word; “Ho! lurdanes, earth is full of bread, An ye will work for its increase, But an ye idle here, instead, 'Twere better that your breath should cease. Get to the mattock and the hoe, The distaff and the spinning-wheel; Ods life! who will not work, shall know The bitter taste of cord or steel. Away! with crutch and beggar's whine! Away with balled-singing rogues! And lo! ye shall have flesh and wine, And hosen warm and leathern brogues; And there shall not be rags or debt, Or hunger in the land, or cold, If ye will only dig and sweat”— But that was in the days of old. One looked upon a wrathful crowd That surged about the market square, And with hoarse clamour cried aloud The spawn of Tyrants not to spare; And from the throng he took his way Into a waste and desert land, In loneliness to brood and pray, And bring back order and command. Then coming from the desert place, Again the market square he trod, With shining glories in his face, And laws that had the seal of God: “Behold,” he said, “the gods command That ye shall keep these statutes good, And they will give you fruitful land To dwell in, and ye shall have food.” And they had faith, and writ the laws In letters large of gleaming gold, To order every plea and cause— But that was in the days of old. But now this pinched and sunk-eyed mob, 'Tis work they ask the Powers to give, Hating to filch or steal or rob, Ashamed to beg that they may live. But silent is the clicking loom, And silent too the birring wheel, The flaming forge is quenched in gloom, The mill is grinding little meal. The ships are rotting in the dock, The cage hangs listless o'er the mine, The hammer rings not on the rock, The spade rusts on the unfinished line, And gladly would they toil and sweat, Without the taste of cord or steel, And gladly keep the order set By any law the gods could seal. But I have only tongue and pen, And neither force nor faith to hold My way among the sons of men As they did in the days of old. HOW WE DID IT Erewhile our forefathers, hating oppression, Sware a great oath that their blood they would spill, New-hefted scythe, issued plea and Confession, Scoured the old musket, and took to the hill. Loomed in the front of them scaffold and halter, Hunger and weariness, battle and death, Only the mists of the mountain for shelter, Only the raven to watch their last breath. Times were heroic then; e'en the slow peasant Felt his heart swell 'mid the trumpets and spears; And if our commonplace way is more pleasant, Yet we have lost the great soul of those years. We held monster-meetings, signed tons of petitions, And snowed all the country with leaflets and tracts, Setting forth all our desires and conditions, And bristling with arguments, figures, and facts. With weekly pennies, and working committees, And secretaries, and printing large, We knit together the towns and cities, And rallied the battle, and made our charge. Heroes we were not; they were not wanted; Power now must yield what the people demand; But sometimes I laughed as our doings we vaunted, The work was so common, the words were so grand. Yet what have the ages been slowly achieving, By slings, bows and arrows, and muskets and swords, But just that we now should be peacefully weaving Far mightier spells by the virtue of words? STORM-BIRDS O creatures of the storm! Shrill birds that scream but when the shrill winds blow, And fish of monstrous form Which the long rollers on the sandbeach throw, And with the tangled wrack drift to and fro— You well I know. O creatures of the storm! That creep out of your holes to meet the rain, Foul toad and slug and worm, And to your proper dark return again, When the sun shines, and merry birds are fain To sing amain! Yet the storm also brings The Master to the helm the ship to guide, And deftly trim her wings, And shape her course amid the wind and tide, And so the best and worst are side by side, While storms abide. RUMOUR Open-mouthed Rumour ran from street to street, Telling of flour devoured by rats and mice; Telling of old stacked corn by wet and heat Wasted, while waiting for a famine-price; Telling of fortunes speculators made Out of the miseries of the hapless poor; Telling of mothers starved and lying dead, While babies gnawed their breasts upon the floor; Telling of men devouring grass and hay To stay the hunger that devoured their bones; Telling how gamesome children now would play At funerals only on the paving stones; Telling how soldiers did their sabres whet, And kept their horses saddled day and night, And primed their muskets, when the people met, Ready to quench in blood the cause of right; Telling of speakers threatened for true words; Telling of lawyers framing treason-pleas; Telling of harsh things done by angry lords; Telling of statesmen who were ill at ease. Many-tongued Rumour had a busy time, And men were greedy for the tales she bore, And when she told of madness, sin, or crime, The worse the story they believed the more! O foolish world, be-rumoured of they wits! How had a spark then set thee in a blaze Amid thy heats and chills and trembling fits, And turned to grief the glory of those days! TRIUMPH Upon a day of triumph some will shout, And set the bells a-ringing in the steeple, And fountains spouting wine for all the people, And lights in all the windows round about. They must have noise of cracker, squib, and gun, And at the market-cross with loud hurrahing, And shaking hands, and bands of music playing, They will proclaim that now the day is won. For me, I went home with a quaint old book, And shut me in to have a long night's reading; That was my payment, for my soul was needing Still waters in a restful, quiet nook. Well; each man has his way, and this was mine; I could not care for fizzing squibs and crackers, Hallooing crowds, and empty boastful talkers Made eloquent by vanity and wine. Tramp, tramp, I heard them marching here and there, With strutting bagpipe, or with noisy drumming; And when I hoped that surely calm was coming, Fresh clamours rose with rockets in the air. And at my door they paused a while, and gave A ringing cheer that set my heart a-beating, And flung their caps on high with kindly greeting, And slowly ebbed back like a broken wave. As they were glad, I let them have their way; As I was glad, I took my own good pleasure; And while they bawled and shouted without measure, I read old chronicles till break of day. ENDINGS NOTE Rarely is life compact into a plot Carefully laid, with deepening interest, Dramatic unities, and characters Entangled in a tragic Fate that works To a foredoomed catastrophe, and melts All hearts with pity. Unto most of us There comes no great event for winding up The story—only chapter broken short, And, one by one, the snapping of some thread, Once twined with ours, making it full and strong, And now by loss enfeebling it, till life, Grown thin and lonely, tapers to its close With lessening interest: a tragic tale, And yet without a grand catastrophe. So Raban judged it, when he summed his days In broken ends whereat the once full life Oozed out, and he went on his way alone, Making no loud complainings, blaming none But himself only, and seeing good in all— Some touch of grace which showed that they were human, Or broken link which proved them once divine. RETROSPECT The traveller in the desert lone Looks back, regretful oft, to think Of the sweet wells where he could drink, Ere Fate had lured, or driven him on Into a wan and wasted land Of Wadys where the streams are sand. And wistfully I, too, look back From life, successful as they say, That has no water by the way; And it is water that I lack, And there was water for my thirst, When failure of my hope was worst. There is no life so commonplace But, if you search it, you shall find A secret chamber of the mind, Enshrining some fair sainted face, Where worship still is done with tears That freshen the grey dusky years. That was its living water once, Sweet-singing ever by the way, And gleaming through its darkest day,— The glory of its young Romance: But oh, the desert wastes that spread Where Love lives on, and Hope is dead! OMEN A fair white dove came to my window sill In the faint morning light, Preening its feathers with a pale pink bill Daintily in my sight, Nodding its head with pretty curtsey still To left and right, And then took flight. O fair, white dove, I meant to thee no ill; Why did'st thou then take fright, And vanish from my sight? THE PUBLIC MEETING I stood up to speak. At my back was a score Of broadcloth respectables solemnly stewing, For the vast hall was filled from the roof to the floor, And they swarmed, thick as bees, at each window and door, And I knew, at a glance, that a storm was a-brewing For my certain undoing. Yet I stood up to speak. Almost under my feet, With pencil and notebook, were newspaper men; Some staid-looking working lads kept the first seat, Then students and snobs and the cads of the street, With a woman, perhaps, for each three-score and ten, And a child, now and then. I was not ta'en aback, in the least, though I saw That the meeting was packed with a loud senseless mob, And standing near by, was a Limb-o'-the-Law Who rubbed his sleek chin with a vulture-like claw, And a grin of conceit at the well-managed job, Which made my pulse throb. So I stood up to speak. What a greeting I had! They hooted, yelled, whistled, and cat-called and groaned, Hissed, jeered at me, howled; cried “His throat sure is bad!” “Cough it up!” “Try an orange!” and “Was I not glad To address my dear friends?” Then they hooted and moaned, And sang and intoned. Still I held my ground stoutly; replied as I could, At times ready-witted, and then got a laugh, But always good-humoured: I thought that their mood Would change by and by, when they saw that I stood With unruffled temper, and bore all the chaff Of that stormy riff-raff. I had often stood there with a ringing hurrah! That greeted each hit; and I would not be beat, As I watched that long Limb-o'-the-Law looking grey While he signalled his Claque; so I stood there at bay, Though the Kentish fire rung out from three thousand feet With a fierce dust and heat. But scanning their faces, I saw that the most Were brainless or beery, or big-jowled, with low Brute foreheads, and felt that our cause must be lost With a white-chokered Chairman as pale as a ghost, And those broad-cloth respectables, ranged in a row, Full of dismal dumb-show. Never mind; I would try; I had lungs that would shout Like a boatswain's, and ring with the storm at its height; And I knew people liked me; and half of the rout Was the clamour of friends who would have me hold out, Though I had to gesticulate till the daylight Broke on that stormy night. So I plucked up my courage, and threw back the hair From my brow, scanned the Lawyer from top down to toe, Who gave back my gaze with an impudent stare; Then I nodded, and smiled to my friends here and there, While I watched the dim crowd as it swayed to and fro, Seeming wilder to grow. Now, a score of cocks crew, as to welcome the day, Then a wild caterwauling of cats in the dark Through the galleries ran; then a donkey would bray, Or dogs yelped and howled in a horrible way, As if all the creatures shut up in the Ark Came to yell, scream, or bark. After that arose a chorus of “God save the Queen,” With a tramping of boots keeping time. How the dust Rose in clouds, until hardly a face could be seen! How they roared themselves hoarse! What a coughing between Each verse as they sang out of tune! for they must Clear their throats of the rust. It was all in the programme, of course; so I stood And patiently edged in a word here and there, Now lost in the clamour, now half-understood, Now caught by the grinning reporters, now good, But as often bad; and I did not much care; It was spent on the air. Should I try any longer? What hope there to speak Words of reason to men who all reason eschew? Highest truths to such ears were but Hebrew and Greek, And logic no more than the doors when they creak, And pathos like wind in a cranny that blew; And they'd laugh at it too. Leave the fools to the fate they are fain to provoke! They will know what it is in the coming distress, When they've damped down the furnace, and cleared off the smoke, And emptied the yards, and begin then to croak That taxes grow bigger as wages grow less, And the hard times press! Let them be till the workshop is empty and still, And the clock on the wall does not wag any more, And the fire does not burn, though the winter is chill, And there's nothing to pawn, and there's nothing to fill The pale and pinched children that cry at the door, Or squat on the floor! Just then, looking down, my eye caught in the aisle A white oval face sweetly turned up to mine, Lips parted in eagerness, tipped with a smile As the great purple eyes beamed upon me a while, Or flashed on the crowd with an anger divine That warmed me like wine. 'Twas the face I had loved in the House in the Square! Just that look it had worn when her soul was inspired, As we read of the heroes of old who could dare The rage of the Demos, when madness was there, Or wrath of the gods, when their anger was fired, And their patience expired. She had haunted my dreams, as I struggled to rise, She had cheered me in vision, what time I had failed, And now there she sat, and I saw in her eyes The fond love of youth without let or disguise, Till she wist that I saw it, and trembled and quailed, And the glowing face paled. Then I said in my heart: “No, I will not be beat; She shall not regret to have trusted me so; I have stood for an hour in the roar and the heat, I will stand till the day dash its light at my feet; But she shall not go home with her faith sinking low In the dear long ago. That moment a lull came, and stir near the door; Some were weary of shouting, some went out for beer; So I slipt in a joke, setting some in a roar, Then a story that tickled their humour; that o'er, For one that still hissed, there were twenty cried Hear! And my way was all clear. But my blood now was up: Ware! my Limb-o'-the-Law! Who would drown voice of reason with clamour and shout; With the laugh on my side now, at each hit I saw His cheek grew more livid, his vulture-like claw Twitch and clutch at the chin it went feeling about, As my wrath was poured out. “'Twas the way of all Tyrants to gag our free speech, And the sign of a bad cause to shrink from debate; Let them look to their freedom when those who should preach Law and order, brought rowdies whom nothing could teach, Beered up to the lips, to roar like a spate, Drowning truth which they hate.” Then I tossed him aside, and took up the great theme Of Justice and Peace, till they thrilled at my words; Yet I saw but the flush on her face, and the gleam Of the great purple eyes, as she drank in the stream That reasoned against the unreason of swords For man's law, and the Lord's. “There was a wild madness abroad in the air, A longing for war which the rulers had nursed; They had roused up the wild beast that still had his lair In the civilised heart, without cause that would bear The quarrel of nations; and with a blood-thirst The land was accursed.” Then I sat down at last, 'mid a ringing Hurrah! And kindly pet names, and a hum of content, As the motion was carried; and hasting away, I watched by the great door, and stood in the grey Watery light of the moon, till the last of them went— Very weary and spent. I peered at each veiled face, but met not her gaze, Poked my head in each bonnet, but she was not there, Saw white figures point at me, heard whispered praise, And remarks on my pluck from a cab or a chaise; But my heart sank within me in very despair, And I heard unaware. I had seen her once more, but to lose her again, Through the storm she had burst like a sunblink on me; And the joy of young Love flushed my heart and my brain, Like a fresh aftermath breathing sweet after rain, With all the birds singing on bush and tree— And now where was she? Could my eyes have played false? Could there be a mistake? No; there was none else with those wonderful eyes, And there was none else in the world that could make My heart so to flutter and beat for her sake, And there was none else could my soul so surprise With dear memories. Later on in the night I sat by the fire, Alone, and in silence, my heart very low, All the triumph gone out in a longing desire, As I saw the moon pale, and her glory expire In the dull drizzling rain falling steady and slow, When the wind ceased to blow. I mused on the past; on the House in the Square, On the hope that had clung to me all the long years, Unspoken, 'mid struggle and failure and care; And now in the hour when I felt I might dare, She had come—she had gone—as a phantom appears; And my eyes swam in tears. Then there came to my door just the faintest of taps, Like the sound of small fingers that timidly knock; “Come in”; I look up, and some moments elapse In stillness; and then again two or three raps, But never a movement of latch or of lock On the dull silence broke. “Oh, the housemaid, of course; she is wanting to bed; No wonder, poor drudge!” So I opened the door; “No supper to-night, Jane,” I wearily said: But it was not the housemaid I saw: in her stead Was the white oval face of the sweet days of yore, Gazing at me once more. I breathed a long breath: was I dreaming? or what? Tongue-tied there I stood, as if bound by a spell: Then she dropped me a curtsey; still stood on the mat; Called me “Sir”; and “Felt sure I had seen where she sat; And she could not go home without coming to tell I did bravely and well. “Her husband was waiting her out in the street; And oh she was proud to have heard me that night; Had her mother but witnessed my triumph complete, Who had always believed in me!” Then, with a sweet Smile, she glided away like a ghost out of sight, Ere my senses came right. I had been quite bemazed: she had curtseyed to me! Called me “Sir”—me that would have gone down at her feet, And grovelled to kiss her wet frock, or to be Trod upon, for it had been an honour if she Should use me to carpet the stones on the street, And go dainty and neat! Did she speak of a husband? I groaned at the thought, Sick at heart—I who loved so had never once kissed Her lips, save in dreams of a happier lot; And now all my loving and waiting had brought— What was it?—a vision that passed ere I wist, Like a vanishing mist. I rushed out of door, up the street, and then down, But saw not a form in the dull drizzling rain, And heard not a footfall: the watch of the town Flashed his bull's-eye upon me from toe up to crown; “No, no one had passed”; so I crept home again In wonder and pain. She had gone from my life, and its light was all gone; She had gone from my life, and I saw her no more; Drip, drip! let it pelt!—it was eerie and lone; So was I; and my heart lay within me like stone; And I cared not although the slow pitiless pour Should drip evermore. MISGIVING Has he done wrong, who, as the years go past, In loneliness, knowing it all in vain, As he has loved before, to love again, Brings to his home another bride at last? Tender and kind, he cherishes his mate More tenderly, the more he feels that she Gets not the perfect love which ought to be The guerdon and the bliss of wife's estate. For while he gently kisses her fond lips, It is another face that meets his gaze; And he is stung by words of love or praise Which the truth known would darken with eclipse. O sorrow and shame! that, while he lies beside The trusting one, he in the silence hears His heart throb for the love of other years, And calm to her whom he has made his bride. REMORSE Alas! she did not long with me abide, But pining slowly, Like waning moon, she faded by my side With melancholy, And in our fifth spring, died. I lifted up the face-cloth from her face; Upon its beauty, Stony and still, yet lay the tender grace Of love and duty, And patient sorrow's trace. O heart, I said, that gavest me all thy wealth, Of love's rich treasure, And now by open service, now by stealth, Were't fain to pleasure My sickness or my health; O faithful heart! and yet thou had'st from me Observance only: And still thy wistful, hungry look would be Like one who, lonely, Gazes far out at sea— Gazes far out to catch the hoped-for sail Film the horizon, But only ocean, fretting in the gale She sets her eyes on, And hears the sea-mew wail. I gave thee what I had; but that was not What love expected; And when the fond heart for a fond heart sought, Thy love detected The emptiness it got. I took thy gold, and gave thee but my brass; Though deep indebted, When thou would'st look for more, I let thee pass, Or even fretted That thou should'st sigh, alas! I gave thee kisses, but my kiss was cold, And dainty dresses, I did not grudge thee jewels set in gold For thy caresses, As if they had been sold. But that alacrity which doth prevent Our wishes even, That pleasure which on pleasing still is bent, That was not given, Which might thy soul content. Thy heart for love was longing, and mine had No love to give it— A ruin haunted by a memory sad, That would not leave it Though truth and duty bade. I called it sentimental, silly, wrong; But yet it nestled The closer, and I think it grew more strong The more I wrestled, And I did wrestle long. O pardon! that I was not true to thee; I tried to will it, And then the Past arose and wailed in me, Nor could I still it More than the sounding sea. Ah! to be true to thee, and false to her!— I could not do it; Yet to be false to thee a baseness were, And I should rue it In life and character! So life is ravelled almost ere we wot; And with our vexing To disentangle it, we make the knot But more perplexing, Embittering our lot. Farewell, true heart; my sorrow stirs in me With no self-pity, But shamed and self-condemning. But I see The Holy City Opening its gates to thee— Opening its gates to show thee all the truth And all the folly; The secret of the sorrow of thy youth, And melancholy Which touches me with ruth. Farewell; while thou had'st being here and breath, The truth was hidden, But now before the majesty of death My soul, God-bidden, Speaks out its better faith. AFTER DINNER Returned from Ballarat, where he had found Gold nuggets in the early rush, and more Golden experience, Martin Lusk, one day, Bearded and bronzed, dropt in upon the quiet Where I with treasured books—mine ancient friends— Was communing. At first, I knew him not, But soon the name recalled a form, a face From the dim past, that might perhaps have grown Into this son of Anak. So we fell A-talking, and I found his mind well stored With fresh, quaint pictures of that Digger-life Fighting with Death and Fortune, gambling, drinking, Thieving and pistolling, in dirt and squalor, Brutal-heroic, yet with touching gleams Of human tenderness, and gradual sway Of Law that, self-evolved, yet mastered self, And rough-shaped that wild chaos. I could see This keen observer was a thinker too, Patient and tolerant, with the stuff in him For building up an empire. Being lonely In his hotel, and so conversible, I made him promise he would dine with me. Reluctant he agreed, reluctant came, And sat uneasy and silent, changed as much From the clear-sighted man I met at noon As from the bright-eyed youth of early days. Lusk, as a lad, was bold and confident, An only son, spoilt by a doting mother, Spoilt, too, by sisters proud of him, even spoilt By admiration of his college mates For a rich nature foremost in all games, Well forward too in studies and in speech, And yet not greatly spoilt by all their spoiling, Just frank and bold and sure of his position. But now he sat there, like a bashful girl At her first ball, blushing, and hardly spoke Save yea and nay, until we were alone. Then I: What ails you, Martin? What is wrong? Have we done aught to vex you, that you sit Dumb as a moulting raven? My home-bred girls, Untravelled, when they heard that you were coming, Donned their best muslins, and their gayest ribbons, Meaning to show their best, and talk their best, And listen at their best. For they were all Eager to hear of pouchèd kangaroos, And duck-billed quadrupeds, and great emus Piling their eggs amid the sandy scrub, Black fellows, and the pig-tailed Chinamen, Bush-rangers, and the cradling and the crushing, And nugget-finding in the deep-delved loam, And other strange adventures of your life, As they romanced it; for the less they know, The more their fancy bubbles up and glitters. Yet there you sat, and stammered curt replies As frightened at their feather-heads. They'll vow That my old friends are stupid as myself: And oh, if they had seen what you had seen! If girls might only do what men may do, They would have tongues to tell it. Nothing ails me, He said; I did not know I was so rude: But coming from our rough unmannered life Among a group of happy girls like yours, Free in their innocence, is like the passing, Sudden, from dark into the blaze of noon; Your eyes blink and are blinded. It is long Since I have sat beside pure-hearted maids; And, listening to their words, my thoughts went back To dear old times; I seemed to hear again, Dreamily, echoes of old fireside mirth, And chatter of the table. Was I rude? I did not mean it. Half I envied you, And half I feared that some ill-sorted word Of mine might break the charm. 'Tis strange that we May wallow with the swine, and grunt with them, Till those fair customs which were native to us, Grown unfamiliar, make us pick our steps In fear and silence. Laughing, I replied It was the last thing I'd have dreamed, that he Who, like a young Greek strong in grace of mind And manhood, used to fire young maiden fancies, While he himself was cool amid their tremors, Should sit abashed with home-bred girls. This led To talk of College days and College friends— How one was mossing in a drowsy manse; Another loud on platforms, half a priest, Half demagogue, who played on prejudice With evil skill; another, wigged and gowned, Bade fair to lead the Bar, and win the Bench; And this, a kindly humorist whose speech Was charming to the lecture-hearing Public: Some doctored west-end patients, some the east; While some were dead, and others worse than dead, Turning up, now and then, in rusty black And dirty linen, rubicund of face, Begging a paltry loan. We wondered much How the world-school reversed the classic school, And jumbled reputations; fancied what If, by some chance, another pair were met, That evening, in the bush, beneath the Cross, Or Indian dusky city, or London club, They might of us be saying, as we of them; Then we sat silent, musing for a space. Then he: What came of Muriel Lumisden? You used to haunt the widow's house, I think, With the fair daughters. What a flirt she was! And how she kept a score of silly lads Dangling about her, every one quite sure He was the favoured, and the rest were gulls! Flirting came natural to her; you could see it In every movement, every dainty curl And fold of her black hair, in every tone, And glance and turn of the eyebrows, and in all The gesture of her lithe and supple beauty. To flirt was in the marrow of her bones; Even as a child she'd make eyes to her doll; And just to keep her hand in, I have known her Beam on the butcher's boy a winning glance That sent him half-way heavenward to his calves. And yet there have been times when she has seemed A noble creature to me, all compact Of womanly grace, with heart that answered true To every noblest impulse, and inspired High-souled enthusiasm, till I have felt I could have been content to do some deed That she would smile upon, and then to die, Keeping that smile for ever. How she fooled us! Yet oh how beautiful she was! those eyes Melting with tenderness, or flashing scorn At any baseness, and those lips for all Emotions eloquent! But such a flirt! Hearing this passionate strain, which had been lying In wait for opportunity, I think, All through the night's discourse, the storm broke out So unexpectedly, I called to mind Some passages between them, and the talk That buzzed about them when he went away— How people said that she had wrecked a life Of splendid promise; how they pitied him, All blaming her, and yet they nothing knew, But that he loved, and that he loved in vain, And that he wooed, but had not won her hand, And that he rushed off, when his luck had failed, To the far ends o' the earth. Musing on this, And on his passionate upbraiding now, I marvelled how he kept this open wound Rankling, unhealed, through all the changeful years, Wronging himself and her. What should I say? Better the old pain Custom helps to bear? Or the fresh anguish which the truth will give? So my mind balanced it. But I resolved; Better the truth restoring the old faith, Even though it shame and break him. Then I said: Poor Muriel! so you have not heard her story: And you have held her but a wanton flirt, Heartless, and with her beauty breaking hearts; So high an inspiration, yet so mean A nature too! Well; maybe; only flirts Have not such souls as make one feel one's-self Little beside them—as a rule, at least. And Muriel who, you say, was such a flirt, Rebuked me by the greatness of her soul, And of her sorrow. Shall I tell you what, I fear, may pain alike by gain and loss? Then he: What mean you? Loss is long since lost, And gain can never be from her to me. You knew her not as I did. What remains When bubbles burst i' the hand? not even the glitter. Is she a maiden still, and fancy-free? Why, so am I, and free of her for ever. Is she a widow? I should gain a loss, Indeed, to be her second. Is that your riddle? Or is she mated to a life-long sorrow? What else could come of such a way as hers? Listen, I said: You were not gone a year When one came from New Zealand, who had been Sheep-farming in a patriarchal way To win his Rachel, long since won to love, What time the lad was schooling at her father's. A fine young fellow, cheery as the spring At pairing time, when songs are in the woods, And in the air, and in the furze and broom; Manly and kindly too, and full of trust In Muriel, though she went on as before With speech and smile and charm of witching beauty, And winning manner; but behind the scenes They knew each other, and he knew her love Was his alone. He liked to see her worshipped, Being proud of her, and sure of her. Perhaps She liked, too, being worshipped; who can tell? You say she was a flirt—and you knew best: I tell but what I saw. Well, by and by, The wedding came, and every one was bidden, And every one was there of her old friends, Or lovers, and the joy was very great. But from that moment she became to all The staidest matron, with a kindly distance And dignity of noble womanhood Hedging her round. It seems that he had said She must not play the nun, when he was gone, And sit apart, as ticketed “Engaged,” But take life as it came, like other girls, Not making him, far off, a haunting fear, A shadow on the sunshine of her days, But being joyous in her truth to him, Which was her freedom; so would he be glad, Thinking her glad. A happier man than he Now there was none, nor yet a brighter home Than that she made him, with her pretty ways, And pretty babes, and large intelligence. Pshaw! he broke in; of course, a blessed pair Of doves; the usual fashion; haunted they By no regrets for broken lives, the while They twain sat cooing. Pass to something else; It does not interest me—'tis all so common. Tell me about yourself, for you alone Have made a name that even our wild lads Have kindly in their mouths. But I: Nay, you Must hear me out, seeing I have begun— There came a day when he must go again Back to his flocks: there had been summer droughts That parched the grass, and heavy winter snows, When many weaklings perished in the drift; And over all the Colony a cloud Hung lowering, for the Maori threatened war, Fenced his strong Pah, and sent his fighting men To waste and burn and stealthily to kill So they went off together: at first he urged That she should stay behind, for war was ill To face, with wife and children in the rear Plucking your heart, and savages in front Who had no law or pity: she would find It hard to be alone i' the bush, and quake For her dear babes at every whispering wind, Or rustling leaf, dreading the cunning foe. A year or two, and all would right itself, And he would sell his run, and live at home With nought to do but love her. Thus he spake In reason and right feeling, though his heart Was sore at parting. But she answered him, With the great heart which used to fire our youth: If war were coming, he would better fight That his wife bound his sword on, and was near To bind his wounds, and to call pitying thoughts Up in his mind, amid the storm of wrath, For savage women wailing in their kraals; Exile would be to part her now from him, And home was just where he was; for herself, She would not lose a year of happiness, Nor give a year of loneliness to him, For worlds; and life was there where duty was, Not elsewhere; and their God was also there, I' the bush as in the city. So they sailed In a great ship crowded with emigrants, That down the Mersey dropt with favouring breeze, And ringing cheers upon the crowded wharf, And blinding tears upon the crowded deck, And many hopes, and many a sad regret. But in the night she, bearing down the Channel Through a thick fog, struck on a hidden rock, Yet in a quiet sea. The sailors thought, With the next tide she would be floated off; And many went to sleep again, scarce heeding Whether she sank or swam, if they might rest, And sleep and dream of home. But by and by, The Master grew uneasy, muttered somewhat Of cranky ships that scarce would float in ponds, Dry-rotten in the docks—of useless boats That were but painted tinder; and one heard him Murmur a prayer for wife and babes, the while He paced the deck alone, and resolute Issued his orders. Then a whisper went, Gloomy, that she was leaking, and would soon Break up amidships; but as yet there was No panic, for the land was not far off. But as the day broke, eerie, on the fog, The timbers 'gan to crack, and great seams yawned, And with the rushing tide the terror rose. Then hands unhandy loosed the painted boats, And swamped them; and from near four hundred throats A cry rose to high heaven—a pitiful cry Of anguish that might touch the heart of Fate, As to and fro they reeled, and wrung their hands. Muriel stood with her husband and her babes, Calm, on the poop. She saw the dim grey sea Deceitful, and the shore loomed through the mist, Uncertain, for there was no gleam of light From fisher's hut or farm; a lone waste land Of unthrift and neglected husbandry, Where neither glebe nor sea was harvested. Then, holding fast her little ones, her face Just a shade paler—it was always pale— She said in a low voice: You can swim, Malcolm; The shore is near, I think a sandy shore By the dull thud o' the waves; could you not save Some mother and her child, setting example Others might follow? Oh, we're not afraid, My little ones and I; God cares for us; And you will come too ere the danger comes. The Captain says the ship will float an hour At least, and it is misery to see Those faces, and to hear the bitter cries. Nay, not us first! but speak a word to them, And show them what to do; we can be still, But they are frantic, and their madness works Their ruin; we will wait in patience here. Try, dearest; you are strong and brave; but yet Be not too bold, your life is all to us. Oh, can God hear that cry, and help them not? Fain would he still have borne her first to land With her two boys, but that she would not hear of. Thrice, therefore, from the ship he swam ashore, Burdened with child or mother, or with both; And thrice again he left to seek the ship, Strong swimmer borne up by his work of pity, For nature makes the brave heart strong to save. And, at the next time, Muriel from the poop Lowered the children to his loving arms, Her great eyes swimming in the pride of him And love of them, until she hardly saw Aught else, or heard a warning cry; and then, Just as he, confident and cheerful, held The children, and was waiting for her coming, A spar fell from the falling mast, and smote Him smiling up to her, and with a cry, And flinging up his arms, before her eyes He sank with their two babes. Yet she was spared A tragic agony by tragic fact, For the great ship that instant brake in twain. In death they were not separate; and soon The quiet waters, smiling in the sun, Rippled where they had been. Here Martin rose, Pale as a ghost, and shivering as a reed, Alone in withered Autumn, that is smote By sudden gust of storm. And I have railed, He gasped, at such an one as this! for years Have rated her and called her worthless flirt Who broke my worthless life! have quoted her To lads who still had faith in truth and love, To cure them of their folly, and have held Myself the one wise man! O God, my God! To have so wronged the woman that I loved! To have so 'stranged my nature from all love! To have so grossly slandered truth and love! God's beautiful one!—My broken life, forsooth! O poor self-pitying fool! But lost is lost; And this is gain though it be shame to me, Sorrowful gain by loss of evil thought, And love restored; yet better so restored Amid my self-contempt, than as before Blurred in my self-conceit. O Muriel, yet I loved you through it all—a hateful love! But clinging to thee, seeing no one worthy Save thee, and thee unworthy, and with this So worthless love still wronging thee!—Good-night! I thank you, friend; yes, you have done me good; There's healing in such sorrow; but to-night I could not meet your girls; I have done wrong Unto all women by my thoughts, and dare not Look in their eyes. And I must be alone: Beg my forgiveness; I must be alone; God help me! I will to the old seashore, And hear the dull waves thudding on the sand As my thoughts break in me. O Muriel!— With that he gave my hand a silent grip, And gulping something down, pulled his hat low Over his brows, and strode into the dark. Alone, alone, I fell into a strain Of musing melancholy, Recalling, with keen sense of shame and pain, A man whom, living, I had reckoned vain, And to his calling holy Untrue, until I read, with blinding tears Which give clear sight, the story of his fears And clingings unto God through weary years, Till peace came slowly To him grown meek and lowly. And I have sinned against a soul, I said, Noble and good and true, Whom God has gathered with the blessèd dead, And put the crown of glory on his head, And I am humbled too: But by this shame, O Lord, thou teachest me, He only walks aright who walks with Thee, Meek, in the judgments of that Charity Which unto all is due, And never heart shall rue. STRAY LEAVES NOTE Riding one day from Cairnoch on the hill Across the moor, Dick Ostler flicked the ear Of the brown mare, then jerked his elbow and thumb To bid me note a rounded hill that lay Well to the setting sun, grotesquely planted With various forest trees—oaks, elms, and pines. Upon the lower slopes were hollow squares Just touching each a corner of the other, And in the bay between, a single tree Or little group, but on the heights above Were solid masses, interspersed with some Carelessly strewn about. “Queer woodcraft that,” Dick Ostler said; “and yet I planted them. You see, our last lord went a soldiering In his hot youth, and brave enough he looked, Though not much of a soldier—that needs headpiece; And coming home he took to forestry When I was in my teens. He said the Duke Ordered the battle so at Waterloo, And I must range them like his regiments, Though all the country laughed at him. Ere long He went to Parliament and made a speech, Although he was no Senator—that too Needs headpiece; and he wanted me to plant The speakers and the members as they sat To hear his oratory; but that I would not; And that was how I took to horses, sir,— Me who had lived in forests all my days, And loved the trees, and knew their forms and times, And every sound of every swinging branch When the wind blew; and I must handle brutes! Because my lord would have it he must serve The nation fighting, though he was no soldier, Or parliamenting, though he could not speak! If he had just believed that God made some To stay at home, and see the farming done, And look to cottar's houses, and consort With neighbours on the market-days! But he, He was my lord, and must as other lords, And would have writ his foolish life in trees Sprawling about the estate for folk to laugh at. That's how I took to horses.” Then he gave The Brown another flick on the left ear, And screwed his face into a look of strong Disgust. I laughed, and vowed I did not wonder At his displeasure; but he set me musing: Had not my old friend writ his life likewise, Planting along its paths a little border Of verses like so many daisy-flowers In memory of his failures. He was not A preacher, though he writ some sermons, nor A politician, though he joined a party, And did it service. Better sure for him Had he believed God makes some men to write, And brighten life with gleams of better life, Or oil its wheels with humour. So it seemed To me, when turning over articles, Reviews and essays, and the odds and ends Of verse, that lay among them all confused, Whereof some samples follow, like the thrums Remaining when the web has been wrought out. MISS PENELOPE LEITH Last heiress she of many a rood, Where Ugie winds through Buchan braes— A treeless land, where beeves are good, And men have quaint old-fashioned ways, And every burn has ballad-lore, And every hamlet has its song, And on its surf-beat rocky shore The eerie legend lingers long. Old customs live there, unaware That they are garments cast away, And what of light is shining there Is lingering light of yesterday. Never to her the new day came, Or if it came she would not see; This world of change was still the same To our old-world Penelope: New fashions rose, old fashions went, But still she wore the same brocade, With lace of Valenciennes or Ghent More dainty by her darning made; A little patch upon her face, A tinge of colour on her cheek, A frost of powder, just to grace The locks that time began to streak. A stately lady; to the poor Her manner was with out reproach; But from the causeway she was sure To snub the Provost in his coach: In pride of birth she did not seek Her scorn of upstarts to conceal, But of a Bailie's wife would speak As if she bore the fisher's creel. She said it kept them in their place, Their fathers were of low degree; She said the only saving grace Of upstarts was humility. The quaint, old Doric still she used, And it came kindly from her tongue; And oft the “mim-folk” she abused, Who mincing English said or sung: She took her claret, nothing loath, Her snuff that one small nostril curled; She might rap out a good round oath, But would not mince it for the world: And yet the wild word sounded less In that Scotch tongue of other days; 'Twas just like her old-fashioned dress, And part of her old-fashioned ways. At every fair her face was known, Well-skilled in kyloes and in queys: And well she led the fiddler on To “wale” the best of his strathspeys; Lightly she held the man who rose While the toast-hammer still could rap, And brought her gossip to a close, Or spoilt her after-dinner nap; Tea was for women, wine for men, And if they quarrelled o'er their cups, They might go to the peat-moss then, And fight it out like stags or tups. She loved a bishop or a dean, A surplice or a rochet well, At all the Church's feasts was seen, And called the Kirk, Conventicle; Was civil to the minister, But stiff and frigid to his wife, And looked askance, and sniffed at her, As if she lived a dubious life. But yet his sick her cellars knew, Well stored from Portugal or France, And many a savoury soup and stew Her game-bags furnished to the Manse. But if there was a choicer boon Above all else she would have missed, It was on Sunday afternoon To have her quiet game at whist Close to the window, when the Whigs Were gravely passing from the Kirk, And some on foot, and some in gigs, Would stare at her unhallowed work: She gloried in her “devil's books” That cut their sour hearts to the quick; Rather than miss their wrathful looks She would have almost lost the trick. Her politics were of the age Of Claverhouse or Bolingbroke; Still at the Dutchman she would rage, And still of gallant Grahame she spoke. She swore 'twas right that Whigs should die Psalm-snivelling in the wind and rain, Though she would ne'er have harmed a fly For buzzing on the window pane. And she had many a plaintive rhyme Of noble Charlie and his men: For her there was no later time, All history had ended then. The dear old sinner! yet she had A kindly human heart, I wot, And many a sorrow she made glad, And many a tender mercy wrought: And though her way was somewhat odd, Yet in her way she feared the Lord, And thought she best could worship God By holding Pharisees abhorred, By being honest, fearless, true, And thorough both in word and deed, And by despising what is new, And clinging to her old-world creed. WAGSTAFF With supple form, and radiant face, And shock of swirling Auburn hair, And brown plaid, worn with careless grace, He sauntered, loitering every where; For his swift-glancing eye must look On all that met him by the way, And every street was like a book Which he could read the live-long day: Nor sun nor moon nor star nor chime Set punctual tide for him or time, For all his habits were at strife With orderly mechanic life; And in the Mart when he was seen, Where sharp wits drove their bargains keen, His wayward thoughts were oft astray, Brooding with Ruskin on St. Mark's, Or dreaming on some broomy brae Among the linnets and the larks. No flower that in the garden grows But all its way of life he knew, No wilding in the green hedgerows But he could tell its story true; And where birds nestled, how they sung, And where to find the honey bees, What varying notes were heard among The beech-woods and the stiff pine trees, All sights and sounds of Nature, well Their nicest difference he could tell; For where the careless footstep trod He saw the glory and power of God. All beauty thrilled him like the kiss Of young love in its early bliss; And so his life had great delight, For beauty everywhere he met; A moss would make his eye grow bright, A cowslip or a violet. The music of the ancient days, The pictures of the age of faith, When Song was still the voice of Praise, And Worship had its vital breath In forms of loveliness divine— Virgin and babe of tender grace— He would be drunken as with wine On holy hymn or saintly face. And oh to hear him (when he met, With some new loan, an ancient debt) Come back to Keats's picture-words Like flowers and fruits and singing birds; Or Wordsworth's touch of Truth, who saw All nature wrapt in love and awe; Or Shelley's strains, like lark unseen In mystic sweetness rippling on; Or the choice words, and vision keen, And perfect art of Tennyson! He had large wealth of curious lore, And freely would his wealth dispense, And still his speech suggested more Than lay in its familiar sense; And we who gathered round him, young And eager, inspiration caught From broken fragments which he sung, Or glimpses of far-reaching thought. In letters some, and some in Art, And some in Science took their part; But all ascribed to him that they Had found their true life and its way: Meanwhile he struggled lonely, poor, Indebted, slighted, and obscure, And went through darkness into rest; But yet his thoughts with us abide; He lives in us, when we are best, He is but changed and multiplied. PEPPE Ugly was not the word for Peppe: His cheek was scarred with a crimson gash, He had squinting eyes, and a limping step, And a long lip furzed with a red moustache, Sharp-pointed teeth, like a saw, and black Finger-nails, like a vulture's claw, And all the skin of him spotted and slack, Like a mouldy old parchment deed of the law. Yet never a maiden had silkier curls Scented and glossy and soft as a dove; And never silkier voice among girls Lisped, in soft accents, of beauty and love; Oiliest curls, and the oiliest speech Talking the wildest thoughts ever I heard— Thoughts of a kind it were fitter to screech, Dropt like the notes of a singing bird. Softly he spoke about fell Revolutions, Of Rank, Rule, and Title and Capital gone, Swift overthrow of our old institutions, And blood from the Barricades splashing the throne, Burning of churches, and burying gods, Treating the priests like the rats in their holes, Ruin of all our old life with its modes Of building up order, and saving of souls. Sometimes he went off, when little expected, But to come back, when as little desired, Now looking haggard and lean and dejected, Tricked now in garb that he plainly admired; Leaving, he went where no seeking could find him, Returning, no care could escape from his view, And when he went, he left trouble behind him, And coming back, he brought trouble anew. For, be his luck what it might, we were sure Storms would be brewing the moment he came, Chills would be falling on friendships pure, Doubts would be cast upon some honoured name: Mischief followed wherever he went, And some bright eyes would with tears be dim; And yet he looked smiling and innocent, And we never could bring the thing home to him. Last time we met was in seventy-two, Just when the mad Commune had burst; Jewelled and furred like a Rotterdam Jew, Hardly I knew the fellow at first; But he came up with a smile, and a look Nothing could ever the least embarrass, Saying, “Ah! here is your wished-for Book, And I picked it up at the siege of Paris.” Eh? was I wrong to give him his price, Instead of giving him straight in charge? A book so scarce it was only twice Offered for sale to the world at large! Ah! I so longed for it! just at the sight, I felt a knocking about my knee:— And in the fury of that wild night, Strange that the rogue should have thought about me! I knew that one in the Louvre lay:— Oh what a hang-dog look he had! And something within me tried to say, “Now, if you buy it you're just as bad.” Yet I must have it; there is a score Will give him his money if I refuse— To think of me, now, in that wild uproar! And he saved it perhaps from the Petroleuse! JOHN MEFF, M.A. Alas! he had outlived respect, And the sharp sting of cold neglect, And cared not wisely to reflect Upon his ways, Or to look back, or to expect More happy days. Once a rare scholar, ripe and full, Famed Latinist in Classic School, Whose biting satire scourged a fool With lash of scorn: An Epigrammatist by rule, And native-born; Well could he tilt, and featly hit Opponents with quotation fit Of Attic or Horatian wit That made them wince, Nor heeded if his weapon smit Or Priest or Prince. Well could he, too, with mocking lip, Sneer at the sciolists who slip On niceties of scholarship, Nor would abate The lash of that contemptuous whip For love or hate. So wrath had gathered round his life, And love had fallen away, and strife Had grown its crop of quarrels rife Until he stood, Having nor lover, friend, nor wife, In solitude. Then nights and suppers, deemed divine Symposia of Falernian wine, And Syren songs that turn to swine Who list to hear, To these he greatly did incline Both heart and ear: At first with shame; but soon he fell A willing captive to their spell, And grew a taproom Oracle To yokels fuddled, Or mad with fiery drink, or well With beer bemuddled. Now far from him Professor's chair, And High School with its classic air, And to the Kirk he may not dare Lift up his hopes; For he is bound to shame and care By devil's ropes. Yet far away in moorland cot Where first he tasted life's hard lot, His early promise, ne'er forgot, Has ne'er grown dim, And there is still a bright green spot On earth for him. All else forgetting—pride of fame, A happy home, an honoured name, And God and truth, and praise and blame, He will not let His frail old mother know the shame Of want, or debt. She wots not how his days are spent, But fails not of her yearly rent, Nor homely fare, nor clothing sent From him threadbare, Nor weekly letter kindly meant To ease her care. And still she tells of him with pride, How with the minister he vied In learning, and had never lied As boy or man, Nor from his mother aught would hide Since life began. A dutiful and loving son! A scholar who great fame had won! She other wish on earth had none Except to reach Some place, before her race was run, To hear him preach! O mystic shuttles, how ye dart Through life's dim web! O thou that art Still clinging to a better part 'Mid all thy wrong! And oh the pathos of the heart, Believing long! LATTO A deep grey eye, a meek grey face, Grey sandy hair and garb worn grey, A limp loose form, a hurried pace That loitered never by the way, And knew no leisure and no play; A wistful look of painèd thought, As if he must, yet feared to think, For his too daring Reason wrought Dread of itself, as on the brink Of chasms from which he fain would shrink: Much-pondering, his soul could see But God in all the things that be, In subtle matter, and changeful force, In joy and anguish and remorse; No dual empire could he find, But all was matter, and all was mind. So had he lost his early faiths, And glory of his simple youth, And this had been like many deaths, Though dying into larger truth. This world, he said, all things divine Are but the great God's uttered thought: His work is not like thine or mine Which brains have planned, and tools have wrought; It is, yet out of Him is not. He makes the light, He makes the shade That limits it with form; yet light Is nothing but the ripple made By rhythmic motion, giving sight And wondrous vision of delight. And shadow too is noting. Why, My shadow surely is not I; 'Tis nothing; yet I make it; well My form and features it shall tell, And yet I use no art to make This nothing, which for me you take.— Thus dreamily the mystic spoke, And ever as his thought was spent, It rose again like wave that broke In never-ending argument. For all his thoughts of soul and mind Were shaped by hard material law; And yet no matter could he find, But mind created what it saw, And of its shadows stood in awe: And God was all. The solid earth, The rivers and the shining seas, And all to which the heavens gave birth, And all the rocks and hills and trees, And grass and flowers and birds and bees, All were but pictured thoughts which shone As sparks from rapid wheel are thrown, And gleam out in the dark, and then Pass into nothingness again. Yet while the world he thus refined Into fine forms of subtle mind, The subtle mind he made again Gross by material forms of thought, And chemic forces in the brain Our vices and our virtues wrought. Still gathering knowledge, day by day, Unwearying in his search for light, He gathered scruples by the way, Till scarce one way of life seemed right, And he was in a helpless plight. He scrupled at the Church's creed, Although he held her mission grand; He scrupled at all paths which lead To honour in an ancient land Whose bridges have the ages spanned: He scrupled at the tricks and lies, Unscrupulous, of merchandise; And while all science he pursued, He held no art or practice good, Till, as by threads of cob-web dim, All paths of life seemed shut to him; For still the scrupulous conscience stood And barred the way when it should lead, And made him helpless unto good, That he from evil might be freed. Fain would we laugh his scruples down, But there his truth rebuked our mirth; He sought not riches or renown Nor any fatness of the earth, Might he but keep his honest worth; No envy had he of the great, No drop of bitterness had he, He was contented with the state Of noble-minded poverty, Well-pleased of no account to be. To hammer great thoughts out of stones, And fossil leaves, and scales and bones; To give imagination wings, And frame the universe of things From chaos, or from nothing—that Was all he cared to labour at. And so he drifted still along, Having no social roots or ties, Self-fettered by his scruples strong, Yet making many good and wise. MOTHER-IN-LAW O my boy! O my heart, it will break! And how like his father he sat! So cruel and cold! and his voice did not shake, When he shattered my life and my hope, for the sake Of a creature like that! Not that it matters how soon My poor dregs of life may depart: What are we mothers made for, but to croon A soft cradle-song to a low cradle-tune, With a slow-breaking heart? O Woman! whose love is thy life, Thy love-life is sorrow and pain; As the girl's love dawns, so her troubles grow rife, And they darken on down through the mother and wife, Drip-dripping like rain, O my boy! and I hoped, when they brought My baby to lie on my breast, Now, at length, I shall find all the love I have sought, Now, at length, I shall bask in the bliss I have got, And my heart shall have rest. From me thy life came, and by me Shall its young powers be nourished, alone; No wanton shall poison its pure springs to thee With milk of coarse passion, but it shall all be Sweet and clean as my own. And so, with pained pleasure, he drew His life, day by day, out of mine, And mine was the one tender hand that he knew: I suffered none else, for his kiss was like dew, And his breath like sweet wine. O my beauty! my hero! What dreams I dreamed, as he smiled in my face! What hopes lit my life as with laughing sun-gleams, When I kissed into silence his lustiest screams With a mirthful embrace. Now, I pictured him soldier of fame Battling on in the thick of the fight; Now, a statesman whose eloquence kindled a flame That fired all the land, till they shouted his name As the symbol of right. Then I sighed, and said, Let him be good, And I heed not what else is in store: But ah! that was not what the mother's heart would, And still it went back to its loftier mood, And panted for more. And what, if God, wroth at my pride, Has humbled me now for my sin? For I knew in my heart, when I said it, I lied And I knew it was dull moral prosing to hide The proud thought within. I gave up all, all for my boy— All the world where, they said, I once shone; And the girl-wife, tremulous, timid and coy, Grew strong in the pride of a mother's great joy, And for him lived alone. I grudged every moment away, I grudged every task not for him; As he lay on my lap, I would croodle and play, As he lay in soft sleep, I would watch him and pray Till my wet eyes grew dim. I grudged even his father, when he Would toss up my child in the air, Or when he would ride the high-horse on his knee, Or the little one laughed aloud in his glee, As he tangled his hair. But sometimes, I thought, it were good That another should come to divide This so jealous love with its passionate mood; Yet what other baby, like him, ever could Be my joy and my pride? Then I'd clasp him close to my breast, And kiss him, body and limb; It was wicked to dream even, or say it in jest, That another could ever be fondly caressed With the love I gave him. And then as he grew up apace, I went back to schooling once more, And took up old studies of number and case, And the great tale of Troy, and of that haughty race By the brown Tiber's shore. For I trembled to think he might read What from youth should be hidden with care, And be smirched with some grossness of word or deed, Or filled with false thoughts, that, like thistle-down seed, Fly about in the air. O my boy! Oh the bliss of those days, When I pored o'er his Latin and Greek! And I knew all his thoughts, and I saw all his plays, And I noted him manly and bright in his ways, And gentle and meek. And now comes this woman to steal All the fruit of my life and its bliss, All the joy and the hope that I ever shall feel, And plants me a death-wound, nothing can heal, With her Judas-like kiss. She is years and years older than he, And has trapped him, I know, with her guile, For there's nothing he'll hear now, and nothing will see But goodness in her, and unfairness in me, As he basks in her smile. Poor boy! if you knew! That wan smile Has been tried upon scores before you; 'Tis a well-worn look, you might see by its style, Has done duty for years, for her eyes, the meanwhile, Are not smiling nor true. Charm! ay, such as practised ones wield; With a hard, hungry look in her eye, And a lithe, supple form, and a heart that is steeled, Which no love can touch, and which no love will yield, Till the day that she die. Of course he must marry her now; He has gone quite too far to draw back; But oh, what a sorrow is hid in the vow To love the unloving, and make his heart bow To the yoke till it crack! She has poisoned his mind against me, And will poison it more if she can: Oh that poor jealous heart of hers! Can he not see, It is not like a mother's? But no one can be Half so blind as a man. No; their wedding I will not go near; I never will darken her door, Nor break bread of hers, nor partake of her cheer— Far rather I'd follow my boy on his bier To his rest evermore! I have thought, if I only could see A baby of his in my lap, A baby of his smiling up from my knee, Oh, to nurse both mother and baby would be The blessedest hap! But she! that woman! her child! Do you wonder it makes me sad, When I know that my boy has been so beguiled? It is weeks and months since ever I've smiled, And it's making me bad. She is deep—Oh, she well knows her game!— And is ever so gentle and meek; She sees I don't like her; but loves all the same Every one that he loves, every one of his name, All the days of the week! And that drives me mad, for I know He believes every word that she says. If only by word or by look she would show The false, scheming heart that is hidden below Her soft, silky ways! And her cunning is breeding hate, And wickedest thoughts in me: She might be another man's happy mate, But to me and my house she is like a dark Fate That I shudder to see. God, keep me from sin and wrath: Had I lived in the old Greek time When hate killed the King of men in his bath, I too might have sown the dread aftermath Of a horrible crime! Who knows what one might have been? Who knows what the heart might do? Oh the thoughts of guilt I have sometimes seen, Trying the shape of their guilt to screen From my doubtful view! And my husband goes, meanwhile, Careless and easy of heart, Daffing my cares with a mocking smile; Ay, that was ever his hateful style Of playing his part. And my boy grows like him in that, Liker him every day; And oh so cruel and cool as he sat! And oh so light he jested at What I tried to say. Once how I hoped he would wed— For I know that she loves him dear— That saintly child of the sainted dead! They were born for each other, I always said, The self-same year. But my wishes are nothing to him: I am blind, of course, as a bat, For my eyes with the tears of love are dim; And my cup of sorrow is filled to the brim— For a creature like that. O mothers! whose love is such bliss While the baby lies soft on your knee, With each fond word, and each rapturous kiss, Ye are sowing the seeds of a grief like this Which has come to me. FATHER-IN-LAW Never mind what your mother may say: She was always hard on the girls: Your virtuous women have all a way Of saying the bitterest things they may About them and their curls. It is different, now, with a man: The better he is, I think, He'll speak of young fellows the best that he can, Though the rogues may be learning to curse and ban, And play, too, and drink. Well; that never struck me until I said it, and yet it is true; Good men could not do what your good women will, And they call it a duty they have to fulfil In pure love to you. I am not good, myself, as you know, And I never pretended to be; And I've sometimes thought I was happier so Than to purse up my mouth, and look glum as I go At the things that I see. But your mother is virtuous, lad; Whatever she is, she is that; A virtuous woman, for good or bad, And she's fretting her soul, till it's really sad, At this wooing you're at. She won't let me rest till I speak My mind on't, and here's what I say: Maybe her reasons are poor and weak, And she's hot and hysteric, and not very meek; But she'll have her own way. Don't insist upon your way, at least, It was always my plan to give in, And to make as if I would do as she pleased, Till she cooled down a bit; for her keenness ceased As she thought she would win. Well; I know that she always meant You, some day or other, should wed That putty-faced doll of a baby-saint, With her breath smelling ever so sickly and faint, As if more than half-dead. I am glad you are out of that mess; It would never have turned out well: She has not the breeding, the mouth, or the pace, And what your mother can see in her face I never could tell. And it's right you should choose your own wife; I did it, and every man should; It is hard that another should tie you for life, Maybe to bother, vexation, and strife: Though she means it for good. But you'd better give up your first “flame,” Nearly every man does that I know; Your mother is wild when I name but her name, And it would not be nice for a girl, if she came To be ill-treated so. I allow she is quiet and good, And handsome and ladylike too, She can ride too, and talk and dress as she should, And she is not at all of hysterical mood, And you say she loves you. But your mother can't bear her, you see; That don't go for much, I admit; Our mothers are fain we should always be Still the small babies that sat on their knee, Admiring their wit. But I'm told she is older than you; Of course, that's a matter of taste, And old or young, they will always do Just what they like; yet it's also true You should not be in haste. If she had but a trifle of cash! I don't mind the two or three years; They're not here or there; but it's something rash To dive into wedlock, you see, with a splash, When, for aught that appears, You have not between you, I think, Enough to pay for your tour; And how you're to live, and to eat and drink, Is more than I know; but it's all rose-pink To-day, to be sure. Now, I have not a shilling to spare, Not a penny to play pitch-and-toss; And you'd not like your mother to sit down with care Before she is Dowager, and you are heir Of the peat-hag and moss. You must not count on me: I never could keep out of debt; But I'll leave you a name, and a family tree Long held in honour, and bills two or three That are not honoured yet. There's the old coach I had to renew, The horses not fit for the road, And the cellar quite empty; and what could I do? For the rents were all spent ere a guinea was due, When I last went abroad. You'd not wish to see me drive out With a chaise, and a pair of old screws, And bring from the grocer's a bottle of stout; No, there's things one must have, and yet cannot, without The help of the Jews. But one should be able to do Without luxuries, now, like books, And pictures and china and ormolu, And a wife that will always want something new, For her handsome looks. Have you thought at all how you're to live, With taxes to pay, and your rent? You may run into debt, and your tradesmen grieve; With your name, you may borrow, although you must give A heavy per cent. But it's ticklish work doing that long, And you can't trust the cards or the dice, And betting without ready money is wrong; And what can you do that is worth an old song, When you've tried it twice? A Lawyer that has but one brief, A Doctor one patient who tends, May marry, in hope that in turning the leaf, By healing a fool, or releasing a thief, He may make what the spends. But there's no kind of work now for you, And nothing to hope that I see, Unless I should die for fond lovers and true, Which is hard for a man in his sixties to do, With but gout in his knee. You must think of it better; and mind, Not a word to your mother that's rough: She is hot and hysterical, maybe, and blind, But then she's your mother, and ever was kind; And that is enough. DAUGHTER-IN-LAW So, there; you have told me all; And you want to know what we must do; Your love is great, but your purse is small, And you leave me free, if I like, to fall From my word to you. But what, if I am not free To take my freedom again? What, if this foolish heart in me Rather far would be bound than be Without its chain? It is not the promise that binds, But the love that changeth not; And pledges taken of faithless minds I hold them but as the idle winds, Heard, and forgot. I am bound, be your lot what it may, Bound fast, for I would not be free, Bound by the love that will have its own way, And will hold me for ever, whatever you say, And whatever you be. Would you be richer without The love I have given to you? Would you be abler to go about, Doing your work without fear or doubt, Were I less true? Ah! well; it might break my heart, But yet I could let it break, If I thought you would play a nobler part, While I pined away with this love-sick dart, And its life-long ache. You would not? Your life would be wrecked? Nay, I dare not say that: yet I fear It would not be good for your soul to reflect, How the bloom and the glory of love had been checked In the spring o' the year. It is bad, having once known the right, And the impulse of nobleness prized, To accept the less worthy, and order the fight For a cause that is meaner, and walk by a light That you once had despised. I am not afraid to be poor, I am not afraid of toil, With you I could labour, with you too endure; But I fear to lose what keeps the flame of life pure As with sacredest oil. But we must not hurry or fret, Or think of ourselves alone; Love waits for love, though the sun be set, And the stars come out, and the dews are wet, And the night winds moan. That which is thine must be mine— Home and friends and affairs, Father and mother—mine and thine; I have thy love, but I long and pine To have also theirs. Your mother dislikes me, I see; Her face is hard and set The moment she enters a room with me; But if love will do it, I mean that she Shall love me yet. Be still, and wait for the light; It is hard for a mother to part With the son who made her life full and bright, And to think that another woman has right To his whole true heart. I know what you must be to her, For I know what you are now to me; I can feel how her bosom must throb and stir, As if some robber of love I were With a master-key. But I will not part her and you: I could not enter a home To sever old ties so tender and true; Yea, let me rather bring fresh and new For the days to come. Ah me! we are often unkind, We who live for our love alone: We think of ourselves, and are cold and blind To the anxious heart, and the troubled mind Half-turned to stone. Like the dew in the heart of the flower That bends with its burden of bliss, Folding it close in the petalled bower, You have lain in her heart from the first mother-hour And the first mother-kiss. And now from that heart's warm core Shall I drain off its fondly-clasped joy? Nay, but you shall be only her gladness more Than all that you ever have been before As a man or a boy. Do you know that I like her the best? Your father is nice and free, With his pleasant talk and his light-some jest, But he speaks and smiles unto all the rest As he does to me: While she has a freezing look Whenever I come her way, And the formal speech of a printed book— Though I see, with a friend in a quiet nook She is bright and gay. But I know 'tis her love of you That makes her distrust me so; And I like her for that, for I love you too, And I think that her love of me will be as true When she comes to know. Daughter to her I will be, Love me she shall in the end; Thoughtful and dutiful, you shall see My love will find out the way, and she Shall call me a friend. Let her be cross for a while, I will only be sweeter for that; Let her frown if she will, I will meekly smile, And let her scold, I will walk a mile To be rated at. But love me she shall, if her heart Is as true as I think it to be; Be patient, and see how I play my part, And oh, my love will have perfect art, When I think of thee! A MINISTER'S DILEMMA “Does any one forbid the banns?” I asked; and something in me cried, And cried: Yea, I forbid this man's Unloving claim to loveless bride. She is my friend's; he loved her well, And they were plighted years ago, And still their coming marriage bell Rings hope into his heart, I know. I cannot join this alien pair, I cannot say the wedding prayer; I cannot lie; nor God nor man Could ever make them truly one: Her face is pale, her hand is cold, Not love has brought her here, but gold.— I paused; and all was still as death; I looked around, but where was he? I watched the quick heave of her breath; She dare not lift her eye to me. 'Twas all a lie—the solemn vow, The orange-blossom and the veil, And wedding-ring; the prayer, I trow, Came from me sobbing, like a wail For broken faith that breaketh hearts; There was no blessing in its words, There was no oneness in its parts, It was a jar of broken chords. THE RIVAL BROTHERS There were two brothers loved a maid, Well-a-day! Side by side they had grown and played, Yet were not liker than sun and shade: And the woods are green in May. One was lord of the house and lands, Well-a-day! From the heather hill to the rippled sands, But the other he had the brains and hands; And the woods are green in May. One was sullen and hard and proud, Well-a-day! The other he mixed with the common crowd, Blythe as the lark that singeth loud, When the woods are green in May. Oh, a maiden's love must be wooed with care, Well-a-day! It flits like the pewit here and there, Hard to follow, and swift to scare; And the woods are green in May. A maiden's love has its dainty wiles, Well-a-day! Its glances coy, and its mocking smiles, And is fain to linger by lanes and stiles, When the woods are green in May. The laird he came with a high demand, Well-a-day! And mickle he spake of his house and land, And the braes that sloped to the bonnie sand; And the woods so green in May. Lightly she laughed at the laird that morn, Well-a-day! When I sell my love, she said with scorn, It shall be for more than cows and corn; And the woods are green in May. When I sell my love the price I set, Well-a-day! It will be an earl's fair coronet, But it is not going to market yet; And the woods are green in May. Ah! Fate is subtle and deep and dark, Well-a-day! 'Tis not on the ship that he sets his mark, But on the tree that shall wreck the barque, When the woods are green in May. Oh, the rotten plank in her life was laid, Well-a-day! That day when the light heart gaily said His cowsand corn might not buy a maid, And the woods are green in May. Merrily by the trysting tree, Well-a-day! She told the tale, and they laughed with glee That night, the winsome brother and she, When the woods were green in May. They went to the Kirk in the summer tide, Well-a-day! A gallant lover and graceful bride, Walking together side by side, Oh, the woods are green in May. They went to the Kirk and vowed the vow, Well-a-day! And none was there but the priest, I trow, And the blackbird singing upon the bough, And the woods are green in May. Oh, love is sweet with its trust complete, Well-a-day! And the rains may fall, and the sun may beat, But it cares not either for cold or heat; And the woods are green in May. He had the brains, and he had the hands, Well-a-day! But he was not lord of the house and lands, And the bonnie green braes by the yellow sands, And the woods are green in May. To London town their steps were bent, Well-a-day! To the weary London streets they went, And all but their wealth of love was spent Ere the woods were green in May. He would coin his thoughts into heaps of gold, Well-a-day! For his hope was high, and his heart was bold.— How oft is the tragic story told! And the woods are green in May. Years came and went, and youths were men, Well-a-day! They were ageing now who were stalwart then, And the laird like an old bear kept his den, Though the woods were green in May. Grim as a bear in his chimney nook, Well-a-day! With a curse on his lip, and a frown in his look, And a pipe and a mug and a great clasped book; And the woods are green in May. A widow came with her sunny child, Well-a-day! And oh but her face it was meek and mild! And white as the daisy undefiled When the woods are green in May. With a woeful heart that was like to break, Well-a-day! She prayed him, when she died, to take Her little boy, for his father's sake; And the woods are green in May. Might she but keep him for a space, Well-a-day! Till heaven should take her, in its grace, Again to look on her dear lord's face; And the woods are green in May. Or if, alas! that might not be, Well-a-day! She would be content her boy to see Now and then by the trysting tree, Where the woods were green in May. It's oh so wily he smiled, and grim, Well-a-day! The while she pleaded so meek with him, And her eyes with the great salt tears grew dim And the woods are green in May. Wily and hard, as he thought of that, Well-a-day! He had been cunningly plotting at: “So that,” he said, “is your bastard brat”; And the woods are green in May. “'Twas an ill market, I'll be sworn, Well-a-day! When you sold your love for a wanton's scorn, Which you would not sell for my cows and corn”; And the woods are green in May. Oh, pale as death was her lily-white cheek, Well-a-day! And then it flushed with a crimson streak, And the flash of her eye was no longer meek; And the woods are green in May. And the glance of her scorn he ill could brook, Well-a-day! Crouching there in the chimney nook With his pipe and his mug and his great clasped book; O the woods are green in May! She turned her right and round about, Well-a-day! She could not breathe for a fearful doubt, Yet oh so stately as she went out, And the woods are green in May. Stately and grand she turned from him, Well-a-day! But her head was dizzy, her eyes were dim, As she dragged her steps through the meadows trim; O the woods are green in May! The steers were slumbering in the shade, Well-a-day! And she saw the deer in leafy glade 'Mong the tall green fern and the foxglove wade; And the woods are green in May. But straight to the ivied Kirk she went, Well-a-day! And her thin hand shook, and her heart grew faint As over the great paged book she bent; And the woods are green in May. For wedding record there was none, Well-a-day! And the grey old priest was dead and gone, And she was a widow and all alone: And the woods are green in May. “O mother, your hand it is cold as stone, Well-a-day! O mother, your grip it will crush my bone, But I would not heed if you would not moan”; And the woods are green in May. “He did not mean it—he could not know,” Well-a-day! She groaned, and her voice was hollow and low, And her face was set with a death-like woe: O the woods are green in May. “My boy, your father loved us well, Well-a-day! You never must dream he had that to tell Which might have sunk a soul to hell.” O the woods are green in May. She led him out by the low kirk-door, Well-a-day! She led him down to the yellow shore, And they were not heard of evermore. But the woods were green in May.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NORTH COUNTRY FOLK WEE CURLY POW Off with you, wee Curly Pow; off, little kitten, to bed; You'll not leave a beard on my chin, and you'll not leave a hair on my head, If you kiss me and tousle me so—there; already it's bald on the crown, And once it was thatched like a haystack, the fuzziest head in the town. Will I kiss you in bed to-night? Of course, I will, when you're asleep; And you'll know it, because you will dream of angels that stand and weep O'er chatterboxes that won't go to bed when they ought to go, And all these angels have beards that are three days old or so— You do not believe that angels ever have beards; they fly With beautiful wings, and their hair is like sunbeams up in the sky? Oh, you're a learned wee maidie; but yet it may well be true That I do not know about angels so well, my darling, as you. There; off with you now; that's the last, the very last kiss you shall get, And mind you, I will not be cheated, you're twenty at least, in my debt. Draw your chair nearer the fire, friend; there is a storm in the air: Hark! how the sea is moaning: God help the fisher-folk there Out in their crazy old boats, for we shall have wind and snow Soon from the north-east driving, if aught of the weather I know. But the bickering log is pleasant, with the collie coiled on the rug, And the kettle there on the hob to brew us a steaming mug. What! no more brewing to-night? you would rather be still and brood? So be it; and well I can guess what has started your thinking mood. You are wondering who that child is, and what she can be to me, A dull old bachelor here in the farmhouse down by the sea? A niece, a cousin perhaps? you had no ill thoughts in your head: If you had, you would only have thought what scores of people have said. Nay, no apology; none is needed: I've learnt to bear Harder suspicion than yours, sir, and never to turn a hair. I've nothing to be ashamed of; if all the truth were known, It may even go to my credit, when God and I reckon alone; Only that, good folk tell me, is hardly an orthodox thought:— Not that I care, in the least, sir, whether it be so or not; People here are afraid to utter a word out of joint, But for me, I am far and away beyond our minister's point: Trouble has taught me, like Job, that sometimes the veriest lies Get them a hiding beneath the well-ordered words of the wise; And wee Curly Pow is my darling, wee Curly Pow is my bliss! God gave me her in my sorrow, as one seals love with a kiss. Oh, my Lizzie! my Lizzie! yet Lizzie never was mine, Except as the thing that we love is ours by a right divine, Except as the beauty of nature is his who has eyes to see, Though not an acre he owns, nor so much as a bush or a tree; And so my Lizzie is mine by the love which for her I bore, Yea, a possession which nothing can rob me of evermore. Perhaps I should tell you the story: it is an old one now, And it calls up things that are best left sleeping, I think; for they grow Into hard thoughts when you stir them, mudding your life again, Just when it seems to be settling, and clearing off sorrow and pain. No matter; you have a right to know what it all may mean, For you are my friend, and a friend should see what there is to be seen: One should have no dark closets locked in his heart to hide Aught from the wife of his bosom, or from the friend he has tried. It is some ten years now since Lizzie—Pet's mother, you know— Came to be servant at Blavick—that's the next farm as you go Landward, maybe a mile hence; perched on a bit of a hill Down which brattles the brook that drives the wheel of our mill; Worst farmed land hereabout, all scarred like a pock-pitted face Grey and unwholesome to look at; poor soil it is at the best, But starved too, for money is scarce there, and work not so pleasant as rest. Anyhow Lizzie came there, at Lammas some ten years past, As bonny a lass as you'd see, sir, and clever and merry and chaste; At kirk or at market you could not meet such another, nor find At kirn or wedding to dance with a partner so to your mind, Always so tidy and neat, and always as blithe as a bird, With a ready laugh for your joke, and as ready a word for your word. Blavick's wife was a slut—or she had been, for now she was dead, And Lizzie, you see, had come to keep house for him in her stead— Sluttish women are mostly fat, of a rosy tint, But she was a black-a-vised person, bony and hard as flint: Yet such a house as she kept, sir! pigs and hens and dogs Littered the floors along with the milk-pails, peats, and logs; Hard to pick your way through, for the place was dark with smoke, And that had been hard to breathe, but mostly a window was broke. Oh the dust on the settle! oh the soot on the wall! And oh the dirt in the dairy, that was the worst of all! I wondered how she could live in it, not at all that she died; But for long years she had lost all a woman's natural pride. Blavick himself was always lounging about the place, A hulking lump of a man, with a huge expanse of face: And if talk could have done it, all would soon have come right. How he did talk, to be sure, through the long day and the night! Maundering on about lime and guanos, rotation of crops, Soils and subsoils, and ploughs, and the makers of them and their shops, And all the new-fangled ways! but none of the old-fashioned work Ever he put his hands to: there was not a rake or a fork, Plough or harrow that was not broken, and out of repair Just when they needed it most, and waste was everywhere. But Lizzie began at once to make everything nice and clean, To put everything in the house in its place where it should have been; Pity the pig that ventured to grunt inside of her door! Pity the hen that entered where it used to cackle before! The kitchen was like a parlour, none of them dared to tread With mucky shoes on her earth-floor; for she had a tongue in her head. Women need to be able to scourge a fool with speech; That is their only weapon to punish him or to teach; And it was worth while hearing her hit them off, one by one, Every phrase just a picture, lit up with a touch of fun, Making them all, shamefaced, to do her bidding at once, Till, at the last, she needed no more than a hasty glance. Blavick used to be hateful; but now it grew pleasant to me, At first, I hardly knew why, but just that I liked to see The change that Lizzie had wrought; for that I would sit for hours And hear old Blavick's chatter, as if it were sweet as the flowers. Many a time when I went out just to look over a field, And see how the corn was ripening, or guess at the turnip yield; Many a time when I came away from the thronging fair, Pleading I must go home for the task that I had to do there; Many a time when I left for the kirk on the Sabbath day, It was not the kirk I went to, for Blavick was in my way: Somehow or other, something was always drawing me there, As the tide runs after the moon—and oh but my moon was fair! Then I knew that I loved her—loved her with all my heart, As only a strong man can whose love is his strongest part. She was only a servant maiden, but oh she was my queen: She was only a cottar's daughter, and I was the farmer of Plein; My fathers had been here, sir, for five generations back, And never a lease ran out but the laird would renew the tack, For they had money to farm with, and they could farm with skill, And never a lease ran out, but the land looked richer still. Yet she seemed high above me—ever so high above! It never came into my head that I honoured her with my love; Nay, but she was my moon, my chaste and beautiful moon, And I but the panting tide that followed her syne and soon; She was so bright, quick-witted, and I so dull and slow, She high up in the heaven, and I on the earth below. Folk said that I might do better? I thought, if she'd condescend To smile on me, I would follow her on to the wide world's end. But there was one at Blavick—and he too the worst of the lot, Partly a horse-couping black-leg, partly, moreover, a sot; Fain to look like a jockey, wearing a jaunty hat; Some folk called him good-looking,— I am not a judge of that— But in his eye was a hot moist leer, and he had a chin That dropt inside of his necktie, and a hard and tight-drawn skin. Other folk called him clever, but I should say only smart— I call a man smart when his head does not feel the want of a heart, And works best when it has laid the conscience high on the shelf, Regarding not God or man, and caring for none but himself. What is it women can see in men assured and bold, That they give their warm true hearts to hearts that are false and cold? That they give their pure souls up to men that are foul with sin, Nor shrink from the outward taint, nor dread what is hidden within? I never could comprehend how such things come to be, And now it is more than ever a mystery grown to me. That Blavick's son was a scamp, sir, as all the country knew: You could read it plain in his face, he neither was manly nor true; He ought to have been ashamed to speak to an honest maid, And she too ought to have known the weapon with which she played, Ought to have known the fellow would lead her a devil's dance. But now there was no getting speech of her—hardly I met her once; Always you saw them together; he went with her to the kirk, Chatted with her at the milking, sat with her in the mirk; In harvest she was his bandster; she raked for him at the hay; And wherever you happened to meet her, he never was far away. Ay! and he made her tryste him beside the “Dancing Cairn,” Although she had heard the story of Bessie Lusk and her bairn; But she said it was all a lie; the sheriff had let him go, And Bessie had fallen asleep, and died in the drifting snow; And even the minister found no fault that he could blame, And it was wicked to rob a man of his honest name. All this I saw going on, and yet like a fool, one day— Every man plays the fool, I suppose, sir, once in a way— Finding her by herself, I asked her to be my wife; And when she had said me nay, ere I turned to my lonely life, Partly because I loved her, and partly because I feared What might happen, if things went on as they now appeared, I warned her of him, as none but a fool would have thought to do. Of course, she blazed up fiercely: there was not a word of it true; 'Twas gossip of wicked people, and some folk's meaner spite; And she would believe in him now, though I proved it clear as the light; And she would hold to him now, and sink with him or swim.— I felt there was something grand in her womanly faith in him, Felt too that I had been little—at least, that I must look small, Though I said no more than the truth, and had not said nearly it all; But then I should just have taken mine answer, and gone my way.— A weary way now it was, sir, of lifeless work all day, And brooding by night o'er the fire, and eating my heart like a fool, Till things grew over my mind, like the weeds in a standing pool, And I scarce knew what I was doing, or heeded a word that was said, Going to kirk and market, and never once turning my head; Doing my job of business, doing my bit of prayer, With a changeless thought in my heart, and a changeless aching there. People, I daresay, wondered why I sat brooding alone; What did it matter to me? I let them go wondering on. I hated the talk of the market, the glee of the curling rink, And the rough jokes of the smithy, the ale-house too and its drink; Yea, and I hated my life so brightened once by her smile, So haloed and hallowed to me by the dream of her love for a while, For now it had all gone dark, and I did not seem to mind What the clouds might be gathering, or what might be in the wind. Maybe, sir, you have known, now a feeling something like that, When there's nothing you fear or wish for, it is all so stale and flat, Tasteless and dry as a rush-pith you chew, and you don't know why— It's a bad way to be found in if the devil should hap to come by. So the spring passed with the tender green of the sticky leaves, The songs of the mating birds, and the swallows' nest in the eaves; So too the glory of summer with the smell of clover and bean, The hawthorn white in the hedge, and the daisies white on the green; And autumn also went with its wealth of well-stooked corn, And the kine that low for the milk-pail duly at even and morn. Nature passed through her changes, but I was still the same: I ne'er fished a pool for the trout, and I fired not a shot at the game: People were wedded and buried, but I was not there to see, At harvest-homes the lasses might none of them dance with me. There was nothing I heeded, except to put cash in the bank— Not that I cared for that either, at least not much; but I thank Heaven that I grew not a miserly churl as I might have done, But for my wee Curly Pow, and her laugh like a blink of the sun. But there; I am going too fast—there was not a Curly Pow yet; But I never can think of those days without thinking too of my pet, And what she has saved me from, and how I am in her debt: Perhaps she was given me for this, to keep me from being a churl, For my heart was set on the gold, until it was set on the girl. Well; one evening that winter—it had been snowing all day, And now with the dry small drift the wind was making rough play, Rolling it low o'er the earth, and tossing it high in the air, And whirling it over the cliffs to toss up the white foam there. Not a night to be out in; but I thought I must go and look After a hirsel of sheep that were pasturing down by the brook In the hollow there where the rocks have opened to let it through; There the pasture is good, sir, and the pools for trouting too. So; I had seen to the sheep, and was fighting my way again Home through the blinding drift that smote with a stinging pain, When something flitted close by me, and moaned as it made for the shore Just where the rocks stand up, two hundred feet and more, Out of the wild wan water, with only a narrow ledge, Here and there, where the sea-gulls build, and their nestlings fledge. Even in quiet weather it is perilous walking there At night, for the cracks and fissures you come upon unaware, Where the waves rush in so madly, tossing the white foam high: But on a night like this, one who was not wishing to die Would have kept far off from the wind-swept cliffs, and the drifting snow, And the loud roar of the waves that were plunging down below. What was it smote my heart, that the form, which dimly fell White on my eyes through the snow, was the girl I had loved so well; Why was I sure that I heard her moan, though the raving wind Shrieked till my ears were as deaf as my eyes with the drift were blind? Heaven only knows, for I had no reason to think that she Was out of the house that night, or near to the rocks or me: Yet I was certain of it, as if it had been revealed Clear by the word of the Lord, and with miracle signed and sealed. So in a moment I rushed off after the fading form Into the pathless night that was dark with the blinding storm; And not five yards from the cliff I passed her with labouring breath, And stood in front of her there, stood between her and death. Pallid she was as a ghost, with a wild gleam in her eye, Gleam of the madness that drove her out that evening to die: Ah, poor soul! so lately rich in a full-blooded life, And merry as bird in the summer, or bee when the clover is rife, Glowing and singing, and laughing all through the work of the day, Ah! what anguish had broken a spirit so blithe and gay? What cruel wrong had dethroned a reason so sharp and clear That had not a moping doubt, and felt not a shadowy fear? “What did I mean? Let her pass. And what right had I to ask Whither she went, or why? And, forsooth, it was not my task To be her keeper,” she said. It was not a time for speech: Vain in the tumult of feeling to order your words and preach: So then I tore off my plaid, and swathed her in it, ere she knew, And lifted her up in my arms, and strode through the tempest that blew Wilder, fiercer than ever; and after struggling a while, She lay as one dead on my bosom for most part of a mile. Ah! was it only thus I should bring my love to my home? Only thus to my bosom now was she ever to come? No gay bridal for us, no Kirk's blessing or bells? But a dead weight on my arm, and something of sorrow that tells. How I got home, I wot not: but I strode on, slow or swift, With a great black fear on my heart, as I fought with the wind and drift. My mother was living then; and when I laid down my load There on the sofa beside her, saying that Woman and God Must see to the rest of this gear; she gave me a sudden glance, With plainly a question in it, and something of doubt, perchance, As if she would say, There's something wrong here; can it be you Has wrought this evil, my son? God help me if that be true. Then, “Look you, mother,” I said, “there has been villainy here, Double-damned villainy, sure, and the truth of it yet shall appear, Ay! if I pluck his heart out to get at the secret within;— Oh! I would have given my life to save her from sorrow and sin. But something has to be done, or after all she will die. Is she living? I thought that I half-heard a kind of shivering sigh. She was making straight for the sea, when I found her close to the brink Of the Kittywake Rock.—Ah! that was a moan of life, I think; Can I do anything, mother? If he were here now! Well, It would only be doing God's work to hurl the villain to Hell.” Then she: “Leave God Himself to do His own work, my son; Vengeance is His, and surely, if slowly, His judgments are done: Do not the thing that you ought not, for so our worst sorrows are wrought, And sorrow, I fear me, will come yet from doing this thing that ye ought. But happen what may, ye did right: only now you must saddle and ride; This will need doctor's skill. 'Tis a wild night, lad,” she cried. “And you are down-hearted and cold; and yet it is better for you Than sitting, helpless, at home, to have something set you to do. So let not your horse's hoofs tarry, but mind the bridge and the shore, And speed him as fast as you may, or death will be here before.” Four miles' ride to the village, but the wind was then on my back; Four miles home with a gale in our faces that did not slack Once for a moment; a while to saddle the doctor's brute, And get him into his shoes, as he growled at a gouty foot: Yet we were back in the hour; ay, that was the staunchest mare Ever yet stood in my stable, or ate from the manger there. But we were not in time—Wee Curly Pow came that night, Came from the sin and the shame to me as an angel of light.— Strange that out of such evil such a blessing should rise, That from the very heart-breaking came the heart-healing likewise. But Lizzie was taken from me; she never looked on her child, The troubled unhappy soul sped forth in the tempest wild, Seeking to hide her with God, where hiding is found alone; And oh so still as she lay now, trouble and tempest gone! Mother looked sadly at me, and gravely the Doctor too Hinted that tongues would be clacking or ever the day was through, That the farmers of Plein had been always men of an honoured name Which never till now had been smirched with a shadow of guilt or blame. What was there now to smirch it? Drily he smiled at that, Turned up his eyebrows, and said that the day would tell me what: Meanwhile my heart within me was wroth at the villain's deed; Meanwhile my heart was breaking to have failed her now in her need; For I had loved her truly, and now I was left alone; And oh so still as she lay there, trouble and tempest gone! Not long had I to wait for what their foreboding feared; One day quietly passed—the lull ere the storm appeared; But on the next, like fire among burning ricks, it ran; It was told by every woman, believed by every man, How I had played the deceiver, how I had brought disgrace On the good name that was honoured o'er every name in the place; How Blavick's son had been blinded, and all his people beguiled; And how in her shame she had fled to the father of her child; And they say that he carried her home a mile through the drifting snow; And who could have ever believed that Plein would have acted so? I laughed as the tale was told, but I tried to be still and mute, For the grief was more than the wrath, so the story had time to root: And you cannot fight with a rumour which nobody stands to quite, For that is like hitting at shadows, and beating the air at night. Then it was that I found a blessing in Curly Pow: She was all of my love that remained, all of Lizzie that I had now. Every day she would lie for hours and hours on my knee: I was but an uncouth nurse, but she learnt to trust in me; And I got to love her somehow, and it would have broken my heart, Had anything happened on earth to make me and the baby part. They might think what thoughts they pleased, they might say of me what they list, When she crowed up into my face, and learned to look up and be kissed. It was all of my love that remained, it was all of my Lizzie I had, And Lizzie had been my all. But, of course, they said everything bad. Of course, they said everything bad. The minister once came in, And vowed at my own fireside if I did not confess the sin, He must cut me off from the Church; he was sorry, but what could he do? Some one, I said, must confess, for that sin has been done is true— Sin of the shamefulest kind, and covered with perjuring lies, Sin that came nigh to murder, no art can ever disguise, Sin malignant that shifted its guilt on the innocent too, Sin that took up ill reports, and spread the false word for the true; Verily sin all round. But for me I have nought to confess, Save that in pity I saved a life in its great distress. But may be the Priest and Levite blamed the Samaritan's sin For binding the traveller's wounds, and bringing him home to his inn; He saved an enemy's life, and it cost him money to do it; It was not a prudent act, for only the Lord God knew it. Who then did it? he asked. Enquire at your Elder's son, The horse-couping scoundrel,—it's not the first of these jobs he has done; You've had him through hands before. Yes! he swears he is not to blame? But when you last had to deal with him, did he not swear the same? Yet he was guilty, you know, and was held to have doubly sinned, And sat on the stool of repentance, and stared at the girls and grinned. What do you think, sir? It strikes me, that did not do him much good; And who is the better because her babe is unchristened? or would Be worse if it were baptized? It is nothing, of course, to me; But if it is right that the babe, who has sinned no sin, should be Brought to the water of God, then why should this little one bide Like one who inherits a shame, while her father has none to hide? See, I will hold her up before all the folk if you will, I'll take all the vows on myself which I'll faithfully strive to fulfil, Will toil for her, pray for her, teach her to walk in the way undefiled; Though there's not one drop of the Plein blood flows in the veins of the child. I cannot lie even to get you to bless the babe that I love: It is not my child—but it's God's; and its name too is written above. He was mightily scandalised, and flung right out of the house: But I did not heed him; I knelt there down by my wee little mouse— She was not my Curly Pow yet, for she had not a hair on her head, But she always got some pretty name as I took her upstairs to her bed, As Mousie, or Birdie, or Daisy, or anything dainty or sweet, Or the Star, or the Song of my life, or my Lamb with its tender bleat— So I knelt, and prayed to the Father to help me to train her for Him, Since worse than orphan she was, and I felt that my eyes grew dim, While I sought for the better baptism that she might be pure and good, As no Kirk water could make her. And then in a happier mood We crowed and played there together, until it was time for bed; Where I lay and dreamt of my Lizzie, who lay with the silent dead. Well; yes, the house now was lonely; but that I did not much mind: People must go their own way; and for me I was never inclined To mix with the folk round about here, who mostly have nothing to say, Save about cattle and crops and the prices on market day. Not to pleasure the like of them should my ways be changed: So they might do as they listed; and most of them were estranged. But I always had wee Curly Pow to help me to carry it through, And life is as happy to-day as on ever a day that I knew. Ay! neighbours leave us alone, and the Kirk has cast us away, And every day of the week is as still as the Sabbath day: Worse thing they had not to do; it was all the length they could go. Baby don't mind, but at first I felt it a terrible blow To be shut from the table of God, to be held as an outcast man, To be looked at askance like a branded sinner and publican. I went still to Church for a time, and sat on the square Plein pew, And heard the old Psalms, and the prayers, and bits of the sermon too, Meanwhile I wept like a child, as I thought of the happier days When father and mother and all of us loved the old Kirk and its ways. But I stayed here at home ere long; for I found more of God in the child, As I looked on her sweet pure face no shadow of sin had defiled; My Sundays were better with her than there where my neighbours gloomed, As the minister preached at me sometimes, and I sat and fretted and fumed. I don't say it's right, sir; but God seems nearer me here now than there, My thoughts are sweeter and better with wee Curly Pow in her chair, As we read in the old Book together, and kneel for a brief word of prayer. What came of the horse-couping black-guard? I never cared much to know: For I found it was best for myself just to let the thought of him go Out of my mind altogether; it was a dead fly, do you see? Spoiling the ointment, of course—working no good, sir, in me. He left the place by and by, with the constable hard on his track, Making it certain enough he would not be in haste to come back: Then there were rumours about him; he had been killed, they said, In the big Bull's Run affair, and found in the field 'mong the dead; But others averred he was caught horse-stealing, and lynched on a tree. Bah! he is out of the way, sir, and that is the best thing for me: There was nothing I dreaded so much as to meet him some evening alone Where I met poor Lizzie that night. Ay, it's well that the fellow is gone. DR. LINKLETTER'S SCHOLAR I was his master; and from me He learnt at a sitting his A B C: And step by step I led him through Grammar and History, Latin and Greek, And the science of Form and Number too, And Rhetoric that he might fitly speak As only the well-trained orator can, For speech is the noblest gift of man; But speech that is not by the laws and books Is but as the cawing of jays and rooks, Or the meaningless babble of running brooks: And from the first it was plain to me What his rôle in the world must be. It was my mind that was stamped on his, When his was soft as the melted wax; Yet it was not wax, but gold; and it is Strong too and sharp, as the woodman's axe, To hew him a way through the tangled bush, And also to smite his foe at a push— Just the mind that is sure to win Whatever the tussle it may be in, For in this world they only tell Who learn to hit out straight and well. Therefore I follow his proud success, Day by day, as he rises higher, Read what he says in the public Press, And note what the critics all admire; And this bit and that, which the whole world praises For its lofty thought, or its happy phrases, Or its insight clear, or the counsel wise That in its large suggestion lies— I could not have said it so well as he, But I know there is something in it of me; I could not have worked out so perfect a thought, But I gave him at first the true key-note; For I was his master, and from me He learnt, as I told you, his A B C. Ah, sir, only to think that you Had not the fitting words at command To utter the thought that you felt was true; And what it may grow in a master's hand! At times, I can hardly detect the seed, When it blossoms out in the perfect flower, For it had been only a trifling weed If left to ripen, by sun and shower, In the poor soil of a mind like mine: Yet the germ of it all was there, I know, Though only he could have made it grow Into a glory so divine. Wonderful, sir, that genius should Transform your thought, like its natural food, And breathe into it a life so rich The author of it shall hardly find What of it now is his, and which First smote the spark from the glowing mind! A chit of a thing when he came to me; No shears had ever yet come on his head, And his mother could hardly bear to see The golden curls which at last were shed, That he might be like the rest of the boys Who jeered at him, till she polled his hair.— She kept it among her treasured joys, Wrapt up in her marriage lines with care. And I felt with her, as I must confess: He was so beautiful before, So touched with a sweet and tender grace; And now we had made him commonplace, Like the louts that were playing about the door. A little ago he seemed just a child, Thoughtful yet bidable, gentle and mild, My little Nazarite, five years old, With his great black eyes, and his hair unpolled; And I felt he would be my Samson yet, Not for his brute strength and clumsy sport, But for his humour, and for his wit, Quick to reason, and keen to retort, And for a memory that forgot Of all you might teach him never a jot. Already I saw what he was to be, When he shook the curls of his golden hair; And now as the small face looked at me, I thought, ah! what if his strength was there? And I felt my eyes like her's grow dim, He was so changed when we gazed at him. That was a foolish thought, but love Makes all of us foolish now and then, And he who thinks he is far above Such things is the foolishest among men; Fond may be foolish, yet love is wise; They call it blind, but the seeing eyes See best by the light in the heart that lies. Oh but our work went merrily now, Blithe as the birds that sing on the bough, For all the lore of the ancient times Came with as natural ease to him As song to the thrush on the stately limes Piping aloud in the evening dim. It was not work, it was liker play, Teaching my pupil day by day; Yet sometimes it was dreadful too, He kept such a resolute grip of all The gods and heroes mythical, They were all so real to him and true, And all their loves had hates he knew, Better than what went on around Among the boys on the playing ground; And in his innocence he would talk Of Jove and Leda in our walk, And of the foam-born beautiful One, And the myths of the all-embracing Sun. But all is pure to the pure in heart, And chaste as the marble of highest Art. Ah! sir, you cannot know what it is, How it wears the patience down to the bone To toil through a summer day like this, Sharpening fools on the grinding stone, While stolid or sullen they grow by fits, And nothing will put an edge on their wits; We have to be pedants and too precise, Or nothing would flourish but sloth and vice. But oh the joy! when you chance to find One who can answer to all your mind, Who hungers for learning, as hawk for its prey, And never forgets a word you say— A bright young soul to be trained with skill, Ready to take what shape you will, Believing, loving, intent to know, And clear as a mirror the truth to show, But not like a mirror to let it go. That was a gladness he gave to me From the day that I taught him his A B C. Only once had I ever seen Such another, who so combined Memory, fancy, and reason keen; And he from the first had always been Sickly in body, though strong in mind. Ah the sorrow I had for him, As he wasted slow with an inward fire, And his eye grew brighter, as mine grew dim With the dying of hope in a deep desire! A beautiful spirit! and when he parted From the shrunken form, and the aching pain, I said, as I sat down broken-hearted, That I never should love, as I had, again, Spending my life on him day by day, Only to steal his life away. For I ought to have noted the hectic streak, When first it flushed on his pallid cheek, And I—I had only worked him still Because he worked with so ready a will, And his mother, I kept the truth from her— And what, if I had been his murderer? Yet here was another like the first, But brighter still; and now if he Were also to die, I should be accursed Of all proud mothers that heard of me. Therefore I said, it shall not be; We will not always be poring on books, We will not study with sickly looks; We will go up to the breezy hills, And scent the smell of the old pinewood; Or down where the sea-spray flies, and fills The air with a breath that is also good. It is stupid indeed to be spending hours Only seeking for vulgar health; But then we can gather the lore of flowers, And drink in the wonder of nature's wealth, And fight off Death with the weeds and shells, And the strong, rich life in the sea that dwells. So rarely a day then came and went, But we heard the plash of the rushing wave; And often a day on the hills was spent, Where the mountain ash, or the pine trees brave The mist and the cloud and the stormwind's shock, With roots clawed fast to the grey-brown rock. I watched if a fire ever burned in his eye, I watched if a flush ever dyed his cheek; Not his mother herself would have watched as I; Yet I only watched him; I did not speak; For thinking of health may bring disease, And I did but talk of the hills and trees, And the bright sea-pools, and the running brooks, And the dainty gulls, and the cawing rooks, And how they were better than musty books. That was not true; but you have to hide Your thoughts from the eager ones at your side. So passed the school-years, gathering in Harvest of wisdom from the wise, Harvest of pictures for the eyes, Harvest of song for the heart within— Harvest richer than all before, For it was not books that we read alone, But God's handwriting, on earth and stone, Penned by Him in the days of yore, Though it's only now we begin to spell The sacred writing, and read it well. Oh so glad were those years to me! Oh so fruitful of freshest thought! Watching the gull or the guillemot, Or searching the rock-pools by the sea, Or learning from the nest-building swallows, Or noting the woodman and his craft, As he felled the pine trees, and bound the raft, Or poled it down through the rushing shallows! At first, I grudged the hours it took, At first, I sighed for the half-read book, And carried its thoughts about with me, Until I found that we could not see The world without for the world within, Nor gather the health we were there to win. So the books and the maps were laid aside That we might look forth open-eyed, As Homer did, on the world wide. And good are the pictures still, I find, Then hung in the chambers of the mind. What a career was his at college! Never the like of it seen before, Since Crichton, Admirable for know-ledge, Startled the schools with his wondrous lore. Not Faust was a defter spirit than he In Letters and Arts and Philosophy; Medals, scholarships, honours poured Down on his head with one accord, And yet the small head was not turned, But only for yet more learning burned. People would glance at the Honours' List, And say, “Is there nothing he cannot do?” For ne'er at the head of it was he missed; His name was the first that came in view In Classics and Logic and Rhetoric too, Which are the things that the wise of old, More than all others, received to hold. Yet some folk, envious, hinted that such Prodigies rarely came to much. I knew better. I worked with him Night after night, till the lamp grew dim, Night after night, till the day would break: For I said, he will carry to many lands My name like Ascham's, and for his sake I too of fame shall yet partake; For I am the clockwork, he the hands. Oh, I was proud of him; who but he? For was he not also a part of me? Of course, he was more than I; yet so What I, too, might have been, he would show. And when at length he was capped, the town Gathered to see him, and shout his praises, As, smothered in prize-books, he sat down, And blushed at the Principal's eloquent phrases; But his mother and I were hid in a nook, And mingled our silent tears, and shook. Ah! is there anything leaves no sorrow— The mark of the human—on its way, When the hope, that brightened the looked-for morrow, Drifts past at length into yesterday? Well, well! it is idle to moralise, Wasting breath upon empty sighs; And we have ourselves, no doubt, to blame, When bubbles burst we have fondly blown; And if you have properly played the game, Shall you grieve that one of the tricks is gone, Which you hoped to win with the cards you had? Or vow that your partner's play was bad? I was foolish and vain, sir; for I thought I was filling his mind like an empty bottle, When we read Justinian now, and wrought At the politics, too, of Aristotle. But he was not a vessel that I could fill; He was a man with his own strong will, And I was wrong when I took it ill. Why is it people smile at me In a pitying, patronising way?— They've always done it, even when they Were learning with my eyes to see The beauty of classic verse of prose:— They tried to hide it, but yet I saw. What can it be? I am not like those Beautiful youths, I know, who draw All hearts to them by their witching look. In a drawing-room now I lose my head, Till I get in a corner, and find a book, And lose myself in its thoughts instead. It is true, I am awkward in company, And blush if a lady but speaks to me, And never do find the right word to say, And my legs or arms are in my way, And I've no small talk, nor a spark of wit, And my laugh is not mirthful—can that be it? Well, well; I am nothing, and ne'er shall be, Unless my pupils interpret me; Just like a language few will take The pains to learn, though it hide a store Of precious wisdom and curious lore, And those who learn it a name will make. But I hoped that he would esteem it more. Yet his mother herself would sometimes say, He has no heart; he is only brain; There is nothing he loves in a perfect way, There is none that he would not grieve and pain To gain his end. And I also felt, Though he had no passion of youthful vice, But was ever as pure and cold as ice, Yet was it ice that nought could melt; And he never was young like other boys, Nor made them his friends, nor loved their joys. He was fain to argue and to dispute, Even when he saw that he was wrong; It was idle his arguments to refute, For when he was beaten by reasons strong, He would ride away on a jest or two, In the triumph of laughter mocking you. At the lowly in heart too he would sneer, And the simple in heart he held for fools, And there were times when he made me fear He cared for us only as his tools. Yet maybe we led him, ourselves, to think That only for him did we keep our lamps trim, That all our wells were for him to drink, And all existed only for him. And oh, what a mind he had! what power! What subtlest insight to detect The hidden analogies few suspect! As the wild bee travels from flower to flower, And brings quick life to the barren seed, So would he bring from far afield What made the commonest thing to yield Undreamt of meaning, and life indeed. So it came at last that, in gown and wig, I heard him plead in a fitting cause. How the words rolled from him round and big! Not Tully himself more versed in the laws Of Rhetoric, how to turn and wind Round judge or jury, and win their ear, Then flash a metaphor into their mind, Or a stroke of wit that they smile to hear, And, when he has got them well in hand, Close with a peroration grand— Or touching, if that is the vein most fit; But, with our British mind, I know Hard reasoning, and a harder hit Will often farther than pathos go, Or pictures of clients in stricken woe. He hit the nail on the head, I saw: Not once did he miss a point of Law, Or fail the heart of the case to seize, Or to persuade and rouse and please: Nothing was showy or juvenile, Nothing merely for ornament; Every word was in perfect style, Every plea to the marrow went, Clenched with a telling precedent.— Oh, what a gift is that, to stand Before the majesty of the Law, And hold your argument clear in hand, And state the matter without a flaw! I had studied the case myself at night, And seen it, I reckoned, as clear as light: But I felt, as I heard him pleading now, The cold sweat beading upon my brow, And there was a ringing in my brain, And all was dark, till he made it plain. I could not have spoken a word for awe Of the ermined majesty of the Law. Now when he finished, the Judge looked down, And complimented his able friend: The Bar had done, he was free to own, All that the Bar could to defend A weighty cause in a weighty way, And to fulfil the hope which they, And all who knew of his honours won In other fields, had formed of him. So the grave Judge. When he had done, My head went round, and my eyes grew dim, And something I said—I know not well What it was,—but a silence fell On all the court; and I seemed to see A little boy at his A B C, Sitting thoughtfully at my knee. Of course, it was wrong in me to go In the hour of his triumph thus, and show My threadbare coat, and my withered face At such a time, and in such a place; Though it's true my coat was thin and bare That he might be garmented fitly there. But it cut me, at first, to the quick, when he Turned with a freezing look from me— Maybe, I had said something wild; My head was dazed when I thought of the child, And what he had grown with the help of me, And what in the future he yet might be:— Still it was wrong, and I see it now, So to intrude with empty and vain Thoughts of myself; and I ought to bow To the fit rebuke, though it gave me pain, As I crept away home in the dripping rain. Of course, he loves me, I surely know it, But that was not the right time to show it; And nobody likes, in the hour of his pride, To have shabby old friends creeping up to his side. What a brain he has for clearness and power! What a grasp of principles and details! What would take you a year, he will seize in an hour; And then his courage too never fails. He may be Lord High Chancellor yet, But he will write as a scholar no less (To think that a part of me may be set To give law from the woolsack, or teach from the press!) None of your idle poems, or flash Essays, biographies, tales, or trash, But solid works for the thoughtful few, Writ with a golden pen and true. I know it is in him. I put it there, And he will bring it out clear and fair, When legal briefs and affairs of state Slacken enough to give him leisure.— But that must be soon, for I may not wait Many more days for the Psalmist's date, When years are a burden, and not a pleasure. Hard, hard he works for the fame he seeks Through the busy term, and the holiday weeks; Yet he never is weary, never complains, Knows nothing of sickness, or aching pains, Or a wish for rest, or bile-clogged brains. That is the fruit of our happy days By the windy shores, and the wooded braes. Wonderful, wonderful! such a man! If he would only, now and then, Drop me a hasty scrape of his pen, When he has leisure to write, and can! It's hardly reasonable, I know, In me to be looking for that, although I spent the wealth of my life on him, And all the knowledge of studious years, And filled his cup, as it were to the brim, With the lore that now in his life appears. But what of that, sir? And what had I Been but a grave to bury it in, Were it not for the scholar I trained to fly With the bravest of them that mount up high Riches and honours and fame to win? And he has won them, and shall win yet The ermined robe, and the coronet, And a noble name, and mine shall be Blended with his, too, in history. And I've thought, now and then, in that coming day, When they talk of us, they will maybe say, I was the Moses that saw the Lord, He but the Aaron that gave the word. But that is when I am vain and proud, And sit by the fire, and think aloud, Wondering why he only writes A scrap to say that he has no time; And I'm ready to think that is nearly a crime, As I brood and fret through the long dull nights. But I ought to be grateful, indeed, that he Finds even a moment to think of me, With his hands so full, and his mind so strained, And the splendid place by his genius gained; For they say he is not more in request At the Courts of Law than in stately Halls, Where his wit has made him a welcome guest, And Beauty swims through its routs and balls. Ay, ay! and still I am sitting alone Among the old books by the old hearth-stone. But I do not grudge him; I only hope, When his cup is full, he will spill me a drop, For my work is done, and my days are dim, And my heart grows thirsty to hear from him, As the shadows of the Eternal fold Around my head that is grey and old. DICK DALGLEISH Just a mechanic with big, broad head,— Carpenter, maybe, or engineer,— Deft with a skilled hand at winning his bread, Scornful of varnish and show and veneer; Rough-handed, plain-spoken, strong in his youth, Loyal to all of his order and craft; Loudly maintaining the fact and the truth, At all pretences as loudly he laughed; Laughed at quill-drivers, and white-fingered dandies Measuring ribbons with yard-stick and tape; Laughed more at frowsy men doctoring brandies, And calling their drugs the pure fruit of the grape: He slept through the night, and he toiled all the day, And nothing he drank but the brook by the way. Out on a holiday, wholesomely dressed, Clean-washed, clean-shirted, his wife by his side, With a small baby she clasped to her breast, And chirped to, and watched with a motherly pride. Proud of her baby, and proud of her Man, All her young face was like sunshine to see; No sickly vapours had she, nor a wan Fine-lady look, but was healthful as he. How she looked up to him! Who was so clever? Who was so good as her Dick? It is true He was blunt-spoken, but then he would never Harm a poor worm or a fly, if he knew; And he read everything—science, and plays, And poems, and all that the newspaper says. Out on a holiday, sailing down The broad clear river that bore away Thronging crowds from the broiling town To the birch-clad hill or the sandy bay; Shrewdly he glanced at either shore, Lined with the half-finished skeleton ships, Spoke of their rigging, abaft and afore, And what they might do at their trial trips; Plainly knew all about this one's gearing, The other one's engines, paddles, or screw, And the new methods of working and steering, What coal they needed, and what coal could do; And shrewdly projected a wonderful dream, Into the future, of iron and steam. I scarce know why, but I rather took To the manly bearing of him, and the fond Young pride which his wife showed in every look, Than to all the rest, as their ways I conned: They were mostly broad-cloth citizen folks, Each with his newspaper where he read The markets first, and the price of stocks, And what at the bankrupt court sittings was said: They carried their business with them always; While their wives were towny and overdressed, Talked of their city life and its small ways, And dinners and weddings and fashion and taste. So I took my seat, with a frank good-day, By the big mechanic in homespun grey. I was fain to speak of his craft and trade, But he went rather at first for books: Did I not think that Darwin made A case for the worms as against the rooks? What had the birds done for earth like these Dumb, silent ploughers who made the soil For rooks to nestle on its high trees, And man to live by his sweat and toil? That was a man, sir, with hardly a rival For his power to see, and his grasp of thought; And as for his doctrine of fit survival, That's the new gospel this age has got; And we must be rid of the drones in the hive, That the true workers may live and thrive. They're nearly all drones now on board here to-day; Our lads went off with an earlier boat; But wife, sir, and baby must have their own way, And she likes the gentle-folks when she's afloat. It is so, you know, Kate; you're fain now to hear The sweet-spoken damsels come praising your child; And if we went down, you would rather appear With respectable folk, pretty-mannered and mild, Than stand at the judgment with Dick, Tom, and Harry Not more than half-sobered with gulps of the sea— Oh, how can I say so, when you chose to marry Such a blunt working chap, such a rough tyke as me? That's true; yet you cannot deny it was you Brought me here with this soft-handed, soft-headed crew. Would you wish me, old girl, now, to be just like these, With broadcloth and white linen worn every day, And to saunter through 'Change for an hour at my ease, And call that my work, though it looks so like play? Their brow never sweats with the work they have done, Unless at some queer job that looks rather ill, And then it is but for the risk that they run, When they shuffle the cards for a trial of skill. Now, I come home at evening, Kate, dirty and weary, But my conscience is clean, and my head, too, is clear; I don't sit, and drink wine, and make the house dreary, As some of them do half the days of the year; I take on no stains from my work or my play Which a pail of fresh water will not wash away. They buy and they sell for the rise or fall, When neither a rise nor a fall should be, Filching a profit still, great or small, For the doing of nothing that I can see. There's a little chap sitting yonder—look! He's bulling and bearing all the day long; And they're fain to glance at his jotting-book, For they say that his guesses are seldom wrong; I call him the big flea blood-sucking commerce, And these are the little fleas blood-sucking him; And they live upon us, all our winters and summers— Swarms of them, sir—in the handsomest trim, They make their game, and the stakes are laid, And they rake in the gold which the workers made Yet what have they done for the world by their strokes Of betting and hedging? I want to know that. And who is the happier hearing their jokes? And whose life is helped by the jobs they are at? With their sharp arithmetic they fashion a blade That cuts a big slice of our profit away; And yet they've done nothing for it except trade On the folly of some, for which all have to pay! I used to read Carlyle, and laughed at his “gig-men,” And I still like the old fellow's rough tongue a bit; But he never yet said how the “clothes-men” and “wig-men” Must make way at last for the men who are fit. That's Darwin's discovery; and how can you doubt These chaps, like the dodo, are bound to die out? When you spoke to me first, you were wishing to know About us, the working men; what our thoughts are; And whereto our strikes and our unions grow; And how near the end is, or, maybe, how far.— Ah, folks are grown curious about us, who once Sniffed the grease of our moleskins, and hurried them past. You're not of that sort, I allow; and perchance We are crustier, now that our day's come at last, Than we should be. That comes of the way we've been living; Men trample on man, and they make him a brute; Though of course we ought all to be taking and giving, And keep our good humour and manhood to boot. But those who have tasted of slight and neglect, When folk grow too civil, are apt to suspect. I don't say it's right. But at one time I made What was plainly to me a new thing in our line; A saving of labour to quicken the trade, And bring in more wealth than the gold in a mine. Well, I spoke to the head of our firm; but he turned, With a big oath, and bade me go work at my tools; He had heard such tales once till his fingers were burned, And he found that your workmen-inventors were fools. But afterwards, learning more truly about it, Oh, he spoke me so bland, and would fain see the thing; So I brought forth my model—as proud, do not doubt it, As Kate of her baby there,—and with a swing Of the big hammer, I dashed it in bits, Saying, What could come out of a working man's wits? I had toiled at it, sir, every night for a year, So hopeful and happy in seeing my thought Turned now into iron, and coming out clear, At last, through a plain inspiration I got.— For why should not God inspire minds to invent As well as to preach, and be praised for His gift? Sir, it came like a flash and a thrill that were sent In a moment of failure, when I was adrift; As “the still small voice,” which the prophet must hearken, Because it was God's, so the thing came to me, Like the gladness of light when that failure did darken Around me, and I was as broken as he: And what is the joy of their gold, and their gain, To the gladness I had when I saw it all plain? You think it was childish to waste the ripe fruit Of my labour and thought. Not a whit; it's all here As clear in my head as that day, and to boot Some riper thought still that may some time appear. But I told you this only to show how, in vain, Folk think all at once they can heal the huge rent In our social order where one's heart and brain Find seldom the right places for which they were meant.— But why don't I patent the thing I invented?— Oh, and rise in the world, as they say, and grow rich, And have a grand house finely papered and painted, And mount me a-horseback to land in a ditch, And dress my good Kate in her sealskin and silk, And quaff my champagne as it were bottled milk? Well, I once knew a man with a head-piece to think, And hands that could work out the thought of his head— It is true that he had a bad weakness for drink, And would whimper about it, and wish he were dead;— But he took to that line, and had everything fine, A house in a big square, with lamps at the door, And carriages, horses, and flunkies, and wine, And heaven knows what that he had not before. But the ladies were shy of his wife; and the flunkies— The lazy fat rogues, I'd have sweated them well— At the back of his chair stood, and grinned there like monkeys, And down in the kitchen they laughed at his bell; And he had not a moment of comfort or peace, Till a crash stript him bare as a sheep of its fleece. No, I'll not take that way, sir; I don't care to rise Above my own class—we are happier so. The Son of the Carpenter now, He was wise In the old town of Nazareth long, long ago. We are not very pious, we workmen, I fear, Don't go much to church, but we read about Him; And the things that we read are not quite what we hear The minister blow off like froth from the brim Of a pot of small beer. Nay, I don't blame the preacher; It's just what we want that we find in our books; As the sun is a painter to some, and a bleacher To others; it is as the eye is that looks; You open the door to which you have the key, And I find the message that God meant for me. But the Carpenter, now, did not care to be great, And to ape what the fine lords of Herod might do, Nor yet be called Rabbi, and sit in the gate As a Judge, or a Parliament man to the Jew. The fox had his hole, and the bird of the air Had its nest; but He had not roof o'er His head, And heeded not purple and sumptuous fare, And borrowed a grave when He lay with the dead. And this is the gospel I read in the story— Though I don't say it mayn't have another to you— The Lord did not seek His own honour and glory, But stood by His craftsmen and fishers all through. He held to His class that their ills he might cure, And lift up the head of the needy and poor. Well, that is our gospel too, that is our Ark, Not to rise from our class, but to raise the class higher, Not to take to the nice ways of lawyer or clerk, Not to turn from the hammer, the file, and the fire; But to stand by our order and stick to our tools, And still win our bread by the sweat of our brow, And to organise labour by Christian-like rules, Not that some, but that all, may be better than now, May have homes of more comfort, and lives with more leisure To read, and to think, and to well understand, And to get, like us here now, some holiday pleasure; For they do the work that enriches the land. No! I don't care to rise for myself, till I see The rest get a chance, too, of rising with me. You're a Christian, sir? Well! so am I, in a way, Though some of our fellows, and good fellows too, Have no other gospel or God, as they say, Than Man, and what man's brain and fingers may do. I don't go with them, but I reckon my trade May be my church too, if the right heart is there, A-healing the wounds which the selfish have made, And helping the helpless their burden to bear. He is parson and priest, though his apron be leather, And he tuck up his shirt-sleeves to do his job well, Whose heart is most loving to sister and brother, Most ready to go where the sorrowful dwell, And to show to the erring the right way of truth, And bring them again to the faith of their youth. Now, the faith of my youth was that Christ would redeem The life of the poor from its sorrow and sin, Would wake up the world from its wealth-loving dream To seek the true riches of manhood within, In wisdom and worth, and the peace which they bring. That's the word which I heard from my old mother's lips; But now it's another guess-song that they sing, And the light of her heaven has all suffered eclipse. Oh, we boast that the poor man may rise in the world, And we point to his sons who are lords in the state, A-driving in carriages, scented and curled, Or making their bow to the Gold-Stick-in-Wait. And where shall you find, now, a sight that's so grand, Except in this truth-loving, Christ-serving land? Well, well! what rare tricks we do play, to be sure, With our conjuring cards, and our thimbles and peas! To think that a God could come here, and endure A cross to make lordlings and ladies like these, And to leave all the rest of His brothers to pine! There's your thimble, and Christ in't; but presto! begone! Lo! the devil is there, where the glory divine A short while ago sat in sorrow alone! Oh blessed the poor—if they only get money; And blessed the meek—if they stand to their rights; And all who are selfish shall have milk and honey, For they are the salt of the earth and its lights! Ay! that's the new gospel, I call it, of Gold; But we working men will hold fast to the old. Yes, I know we're divided, as other folk are, And what is yet worse, we are cursed with that drink; And many are selfish, and some of us mar A good cause with bad ways, and some do not think; And we've blundered, 'tis true, and been wrong now and then, And done what we should not—as who has not done? But we'll learn by our failures; we're only poor men, Kept like children till lately, now trying to run; And sometimes, of course, we get tript up and tumble; But still on our clouds, lo! the rainbow is set, And a light springeth up in the hearts of the humble, Will grow to more fulness, and gladden us yet— But there! I've been preaching until I have got A drop in my heart that is bitter and hot. That's the way with all preaching; it don't make one sweet. Where's Kate and the baby? They'll put me all right. Oh, the ladies are praising its hands and its feet, And its mouth and its nose, and its precious eyesight! Well, well! do you see, sir, that narrow green glen, With the strip of dark alders, that show where the stream Flows on in its loneliness far from men, And ripples, and murmurs like one in a dream? I speak like a fool, for of course you can't hear it, Though I hear it singing away to itself, Or sobbing at times like a sore troubled spirit, Or laughing perhaps as it slides down a shelf; I was born there, sir; and we're going to try A week with old mother—Kate and baby and I. LOST AND WON Broken She trusted him with her whole true heart, She trusted him as we trust in Heaven, Whatever they said, she took his part, And loved with the love to the noblest given. Oh, so deep as the water flows! Oh, so pure as the lily grows! But Love it is deeper and purer than they; Well-a-day! For him she left her father's Hall, And the happy life she had prized of old, And with a light heart turned from all Who once had loved her, and now looked cold. Oh, so deep, etc. And by his side she shared his lot, And gazed on his face with a tender pride; Poor they were, yet she murmured not, But with a smile would her troubles hide. Oh, so deep, etc. Ah! had she died when her Love was young! For she trusted him, and he was not true: Oh that she had died ere her heart was wrung! For there came a day when this thing she knew. Oh, so deep, etc. There came a day when a beam of light Searched his soul, and at length revealed Heart to heart, and she saw him right, And all the lie he had long concealed. Oh, so deep, etc. She read him clear as a printed book, And never a word to him she said; But shot at him only a sorrowful look, As her heart sank in her, cold and dead. Oh, so deep, etc. Broken in faith and heart and mind, Yet no one knew it, but only he, For she was true to her womankind, And no one felt it, but only she. Oh, so deep, etc. She turned her from all joy and mirth, In wifely patience silent, pale, And cared no more for a thing on earth, But that dead love of her life to wail. Oh, so deep as the river flows! Oh, so pure as the lily grows! But Love it is deeper and purer than they Well-a-day! Parted Out of his life she passed, The one gold-thread that was there; Out of his life at last She dropt with her burden of care— How had she ever come there? He was not worthy of love Such as she gave to him; And yet, like the heaven above, She clasped with her light the dim World that was dear to him. How could she so cast away The love that was born of God, The wealth in her heart that lay, On a man who only trod Mean ways that were far from God? His sorry heart she had taken For a nature noble and true, And slow was her trust to be shaken, Though colder ever he grew, The closer to him she drew. And into his life she brought Some touches of tender grace, Some gleams of a nobler thought Redeeming its commonplace— Had he known his day of grace! She had been to him like a song, And the song it was silent now, Or a stream that prattles along Where the life-roots feebly grow— And what was to come of him now For he was selfish and cold, For he was earthly and hard, For in the guerdon of gold Only he sought his reward— Poor soul, so earthly and hard! How could she give him her love, And he so unworthy of it? What were the great gods above Thinking of there where they sit, When they sent her to fold him in it? Ah! the gods know what they do, Whether giving or taking away; They waste no life that is true, They lose no game that they play, And cast no blessing away. For as she lay there in death, Lo! for the first time he saw All her meek love and her faith, And there came sorrow and awe As its great beauty he saw. Yea, there came sorrow and awe, As the gods entered his life, And the great word of the Law Cut to his heart like a knife, Seeing the shame of his life. And he lay low on the earth, When from his side she had passed, Loathing all gladness and mirth, Loathing himself now at last, When from his life she had passed; Stricken in heart, as he thought Of the waste of her love and trust, Of the grace that to him she had brought, Of the glory he laid in the dust, When he slighted her love and her trust. Stricken Ah me! he said, I do not mourn my loss; I was not meet for such good company; Thou all these years didst bear a silent cross, And it is right thou shouldst no longer be Comrade to me. I judge not others; few so bad as I: Enough to know my own poor little heart, As here in self-abasement now I lie, And feel that it is best for thee thou art From me apart. O love! my love! and yet I wonder how I dare to call thee love, who was not true; Yet I did love thee, and I know it now Too late, too late, when I can only rue My way with you. I was not always worldly, hard, and cold, I can remember yet a better day When love was dearer to my heart than gold; My God, how could I cast it so away? Woe worth the day! Ah me! where now the visions of my youth, The nobleness, the glory of its dreams, Its purpose high, its eager search for truth, Its hatred of the thing that only seems, And falsely gleams? Where the fond hope of holy love and pure, That, in a cultured home, afar from strife, With patient service of the meek and poor, Reckoned to make a great and perfect life With a sweet wife? Was it all an illusion—but a cloud, Sun-painted in the morning, far away, And filled with lark-songs, by and by to shroud With mist and drizzle all the dismal day, And mud-strewn way? Nay, but it might have been, it might have been; 'Twas I that failed, not nature that deceives; Had I been faithful I had surely seen The better hopes, for which my spirit grieves, Gathered in sheaves. They are not false, those golden dreams of youth; But we are false to them, and fall away From their high purpose, following the smooth World-lies that win us empty praise and pay, And lead astray. They might have been, ah me! they might have been; And oh the sorrow to look back, and know They are not, and our life is poor and mean, Achieving only loss and empty show, And shame and woe. They might have been? A woeful word is this; I might have been a nobler truer man, I might have laid up memories of bliss,— She would have helped, but sunless now and wan Is life's brief span. And looking back, I see the morning glory Grown dim, and fading 'mid the earthly smoke, My fond dreams telling now a sorry story Of thoughts ill-marshalled, and the battle broke Without a stroke. O heart, that was so rich in noblest wealth Of love and joy—to think I slighted thee O broken heart, erewhile so full of health, How in thy grief my bitter shame I see! God, pity me. Humbled Why should I care to live another life, When this is done? I have not made so much of this first spool That I should crave for other lint or wool To be ill-spun: O heart, my heart, have you not made enough Of this poor stuff? Would I go on for ever, fain to weave More of this gear— More tangled thrums, more broken ends of thought, More snarled hasps, another hapless knot Of sorrow and fear? An everlasting web of life like this, Would that be bliss? God help me! if I'm only just to do As heretofore, Better into a quiet grave to creep, And lay me down in peace, and go to sleep For evermore: Or better even right-off to be sent For punishment. Yes! I could find some comfort in the thought Of being scourged, Were there but hope that this defiling sin Which mars my life, and taints my heart within Could be so purged, And I might live, in virtue of the rod, The life in God. It is a coward heart that shrinks from pain, But not from wrong; Could I but hope to reach a purer air, God, I would say, lay on, and do not spare; Smite hard and strong: There are no pains that mortal men inherit Worse than I merit. I had a grace that should have made me great; I had a love Which should have made me loving, and I thrust The gift from me, and clave unto the dust, Till from above God stretched His hand, and took again to heaven What He had given. But oh, if in another truer world We yet might meet, As in the days that seem so long ago, And I this wretched heart of mine might throw Down at her feet, And say I wronged you, and I was not true To God or you! Yes! I could live for such a day as that With patient hope: Would heaven but grant me opportunity Of clear repentance which her eye could see, Then let me drop Anywhere, out of sight, to live no more As heretofore. THE MAD EARL And that is our Earl—poor fellow! I should not have known him a bit, Had we met on a street: how he's changed! to be sure, he had never much wit, But at least he was handsome, and now he is bloated and brown as a toad, And his brains gone to slush, like the snow when a thaw comes down on the road. It is years now since I have seen him, except in the woods far away Pacing alone where the close trees shut out the light of the day, Shunning all speech of man, and still more a woman to face;— Ay, ay! the weird is upon him that has to be dree'd by his race. These grand old families now, there's a story about them all— A ghost-room, a tragedy somewhere, a writing upon the wall; Of course they are shy to speak of it, but, on a winter night, It's the talk of the cottage fireside, in the dusk of the dim rush light. They tell of the Statesman Earl—'twas he made the house so great— A shrewd-witted Parliament man, and Councillor high of state— How shifty and clever he was with the turn o' the tide to swim, And how when a Bisset or Cheyne died, their lands fell somehow to him. Folk called him the great lord Spider: yet the small lairds still drew near, And buzzed about him like flies, for he was the big man here; And play ran high in those days; you might gamble a good estate Between the wine and the dawn; and his lordship's luck was great. That's how the curse came on them—that ne'er from his house should depart— A lord who was out of his wits, or a lady who had not a heart, For three generations coming; at least, so the old wives said, But maybe the woes of the house gave rise to the weird they read. Everything must have a reason; every fire once had a spark; And what like the judgment of heaven for clearing up things that are dark? None of his neighbours throve, and none of his race had their wits:— Easy to patch up a tale coming pat to your hand so in bits. Anyhow, certain it is that the Statesman Earl had a son, A gallant and gay young soldier, beloved of every one, Till one day his charger stumbled, and they picked him up for dead— Better he had been, for henceforth he never was right in the head. Then followed this one's father; he slobbered a deal at his meat, His tongue was too big for his mouth, and he shambled too with his feet; But he knew the right side of a penny, and looked to his farms and woods; Only nobody saw him at last, and they say he had wild-beast moods. But this Earl Ughtred, he looked right as a man could be: I knew him well as a boy, for he took a rare fancy for me, Chose me to go with him fishing, as well he might, for I knew More about trouting and fly-hooks than idle keepers could do. I was bred, you see, from a child on the bank of his choicest brook, And fished it with crooked pins, when I knew ne'er a word of my book, And my father too could busk you the daintiest deadliest flies; And the young lord saw that I knew the pools where the fish would rise. And many a talk we had as we tramped o'er the hills and the heather, Or dropped the spoil in the creel, or lunched on the banks together; And what would he not do for me, when he came to man's estate? For still he would go off a-fishing, and I must still be his mate. A fine, frank lad, sir, he was; and he would have done all that he said; It was not his blame that he did not; but he never was strong in the head; He had not a turn for books; and he used to have dreamy moods; But his heart was sound at the core, as the healthiest oak in the woods. It's true, he turned wildish awhile—as all of his race have done— He was handsome and wealthy and young, and guidance wise he had none; I sometimes wonder myself, could I carry a cup so full, And not spill a drop by the way, but keep my head steady and cool? By this time his father was dead, but he never had been of much good; Vice was engrained in him, only he did it as cheap as he could;— What little mind e'er he had—it never was much to be sure— Had been given to hoarding and hiding the pennies he screwed from the poor. So Ughtred would not be like him, would rather be lavish than mean, And scatter his gold, like the best, where the nobles of England were seen; Alike open-hearted and handed, had he only the brains to know Among all the ways that were miry where was the safe one to go. Wild, then, he was for a season—forsooth, he must bet and race, Though he scarce knew a horse from a cow, sir, unless she had horns to her face; So the blacklegs got at him early, and sold him the weediest screws Which he backed, of course, at their bidding, till he fell in the hands of the Jews. Then he got frightened, poor fellow, and something or other he did— I never could make out what—to men of his order forbid; They did not say it was wicked, but spoke of it as of a shame, And the great folks pitied his mother, and shook their heads at his name. That don't go for much with me; for I've lived on their skirts all my days, And I know that their honour allows them to walk in the doubtfulest ways, And I know that their honour forbids what conscience does not refuse— And he never was strong in the head, sir, and he was in the hands of the Jews. But it touched his mother; who was among us like a sov'reign law; Her pride was something the people whispered about with awe. And now to be pitied!—that made her more haughty than ever before, And she held up her head the higher, and hardened her heart the more. Then, his sister, the Lady Ion—she just came of age that year— A splendid creature to look at, but also a woman to fear, Features clear-cut as in marble, an eye that was bright and cold, And a perfect seat on the saddle—a rider as cool as bold: I was his lordship's servant, and it is not for me to speak, But the Book it says that the strong should be helpful still to the weak; And if all the tales be true that came from the big house then, Better for him had he faced the wrath and the scorn of men. 'Twas hard for her, I allow, to have that shadow of shame Cast on her morning sunshine, stigma on her proud name; But he was the head of the house, though ever so weak in his mind, And they were strong and cruel, who should have been strong and kind. There was a girl that he fancied, sweet as a rose in June, All other girls in the county were only as stars to her moon, All other girls in the county were but as weeds to the rose That in the bloom of its beauty in stateliest garden grows. Her fathers were barons here, when the great Earl's house was small As the stable where their horses stood champing each in his stall; It is not for me to say how, if certainly ever I knew, But slowly their acres had dwindled as his lordship's acres grew. But my lady and Lady Ion, they would not hear of the match; They mocked at her as a cottar whose door was shut on a latch, For there was nothing to steal there, but only a wax-doll face Blooming on bread and milk, and just fit for a milkmaid's place. Ah! pride, sir, is hard as flint, and the sparks struck from it are hot, Here and there flying unguided, to burn where little you wot; They hurt not her in the least, but see what they've made now of him, Moping and mooning about here whereever the light is dim. Then came the Colonist girl—that's she who's her ladyship now— That she had her wits about her was writ on her sharp little brow; Pretty and clever enough, with a glittering hard blue eye,— Ay! she would see to herself if her face was not wholly a lie. Colonial manners are frank; she would talk to any she met— Cadger or molecatcher—free, as she walked through the dry and the wet, And oh but she won folk's hearts, for she neither was haughty nor shy: But I liked not the cold blue glitter of steel that I saw in her eye. She thawed the Dowager's frost—like a breath of the coming spring, And toned her speech till it seemed like the songs that the spring-birds sing; What could she see in her now to sweeten her manner so, And make so much of a girl who was hardly a lady, you know? Colonial girls are free, sir, and colonial manners are frank, But then colonial money is good as the gold in the Bank; And she had dollars in millions to patch the rents he had made, Racing and betting, and learning the way that the Hebrews trade. The Dowager, then, looked sweet, and the Lady Ion was bland, As they led her over the Castle and showed her the goodly land, And they praised Earl Ughtred to her, and the race from which he grew— They were not clever perhaps, but their hearts were good and true. Meanwhile he mooned about: but would sometimes go fishing with me, And then he was like himself, and would laugh with a boyish glee, To hear the birr of the reel, or to land his fish on the bank— Till he turned him homeward, and then his face looked weary and blank. Well; one day she came up to me with the daintiest rod and reel, A casting-line twined round her hat, and hung by her side was a creel, Boots of porpoise leather, and petticoats not too long, In trim for a day of sport, and humming an angler's song. “I want you to take me with you, and show me how you do; There's nothing our Earl now cares for, except an outing with you; Of course, I am fishing for him, and they too are fishing for me, All the big house are in love with my money, save only he. I'm frank with you—that is my way; but really I like you, though You neither like me nor trust me, as well by your looks I know; And now you are wondering why I am set on this weak-witted earl:— As if strong-witted peers would look at a mere colonial girl. Now, I've told you the truth, will you help me? These women will drive him mad; Their nagging and sneering and mocking have broken what spirit he had. Folk talk of the fourth generation, that it would bring back their wit— I'm not superstitious, mind ye—but what if there's something in it? Most of the old stock here are needing fresh blood in their veins, And I'm sane enough to set up a score of their weak scatter-brains; What say you?—might I not risk it just on the chance that they Might get a new start in life to go on in a rational way? You smile—it's a dubious smile, I've noticed it often on you— Oh, you do not trust me, I know, yet you might, if you only knew; No matter; you'll take me with you? I'll not spoil sport if I can, I just want a lesson from you how to manage a moody young man.” So we went off on our fishing, but our sport was little that day; He was not once at his ease, and I saw that he wished her away; Nor did she manage him wisely, she had not the delicate touch, As she chattered and laughed so briskly, to know when it was too much. Yet she meant well, I am certain; meant landing her fish, if she could, But yet to make life to him brighter, and banish his gloomy mood; And she bit her thin lip at the failure, when he went off in a dream; That was the last time that ever he threw a gut-line on the stream. How it came round then, I know not; they wanted to wipe off the debt, And she with her millions of dollars would buy her an old coronet; They settled it somehow among them, and got him to church one day, Where he stood like a man in a trance, but he said what he had to say. The young folk travelled abroad for a time, as their way is, you know; And the Dowager followed with Ion too, after a month or so, We heard of them sometimes in Paris, and then in Rome, for a while, By and by on the Rhine river, then off for a trip to the Nile. At last, they came home, and were followed by visitors, princes and dukes, And priests with the subtlest smiles, and the sleekest of sidelong looks, Black-bearded foreign nobles, and their beardless foreign priests, And oh but there were rare doings with hunts and balls and feasts. You see, if there was not an heir—as there did not seem like to be— Our young lady, she would be countess; and now there was money to free Every acre of debt, and to leave the Australian girl Enough to maintain the state of the widow of Fingland's Earl. That was a merry time then, they rode to the hunt by day, And kept up the ball till morning, or shuffled the cards for play, All but the Earl, and he went moping and mooning about, Alone in his dusky chamber, or alone in the woods without. The young wife did as the rest, she rode to the Meet, at least, Saw them throw off, and then came ambling home with a priest, Chatted and laughed in the parlour, sailed through a waltz at the ball, And, thinking nothing of Ughtred, made herself pleasant to all. So it went on, till a day when bills must be settled at last; They had been falling like snow-flakes white on the old house cast, And duns had been prowling about it, threatening letters been sent; What could it mean, these people growing so insolent? Where was the chamberlain? Why had those men never been paid? Where were the millions of dollars for which they had boldly played? What had “my Lady” to do with it? was not her money my Lord's? Had she not titles and honours for her squatter father's hoards? Then they learnt what it meant, that glitter of steel in her eye; Surely poor folk must be paid for the things that the rich folk buy, And her lady mother and Ion had ordered everything nice, And, of course, she had always supposed they were careful to count the price. As for her money—her father, who honestly had come by it, Had tied it up, every penny, as fast as the law could tie it; Her marriage was not a joint-stock; each managed their own affairs; Not a dollar of hers was Ughtred's, and never a penny was theirs. Ay! they had met their match; it was even so as she said; The lawyers had warned the Earl; but he never was strong in the head, Folk even doubted, at times, if he knew what his marriage meant, And as for the signing of papers—he had signed whatever was sent. So she sat smiling there calmly, and spoke in the blandest way Soft lisping words that were daggers; how could she know but that they— She was but a squatter's daughter—had only to clap their hands, And slaves would bring dresses and jewels, and horses and houses and lands? But, of course, if their money was gone, they must live in a quieter way; No ladies, as she supposed, would wear what they could not pay; And she knew that one could be happy, as free from the burden of cares, In a hut with a maid-of-all-work, as in a great castle like theirs. Oh the glitter of that blue eye! yet it showed too a gleam of fun, As she told them of mutton and damper and tea on her father's “run,” Cooked by herself, with a wild Irish girl who saw to the fire;— It was spiteful, no doubt; but the sketch was cleverly hit off by her. What could they do? They might rage, but she shrugged her shoulders, and smiled; If they could not pay their own tradesmen, why, then she had been beguiled; She had known that he was not burdened with brains, nor in vigorous health, But she took all their stories for gospel, when they spoke of his greatness and wealth. So the ladies and princes and dukes and priests all vanished like smoke, And our clever colonial countess had all her own way with the folk, And we soon had an orderly household, thrifty, yet stately withal, And two years after the wedding there came a young heir to it all. I think she had honestly tried to help the poor Earl in his fits And moods, till it plainly appeared he was fairly out of his wits, Harmless enough, but nothing was left of his brains but the husk, And he muttered a deal to himself as he wandered about in the dusk. I had not seen him for years, till I met him this evening, by chance, In the wood, and as soon as he saw me, he looked with a furtive glance This side and that, like a wild beast, to find what way he could go, For we were on the narrow path 'tween the rock and the river below. So he turned right round, and made for the beechwood, sir; but my stride Is longer than his, and soon I was walking along by his side; I hoped that my good Lord was well; and his folk would be glad to see More of him now and then: and did he remember me? We used to go fishing together; and would he not like now to try— The stream was in beautiful trim—to cast a line and a fly! “I seem to have seen you before,” he knitted his brows, and said, As if he were catching at something; “My friend, have you long been dead? Why are you all so restless? this place now is haunted with ghosts; They come out singly by day, but at night they are trooping in hosts; No one sees them, but I; it's the second sight, you know, Sir Lachlan brought when he married the heiress long ago.” Poor fellow! He had been fumbling a while with his seals and chain, Still looking this side and that for a way of escape, but in vain, Till now when he suddenly plunged down into a deep-sunk dell Strewn with bracken and moss, where the shy deer love to dwell. I saw them leaping up near, and laying their horns on their back As they sought for a lonelier dingle, while he went on in their track; And there was a lump in my throat, sir, as I sat me down on a stone, And heard him mutter and stumble and still keep hurrying on. Think of it, sir; when you climb there up to the top of the Ben, Up through the oak and the pine wood, and the birch and juniper, then Up through the belt of heather, and past where the moss only grows, Till you reach the bare scalp of the rock with its lichens and rifted snows; And there as you stand, at last, looking north and south and west, Far as the eye can see from the crag of the eagle's nest, Cornland, woodland, moorland, every acre is his, And the villages down on the beach where the wild wan water is: And there are three old burghs too, paying him stents and dues, With hamlets maybe a score, and farms and crofts and feus, And over the highland border there are miles of moor and moss, You cannot see from the Ben, where the deer their antlers toss. And yonder he is, poor fellow, wandering by night in the dew, Hurrying by day through the thickest shades of the pine and yew; It's Nebuchadnezzar once more summering, wintering out Among the black horned cattle, or where the screech owls shout. What a heritage that, sir! a cup filled up to the brim, Yet never a drop can he taste, and it stands there mocking at him! There is my boy now, barefoot, paddling about in the stream, His life is a fact at least, but the Earl's—it is only a dream. What can you make of it, sir? Is it Fate, as the people aver? Our Lady is shrewd, and they tell me the young Lord takes after her, Is more of the squatter kind than the noble of high degree, But good at his books, and his manners, like her, are frank and free. I have not much faith in weirds, though the Lord's law says, it is true, The third and fourth generation may reap the wrong that you do; Yet God does not do much cursing, nor tie it in long entails, Not in the female line, but still to be heired by the males. And I have some faith in Love, that it might have brought all right, As sunshine quickens the seed with its play of warmth and light; Yet he never got much of that, sir, from sister, mother, or wife, And I cannot get over the thought, that they wasted a gentle life. Never a pleasanter lad, sir,—nothing was wrong with him then— Cast e'er a line on the river, or stalked the red deer in the glen; But they must thwart his first love, and none to give him had they— And then, forsooth, it was Heaven had taken his reason away. Ay, ay! God and heaven, it's little we heed their say, When good might come of our keeping the strait and narrow way, But they're handy to lay the blame on, when things go wrong at last, And you need a glisk of religion to glamour the days that are past. PROVOST CHIVAS The story of Peter Williamson revealed, in the last century, a strange tale of the kidnapping of boys in our towns by the magistrates and leading citizens, and sending them to the Plantations virtually as slaves. That is the origin of this poem. Come, Martin, don't stand stiffly there; Be seated now, and draw the chair A little closer to the fire; It's winter weather, see, without; And I would talk with you about Old days, before our day expire. What will you take, now? Nothing! nay, I know what you are about to say; You know your place: but that is pride— You think you are quite as good as I; And so you are; there, don't be shy: Your place is here, man, at my side. Look, Martin; we are growing old: Why should you be so stiff and cold, And look as if you hated all— The wine, the table, and the seat, The Turkey carpet 'neath your feet, The very pictures on the wall? I stopt you on the high street once, But you—you gave me not a chance To tell you what was in my heart; Though I was Provost at the time, You looked at me as if a crime Might bring me soon to the hangman's cart. And Bailie Webbe was at my side, And vowed for such contempt and pride He would have had you in the dock; Of course, I did not dream of that, But yet you might have raised your hat, And done for once like other folk. Nay, Martin, do not turn away; Our day is short, our hairs are grey, It's time to grease our boots for going; Why should we fall out, when we meet, Like strange dogs snarling on the street? We have small space for quarrels growing. I mind me, we were boys together; In summer's sun and winter weather We padded, barefoot, to the school; Boys were not nice and dainty then With shoes and hats like little men; They bred us on the Spartan rule. As lads too we were seldom parted, True friends and loving and one-hearted, Though now and then we had our jars; Each night I would convoy you home, Then back with me you needs must come, Talking of poetry and the stars, Or of the sermon we had heard On Sabbath from the Holy Word, Or of the minister, good and true, Who christened us, and made us sit Together, when the time was fit, Down at the holy table too. Ay, ay! It's good to think of these Old days and high solemnities, That linked us close when we were youths: Why should we not have many a walk Together still, and cheerful talk About these everlasting truths? Well, yes; I grant the blame was mine At first, yet lately it was thine Who would not help to heal the breach: And, man, it does not mend one's song To know that one was in the wrong, When friends went drifting out of reach. It could not well be helped, besides; This man must walk, while that one rides: And even the holy prophet says That in this race of life, of course, The footman runs not with the horse, And so we took our several ways; And I grew rich, and you were poor; Yet you've the best of it, I'm sure, My money, man, it's like a curse: I wish you had it—no, I don't; For sure there is no blessing on't, And it would only make you worse. Yes, Martin, houses, lands, and gold Bring little comfort when you're old, Or honours which the world can give: But you've had love to sweeten life, A happy home, and faithful wife, Though that wild laddie made her grieve. Now, do not sniff and sneer at me; Folk call me Lord by courtesy, But not in scorn, nor yet in sport; Remember I've been Provost twice, And given the government advice, And was presented too at Court. You should respect my office, even If to the man may not be given The honour which he thinks his due;— And for your son, no doubt, it's sad, Although he was a worthless lad, If all accounts of him be true. They say he broke his mother's heart; They say that he was art and part With them that robbed the County Bank— Well, well; it's natural for you To say that's false; they say it's true; And sure enough he swore and drank. Only a thoughtless boy!—more shame To bring dishonour on your name, And vex a mother fond and true! And she was all that, I am told— Indeed, I know—as good as gold; And such a comely woman too! Ah! Martin, you were fortunate To find so excellent a mate; Though she is gone now, is she not? Gone to a better, happier land— Give me a grip, man, of your hand; But death is our appointed lot. Ay, ay! this world is full of change; A tangled hank it is, and strange, With ups and downs, and loss and gain, And here to-day, and there to-morrow, And nothing certain here but sorrow:— Enough to puzzle heart and brain. Nay, nay; don't go yet, Martin, stay; You've heard about your son, you say? I'm glad of it for your sake, man: But for this trumped-up story now, It's quite absurd, you must allow, And you must stop him, for you can. He'll get into worse trouble yet Unless he holds his peace on it, I warn you fairly while it's time; They say that from his earliest youth He ne'er was known to speak the truth, And was convicted once of crime. That may be false, or may be true; But, Martin, I appeal to you: You are a man of sense: just think! To charge those men who represent Order and law and government, That they at any crime could wink! The Provost, Bailies, City Clerk, The men of highest rank and mark, The rulers of your native town, And men of Quality, beside, Who shall be nameless, but are tried And faithful servants of the Crown, Was ever judge or jury yet Could be persuaded these had set Common and Statute law at nought? They're liker, man, to hold that he Is guilty of lese-majesty— And that's a grave crime even in thought. It's true there were some gutter boys— Rogues, always bent on thievish ploys— Who, for the town's good and their own, Were 'prenticed to some honest men In the plantations, now and then— Good riddance too as can be shown. And if you'll read them I will lend The grateful letters that they send About their happy life abroad, With plenty wage, and plenty food, And pious ministers and good Who guide them on the better road. 'Twould do your heart, man, good to read What wholesome, useful lives they lead, Instead of prowling in the street, Now begging bits, now stealing bits, And living badly on their wits, With ill-clad backs and ill-shod feet. And for the Indians, now, they say These hardly ever come their way, And when they do, it is to truck Powder and guns for beavers' skins, And drops of drink for moccasins, Or horns of buffalo or buck. A better country theirs than ours Where cadgers claim their rights and powers, And tinkers will have law on you! I sometimes wish that I were there, Free from the burden and the care Of thankless work I have to do. But for your son, you'll stop his plea; Of course, it's nothing, man, to me, Although it's hard, when one is old, To have been Provost once, and then Be charged with stealing boys and men, And selling them for lust of gold. I'm glad for your sake that the lad Turns up again, though he was bad Before, and seems no better now; But if he will persist to blame His betters, there's against his name Enough to hang him yet, I trow. Just tell him, if he'll hold his peace, And bid that lawyer's “clavers” cease, Who says whate'er he's paid to say, The town wants someone to engage For little work and plenty wage, And I might put it in his way— A bribe! no, no; it is not fit That you should look that way at it; Martin, you pull me up too short: I only meant, if he should want A job of work—and work is scant— It's well to have a friend at Court. And he must choose between this chance And being led a bonny dance, Through courts of Law, for crimes and debts,— Hame-sucken, stouthrief, common theft, Smuggling, and heavy claims he left For gambling and horse-racing bets. Or man or boy, it matters not; These pleas against him will be brought, And there's a long purse too behind; Think ye that Provost, Bailies, Clerk Will let a messan-dog come bark Right at their heels, and never mind? It is not reason, man: be sure They'll play their game, and find a cure For their hurt honour at any cost; They'll plea it in the inner court, They'll plea it to the last resort Before they let the game be lost. Law is the hardest mill to grind, Nor is it water, man, or wind, But gold that makes its wheels to go, And ere the Inner House we're through, I doubt it will be hard for you A plack or penny more to show. But you can stop it if you will; And maybe manage even to fill The purse which it would empty soon: Now, do not play the fool, and rob Your age for such an idle job, Which is like reaching for the moon. I do not say the thing was right Exactly, now I have more light, Though no one blamed it at the time; The very ministers would say, Each time the laddies went away, It saved them from a life of crime. We gave them clothes, we gave them meat, And shoes and stockings for their feet, Which seldom they had known before: We saw too their indentures writ, And signed and sealed as sure as wit Of man could do. What could we more? And when the ship would sail away, We had a minister to pray With the poor laddies, as was right. And oh, how earnest they would plead That waifs and prodigals, the seed Of righteous men, might yet get light! And now to charge us with offence, Because we made, perhaps, some pence— It was a trifle at the most— Clearing our streets of rogues and thieves Who grew there thick as Autumn leaves That from November woods are tossed! Think, Martin; to be charged with crime, I who have lived here all my time, Respected in my native town! And, maybe, see my little gear, Gathered through many a busy year, Escheated some day to the Crown! That's hard, you surely must allow: And all for what? Just tell me how Was I to know these Chippeways— Incarnate fiends!—would hack and hew, And burn and torture, as they do: That is, if all is true he says? Nay, Martin, do not look like that, And knit your brows, and grip your hat; Well; yes, it's true that I did make Some statement once about your child— For I with rage and fear was wild— And maybe it was a mistake. I wronged him? yes; he may have been All that you say; for I am clean Distraught and maddened now about This business; will you not have pity? 'Twill bring shame on your native city: And you could easily pull us out. Give me some drink, then, if you'll not Take it yourself: it's some I got To toast our friendship once again; But that, it seems, is not to be— My hand is shaking: let me see, What was I saying?—Yes, it's plain: You mean to plea this case, and I Will fight it, till the day I die, Through Outer House and Inner House, And House of Lords, though there should be No more of all my property Than might give house-room to a mouse. It's war—and all is fair in war: Things can't be worse than now they are; And you and yours what should I heed? I'm to be once more Provost soon, And we'll all sing the self-same tune, For all the Council are agreed. We will not brook this scaith and shame, We will not lose our own good name, For vagabonds and gutter bairns, The town is better far without; And he is like the rest, no doubt, Of no more use than bracken ferns. Ay! leave me now: I tell you true, It shames me to have bowed to you, A fellow poor as any rat, Who thinks to fight the Clerk and me, The Bailies, too, and Quality, With such a trumpery tale as that! I thought at first you had some heart, Some sense, at least to play the part Which any man of judgment would: But there: I'm done with you: away! You'd better make friends while you may, You'll need them, for our names are good. There's Little-mills and Chokit-burn, Woodside and Tarvet, Drums and Durn And Beeswood, too, and Otterslack, And Bailie Webbe, and Bailie Sym, And the Town Clerk—take note of him— He has the bank, too, at his back. And you would mell with all of these! Man, saw ye ever a skep of bees O'erturned, and how they buzz and sting: I pity you, with such a crew Upon you, and the lawyers too, And all the heavy costs they bring. Take thought, e'en yet, while it is time: It's a grave thing to charge a crime On honest men and Magistrates: Better your son had never come Than bring such ruin on your home, And also waste our braw estates. Remember all our early days, Remember all our kindly ways, Remember that bit post of profit, With little work and plenty wage: I think I almost might engage That you should have refusal of it. You will not? Nay, then, off with you! And do the worst that you can do; I've been too humble to you, sir. (Solus.) Woe's me! the house and land and gear, And Provost's chain and badge next year! And oh, 'twill make an awful stir! MORGANA Oh, green are the pines of the Barleywood, And the drooping birches are fair to see, And bonnie the carpet that summer weaves Of the green overlapping bracken leaves; And the spring bluebell and anemone You might bind up there in sheaves. And blythe are the birds in the Barleywood, Where merle and mavis and woodlark sing, And the cushat croodles high unseen, And the cuckoo calls from the bracken green; And sweet are the smells that the wind-wafts bring, When the morning airs are keen. But woe is me for the Barleywood! There's a pang in my heart for every tree, And for every bird in the wood that dwells, And for every waft of the woodland smells; The pang of a cruel memory For all its buds and bells. For fairest things may dreariest be, And sweetest of songs most sad to hear, When tree and blossom and bird and flower All link them on to a woeful hour, And bring the past and its sorrow near The heart to overpower. There were two lovers that sought my love— Ay me! but it's ever so long ago— One was beautiful, young and brave, But the other was noble and rich and grave: And how should a silly young maiden know Fittingly to behave? I had no mother to guide me right— Ah, woe! for a thoughtless girl like me! And my father he left me all the day, And went to his sleep in the evening grey; And how should a foolish maiden see Rightly to guide her way? I loved my beautiful youth and brave— Lack-a-day! I was still in my teens— Yet I longed for the wealth and the noble name, But I had not a thought of sin or shame; And how should a girl know what it means To keep from evil fame? My Lord, he came, when the day was high— And oh but the hours went heavy and slow— But my Love stole quietly up to my side, And low at my feet in the evening sighed, And then would the hours like minutes flow In the happy eventide. My Lord, he would hold my worsted hank, Pleased when my needle was briskly plied; But my Love would not hear of work to do When he was with me, and well he knew To make the happy hours swiftly glide With love that was always new. And close to his heart he clasped me once— Oh what so sweet as a love-embrace? My Lord, he would only touch the tip Of my little hand with a dainty lip, And then smile prettily into my face, And let the little hand slip. But my love he clasped me once and twice— How I thrilled all through in his fond embrace! And he vowed, if ever my Lord should dare To hold me so, that he did not care What might happen of foul disgrace, He would not leave me there. I wist not then what his words might mean, But oh his look it was fierce and wild, It frightened me so, that I bade him go: And my Lord he spake to me sweet and low, Next day and next, and I heard and smiled, And did not say him No. But by and by a low whisper ran— It should have blistered every tongue— Ran through the evil-speaking place, Whisper wicked of foul disgrace: And I so simple and pure and young! Oh it was vile and base. He was a villain, I said, and lied— Ah me! what can a poor girl do?— He lied, he lied: I had nothing to hide; Yet, he struck me down there by his side, Pierced my heart with a falsehood through: Oh how the villain lied! My Lord, he came of a noble race, And yes! his heart it was noble too; Lo! now, he said, this lie has gone All through the city, and there are none, But only I, that believe in you, And still keep loving on. But I have trusted you, and I trust— I took his hand, and I kissed it then— Yes, I trust, for I know you true, And I should die if I doubted you; And I scorn the women and viler men Who lie now as they do. Then let the wedding bells ring out, And let the priest make haste and come; Our name was ever without a stain, And they will tattle and talk in vain, When we to the altar go, and home Return together again. It was a hard and a cruel place, Where every man of his neigh bour spoke, And evil report of sin or wrong Grew louder still as it went along, Till on some happy life it broke, And silenced its happy song. Had I only thought! But my heart was hot; I am certain now that he was belied, For there were women that hated me Because men said I was fair to see; And women will humble woman's pride, False as the tale may be. But I was mad: and I said, he lies; Oh is there none who will take my part? Were I a man, I would lay him low, And who shall give him a right death blow, Him I will love with all my heart For slaying the villain so. Slowly, slowly my Lord he rose— And oh but he looked grave and sad: And he bent him low, and he went his way, Never a word then did he say, And my heart leaped up, and I was glad, Until the close of day. But all that night I found no sleep, Tossing in restless, troubled thought; I said I would love my Lord truly and well, I said I was happy; and yet there fell Such gloom on my heavy heart as brought Horror on me like hell. All through the night I lay, and tossed, Wearily longing for the day, And rose at dawn in a troubled mood, And hied me away to the Barleywood, And through its dewy glades took my way, Where the air was fresh and good. Sweet smelled the pines of the Barleywood, And oh I shall never forget the birds, They gathered about me, and had no fear, And sang the thought of my heart as clear As if they were speaking it out in words; His lie shall cost him dear! And I too sang, yet I was not glad; I said I was, but it was not so: I sang as the mad folk I have known Sing, when their heart is like a stone, But I could have wept with joy to know No fell deed had been done. Just then, and ever so near, I heard— Ah me! how they ring in my heart this day! Two shots, and a thud on the dewy grass— O heart! my heart, how it sank, alas! Oh cruel madness, and evil day That brought this thing to pass! Well did I know what had befallen— As well as if I had seen it all: Great Lords have a steady hand and eye, They sleep, and they do not fear to die: But my young Love for sleep would call, And it would not come nigh. Well did I wot what had befallen— As well as if I had seen it all; And out of the wood I rushed, and there My Love lay dead in the morning air, Close by the mossy brambly wall, Upon the moorland bare! I fell on him, and I clasped him close— Oh how the love of him all came back! Men were near me, standing about, But I only saw the blood oozing out From his dear mouth in a thread-like track, That killed all hope and doubt. Beautiful there in death he lay, But ah the cold damp on his brow! Oh my beautiful, young, and brave! I—it is I that have dug your grave! And oh that I were but with you now! For Death is the boon I crave. I kissed his mouth—I kissed his cheek— O Love, my love! I wildly cried: The red blood stained my mouth and chin, And the stain of it was on my soul within; For I was his murderer: yes, he lied: But oh my sin, my sin! It was in the madness of Love he lied: And I—I loved him in spite of it: Come back, my Love: come back, my Life: Will none of you thrust in my heart a knife? For I surely might overtake him yet, And be his own true wife. He lied, but I would have done it too, Had he been false to his love and me; Leave us here: how I hate you now; There's a lock of fair hair on his brow— I have curled it oft on my finger; see It knows my finger now: Oh I would not give that lock of hair For all your lordship and your land: But bury us both together here; And come not hither to drop a tear, You who slew him with your hand, And me with the murderous cheer. Mad I was and unjust to him— What would you have from a breaking heart? He was too noble to take it ill; Besides, they hurried him down the hill, And far away to a foreign part Where he is wandering still. They made a bier of the green pineboughs— Ay me! the Barleywood pines are sweet! A bier for him and a bier for me, For I was as like to death as he, And they bore us down to my Father's seat, A woeful sight to see. Yet I lived on, who would have gone So glad with my love to his early rest; My hair grew white, but not with years, And I lived down all their lies and sneers, But with a heavy heart in my breast, And many sighs and tears. Never I saw my Lord again, Never I wished to see his face; Yet he was sure of a noble strain, Trusty and true; but it would be pain Recalling the tale of foul disgrace, And all that past again. One thing only has made me glad— After the healing mercy of God— The day of the Duel now is past; And never shall maiden stare aghast, As I did then, on the blood-tinged sod Where my dead Love was cast. MRS. COVENTRY Whisht! John; why should you aye complain Of trade and profits being bad, And cry about your little gain, And moan at every loss you've had? You have more money than you know What to do with, man. God has blessed Your labour, and you ought to show His bounty has not been misplaced. Sometimes I almost pity Him, Sometimes I'm clean ashamed to pray, Seeing our cup filled to the brim, And so much goodness thrown away! It must be hard to bear, I think, To be replenishing folk's store With wealth of clothes and meat and drink, And hear them crying still for more. It's easier learning how to win, Than how to use, wealth as we should: And though we gain it without sin, It's sin to have, and do no good With what we have; and, what is worse, It eats the heart like rust or rot: Think, now, if there should be a curse Wrapt up in every hoarded note. When we were young, John, we were poor, And yet we were far richer then; We sent no beggar from the door, Nor grudged the wage of working men: We had enough, and some to spare For them that were worse off than we; And there was sunshine in the air Each night when you came home to me. But now the pocket's buttoned up, The beggar comes not to our door, He knows there's neither bite nor sup For tramps, as used to be before: Ah well! maybe they're mostly rogues: There were rogues too when we were young, Yet none were driven away like dogs; And even tramps' hearts may be wrung. There's none will speak to you as I Am free to do, who love you best: I dare not flatter you, and lie With a false heart upon your breast. And, O John, but your wealth has made A hard bit on that breast for me, That does not give an easy head, And is not as it used to be. O ay! you give me all I need, And more than all I care to get For gowns and gawds, and meat to feed Us all, and ne'er to be in debt; There's plenty on ourselves to spend, E'en more, I think, than's good for health; But, think ye, was that God's chief end In giving you that heap of wealth? I've heard you say it's hard to find Investments safe—and thought that odd: But here is one just to your mind, A good investment, John, with God: They never lose who lend to Him, They get good interest, indeed; And that poor man who broke his limb, Has five wee, helpless bairns to feed. Nay do not grudge it, man: God loves A cheerful giver: e'en be glad That you can help the bonnie doves Left hungry there at home and sad— There; take it back; I want to get A blessing for you, John, from heaven; But they who grudge to pay their debt To God, shall find no blessing given. We have no bairns at our fireside; God would not send His children here To folk whose hearts are full of pride, And set on hoarding worldly gear. They'd only learn, what makes them worse, To hanker for the gold they see:— No; this is not a house to nurse God's little ones, as they should be. And who's to heir it all, since we Are childless? Is it not a sin To leave a fruitful legacy Of quarrels to the next of kin, When we could gladden many a home, And brighten many a sunless life, And lift up for the days to come, Maybe, some hapless child or wife? How freely, John, we used to give To every holy cause and good, When it was hard enough to live, For then you would do as you should; The Kirk was never then forgot, You never did neglect the poor, You pitied too the sick man's lot, And sought his comfort and his cure. Yet then your mite was more to you Than is your five-pound note to-day, For there was something you must do Without, to give the mite away; You wore the old coat for a time, That some one might get warmth from you; And I—I thought the old coat sublime, Because the heart beneath was true. O John, this big house, and the host Of lazy servants, full of meat, And carriages and horses cost The poor what they have need to eat: And cost you too; you used to speak Of books, and made me blythe and gay, But now it's funds through all the week, And markets even on Sabbath day. And you must buy a fine estate, And shoot your rabbits and your hares, And dine and visit with the great, And sometimes even put on their airs, And send your poachers to the gaol, And set your keepers o'er the fish:— O man, can ye forget how well Ye liked to catch a dainty dish? That's a braw greenhouse; and it's true I like the bonnie flowers; but yet You made me happier, John, when you Brought me the box of mignonette. The greenhouse speaks to me of gold, And it may bide, or may depart; But still I keep the box that told About the kind and thoughtful heart. O man, let 'Change and Market be! Let others get their turn; and come, Just think how pleasant 'twere to see Once more the old sweet kindly home, To read together in the mirk, Together mercy to invoke, To walk together to the Kirk, And do some good to other folk. I'm weary of this grand display, And hearing of the rise and fall Of prices; would I were away From ships and yarns and funds and all: Oh, if the Lord would only take, And lift our hearts to things above! Or else some bank, perhaps, would break And leave us nought but health and love? MOTHER AND STEPMOTHER Oh my baby, my sweet, my Own! Oh joy, to have one to love like this! And love like this to be so bestown! Oh the wonder of it, and bliss! Look at me, baby, with those deep eyes, Smile to me, baby, with those soft lips! Oh, the tremulous thrills that rise At the fine touch of those finger-tips! And yet you fill me with fear and awe, God's little child, that He gave to me To rear you up in His Love and Law, For the life that is, and that is to be; Lo, Heaven is looking out from the blue And solemn depths of those great eyes; How shall I keep you pure and true? How shall I make you good and wise? I promised to mother those babes of his, And oh, I have tried to pay my vow; But I did not know what a mother is, I did not know as I know it now. I loved them for his sake, and always will; Poor motherless babes, I love them yet; But motherless babes they must be still, For I cannot love them like you, my pet. They're very nice, and they've been so good, And they really are fond of me, as they say; But they're not like my blossom of ladyhood, And they have not their father's gentle way. No doubt, they take after the mother, and she Was vulgar—her picture shows that right; And there's something in them—it is plain to see They never will grow to be ladies quite. Well, yes; she was pretty, and so are they; She has sandy curls, and she wears a wreath, And her eyes are meaningless, cold and grey, And her lips are parted to show her teeth. She has dumpy hands, but she thinks them fine— It's all in her picture, baby, dear— And the painter has hinted a sullen line Across her brow, with a shade of fear. I often look at that picture now Which hangs in the nursery, as it should, And I watch for the faint line on the brow When her children are ever in angry mood; I never have seen it, I'm bound to say, Though it may come yet, as they grow old; Still I never have seen it, and never may,— Yet these things run in the blood, I'm told. He does not speak of her much to me, Though he does to his children, which is right; I tell him to do it, and sometimes he Sits by their beds, and talks at night. For oh, were I taken, my pet, from you, I should like you to hear of me from your father:— Should I like him to give you a step-mother too? Nay, let us die together rather. I talk to you, baby, as I can Unto no other but you, my pet: There's a nook in my heart which my own good man— And he's very good—has not been in yet: It is there where I think of his former wife, And the picture up in the nursery, And wonder if they had peace or strife, And if he could love her as he loves me. O baby! it's hard to fill my post! But yes! I will love her children more; They shall not feel that for you they lost One touch of the love that they had before. I cannot give them my own baby's part, That's yours, my darling, whatever befall; But oh, your coming has filled my heart More and more with the love of all. BAILIE BUTTERS AND YOUNG DINWOODIE Two men in a cosy Hostel sitting By a sea-coal fire, in a cheerful light, While past the window were shadows flitting Through the fog of a dull November night, Were cracking their walnuts after dinner, With dry-palate olives to flavour the wine, Hardly feeling like saint or sinner, But that it was good for a man to dine. One was a smooth, smug, florid, pot-bellied, Clean-shaven man, of a portly mould, With tremulous cheeks, as if nicely jellied, And coloured with port-wine rich and old; The other an Exquisite, long-limbed, sprawling Low on an easy soft-cushioned seat, Lisping his words, and slowly drawling Thoughts that ran on at a fever-heat. Quoth the pot-bellied one: “You were saying Life's not worth living; you're wrong, sir, quite: This world, though it's not just for idling and playing, Is the best of all worlds if you take it right. It is not the heaven folk see before 'em, When they fall in love at a country dance, But I've seen more than you of its variorum, And I'd live it again, if I had the chance. Not worth living, sir! If you are sober, Honest and willing to do its work, Hating a rogue and a thief and a robber, And playing a fairly good knife and fork— For I admit that if one is dyspeptic, He cannot well live as a good man should: His bad digestion will make him sceptic Of all that is happy and right and good— But let him be sober and prudent and willing To work, as he should, till his sixty years, With his wits about him to turn a shilling, And know a good thing, when his chance appears,— Let him be civil, and follow the leading Of common sense just, whatever he's at, And his life shall be pleasant as novel-reading— And I am myself now a proof of that. I was poor enough when I was a lad, sir; Hadn't a copper for some folk's pound; Yet most of them, by and by, went to the bad, sir, And God knows where they are now to be found; But I worked at anything that was going, And I saved up every penny I could; And my ventures grew as my cash was growing, And whatever I promised, my word was good: Yes! I was poor, when first I started, And should have been poor still, according to you, If God does not care though we're all broken-hearted, But just goes His own way whatever we do; Yet here I am, sir; I'm nobody's debtor, And I lay a calm head on my pillow at night, For God has been good—He could scarce have been better— To order things rightly, because I did right. Now if I had taken to gambling and drinking, Do you think I should be where I am to-day With funds in the Bank and the Stocks—though they're sinking Almost a quarter, I'm sorry to say?— Never, sir. But there's a God up in heaven Who always takes care of respectable folk; And what better proof of it could there be given?— I feel that my faith is placed firm on a rock. I had not a shilling once; but I determined That I would take warning by what I had seen; And look to me now: not a judge ever ermined Drinks better port wine, with a conscience more clean; My wife is a model; my children are pictures; My business is thriving; my home, come and see How its happiness wholly refutes all your strictures, And tells a plain tale for my Maker and me. Oh, I'm grateful to Him! Yes; of course, I've had losses; There is no life without ups and downs here below; But mine have been mostly benevolent crosses, Where the balance came right, as the ledgers will show. So in me He finds nothing but thankfulness truly That I am not like some who have wasted His gift, That I never gave way to a passion unruly, And when things at the worst were, I always made shift To believe in His providence; and I have seen it, For every thing throve with me well from the first; I am sure not an hour of my life, or a minute, But He faithfully saw to my hunger and thirst. But it all depends, sir, on doing your duty, And carefully laying your doubts on the shelf, And keeping your head clear of women and beauty, To make it the best of all worlds—for yourself.” To him then, the Exquisite: “Ah, it is pleasant To meet, now and then, an exceptional case, A man who is really content with his present, Content with himself, and his prize in the race: Not that I think, now, you should be contented; I could not, though I had your luck, sir, instead Of the emptiest life that was ever invented; But I call no one happy, until he is dead. You've not seen the end yet. The cup running over May be dashed from your lips, and its treasures all spilt: Most likely it will; and your friend then and lover Will look on your trouble as if it were guilt. We are playthings of Nature, and Nature is cruel; She mocks us with favours to break our hearts worse; To-day, she adorns us with some precious jewel, To-morrow, the jewel of life is its curse. We have pure thoughts of love, we have high thoughts of goodness, We glow with fine feelings, and call them divine, While Nature is raging in wrath, or in lewdness, And planning an earthquake, or twisting the spine. And why has she made us so, but for the keen edge Which conscience can put on the pain we must bear? And we fondly look on to a happy serene age, While she has made sure of its sorrow and care. Oh, your life has been filled full of mercies and blessings, Wife and children and all that your heart can desire; Your God whom you trust has been kind and caressing, And how can you praise Him enough and admire! Well; I hope it may last, sir; but sometimes one's children Have broken the hearts that they once made so glad— I don't say yours will; but it's rather bewildering When our mercies turn out the worst ills we have had. You think it's all goodness that sends you your treasures; And yet your heart sinks at a fall in Consols, And there is a bitter drop mixed in all pleasures, And there is a vague longing still in our souls: Why can this Goodness not heartily give us What cannot be lost, and what fills up our peace? And why does He grudge all at once to relieve us, And bid fear and trouble and sorrow to cease? Was it Goodness that fashioned the tiger? and hollowed The fang of the cobra that bites in the dark? And what was the fond line of thought which it followed When it planted the teeth in the jaws of the shark? Or the love that created those lizards and dragons, And mail-clad the fishes, when earth was but slime! It could wait through long æons for ploughshares and waggons, But for carnage must not lose a moment of time! We blame our fierce soldiery lusting for battle, We number their slain with a horror aghast, We mourn the waste land, without homestead or cattle, Through which the fell march of their armies has past; Yet what have they done but what Nature is doing On a yet grander scale all the days and the years, For she either is battling, or else is renewing Her strength for the war, with its woes and its tears. Just look at the ants on their slave-stealing forays; What goodness and mercy impel them to go? Or gaze on the tender young lambs in the corries As the ravens scoop out their meek eyes in the snow: And perhaps it was love armed the midge and mosquito That curse the bright warm summer day to us all, And the wasp and the hornet are owing to it too, And the centipede hid in the old mossy wall. Nay, but Nature is fierce, sir, and false too, and cruel, And all through her realm there is war to the knife, All through her years runs the long deadly duel, The constant unpitying battle for life. And what is such life worth? and what of its donor? When each creature takes what advantage he may Of cunning or sickness, and no laws of honour Can stay the fierce hunger, or shelter the prey? Oh, it's not so with man, is it? He has a higher And nobler law which he is bound to obey; Though sprung from the brute, it is his to aspire To a grander and happier life than they! A happy life!—gout-racked or tossing in fever; A noble life!—scrambling for pence in the mire; Oh, you pity the poor Chartist cobbler or weaver, But you leave him for all that to pine by the fire! And then, sir, what need of our huge grated prisons, Our gibbets and soldiers and batoned police, And other the like most convincing of reasons In the best of all possible worlds like this, But that the stronger would keep down the weaker, But that the cunning would outwit the fools, But that the poorer of us and the meeker Must needs be their victims, or else be their tools? Well; but here is a manor-house, yonder a palace, Or a lot of trim villas—sure God must be good! Ay; but what of the millions in closes and alleys Scant of all raiment and light, sir, and food, And the babes that are suckled on whisky or fever, And the girls that ne'er knew a maiden's pure thoughts, And the pains and the aches that the Bountiful Giver Dispenses as freely as dust and motes? No, it is not worth living, this hard life of sorrow; But there is no other, and we must bear on, Toiling to-day without hope of tomorrow, Weary and dull till the light is gone. I once held with you, sir; trying to dream on, In spite of the facts, in a fool's paradise; But if there's a deity, sure he's a demon Who wrings us with anguish, or tempts us with vice. Well spoke the wise Greek in his tragic elation, As he pictured the brave heart Fate held in his mesh, Hurling his scorn at the gods and salvation With the spikes of the Caucasus piercing his flesh. High-souled the Greek was, moral and fearless, And his gods must do right: or his soul would rebel; But we must be weak when our life is most cheerless, With a lie in our mouth saying, It is all well.” So they sat there—the two of them—talking and drinking, And eyeing the ruby light-gleam of the wine, Well pleased with their talk, for they thought they were thinking, And each deemed that he did the secret divine; And each took his bottle there, pleasant and merry, And each with an easy mind then had his nod. And which was the best judge of claret and sherry? And who of the twain was the farthest from God? Oh best of all worlds for the selfish and shifty, Thou art not so good for the noble and true; Oh life well rewarding the prudent and thrifty, How shall the Christ-spirit travail with you? Oh worst of all worlds to the proud heart and faithless! And yet thou canst perfect the meek and the brave; Strange, sorrowful life that in dying is deathless, Glory and majesty, found in a grave. Evil the world is; Life a long battle, Wrestle with anguish, and warfare with sin, Proving the heart of us, trying our mettle By troubles without us and terrors within; And yet 'tis worth living, to-day and to-morrow, The life which God lived in the wealth of His love, Life He made perfect in patience of sorrow, God-life on earth like the God-life above. DEACON DORAT'S STORY This is the saw that cut him down, The last in our place that was hung in chains, Left to bleach in the suns and rains On the gallow-hill of our Burgh town. What he had done I remember not— Sheep-stealing, forgery, some offence Which rich men hate with a hate intense, Nought can appease, but to see the man rot. Of course, in those days it was wrong to kill, Yet murder often escaped the rope; But for him there was not a gleam of hope, Who wrote your name to a cheque or a bill. I say this because, though I am not aware, After all these years, what his crime might be, Had he wrought a murder, it's certain we Would have left the corbies to pick him bare. Yet it was not for that we cut him down; But the gallow-hill stood at the end of the Links, And it spoilt our game at the golfing rinks, That ghastly thing with its grinning frown. And we also thought they might hang, or shoot, Or head the living rogues, as they chose; But it was like a savage to punish those Who were tried already, and dead to boot. And it was not our kindly old Scotch law Which hanged a man, and was done with him: It was only the English that left the grim Corpse for the kite's and the raven's maw. So we vowed to get the thing out of our way; We were young fellows, and apt to think In a wildish way o'er a drop of drink, And the gallows, at any rate, spoilt our play. A dismal night! I remember well The sullen moan of the restless sea, And the rain that plashed on hill and tree, And how my heart thumped at the midnight bell! Ugh! how the creature grinned and mowed, As if he knew what we were about, And thought that his airy perch without Was better perhaps than a grave and shroud. Now and then from the town we heard The night-watch call, but he came not near, And once we paused with a thrill of fear At two or three notes like a singing bird. What was it? where was it? Hushed with awe, We stood for a moment with bated breath; When tripping up to that loathsome death Two merry boys and a girl we saw. Wild black elf-locks, and wild large eyes, Came, weirdlike, tripping along the hill, Singing a merry song, until They saw us there with a blank surprise. “Come hither, now, children: what do ye, At midnight here, by the gibbeted dead? And are ye not fearful now, I said, On the bleak bare hill of the gallows tree?” “Nay,” quoth the maiden straight and tall, “Why should we fear the peaceful dead? He is our father, sirs,” she said; “He is our father,” said they all. There was a lump, sir, rose in my throat, And there was a something that dimmed my sight; But I said, “Would you be glad this night, If this your father again you got?” “Mother will soon be here, they said, She is coming to curse the Law and the Judge, But there is no blessing that she will grudge If you give us our father back instead. “Lo! we will haste, and bid her come, Yea, we will haste, and drive the cart, For she will have drunk to cheer her heart”— Then they hurried away and left us dumb. So we cut him down; and an ugly job It was—may I ne'er do the like again, And we waited a while, in the pelting rain, Under the gallows that we did rob. But the wild elf-locks, and the wild large eyes, And the tripping feet, and the eerie song, We looked for them, and we listened long; Then laughed that we could have believed their lies. We had cut him down; but what now to do, When we had him down, that puzzled us all, For we had not thought of his burial, And it must be done before morning too. We spoke of the river near at hand, But the thing would float there by and by; We thought of the sea where the tide was high, But that would drift him again to land. We could easily climb the Kirkyard wall, But the bedral slept near, wakeful, grim, And the crunch of a spade would waken him, And a glance would tell him about it all. Were ever men puzzled so much before By getting the thing they were fain to get? An' if it had been a burden of debt It could not have loaded our spirits more. We could not carry the creature home, We could not leave it upon the hill! Oh, but it's strange to get your will, And wish you hadn't for days to come! Then up by the winding sandy road A light cart passed by the shooting-butts, Jolting o'er hummocks, and creaking in ruts, And came to the place where we still abode. And with it a gipsy woman we saw, Straight and tall, with a manlike stride, And the three elf-children by her side, And she came cursing the Judge and the Law, Till she saw the Thing that lay at our feet, When she fell on the earth with a wild-beast cry, And clasped it, and kissed it, as we stood by Silent, and hearing our own hearts beat. Then they four lifted it from the ground, And laid it there on the donkey cart; Who shall tell me the thoughts of that wild heart— For she too could love—when her dead she found. “I am better at banning than blessing,” she said, “But what of blessing my lips can give, May it be yours, while you breathe and live, For that ye have given me back my dead. “A rogue and a thief—what else could he be? But rogue or thief, lads, he loved us well; If he beat us too, as our backs can tell, Who had a better right than he? “Fear not the Law shall find out what Ye have done this night; go home and sleep, Sure that your secret is buried deep; I have them near by who will see to that.” She did not weep, and she did not pray, There was not a tremor in her tone, Yet she left us sobbing somehow alone, As into the dark she strode away. That day each street had its eager crowd; Who could have robbed the gallows tree? And the Council met, and the Provost, he Spoke like a minister long and loud. Oh how he fumed like a turkey-cock! We had done despite to the sacred law, We had robbed the gallows of half its awe, We had given authority there a shock. Nobody knew before in the town He could have been half so eloquent; And he was sure he was on the scent Of the law-defiers that “cut him down.” By and by they should find that he The law and its majesty would maintain, And hang the rogue in his chains again, And make those rebels a sight to see. They dredged the river, they searched the shore, They watched the kirkyard, night by night, They questioned here and there, and quite Lost their heads for a week and more. Then one of us just threw out a hint, It must have been witchcraft—and it took With the ministers like a baited hook, Who preached on it without let or stint. That Sunday, sir, we learnt far more Of the Witch of Endor, and her arts For the making of dead men play the parts Of living saints, than for years before. But the Provost, shrewd man, muttered Pshaw! Let the ministers preach and catechise; If the devil had wanted such a prize, What should he do with a workman's saw? But for me I heeded not what they said; For it rung in my head there all day long, That eerie snatch of a gipsy song, And “He is our Father, living or dead.” All the father she ever knew In earth or in heaven—that gruesome thing! And she had come up the hill to sing Her song to him as she used to do! Oh it was pitiful! but when I thought Of that wild night, and its madcap job, I could not be sorry that we did rob The gallows, and gave them what they sought. Better a quiet grave to fill, Where the grass is green, and the daisies grow, And the white thorn scatters its fragrant snow, Than to mock their hearts on the gallow hill. And this is the saw that cut him down, And this is the hand that cleared the Links Of a thing that spoilt the golfing rinks, Now and again, in our Burgh town. THE POETASTER There was a pathos in it, friend, Though you might smile, as I did too, To see that pile of manuscript So strangely from its old trunk crypt Brought suddenly to view. Ah! there are things in this strange life, Which move us unto mirth, and yet Behind the laughter there are tears, And thoughts which in the after years, Bring touches of regret. And oft it is an accident Whether you chance to laugh or weep, But when you call it back again, The laughter has a twinge of pain Which haunts you in your sleep. He was a poor dull-plodding man, So poor he kept not even a bird To cheer his solitude by song, And voice for him the silent throng Of thoughts that find no word. Nor dog, nor cat, nor bird had he, Nor wife nor child had ever come To share the burden of his lot, Which he endured, and murmured not, In quiet patience dumb. And now he lay there cold and dead, And none had watched to see him die; Alone he had lived all his days, Alone he passed from human ways Beneath the All-seeing eye. There was a little loaf of bread— He had not died of hunger then— A little fuel too, and oil, And water in a can to boil If day should come again. Which never came; and when we sought Through press and drawers for aught to give Him decent burial with the dead, As he had always held his head 'Mong them that decent live, Nor gold nor silver there was found, Nor plack nor penny; life had gone Just as the little purse was spent, Which lately had no increment From work that he had done. It had just lasted out his time Through careful scrimping day by day; He had no debt, he had no kin, And there was nought to lose or win, When thus he went his way. But for the money, vainly sought, In a moth-eaten trunk we found A mass of manuscripts—a pile Of papers writ in careful style, Some loose, some rudely bound. Strange gatherings! scraps of every kind, Backs of old letters, envelopes, Half-used account books, paper bags Picked up among the ash and rags And refuse of the shops: And every tattered scrap close writ With pen or pencil, as 'twould bear, With verses on a hundred themes, With pious arguments and dreams, All rhymed with patient care. Oh no; he had no message, none, To wise or foolish, good or bad; No prophet's burden-word he bore, Which he must speak; and what is more, He never thought he had. A silent soul, he went about His daily task, and every night Back to his dingy attic came, Nor dreamed about the coming fame Or setting this world right. None ever heard him hint a thought Of fancied greatness; never line Of his competed for a place In corners which small poets grace; He bottled it like wine. But when his fellow-labourers met With pipe and tankard at the inn, He to his attic would retire, And trim his lamp, and light his fire, And pen his verses thin; And lived unto a good old age, And never begged a bit of bread, And cheered his loneliness with these Bald rhymes about the birds and trees, And living men and dead. There is no sacred fire in them, Nor much of homely sense and shrewd; Imperfect lines, imperfect rhymes, False quantities, mistaken chimes, Yet all the feeling good. There is no envy of the great, There's praise of patriot and saint; If now the story have no point, The reasoning now be out of joint, There is no vain complaint. Hard toil it was for that hard hand To hammer out these limping lines, Harder than handling spade or hod, Or trenching ditch, or delving sod, Or picking in dark mines. Yet night by night he must have writ His verse or two for forty years, Long poems some, some meant for songs, Some voiced the common people's wrongs, Some breathed his own sad fears. But none had ever heard him say How the long evening hours were spent; He never showed the rhymes he writ, Nor tried to see their clumsy wit How it might look in print. Enough for him the silent task, Enough to read the abortive rhyme, Now pleased with this, now touched with that, He knew not why; he knew not what Was pathos, or sublime. Strange passion! thus to jingle words, And hide them in a big old chest! 'Twas but some hours before he died The last was written, and beside The rest in order placed. Yet there was pathos in it, friend; I laughed a little on my road, But the tears got the better soon, It was so innocent to croon His bits of verse to God. PARISH PASTORS LONG AGO There were some five hundred, young and old, Souls in the parish, when all were told, Cock-lairds upon the landward braes, Scattered farmers, and cottar folk, And the fishers who kept to their own old ways In the village that huddled beneath the rock, Where a sheltering cove made a safe retreat For the brown lug-sails of their little fleet; 'Twas the only break in a stormy shore Rock-girdled for ten good miles, and more. Five hundred souls, and they did not care Though neither a Bank nor a Post was there, Nor Doctor to physic their mortal ills, Nor Lawyer to draw their deeds and wills— Ten miles off was a town where these Might be had by them when they please; And farmers, going to market, brought What letters arrived there, now and then, Which maybe had lain for a month, unsought, Spotted with flies in the window pane. Easily went the world with them, They made no struggle its tide to stem, But slumbered as in a quiet bay, And heard its murmuring far away, And grew their oats, and ground their bere, And caught the fish, and fed the steer, And noted the changes of the year. But for the care of their souls they had Of pious and learned pastors three; Not that the way of their life was bad, Or that more godly they sought to be Than their neighbour-folk by the wild North Sea; But just that it had been so of old, And they never thought to enlarge the fold, And gather the flock together there With ampler room and a freer air. So had their fathers done, and they Followed of course in their fathers' way. And the pastors three with their scanty flocks Of cock-lairds, farmers, and fisher folks, Peacefully lived, as brethren should, All of them busy in doing good, Christening, wedding, and burying, each After the manner his Church did teach, And trying on Sundays truth to preach. Dr. Boyack Low on a haugh, by the river side, The homely Manse in its garden stood, With a clump of grand old elms to hide The rough-cast walls, and the paintless wood. And close to it was the parish kirk, But what it was there was nought to tell, Save only a belfry and tinkling bell, Above its rough-cast rubble-work. A humble Kirk, and a homely Manse On the haugh among the trees and rooks; Where the white-thorn hedges had grown, perchance, Unpruned for the sake of the ricks and stooks, For the stooks of corn and hay are more Than a well-trimmed hedge to a household poor: But they helped to make more wildly fair The old Manse-garden, breathing there Of thyme and every sweet herb that grows, And the pink and wall-flower, and cabbage rose. Oh, there the strawberry beds were good, And the gooseberry bushes had golden fruit, And the apple-tree boughs were stayed with wood, They clustered so thick upon every shoot, And the jargonelles on the gable hung Sweet as honey the leaves among: Just a garden for boys and girls, Ne'er while they lived to be forgot; And sunny faces and golden curls Flashed through its trees when the sun was hot— Eight wild boys, and as many maids, In homespun dresses, with unkempt hair, Laughed and sang in the grassy glades, Or gathered the fruits of the garden fair, And gladdened the minister's heart, but yet They burdened it too with a fear of debt. Easy-natured and kindly he, Respectable always in everything; Nothing he did but it had the ring Of cultured mediocrity; In talents, in morals, in learned lore Respectable ever, and nothing more. No special mission had he to preach; No special faculty his to teach; Nor special power of the priestly art Or to console, or move the heart; There seemed no reason why he should be God's servant there in the parish Kirk, Instead of dealing out tape or tea, Or driving the plough from morn to mirk, Save that he read some Latin or Greek, And wrote good words that were smooth and weak. Yet he did his task in a patient way, With doctrine solid, if stiff and cold, Ready, by day or by night, to pray With the sick or the poor that were in his fold— Mostly the farmers and cottar-folk, To all of whom, as they hung about After sermon, the minister spoke Of the weather and crops, and the sheep and nowt, And their rheumatisms, and their girls and boys, And all their commonplace griefs and joys. No high ideal had he to raise Their souls from the level of common ways, Nor passion nor power to stir the mind As with the rush of a heaven-born wind: But well he knew all their homely lot, Their joys and sorrows he ne'er forgot, Could tell what came of the scholar son, And where had the married daughter gone, Had ever the fitting word on his lip, And gripped each hand with the proper grip: That bound their hearts to him fast and true As surest cords of love could do. Little he read, and what he did Was mostly sermons to “fang his pump,” When it ran dry, and the weekly need Rang in his head like a warning trump. Yet though he made complaint that wealth Of letters, alas, was not for him, Being rich in children in hungry health, I trow he was not a man to dim His eyes with poring on musty books; Far better he liked the cawing rooks, The smell of the hay-field, and the talk Of farming folk in a sauntering walk; For what of learning he had was worn Outside, like clothes of the proper trim, But it never was truly part of him, And now it was somewhat rent and torn. He had not a doubt to trouble him, And his faiths were only as corks to swim Through life as easily as he might, And net whatever might come his way; And with the world he would not fight, If he could only get through the day. Yet he was reasonable, and shed A sort of light too along his path, Which not from the heavenly founts was fed, Nor yet from the baleful fires of wrath: It was somewhat earthly perhaps and cold, And led not many into the fold, But yet it did not lead astray, If it only lit up half the way. No lofty purpose in life had he, No spirit earnest and brave and true The glory and hope of God to see; Nor yet a-craving for something new: But he walked with them in the way they trod, And talked with them of the things they knew, And his speech was easy and natural too, Save when he spoke of the things of God. A wholesome nature, and fain to please; Saintship in him had been like disease Which he was ever upon the watch— Though he hardly needed it—not to catch; For to be called Fanatic he Dreaded like sin and misery. Dean Duffus Down in the cove, where the fisher folk Huddled beneath the lighthouse rock, There was a dainty little Kirk Of the old faithful mason-work,— It might have been choir, or pillared nave, Wreck of a church, by the breaking wave, And a great cross on the gable stood; And all within it was fair and good,— Marble altar, and carven font, And silver vessels, as were wont, Under the great black holy Rood. Long it had been but a ruin grey, Roofless, and wasting in slow decay, The mullions all from the windows gone; The carven niche, and the fine-scrolled stone By nettles and long grass hid from view; And the font had been broken and overthrown, And pillar and arch were crumbling too; And the cunning fox had made his lair, And the rook and the jay had nestled there. Some laid the blame upon Knox's wrath; Some held it was swept from the Covenant's path; Some charged it to Cromwell's Ironclads; And some to a raid of the High-land lads. But they who had searched the matter well Read how a great Lord lost a bet, And tore off the roof, and melted the bell, And sold them to pay his gambling debt, After the new Kirk was built away Landward, far from the little bay. And all agreed that a Kirk was there From the days that the Culdee launched his boat, And came with the voice of psalm and prayer, And gospel true to the people brought From the lone Isle of saints that lay Where ghostly mists on the waters slept, But God shone out of the mists by day, And spake in dreams to them when they slept, And ever their souls in quiet kept. So the good Dean, when he came there, Curate or priest, long years ago, Loving a Kirk that was old and fair As the ivy loves round its walls to grow, Had clung to it with a longing heart, And with his own hands cleared a part, Casting out nettles and grass and earth, Till he came to the pavement of solid stone; And whatever of beauty he found, or worth, He sought out its place, and fitted it on. Then with his savings, year by year, He mended a bit, and roofed it in, Living himself on sorriest cheer This trophy again for his Church to win: And now it stood there fair to see In lines of graceful symmetry; A bell once more from the belfry rung, And matin and vesper were daily sung, And the organ pealed, and the common prayer Was sweetly toned to the fishers there. Yet all the wealth of his worldly gear Was less than three-score pounds a year. Near by the Kirk was a cottage small, With a red-tiled roof, and a white-washed wall, A garden plot that was bright with flowers, An old sun-dial to tell the hours, Some carven stones that were broken quite, And might not fit in their places right, Yet were too sacred to be thrown Among the rubbish of common stone, With a green wood-paling to fence all round,— These told where the Dean a home had found. It was not other than all the rest Of the fishermen's huts that there were seen, Save only that it was neat and clean, With an attic chamber for a guest: But the Dean's own bed was in the wall, Hid behind volumes, great and tall, In the little room where he read and wrote, And did the work that a pastor ought. There on the shelves were folios piled; There Benedictine fathers smiled In snowy vellum, crimson-lettered— These, he said, were his golden mines— And high on the upper shelves were scattered Big quartos too of the great divines, And tables and chairs and floor were littered— With books that were scored with scarlet lines; For he was a classic ripe and good, And loved the old wine in the seasoned wood, But all translations were bottled and dead, With an evil taste of the cork, he said. The other room was a kitchen clean, And there no woman was ever seen, But once a day, about noon, his man Lit up the fire for a little can— If it were not a fast, and a fast, at least, Came twice a week to this humble priest— And made for him pulse or porridge sweet, But the Church's Feasts had sodden meat; And if a guest by chance was there, There might be a glass of mildest ale; And an evening pipe to soothe his care Was the one luxury did not fail. Yet was he healthy and strong, nor kept Ever his bed for a day, or slept After the dawn, but rose to pray For his fisher lads in the stormy bay. A tall, lean form with lank grey hair, Bushy his eyebrows, and grey his eyes, Deep sunk in a face that was pale and spare; And he dressed in a threadbare lowly guise. One apron had served him all his days, His newest hat, it was ten years old, His well-brushed coat had a shining glaze, And his great thick shoes had been patched and soled; White was his lawn on the Sabbath morn, But half was darning, and all was worn Into so fine a filament It scarce could be handled without a rent. Yet had he ever so stately an air That rich and poor did understand, Whatsoever his raiment were, He was a man to hold command, And none might slight him in all the land. Old was the world in which he lived, Old the evils at which he grieved, Old were the things that most he cherished, Old were his hopes too, past and perished. He held that it was a sin to own Other than Stuart to sit on the throne, And still did his faith intact remain Now that there was not a Stuart to reign. Therefore a strict non-juror he All the years of his youth had been, Doing his constant ministry In hidden ways, and in spots unseen, Praying for him who in exile lay “Over the hills and far away.” Now law and order he kept, 'tis true, Giving to Cæsar Cæsar's due, But the loyal heart that would have shed Its blood for the kings of the ancient line, Clung to the memories of the dead, And the vanished rule of the Right divine. He fasted still for the martyred Charles, And him who perished on Magus moor, And held that the Parliament men were carles, The devil pricked on to delude the poor, And that gallant Dundee did right to maul The Westland Whigs who were rebels all. But for the new world, and its ways, And all the great hopes of the latter days, Their science and its expanding views, New-fangled craving for latest news, And workmen striking for higher wage, And all that mostly our thoughts engage— For them he kept strictly a yearly Fast, Each year bitterer than the last— It fell when Culloden day begins— And he called it the Fast of All the Sins. So, true to his own ideal, there He chaunted the psalm, and read the prayer, And gathered the lore of ancient times From Latin Fathers and Latin rhymes, Till scholars came from far and near This primitive Pastor to revere; But hardly ever a point was found Where he touched the life that went on around, Moved it, or felt with it as it spoke, Or heeded how its passions woke, Or how its bubbles swelled and broke. The Reverend Richard Rule Landward upon the rolling braes, Wind-swept, and apart from the common ways, Where once had stretched a moorland waste, But now it was covered with grass and corn, Another kirk on a height was placed Among two or three pine trees tempest-torn; And Church of the Wilderness it was named, Built for a prophet-pastor, famed For his doom-speaking words, and his stedfast faith, When the wild dragoons were dealing death; But he lived through the evil times, and saw, Though he would not allow, a better law; And the bonnet-lairds on the rolling braes Had been Cameron's men in the troublous days. A plain square building, never meant To be tricked with carnal ornament, Rough in its stonework, and rude in its lines, Grimly it stood by the ragged pines. There ministered one who held his head High as the Dean, and would not brook King or Parliament, living or dead, Unless the Covenant oath they took: William or George, Charles or James, Stuart or Guelph, it mattered not, Nor what their characters, what their aims, Or whence their claim to have rule was brought; Whether from Bishop's anointing oil, Or from the people who sweat and toil, Or from a long ancestral line Lapt in the dream of a right divine; He would protest against the throne, Unless the Covenant it would own, For this was a Covenant Land, and bound By solemn league to be holy ground, Where Papist, Prelatist, Sectaries all Should ne'er have authority, great or small, Nor should Erastian preach the Word Where the martyred saints of old were heard. He was a small, brisk, cheerful soul, Not a whit gloomy or morose, Apt at telling a story droll, Gay among brethren and jocose, And hardly would he restrain his wit When in grave Presbytery even they sit. Yet in the pulpit he would groan About the defections which he saw, And that he would soon be left alone Even as Elijah to stand by the Law, And by the altar and truth of God, For which our Fathers dyed the sod Red with their own best blood, that we Might have the gospel pure and free. Then would his tremulous voice swell higher, Like the sound of winds among trees that moan, As though some Power did his soul inspire, Nor even the Dean could so finely intone. He, too, was a man of learning, skilled In all polemics since Luther broke Her sleep, and the Church from dreams awoke, And wrath was kindled, and blood was spilled. Well had he conned each mighty tome Of Calvinist, Lutheran, Doctor of Rome, And what the Philistine-Prelate writ, And how the Puritan-David hit The boastful giant with sling and stone, And struck down the mitre that wrecked the throne. The faintest shade of Arminian error Well could his watchful eye detect, And he thundered at it, in wrath and terror, For comfort there of the Lord's Elect. So he deemed he must faithful be Unto the little flock that he Tended and fed amid sore distress In the lonely Church of the Wilderness. Stronger he than the other two, Learning and talent he did not lack; Yet were there some things he could do From which their souls would have shrunken back. He was not so noble, I reckon, as they, At least, he could stoop to a meaner way, And did not feel it, but made a jest Of what would have broken their soundest rest. For the wee cock-lairds that were his flock, They were as hard as the flinty rock; And minded to have their gospel cheap, Letting him sow if themselves might reap; And, maybe, dealing with them had been The blunting of feelings that once were keen; And maybe the children's hungry cry Quenched the gleam of his watchful eye. Five hundred souls, when all were told, Dwelt in the parish, young and old, Well shepherded surely by pastors three Who lived together in amity, And had no quarrels, nor sought to rob Each other's folds of a sheep or lamb, And lived, far off from the noisy mob, In a world of their own that was full of calm. Yet what could they do for the landward folk, Or the fishers beneath the lighthouse rock? What help to their welfare could they bring? What light to shine on the darkening road? What song could they give their hearts to sing When burdened with sorrow or death or—God? What gospel had they to raise the soul Above the weather and crops and beeves, And spur them to run for the grander goal In the world beyond these falling leaves? Respectable one, and easy-hearted, He went about in a kindly way; One lived in a world that had long departed; And one was eager the slain to slay. Meanwhile the people grew their oats, And mended lines and nets and boats, And made their malt, and brewed their ale, And drank at wedding-feast and fair, And harvest-home, and auction-sale; And at the funerals took their share Of heavy wines and waters strong, As they bore the dismal bier along. But there were mothers that were not wives, And there were widows soon tired of weeping, And there were prodigals wasting lives, And sorrowful hearts that lay unsleeping, Through weary nights long vigil keeping, And they had their thoughts about life and death, And sin and mercy and God and faith; And, now and then, from the world without There came to their souls strange wafts of doubt, And things that were not in the catechism; But how to deal with them no one knew. They dreaded heresy, error and schism, But wist not what of these thoughts were true, Or what, if they were, they ought to do: For the three good pastors kept their road, And lightened not any one of his load. Now, times are changed; there are not many more Souls in the parish than were of yore, Yet the pastors three have grown to four; And their thoughts are run in a sharper mould, And a spirit is there which was not of old. It may be, their faith in God is more, But they have not the same faith in each other; It may be, they love Christ as before, But they walk not so lovingly now together. And yet a milder gospel tells Of love that in the Father dwells, And sweeter strains of praise are sung, And bells in graceful spires are rung, And they all walk in stricter ways, And they all spend laborious days. For life is there, and that is good, Though it be young life in its selfish mood— Life is there, with its warmth and power, Its yearning hope, and its eager strife, Its thought unfolding like a flower, Its craving still for a fuller life, Its futile effort, its failing faith, Its fresh revival and confidence, Its error too, like a misty wraith, Ghost of some old forgotten sense— Life with its loves, and hates, and fears, Its wondrous joys, and its bitter tears, Its follies, blunders, useless fights, Its brooding shadows, and mystic lights: Life has broken the slumberous spell, And it is not all good,—yet it is all well. AMORY HILL I Does any one know about Amory Hill? What an unrestful mind she had, Questioning everything, good and bad, Subtle in thought, and firm of will! Beautiful, too, in her way: but what Ever could come of a girl like that? Oh, you remember the large grey eyes; What a keen look in them did lie, Fain to be told the reason why We ever held anything true or wise! And say what you might, she would still find out, Somehow or other, a ground for doubt. Under the Word she must see the Thing, Never content with the neatest phrase; The coin might be of the ancient days, But still she must try if it truly ring, And bite it too with her dainty teeth, For it migth look well, and be false beneath. No matter how old a lie might be, Age, she said, could not make it true; No matter though truth be fresh and new, It was the pleasanter sight to see, Like a fresh star your eyes behold Where never a star had been seen of old. Liked! how could she be liked, a girl Who'd squat her down in a quiet nook Out of the way, with a folio book, While all the rest of us were in a whirl Of work or talk? And she did not heed, If only we left her at peace to read. Of course, her doubts and her questions tried Every one's patience, more or less, And the older folk, when they felt the stress, Were fain their ignorance to hide, And sent her off, with a sharp rebuke, Back again to her folio book. Somehow she never took it ill, Whatsoever you chanced to say; But not in the least did it change her way; She soon had another question still: Never the same one twice, for now She would puzzle it out by herself somehow. What could come of a girl like that, Who would not walk on the common road, Who fretted at bearing the common load, And did not know what she would be at, And was not sure of the common creed, And gave not her dress a moment's heed? O Amory Hill! Amory Hill! And yet how good she was and nice, Scorning a meanness, and hating a vice, With a brave true heart and a patient will, Loving the truth, and not afraid!— What has come of the grey-eyed maid? II I thought you had heard of Amory Hill: It made at the time a mighty stir, But nobody now-a-days thinks of her. We wonder at nothing, good or ill, After two or three days are past— That is enough for a comet to last. Amory grew, as you might expect, From a doubting, questioning, restless elf To a woman who brooded by herself About the Church, and the Lord's Elect, About the fate of the quick and dead, Doubting the more, the more she read. At a Revival some one got A hold of her for a little while; And she sang their hymns with an angel's smile, And tried to live on their shallow thought; But back the questions came, and then Oh, she was deep in her doubts again. She writ a Book that I tried to read, But could not tell what it was about— Just like thoughts that she had thrown out Into the darkness of thought and deed, And heard them in the silence roll Back again on her yearning soul. Poor girl! she wandered, here and there, From pastures green where the grace was rife, Seeking the Way and the Truth and the Life, And finding but shadows and dim despair, Till she came to the perilous brink of Faith, Beyond which lieth the realm of death. Star after star had all gone out, Darkest night was on all her sky; And moaning as one who is ready to die, Ah me! she said, Must I live without God and His Christ and the hope divine, That erewhile gladdened this life of mine? Then one laid hold of her, drew her back From the dismal gloom of that deadly brink, Told her that now she must cease to think, And then no wisdom her soul should lack; If to the Church she would only bow, It would do all of her thinking now. Bland his speech was, and mild his look; Was he an angel come from heaven To save the soul that was tempest-driven There where in terror and pain it shook? And what had all of her thinking brought, Except despair of all certain thought? So straightway into his arms she fell, Cast away Reason, and swallowed the Creeds, Mumbled her aves, and counted her beads, And said it was good in peace to dwell With Nuns who had not a thought in their head— But is it the peace of the living or dead? She does much good to the sick and poor, Going about in that quaint odd dress With the little book which her fingers press: But then she did quite as much good before, For Amory Hill was always sweet, And came like a sunbeam along the street. III Who would know me for Amory Hill, Once the plague and the tease of School, Querying lesson, and breaking rule? And yet I fear I am Amory still, Under the white cap and the hood Of the patient, merciful Sisterhood. I've tried, till I think there is no use trying To be anything other than I was made; I've sought the light, and I've sought the shade, I've crushed my thought, when it rose defying, I've nursed submission, and fondled pain, Yet ever the thoughts come back again. Weary, I'm weary; what shall I do? Oh, will that chatter of theirs not cease? Here I had hoped to have quiet peace In the daily round of duties true, And the tranquil hymn, and the whis— pered prayer, Freed from the burden of trouble and care. Once I wrestled, in earnest thought, With weighty problems of truth and faith, With the high issues of life and death, And what we should not do, what we ought: But here our wrestle is not to think— Can it be more sinful to see than wink? Does God, indeed, mean that we should not bear The burden of thought? or fashion a life Of peace, instead of the noble strife Inspiring ever the soul to dare, And make fresh conquests, if it may, On the realm of darkness, day by day? Oh, but this is rebellion, this is sin: So they tell me, and I have tried To crush it out, and have done, beside, Many a penance for letting it in. But is it sinful? and can it be right To close the shutters, when God is Light? This is the hour when they sit and talk, Oh such nothings! and not without Touches of malice too, all about What they saw in the daily walk To visit the sick and the poor, when they Looked on the world and its wicked way. But why is the world more wicked than they? They were silly girls ere they tool the vow, And they're just as silly sisters now. Ribbons and gawds may be put away, And love and marriage be counted shame, Yet heart and mind may be still the same. How should they differ from what they were?— Hear! how they chatter as school-girls do, And gossip about the folk they knew, And who was married, and who was there:— I blame them not, if they did not blame The world as wicked for doing the same. Are all the people who try to do good As little-minded as those I've known? Ere I came here, how I used to groan At Dorcas meetings in angry mood! And the District Visitors need, I'm sure, Quite as much visiting as the poor. Oh, how I shrank from the vulgar talk. The fuss, and the hard mechanical way Of saving so many souls a day By dropping tracts in a morning walk! Not so, I said, would the work be done Here by the consecrated Nun. But here or there, it is all the same, The talk alike, and the fuss and fret, And the vulgar methods of clearing debt, And the mechanical ways and lame For doing of spiritual work, without The faintest thought what you are about. And then this drilling of hands and lips! So many hours of work a day, So many hours to praise and pray, All of our time cut into snips, And just as you get your mind in swing, There goes the bell with its ting, ting, ting! Was I mistaken in coming here? Was it a hasty step I made? I am still free to go back, 'tis said; And I was not meant for a Nun, I Fear. But they are all pleased with their happy lot, And what would they think if they knew my thought? It's nonsense what people were wont to say About the misery vows may bring, About the hearts that are suffering, And the glad bright youth as it wastes away; There is nothing to waster, for they have no mind, Nor heart, nor passion of any kind. And yet I feel that I am not free. Oh, the subtle threads that are wound About us here till our souls are bound, And there's nothing for it but just to be As silly as all the rest, and make A merit of it for Jesus' sake. I gave up my former life in dread Of the rush of thoughts to my eager soul, Terrible as the waves that roll Over the weary swimmer's head; But now if I leave this, it will be In scorn of its dull vacuity. Ay, if I leave it! but dare I go? Do I not know what would be said Better it were to be lying dead Than pine away with a poison slow Of lies that would tingle in every vein, And break the heart with a nameless pain? Ah! rebel nature could not endure The vacant mind and the weary day, The effort to keep all thought away, But for the work 'mong the sick and poor: It is among them that I find my good,— If they would not pain me by gratitude. MISS BELLA JAPP TO HER YOUNG MINISTER Speak out, speak out! We are all hungering, sir, for truthful words Of faith or doubt; And we are weary of all mocking-birds Who would be dumb If they might eat their meat, and do no more; And only come, And sing again what we have heard before, And grind again the same tune at the door To get their crumb. Oh yes, yes, yes! We have much talk, we have abundant speech In Rhetoric dress— Thin thready talk that has no truth to teach; Poor echoes sent From rock-like brains that barren are of thught: No nutriment On which a soul may live is to be got From echoes which are shadows, and give not The least content. Just speak out that Which God gives you to live on day by day; And say not what The people round about would have you say— Oh I could preach, If they would let me, if I had a sphere!— If you would reach The hearts of others, listen first and hear What your own heart is saying, and speak it clear To all and each. Take not your words From pulpit, platform, or from parliament; Just take the Lord's— The words which from His lips to you are sent, Which few desire, But all believe, whether they will or no: And for no hire Proclaim them from the housetops where you go, And cry aloud, because they burn and glow In you like fire! What! man, you talk Of living by the gospel you proclaim! Well, if you walk So as to glorify the Lord's great name, You shall have meat Enough—the meat He gave to His own Son, And that was sweet. “Not muzzle the ox!” what harm that text has done, Just making lazy nowt of many a one For meat to eat! I've gone to Kirk Sixty years now since first with Jenny, nurse; And what a work I've heard them make about the Fall and Curse, Imputed sin, Imputed right, imputed everything. Meanwhile within The devil who had us in his grips would sing, “Impute away! that's just the way to bring My bairns in.” Now don't you spin Notions and crotchet-things, like that about Imputed sin, When sin's a fact whereof there is no doubt; As you can see Flaunting at every corner its disgrace Or misery, And in the “Publics” running a hot race, Ay! and at Kirk too smirking in the face O' the Pharisee. Then speak out, man; Out with it plain, the devil is in the town, And what we can, That, with God's help, we must, to put him down: Oh, fools may scoff, But he laughs last who truth has on his side: Hell's not far off Where such folk are; it's at your very side, And souls drop in, as balls are made to slide I' th' holes at golf. There are the holes, And here the devil's game, and well he plays; For thoughtless souls Come dropping in, with some bit pleasant phrase, Each hour o' the day. An easy job he's had this many a year, For it's poor play We've had against him; God's been ill served here, And it's been like to drive me mad to hear Their feckless way. But you have come Fresh and hot-hearted, as I hear, from College, Freighted like some Others, no doubt, with tons of useless knowledge. But, O my man, It's not your metaphysics that we need, Watery and wan; Just take the Book, and with your own eyes read, And drop the spectacles of an oldworld creed About “The Plan.” And preach right out, And pray; I do not mean to stamp the floor, And sweat and shout; God is not deaf that you should need to roar: But take our sin Right by the throat, and call it by its name, Nor mind the din The devil will raise because ye spoil his game, Or Pharisee because he's put to shame, Turned outside in. Pick ye no words To tickle itching ears with rhetoric; They have the birds To sing to them, if that is what they seek: It's dainty phrase And mincing speech have been our very death These many days, As in the Kirk we sought not truth and faith, But tricks of art to hear with bated breath, Like fine stage plays. Be strong and true; Hold up our sins that we may see them bare, And hold up too The Cross both to believe it, and to share Its pain and loss, Should sorrow fill our cup unto the brim; For on the Cross We see the glory as the eye grows dim, Only we're fain to hand it on to Him Who clasped it close. Believing much The Cross, that it is all our help and hope, We will not touch It with our finger, fain to let it drop; And therewith cease The grace and bliss and riches that it brings, And all increase; Meanwhile we sing about the angels' wings, And soothe the sickly conscience as it stings, And call this Peace. THE VILLAGE PHILOSOPHER He kept the village school—some score Of boys and girls, with little primers; Their fathers he had taught before, Had called their mothers “idle limmers”: For well he liked to give hard names, But still in blandest accent spoken; They never spoilt the children's games, Nor yet by them their heads were broken. He had been village “merchant” once, But had not prospered in that calling; A trade, he said, for any dunce, To be a ledger overhauling: A silly, mindless business, he Was heard in very scorn to mutter, To barter cloth and combs and tea And spades and rakes for eggs and butter! For he was a philosopher, And such with trade make no alliance; They said that even the minister Was puzzled with his views of science: He knew the hour of the Eclipse, He made the Kirk a ventilator, And could have sailed the biggest ships Across the line of the Equator. Before the school door he had reared A pillar-stone and true sun-dial; And in the window there appeared, For weather-glass, a wondrous phial, Its neck was partly ground, and then 'Twas hung, mouth-downward, filled with water; And if it dropped, there would be rain, But if it shrank, the clouds would scatter. He had a glass that showed the moon Whose mountains looked like inky blotches, He had a box that played a tune, When rightly touched at certain notches; He had a round electric wheel Could give a shock to all the village, That made their elbows ache, and feel As tired as with a hard day's tillage. He beat the smith—until he drank— At working cures on sickly cattle; For when he came to byre or fank, The sight of him was half the battle: In very fear the ewes grew well The moment that they smelt his potions, And cows to healthy sweating fell To see his poultices and lotions. So blandly as he pinched his snuff When he did horse or bullock handle! So careful as he mixed the stuff By light of flaring lamp or candle! So wisely as he would discourse Of Pleuro, Foot-and-Mouth, or Staggers! And if the stubborn brutes grew worse, He glared at them with looks like daggers. Oh little village-world, that hast Thy prophets, watched with faith and wonder, Stoutly believed it to the last In spite of failure, loss and blunder, What art thou but the world in small? And what its prophets more than thine are? Perhaps an inch or two more tall, But hardly even a shade diviner. ALTNACRAIG THE HIGHLAND HOME OF PROFESSOR BLACKIE Fair within and without, Meet home for a sage and poet, With the pine-clad red crags all about, And the islanded sea below it; Behind, is a ridgy hill, And a burn leaps down the brae, Where the sleepy clack of a little mill Low-pulses through the day. Fair without, but within Is a rarer nobler beauty— Womanly grace the heart to win, And patient doing of duty; And manly thinking and wise, And lore of the ancient times, And a free true soul that hath no disguise, Still singing its careless rhymes. Without and within, all fair— The form alike and the spirit— He blithe and gay as the bird of the air, She calm in her modest merit; A self-assertive Greek, Brisk to reason or jest, Espoused to a Roman matron meek And patient and self-suppressed. Green Kerrera lies below, You can see the green tower of Dunolly, Lismore is green where the white ships go Sailing by Appin slowly. There are clouds on the hills of Mull, And the mist over Morven streams; And the heart of the Celt, like his day, is dull, Or its lights but the fitfullest gleams. O hills of Appin and Lorn, And green foamed-girdled islands, And pools where the rushing streams are born That sing to the lonely Highlands; Dear to this friend of the Gael Are loch and stream and Ben, And the eerie legend and song and tale That haunt the brackened glen. Elf-like his locks and grey, That wave o'er a Greek-like beauty— Tokens of wisdom ripe, whose day Was spent in Love and Duty; But the spirit is gay and young As in its dewy morn, And ever the bird-like song is sung As the fresh new thought is born; Bird-like song, from the hour That fresh as the sun he rises, Song in the mist and the flying shower, Song when the light surprises, Song on the lonely road, Song in the thronging street; Ever singing his thoughts to God, For his thoughts are pure and sweet. And whether of Clachan he speaks Crumbling in dell of the Forest, Or the rich full life of the grand old Greeks, Or Him whom thou surely adorest, The torrent of speech high-wrought, Perchance with some froth on it, Is ever a power too of generous thought, With flashes of sparkling wit. Now fatefullest tales are told From Æschylus' tragic pages; Now Plato and Goethe converse hold Across the years and the ages; Or Duncan Ban and the deer Sweep down the rocky dell, And burning pleas from his lips you hear For the Celt he loves so well. O haunt of the good and wise, How oft have thy walls resounded With eloquent pleas for the Celt that lies, By a sordid life surrounded, Or with grief that his soul's true health Should yield to the bigot's spell, Or the meaner sway of vulgar wealth That lords the hill and the dell! Beautiful home of truth! Shall we taste no more thy gladness, Thy mirth with the innocent bloom of youth, Thy wise and thoughtful sadness? Shall we sit no more at thy board As in the bright old times With the lightsome jest, and the grave good word, And jets of dainty rhymes? Farewell! the sea will beat On thy brown rocks, crisply foaming, And friends will sit on the far-viewed seat, And talk in the golden gloaming; But not such talk as we Under the red pines had, And, I think, I shall never more care to see The place where I was so glad. COBAIRDY An old Scotch house, only one room wide, But four storeys high, with “a turnpike stair” That corkscrewed up a round tower on its side, With the outhouses made three parts of a square; A quaint coat-of-arms o'er the bignailed door Had roughly been carved on the red sand stone, And the gate to the square, which the same arms bore, Was arched overhead with a whale's jawbone. The laird was a squat little hardfeatured man, Something deaf in the hearing, and bowed in the legs, Careful to waste nought, and get all he can For his oats and his bere, and his butter and eggs; His mother lived still in the kitchen there, For the parlour was draughty, the dining-room grim, With no sort of comfort, the laird would declare, From portraits of old lairds that glowered down at him. For some of them had red coats, and whips in their hand, Some, gay powdered heads and laceruffles fine, And the red coats and ruffles meant acres of land, The laird could not think of, and cheerfully dine; Yet the “Madams” were worse, with their head-tires and frills And satins, every yard of which had cost him dear; For the clothing of their backs they had stript half his hills, And they were not like his mother for all their fine gear. Rarely in the parlour, then, Cobairdy would sit, And never in the dining-room, for that made him glum To think how his forebears, men of little wit, Had parted with his acres for all time to come; Racing and dressing and rattling at the dice, To rob him of half his bonny green hills, Drinking and card-playing, and dabbling in vice, Till there was little left him but wadsets and bills. Each night by the big kitchen fire he was seen, Where an oil-cruse and rushwick bleared through the reek, He and his mother, with a draught-board between, Playing a long game would last near a week: 'Twas a saving of fire, and a saving of light, And twice as much comfort, and half as much care; And as for the game, if he lost in a night A penny to his mother, it was neither here nor there. And day after day, with the sickle or the flail, Or the harrow or the plough he would toil, and not tire; And night after night, his mother would not fail To set forth the draught-board beside the peat-fire; Only on the Sundays, when they came from the Kirk, And saw to the kye, and their fodder and their drink, For the draughts they had “Boston” to read in the mirk, And maybe o'er his pages would get just a wink. Few were their words as they sat there alone, With the “lass” at her wheel, for no idleness was there; And five and forty years now had thus come and gone, And the gear was aye growing, but the laird had grizzly hair; Then his old mother sickened in the fall of the year When most she was needed, as the long nights came, And before the oak leaves were yellow all and sere He laid her in the kirkyard with the rest of his name. He laid her in the kirkyard, and turned round his head, With a lump in his throat and a tear in his eye, And thanked us for the honour we had shown to the dead, And also he was glad that the day had been dry; Could his mother but have known, the house had been right His friends to receive, as they surely ought to be, And a proud woman she would have been that night To witness the respect of such a good company. Then he took off his hat, and took from its crown A yard of red cotton, and bowed to us low, “Cried gee!” to the cart horse, and then sat him down Just where the coffin lay a little while ago; And home came the poor laird, and went to the byre, And patted brown Crummie, his old mother's pet, And stared at her hens, and her ducks in the mire, And vowed they should live, though they brought him in debt. What could he do then? He tried for a time “The Fourfold State” of the children of men; Good were the words, and the doctrine was prime, But it was a week day, and who could read then? Not one good thought got he into his mind Of all that the good man tried hard to say; And the more that he read, the more he grew blind, And oh but his old heart was “dowie and wae.” At last, looking round to “the lass” at her wheel, “Jeanie,” he said, “will ye bring your stool near? My mother's awa', but I think she would feel Better pleased if I went on as when she was here. I've tried hard to read, but, instead of the book, I see her old face, Jeanie, there where she sat, And how, when she gave me a check, she would look— And we had not half finshed the game we were at.” So the laird and his Jeanie sat down by the fire, With the cruse and the rushwick to light up their play; And she played her game well both in kitchen and byre, For Crummie grew sleek and Cobairdy grew gay. And now she's the “leddy,” as braw as the best, And sits in the parlour, and dines in the hall, And her picture is hung by the laird's, with the rest Of the red coats and farthingales high on the wall. DONALD TOSHACH HIGHLAND LAND IMPROVER Big and burly and jolly and strong, Nineteen stone if he weighs a pound, Yet as he strides, with his gun, among The corries and hills where the game is found, How light is his step o'er the heathery ground! For his wind is sound, and his heart is gay; There's a dash of Norse blood in that light-haired Celt, And his enterprise, and his dashing way He got from the Vikings of old, that dwelt In the ships or the brochs where the sea is smelt. Great is his laughter, and needs but the half Of a joke to set it in roaring trim; And as you list to that great, glad laugh, You would give something to laugh like him, For it seems to go rolling through every limb. Shrewd at an argument, always keen, Celt-like, to reason of things divine, Yet not, like the Celt, upon faith to lean, And pelt you with Scriptures line upon line; For texts to him are like sips of wine: So he goes groping half in the dark,— Half in the dark, but he swears it is day— Like one in adeep mine working stark, By a flickering lamp that shoots its ray, And shows the dark, if it shows not the way. But his strength is in action, in setting the folk Road-making, bridge-building, planting trees, Draining the marshes, and blasting the rock, Or reaping the harvest of the seas, Making the idlest busy as bees. Watch him sitting on some grey stone, And overlooking the moorland brown; What are his thoughts as he broods alone?— Of forests where now only heather is grown, And the homesteads and mills, when it shall be his own. “Yonder the mansion shall stand on its lawn, The hills shall be covered with larch and pine, Here shall the flowering shrubs glow in the dawn, And the wasted torrents shall all combine To be a power and a slave of mine. “God made no part of His earth to lie Waste as this is, with idle men Watching the wild birds as they fly, Orred deer cropping the brackened glen, Or the salmon seeking the streams again. “The corn may mildew, alas, on the field, And the hay lie wasted there where it grew; Yet something there is which the land should yield, Something there must be for man to do Other than sport the whole year through.” Then will he buy a big lump of the shire, And men from the isles will come at his call, To trench it, and fence it with stone and wire, Five hundred Islesmen strong and tall, Able workers at ditch and wall. And slicing it up into small estates, Planning houses and carriage-ways, And winding paths with their wicket gates, And planting thick on the hills and braes, He toils through the sunny summer days. Neighbours laugh at him, call him mad, Prophesy death to his million trees, Mock at his schemes, and are almost glad Of any mishap that they can seize To show they were right in their auguries. Till some day, lo! the five hundred men Shoulder their picks, and march away Back to their Western Isles again; But twenty freeholders come, and they Pitch their tents, for they mean to stay. They love not idle folk there to see, But they pay for work with their crowns and groats; And they would have people strong and free With kindlier crofts, and warmer cots, And they are many—and they have votes. But steeped in pride from the toe to the crown, Steeped in debt too up to the lip, The neighbours askance at them look and frown, And try to hold on with a firmer grip, Lest from their hands the County slip. But not for that does he toil and scheme; What cares he for their party wars, Could he but rouse them from their dream To care for the people, and heal their scars, And grow what Nature not debars? But what they want is a solitude, A land that hath no neighbour folk, Nor any work for the common good, But only a desert of bog and rock, Where the antlered stag and his hinds may flock. “For deer and gilliedom are our curse,” So he vows in his stormy way, “Making the lazy clansman worse, As he lives on the thriftless Saxon's pay With two months work, and ten months play.” Then will he turn and say, “'Tis time I made a nest for myself at last; I have been changing soil and clime Only for others, but that is past; Where shall my own lot now be cast?” Yonder a waste and lonely land Of bog and rock by a spreading lake: There shall a goodly mansion stand, And glade and garden he will make, And all the hills into leafage break. Yet when he looks on his finished home, Garth and forest and mansion too, How shall he spend the days to come, Now there is nothing for him to do? Ah, he must find out something new. Fair is the house beside the lake, And it rings with the voices of child and guest; But there his pleasure he cannot take, It is no pleasure for him to rest;— Making a new world still is best. Sell it off for a rocky isle; There will he fashion a busy life; Bleak as the land is, it shall smile For ragged children and drudging wife, For there the wealth of the sea is rife. Oats will not ripen, and barley fails, But the grass in the glens is green and sweet, And the Lochs shall gleam with the fishers' sails, And the coves shall smile with houses neat, While the flocks in the glen shall browse and bleat. O Rocky Isle in the western sea, Rouse thee on every cape and bay; Now listless slumber is not for thee, But curing and coopering all the day, And launching of boats on the ocean spray. Oh for a hundred such as he! They tell me he will be ruined soon: Pity! and yet his work will be Stirring and brisk as a merry tune, E'en should he wane like a waning moon. Industry has its martyrs too, And one might die in a worser cause; Yet do I hope he will live to view A people living by wholesome laws, And thriving homes where the seagull was. For his brain is shrewd, and his schemes have thriven, As schemes never throve on these hills before; And why should he miss of the blessing of Heaven, Now that his wits and his skill are more? Oh, your prophets of evil are fain to prate If you scratch but the moss from their altar stones; But what do they know of the Gods and Fate, More than old wives from their aching bones? IONA Lone green Isle of the West, Where the monks, their coracle steering, Could see no more, o'er the wave's white crest, Their own loved home in Erin; Shrouded often in mist, And buried in cloud and rain; Yet once by the light of a glory kissed, Which nothing can dim again! O'er tangled and shell-paved rocks The white sea-gulls are flying; And in the sunny coves brown flocks Of wistful seals are lying; The waves are breaking low, Hardly their foam you trace; All hushed and still, as if they know This is a sacred place. The diving guillemot Is preening his dappled feather; The great merganser shows his throat, Red in this summer weather; And bathed in a tremulous light Are minster, cross, and grave, That call up the past with a spell of might, To tell of the meek and brave. No fitter day than this To look on thy mystic beauty, And brood on memories of the bliss Of faith and love and duty, Of the hours of quiet prayer, Of the days of patient toil, Of the love that always and everywhere, Burned like a holy oil. O lone green Isle of the West, So oft by the mist enshrouded, I have seen thee to-day in thy quiet best, Not noisily mobbed, and crowded; Seen thee in flooding light, Seen thee in perfect calm; Yet am I sad as at the sight Of mummy that men embalm. Isle of the past and gone, The life from thee has departed; Thy best is now but a carven stone,— And a memory lonely-hearted! Yet thou wert a power erewhile, O'er the great world's mind and heart; But where now the priests of the Holy Isle And the skill of its graceful Art? Cunning the hand that wrought Your traceried tombs and crosses, And silvern brooches, that yet are brought From depths of the black peat mosses; And theirs was a holy work Who carried the gospel pure And letters and work and the homely kirk, Our heathen ills to cure. Was it the Norseman's sword, And the ships of Thor and Odin That drove the saints, with the sacred Word, From the peaceful ways they trod in? Was it the Saxon's sway, Brutal and selfish and strong, That swept the beautiful Art away, And stifled the Celtic song? Only this do we know, The Celt brought light to the Teuton, And ever the knowledge of God did grow In the land he set his foot on; But as they throve he pined, But as they smiled he sighed, But as they grew he surely dwined, And in their life he died. O passion of holy love! O sacrificial people, Dying to lift men's thoughts above By altar and cross and steeple! Through stormy seas ye passed, And moor and marsh and fen, To be left behind in the march at last As weak exhausted men! They say ye shall rise again On the level Western prairie, With a larger life and a keener brain, Like eagle out of his eyrie; But not the mind and the heart That grew by the Lochs and Bens, Nor the plaintive song, and the mystic Art Nursed in the rushy glens. THE CRY OF THE MAIDEN SHAREHOLDERS These Verses appeared in The Scotsman newspaper at the time of the failure of the City of Glasgow Bank. And now I reprint them, chiefly because I wish to make grateful acknowledgments to the unknown friends whose generosity enabled me greatly to help those poor ladies till their affairs were finally settled. Pity us, God! there are five of us here, With threescore years on the youngest head, Five of us waiting in sorrow and fear— Well for our widowed one she is dead! Day and night sitting, we've not laid a head Down on a pillow this week and more; Trembling has seized on us, shrinking and dread, To hear the bell ring, or be seen at the door. Pity us, pity, O God! Pity us, God! when our father died, His mind was at ease, for he left us “shares,” And a roof o'er our head too; and side by side, Happy and loving, we faced life's cares. Then we were young, but now feeble and old, And we never wronged any as far as we knew, And we tried to do right with our silver and gold, And the poor had their portion, the Church had its due. Pity us, pity, O God! Pity us, God! we would work if we could, But suppler fingers must stitch and hem; And who would give us our morsel of food, Though we span and knitted all day for them? We never knew work, but to keep ourselves neat, And we never knew want, but our wants are small, And there's bread in the house yet if we could eat, But the sickness of sorrow is mixed with it all. Pity us, pity, O God! Pity us, God! must our little things go? All—even our mother's things, cherished with care? Must we leave the old house—the one house that we know? But not for the poorhouse—Oh, surely not there? Could they not wait a while?—we will not keep them long; We would live on so little too, cheerful and brave; But to leave the old house where old memories throng For the poorhouse, oh! rather the peace of the grave, Pity us, pity, O God! Pity us, God! as for those who have wrought This terrible ruin so wide and deep, Oh, how could they do it, and know it not? How could they know it, and think or sleep? But we would not, one of us, change, this day, Our lot for theirs, for our hands are clean; And the bankrupt soul has a darker way Than the way of the honest poor ever has been. Pity us, pity, O God! IN MEMORIAM— DR. JOHN BROWN O sweet and pure and tender heart, With the child's gift to pray and play, Thou, artless in thy perfect art, Could'st blissful tears to us impart, And smile the blissful tears away. Most human thou of humankind, What wealth of love accrued to thee! To thee dumb creatures looked to find The meanings which their wistful mind Was groping for, and could not see. We were the better for the mirth, We were the better for the tears, We were the better seeing worth, In the dumb creatures of the earth, Their loves, their efforts, and their fears. Not all could comprehend thy mirth, Thy dainty humour playing round All things that be; yet heaven and earth Thine awe and wonder still called forth, For all to thee was holy ground. We are so little; God requires, The greatness of His thoughts to prove, Some altars burning with strange fires, Some songs not meant for sacred choirs, Some souls that shun the common groove. And thou—thy smile was like a prayer, Thy humour like a psalm of praise; They mingled with the holiest there Where hearts breathe out their grief and care To Him that Ancient is of Days. Yet oftentimes that smile was seen Kindling the near edge of a cloud That gathered o'er thy soul serene, And haunted thee with anguish keen, And bitter wailing low or loud. That cloud is past of fear and doubt; But ah! this other cloud that lies With hush of silence all about, And opens to let no man out, And hides thee from our wistful eyes! We gaze at it with brimming tears; Vain all our yearning looks and fond; No smile upon its edge appears; And yet the faith is wise that hears A voice say, All is light beyond.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">KILDROSTAN ACT I.— SCENE I Chorus. Poor fishers on the wild west shore Where slow mists trail along the hills, And from the mist comes evermore The sound of rushing brooks and rills, Are plodding, grave, with lingering feet, About the high hot noon of day, Along the circle of the street That straggles round the circling bay. 'Neath crags and hills the long loch winds Through rocky isles where sea-birds flock; Along the slopes the grey birch finds Frail footing on the slaty rock; On every ledge there grows a pine With roots that cling as the branchestoss, And the oaks along the low sea-line Are greenly feathered with fern and moss. Behind the cliffs are mountains steep By foaming torrents scored and scarred, And up their gullies the adders creep, But the peaks are ragged and jagged and barred: Cloud-capped often their stormy tops, While ridge and corrie and crag are bare, Or a girdle of mist will ring the slopes, While the heights rise clear in the upper air. A desolate land of fern and moss, Of brackened braes and craggy hills, And shores where fickle waters toss, And birch-and-hazel-fringèd rills, And foaming cataracts like snow That in the gorges leap and run, And rocks, ice-polished long ago, That gleam like waters in the sun, And gorgeous sunsets that enfold The mountains with a purple robe, And dash the crimson and the gold In billowy spray about the globe: A land of wayside cairns—the place Of resting for the biers of death— And tokens of a fading race, And relics of forgotten faith— Legend and rhyme and mystic rite, The worship of a God unknown, Stealthily done at dead of night By sacred well or standing stone. Oh marvel not they love the land Who watch its changeful hills and skies, For in its desolation grand A charm of 'wildering beauty lies. A meagre life they have, and still— Not stiller almost is the grave— Those villagers beneath the hill That looks down on the long sea-wave; Rude are the huts of stone and turf That straggle round the circling street, The thatched roofs soaked with rain or surf, And blackened with the smoking peat. No ploughshare tears the scanty soil, Enough for them are spade and hoe; 'Tis on the waters that they toil, And in the seas their harvests grow. The moors are for the hare and grouse, The corries for the antlered stag, But shaggy big-horned cattle browse On the fringe of bracken and rush and flag. And now and then comes like a dream A white-sailed yacht into the bay, And now and then a snort of steam Sounds from the headland far away; But never shows the world's proud strife, Its strain of power, and rush of thought: Time counts for nothing in their life, But comes and goes, and changes nought. Yet men have grown there, true and brave, Bronzed with weather, and horny of hand, Who wrestled with the problems grave That at the porch of Wisdom stand; And you shall find in low, thatched cot, Round-angled, and with smoke begrimed, Love that can sweeten every lot, And Faith that hath all fates sublimed. But why are the long-oared boats afloat? Why tolls the bell from the steepled kirk? It is not the hour to launch the boat, And it is not the Sabbath of rest from work; And why are the children sad and grave, With no ripple of mirth by the rippling wave? And whither away do the strong men walk, While the women gather in groups and talk? Scene—Village Street of Kinloch-Thorar. Group of Women at the Post Office Door. First Fisherwoman. —Ochone! but this iss a sad day on Loch Thorar, Mrs. Slit. Mrs. Slit. —You may say that, 'Lizbeth, and in Glen Shelloch too, and Glen Turret, which iss more. First Fisherwoman. —He wass a good man, and a faithful minister. He wass not a dumb dog that will be gnawing the bones, and will not bark when he should. Mrs. Slit. —Och yes! he wass all that, though he might not preach like Black Rory of Skye, or big John of Strathnaver. But he would not be passing my shop door without getting pickles of snuff for the old men, and sweeties too for the bairns. Yes, yes! it will not be the same shop now that he does not come here any more. Second Fisherwoman. —But what iss this, Mrs. Slit; Miss Ina will not be for burying him in the kirkyard, but in Isle-Monach, where my Donald would be seeing ghosts at Yule and Pasch. Mrs. Slit. —It iss your Donald that would be having the whisky, then. For they are quiet men, the monks, when they are living, and they will not be frisky now that they are in their graves. Second Fisherwoman. —But they are in Purgatory, whatever; and our minister had no faith in Purgatory, or organs or saints or good works. Why would she be for burying him among them? Iss it Papist she will be turning? First Fisherwoman. —Or Pagan, Mrs. Slit? For our May wass saying she would read more about heathen gods and goddesses than about Abraham or Moses; and May wass maid in the manse till Candlemas last. Mrs. Slit. —May will not know what young ladies have to know. And which iss more, she might do better than to be talking about her betters. As for Purgatory, it iss not any more, since the laird's great grandfather forbade it, or it will only be for the poor cottars at Glen Chroan. And whether or no, our minister's daughter will have nothing to do with it, you may be sure. But it iss true Miss Ina never wass just like other maids. But her heart iss good, whatever, yes! and which iss more, it iss soft and warm as a lintie's nest, and sweeter as the bog-myrtle. Third Fisherwoman. —Och yes! it will be warm and sweet, but not good, Mrs. Slit. None of our hearts iss good, as he would often say, who will never say it any more. But many a time, when the lads wass out fishing, it iss Miss Ina that would hail them from her bit boatie, and she would have the kind word for each of them; yes! and she would call at our doors too on her way home, and tell us about Dugald or Donald or Alisthair and the herrings. Och yes! she hass the kind heart, whatever, and it will be a sorry one this day. First Fisherwoman. —Yes! she hass the kind heart, Miss Ina; and if she would have the making of the law, it would be the better for us, though it iss true she iss for making the men carry the peats, and wade out to the boats too, which it would be a shame for women to see. Second Fisherwoman. —But whose boat will she be having, now? For it iss a rhyme I heard long ago—Coffined corpse in fisher's boat; Make ready a shroud when it's next afloat. Mrs. Slit. —The de'il an ye were in your shroud, woman, to speak of such a thing! Do you know that it iss Sir Diarmid himself that will bring his gig, and his gillies, and his piper too, all in the brave tartan, with plaid and sporran, as if the minister would be a chief, for he was not more than third cousin to the laird's grandfather. And it iss the chief that you would be singing your carline rhymes about, and making a shroud for him too! Second Fisherwoman. —But he iss not a fisher. Mrs. Slit. —He will fish more than your Donald, whatever: for when Donald iss in the humour, the loch iss never in trim; and when the loch iss in the humour, he hass no inclination. But it iss not for you, woman, to be speaking of the laird and a shroud in one breath, and him a brave young gentleman, and which iss more, just growing the beautiful beard too. Yes! First Fisherwoman. —But why will she be for burying him among the monks, when there iss a Christian kirkyard at her door, Mrs. Slit? Mrs. Slit. —Who hass a better right to lie there? For he comes of the old stock that built the Abbey Kirk; and all their graves are there, and there iss nobody else but chiefs and monks and ministers and superior persons, which iss proper. There has not been a burial there since old Sir Kenneth's, the day of the great storm, when half our boats wass wrecked, and the poor lads were bobbing about the loch, like pellocks in a gale of wind. Third Fisherwoman. —O chone! yes; and it is myself will mind it, if I am spared to my dying day. My Alisthair, that wass to be married just the week after, drifted ashore among the tangles before his Mysie's door, and she will never be herself again since that fery hour. And it wass Miss Ina that would have the bodies carried to the kirk, and the funeral there; for they will preach to us, said she, better than the minister, or an angel from heaven. First Fisherwoman. —Sure, and she wass right there, for there would not be a profane swearer or a Sabbath-breaker in the parish for six months after, though the whisky wass wanted for the sore heart sometimes, maybe. Mrs. Slit. —Yes! it wass a great sermon, the lads lying in a row, and just the day before they had talked to us, and which iss more, they had laughed with us; and now they looked at us, and would not know us any more. Och yes! it wass a great sermon, and it wass God himself that preached it. But there, now; they are leaving the manse. It iss our own lads that will be carrying the coffin, with its white wreaths and ferns. Och! and Sir Diarmid and Miss Ina make the handsome pair, like the brown pine and the bonnie birch tree. She iss liker him than that Doris, with her mouth that is always smiling, and her eyes that never do. First Fisherwoman. —But they will be saying he must marry Doris, whatever. Mrs. Slit. —Maybe yes, maybe no. It iss not every fish you hook that comes to the creel; and the stag iss not on the spit because Donald has loaded his gun. And that will be her uncle, the Doctor, that wass the ne'er-do-well, and nearly broke his brother's heart, and which is more, emptied his purse too. But he iss come home now, they say, as rich as the English lord at Loch Eylert. Sure they will rest the coffin somewhere for his cairn, and for the drop whisky there. And now Eachan Macrimmon is playing a coronach as it were for a chief: “Peace to his soul, and a stone to his cairn.” Chorus. Slowly the muffled oars dip in the tide, Slowly the silent boats shadow-like glide Past the grey, steepled kirk, past the low manse, Now in the ripples that glimmer and glance Where the sun flashes, and now in the shade The birch-feathered rocks and the great hills have made; Slowly and silently onward they pass Over the calm spaces shining like glass, While the wild wailing strains of the coronach swell, And fall with the breeze and the slow-tolling bell. Long, low and dark is the first of the train, With six bending oars keeping time to the strain; In it a coffin, and by it a maiden Who to the moaning sea moans sorrow-laden, As they drop down to the dim abbey pile Lying half-hid in a cleft of the isle, Ruined and roofless, 'mid tangle of trees That dip their low boughs in the wave, but the breeze Rustles their higher leaves over a tower Green with massed ivy, and crown'd with wall-flower. There, with his forefathers, peaceful to sleep By the white surf of the unresting deep, Where once the Culdee monk toiled, prayed, and died, Where once the galleys oared out in their pride, Where still the clansmen their high chiefs bewail, Silent they laid the good priest of the Gael. No cross was reared above his head, No requiem was sung or said, No hope was spoken of the just In glory rising from the dust: In silent awe they did their part, Yet the good hope was in every heart. SCENE II. Chorus. A little wiry man, with grizzled hair, And withered face that wrinkled was and bare, And clear, keen eyes that had no look of care, Sat with a maid All robed in black, herself a lily white, Beautiful as the moon in starless night Whose silent depths alternate wondrous light, And mystic shade. Blunt in his speech, a careless nature his, A wanderer driven by restless impulses, And years had not yet toned his heedlessness, Nor loss nor gain: And nothing awed him that the world reveres, Yet was he awed before a maiden's tears, And stumbled in his talk, with doubts and fears Of giving pain. He would be gentle, if he but knew how, And helpful, if his gold could help her now, But wist not of the deeper life, I trow, Patient and meek; And woman's ways had long been strange to him, And eyes, unused to weeping, now grew dim Seeing her eyes in shining waters swim, And tear-stained cheek. Scene—The Manse Parlour. Ina and Dr. Lorne searching books and papers. Dr. Lorne. This clean bewilders me: it is like being Lost in a mist, and wandering round and round, To end where you began, only more puzzled, Weary and hopeless. What can he have done With it, I wonder. Ina. Uncle, what is wrong? Dr. Lorne. Oh, nothing's wrong of course. It's only I Am growing old and stupid, I suppose. I'm puzzled, that is all. Ina. But what about? And can I help you? Yet if it is dark To you, I fear that my poor head to-day Can bring but little light. Dr. Lorne. Oh, never mind; I should not speak of it: it does not matter— Not in the least. Ina. What matters anything, In this blank desolation? Dr. Lorne. Don't now, Ina; I shan't know what to do if you break down; And people die, but still the world goes on, And those who live must eat, and pay their bills, And think of things. Ina. Ay! that's the pity of it— To come straight from the shadows and the lights, The awe and mystery and sacred sorrow About the grave, to life's poor commonplace— Not yet, at least, I cannot do it yet. Dr. Lorne. Well, no; but then I've seen so many drop— Comrades and friends—and had to carry on The battle, or be beaten: one has hardly Time here for feelings. Ina. May one come to that? Were it not better not to be than live To find no time for what is best in us, What purifies and elevates and makes A larger world than our small round of tasks? Ah me! a dreary outlook. Dr. Lorne. Not at all: But for this business, now, no doubt it will Be cleared up some day. Ina. What is there to clear? Dr. Lorne. Oh, nothing. You must not be troubled yet With business. But your father now, he never Went in for iron “rings” or “corners,” did he, Ina? And no sharp fellows ever talked him over, And blew him up with hopes of boundless wealth, Which by and by collapsed, and left him broken? Ina. I do not understand. Dr. Lorne. Of course, you don't: No more did he. You never heard him speak Of mines, I daresay—copper mines in Spain, Or silver in Peru, and how they paid Fine dividends? No, no; you never did. Yet parsons burn their fingers sometimes there. Ina. I have known papers come to him, which he Flung in the fire, saying that it was well He had no gold to gamble with. Dr. Lorne. Quite right; One needs to know the game to play with these Sharp fellows. Well; no doubt, he never printed A learned Book now—one that would not sell, Was never meant to sell, but just to be A splendid monument of erudition, With costly illustrations, setting forth Highland antiquities, and early arts Now lost in their descendants, which he sent To all the letters of the alphabet, Who voted him their thanks? He might have done it; But no, he didn't? I'm at my wit's end now. And after all, he could not drop that way More than a thousand or so. Ina. What do you mean? Dr. Lorne. Oh, nothing; never mind; I'm only stupid, Let's talk of something else. We're rich enough. There; dry your eyes. I don't suppose you could Smile on me now to say I have not vexed you. Ina. Indeed you have not, uncle; but I wish That I could clear up your perplexity, Whate'er it be. Dr. Lorne. No matter. By the way, Was not the Chief most kind to do him honour, Bearing him to his grave with kilted men And pipers, though I hate both kilts and pipes. Ina. Indeed, he is a noble gentleman, And held my father high in his esteem. He was his pupil once— Dr. Lorne. Oh, and you learnt Lessons together?—Latin and Greek and Hebrew? 'Twas all the old chap knew. Ina. There you are wrong, sir; Oh, he knew many things, and taught me much I now remember only to regret I did not learn it better. Dr. Lorne. That's the way With me too. What a deal I have forgotten Since he and I were boys, and went to school! Well; I must see the Chief, of course, and thank him: It is worth thanks, although that strutting piper Looked like a turkey-cock, and yelled as mad As e'er a wild cat. After that we'll go Off to Glen Chroan, and my house shall have At last its mistress. Never wind blew yet But it brought luck to some one, though 'tis sad My house is filled by emptying of his. Ina. You are most kind, good uncle. But indeed I have not thought yet what I ought to do. It seems as if I could not think, for when I try to knit my mind to any end, My head goes swimming round, and all is blank. Dr. Lorne. Yes, yes! I understand. But there's no hurry, Nor need of thinking either. You may leave All that to me. You shall have pretty rooms, And nestle like a dainty lady-bird In a blush rose. Ina. That never was my dream Of life; I'd prove a restless lady-bird. I have my work to do. Death sets one thinking What to make of one's life—how best to use it. Dr. Lorne. Work! Oh, your mothers' meetings, Sunday schools, Sick-visitings, and mending poor folk's ways— I wish they'd take a turn at mending ours; We need it. Well; our clachan is as like A Sontal village in the jungle lands As one muck-heap is like another; filled With lazy hulking men, hard-featured women Who slave for them, and ragged dirty children Brimful of mischief and original sin. Work enough there to keep your hands full, Ina, And see no end to it. Ina. That's very bad, Have they no minister? Dr. Lorne. You women, now, Think that a minister is everything, That if you plant a parson on a moor, He'll make an Eden of it, just by dropping His texts and preachments to the right and left— Well, yes, there is a minister, but he Is twenty miles away, and might as well Be twenty thousand. They are mostly there Of the old Roman way. Ina. But there will be a priest then? Dr. Lorne. Ay, he comes now and then, and gives their souls A hasty wipe that leaves them as they were Ere a week's over. Ina. And can you do nothing? Dr. Lorne. Me, Ina! It is hardly in my line To cast out devils. They'd turn and preach at me. I give the priest his dinner, and the children Pennies to wash their faces. Ina. Ah, poor folk, With none to care for them. Dr. Lorne. But now you're coming Home with me, and they'll maybe do for you What is like sowing corn upon the rocks Among the whelks and limpets, when I try it. Ina, I can't say pretty things to you: I've not a bit of sentiment in me, And never had: I take my stand on facts, And do not blow my feelings into bubbles To see them break, and break my heart for them. But see, my house is nothing but a house, Till you shall make a home of it—a nook Where the old dog may curl up in the sun, And sleep away his age. Ina. But I have neither The wealth nor will to lead an idle life. Dr. Lorne. Well, there is ample work in our wild Clachan— Souls to be saved, and bodies to be healed, And dirt enough to cleanse. And as for wealth, We'll ruffle it with the best, if that will please you. Ina. That is not what I mean. We Highland maidens Like independence, uncle. Dr. Lorne. Oh, you'd rather A trifle of your own than hang on me? And so you should have had, and that is just What puzzles me. Your father made a will, Only there was not anything to will Except a squash of sermons. Ina. How could he Have aught to leave, with only this poor parish? You know his hand was open. Dr. Lorne. If his head Had been but half as open to ideas! But that was always shut, and his hand never. Ina. He was a good man, uncle. Dr. Lorne. Far too good. There should have been a world made just for him, Where no rogues grew, for never idle tramp Whined at his door, I wager, but he fingered Some of his coppers. He was never wise. Ina. Yet goodness has a wisdom of its own, And oft sees deeper than a shrewder wit. And since I saw him lying cold and dead, The idea of his life, which my poor breath Had sometimes clouded, seems to come out clear, And pure, and shining with a saintly beauty. Dr. Lorne. Yes, yes, a saint; but saints, you know, are not For earth, but heaven. I pray you, do not set The pretty fountains of these eyes a-playing, Or you shall quite unman me. I'm at sea About that will of his—that you should be Left penniless, and even more, that I Should somehow have been cheated. Did you never Hear of my being dead in India? Ina. Yes, years ago, and oh, how bitterly He mourned for you. Dr. Lorne. And yet I dare be sworn He never said a prayer for my poor soul, Although he feared 'twas in an evil case. He might have risked the heresy upon The chance of giving me a lift somehow. No matter. Was there nothing came to him From India then? Ina. No, nothing; but some debts Of yours—they were not much—he had to pay, Which pinched us for a while. Dr. Lorne. The devil it did! Some debts of mine, and no memorial else Of his dead brother! Ina. But you were not dead. Dr. Lorne. True; but you see I was the prodigal O' the family, and had eaten my swine's husks; And though I did not pine for fatted calves, I thought of him, old fellow,—the elder brother, Who was not a curmudgeon. At that time It suited my convenience to be dead, Or to be thought so for a while at least, I'll tell you more some day. Old uncles, Ina, Are mostly useful when they're dead; and I, Living, had been a sorrow to my folk, A vagabond that had no touch of grace, And now, it seems, my dying did no better. Well; I must see to this; there's plainly some Rogue-work to ferret out, and I will do it. No money! and even debts of mine to pay! Ina. Nay, do not think of them; they were but trifles, And cheerfully he paid them for the honour Of your good name, and would have done far more To know that you were living. Dr. Lorne. But it looks As if I had shammed death to get my bills Settled for me; and that is bad. Moreover, 'Tis plain I have been tricked and overreached, And that I can't abide, and never could. They'll need their wits who play that game with me.— I daresay now you did without a frock, Until those debts were paid, and turned and trimmed Old hats with faded ribbons. My poor Ina, You shall be dressed the handsomer for that, There's plenty for us both, lass, at Glen Chroan— Big empty rooms that will have ghosts betimes If you come not to lay them, and a waste Of meat and drink for lack of house-keeping. 'Tis somewhat lonely too; old faces flit About i' the gloaming, that I'd rather not Be seeing there; and if you do not come, I'll sell it, and be off again. I'd rather Squat by a jungle fire, and hear the tigers Growl in the nullah than sit there alone, With gnawing mice and memories. Ina. No, Uncle, You must not go off wandering again, Although a life of indolence and ease Fits not my humour. Dr. Lorne. Busy idleness Is just a woman's work. Ina. Nay, I hope not. [Exeunt. Chorus. Did she speak wholly Truth? Was it solely Work that she wanted? Ah! life was tame there, Change never came there, And who shall blame her If she was haunted With the young craving For doing and braving In the world's battle, And weary of mountains, Lakes, woods, and fountains, And slow sleepy cattle? But why should she linger There, if this hunger Gnawed so within her? Was there another, More than a brother, Hoping to win her? Ah, who shall blame her? Life was so tame there Until he came there. SCENE III. Chorus. Ay me! but Death is cruel to the living, Left to dim outlooks, and to vain remorse; Cruel and cold is Death, and unforgiving The silent corse In the old home, now still and sorrow-stricken, She sits alone, and passions her sharp pain, Fain to put from her aught that yet might quicken Her hope again. Sweet scents are wafted from the clover blossom, Sweet songs are ringing from the earth and sky, Sweet lights are lingering on the Loch's calm bosom, Far off and nigh; The swifts and swallows, from the roofs and gables, Twitter their gossip in the evening light; And the brooks, rippling o'er their glossy pebbles, Croon out of sight; Flaming through curtain-clouds, the sun is shining, In gold and crimson wrapping sea and shore; While she a subtle sorrow sits refining In her heart's core. O empty home! O dim and dismal chamber! O vacant chair, and book he left half-read! O all the tender past, she can remember, Seared now and dead. And from that dead past points a warning finger Bidding her 'ware of that which she loves most, And on his silent lips the words yet linger— Love and be lost! Scene—The Manse Library. Ina (alone). Ina. What could it be? what could he mean? Ah me! That half-told tale, just broken off where all The mystery was deepest, and the secret Now left to mere conjecture! All that night My love did comfort me; that was not wrong; God dropt it in my cup to sweeten it, And I was grateful for it, and I thought That it would comfort him too: so I told him. But he said, “No; you must not love him, child; Evil will come of it; I should have told you”— But when he would have told me, I could hear Only a whispered “Doris,” and some sounds But half-articulate; and then the awe Of the dread change, the veil impalpable, Inscrutable, came over him, and he Carried the secret with him to the grave, And I may ask, but can no answer have.— They talk of spiritual forms that float, unseen, Around our lives, and hands that feel about us, And write on tables messages that mean Nothing or anything—just as we wish. But these are bubbles which the stream of thought, Fretting against its limits and obstructions, Throws up in its dark eddies. There's nought in them. What though my father haunted this old room Where he kept company with other spirits, Wise in their day, embodied in these books So fondly read? Yet if he spoke to me I should not know if it were he that spoke, Or my own fancy: and what were I the better Of such a presence, if it only hovered Silently in the unresponsive air, And knowing all, could give no help at all, Or speaking out, could work no faith at all? Better for him “the better mansions” he So loved to speak of, and not worse for me. The misery is the silence; and the silence Is never broken. Death can hold its peace, Let life go wailing onward as it may. Ah me! the mystery of it! all is dark; Our little thoughts fly forth like gleaming sparks, Hammered from our hot hearts, and straightway die In the blank dark. What meant that half-told tale, And whispered “Doris”? Enter Morag. Morag. Ina, shall I bring The lamp now? In the gathering dusk of gloaming Our thoughts grow eerie, for their shadows look Even bigger than themselves. Ina. Nay, this is best; Fittest the sombre light for sombre thought— The glimmer of a day that is no more To brood upon the loved that are no more. No lamp yet, Morag. Morag. Ina, you are wrong To nurse this sad and melancholy mood, To dream all day in settled loneliness, To pass, untasted, dishes from the table, To see no callers coming in all kindness, To sit with folded hands and do no work, To look with blank fixed gaze at these old books, Yet reading ne'er a word, nor reading right God's providence, but hardly judging Him Because He does the best for us He can; And that's not much. The very stags that sicken Casting their horns, yet make their profit of them, Eating them up to make their bones the starker, As we should with our troubles. Ina. Leave me then To feed upon my sorrows, and in truth They are hard eating. Morag. And you'll find it easier To pity yourself than to find out God's meaning, Who throws His letters down, that we may put This one to that, and turn them into words. Ina. Indeed, I am not pitying myself; But the brisk current of my life is fallen A-slushing among reeds and rushes. Morag. What, then, Has come of all your schemes for righting wrong Among the crofters, and the fisher folk? Ina. Dreams, idle dreams! vain dreams of fond conceit, As fruitless as the dewdrops that are strung On gossamer threads o' chill October mornings. I am an idle and a useless maid That heard the far-off rumour of the world Beyond these hills, and hoped to plant its thoughts Among the heather, where they will not grow. Morag. There's to be no more school, then, for the women, To train them for their housework, and to keep them From bearing burdens women should not bear, And dragging harrows too, like horses? Ina. Truly They would not heed me, neither men nor women: It was the way their fathers did; why should they Change the old customs? Morag. And the new stone-pier That was to make safe harbourage for the boats?— Ina. Waits till the lads are drowned, for some would rather The people went away. They told me girls Should mind their seams, and practise at their scales, Not meddle with men's matters. Morag. But the Chief? Will he do nothing? Ina. That I do not know: They say he is not rich, save in a kind And generous heart. And oh, the heart can do So little, except—wish. Morag. You give up hope then? Ina. Morag, you've seen the Loch, on some still evening, Mirror each stone, and twig, and tuft of fern, And orange lichen on the rock, so clear That which was substance, which was only shadow You scarce could tell, till suddenly a breeze Would blur it all, and there was nothing left But dim confusion. So it is with me now. Once every thing looked plain to me, and truly I did not well distinguish what was fact And what was only fancy, and now all Is like those shadows gone. My heart misgives me Since he has left me. Morag. But why should it fail you? Ina. I did neglect plain duties here at home, And therefore met but failure out of doors, And now I have no duties, and no home. Morag. Ina, your heart is low, as one will be Who sits down in a mist instead of stirring To keep the blood warm. Were you up and doing You would be brisk and hopeful. Are you meaning To live now with your uncle? Ina. Wherefore not? Morag. They say there is no Sabbath in his house. Ina. Well; we could bring it with us. Morag. But they tell me It's like a devil's Sabbath, or a Fair With guzzling, clinking glasses, barking dogs, And cursing drovers. Ina. Nay, he is not strict, As we are here; but that can hardly be. Morag. And no one thinks of God but the black man Who keeps an idol cross-legged, like a tailor, Sitting upon a cow. Ina. Mere gossip, Morag; But truly I am not enamoured of My uncle's house, and sometimes I have thought 'Twere best if you and I could run away, And find some simple home, and have a roof For Kenneth till his student days are past. Perhaps a woman has no fitter task Than just to help a man to do his work. Morag. O Ina, I have dreaded you would go To that old heathen, and I could not do it, And yet I could not leave you. But to live With you and the boy Kenneth! I will haste, And write my cousin to look out for us A house beside the college. Ina. Nay, there is No hurry, Morag; nothing yet is clear. Morag. Pity that lochs and hills and maids should be So fickle! It would be a happier world If they could know their own minds half an hour. But that they never do. Ina. Enough of me: There is no armour but it has its joints, And where the joints are there the arrow sticks, And you who know me best know where to seek My weakest points: and maybe I am fickle. You cannot think more poorly of me than I think myself. Morag. I don't think poorly of you, Although I see your faults. Why will you shut The door to every caller, and sit here As lonely as a seal in some sea-cave, Or heron dreaming by a moorland burn? Ina. You would not have me lay aside my grief, Which has its healing virtue, for the set Phrases of cold condolence? Who has called? Morag. Well; first there was Miss Doris. Ina. Do not speak Of Doris. When the heart is at its best, And all its finer feelings tremulous With some emotion it is bliss to feel, There are some people — mostly women too— Who touch the spring of what is worst in you, As when you dream a happy dream, and lo! A hideous face leers on you. Morag. Well; I say not That you lost much by sending her away; She's like a wasp whose drone has little sense, But its striped tail can sting. But then My Lady Was with her. Ina. Ay! they always are together; The more's the pity. Can she have some hold On Lady Margaret? I've marked of late A change in her—a kind of frightened look And pleading way, and hesitating speech, As if she would, but dared not. Could I think Of aught but my own troubles, she would be A care to me. Morag. But, Ina, you should think Of other things; for thinking of yourself Is hardly thought at all: and when your head Gives over puzzling, you will surely be Just like the larch that, when it dies a-top, Begins to die all through, and we may dig A new grave in Isle-Monach. After them, We had a call too from the English ladies At Corrie-Eylert. Ina. Oh, they came to note My way, my looks, and specially my dress, And to retail the gossip, as they went Their round among the neighbours. Morag. Let me tell you Folk's hearts are often better than their habits: They're sorry for you, but that's not enough, Because you are so sorry for yourself. Ina. That's a hard saying, Morag. Can you think My grief is for myself, and not for him Whom I have lost? Morag. Why should you grieve for him, Because he is in heaven, and has no care Of writing sermons now, and is not so Dead-weary of himself, as when he sat There at his table, scratching with a quill To make words do what only deeds can do. Ina. Hush, Morag; 'tis not meet that you should speak, Or I should hear such words. He was my father, You do not understand—you never did; And oh, I am so lonely. Morag. You were nearly As lonely while he lived as you are now. If he had ever, like a father, watched What books you read, what thoughts they bred in you, What hours you kept, what friends you had, if any, What schemes were shaping in your busy head, Or even how you dressed! But you might go With any one, and anywhere, in rags, And he would never notice. And yourself Have told me that he scarcely heeded aught But Firstly, except Secondly and Lastly; Write, writing, every day and all day long. Ina. I will not hear you, Morag, this is cruel, At such a time. If I was a malapert, 'Twere fitter to rebuke than second me. Moreover, when I said that, 'twas not he I blamed, for he was good—oh, so much better Than I—and still with conscience made his life A sacrifice to duty, offering up The sweetness and the gladness of it all To what his office claimed of him. It was The exigency of mistaken work, The rigour of a wrong idea planted In a true heart that never spared itself, Made me so speak. But yet I spake amiss, And rightly now am humbled. Pardon me, Dear father, that I judged you wantonly In petulance of youth. I had no mother. Morag. Scold me well, Ina; it will do you good. I thought to rouse, and I have only crushed you. Nay, spare me not, an old conceited fool! Only, you are my bairn. Ina. There; go away. I daresay you meant well, but there are sores May not be touched but with a skilful hand, Not with rough loving even. You think I pity Myself! I hate myself, when I remember The failure of my duty and my love To him: and yet the burden of my sorrow Is bound on me by what is best in me, And when I part from it my good departs, Therefore I clasp it to my heart of hearts. Chorus. Ah me! but it is hard to hear The echo of your own wrong thought Which you were fain had been forgot, Come jarring back upon your ear, Come jarring back upon your heart, And smite it with a keen remorse, When you would shape a better course, And hope to play a nobler part. There, day by day, his hand would write New sermons, but the thought was old— Fresh-minting the same brass or gold, And careful but to coin it right; For with unshaken confidence He stood upon the old safe ground, And turned the problem round and round, And still brought out the same old sense, And hoped the world to overcome By rounding periods; and she said That it would be by sleep instead— Oh, better that she had been dumb! For now it all came back again, The scratching of the patient quill, The paper that he needs must fill, All changed into a choking pain. SCENE IV. Chorus. All from the many-moulded door On to the three-cusped window high, Every stone on the pavement floor Marks where the chiefs and their kinsmen lie— Dark slabs carved with the great Cross-sword, And the fish, and the galley, with scrolls all round, And dim-lettered texts from the Holy Word; But all in the damp moss swathed and bound. A sidewall long had in ruins lain, And oh but the carved work mouldered fast 'Neath the suns, and the frosts, and the driving rain, And the tread of time, as it hastens past, And the seeds of life, and the wrath of man Casting down that which is fair to see, Some day to grieve that he never can Bring back the glory that wont to be. There at the head of the late filled grave Sadly a youth and a maiden stood, And only the lap of the rippling wave Broke on the hush of their solitude; Beautiful she, but as marble white, And looked like a monument planted there, Till a broad beam of the garish light Smote with a glory her golden hair. Scene—Isle-Monach. Ina and Kenneth. Ina. Thanks, Kenneth. Now, I want to be alone. Come back for me an hour hence. Kenneth. Yes, Miss Ina; It is good to be here; yes, for there are Good thoughts among the graves, and in the Islands; Better than in the towns. Ina. What kind of thoughts? Kenneth. Well; dreams of peace, and memories of gladness; And dreams and memories are all we have To live on in the Highlands. Ina. You are sad; What ails you, Kenneth? Kenneth. Oh, these thoughts will come When nothing ails you, as the clouds do when The sun is brightest. You will not stay long? Ina. No: but an hour is not too long to mourn For a dead Father. Kenneth. Yet it may be, Miss, Too long to be alone here. For these isles Are hollowed by sea-caves, and when you sit Musing alone, and hear the water rushing Around you, and beneath, it makes your breath Come quick with fancies. I had once a cousin Passed but a night on such an isle, and he Nigh lost his wits ere morning, for he thought That every streak of mist, and gleam of moonshine Pointed and mowed and mocked and laughed at him, So weird-like was the feeling of the place. Ina. Oh, nonsense, Kenneth. Are you superstitious Like all the rest—and you a scholar too? But I am not like you a poet, born To see the unseen, and feel a pulse of life Beating in brooks and rocks and sandy shores.— You lost a friend in him who now sleeps here. Kenneth. I lost my hope in life. Ina. Nay, say not so: We've not so many here among our hills With the rare gift of genius, and the love Of letters, and of all things beautiful, That we should let them pine away for lack Of needful culture. I am very sure My uncle will do as my father did, And send you still to College. How is Mairi? Kenneth. Mairi is gone to Doris Cattanach, And lost to me. Ina. Ah! that explains your gloom; You have fallen out, and hence your thoughts are sad. But how should she be lost to you because She's with her cousin? Kenneth. Can a maiden be With Doris, and remain what I have dreamed? Can the thaw come, and footsteps tread the snow, And broad wheels grind it down, and leave it still As when the white flakes trembled down from heaven? Ina. Kenneth, I fear that we are hard on Doris, We judge a stranger by our home-bred ways, Who, maybe, walks by other rule of right. I blame myself at times. Kenneth. And so did I, Miss Ina, when I heard that she had taken Mairi to be with her. I said like you, Perhaps 'tis we that have not understood her, And she has ta'en my little maid to make A lady of her, as you take a wild-flower, And plant it in a garden to enrich Its life and beauty. So I went to thank her. Ina. And found your Mairi still your pretty wild-flower, Only with brighter hues. Kenneth. I found her not At all. She is too grand to see me now; And Doris only mocked me. Ina. Nay, in that You surely are mistaken. She's a lady. Kenneth. And I am but a fisher lad. But you Shall judge yourself. There was a little song— A trifle like the shilfa's short bright note— Which I had writ for Mairi once to sing, And loved it, for my very soul was in it. Mairi had sung it in the great house there, And Doris made a comic rhyme of it, And said it over to me—very clever, And funny, but there was no heart in it; Yet it was like my own—oh, very like; Only the soul was gone. Ina. Ah! that was cruel; But Mairi did not know of it, be sure. Kenneth. Do you think so? Ina. Nay, I am certain of it. She is a girl whom neither wealth, nor arts Will turn from the bent of truth. Kenneth. Thank you for that. Ina. Let nothing shake your trust in her. Be sure Suspicion murders love, and from its death Come anguish and remorse. Kenneth. I will remember. Ina. And, Kenneth, when you make yourself a name, As I am sure you will do, for your songs Are like the murmur of the running brooks, Or like the wind that breathes upon the woods, And from each tree evokes a separate note To make the woodland harmony, and all So simple and true that they must touch men's hearts— Then you will do this, Kenneth: you will make These fishers' homes, which you do know so well, Dear to the world by your recital of The patience and the pathos of their lives, The tragedies enacted on the sea, And hunger of the body and soul alike Where bread and books are scarce. Kenneth. That I will, Miss; But you, we looked to you to help us? Ina. Nay, That is all past and gone. Kenneth. Why is it gone? Ina. This is a man's work; I have been a failure; And made his last days lonely whom I loved, And did no good to any one, and now My way of life must needs be far from these Grey rocks and lochs and isles.—Ah! Enter Sir Diarmid. Sir Diarmid. How now, Kenneth? I thought you never left your books, except To trim the boat, and set the lines. Kenneth. To-day, sir, I had to row Miss Ina to Isle-Monach.— Was it an hour you said, Miss? Sir Diarmid. Going now? Well, do not trouble to bring back the boat; I'll see Miss Ina home. Kenneth. Yes, sir. Sir Diarmid. Good-bye! [Exit Kenneth. Ina, forgive me that I followed you Into your still retreat. I saw the boat Making the cove behind the musselcrag, And could not help it. What a wealth of beauty Gathers around these mouldering abbey walls, Draped with pale lichens, and with graceful tufts Of small-leaved ferns, and lovingly embraced By the ivy, which they once upheld, that now, With reverence dutiful, sustains and brightens Their sad and tottering age. What cunning hand Carved these dark tombstones with their pregnant symbols That speak a braver faith than skulls and cross-bones And Time with scythe and hour-glass? You were right; Our fathers had an Art and a Religion, A sense of beauty and a hope in God, Nobler than ours. Do you come often here? Ina. Sometimes. Oh yes, the isle is very lovely; And yet I love it more for what it hides Than for the grace that hides it. Sir Diarmid. Ah! I know. Forgive me. You would rather be alone. Ina. Nay, it is I should beg to be forgiven: The place is yours; but yet it holds my dead Along with yours. Sir Diarmid. And living as well as dead, Our races soon shall mingle once again; Shall they not, Ina? It is not so long Since the two streams were parted. Ina. Yes; I know. Sir Diarmid. Yes! may I take that for my answer, then? Ina. Nay, do not wrest my words. I only meant That we were once of the same stock, and still, After our kindly Highland way, the river Scorns not the stream that left to turn the mill, And grind the meal. Sir Diarmid. But gladly welcomes back The mill-race to its bosom, having been A shallow and a stony brook without it. O Ina, you will make an empty life Once more a flowing river full and glad. Ina. This is no time or place for thoughts like these; I blame myself for listening, standing here Where I should know but sorrow. Sir Diarmid. Why should you Know only sorrow here or anywhere, Who bring such joy to others! When a wave, Broken and spent, ebbs back, what should it do But mingle with the new wave flowing in, And swell its volume? Should not love for him, then, Whom you have lost now blend with other love, And make an undivided absolute bliss, To fill and glad our life? Yet it is true, This place is all too sombre; let us hence, And get the sunshine round us as within. Ina. But there's no sunshine in me. I am truly A most unhappy maid; and what was said Must be as if it never had been said. Sir Diarmid. You cannot mean it. Ina. What is wrong? Do you not love me still? Ina. Do I not love you? Sir Diarmid. Yet you can speak thus calmly of unsaying All you have said. Ina. If it is best for you:— I cannot cease to love you while I live; Yet I can live, and have no hope in love. Sir Diarmid. If it is best for me! But it's not best; It is the worst and bitterest could befall me. What is it, Ina? Something troubles you. You used to be a leal, true-hearted girl, And frank and brave and not fantastical. Have I done aught to vex you? Ina. No, indeed; You have not changed to me nor I to you; I never trusted you as now I do; Nor felt before how desolate life will be Without you. Yet I came here now to make, Over his grave, a vow that we must part, Which well may be the breaking of one heart. Sir Diarmid. Nay, but of two hearts if it come to that. Yet why should any hearts be broken, Ina? Ina. Listen: we had not told him of our Love— Sir Diarmid. It was his sudden illness, not my will That kept me silent. Ina. Yes, indeed, I know: But when he lay a-dying, I bethought me, Not witting that the end could be so near, That it might comfort him to know our bliss;— And it is bliss, whatever come of it. But oh, instead of comforting, it made A stormy bar across the river-mouth Of life to him, and trouble and alarm. Sir Diarmid. But why? Ina. He muttered, meaning to explain, Something—but it was half-articulate— And all I heard was “Doris.” Sir Diarmid. Doris, said you? Well, now my heart is light again, and I Could laugh like children at a pantomime. Why, how could Doris come between us two? Ina. I cannot tell; only he named her name. Sir Diarmid. But what has Doris Cattanach to do With us, and with our love? And do you mean, Ina, that you could give me up to her? Ina. That would be hard. Sir Diarmid. I'd sooner mate me with A cloud, cram-full of lightning, hail, and thunder, Or wed a polar bear, and sail away Upon an iceberg. Think no more of this: Perhaps he did not hear you right, or else The mind was wandering, as it often does On the dim verge of life. Ina. Nay, he said plainly, “It must not be; you must not love him.” Sir Diarmid. Well; But that's past helping, Ina. Ina. Yes, I know. But yet his broken words left this whole thought Clear in my mind, it would work harm to you, And that through Doris somehow. I am sure That was his meaning. Sir Diarmid. Well, it is a riddle That puzzles me to solve. Shall we then shape Our lives by their hard puzzles? Ina. No, indeed; But yet it would be selfish if I shrank From a plain duty for the pain it costs, Or clung to that which would bring hurt to you. Sir Diarmid. But what would hurt me most were losing you. Ina. Ah, life is very hard. Sir Diarmid. Nay, life with love Is just the very best thing that I know. Now think no more of this. Ina. If I were only More worthy of you! Sir Diarmid. Let me judge of that: You rate yourself too humbly: it is I Should have my doubts of being meet for you; And yet I think Fate meant us for each other. Ina. But if I were to be a burden to you. Sir Diarmid. I want that very burden, cannot rise Without it to the heights where I would soar, More than the kite without its loaded tail. Come, Ina, cast these fears away, and speak, As on that happiest day of life to me When first our lips were framed to tell our love, And you did paint for us a restful home Amid a busy life, like this old house, What time the monks lived in it, and the folk Learnt of them letters, arts, and piety. You have a dainty fancy, and it made A pretty picture. Ina. But it was not fancy. O Diarmid, you may do a great work here Where work is greatly needed. Sir Diarmid. Could I take To work as much as sport, and had your help, Perhaps I might. Ina. Nay, do not think of me; You need no help but what their love provides. The people live in memories of the past, And all their happiest memories cluster round Those of your name and you. They may be stiff To men of alien blood, at times even false; But you have but to say, and they will do, For all their hearts are yours. Oh, if you knew them, And their pathetic faithfulness of love, Rooted in ages past. Sir Diarmid. There, now; 'tis good To hear you speaking once more like yourself, A Highland maiden for her clan and Chief. I love the people, and at first, I think, I loved you for the love you bore to them. But yet the task is hard. Ina. That I know well, For I have failed. And yet the hindrances To good and noble action mostly lie In our own bosoms. Sir Diarmid. May be. But the clergy, They hold the place which once the Chieftain held, And what have they made of it? Ina. They have made A patient, orderly, and pious people, According to their light. But they have not The place of eminence and influence, Which love has kept for you. Besides, our age, The more its spirit is religious, cleaves The more to secular forms, and will not take Its shape from priests. Sir Diarmid. But you will help me, Ina? Will be my inspiration if I try it? Ina. What other inspiration can you need Than to redress old wrongs, and help the growth Of civil polity, and self-control, And homes made glad by fruitful industry, And to be compassed round by all men's love? Sir Diarmid. There; every word you say but shows me more How much I need you. I am not a hero; Only a Highland laird, as indolent As all men are whose life is passed in sport. Ina. And I but a weak woman; I can do So little. And their life is an old growth Of time—a heritage of history, Not shaped by their intention, nor to be Fashioned, at once, by our new modes of thinking. Sir Diarmid. Now, say not you are weak. There's nought so strong As a clear-sighted woman. You shall even Do with me as you will, when I may hold This little hand in mine, and call it mine. Ina. O Diarmid, are we right? My father's words— His last words, mind— Sir Diarmid. Were something about Doris: And would you give me up to her? Ina. No truly. [Exeunt. Chorus. What has come over the sunshine? It is like a dream of bliss. What has come over the pine-woods? Was ever a day like this? O white-throat swallow, flicking The loch with long wing-tips, Hear you the low sweet laughter Comes rippling from its lips? What has come over the waters? What has come over the trees? Never were rills and fountains So merrily voiced as these. O throstle softly piping High on the topmost bough, I hear a new song singing, Is it my heart, or thou? ACT II.— SCENE I. Chorus. Fond of shooting, fishing, hunting, Sound of bagpipe, drum, or fife, Yacht and sail and flying bunting— All the ways of savage life; Sick of clubs and jolly fellows, Play and pantomime and clown, Novels bound in blues and yellows— All the idle ways of town; Tired of all the strife of Parties, Solemn dinners, routs, and drums, Public meetings where no heart is, And a chairman haws and hums; What shall youth do when the river Has no pools where salmon lie, And the sun is shining ever, And the trouting streams are dry, And the grouse-cock gaily crowing Fears not either dog or gun, And the partridge broods are growing, While the corn grows in the sun? Weary he of fly and feather, Weapon shining on the shelf, Weary of unchanging weather, Weary maybe of himself; For he was not meant for daily Bringing basket full, or bag, Shooting grouse or capercailzie, Stalking of the timid stag. What shall he do, weary-laden, If in such a vacant hour He shall happen on a maiden Lovely as a sweet wild-flower, With a noble nature truly, Pointing him to noble deeds, Plucking up the thoughts unruly Growing in his mind like weeds, Opening to his soul a grander Life than he has lived before, As among the hills they wander, Or beside the grey sea-shore? Ah! the passion, all-constraining, That now lifts his heart above Vacant mood and vain complaining, Lapt in bliss of early love! Scene—Kildrostan. Sir Diarmid and Lady MacAlpine. Sir Diarmid (singing) “To Norroway, to Norroway, To Norroway owre the faem.” Lady MacAlpine. Why do you sing that ballad? My old heart Goes pit-a-pat to hear it; like the merle That sees a gled o'erhead. Surely you are not Tired of me yet. Sir Diarmid. Nay, mother, not of you;— You're always pleasant company—but somewhat A-weary of the weather which is bad, Being so good, and of myself a little, And of the world in general. Lady MacAlpine. Don't be silly. Sir Diarmid. I think I never was more sensible, But to be sensible is to be dull; All sensible folk are tiresome. Have you heard That ever any of our ancestors Mingled their blue blood with a gipsy witch's? Lady MacAlpine. What do you mean, boy? Sir Diarmid. Only this, that I Am rather of their roving disposition, And with the first crisp bursting of the leaf, Or even while buds are only reddening yet On the bare boughs, and primrose banks are bare, Begin to feel a stirring in my veins, As if I must be off into the woods, And hang a kettle on a tripod o'er A fire of sticks, and steal my own young hares. Yet here is half the summer past, and still I'm at the chimney nook. Had I not been A baronet, I should have been a poacher In shabby velveteen, and had a lurcher Close at my heels, and half my days in jail, And half i' the moors and woods. I wonder we Can hate them so, they are so like ourselves. Lady MacAlpine. Don't talk so idly, you do let your tongue Run off with what small sense you have. Sir Diarmid. But how About that gipsy, mother? I am sure There must have been one in our family tree. Was she dropt from it as a rotten branch, Or christened Lady Margaret Merrilees, Or Honourable Gertrude Jenny Faa Of Hedgerow Elms, in Thieveshire? Lady MacAlpine. Hold your peace. Your ancestors were noble and highborn, And mated with the best blood of the land. Sir Diarmid. Well, mother, do not frown at me; I do But jest, and yet it was a foolish jest, The birth of vacant brains. Having nought to do, I've seen you bring old rubbish from your drawers— Scraps of brown lace, housewifes, and baby linen, Buttons, old dingy letters, battered thimbles— And litter all the room with them; and I Being idle, throw the rubbish of my mind About me too, and sorry stuff it is. Lady MacAlpine. Well, well; you might find matter for your jests Fitter than those to whom you owe your being. But now you'll stay at home. 'Tis weary waiting Alone in my old age. Sir Diarmid. Old age! why, you Are younger in my eyes, and handsomer Than half the girls I meet. My little mother, You never can grow old, your heart's so young, While they are old i' their teens. Yet I must go, Only I would not leave you quite alone. Lady MacAlpine. But wherefore must you go? Sir Diarmid. A promise, mother; Far rather would I be at home with you. And after this I mean to spend my days In sheer respectability, and go Duly to church, and play the justice too, And lecture rogues and vagabonds, and sit On Boards, and manage every one's affairs, Like a true Chief. But there's a College friend Who worships Thor and Odin, when he tires Of Zeus and Aphrodite and Apollo; And I had promised he should see the land Of Vikings and Berserkers, and the Fiords From which their galleys oared to seek adventures. So now he writes me he is coming here To-day, and I must get the old yawl in trim, And see if she will float to Norroway. Lady MacAlpine. A friend who worships Odin! Why, the man Must be a pagan. Sir Diarmid. Well; he rather is A something of a pagan and a poet, Yet no bad fellow, either, in his way. He will not sacrifice the sheep, or kids, Or horses; being æsthetic, he will be Content with fruits and flowers and wine libations. Lady MacAlpine. What do you mean? Is that what young men learn At College now? Sir Diarmid. Yes; some of them prefer Boating or boxing, cricketing or hunting, Lawn-tennis, or to drive a four-in-hand; But the more studious mostly spend their terms Seeking for a religion. Lady MacAlpine. Now you jest; I know it by your look:—As if young men Could leave their parents' homes without religion! Why let this mocking fiend ironical Cover your better thought? Sir Diarmid. I do not mock. It may be that they bring up from their homes Their cradle-faiths, but they are stript quite bare Ere many months pass. And besides, a man May wish new clothes, who is not wholly naked, May feel he has outgrown his baby robes, May be ashamed too of his rustic fit, And fain to dress his soul in the last fashion, And wear it jauntily. So we are grown To be a sort of dandies in religion, Affecting the last mode. At present, we Incline to Pagan cults, but are not sure Whether is best the Greek or the Barbarian: While some prefer pure Atheism to both, And will have neither soul, nor other life, Nor anything but organisèd dust Which lives its day, and on the morrow is Moral manure enriching other lives. Lady MacAlpine. Diarmid, you have not lost your faith? Sir Diarmid. Well, no; I have not found a better than my mother Sung o'er my cradle. Lady MacAlpine. That is well. Pray heaven You hold to that. I hear such dreadful things About our young men now; and even the girls Chatter half-atheism with as brisk an air As if it were new ribbons they discussed. There's Ina Lorne reads books would make my hair To stand on end. Sir Diarmid. No fear of Ina, mother; Her heart's all right. And that reminds me now, It was of her I meant to speak. She is Alone in that dull house, and for a while You too will be alone: why should you not Have her with you to cheer your solitude? We are her kinsfolk, and I've heard you say She makes a good day in a drizzling rain. Lady MacAlpine. She sees no visitors, keeps her room, and claims The privilege of sorrow to be rude. Sir Diarmid. Nay, mother, rude she cannot be, and least Of all to you. Lady MacAlpine. Well, no: but what means this— This new-born care for cousins who would scarce Count kin save in the Highlands? You're not wont To speak so warmly of them. Sir Diarmid. That is true; For some are bores, and some are gossips born, And some are butterflies, and some are wasps, And some are geese. But Ina's not like them. Lady MacAlpine. No; but she's somewhat flighty, is she not? Sir Diarmid. How mean you? Lady MacAlpine. Well, she always has some new Enthusiasm—some pet scheme or other, To remedy the lot of our poor folk, Which yet is ne'er the better for it. Sir Diarmid. Yes! Maybe; and yet one likes her all the more; For if it be a fault, at least it's not A common fault among our Highlanders. We're not enthusiasts for the people's rights; More shame to us that she is so alone! Lady MacAlpine. But, Diarmid, what will Doris say to it? They have not taken kindly to each other. Sir Diarmid. Why, what has she to do with it? Lady MacAlpine. She'll think It is her place to keep me company, And will resent to see another here. Sir Diarmid. Why should it be her place? and why should she Resent your choice of Ina? And indeed That girl is too much with you. Lady MacAlpine. But the time Draws near; and you must first arrange with her Before you go. Sir Diarmid. What time? what do you mean? What is there to arrange with her? Oh yes! About her shootings—I will see to that. Lady MacAlpine. Her shootings! nonsense: 'tis about herself. Sir Diarmid. Now, mother, you are many fathoms deeper Than my line goes. Lady MacAlpine. Did not your father tell you, As he lay dying, how things stood between Doris and you? Sir Diarmid. Well; he was very fain That I should wed her some day, and I promised— For that I saw his heart was set on it— That I would try to love her if I could, And wed her if I loved her, which I cannot. Lady MacAlpine. And was that all? was there no sterner hint Of hard necessity? Sir Diarmid. There was no more. Lady MacAlpine. Oh this is cruel, laying it on me To blur a father's memory. But you promised To love her, and you'll keep your promise. Sir Diarmid. What Troubles you, mother? You are strangely moved. I said that I would love her if I could, And I tried hard, but she would never let me. Even as a girl she always spited me, Threw stones into the pool where I was angling, Tore down the nests I watched with tender care, And rode my pony till she foundered him,— Cruel as well as spiteful. Lady MacAlpine. A spoilt child With that hot Indian blood in her, untamed; But unripe fruit is bitter oft i' the mouth, Yet mellows with the months. Sir Diarmid. But has she mellowed? I could not bear to leave you here with her; And Ina too so lonely. Lady MacAlpine. Never fear; We shall do nicely. And for Ina, when You make your nest here in the old family tree, 'Twere well to feather it softly, not to plant A thorn there for your mate. Sir Diarmid. But Ina's not A thorn. She's never sharp, and never stings Like Doris. Lady MacAlpine. Dear, I do not understand Why you should harp on Ina. Let her be. Her uncle's house, of course, will be her home; He's rich and solitary. If you have nothing Against poor Doris but her childish freaks, Would you for them neglect your dying father's So earnest wish? Sir Diarmid. Nay, not for them alone. Mother, no man, that is a man, would care To catalogue a lady's blemishes; To say, I cannot love her for her pride, Yet love her less in her humility; When she is bitter, I cannot abide her, And yet I loathe her more, when she is sweet. Ask me no more; indeed, I tried and failed: Besides, I cannot offer to a market That does not want my wares. Lady MacAlpine. There I am sure You are mistaken, for she likes you, Diarmid. Sir Diarmid. Then 'tis a liking that I do not like, And never shall. Were Doris the one Eve In all the world, I'd rather, for my share, The thorns and briars outside, and leave her Eden All to herself, than company with her. Have I not seen you frown, with mingled shame And anger, at her reckless speech? for still Her thoughts go naked, and are not ashamed; Yet not from innocence. You love her not, And would not like, I think, to sit on nettles What time my wife opened her mouth to speak. Lady MacAlpine. I know she has her faults—so have we all: But you might help to mend them. And oh, Diarmid, It must be. Sir Diarmid. What must be? And also why Must it so be? You speak in riddles to me. Lady MacAlpine. Diarmid, you love your father's memory; Would you not rather suffer any loss Than part with that? Sir Diarmid. Indeed I would. But who Can take from me the picture of his goodness, Hung in the inmost chamber of my heart, As men set up a holy altar-piece For worship. That he was mistaken about This girl, harms not his memory to me. Lady MacAlpine. Ah me! I wot not what to do. This task Should never have been left to me. I tell you You have no choice but marry Doris now. Sir Diarmid. I have no choice, for I have made my choice, And would not have her, mother, if she brought A kingdom for her dower. Lady MacAlpine. Nay, hear me; let Me tell the sorry tale. Your father, Diarmid,— 'Tis hard to unveil the faults of those we love, When death has hallowed love—in his hot youth Had wasted his estate with cards and dice; But when he won my hand, which brought much wealth, He promised ne'er to gamble while he lived. Happy our life was while he kept his word! Nor did he break the letter of it ever, Only the spirit, cheating conscience so With words depleted of their natural sense. Then came this Malcolm Cattanach from India, A widower, with one child, and very rich: He had been born a crofter in Glenara, Was a contractor and a money-lender, And there were strange things whispered about him— I know not with what truth, of course, but men Were shy of him who had been in the East, As many here had been.—But 'tis too much; I cannot go on with it. Sir Diarmid. Quite right, mother; Let Doris and her dubious father drop Out of your mind; they only give you pain. Lady MacAlpine. Would that were possible! I must tell you all, Howe'er it wring my heart. He settled near us In the next glen, and lived a sumptuous life, Costly, luxurious, though his ways were coarse, And with a splendour of colour, hardly fitting The sober grey of our dim Highland glens. Your father took to him, although he laughed At the peach-coloured liveries; praised his talent, Quoted his sayings; hankered to berich, And live like him; and they were closeted Often for hours together. Until then He never had a secret thought from me; But now he kept me in the dark, and that Wounded and wronged my love. It soon appeared This clever, scheming man had led him on— Who knew no more than I—to speculate In foreign loans, and mines, and for the rise And fall of markets; and he, all unskilled To watch the turns o' the tide, bought in too soon, And sold too late, and gambled all away. Ah me! the weary days! the anxious looks! The fretful temper! and the settled gloom, With the fell crash at last! Sir Diarmid. But why recall This story now, since, after all, we have Enough for all our wants? What need to cry O'er our spilt milk, when all our pails are full, And the cow yields as ever? Lady MacAlpine. Wait a bit; One day he told me that my all was gone, And I, like you, said lightly, Never mind; We have the old home still, and our old love, Which none can rob us of. But therewithal, He only looked the gloomier, and cursed Himself, his friend, and all the ravenous crew Of jobbers and promoters. Then I said, Now, let us have no secrets; that has been The worst of all our losses, the decay Of that full trust that made us one indeed. Perhaps a woman's wit may find a way To mend things, or to bear them. I was sore At his concealment, sorer than I said, For empty heart is worse than empty purse, And mine had been made vacant by neglect. But when I found that Malcolm Cattanach Had led him on and on, till every acre And every stone o' the house, and every right Of fishing, shooting, mining, were in bond To him for moneys lent and lost, my heart Utterly failed me. Sir Diarmid. Are we beggars, then, On Doris' charity? Lady MacAlpine. Scarcely yet. I have My jointure, and I got a legacy After your father's death. Not otherwise Could you have gone to College. Sir Diarmid. Had I known this, I would not so have wasted all these years In idleness, that might have yielded fruit For wintry days. Lady MacAlpine. I thought your father told you. But that's not all. There is another bond, That if you claim her hand ere you have passed Your four and twenty years, then she and all Her gathered wealth are yours. Sir Diarmid. How, if I fail? Lady MacAlpine. That will be very ruin. Sir Diarmid. One word more. What, if I ask, and she refuse my hand? Lady MacAlpine. To punish her, he gives you back the land. But she will not refuse. Sir Diarmid. I daresay not. 'Tis a hard case. Has Doris known all this? Lady MacAlpine. Yes, years ago. Sir Diarmid. Ah! that accounts for much. I must have time to think. Lady MacAlpine. There is your friend Just driven to the door; a handsome youth, But yet a bit effeminate. I'll see him At dinner time. Sir Diarmid. It is unfortunate His coming at this moment. But I must Be civil, though my head is in a whirl. [Exeunt. Chorus. Vain for a man to think that he Can hide what a woman is fain to know! Vain to dream that she does not see, Because her seeing she does not show He cannot lie with a guileless look Of innocence pure that falters not, And she will read like a printed book The riddle of his most secret thought. Well she saw where his love was given, Saw that her tidings had quenched his light, Saw that he grasped, as if for heaven, A hope that would leave him in sorry plight. And oh that Ina might be her daughter! Oh the dread of his fated wife! Oh the hopes that were writ on water! Oh her boy, and his shipwrecked life! SCENE II. Chorus. Ah! what to do, if one should get A tawny lion for a pet! Or some volcano as a boon To play its fireworks like a tune! O terror of his playful moods! O horror of its lava floods! So troubled and amazed were they, So feared what he might do or say, That youth fantastical whose wit With the old Pagan cult was smit, And stormed, in words that swing and swell, Like changeful peal of tripping bell, Against the love that is divine, And for the love inflamed with wine. Daily their simple souls were shocked With fleering scornful words that mocked At Faith and Unfaith, nothing loth, At God and Science, lightlying both; But what the shallow heart believed Of all it praised, and all it grieved, Although he did his rating well, 'Twould need a wiser man to tell. Still Zeus to him was Great and Mighty, Still reigned the foam-born Aphrodite, Still bright Apollo's arrows flew, Still Dian brushed the evening dew, Still Naiads haunted fount and brook, And life was like a fairy-book: Or Odin stern came back again, And Thor, and noble Balder slain By Loke's dark counsel, and the Tree. Great Ygdrassil, of Mystery, And all the Myths of ancient Night, Myths of the dawn and growing light, Myths of the earth, the cloud, the star, And life and its eternal war. Scene—Kildrostan Park. Sir Diarmid and Tremain. Sir Diarmid. So we give up our cruise, then, after all? 'Tis well; for, as it happens, it would scarce Have suited me to go. You'll not regret it? Tremain. Why should I? 'Twas a sudden fancy struck me, And just as sudden left. Sir Diarmid. No other reason? Tremain. What other would you have? Must one have reasons To knock down fancies with—a club to beat The vapour off, that passes with a puff? I choose to have my whims, and let them go E'en as I list. It is a folly, man, A superstition of these modern times, To be in bonds to reason. Sir Diarmid. As you like. But there's a nice breeze tripping on the loch, Tipping the waves with foam. Have you no fancy To ride the white steeds in a merry gale? Tremain. Nay, that's all past. I hate a boisterous life. Give me the calm of Tempe, where no wind Blows on the vine-stocks roughly, and where love Pants in the sunshine dreamily among The lotus leaves and asphodels. Sir Diarmid. What then? Are all those pictures of the bounding sea, And billowy roll of life there, and your skill With sail and rope and rudder in a storm, But so much moonshine? Tremain. Moonshine! surely no; But poetry of course. O you dull fellows, Tied down to facts, you lose the half of life, Missing its fancied part. I sit and dream Of lying in a pinnace with my love, On a pard's skin, or carpet Easterndyed Of gorgeous colours, with a cloudless sun Inflaming every sense, as we look down, And watch the pulsing globe, and tangled arms Of myriad Medusæ. Then I see Ideal storms loom darkly, and the waves Lashed into madness, which I master so That by the sense of power we relish more The soft delights of love. But your wet ropes, And clumsy oars—faugh! they give blisters first, And then a horny hand; and life is lost, By so much, when you lose a perfect sense. 'Tis needful for my Art that I should have Nice touch and taste and smell and sight and hearing, That through all gates may fine sensations pass Into my being, and enrich my life. Sir Diarmid. Tush! man; you are not so effeminate As you affect. Tremain. I never handled rope, Nor held a tiller, nor yet mean to do: A harp, even, blunts the finger-tips. You think To be effeminate is to be weak: I hold that manhood only then is perfect, When it has all a woman's delicate sense, And absolute refinement, and will answer, Like the wind-harp, in tremulous response To every breath of fancy. Sir Diarmid. How then shall you Employ your holiday? Our ways are rough, Nor do we fear to blunt a sense by use. Tremain. If I might just go on as now we do, Bound to no method, held to no set plans, Floating as fancy wills, or Fate decrees! Those hills are beautiful in the purple lights Of evening, glassed upon the quiet loch; And weird-like are the wavering morning mists, Tinted with rainbow fragments, like the glories Which hover in the cloudland of old times; And pleasant is the swaying of the boat, And lapping of the waters; and I think I could write something smacking of the life Of the young world, while yet the gods were in it, As I look round and see the fisherwomen Wade through the surf i' the twilight to the boats, Each with her husband, or her sweetheart, maybe, Borne pick-a-back. Sir Diarmid. A barbarous custom! I Have tried to shame the men out of these ways, And do not wonder that you mock at them. Tremain. I do not mock at them. I never felt More tenderly to any ancient relic Than to this fond survival. Let it be. Why drive your modern ploughshare over all The ways of primitive custom, making them As flat and commonplace as turnip fields. Let it alone. It is the antique symbol Of women's loyalty to love—a link Uniting us with a more touching life Of loyal service. Had I but such a Naiad— Only not quite so freckled and uncombed— To plash her large limbs in the waves for me! Sir Diarmid. Never was such a plea for barbarism Pleaded before. Tremain. And yet as good a one As you shall find for worshipping a maid, Until she is a wife to worship you. Why is it barbarous? Was the Greek a savage, When the fair princess, with her laughing maidens, Washed the white linens in the sparkling brook, And lovers lay upon the grass, and noted The dainty feet that splashed the shining spray? Sir Diarmid. Well, you may well play the lawyer for the nonce, And draw me out, from murky heathen times, Precedents of authority to bar The way of progress. But you'll not persuade me The custom's not degrading. Tremain. Ay, in vain We hope to master prejudice by reason.— But how about this Doris you should wed, And will not, though her acres are so handy? What ails you at her? Sir Diarmid. This; she loves me not, As shrewdly I suspect; nor love I her, As certainly I know. And when we speak Of marriage, that's a point at least. Tremain. I know not; I'm not a marrying man, though all my life Is love and poetry, which mostly lose Their glory at the touch o' th' wedding ring. It is a quakerish thing connubial bliss, Tame and slow-blooded, dressed in browns and greys, And with no flash of passion in the eye, Or flush o' the cheek. Is she not beautiful? Sir Diarmid. Truly; yet with a dangerous kind of beauty, Beauty as of a panther or a snake, Lustrous and lithe; or so at least she shows To me who love her not. Her father wedded In the far East a Hindoo girl, and so The daughter is not, like our Highland maids, Ruddy and large with amber in their hair, But slight and supple, and the sun has dyed Her cheek with olive. Yet she is most fair. Tremain. Ah! now you interest me. 'Tis just the kind Of beauty that I worship. Helena's Was dangerous, and the grand Egyptian Queen's Who conquered the world's conquerors, and the sun Had softly dusked the snow of cheek and bosom, That chills our northern women. There's no joy Without the sense of danger; therefore men Climb the precipitous mountains with a feeling Of tingling, perilous gladness: and I hate Your meek and milky girls that dare not kiss A burning passion, clinging to your lips. Sir Diarmid. Doris is not a Cleopatra, nor Helen of Troy—she's just a Highland lady Touched with an Eastern strain. You must not liken her To your wild-eyed Aspasias. Tremain. But you said Hers was a dangerous beauty, like the serpent's, And that is what I like above all things. Serpents twine round you, clasp you in their folds, And charm you with a gaze that does not flinch; Firing you as the many-husbanded Helen was wont to do, till men would lose The world for one brief rapture of her kiss. Sir Diarmid. I spoke too loosely: you misconstrue me, So fancying her. Tremain. There's nothing else against her, Except that dangerous beauty, which is only The prejudice of people commonplace. I like to play with adders. I had one I loved once as you love your dog, and had Subtler communion with it, richer thoughts From its uprearings, and its wondrous eyes Than you shall get from any noisy hound With its rough shows of liking. Sir Diarmid. Well, I'd rather My dog should jump on me, and wheel about Barking for joy, than have an adder twine Slow folds about me. But tastes differ. Tremain. Ay, They differ; yet there is a worse and better, For taste is the true test of character: The crown of culture is a perfect taste, Which lacking, men are blind and cannot see The higher wisdom. 'Tis the want of it That floods the world with stale stupidities, And hangs a vulgar arras round the mind Of misbegotten fallacies. Tastes differ! And so do faiths and policies, but yet Their differences are not indifferent. Sir Diarmid. You need not rave about it, man. I used A common phrase, as one does current coin, Not caring to ring copper half-pennies Upon the counter. Tremain. Oh, yet I take leave To doubt the taste that shrinks from such a girl As you describe your Doris: that is all. The kind of woman, bred of Christian cult, Whom you call womanly, to me is watery— A ghost, a mist that chills you with its touch. How changed from the grand creature Nature made For joy, and music, and the giddy dance, And glorious passion! There's a story of Pelagia, leader of the mimes at Antioch On the Orontes; how she came one day Up from the silvern baths with her fair troop Of girls, all glowing with the flush of life, And bounding with light mirth, and lures of love, Like the young hinds, what time the year reveals The antlered stag freed from the down of his horns; And as she came, arrayed in purple skirt Of Tyrian, golden bracelets on her wrists, And tinkling anklets, and the flash of gems Upon her bosom, on her brow of flowers— Lo! then an anchorite, dried up, and baked With dirt of some dim cave where he had burrowed With bats and owls, looked wistfully on her, And craftily assailed her with regrets That she brought not her beauty and her joy— Another Magdalene!—to serve his Lord: Wherewith being touched, she turns a penitent, And comes next day, and lays aside her robes Of splendour, and her bright and joyous ways So winsome, and in squalid garb arrayed Of sackcloth, visits graves and lazar houses, Pale as lily—a shadow called a saint. What think you now of such a work as that To pleasure Heaven with? While the old gods lived A woman was the glory of our glad And fruitful earth. But now you make of her— Sir Diarmid. I prithee, peace, man. If I did not know This is but spinning moonshine for the love Of phantasy, and framing paradox To seem original, I could be wroth With such trash-speaking. Interrupt me not. What, if your leader of the mimes had been A chaste pure maiden, daughter of a home Where mother-love enfolded her in customs As sweet as lavender, and that she met Some gay apostle of the flesh, and as His penitent, became—what you have known? The world is bad enough, and false enough Without such gloss to prove its darkness light. The devil is up to that; and does not need That you should make fine clothes for him to wear When he goes masking. Let this stuff alone; Or weave it into verses, if you will, For fools to read, although I used to think— But that was in my youth's fond innocence— That poetry should stir the best in us, And give fit utterance also to our best In rhythmic music. Tremain. That was not your thought: 'Twas but an echo you and others tossed From mouth to mouth, and thought that you had thought. Sir Diarmid. Echo or living voice, the thought is true; God gives us song to make usnobler men And purer women. Tremain. Nay, for art is not The slave of virtue, turning songs to sermons; But it is free, and is its own excuse, And finds its purpose in its exercise. Sir Diarmid. What do you mean? Tremain. This. Picturing truly all Ideals—good or evil, as you call them— Art doth fulfil her office, but comes short Of her vocation when she aims at aught But perfect form and colour and harmony. Sir Diarmid. Enough: I did not count on getting such Art-lectures from you. Keep them for the freshmen. Tremain. You make a pedant and a pedagogue Of that which is the sovranest thing in nature, The freest and the gayest. Out upon The tyranny of small moralities, Shop-keeping ethics, Pharisee respects! As if high Art must minister to them, Like a fair tablemaid who must not speak, But let them prose and prose! I hate it all. For evil and good, yea sense and nonsense, Art, Soaring above them in her own bright realm, Yet lifts them up, and blends them in her charm Of light and music and divinest vision. But you are still in bonds to commonplace, And cannot bear this yet. Sir Diarmid. Nor ever shall, Nor ever wish to. One might land in Bedlam For less conceit of wisdom. Tremain. By the way, There's one thing more I wish to know. Last night, Or rather in the gloaming, as you have it, Upon the heights, beside the waterfall That wavers like a tremulous white veil Of bridal lace to hide the moss-clad rock, I had a vision of beauty. Sir Diarmid. Oh, belike The purple glow was on the hills. Tremain. Nay, but A maiden passed me tall and beautiful, Robed all in black. Her step was like a queen's, Pallas-Athene had no statelier mien, Broad-browed, large-eyed, and with the confidence Of strength and courage in her. Who is she? Sir Diarmid. How should I know? No matter. Tremain. Girls like that Can't walk about the shore incognito: You surely know her; think of it again. I did but pass some pretty compliment— Thrown at her, to be picked up if she chose, Not spoken to her—an impromptu verse That sprang up to my lips at such a vision Of might and beauty delicately mixed, When she, just pausing, gave me such a look, As if she could have tossed me o'er the crag Into the pool, then leisurely swept on. Who is she? All the fisher folk would say Was, “It will be Miss Ina.” Sir Diarmid. Ay, that was Ever her favourite walk. Now, if you chance To meet her there again, best let her pass Without impromptu verses. You might find They breed unpleasant consequences. Tremain. But Who is she? Sir Diarmid. Well; no matter: my kinswoman. Her father was our pastor, lately dead— No more of her. When shall we visit Doris? She's far more to your taste. Tremain. Oh, when you will. But that dark-robed Pallas-Athene your Kinswoman, said you? Sir Diarmid. Surely you would not Intrude upon the sacredness of sorrow Like hers. Tremain. The parson's daughter— Sir Diarmid. Sir, I tell you She shall not be molested. Tremain. So: I see Why Doris' beauty is so dangerous. Pallas-Athene, broad-browed, shining-eyed, That is your style, is't? [Exit. Sir Diarmid. Pshaw! why should I care For that fool's babble? for a fool he is With all his genius, which is but a trick Of stringing words together musically. How could I ever bring him to the home Of pious, pure-souled women. Yet he'll serve My purpose, if he only take to Doris, And she to him—she is not over-nice. But is it fair that I should plot and scheme To save myself from a detested fate By luring her into as dark a snare? Nay, but I only bring these two together, And by the mutual attraction of Their kindred natures let them coalesce, If so they will—and surely so they will: Only the time is short. Yet such folk jump Into their loves; and if it so befell, My path were clear, and all should yet be well. Chorus. O cunning schemer! O idle dreamer! With crafty head, And heart elate, Spinning a thread To baffle Fate! Twirl the spindle ever so fast, Let the thread be ever so fine, Fate will rend thy web at last, Fruitless labour surely thine. Sore against thee are the odds Wrestling with the immortal gods. SCENE III. Chorus. Once more, with a heart undivided, And vexed by no discords of thought, But calm in the hope she had got, In a great peace she abided. Not that the grief was forgot, Or self-reproaches were ended, But that the sorrow was blended With love, and the bliss which it brought. Once more, like a dainty bird preening Its feathers, she cared for her looks, And pondered her favourite books, And read with clear sense of their meaning; And the fishermen, plying their hooks, Would hear fishermen, plying their hooks, Would hear in the dusk of the gloaming A full-throated song that was coming From the Manse 'mong the trees and the rooks. Once more, from her Dante and Goethe, She came into clachan and cot, And still it was sunshine she brought, Though her speech was of patience and duty; For oh, but she never forgot The grace that is due to all human, Or the low soft voice of a woman Perfect in feeling and thought. Scene—Street: Post Office Door. Ina, Mrs. Slit, Doris (in the distance). Mrs. Slit. Good-bye, then, Miss Ina; and it iss a light there will be in the shop this day, because you have been in it again. Ina. Good-bye. You will be sure to remember the warm things for old Elspet's rheumatism. Mrs. Slit. Och! yes, I will remember them. Ina. And Dugald's snuff, and Alisthair's tea. Mrs. Slit. And the snuff and the tea, though it iss the porridge that iss good enough for him, and more than he deserves, for it would be the whisky that brought him to this. Ina. Maybe. But who of us get just what we deserve? Mrs. Slit. That iss true. Yes! Some get more, and some get less; some have a penny's-worth for their halfpenny, and some only a farthing's-worth for their penny; and it iss the scales of Providence that would not do for a shop, whatever. But I will mind, Miss Ina. Ina. That is right. But there is Sir Diarmid's yacht in the Loch. Is he going a trip anywhere? Mrs. Slit. Och! it iss that Poet-man that gets the letters and the printed papers every day. He will not be for leaving the Loch, I think. They are saying he iss a great bard or Seannachie, though I never heard him sing, or even whistle, as our lad Kenneth will do. Ina. But Poets make songs, and other people sing them now. However, I must bid you good-bye. Mrs. Slit. Good-bye; but it iss Miss Doris that will be coming along the street now; and which iss more, she will be picking her steps, and sniffing as if her father would be a Chief instead of a cottar's son. Maybe you will not be caring to see her. Ina. Why should I not wish to see Doris? But even if I did not, I cannot help it now, for she has seen me. Mrs. Slit. Fare you well, Miss. And take care of that one. It will he easier dealing with Elspet's rheumatics than with her smiles, which only show her teeth. Ina. Good-morning, Doris. You are early astir. Doris. Well, this is pleasant, Ina, seeing you Abroad, and like yourself again. They told me Your eyes were red with weeping; but they're not. Indeed, I think they never were so bright. That's right. What is the good of injuring The very feature of one's face that men Chiefly admire? One ought to think of that. Ina. Ought one? I don't know that I did think of it. But never mind: my eyes are all right, Doris. Doris. That's plain enough to see; you look quite brilliant. But how did you get through the time of mourning? Is it not horrible—the blinds, the silence, The people whispering, the dismal looks? I was so sorry for you, and I called A score of times, I'm sure. Ina. I'm vexed at that; The servant only told me about once. Doris. Oh, twice, at least. But then I meant to come So often, and you would not let me in; Indeed, I thought of you from morn till night, And could not keep you from my sleeping dreams, I was so grieved. How did you pass the time? You don't read novels; yet they're such a help At such a season. Why, I lay all day, And got through half of Mudie when my daddy Dropt from his perch. I can't think how you did. It's dreadful to be shut up with the Bible, And Pilgrim's Progress, just like prisoners Upon the silent system. Ina. Well, I was not Condemned to that quite, though I might have had Worse company. Doris. You did not think of cards, I daresay; yet you've no idea how They get you through the evenings, when your heart Is like to break. Ina. No, certainly I did not. Doris. Well, it's a pity now; for they just give you The kind of mild excitement which you need When you are low—not staking much, you know, Only what will give interest to the game. And when I called that day I meant to try them, In case you had been very bad. Ina. Oh, thanks; I daresay you meant kindly, but you do not Quite understand me. Doris. Yes, indeed I do. I hear folk say they cannot comprehend you, But that is their stupidity, and I Tell them I see you through and through like glass; You are so simple. Ina. Oh! Doris. And when you shut Your door, and would not see a visitor, I said it was a proper thing to do, And when the proper time came you'd appear Splendid as ever; and there you are, my dear, A miracle of beauty. That dress, now; You cannot think how perfect you are in it. Where was it made? But all your dresses fit you. Was this what smote Tremain? Ina. What do you mean? Who is Tremain? Doris. Not know Tremain! and he Raving about you as a heathen goddess— Not Venus, but another quite as handsome, And cleverer far, though I forget her name. Why, what can Diarmid mean, that he has never Brought him to see you? Ina. Oh, I am not seeing Strangers at present. Doris. But he's quite a genius, And one should see them when they come one's way, Which is not often; then he is so handsome, And knows so many people, and is so Charmingly wicked—but you'll not like that Of course, because you've grown up in a Manse Where every one is bound to be good, of course. Tremain is quite a pagan, but his gods Are all dead long ago; and he knows that, And does not worship Zeus and Aphrodite, As he would like to do; only he rages— Ever so eloquent and beautiful!— At those who overthrow their shrines and altars. Ina. Doris, you surely do not lend an ear To one who, for the living God, would thrall you To these poor bodiless shadows. He must be A shallow fool, I think; for there are some Whose genius, like a marsh-light, flickers where There is no footing for a man to go. Doris. But you know, Ina, I am only half A Christian, half a Brahmin, and a daughter Goes with the mother mostly, and I like The folks you call poor heathens. What he says, Besides, is that it does not matter much About our gods, whether they are or are not, Or what they are. The one thing that concerns us, Is the idea of life which they call forth, And ours is now all wrong. The Church, he says, Has consecrated grief instead of gladness, Has cast the shadow of the cross where heaven Poured down the laughing sunshine; even science, That scorning miracle is full of wonders, Potters o'er facts and numbers, and makes man Just a machine for grinding out these facts. But the old gods of Greece made joyous life With song and dance and flowers and wine and love— Oh, you should hear him, just. Ina. Do you think so? I fancy that a cross which tells of hope Through sorrow, is better than remorseless Fate Chaining the soul to rocks and piercing ice. I wish folk had more pleasure in their lives, More flowers and sunshine, though I'd rather not More foxglove, hellebore, and deadly nightshade. What does he say of conscience? Doris. Conscience! Oh, He thinks it is a blister that has made The soul so sensitive it cannot bear The touch that nature meant us to enjoy. He's very scornful of it. Ina. So I fancied The trifler would despies its inspirations. Zeus neveer had much conscience. Doris. Then he brings you Just to the verge of shocking things, and when You're bridling up in anger, 'tis such fun To watch him sailing off, as if he had not Seen the improper thoughts which made you pause. Ina. And does Sir Diarmid like a man like that? I cannot think it. Doris. They're inseparable. 'Tis strange he has not brought him to the Manse. Ina. Nay, it were stranger to have brought him there; Its air would not agree with him. Doris. Indeed, He's quite a revelation—something new Entirely in these parts. Ina. Yes, I should hope so. A revelation—only of the darkness, Not of the light. I think I saw the man Once, and I took him for a coxcomb truly. Doris. Oh, but he raves of you. Ina. That's likely enough: His words are mostly ravings. Doris. No, indeed; He has the daintiest fancies, beautiful, Poetic; and he makes you gasp for fear Of what he may say next, which is so nice. Ina. Is it? I'd rather walk where footing is sure Than on the thin and perilous bending ice. But as you will: he does not interest me. Doris. That's odd; I think I never met a man So interesting, so fresh, and so mysterious. Don't you like mystery in a man? Ina. I like Truth, Doris, first, and reverence and manhood; And the true man is reverent to all women. But now, adieu. I am not given to preach, And young men, they do say, are not like us, Though why they should not be, I do not know. But Doris, were I you, I'd hold aloof From one who grazes improprieties, And does not blush to make a woman blush. Farewell. Doris. Where are you going, Ina dear? Oh, to Isle-Monach? Yes! 'tis natural You should go often there, and Diarmid too Visits, of course, the graves of all his fathers. Ina. I have been once there, Doris, since I laid My dead in it; and if Sir Diarmid goes Often, I cannot tell. Doris. I fancied you Might have met, now and then, by chance of course, Where there is so much to attract you both— A common feeling of your common kin. But then he is so busy with his friend Whom he admires so warmly, dear. Adieu. [Exeunt. Chorus. Not for a moment distrustful Was she at all of her lover; Yet, as she listened, a shiver, As from a cloud passing over, Chilled her and darkened the glory, Radiant, shining above her. Doris she knew to be cunning, False too, and deft in her malice, Clever at brewing of poisons, Secret, to drop in the chalice; And she had masques, like a player's, Carefully stowed in her valise. No, no, she did not believe her— Yet was the sting there remaining: Oh no! her lover was noble— And yet it was rankling and paining: Who could abide in such friendship, And keep from the taint of its staining? ACT III.— SCENE I. Chorus. Where the ancient sacred Ganges Slowly eats its crumbling bank, Where the brindled tiger ranges Nightly through the jungle rank, Where the hooded cobra sleepeth Dreaming of its victim's pang, And its deadly venom keepeth 'Neath the folded hollow fang, In a city many-towered Was a garden gorgeous-flowered, And a marble-builded mansion Stood upon a terrace high, Overlooking the expansion Of the garden's greenery. There the Eastern sun, combining With the Northern snow, entwining Subtle brain and passion hot With the will that bendeth not, Made a woman strongly daring, Reckless in her self-reliance, Wanton in her world-defiance, Little loving, and all unsparing. Far away now from the sacred stream, And the land that was growing to her like a dream, Beneath the stars of a moon-filled night, The lady sat in a chamber bright, Scented with odours and flooded with light. A cloth of gold for her seat was spread, A leopard's skin at her feet was laid, A jewelled fan was in her hand, And golden filigree in her hair; And all about her was rich and grand, Of ebon and ivory, carved with care, And gorgeous feathers, and carpets rare. Ah! the smiling sacred river Carries death upon its wave, And the slumbrous cobra ever Wiles like the devouring wave, And the brindled tiger ranges Through the darkness for a prey— Tiger, cobra, corpse-laden Ganges, What do ye with a lady gay? Scene—Boudoir in Cairn-Cailleach. Doris and Mairi. Doris. Mairi, you are a fool. If you were quit Of these poor kinsfolk in Glenaradale, Think what you might be. You are very pretty, And lady-like, and have the trick of dressing, And matching colours—you might wed a lord Who did not know the root from which you sprang. Mairi. I do not wish to wed a lord, Miss Doris, I do not wish to hide from whence I came; I am a cottar's daughter, as your father Rose from a like beginning. Doris. There's no need Reminding me of that; but, never mind, After this week I'll hear no more of it. Mairi. But they will hear in heaven, where poor folks' prayers Do fill its courts like incense. Doris. Then you mean To pray for vengeance on the friend who tried To lift you from the mud. Oh, but you are A proper saint. Mairi. Nay, I am not a saint, But, Doris, we might both be better women. Doris. Well, when I pray, for I am more forgiving Than you, I'll pray for you that you may get A better husband than that Kenneth Parlane, Who'll starve you on his rhymes and rebuses, Rehearsing them to clowns in alehouse parlours, Inspired of usquebagh,—meanwhile his wife Will time her poet with a tambourine. Mairi. You do not know him, Doris: but no matter; Why should we part in bitterness? You meant Friendly by me, although your way of life Cannot be mine. “The sea hides much,” they say, And there is much that love will hide away. Doris. E'en as you will. But here's another coming; Adieu! Exit Mairi. Enter Tremain. Tremain. Why, Doris, what a pretty maid You have! But beauty still should wait on beauty. You need no foil; twin stars are doubly bright. Doris. How have we grown so deep familiar, Who scarce have known each other for a week? Tremain. A week! I seem to have known you all my days; The years before, like childhood, are a blank. How did I live then? Doris. Oh, like other babies, Getting your milk-teeth, squalling now and then, Making a noise with spoons, and being petted And spoilt by kissing women. What of Diarmid? Where is he? Tremain. Well; he's busy with affairs; A man of acres he, and beeves and sheep, With tenants, gillies, keepers, and what not? To see to. Doris. Oh! He did not use to be Quite so full-handed. Tremain. Then, he's not in love; And no one cares to look on when a game Is played by others, after he has thrown His own cards up. Doris. He palms me off on you, then, Having no taste for such poor gear himself, Or else another market for his wares! 'Tis very well, Sir Poet. Tremain. Nay, I said not Any rude word like that. Doris. Did you not tell me He had thrown up his cards, and did not care To see you play his game? So you have come To take his cast-off, and relieve his mind Of its perplexity! A gracious office! Sure, gentlemen are most accommodating! And doubtless I am honoured, could I see it, And doubtless you are favoured, when you think on't! People keep poets sometimes—do they not?— For their own uses, as to praise their wares In rhyming advertisement quaintly fancied, Or to relieve the tedium of their greatness. So I have heard. But 'tis a new vocation To take their leavings. Tremain. Ha! a clever shot, And yet a miss. How you do drop on one, As a lithe panther lurking in a tree, Licking his lips, with slowly wagging tail, Might leap down from his branch, and bite the nape Of the stag's neck, while every claw is dug Into the quivering flanks. I like to watch Your eyes at such a time, at first so sleepy With half-closed lids, then flashing out so fierce With sudden lightnings. You have the perfect art Of deadly wounding; yet I am not hurt. Doris. A pachyderm, perhaps, or armadillo Wearing his bones outside. Some people have An armature of vanity as tough As the thick folds of the rhinoceros' hide, And wot not when they are shamed. Tremain. You miss the mark, Though you aim low—or just because you aim So very low. I feel when I am hit Like other men, and may be hit like them; But then my feet are not among the dirt To be hurt there. So you have sped your bolt Wide of the mark. Doris. Oh yes! you are a poet, And fly, of course. It is among the clouds That one must speed an arrow after you. But whether you are singing lark, or gled, Or mousing-owl, who knows? You bring such strange Reports. Tremain. A lark, be sure, the bird of heaven— A lark full-throated up in the blue heavens, That all day singeth to his love below, And only can be silent by her side.— But what reports mean you? Doris. Something you said, Self-satisfied, about a laggard wooer, A gamester who threw up his cards, and left The play to you who gladly took his place; I the poor stake. Tremain. But not his cards I play, Nor yet his game, whate'er it may have been; 'Tis my own luck I try, laying my life Upon that throw. Doris. Just so; he casts me over, And then you take me up; he's done with me, And therefore I am fit for you. Perhaps You like the game: I cannot say I take The humour of it. Tremain. Nay, it is not so. I said he did not love you, which is true; He said you loved him not, which I believed; And so, because the way was clear for me, I said I loved you, which is truest of all: And I will challenge in the tournament Of song all poets in the land to match My Queen of Beauty—or be hushed for ever. Doris. Fine words! But that's your trade. Tremain. Words! If you knew The passion burning in the heart of them, The sense of utter weakness in all words, In paradox and high superlative, To speak the thoughts that swell and surge in me! Listen a moment, Doris. When I came Hither to gather pictures and sensations Among the mountains, and beside the sea, And from dim caves, and from the whish of pines, And lingering mists, and from the setting suns, That I might write a book which should entrance A brain-fagged world, then I was studying words To trade on them. But having lighted on My Helena, my Fate, I heed no more The hills, the lochs, the caves, the forest trees, Or trailing mists, or glory of the sunsets, Or curious felicities of speech, Or swing of rhythmic phrase, or anything But just to love thee, and to win thy love. Doris. There; that's enough; I half believe you, though I fear I should not even half believe. I think you love me just a little. Tremain. Doris, A little! I am all, and over all, Within, without, in heart and brain, afire With a consuming passion which no sea Could quench, but it would make its waves to boil Though they were ribbed with ice. Doris. You've studied well The art, at least, how one should play with hearts. Yet if I were to prove your love with some More simple test than boiling seas of ice, It would not much amaze me though it failed. Tremain. Nay, put me to the proof; and if my life— Doris. Pray, let your life alone; men wager that Most freely, when they least intend to pay. But if you cared to pleasure me, you could, And I could love the man who pleasured me As I would have him. Tremain. Only tell me how, And if a heart's devotion, and a will Resolved, and some small skill of nice invention To frame such dainty plots as poets use To work out fates with, can accomplish it, Count it already done. Doris. I hardly know How I should put it. There's a girl you know, At least you've seen her—Ina at the manse: I hate her. Temain. Well, then, I will hate her too. Doris. Nay, that is not my meaning. Tremain. Then I'll love her, If that is what you will. Doris. Oh yes, your love, Like a small seedling, having little root, May readily be plucked up from the soil, And planted elsewhere. Let's to something else: No more of this. I had forgot she is your Pallas-Athene. Tremain. What, an if she be? Pallas-Athene is not Aphrodite, And it is Love and Beauty I adore, Which I find perfect here. What would you with her? Doris. She's in my way, was always in my way, Balked me when we were children, baffled me In every purpose that I set my heart on, And brought out all the worst in me, until He hated me, who should have loved me best. Tremain. Ah! well; 'tis clear why you should like her ill, But not so clear how I can meddle. Would you That I should carry off a rival beauty, And leave you a clear field to win your lover, Breaking my own heart with a frustrate hope? That is a test of love's unselfishness Love never claimed before. Doris. And does not now. The man is nought to me, and never was Even then before that I had met with you Who say you love me. Tremain. Yet you hint that she Is in your way. Doris. Well; what if I would be Revenged upon the gamester who has scorned me, And she comes in between me and my wrath? May I not spite him where he most would feel Cut to the quick? But there; no more of this. You'd give your life for me, of course; but when I ask a trifle, you are scrupulous. Let it alone. Trmain. What would you have me do? Doris. Oh, nothing. I am not so poor in friends That I must beg of strangers. Tremain. Am I then Become a stranger to you? Say, what would you? I must not hate her—that is not your meaning; I must not love her—that is less your drift; But she is in your way—yet not in love's way: How may I construe this, and do your will? Am I to tie the offending Beauty, as In Stamboul, in a sack, and sink her deep Some evening in the silence and the darkness Of the mid loch? Or shall I go in search Of the lost art of Medicean poison, And with a kerchief or a pair of gloves, Subtly envenomed, so assail her life That straightway she shall pine away and die? These ways are out of date. Besides they bring Vulgar detective fellows, worse than slot-hounds, About one's heels. Doris. Prithee, have done with this: I might have known that you would trifle with me. She said you were a coxcomb. Tremain. By the heavens, And all the gods of Hellas, never was A heart more seriously inclined to serve you Than mine is, if I only knew the way. Doris. May I believe you? Tremain. Is there any oath Will carry strong assurance? I will swear it. Doris. Oh yes; and break it. Oaths of any kind Sit easy on the soul that easy takes them: There is no traitor like your ready swearer Clothed in the tatters of forgotten vows. Tremain. Nay, I will keep it. I am in your toils, And you shall lead me like a meek, tame creature Whither you will. Doris. I fancied that a woman, Having a lover faithful and devoted, Had but to will, and he would find the way, His the invention, hers but to desire.— I've heard indeed of men who with fair speech Have plied a maiden's heart, and mischief came on't, But hush! there's some one coming. Enter Factor. Factor. Good-evening, lady. I am not marring better company? May I come in? Doris. Yes, certainly. But what Brings you again to-day? Factor. Well, I have heard That these Glenara folk will have a grand Function of their religion there next Sabbath, A Holy Fair, a big communion-day, And there will be hot words, they say. Doris. Can't you Prevent them? Factor. That's not easy, if they come In thousands as their custom is, and get The drink once in their heads. Doris. But you can stop Newspaper men from sending false reports About the country. Factor. Yes, yes; I can do All the reporting they are like to get, And more than they would wish. But you might give me The gillies, and authority from you To warn them off the ground with threats of law If they refuse. They do not like the Law, Nor does the Law like them. Doris. By all means do Whate'er may stop these dangerous gatherings. Factor. Thanks; I will see to't. By the way, I met Your pretty cousin in a pretty plight. Doris. How mean you? She was here a little ago, Handsome as ever. Factor. Well, she's on the way now Across the hills, and Kenneth Parlane with her, Dressed in the rags she wore when she came here, Barefoot, bareheaded, with her snooded hair, And the small bundle in the hand-kerchief That held her comb, her mother's wedding ring, Her Bible and Kenneth's letters, prose and verse. Doris. Oh! she's a fool; and it was like a fool To think that I could take her from the byre Into the drawing-room. But let her go. Factor. I have your full authority, then, to act. Doris. Surely. But run no risk of rioting. Factor. Oh! never fear. [Exit Factor. Doris. And now you would not mind Walking across the hill, perhaps, on Sunday? You'll have rare fun, and you could serve me too. I have been moving some of my poor tenants From wretched crofts to settle by the sea, Where they can fish, and better their estate, And better, too, my rents by foresting Their ill-tilled, scanty fields. They do not like it, And I would fain know what is said and done About it at this preaching. The factor will Report, of course, but your account would be More picturesque—perhaps a trifle truer. Tremain. Certainly, I will go. Doris. Till then, adieu. You will think over what I said to you? Chorus. Cat-like, purring and mewling, and softest rubbing of fur, With just a pat of the claw, now and then, for a needed spur, Touching the quick of his vanity, making him keen to go Whithersoever she would, though whither he did not know, Seeming to answer love with love, though her heart was cool, And the clear-working brain was practising as on a fool, So she played with her victim, who thought he was playing with her, For there was not a heart between them to master or minister. Clever he might be, yet would she wind him around her thumb, Reason soon to be blinded, conscience soon to be dumb; For when a woman is good, she doth to all good inspire, But being evil, alas! she burns up the soul like fire. Rouse thee, man, for an effort; what though her speech be smooth, What though she smile too upon thee in splendour of beauty and youth, There is no pity in her; look at her hard, cold eye; You she will use for her tool now, and mock with her scorn by and by. SCENE II. Chorus. Our fates are linked together, high and low, Like ravelled, knotted thrums of various thread, Homespun and silk, yellow and green and red, And no one is alone, nor do we know From what mean sources great events may flow: The tramp that lays him down among the straw, Despised, perchance shall fill your home with awe, Plague-stricken, or from him its peace may grow; The ruined peasant's cot may down-ward draw The stately hall that neighbours it. We are All members of one body, and a flaw Or lesion here, the perfect whole shall mar. Therefore let justice rule, and love inspire; Wise for thyself, the weal of all desire. Scene—The Manse. Ina and Morag. Morag. Please, Ina, may I have your leave to go Away for these two days? Ina. Yes, surely, go; I shall do nicely. Morag. That is very well. Ina. You do not seem to think so. “Very well” Sounds e'en like very bad, so drily spoken. Morag. If you are happy, it is very well. Ina. Indeed I am. Morag. But it is sudden—yes! Yet maybe it will last. Ina. Oh, never fear; 'Twill last at any rate till you come back. I have my books, my music, and to-morrow There is the church. Of course I'll miss you, yet I promise to be blithe as any bird. Morag. Oh, very well. Ina. What ails you, Morag? Would you Rather that I should sit me down and mope? You scolded me of late for being sad; Are you displeased to see me cheerful now, Blaming alike the sunshine and the cloud? Morag. I see the gulls and pellocks in the loch Busy and merry, and all the boats are out Letting the nets down, and the wives are watching Upon the shore, and talking loud with glee: And why? Because they see the herring come Poppling the shining water with their fins, As if a shower were driving up, although The sky is blue and clear. Ina. I'm glad of that; The poor will now have bread; it is good news. But what has that to do with us? Morag. They have A reason for their happiness. Ina. Oh, that's it; You want to know the reason now of mine. But, Morag, girls are not so rational As gulls and pellocks. Have you never felt Inexplicable sadness overcome you, Though earth and heaven and all around you were Filled full of light and song? Why should not joy too Come whence you cannot tell, nor for what reason, But just that wells are springing in your heart, Whose waters lapse, and ripple as they lapse? Morag. Yes, maybe. Only you were changed that day You visited Isle-Monach and his grave; And was it there you found the well of gladness? Ina. You are too curious, prying into what Concerns you not. Enough. There; you may go. I do not ask you why you wish to go, Or where you mean to go. Morag. You ought to ask, then. A mistress should not let her servants wander Like hens or ducks at large. Ina. Nor servants let Their mistress go her own way, without giving Full explanation. Is it not so, Morag? But whether I am mistress here or you— Which may be doubtful—I can wholly trust you. Morag. Ina, there was a time when you would take An interest in us all, and all our doings, Our comings and our goings and our folk, The crofters and the cottars and the fishers, For they belonged to you, and you to them, Parts of a common life, you said. Ina. Ay, then I was a fool, and thought to shape your lives, Who could not guide my own, like some poor trader Who, being bankrupt in his own estate, Is fain to take the helm, and guide affairs For all his neighbours. Do you wish to tell me About your journey? I've no right to ask, Yet less right not to hear you. Morag. But you should Know all your servants' doings, for it spoils them Unless they have authority on them; And better a bad mistress in a house Than let the maids go gadding as they will.— But for this business calling me away, Do you not know, Miss, that tomorrow is The great Communion at Glenaradale, And all the country will be there, and half The godly ministers of Ross and Skye? Oh, it will be a great time. Ina. Well, I hope You will enjoy it, Morag. Morag. No, I do not Know that I will enjoy it. You enjoy The bread you eat yourself, but not the bread That others eat, and which is not for you: The hungry is not happy when he sees A sumptuous table spread, and he outside. I do not hope to enjoy; yet I may get Share of the crumbs that fall for dogs to eat. Ina. Oh, I forgot. My father always thought, Morag, that you were wrong there, keeping back From that which yet you hungered for. Morag. It's likely That he knows better now, and would not be So loose, if he came back again from heaven, As then when he came from the lowland folk Whose kirk is like a market, free to all. Ina. That suits me best; I think I dare not go Except where all alike are free to go. Morag. Well, you are free, and it would do you good To hear the sound of psalms among the hills When many thousand voices join, and yet 'Tis like a small child's cry unto the heavens, Or tinkling of a little brook. Ina. I know; That must be fine indeed. Morag. And then the preacher Tells the glad tidings to the poor; at first, Just like an auction at a country fair, Offering his ware so high that none may bid For that whose price is costlier than rubies; But in the end the treasure which no wealth Of man could buy is proffered with-out money And without price. Ina. That's as it ought to be: But I shall hear the same free gospel here From him who soon will be our pastor. Morag. Him! It's a thin gospel that you'll get from him. I bought a pencil one day from the packman, And I was fain to put a fine point on it, But ever as I cut, the lead would break, Just when I had it nearly right; and so I went on whittling, and it broke and broke, Till there was nought left but a bit of stick, And it was sharp enough. Belike, yon lad Is whittling down his faith too, like my pencil To make a fine point on it, till it be Only a stump of wood. Then he must read too His sermons from a paper! Och! to think Of having music-notes for collie dogs To bark at sheep with! But the faithful dog Can do without a paper. If you heard Black Eachan of Lochbroom! Ina. And what of him? Morag. He's called “The Searcher”; he has no fine points; But well he knows the doubling and deceit Of hearts that are like foxes for their wiles; And does not pore upon the paper, fearful To lose his place, but has his eye on you Always, and follows up your very thoughts Into their holes and secret hiding-places, And hunts you from all coverts, till you lie Low at his feet, and feel that you are lost. Ina. I do not envy him. Why should he drive Folk to despair? Morag. He says that to despair Is to have one foot on the threshold, truly, And finger on the latch. 'Tis very good For sinners to despair a while. Ina. My father Sought to bring hope and comfort to them. Morag. Yes! And there was no great work here in his day. Ina. But there was some good work. At any rate I care not for your “Searcher.” Morag. But when he Has done with you, and you are groaning, maybe, Over your sins, then Lachlan of the Lews— “The Trumpet of the Gael”—will take you up, And like a prophet speak the word of power, That stirs despairing hearts. He does not water The gospel with book-learning; he lets God Speak for Himself in texts and promises, Like the great word that said to Lazarus, “Come forth,” and he arose. Ina. If there were prophet Could move one so! But no, it cannot be. 'Tis vain to hope for the old faith again That shone about our childhood. Morag. Do not doubt But one of them would have a word for you. For after these comes Neil of Raasay, maybe; He has a pleasant voice, as if he played Sweetly upon an instrument, to tell About the golden streets, and gates of pearl, And walls of emerald and amethyst And topaz, and the river and tree of life, As if the birds of God had left its boughs, And come to earth to sing about their glory. Ina. Why, Morag, you are grown poetical O'er Neil of Raasay. Yet you did not seem To care much for him, when he came at times To help my father here. Morag. He never seemed Himself when he came here. Your father was Too critical, with commentary books That suck the marrow from the bones of truth, And leave them dry. And in a pibroch you Must have the muster first, and then the fight, And then the wail, and then the song of triumph: Nor shall you understand the several parts Without the others: so it is with him; You must have Eachan first, and Lachlan next, And then your heart will glow to Neil of Raasay. Ina. May be; and yet I think I'll stay at home. I am not in the mood for strong excitements: You'll tell me all about it. Morag. Yes, I'll bring A true account home of the last great Feast Held in Glenaradale. Ina. Nay, not the last. They have been there a century at least, And may hold on another, if there's faith Still in the land, or maybe if there's none: Such customs linger when the life is gone. Morag. Have you not heard? The country's ringing with it. Ina. Ringing with what? What is there next to hear? Morag. Only that Doris has evicted all The people from their houses, which even now Are empty, bare, and roofless. She would crowd them Upon the strip of shore already thronged With fishers, and they mean to go away. They have been used to tend, and handle sheep And cattle, and they have no skill with boats; And now they are just waiting for to-morrow, Housed on the beach, or in the birken wood, With breaking hearts, before they leave the land. Ina. What say you? Doris root them from the soil Where they have grown like native heath or bracken! And they her kinsfolk! Morag. Ay, but near of kin May be too near in place for upstart pride. I've heard some say we are all sprung from apes, And maybe that's the reason they disgust us More than a dog or cat. At any rate, Glenara is a desert now for deer. Ina. Cruel and heartless! and yet only like her. Why told you not this story to me first, Instead of maundering on about the preachings? What care I for your “Searchers” and your “Trumpets,” And old Neil Raasay droning about heaven After his whisky? But these crofter folk In green Glenaradale—they touch my heart. Yes, I will go with you; I will get ready I' the instant: they shall know they have one friend Who shares their grief and wrath. Morag. But, Ina, think; It is a twenty miles across the hills Through moor and moss. Ina. And if it be so, think you I could not do't like other Highland girls In such a cause? They fought for Charlie once, Misled by a belated sentiment, And by their trust in those who should have wisely Led them, and only brought them into sorrow: But who will fight for them now? were I only A man, at least I'd let my voice be heard For their poor right of living on the land. Morag. No, Ina, no; it must not be. Ina. What must not? I may go to the preaching if I will, But not to visit the oppressed and poor! That's not it? Oh, it is the twenty miles? Well, I could do it, for my heart is high, And on the moors among the springy turf One does not weary as on dusty roads. But there's no need of walking. How's the wind? My boat will bring us cleverly along To Kinloch-Aradale, within a mile Of Corrie-an-Liadh. We shall do it nicely. O Morag, only think of the old men With their long memories clinging to the soil, And babes and mothers on that homeless shore! I would not bear their curses for the wealth Of all the world. Morag. They will not curse. But it Is true, you say; the wind is fair; the boat Will bear us bravely to Glenaradale. Chorus. Trimly speeds the dainty boat Swinging o'er the foam-tipped billow, Where the keen-eyed sea-mews float Sleeping on their watery pillow, Past the low black Cormorant's Rock, Where they crowd in hungry numbers; There a great grey heron woke, Sudden, from its noon-day slumbers, And beyond, the threshers rose High above where the whale had sickened, Well could you hear their crashing blows, As its labouring breath was quickened: Till rounding the red headland now, The boat leapt out in the open sea, With a ripple of laughter at her prow, And a rush of bubbles upon her lea. The wind fell low as the sun went down, And every cloud had a golden crown, A jewelled belt, and a crimson gown; And every corrie, and rock, and hill, Was veiled in pink or in purple, till The glory was quenched in the gloaming still. It was the dusk of a sultry night When Kinloch-Aradale rose in sight, And on the beach there were fires alight— Fires alight, and to and fro Forms among them moving slow, And on the breeze was a wailing low. Kenneth's Song. There is no fire of the crackling boughs On the hearth of our fathers, There is no lowing of brown-eyed cows On the green meadows, Nor do the maidens whisper vows In the still gloaming, Glenaradale. There is no bleating of sheep on the hill Where the mists linger, There is no sound of the low hand-mill Ground by the women, And the smith's hammer is lying still, By the brown anvil, Glenaradale. Ah! we must leave thee, and go away Far from Ben Luibh, Far from the graves where we hoped to lay Our bones with our fathers, Far from the kirk where we used to pray Lowly together, Glenaradale. We are not going for hunger of wealth, For the gold and silver, We are not going to seek for health On the flat prairies, Nor yet for lack of fruitful tilth On thy green pastures, Glenaradale. Content with the croft and the hill were we, As all our fathers, Content with the fish in the lake to be Carefully netted, And garments spun of the wool from thee, O black-faced wether Of Glenaradale. No father here but would give a son For the old country, And his mother the sword would have girded on To fight her battles; Many's the battle that has been won By the brave tartans, Glenaradale. But the big-horned stag and his hinds, we know, In the high corries, And the salmon that swirls the pool below Where the stream rushes, Are more than the hearts of men, and so We leave thy green valley, Glenaradale. SCENE III. Chorus. Near to the stormy loch, behind The ridge of the Badger's Rock, there lay A broad green corrie; and there the wind Was hardly felt on a wild March day, It was so girdled with hill and rock That rarely a storm on its stillness broke. Only the wild deer make their lair Among the moss and the bracken there, Or the stealthy fox, or the glede and kite, Or the blue hare and ptarmigan on the height. Slowly the mountain shadows creep Across the hollows, across the brook; And to the right in the rugged steep Is a narrow gap where you can look Right down on the glimmering loch that clings To the roots of The Hill of a Hundred Springs. But it is not the red deer that haunt to-day Corrie-an-Liadh, and crowd the brae, Here in groups, and there in tiers, Till hardly a patch of stone or heather, Hardly a green bracken leaf like a feather, Through the close-packed ranks of the throng appears. It is men and women, the young and the old, Some with their snowy locks, some their gold, Matron or maiden, with cap or snood, And stalwart sire with his strong-limbed brood— Men of Glenara with heads bowed low, Men of Loch Thorar with hearts aglow, Men of Glen Turret, Glen Shelloch, Glen Shiel, And lads from the Isles which the mists conceal. Right at the mouth of that mountain bay There is a mound of swelling green Whereon the golden sunbeams play, And daisy and pansy flowers are seen, And close beside it a trickling spring Circled with moss and draped with ling. There once they offered sacrifice, Bringing their sick to the healing well, And the kid of a goat for a ransom price To the Spirit that bound and loosed the spell. There now a table is seemly spread With homely linen, but clean and white, And a chalice and platter with wheaten bread, And the Book that giveth the blind their sight; And the sun shines down, who had seen before Far other rites in the days of yore. Pastors four on the swelling mound Sit, rapt, as if on holy ground— One with a great black shock of hair, One with a smiling face and fair, One that was pale, and lean, and young, With a fire in his heart and a flame on his tongue, One the old pastor of the Gael Driven out of the green Glenaradale, With grey locks streaming around a face That beamed with a light of tender grace. Another group behind them lay Stretched, careless, out on the short hill grass; They were not there to praise or pray, But jest and gibe they were fain to pass, And kept apart from all the rest, And not in Sabbath raiment drest;— The factor, with gillies, and dogs, and whips, And the poet with heathendom on his lips. They came from walking to and fro Upon the earth, as long ago One came with the sons of God, we know. Scene—Corrie-an-Liadh. Throng of people seated on bank: Ina, Morag, Kenneth, and Mairi in front of Factor, Tremain, and others behind the Ministers. A “Man” (Passing the Factor). Is Saul among the prophets? Factor. Why not, Dugald? Saul found them singing in the dance, And joined the sport, of course. “Man.” This is no day for sport. Factor. Oh, that depends: I've known some queer folk now Whose acid looks would sour the cream on Monday, Yet make rare fun with sermons on the Sunday. “Man.” You are a flippant person; but your day Will not be long, though God may wink awhile. Factor. I'll take my chance. The wink may grow a nap As you pray, Dugald. Few can stand that long. “Man.” Blasphemer! [Passes on to his seat. Factor. Hypocrite! Tremain. Nay, hold your peace; I like not these men's looks: they're stern and grim, And knit their brows in silence, and their knuckles Are white, see, as they clench their great brown fists. Factor. Nay, never fear, sir. Don't I know them well? The law is powerful; not a man of them Dare wag his tongue at me. Tremain. They're in the mood For more than wagging tongues. And for the law, What if they have the right on't? Factor. Let them break The peace, and then they will be in the wrong. I'll keep safe with the law. Lads, give the dogs A nip, and set them howling, when you hear The minister begin to clear his throat. Tremain. Why do you that? Factor. 'Twill be as good a joke As bumming of an organ in their ears, Or tuning of a fiddle for the psalm. Tremain. I pray you, stop. See you not every man Grasping his staff? There is a thousand there For one of us. Factor. So be it. They would tell you “The Lord can work by many or by few.” You do not fear that rabble? Tremain. Yes, I do. Somehow the big battalions always win, And one may doubt if God is on our side. Let them alone. The people sing, to a Celtic tune, “I to the hills will lift mine eyes, From whence doth come mine aid. My safety cometh from the Lord, Who heav'n and earth hath made.” Tremain. 'Tis a pathetic strain In a barbaric minor, long drawn out; So the Greek chorus might be sung, when they Played a fate-drama in their sacred feasts. Hush! stop that yelping. There will be cracked crowns If this go on.—But what proud pallid face Is that among them? Oh, my stately Beauty, Pallas-Athene of the waterfall, And Doris' pet aversion, whom I have To strangle, drown, or poison—anything But love. I think I'll throw me at her feet. It is a face to dream on; safer there Than here, too, and the seats are not reserved. [Crosses to Ina, and lies down on the grass. Factor. White-livered fool! But let him go. What's this The minister is after? Make a speech Without a text! Who ever heard the like? And what's come of the prayer? Be ready, lads. Minister. My friends, this is a day of solemn sadness With us, for we shall ne'er all meet again Here where our fathers met these hundred years, Remembering the love of Him who came, In power of sorrow, to redeem from sorrow, And sin which is its fountain. It is not That sere and withered leaves shall drop in autumn;— That always will be: nor that tender buds, Frost-bitten, die untimely in their spring: Nor that the hale and well may also fall, Reft by the stormy winds;—all that may be To any people, and at any time: To-morrow only knows what it shall bring. But human law, defying the divine, Which gave the land for man to dwell therein, And to replenish and subdue its wildness, Straining the rights of those who own the soil By writs and deeds, wherein they gave it over Who had no property in it to give, Has torn up by the roots a band of you, Loyal and dutiful and fearing God As any in the land; and nevermore Shall we together sing our psalm of praise here, Or break the bread, or drink the cup of blessing. Therefore is this a solemn day with us, Touched with the sadness of their leave-taking, And with regretful memories. Factor. Take care, sir, You're on the verge of treasonable speech Against the law. Minister. We do not break the law, Even when it breaks the hearts that it should bind Closer to home and country. Neither would I Pour Mara water now into the cup Heaven sweetened with the wood of His dear cross, Who loved us. Men may wreck your happy homes, But God is building better mansions for you. They make a desert—He a paradise; They drive you over sea, but He will bring you Where there is no more sea. And we should take The losses and the crosses of our life As hooks to fasten us to that better world. Factor. Ay, that is right. They'll find a better world In Canada; you hook them on to that. Minister. Be silent, sir. I will not speak of her Whose high imperious order drives you forth, Homeless— Factor. Nor will I hear a generous lady, Who is too good a landlord for such people, So shamefully abused. I tell you, sir, This is mere cant, fanatic and illegal, Stirring ill blood in those who know no better By those who should know better. Minister. Pray you, sir, Have patience; I have spoken nought amiss; Do not disturb our worship. Factor. Worship! call ye't? You preach against the law and call that worship! Against the landlord, and that's worship too! I will not hold my peace. You people, hear! Go to your homes, or to your parish kirks, Or it will be the worse for you. This place Is not for people to denounce the law, Or landlords in their legal rights. The Book Will have you to obey the Powers that be, And speak no evil of them. There is clear Chapter and verse for that. A pretty worship! Minister. Take heed, sir, what you do. You have no law For this. Factor. Away! I tell you, or I'll set The dogs upon you. A “Man.” Och! ochone! and is The Lord, too, banished from Glenaradale To Canada? Another “Man.” Ochone! will it be Baal Or Moloch that the factor will be having On the high places to pollute the land? Another “Man.” It is a day of darkness and dismay, A day of wrath for broken covenants, And for dishonoured Sabbaths. Minister. Sir, I warn you The people now look dangerous. Be quiet, Or leave us: do not drive them mad. Factor. Away! Ye are trespassers, and I know you well! I will have writs out on you by to-morrow. A “Man.” Now, who will come with me to help the Lord Against the factor? A Fisherman. That will I do, Dugald. A Crofter. Yes, and it iss not you will be alone. Away with him! He tore my shieling down, And Ailie's babe just born. Another Crofter. And he insulted The minister! Yes, it iss fery well! There iss the Tod's Hole yonder, and the Loch Iss deep below it. Crowd (rushing forward). To the Tod's Hole with him! Minister. Nay, hear me, O my people, I entreat you; Do not this crime, for Christ's sake, Will ye not Listen a moment! O my God, that men Should do foul murder! On the Sabbath, too! Stay, stay, I tell you. Heaven have mercy on him, For they are deaf as adders. Ina (rising up). Morag, this Is frightful. Kenneth, can you not do aught To help him? See, they drag the wretched man Struggling, entreating, cursing, praying, while They move in stern grim silence to the gap In the black ragged rock, that looks right down Into the Otter's Hole. [To Tremain.] Can you look on, sir, And see your comrade murdered? You came with him To find your sport, and lo! he finds a death, Too horrible, instead. Tremain. What can I do? They will not hear the parson plead in Gaelic, How should they heed me with my English tongue? Indeed, I tried to stop him, but in vain. Think you that, if I sung an Orphic song, Mellifluous, melodious, as e'er Hushed Philomela, shamed of her sweet strain, These grim and silent executioners Of Nature's law would listen? Truly I would Do anything, fair lady, for your grace. And yet, to see your pity and your terror So tragically moved and beautiful, I'd almost let him fall from cutting ledge To jutting crag into the hungry loch. Ina. Tush! Morag. Well, this man is madder than a foumart, He would kill folk to see how one might look. Tremain. Nay, not how you would look; there is no grand Pathetic grace in you. Ina. Now, who is that Standing upon the sharp edge of the rock At the Tod's Hole. Ah! Diarmid. All is well. Sir Diarmid. Go back, now, lads, and hear the minister; Vengeance belongs to God. You would not stain Your hands with blood from such a puddle as this. A “Man.” Out of our way, Sir Diarmid; we have no Quarrel with you, but this man's cup iss full. Sir Diarmid. I will not budge an inch, and you must kill me Before you break a bone of him; and that You would be loath to do. There; you have given The scamp a fright he will not soon forget; That's all you meant, and he deserved it well, Bully and coward! Kenneth. Yes, the Chief is right; Let him go now. I'll make a ballad of His teeth that chattered like a castanet. “A Man.” He hass been like an iron flail with teeth To all the folk, sir; but it iss your will. Sir Diarmid. Yes; ere he go, then, let him have a shake Such as your terriers give an ugly rat, And then have done with him. You would not make This day a day of horror and reproach For such a cur as that. So: that is right. [They let him go. I do not wonder that your hearts were hot. Minister. Now, God be praised, who brought you here, Sir Diarmid, Ere that was done which never could be undone, And put the heart in you, and gave you power Over the people's hearts to move them, like An instrument of music, at your will. I marvel not that they were wroth at him; The man is of an evil nature, hard And insolent and cruel to the poor, And servile to the great, and knowing law Only to strain its power, and make it hateful. Tremain (coming up). There, parson, now your Deus did not come In a cloud-chariot driven by mighty angels, But riding on a nag, a simple laird. Minister. Be not profane, sir; and for you, my people, Ye have been saved from doing greater wrong, But wrong ye have done; and how shall we sing The Lord's song, with the swell of that late storm Still rolling in our hearts? Let us go back, And humble us, confessing all the sin. [Return to their seats. Tremain. Diarmid, the factor now will hate you almost As much as he will hate this pious mob. You saved his life, 'tis true, but only saved it By showing him a thing to scorn and loathe; You should have had more tact. He'll not forget it. Sir Diarmid. What care I for his hatred or his love? But how came you, of all men, to be here Of all scenes on this earth? Tremain. Why should I not Enrich my soul with all experiences Of life and passion, to be moulded duly Into pure forms of art? I came to see The Christian superstition where I heard The thing was really living. Up in town 'Tis but a raree-show of surplices And albs and copes and silver candlesticks And droning repetitions; poor survivals Of the old Pagan cult: or else it is A small dissenting shop where they retail Long yards of worn-out logic, or an ounce Of bitter morals, with a syllabub Of sentiment. But this is different. I could have almost fancied I was back With Cyril in the Alexandrian desert, And throngs of howling unwashed monks who hunted A Neo-Platonist: only yon factor Is no philosopher. Sir Diarmid. Came you not with him? Tremain. Well, yes; he promised I should have some sport; And there was Doris' tenantry to see to. Sir Diarmid. Are you so close confederates already? Tremain. We've but one thought, one aim, one life between us. And such a life! She is a glorious galley. Freighted with gold and gems, and silks and spices, And all the treasures of the fabled East, And at a word she struck to me. Sir Diarmid. That's well; You poets are the men to win your way Into a maiden's heart by flattery. Now, you must go and see the factor home; His bones are stiff, I fancy. Tremain. Nay, there is A lady in the crowd—Pallas-Athene— She sought mine aid, and I must go to her. Sir Diarmid. Leave her to me; you must see to your friend. Doris would scarcely care to think you left Her factor for a stranger damosel. Tremain. Doris must learn to put up with a heart That loves all beauty, and has room for all. I must go back to her. Sir Diarmid. Be off, I tell you, Unless you'd rather I should hurl you down, 'Stead o'the factor, from the Tod's Hole yonder. [Exit Tremain. The jackanapes! Yet, if he speaks the truth, I am near happiness. Now for Ina. [Goes towards her. Ina. Diarmid! Sir Diarmid. Come with me, Ina; let me take you hence; This scene has been too much for you. Ina. Ah! yes; I know not if your courage, or my fears Shook me the most. It was a daring thing To stand up in the breach, and brave their fury. Sir Diarmid. Nonsense; I knew they would not harm a hair Of my head, more than sheep would fly upon The dog that herds them; and you do not call The collie quite a hero. Ina. Do not leave me, Diarmid. I know 'tis silly, but I feel So weak and trembling. Morag. Ina, you're not going, Just when they've got all ready for the work Of this great day. Sir Diarmid. Yes, Morag, she must go. Do you not see her shaking like a leaf? Morag. Black Eachan's giving out a psalm. They'll think It strange if we should leave now. Sir Diarmid. Never mind; There, Ina, lean on me; my arm is strong, [Move off. And my heart lighter than it has been lately, For there were troubles that did threat our love. Ina. Yes, I could see that something was amiss, Something that made you moody and reserved, Though you were only gentler, dear, with me. Sir Diarmid. And yet you never asked me what was wrong. Ina. I knew you would have told me if I ought To know; and though I longed to share it with you, I held my peace till you should speak. It is not For love to be too curious, but to trust. Sir Diarmid. And for that trust I thank you. More than once It was upon my tongue to tell you all, And leave it to your heart—for it is wise— To say what I should do. But then I thought It would be mean to shift my burden off And lay it upon you. Now it grows clear, However, and a day or two will end it. Trust me till then, and then I'll never leave you, Till life leaves me. But there's the boat all trim, And a brisk breeze will take us swiftly home. Chorus. Oh that sail on the summer sea! Can she ever forget its gladness? Yet oh the haunting memory Of those bright hours, when they came to be The wistfullest sigh of the day of sadness! ACT IV. SCENE I. Chorus. Close by a lake, beneath a long-backed hill A lodge stood new and bare; Larch and spruce had been planted there, But they were still Only like tufts of grass upon the long-backed hill. There, by no care oppressed, The wanderer now found rest Who had seen many cities, many men, And many perils known, And many a die had thrown With risk of all his living now and then. Skimming the surface lightly and alone Gaily he took what pleasure might be got; No higher life the stirring West had shown, The brooding East called forth no deeper thought. Yet could he shrewdly use his wits, And had his cautious, prudent fits, His memories also and regrets That touched his heart with lights from heaven, Though he sat easy under debts Of duty, that had surely driven To their wits' end respectable good folk Who went to church, and no commandment broke. Scene—Glen Chroan Lodge. Dr. Lorne and Chundra, his servant. Chundra. The Begum, sahib! I have seen her. Dr. Lorne. Tush! We have no Begums here. Chundra. I saw her—her! Dr. Lorne. Why, man, she has been dead these ten years past, And more. Chundra. Yes, sahib, dead ten years; and yet I saw her, and she smiled; and then I said What devilry is brewing? Dr. Lorne. I never knew Of any ghost that had been ten years dead, And yet came smiling back. They lose their smile, Chundra, exactly in the seventh year, And it returns no more, because they have not Lips, cheeks, or eyes to smile with, though the teeth Grin horribly. But, now, I'm rather busy; I'll hear you by and by. I am expecting A visitor on matters of great moment: You'll show him in, and see that no one enters While he is here. Have tiffin ready, too, On the instant notice, mind. Chundra. Yes, Doctor sahib. [Exit Servant. Dr. Lorne. I partly guess what Begum he has seen; She's like her mother, doubtless. Well, I've got A pill to purge her devilry, if she Is at the old one's tricks. Chundra. Sir Bennett, sahib. Enter Bennett. Dr. Lorne. Good-morning, Bennett. Had a pleasant journey? Bennett. So so; your nags are good enough, but then Your roads are something perpendicular, And what with ruts and rocks they make hard driving. Dr. Lorne. There; how you lawyers grumble! If you knew The roads I've gone by dâk! And for your climb, You got the better view of scenery Thought to be well worth seeing. But now, Bennett, Our Highland air is reckoned hungry air; Shall you bait first, or work? Bennett. Let us to business; It spoils alike the dinner and digestion To have work hanging o'er you, like the skull At the old feasts. Dr. Lorne. So be it, then; and yet I fear your patience may be tried beyond Endurance of your appetite. You know Old travellers claim the right to be long-winded. Bennett. I can recruit me at the sideboard there, If you abuse your privilege. Dr. Lorne. All right. And so now to my tale. You know my brother, The Parson, Ronald; we were twins, alike In form and feature, but in mind—Ah! well; He was the family saint, and I the pickle From childhood. So he took to healing souls, And I to doctoring people's pains and aches And indigestions—he for love of souls, And I for love of fees. I did my work, As others did, by rule; went feeling pulses, Looking at tongues, and writing out prescriptions With a good conscience, and a look of wisdom. I knew the does was dropt into the dark, But it was what our high tradition ordered. Sometimes it cured, but how, I could not tell; Sometimes it failed, and why I did not know: God orders all; except He build the house They labour in vain that build it. So I took My fee, and silently allowed the vis Naturæ medicatrix, and the mors That beats with equal foot at every door. Bennett. Quite right; what other could you do? Dr. Lorne. Even so It seemed. And yet, if Nature worked the cure, Nature should have the fee too; and besides My conscience got entangled with new science That would have no empiric, no haphazard; And I must go but where it showed the way— And oh, it had so little way to show: So I lost faith in all our Therapeutic. Bennett. Queer, now: I had a parson with me lately Wanting to strip his gown off. He had dropt, Bit by bit, all old formulas of faith, And buried all his gods, he said, and saw No difference in his flock who came to church, And said their prayers, and hardly pricked their ears At any fresh negation; traded, feasted, And gossipped as before—nor worse nor better, A moral class of pure respectables. But he opined his life would be a lie If he went on. Dr. Lorne. And surely so it had been. What counsel gave you him? Bennett. Bade him go home, And write his sermon, said I envied him Having so clear a case, so plain a brief, Authority so full, and absolute law To preach the gospel. But the fellow went And took to writing novels—he is lost. Yet it is odd that ministers and doctors Should be so sceptic in their own affairs: You'll never find a lawyer acting so. I have my doubts, like other folk, but keep them Clear of my business. Dr. Lorne. Some have doubts of it. Bennett. Ay, but they're laymen. Dr. Lorne. Lucky you that can Doubt every thing, except that law is right, And bide unmoved when all around is shifting.— But to my story: like your parson, I Flung up my craft, but did not take to writing, Having no knack that way; and though I had— No faith in physic, I had faith enough In my own luck. Therefore I went abroad, And drifted round the world, now up, now down, Making a fortune one day, losing it Another, now in rags among the miners, Then swaggering from a “hell” where the croupiers Hated the sight of me. A pretty game Life is now, if you only have the pluck To brave the worst it can do. Bennett. Maybe so; But how about your conscience now, that scrupled At physic? Could it swallow dice and cards? Dr. Lorne. Quite readily: I take it that a conscience Is like an Arab horse that frets and fidgets In the strait streets where people congregate; But let it free i' the wilds, and it obeys The lightest touch. At last I found myself— After a run of luck in India— Up in a native state—netting one day Some hundred thousand, odds. Bennett. Then you came home To your snug place here. Dr. Lorne. Not a bit of it. I said, “Now, if I keep this, ten to one 'Twill vanish at the next turn o' the wheel; And yet I cannot give the game up yet, Or settle down, respectable, to grow Fungi and mosses on my brains at home. But there's my brother, dear old fellow, starving In the old manse, where we all starved in youth, I'll send it him, and he will use it well.” Bennett. The whole of it? Dr. Lorne. Well, pretty nearly so. I kept a nest-egg, or I scarce had been Where I am now. But listen; I am coming Straight to the point at last. I knew poor Ronald Would never take it as a gift from me, Would only bank it in my name—he had No notion of investing even—and so If things went wrong, as they had often done, Why, it would go, as other gains had gone, To hungry creditors. Bennett. I see. But how Avoid that, if he would not take your gift? Dr. Lorne. That's what I had to settle. Well, there was A crofter fellow from Glenaradale, Who had gone partners with me in some ventures,— Rail way-contracting, money-lending, what not? I took him for my friend, for I had done him A good turn more than once. This man I made My banker; giving it in charge to him To send the money to my brother here, When he next heard of me, which should be soon. Bennett. But you took vouchers? Dr. Lorne. Surely; here they are; And that is why I sent for you, to know If they be valid, as I think they are. He dealt in money, managed our exchanges, Contracted, too, for railways; a smart fellow, Jobbing at everything, and everything Brought money to him—so they said at least. But to my plot. Having set all this right, As I supposed, I went and drowned myself. Bennett. Drowned yourself! Well, you take your drowning kindly. Dr. Lorne. Next day there was a body—a white man's From the up-country somewhere—floated down The river with a pocket-book of mine Found on him, where they did not know my face. I read the notices of my decease In the newspapers, one day, in Japan, Months afterwards. They gave me on the whole A character for enterprise and honour, My brother read at home with grateful tears, And I in Tokyo with mirth and laughter. Bennett. What could you mean by such a foolish trick? How could this drowning help you? Dr. Lorne. Don't you see? To take a gift of eighty thousand pounds Was one thing to a kind of thin-skinned conscience, And quite another thing a legacy From his dead brother lying in his grave. Bennett. Well, well; you're a mad fellow. But the money— Dr. Lorne. Was never heard of more. My clever friend Had married in the native state a woman We used to call the Begum—a volcano Incarnate, an embodied thunder-bolt, Fat, greedy, false, and cunning as a serpent, And yet a fierce tornado. I've no doubt She set him on to write that I had died In debt, and hunted up some old accounts Which the poor parson paid. They were but trifles, Yet he would wear a shabbier coat for them. I almost could forgive the theft, but not That dirty trick on him, the scurvy rogue! Bennett. Ah! your too clever schemes miscarry always. But what came of your Begum? Dr. Lorne. Oh, she died Ten years ago; and Cattanach came home With a fine half-breed daughter, and my money, Which bought Glenaradale; and then he died. Bennett. The papers now? But did you never write Your brother? Dr. Lorne. No; he thought that I was dead; And I thought oft, when things were tight with me, What plenty there would be in the old manse, And that somehow contented me. Bennett. The vouchers? Dr. Lorne. Well, here they are; it was a native lawyer Drew them up for me, but I think they're right. Bennett. Leave me alone a while;—at least be quiet, Unless I ask a question. 'Tis a case Needs an old lawyer's skill. Of course he held That you were dead indeed, and the temptation Was too much for him. Opportunity Makes rogues as heat breeds worms in carrion; You gave him just the chance to turn a rascal. A most mad business! Had you but consulted A lawyer, now, you might have had your will, And he might have been honest to this day. Dr. Lorne. Nay, but he was a rogue in grain, I fear, And never took the straight road, when a crooked Came handy to him. Bennett (reading). Right, right; clear as day. Not a flaw in them. Who could have believed That a brown Hindoo could have made a case So tight as this? There's only one thing now. How about that same drowning in the river? Dr. Lorne. Read on. Bennett. I see. Compeared before the Judge; Witnesses certify that you are you, And that the dead man was not you. All right. And now, sir, we may dine with easy minds. Dr. Lorne. Then we can do it? Bennett. Do it! we can wring Both principal and interest from his heirs To the last mite. I have not time to sum it, But it will take a many Highland acres Of hill and moor to clear it; and there's nothing Will clear his character. Dr. Lorne. He had none to lose. Then you will take the case in hand for me? Bennett. Will I consent to eat your venison, Pick well-kept grouse, and drink your dry champagne, Or orderly draw up a long account For a good client? Will I consent, quotha? Why, if the case were only half a case, Instead of what it is, a certainty, There is no lawyer could refuse so neat, Compact a job. It's really beautiful. Dr. Lorne. Then we shall go and dine. Bennett. By all means dine. I never felt both appetite and conscience So sweetly go together. If you have A bottle of old port, you're safe to draw it; 'Twill not be wasted on me. Chorus. So they sit there and drink Port, crusted, that mellows Even crusty old fellows That are well on the brink Of the threescore and ten Appointed for men To labour and think, And to eat here and drink. Oh the night that they spent! And the stories they told! And the bottles that went Like shorn sheep to the fold! What did the ordered household say? And what could the old men think next day? SCENE II. Chorus. When frank, straightforward hearts defile Their ways with some unwonted wile And crafty stroke, In their own gin they are oft ensnared, And better they had onward fared With simple folk. The choicest and wisest Of all the world is he Who talks still, and walks still In clear sincerity. Let moles work underground, and mine, Let adders creep with supple spine Through grass and ling, Let pewits lure you from their nest With wailing cry, and drooping crest, And broken wing: But you, man, be true, man, And, artless, jog along The highways; for byeways Will surely lead you wrong. Scene—Cairn-Cailleach. Doris and Factor Duffus. Doris. There, Duffus, never mind: you're not much hurt, And they shall pay for this. Factor. My bones are whole, But all my joints are aching, and my feelings Cruelly wounded. Does that count for nothing? Doris. Well, well; we'll find a plaster soon to heal Your wounded feelings: we'll have law on them. You say Sir Diarmid took their part? Factor. He did; Mocked me, insulted me, called me a rat For dogs to worry, bade them shake me well As terriers might. He seemed to save my life, But I believe 'twas all arranged before. Doris. And Ina Lorne was there too? Factor. Yes; I saw her Stand up and wave her hands, as hounding on Their murderous fury. Doris. Enter your complaint then; Get the ringleaders clapt in jail. The sheriff Will not be slack in dealing with those “Men” Who mar our mirth and music. Factor. Yes; perhaps They might be brought before the higher court, If we went warily about it. Some Have even been hanged for less. Doris. I daresay. Well; At any rate we'll make them rue this job, Gentle and simple of them. Now, good-bye; Drive to the town and get your warrants out. Factor. I'll lose no time. [Exit Factor. Doris. A letter from Sir Diarmid, Formal and stiff, asking an interview. What does it mean? It cannot be this riot, And threatening of the factor's life; that is Too trifling, though I'll make them suffer for it. It looks like business, and yet our affair Had never less of promise, as I think. What can it be. He is too much a man To beg remission of his debt. What then? Can he have dreamed that I have given my heart To that word-monger who would buy my wares With promises to pay, and no effects To meet his promise? Well, if that's his game,— As I half think it is, being so shallow, And like a man's dull wits—if he will ask me In the fond hope that I will now refuse, Being love-pledged to yonder popinjay,— Oh, the flat fool!—Do I then love him truly? I hardly know; it might have been so once, Had he once truly sought my love; but this I'm sure of, that I hate with all my soul The girl that robbed me of him. Could I break Her heart now, though I wrecked my life on it, Would I not do it? Once I thought to send That popinjay to her, in hopes that he Might babble a love tale into her ear, And make her public by a wicked poem: Or false or true, it matters not. But that Had been a bootless errand; for she moves Like some clear star in the serenities, So far beyond his reach he could not smirch her Even by his praise. But there. The hour is near, And I must smooth the ruffles from my face, Try to look sweet and innocent, and yet Keep my head clear. I may need all my wits. Enter Sir Diarmid. Sir Diarmid. Good-morning, Doris! You are looking radiant: I need not ask, How do you? Doris. Well, of course; That question is a superfluity Of custom, at a loss what else to say. But now I think on't, is there aught ails you? You scarce reflect the radiance you are pleased To see in me. Sir Diarmid. Oh, I am always strong And healthy as a ploughman. But we men Have cares of business on us; and, besides, Our faces never have the light of yours; They are horn-lanterns, and their light is dim, Fit only for the stable. Doris. Oh! But, Diarmid, I never knew you were so greatly bent On business. Yet I'm glad: it's like a man. Boys only think of shooting, fishing, sport, And girls of balls and dresses. But a man— You see how wise I grow—takes up his task Of duty bravely, or sadly at the worst. This will delight your mother. Sir Diarmid. Nay, I know not That I'm so fond of work, or that my mother Has any reason to be proud of me. But, like or not like, one has work to do, And trouble with it, and the less you like it The more it troubles you. Doris. Oh, but you ought To like it, Diarmid. If you only saw How sharply I look after my affairs, And knit my brows o'er long accounts, and make My lips like wafers, doing dreadful sums! And when they're done I jump right up, and sing, Or waltz about the room. Sir Diarmid. Well; my affairs Will hardly set me waltzing as I look Into them closely. It is well that yours Leave you so light of heart. Doris. Why, what is wrong?— Oh, by the way, my factor has been here; Poor man! his bones are full of aches and bruises, And he complains of you that you encouraged Those rascals of Glenaradale to worry His life nigh out of him. I hardly thought That you would aid the rabble in their outbreaks Against their natural leaders. Sir Diarmid. He abused Your ears in saying this. I saved his life; And that's his gratitude! Doris. Well, I only heard His side, of course. I hope your case is clear; He has gone to the Fiscal to complain. Sir Diarmid. E'en let him go: he'll not make much of that. And, Doris, when the truth comes out of this Same natural leadership which never leads, And cares not for the flock but for the fleece, It will provoke sharp comment. In these days, We live beneath the eye and surveillance Of all the world, and public sentiment Is not with us, let Law say what it will, For we have made it in our interests. Doris. Will public sentiment—whate'er that be, And I suppose it's just newspaper babble— Back up a threat of murder, and a brutal Assault on one who simply did his duty? Sir Diarmid. No, surely. But was Duffus in the line Of duty, jeering at the poor folk's worship, Setting his dogs a-howling to their psalms, And ordering them to leave the hallowed place, So linked with their most sacred thoughts and feelings, Where they had met these hundred years? Doris. Of course, You have been hearing Ina Lorne. She'll find Herself in trouble some day. Sir Diarmid. Be it so: I'd rather stand with those poor men, and bear The sentence of the Law, than feel the verdict O' the general conscience cover me with scorn.— But it was not my errand to discuss These matters with you. Doris. What then was the business That brought you? Sir Diarmid. It is kind in you to give me This meeting, though I fear I am too late. Doris. Nay, you were punctual to a minute, Diarmid, I've noticed that you have that excellent habit Of business. Sir Diarmid. What I meant was, that my errand Might be too late, forestalled perhaps, and useless. Doris. What is your errand then? I cannot think What matter there could be between us two To make you stammer so, and hesitate. Sir Diarmid. Idle enough, if I may judge from all I see and hear; and I confess my claims Are weak compared to his, for he can give you A name among the brilliant company Of wits and scholars in the capital, Who rightly could appreciate your rare beauty, And your fine gifts of mind. Well; must I then Congratulate you, Doris, or go on? Doris. I do not understand you; but go on, If there be anything to go on to. Sir Diarmid. Pardon me. I had heard my friend had won Your love, as well he merits. He said as much. Doris. Who gets his merits? Some folk think themselves Worth all the world, while all the world thinks them Too slight to be accounted of. Your friend, Was he then boasting of a conquest? Sir Diarmid. Nay; Not boasting, only glad, as well he night be, To win so fair a prize. And my small merit Is nothing beside his, nor could it gain, I fear, by my poor telling. It did not Astonish me that one so brilliant plucked The fruit from me. Doris. Was this your errand, then, To know if I am plighted to your friend Whom I'll not name, as you do name him not? I thought such questions commonly were left To curious women. Sir Diarmid. That was not my errand: But that, if it were true, would make my errand A useless one, which need not trouble you. Doris. Better to say out what you meant to say About yourself, than question me of love Which, till it choose to speak, should scarce be asked To break its silence. Sir Diarmid. Well, I did not come To speak of love, though love should be the theme Of such discourse. But truth is more than all; And that you have a right to get. Doris. Please don't; It sounds so dreadful serious. There is always Something unpleasant in the wind, when people Tell you they'll speak the truth. In schoolgirl days 'Twas always the preamble of a scolding, And sitting in a corner to commit Irregular French verbs and poetry. Will it not keep? And could you not for once Say something nice, even if it were not true? Sir Diarmid. Nay; what I have to say must be said now, Unless your hand is plighted to Tremain. Doris. Say on then what you have to say, Sir Diarmid. Sir Diarmid. There was some compact, as I understand— If you knew of it, it was more than I did, Till some few days ago—between our fathers, That we two should be wedded. I judge them not: They thought they had a right to guide our fates; They thought, at least, that it were well to keep The lands together; whatsoe'er they thought, They bound us to each other, and with cords Hard to be borne or broken. Doris. Yes; they put Our hearts in pawn to ease them of their straits. Sir Diarmid. No, Doris, that is what they could not do, And that's the truth you have the right to know. No one can bind the heart; it is as free As air, and laughs at seals and covenants. Our hearts they could not pledge; yours now is free, Or given to another, not to me. I come not then—in this I will be true— To offer mine to you, or ask for yours, But I can give my hand, as they would have it, Knowing it is a poor unworthy gift, Almost an insult, to be thrown back to me In very scorn. Doris. And maybe you would rather It were returned so. Sir Diarmid. That I did not say; But if you scorned it, I might feel the less Scorn of myself, esteeming you the more. Doris. Why should I scorn you, that you give me all You have to give? A man can do no more. Sir Diarmid. A man can do no more; and yet I fancy He hardly could do less Doris. I do not know. But, Diarmid, for your honoured father's sake,— Or is it for the sake of lands and gear? We'll say the former; it sounds rather better— You sacrifice yourself. Then why should I, Since sacrifice comes natural to woman, Fall short of your example? Frankly, you Offer a heartless hand, as frankly I Accept it; so we both can keep our hearts Which, as you truly say, they could not pledge, Or raise a sixpence on them. Sir Diarmid. Do you mean This truly, Doris? Doris. Surely; wherefore not? It's just a family arrangement, with The pious feeling that the fifth commandment Is rightly honoured, though the Law is broken, Which is fulfilled by love. They do these things In France, and find they answer admirably: A simple piece of business, and there needs No more about it. Sir Diarmid. Does there need no more? Think again, Doris. Doris. Yes! we might exchange Rings with each other, since we keep our hearts, Sealing our hands with that our hands do wear. Mine is a diamond; yours an opal—is it? Fickle, they say: but that's mere superstition. There, now; it's settled. Sir Diarmid. Can you then be happy With such a bargain? Doris. Why, Sir Diarmid, what Has happiness to do with it? It's business; And business has its profits or its losses, And if the gain is clear, what would you more? Sir Diarmid. It's sin and certain misery. Doris. It is Your own suggestion, and you surely could not Lure me to sin and misery. Indeed, We manufacture sins, like yards of cloth, By these new-fangled consciences of ours, Framed not by nature, but by novels. Look! Here are our lands, that lie so close together, Fast-bound to us and to our progeny; I am My Lady, or shall be; you, the Laird Of all; and each has got what each would like To have: then, as for happiness, our hearts Are free to seek it where it may be found. That was your own proposal, was it not? Sir Diarmid. It's like a dream. Doris. But not an ugly one: I'm not a dream, and some folk think me pretty. Sir Diarmid. I know not what to say. Doris. Say nothing, Diarmid. We can imagine silent love is grand, Which, speaking, sounds most silly. Do not try To utter now the feeling that is in you. Perhaps we might just kiss each other. Yes, It is the custom, I believe. Now, go. Good-bye; don't let your mother call to-day; To-morrow I will see her. [Exit Sir Diarmid. Now I'll have Revenge at least, whatever come of this; I'll break that proud girl's heart within an hour. Chorus. To be outwitted so! To see your plot which was not very deep, Nor very noble, tumbled in a heap, And all your hope laid low By one who was less noble still, Yet only took you at your word, And led you on and on, until She held you as a snarèd bird, And while you scorned your mean resource, And felt you had been mocked by rule, You wist not whether it were worse To seem so like a knave, or else so like a fool. At the strangeness of it all, At first, a loud hoarse laugh he raised! And the shaggy big-horned cattle gazed, Wondering, over the mossy wall: Then for a little he paused and pondered, Keenly revolving what to do; And off through bracken and blaeberries wandered, Nor slackened his pace till he came in view Of the low, green, honey-suckled manse Beside the still salt Loch that lay as in a trance. SCENE III. Chorus. With a heart unquiet To and fro she went, Feeding on a diet Of vague presentiment From shadows without form, that across her soul were sent. So the daisied meadows Close their petals white When the brooding shadows Make the day like night, For shadows may be burdens to us, when we live on light. And she went on, pleading He is fond and true; In a love-light reading All that he might do— Pleading, but the boding fear came ever back anew. Is it not a treason To her love, to doubt, And in search of reason Thus to cast about, The which, if she had loved aright, she well might do without? Scene—The Manse Study. Ina (alone). Ina. Down, wicked doubts that leap on me like hounds, And soil me with your pawing. Well I know, He is the truest gentleman on earth, Tender and brave; and now he is my own, And, honouring all women, loves but me. And I—I love him as a woman may, Whose love is all her life. Why comes he not? This day was to deliver him, he said, From all his cares, and make me all his care, Who would not be a care, but comfort to him— But hush! I hear his step upon the gravel, Yet hurried and uncertain. What is wrong? Now let me gird my soul to share his burden, Or take it all myself, if so I may. Enter Sir Diarmid. Sir Diarmid. O Ina, shall you ever look on me So lovingly again? Ina. Ay! every day, And all day long, I hope, if love of mine Can aught delight you. But what ails you now? Sir Diarmid. Oh, I have been a fool, and properly Have been befooled! for I conceited me, I was the cleverest schemer, though an ass. Can you forgive me, Ina? Ina. I shall hardly Take you at your own value, nor am I So very wise that your unwisdom needs My pardon. Sir Diarmid. But it does. And what is more, Until I have your pardon—and a blank one, To be filled up by utter idiocy Of mine—I cannot even tell you, Ina, The thing you have forgiven. Ina. Well; I think My heart could anything forgive to you, Except a change in yours. Sir Diarmid. And that is still The same, has never wavered, nor yet shall, Though I have wandered in a brainsick dream Of self-delusion. One thing more, and then You shall know all my madness. Can you dare To be a poor man's wife? Ina. Dare to be poor! Nay, I have feared to be a rich man's wife, Being a poor man's daughter. Wooden quaichs Come handier to my use than silver goblets, And sometimes I have trembled when I thought My homely ways might shame you. But what mean you? Sir Diarmid. No matter now; I'll tell you by and by. Ina. Nay, but if you do hint that for my sake This lot must come to you, I could not be A wife to make you poor. Sir Diarmid. Oh, with your love I shall be rich, and never shall regret. Ina. It is not your regret I fear to meet— You are too noble—but it is my own. The thought that I had lowered him I loved, Or that I was a burden to his life, Or that he might have held a higher place And played a greater part but for my sake, That would quite crush me. To be poor, I heed not, But to cause poverty—I dare not do it. Sir Diarmid. Yet what if, lacking you, my life were poorer And meaner than the meanest, having you, Replenished with the only wealth I care for? Ina. You glorify the thing you're fain to have, As poets glorify their favourite flowers, Although but common daffodils. Yet one Can know one's self as none else can, and judge With less imagination. Let that pass. But what is this you speak of? How should you Be poorer for your choice, but that the choice Is a poor one enough? Sir Diarmid. It is not that Will make me poor. You are my only wealth Now, and because you are my all, I cling The more to you. For had I never seen The face I deem the fairest on this earth, Nor known the heart I prize above all treasures, This fate had still been mine. It must be mine, Whether you share and sweeten it to me, Or let me bear my burden all alone. The thing that I must do to keep my place I could not do, except with self-contempt, And open-eyed dishonour, and the loss Of all in life that makes it worth the living; And yet I have been fooled into a promise To do this very thing. Ina. You frighten me. I do not understand. What have you done? 'Tis sin to break a promise; yet it may be A greater sin to keep it; and between The choice of sins, 'tis hard to pick one's way. Sir Diarmid. Ay, truly it is but a choice of wrongs. I made a promise that was false to love, And break it that I may be true again: Caught in the snare which I myself had laid, I must break from it, though I break my troth, For only being false, can I be true. Oh, I am humbled and ashamed, as well I may be. But you do forgive me, Ina? Ina. Yes, I forgive you. But I am perplexed, What is it all about? Enter Doris. Doris. Oh, Ina dear, Why do you keep a dragon like that Morag, Who cannot even nicely tell a lie To visitors, but sends them from your door, Gruff as a bear?(Starting.) Ah! You here, Diarmid, are you? Well, you are favoured, Ina. Only think; That both of us should turn at once to you To be the first to hear the happy news! Of course, he has been telling you. Ina. I know not What you mean, Doris. Doris. Diarmid has not told you! Well, that was kind to let me be the bearer Myself of my good tidings. Can't you guess Why I am here so happy? Ina. Truly no; I am not good at riddles. Doris. But this is not A riddle; and I wished you so to hear it From my own lips, and not from any stranger, Not even from Diarmid, who of course would be Clumsy at telling it. Yes, yes, I see You know his ring; he put it on my finger An hour ago, and made me, oh so happy! Now will you not congratulate me? Sir Diarmid. Ina, Hear me. Nay, do not think I wish to clear Myself. Ina. Sir Diarmid, what you wish to do Or not to do; and whether you are right Or wrong in doing that which you have done, 'Tis not for me to say. Why should you bring— You, either of you—these affairs to me, Settled between you? Doris, I am sure You came not here to give me any joy, And if you wished to pain me, you have failed, And lost your errand. Now, I pray you leave me; I have much work to do in briefest time. I hope that you will be a loving wife And loyal; but these things concern not me. Adieu! Sir Diarmid. No, Ina, you must hear me out. You should have heard the story from myself Ere now, but that I shrank from my own shame, And from your pain to hear it. Listen then. This lady has a right to all my land— An honourable right by bond of law— Unless I marry her; and I, who had No right to use such mean diplomacy, Plotted to make her love another man, And get refusal of my own request, Not for her love, for that I never asked, But for her hand, the which I did not want. Yet she accepted that which was in truth An offered insult—marriage without love Frankly avowed. I thought—nay, if you will, I hoped that she would cast it back with scorn, As it deserved. O the blind fool I am! But she picked up the gage, even so conditioned As any woman with a woman's heart Would have despised to touch it. No, I do not Accuse her to you, or defend myself. I have done that a man will scorn himself All his life long for doing. Doris. Handsome terms For one who, unsolicited, besought My hand an hour ago! You shall not mend Matters in this way, sir. Sir Diarmid. I do not hope To mend them, but to end them. Hear me out; Frankly I do accept the poverty My father has bequeathed me, and I came, Ina, to you to tell you this resolve. Doris (singing). “The king says to the beggar maid, I'll clothe me too in duds, And we'll go mending pots and pans, And camping in the woods.” O rare idyllic love in tattered rags! Sir Diarmid. Ina, I was a fool, and dealt in craft, Only to be the greater fool, the more Crafty I seemed; there is an end of that Doris, there is the ring you put on me, Unasked. Doris. We made exchange, and for myself I'll keep what I have got. I am not one To throw away a lover or his lands, While I have wits to hold them. Sir Diarmid. Be it so; Take or refuse, it matters not to me: My choice is made. From henceforth I will be Honest, however poor. And—pardon me— I had no right to insult you with an offer Which you, perhaps in mockery, accepted, Which I, at any rate, in simple manhood Ought never to have made. Take all my rights, then; They're justly yours—my house and lands and all My fathers did enjoy; but understand You have no right in me for evermore. Ina. Ah! that is right, whatever else was wrong. Doris. Oh, yes, of course he'll give up all for you. Ina. 'Tis nought to me. I have no interest In any of these doings. Only I Would grieve to think of one I reckoned true And noble above many, falling from The ideal of a better life, to be A scorn unto himself. But fare you well. Doris. Oh, it is all the high heroics here: The very air is tragical: we stalk And strut, when other folk would only walk. Moral-sublime's the rôle! Cast to the wind Houses and lands and honours all for love! And yet I even dreamt you would have thanked me, That I would be content to take his hand, And leave his heart—to you. Good-morning, Ina; Good-morning, you, Sir Landless; we shall scarce Meet again soon. [Exit Doris. Sir Diarmid. Is this the end then, Ina? You promised to forgive. Ina. I have forgiven; Though this was not, I think, within the scope Of possible thought then. But can you forgive Yourself as readily? Sir Diarmid. Have I fallen so low In your esteem, that you should think this shame, Like a boy's blush, shall vanish, and he scarcely Know it was there? I have done wrong, but from That wrong I trust to shape a better life, Which else had been as the poor gambler's luck Fooling him to his ruin. Ina. May it be so: And if it be, there's no one will rejoice More than I shall, to know that this has been Only a passing cloud, which we remember Not as a cloud, but as a freshening shower Redeeming the scorched land. Sir Diarmid. Redeemed it shall be, If shame can work repentance; but resolve, Knitting its brows, and girding for the battle, May yet lose heart, seeing no gleam of hope To brighten patience. Ina. There is hope of mending, Of being once more what one failed to be. Sir Diarmid. But none of Love? That is a broken cistern That keeps no water for the broken heart, Being once cracked? Ina. I pray you let me go: Perhaps the broken cistern truly is The only broken heart. Farewell! Sir Diarmid. Farewell! I will do right though this be hope's sad knell. [Exit Sir Diarmid. Ina (alone). Ah me! and I have lived through this, and may Have many years of such a life to live! No warning of it—the volcano smokes Before it bursts in flame, but here the fire Broke suddenly beneath me, and my world Is blackened, scorched, and burning under foot, And not a blade of all its former beauty, And not a little well of all its gladness Remains, and no horizon to its darkness Except a far-off grave! O weary life! O Love, there is no joy like that thou bringest, Nor any grief like that thou leav'st behind, Being gone. God pity me! I was so happy; And while my heart was singing in the light Of its great bliss, the arrow pierced it through, And I fell prone to—this. What must I do? What can I do? No, there is nought to do, But only try to look as if the wound Hurt me not, and to bleed so silently, Girding a maiden's modesty about A broken heart, that none may find it out. I blame him not; he has been weak, not false; At least, it was for truth that he played false; But oh, it is too hard. God pity me, For my glad life is turned to misery. [Exit. Chorus. What if your Dagon, falling down, is broken, Dagon, to whom your daily prayer was spoken, And the sweet incense offered, to betoken Faith that ne'er falters? Pick up the fragments, piece them well together, Tenderly fit them each into the other, Raise now the Fish-god, Lord of war and weather, High o'er his altars. Ah! but your heart sank, shattered as he lay there, Peace you had none then, wailing all the day there, Yet as you look now, can you go and pray there Where you once wended? Once he was glorious, your gilded Dagon, Throned on his altar, or borne upon his waggon; But he was broken, and how are you to brag on What you've just mended? Here were the fractures, though they're patched up nicely, And he looks once more as he did precisely; Yet he can no more be so paradisely Perfect to you now. Varnish the joinings, veil the sunshine garish, Dim light is fittest, when the soul would cherish As a thing sacred that which so can perish, Patched up anew now. Broken her dream is, faded all the glory, All the cloud-castle fallen a ruin hoary Lost too the thread, and interest of the story Late so entrancing. No more may he come to her maiden vision Robed in the splendour of a Power, Elysian; Only a man, he, feeble of decision, Foolishly chancing. ACT V. SCENE I. Chorus. Bears still the faithful servant on her heart The household joys and griefs, whate'er they be: The well-trained hireling deftly plays her part, But clumsy service, fairer far thou art, Love moving thee. “Oh, 'tis our bargain—so much work and wage; No more is in the bond,” as you shall find:— Ay! but the unwrit bonds of God engage More than is set down in the formal page, Or Law can bind. “Yes! but they are a plague, and it is wrong To let them be too free—it spoils them quite”— Ay, love takes liberties, but you may long For one true heart amid a heartless throng On some dark night. No love can spoil; it perfects with its touch: And being free hath a familiar grace, And like a babe even sacred things will clutch; Yet life were dull and dismal without such Lights on its face. Scene—Post Office. Morag and Mrs. Slit. Mrs. Slit. Och! and it iss yourself, Mrs. Morag, that will be a sight for sore eyes, which it wass the loch said to the hill when it came out of a month's mist. Morag. Your eyes do not need salve, Mrs. Slit; they can do without me, and without the spectacles too, for they are as keen as a hawk's, though you are not so much younger than myself either. But I have been very busy, and I have had my troubles and my tempers too. Mrs. Slit. Yes, yes! We are all born to troubles and tempers, as the sparks fly upward. Morag. It is just like the seal I am. I get my head above the water maybe for a minute, and turn this way and that to see about me, and then I'm down to the depths again among the crabs and the tangles—that's the troubles and tempers. Mrs. Slit. But Miss Ina will not have her tempers, though. Morag. Will she not? But she brings out mine whatever; and it is all the same. Mrs. Slit. But an angel might do that, Morag. Morag. Girls are not angels, Mrs. Slit, as you would know if you had any. Angels will know their own minds, at least, and we have four and twenty minds in the four and twenty hours. Mrs. Slit. Yes, I know. It iss a great change to be left all alone. Morag. But she is not more alone now than ever she was before. For he would be always at his books and his sermons, as close as a limpet to a rock. Mrs. Slit. That iss true, but then he wass always there, Mrs. Morag, which it just makes the difference. My Eachan would be a useless body sitting there by the fire for years, cramped and twisted with the rheumatics. But he wass always there to be seen to, and to be wanting this and that; and it wass not like the same house after his arm-chair would be empty. Poor thing! it iss myself that can be sorry for her. Morag. But it is not for you, Mrs. Slit, to be calling her a poor thing, like any fisher-lass in the clachan; and her a lady, and a minister's daughter too! Mrs. Slit. Surely she iss to be pitied, Morag, for she iss in trouble, and which iss more, she iss an orphan, and which iss more, she will have no one to look to, but that ne'er-do-well uncle who iss here to-day, and nobody knows where to-morrow, away among heathens or tinklers. Och! yes, she iss to be pitied. Morag. No, she is not to be pitied, but to be roused up, and told her duty, and to be respected, Mrs. Slit. And for her uncle, he will be giving her a house and a down-sitting like a duchess, when she will go to him; and he is not to leave Glen Chroan any more. Mrs. Slit. It iss yourself that will be going with her then, Morag. Morag. She would as ill do without me, Mrs. Slit, as the gull without the water. Mrs. Slit. Yes, that iss true, you have been with her all her days. And it iss riding in your coach you will be, and living like the princes and rulers of the earth maybe. When will you be going, now? Morag. I do not know when we will be going, or if we will ever be going, and I do not want to go near a house which is no better than a heathen's. Mrs. Slit. But she will have to go somewhere soon, for we will be having the new minister, and he will need the manse, no doubt, but I hear there iss no wife to come with him, whatever. Morag. Minister! Is it the lad you would be having two Sabbaths ago you call a minister? To think she must leave her father's house for the like of him! Mrs. Slit. What iss wrong with him, Mrs. Morag? He iss a very pretty man, and, which iss more, he hass the beautiful Gaelic. Morag. Maybe he has: but has he the Gospel, Mrs. Slit? We used to blame the old man because he was more dainty about his words than his doctrine. But this one, he will have no doctrine at all either about God or devil. For I heard him tell Miss Ina at her own fireside that the devil was a myth of the Middle Age. As if he was not as busy with young folk as he is with the like of you and me, Mrs. Slit! Mrs. Slit. Och! yes, that iss true, whatever. But what iss a myth, Mrs. Morag? You should know that have lived in a minister's house so long. Morag. Do you think that I swallow dictionaries then, because I live in a minister's house? I do not know what it is. But it will be something bad, no doubt, or it would not be spoken about him, middle age or not middle age. Mrs. Slit. Yes, it will be something bad. But he hass the good Gaelic. Morag. And the devil has the Gaelic and the English too, Mrs. Slit. Mrs. Slit. That iss true too; but he will have more English, Morag. Morag. Maybe, I do not know. He has plenty Gaelic for his purpose. But is there no letter for us to-day? Mrs. Slit. Och! yes, there will be one for Miss Ina. I am thinking it iss from the laird himself. What will be taking him to London now, when we wass all hoping he would be come to settle among his own folk? Morag. How should I know what would take him to London? Maybe to bring an English wife to turn up her nose at us. But why did you not tell me of the letter before? and me wasting my time here that never gets out of doors till the bats are out! Mrs. Slit. But it wass yourself never asked till this fery minute, Mrs. Morag. Morag. And what else would I be here for at this time of day? Mrs. Slit (examining letters). That iss for my lady. It iss thin, and wafered, and blue paper, and will be an account, no doubt; they are not fery welcome at the castle, I fear. There iss no hurry about that. This iss from the gamekeeper to the factor they would be for drowning in the loch. It can wait; he will not be caring for letters yet, I'm thinking. And there iss half a dozen for the long-haired poet-man that will be courting Miss Doris. It iss a bold man he iss, or maybe a blind one, whatever. Morag. Who is he, Mrs. Slit? Mrs. Slit. I do not know. But he will be getting many letters and printed papers, and they say he is a great poet in the Sassenach. But, to be sure, that iss not like the Gaelic. Morag. Is he often with Doris then? Mrs. Slit. Och! they are like clam-shells; there iss no parting them. And he will speak sense to her maybe, but it iss just heathenish gibberish he will be talking in my shop. Morag. That will do now. There is Ina's letter. I have been too long away from her. But I was to be sure to ask about your Oe that had the fever. Mrs. Slit. Yes, she iss a kind lady, and thinks of everyone. Allisthair iss better now, and will be at the fishing again soon. Morag. And how is the fishing and the whisky? Mrs. Slit. Not more than usual, Morag, but always too much of the whisky, whatever. Morag. Yes! They will be like Donald Levach who was drowned in a ditch; and his last words would be—You are changing the drink, and there is too much water in it, Jenny, too much water. [Exit Morag. Chorus. Truly she did not know it, Dreamed not of humour or mirth, Made not an effort to show it, Travailed no whit in its birth: Just it came to her easy, The quaint, odd satire and fun, Without any purpose to please ye, Or pleasure in its being done. Hard and grave were her features, Though lit up with love now and then, For laughter was not for such creatures As sinful women and men. It was simply the way that she reasoned, The natural shape of her thought, While it looked as if cleverly seasoned With a sharp biting wit she had got. O ye that strive to be witty, And hunt through your brains for a quip, When ye have caught one, in pity Silence it straight on your lip. SCENE II. Chorus. Shall not a woman insulted have her revenge on the man, Mock at him, laugh at his anguish, smite with what weapon she can, Cut where the wound shall be quickest, smile as he writhes in the dust, Mirthful when he comes a-begging an obolus now, or a crust? Does not the feeling of injury strike out seeking redress? And why should the gods plant in her a passion she is to repress? They know their business, and did not fashion our nature to be A soft-hearted, soft-headed, milk-and-water philanthropy; There's a hard grit in it, meant for use at the fitting time, That rogues and villains may know the bitter bad taste of crime.— Oh, be gentle and meek, and kiss the hand hot from the blow, And stint your soul of the pleasure, the keenest of all that we know! Drive the winds over the ocean, yet say to the mad waves, Peace! Why should you lift up your heads now? there, let your murmurings cease! Easy to say, Forgive, and lay up your wrath on the shelf: But how, if you take it so tamely, shall you respect yourself? If you're a worm to be trod on, trod on you shall be again; Never a woman insipid found chivalrous spirit in men.— So did the wild heart brood now, passioning so in her wrath, And plotted to sweep her victim ruthlessly out of her path. Scene—Room in Cairn-Cailleach. Tremain and Doris. Doris. Well, sir, what think you of this gear? Tremain. Think, Doris! I am past thinking: there's a social earthquake Shaking my world, and toppling all things down, While darkness reigns, and mystery, and silence. What does it mean? There's Diarmid, on a sudden, Off like the swallows, with no fare-you-well, And leaving no more trace than flight of bird Through the impassive air; his mother packing To follow him, and not a word to explain, But Celtic exclamations all day long. Doris. So he is gone already. Tremain. Ay, he's gone; But why and whither has he gone, and left His guest to seek for other quarters, just When one was taking to the place, and felt Its strangeness, which at first was like a dream, Growing familiar, with a taste of life Fresh as the salt sea breezes? Doris. Gone already! I did not count on that. And she's off too, After him, doubtless. Much help I have got From your fine phrases, sir. At every point Baffled and mocked! I'm weary of you all, But I will have revenge at least. Tremain. What's all This rage about? It is a pretty play, And it becomes you rarely, as indeed All that you do becomes you; yet I like My Doris tender more than Doris fierce, Although the softness is more beautiful By reason of the wrath restrained. Doris Pshaw! give me Deeds and not words: I've had enough of them! You were to get that girl out of my way. Tremain. And out of it she is: well for herself I daresay. Doris. But not well for you, that she Should drive off like a princess, followed by The prayers and tears of all her subjects here— The cripples, the rheumatics, and the idiots, Who burden this poor land. Tremain. Why ill for me? She has not left a legacy of these Impotent folk to me. Doris. That's as you will. But he who should have humbled, broken her, And cast her from him as a thing of naught— Well, him I could have loved; I hate her so. Tremain. And yet you went to see her lately. Doris. Yes; I went because I had no man to go, And do mine errand, and to smite her with A word should blight her life, and break her heart, As I had hoped it would. But with the look Of a grand tragedy-queen she bade me be A dutiful wife, forsooth, to my affianced, And wear with grace what I had won by guile. Tremain. Affianced, Doris! am I then to take This ring from your fair finger, and put mine Here in its room? Doris. You take my ring from me! Sir Diarmid's ring!—yes, his engagement ring! I'd sooner part with life than part with it. Tremain. What do you mean? Doris. Oh, I forgot. You know not The pretty silly farce we have been playing, Which is to end in fateful tragedy. Diarmid came here one day, insulting me With offer of his hand, but not his heart— A mere wired flower to wither on my bosom— Hoping to be refused, and keep his lands And sweetheart too, because he heard I loved you. As if I could not see through such a thin Shallow device, which he did hardly colour With any show of likelihood! Tremain. Of course You did refuse him? Doris. No; but at a word Frankly accepted him on his own terms;— Hands without hearts, vows that were lies avowed. Would you have had me do the very thing He hoped that I would do, and strip myself Of all my rights that he might wed that girl? Tremain. Well; you accepted only as a ruse— My clever Doris—meaning, by and by, To wreck his hope more wholly. Doris. Not at all. You poets, oh, how little do you know The women, after all, you're fain to paint! You see their eyes and hair, and hear their words: But for their minds they are too fine for you. Men's brains, I think, can have no convolutions, They go at things so straight and stupid, like A gaze-hound at a doubling hare. Tremain. Nay, Doris, You could not surely throw away my love. Doris. Why should I throw away your love, because I take an offer offering no love? Should I not need, and prize it all the more, That it would give me what my fate denied? I've heard you say that love is poetry, And marriage languid prose that never stirs The pulse of high imagination, having No passionate music in it. I must have Some poetry in my life, and you could give it. Tremain. Yes! So! Like verses in a magazine, I might come in to fill a space, a blank, Between the story and the criticism; Not even like the Chorus in the Greek Drama, to fill the passion up, and cry To the stern fates for pity. Thank you, Doris, But love like mine will hardly serve for padding. Doris. What ails you now? A badly written book May have its very essence and its life In the appendix. And my life without you Were dull enough with him. Tremain. You did not mean, then, To marry him really. Doris. Indeed I did, and would; I should have made his life a misery Perhaps, and seen him bitterly repent His dirty bargain; since we both agreed To join our hands, and keep our hearts apart. And really I did mean it. Tremain. Beautiful tigress! Doris. Tigress, if you will; but who has lost Her spring, and turns more savage on her prey. Look here. I will not hide a thing from you: We sealed our bargain by exchange of rings, And other pretty customary forms Of kindness and affiance; and straight-way He hurried to that girl who set him on To break his plighted troth: contented she To take him in the shame of such dishonour. Tremain. How know you that? Doris. How do I know it? Why, I found them closeted together, heard His own false lips renounce the vow he made An hour before. Oh, he was most polite— My gentleman! and did his villain-work Like preaching; for of course he had been schooled, How best to lay the moral varnish on, And spout fine sentiment. I hate sentiment; It is the flimsiest lie that walks the earth, The mere thin ghost of truth. He must admit With shame, forsooth, his offer was an insult, And as an insult humbly he withdrew it: He would not mock a lady with the boon, If boon it could be called, of loveless marriage: But frankly he had hoped I would reject it, Which now he was ashamed of like the rest. The moral prig! as if I did not know Where he had learnt his lesson! Tremain. So he parted With house and lands and honours all for love. Doris. And you too! You take up the tragic style To glorify a fool! Tremain. Yes, for I could Give all the world, too, just to win your love. Doris. Not long ago you said I was a tigress. Tremain. Even so; a grand and proud and terrible beauty, A matchless strength of passion good or evil, Like a volcano, having on its slopes Fair vineyards here, there burning lava-floods. And howsoe'er you show, you do transfix My soul with admiration. Doris. Oh! Perhaps You think my fires have burnt up Diarmid's share, And now the sunny slopes are for your vines. Tremain. Why not? You know that poets always were Alike the favourites of the gods and demons; And he is gone whom you did never love, While I am here whom you have said you loved. What then will you do next? Doris. I will pull down Each stone of that old house, and scatter all The gatherings of ages—pictures, tapestries, Arms, chinas, books, and nick-nacks, every heirloom And symbol of their greatness, sending them Where never can he hope by any chance To pick them up again: and then I'll make A forest of the place, and stalk the deer Over his threshold. Tremain. You are thorough, Doris. Doris. Ay! he shall find that, who has flouted me. Tremain. Where is he now? Doris. Nay, you should know that best. Tremain. I know not. There is only Celtic wailing All through the house, and I have found a shelter Down in the village. Doris. He is gone at least; And she, too, is away—perhaps with him. Tremain. Nay, she went with her uncle yester eve; I saw her go, and thought her looking pale. Doris. Oh yes! you take a mighty interest, Like others, in her movements and her looks! Perhaps, too, you are fain to sacrifice— If you have any such to offer up— Houses and lands and honour for her love. By all means do: you have my full consent To play the fool as he did. Tremain. I could play The fool indeed like him, but not for her: I think I am even more a fool than he, Clinging as for dear life to one who bids me Go seek another love. You know well, Doris, 'Tis easy saying to the captive, Go, When he is bound and fettered. Doris. My poor boy, Are you so deep enthralled? But what was that You said about an uncle? She has none. Her father had a brother once in India Was something to my father—agent, factor— What not?—a scant-o'-grace and ne'er-do-well. But he is dead, oh, years and years ago. Tremain. I tell but what I heard. Some one at least Carried her off last night. I saw them go; They said he was her uncle. Enough of her. I know not why you should so hate her, Doris, Or so hate anything. 'Tis so much better To love, which sweetens all things like a flower. Doris. Ay! better truly for your sluggish souls, Which, like your English rivers, creep along Oily and dull and muddy. But for me My love is hotter than can boil in your Slow veins, and yet I hate more heartily Than I can love. Tremain. When shall I call you mine, Doris? Then you shall see how I can love. Doris. Why, that you call me twenty times a day. Tremain. Nay, do not trifle. Let us fix the time, Since there is nought to come between us now. Doris. Oh, fixing times is stupid. I should hate The day I fixed, and change it in a week. Or, when it came, should keep my bed, and sleep Its hours away, unnoted. But I thought You were content to love, and held that marriage Was like the lump of ice in the champagne, Cooling and weakening passion. Tremain. Then I knew not The agony and ecstasy of love, The rapture and the misery of hope, The jealous watching through the troubled nights, And sinking of the heart. Say when. Doris. I cannot. Maybe a year hence I may settle in The dull jog-trot of marriage—may-be never. Who knows what is to happen? I'm content Meanwhile that things should go on as they do. Tremain. You cannot love like me, then. Doris. Go away! I cannot babble sentiment, and coin My heart into a ballad to be sold To publishers, and sung by silly maids. And if you are not satisfied with that Which I can give you, there are lots of girls Will lend their ears to hear your dainty speeches, And even to believe them—they're such fools. [Exit. Chorus. So she let him go, Puffing him away, Like a flimsy bubble, Never more to trouble Her upon her way. So she let him go, Back to his old gods, Jove and Aphrodite, Thor and Odin mighty, And his songs and odes. So she let him go To fulfil his bent In his pagan ethic, And his fond æsthetic, And his self-content. So she let him go With a mocking smile; Yet no heart was broken When her words were spoken, Though he moped a while. SCENE III. Chorus. Ai me! ai me! Fate sits upon the steed Behind the soul whose passion holds the reins; Ai me! ai me! Better the bending reed, When the gods thunder, than the oaks and planes. The reed remains, when their proud strength is shattered. Ai me! ai me! There's madness in the cup Which jealous wrath mingles in hellish spite; Ai me! ai me! And when we hold it up, It laughs and lightens gaily to the sight, Yet in its might the might of man shall perish. Scene—Room in Cairn-Cailleach. Doris, Dr. Lorne, and Bennett. Doris. What would you, gentlemen? My time is brief. You ask an interview, and fix the time, Nor wait to know my poor convenience. No matter. Only let us to the point Without preliminary phrasing. My Mare yonder waits for me, and grows impatient. Bennett. We have a little business— Doris. Business! Oh! Here is my factor coming, and he does All business for me. Enter Factor. Let me introduce you. Bennett. Happy to know the gentleman; but we Crave audience of yourself for this affair, Which he can scarcely order, not at least Till you shall give him your authority Express. Yet it is well he should be here To counsel you. Dr. Lorne. Miss Cattanach, of course You got the papers which I forwarded, And so far are prepared for us. Doris. And pray Who is this peremptory gentleman? Dr. Lorne. My name is Lorne—a friend once of your father's. Doris. I've heard of such a person—but he died; Was drowned, or drowned himself—I forget which; But people said it would be a relief To all his kinsfolk. Any friend of his? Dr. Lorne. Only himself, come back to plague his friends Who hoped he had relieved them of his presence, And who will welcome him like other ghosts That can't lie quiet in their graves. And now About those papers, Miss? Doris. What papers? Oh! That trumped-up story of his being alive, And claiming monies trusted to my father Years ago; yes, I think the papers came. I did not read them; they are too absurd, And you may have them back now if you like. They're somewhere i' the waste-basket. I'm advised To prosecute you for conspiracy, If you are he that sent them; but the writer Is fitter sure for bedlam. Dr. Lorne. You are well Acquainted with their purport, for a person Who never read them. As I never doubt A lady's word, I must conclude you knew The facts already. That will shorten matters. Bennett. Listen, Miss Cattanach; these are grave affairs; And with a kindly purpose we are here To choke a painful scandal in the birth, If so we may. You could not overlook Those documents. Doris. Well, no; I told a lie, A stupid one too. Yes, I read the trash With laughter as it merited. It seems You'd rob my father of his honest name— Who, you say, was your friend—when he is dead, And cannot answer for himself; and next You would rob me, and being but a woman Weak-nerved of course, you point your pistol at me, Shotted with stuff incredible, demanding My money or my life—brave high-way-man! Pray you now, pull the trigger, sir, and see If I shall wince. Dr. Lorne. So that's your line. And now Your factor here, does he approve of it? Doris. Sir, I can manage my affairs as yet; I am of age, and not quite fatuous; But you can ask him. Factor. Yes, I do endorse All that my lady says. Dr. Lorne. So be it, then; There's no more to be said, I apprehend. Come, Bennett, let us go. Bennett. Nay, not so fast. Do not by haste or wrangling further snarl A knot already hard to disentangle. My fair young lady, you can hardly know The chances or the certainties of Law; But if I had a little while alone Now with your agent, I could make it plain He gives you ill advice. Doris. No doubt, you two, Being closeted together for an hour, Would order all my life. But I prefer To shape it for myself. Factor. And I would leave The Law to give to every one his due. Doris. As your friend says, I think there needs no more. This gentleman who went and drowned himself To benefit his family, that did not Profit much by his living, turns up now Modestly asking eighty thousand pounds, With interest and compound interest For ten or twelve years past. But since the payment Of all these monies would go far indeed To beggar me, he is content if I Will give up to Sir Diarmid house and lands Now forfeited to me. Dr. Lorne. Ay, so I wrote In that same paper which you did not read, And have so clearly understood. Doris. Oh yes! I understand it better than you think: As thus: I read between the lines that you Have made a covenant to wed your niece, Miss Lorne, with Diarmid, who is my betrothed, But by her counsel falsely breaks his word. Now hear me. I will fight it to the last, And will not stint my vengeance, though I starve My life to feed it. I believe your stories Are lies from first to last about my father, From first to last inventions to entrap Poor Diarmid in your snares. But were they all As true as they are false, as credible As they are clean impossible, it would not Matter to me. That girl shall never sit My lady in his house, and smile and fawn Upon the man whose plighted troth I wear, See, on my finger. There; you have my answer. Our business now is ended. [Exit. Dr. Lorne. A high-stepping Filly, that now. But though her tongue is sharp, And she has touched me somewhat on the raw, I bear no grudge, if she had only left Ina alone. I like a clever girl With pluck and talent. Bennett. Was there ever creature So reckless and unreasonable as An angry woman? Dr. Lorne. Well, I do not know. She means to get from life the thing she wants, Cost what it may, as your philosopher Will burn his diamond just to prove 'tis nought But charcoal, and we call him wise. It all Comes to the same at last. One toils for fame, And from his garret where he gnaws a crust Scorns your respectable folk; another swings— I've seen them—on a hook whose iron digs Into the flesh, and he too laughs at us Who live by reason; she is fain to have Revenge for love insulted; and perhaps Each gets as much from life i' the end as we Who gather wealth, and think that they are mad. Only the pursuit pleases; the possession Is empty or bitter always. But these aims Have most intense delight, and in their failure A kind of tragic grandeur. That girl now Has lived, within this hour, as much at least As three good years of our lives. Bennett. Fiddlesticks! She is a fool, sir, and her sentiments Are heathenish or even devilish. [Looks out of window. Look at her; She'll drive that horse mad if she curb him so, And lash him in her tantrums. Dr. Lorne. Ah! that's bad. Now, if she were a friend of mine, she should not Ride off alone, for horse and rider have A wild eye in their heads. She cannot mean To take the old hill-road on such a brute. Yes! there she gallops up the rocky path, Past the old mill, at every hoof a brush Of fiery sparks; she's near the ashtree now That sends a low branch right across the way. By Jove! she's taken it like a fence, and crashed Right through the twigs and leaves. Well ridden, girl! Now, could I but throw off some forty years, I'd risk a ride through life with such a mate. She's out of sight now. There's an ugly bit Of road along the crags, above Loch Dhu. What's that? I could be sworn it was a scream; And there's no tramp of hoofs now: it is fallen Terribly silent. Bennett. Let us go and see. Chorus. Up the steep path on the hill, Past the wild race of the mill, Leaping o'er branch and boulder-stone, Madly the rider galloped on. And up to the heights of that rocky road, Mad as her rider, the sorrel strode, While her sharp ears were forward turned, And the quick smoke from her nostrils burned, And the evil white from her eye had fled, But it was bloodshot now instead, As she swept past a twisted, grey, Ghostly root where a young lamb lay, Picked till each several rib was bare By hungry ravens that haunted there. There were two lovers whispering low Among the bracken beside the brook, Where the juniper bush, and the ragged sloe Made for lovers a sheltered nook: There were two ravens that did croak Over the lamb's ribs picked so bare; Was there no weakling of the flock To make them another supper there? Clatter, clatter upon the rock, They heard the hoofs of the sorrel ring, Only a muffled thud they woke, Now and then, on the moss or ling. Lovers and ravens then upsprung, As nearer and nearer it came with speed, And a wild shriek 'mong the echoes rung, But it was not the woman, it was the steed. What had happened? All now was still, Only the raven, hopping slow To a giddy ledge of the rocky hill, Kept peering down on the depths below. SCENE IV. Chorus. A low-arched bridge, All tufted green with moss and maiden-hair, Spanned a slow stream That lapsed as in a dream Through sedge and willow and meadow flat and fair; And all around were great hills, shadowy, sharp, and bare. On many a knoll, Silent, the golden plovers kept their seat, And in the stream That lapsed as in a dream The heron slumbered, cooling breast and feet, And you could see the air all tremulous with heat. Ah! our unrest More restless grows when all around is peace; For life doth seem To lapse as in a dream Which hath not any fruit or due increase, And we do fret the more that the calm doth not cease. O low-arched bridge With tinted moss and dainty fern o'ergrown, And thou slow stream, Lapsing as in a dream, More hateful ye than perilous stepping stone And turbid river, since peace from her heart has flown. Scene—Bridge near Glen Chroan Lodge. Ina and Morag. Ina. This is the land of sleep; here no man works, Or thinks. Morag. The women work. Ina. Oh yes, they toil 'Neath heavy burdens, while their lords, forsooth, Lie in the sun and watch them sweltering. I could not live here, Morag; it is like A life in death, oblivious listlessness That nothing cares for, and remembers nought. See, the slow brook creeps sleepily along, The trout are slumbering yonder in the pools, The cows lie on the grass with closed eyelids, Languidly chewing, and the yellow bees Wheel drowsily about. These inland lakes Are not like our sea-lochs; there's life in them, Motion and waves and pulsing of the tide, And on their shores we know that we are near The world's great highway thronged with busy life. Morag. You used to call Loch Thorar sleepy too. Ina. Ay, so it is, compared with busy streets Where eager industries do push and drive, And hurrying throngs answer the ringing bells, And huge unwearying machineries Are waited on by patient servitors, Like gods that must be tended morn and eve. There men and women work, and life is lived At the full pitch, for there each man is kept Strict to his task at book or saw or yardstick, Or whatsoe'er his tool be, by the vast Machine of civilisation. Morag. I am thinking That no one wants to be just where he is; We're fain to kick our shadows from our feet, As we might do our slippers. Ina. Maybe so; And yet I willingly would lose myself In work which is not wholly for myself, And thought which is not all about myself. Yes, I am weary of that. Morag. But there's your uncle: Might you not work, and think a bit for him? Ina. He will not let me. He is all for wrapping A girl in cotton-wadding to be kept Like a wax-doll. He is my slave to fetch And carry for me: I am his morning thought, His daily task too, and his evening care. I must not let the sun freckle my skin, Nor yet the night lamp weary my poor eyes, Toiling at book or needlework or music. 'Tis always Me that must be thought about, And I am sick of Me. Where did he learn His notions about women? In the East Among zenanas? They are worse, I think, Than our rough crofters' ways. Morag. He's very good; You should be grateful, Ina. Ina. Grateful, yes! But then to live is more than to be nursed And tended like a baby. What am I, To get all this observance and respect? I want to be at work. This idleness Is like the waste of water-power among Our hills, which might have brought the people bread. Morag. You're weary of being an idol to be worshipped; And they do say a woman's soul was meant Rather to worship man, and maybe guide him To make him worshipful. Are you sure, Ina, It is the worship, or the guiding of him That you have dreamt of? Ina. Oh, all that is past. There was a time of fond idolatry When I did shrine an image in my heart, And never wearied burning incense to it, And offering sacrifice, and singing lauds, And building temples of imagination For other votaries. That time is gone. The glory and the beauty and the dream Are vanished; and the fire is burnt to ashes That choke when they are stirred. I have no wish Either to guide or worship, since the stream That sang along my path amid the flowers Is all gone dry and muddy and common-place. God help me! Morag. Ina, one day I was sailing By misty Morven in the early morning, And as I looked I saw upon the mist My shadow, and the shadows of all the rest, And they were only shadows flitting dim, But on my head there seemed a golden crown Flashing with diamonds. So it was with all; Each saw a halo circling his own head, And all his neighbours only common shadows; So is the vanity of youthful dreams. Ina. Nay, Morag, but the halo and the crown, In my case, did not rest upon my brow, Where vanity would put it, but on his; And now there is no glory anywhere. But work might bring forgetfulness. Morag. But, Ina, Where can you go that trouble will not come? You stand upon the beach, and there the waves Tumble and foam, and, looking seaward, you Are sure that all is bright and calm and sunny, Till you are there. Ina. But there, at least, you find Ropes to be hauled, and sails to reef, and waves To battle with; and I would, like the sailor, Rather a gale of wind than lie beclamed. But there; enough of me and my affairs. Have you heard aught of Kenneth lately? Morag. Ay! Kenneth, poor lad, will never sing again; His pipe is like the blackbird's, hoarse and rusty, Just as the summer comes. Ina. How do you mean? Morag. You know that he and Mairi were together Sitting among the bracken on the height When Doris took her last mad ride along The old hill road. 'Twas they that brought the tidings How her horse shied there at a sudden turn Upon the ridge, seeing a raven leap From a dead lamb that he had picked all bare. They said the boy looked scared. Ina. I do not wonder. It was a scene of horror. Morag. Yes; but now He says that, hearing that wild tramp of hoofs Along the rocky path where never horse Was known to gallop yet, he started up Just as she reached the perilous turn o' the road; And he will have it that his sudden rising, And not the raven, scared the frantic brute, Whose labouring flanks were white with creamy foam, And its eyes red with blood, so that it made The fatal step, and stumbled o'er the brink Of dark Craig-dhu. Ina. It might be so, and yet No blame to him. Morag. But he will blame himself. And then his Mairi is the heir of all Her cousin's wealth, and she, he says, could never Wed him that murdered Doris, nor can he Touch gold that is so stained with blood. Ina. Poor lad! And what does Mairi say? Morag. She sits by him, E'en like a patient dove beside its mate That lies a-bleeding, croodling softly to him, And glad to put her heritage away, If he will smile again; and that he cannot. Ina. Ah me! what threads of sorrow everywhere Run through this tangled life! But go now, Morag. Here comes my uncle. [Exit Morag and enter Dr. Lorne. Dr. Lorne. Ina, it is done, The job you wished, and as you wished it done; Yet a bad job, I fear. Ina. Nay, I am sure 'Tis the right thing, and the right way to do it. No other way was possible. Does he know? Dr. Lorne. He knows that, when a search was duly made, No deed was found such as he had supposed, And so there is no burden on his land, Or claimant for it. It has touched his heart With some remorseful thoughts about that girl. Ina. That's as it should be. It is best for us, And keeps our hearts the sweeter, that the lights, Lingering about the grave, are soft and tender. But he suspects no more—nothing behind. Dr. Lorne. Nothing. I wish he did. It is not right This virtue unrewarded, lavishing Wealth on a man who writes in melting mood Of her that wronged him, with no recognition Of her who set all right. It is too fine For my taste. 'Tis as God had done his work, And let the devil take all the credit of it, Which God Himself objects to. Ina. Yet it could not Be otherwise, for he's a gentleman, And could not take a gift like this from me. There was no way except to burn her claim And yours in the same fire, so blotting out That chapter, as it never had been writ. Dr. Lorne. I don't know that. He could have taken you, And the rest with you. Men are not so nice And dainty about marrying money, when It is a handsome girl that's freighted with it. There was no need to tell him his good fortune Till the day after. Ina. That is past for ever. Dr. Lorne. For ever's not a word for woman's lips, Nor a man's either. I have sworn it oft, And every time I swore I had to break My oath. For Ever—Never, that belongs To God alone, who does not change His mind. Ina. Does he return here soon? Dr. Lorne. Yes, I suppose so. He says that he has found that he can work, But that he has not found his proper work: That's here among his people—not in London. I don't know what he means. There's nothing here For man to do but shoot and fish and grumble. Ina. Oh, he will find his task in life, and now, Uncle, you'll take me hence. For me at least, There is no work here. Dr. Lorne. Whither would you, Ina? Ina. Anywhere, anywhere; but away from this. Dr. Lorne. What say you, then, to Italy? Ina. Italy! I never thought of that. Yes! let us go, And see the picture-galleries and statues, The Temples of the gods, the Colosseum, The towns perched on the hills among the olives, The castles, and the ancient civic grandeur Of merchants who were princes ruling states— All that you oft have told me about Rome And Venice and Verona and fair Florence. I am so useless, and I wish to learn, And Italy's a book with many a page Wondrously written, and illuminate With golden letters. Yes, we will go there. Chorus. At fair Ravenna, one day, she was taking Rest near the wharves where once rose many a mast, But now the goats their pasture there are making, And the grey sea-waves miles away are breaking, As her life too had ebbed far from its past. Sadly she gazed on palace, cot, and tower, And mused upon the Empire's fading days, And on Theodoric and the Lombard power, The rush of barbarous peoples, and the dower Of beauty that transformed their rude old ways. But ever with the thought of these old ages Thoughts of a nearer past would mingle still, Thoughts of her fruitless work and empty wages, And yesterday would write upon the pages Of History, and all their margin fill. And as the yellow bee was drowsily humming, And drowsily the convent bells would ring, And at a neighbouring lattice one was strumming A poor guitar, she knew that he was coming, And a new future surely opening. Nought had she heard of him, or of his doing, Yet she was sure that he was near at hand, That he came swift as one who goes a-wooing, And trembling as an eager soul pursuing The quest of something he deemed pure and grand. “Ina,” he whispered, at her feet low kneeling, Nor did she startle, only answered low: “I knew that you had come. I had the feeling; And past is past.” And then their lips were sealing, Forever now, the love of long ago.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THOUGHTS AND FANCIES FOR SUNDAY EVENINGS [Why should I always pray] “O give thanks unto the Lord; for He is good: because His mercy endureth for ever.”—Ps. cxviii. I. Why should I always pray, Although I always lack? Were't not a better way Some praise to render back? The earth that drinks the plenteous rain Returns the grateful cloud again. We should not get the less That we remembered more The truth and righteousness Thou keep'st for us in store: In heaven they do not pray—they sing, And they have wealth of every thing. And it would be more meet To compass Thee with song Than to have at Thy feet Only a begging throng Who take Thy gifts, and then forget Alike Thy goodness, and their debt. So give me joyous Psalms, And Hymns of grateful praise: Instead of seeking alms, A song to Thee I'll raise: Yet still I must a beggar be, When lauding Thy great charity. But where shall I begin? With health and daily bread? Or cleansing of my sin? Or light around me shed? Till I would praise, I did not see How rich Thy gifts have been to me. [One thing I of the Lord desire—] “Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.”—Matt. v. 8. One thing I of the Lord desire— For all my way hath miry been— Be it by water or by fire, Oh, make me clean. Erewhile I strove for perfect truth, And thought it was a worthy strife; But now I leave that aim of youth For perfect life. If clearer vision Thou impart, Grateful and glad my soul shall be; But yet to have a purer heart Is more to me. Yea, only as the heart is clean May larger vision yet be mine, For mirrored in its depths are seen The things divine. I watch to shun the miry way, And stanch the spring of guilty thought; But, watch and wrestle as I may, Pure I am not. So wash Thou me without, within; Or purge with fire, if that must be; No matter how, if only sin Die out in me. [Lilies take no care] “Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.”—Matt. vi. 28, 29. Lilies take no care How they are to grow, How the earth and air Cause their flowers to blow; Yet their beauty rare Makes a goodly show: Solomon in glory bright Was not half so fair a sight. May I therefore lie Here, and take mine ease, Trusting so to vie In growth and grace with these, And the Master's eye With holy beauty please? Have I only just to be What the earth will make of me? Lilies have no sin Leading them astray, No false heart within That would them bewray, Nought to tempt them in Any evil way; And if canker come and blight, Nought will ever put them right. But good and ill, I know, Are in my being blent; And good or ill may flow From mine environment; And yet the ill, laid low, May better the event: Careless lilies, happy ye! But careless life were death to me. I must watch and pray, I must work and war, I must shun the way Where temptations are, And mend, while yet I may, What sin is fain to mar: If the lamp I do not trim Soon it will be fouled and dim. Yet I will not mope, Yet I will not fear, But be filled with hope, And be of good cheer, Ready still to cope With the danger near: Care, that broods with drooping wing, Only broods of care will bring. [Once they sought the Cross of shame] “Is not this the carpenter?”—Mark vi. 3. Once they sought the Cross of shame Where He bore the sinner's blame, And they battled for the sepulchre Made holy by His name; But oh to chance upon Some work that He had done, The carpenter of Nazareth, The Father's only Son! Were it table, trunk, or stool Fashioned by His hand and tool, The carpenter of Nazareth Who Heaven and earth doth rule, 'Twere something just to view Handiwork He deigned to do; 'Twould shed on all our daily tasks A glory ever new. For His by axe and saw Would be all without a flaw, Like His patience upon Calvary To magnify the law; And the humblest work ye do, Let it faithful be and true, And be not ye ashamed of it, And it will honour you. Let the Captain of the Host His deeds of prowess boast, And Priest and Prophet claim that they Should be esteemed the most: But He took the burden great Of the worker's toil and sweat, And the carpenter of Nazareth Did labour consecrate. Very dear the Cross of shame Where He took the sinner's blame, And the tomb wherein the Saviour lay, Until the third day came; Yet He bore the self-same load, And He went the same high road, When the carpenter of Nazareth Made common things for God. [It is the fashion now for wits to be] “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.”—Ps. xiv. I. It is the fashion now for wits to be Without a God, Except some Force behind the things we see, Like heat or light or electricity; And one is odd, Among these Oracles, who still believes In any God that thinks or loves or grieves. But there's a spirit, deep in the heart's core, Of reverence, Which somehow will not bow down to adore The mightiest force in Nature; what is more, I have a sense Of being something greater far than those Blind makers of the world which science knows. Worship I must, but may not worship aught Which I can bind And yoke to do me service, having caught The secret of its power, with wonder fraught, But without mind; And while I comprehend it, I must be Higher than that which comprehends not me. You do not need to worship? May be so; I judge you not; Only, they say, the dog that does not know A master, like a savage wolf will grow, Hating his lot, And is a sorry brute, until he find A mightier will than his, and nobler mind. And this would be the hapless lot of men With out God's fear; Their home would soon be as the wild beast's den, All the fierce self resuming sway again; And we should hear But cries of wrath or hunger from the crowd, Or pæans of self-worship vain and loud. Save us from that self-worship! Poor, indeed, Is he who knows Nothing more worthy than himself to lead His heart to purer thought and nobler deed Than ever rose From his self-contemplation, and to rouse The soul to prayers and hymns and holy vows. [Hark! hark! the joyous lark] “The joy of the Lord is your strength.” —Neh. viii. 10. Hark! hark! the joyous lark Greets the dewy dawn of May; Hardly has he time to mark The quivering eyelid of the day, Ere he springs, with fluttering wings, In the rapture of the sight; Ever soaring as he sings, Till he lose himself in light. Heart, heart, how slow thou art With thy morning hymn of praise! Does the love no joy impart Which has lit up all thy days? Why so sad, amid the glad Sunshine, which is God's and thine? Oh, the bliss that may be had, Lost in thoughts of love divine! Why, oh why, sit still and sigh, Moping o'er thy former sin, With the gates of glory nigh Free for thee to enter in? Oh rejoice with heart and voice, Like the bird upon the wing; They who in the Lord rejoice Songs of Heaven to earth shall bring. [He led me out and in] “He shall go in and out, and find pasture.”—John x. 9. He led me out and in, And pasture still I found, For where He led me There He fed me, Although it might seem barren ground. He led me out and in, Yet in the frost and cold, With Him beside me To cheer and guide me, My peace was great as in the Fold. He led me out and in, From many a hallowed spot To buying, selling, Planting, felling, And yet my spirit fainted not. He led me out and in, And if to-day was glad, While to-morrow Brought its sorrow, Yet they both a blessing had. So lead me out and in: Thy guidance, Lord, is best; If Thou chasten 'Tis to hasten My footsteps to the promised rest. And in the fold or out, It shall be well with me Or in sadness, Or in gladness, If only I am still with Thee. [Oh to be like my Lord! Yet must I be] “There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.”— 1 Cor. xii. 4. Oh to be like my Lord! Yet must I be Mine own self too, And to the nature He bestowed on me Be frankly true. The olive fruits not as the clustering vine; Nor may we get Scent of the rose or lily from woodbine, Or violet. The harp may not give forth the trumpet's note; Nor shalt thou bring From pipe or tabor tones that softly float From the harp-string. False to myself, I were not true to Him; Nor should I be More angel, having wings of cherubim Attached to me. All creatures have their natural gift and form In God's great plan, And nought will give the grasshopper or worm Stamp of a man. Even as He made me, so I must be still; Changed, yet the same, Holy in heart, and dutiful in will, And high in aim; Yet true unto the man that once in me Was prone to err; For Faith works not a dull monotony Of character. Earth hath not more variety than Heaven, Though every one To whom the grace of glory shall be given Be like its sun. They differ in their glory, star from star, And in their might, Yet all their varying robes of splendour are His borrowed light. [Be still, and know He doeth all things well] “Commune with your own heart upon Your bed, and be still.”—Ps. iv. 4. Be still, and know He doeth all things well, Working the purpose of His holy will, And if His high designs He do not tell, Till He accomplish them, do thou be still. Why should'st thou strive and fret and fear and doubt, As if His way, being dark, must bode thee ill? If thine own way be clearly pointed out, Leave Him to clear up His, and be thou still. Was ever yet thy trust in Him misplaced? And hoping in Him, did He not fulfil The word on which He causèd thee to rest, Though not as thou had'st thought, perchance? Be still. What if the road be rough which might be smooth? Is not the rough road best for thee, until Thou learn, by patient walking in the truth, To trust and hope in God, and to be still? A little faith is more than clearest views; Would'st thou have ocean like a babbling rill? God without mystery were not good news; Wrestle not with the shadows, but be still. Be still, and know that He is God indeed Who reigns in glory on His holy hill, Yet once upon the Cross did hang and bleed, And heard the people raging—and was still. [Abba, Father! O to think that I] “Because ye are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.”—Gal. iv. 6. Abba, Father! O to think that I, Not in my pride of mind and vanity, But by Thy Spirit unto Thee may cry, Abba, Father! Too well I know, Lord, that I am not meet To get a child's place even beside Thy feet, Yet dost Thou hold me close to Thy heart's beat, Abba, Father! Oh help me, while I am a pilgrim here, Childlike to walk in meekness, love, and fear, For this too is Thy house, and Thou art near, Abba, Father! 'Tis not in me to guide my ways aright, 'Tis not in me to quell the Tempter's might, But Thou wilt me uphold, and give me light, Abba, Father! Thou hast redeemed me; living, I am Thine; And dying, also, Thou art ever mine; Nothing shall part me from the love divine, Abba, Father. Made one with Jesus, who is one with Thee The love that rests on Him o'erflows on me, And O the wonder and the mystery! Abba, Father. [O barren fruitless years] “Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.”—Eph. v. 16. O barren fruitless years, Lean wastes of desert sand— Could I but water you with tears, And make you fruitful land! Oh years that once did reap A crop of sinful deeds— Would I might pile them in a heap, And burn those noxious weeds! Oh years of grief and pain That brought me dull despair— Might I your wine-press tread again, And find the blessing there! Oh mingled thread of days, What have I made of you? What garment have I wrought of praise What robe of honour due? Have ye no help in store, For healing of the mind? Or will it mend the road before To grieve for that behind? Though I must bear the blame Of time misspent and ill, Let me not clothe myself with shame By what remaineth still. [Oft, Lord, I weary in Thy work] “The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”—Matt. xxvi. 41. Oft, Lord, I weary in Thy work, But of Thy work I do not tire, Although I toil from dawn till dark, From matins of the early lark, Until his even-song expire. Ah! who that tends the altar fire, Or ministers the incense due, Or sings Thy praises in the choir, Or publishes good news, could tire Of that he loves so well to do? Sweet is the recompense it brings— The work that with good-will is done; For all the heart with gladness sings, And all the fleeting hours have wings, And all the day is full of sun. And if he labour not in vain, If souls are by his message stirred, If he can comfort grief and pain, Or bring repentant tears like rain By force of his entreating word, The hand may weary at its task, And weary he may drag his feet, The weary frame may long to bask In needful rest; but do not ask The heart to weary of its beat. [Lo! this our marching order still] “Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.”—Ex. xiv. 15. Lo! this our marching order still, As on that day of God's great power, Forward! it is the Master's will, The Saviour's hour. Go forward, trusting in the Lord, New trials will bring mercies new, For certain, He that gives the word Will go with you. Behind, the foe is hastening on, Eager his purpose to fulfil, And Forward safety lies, but none In standing still. Across your path a stormy sea Is breaking on a waste of sand; But God's ways on the waters be As on the land. And thirst and hunger soon shall make Your heart, in deserts parched, to sink; Yet there ye from His hand shall take Both food and drink. Forward! He will be with you there Wherever He would have you go, And to your fear and your despair A path will show. O look not back, nor hunger for The coarse abundance of the Nile; Think rather of the yoke ye bore A cruel while. There is no freedom and no peace Except in making progress true, And every new stage will increase His grace to you. Forward! to learn the higher truth Through harder tasks of duty done, What though the way be rough or smooth If Life be won? [The Master comes, and calls for thee] “The Master is here, and calleth for thee.”—John xi. 28. The Master comes, and calls for thee: Let Him not wait outside the gate, Knocking to get an entrance free, For that were but scant courtesy. It is thyself He fain would meet, Not raiment fair, nor braided hair, Nor dainty hands, nor sandalled feet, Nor features framed His eyes to meet. Just as thou art, go straight to Him In sorrow's dress of carelessness, It will not matter what thy trim, Or that thine eyes with tears are dim. Haste to Him, with thy grieving heart And vexèd mind, in Him to find Help for the bruised and wounded part— The mercy of His healing art. Thou needest Him, He calls for thee, For when thy need is worst, indeed, He comes in watchful care to be The help of thine extremity. Oh would'st thou strength and comfort get Make no delay, but go thy way, Pour out thine heart to Him, and let His love be poured out into it. [There where the hosts of darkness lie] “Fight the good fight of faith.”— 1 Tim. vi. 12. There where the hosts of darkness lie, And the brave battle rages high, Give me my post to live or die With fearless heart: Thou, Lord, alone may'st plan the fight, Alone array the battle right, Mine but to do with all my might My little part. It may be just to watch and wait, Like sentinel to keep the gate, And so outwit the cunning sleight Of crafty foe; Or it may be, 'mid dust and smoke, To ply the sword with thrust and stroke Until the bands of sin are broke, Or lying low. Perchance 'twill be a humbler post, Only to serve Thy chosen host Who fight the battle, never lost, In strength divine; And sword or spear I may not wield, But travel o'er the stricken field, And comfort to the wounded yield Who thirst or pine. Not mine to choose my work or fate, Whether to die with hope elate, Or live the triumph to relate In after years. Enough to battle in Thy name, For truth and right, but not for fame, And ne'er Thy holy cause ashame By coward fears. And if it be my lot to fall Unnoticed and unknown of all, Named only in the great roll-call, So let it be: Give me my weapon and my task— Tumbrel, or sword, or waterflask, To know my post is all I ask, And to serve Thee. [Light the lamp that burneth cheery] “Ye are the light of the world.”— Matt. v. 14. Light the lamp that burneth cheery When the nights are dark and long And the storm without is eerie And the household gathers near ye For work and the tale and song: In the world are sin and sadness, Bringing misery and madness; Light your home with Christian gladness. Light the lamps through all the city, Twinkling in the crowded street, Where the foolish and the witty, And the wretched seeking pity, And rogues and righteous meet; Keep your lights there clearly shining, Truth and right and love combining, All the common highways lining. Light the lamp, oh, keep it blazing, Where the storm is raging high, And the shipwrecked soul is gazing To the clouds that are erasing All the star-guides in the sky; Through the tempest and the terror, And the darkness and the horror, Flash the glory from thy mirror. Where our lights thus shining rightly In the home and in the street Through the gloom that cometh nightly, And our beacons gleaming brightly Where perilous breakers beat, Little then should men be needing All our arguing and pleading, With that life-light God ward leading. [Looking unto Jesus] “Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.”—Heb. xii. 2. Looking unto Jesus, Healing I shall find For the broken spirit, And the bruisèd mind— Yet I gaze on daily, Till my eyes grow dim, Looking unto any Rather than to Him! Looking unto Jesus, I shall learn the road That the soul must travel, Going home to God— Yet I lag and linger, Till I scarce can see My guide and sweet companion Beckoning to me! Looking unto Jesus, I behold the heights Gleaming in the glory Of Love's undying lights— Yet my heart unmovèd Cares not to aspire, Nor for all their splendour Would be any higher! What is it that ails me? Why am I so dead That looking unto Jesus Lifts not up my head? And my heart so wanders, Caring not to see Him, its fount of gladness?— Jesus, look on me. [Ah! you bring money in your hand] “Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?”—Prov. xvii. 16. Ah! you bring money in your hand, Fain to buy wisdom? You are clear There's nothing gold will not command; It answereth to all things here; And you wish wisdom, as is fit, And will not grudge the cost of it. For you are rich, and you have store Of guineas, dollars, and rupees, And bonds and shares, that yield you more Than you can squander well with ease.— God help you, man! You could not buy An ounce of wisdom with them. Try. Lo! here are books where men have found Of wisdom many a precious gem; And you may have them, gilt and bound, But not the wisdom wrapt in them. Yet buy them, fool: so men have got Credit for wisdom they had not. And likely that is all you want— The credit, not the thing itself. Then hold your peace, and do not vaunt, And you may purchase with your pelf, If you have wit your tongue to rule, A name for wisdom, though a fool. There! go your way, and with your gold, Buy food and raiment, house and land; The best things are not bought and sold, There is no price that will command Wisdom, or peace, or love, or health; And you are poor with all your wealth. [Learn, O my soul, to use] “All things work together for good to them that love God.”—Rom. viii. 28. Learn, O my soul, to use Experience thou hast got, Nor any thread to lose God wove into thy lot, Nor yet to pick and choose What pleaseth thee or not. He leads thee by His way, That thou may'st truly learn; Gives thee thy work each day, Thy daily wage to earn; It is not idle play, But matter of concern. The error of thy thought Had yet some truth to teach; The sorrow of thy lot Some wisdom had to preach; They could not else be brought So well within thy reach. There's light wrapt in the cloud, And heat in frosts and snows, A voice that speaketh loud Where silence awful grows, And life that doth enshroud Itself in death's repose. No lesson, then, refuse, Which love to thee hath given; If here it find no use Thou'lt find it yet in heaven; God's teaching does not lose, Hid in the heart like leaven. [One writ a plea for Faith, and put] “Of making many books there is no end.”—Eccles. xii. 12. One writ a plea for Faith, and put His thoughts into a printed book; I read it that I might confute My doubts, and all my faith it shook. Another and another still I tried, and all the more I read The less I could believe, until A mist of darkness wrapt my head. They dried up all my Jacob's wells; They broke the faithful shepherd's rod; They blurred the gracious miracles Which are the signature of God. And hour by hour, and day by day My heart grew colder than before, And for one doubt they took away They left suggestion of a score. In trouble, then, and fear I sought The Man who taught in Galilee, And peace unto my soul was brought, And all my faith came back to me. Oh times of weak and wavering faith That labour pleas in His defence, Ye only dim Him with your breath: He is His own best evidence. [Sometimes my heart with hope is filled] “It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.”—Lam. iii. 26. Sometimes my heart with hope is filled Full as the summer day with sun, And eagerly my glebe is tilled, And strenuous work is done; Only I fret at all delay, And fain would haste the expected day Of fruit, which seemeth far away; And patience I have none. Sometimes with patience slow I plod Through the long hours, from morn till night, Complaining not of man or God, Yet feeling no delight;— A sodden spirit, bound to cope With daily toil I may not drop, But without any heart or hope, Or any joy or might. Ah! hope that hath no patient force Works in the end but stir and fret, And hopeless patience runs a course Of deadness and regret; Oh for a Spirit, strong and free, Fount of a larger life in me, That waits and works and hopes to see The great Salvation yet. [Alone, to face the Powers of darkness here] “Ye shall leave Me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.” —John xvi. 32. Alone, to face the Powers of darkness here, Forsaken of the friends He held so dear; Yet never less alone, for God was near! So in the waste, dim wilderness at first His work began, with hunger faint and thirst, And the fell Tempter fain to do his worst. Lonely His sun rose, lonely too it set, But round it trailing clouds of glory met, For God was with Him, and His peace was great. Not in the forest grows the noblest tree; All highest life a solitude must be, Apart, with only God for company. But when forsaken, we are haply thrown Upon the Father's loving care alone, And left to lean against the eternal throne. How should we fear if He be at our side? Or falter if His face He do not hide? Or feel alone if He with us abide? [Bright and glad the time has been] “No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.”—Heb. xii. 11. Bright and glad the time has been When Thou gavest me repose, Lying on the pastures green Where the quiet water flows, While the song-birds filled the air, And the voice of pain was mute, And the bloom was passing fair; But it yielded little fruit. Dark and sad the hours have been In the Valley and Shadow of Death, Where no light mine eyes have seen But the far, cold stars of faith, And my heart, with haunting fears, Almost sank into despair; Yet the harvest of my years Mostly has been gathered there. Not where pleasures spring up rife Do our richest fruits abound; But where sorrow of our life Waters with its tears the ground. There we learn to look above For our happiness and peace, Learn the comfort of Thy love, And in life and strength increase. [Were there no oxen feeding in the stall] “Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox.”—Prov. xiv. 4. Were there no oxen feeding in the stall, The crib were clean: But without oxen harvest would be small, Housekeeping lean: Wherefore we may not be too prim and nice; There is no good that doth not cost a price. Were there no children in the house, it were Dainty and trim; But without children, lo! the hearth were bare And cold and dim: Better their laughter than a chamber neat, For only in their mirth is home complete. Were there no thinking, there would be no doubt To vex the heart; But life were brutish if it were without Its thinking part: And to be Godlike we must risk the chance Of doubting much that we believed once. Were there no stir among the dry bones, then Were there much peace; But if the Spirit move not, Death's dull reign Would never cease; Better fanatic follies than to lie Cold and unmoved in starched propriety. Something, I reckon, we have still to give In sacrifice That we may richly grow, and greatly live; And 'tis a vice To grudge what makes our being large and full For the small order of a frigid rule. [Jesus, in the deep, dark night] “Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.”—Job xiii. 15. Jesus, in the deep, dark night, Send Thy light to guide my way: Thou canst give the blind their sight, Thou canst turn the night to day: Yet if dark my path must be, Let me still hold fast to Thee. Jesus, in the hour of grief, Send the Comforter to cheer; He can give the heart relief, He can wipe away the tear: Yet if sorrow be my lot, Let me be still and murmur not. Jesus, in the war of life, Be Thou ever near to save; Thou canst shield from perils rife, Thou canst pluck me from the grave. Yet if I am doomed to death, Mine be still the fight of Faith. Am I abject thus to lie At His mercy? surely no: Did He not in mercy die, Death for me to overthrow? And can I doubt the love which He Witnessed on His cross for me? 'Tis the sun that brings the cloud, Shadows of the light are born; Let the clouds and shadows shroud Life to me in grief forlorn, Still I know 'twas love that wrought All the sorrow of my lot. [Whatsoe'er I be or do] “Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.”—Luke xii. 1. Whatsoe'er I be or do, Let me honest be and true; Never wear a false pretence, Never speak with double sense, Claim a grace I have not got, Or look the thing that I am not. Am I common clay at best? Be the common clay confessed; If for something better fit, Let me roundly stand to it; Saint or sinner, why should I Ever be a paltry lie? Copper cheaply bought and sold, Pass it not for burnished gold; Nor let him that doeth well, Call himself a child of Hell, As if falsehoods should be given In tribute to the God of Heaven. Hence with oily phrase and smooth! True men know the ring of truth; Think not god can be deceived, He is only wroth and grieved; Play not Publican to be So much more a Pharisee. [Not to be served, O Lord, but to serve man] “The Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.”— Mark x. 45. Not to be served, O Lord, but to serve man All that I can, And as I minister unto his need, Serve Thee indeed: So runs the law of Love that hath been given To earth from Heaven. What, if the task appointed me be mean? Wert Thou not seen To gird Thee with the towel, as was meet, To wash the feet Of Thy disciples, whom Thou would'st befriend Unto the end? For meanest work becomes the noblest part, When a great heart, Pitiful, stoops to comfort our distress, Or to impress A sealing kiss on penitence, fresh clad In raiment sad. And if the wanderer's feet be soiled and sore, So much the more He needs a tender hand to cleanse and heal, And make him feel There is no task that love will shrink to do Life to renew. [Laying the foundations] “Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.”—Heb. vi. 1, 2. Laying the foundations O'er and o'er again!— Calling sinners to repent, And believe that Christ was sent To die for love of men; Good are the foundations, But thou shalt do well To build thereon, by truth and right, A spacious mansion of delight Wherein thy soul may dwell. More than mere foundations Is the house we need; Lay them well, and leave them there, They hold only cellars where Life is cramped indeed. Yet we lay foundations O'er and o'er again, Making the grand Gospel stale By our telling of the tale To the sons of men. On, then, to perfection, Truth is infinite; Be not babes with milk content, Take the strong meat that is meant For the man of might. Lay not still foundations, Seek the higher faith, And a larger life to know, For the soul that does not grow Is not far from death. [I have heard a cry of wailing] “Surely I come quickly. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.”—Rev. xxii. 20. I have heard a cry of wailing Running through the troubled years, As of expectation failing, As of sorrow unavailing, As of rising doubts and fears. For the Church is weary, waiting 'Mid the world's unceasing hum, And its scorning and its hating, And its fury unabating; And the Lord is slow to come. Ah! the thoughtlessness of sorrow! Well for us He came not soon, Well He cometh not to-morrow, Well He lets us wait, and borrow Light of many a waning moon. True, the Church is sighing, weeping: But her work, how is it done? Is she well His vineyard keeping? What of harvest is she reaping? Has the world for Him been won? And the Virgins, are they waking? Are the Talents growing more? Or the Servants merry-making, And of drunken feast partaking, While He lingers near the door? Was there ever in her story Any hour of golden fame 'Mong the ages, young or hoary, When His coming back in glory Would not cover her with shame? Yet I hear the voice of wailing Still above the busy hum, As of expectation failing, As of sorrow unavailing— Ah! the Lord is slow to come! [What shall I do for all the grace and truth] “What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me?”—Ps. cxvi. 12. What shall I do for all the grace and truth That I have known E'er since the error of a wayward youth Led me, alone, Forth on a way, alas! that was not good, Through bog and quagmire and be wildering wood, Where I did seek for bread, and found not food, Only a stone? Yet mercy compassed me, and left me not To that scant diet in the desert got. What shall I do to make up for the loss Of those bad days, When I had turned from Thy redeeming Cross To vain, proud ways That made my life a barren land of drought, Wet by no dews, though wrapt in mists of doubt, Which left no warmth within, nor light without, Nor prayer nor praise? Yet goodness followed me, and love divine, And still Thy Spirit pleaded, Lord, with mine. Oh, I can nothing do, but only give Myself to Thee, Now to be Thine, whether I die or live: And give Thou me An heart to love Thee, and Thy will to do, And strength to walk before Thee meek and true, And the great faith that maketh all things new; And let me be True to the consecration and the vow, Sealed with the sacred baptism on my brow. [All the springs of God are found] “All my springs are in Thee.”— Ps. lxxxvii. 7. All the springs of God are found Here within this hallowed ground. Founts to quench the thirst within, Or to cleanse the soul from sin, Streams of healing to restore Hearts that have been wounded sore, Living water making glad All the weary and the sad. Whatsoe'er our ailments are, We have not to travel far To supply the need of each— Here to get the dumb their speech, There restore the blind their sight, Or the palsied hand its might; For all springs of God are here That His glory may appear. It hath pleased the Father so To all fulness we should grow, Where His fulness doth abide In the Christ, the crucified— Fulness of our life and health, Peace and hope and joy and wealth, That they who on His name do call, May find in Him their all in all. [If I had got the cup] “Charity vaunteth not itself.”—1 Cor. xiii. 4. If I had got the cup, Which some have had to drain, Unto the brim filled up With pleasure or with pain, I might have done as badly As they who did the worst; I might have plunged as madly Into evil from the first. Who knows himself, and yet Will say he could not be Entangled in the net Of opportunity? Or that the storm, assailing The virtue he achieves, Would smite it unavailing, And only rob the leaves? The ill that one has wrought Is mostly what is known, But not the fight he fought, Or grief he may have shown. And none are evil wholly, Or evil all at once; Lord, keep me meek and lowly, I wot not what may chance. [He had not gone to ply the net] “I go a fishing.”—John xxi. 3. He had not gone to ply the net Upon the lake of Galilee, As he went to Gennesaret The risen Lord to see. And as the weary hours crept by Where once such blissful days he had, His soul with haunting memory And misery was mad. It all came back—the happy past,— How Jesus once had named him Rock, And then the end of all at last,— The maid and crowing cock. How could he meet the Master's sight, Whom he with curses did deny? Yet if he met Him not that night, 'Twere better he should die. Then swiftly striding to the shore He leapt into the swaying boat, To haul a net, or ply an oar, And rid him of his thought. O breaking heart! that sought in toil The shame and anguish to forget, Thy Lord was seeking thee mean while To ply thee with His net. And in our failure and despair, When hardly we dare think or feel, Lo! He is looking for us there, Our aching wounds to heal. [What am I that there should be] “When I consider Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; what is man, that Thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that Thou visitest him?” —Ps. viii. 3, 4. What am I that there should be Thought or care in heaven for me, That the Father's heart should long To turn my sorrow into song, Or that Christ should die to win Such a soul as mine from sin? What am I? A pigmy form, Feeble as a poor earth-worm; Fain to make a little stir Like the chirping grasshopper: How should He that ruleth all Care for anything so small? Does He measure, then, by size, Not as we are good and wise? Is the senseless lump of earth More to Him than manly worth? Or the raging of the sea More than reasoned thought in me? Nay, such measurement were mean: He is great whose soul is clean; He is mighty who has Mind Nature's Force to loose and bind; He is worth the saving cross, Whose death were an eternal loss. [Gird your loins about with truth] “Quit you like men: be strong.”— 1 Cor. xvi. 13. Gird your loins about with truth; Life will not go always smooth, Singing lightsome songs of youth: Play the man! Learn with justice to keep pace, Spurning what is vile and base, And bravely ever set your face To play the man. Fear not what the world may say, Hold the strait and narrow way, In the open light of day. And play the man. They will call you poor and weak, Being merciful and meek: Heed them not, but stedfast seek To play the man. It needeth courage to be true, And patiently the right to do, Loving him that wrongeth you— Play the man! Trust in God, and let them mock; They will break, as they have broke, Like the waves upon the rock— Play the man! [When I forget Thee, like a sun-parched land] “This do in remembrance of Me.” Luke xxii. 19. When I forget Thee, like a sun-parched land Which neither rain nor dew from heaven hath wet, So my soul withers, and I understand Wherefore Thou gavest me this high command Not to forget. When I forget the death which is my life, How weak I am! how full of fear and fret! How my heart wavers in a constant strife With mists and clouds that gather round me rife, When I forget! Ah, how can I forget? And yet my heart By dull oblivious thought is hard beset, Bred in the street, the meadow, or the mart: Yet Thou my strength and life and glory art, Though I forget. I will remember all Thy Love divine; Oh meet Thou with me where Thy saints are met, Revive me with the holy bread and wine, And may my love, O God, lay hold on Thine, And ne'er forget. And not to-day alone, but evermore Oh let me feel the burden of the debt— The load of sorrow that the Master bore, The load of goodness that He keeps in store, And not forget! [Bind on me, Lord, the new law given] “A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.”—John xiii. 34. Bind on me, Lord, the new law given To bind and blend the earth with heaven, And oh that I may love Thee, even As Thou hast lovèd me! They serve Thee best who love Thee most, They love Thee best who serve the host Of weak and erring ones and lost, For so Thou lovedst me. If they reject me and despise, If I am hateful in their eyes, Let me with kindness them surprise, For so Thou lovedst me. If they be worthless, so was I; And yet for me did Jesus die; Oh let me not the cross deny Which proved Thy love to me. And to the blind it will be sight, And to the weak it will be might, The love that bringeth health and light, As Thine, Lord, did to me. [O heart, my heart, that burdened art and breaking] “Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord.”—Ps. cxxx. 1. O heart, my heart, that burdened art and breaking With sharp remorse For faithlessness and failure, and forsaking Of the right course! Heart, O my heart, In sorry plight thou art. O heart, my heart, that hardly dares remember Thy guilty past, Or look into full many a secret chamber Thou had'st locked fast! Yet heart, my heart, They were but closed in part. O heart, my heart, thy sin might be forgotten, But could not hide; He knoweth what is sound, and what is rotten With lust or pride. Heart, O my heart, Yet will it sting and smart. O God, my God, wilt Thou forgive a sinner Such deep offence, So near his end, and yet but a beginner In penitence? God, O my God, Send healing with Thy rod. [Lord, there is nothing I can give] “Freely ye have received, freely give.” —Matt. x. 8. Lord, there is nothing I can give Which Thou hast not; For all from Thee I did receive, Which I have got; And even the very life I live Thou did'st allot: How could I grudge to give Thee back The overflow I do not lack? Thine are the silver and the gold, The treasure Thine; They are a trust for Thee I hold, They are not mine; And oh, if they might help to mould The life divine! What higher honour could they meet Than to inlay the Mercy-seat? There is no price for what is best, It is not bought; Who would in heavenly things invest Gets them for nought, And debtor unto Thee must rest, Or have them not; But though Thy mercies be not sold, Yet we may serve Thee with our gold. So let us bring it to the Lord, For it is His; And that corrupteth which we hoard, And wasted is; But truly, well, and safely stored, When it can bless The sick, and poor, and weak oppressed, And bring unto the weary rest. [He spake without one shade of guilt or blame] “I have glorified Thee on the earth: and now, O Father, glorify Thou Me.”— John xvii. 4, 5. He spake without one shade of guilt or blame To touch His heart with penitence or shame; “My Father, I have glorified Thy name, Now glorify Thou Me.” No lips but His a word like that might dare, So meek and bold, so free from doubt and care; God spake to God, and yet he spake in prayer, As none might pray but He. Ah! well for us that He could justly plead In this high strain, and claim as rightful meed The glory due to perfect word and deed, And tried, yet sinless thought; For in His friends He would be paid His debt, And on their heads He would this glory set; But for Himself, it was a nobler yet— A crown of thorns—He sought. We look back from the verge of life, and see Error and failure, sin and misery; And we can only cry, ah! woe is me! Be merciful, O God! But now we dare pray, glorify Thy Son, Crown the meek Victor who the fight hath won, There are a thousand crowned in crowning One Who bore our heavy load. [Oh we boast us of our law] “Not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.”—Rom. ii. 13. Oh we boast us of our law, Glory in our gospel light, Pity those who cannot draw Fresh the living water bright; We are favoured, we are blest, We have heard the joyful sound, We are sons of God confessed, We are free who once were bound; Bless the Lord who unto us Is in mercy plenteous. Ah! but what if we are still Walking on in sinful ways, Keeping a rebellious will, Lusting for the world's poor praise? What, if we are growing old, None the wiser for the rod? What if we have faith in gold, Not in either man or God? Shall we praise the Lord that we Have nor faith nor charity? Not the hearer of the word, But the doer, he is just. He who, knowing not the Lord, Keepeth yet his soul from rust, He who doeth what is right, Bravely stands by what is true, Faithful to his inner light, Dark although it seem to you— He is nearer God than they Who know the truth, and disobey. [Ah me! the secret sin] “Cleanse thou me from secret faults.”— Ps. xix. 12. Ah me! the secret sin That lurks and works within The fair, false heart which gives it willing room! How sure it bringeth blight, Like nipping frost by night That withers in the spring its early bloom! Oh hidden, cherished lust, Like a small speck of rust On the sheathed sword—known but to God and me; What if the weapon good Unto the sheath be glued On battle day, and I am shamed by thee? Oh cleanse it from my heart, And let me play my part And put away what Thou would'st take away; Leave not the sharp-toothed moth That is devouring both The garment and the soul it doth array. [Not one regretful look behind] “Truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God.”—Heb. xi. 15, 16. Not one regretful look behind Lord, would I cast, Nor hanker with a faithless mind For the dead Past: Who would recall the troubled night When joying in the morning light? Not back again, not back again To that old road So haunted by the fear of men, No fear of God— The hungry wilderness of self, Whose love was the base love of pelf! Forward, my way lies forward still, To get release From sinful stain, and wayward will, And find the peace Where flesh with spirit shall agree, And God shall not be shamed in me. My work is here, but not my rest, And not my home, And not the wealth I would invest For life to come; I have my treasures hid above, And usury of faith and love. And if to-night mine inn be good, I shall be glad; But if to-morrow's fare be rude, And lodging bad, It shall be so much easier then To strike my tent, and on again. But never backward may I look, Or feel regret That I the way of sin forsook, And heavenward set My face to find the life in God, And comfort of His staff and rod. [Higher still, and higher!] “If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.”— Col. iii. 1. Higher still, and higher! Oh to leave the clouds below, And the creeping mists that throw Doubt on all the way we go As we would aspire Higher still, and higher! Higher still, and higher! Ah! how little way I make, Plunging where the black bogs quake, Slowly hewing through the brake Tangled with old briar!— Higher still, and higher! Higher still, and higher! Courage! look not down to see How high thy footing now may be, Upward set thy face where He Calls thee to come nigher, Higher still, and higher. Higher still, and higher! Lo! the sun is sinking fast, And lengthening shades are round thee cast. Let not thy heart fail at the last; 'Tis no time to tire— Higher still, and higher! Higher still, and higher! Sweet the air is, pure and clear, And the Lord is ever near Yonder where the songs I hear And the golden lyre— Higher still, and higher. Higher still, and higher! What, if Death be standing right In thy way, and dreadful night? All beyond is life and light, And thy soul's desire— Higher still, and higher! [Dear to me the Church of Christ] “How amiable are Thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts.”—Ps. lxxxiv. 1. Dear to me the Church of Christ, Sweet the memories lingering there, Sweet the place of solemn tryst, Sweet the house of prayer, Where the glory ever pours Through the everlasting doors. Solace of the spirit vexed, Refuge of the contrite heart, Helper of the mind perplexed Evermore thou art: Oh that I might always dwell Where I hear Thy Sabbath bell! There they brought me when a child For the cleansing of the Lord; There I came with garment soiled Of mine own accord, Broken in my pride of strength, Weary of the world at length. Not the tinted lights that shine Softly through the pictured pane, But the light of love divine Flooding all thy fane, That is what entrances me, Hushed in its high mystery. Not the word the preacher speaks Pleading in his Master's name, But the still small Voice that seeks Way ward hearts to tame, That is what I love to hear, Then I know that God is near. [Hast thou wandered far, my child?] “Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.”—Prov. vii. 27. Hast thou wandered far, my child? Whither did'st thou go, That thy feet are so defiled, And thy pace so slow? Hast thou been among the wild Mountains and the snow? Mountain steep and snows were sweet For me to tread again; But I've been on the stony street, Among the haunts of men; Better to have put my feet Within the lion's den. In the haunts of men are found Kind and loving hearts, Wisdom springing from the ground, All entrancing arts, Homes that do with peace abound, Songs in many parts. Nay, but beauty at the door Called me to come in Where the vine-blood stained the floor, And the song was sin; And another victim more Perished so within. But thou hast returned at last, Sad and penitent; Snaky arms hast from thee cast, All their power is spent: 'Twas an evil dream, the Past; Wake up innocent. Ah! the Past still cleaves to me With a leprous force— Tainted thought that will not be Cleansed out by remorse; And the goodness that I see Makes the anguish worse; [Thy Kingdom come—the reign of truth and right] “Thy kingdom come.”—Matt. vi. 10. Thy Kingdom come—the reign of truth and right, Where lies, amazèd at the searching light, Creep back into the darkness out of sight: Thy Kingdom come. Thy Kingdom come, when Thou shalt reign alone, With all the graven gods of stock or stone, Like broken potsherds strewn around Thy throne: Thy Kingdom come. Thy Kingdom come, when wrath and war shall cease And swords be reaping-hooks for tasks of peace, And love shall rule, and wisdom shall increase: Thy Kingdom come. Thy Kingdom come, when all shall do Thy will, And gladly haste Thy purpose to fulfil, And faith take meekly all life's good and ill: Thy Kingdom come. The Kingdom come, where peace and pity meet, And let Thy folk who know Thy mercy-seat Like pity show to those who them entreat: Thy Kingdom come. Thy Kingdom come, Lord, in this heart of mine, Set there Thy throne, and reign in right divine, And make me wholly true, and wholly Thine: Thy Kingdom come. [Waiting for the day to dawn] “Willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.”— 2 Cor. v. 8. Waiting for the day to dawn, Peering through the darkness far, Here and there a cloud withdrawn, Here and there a star. Dark and silent is the hour, Not a whispering wind is heard, Not an insect in a flower, Not a twittering bird. Long the night has been and slow, Spite of good, remembered words, And my heart is faint and low With the loosening cords. Who is with me? Only Thou, Thou, my never-failing Friend: Lay Thy hand upon my brow, Hold it to the end. Lo! is that a gleam of morn Touching yonder trailing cloud, White and ghostly and forlorn, Pallid as a shroud? Yet within that cloud there lie All the glories of the day— Light, and life, and song; and I Long for them and pray. So I wait with failing strength, Give me, Lord, the grace I need, That I yet may die at length Into life indeed. [Bid me not look in heaven for only rest] “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.”—John v. 17. Bid me not look in heaven for only rest, Well-earned because the battle has been won. My fight has been a poor one at the best, And now I trust to have it better done Where never sets the sun. What need of rest, except to be refreshed For further work, and carry on our task, No more with sin enfeebled and enmeshed? Eternal idleness I do not ask, Nor in such bliss could bask. So many failures I have made on earth, So many hours have wasted of my day, So little gained of true abiding worth, So oft have erred, and gone so far astray From the one Living Way! Oh to redeem the time that I have lost, To right whatever wrong I may have done, To publish peace unto the tempest-tossed, To bring back hope to some despairing one, Until there shall be none! Who knows? The Father worketh hitherto, And Christ, whom I would serve in love and fear, Went not away to rest Him, but to do What could be better done in heaven than here, And bring to all good cheer. And I would work with Him whose mercy lasts For ever, and His love is everywhere, Who preached to spirits in prison, and daily casts His nets where souls are sinking in despair: My heaven were with Him there. Perchance, in that new life we shall be born Children at first, and have to slowly grow, And its unfathomable wonders learn, Like children, singing gladly as we go Where living waters flow. Yet must we come to manhood's better hour, And have our work appointed us to do, And do it with more heart, and hope, and power, And fresh as with eternal morning dew That doth our life renew. At any rate, to sit with folded palms On listless thrones, with crowns of shining gold, Or touch the harp unto the voice of psalms, With hearts that are to sinners hard and cold, Is not the hope I hold. [Oh, are they near to us or far away?] “If it were not so. I would have told you.”—John xiv. 2. Oh, are they near to us or far away? And know they how our eyes grow dim with tears? And can they hear what breaking hearts here say, Our dead who sleep through all the waiting years? Not vain the task to sweep the ocean's floor, Or sift the slag and cinders of the moon, Tell what the sun for fuel has in store, Or when eclipse shall darken it at noon: But dream not thou the great sealed stone to roll From the grave's mouth, and to light up its gloom, Or to unwrap the cerements of the soul, And search the close-kept secret of the tomb. They may be far away—I cannot tell— And nothing of my grief can hear or see; They may be near me, holden by a spell Which, hard on them, will yield no help to me. But near or far, the spirit is ensphered Alone and silent, till it find again A body, and appear as it appeared When its haunts were among the sons of men. Yet Thou that art the Lord of death and life, Wilt Thou not clothe them with familiar frames, That we may know belovèd friend or wife, And clasp their hands, and call them by their names? Changed as Thou wert, Thy friends discovered Thee By the nail-prints and by the wounded side; And Thou wilt leave some mark on us that we Amid the glory may be verified. Thou would'st have told us had it not been so, Thou wilt not let us yearn for some dear face, Or voice remembered fondly long ago, To make Thy heaven to us a lonely place. Oh rich in hope the things which Thou hast told, Rich too the hope of what Thou hast concealed; And having faith in Thee, Lord, I would hold The hope unspoken as the hope revealed. [O'er land and sea love follows with fond prayers] “I exhort therefore, that, first of all, prayers be made for all men.”—1 Tim. ii. 1. O'er land and sea love follows with fond prayers Its dear ones in their troubles, griefs, and cares; There is no spot On which it does not drop this tender dew, Except the grave and there it bids adieu, And prayeth not. Why should that be the only place uncheered By prayer, which to our hearts is most endeared, And sacred grown? Living, we sought for blessings on their head; Why should our lips be sealed when they are dead, And we alone? Idle? their doom is fixed? Ah! who can tell? Yet, were it so, I think no harm could well Come of my prayer: And oh the heart, o'erburdened with its grief, This comfort needs, and finds therein relief From its despair. Shall God be wroth because we love them still, And call upon His love to shield from ill Our dearest, best, And bring them home, and recompense their pain, And cleanse their sin, if any sin remain, And give them rest? Nay, I will not believe it. I will pray As for the living, for the dead each day. They will not grow Less meet for heaven when followed by a prayer To speed them home, like summer-scented air From long ago. Who shall forbid the heart's desires to flow Beyond the limit of the things we know? In heaven above The incense that the golden censers bear Is the sweet perfume from the saintly prayer Of trust and love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A HERETIC AND OTHER POEMS A HERETIC Yes, he was there at the grave, and we Eyed each other with meaning look, Wondering what he had come to see; Yet we pitied him, too, ere long, as he Stood by himself alone, and shook While the earth fell dull on the coffin lid. But why had he come where he was not bid? He might have known he would mar our meeting, Who neither its love nor its grief could share. And how could we give him a word of greeting?— He! the last man that we looked for there. So, lonely and silent he took his place, And silent and lonely he went his way. But what was the shadow that lay on his face? Was it, maybe, some touch of the tender grace, And the lingering love of a former day? It puzzled us then; but we let him go Lonely away, with his head bent low. They had been friends in youth, had read Together the words of the classic dead— Epic and drama and lyric bold, And sage discourse of the wise and true, And the fabled tale, and the legend old Where the faiths of a rank religion grew; And many a close-writ notebook told How well the past life of the world they knew, How much of the gods and the wits of Greece, And of Rome with its arts of war and peace. Oft wandering, too, by brake and brook, Or seated on lichened boulder stone, They read as in an open book How earth was fashioned, and rocks had grown, By frost and ice, by fire and flood, From the weltering slime of the primal mud; And what the records of nature bore Of the struggle of Life from less to more— What mosses in the swamps grew rank, What fishes stirred the long sea-weeds, What great beasts on the river's bank Went crashing through the giant reeds. So they had searched, through ages vast, The strange graveyards of the buried Past. Later, their converse had mostly been With Fathers and Schoolmen and knotty Creeds, And Councils, where subtlest wits were seen Busily sowing the fruitful seeds Of faith and doubt, and love and hate, And all that chequers our mortal fate. The fall too of Empire, the dark sunset Of learning, through lust of power and gold, The mighty Popes, and the mightier yet Who wrought reform in the days of old. And martyr-sorrows by fire and cord, And the glory and triumph of God's pure Word; These, too, they pondered, laying up store Of late born science and old world lore. So had the Kirk for her sons designed That the rich in faith should be full in mind. They settled near each other,—this, In a rural parish of easy bliss, That, in a neighbouring city, rife With the questionings of a keen young life— They walked together side by side, And each of the other would speak with pride: How one had treasures of learning vast, And one had thoughts that were sure to cast A larger light upon life and death, And gird up the loins of our dwindling faith. Brothers first in the toils of youth, Brothers now in the bonds of truth, Each in the other was fain to see The powers of the world that was to be. But one man like a tree shall stand, Leafing and fruiting year by year, And cling to his little patch of land, And cast a shade for the lazy steer, With no more change than the passing breeze Makes when it tosses the creaking bough; And prosperous, plentiful, full of ease, To-morrow he shall be the same as now. Another shall flow like a freshening stream, Flashing there where the sunbeam flies, Eddying here in a brooding dream, And all its life in its movement lies; This the law of his being strange, Ever he grows by flux and change. What would you? Nature will have her way; Will mend by night what you mar by day, And laughs at the man that would say her Nay. Tree cannot pluck up its roots and go, Restless stream cannot cease to flow, Each must obey the high Law, given To the things of earth by the Lord of Heaven. And some read many books, and grow Wiser and better by all they know; From thoughts of other men their own Get warmth and colour and richer tone, And what is old they make as new From the shaping mind it passes through: It was but a seed when it was sown, But a goodly plant in their souls has grown, For all that they gather with patient strife Is penetrated with mystic life. Another shall read and heap up lore, Yet be no wiser than ever before; Folios mighty he knows by rote, And each edition, its date, and size, Page and paragraph well can quote, And where a word on the margin lies; Hardly a question up shall spring, Sudden as startled bird on wing, But a loaded sentence is up to sight With a score of quotations to settle it right; Yet never a thought of his own has he, Nor any mind but memory. So these twain took their several ways, Though each was full of the other's praise, Keeping ever a constant heart, While drifting more and more far apart. For he whom we laid in the grave that day— Honoured and wept for his service—learned, By change and sorrow, the sacred way Which the dull, slow book-worm never discerned. He had come among us in brilliant youth, Eloquent, earnest, eager to tell Just the old story we held for truth, And we praised him for it, and liked him well; Praised the round periods shaped with care, And the brilliant tropes that he did not spare, And liked the man and his modest air. Praised him and liked him! What would he more? Welcome his knock at the cottage door, Welcome at school to the children gay, Welcome his presence at wedding feast, Welcome where sickness restless lay, Welcome as Comforter, Prophet and Priest— What would he more than already he had? And why should his countenance now be sad? Say, you are set to pasture sheep— Taught where the short, sweet grasses grow, And the tender ewes and the lambs to keep From the wily fox and the hooded crow, And how to shift them from hill to dale, And how to bring healing to them that ail, And when to fold them, and feed them well While the snow lies deep upon field and fell. And so you tend them with care, and they Trust your shepherding, as you strive To keep them safe in the good old way— But somehow or other they do not thrive; They do not grow as they ought to grow, But pine where the quiet waters flow; And many are ailing, and none grow fat— Could you be well content with that? Nay, you are not there to be liked and praised, But to see that the sheep are fitly grazed. Or say that you go a-fishing, well Equipt with a handy rod and reel, And the temptingest flies that ever fell, Like light, where the rippling waters steal, And you know all the likely casts and pools, And to ply your art by the latest rules. Could you be satisfied now to see Shoals come sniffing about your hooks, As it were a pleasure for them to be Playing there, in the shining brooks, With the golden wings and the scarlet dyes Of all those beautiful summer flies, If never a speckled trout would touch The dainty things that they liked so much? Greatly our Shepherd, then, we admired, And greatly his fishing-craft we praised; But that was not what his heart desired, And therefore with sorrowing eyes he gazed Round and down on the thronging pews, As one who had failed in telling his news. For our life went on as it did before, Heaping up treasures from less to more, Seeking our pleasure, and serving our sins, And giving our honours to him that wins. And so he began to ask, “What next? Can I spend my years on a fruitless task? My soul is weary and sore perplexed, Will God not give me the boon I ask? Better go plough a straight furrow, and reap, Better the broom of as crosing-sweep, Labour of any kind one can see Good coming out of, than this for me.” Some would have laid all the blame on the flock, And called their hearts hard as a flinty rock; But that was never his way; for he Searched himself and his work, to find What might the cause of his failure be, And whether it were in his heart or mind. Was it the good news of God he had spoken? Was it the true Bread of life he had broken? And the Christ he had preached, was He God's own Son? Or only the Christ whom the school-men spun, Part of the earth, and part of the air, From the small fine threads of their logic bare? Now came a season of deep unrest, Of teaching thought to be lame and halt, And meetings of elders with minds oppressed, And meddling of ministers finding fault. For the fight he was fighting all the week through, As the Sabbath came round, he must fight it anew; And now it went this way, now it went that, Till we hardly could tell what he meant to be at; But we felt he was real, and groping about In search of a Faith that he had to find out. Slowly the light came; slowly it grew; Not without questionings, Could it be true? And faint heart-misgivings, What might be the end? Must he lose for the sake of it lover and friend? Sometimes resisting it when it seemed clearest, Sometimes afraid of it when it felt dearest, Sometimes persuaded it could not be right, Else the saints nearest God would have glowed in its light; And sometimes defiant and scornful, he, As one who knew what the cost must be, Hurled it at us, and went his way, To kneel in his closet, and weep and pray. But he settled at last in the lucent calm Of a restful faith which was sweet as a Psalm— Calm and sweet as the waters blest Where the Good Shepherd causeth His flock to rest. At first we heard him with growing fear. Was he hitting indeed at our cherished beliefs? Was he sapping the truth, to our fathers dear? Was he shooting heretical arrows in sheafs? Was he driving shafts through the Catechism To undermine our old Calvinism? Some held it was only the truth he sought, Truth which at any price must be bought: And some, that he ne'er should have come to preach If he had not already the truth to teach. And so, at each fireside the battle raged Which he with himself in anguish waged; And we searched the Book, and we gathered store Of other books, and we deemed them good, Not for the wealth of their learned lore, But for help that they gave us in living more Nobly and truly, as Christians should; That was his test for every thought, Will it lift you up nearer to God or not? Oh, that was a springtime of sowing seed— Seed of the better life surely—for mind Was quickened by him, and the soul was freed From dead traditions that bind and blind; It was a time too of tears and prayers, And bearing of crosses by high and low; If the enemy also sowed his tares, He warned us well that it must be so. In the end, when his way at length was clear, And the light shone quietly forth in power, And he came to us speaking good words of good cheer That dropt on our souls like a summer shower, How we waited for Sunday then, eager to listen To a message that made the heart glow and eye glisten! Oh, the hush of the multitude, breathless and still, As their souls bowed before him, and moved at his will! Meanwhile, his friend in his rural home Read many a clasped, white-vellumed tome, Black-lettered, and with red-edged leaf, And never a sentence clear and brief. Mickle he read, but little he grew; A dwarf in giant's armour he; And all that was old he held for true, And all that was new must error be; Fresh lights indeed on the earth might shine, But nothing fresh upon things divine; And little he heeded the voice which said, I am living, and these are dead. Then some came to him, whispering, “Lo! The hour is come, and the man we know. The friend of thy youth has gone astray From the beaten path of the narrow way, And leadeth others to do likewise, As there are always silly sheep Will follow the bell-wether, when he tries O'er his own shadow in vain to leap. That which the Fathers held for truth In the faith-sure days of the Church's youth, That which divines at a later stage, With the learning ripe of a thoughtful age, Fashioned into a Creed compact, Every link of it strong as fact, Every joint of it fitting tight As Scripture and Reason could shape them right— That, like another blind Samson, he, Making sport for the Philistine, Would fain pull down on our heads, that we May die like men crushed in a falling mine. But now is the harvest come at last Of all thy sowing of fruitless seed; God has been guiding thee in the past To help His Church in her hour of need. He is thy friend, and dear to thee, But not so dear as the Truth should be; Up, then, and gird thine armour on, Or take thy sling and the pebble stone, And smite this giant of carnal doubt. The Church must deal with him; but without The lore of the ages, known to thee, Hardly her way shall be plain to see; For the critical, carping spirit abroad Lies ever in wait for the Church's tripping, If she miss but a turn of the changing road, Or a chance wrong word from her mouth come slipping, And they scoff and mock, and fleer and flout If a date be wrong, or a jot left out. Heaven trained thee for this task. And see, There is glory and honour awaiting thee, When the true champion of the faith Has stricken this heresy unto death.” They were not many-thoughted men, Nor wise at winning souls, but yet Fitly and well they reasoned then To snare this soul in their wily net; And this was how the leaven wrought As he sat down by the fire, and thought— “How can I do it? He is my friend, Tender and true, and a saintly spirit, Living, by work and prayer, to mend The ills and woes that we all inherit. They'll call me a Balaam, a Judas,—what not? If I meddle with that which concerns me not. Yet should not a warning word be spoken, Even at the risk of a friendship broken? Can I in faithfulness let him go Unrebuked in his erring way, Marring the ancient doctrine so, And leading others, too, far astray? 'Tis pleasant to find my work at last Appreciated as it should be; And what if, indeed, through the busy Past, God for this has been training me? So they read it as men of sense, Skilled in the ways of Providence. It is right to do what the Church requires, And to tend the flame of her altar fires, How painful soever, then, I must speak;— And, besides, he is clearly all wrong in his Greek.” Followed a sharp Remonstrance, charged With high authorities, and enlarged With customary polemic hits— The shallow trick of barren wits— As “love of novelty—fickle mind— Failure of logic, if beauty of art— Hunger for fame of the emptiest kind— Itch of vanity in the heart— Knowledge that had not a touch of grace, Not accurate either, and out of place. You know the style; it was commoner once Than it is to-day, when the learned dunce Is of little account. As he read the “proof,” Though he knew how unkindly his words must seem, Like a pigeon perched on a high house-roof, He crooned and swelled in a vain fond dream Of all the honours that he should win, When scholars his learned volume read, And the wealth of praise that it might bring in, And the name that should live when he was dead; But he did not remember the love he lost— The broken seal of the Holy Ghost. One word only he spoke out plain, But that word measured the bulk of his brain: “That Aorist, now; he is clearly wrong; I have touched him there, and my point is strong.” For the faith and the hope of men, he wist. All hinged on the turn of an Aorist. Remonstrance led to Rejoinder, of course, Deftly handled with point and force, And equal learning and dainty wit, And there was not an unkind word in it. “Pleasant,” he writ, “was a quiet life Spent among big-margined folio books, Far from the town with its busy strife, 'Mid the singing of larks, and the cawing of rooks; And well for his friend to have lettered ease, For the Church to have scholars ripe and good, Though it is not for any themselves to please, And sit in brown study, and dream and brood, Fighting the battles of long ago With ghosts that are wandering to and fro, When they ought of rights to be lying low. For himself, his task had been plainly set Where the eager throng in the market met, And the rush of thoughts into men's vexed minds Was borne like the dust on the wild March winds, And would not be settled by tense or mood, Or aught that the nice grammarian could. He must serve his time, for he did not think God had mistaken the time of day, And set him forth, like an owl to blink At noon instead of the evening grey; But to look in the face of man, and see What was aching his heart and brow, And where the shadow of Mystery Lay on the face of the dial now. “Fresh lights had shone upon earth and heaven, And time had its ancient secrets given Up to our search, from the earth and stone That held the story of Babylon. Not now could any one wholly read The truth aright, if he gave no heed To that which the Fathers could not know— The lights which out of the ages grow. And ere the brief hours of his day were run, He would like to feel that his task was done With clear intelligence of the time, Wasting nothing on mere by-play, But filling his place in the plan sublime God worked out in His own great way. Others might come to mend it soon, To-morrow a different work might need, Men must change with the changing moon, And life be sung to another tune, And shape itself to a larger Creed. Faith in God was the only way, And there was no last word on that to say. “What have I done? I have only told My flock of the boundless love of God, Which is not straitened, but doth enfold All that on earth have their abode, All in the Universe that dwell In the heights of heaven, or the depths of hell; For there is no shore where that ocean breaks And finds its limit: God is not there Where Love is not, that our burden takes; For God is love, and is every where. And I told them, that God and His grace and work Are not tied fast to a Bishop's crook, Are not shut up in an ordered kirk, Nor yet bound up in a printed book, For all good thoughts that visited them, All longings for the pure and true, All from His inspiration came; And there was not an erring soul but knew The pleading tones of the Father's love Calling—calling him from above. And I taught moreover that they who hear, And turn from the evil of their ways, Shall find that His mercy is ever near, And sing to Him yet in a song of praise; For among the living, among the dead, Yesterday, to-day, and for ever, He is still the same, as the Spirit said, Pouring forth love as a flowing river. Is it heresy to have taught them so? I glory in it, and ever must, Ever with Christ my faith must go, When He seeks the living to make them just, Or joins the dead where they lie in dust; For He must be doing His Father's will, Bearing the message of mercy still.” Process of heresy then began, And who but his ancient friend was fit, Since the heretic too was a learned man, With competent knowledge to handle it? Oh they were grieved, for well they wot The man was good, and the work he did;— A saintly spirit in deed and thought, Though he plainly taught what the Church forbid: But never a heresy yet had thriven But what some holy man had given A tone to it that appeared from Heaven. It was all the worse for the Church, they said, When a man of God from the old paths broke; But there was little to fear or dread, When the heretic was like other folk. Weekly they met in hot debate, And weekly they preached on the business too, Daily also, and early and late, We all debated the case anew. Never such stir was known in the place; Never such searching of chapter and verse; Never such talk of election and grace, Never such arguments clear and terse; Never such stores of theology, brought From hiding-places in old men's heads, Never such troubled and anxious thought, As we walked by the way, or lay still in our beds, To think of the man, that we held so dear, Badgered as if he were fool or rogue: But at length, in the cold dark end of the year, They cast him out of their synagogue. I was there on that chill December night When they gave their verdict, and spake his doom By a single candle's glimmering light That was only just seen in the dusky gloom. Many were weeping, and some men swore, But a low laugh rose when the light died out, And we said, “Here we seek for the truth no more, They have left us in darkness to wander about.” Yet were we glad that the end had come, And the torrents of foolishest speech were dumb. But in the name of God to smite Him that was walking with God in light! And in the name of God to wreak Wrath on the lowly heart and meek! And in the name of God to pray O'er such a work as they did that day, Little witting what they were at!— In God's name what is the end of that? Outcast now from its fellowship, Still to the Kirk he fondly clung, And often he said, with quivering lip, How good it was, when the bell was rung, To go where the grand old Psalms were sung, And to be where lowly hearts were bent In prayer and holy Sacrament; For the Kirk made brave and earnest men, And he loved her now as he loved her then. So he lived on, the meekest saint, Nor wasted his life in vain complaint, Nor formed another sect to claim That it was the true Jerusalem, And rear its altars in his name; But gathered around him thoughtful youth, Inspiring them with the love of truth, And to look for guidance from above, And to believe that God is Love. At first, of course, we were only few— Just one here, and another there— Suspected and distrusted too, And work was scanty, and calls were rare. But soon the leaven spread, and we Became a goodly company: And many a pulpit in the land Ere long was quickened by his faith, And sounded forth the message grand That Love had vanquished sin and death, That God had been a little Child, And walked with sinners, undefiled, And with the wicked had made His grave, That grace and hope might come to all, And all might join the battle brave Who heard, and would obey His call. And we grew bold, and dared to greet The outcast in his failing years With words of love and honour meet, That filled his wistful eyes with tears— Never a task I laboured at So much to my liking as writing that— For he had meekly born the yoke, And now behold the seed had sprung, And over all the Church awoke The same glad strain which he had sung. O mystery of truth, whose hour Of sorrow is its day of power, Which but accepts its cross, and then Rides forth in its might to conquer men! But who was the heretic kept apart From the truth and life by his faith-less heart? He who was loser, but still loved on? Or he who gave up his love, and won? Ah! would you read God's meaning? look Not on the bright, shining page of His Book, But where the shadow lies dark on the face Of some tragic failure, some proud disgrace. For the loss is gain, and the gain is loss, And the shame is glory when He wills That thou shouldst shine in the healing Cross, Which all the Law by love fulfils. SABBATH EVENING LONG AGO I see the old home on the Sabbath night— It smelt of heresy to call it Sunday, A heathen name, although we held it right To paganise the Saturday and Monday. The cruse hung on the jamb, with poor rush pith That, soaked in whale oil, dimly kept a-gleaming; More shadows filled the room than lights therewith, And how those wavering shadows set me dreaming! A sea-coal fire glowed on the old Dutch slates, And on the brown carved settle near the doorway, And on a rack of willow-pattern plates, And on a bronze-hued wooden bowl from Norway. A mighty cauldron simmered by the fire, Whereto our hungry eyes kept often turning, For the much-preaching sharpened the desire To satisfy the flesh we had been spurning. In the big chair the father gravely sat, And round the fire the household gathered quiet; The dog wheeled round, and, coiling on the mat, Slept through the lesson, profiting not by it. And then we went right through the “Catechism,” From “Man's chief end,” to “Amen” in conclusion— Heaven's white light broken in a logic prism To clear our thought, and end in dire confusion. Mostly I did not understand at all, And my mind wandering seemed to hear the shouting Of comrades at a game of bat or ball; But where I understood, it set me doubting. So those high orthodoxies came to be Quick seeds in me of heterodox opinion, And, ere I wist, my thoughts were all at sea, And drifted, holden by no wise dominion. I knew not how those Westminster Divines To Scots beyond the Tweed their faith had given, But I rebelled to travel on those lines Which made so hard and dark a way to Heaven. Still the small mind chafed at the strenuous thought Of those stern Puritans who faced, unwincing, The darkest problems of our human lot, And solved them with a text, as all-convincing. But while the grave old father questioned on, I marked his dome of forehead, time had wrinkled, And to myself I kept my thoughts alone, And the dog dreamed on, and the rushlight twinkled. In him there was a faith serene and strong, In me an unrest, like the rush of water; Without, there was a Credo hard and long, Within, there was a resolute Negatur. Yet in his stern creed lay a tender heart, The husk o'erlaid a wealth of human kindness And love, that fain their wisdom would impart To purge the young soul of its earthly blindness. And it did store the mind with furniture— In forms antique, forbidding peaceful slumber, But morticed well, and fashioned to endure, Hard to get into, or out of heads they cumber. I wot not what our later faiths may do For us, what time our troubled lives may need them, But through that stern old creed a nation grew Toughest and staunchest in the fight of freedom. CREEDS Ah! these old creeds, Who can believe them to-day? Yet were brave deeds Inspired by them once, too; and they Made men of heroic mould In the great fighting ages of old. Is it the wounds Which science has given? or the sap On critical grounds, Which has brought about their mishap? Nay, these touched not a vital spot, Though they brag of the wreck they have wrought. But the spirit has risen From the hard, narrow letter which kept Men's thoughts in a prison, Where they struggled or languished or slept; And now we can soar high above All the creeds, but the Credo of Love. They are things of the past, Survivals, and now out of date; The men were not cast In our moulds, who endured such a weight, So linked and compact: let them go, They who wore them had no room to grow. All too complete, They were subtly and skilfully wrought With logic neat; But they are not in touch with our thought; And they will not allow they have found And spot where they have not sure ground. They are ever so far From the days we are living in now, From our work and our war, And the thoughts that are aching our brow; And yet though they be but part true, Vain to patch up the old, or make new. Creed-making now In these latter ages of time Would yield stuff, I trow, Thin and loose as a small poet's rhyme— Tags and thrums, hints and guesses, no more, With a deep, settled doubt at the core. What not to believe, That now is the stage we are at; And how shall we weave Any faith to live on out of that? There must go to the making of creeds Sure hearts, girded up for high deeds. But ours is an age Of unmaking, taking things down: For the warfare we wage We must swarm from the fortified town, And spread out, to find air and room, Beyond the old walls and their gloom. Yet we have faith In the Right and the True and the Good, And in Him whose last breath Was the prayer of a pitiful mood, Which smites the meek spirit with awe, And with Love, the true life of all Law. THE DISCOVERY OF GOD Who was the man that found out God? And what the method that he took? Did he, with patient travail, look For footprints on the sand or sod, Making it plain that, on a time, A mighty Architect stood here, Building the earth up, tier on tier, And working out a plan sublime? Or did he trace, with curious skill, Nice-fashioning touches on the clay That man was made of, and the way That it was modelled to fulfil The artist's purpose, when at length The pulses of its life should beat, And find the eye and ear complete, And hand with delicate touch and strength? And as he traced the facts and laws, Close-linking the high argument Of reason, was the great event— An infinite all-designing Cause? Thus, step by step, did he go on, Groping through darkness to ward light, Until the vision of glory bright Dawned on his soul, and doubt was gone, And in the splendour of the day The universe revealed its sense, And throbbed with clear intelligence, And bade him worship now and pray, For lo! the wondrous Book, no more Anonymous, disclosed to view Its Author and its meaning too, Which were a secret heretofore? Ah! what a moment that had been, When such a thought first broke on him, And filled his being to the brim With awe of what his mind had seen! Who was the grand discoverer? What age was honoured to contain This man of subtle and daring brain— The one divine philosopher? Could mortals e'er forget his name, Or history fail to note the day When that dread veil was rent away, And God a proven Truth became? One finds a new world, one, a star Undreamt of hitherto, and men Hold high their names in honour then Through all the ages near and far. But what are these to him who found The truth in which all others meet, The central thought which makes complete, And clears up all the glorious round; The will which shapes what may befall, The power that wrought whate'er hath been, The light wherein all light is seen, The life that is the life of all? Nay, no Columbus here may boast That, plunging in an unknown sea, He made this grand discovery, Being sore-spent and tempest-tossed. No seeker sought, till he did find The secret hid from ages past, The mystery of the First and Last, The Peace that filleth heart and mind, By links of patient reason brought Out of the sum of finite things. He reasons ill whose reason brings Such outcome from his partial thought— From light and shadow perfect light, Pure good from mingled good and ill, From tokens of mechanic skill Illimitable glory and might. Vain dreamer of an idle dream In logic forms! Did any one Discover by his quest the sun, That seeks us with his searching beam? Who pries about the world to find Proof that he is in heaven? who mines The earth in search of frequent signs That shall suffice to clear his mind, And certify the wondrous power, That burns upon the morning cloud, And makes the song-bird glad and loud, And paints the shining leaf and flower? Thou didst not find God hidden there In problem of His acts and days; But He reveals Himself, and lays To the pure heart His glory bare. THE INVENTION OF GOD Some tell us that, in evil hour, Our fears invented God, the dread Of our forefathers lying dead, Or of some dark, malignant Power That sendeth pestilence and drought, And storms and desolating wars, And horrid glare of baleful stars, And grief and pain, and fear and doubt: Wherefore the troubled spirit dreamed A Phantom stood upon its path, And hastened to appease His wrath By whatsoe'er it most esteemed. Man did not know the law that binds Whatever is with all that was, And in the sum of complex cause A deep unconscious wisdom finds. A savage without science, he Sat shivering in his dirty rag, And deemed some godhead held a bag, Filled full of pain and misery, Which he let loose on hapless men, What time, an hungered, he would dine On ample flesh, and bread and wine, And found his altar stinted then. And so man's fear invented God; For thunder-clap and stormy blast, And fire-stream from the mountain cast Seemed the fell strokes of His angry rod; And pestilence His deadly breath, And war a game He loved to play For pastime of an idle day, That gambled with our life and death: Wherefore men crept up to His feet, And licked the dust in abject fear, And howled their prayers into His ear, Or gashed them, and their bosoms beat. Strange savage, in the nutting wood, Who, just emerged from apehood, framed Articulate speech, and all things named, And, brooding in a troubled mood, Invented God! Our triumphs are But trifles it were best to hide, But poor mechanic toys, beside The trophies of Thy fruitful war. O semi-brute! thou hadst a dream Transcending all that we can reach, For thou invented'st God and Speech, And we have only compassed—Steam. And Thou dark Phantom of our fears, How comes the heart to cling to Thee For comfort in its misery, And drying of its blinding tears? The stream that from the height comes down, And foams along the rock-strewn course, Can never rise above its source, But creepeth down by grange and town; Yet from that spring of coward dread, That Phantom born of wrath and death, Come holy love, brave-hearted faith, And hope with heavenly visions fed! THE VISION OF GOD O the silences of heaven, How they speak to me of God, Now the veil in twain is riven That concealed where he abode! Yet its clouds were once around Him, And I sought Him in despair, And never there I found Him, Till I brought Him with me there. Not the optic glass revealed Him, No mechanical device Pierced the darkness that concealed Him With a vision more precise: Only lowliness can merit That His secret He should tell; Only spirit seeth spirit, And the heart that loveth well. Never till His love hath found thee, Shall the cloud and mist depart; Vain to seek Him all around thee, Till He dwell within thy heart. Not without thee, but within thee Must the oracle be heard, As He seeketh still to win thee, And to guide thee by His word. When I found Him in my bosom, Then I found Him everywhere, In the bud and in the blossom, In the earth and in the air; And He spake to me with clearness From the silent stars that say, As ye find Him in His nearness, Ye shall find Him far away. THE BURDEN OF GOD I bore a load of doubt and care, And could not reason it away; It might have no right to be there, Yet clung to me by night and day. And I was fain to be alone, A stranger in a far-off land, Where friend and helper I had none, Nor any that could understand. Oh for a glad, entrancing faith! Oh for an all-controlling thought To fill my soul, as with a breath That from the Eternal life is brought! Let me but be alone with God A little while on some high place, Where rarely foot of man hath trod, That I may see Him face to face. So did they long of old, who built High altars on the hill-tops bare, To leave their load of sin and guilt, And find the peace they hoped for there. Then I went toiling up the glen, Like one that wanders in a dream, Past broad-eaved homes of toiling men, Along the swiftly rushing stream, Past the white kirk with ruddy spire, And solitary wayside shrine Where peasant mothers did admire The mother of the Babe divine, Past orchards where the tawny steer, Black-muzzled, stood and whisked his tail, While men sat in the tavern near, With flask of wine or mug of ale. I heard the sharp whish of the scythe, And dragging of the patient rake, I heard the children singing blithe, And felt as if my heart would break. They sang the song of Bethlehem, And glad their voices were and clear; And oh that I could sing like them, And only knew that God would hear! Still on, I bore my burden on, Finding no help in kirk or shrine, Or crucifix of carven stone, Or picture of the Babe divine: Alone, I must be all alone, Beyond the mighty wooded slopes; I would have company with none, But those vast, silent mountain tops Which held me with their snowy spell, And bade me come to where they stood, And in their white robes, worshipped well The Everlasting Pure and Good. I took the steep rock-path that winds Through the pine wood above the stream,— High up, the grey-green glacier grinds, Far down, its grey-green waters gleam, A torrent from a neighbouring cliff Leaped down, and disappeared half way, To fall in tremulous mist, as if Nature to me was fain to say— See how the rush of lofty thought, The higher that its way appears, The deeper that its rest is sought, Still vanishes in mist and tears. Still up the rugged path I went, With panting breath and trembling knees, And weary limb, and back low bent, Till, past the belt of great pine trees, I came upon a sunny glade Open and green, with brooks and wells, And crocus fields where cattle wade, With noise of many jangling bells, And flat-roofed chalets, piled with stone, For winds are boisterous there and wild; But kirk or steeple there was none, Only the Virgin and her Child, Kept in some homely box for shrine, And sheltered in a quiet nook, Where humble worship might incline With bended knee, and lowly look. But all these fond traditions stood— How sweet soe'er their tender grace— Between me and the Pure and Good, And I must see Him face to face. A little speech, a little rest, A cup of goat's milk at the door; Bid me not stay and be your guest, There are a good eight hours and more, Before the sun dips in the west, And I must on at any price, To see his evening glories rest Upon the pale green glacier ice, And on the web of pallid snow That wraps the hills in raiment white, And on the changing clouds below That catch the fringes of His light. I did not tell my inmost thought: Those neat-herds could not well divine How I, in search of God, was brought Away from kirk and cross and shrine. Still up and up; the Alpen-stock Oft buried in the turf before, Now smote upon the living rock, And from its heart the fire-spark tore; And as I trod the gradual slope 'Neath some snow-crested precipice, And glanced round, with a passing hope Of chamois fleet or Edelweiss, Lo, then my step grew lightsomer, And cheerily I sped along, And in the brisk and tingling air I could have broken into song. And this I took for omen true, That I was on the way of peace, That doubts were where the pine-woods grew, And with the haunts of man would cease. And so at length I trod the snow On the hill-top that afternoon, And saw it in the evening glow, And in the sheen o' th' pallid moon, And saw the wondrous morning dawn, All rosy, on the white-robed peaks That, ranged like priest-forms. in their lawn, Served, through eternal holy weeks, About the altar of the Lord, Awful in their blanch beauty there, Silent, as if with one accord Wrapt in the hush of speechless prayer. There was no sound of man or beast, Nor hum of bee, nor song of bird, And more the silence seemed increased What time the avalanche was heard. Once they had held me with a spell, And drawn me with a mystic force, Those hills, as deeming God must dwell There where the waters had their source, Which made the vales and meadows glad; There where, in majesty sublime, The changeless snow-clad summits had No reckoning of the passing time. There 'mid the everlasting snow Should I not see the eternal right, And look down on the mists below, And gaze up to the fount of light, And find my burden fall away, And feel at last the perfect calm That broods in the unchanging day, And vision of the great I Am? But as I stood upon the height, I did not find what I had sought, I did not find the perfect light, That answered to my wistful thought; It did not ease me of my load, That I had left the world behind; I was not any nearer God By being far from humankind. And up amid the bands of ice And silent fields of clinging snow, I could have purchased with a price The Virgin and the Babe below. For not in nature's awfulness, And majesty and purity, And not in her dread silences Shall God reveal His depths to thee; But in a heart that throbs to thine, And tongue that speaks a human speech: The human is the one divine, That yearning human souls can reach. There is no scene of earth fulfils The high hope of the soaring mind, And in the quiet of the hills The peace of God I did not find; And sweet it was with weary limbs, Ere long to sit i' the kirk, and hear The children singing in their hymns, That Christ was come, and God was near. WHAT PILATE THOUGHT OF IT What would you have, my Lucius? Here our wits, Which you in Rome keep ever sharp and bright By constant use, are blunted, and the sword Clings to the scabbard, only to be drawn Too late. Oh, thus and thus I should have spoken And thus I should have done. How cleverly We manage, when we sit down by the fire, And, having all the dialogue to ourselves, We find the answer pat, which does not come I' th' strain of acting! But you do not know This people—Would I were like you in that! “Are they dull-brained, these Jews, then? Are there none To whet your wits upon, and keep them keen? No crafty priest to fence with—demagogue To trip up in his talk—no politic Schemer to countermine — or wily lawyer To follow through his trick and artifice Of rhetoric, and exercise the brain We used to think a good one?” Plenty of them, Priests, plotters, demagogues as thick as flies In Egypt, and like flies they settle on Your eyes to sting and blind them. But they are not Like other men. You cannot count upon Their motives, or their methods, or their aims. What they may love, and what they may abhor, The oaths that bind them, or the gods they fear, All are most strange and baffling. 'Tis as if You dealt with beings of another world Whose passions are not ours, whose ways of thinking Are alien to our modes. The strangest people! So pious and so wicked! methodical In lying, with a reason always ready, Yet full of contradictions, as the way Of lying is apt to be even in adepts; And they are deep practitioners. Then, too, Cæsar Distrusts me, and when I have served him best, Lo, comes a deputation of these Jews, Whose women throng the backstairs of the palace, Backed by their money-lending Trastiveres, And every one a traitor at his heart, Impeaching me of rapine and of blood, And thereon comes a rescript. What can I, But let them plot, looking as if I saw Mere loyal service, till the plot be ripe, Then crush them with my legions? Only force Can rule this beastly Plebs, and their worse leaders; And Cæsar, if he knew them as I do, Would leave the Gauls and Britons, and let loose The sword upon these Hebrews. Oh to be— But for my hungry creditors—once more I' the Campus Martius on unruliest steed, Or scouring the Campania, rather than Managing these cursèd Jews! I've lost my nerve Among them—yet their daughters are most fair. But of this prophet, Jesus. You must know, I had been supping late with Rufus Naso, And young Cornelius, and the Advocate Publius Julius, and some other wits, Visitors here from Rome: all full of spirits, That hardly needed my best Cyprian wine, Just smacking of the goatskin, to let loose The sparkling jest, the latest story told About the Augurs, Seneca's neat phrase, And your quick repartee, Nerissa's strokes Of wit, and Lydia's languishing, and all The pleasant life about the Mammertine, For which one longs in this Jerusalem. This growing slack, i' th' hush we heard a song, A great “Hallel” about the Temple gate, Repeated here and there all through the town Pleasantly, for these Jews are musical, And have a better choir than you in Rome, With antiphones and linked melodies That toss the sweet strains to and fro i' th' air, And pick them up again, and blend their notes To catch the soul with rapture. I alone Knew 'twas their Pascha, chief of all their Feasts, Joyful, yet solemn, not like the wild riot Of booths and bonfires in the Autumn when They hold their Lupercalia, and go mad. We had well drunk, and were in merry humour; So nought would serve but we must travesty The rite. By Bacchus, 'twas the rarest prank, Though it may cost me dear. About midnight Each girt his coat about him, donned his sandals As ready for a journey, with a staff Handy, for so their Priests had ordered it; And thereupon the slaves brought in the feast. But for a lamb we had a roasted swine, Which is abomination to the Jew, And sweet-baked fruits instead of bitter herbs, And flagons of rare Cyprus, and we sang Some ribald songs to the air of their Hallel, Till far into the morning. As day broke We heard the loud tramp of a throng of men Fast hurrying through the streets. That sobered us. Were those fierce Jews, then, mustering to avenge The insult? How could I so play the fool, Knowing the crafty Annas had his spies About me—that they tell him all I do, Who visits me, what letters I have writ, Even what I eat and drink, and all my dallying With that witch, Leila, whom I half suspect To be the chief tale-bearer? O crass fool! To fall into his power for this poor jest. “Ho! man the walls, draw up the guard in arms!” Pshaw! 'tis no riot, only some mad prophet The priests are haling to their courts. He must be An honest one, for they'd have let him preach Truculent lies till doomsday. Well; my head Was not so clear as it had need to be After that bout, nor were my nerves well strung, When there rose clamorous outcry at the gate, And I must to the Judgment Hall, where stood A lonely prisoner, bound, and faint, and weary. Some poor men—fishers, as I deemed, or shepherds— Flitted about i' th' shadow, looking scared, As loth to leave him, yet afraid to stand Right at his side. All his accusers were Clamouring outside the court. It would have tainted Their sanctity at such a sacred time, And barred them from the worship of their God, To cross our unclean threshold; for we all— Cæsar and all his Prætors and their courts— Are in their eyes defiling and unholy. They might be forging lies: no doubt, they were; They seldom do aught else. They might imbrue Their hands in innocent blood; that mattered not; Such things are trifles to your grim fanatic. But they must not be tainted by the touch Of Romans! O my Lucius, how the gods, If any gods there be, must laugh at us Who hold them bound by such nice ceremony, And free from conscience—Would I were a god! I found my prisoner was the Prophet, Jesus, Whom I had sometime heard of as a kind Of Hebrew Stoic, like our Seneca, But practising, as well as preaching, that Hard and high doctrine. Certain words of his Had reached me now and then, like thistledown Blown i' th' air, which had the ring in them Of true philosophy: but other some Were dreamy; part, good coin, and part too fine A metal for this world to traffic in. I'd heard too that he had the singular art Of healing them by faith, imagination— Whate'er it be—which filled their minds with wonder, So that some deemed a god had come to earth. Half curiously I scanned him. Homely clad, Like those his fellow-workmen; broken, too, By toil and travel and poverty and sorrow, And all unlike the Immortals, as our Poets Conceive them, and our sculptors fashion them. Yet there was something in his look and bearing That overawed me. As I looked on him, There rose in me a memory of my mother White as a lily and sweet, and of the days When I was like a white bud on her bosom, That now am so bedraggled. What could it mean? Those women of the Court who rave about him Cry up his beauty; but whom they admire They clothe with loveliness, and Socrates Himself should walk in guise of bright Apollo, Not like a satyr, were he but their hero. And this man's beauty, if beautiful he were, Was not like th' young Augustus. This, at least, I could have sworn, that he was innocent, Whate'er these Jews might say. But here was I In this mad tragi-comedy of life Playing the part of Judge, while he stood there To plead with me for life!—But that he did not. No, not so much as one word did he utter To win our grace, but looked me in the face, Silently searching me, as who should say, “Thou, my Judge, Thou!” until I quailed before him, Feeling the mockery of justice, where The power was mine, the righteousness was his. But how to save him, guiltless, from their guile? So I went forth, and asked them: “What have ye Against this man?” He called himself a King, And they would have no king but only Cæsar. The lying rogues had plotted against Cæsar, Raised tumults, broke into rebellions, cursed His Prætors, Publicans, and legionaries, And at that very hour were scheming treasons: Yet they would have no king but only Cæsar! I could not hide my scorn. Since when had they Become so loyal to the imperial throne? So deep devoted to the power they cursed At all their feasts? Thereon they clenched their teeth, And muttered something about blasphemy, And making himself God. Therefore I bade them Take him away, and judge him by their law— They had no power o'er life—because our law Held it no crime for one to be a god; Cæsar was one, so were the great twin-brethren, And Hercules, and other mighty men. I had no jurisdiction o'er the gods, And this man might be one of them, for aught I knew or cared. Then rose a yell of rage, Deep-throated, fierce, malignant, from the pit Of Acheron; “Thou art not Cæsar's friend, If thou let this man go.” So I went back, Knowing that I had raised a storm might dash me A broken wreck at Annas' feet. And there He stood, this King o' th' Jews, bent low and bound, Yet with that lofty, overawing look Which made my eyes droop—Majesty uncrowned Of noble manhood, not yet stained by falls In the arena. “Art thou, then, a King?” But not a syllable he answered, only Gazed on me with a look of pity. It was A foolish question; for of course I knew, Not for such crime had Annas brought him here, Who would have prayed and sacrificed and poured The consecrating oil on any head That in brief triumph had been lifted up Against great Cæsar. Oh, I know the man! Nothing were less a crime among these Jews Than treason against Rome. I've had to crush A score of their rebellions, and this Annas Was in them all, although his hand was hidden; Chief plotter he of all. A foolish question! Better if I had frankly asked him, why Do these your countrymen so hate you that They do accuse you falsely? But somehow, Seeing that broken, poor, and pitiful Rival of Cæsar, I must say to him: “A King, then, are you?” He despised me for it, And held his peace, which partly fretted me, And partly my own sense of being wrong. So then I said: “Dost thou not know that I Have power to take thy life?” But calmly he: “Thou hast no power, but as 'tis given to thee; So much the more their guilt who brought me here.” What could he mean? These Jews are cunning dogs; Of course, I had no power but what I got From Cæsar. What, if Annas meant to drive me To stretch my large commission till it rent? I must be wary. Just then came a note, Sent by my wife, and bidding me take heed, Nor harm this man. She had some dream about him, And dreams are from the gods. Pshaw! let the women See to their own affairs, not meddle with The course of justice. No doubt, Chusa's wife— She's wild about this prophet—came to her, And they between them had conspired to stay The law by this device. I'd half a mind To do the very thing they wished me not, Just for their meddling; but thought better of it. My wife has a sharp tongue. Then I went forth Once more to face these Jews: “I find no fault Worthy of death, by our law, or of bonds In this your King, or God, or whatsoe'er The poor man calls himself. So, I will scourge him, And let him go”—though why he should be scourged 'Twere hard to tell, except to humour those Who should have had the scourge on their own backs Laid roundly; but a man who is accused, We come to think has reason to be thankful, If he escape with scourging. Anyhow, More bitterly malignant than before, The mob of smiths and cobblers roared at me, And my weak plan. My nerves had been unstrung, I tell you, or I had not heeded them. Pilate was never coward. Then some one said Something about the Nazarene, whereat I grasped as any drowning man. “He is A Galilean then, King Herod's subject, And Herod is in town to keep the feast; 'Tis his affair: A letter shall be writ; A guard ho! take him to the king; let Herod Settle this business. It is none of mine.” A happy thought that! Herod had been cool Of late, or worse than cool; and this would please The old fox's vanity, delivering me From the so tangled hank, and let me break My fast in peace.—I saw the meal laid out In tempting grapes, and dates, and figs, and melons, And old Falernian, and I longed to grasp The silver cup and quaff it. Laughing, then, At this rare stroke, I hurried them away, But scarce came from the bath refreshed, when lo! The wave rolled back. Herod had been well pleased With our sweet courtesy, but could not think Of meddling with the Imperial jurisdiction In treasonable affairs; so sent the man, After some rough and ribald jesting back, Robed in a mockery of regal purple, And crowned with thorns. O irony of Fate! Whom even the gods escape not: what fell spite Led thee to bind this burden now on me? I was a fool to look for any help From Herod. He not long ago had killed Another of their prophets—a brave man, And eloquent, and true. I heard him preach At the King's Court once, and he made us all Willing, for half an hour at least, to strip Our purple and fine linen off, and send The banquet, getting ready, to feed the poor. And since that deed, his conscience pricking him, The crafty I dumean had turned coward, And thought this Jesus might be John come back From Hades to amaze his murderer, And haunt him. As I turned to Jesus now, Weary he looked and broken, as a man Done with the world; and half in pity I said, “So thou art come back crowned? A king then truly?” “Thou say'st,” he answered; “Yea, I am a King; Only my kingdom is not of this world, But therefore am I come, to witness of The truth, and who are of the truth hear me.” “Truth! what is truth?” I asked. “Where is it? Can I see, or touch, or taste, or smell it?” Was This man a dreamer, being no longer boy, But wearing beard unblemished, that he spake Of truth as of his kingdom where he reigned Supreme?—an airy realm, ungrudged, I ween, By Cæsar! We were youths, my Lucius, once, And wasted many a night in barren talk About the truth; when in the Agora We breathed the air that Plato used to breathe While Athens still was Queen, and wore her crown With majesty; but, since we came to manhood, We've had to act, not dream. Nor did this man Look like a dreamer; and I must admit These Jews, whate'er they be, are not like some Of those strange Eastern peoples whom I've seen, Squatting for years in some uneasy posture, Fed on a lettuce, or a stalk of garlic, Talking of truth, and dreaming in the sun That blistered them by day, and in the moon That all the night bedewed them, being held Divinely wise because most mad. The Jew Is shrewd, and has a bottom of good sense Beneath his superstitions, like the stones And gravel over which a river runs. He trades, and lends on usury, and gains Shekels where you'd scarce find an obolus; Keen at a bargain, hard as any flint, And nowise given to dreaming. Yet this man Could speak of truth, and of a kingdom there! “Truth—what is truth?” So I went forth again. “I find no fault in this man. He has broken No law of Cæsar's, nor may Cæsar dread His schemes, or be he Prophet, King, or God. But you've a custom, good or bad—most part Bad I should say, or only good for rogues— To get release of some offender now At Pascha. There's Barabbas, thief and rebel And murderer too, him take and crucify; This Christ I will have scourged, and let him go.” So I had done my utmost, tried all ways To save him, though he uttered not a word, Nor sought for mercy, nor encouraged me In my endeavours, nor approved my deed. What happened then? A growl of sullen wrath, Low murmur of petition unto Cæsar: “Not this man, but Barabbas! Crucify, Crucify this one, or”—I saw the old Priest Writing upon his tablets, with a cold Clear eye, and half a smile upon the thin And bloodless lips of him. What could I do? He knew of last night's frolic, and other things I need not name, which might look bad in Rome Even to one's friends, and worse when told by those Who hungered for my post—they would not be So eager if they knew it. It was hard To do, for he had interested me; But yet if I should free him, they would rend The man in pieces, such was their fierce temper; And if he died now, while his dreams had still The sweet breath of young innocence, better so Than after that bad schooling he will get Among his people; like enough at heart He was a traitor also—all Jews are— And only got his due; but that thought called A blush up in my soul, for secretly I knew it was a lie. At any rate, If one must die, 'twere better he than I, And for a little more or less of blood Upon my hands, that did not trouble me, Although I washed them there before the mob In token of my innocence, while they Cried, “Yea, his blood on us and on our children!” The thing was done so, not to be undone: I wish it were to do, and my head cool As it is now; no matter, it is done. There was not one to say a word for him; He was alone, not backed by any man, And yet he had for years been healing them, I wot not by what power, only the fact Was clear, however fancy coloured it. Their deaf and dumb, their lepers and their blind, Their fevered and bed-ridden had been cured, And some averred their very dead been raised By him; but that, of course, was all a dream Of fond imagination, or, it may be, A trick to catch their faith: at any rate, The land was ringing with his mighty deeds, And yet there came not one to speak for him. Had any man stood up, and said to me, “Lo! I was blind, and now I see,” or “I Was mad, and am in my right mind again,” Or “I was cripple, and behold I walk, And this man did it,” then it would have been A case to send to Cæsar for decision, Being past my wits, and needing a divine Insight like his. But no! these grateful Jews Said nought but, “Crucify him! Crucify!” They say that he died sweetly, and they talk About this having risen again, and spoken To certain of his followers, and the priests Would have these stories silenced by the law. Nay, let the poor fools have such comfort as They find in these fond dreams. I know he's dead. My fellows never leave their work half done; Their lives should answer for it, if they did. No doubt, he's dead; a spear-thrust in the heart Made sure of that; he'll trouble us no more. 'Tis a strange thirst these priests have still for blood; If they had shed as much of it as we, They'd hate the smell of it. And yet I'd give Something to learn if Annas' blood is like What flows in other men. I hear them shouting “The Lord is risen indeed!” I wish he were; 'Twould take a load off me to see Him living, And what I did, undone. But that's past hope; The dead are dead for ever. Speak well of me, My Lucius, to Sylvia and Nerissa, What time you sup in the old tavern by The Pincian, and the wine and mirth are free. Cæsar will hardly trouble himself about This prophet's death, since it has pleased the Jews, But you might say a good word for him truly, And strike that old rogue, Annas. A good deed! Oh that I could but squeeze from these hard Jews Some certain talents, and get back to Rome! But they have sucked me rather, leaving only The dry rind o' the orange. Fare thee well! A PULPITEER Sat in his inn after breakfast a lean little man with the look, Withered and shrunk, of one whose moisture was dried, like a brook Where the sun burns hot in the tropics; but now he was home once more In the place where he first drew breath near the sands of the North Sea shore: And he held in his hand a “poster,” big-lettered in black and red, Which he read with a cynical sneer; then low to himself he said: “Service begins at eleven, but the door will be open at ten”: That means a crush to get in, with screaming of women, and men Barely just kept from swearing by dread of the Sabbath day, And swearing the more in their hearts; it were better for women to stay At home, and see to their children, instead of losing their wits Crushed in a trampling crowd, till they go off in fainting fits. No, I'll not face it. How should I sit still in a narrow pew For an hour, with my legs a-cramp, and with nothing on earth to do But stare at the white-washed walls, and gasp for a mouthful of air, And smell the hot peppermint breaths, and the oil in the young bucks' hair, And watch how faces grow purple, and bald heads are smoking like censers? Nay, I will sit by the fire here, and read that last volume of Spencer's. There's more in a sentence of his than in all that this fellow can say, Though he preach for an hour by the clock.” So he kicked his boots out of the way. That was his first thought. But hardly had he reached out for his book, And settled him down in an easy chair in the cosiest nook, With a big cigar in his mouth, and the cloud-smoke round his head Curling in wavy rings, when once more he looked up and said— “Yet we were fellows at College together, and friends too once, This famous preacher and I, and he was not a bit of a dunce, But fairly well up in his classics, though logic was always his forte; A rare, good hand at debate, ever prompt with a clever retort; Not very strong in science, but skilled with his pen to write, And making his half-dark thinking clearer than other men's light; A smart rhetorician truly, with a ready tongue in his head, Though he looked so clumsy and loutish, and homespun and country-bred. He is starring it here, as I learn; has come to revive their faith, To stir up the fire whose embers were smouldering nigh unto death. I care not much for your stars; and for starring parsons least; The better they are at that, they have less the true heart of a priest. But they say that he gave up a living to be free to go here and there, Where a boat was wrecked, or the Devil broke loose at a rural fair, Or where the state of religion needed a trumpet blast To rouse them up from the sleep into which their souls had been cast By the abundance of bread.—A queer sort of life, no doubt; But everyone to his taste.—So, freely he goes about, And passes now for a great man. That means not much, I allow; Once great men took to the Church, but they're somewhat scarce there now— One-eyed men among blind folk. Still he is followed by throngs, And speaks, they say, to the age of its duties, its rights and its wrongs; Not pulpit commonplaces—the leaden tokens they mint For everyday use—but sayings newspapers are fain to print, Eloquent, flowing periods balanced and pointed like sonnets, And his pews are crowded with heads too, not with mere ribbons and bonnets. That's what they tell me, at least, and they say that you even shall grin, Now and then, at the hits which he makes when describing a popular sin. I do not much care for humour or wit in the house of prayer; 'Tis so easy with smallest of jokes to spread ripples of laughter there: But yes! I must go, after all, and hear what the man has to say: He was not a fool, and I daresay it will be as good as a play. 'Twill be very bad if it is not, as plays go now. Ah me! How the bloom and the gloss get rubbed off everything here that we see!” So he threw down his book with a grumble, and out of the room he strode, Not quite in the mood for a mortal to go to the house of God. A brilliant midsummer day, with a glorious sun in the blue, Though clouds were massing all round it, lurid and sultry in hue, And there was not a breath to stir the thirsty and drooping leaves, And all the wild flowers were alive with the hum of the honey-thieves, And the larks were hurrying fast through their morning songs, as if they Dreaded that something might mar them before high noon of the day. There was more than a Sabbath hush in the listless fields, as he passed Leisurely into the town, whither groups were hurrying fast By twos and threes and dozens, like rills and streams that flowed Together at last in a river along the great high road. It turned out all as he pictured—the crush at the narrow door, The screaming and fainting of women—but nobody cursed or swore— The squeeze in the straight high pews, the crowd packed close in the aisles, The blaze of peony faces, and glimmer of ghastly smiles, The reeking and moping of bald heads, the coughing and taking of snuff: Yet were they grave too, and patient. It was God's house: that was enough. How well he remembered it all—that quaint old chapel of ease, With its high-pitched pulpit, facing the high deep galleries, And the sounding-board overhead, and the dove with the olive branch, And the votive ship that was hung up in memory of the launch Of the first of the Greenland whalers that out of the harbour sailed. Proud was the gallant skipper of the port from which he hailed, And the kirk where he had been christened, and the ship where he held command, And the minister whom he reckoned the foremost in all the land: And he modelled his ship, and hung it, hull and rigging and block— He had married the minister's daughter—right over the gilded clock. They were sturdy Protestants all there, yet they saw not the deadly sin Of a votive ship in the Church, nor the evils it might bring in. It was not like vowing candles, or hanging up waxen limbs In honour of healing saints, with chaunting of prayers and hymns: And it grew to be almost sacred in all men's memories, When ship and skipper were crushed in the ice-packed Greenland seas. But more than the high-pitched pulpit, and the dove and the olive twig, And more than the many-sparred whaler, so neat and trim in its rig, And the great square pew where the elders spread out their long coat-tails— It was lined with green baize, handsome, and studded with bright brass nails— More than all to the stranger was the pew where he used to sit— They filled it once with a household, now he knew not a face in it. But, as he looked, he saw there brothers and sisters true All in their order duly ranged in the old church pew; Here at the door the father, guiding his flock with a look, Each in his Sunday raiment, each with a well-clasped book, While the pale mother sat at the farther end, and he, The youngest, cuddled beside her, or nestled him on her knee. Wet or dry, they must be there, morning and afternoon, Ere the bell had ceased to tinkle, or the clerk gave out the tune; And woe to him that came late, or who drowsily slept a wink, Or lost a head of the sermon, or dared of his play to think, Or fidgeted for a moment, weary of stiff constraint! It all came back on him now, with humour and pathos blent, And a something moist in his eye that somehow dimmed his view, As he thought, where now are they all that sat in the old church pew? Some at the ends of the earth, some farther even than they— Low in the quiet graves, by the surfbeaten sandy bay. Then he drew himself up, and muttered, Pshaw! why should I yield to this? I am a man of the world, and not a sentimental miss? I tell the tale as he told it me in the parlour inn at night, As we sat and smoked together by a guttering candle-light. After sitting well-nigh for an hour, he said, with a mind to go, Could I only have seen my way, but the close-packed throng said No; There was not room for an eel to wriggle itself outside, So I shifted and shifted my legs, and a change of torture tried; That was the most you could hope for, one side or other must be Prickly and stinging, or cramped and dead from the foot to the knee; At last the minister entered, a handsome fellow enough, Not like the country lout I had known in his homespun rough; Butterfly is not less like its caterpillar than he Looked like the memory of him I'd carried about with me. Then he was ruddy and strong, and now he was pale and thin— Was it with brooding of thought, or penance endured for sin? Spectacled too, though once he had seen like a bird of prey That from its rock-nest watches the near and the far away; Whiskers trimmed to a hair, and hair in a wavy curl, While every tooth in his mouth was white as a several pearl. He had the cleverest hands, too, alive to their finger-tips, Could make them speak to you plainly as ever he did with his lips: And his voice was mellow and deep, and clear and full as a bell, And touched in the higher tones a passionate thrill and swell. Perfect in rhetoric truly, verging on something more, Could he only have boldly ventured, and cut right into the core; Not much amiss with the thought too, or wrong in the argument, Could he only have once forgotten he had to be eloquent. He read like a man who well had conned the words that he read, Giving the meaning clear; and his prayers were fine, they said: Likely I am no judge, but I thought them a shade too fine; Rhetoric is not for God, any more than are pearls for swine. The voice, too, was more than the thought; and I asked myself sometimes, What Can any one find there, now, for his voice to be quavering at? But prayers, I allow, are not a kind of literature In which I can boast any skill, or quite of my taste be sure; Only one fancies, if earth and its praise could be left out of view, And the soul looked straight up to God—well, its words would be simple and few, While his were many and dainty, and every one said they were fine. Perhaps they were real: who knows? but I could not quite use them as mine. Then he gave out his text from the Psalm: “The fool hath said in his heart, No God!” and after a pause, with a stroke of excellent art, Repeated the three words “Fool!—No God!” 'mid a breathless awe— An orator's trick, of course, yet a palpable hit, one saw. Pity he did not stop there; just that look, that tone! Why, they were in themselves a sermon, had they only been left alone To hint their many suggestions. But some men have a way Of not knowing when to stop, and of unsaying what they say. That would have been the effect of his eloquence then upon me, Had the sermon ever been finished, which it was not fated to be. For mainly it was but a weft of Paley, and woof of Paul, Calico-printed with anecdotes, wholly apocryphal, Of Shelley and Hume and Voltaire, set forth with manifest trick, Clever enough in its way, of artfulest rhetoric. Not that there were not at times touches of something higher, When the man's own soul broke out, with gleams of a central fire, Through the crust of his pulpiteering; also there were some strokes Of a grim satirical humour—they were not exactly jokes, More like Elijah's biting scorn of the Prophets of Baal, Or the ring of the spear of Ithuriel, smiting the steel-clasped mail Of Satan. They were the bits of the sermon that I liked best: I seemed to look on the devil discomfited then with a jest Wholly sincere and natural. But that only came now and then; And after a while I was wishing me home at mine inn again, With that latest volume of Spencer's, and wondering what came next, When something went crack! somewhere, as the minister quoted his text To clench a paragraph with; and surely the gallery swayed Forward a bit, and the startled crowd rose up dismayed. A horrible moment that, when murderous panic appears, That tramples on pity, and heeds not grey hairs or the tenderest years, Nor kith nor kin nor aught, but the wretched self it would save, At the cost of its better self, from the coward-dreaded grave! They had sprung to their feet, and stood a moment in breathless fear, So silent that out on the roof the rain was plain to hear Which now was heavily falling; and then there arose a scream That curdled the blood in the heart, and I saw, as it were in a dream, Faces of men and women ghastly with terror, and all The galleries swaying, I fancied, away from the solid wall. But ere the fatal rush, the minister lifted high A tremulous hand to heaven—a jewelled one, by the by— And sang, in a loud, clear voice, one verse of a well-known psalm, Joined in by some few near, which brought back a moment's calm; Then he cried out, “Do not fear; not a hair of your heads shall fall If you do as I bid; for God has given me the lives of all. Let no one stir, till I tell you the doors are opened wide, Then silently go, while I pray that the Lord may meet with us outside.” That wrought like a spell on them; he was not like a man inspired, Yet the people gravely and silently did as he had desired, Slow moving along the aisles, and down by the narrow stair, Out by the several doors, and into the open air, In their disciplined self-command which their faith to them had given. Mean while in the pulpit he kept praying for them to heaven, Not at all “fine prayers” now, but the downright honest cry Of a man who longed and hoped that the poor folk might not die. I did not hurry myself, for I did not lose my head; But when the last had vanished, I drew a long breath, and said, “Well done, Parson and people! That was a sight to see, And better than any preachment the man could have preached to me.” For as they stood outside, ere taking their homeward ways, They sang to the Shepherd whose mercy had followed them all their days. Then, when the church was empty, straight into the vestry he went By the door behind the pulpit, and I followed him, for I meant Partly to compliment him on the ready wit he had shown, Partly to claim acquaintance, as a friend in the days long gone. But he hailed me at once by name, for mine was the one face he knew, So he said, in the thronging crowd, as he glanced from pew to pew; And where had I been? and had I come back to the old Home again, After long years of wandering far in the sun and the rain? And was he not glad to meet me, and to recall the times When we pored over Homer and Euclid, or hammered our brains for rhymes? It was pleasant to get such a greeting—so cordial, cheery, and frank— Like what you may find in your banker, when your balance is good at the bank. I was yielding then to the kindly feeling we have for those We have known at school or at college; and, thinking of hardish blows And rough horse-play he had borne from some of us then, I felt Some twinges of sharp regret, and my heart was beginning to melt, When there passed across his features a smile as of self-content, And I stayed the relenting mood, till I found out what it meant. “Now, tell me,” he said, “was that not a right smart stroke of mine, To sing that verse of a psalm which they all knew, line by line? It saved some score of their lives, and will be a good thing too for me, For the crowds will be bigger than ever wherever I happen to be. It was quite an impromptu thought, an inspiration plain, Like a burst of sunshine gleaming out of the clouds and rain; A minute more, and the throng would have trampled the old and the weak, Though I was not very much frightened—old joisting is apt to creak, And seats will crack with a weight they have not borne for years; But how people lose their heads, to be sure, in their panic fears! It is lucky for me, however. Somehow, I was losing my hold Of the folk, and my tellingest hits seemed to fall on them lifeless and cold; And there needed much advertising—which means a heavy expense— To gather a crowd worth speaking to, even on Sabbath. Hence I was thinking what could be done—it must be striking and new— To waken their interest in the things that are right and true. But this now will set me up quite; they will talk of it all through the week, And I shall have congratulations, and invitations to speak Every evening at meetings in town and village, when they Read in the morning paper what happened in church to-day. “I never could settle down to a millhorse round,” he said, “Of writing a weekly sermon, and visiting each sick-bed, Catechising the children, and comforting them that mourn, Blessing the young folk's weddings, and christening their babes when born. I tried it, of course, for a while; but I very soon came to see, Though it might be all right for some folk, it was not the work for me. Would you yoke your racehorse to a plough? My calling was clearly to preach, To put new fire in our pulpits, and rouse every heart I could reach By the art of the Orator, skilled to move now, and now to persuade, Leaving the task of the pastor to men of a commoner grade. Therefore, I have to be popular, have to be followed by throngs, And to hit at the sins of Dives, cry out at the poor man's wrongs, And drop the hum-drum of the pulpit, and maybe to startle men's ears— For no one would heed what I said, if I did not bring laughter or tears. Does it win any souls for God? you are fain to know; does it make Men's lives any purer and truer? or souls from their bondage break, And walk in the freedom of Right? Who knows? It is ours to sow The seed of the kingdom; and God, He only can make it to grow. I leave that to Him. Now and then, in the heat or the hush of a crowd, One will go off in a faint, and one will take to screaming aloud; But if their lives are bettered, I wot not. In every fight There are scores of bullets that miss, for one that kills outright. No doubt the vanities flourish, and sins are not less rife; I plant and water, but man cannot quicken to newness of life. Why do I yet hold on to a fruitless task? But is it So fruitless, sir, after all? These folk will remember my visit Here now, and talk of that psalm, I believe, till the day they die. You would wonder how many things happen to make them reckon that I Am surely a chosen vessel whom it will be good to hear. So, God has often sustained me, when my heart was faint with fear, And made me feel that He means me still to be doing His work, Dealing out bread to the hungry, and rousing a slumbering Kirk. “Yet I admit there are times when doubts do trouble me sore. 'Tis not like a full day's work, this preaching an hour or more, And I don't write sermons often—the old ones do as well When the place is new, and it's likely there's no one there could tell If they be old or new. Much study is hard on me, too, And I have to be careful of health. Life is precious. But if you knew My thoughts now and then, you would not envy this popular fame Which musters its thousands just at the trumpet-call of my name. For oft when I take up one of these sermons so carefully writ, All of them yellow with use, and glance at an eloquent bit, Meant for some passing event, which told very well at the time, The pathos seems to have vanished, and it sounds without reason or rhyme, And I ask myself, How will it look, when the reckoning comes, to say, There, that's all the fruit of my vineyard—the harvest of my poor day? Five score, more or less, of old sermons! And then, when my spirits were low, I have wished I had stuck to the croft where my father made barley to grow Instead of the rush and the ling. But of course, that was foolish, and came Of a jaded mind, and the strong recoil of an o'er-tasked frame Strained by emotional fervour. No, I can never repent Choosing the grandest of missions, on which the Apostles were sent, To preach the great gospel of peace.— I know not if you will care To wait on the afternoon sermon?” I told him I could not be there; But I would remember the plate—The workman was worthy his hire— So we parted, never to meet, at least if I get my desire. What a life that fellow must live! half knowing himself for the lie That he is, like the old Roman augurs that joked at their craft on the sly; But he has not even that help to relieve his troubled mind, He must try to believe he believes, and therein his comfort find. Hard for a small pretender to be preaching a faith that hates Hypocrites more than downright sinners, and nothing abates For one's poor circumstances, but will have a man to play The hero, who has not a touch of the hero to moisten his clay. Yes, I am sorry for him. How well now he managed that job— The singing and praying, and slow clearing out of the terrified mob! I wish that I had not gone after him into the vestry; so I might have believed in him now,— for it is not good to know That your very worst thoughts of men are the truest after all. And when you've painted a hero, 'twere best turn his face to the wall: You made him, and, if you would keep him, you must not look closely at him, Though, I grant you, that life feels poor when the glow and the glory grow dim. Ah well! I gave him his hire—to put in the plate, no doubt— But I'd give it him ten times over not to have found him out. RUGGLES, THE SALVATIONIST Nay, nobody converted me; I was not struck down by a sermon, And brought my evil way to see, And on the better way determine. I did not drop by happy chance Into some “Bethel” or “Little Salem,” To be arrested all at once, And get up in a pew, and tell 'em. Nor did some precious preacher meet My arguments with words in season, And bring me home in triumph sweet, The trophy of his cogent reason. Good Christians did not sing nor say Their joyful hallelujahs o'er me, Nor did their magazines display The work of grace that did restore me. I did not feel the sin of doubt, Nor haunt, like daws, the church and steeple, I did not turn me inside out For pleasure of the pious people. I could not do it. Why should one, With open wound, be fain to show it, And spread his heart out in the sun, That folk may stare, and flies may blow it? I don't deny that some may find Their sure way home in such a manner; But I was never of a mind To march beneath that kind of banner. I had not sinned the common way, I never was a base deceiver, I ne'er was in a drunken fray: I simply was an unbeliever. But look here; had you loved a maid, Sweet-natured and sweet-nurtured, saintly, Who lowly to the Father prayed, And told Him all her troubles quaintly, And had you set yourself to sap The faith by which she lived serenely, And round her shrinking soul to wrap Poor rags of doubt, that clothed her meanly, How would you feel, if one day she Gave back your thoughts in harder fashion, Of saintly things made mockery, And fired your doubts with eager passion? Would it not give you pause, at least, And make your faithless purpose falter, If you should hear the white-robed priest Break out blaspheming at the altar? Yes, you had worked for that, perhaps; Yet now 'tis come, you feel it shocking, And shudder at so strange a lapse, As if some fiend your soul were mocking. I had not thought how much her faith Had gone to make her perfect beauty, Nor what a change would come by death Of that which was her soul of duty. And I who loved her so, by way Of mending, marred God's fairest daughter, Who lately on His bosom lay Like water-lily on its water. She echoed now my thoughts, and I, The more she spake them, shrank to hear them; She thought to pleasure me thereby, And made me only loathe, and fear them. And then she sickened, and so died, Without a word of better cheering, As drifting on a sunless tide, And in a black cloud disappearing. O God! what horror fell on me! What anguish of a heart still aching, Hidden by day that none might see, But when the night came, like to breaking! I knew what Hell was then, all night As I lay sleepless, moaning, sighing, And could not wish to dwell in light, If she were in the darkness lying. And in that passion of grief I felt What shallow thoughts I had been airing, Seeing them now like snowflakes melt In depths of infinite despairing. I had deserved this;—it was right; A wrecker, I had served my Master, And piled up high a blazing light For luring souls on to disaster. For she whom I had loved so well, For whom my life I would have given, False-beaconed by that light of Hell, Had lost the guiding star of Heaven. Therefore I took my lonely way, Through clouds of thunder-darkness groping, And often like one dead I lay, Alike unfeeling and unhoping. Some tried to comfort me and spake Of healing for the chief of sinners; Some fain my settled gloom would break, By bidding me to balls and dinners. What matter, whether false or true, The word I heard from each new comer? Their fleeces might be dank with dew, But mine must be as dust in summer. In vain they reasoned with my mood, In vain a better hope unlifted, On one thing only I could brood— The soul that into darkness drifted. I clung unto my sharp remorse, And would not have its anguish lighter, But ever as it stung me worse, I clasped it to my bosom tighter. Still wrapt in dismal thought I stood, And from its gloom my light would borrow; It seemed my only sign of good, That I could feel such bitter sorrow. And so I took my lonely way In utter sadness and forsaking, I could not hope, I could not pray, I could not see a dim day-breaking. How could I for my sin atone, Except by suffering and dying? How could I think of her, alone And wretched, with the outcast lying? If she were there, there I must be, And by her side my soul must languish, Draining her cup of misery, And wringing out its dregs of anguish. I ought to die, and die in sin, Without a gleam of light to cheer me, My only hope that I might win A place where she would still be near me. And one night, sitting by the hearth, Which had no fire, but ashes only, A wet wind wailing o'er the earth, Eerie and dreary, and bleak and lonely, I thought to make an end of this, And know the worst that could befall me; When, lo! I seemed to feel her kiss, And hear her fond voice softly call me: “Be still, although thy heart may bleed, Take up thy load of life and bear it, Christ did not come to frame a creed, But to reveal the Father's Spirit.” And as I heard, that message dropt Dewy and sweet on my heart's throbbing; And ere its tender accents stopt, I like a little child was sobbing. I've not been deemed a saint since then, Well found in orthodox opinion, But I have loved my fellow-men, And o'er my thoughts held strict dominion, And hope that somehow all is well, That all will one day yet be righted, That none in hopeless darkness dwell Who may not yet with joy be lighted. For God is greater than His Word, His love is like a flowing river, His voice in all things good is heard, His Mercy doth endure for ever. HERR PROFESSOR KUPFER-NICKEL The lecture hall was filled with youth— Pencil and notebook ready—some Still, as in thoughtful search of truth, Some noisy as an empty drum; Here one was bearded like a goat, Another was some mother's pet, With gay cravat and dandy coat, And face smooth as a baby's yet. A seed-plot this of fruitful thought, A graveyard, too, of hopes and schemes, Where some shall grow, and some shall rot, And some shall prove but idle dreams. I sat me down; and by and by Came from behind the bema, brisk, A little man with clear blue eye, And giving his stiff gown a whisk, Tripped up, and spread his lecture out On the low desk; then all was hushed, As he, complacent, looked about, And we expectant were, and crushed. A small, brisk man, with little head, But yet compact, well-shaped, and round; And in his face there was no shade, And in his voice no tremulous sound; Features well chiselled, not one blunt; Thin-lipped, and with a fighting air; As keen to bear the battle's brunt, And nothing for his foeman care, With scorn for all who might resist His confident thoughts, and daring flights Into the realm of cloud and mist, To fill it with new patent lights: An able little man, and yet Not able quite for what he tried, Who had no doubt, and no regret, Nor haunting shadow at his side: Unconscious of the Mystery— The cross-light of a higher will— His ableness was plain to see, His littleness was plainer still. So standing there, he said, “Our course Of scientific search has been To purge you first, without remorse, Of cobwebs, and to sweep them clean, And let the daylight in. But man Must have some faith on which to live, Some purpose in his thoughts and plan, Which clearness to his world shall give. I call it faith; but 'tis, indeed, Only large reason bodying forth What lies enfolded in the seed We have been sowing. From the earth We clear away the former wreck, And cart the rubbish out of sight, Then straightway to our tools we take, To build anew, and build aright. No soul can stay on vacancy, Or on mere blank negations feed, And though we cease to bow the knee, We may not cease to have a Creed: And this is how I shape to me The new faith from the novel seed. “We grow from less to more; we rise From vital cells, by ordered schisms, To intricate complexities Of fine and subtle organisms— A tadpole now with breathing gills, Then lizard fit for land or lake, And by and by an ape that skills The husk of milky nut to break. And just as if great Nature kept Her moulds, that we might learn her ways, And how she wrought, and never slept, But grew through all the years and days, These phases of the coming race, These stages of the shaping Past, We in the unborn babe may trace That cheers some lonely home at last. So doth she keep her records true, Repeating in each life on earth What man hath been, and how he grew To fulness of his higher birth. “Why should we be ashamed to own Our humble kindred in the Past? Why scorn the seedling that hath grown Into so great a tree at last? Shall we not love all creatures more That they are of our flesh and blood, And that our ancestors of yore Squatted upon the oozy mud, Or floated, pulsing, in the sea Which brought forth every living thing, Or chattered on the cocoa tree, And nestled where the palm-leaves spring? For life is one and manifold, And all spring from the self-same roots, And we are ripe and growing old, And these are but the tender shoots. “Our Eden—'twas some moor or fen, Or rolling prairie at the best, The savage haunt of savage men Homeless and naked, like the rest Of Nature's products; only they Were creatures of a larger brain, Fitter on earth to make their way, And from the earth its wealth to gain. So, scheming brain and cunning hand Fashioned the flint-tool sharp and good, And smote the wild beast on the land, And hewed the oak tree in the wood. They made them snares for fish and bird, For hunger sharpened all their wits, And imitating sounds they heard For lures—the shrewdest of their hits— They framed at length articulate speech From owls and cats and wolves and rooks, Or seamew shrilling on the beach, Or song-bird by the murmuring brooks. Then from the flint one stole the fire, And blew the spark into a flame Which gave him all his heart's desire, And shaped his path to power and fame. “He found the wild spark in the flint, And tinder in the dry rush-pith, He found that thorns would burn by dint Of blowing, and he was—a smith, And wrenched the iron from the stone, And fused it with his subtle spark, Or lit the lamp, when day was done, And made a new day in the dark. With fire he offered sacrifice, When he his gods would please or thank, And baked the flesh, and boiled the rice, And with the gods he ate and drank. He worshipped it, yet made it work, And be his slave, and serve him well; He did not shut it in a kirk, And call men to it with a bell; But made it sail upon the sea, And snort along the iron road, And weave and knit for him; and be The lifter of his heavy load, Until he learned, at length, that he Himself was Lord of all, and God. “A long and troubled way he had Ere thus he came to clearest light; At times, his fancies drove him mad, And he was in an evil plight: At times through swamps of pious slush The ague-stricken soul must wade; Or hew a path through briar and bush By tangling metaphysics made; At times his leaders led him wrong, Or only right a mile or twain; But still the instinct, deep and strong, Unconscious brought him back again— Back to the bellows and the fire, Back to the anvil and the tool, Back to his inner heart's desire, And to the force that gave him rule. They fabled he was chained to rocks, And tortured by the frost and ice, And beaten by the tempest shocks On the sharp-pointed precipice, And torn by hungry birds of prey, And bleached and blanched by sun and rain, As he in proud defiance lay Through days and nights of racking pain. Yet is he lord of earth and air, And that high power to him was given To reign as Master everywhere, By stealing of the fire from heaven. So true the fable which averred Fire made him rival of the gods, For where the bickering flame is heard, Man rules, and Jove supinely nods. The Greek saw deeper than the Jew, In myth of high far-reaching kind He shadowed forth the grand and true Discoveries of the modern mind. “Materialist? why not? Who knows What subtle powers of life and thought Lie in an atom, hidden close To-day, but ere long to be brought, Like music, from it by the touch Of the night-wind upon a string? Words frighten fools, like ghosts, but such No terrors to the wise can bring. Lo! matter is a crystal here, A self-made rhomb, or octagon, And there a dewdrop, like a tear Wept, silent, when the day is done, A flower, an odour in the air, A gleam of light, blue-vaulted skies, A rainbow arching high and fair— Why not a thought, too, good and wise? Why should not brain deposit thought? They're not more alien and unlike Than what from many a gland is got, Or fire that from the flint we strike, Or currents of electric force, That acids make with metals twain. No need to seek another source Of thought beyond the thinking brain. We deal with facts; there's no such thing As spirit; that is out of date; Molecular tremors clearly bring The light which metaphysics hate. Who ever saw a soul? or who Can tell its strength or shape or size Or weight or taste or smell or hue? And who its parts can analyse? Enough that we have larger brain, And that we are no longer dumb, And that the furnace burns amain, And that we have a proper thumb. And for the rest, all men must die: Yet man shall live for evermore, His growing purpose soaring high, The only God he can adore— Humanity!—the noblest growth Of nature, and its lord and king, Its servant and its master both, The sum and crown of everything.” Musing, I rose, as he once more Tripped from the bema, looking brisk, And as he vanished through the door Giving his gown another whisk, Self-satisfied that he had shed A light that left no shadows, no Unanswered questions in the head, No aching in the heart to know, Whence all the longing of the mind For more than hard material gain, And clinging of the nobler kind To mysteries even of grief and pain, That fruit in spiritual riches, far Transcending wealth of wine and oil, Ingot of gold, and silver bar, And corn and all results of toil. Did Shakespeare's pregnant utterance bring Its wealth of words from owls and cats? Did Dante's musical pathos spring From squeaking of the mice and rats? And whence the life that from the cell Grows up in forms so manifold? And what, if earth whereon we dwell Shall be burnt up, as sages hold? Where then the man that shall be God, The God that must be man alone, When he and all whereon he trod, And all his homes and graves are gone? I heed not of a creed like this; It is too shallow even to hold The great facts of the life that is, And fit them in its little mould; And how much less its glimmering light Can pierce the unfathomed depths within, Or search for us the Infinite, Or mysteries of death and sin! It leaves more questions on the mind Than all it seems to answer clear; And darker is the cloud behind From the sharp light that shineth near. I know the life which now we live Is still becoming something more, Yet must I evermore believe In One to love and to adore, Who unto all did Being give, And Law they were created for. A DREAM I dreamt a dream. I dreamt that God was dead, And that we all met for His burial— Angels and men and devils—and sang or said An awestruck Requiescat o'er the head Of Him who was the Father of us all. Dreams have their logic and congruities; Granted the starting-point, and all the rest Flows, like our fables of the birds and trees, In spite of reason; and the dreamer sees No strangeness, even when they are eeriest. Methought all lights of heaven were quenched, yet light There was, but coming from another sphere, A lurid glimmer, and a ghastly sight; And horrid moanings filled the dismal night, And there were earthquakes shuddering far and near. A while we sat in silence, as the way At funerals is, or 'whispered 'neath our breath, With furtive glance, and faces hard and grey, And silent wonder who was meet to pray A fitting prayer at this world-darkening death. Then Satan strode to the chief mourner's place, Though Michael frowned, and Gabriel blocked his path, And Moses lifted up his grand, meek face, As on that day of shame and deep disgrace When he the tables brake in holy wrath. “Silence!” the tempter cried; “is this a time For family quarrels? 'Tis my rightful due, I am the eldest born. Is it a crime That I should sorrow most for that sublime First Cause whom I have grieved far more than you? “I am the Prodigal, 'tis true. What then? Must I be always of the same wrong mind! Is there repentance for the sons of men, And fatted calves when they come back again, And only swine's husks still for me to find? “I have more cause for sorrow than you all Who stayed at home, and did as you were bid, But, ever since my most unhappy fall, I've always meant some day up here to call, And be forgiven for all the ill I did. “And now it is too late. I've often heard That said by some poor fool at my suggestion, But never quite knew how his heart was stirred, Till now; and really 'tis an ugly word, Sour in the mouth, and bitter of digestion. “Your grief is not like mine. You've lost a friend Who loved you, but you never vexed His heart, As I have done. Can you not then extend Pity for one who has some ways to mend, And some bad memories of a guilty Past? “That's the worst of a day like this; they buzz Like wasps—these memories—and their sting is sore, And like the Patriarch when he came from Uz, They won't go back—nothing unpleasant does— But cling to you, and sting you more and more. “I can't deny that I have told some lies, And done some things I never should have done; But is there any who is always wise? And I was wroth to forfeit such a prize, And, when you lose your temper, all is gone. “You have believed me sometimes when I lied, Can't you believe me now I speak the truth? You ought to know how hard it is for pride To say, I'm sorry. But I wish to abide Once more among the old friends of my youth. “Have you no kindness for me? Yes, I know, I am blunt-spoken, have not your smooth tongues, Am out of the way of singing hymns that flow Like rippling waters murmuring soft and low;— In our place we have need of all our lungs. “You will not? You Impeccables! But you, At least, who were my friends and followers once, Ye men of faith who now are good and true, Though all my arts and wiles ye, one time, knew, Ah! ye will not refuse me this last chance? “What! not a word? you're all in the same boat, And none of you believe I can repent? Well; it is somewhat hard, and might be thought Scarce creditable to those of you who taught Some tricks to me, for which I now relent. “But I am sorry none the less, I say, For what has happened to the Great First Cause, Who never lost faith in the righteous way, Nor in the Love which was His light of day Where'er He walked, and Lord and Master was. “It might be weak, but surely it was good— Most goodness is a trifle weak, no doubt, Especially if longer than you should You still persist in your so virtuous mood, And will not trim your sail, and veer about. “Well; He was truly better than you all, For He could pity one when at the worst, Though pity, I confess, brings comfort small To one whose back is fairly at the wall, Beaten and baffled and hated and accursed. “No matter; now my way of life is dim, Stupid and without interest any more. 'Twas He that kept you—cherub and seraphim— Out of my toils, and were it not for Him, I should have trapped you daily by the score. “There's no use for a Devil now, since He Is gone; 'twould be like shadow without light; Only where light is can the shadow be, It was His presence that occasioned me, And by my wrong I perfected His right. “But now my task is done. 'Tis not worth while Planning and plotting for the like of you. What gives its zest to any clever wile Is the uncertain match of truth with guile; That gone, there's nothing worth one's while to do. “The prize once sure is nothing—let it go, The fisher cares not for the fish he snares; Only to find if he can master so The cunning that contends with his, or no, He throws his line, and pities not nor spares. “But you without Him! 'Tis poor sport indeed Gulling what comes so ready to one's hand, Wasting fine with where wit you do not need, And plying arts to sow the wild rank weed, Which, without art, grows native in the land. “Life will not be worth living any more, And for a change, what if I preached to you, And told you to be good, and to adore His memory whom you trembled at before? That would be rare sport now, and something new. “It's not the first time that I've preached indeed, Very good preaching too and orthodox, Exalting still the faith above the deed; And how men did devour my words with greed, And went away, and sinned like other folks!” He stood erect, a mocking spirit bold, Having no faith in aught but craft and lies, And full of scorn that bitter was and cold, And good and bad in like contempt did hold, And even himself did fitfully despise. Then a voice cried, “There shall be no more light, The war is ended, evil is supreme”; But I was fain to wrestle for the right, And beaded drops of anguish dimmed my sight— Then I awoke, and lo! it was a dream. I woke up, with a trembling sense of guilt Upon me, as if that wild dream, profane And blasphemous, must surely have been built Of some vile matter in my heart that dwelt, By some base spirit lurking in my brain. But as I brooded on it there appeared Another meaning slowly breaking through The lurid light, and horrid sounds, and weird Wild phantasms of my dream; and as it cleared Peace came to me again, and comfort grew. I had been reading far into the night That “ultimate analysis of things Can find no need of God, nor any light Shed, by the thought of Infinite wisdom and might, On the large world which Law to order brings.” “No need of this hypothesis,” one writ; And the free fancy, roving like the wind Untrammelled, shaped my dream, and guided it With strange, unconscious reason, and flash of wit Too daring for the common day o' th' mind. No need of God for science! But our life Is more than knowledge, and hath other needs, When sorrows come, and troubles too are rife, Or good and evil wrestle in hot strife, And the heart fails, and wounded virtue bleeds. Truly he said, though he that said it still Is father of all lies, that we should be The easy victims of his crafty skill, Were there no God to strengthen heart and will, And guide the soul through its perplexity. 'Tis not the making of the worlds alone That calls for His wise thought, and shaping hand, To frame the atom, and compact the stone, And breathe a mystic life through flesh and bone, And stretch the heavens above the solid land. There be more lawless and rebellious powers Than ordered matter, which need government And guidance more than growth of plants and flowers, Even these same wayward, wilful hearts of ours, Deceitful, that on evil ways are bent. And when our steps have spurned the appointed course Of duty, and sunk in miry slough of sin, And guilty fears rush on us with the force Of billows, who shall heal our keen remorse, And, speaking mercy, bring back peace within? With lightsome heart, as if it were a thing Too trifling to regret, one says to me, I have no prayer to pray, no praise to sing, Nor sacrifice nor offering do I bring, There is no living God, and man is free. Ah! better to be smitten day by day— For there is comfort in His staff and rod— Than wander in that mist, and lose thy way Among the crags and chasms that grimly say, No need so great now as thy need of God. MORAL-SUBLIME Sakya-mounie one day saw a tiger, Shrunk i' the flanks, his staring ribbones bare, Creep from the jungle, shuddering as if rigor Of famine-stricken death had seized him there. A splendid creature, but for pinching hunger, With huge forearm, and ravenous white-toothed jaws, Branded with beauty, when his days were younger, But age had somewhat blunted teeth and claws. Then said the Buddha; “Lo! this beast ferocious, Devouring me, shall straight grow mild and meek, And turn with horror from his deeds atrocious, His spirit gentle as his skin grows sleek. “For now he is a fell man-eating villain, Watching for women going to the well, Waiting the lonely traveller to kill in The quiet evening, in the lonely dell. “But I shall be a graff in his wild nature, To sweeten all his blood, and change his ways: Wherefore I gladly offer the Creator This ransom to redeem his evil days. “If he go on as now, he'll grow still wilder; In him there is no spirit of sacrifice; But, me devouring, he will soon turn milder, And part with all his fierce blood-thirsty vice.” Laughing I read, half thinking that he jested, Though he was nowise of the jesting kind; And to the fancy which his thought suggested Awhile I yielded up a willing mind. I pictured him, then, and the jungle-tyrant, Who scrupled not to smite him to the ground, And bear him off, lest haply some aspirant Might claim a share in that which he had found. Tigers, of course, have solitary habits, And haunt where brown and yellow leaves are strewn; They're not companionable beasts like rabbits, And much prefer to eat their meals alone. Weak as he was, and perishing with hunger, I saw him, with my mind's eye, take a leap, And, with a snort of pleasure or of anger, Bear off the Buddha to the nullah deep. Did the poor victim feel the great fangs in him, As they tore through the jungle to his lair? And only think, What matter, if I win him To pity those whom now he would not spare? Or did he now repent, when it was plainly Too late to think of anything but death? Or did he think of nothing, but was mainly Concerned to get a gasp of hurried breath? The tiger had his meal—I'll not describe it; These creatures are not nice—then laid him down, With good digestion slowly to imbibe it Into his system well, from claw to crown. But there were some odd fragments—not to harrow Your feelings, for your flesh might creep at this— Them first he hid for breakfast on the morrow, Then stretched him out in perfect tiger-bliss. And as he slept, he dreamed—I do not wonder, Sure such a meal would set one dreaming fast— He dreamed another Buddha had fallen under His fangs, to be devoured too like the last. He dreamed of crunching bones to reach the marrow, Of his head buried in the softer part, Of spurting blood that shot forth like an arrow, And of some dainty morsels near the heart. A horrid dream for one who had been grafted With a meek nature meant to sweeten him; But he had tasted blood, and now he quaffed it, At pleasure, in a dream-world wild and grim. And on the morrow, not to waste his treasure, He raked it up, and had another feast, And then another dream, so doubling pleasure, As if he were a mere cud-chewing beast. No thought had he of growing soft and tender, Of sparing women going to the well, Or being the poor traveller's defender From other cats that in the jungle dwell. He had no touch of Buddha's gentle spirit, Nor any taste of chivalry at all; That ghastly murder seemed a deed of merit, To be repeated, nowise to appal. The brute, no doubt, was hopelessly ferocious, To eat a Buddha full of love and ruth, And only feel how much the deed atrocious Had reinforced the fierceness of his youth. So did I picture, as my fancy willed it, The good man and his fruitless sacrifice— The blood he wasted, and the brute that spilled it, Having no thought of virtue or of vice: Having no wit, but just to stanch his hunger With juicy meat that pleased his unspoilt taste, And gave him pleasant sleep and made him stronger To hunt for prey about the jungle waste. That was the touch too much—that tiger story— Which makes a caricature ridiculous, Rubbing the tinsel pathos off and glory, To tickle mirthful humour born in us. Were one an owl upon the high barn rafter Staring in serious gravity, or Nun That had forsworn the wanton trick of laughter— Then one might read, and fail to see the fun. But though I would behold with reverence fitting What sacred is to any soul on earth, Yet this mad fooling of a mind, unwitting The humour of it, wakens mocking mirth. Moral-sublime! nay, but the brain-sick dreaming Of mind diseased, which we could pity, indeed, Were we not challenged to admire the seeming Virtue that propped up a fantastic creed. And yet, perchance, like other tales that wander Down through the ages, this too has been changed; Buddha may ne'er have thought his life to squander On the fierce brute that through the jungle ranged. But some poor scribbler, fain to exalt his merit, Some plodding dullard, guiltless of a jest, Thus fondly hoped to show the Master's spirit, And only his own folly well expressed. So are the great and good ill understanded, What time their Faith a dead tradition grown, And on the doctors and the schoolmen stranded, Breaks up, a wreck upon the sand and stone. They were not fools, those men, who earth's distractions Left for an aim that still our spirit stirs: Enough, to answer, only for their actions, Not for the stories of biographers. MIRREN She was but a maid of all work, For she could not bear to see Idle sluts about her kitchen Slopping tables with their tea; And besides, she had a habit Of speaking out her mind Which might not look respectful If another stood behind; For she'd scold a wasteful mistress Very roundly to her face, But would not let another Think a thought to her disgrace. She had seen her fifty winters, But was always trim and tight In her printed cotton bodice, And her apron clean and white: Never knew her head a bonnet, But a cap of muslin thin With a bit of simple ribbon Tied in bows beneath her chin: And her features, small and puckered, Looking tempery and tart, Did not truly tell the secret Of her true and faithful heart. All the folk that did not know her— And there were not many did, For her faults were somewhat patent, And her virtues mainly hid— Much disliked her prim preciseness, And her stiff unchanging ways, And the tartness of her sayings, And the scrimpness of her praise. But the children, whom she rated If their boots had soiled her floor, Knew how fain she was to cheer them, When their little hearts were sore. She had never left the city, Rarely seen the growing corn, Never been a five-miles' journey From the spot where she was born, Never voyaged in a steamboat, Never travelled by the mail, And nothing could persuade her To go jaunting on the rail. But she knew the streets and closes, And the harbour and the boats, And the kindly fishers' houses, And their creels and nets and floats. And all the grand old mansions Where the gentry once did dwell, With their cork-screw stairs and turrets, And their chambers panelled well, And the stately Lords and Ladies Who had ridden from their doors, And the fateful tragic dramas Oft enacted on their floors,— She could tell you stories of them, Till a feeling in you woke That the nobles must have sorrows Not allowed to common folk. Going weekly to the market, You might safely trust her care Not to squander one halfpenny Of your thrifty monies there; She would have the best and cheapest, Yet she would not chaffer long; They might cheat a young housekeeper, But they feared her caustic tongue; Nor would she for a moment Linger in the sun or rain; She had gone to do her business, And must home to work again. Going weekly to the Kirk too, Be the Sunday dry or wet, With her Bible in her kerchief, And her features primly set, There she sat in tireless patience, Thinking less about her sin Than about her common duties, And the frets she had therein, Not unpleased that she had done them With some credit to herself, And with visions of her saucepans All in order on their shelf. One day she told her mistress, She must find another maid: No, she had no fault to find with Any thing they did or said, And she was not like the fickle Fools that wanted just a change, Nor did she much rebel at That new-fangled kitchen range; And she had not made her mind up To take a place or no; There was nothing she was sure of, Only just that she must go. Plainly there was something hidden; There was mystery in her look; But she pursed her lips, and held it Tight as in a close-sealed book. They wist not, when she left them, What had wiled her thus away, Puzzling over it, and guessing Twenty different things a day; They were angry, for they missed her, Nothing seeming to go smooth; But the pathos of it touched them, When they came to know the truth. She had served a gentlewoman, When they both were fresh and young; They had smiled and sighed together, And together wept and sung. Proud was Mirren of her mistress While her beauty was in bud, Yet prouder to remember She was come of gentle blood, Having Lords to her forefathers, With Ladies by their side, And loves and wars to tell of, And tragic tales to hide. But the lady, when her beauty 'Gan to have a faded look, Mated with a man beneath her, Which her handmaid could not brook. Why could she not live single? Maidenhood was clean and sweet; If wed she must, why pick him From the gutter on the street? She had never served but gentles And she trowed she never would, So they quarrelled, and they parted. Both of them in angry mood. And the lady had her wedding, Though a stranger dressed her hair. And a hand she had not proven Robed her in her garments fair. But the marriage-bed was barren, And the wedded life was shame, For he wasted all her substance, And he soiled a noble name; Till friendless and forsaken, With a hot and fevered eye, In weariness and sickness She prayed that she might die. But as she sat despairing The door was opened wide, Then closed again in silence, And one stood by her side, As of old so trim and tidy, As of old with bodice bright, With the dainty cap of muslin, And the apron clean and white; As of old so peppery tempered, As of old so prim and tart; But also underneath it Lay the old, true, faithful heart. And she pushed a bag of something Right into the lady's hand, Saying, “Not a word, Miss Elsie, It is by the Lord's command; I've been toiling, scrimping, saving, Till my bones and joints would ache, And I've put my soul in peril All for filthy lucre's sake. Save me now from that temptation, Give my soul a chance of life, For I've just been self-deceiving, Though I have been no man's wife. “Now get you to the parlour, This is not the place for you, I am mistress of my kitchen, And I have my work to do; Take your seat beside the window; There you'll see the breezy bay, And the brown sails of the fishers Dipping in the white sea-spray, And the children pulling seaweed, And the old man gathering bait, And lads the old boats mending That are in a leaky state, And the lighthouse on the skerry, And the red lamp on the pier, And the lass that's always waiting For the ship that comes not here. “Oh, you'll never weary watching The ships that come and go, Or to hear the sailors singing As they turn the capstan slow; Some are bound for far Archangel, Some for Greenland's snow and ice, Some, it's likely, for a harbour In the land of Paradise. But the hand of God is o'er them, And behind them and before, And the gate of Heaven as near them On the sea as on the shore. “O my bonnie, sweet Miss Elsie, My blessing and my care, You'll break my heart now, sitting With that look of hard despair; Rouse ye up, there's work to do yet, And peace for you to win, And the web of life is never Only sorrow warped with sin. There's sunshine in the rain-cloud, And heat in wreaths of snow, And God's love is in all things That happen here below.” So Mirren pleaded fondly, And her plea prevailed at last, And they lived together loving, As they had done in the past. The lady broidered garments, Or darned the dainty lace, Which her handmaid washed as no one Could wash in all the place; And if their fare was scanty, No eye was there to see, As they held themselves aloof still In the pride of poverty. Trim was still the lady's raiment, Never seeming to grow worse, And she never lacked the glitter Of a gold-piece in her purse; And on the Bishop's visit She could give him rare old tea— For of course she went to Chapel Duly with the Quality. The Bishop for her lady Was the fitting minister; But the Kirk was still to Mirren The house of God for her. So the weeks went by in patience, And the Sabbaths brought their peace, And the years sped lightly o'er them, Though their labours did not cease; And in the summer mornings They saw the sun rise red, And the sea a golden pavement, Whereon his feet might tread; And in the winter evenings O'er their needles and their frames They told most tragic stories Of the old-world knights and dames. And their way of life was tranquil, And their thoughts were pure and sweet, And the poor that lived beside them Thought the better of the street, When the gentry came to see them, And the great world, in the pride Of its carriages and horses, Drew the children to its side; Though a grander world was inside If they had but eyes to see The faith and love that dwelt there, And true-hearted piety. A DARK EVENING The night is darkening, and the tide is leaping Upon the narrow stretch of lessening shore, Soon to engulph it, while the mists are creeping, And folding round behind me and before. My world is growing small and dim and lonely, And its brief day of brightness closing fast, I have for comrades ghostly shadows only, Whose voices are but echoes from the past. They went before me, some in youthful pride, In manhood some, or noble womanhood, And none may take their places by my side, Or make this life, as they did, full and good. Much love was given me, far beyond my merit; And its fond service, and its tender touch, And words and sweet caressings haunt my spirit— O God, that I had only loved as much! 'Tis not the love we get, but that we give, Which leaves glad memories for the coming years,— Rich after-glows of sunset, and we live, And scarce feel any sorrow in our tears. I've lived my life; its task of work is ended, And there is little more for me to do; Oh that its ill done job might yet be mended! That I could make it loving, brave, and true! There! wrap it up—I dare not look upon it, The wretched failure! put it clean away; Nothing can mend it, nothing will atone it,— Bury the poor dead product of my day. FOUND AND LOST I had this incident from M. Lemprière, to whom it was communicated by one of the parties concerned in it. I knew him the moment he came Past the screen by the folding door, Though I could not remember his name, Or where I had seen him before: And me, too, he knew at a glance, For a light kindled up in his eye When I stept a short step in advance, And greeted him as he passed by. Yet it was not a notable face;— Just what you may meet any day At the hunt or the ball or the race, Or the club or a country-seat; Somewhat ruddy, high-featured, and full, With well-chiselled nostrils and chin, Eye blue, like a clear crystal pool, And the hair on his temples was thin. A forgetable face in this land, Where so many are cast in its mould, Nothing striking about it, or grand, Only handsome and manly and cold. I was over with Soult, and had seen “The Duke” and “Sir Peel” and the rest, At the time when they crowned their young Queen, Yet this was the face I knew best. Each feature stood clear in my mind, And how in his moods it would look, When troubled or fretful or kind, Or chastened by pain and rebuke. 'Twas strange how familiar I seemed With the trick of that face and its truth: Was he some one of whom I had dreamed? Or perhaps an old friend of my youth? But where had I seen him? and when? And his name, too, what could it be? I had mixed in the world among men, I had travelled by land and by sea; Could I hope, in the vanishing throng Of memories fast growing dim, To pick out this one man, among The crowd, and identify him? You have felt how a name or a word At the tip of your tongue shall appear, And you know it so well, 'tis absurd That you cannot lay hold of it clear; So I seemed to be still on the nick Of finding out who he could be, When lo! by some cozening trick He was gone, like that lost word from me. As I gazed after him, too, I caught A look 'twas not hard to divine; It was plain that the very same thought Was brooding in his head as mine. For he knit his brows hard as he cast A swift, searching glance now and then At the face he had known in the past— But where had he seen it, and when? Then he whispered to Soult, and I knew That my general told him my name; But my name did not give him the clue That he wished, and he still looked the same. I did as he did, too, and heard His name from the man at the door; But it was just a strange foreign word, And I never had heard it before. So we stood there apart in the throng, A wonder and puzzle to each, Nor heeded the harp or the song, Or the hiss of their sibilant speech, Though he chatted with Soult of the wars, While I waited on, silent of course— He was a milord, and had stars, And I but a captain of Horse. But he tired of this puzzling, and soon Had put it quite out of his head; For I marked him keep time to a tune, And laugh when a good thing was said. These Islanders are not like us; Quite patient of mystery they; But a secret that fascinates thus We must search, till we clear it away. I could not, then, rid me of it, But brooded in silence apart, Nor laughed at their humour and wit, Nor praised what they showed of their Art. They thought me a churl, no doubt, For my answers were not to the point; And I thought they were talking about Merest nothings, and all out of joint. Not once did he cross me again, I am sure, for a week and a day; But still in the sun and the rain, In the season of work and of play, He haunted me all day and night, And this way and that way I went, Ever groping about for the light, Like a hound that is seeking the scent. I searched out my memories all, Went over the Past like a book, Page by page, even dared to recall Things that covered my soul with rebuke— Whom I'd gambled with, drank with, or fought, Who were rivals in old love affairs, Who was owing me money, or ought To be paid what I owed, unawares. Strange things by that search were revealed, Old stories not good to recall, Things that Fate, too, for ever had sealed, Wrongs that could not be righted at all. Who shall ope all his cupboards, and find Nothing there to repent or regret, No scraps of old writing that blind With tears the dim eyes that they wet? Yet 'twas good for me so to review My former life, scene after scene; It gave me some thoughts that were new, And revived better thoughts that had been. It shamed me no less, here and there, And it set me to putting things right; But on this one perplexing affair It shed not a glimmer of light. Not a drop of his blood had I shed, Not a livre was he in my debt, Not a card with him e'er had I played, Nor as rivals in love had we met. I was baffled, and threw myself down Ont he close-shaven grass of the Park, And heard the far hum of the town, And the clear even-song of the lark. Then all of a sudden, when I With long, fruitless searching was spent, Half-minded no longer to try, Lo! one unconnected event, Which, neither before nor behind, Had linked itself on to my thought, Broke clear as a star on my mind, And I knew I had found what I sought. One moment the curtain concealed Every hint of the scene and the play; Then Phew! all the stage was revealed In the blaze of a bright summer day; And I knew that I had him at last, Knew, without any doubt, it was he— That face, in the far away Past, That lay so long staring at me. We had had a brisk skirmish one day Of outposts, when Soult was in Spain, And wounded and bleeding I lay, Thinking ne'er to do battle again; And the vultures were soaring up high, And the lean dogs were creeping about, And the grey-hooded crow, hopping nigh, Kept watch for the life to ebb out. I lay on the bank of a stream, A brooklet some yard or two wide, That whispered to me like a dream As it slowly lapsed on by my side— A dream of our beautiful France, With its white orchard bloom and its grain, And the vintages gay in Provence, I was never to look on again. And right on the opposite bank A handsome young English face Kept gazing at me with a blank, Vague look from his red resting-place. “He is plainly dying,” I said, “But gallant and stout for his years”; For close by his side, and stark dead, Lay one of our brave cuirassiers. So hour after hour there we lay, And looked at each other across The brook that went trickling away, Slowly licking our blood from the moss; Now we heard the loud bugle-calls clear, Then the noise of the fighting grew weak, And the lean dogs came snarling up near, And the hooded crow whetted his beak. And all those long hours I perused His features there, line upon line, Half-conscious and dim and confused, As he, too, lay reading at mine; I scanned him again and again, He was the one thing I could see, And he printed himself on my brain, Till he seemed like a portion of me. If I closed my eyes, still he was there As plain as he had been before; If I lifted my eyelids to stare, He was lying there dabbled in gore. “He is plainly dying,” I thought, “And better for me he were dead, Those pain-stricken features will not Be e'er blotted out of my head.” And never a word could we speak; I was lying half-choked with my blood, Slow-gasping and fainting and weak, And grasping a handful of mud; While he from the opposite brink Looked across, as if looking his last; And oh for some water to drink From the brook that went rippling past! Then there fell, as it were, a great mist On my eyes, and I saw him no more, Nor thought of him even, nor wist Was he living or dead, till the door Of the guest-hall opened, and he Strode stately into the room, And that face flashed out upon me, Like a face from the shades of the tomb. Now it all came back, and I rushed To his club to remind him again Of the day when our life-blood had gushed, And mixed in the brooklet in Spain: But I found he had gone, as they said Was his way, whither nobody knew, Perhaps, where the icebergs are bred, Perhaps, to Japan or Peru. A traveller, restless and bold, He would turn now his wandering feet To seas that were frozen with cold, Now to plains that were blasted with heat: He knew the Red man of the West, Had rid with the wild Bedaween, And oft been the African's guest, Where the spoor of the lion was seen. Yet would he come back, they averred, And take his old seat by the fire, As if nothing meanwhile had occurred To make foolish people admire. But I never have seen him again! And oh to know what it could mean, That printing of him on my brain Who was only once more to be seen. We are tricked by illusory light, Are we mocked by realities too? Is our life but a dream of the night Whose facts have no purpose in view? So strangely my path he had crossed! So strongly my mind had impressed! If he must like a shadow be lost, Why passed he not light as the rest? You paint a likeness with care, Yet smudge it all out the next day, For you feel that the soul was not there, And the soul is the man, as you say: But what if your picture were all You had hoped e'er to make it, and then You turned the face back to the wall, Which was touching the spirits of men? Do you grudge them the joy they have found? Do you mean but to mock and to spite? Why sow the quick seed in the ground But to trample it next out of sight? God or Nature, that shapes each event, Does He labour to quicken desire, Just to disappoint hopes He has sent, Just to quench His own fresh-kindled fire? It is dark to me, dark as the night That moonless and starless moves on, With only such glimmer of light, As to show the clouds brooding thereon. And I never shall see him again, Or know what was meant by the look That was printed so deep on my brain, As we lay by the slow Spanish brook. THE LETTRE DE CACHET In the days when France snapt her old chains, And rose up, and swore, “We are men, we have hearts, we have brains, We will slaves be no more To king or to noble or priest, But all men shall be As brothers from bondage released, All equal and free”: And some stood in wonder amazed, Their wits of no use; And some said the people were crazed, And Bedlam broke loose; And some, in pure terror aghast, In troops ran away; But some held it safer to cast Them into the fray; While others took snuff with a smile, As they tramped through the mud, Saying, “Time we should teach this Canaille By the letting of blood.” Well, the people were mad, if you will, In those days of hot rage, Yet the shout of their multitudes still Was the pulse of the age, And the hope of the nations around, Who waited on, dumb, Thinking, “We too are fettered and bound: Let us see what will come.” But their kings and their nobles and priests Gnashed their teeth when they saw, And screamed at their altars and feasts, “Ho! for God and the law! Did He not make us lords of the world, And these for our slaves? Let our armies be mustered, and hurled On their heads like sea-waves.” In those days, then, when bold spirits ran From prison to prison, They came on a squalid old man, Half-reft of his reason, Who had been shut up for long years In a stone-vaulted cell Wet-walled with his sweat and his tears— Why, no one could tell. No record there was of his crime, If crime he had done; No trial had he at the time When they shut out the sun From his life; and alone there he lay, And heard not a sound, Save the grating of bolts once a day In the silence profound, Or the fall of a drop on the floor From the roof overhead, Though the streets might be all in a roar To have wakened the dead; And he dreamed, as he lay on his straw, Of the sun and the lark, And day followed day, and he saw But the dusk and the dark; For at noon it was gloaming down there, And at evening, as death; And still in the close, fœtid air He was gasping for breath.— So our shepherds took care that their flocks Should not stray from the fold, If stone walls and strong bars and locks Might be trusted to hold. But the bands of that mighty revolt Flung open his door, And cried, as they shattered the bolt, “Thou art free, as of yore When, a schoolboy, thy wont was to stray By the wood and the brook, And the trout in the ripple would play With the gay-feathered hook; Or when, as a man thou would'st go To the tryst in the glen, And love whispered, tender and low, What is dearest to men. Come forth from thy wet-walled cell, Where the damp and the mould And the dusk and the dark ever dwell With the cramp and the cold; Be merry, the land now is free, And thy gaoler, the king, Is where all wicked kings ought to be— Go dance, then, and sing.” They were rough, coarse fellows; and yet They were touched to the quick By the pale, bloodless spectre that met Their gaze, and the sick Wan flicker of light in his eye, Which had not any hope, Nor a longing to live or to die,— Content just to mope, Without converse of things unseen, To sweeten his pain, Or remembrance of things that had been, To restore hope again. So dazed, and uncertain, he crept From his cell and his straw, And they marked that he trembled and wept, When the sunlight he saw; And blinked, bewildered and blind, Like an owl or a bat, Feeling out with his lean hands to find What he wished to be at; For he had not seen daylight for years, Only dim, pallid gleams Through stanchions and cobwebs and tears, Or at night in his dreams. And it was not a joy, but a pain To look on the light, Or to see human faces again, Or to stand straight upright. So, dazed and amazed, forth he went Through the iron-nailed gate, All tremulous, shrinking, and bent,— A man out of date. He passed through the iron-nailed door, For they said he was free To do as he had done of yore, When the hill and the sea And the wood and the heath and the stream Knew his coming so well— Unless it was only a dream He had dreamt in his cell. Was he not once a lord, and had lands, And a chateau somewhere, And serfs who obeyed his commands, And a wife passing fair— Too fair—or was all that again A dream and no more? There were so many passed through his brain As he lay on the floor 'Mong the straw, and had nothing to do. Yea, a dream it had been, For a king must be loyal and true To his peers and his queen. Then he smote his thin palm on his brow, As if striving to see What would never come clear to him now- Best never to be! Just a glimmer of light broke on him, With a spasm of pain, Then the grey look, sodden and dim, Settled on him again. Oh the horror and terror of that Aimless walk up the street! Was he sleeping or waking? and what At next turn should he meet? Now his ear was jarred with the strain Of the wild Marseillaise; Then his heart was smit with the pain Of some wolf-hungry gaze. And why were the workmen abroad In the hours of their toil? And where were the good priests of God With the pyx and the oil? And where was his light-hearted France, And its wit-loving soul? And who were those dames in the dance Of the mad Carmagnole? And oh the fell rush and the tramp Of the hurrying throng! And the sights here and there by the lamp, As they bore him along, Where they'd hoisted a noble, perhaps,— As the nobles of yore Nailed the vermin they caught in their traps To the big barn door,— With maybe a priest by his side In his old black soutane— They were fain to have priests, when they died, So they coupled the twain. And then, as he shuddered and stared, The tumbril drove past With the victims that law had ensnared— Some pale and aghast, Some gay as to wedding they rode, Some mocking with scorn The crowd, that was raging for blood Of the high and well-born. There were matrons and maidens fair, Who bent their heads low; No powder they need for their hair, It is white now as snow. There were old men and boys doomed to die; What could it all mean? And lo! in the distance rose high The black guillotine. As they hurried him onward, at first He would shout like the rest, As if some fell demon accursed Had got into his breast. But at length on the skirt of the crowd The madness was quelled, And his soul within him was bowed At the sights he beheld. Could that be the pulse and the throb Of a great-thoughted age— That hoarse, fierce yell of a mob In its masterless rage? How they jostled and struggled and plashed Through the mire and the mud. The frantic Unbreechedand Unwashed, In their craving for blood! Once more for a moment his brain Had clearness and power, And the soul of his youth came again In that terrible hour. He had fain closed his eyes at the sight He was looking on there; But so strong was the spell in its might That he could not but stare, While he sickened to gaze on that hell Of the fiend and the brute, Which was holding him fast in its spell, Tongue-tied there and mute And where were the nobles of France, And the knight and the squire? And where were the sword and the lance, And the cord and the fire? And where was the king and the throne, And the order of state? And where all the world he had known, And forgotten of late? Flashed a light in his eye, and a frown On his forehead was plain; Then the dull grey look settled down Apathetic again. Next day he came back to his gaol, Looking weary and sore, And prayed with a pitiful wail They would open its door. No, he had not committed a crime; He had just lost his head, And he did not belong to the time, And his friends were all dead. Would they not let him back to his cell, And its straw and its peace? And there for the rest he would dwell, Till death brought release. “For it pains me, the glare of the light, And they fill me with fear, The horrors that meet me by night, And the sounds that I hear. Still the tocsin is ringing and ringing, And women are seen That song of the Marseillaise singing Round the black guillotine; And princes and nobles are killed By the axe and the cord, And orgies of darkness are held In the courts of the Lord; And there is not a priest to confess, Nor a monk begging alms, Nor a pyx for a soul in distress, Nor a nun singing psalms. And all in confusion is whirled, And strangeness and fear; And I have but one friend in the world, And lo! he is here.” So they let him go back to his cell, And the straw and the mat And his friend, who could he be? Ah! well; The friend was a rat. Do you mock at my story because Thus lamely it ends, But the man in a prison-cell has Small choice of his friends: Just turns from the hard stones to aught That has life in it—now To a seedling flower, chance blown, and taught In his window to grow; And now to a spider whose web Was devouring his light, For life clings to life in the ebb And dead hour of its night; And there is a pathos where such Fond clinging appears, A something human to touch The deep fount of tears. So, I deem that his instinct was true When he turned back to that Which was the one friend that he knew, Were it only a rat. It was something that trusted in him, Something to love, And it shed on his darkness a dim Feeble light from above. A CALM Yesterday the wind blew high, Tore the Minch in tatters small, Drove us back to dripping Skye Wrapped up in a black cloud-pall: And we saw upon the strand, Broken boat and shattered oar, Women wailing on the land, Terror stalking on the shore. Then the fickle waters, spent, Stretched them out and lay supine— Samson resting now, content To have wrecked the Philistine. Rocking now in summer calm, Making not an inch of way, While the air is soft as balm, And the hills in loch and bay Wrap them in a purple haze Whereon the lingering sun doth lean, And the clouds are all ablaze, And the waters catch their sheen, Every rag of canvas spread, With flapping sail and creaking boom, Pennon at the tall mast-head Drooping like a draggled plume, We have rolled here to and fro All the long, hot August day, Till the westering sun is low, Making not an inch of way. Beyond the shadow of the ship Keen-eyed screaming seagulls come, Touch the sea with light wing-tip, And skim away the floating crumb: Guillemots are calling low To their chicks that wander far, And rising, flap their wings to show The two bold swimmers where they are; Hungry cormorants hurry by, Snorts the porpoise here and there, And not a ripple can we spy Stirring to the moving air. Blue the cloudless sky o'erhead, Blue the waveless sea below, Only the tide, low-pulsing, made A lazy rocking to and fro. So basking in the purple light, One said, “Lo! this is heaven, indeed; Yesterday we had the fight, Now we get the rest we need. Happy creatures round us be, Joy is in our hearts and love, Peace is on the earth and sea, Glory in the heaven above.” Gruffly then our skipper: “Stuff! This may be a heaven to you; As for me I've had enough Of those oily waters blue. Here have we been all the day Listening to that creaking spar, While the seagulls fly away, And the dab-chicks wander far. Let me have a good stiff breeze, Hear a rushing at the prow, Now and then be shipping seas, Lurching in the hollow now: Anything—a wind ahead, Racking cloud and driving rain— Sooner than these waters dead, And watching for a breeze in vain. Heaven! there's only one thing worse Than to lie here like a log; That is not to know your course, Sounding in a dismal fog. Vain to keep the helm aport, Vain to spread the topsail high; Better like a porpoise snort, Better be a gull and fly, Better to have flat, webbed feet, Bad to walk, but good to swim, Than be drifting in the heat, Till the gloaming light is dim. He who made the worlds, they say, When His busy work was done, Rested on the Sabbath day, Till its listless hours were run. I've been in the East, and know That is still the bliss they crave, Just to lie, and let the slow Hours go dreaming to the grave. Well; if that was all the heaven The devil had to be happy in, I do not wonder much that even By way of change he took to sin.— There's that creaking boom again! How the lazy shadows float! 'Tis enough to turn one's brain To hear that croaking guillemot! SPRING MORNING In the spring when the cuckoo calls From the shade of the fresh green leaves, And the young lambs leap on the grass, And the swallows are brisk on the eaves, And things with glittering wings Bask in the sunshine it brings; In the morning when glad birds sing, And flowers on their dewdrops close, And the meadow is breathing its sweets Where the bee-loved clover grows, And the gleams and the ripple of streams Are like joys that come to us in dreams; Oh the sweet, bright mornings of spring, With the dew and the song and the flower, And the glad young life of the world, As it laughs in the glory of power, It is good for the spirit as food, The tender green leaf of the wood. Ah! well that the heart, growing cold With the frosts of the wintry years, Can still be made glad as of old, When the spring in its beauty appears, And the light, coming forth in its might, Drives away the sad ghosts of the night. ORWELL I stand on the shore of the lake, Where the small wave ripples and frets; Oh the land has its weeds, and the lake has its reeds, And the heart has its vain regrets. Hark! how the skylarks sing, Far up about God's own feet, And the click of the loom is in each little room, Of the long, bare village street. Yonder the old home stands, With the little grey kirk behind; There are children at play on the sunny brae, And their shouts come down the wind, With the smell of the old sweet flowers We planted there long ago; And the red moss-rose still buds and blows By the door, where it used to grow. All of it still unchanged, Yet all so changed to me; For love then was sweet, and its bliss complete, And there was no cloud to see. But the light is quenched and gone That brightened the place of yore, And all the suns and the shining ones Shall bring back that light nevermore. Ah me! for the shore and the lake Where the small wave ripples and frets! The land has its weeds, and the lake has its reeds, And the heart has its vain regrets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BALLADS FROM SCOTTISH HISTORY INTRODUCTORY What have our men of old times To say for themselves, Now their loves, hates, quarrels, and crimes Have been laid on the shelves, And buried in cobwebs and dust, Or eaten by mildew and rust? Strong men; their passions were strong; And so was their faith, Strong to stand up against wrong, And resist to the death: But fell were some of their deeds In the warfare of clans and of creeds. Oh, theirs was the wrestle for good In the quick womb of Time, Which they only in part understood, But with courage sublime They struggled on towards the light With their hearts still set on the right. Maybe; yet our Jacob was not Without mean crafty ways; And our Esau had glimpses of thought Not unworthy of praise; Not saints all who chose the right path, Nor the others all children of wrath. We shall err from the truth if we keep Just to old Party lines, And stir up old hatreds that sleep In the books of Divines, And rulings of Lawyers, and tales That haunt the dim hills and the dales. And there is not a quarrel so bad But that we may see Some point in it we should be glad Had it got mastery— Some right amid wrong, to explain How true hearts by it might remain. For I think scarce a man can be hot With a fervent goodwill, And cast in his life and his lot With a cause wholly ill; It must have some savour of good To rouse the self-sacrifice mood. Ah, well; there were schemers of course, Heeding not wrong nor right, And captains of foot and of horse Loving only the fight, And waiters-on watching the tide To find out the safe, winning side. Camp-followers these in the war, Eager only for gain, Like the vultures that come from afar To feast on the slain— Or gamblers who played their big game, And were cast forth at length in their shame. But the great groaning multitude, dumb, Had at least a true thought, And looked for God's kingdom to come, And brighten the lot Of the needy and poor and oppressed, And crown their long struggle with rest. And so, through the ages, the throng Of mixed good and ill Confusedly wrestled along, To work out His will, Who aims not to finish the strife, But to open new doors into life. “IT CAME WITH A LASS, AND WILL GANG WITH A LASS” Fy! fy! Oliver fled! Yet he had ten thousand men! All captured now, wounded, or dead, And the foe had not one for his ten! They were gathered from hill and from glen To the muster on Solway shore, And there's grief now on many a Ben, But the shame of it touches me more. My heart within me is bowed By the news of this sorrowful day; Let the women make ready my shroud, It is time I were hasting away. I have often been merry and gay With a lass and a glass and a stave, For I cared but for pleasure and play, And now they have dug me a grave. That dower of Marjorie Bruce— A crown with no head it would fit— On our brows it has ever sat loose, And brought only trouble with it. Yet we lacked not courage or wit, And we loved the old land and its fame, But we heeded not snaffle or bit, When a woman would rule in the game. The gossips now tell me I've got A fine lass-bairn to embrace; Heaven help her! a sorrowful lot She will have, I fear me, to face. For let her have beauty and grace, And a mind that is noble and great, She comes of a tragical race, And she will have a tragical fate. For my Barons are selfish and proud, Taken up with old family feuds; And the Prelates are clamouring loud For the heretics' lives and their goods; And the monks glare out of their hoods At the progress of freedom and light; And the peasantry sullenly broods On their wrongs, and to have them set right. The end of the old world is near, And alas! in the shock of the change, How much will go down that is dear! How much there will be to avenge! Ah, God's work is fearful and strange; Crown and sceptre and temple and tower, And all that man's wit may arrange Goes down when He stirs in His power. But get ready the christening feast, Let the gossips bring candle and cup, And the child have a good time at least, Ere the depths in their terror break up. I will put on the crown when I sup, Though I wear it in shame and in pain, It came with a lass on the crup, With a lass it will leave us again. And send for the man on the Dryfe, That Oliver also may feast. Why not? since he still has his life, 'Tis but honour and valour have ceased, And he'll readily find him a priest Who will heal for a groat his smart, As 'tis only the poor he has fleeced, And broken his old king's heart. It is not the slow touch of Time That has sprinkled my hair so with grey, For I'm all but a man in my prime, But the spring of my life is away. I have come to the end of my day, And seen its last lights where they fall On the clouds, and have only to pray, As I turn a grey face to the wall. GEORGE WISHART They lured him away from my side, The man likest Christ I have known: I felt in my heart that they lied, And vowed he should not go alone. But he waved me aside, saying, “One Is enough for a sacrifice; Your work here is only begun, Wait you till God's time for the price.” Oh, lightly the Cardinal laughed, Having snared his meek victim at length, And gaily the French wines were quaffed That night in his castle of strength; And he sent forth a message straight-way To his brother High-priest in the West, To share in devouring the prey, Which would give to their Babylon rest. The Glasgow Archbishop was vain, And the Cardinal haughty and proud; They had quarrelled, too, once and again, Whose cross should go first through the crowd, And had fought at the altar for place With surplices tattered and torn, And crowns had been cracked, by the mace, Of clerics all shaven and shorn. But Pilate and Herod agreed When they plotted to crucify Christ, And these, too, were one in their deed, When Wishart was sacrificed. Together, with feigning and lies, The saint to the faggots they doomed, Together they feasted their eyes On the flames which the martyr consumed. And so my loved Master and Friend— Meek and brave he, as ever was known— They brought to a sorrowful end, Yet he died like a king on his throne. And I rede you, Lord Cardinal, soon The day of God's vengeance shall come, When the pride that soared high as the moon Shall lie in the dust, and be dumb. I know not the day nor the hour, Nor yet by whose hand 'twill be wrought, But I know that God reigneth in power, And that right shall be done, as it ought. I have faith though His judgments be strange, And at times darkly hid from our sight, That at length, His own saints to avenge, They will break forth as clear as the light. For the spirit that now is abroad 'Mong the nations of Europe is here, And will cast off the horrible load Of priestly oppression and fear: Our land too has come to the birth And the pains of her travail begin, But I trow she has strength to bring forth The life that is stirring within. We have only a young lass to rule Our rude and turbulent folk, Who was trained in a pestilent school, And comes of a light-minded stock. She knows not the land of her sires, And she loves the gay doings of France— Its trinkets and changeful attires, And the viol, the pipe, and the dance. Well, it's only like youth to be gay, And her mirth we might haply forgive, Though I fear me it is not the way To prepare for the life she must live; But they've poisoned her mind against truth, To quench the faint spark of our hope, And the mass-priests have thirled her youth To the service of Rome and the Pope. Small wonder God's people are filled With fears and anxieties, then, When they see all our rulers unskilled In the wise arts of governing men, All selfishly seeking their own, Ambitious of power and of place, And fain, for a bribe, to disown The Word of the Lord and His grace; While the Baal-priests stand at the gate Of the High Kirks, and group in the porch, And mutter their malice and hate, And threaten the faggot and torch; And treason and murder and strife Are hatched by the Cardinal still, As he broods every day of his life How to bend the whole land to his will. Yet dark as the hour now may be, And long as the night still may last, By the Truth we shall yet be made free, And the Truth spreadeth surely and fast. God will not forsake us, or fail When we pass through the fire and the flood; Yea, He will be our buckler and mail When the sword shall be thirsting for blood. There are evil times coming, I know, Confusion and terror and wrath, And the strong man shall then be laid low, And the weak shall be turned from the path; But beyond, I can see a great light, And the land resting peaceful and calm 'Neath the rule of high wisdom and right, With the Kirk praising God in a psalm. I have faith in the Word and the Rock, Our refuge in trouble and care; For the one thing forbidden Christ's flock Is to wring the weak hands of despair. A Chief, in the battle's hot brunt, May fall in the pride of his strength, But another shall step to the front, And march on to triumph at length. And a land, to be famous in story For piety, letters, and truth, Shall arise in her splendour and glory Ever fresh in the dews of her youth; For poverty she shall have wealth, And honours in room of her shame, Her plagues shall give place unto health, And the world shall yet ring with her fame. THE RETURN OF THE QUEEN Saw ye the Queen, Our Queen without peer, With the wind blowing keen, And a fog creeping near, As she came from the land Of the sun and the vine To our mist-shrouded strand, Where the heather and pine Blend their breath with the smell of the salt sea-brine? She passed me close by As she stepped from the ship, With a tear in her eye, And a smile on her lip:— The smile from a glance At the crowd on the shore, But the tear was for France She might see never more, And for friends of her youth, and the blithe days of yore. Her nobles stood round, Each with sword by his side, Every man of them bound At her bidding to ride, And they kissed her fair hand, And they bent low the knee, As gallant a band As you'll any where see, Grave old Lords of State, and youths courtly and free. Lord and Lady had come, Merchant, peasant, and clerk, To welcome her home, And her bearing to mark; Some raised a great shout, Some sang a glad song, Some wandered about, Shaking hands with the throng, And wept as they prayed that her days might be long. She is fair as a rose Full-blossomed in June, And her step as she goes Has the swing of a tune, There's a glint in her eye Hints of good-humoured mirth, And she holds her head high As befits her high birth, Sole heir of a line that held long sway on earth. There is pride in her port, Though so sprightly and young, And the ready retort Will not fail on her tongue, She is learned and fit To make laws for our crimes, Yet may show more of wit Than discretion at times, But her heart it is sweet as the bloom on the limes. She knows her own mind, And will have her own way, Which, if passion should blind, May bring trouble some day; And I thought I could trace The dark shade of a cloud Passing over her face, When the ministers bowed, And read out their well-pondered greetings aloud. Every head was laid bare, Every heart loudly beat, Many kneeling down there, Kissed the ground at her feet, Had she trod on their ranks, As she passed, there had been But a murmur of thanks For the honour, I ween, And a God bless thee, Lady, God save the Queen. France's lilies are fine, Scotland's thistle is rough, Yet her crown it can line With a down soft enough. Truth is better than wit, Love is better than gold, And in these, as is fit, We our Queen will enfold— Ah! we wist not that day what the Future did hold! THE GORDONS AND CORRICHIE The Queen has ridden North: Lord James is at her side, And Knight and Lord, with one accord, Should with her banner ride; Yet scant three hundred men Have answered to her call In fighting gear, with sword and spear, Or arquebuse and ball. 'Twas known that robber bands Beyond the Grampians stood, Who raided cattle, and did stark battle, And shed the lieges' blood; And if the truth be told They laughed at Queen and Crown, And had no awe for Kirk or Law, Stronghold or Borough's town. There was not room in the North For Huntly and also the Queen; The Gordons gay had all the sway, The Sheriff was never seen; With shaveling Priests to sain The clansmen when they fell, They robbed and killed even as they willed, And feared nor death nor hell. She might not leave her folk To be so sore oppressed, Nor yet would she let Huntly be Too utterly distressed; Therefore she ordered so That a small array came forth: Not one in ten of her noblemen Went with her to the North. When Huntly heard the bruit About the Queen's array, He sent to call his kinsmen all To Bog-an-gight straightway, While they might meet secure, And hunt a stag and dine, And counsel hold with the wise and old, And drink a flask of wine. Then trooped to Bog-an-gight The Gordons near and far, From Dee and Spey they took their way, From Buchan and Braemar. Glentanar lads arose, Strathbogie was not slow, And Enzie's carles gave up their quarrels And girt their swords to go. Aboyne from a sick bed rose,— He was aye of a ready mind,— And Haddo sware no Gordon there Should leave him far behind; Ellon and Udny came, And grim old Rothiemay, And Gordon o' Gight, ere morning light, Was up, and horsed and away. Bonnie and broad their lands By Livet and Ythan and Dee, Where Deveron flows, and Lossie goes Past Elgin to the sea; The Bogie drove their mills, The Gadie cooled their heat, In Spean and Spey the Gordons gay Did wash their horses' feet. And now from Peel and Grange, From Clachan and Castle strong, O'er moor and moss, past cairn and cross, They merrily march along. Loose in its scabbard each His sword held ready to draw; Their hearts were light, and their weapons bright, And they laughed at Queen and Law. The Earl was old and fat, And therefore might not brook Graith of steel on head or heel, Or brazen clasp, or hook; But wily and cunning plots Came ready to his brain, For more by wit than by weapons fit His ends he strove to gain. Now, when the feast was ended And all had drunk their fill, The Chiefs still sat, consulting what Might bode them good or ill; What meant the base-born Prior, What Lethington wished to get, What Grange would do if the trumpet blew A note of battle yet. And some said this, and some said that, And hot debate arose, And young heads got with the good wine hot, And well-nigh came to blows. Then the Earl held up a brimming cup, Saying, “Pledge we all our Queen, The fairest face, and the rarest grace, That ever the land hath seen. “She comes not here for judgment, Nor comes she here to fight, But trusts in you whose hearts are true, That you'll maintain her right; Lord Gordon has been wooing, And I think that he has won Her love and faith that until death Shall bind them into one. “As for her bastard brother Who thinks our lands to gain— Moray and Mar both, mine they are, And mine they shall remain. Cleverly she has fooled them Here where our strength doth lie, And six to one we shall set on, And smite them hip and thigh.” Up sprang Adam o' Gordon, A cockerel brisk was he, With a lusty shout his voice rang out, And his sword he brandished free; And up the rest leaped with him, Clashing their blades with might And drank a noggin, and cried the slogan, Keen for the coming fight. I know not if the Gordon Spake sooth about the Queen, For Huntly's Earl a crafty carle From youth to age had been. And royal hearts are deep, And who may search their thoughts? And her way of life amid storm and strife Some cunning may well have taught. They reckoned that the muster Of the Gordon clan would daunt The little band from the Fife lowland, Which was all the Queen could vaunt. But though her force was scanty When she rode off to the North, She well might boast of her gallant host, For they all were men of worth. Lord James could play the man, Though he liked to rule the State, Kirkaldy stood a soldier good, And few with him could mate; And Maitland, deep in thought, could keep A cool head in the fray; They had learned in France to wield the lance, And to order the battle array. To Corrichie marched the Gordons, All ready for the fight, With cords and bands to bind the hands Of captive Lord and Knight— Two thousand plaided men With dirk and sharp claymore, They were ill trained, but they had stained The heather full oft with gore. They came on with a rush And a barbarous slogan cry, And taunting words, and brandished swords, And the pibroch sounding high; The odds indeed were great. But their foes were better drilled, And theirs too was the better cause, And their leaders better skilled. Half-way across the field, When the race had tried their wind, They had to cross a black flow moss Where their ranks were swiftly thinned. The volleys from the muskets They answered still with cheers, But they faltered plain when they reached the main Battle of bristling spears. Lord Huntly was a Chief But hardly a fighting man; It might not be fear, but from the rear He ordered still his clan, Though he saw Lord James in front, And Grange lead on his men, And their serried rank from the solid bank Hurl back his force again. Right soon the play was played, And shouts were changed to shrieks; 'Twas scarce begun ere it was done, Though it had been planned for weeks. Brief was the time of battle, The Coronach needed more. But it will be years ere the woman's tears, Are dry as they were before. Some said Earl Huntly fell— For he was an unwieldy man, And scant o' breath—and was done to death In the back rush of his clan. Some held that he died of shame That his House was brought so low; This only I say that dead he lay With never a wound to show. So the Gordon's might was broken, And it did not fall alone, For never again was a great House fain To wrestle a fall with the throne, As Somerled and Bell-the-Cat Had done in days of old, For the power o' th' Law now held in awe Both chief and baron bold. LADY SEATON'S COMPLAINT Alone here, and in anguish As motherhood draws nigh, I pine and faint and languish While the hours drag slowly by; Yet, My Lord, I'll not upbraid him That he is not here; Mary, Mother, aid him, Holy saints be near. He is not gone a-stalking The red deer on the hill, Nor yet with falcon hawking By marsh or moor or rill, Else I might upbraid him That he is not here; But Mary, Mother, aid him, Holy saints be near. He is not with gay young nobles A-playing at the ball, Nor is he throwing doubles Where dice uncertain fall, Else I would upbraid him That he is not here; But Mary, Mother, aid him, Holy saints be near. When the Council ponders, He comes with words of light; Or when the battle thunders, He strikes for truth and right; So I may not upbraid him That he is not here; Mary, Mother, aid him, Holy saints be near. When his Queen is needing Loyal hearts and true; When the Church lies bleeding, And calls for succour due, There his faith has led him, Though his heart is here; Mary, Mother, aid him, Holy saints be near Yet my heart is longing For his fond caress, Fears and fancies thronging On my loneliness; I will not upbraid him In my hour of pain, But Mary, Mother, aid him, And bring him soon again. IN EDINBURGH CASTLE Where the wall its shadow cast As the sun went redly down, To and fro Grange and Lethington passed, While the light upon Arthur Seat faded fast, And on grey St. Giles's crown. The siege drew nigh its close, For hemmed in on every side, Each new morning of late they rose To a famine of bread, and a feast of blows, And many had pined and died. Grange was a soldier brave, Maitland was crafty and keen; They had tried by their wits to guide the wave, And to ride the tide when the storm did rave, And bring back the captive Queen. Said Maitland, “The end draws near, And they'll strike, and will not spare; When we render the place, if they find us here They will hang us over the battle-ments clear For the corbies to pick us bare. But I mean not to give them the chance: Life is sweet, yet I fear not death If it comes in due course, as the years advance, Or by stroke of a sword, or thrust of a lance, Or a bullet that stops your breath. But the men of the long black robe Have a method from which I shrink— A running noose, and a howling mob, And a fumbling hangman who bungles his job, And I'd rather the old Roman drink. To-morrow the game will be up, On the whole we have not played it ill; But we've lost. And what say you with me to sup This evening, and share in a farewell cup That will settle our share of the bill? The food will be scant, for I think Our rations have come to a close; But we shall not complain of the wine that we drink, For we still have a flask that will bubble and wink, And mock at our well-baffled foes. You will not? you don't mind the rope? Or is it religion restrains? And have we got rid of the old-fashioned Pope, But to cling all the more to the fear and the hope Which were the mainspring of his gains. Ah well! By and by I shall know More than Priest or Presbyter can, Of the place up above, or the place down below, And I'll take all the risk of it rather than show That I cannot face death like a man. Knox prays for you every night, But has never a good word for me; I am doomed, as it seems, to go down to the pit As the one place for which I am thoroughly fit, And where I must evermore be. Yet I fancy that John might have dropt A word for me, just by the way. He must know that when some of you foolishly hoped To blind him, or bribe him, 'twas I alone stopped All efforts at that kind of play. 'Twas insulting him even to think Of winning him o'er to our side, Or getting him even for a moment to wink, When he had, as he always had, some certain blink Of the thing we were striving to hide. He was just the one man in the land We could neither corrupt nor appal, Who clearly saw through all the plots that we planned; And with hardly a trump card once in his hand, He has won the great game from us all. I grant him a head always clear, And a will that no terrors could bend, A heart that felt never a shrinking of fear, And would not be moved by a smile or a tear Of his Queen, or his lovingest friend. And it was not his own ends he sought, I allow him honest and true— A dreamer of course, and a danger, but not To mend his own fortune, or better his lot, As we mostly were minded to do. He is not the manner of man To be tricked or terrified—no! But had you adopted the one certain plan Wise rulers have used since the world began, He would have been dead long ago, And we should have ruled in his stead, And brought back the Queen to her throne, And seen on the Tolbooth the grin of his head Where it stuck on the spike, as I hear that he said He hoped yet to look on my own. But you scrupled to ransom the State By the life he was ready to give, Though your fine gospel rests, and its glory is great, On the fact that a man bowed his head unto Fate That the perishing people might live. So the Queen has been driven from her throne, And the Kirk has been robbed of its lands, And Mitres, Madonnas, and Masses are gone, And Knox, o'er the ruin exalted alone, Plays Pope, and our nobles commands. But I'll none of his orders, nor yet The gallows he means for my throat, So long as I know how to pay the old debt With a fair cup of wine after supper, and get To the end of all uncertain thought. That supper did never take place, For the Castle was rendered that day, And the rebels obtained neither favour nor grace, But were haled to the prison, and looked in the face Of a great howling mob all the way. Only Maitland one morning was found, With a flask near his white finger-tips, Lying low in his cell on the rush-covered ground, With a sweet sickly smell hanging heavily round, And a cynical smile on his lips. “THERE'S A HOLE IN THIS PARLIAMENT” (James vi.) Ill fares the land when favourites rule A king that makes pretence to reign, And power is given to knave or fool Who nothing heed but lust of gain. There is no order in the State, No safety in the common street For brawls and feuds among the great, That rage wherever they chance to meet. Perhaps a Max well bites his nail, And straight a Johnstone's sword is out; Perhaps an angry Scott may rail, And Carrs their slogan then will shout. Let Douglas keep the Cause way crown, And Hamiltons will storm the while; And half the Clans will throng the town To mock the pride of great Argyll. The Grants and Gordons are not slack To dirk each other, when they can; The Chisholm hangs on Lovat's back To prove which is the better man; Lochaber troops out from its glens To bar the Mackintoshs' way; And all the Macs from all the Bens Hunt the M'Gregors of Glenstrae. They brawl even in the Hall of State, And plot and organise deceit, And at the crossways stand in wait For broil and battle in the street; While thieves are raiding on the border, And doing murder in the North, And there's no power of Law or order Beyond the bridge across the Forth. Lo! Arran swaggers 'mong his peers, And lords it like a very king; A man in vice, a boy in years, Who women's hearts is fain to wring. They come by sudden death who chance To stand, apparent, in his way; And yet he gaily leads the dance, A trifler and a popinjay. An evil time of wild unrest, And malice plotting how to kill, And sorrow doth our homes infest, And plague and famine work their will. And hard the lot is of the poor, On every hand by ills beset, With nothing, but their hunger, sure, And nothing growing, but their debt. 'Tis sorry work in growing age To see all love of learning fail, And youth turn from the thoughtful page To stoups of wine and cogs of ale, And lewd-eyed women lead the men, Who lead the nation in its path, And Priests and Masses back again, And all the signs of coming wrath. May God have pity on the land, Give wisdom to the King to rule, Let Law and Justice, hand-in-hand, Put down the oppressor and his tool, Bring back the order of the State, And plenty to the poor man's home, And make the Kirk her pride abate, And let His kingdom truly come. EUPHANE SKENE 1 Between the Houses of Leith and Skene Well-a-day! A deadly feud had for ages been, And their hate was the hate of hell, I ween, Well-a-day! All of the Skenes were of ruthless mood, But the young lord Leith was meek and good. 2 Said her brothers to Euphane fair, Well-a-day! Your speech is like song in the morning air, And your shining eyes, and your golden hair, Well-a-day! Will blind him, and bind him fast, and then Trust us to do what is fit for men. 3 Well their meaning she understood, Well-a-day! And she said in her heart that it was good, For she heired the hate of the ancient feud; Well-a-day! From early youth she had breathed it in, Nor wist that it was a breath of sin. 4 She plied him now with her winsome smile, Well-a-day! With luring word and glance and wile; But she lost her heart to him the while; Well-a-day! And the love was more than the hate had been In the better heart of Euphane Skene. 5 A brief stolen hour in the gloaming dim, Well-a-day! That was all she might give to him, Dreading the wrath of her kinsmen grim, Well-a-day! And every evening she meant to say, I am not worthy, haste thee away. 6 But still as she framed her lips to speak, Well-a-day! Her tongue refused, for her heart was weak; And she said, He is tender and true and meek, Well-a-day! And when he shall hear of my hateful game, He will cast me off like a thing of shame. 7 They fell upon him with sword and dirk, Well-a-day! As he sat with her near to the old grey Kirk Under the boughs of the weeping birk: Well-a-day! He was but one, and they were three, They were her brothers, her lover he. 8 She held him now in a last embrace, Well-a-day! The hot blood spurted in her face, The red blood plashed in their trysting-place, Well-a-day! And fain to stanch the cruel wound, She rent her robes, and the gashes bound. 9 She called to him loud, and she called to him low, Well-a-day! In sweet love-words from the heart that flow, And never before had she kissed him so, Well-a-day! The pale cold moon looked down upon A pale cold face where the life was gone. 10 The pale cold moon that looketh down Well-a-day! On moor and garth, on tower and town, On the peasant's cot and the Prince's crown, Well-a-day! Saw nought that night like the deep despair Of the maiden that clasped her lover there. 11 She did not weep, and she did not moan, Well-a-day! But her eyes were as fire, and her heart as stone, And she took her way to the moors alone, Well-a-day! With an eldritch laugh, and a snatch of song That startled the night as she tript along. 12 Off to the moors with the whaup and fox, Well-a-day! Where the glede has her nest in the ragged rocks, And the raven follows the sickly flocks; Well-a-day! And never again to the Kirk came she, Nor yet where her love-haunts wont to be. 13 Summer and winter, by brooks and springs, Well-a-day! Weird and eerie her songs she sings, Weird and eerie her laughter rings, Well-a-day! And poor folk sain them by the fire, And milk-maids shiver in lonely byre. YOUNG ERSKINE OF DUN The lands of Dun right fair they be, Where Esk runs rippling to the sea Past broomy bank, and daisied lea, And cheerful cottage door. From dark Lochee its water flows By Brechin tower to bright Montrose, And there into the ocean goes, Through the crimp sandy shore. Like it I hoped to make my life Tranquil and free from sturt and strife, And that, in patient labours rife, It should in fruit abound; For I would keep an honoured name From taint of wrong, and shade of blame, And would exalt my grandsire's fame, Who life in learning found. I would not follow trump or drum, Nor handle sword and spear like some, But love of wisdom should become My heart's desire and aim. Let schemers hang about the Court, And soldiers to the wars resort, And idlers take them into sport, And hunt the moors for game; But I would be a scholar true, And ponder till I thoroughly knew Greek sage and tragic poet too, With all their wealth of thought; And go to other lands, and look For manuscript and printed book, Then ponder in the ingle-neuk The treasures I had got. With ample wealth, I did not care To heap up gold, nor yet to wear Fine robes in some high State affair, And ruffle it with Lords. I would be rich in things above The lusts of sense, and I would prove The worth of a more noble love For wise and faithful words. O bright dream of aspiring youth Waiting at learning's gate for truth, And keeping her way rough or smooth, Thy hope has vanished soon. For honoured name and good estate Brought me an heritage of hate, That dooms me to a cruel fate Before my day's full noon. My uncle's envious wrath is fell, My aunts are in a league of hell To cast on me a witch's spell And wind me in my shroud. But for my foster-mother brave, I had ere now been in my grave, And slept beside the breaking wave Among the silent crowd. And now that she is gone, I know They drench me with a poison slow, And life is waxing faint and low, And lo! the end draws nigh. They tell me that they only deal With one who has the art to heal; But every potion makes me feel That I am doomed to die. Better I had been cottar's son Than heir to all the lands of Dun: I had been envied then by none, But had of love my share. O Bell and Annas, could you go, O'er Cairn-a-mount amid the snow, For witch's drugs to work this woe, And shame the name ye bear? Fain would I live a while. But this Slow sinking where no mercy is, And every sign of love I miss, And every touch of grace— Oh rather to be dead indeed, And watch no more the wicked deed, And the hard looks of hate and greed That stare from every face. So death upon him subtly crept, And no one mourned for him or wept, But justice woke up when he slept, And smote though all too late.— Woe's me! that, like a hideous dream, The House that all men did esteem Should perish in a murderous scheme Of dark malignant hate! THE GERMAN SCOTS Mackay of Strathnaver He summoned his clan, And plaided and claymored, They came to a man— Brisk lads of Strathnaver, And gallants of Reay, A thousand brave fellows In tartan array. The Leslies and Gordons, Sent forth, too, their sons, With Munros and Mackenzies And Sinclairs and Gunns; Another good thousand To cross the North Sea, And fight under Mansfield In high Germanie. For ages our Scots lads Had “boun” them to France, And guarded its monarch With good sword and lance; But their hearts now were burning With new faith and hope To match the grim legions That fought for the Pope. Dead was stout Mansfield Before they touched land, But the Dane seized the banner That dropt from his hand: And straight at his summons Mackay led his men, Though at Oldenburg perished At least three in ten. At onslaught and leaguer The Scots bore the brunt, Held the rear in retreating, In battle the front; But the Dane, beat by Tilly, Soon gave up the lead In the conflict of nations, Which fell to the Swede. It fell to Gustavus, King, soldier, and knight, To blend rival peoples, And order the fight; And never was army Inspired as his was With faith in their leader, And faith in their cause. Our Scots bore them bravely In many a fight With the great King Gustavus To witness the sight, At Leipsic, and Nurnberg, 'Gainst Tilly's Walloons, And the big Pappenheimers, And Walstein's dragoons. Oh, never such a captain As ours, led the host, And while he commanded No battle was lost; In raid and in skirmish They still had the best, From triumph to triumph Aye onward they pressed. On the dark day of Lutzen They followed the bier Of the death-stricken victor With many a tear; Yet Lutzen with glory Was filled to the brim, But it seemed a lost battle, Because they lost him. And their hearts raged with fury, Hearing men say That there had been a traitor, And death by foul play, And that one of their number, Who scaithless had been When the battle was ended, No longer was seen. I know not for certain; But this I do find, He who faced the foe always Was wounded behind; And a Gordon had lately Sat long at a feast With a Jesuit cousin, A trafficking Priest. If a Gordon played traitor, And Munro sold his sword, The men of Strathnaver Were true to their word, Ever patient and faithful, They held by the right, And for freedom and justice Maintained a good fight. They failed not brave Banier, They stood fast by Horn, Though stricken and starving And tattered and torn; And they followed Duke Bernard, Staunch ever and keen, Who mocked at the Snow-king, But worshipped his Queen. But it was to Gustavus Their thoughts ever turned, And when they recalled him Their hearts in them burned. As they sat round their watch-fires On cold winter nights, It was good cheer and comfort To talk of his fights. How he ordered the battle, And still led the way, As keen for the tussle, So calm in the fray; How he saw to his soldiers That all had their due, And his little name-children Of all ranks he knew. Well he schooled them, and trained them From childhood for war; But they learned from their Bibles What God's soldiers are, And they learned to love freedom, And yet to obey; And none were more stedfast At Naseby than they. Thinned had their ranks been At Oldenburg Pass, And they perished by hundreds At Lutzen, alas! Yet home with old Leslie, All covered with scars, They came to take part In the Covenant wars. Thrice had the Highlands Recruited their ranks, And twice on the stricken field They received thanks. But barely a three-score Of bent broken men, Ever returned to Strathnaver again. FATHER INNES, S.J. He was a dark, spare, sickly man, And had a rapt look in his eyes, Still young in years, but pale and wan; And well himself he could disguise: A fisher's garb he sometimes wore, As chapman now he bore a pack, A valet next at a great man's door, But ever the Priest was at his back. One day he lay in a cave, perdu— A cave in a waste and wind-swept moor, And heard the cry of the wild curlew, And thought of the ills he did endure, And to himself he muttered low, Impatient of his luckless fate, For he had trysted then to go Where death was coming, and would not wait. Hark! to the shouts of armèd men, And the tramp of horses ridden hard, They search for me o'er hill and glen To earn a vile law's vile reward, While one who has my promise true, And who is needing ghostly aid, May wait until his hour is due, And pass unshriven among the dead. What have I done that I must hide With the wild beasts in dens and caves, Or on some sea-girt isle abide, Where gulls shriek to the breaking waves? My father's home I long to see, But they have lodged a preacher there To catechise the family, And trap the children in their snare. I pass from house to house at night When there is neither moon nor star, That I may reach, ere morning light, Some shelter where the Faithful are; By faintest tracks I cross the moor, Oft blinded by the rain and snow, To creep in by some secret door, And hide me in a chamber low. Perchance it is a baron's hall, Perchance 'tis but a fisher's cot, But mansion big, or hovel small, A hiding-place is all I've got— No home for me, no warm fireside, No haunt of tender love and peace, Where fretting cares are laid aside, And fears of sudden peril cease. Why should I as an outlaw live For doing what the Church enjoins, And giving, as I strive to give, Poor souls the grace that girds their loins? I take my life into my hand— And never would I grudge the price— When offering up by Christ's command The sacramental sacrifice. I take my soul into my hand, At times, when, to avoid pursuit, In some rude ale-house far inland I ruffle it with sot and brute; Or worse, when I perchance must go To kirk, with many sickening qualms, And groan, and wear a look of woe, And hear their sermons and their psalms. I do it not for men's applause Whereon the heart oft vainly leans, I do it for a holy cause That surely sanctifies the means; I do it for the Church's sake, Although I have a sense of sin, Till full confession I can make, And priestly absolution win. Yet wherefore do I now complain In poor self-pity, when I think Of the full cup of shame and pain The heroes of our Order drink, The tortures that do rack their joints, The horrors that they have to see, The aches and grief that God appoints To perfect their great Charity? And oh, when in some house of worth I venture from my hiding-place, And bring the sacred vessels forth, And sain them for the work of grace, And then decore the altar fit, And cense the air with incense faint In castle-chapel, dimly lit, Or crumbling shrine of some old saint; And when they all, with one accord, Before the uplifted Host do kneel, And worship and adore the Lord,— Oh the glad recompense I feel! I know my face then shineth bright, And every pulse beats clear and strong, My darkness then is filled with light And glory and the voice of song. I bring them comfort, dry their tears, Their longing souls I satisfy: What matter then my cares and fears? What matter if I live or die? E'en let the rogues make harsher laws, And hang or drown or burn my youth, A martyr in a holy cause, They shall not overthrow the truth. He knew it not; but close beside A hot recusant darkly lay, Who from the same pursuit did hide, And to the cave had made his way. As lean and pale and frail was he, The same rapt look was in his eyes, He had the same hard weird to dree, But not the same art for disguise. For always he must testify 'Gainst Pope and Prelate, and the Priests That traffic in idolatry, And keep old Pagan fasts and feasts; And hearing what the other spake, He cried in accents loud and clear, “I do arrest thee, Priest, and make Thee captive of my bow and spear.” So there they stood up face to face, And looked into each other's eyes, And both were silent for a space, And touched as with a strange surprise, They were so like, so wan and lean, So hot in theologic strife, So sure of all their thoughts, and keen, And had so frail a hold of life. Then said the Priest, “Go, fool! be still; I've been a soldier in my day, And carry arms, and I will kill The man who would my life betray. Yet care I not my hands to soil With your dull peasant's sluggish blood; Hence to your proper task of toil, And plod among the muck and mud.” The other answered, “Lying Priest, Deceiver of the souls of men, Your time will come, but I, at least, Will leave you in God's hands till then. Far better toil at meanest task Than traffic in deceit like thee, And daily wear a lying mask, And practise plain idolatry.” Then silent both, in scorn or hate, They heard the baffled troopers rage, And marked their hot pursuit abate, Each brooding o'er a well-conned page; One read his book of Hours, and one Through chapters of his Bible ranged, And when the lingering day was done, Their hearts abided still unchanged. And parting sullenly at last, They went their several ways; but yet, When many troubled years had passed, Once more for one brief hour they met: A Priest was carted to his fate, A Whig brought to the gallows high; I doubt if either ceased to hate— I know that neither feared to die. THE MACGREGORS Landless and nameless, By clachan and grange, Among foes that are shameless, And friends that are strange, We skulk, but are tameless, And live for revenge. Here we are Campbells, And there we are Grahames; We join in their rambles, Take part in their games; Till we make their homes shambles And wrap them in flames. Outcasts from Glenfalloch, Glenstrae and Glengyle, Balquidder and Balloch, And Katrine's green isle, Our red deer they gralloch, Our graves they defile. For the hapless MacGregor There is no law nor kirk, But only the trigger, The sword and the dirk, And for a grave-digger The crow in the mirk. All faith and opinion They wholly ignore; Our only dominion The mists of Benmore, Or the crags of Stobinion Where wild the winds roar. Hunted for ever By day and by night Over moor, loch, and river, And bleak mountain height, We empty our quiver Each day in a fight. The grouse on the heather Has its season of rest, And the hare in rough weather By fear is not pressed; But MacGregor has neither Close time, nor safe nest. Estranged and escheated, No birthrights we own, Where our homes were once seated Grass hides the hearthstone, Like brutes we are treated, Like brutes we have grown. They heed no denials Of guilt and bloodshed, Nor wait they for trials, Or proof to be led, To pour out the vials Of wrath on our head. But there's a to-morrow That comes soon or late, When Vengeance shall borrow The semblance of Fate, And they shall have sorrow, And we wreak our hate. And the braes of Balquidder Shall see us again, When the bloom's on the heather, And the sun on the rain, As we bring back together The tale of the slain. THE LITTLE PILGRIMS A TRADITION OF THE PLAGUE IN ABERDEEN Father was killed the year before, When the Gordons raided the town one day, And now we were sitting in grief once more, For the Pest had taken mother away. There were only three of us now alive, Me and Willie and little Kate; Katie was three, and Willie was five, And I was the oldest, nearly eight. None of our neighbours came to see Whether we were alive or dead, The Plague made all of them cowardly, And they passed our door with a look of dread. But we had an aunt in Elgin town, A childless woman, and well to do, Who was fain to have Willie once for her own, To brighten the days that lonely grew. But though we were poor, and it was ill To win bread for us, and keep us trim, Mother still clung to her little Will, And never could bear to part with him. I saw we must go to Auntie, now; But the way was long, and the days were hot, And thieves were on every road, I trow, And the Plague was in every likely spot. Yet go we must, so I went and slid My hand into the crock, where lay A little purse which mother had hid, She told me, against a rainy day. It was not much, but I thought by wit And thrift and carefulness how to spend, If the thieves on the road did not come at it, It would carry us on to our journey's end. Then, having seen to the children's food, I told them we would as pilgrims go, And fare for a while in field and wood Where the little birds sing, and the daisies grow. Merry they were these words to hear, And oh so gaily they questioned me; Would I build them a nest like the dainty birds, And rock them to sleep on a swinging tree? They would hunt the butterflies in the sun, And for the yellow bee's byke would quest, And watch how the rabbits sport and run, And the pewits flutter to hide their nest. It was early morning still when we Left the pest-stricken town behind; Blithe was the blue of the summer sea, And sweet the breath of the morning wind. When we came to the Don, we had to go Along by its side, and across the bridge That spans the black water, deep and slow, With bonnie Balgownie upon the ridge. By this time Katie had weary grown, So I carried her on my back a while, Will at my side came toddling on, And we made in this manner a long Scots mile. Not far from the road, a bourtree grew That would shade us well from the noonday heat, And a wee burn rippled on briskly through The grass, where we bathed our hands and feet. There on our bread and milk we dined, Blithe as the glad birds on the tree, Which picked up the crumbs that we left behind, As we waited a little way off to see. That night, low down among pleasant broom, In a little hollow we snugly lay, It was better far than a small close room, And we slept till long past break of day. Sweet was our bed, and our slumber sweet, And sweet the breath of hay-scented air; So I said to the little ones it was meet That Pilgrims should gather for morning prayer. Mother had done this every day, For she said that it made her heart feel strong To read of the new and living way, And to sing God's praise in a God-given song. Some verses then of the Book we read, And sang together the Shepherd Psalm, And we all knelt down on the grass, and said The children's prayer, and were meek and calm. A short way off I could see a row Of turf-built huts by the roadside plain, And hurried me off with speed to know If milk could be got for the love of gain. But outside the clachan I heard a cow Straining her tether, and whisking her tail, And I said to myself, as I heard her low, She is waiting the maid and the milking pail. Straightway into the byre I ran— I had learnt before with cows to deal— The milk came free, and I filled my can, But I left a coin, for I would not steal. Our fare was good, and we rose to go' Not through the village, but round about Among fields where daisies and butter-cups grow, And we pelted each other with laugh and shout. To the ford of Ythan we came ere night, And close to my bosom wee Katie I drew, Willie held on to my garments tight, And so together we waded through. But into Ellon we might not go, Though the little ones now were weary grown, They drove us away with a threat or a blow, For the dread of the plague was in every town. At a cottage, a good mile off, I spied A woman sad with a kindly face, And “O my bonnie, wee bairn,” she cried, As she lifted up Kate in a fond embrace. My baby was just like her, she said, With the sunny face, and the curly pow, But she lies in the kirkyard cold and dead, And oh, but my heart is empty now. She made us food, and she bade us eat, She cheered our hearts which were sunken low, She gave to us also store of meat, And told us truly the way to go. That night we lay in a warm hay-rick, And slept till the sun was high above, And said our prayer in the morning air With hearts that were full of peace and love. Another day, and another yet Passed as we cheerily fared along, Sometimes racing a little bit, Sometimes singing a little song. That was the last of our happy times, For now to a hamlet I must run, That lay low down among sickly limes, To buy us food, for our bread was done. I left the little ones on a bank With wild thyme and pansies their laps to fill; The air was hot and heavy and dank, Yet it gave me somehow a shivering chill. And when I came to the hamlet, lo! An awful silence held the street, Which smote my heart with a boding of woe; But I said we must have bread to eat. There were no children out at play, No women were sitting on step or stair, Hammer and saw in silence lay, And there rose no smoke in the sultry air. There was no gleam of the red peat fires, No careful mothers had left their bed, The cattle were moaning in the byres, And the rats in the gutters lay dying or dead. Never a dog in the place did bark, Never a caged bird tried to sing, All the windows were blind and dark, And a horror lay brooding on everything. Only a shambling idiot there Along the causeway came stumbling on, And cried with a voice of dull despair, “Dead, dead! all of them dead and gone.” Then I turned in terror, and ran with speed To the bank where I left the bairns at play, For I felt as if death was in every breath, And I must get Katie and Willie away. I told them there was a Dragon there Down in the hamlet among the trees, And his breath had poisoned the wholesome air, And he could devour us all with ease. We must not go near it, for our lives, But hurry away to some happier spot, Where we could break our fast, and make Sport of the Dragon who found us not. We took to a path that crossed a moor, And there for a while we lost our way; But the air on the moor was clear and pure, And we fed on ripe cranberries well that day. At night we lay in a woodland shed Made of pine branches loosely bound; The deer lay near on their bracken bed, And the fox slunk past on his nightly round. I could not sleep, and when morning broke, And the light wind whispered among the trees, And the little ones from their dreams awoke, They were heavy and fractious and ill to please. I told them stories, and laughed and sang, And said in an hour they should eat of the best: And I showed them how lightly the wild deer sprang Up to their feet from their bracken nest. So then they began to leap and run, And toss their heads, as if they too bore Branching horns upon forehead dun, And we took to the weary road once more. Yet did my heaviness still abide All through the hours of that day of pain; I had been so careful their steps to guide Far from the Pest, was it all in vain? Willie grew better, but little Kate Fevered more as the sun rose high, And folk on the road that we, now and then, met Took to the far side, and hurried by. And so our sweet little Katie died That night as the stars came forth once more, Lying low on my lap, she sighed, “I'm coming, mother,” and all was o'er. And weeping low, and wailing loud, We scraped a shallow grave off the way, And there, without coffin or sheet or shroud, Left her alone till the Judgment Day. What followed after I hardly know, It is blurred with sorrow, and all confused; We went on still, but our pace was slow, And sometimes grossly we were abused. One day a sturdy beggar whined For money, he said, to buy him food, Though I noticed, myself, that the rogue had dined Better a deal than ever we could. Therefore I would not give him aught, And he took from his girdle a gully knife, And held its point against Willie's throat, Swearing that straight he would have his life. There was no help near; so I took out my purse, Which he snatched from my hand, and all that I had; It was not much, and that made him curse, And vow that the coins were false and bad. What should we do now, robbed of our all? We could not beg, and we would not steal; We were among strangers, children small, And I hardly could either think or feel. All through the night I lay awake, And tossed on the sun-baked hardened sod; And prayed though it seemed as my heart would break, And I got no farther than just “O God!” But suddenly came this thought to me, Lord, When Thy disciples were walking with Thee Through cornfields, hearkening to Thy word, And they were an-hungered too, as we, They plucked the ears of corn, and ate, And Thou didst never their act forbid; And may not we now, in like sore strait Do as Thy servants that day did? That gave me light then, and as we walked By the great fields of yellow corn, We munched the milky groats, and talked Good words, for it was the Sabbath morn. I thought it right too that we should go With others to worship God, and pray; And it did us good, I am sure, although We mostly slept in the kirk that day. And ere had sunk that Sabbath sun We came to Elgin town at last, And now our pilgrimage was done, And all our troubles were overpast. Auntie, it seemed, was known to all, And they said I could not fail to find Her house where it stood by the Cloister wall, With the great Cathedral just behind. Humbly I knocked at the big oak door, For it was a stately house to see, And I, in my fear, did tremble sore Lest she might be ashamed of me. Not many minutes we had to wait, And when she came to us, all I said Was, “Auntie, this is Willie, and Kate Died on the road, and mother is dead.” Kinder greeting could none have had; Willie she clasped to her bosom, and wept, Partly sorrowful, partly glad, Meanwhile my hand in her own she kept. There was nothing too dainty for us to eat, Nothing too handsome for us to wear, With her own hands she washed our feet, And tenderly combed our matted hair. When I told her the tale of our pilgrimage, And how the thief took our purse away, She uttered some words in a holy rage Mother would never have let me say. Soon our troubles were all forgot, Yet not our sorrows, for when I think Of mother and Katie, my heart is hot, And in the night-watch I have tears to drink. We have all we could wish of meat and drink; But oh for the mother's guiding hand, And the little one's smile, which was like a blink Of sunshine to me in a weary land! JOHN NAPIER OF MERCHISTON Merchiston Tower stands, lone and apart, On the high Borough moor, among elms and limes, And lone and apart were the thoughts of his heart; While the struggle was brewing, in kirk and in mart, To mend the ills of the hapless times. Other his labours, and other his cares, Other the ends that he sought to gain, Other his dreams and his hopes than theirs Who busied themselves with the State's affairs, Or stood up for freedom with hand and brain. By a paper, writ over with ciphering neat, The master sat in loose-flowing robes, Unbonneted head, and slippered feet, Eager to see his long labour complete, In a chamber littered with books and globes. Toil and trouble he never had spared, But year after year had wrought at his theme, Often been baffled, but never despaired, Still had come back, and his errors repaired; And now he was sure that it was not a dream. His task was nigh finished; the end drew near, As page after page he threw down on the floor, A great pile of writing, where truth did appear With every new scroll growing ever more clear, Convincing the reason that doubted before. With forehead deep-furrowed he wrote every word, The strain was so hard, and he toiled till the sweat That beaded his brow trickled down on his beard, And the sound of his heavy, hard breathing was heard Like the panting of athlete that struggles with Fate. Then there came a glad light on his face, and his head Was lifted up grandly and proudly the while, “I have found it, and 'stablished it clearly,” he said, The Law that God wrought by that day when He made The stars in their courses, and measured their mile. Hear what the Kirk says, and you might suppose He has no other thoughts save about His own Name, And the glory, befitting His greatness, which flows From the saving or damning of souls, whom He chose To show forth His grace or His wrath upon them. But many His thoughts are, all old and yet new— Mathematic, mechanic, and chemic—and we, In our brooding and searching to find out the True, Do but glimpse, with long toil, what He perfectly knew From the first, when He held the young world on His knee. Yea, many His thoughts are, and many His cares, Not only for souls, but for dead, silent things, Thoughts of number and form, of circles and squares, Of the grass on the field, and the dews and the airs And the salts that it lives on, and sweets that it brings. And one of His thoughts He has given me to find, Never dreamt of before, and to follow it on To results that enlarge and deliver the mind From bonds that did hitherto fetter and bind The pursuit of light that leads up to His throne. Lo! the fruit of long patience, hard thinking, and pains, And science, by its means, shall range over space, As easy as merchant can reckon his gains Without failure or flaw to bewilder his brains, Or uncertain shadow of doubt on his face. How simple it looks, now the key has been found! How hopeless and dark it looked often to me! God's thoughts are as simple as they are profound, Yet hard as the path over untravelled ground, Till a way has been hewn which the simple can see. Hark! men are fighting where peace should have been, Clashing their sword-blades, and shouting their cries; If they but knew all the triumph serene When a great Law of Nature is certainly seen, And God's secret given to the patient and wise! What are the schemes which their poor lives devour? What are the ends they're so eager to gain? They do but strive to get honour and power, And wield them in pride for a brief little hour— This while the world lasts still shall remain. Truth is the one power to loose or to bind, Not to oppress, but to set the world free, Power over Nature by masterful mind, Power to enlarge the great thoughts of mankind, And by obeying Law its Lords to be. LIVINGSTONE'S WOOING I had gone to a friend for Communion week, And when it was over my soul was sad, For I felt that my heart had been cold and bad For lack of the grace I had failed to seek. The folk did not see it, some even opined That, with the live coal from the altar fired, I had spoken at times like a man inspired, But it was not the fire of a heavenly mind. For now it came home to me, clear as light, I had sought but my own things, not the Lord's; Had tickled men's ears with enticing words That could not have helped any soul in the fight. Then a shadow of trouble came over my face, And I doubted if ever I had a call To the work I once thought that I loved more than all— Proclaiming the riches of God's large grace. My friend to cheer me then, said that he knew My word that day had been greatly blessed, For some had been quickened, and some had found rest, And some had got comfort sure and true. Still the cloud lay on me, and I saw My heart in its faithlessness clearly laid bare, Vain and self-seeking; and dull despair Seemed to be clutching me with its claw. Then said my friend—for he was a friend In good and evil all through my life— “John, what you want is a loving wife To bring these thoughts to a whole-some end: “And there is May Fleming might take you in hand; She is good and true, she is bright and kind, Of a cheerful temper, and pious mind, And she's beautiful too as the Promised land.” I knew of old he was fond of his jest; But surely that was a flippant word To a man who was wrestling for the Lord With the powers of darkness in his breast. Therefore I rose up, and silently Went to my chamber and to my knees, For I knew there was nothing like prayer to ease The load that was lying so heavy on me. But still that speech of his rang in my head; And all through my pleadings and groans and cries May's face rose, smiling, before mine eyes, And I wandered in prayer, and dreamed instead. I never had thought of life yet in that way, But only of making my calling sure, And getting my heart more clean and pure— A task that seemed heavier every day. And I never had thought of May Fleming that way, Though I often had noted her upturned face As she drank in humbly the word of grace, Or folded her little white hands to pray. Yet she had been to me but a lamb of the flock Whom I strove to lead, in the narrow way, To the pastures green that are found alway By the river that flows from the stricken Rock. And a faithless shepherd I needs must be If I led her now to myself, not Him, And kindled a human love, poor and dim, For the love divine I had longed to see. That made me surer than ever before That I was not fit for the Master's work; For my soul was tossed, like a helpless cork, And drifted on to a barren shore. Then I went in grief to my friend, and said, “You have put a temptation in my way; When I turn to my books, or try to pray, May Fleming I cannot get out of my head.” But he only laughed, and answered, “Well, Let her come down from your head to your heart, And make her home there, and never depart; You will preach all the better when you can tell “Of love that unifies man and wife, Love that is faithful, meek, and true, Singing a song that is ever new, Love that is more to you even than life; “For you'll have in your soul the master-key To open treasures of Love divine, And draw for your people the mystic wine That will cheer them, when days of darkness be.” I was not satisfied; yet I know After that I was more at peace; The strife in my soul did partly cease, For the seed he had sown began to grow. Not that I loved her yet as one Should love the maid that shall be his bride; But like my shadow she kept at my side All through the hours, till the day was done. I saw her face as I read my books, Even in the darkness it was there Looking ever so sweet and fair, And I heard her voice in the winds and brooks. What could it all mean? what should I do? I could not study, I scarce could pray, And I felt each Sabbath, my heart to-day Was not in my work, and my people knew. I must give up the task that I did so ill, Must put out the light that would lead astray; For I had no rest by night or day, But went on dreaming about her still. Once my thoughts had been all of Him Who bore the cross for His chosen folk; But now to the sorrowful truth I woke That the faith I once lived by had all grown dim. But one day I met her on the high road, All by herself, and stepping free; My text for next Sabbath was working in me, And I felt it then as a heavy load. I told her my trouble, and she threw out Modestly only a hint, a thought, But it suggested much, and brought Clearness to me instead of doubt. Surely that impulse God had given, Which made me disburden my mind to one So able to make the dry well run, Free and full, with the grace of Heaven. That sermon was something fresh and new, And shone with a light I had never before, I seemed to get to the very core, And searched the mystery through and through. Therefore I went to her mother, and told What May had done for my work that day, And the hope it begot in me, that they Would not reckon my love to be over-bold. It was not marriage-love yet, nor did I get that till days and weeks were passed, And only by prayer it came at last, But it burned like a fire then, and would not be hid. I had much ado to moderate it, To keep it from taking the Master's place, With the light of her love for the light of His face, Though I tried to keep it in measure fit. And of all God's gifts to me, truly the best, Save only the Spirit of grace and truth, Was the wife that he gave to my troubled youth, And the home that she made me of peace and rest. WARRISTON AND THE SIGNING OF THE COVENANT Enough for me to have lived to see This glorious day, and its godly work, When our nobles have buried their ancient feuds, And our merchants have left their gains and goods To sign our bond in the Greyfriars' Kirk. Truly my heart leaped up in me, while Douglas and Hamilton, Athole and Mar, Pressed on the heels of Montrose and Argyll, And Lindsay and Lauderdale walked down the aisle With Kennedy, Cunningham, Scott, and Carr. Of all our Houses of ancient fame Only the Gordons held them back; Hume and Maxwell and Elliot came, And Stewart and Bruce would have deemed it shame If men of the Royal blood were slack. Few of the Chiefs of the clans were there; Clanronald, Macdonald, the Chisholm, Locheil, All lay close 'mong their mountains bare; But they count not for much in a State affair, Unless there be cattle to raid and steal. Mackintosh sat by the fire and drank, Cluny was busy about his game, Seaforth was playing the Lewsmen a prank, And all of them truly were papists rank, While hardly one could have signed his name. We looked not for them, and little was lost That they were not there, for they always bring Quarrels with them as they brag and boast, And dirks too are drawn, and swords are crossed, And tongues that babbled begin to sting. There was not room in the kirk for more Than a tithe of those who were fain to write; So they spread the sheets on the gravestones hoar, All the way out to the kirkyard door, And many who signed there wept outright. Oh what a sight it was, all the land, Gentle and simple, humble and high, Setting their seal to our Covenant band, That vowed the people, with heart and hand, To stand by the Cause and the Kirk, or die. I pricked my finger, and dipped the pen In a drop of my own heart's blood to write: It was but a drop, but it pledged me then That every drop in each throbbing vein Should freely be given to win the fight. Of course, I know there were not a few Who felt no glow of our patriot fire, Who cared not for freedom or truth or right, But loved the darkness, and shunned the light, For the lust of gain was their one desire. Stoutly they clave, like the maw of the grave, To the wealth of the Monks, and the Bishop's lands, And all the pillage that did avenge The ills of the past with ills as strange, When they plundered the Kirk as they broke her bands. All they heeded was wealth of gain, All they dreaded was loss of gear; But their swords are good if their hearts are vain, And we'll need them all in the stress and strain That will try our mettle this coming year. God grant that they may stand fast that day; But some are ambitious, and some are proud, And some are fain just to get their own way; And there may be a Judas. Who can say What kind of folk may be hid in a crowd? Is it right to join hands with them, in view Of their alien mind. Were not Gideon's band, The gallant three hundred, staunch and true, Better by far than a motley crew Who care for nought but the teind and land? Some of God's servants will have it so, For they say He can save by many or few, And they blame me as one who is fain to go, By worldly policy. Yet I know We shall need every man to carry it through. But the people are stirred, for they all have heard Of the quarrel 'twixt King and Parliament, And their hearts are hot, and they will not yield To Charles or Laud, till, on stricken field, One side or other its force has spent. I am no soldier, and I shrink From battle and blood as things abhorred; Yet now that we stand on the deadly brink, No more may I counsel peace, but think Of the Kirk and its only King and Lord. Where the Spirit of God is, men are free; Where the spirit of truth is, men are strong; And strong and free shall our country be When the storm is past, which we plainly see, Laden with thunder, now trooping along. GASK AND MONTROSE I was with the great Montrose All through his grand campaigns, When he swept o'er the hills and the snows, With the wild curlews and the crows, And the winds and the clouds and the rains. Was never a leader like him To know what his lads could do; There were rivers and lakes to swim, And moors where the mists lay dim, But he burst on the foe ere they knew. We were neighbours of old in Strathearn, And I joined him before Tippermuir, Marched close by his side up to Nairn, And fought by his side at Auldearn, Where the Whigs of our ruin made sure. And oh how we raided Argyll, Till the Campbells had hardly a roof Or shieling, for mile after mile, And we drove off their cattle the while, And left scarce a horn or a hoof. They'll not soon forget how our men Then harried their clachans and byres; There was wailing in every green glen, And burning on every high Ben, But laughter at our watchfires. When we marched through a blinding snowstorm To Inverlochy, Argyll Lay down on his ship, like a worm, But our gallant young leader's brave form Ever marched in our front with a smile. As they spied us, they faced right about, But our claymores were thirsting for blood, And we rushed on their ranks with a shout, And broke them in stark, utter rout, And drank the red stream like a flood. We spoiled the fat burghers of Perth, And if checked just for once at Dundee, At Kilsyth their dead covered the earth, Like swathes, when the reapers with mirth Lay the ripe corn low on the lea. Oh the spoil that we gathered that day When our banner waved o'er Aberdeen! Though our forces then melted away, As they started for home with their prey, And our musters next morning were lean. That was the worst of the job; War with them was a foray for gain, The foe was scarce more than a mob, Whom they hasted to kill and to rob, And be off with their plunder again. I was young, and I did not much care, So long as the sword did not sleep, Though they trooped off with all kinds of ware, Pots and pans and cloth-webs, like a fair, And droves of fat cattle and sheep. The Highlands were swarming with men, All idle, and keen for a fight, And for one that dropt off there were ten To fill up our thinning ranks, when The Whigs once again were in sight. Yet doubtless our leader must feel, When his army was melting away; It was hard to know how best to deal With fellows more eager to steal Than to stand by the flag and obey. But I had not the care of command, All I wanted was just a good fight, And of course to bring back to the land The rule of the king, and to stand By the Church and Episcopal right. I was never so cheerful and gay, Though some of my comrades had dropt, For I thought we had played out the play, And the Whigamores, losing the day, Their wicked devices had stopped. So one night, the moon shining clear On the Tweed, where I stood with Montrose, I said, “What a glorious year! We have scattered the rogues far and near, And we'll have back the king, ere he knows. “In the land of his fathers, at least, He shall have his own once more In spite of the Presbyter Priest, And the new-fangled Puritan yeast That swells in their hearts at the core.” But he looked very sad, and he sighed, “We have poured out rivers of blood, And beaten them—yes,” he replied, “But we've not gained a man to our side; 'Tis like thrashing the tide at its flood. “We have swept o'er the land, and the shock Has filled them with fear and unrest; No longer they flout us and mock, Yet I know that the bulk of the folk Hate the sight of a kilt like the pest. “For the king our lads care not a jot; Their king is the chief of the clan; Not once for the Cause have they fought, But only to better their lot, Or avenge an old feud when they can. “No more for the Church do they heed, For order or worship or rite; Perhaps for the Pope and his creed They might take to the sword, but they need No faith as a plea for a fight. “I am weary of half-savage men Who seek but some gain to the tribes; And the Whigs have been beaten in vain, Ere long they will bind us again By the parchments and quirks of their scribes. “And I'm weary of these civil wars, And the desolate homes they have made, And the wide waste fields, and the scars That are aching under the stars, And the widows bewailing their dead. “After all men have said, too, and sung, Civil war brings its bitter remorse, When you hear your own dear mother-tongue Appealing for mercy among The hoofs of your iron-shod horse.” And that was the man, who, they said, Cared only for battle and strife, And to look on the dying and dead, And who reckoned the blood he had shed The glory and joy of his life. THE SECTARY Corporal Hogswash of Grimsby, One of “The Brazen wall,” Could fight and exhort, Réposte and retort With the Word, or the sword, or a ball; He was equally handy with all. He was fain to lord it supreme O'er the weavers and cottars of Fife, As he led on his troop, With a halloo and whoop, Ever foremost in fray and in strife, And kept folk in fear of their life. One day, in the kirk, he sat down On the stool of repentance, for choice, With a laugh and a wink— Sign of shrewd morning drink— And his soul it did greatly rejoice, In this manner, to lift up his voice. He called himself “Seeker” or “Waiter,” Though he ne'er stayed to listen or learn; And loudly he swore At the open kirk-door That sinners should now have their turn, Whose hearts in them hotly did burn. “Lo! you now, up there in the box, Sir Presbyter Priest,” he began, “We poor sinful folk, The black sheep of the flock, Will hear your rebuke, as we can, If you will but hit fair, like a man. “I am ready our sins to confess, Mostly sins of the flesh, I admit; We are given to strong liquors In flagons or beakers, And to handsome young maids that are fit On the knee of a soldier to sit. “That's the worst can be said about us, And for that you have set up this stool, And ring your cracked bell, And stand there and tell Of your Kirk, and its good godly rule, And Tophet ordained for the fool. “Now, spare not; his seat likes me well; But when you have spoken your word, I have somewhat to say, In my own homely way, To you who are serving the Lord With your sins, which He ever abhorred. “Oh, you're silent, are you, to-day? You leave all the talking to me: Very well, I am ready; You just stand up there steady, My dear, erring brother, and see What other folk know you to be. “What of your envy and pride, Hypocrisy, lies, and deceit, Your high Sabbath-keeping, With the shepherds all sleeping, And the wolf at the door, and the feet That are swift to shed blood in the street? “Lo! the violence, strife, and Contention; (See Habakkuk, 1st and 3rd), Your nest may be high, But the stone shall cry From the wall, and its voice shall be heard, Like the hoot of an ill-omened bird. “I sit on the Penitent's stool, Where many poor souls have been shamed With heads bowed like willows For small peccadilloes; Meanwhile your worse vices, untamed, Have thriven unrebuked and unblamed. “Yea, I sit on the Penitent's stool, Though 'tis fitter for you than for me; Go build up a creed, Not of word, but of deed, And meanwhile come down here, and be Rebuked by the sinful and free. “We have broken the yoke of the King, We have cast off the bonds of the Pope, And we will not submit To the rein and the bit Of the Presbyter Priestlings, that hope With Noll and his army to cope. “For the work we have done God has sealed With victory everywhere In great feats of war; As late at Dunbar, So at Worcester His arm was laid bare, In the great crowning mercy wrought there. “And we're free from the bondage of Law, For the Spirit has made us free; The Command is not meant For the latter-day saint, But for those who will still bend the knee Where the Priest and the steeplehouse be.” Then he strode up the high pulpit stair, While the minister said with a groan, “Ho! my people depart With God's peace in your heart; For bread he will give you a stone, Let him do his blaspheming alone.” The flock with mixed feelings were stirred, Some groaned, and some laughed, and some wept, Some loudly shouted, Some mocked and flouted, But the more part silence kept, And sorrowful homeward crept. The Corporal preached for an hour About Oliver's power and trust, About vials and trumps, And Parliament rumps, And the sword of the Lord, and its rust, Till his throat was as dry as March dust. BURLEIGH ON MAGUS MOOR The turncoat! the traitor! We sent him to London to plead our cause, And our Covenant band with the Allcreator, And the rights that are ours by our ancient laws, And lo! he comes back with a mitred head, False to all he had sworn and said. My Lord, the Archbishop! That's how they usher his Grace now in, For our clerical cooks are fain to dish up The Pope's old orders of pride and sin. No doubt, he will be Cardinal soon— Cardinal Judas! the crafty loon! Oh, he was to have brought us Times of peace from a gracious King; Only trust him, so he besought us, And we should have grateful songs to sing For a quiet land, and a faithful Kirk Cheerfully doing its Master's work. But our troubles and sorrows Are harder than ever they were before, And dark as to-day's are, darker to-morrow's, With lies in the air, and spies at the door; For the boot and the thumbkin and the rack Are all that his graceless Grace brought back. It is fine and prison If we meet on a moor to hear the truth, Braving the blasts of a stormy season Rather than prophets that prophesy smooth; And it is a gibbet, if we withstand A cornet of horse and his swearing band. We have loved freedom, And for its sake have fought and bled, Faced proud armies, and did not heed them, Holding our own among dying and dead; And now shall we tamely cower before Lawyers and Priests that scourge us sore? List! Rathillet, Hear you his Lordship's six-horsed coach Bearing him on to his well-earned billet, With an out-runner heralding his approach— Strange are the ways of heaven and grim, For we did not come here to ambush him. It was for another We waited, one of his hateful tools, Who tries all the arts of hell to smother The truth in Fife, where he sits and rules With the boot for our bones, and a rope for our breath, In the name of this high Arch-priest of death. The Lord hath delivered The traitor into our hand this day, And he who is slack at the work hath severed Himself from the cause, for which good men pray— You've a private quarrel, Rathillet, I know, But you'll stand by our deed, though you deal not a blow. So we grouped on the moorland, Pledged and sworn to the fell, stern deed, And smote the old man with a swift and sure hand, And saw the gashed wounds on him gape and bleed— 'Twas a public work, and every one there Had to thrust in his weapon, and take his share. ERICSTANE BRAE We had gathered that night for prayer On the hill above Clyde-burn head, When a whisper went round, as we came to the ground, That our Leader and Preacher was dead. The troopers had come on his track As he sped down the bank of the Daur; They were seen to follow, with whoop and halloo, While he made for the Buckshead scaur. Shots had soon after been heard, And blood had been certainly spilt; So we reckoned it plain that he had been slain, And we doubted not whose was the guilt. Sad, then, and stricken at heart, We were turning to hasten away, When some one said, “If our leader is dead, We have all the more need to pray.” Unbonneted all of us stood, Till we heard a whaup's shrill cry;— We had posted men at the foot of the glen To warn us if danger were nigh; And that was the signal agreed, Which we heard now at Clyde-burn head, And we held our breath, and were still as death, Where we stood on the high watershed. We could hear the beat of our hearts, But by and by came a cheer, And out of the mist a form uprist, And our pastor himself drew near. The gloaming had gathered grey, And the light was fading fast, So we did not see, at first, how he Had changed since we saw him last. For he had been a stalwart man, Big both in body and limb, And his simple dress, in its homeliness, Had always been neat and trim. Now broken he was and bent, And his face was pale as death, He was soiled with mud, and stained with blood, And he gasped at each painful breath, As he wearily dragged his feet To the great grey stone on the hill, Where he often had stood to do us good, And to strengthen our heart and will. There for a moment he paused, Girding himself to speak, And the hearts of the crowd were wholly bowed To see the strong man so weak. “My hours are numbered,” he said, “But I hasted to send you home, For they knew that to-night we should meet on the height Where the Clyde-burn frets in foam. “Earlshall and his hard-riding troop Saw me come down by the Daur, And followed me close, o'er moor and moss, And on by the Buckshead scaur. “They caught me at Elvan foot, And horsed me there, hard and tight; Without saddle or bridle I rode in the middle, With a trooper to left and right. “Then they had a great drink at the inn, Where a lad somewhat loosened my feet; The ale had been strong, and with jest and song They carelessly rode in the heat. “The day was muggy and warm, And their brains were sodden with drink, At Ericstane Brae they were no more gay, But the wakefulest 'gan to wink. “There I got my feet free of the rope, Where the gully is sudden and deep; It was half-full of mist, as I surely wist, And its bank is stony and steep. “I thought I had gotten my chance, And slipt from the back of my steed, Crept under the man to my left, and ran Right down the rough bank in hot speed. “I heard them shout and swear, For none of them minced their words; With a sudden bound some leapt to the ground, And hurriedly drew their swords. “But some their carbines fired, And one of them reached the mark, Yet I ran on fast, till I got at last Down into the mist and the dark, “And reached the Annan, but faint With loss of blood and strength From a wound that, I feel, will never heal, For my hour is come at length. “But I could not rest, until I had brought a warning to you; So I crawled up the hill, and crept on still, Though weary and weak I grew. “Now haste you, every one, home, For I think they will soon be here; And leave me alone by the big grey stone Where I've preached to you often in fear. “God's will be done; I had hoped To lead you in prayer this night, But there's One who will pray for you night and day To keep you true to the right. “I leave you now in His hand, Who never will leave His own; Hold fast to the faith, and fear not death, But think of the great white Throne. “Away! every man to his home, Let your sorrow for me now cease; Alone with God, on this bit of green sod, I shall yield my soul in peace.” That was the last word he spake, Straightway he fell down dead, As we heard the beat of the horses' feet, And silently scattered and fled. LADY DIANA Well, yes, I was fond of him once I admit; He was gallant, and courtly, and handsome, and big, Had plenty of means, and was not without wit, Till he took to mad ways, and became a rank Whig. We were neighbours—my father and he—on the Ken, And our forebears had hunted together, and fought, Had always been staunch friends, and right-hearted men, Who stood by the Church and the King, as they ought. They had backed up the Queen in her quarrel with Knox, Had trampled the Covenant down in the mire, Had followed Montrose o'er the Bens and the rocks, And swore to King Charles, as they did to his sire. There was not a strain of the Whig in them all, Their blood was untainted, their hearts were all true; Horse and rider were ready to answer the call When the King wanted friends and had fighting to do. But he took to hill-preachers, and sat on the moss When a Peden, Cargill, or a Cameron spoke Of Christ's crown and kingdom and bearing a cross, Though it was plain rebellion they tried to evoke. He was warned by his friends, but he would not take heed, He was fined o'er and o'er, but that troubled him not; Not a man to be swayed, he, by fear or by greed, He would stand, as he said, by the thing that he thought. Now, a girl might well fancy a man such as that, Might deem him a hero, or hold him a saint— A kind of small god, to be just wondered at, And loved with a love which had no earthly taint. I can scarce now believe I was e'er such a fool, And I dare say my friends would to laughter be moved At the thought that I ever could whimper and pule For a psalm-singing Puritan rogue that I loved. But I was in my teens, and I worshipped him then, Though I wished that he were not a Whig, as they said; For we were of the Old Church that bred saintly men, And oft for its faith, too, our blood had been shed. Of course, I stood by him, the more they opposed, And the worse they spake of him, the better I thought; I was not to be crushed, nor my mouth to be closed, But all the day long for his honour I fought. My father was wroth that I stuck so to him, My mother was worse, and kept nagging me still, My brothers looked at me with countenance grim, Till I swore I'd turn Whig too, and take to the hill. They were at their wits' end, for the house had no rest; I held my own well, though at times I would gasp, When my temper grew hot at some ill-mannered jest, For I had a sharp tongue, and it stung like a wasp. Then they sent me away to a Convent in France: It was not a strict one; the Mother was gay, And the Father Confessor was fond of a dance, And we learnt to make love, like the girls in a play. Our morals were nowise improved, I allow, But then our religion was strict and severe; We were taught when to kneel, and to cross, and to bow, And we went to Confession six times in the year. We counted our beads, and our Aves we said, But meanwhile our thoughts were about the next ball; We chaunted our Psalms were we lay down in bed To watch our fine gallants come over the wall. What would you? Young blood will not always run slow, Young minds will rebel against dull, pious looks, Young fingers will tire making laceflowers to grow, And oh, how we hated the Nun's dismal looks. They were wise, then, to send me away, for ere long I got rid of heroics about wrong and right, And took to the dance and the lute and the song, And thoughts that were cheerful, and ways that were light; And came back a woman; and woman is not Like a girl in her teens that goes mooning about; I knew the world now, with its cynical thought, And I looked at its facts, and left sentiment out. I said to myself: “I have had my love-fit, And found it a day-dream, a fastfading flower, A cloud which the sun for a moment hath lit With glories, that end in a dull, drenching shower. “One must think of position and jewels and dress, And comforts and pleasures, in choosing a mate; And what can one look for but times of distress, If her man is a fool, and will fight with the State?” I knew what it was to be poor, and to pinch And scrape just to keep things a-going, for we, Though our acres were many, had hardly an inch Of land that paid rent from the Ken to the Cree— All moorland, the haunt of the whaup and the grouse And the falcon and fox—but our salmon was good— And we had to keep up a great ark of a house, Filled with idle retainers who clamoured for food. He was richer than we, for his farms were well tilled, His tenants all thrifty, his rents duly paid; They were psalm-singing rogues, but yet steady, and skilled To make of the land all that well could be made. But a Whig he must be, with a conscience forsooth! Must go to hill-preachings the Law had forbid, And must have a room where “The Witness for Truth,” Whom the troopers were seeking, might safely be hid. It is true that we, too, had a chamber concealed, Where the Priest lay, perdu, when fanatics held sway, But it's one thing to preach to rude clowns in a field, And another for lords at God's altar to pray. I gave him my mind when I met him one day, And he spake of old times; but the old times were dead; He was still as he had been, and went the old way, But for me I had quite other thoughts in my head. I was sorry, of course, but the truth must be told: His Kirk was a schism, his faith was not mine, And I could not approve of his purpose to hold The Law in contempt, and the King's right divine. So we parted; on my part, with something of scorn For a man who could wantonly shipwreck his life For a cause that was lost, and a Kirk that was torn In pieces by jealousy, envy, and strife. So the Sheriff, of course, had his duty to do; They must pay for their preaching, and they found it dear, When the troopers were quartered upon them, and slew Their kine and their sheep, and ate up half their gear. They rose in rebellion, but speedily found That claver'se made short work of them and their pikes; I am told they fought well, but were borne to the ground By our fellows who rode straight o'er hedges and dykes. That's what he brought on himself by his pride, And he brought it no less too on most of his folk, Who were soon hunted out of the glens where they hide, And who lie now securely in fetter and lock. 'Tis a pity, no doubt, that so many were killed, For they were our best farmers and workers all round; When you came on a trim house, and fields nicely tilled, You might know that a Whig held a lease of the ground. Our fellows are nearly all roystering loons, Who take to the ale-cup more than the plough, Carousing each night, singing Cavalier tunes, Which they shout, till the birds wake upon the green bough. The Whigs have their psalms and their sermons, but then They are up with the sun for the tasks they must do; They are all canting rogues, but I wish our brave men Were as fond of their work, and as honest and true. There's a batch of them waiting in gaol to be sold To the Colony planters, all healthy and strong, And worth a round sum to be paid there in gold, Though here they are bargained for just an old song. I am told they will bring twenty guineas a head Over there, and probably some of them more, So I got at the Lady old Lauderdale wed, And she gave me a grant of at least half a score. Perhaps he is one of them? Be it so. He Will be sold anyhow when the ship comes to port; And why should not some of the price fall to me, As well as to fine Lords and Ladies at Court? There's Queensferry in for a slice of his land, And Lagg will not rest till he shares with Dundee What is over, unless Earlshall get his hand On the fields which march nicely with his on the Cree. They take what they can, as my father does too, And I'm poorer than they are, and needing it more: My debts at the Tables are more than I knew, And duns come and hammer each day at the door. This grant will be worth a two hundred, at least, And will quiet their angry demands for a space; And perhaps I may spare a small sum for the Priest, To absolve from the sin, if sin be in the case. But there is not. I liked him, and so did they all, But that does not hinder them doing their most To get at the wreck, and to profit withal When the ship of a fool has gone down, and been lost. I am doing quite right, then. And speaking of that, Were it right to give up all this money to pay Old debts, when I'm needing new frocks and a hat, For it shamed me last night to be seen at the play? My debts they can wait. I've a good mind to go Up to London a while, and look in at the Mall, And see the Court beauties and gallants, although Where the beauty is found 'tis not easy to tell. One must hope our good King has some politic wits, But his taste in women astonishes me; That Churchill might well give his Majesty fits, Were it not that the others are worse even than she. GRIZEL BAILLIE It was in “the Killing Times,” when consciences were crimes, And over all the Merse were scattered troops of wild dragoons Swaggering in the streets and squares, saucy, daring “deil-ma-cares,” All in bravery of scarlet, and brawny handsome loons. For Claver'se and Dalzell had trained the rascals well For the pillage and the carnage, they set them now to do; They haunted all our shores, and spied about our doors, Watching keenly for our father, but we watched them keenly too. Just then the rage was hot about the Ryehouse Plot, Wherein he had no part, for all such doings he abhorred; There were ten of us to feed, and his heart had daily need Both of courage and of caution, and he trusted in the Lord, And never went astray from the strait and narrow way Of truth and right and duty, which his Master trod before; He was staunch against oppression, and his heart bled for the nation, But he waited for salvation, till God opened wide the door. But guiltless though he was, they knew he loved the cause Of the wronged and ruined people, and the Kirk he held so dear; And his innocence had failed, when such lawlessness prevailed, To protect the friend of Baillie from their fury and their fear. He must take to hiding, then, where the prying eyes of men Might not find him, till the trouble and the terror overpassed; And the only likely place was a gruesome one to face Where he laid his honoured father, when its door was opened last. Polwarth tomb beside the Kirk, it is eerie, cold, and mirk, With a mere slit in the wall for light and air to enter in; And scant the light and air ever came unto him there, As he lay repeating Psalms, and praying to be kept from sin. I often thank the Lord for His good and holy Word, And also George Buchanan for his craft in Latin verse; Father could not have got through the waste and weary time he knew, But for humming the old Psalms he learnt in schooldays to rehearse. That kept his heart up well, as the glimmering sunlight fell On the coffins heaped up grimly against the clammy wall, While he breathed the sickly breath of old decay and death, For the long line of his ancestry had there been buried all. Mother and I alone were aware where he had gone, My brothers were too young to be told a secret yet; And each night, when they slept, forth into the dark I crept Under the twinkling stars, when the sun had wholly set. At meal-times it was good just to watch our mother's mood And the fun she made till every one must turn to her his head, While I swept into my lap dainty bit and wholesome scrap, Which they thought that I had eaten, and called me “greedy gled.” For the children must not know, nor the servants, where I go Or what it was I took with me when I stole out at night; But father must have meat in his hiding-place to eat, And when I got my basket filled my heart was very light. I had always been afraid in the darkness, when I made My way along the footpath beside the kirkyard wall; I knew that ghosts were nought, yet my heart came to my throat, If a rabbit scurried past me, or I heard an owlet call. But now I stumbled on over mound and grey headstone, As the dogs barked in the manse, when they heard my stealthy feet, And I heeded not the dead, not a ghost was in my head, But I only thought how soon he should have bread enough to eat. I found him always gay, ready still to jest and play; How he laughed out when I said the children called me “greedy gled!” And first I had to tell him if all at home were well, And then he thanked the Lord, and bared and bowed his honoured head. He was pious, cheerful, wise, and my happiest memories Are the hours that I passed with him in the tomb by Polwarth Kirk; Though his wrath would burn and blaze, as I spake of our evil days When there was no law in the land, but the rule of sword and dirk. We were feeling quite secure that our secret would endure Any search they would be like to make among the kirkyard stones, Though at times they might have heard, now and then, a Latin word, Or even a peal of laughter from the house of dry old bones. But it chanced upon a night, when the moon was shining bright, That the parson in the manse beheld me through the kirkyard go; He was but a craven loon, and the glamour of the moon Made him take me for a phantom that was gliding to and fro. Next day he took to bed, and the tidings quickly spread Through the parish, that he had been driven into fainting fits By a vision he had seen, flitting where the graves were green, And filling him with terror till it shattered all his wits. Some laughed, and others hinted it was drink that had demented The creature, who was known to be a spy upon his flock; There were some, both young and old, who were lying then in hold On the curate's information to the military folk. But there were some troopers swore that they feared a ghost no more Than a Whig, and they would watch the kirkyard willingly all night; Give them but some cups of wine, and they would make wassail fine, Though the Devil and all his angels came from hell to do them spite. What could we do to save our loved one good and brave, Now that in his father's grave he could no longer hope to hide? They were reckless and profane, those dragoons, and it was plain They might keep their watch on nightly, till he pined away and died. I was fain to play the ghost with them, and take, at any cost, The food that he would need upon a cold and wintry night; For wrapt up in a sheet, and coming up with silent feet, I felt sure that sudden terror would seize on them at the sight. I had no fear at all, for I knew the kirkyard wall, And could jump it, and take shelter where they should not find me then; But though father was so dear, mother would not even hear Of my running any risks among those wild and godless men. She had thought out in her mind another way by which to blind The foes if they suspected that he still was near at hand, And she liked it all the rather that she thus could cheer our father With the voices of the children, and the comforts she had planned. There was one whom we could trust, as clearly now we must, And we took him into counsel, and began our task straightway: In a room on the ground floor there was a bed and little more, And we hoped to hide him there, until he might get safe away. Then we dug beneath the bed a hole to hide his honoured head, Scraped the earth out with our fingers, till the nails were worn away, And bore it in a sheet outside, until we did complete The work we had in hand before the weary close of day. Mother looked bright and brave, but I said 'twas like his grave, And the box the man had made for it was like his coffin too: But with holes in it for air, and a little room to spare, And a mattress for his comfort, she thought that it might do. The night was dark and wet, and before the watch was set, I brought him safely home from his gruesome hiding-place; And oh but she was glad, who had been of late so sad, As she fell upon his bosom, and looked up into his face. Then she'd make him a gay feast, and his wine should be increased From a flask up to a flagon, and they two should dine alone, As on their wedding day, when he bore his bride away, A prouder, happier man than the king upon his throne. Meanwhile the rain fell fast, and beneath the howling blast Doors banged and windows rattled, and the old house seemed to rock; But though the night was eerie, their hearts were very cheery, And they only said the storm was hard on poor and homeless folk. At length she rose to show his hiding-place below The great bed by the wall, where none would surely seek for him; But the box it was afloat, and leading like a boat Which had gazened in the sunshine, till it scarce was fit to swim. He smiled at our pet scheme, which had proved an idle dream, But mother was so vexed, he would not tease her with a jest, But gently stroked her hair, and bade her not despair; That the rain should flood the old house no mortal could have guessed. “Well, to-morrow's Wooler Fair,” he said, “and we should have horses there If we would not lose the market. Let the man set forth to-night, And let him take the highway, while I will take the byway, And pick him up, I reckon, before the morning light. “We must run some risk, indeed, but I know the fords of Tweed, And there is no safety here, now suspicion is awake, John will ride my good bay horse, and use it tenderly of course, For none can tell how long a journey next day I must take.” We had no time to waste, yet we must not seem in haste, But as if we went on calmly in our ordinary way; So the colts were all got ready by our trusty man and steady, And father crossed the Border before the break of day. Then we had a while to wait in a troubled, restless state, Till tidings came from Holland he had landed on its coast, Having been to Wooler Fair, and sold his horses there, And got money in his purse to “pay the lawing of Mine Host.” THE ROVER OF SALLEE It's oh, there was never a happier wife Than I was in all the old kingdom of Fife; And never a brighter fireside than ours, With the bairns around it all blooming like flowers; And never a better goodman than mine Whose home made him blither than stoups of wine; And he loved me as if I had still been a bride, And the fear of the Lord was at our fireside. But now, as the wild wave breaks on the sea, Even so is my sad heart breaking in me: For the woeful news that have come to hand From the Barbary shore, and the Blackamoor's land. And who will now be my honoured head? And who will win for us daily bread? And who will bring to our hearts good cheer The moment his foot at the door we hear? It was a rover of Sallee That drove at his vessel with galleys three, Leaping out from the Spanish shores Under the sweep of a hundred oars. John fought his ship till her decks were red, And fifty Moors lay dying or dead, And of his twenty gallant men But two were unwounded, the killed were ten. The pirate robbed him of all his gear, Tortured his body till death came near, Sank his ship in the deep mid sea, And bore him a slave to Barbary. There he is dragging a heavy chain, As he toils all day in the sun and rain, And he sleeps in a den among rotten weeds, And rats and toads and centipedes. O love, my love, as I stood that day On the windy pier when you sailed away, And the ship swung cheerily o'er the bar, And the sails swelled out on each bending spar, Little I dreamt I had seen the last Of the good old ship and her bending mast, Or what sad fate should her crew befall, And him that was dearer to me than all. It's oh, if I were but Queen of the land, With ships of war at my free command, I would not send them to harry Spain, Or to fight the Dutch on the lowland main; But they should sail to the Barbary coast, To battle the Moor where he keeps his host, And my goodman should delivered be From the wicked Rover of Sallee. What is the use of our great war-ships If honest sailors, on trading trips, May be boarded by pirate crews and slain, Or bound as slaves with a cruel chain? Oh that we had again Andrew Wood, Who for his country so bravely stood; Or William Scott, who by night and day Hunted the rovers from creek and bay! To ransom my man I have given up all The means that I had—but my means were small; And the Kirk is collecting, from rich and poor, Money to send to the rascal Moor. But what we need is the hand of the strong, And the sword of might to put down wrong; And oh, that our sorrows and shames might evoke A King of some mettle who cared for his folk. THE CAMERONIAN REGIMENT Sound-hearted and true, All men of good-will, Healthy and hearty, And staunch to our party, Douglasdale sends us to tell you that still It can find the right men when there's right work to do. Our Colonel's a Lord Of the old Douglas name: But next him is Cleland, And there is not a gallanter, Gone off now with Claver'se, will play the great game Better than he will, by word and by Sword. He was but a lad When he fought at Drumclog, At Bothwell a bullet, Well aimed for Rathillet, Glanced off, and hit Cleland who stood by the Bog, Cheering the men when the business looked bad. Had all been as stout As he was that day, As fearless and faithful Amid all the deathful Rushes and shocks of the battle array, There had not been a wail at the end, but a shout. Well, the verse he will write Is a profitless task; Yet it soothes his hot spirit, And so we can bear it; But give him a sword in his hand, and you'd ask No gallant soldier to order the fight. He knows us each man, And we know and trust him, And will show him our mettle In the fierce tug of battle, For it nerves every arm, when the dust-cloud is dim, Just to watch his good sword flashing still on the van. We're all Cameron's men, Pledged to Covenant work, And we'll not do it slackly, But strict and exactly, As Cromwell's lads did it at Naseby and York,— They were Sectaries, but they did godly work then. All our knapsacks contain The good Book of God's word, And every blue bonnet, With the top-knot upon it, Holds a head that can think and resolve for the Lord, And the born rights of Freemen will stoutly maintain. For the Kirk and its Cause We are banded to fight, Every man of us zealots Against Popes and Prelates, Erastians, Arminians, and those birds of night, The trafficking mass-priests who scorn all the laws. We shall not fight the worse That we also can pray, And are not, like the troopers, Roused from deep, drunken stupors, With pistol and sabre to smite, and to slay, And to trample the saints 'neath the hoof of the horse. “For Christ's Cause and Crown,” That's our watch ward in fight, And we mean to deliver The nation for ever From the false perjured king, and his surplices white, His mass-books, and priests whom we wholly disown. Let the Highland Host come, They'll be here by and by, For they may not long tarry By Tummel and Garry. Lads, close up your ranks, see your powder is dry, And blow up the trumpet, and beat the big drum. THE RABBLING OF THE CURATES Yes! they blamed us loudly of course, The man who oppressed us so long, That we counted on. But it was worse When our friends too said we did wrong, And had sullied, and tarnished with crime The grandest event of the time. Yet there's more to be said for our work Than some of our wiseacres think, We did not set on, like the Turk, Inflamed with religion and drink, To wreak a blind vengeance, and strike The good and the bad both alike. It was justice we aimed at. We chose With care whom we meant to cast out, And when some would have rough-handled those We knew nothing evil about— For there were some devout curates too— With them we had nothing to do. But the priests who were spies on their flock, Who sent lists to the soldiers to kill, Or who dragged to the cord and the block Those who liked a discourse on the hill, Which did them some good, as they thought, Them we harried well, sparing them not. It looked a rough work to be sure; But we struck at none of their lives, Only cast out their fine furniture, And meddled with none of their wives; We carried off none of their stores, But left them outside the manse doors. 'Tis like enough some caught a cold, For the weather was not always good, And it might be too much for the old, Yet I never have understood That any one died outright Of our rabbling, that gave them a fright. No blood by our lads, then, was spilt, We sought not for any one's life, But out hearts were wroth at the guilt Of the man who, when troubles were rife, Debased their high office to be The tools of a vile tyranny. Would you have us look on, and be calm When our shepherds, whose duty is plain, By preaching, by prayer, and by Psalm, To bring us to God's way again, Took to hounding dragoons on the people Who preferred the hillside to their steeple? In our worship we mostly were slack, But we all were human at least; And when friends got the boot or the rack, On the hint of some rogue of a priest, That burnt in our hearts like a fire; And our scorn and our loathing were dire. There were heads on the Netherbow Port We had honoured for patriot zeal, While turncoats and triflers at Court Were wrecking the common weal; And the Church, which should shield the oppressed, Cared only to feather its nest. No, I am not ashamed—not a whit— Of the work that I did in those days. It had been foul shame just to sit, And join in the prayer and the praise Of the wolves in sheeps' clothing, who then Had the cure of the souls of poor men. I grant we had not enough faith To resist, in the time of their might, Like those who withstood unto death, And held by the truth and the right; We shared in the nation's complaints, But we were neither heroes nor saints. What would you? Some men are so made, They are not very noble or brave; Let them quietly work at their trade, Eat and drink, and go down to the grave, And they may be good citizens, though Not a throb of great Spirits they know. Yet, when they can safely reveal The thoughts of their heart, you may find That they long had been fain to conceal The wrath of a well-ordered mind, As the thunder lies hid in the cloud, Till it bursts at length angry and loud. We were mostly young lads from the plough, And our wrath was a kind of horse-play— A frolic of justice, which now Looks to me just too mirthful and gay; It had better befitted the cause Had our rabbling been worse than it was. We gave the bad curates a fright, And we laughed at their crestfallen looks When we roused them from slumber that night, And burned their messe-robes and messe-books: But we left them to go their own way, With their lives and their gear for a prey. THE SIEGE OF THE BASS Just two miles off from the mainland, Where the Forth is broad and free, The Bass and its grim rock-fortress Stands fronting the grey North Sea; The wild gulls nest on its ledges, Or over it fly in clouds, And round it the sea-waves breaking Turn white for the sailor's shrouds. Four of Dundee's wild gallants, Left in its prison to pine, Seized on it, one day the soldiers Had gone off for fuel and wine, Closed the gate fast on them sternly, And threatened to shoot them down; They would hold the Fort for its Master, The king who owned the crown. A Middleton, a Halyburton, With ensigns Roy and Dunbar, They were reckless and brave as the Leader They had followed in peace and war; Young Crawford, Ardmillan, and others Ere long, too, would share in the fight; And sixteen men, at the utmost, They bearded a nation's might. They had ample shot and powder, More guns than they well could man, And plenty of swords and muskets To ply when the fray began; And watch and ward they kept strictly, As the soldier's custom is, For it was the last rag of his kingdom King James could still call his. They had nights of wild adventure When they roved in search of prey, And nights of deep carousal That lasted till break of day. Where the Whigs were of late psalm-singing, And their prayers had been loud and long, Now the roof was with laughter ringing, And ribald jest and song. They raided the coast of Lothian, They plundered the towns of Fife, They tithed the Merse to provide them With bread to maintain their life. But sixteen men in a fortress Two miles out at sea, What could they hope to accomplish? What could their purpose be? By day they would boast and swagger, By night they would rob and steal Where they found a cove to shelter, Or a shore to beach their keel; And they flaunted the king's broad banner Aloft in the sun and rain, And drank to his health, and shouted He should soon have his own again. Wroth were the Lords of Council When they met in Parliament, And the Lion ship of battle To the leaguer straight was sent: But she had to lie off helpless Till the sailors' hearts were sick, For the guns of the Fort were heavy, And they would have sunk her quick. The French king heard their story, And thereon manned a ship Which the Lion feared to tackle, And straight away did slip; So the French left fresh munitions, And store of food and wine, That they might maintain the battle, And also bravely dine. Around the Council table The nobles gnashed their teeth; Their swords hung at their girdles, But each glued in its sheath. A nation stood behind them With all its power and might, Yet sixteen men on the Bass Rock Held out in their despite. Where was the ancient courage That stood by the gallant Bruce? And the large resource and patience That sought nor peace nor truce? Where were the daring spirits That did to Wallace turn? And where the skill of battle That won at Bannockburn? Once Scotland had her soldiers Who could her cause make good— Her Douglases and Randolphs, Her brave Sir Andrew Wood, Her Lindsays and her Leslies, And hosts of fighting men; But now she has Dalrymples, And for the sword a pen. It is craft they use for courage, And blows dealt in the dark, As the men of Glencoe can witness, And no dog dares to bark; They follow the ways of Rothes, And Lauderdale, and those Who sought but to find their profit In the nation's wrongs and woes. We hoped when the Papist monarch Took shipping across the sea, That all would be now well ordered, And the people glad and free. But their rule is weak and cruel, And the nation rent and torn; And sixteen men on the Bass Rock Could laugh them all to scorn. For two long years it lasted, That siege of the brave sixteen; And when at length they yielded, All hunger-pinched and lean, They came off with flying colours In soldierly array, With sword, and dirk, and pistol, And a sporran—with their pay! Now, shame upon the laggards, With hands so weak and slack, To be mocked by these rough troopers, With a nation at their back! And to pay the rogues for robbing The poor folk on the shore, And send them away, still bragging They would play the game once more! DAMIEN AND MARION CUNNINGHAM It's oh the bonnie Tynron braes Where the broom grows high and green, And the ivied wall and the birchtree tall, And the burn that runs between; Where, in the dewy gloaming light, So oft our tryst had been. The stars came forth to watch us there, And smile upon our bliss; The small birds and the wanton hare, They shared our joy, I wis; There were no other eyes to care How fondly we might kiss. My love was lord of Abingdon, And I was a Glencairn; But true love levels all, and none Its blessedness may learn, Who will not pass, as lad and lass, Among the broom and fern. Still far below the waters flow, Low-whispering as they move, And the mavis still, at his sweet will, Sings high on the tree above— He sings the same song o'er and o'er, As we did with our love. And still the primrose pranks the braes When spring is in the air, And still the broom is in a blaze When young birds flutter there; But the scented broom and its golden bloom Are heavy with grief and care. No more they speak about love and hope, As they did so fondly then, But of a host that pine and drop, All fainting, famished men, And a lonely grave by the breaking wave On the shore of Damien. LADY GRANGE O the villain! to leave me here On this desolate rock far out at sea, Among red-shanked Celts, with their freckles and warts, And gannets and kittiwakes, puffins and scarts, Which are all that I have for company. Never a word of their Erse I know, I might as well talk to the screaming gulls: And the big waves crash on the rocks all day, And growl through the night, like beasts of prey Worrying over rib-bones and skulls. The poor folk mean to be kind in their way; But I cannot breathe in their peatsmoked rooms, Nor eat of their oily, ill-cooked food, Nor sleep at night, for the vermin brood You might sweep from the bed with their heather brooms. O my Lord Grange, I held you once For a good man truly, with wit and sense: But I know you now for a rogue ingrain, And how can you ever show face again Among men of honour and reverence? Four of your gillies, bare-legged loons, Broke into my chamber, and bound me fast; Gagged me, and carried me out of town, Hither and thither, and up and down, To land me here on this rock at last. But you dare not keep me always here; I know the Mac Leod will set me free, When he learns, as he shall, that a lady born Lies on his desolate isle, forlorn, Moaning her fate to the moaning sea. What will he think of my Lord of Grange, When the wrongs I have borne shall come to light? And what will the rest of the Fifteen say Of their brother Judge, when they have to lay The Law down about him, and do me right? I have shielded him long, as a wife will do, But now I will speak out all the truth; He is come of a traitorous, viperous tribe, And is falser and baser than tongue can describe, Though his looks are so fair, and his tongue so smooth. The hypocrite! think of him reading for hours His Bible at nights, when the lamps come in, While his madame creeps stealthily up the back stairs, And hears him ere long at his evening prayers, Loudly bewailing his load of sin. And then, too, he must have his prophet-maids, Who reel off their dreams to him by the yard In a dingy back-shop in the Potter-row, To freshen his faith when it waxes low, And to fool him out of a fine reward. We Chievellys are said to be rash and hot, Ready enough with a word and a blow, And their hands, I allow, have with blood been stained Of some they have stabbed, and some they have brained, But they count not a hypocrite yet that I know. But he! he's a hollow pretence all through, There is nothing he will not deceive you about; He lies to the Kirk in his pious words, He lies to the King, and the Court, and the lords, And he lied to me, till I found him out. Hear him sentence a witch to be burned, Or a Border thief to be hanged for a cow, What a God-fearing man you would take him for! Yet I think that the country would profit more If it were his own neck that should “rax the tow.” And oh, the tasses of usquebagh! And the gallons of potent wine he drinks! And his nasty stories, and filthy jokes, As he soaks his carcase, and slowly strokes His great fat paunch, and leers and winks! Was ever a woman so vilely wed? Was ever a wife abused like me? Cast forth alone among gulls and seals, And jabbering Celts, with their lines and creels, And the dreary call of the moaning sea? I cannot get rid of that moaning call; Go where I may, it follows me still: It rings in my ears the whole day long, And haunts my dreams with its wailing song, Till I wish there was something near to kill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FUGITIVE PIECES THE ELDER'S DAUGHTER Cast her forth in her shame, She is no daughter of mine; We had an honest name, All of our house and line; And she has brought it to shame. What are you whispering there, Parleying with sin at the door? I have no blessing for her; She is dead to me evermore; Dead! would to God that she were! Dead! and the grass o'er her head! There is no shame in dying: They were wholesome tears we shed Where all her wee sisters are lying; And the love of them is not dead. I did not curse her, did I? I meant not that, O Lord: We are cursed enough already; Let her go with never a word: I have blessed her often already. You are the mother that bore her, I do not blame you for weeping; They had all gone before her, And she had our hearts a-keeping; And oh, the love that we bore her! I thought that she was like you; I thought that the light in her face Was your youth and its morning dew, And the winsome look of grace: But she was never like you. Is the night dark and wild? Dark is the way of sin— The way of an erring child, Dark without and within— And tell me not she was beguiled. What should beguile her, truly? Did we not bless them both? There was gold between them duly, And we blessed their plighted troth, Though I never liked him truly. Let us read a word from the Book; I think that my eyes grow dim; She used to sit in the nook There, by the side of him, And hand me the holy Book. I wot not what ails me to-night, I cannot lay hold on a text. O Jesus! guide me aright, For my soul is sore perplexed, And the Book seems dark as the night. Ah! the night is stormy and dark, And dark is the way of sin; And the stream will be swollen too; and hark How the water roars in the Lynn! There's an ugly ford in the dark. What did you say? To-night Might she sleep in her little bed? Her bed so pure and white! How often I've thought and said, They were both so pure and white. But that was a lie—for she Was a whited sepulchre; Yet oh she was white to me, And I've buried my heart in her; And it's dead wherever she be. Nay, she never could lay her head Again in the little white room, Where all her wee sisters were laid; She would see them still in the gloom, All chaste and pure—but dead. We will go all together, She, and you, and I; There's the black peat-hag 'mong the heather Where we could all of us lie, And bury our shame together. Any foul place will do For a grave to us now in our shame; She may lie with me and you, But she shall not sleep with them, And the dust of my fathers, too. Is it sin, you say, I have spoken? I know not; my head feels strange; And something in me is broken; Lord, is it the coming change? Forgive the word I have spoken. I scarce know what I have said; Was I hard on her for her fall? That was wrong, but the rest were dead, And I loved her more than them all— For she heired all the love of the dead. One by one as they died, The love, that was owing to them, Centred on her at my side; And then she brought us to shame, And broke the crown of my pride. Lord, pardon mine erring child: Do we not all of us err? Dark was my heart and wild; Oh might I but look on her Once more, my lost loved child! For I thought, not long ago, That I was in Abraham's bosom; And she lifted a face of woe, Like some pale, withered blossom, Out of the depths below. Do not say, when I am gone, That she has brought my grey hairs to the grave; Women do that; but let her alone, She'll have sorrow enough to brave, That would turn her heart into stone. Is that her hand in mine? Now, give me thine, sweet wife: I thank Thee, Lord, for this grace of Thine, And light, and peace, and life; And she is Thine and mine. THE MYSTERY “Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.”—Prov. xviii. i. O the haunted house on the moorland, how lone and desolate, In its antique fashions grand, it seems to frown upon its fate! Looking over the bleak moorland, looking over to the sea, Defiant in the haughtiness of some great memory. Few trees are there and stunted, for the salt-wind blows across, And swathes their twigs in lichens grey, and flakes of ragged moss; And the cotton-grass nods in the fishpond beside the spotted rush, And the newt creeps thro' their sodden roots where they grow rank and lush. But moor and marsh and stunted tree, with mosses overrun, And the Druid stone where the raven sits blinking in the sun— All are bleaker from its neighbourhood, and grouped around it lie, As round a desolate thought that fills a subtle painter's eye. Straggling over half an acre, with a rough-hewn masonry, There are portals heavy-arched, and gables crested with the fleur-de-lis, Mounted turrets, curious windows, and armorial bearings quaint, Full of rare fantastic meanings as the dreams of some old saint. And the grim old tower looms darkly with its shadow over all; Beast unclean and bird unholy brood or burrow in its wall; Moans the wind thro' long blind lobbies—distant doors are heard to slap, And the paint falls from the panels, and the mouldering tapestries flap. Falls the paint from scripture stories, all blurred with mildew damp, Fade the ancient knights and ladies from the tapestries quaint and cramp; And of all the rare carved mantels only here and there are seen A bunch of flowers and vine leaves, with a satyr's face between. Through chinks the sun is breaking, the rain breaks through the roof; There are sullen pools in the corners, and sullen drops aloof; And flitting as in woodlands, strange lights are in the rooms, And to and fro they glimmer, alter nating with glooms. And him that shelters there a-night from the wild storm or rain, Will death or madness set upon, and leaguer him amain With eldritch shapes, and eerie sounds of sorrow and of sin, And cries of utter wailing that make the blood grow thin. O the haunted house on the moorland, how lone and desolate, In its antique fashions grand, it seems to frown upon its fate! But sit not thou in its tapestried rooms about the midnight drear, When the chains clank on the staircase, and the groaning step draws near. The chains clank on the staircase, and the step is coming slow, And the doors creak on their hinges, and the lamp is burning low, And thou listenest too intently, and thy heart is throbbing fast;— Be thou coward now or bold, 'twere better face the stormy blast. Better face the storm without, you think? Alas! I cannot tell: Perhaps we lose the power, perhaps we lose the wish as well; For I have watched and pondered many a weary night and day, Ever listening thus intently in our mystic house of clay; Ever listening to its strangeness, to its sorrow and its sin, With a boldness and a terror, and a throbbing heart within; Bold to know the very thing which I feared indeed to see, Would the lamp but only hold till I searched the mystery. For is not this our human life even such a wreck of greatness, Where the trace of an ancient grandeur marks an equal desolateness? Since that which hath been is not, or only serves to wake A thirst for truth and beauty, which, alas! it cannot slake. And the ruin of its greatness casts all round an air of gloom; Earth's loveliness is darkened by the shadow of our doom; And the richness of our nature only adds a bitter point Of irony to the thought that all is plainly out of joint. And fitfully, as through a chink, the higher world of God Breaks in to make more visible our waste and drear abode; And syllables and whispers, all discordant to rehearse, Hint unutterable harmonies in the great Universe. And there are pictured tapestries in chambers of the brain, The memories of a higher state which still with us remain, But faded all and mildewed they but deepen our regret, Like twilight glories telling of a glory that is set. And mingling with the traces of a wondrous beauty still, There are lustful satyr faces turning all the good to ill; And like birds unholy nestling and defiling every part, Oh, the broods of evil passions in the corners of the heart. And if thou watch there thoughtful, in silence of the night, With a longing and a listening too intent to know the right; Have a care, for there are phantoms—be thou cowardly or bold,— That syllable and whisper what shall make the blood run cold. Oh to rid me of that longing! to stand aloof and free From the dread, or from the power of the dread Infinity! Oh to grasp, or to be careless of, the subtle thoughts that fly And shun the sense, like flower-smells, the closer we come nigh! Just to dwell among the little things of life, and be content With its ordinary being and its ordinary bent; Still to wade in the clear shallows and the old accustomed fords, 'Mong the thin and easy truths and the babbling of old words! To think and feel, and comprehend all I might think and feel, With a heart that never sickened, and a brain that did not reel Under the sense of mystery and mighty shadows, cast Upon the soul from life and death—the future and the past. So thou'rt crushed beneath a shadow!—Ah! I would that I could smile With your satisfied philosophy; but on my heart the while The shadow of the Infinite is laid oppressively, And though I know that it is light, alas! it darkens me. In the lonesomeness and thoughtfulness of the still midnight hour, Hast thou never felt the mystery of being, and its power?— The great light from the Godhead, and the cross-light from man, From that which is and ought to be—the portion and the plan? How they are twined and parted, yet firmly linkèd still By necessity of being in the dread Almighty will! Hast thou never yearned to see the sun break thro' this gathered haze, Though he quenched thy little hearth-fire by the glory of his blaze? Never felt the eager longing in the inner heart of men, Like a tiger pacing restless to and fro his narrow den, For his mighty limbs grow irksome with the lack of room to play, And he pineth for a leap—a bound into the night or day? Ah, me! to be a botanist or book-worm! just to task A herbal or a history to answer all I'd ask; And be content to live, and work, and die, and rot—nor ever Writhe with a mighty longing and a sense of high endeavour. Why are all things yet a question? What is nature? What is man? What is truth? and what is duty? Why, answer as we can, Has the soul a deeper question still to put, when all is done, Which goes echoing into darkness, and answer there is none? Oh, I've heard that echo often dies in mockery away In the distance of conception, like the waters of a bay Surging far into a lone sea cave—you cannot tell how far— And there is neither light of torch, nor light of moon or star. Can I will, and can I be, and do, all I have thought and felt? Can I mould mine opportunity, and shake off sin and guilt? Is life so thin-transparent, as men have thought and said? And God a mere onlooker to see the game well played? 'Twixt the willing and the being—'twixt the darkness and the light, Is there no interval for Him to exercise His might? Then perish all my hesitance, and all your power and pelf;— I will be loyal to the truth, and royal to myself. I will call out from the depths a boundless truth—a certain key To unlock the ancient secrets of our hoar perplexity; For the glow of one vast certainty would banish chaos-night, And canopy my soul as with a dome of rainbow light. O the sounding waves should speak to me, and be well understood; The violet should tell the secret of its pensive mood; And the dew-drops why their tears are formed on the eyelash of the light, And that lorn wind in the woodland why it sobs the livelong night. For the whole creation groaneth with a sorrow not its own, And to all its many voices grief is still the undertone, And on all its sunny aspects lies a shadow I would fain Lift, and know with what a birth it is travailing in pain. I would speak with the wild Arab deep-throat guttural truth, and sound The heart-depths of ascetic, squatting loathsome on the ground: Taste all truths of past or present, and all truths of clime and race, Where'er a true Divinity was deemed to have a place. I would know all creeds and gospels, and how they played their part, Each with its place appointed for this changeful human heart: Each with a dawn of progress, and a share of good and ill, Each with its work appointed by the Eternal will. But tossing on the ocean of a changeable belief, To deem there is no certainty and hope for no relief, With no faith in the old cause ways and the lamplights, it is dreary To be wandering as I wander now, so aimless, dark, and weary. Woe's me! but life is rigid—is not plastic to my will; Thoughts they come and go, like spirits with the mist about them still; And the strife is ineffectual towards lighting up the soul, Like the faint and glimmering twilights that creep around the pole. To myself I am all mystery: I fain would act my part; But the problem of existence aches unsolved within my heart. How can this life be possible?—What matter now to ask? 'Tis already a necessity—an urgent, hourly task. Ah! there the clouds break up; and lo! a clear bright star uprearing, Its face deep, deep in heaven, beside the crystal throne appearing: Though life be dreary, and truth be dark; yet duty is not so: Lay thy hand then to its labour, and thy heart into the blow. Like the light of a dark lantern is the guiding light for thee, A circle on the earth just where thy foot should planted be: But turn it to the mountains that encompass life and doom, And it flickers like a shadow, and only shows the gloom. O the haunted house on the moorland, all lone and desolate, Let it stand in its antique fashions frowning grimly on its fate; But brood not thou with thought intense about the dark midnight, But turn thee to thy task, and do thy work with all thy might. The day is short and changeful, the night is drawing on, And maybe there is light beyond, and maybe there is none; But the grief and pain and struggle, and the hoar perplexity, Will not yield their secrets up to any questioning of thee. THE REVELATION He was wont to creep and stumble, with a slow uncertain pace, And a supplicating doubt o'er all his hard, unbending face; And our mirth would make him scornful, and our pity made him wince, When the fitful moody dream was on, perverting the good sense. He was sharp, too, with his reasons, and his deep, invet'rate sneer Mocked the highest and divinest without reverence or fear; And our pious saws and customs, he would laugh at them, and call The old lace that did embroider the hypocrisy of all. For the world seemed out of joint to him, and rotten to the core, With Gods and creeds, once credited, but credible no more, And duties high, heroic, that once were bravely done; But for action, we had babbling only now beneath the sun. And there was nothing sacred in the universe to him— No lights of awe and wonder—no temple fitly dim; Ever scornfully he reasoned, ever battled with his lot, And he rent, not understanding, the fine sanctities of thought. But the blind old man is altered to a cheerful hopefulness, And now serenest thought and joy are mantling in his face; At one with his own spirit, at one with all his kind, At one with God's great universe—he sees though he is blind. And it's all that sweet child's doing; see them at the lattice there, How his fingers steal amid the long brown clusters of her hair; And she looks up with her thoughtful eys of lustrous, loving blue, And tells him of the rosebuds that are peeping into view. They say he found her one night, humming o'er a quiet tune, As he walked, in mournful sadness, beneath the tranquil moon; Yet sporting in his sorrow, mourning with a scornful mirth, Like a blind old Samson grappling with the pillars of the earth. And she came upon him gently, as an angel from the Lord, And she led him with a loving hand, and with a pious word; And she fringed the dark clouds of his soul with lights of heaven's own grace, And she breathed into his life a breath of tranquil hopefulness. And he's no more sharp with reasons; thought sits calmly on his brow, And the dew upon his thoughts is not changed to hoar-frost now; And he plays such rare sweet music with a natural pathos low; There is no sorrow in it, yet 'twill make your tears to flow. For he's full of all bird-singing, and the cheery ring of bells, The rain that drizzles on the leaves, the dripping sound of wells, And the bearded barley's rustling, and the sound of winds and brooks, That in the quiet evening floats about the woodland nooks; And the old ocean-murmurs, and all the hum of bees, And varied modulations of the many-sounding trees, These tune his heart to melodies, that lighten all its load; Yet their gladness hath a sadness, though it speak to him of God. And he knows all shapes of flowers: the heath, the fox-glove with its bells, The palmy ferns' green elegance, fanned in soft woodland smells; The milkwort on the mossy turf his nice-touch fingers trace, And the eye-bright, though he sees it not, he finds it in its place. And it's all that sweet child's doing, as they saunter by the brook, If they be not singing by the way, she reads the blessed Book; Reads the story of the sorrow of the man that loved us all, Till the eyes that cannot see her let the tears in gladness fall. Oh, a blessed work is thine, fair child; and even so we find When we, bedridden with sick thoughts, are wandering in our mind From the simple truth of nature, how blissful is the calm When Faith holds up the aching head, and presses with her palm. That's the keynote of existence; the right tone is caught at length; Cometh Faith upon the soul, and we go on in love and strength; We go on with surest footstep, by the dizziest brinks of thought, And in its deep abysses see the God whom we had sought. We were sometime dark and dreary, we were sometime wroth and proud, Warring with our fate defiant, scornful of the vacant crowd, Thoughtful of the seeming discords, and the impotence of will, And questioning the universe for meanings hard and ill. Cometh Faith upon the spirit, and the spirit is serene, Seeing beauty in the duty, and God where these are seen— God in every path of duty, beaming gracious from above, And clothing every sorrow with the garment of His love. And the dark cloud is uplifted, and the mists of doubt grow thin, Leaving drops of dew behind them, as the light comes breaking in; And the surges of the passion into quiet slumbers fall, And the discords do but hint a grander harmony through all. For around the Man of Sorrows all the sorrows of our lot Find their law and light in Him, whose life is our divinest thought; And the Infinite, the Dreaded, draws nigh to thee and me In the sacrament of sorrow—we are blind and yet we see. For if the way of man here is a way of grief and loss, Even so the way of Godhead was upon the bitter cross,— Upon the bitter cross, and along a tearful story, Till the wreath of thorns became the crown of heaven's imperial glory. So the sorrow and the sacrifice, whereat we do repine, Are but symbols of the kinship 'twixt the human and divine— But the law of highest Being and of highest honour given; For the wreath of cruel thorns is now the empire crown of heaven. Rest thee on that faith divine, and all the history of man Round its thread will crystallise in order of a glorious plan; For the grief is still divinest, and our strains of deepest gladness Show their kindred by their trembling ever on the verge of sadness. Rest thee on that holy faith, and all the misty mountain tops, Where thy thoughts were cold and cloudy, shall beam forth with radiant hopes; And the harmony of all things, never uttered into ears, Shall be felt in deep heart-heavings, like the music of the spheres. 'Tis the shallow stream that babbles—'tis in shallows of the sea Where its ineffectual labours for a mighty utterance be; All the spoken truth is ripple—surge upon the shore of Death; There is but a silent swell amid the depths of love and faith. But be still, and hear the Godhead, how His solemn footsteps fall In the story of the sorrow of the Man who loved us all; Be still, and let Him lead thee along the brink of awe, Where the mystery of sorrow solves the mystery of Law. And the mournfulness and scornfulness will haply melt away, They were frost-work on your windows, and they dimm'd the light of day; And you took their phantom pictures for the scenery of earth, And never saw in truth the world that made your mournful mirth. Only let the Heaven-child, Jesus, lead thee meekly on the path, Through thy troubles, strewn with blossoms of a kindly aftermath; And for reasons sharp and bitter, quiet thoughts will rise in thee, As when light, instead of lightning, gleams upon the earth and sea. And the world will murmur sweetly many songs into thine ear, From the harvest and the vintage, as their gladness crowns the year; From the laughter of the children, glancing lightsome as life's foam; From the Sabbath of the weary, and the sanctities of home. Yea, the sickness and the sorrows, and the mourner's bitter grief Will have strains of holy meaning, notes of infinite relief, Whispering of the love and wisdom that are in a Father's rod; And their sadness will have gladness speaking thus to thee of God. And if He give thee waters of sorrow to thy fate, He will give them songs to murmur, though but half articulate, Like the brooks that murmur pensive, and you not know what they say, But the grass and flowers are brightest where they sing along their way. Thus in thoughtful contemplation of the full-orbed life divine, Shall the fragmentary reason find the Law that doth combine All the seeming antinomies of the Infinite decree That has linked the highest Being with the highest misery. Ye that dwell among your reasons, what is that ye call a God, But the lengthening shadow of yourselves that falls upon your road; The shadow of a Self supreme, that orders all our fate, Sitting bland in contemplation of the ruins desolate? Oh, your subtle logic-bridges, spanning over the abyss From the finite, with its sadness, to the Infinite of bliss! You would find out God by logic, lying far from us, serene, In a weighty proposition, with a hundred links between! And you send your thoughts on every side in search of Him forsooth! Speeding over the broad universe to find the only truth That lies at your hand for ever. Get thee eye-salve, man, and pray: God is walking in the garden, and it is the noon of day. Roll up these grave-clothes, lay them in a corner of the tomb; He is risen from dead arguments; what seek ye in their gloom? Leave the linen robes and spices—foolish hearts are thine and mine, How could love and faith be called upon to bury the divine? Oh, not this the way of Faith, not this the way of holy Love, Where the Christ of human story, and the Christ of heaven above, Blends the duty and the beauty—blends the human and divine, By His crown of many sorrows ever glorifying thine. Tell me no more of your reasons; do not call me to embark On a voyage to the tropics with an iceberg for an ark, Swaying grandly o'er the billows, shining brightly in the sun, But to melt away beneath me ere the voyage be half done. I heed not of your logic; I am well convinced of God: 'Tis the purpose He is working, and the path that He has trod Through the mystery of misery—the labyrinth of sin, That clouds the world around, and overcasts the sould within. And you've not discovered God—and I care not though you did— That is not the ancient secret from the generations hid; 'Tis the purpose, and the moral, and the harmony of life, That we ravel in unravelling till exhausted with the strife. And my heart was all despairing, and my soul was dark and dreary, And the night was coming fast on me—a lonesome night and eerie— As bit by bit the wreck went down, and all I clung to most, Turned to straws and drifting bubbles, and was in the darkness lost. And my heart grew more despairing, and my soul more dark and dreary, Till I saw the Godhead bending, faint and meek, and very weary; Not in blessedness supernal, sitting easy on a throne, Dealing sorrows unto others, with no sorrow of His own. And I read in His great sorrows the significance of mine— Even the Law of highest Being, proving kin with the divine; Love travailing in pain with a birth of nobleness, And dying into Life with sure development of bliss. Then the discords lost their terror, and the harmonies began To be heard in sweetest snatches, where a peaceful spirit ran Through strangest variations of the universal pain, With the still recurring cadence of the cross for its refrain. Snatches of the concord, never fully uttered unto man, Yet discovering in their pathos, the dim outline of the plan, Whereby the pain and sorrow, and the evil might be wrought, Into the rarest beauty, and highest unisons of thought. Heed not, then, the many reasons—the cross-lights and the broken, That are glimmering all around thee with half-meanings but half-spoken; Turn thee to the Man of Sorrows—ECCE HOMO!—look on God; He will ease thee of thy sorrows, opening blossoms in the rod. All the creeds are but an effort feebly to interpret Him, Like the sunlight—through a prism that breaks into a chamber dim; Hie thee forth into the daylight, wherefore darken thus thy room, And then moan that there is only light enough to show the gloom? ECCE HOMO! all ye nations, tribes, and peoples of the earth, Leave the priests their poor devices, and the scribes their barren dearth; Here is flesh and blood and feeling—thou shalt eat of Him and live, And walk with Him in glory whom the heavens did once receive. And your path shall be a path of light, your tears a morning shower; All the germs of nature opening fragrant, underneath the power Of the quiet light that claspeth all the world in its embrace, And makes it beam and prattle up into the Father's face.</field>
