      <field name="fulltext">To the right Honourable Sir Thomas Bromley Knight, Lord Chaunceler of England, and of her Maiesties moste Honorable priuie Counsell, George VVhetstones, wisheth long continuaunce of honour, health and happines.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A remembraunce of the pretious vertues of the right Honorable and reuerend Iudge, Sir Iames Dier, Knight, Lorde cheefe Iustice of the Common Pleas. Lidgate, Bawldwin, and many writers moe, the heauie faules of naughty m? haue showne VVhen their good deedes, to tell they all are slowe, The moste famous Orrators &amp; Poets of Greece, were hyred by Queene Artimisea to eternise the life vertues of her husb?d Mausolus. VVhose vertuous liues deserueth to be blowne: with such shrill tr?ps, as made Mausolus knowne The cause (think I) through ruthe m?s harmes they raise And doo enuy to sound the worthies praise. But so or no, the wrong dooth much increase, which my weake muse, hath laboured l?g to right VVho liuing in a chosen place of peace, where vertue raignes, &amp; conquers Enuies might: The vveapons of vertue. who not with la?ce, but lawrel bough doth fight Her Cheefetaines then of writers iustly claime, That Death nor time, their memories may maime. Among the moe, that worste may paye this debte, vppon the good, I haue bestow'd my zeale: Not like their woorth, but able wittes to whet, For to expose their vertues euery deale, Who stayes were of our happy common weale. That their good rules, such as succeede may guide, And liue by Fame, as they had neuer dy'de. To bothe effects (who liuing did no wronge) The breathles course of good Iames Dier knight; A custome vvith which the Venetians in their funerals, do honour their MaiestratesOf Common Pleas, the Lord cheefe Iustice long, In Scarlet Robes, I laye in open sight, To shewe that death, ore honour hath no might. Whose deeds doo shine, as Diamonds in the darke And liues, though dead, if to his Fame you harke. Like him that long against the sonne dooth gase, To prie into his vertues, dimme my eyes: VVhose Monuments, shine as a Pharœs blase, Meete vertues for a Iudge,In Iudgement iust, in counsell graue and wise, Clearer of doubts, in law like clowds which rise. A liue refuge, of those whom wronge did paine, A Dyer such, as dy'de without a staine. But to discribe this woorthy Iudge at large, Let it suffice to showe from whence he came: He was borne in an house of auncient woorship. The purple Grape, a Thorne dooth neuer charge, Nor rascall rase, oft breedes a Childe a fame, His birth was good, his acts doo blaze the same. In woorship borne, in honour he did ende, Raysde by desart, and not by fate, or freend. Vertue the best Cognizance of a Gentle. In tender yeares, he was to learning set, And Vessels long, their seasoned liquors taste. As time grew on, he did to Oxford get, And so fr? thence, he was in Strand Inne plaste; But him with fame, the middle Temple graste. Strand Inne sometimes an Inne of Chauncerie. The deapth of lawe, he searcht with painefull toyle, Not cunning Quirks, the simple man to spoyle. His witte was quicke, his iudgement was as sound, His Clyents such, as weare with wrong opprest: His conscience good, him first with credit cround, A good example for lawiers. who with much care, his clyents wrongs redrest. By vertue thus, he clymde abooue the rest, And feard no fall, sithe merrit was his guide, VVhen reaching heads, ofte slip in cheefest pride. From roome to roome, he stept by true degrees, And mounts at length, to soueraigne Iustice place He liued 23 yeares in this office.VVhere long he sat cheefe Iudge of c?mon Pleas, And to say truthe, he sate with Iustice grace, VVhose sacred will, was written in his face. Setled to heare, but very slowe to speake, Till either part at large his minde did breake. And when he spake he was in speeche reposde, He contraryed Arist opinion, Amor et odium, et proprium comodum semper facet iudices non cognoscere verum.His eyes did searche, the simple sutors harte. To put by bribes, his handes were euer closde, His prosesse Iust, he tooke the pooremans parte. He rulde by Lawe, and lystned not to Arte. These foes to truthe, looue, hate, and priuate gaine, which most corrupt, his conscience could not staine The freendles wight, which did off?d through need A good consideration.He euer more, with mercy did respect, The prowder theefe, that did his Trespasse feede, Through trust to freends, with scourge of law he for by the fault, not freends he did direct, checkt Thus he with grace, the poore mans loue did draw, And by sharpe meanes, did keep the prowd in awe. As good things are, by euill men ofte abusde, Summum ius est summa iniuria. euen so the lawe, to wrong sometime is wrest: The lawe pronounst, no trauell he refusde, To ease their greefes, whom that he fo?d opprest, And fewe so bad as disobayde his heast, The testimony of a good conscience. This he good Iudge, in circute as he rode, As cause requyrde, still as a Chauncelor stoode. Fit men he did, in office euer place, and ofte put by, his freends and neerest kin: Sufficient men ought to be placed in offices, because they are serua?ts of the common weale. Affirming though the gifte were in his grace, The Common weale, cheefe intrest had therein, And therefore meete, the worthy should it win, VVords like himself, who fauoured publique good Before then gaine, that were spronge of his blood. VVhere he was borne, all sorts his bountie knew, He still stayde strifes, in places as he goeth: At VVestminster, his death poore sutors fewe, Who for the poore, was Iudge and pleader bothe The riche mans cause, he fauord but in trothe. Where as he dwelt, the County sounds this mone, Alas, the good Lord Dier now is gone. And not alone, but all the realme besyde, His fatall losse, haue cause for to lament: VVho father was of lawe, which right dooth guide And as his Childe, the same to Iustice bent Sic volo, sic lubeo, ster pro ratione voluntas.VVhich to his will the Iudge vniust dooth rent, But he good man, did washe his hands fro wronge, And sildome sought, to laye his foe alonge, He neuer raylde, nor rag'de arfaulty men, But in good woords, gaue sentence of their paine: VVhere grace he spi'de, he gaue such counsell th?, As many euill, to goodnes he did gaine, From selfe reuenge, he euer did refraine, And yet seuere when it with Iustice stoode: A Tullie right, all for his Contryes good. He did not prie into his neighbours state, Vnlesse it were for to sustaine his right: His godly minde, flew no ambitious gate, But in the meane, did euermore delight, wh? climing heads, oft reache beyond their might He iustly did discharge his charge assynde, And neuer wrought, to crosse his soueraign a minde Lords Letters sent, to winke at some abuse, He aunswerd thus, I am to Iustice sworne: I must offend, or your desire refuse, which woords to deeds, he euer more did to tourne: Yet in such sorte, as reau'd conceight of scorne: Thus faylde the best, from Iustice him to drawe, VVhen most men make, the mighties will a lawe. The Lawyer lewde (as many naughty are,) And yet the law, to cloke their wrongs do straine: Needefull reprehention. He thus would check, this string my frend doth iar You of the Lawe would make a backsword faine, For others eg'de, for your offences plaine. You can by lawe, vnpunisht steale a Farme, But mend, or hell will sure your carcas warme. You not sustaine, but doo the lawe oppresse, Non facias altrui quod non vis tibi fieri. Ignorantia iuris non excusat. And so a foe vnto the Common weale. Lawe frends the good, &amp; dooth the leawd suppresse &amp; you would make, the good her vengea?ce feele Your neighbor vse, as he with you should deale. Gods lawe sayth so, with which ours ought agree, VVhich learne for ignoraunce no plea wilbe. The like aduise he dayly did bestowe, Vppon all sorts, as their vocations were: The spender, he the paines of want would showe, The greedy man, how that his carke and care, Fastned on goods for other men to share. Shrowd m?s complaints, he in this check did blame The blinde for sloth may ill vpbraide the lame. The labouring man, that liues by sweate of browe, If him he found, in wrangeling to delight. He thus would charme: good neighbor ply the Plow Sute of lavv is greeuous. to all men. Lawe tireth such; as haue freends coine and might, Let honest men be daies men of thy right. Thus he good Iudge the poore m?s wealth did prise Before their gaine, which by the Lawe dooth rise? One all degrees, in counsell or in meede, He thus performde the office of a freende, The fatherles and VViddowes he did feede, The office of a good man.Sustainde their rights, their iniuries did end, A Cato right, that did his substaunce spend On such as lackt affirming how that these, His Children vvere, VVife, kinsefolke and alyes. For publique good, wh? Care had cloide his minde, The onely ioye for to repose his sprights. Was Musique sweet, which showd him wel inclind For he that dooth in Musique much delight, The vertue of Musique. A conscience hath, disposed to most right. The reason is, her sound within our eare. A Symphathye, of heauen we thinke we heare. And therefore calde, the Image of the soule, Forth of the hart, which care &amp; greefe dooth wrest The Swan in songs, her passing Bell dooth knowle The Nightingale with thornes against her brest, Dooth wake to singe, when other birdes doo rest. (As showen before) for to deceiue their paine, VVhose torm?ts else would make th? crie amaine. This vvas his life, to vvorke his Countries vveale, He did his health, vvith care and studdie vvound; VVhen as his minde diseased he did feele, This vvas his ease, sweete harmonie did sounde, Thus all vvas good, vvhereto himselfe he bound. But some the best, vvith enuie vvill assaulte, Nemo sine crimine viuit. And carping saye, none liues without a fault. I graunt it true (but theires more greater are) the Bee sometimes, the huswiues h?d doth stinge, But with his Combe, the householde better fare, So good men do, themselues with trespas wringe, And with good deedes, a number profit bring. Now see if these through sorrow purchase grace, Offend like those, that would their fames deface No Enuie no, thy Barke stayes on a shelfe, The enuious vvound themselues.The vertuous are, with such a Mirror armde, As doo returne thy Darts vpon thy selfe, Their bodies ofte, I graunt by thee are harmd, but their good deedes are fr? thy venim charm'd, VVherefore in spight of Enuie, Time, and Death, This Iudges fame, my muse shall keepe in breath. Not like his worth, whose life before is tould, the more our losse, his death doth now draw neere Yet when he was, infirmed weake and olde, In Iustice seate, his iudgement still was cleare, Yea to his end he traueld sutes to heare. Yeares could no whit his memorie asswadge, VVhen many wise are childish in their age. VVell Time, in time, what worldly is will weare, And more will waste, the world it selfe to naught, The Cannons force, the lofty Towers teare, The strongest man, how proude so be his thought In trackt of time, vnto his Graue is brought. Euen so this Iudge, when as his time was come, Could by no Plea, defer his fatall doome. VVhen Sicknesse came, the messenger of death, He patiently, his sommons did obay: See heere the end, of all that draweth breath, Night clowdes (quod he) the sun &amp; brightest day. The huge high Oke, a blast dooth ouerwaye. So Prince, nor peere, to saue them from the graue, Noe Charter haue, more then the wretched slaue. A heauy tale, vnto the worldly wight, That hath health, wealth, and in his bowels peace, But folish man, and foe to thy delight, Thy sorrow leaue, thou liu'ste by this discease, As buryed corne, consumes ere it increase. For flesh and blood, no lasting life can giue, But beeing dead, the soule dooth euer liue. If men with zeale this difference foresawe. The imperious subscription of the Pope in his commissions and warrants, alluded vnto tiranous Prynces which make their wyls a lavve.A chaunge in life, I hope would foorthwith bee: Fiat per me, could neuer stand for lawe, The Cleargies workes, should with their wordes agree, The Iudge would Iudge, as he would Iudged be, This sentence would, the murdrers hart affright, The sheathe shall wo?d, who with the sword doth smight And to be short, all sorte of men would learne, To liue, to die, and die to liue againe: For what auayles; a world of rule to yearne, To lose the soule, and leaue the same in fyne, Bothe lands and goods, men must of force resigne And onely keepe their actions good and bad, Them to condemne, or else with ioyes to clad. More would I saye, if greefe to ease gaue place. But all in vaine, weakenes commaunds my wyll: The tyred Iade, dooth trip at euery pace, when pampred horse, doo praunce against the hill, So fewe woords, the sicke mans hart dooth kyll. VVhen healthfull men, with long discourses play, But what is breefe, may best be borne away. These woords and more, of more deuine regarde, He soundly spake, when as his hart was ill: His seruaunts paines he largely did rewarde, To Orphants poore, whose Father he was still, He gaue to the Hospytall of saynt Bartholmea tvvo fayre houses and to other Hospitalles and almes houses money and lyuinges Bothe lands and goods, he did bequeathe by will. And other gifts of charitie did giue, VVhich scape my Pen, but make his same to liue. Lords claime (quod he) a Heriot of the dead, A homage dew, and men their rights must haue. Bound to my Prince, by seruice, looue and dread, T'ys iust I paye, a Heriot for my graue, VVherefore I will, her Maiestie shall haue, My Diamonde, and my Chaine of honnor eke, He bequethed the queenes Maiestie his Coller of Esses and a very ritche Diamond. So showde his zeale, at death was not to seeke. His worldly wyll, in order thus dispos'de, His care was past, he found his conscience cleare: VVho yet aliue, through hope in heauen repos'de, And neither hell, the Diuell nor Death did feare, Thus like a Taper light, his life did were. And in the end at Stawghton he did die: VVhere longe he lyu'de, and little liu'de awrye. The heu? his soule, the tomb thus shrowds his corse the world his fame, while world doth last wil keep Vnto the wyse, his deeds remayne in force; VVho for his death, their harts in sorrow steepe But wronged men haue cause on cause to weepe VVherefore of right, for euery eye to see, VVhereas he lyes this mone in grau'de would be.
