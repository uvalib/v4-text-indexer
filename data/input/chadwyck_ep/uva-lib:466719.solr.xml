      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. TO HIM WHO, POSSESSED OF A TASTE TO APPRECIATE GENIUS, HAS THE GENEROSITY TO REWARD AND PROTECT IT: TO SIR JAMES BLAND BURGES, BART. THE HARP OF ERIN IS DEDICATED, WITH EVERY SENTIMENT OF RESPECT AND ADMIRATION, BY HIS MOST FAITHFUL OBEDIENT SERVANT, James Grant Raymond. Chester-street, Grosvenor-place, September, 1807. THE EXTRAVAGANZA. “Oh for a journey to th' Antipodes: Or some lone region of remotest Ind; Where, sagely sad, in solitary ease My weary sprite a safe retreat might find; Where nothing might perturb my pensive mind, But such delicious fantasies as please The forming eye, when fiery flakes at eve With wayward shapes the listless sense deceive! Then wingy-heel'd Imagination's flight Would bear me devious through the lamping sky: Then haply should I feel no low delight From earthly bonnibel's bewitching eye, Voluptuous in her dainty arms to lie; Ne stoop inglorious from so proud a height; While my fond heart pour'd forth its vain distress, Snar'd in the fetters of a golden tress.” Such was my wish, romantic wish I ween, When that soft necromancer, baulmy Sleep, Laid me, entraunc'd, amid a pleasant scene, Where many a welling spring did murmurous creep, To lull me with its liquid lapses deep; And, shaking their broad locks of glorious green, Tall trees their thick lascivious leaves entwin'd, To wooe with dalliaunce blithe the western wind. The western wind did, scant-respiring, sigh, Ne ruffled with rude wing th' attemp'red air; But fuming from the fragrant flow'rs hard by, Prankt in all hues, and delicately fair, Did surging clouds of breathing incense bear: All summer's bravery refresh'd the eye, All musick's charms, above, beneath, around, Raptur'd the ear with fascinating sound. Here cherries riper than thy leman's lip, Th' ambrosial lip of love, thou might'st behold; Here purple plums their unctuous amber weep, And mellow pears their shapely size unfold; Here pensile balls of vegetable gold, With blushes blent, through the fresh foliage peep; At once luxurious to the taste and sight, Here loaded boughs with nodding head invite. The nascent rose join'd, prodigal of sweets, The gaudy tulip, in rich broider'd vest; Here, too, th' ambitious, flaunting sun-flow'r greets Her garish lord, with wide expanded breast; Nor wanted crocus coy, in saffron drest; Harebell, affecting most obscure retreats; And of all leaf and verdure, myriads more, Each alley, emerald-pav'd, that purfled o'er. But viler than the sleeky sedge, that strews The barren sand, uptorne from ocean-bed, Were all those baser gauds, and meaner views, To that sweet semblance, next its influence shed, Descending in a veil of roses red; Delectable! not Grace, nor fabled muse, By Thespian spring, or in Thessalian shade, Such peerless pomp of symmetry displaid. Not she that, slighting her Idalian bowre, Did with the rose-faced jolly huntsman toy; Nor she, her rightful lord, in evil hour Enchafing, who dismantled stately Troy; Nor she, on Latmos' top who raped the boy; Nor yet sweet Enna's pride, (grim paramour!) Whom griesly Orcus bore from upper air, Might with this nymph for sovranty compare. Her sunny ringlets, wove in cunning braid, Form'd for her lily front a coronet; Her persant eyes two precious gems betraid, In living alabaster featly set, Arch'd with their graceful brows of shiny jet; Her swelling bosom through its slender shade Leap'd to be seen; her round and dimply chin Would tempt a frozen eremite to sin. A silken samile slightly did enfold Her luscious limbs, girt with a starry zone, Its colour heav'nly blue, bedropt with gold, And crimson, gorgeous as the proud pavone; A lambent glory on her temples shone: In sooth, she look'd not one of Nature's mold, But some gay creature whom the minstrel sees Aerial floating on the evening-breeze. Scarce my daz'd eye could I uplift to trace Th' insufferable splendence of her frame; Much less could loiter on each rising grace, Insinuating soft a subtile flame. I wist not how the fond infection came, When, sudden, (while a gracious smile her face With modest flush most amiably arraid,) Thus spoke in tuneful words the mystic maid: “Thy fond intreaty, youth of bold design! Is heard, and sanctified thy way ward pray'r; My soul in unison accords with thine; Henceforth, initiate, thou shalt be my care. Thou shalt not grieve for any mundane fair, Ne for the daughters of frail clay repine: Celestial quintessence thou shalt embrace; No mortal I, but of the sylphid race! “Deem not this airy texture too refin'd, The sacred energies of love to feel: True love is seated in the dureful mind, Which aught of fleshly converse ne'er can heal; True love is a sublim'd, nectareous meal, Where the pure sense can never surfeit find; Which time in vain may labour to destroy, Fed on eternal flowres of blooming joy. “In swinish riotise, his bouzing-cann The debochee may round the table move, Trolling lewd madrigal, mistaken man, To his imperious dear, and call it love; But 'tis not so: the leven-brond of Jove, Since first its forked function it began, Such ruinous dismay, and baleful fire, Did ne'er clance, as his profane desire. “Clipt in some harlot's captivating twine, As erst the champion who at Gaza fell, His sinews lose their wonted strength divine, His passions rude for mastery rebel: Ne can his prowess their combustion quell, Ne will they their obdurate hold resign, Till quite distraught, discomfited, forlore, His powre, and gallant portaunce, are no more. “With me far other shall thy pleasures be, If thou abjure, (as meet,) each terrene thought; Thy beastly wassail, loathsome revelrie, Ravine, and painful covetise forgot. Thou must the earth's broad bosom hold as nought, Poudred with orient pearl; nay 'sdain to see Kesars or kings who wrest a transient throne, Frail pomp if paragon'd with me alone! “Thy penance is but small, thy guerdon great: Ne sorrow shalt thou know, ne drery head; In some deep cave of cloud, a bland retreat, Myself will, duteous, delve thy bridal bed; Trust me, thy wishes are completely sped. Now silent list while briefly I repeat How goblin, elf, and gnome, and sylphid fare, Rightly yclept the denizens of air. “Should'ring the beach when angry billows rave, Some in the bitter blast for plunder yell, And plunge the drowning wight beneath the wave; Some in the dire volcano love to dwell, Oft laying cities waste with fury fell; Some torture the designing, murd'rous knave, His palsied nerves with stony glare awake, And round his pillow sulphurous torches shake. “Some, when the night-dog bays the whistling wind, (Boding sure ill,) and strange sad voices shriek; When the lone pilgrim often looks behind, And the blood freezes in his ghastful cheek; Gigantic rising, from day's durance break, Incest, or rape, or parricide, to find; Then savage tear his breast with scorpion-whip, Or hurl the caitiff down the craggy steep. “Some dapper imps and swart the mine attend, And thrid, with agile step, its glist'ring maze; The gnarled oak some from the mountain rend, And, ere cock-crowing, in the valley place; Some, in one night, a flinty fabric raise, And to its base, the next, its turrets bend; While some, the dol'rous servants of Despair, With headless steeds the car of Death prepare. “Four skeletons the coal-black coursers stride; With flamy fingers four direct the way; A winding-sheet so white, distended wide, Dabbled in blood, the coffin doth array: Four hideous urchins at the corners play, And, in quaint gambol, shift from side to side; Meanwhile, the thrice-repeated groan severe Smites the expiring sinner's closing ear. “Less fearful pranks befit the merry fays: By the trim margent of some huddling stream, To revel in the pale moon's tremulous rays; To prompt the doting nurse's idle dream; Or lure the mutt'ring carl with wanton gleam; Yet oft some ouphe malign in cradle slays The slumb'ring babe, then sucks his flowing gore, And, grinning, leaves him strangled on the floor. “Some, mounted on a butterfly's pied wing, In imitative turnay dare advance, Arm'd with the sullen hornet's desperate sting, Or proudly on a mailed beetle prance, Trusting their quarrel to chivalrous chance. Others, quick-bounding in the tiny ring, Trip to an humble-bee's melodious drone, More for their courtesy than valour known. “Some, on the glossy surface of a lake, In hazel-nut, their little pinnace, swim; Some their deep thirst from acorn-goblet slake, Then slily o'er the misty meadow skim, To pinch the beldame on return from wake; Some to the river side their course betake, And mournful pour a melancholy scream; Some, rattling mischievous mid charnel-bones, Mimic the dreadful mandrake's nightly moans. “But such low mockery, like thee, I scorn, Averting thence, in ire, my sullied sight; In yon ethereal groves of amaranth born, Nurtur'd by streams of intellectual light From the Great Spirit emanating bright, Superior orbs my sister train adorn, Whom beatific visions still inspire; Though fall'n, coeval with th' angelic quire. “Some in the halo's humid circle play, What time the pale-ey'd moon is faintly seen; Some o'er the beauteous lunar-rainbow stray, Shifting their checquer'd change of colours sheen, Better to grace their silver-shafted queen; And sometimes, more irregularly gay, Portentous, in the glowing north they rise, And wave their boreal banners o'er the skies. “Some the refulgent chariot of the sun Pursue, descending to its western goal; Some, courier-like, from distant planets run; Some the huge comet's fiery wonder roll; Some patient sentry keep at either pole; And others, by harmonious witch'ry won, All heav'n responsive to the dulcet sound, Turn the smooth spheres on tuneful axis round. “In every twinkling star, serenely shine Those white-robed ministers of placid bliss; Important is their toil, more pleasing mine;— To point the transport of the thrilling kiss, Ne'er known the maiden's throbbing heart to miss; T' anneal the drop that falls on feeling's shrine; To soothe the lover's soul when frenzy-fraught; Or lift sublime the poet's towering thought. “Arise! arise! do not thy pulses beat More lively marches, to forego thy lot? Feels not thy breast a more exalted heat, Loos'd from mortality, and yon dim spot? Surpassing joys, beyond conception wrought, In my embrace thy purer sense await.”— Embay'd in ecstacies, my humil head I rear'd; and lo! the fair phantasma fled. And now, dank-seething from the dewy earth, The vaporous exhalation stole away; The faggot blaz'd upon the cottage-hearth; And palmer Twilight, clad in amis gray, Resign'd to ebon Night his shadowy sway. Musing on descant high, whose future birth Haply may not my humble name abase, Homeward I bent my desultory pace. THE PLEASURES OF POESY. Avaunt, ye scowling cares, of hideous brow! Whilere that brooded on my joyless breast: No more beneath your baneful sway I bow, No more your terrors haunt my tranquil rest. In blooming bow'rs of fond idea blest, White-handed Hope, with seraph-smile divine, And Peace, emerging from her halcyon-nest, And all the beauteous race of Mind, are mine, While polished Moira lends a lustre to my line. There are, the witching verse who basely slight, Intent on vulgar arts I loath to share; There are who feel no exquisite delight In aught sublimely grand, or sweetly fair; There are to whom yon rich expanse of air Teems not with forms by faery fingers wrought; Still poring on the earth, with leaden stare, The tender-featur'd family of Thought Madly they mock, dull slaves! by impious Mammon caught. Though no vile hoards my iron coffers fill, Can I not commune with the heirs of fame? From the pure current of whose fluent quill, Unfading praise and kingly honours came. Can I not wooe the laughter-loving dame, With him illustrious from Lepanto's fray; Cervantes, who lost his hand in that battle. Illume my lamp at Jonson's learned flame; Or weave with thee, dear bard, the wizard lay, That whilom wildly sung by Desmond's turrets gray? Fell waves who rudely robb'd my Spenser's song Of half its worth, and griev'd the elfin queen! The concluding cantos of the Faery Queene were lost in the Irish Seas. For this so great, irreparable wrong, Ne'er on your brim be blue-ey'd sea-nymph seen, Sleeking her humid locks of glossy green, Nor sportive Triton wind his tortuous shell; Yet know, remov'd from your obdurate spleen, His descant charms the ocean-pow'rs who dwell In coral cave profound, or pearly-pillar'd cell. With him who sung the Seasons, Thomson. I may rove, Romantic Richmond! by thy wat'ry glade; Or, hallow'd to the voice of hopeless love, Thro' the fair Leasowes' Shenstone's seat. woe-enamour'd shade; Scenes in eternal bloom by song array'd! Or in delightful reveries employ The hour with him whom each melodious maid Mark'd for her own,—ah! dead to every joy, Mysterious, but unmatch'd, Invention's wondrous boy! Chatterton. Rail as ye list, ye minions of decay, And ban the wight for other ages born; Wave the pined minstrel from your gate away, Nor waste one glance upon his state forlorn; You cannot close the portals of the morn, When the faint Dawn first opes her dewy eye; Your mandate cannot hush the vocal thorn; Embitter frolic Zephyr's fragrant sigh; Or chase gay evening down the many-colour'd sky. Nor may you of their gorgeous garb deprive The flowery tribe that gem the woodland waste; Nor mar the murmurs of the honey'd hive; Nor will, by your vain menace, be effac'd The various tints, in bright embroidery plac'd By Fancy's touch, that fringe the purple cloud; Though little by your vaunted presence grac'd, The thrush will twitter from his leafy shroud, And tell the babbling brook his amorous pain aloud. Free o'er the furze-clad heath, of yellow bloom, My devious step may wander, unconfin'd, Nor miss the tissued labours of the loom, Fum'd by the incense of the western wind. My nature will no courtly shackles bind; No servile flatt'ry, varnish'd o'er with art; While, on yon mountain's misty summit shrin'd, Majestic sitting from the world apart, I to great Nature pour the homage of my heart. Witness ye hills with many a vapoury wreath Entwin'd, whose green brows court the sunny ray; Witness ye spicy gales whose odours breathe The glowing blush of health where'er you stray; Ye silvery streams that warbling wind away, Whose tiny naiads are with amber shod; Witness what rev'rence I was proud to pay, When, awfully sequester'd, I have trod Lone Nature's paths recluse, to Nature's bounteous God. To airy regions may my spirit roam, Wafted on wild Imagination's wing: There can I find and fix my viewless home, And reign o'er magic realms creative king; And while soft breezes sweep th' Eolian string, Or the loud tempest swells the bolder base, Bid my slight servants nectar'd banquets bring, And laughing at the little pomp of place, Triumphant raise my throne o'er time and bounded space. Hark! mighty Milton, leaning from his sphere, Repeats his paradisial tale again; Hark! gently steals upon my trembling ear, Of sainted Shakspeare the consummate strain: 'Tis harmony, 'tis Heaven itself. In vain Th' ecstatic impulse I essay to hide; But listed in their everlasting train, Wheel my swift journey from this globe aside, Light as the buoyant blast that fans the plume of pride. Such raptur'd vision can an empire buy? Can sceptres purchase one celestial dream? All that in jewell'd quarries glist'ring lie, The topaz' blaze, the ruby's sanguine gleam, The chrystal spotless as the living stream, The em'rald lancing fierce its vivid hues, Or diamond's insufferable beam, Are infinitely poor; nor would I choose Th' exuberance of the mine before the deathless muse. Then wail not, Genius, thy unworthy lot, Where'er thou sadly shrink'st from sight profane: Thy patient labours shall not be forgot, Nor lost the influence of thy lofty strain; From glory's nodding crest, of crimson stain, The laurel shall forsake its seat sublime, The prostrate column load the groaning plain; While rising o'er the wreck, thy sacred rhyme Shall fire to noble feats the sons of future time. Vagrant, and scoff'd, and houseless as thou art, The powerful spell of thy exalted theme Shall wake to bolder deed the warrior's heart, Shall breathe o'er sleeping love a brighter dream; From every line shall fresh instruction stream: The cottage-hearth thy pensive plaint shall hear; In regal hall thy glittering harp shall gleam; The dark cold breast of lonely sorrow chear; And start from phrenzy's lid conviction's frozen tear. Heavens! can I stoop to aught of mortal mould, Whom shapes fantastic beck to bliss unknown? Say, can I glote on rayless heaps of gold, When yon ethereal landscape is my own? Where its pure sov'reign plants his fiery throne; Are not his aureate shafts elanced round, 'Till, by her twinkling train distinctly known, His sister meek, with paler glories crown'd, Uprears her maiden front, with argent fillet bound? Hence the deep gloom that wraps in central shade The struggling splendours of th' immortal mind! Hence ev'ry black surmise that would invade The breast by charming sympathies refin'd! Ye felon doubts, I give you to the wind: Fortune benign now blows her gentlest airs, To aid my vent'rous flight too long confin'd; And Fancy her undaunted plume prepares, To sail the highest heav'n:—avaunt ye scowling cares! THE ENTHUSIAST. With hurrying finger smite the fervid wire: Th' intolerable rapture tears my soul; I burn with inspiration's fiercest fire; In lawless liberty my senses roll Beyond demurer reason's coy control, Beyond the sapient bounds by prudence laid; And while unwonted fantasies inspire, Amid th' interminable waste of shade, In mad delirium lost, my daring tour is made. Carr'd in a cloud of hyacinthine hue, Pluck'd from the lunar shrine, aloft I rise; And wond'rous sights, unutterable view, Ting'd with a thousand strange aye-shifting dyes, Such as astound the weak and daunt the wise, But often by th' ecstatic gaze are seen, When Fancy animates th' enamel'd skies With radiant hosts minute, of wayward mien, And dusky moonlight clothes the fay-encircled green. High o'er the headlong torrents' foamy fall, Whose waters howl along the rugged steep, On the loose-jutting rock, or mould'ring wall, See where gaunt Danger lays him down to sleep! The piping winds his mournful vigil keep; The lightnings blue his stony pillow warm; Anon, incumbent o'er the dreary deep, The fiend enormous strides the lab'ring storm, And mid the thund'rous strife expands his giant form. The vital stream, propell'd from every part, Tumultuous leaves each veiny channel dry: The purple flood flows heavy on my heart, As startled Madness meets my blasted eye. How lamentable now his loaded sigh, Of horrible intent, and fix'd despair! And now again, with agonizing cry, He beats his boxen cheek, he rends his hair, 'Till in hot tears is quench'd his eyeball's fiery glare. The sudden light that flash'd athwart his brain, Dread interval! but more augments his woe; Oft has that bare head brav'd the dashing rain, Its brown locks oft been silver'd o'er with snow. Ye savage tempests, cease awhile to blow; Ye angry heavens: upfurl your sheeted flame: From love's deluding cup the poisons flow That drench in anguish his distracted frame, That leave him man's fair form without the boasted name, Ah! who is she, of dark unsettled brow, That bleeding drags an angel-shape behind, And quaffs the living gore?—I know her now: 'Tis Jealousy, that monster of the mind, In whom are thousand contraries combin'd: Now moping, melancholy, o'er the wild; Now fretful, rash, unreas'ning, unconfin'd; In constancy's best blood her hands defil'd, And strangling in its birth her own devoted child. From thee, severe, insinuative pest, Such crimes terrific tragically spring, As in some tale, by fear's pale lip exprest, Bid the babe closer to the bosom cling, And breathe amazement o'er the shudd'ring ring. Ne'er may thy stealing serpents, that devour The roses wove in love's purpureal wing, With cureless venom taint affection's flow'r, Or coil thy latent deaths in my Anthemoe's bow'r! Where is thy magic pencil, to pourtray This scene so fraught with shadows of surprise, Oh thou who, fir'd by one eccentric ray Of Shakspeare, bad'st thy wild creation rise, Revealing mystic rites to mortal eyes? Alluding to Mr. Fuzeli's picture from the Midsummer Night's Dream. For lo! from darkness' unexhausted womb, Spectres of horrid feature, hideous size, Or unimagin'd pow'r, inform the gloom With motion and effect, and cheat the hungry tomb. Here bat-like portents cleave the murky air, And flap with strident scream the leathern wing; Some, like the tyger rushing from his lair, Start from the dense profound with furious spring; Some in shrill tone their doleful dirges sing; Some with their iron fangs prepare for prey; Hiss the fell snakes; the rusty fetters ring; Groans the rack'd wretch his stubborn soul away; Or mid th' insatiate blaze half-figur'd goblins play. Oh for the sprig of sacred misletoe, Spell-breaking vervain, or as potent rue, To scare those imps malign who work me woe! Oh for nine drops of cold nocturnal dew, O'er my pale front with mutter'd sleight to strew! Aloof, in sullen apathy repos'd, Yon demon huge I dread, of deadliest hue: He rises ghastly, to my path oppos'd. Ah! close the fearful scene:—the fearful scene is clos'd. Now down the smooth declivity I float Of nether ether, to a shelter'd vale; Where, in its balmy bosom lodg'd remote, A bevy of bright beings I may hail. Hark! what sweet murmurs swell he musky gale, Whose honey'd whispers joy and gladness give; What tides of lusty health my lungs inhale; What florid flushes my blank cheeks receive; Here, in this happy dell, for ever would I live. Minions of moonlight, let my slow step steal, Unblam'd and guiltless, on your secret sport; Removing soft the visionary veil That wraps from vulgar ken the elfin-court, Where no unhallow'd visitants resort. Lo where the lords of Faery-land appear! Chieftains, and frowning peers of princely port; Sage counsellors, with piercing eye severe; And less distinguish'd knights fast trooping in the rear. The monarch's self majestic terrors grace: Tipp'd with a horse-fly's tongue, a rush his spear; A gnat's slight pinion shades his martial face; A fish's scale his armed shoulders wear, Lin'd with a scarf of shining gossamer; Unknown in listed fray the prize to yield, His rapier is a hornet's sting severe; Superior to the rest, his shelly shield Undauntedly he shakes, and overlooks the field. But, moving slow upon my dazzled sight, What miracle is this of loveliest charm? Luxuriate in unspeakable delight, I feel, I feel my shiv'ring senses warm: All my best feelings own the fond alarm: The courteous semblance becks me to her side: That beamy smile secures me from all harm: Her mandate I obey with pleasing pride: 'Tis she, the sylphid she, my late aerial bride. See the poem of the Extravaganza. “Full ill,” she cries “my pupil, has thine ear Receiv'd the moral lore I whilom taught; Though prodigal of fancy, who will hear Thy numbers vague, with no instruction fraught, And destitute of heav'n-descended thought? Though, slighting the severer rules of art, With choicest cunning is thy descant wrought, If thou to lull the sense neglect the heart, Trust me, advent'rous youth, we suddenly must part.” She spoke; conviction follow'd as she spoke: And though uncurb'd imagination scorn To bend submissive to the servile yoke, A temporary bondage must be borne. The flaunting wild rose decks the crabbed thorn: From surly rules sublimest labours grew. No more my stricter song must you adorn, Ye phantoms ever fair and ever new: Adieu, delightful dreams; ye faery scenes, adieu. SONNET TO SIR JAMES BLAND BUR'GES, With the following Romance. Again my spirit wakes from deep repose, Though deep not joyless; and each faery dream That Fancy on the pregnant trance bestows, Bids o'er the page in lasting beauty stream. But, ah! no dazzling glories shalt Thou find, Such as illume thy own consummate lay; No miracles of the effulgent mind To guide Thee through invention's milky-way: A shepherd's simple song; of ardent youth A rude narration, and of love sincere; Which Nature's mighty self, and virgin Truth, Instill'd erewhile into his raptur'd ear. Nor only shall it charm the village train, If Thou wilt deign to list so low a strain. Thomas Dermody. LOVE'S LEGEND: OR. ARIBERT AND ANGELA. A Romance, in Three Parts. Rien n'est beau que le vrai; le vrai seul est aimable: Il doit regner partout, et même dans la fable. De tout fiction l'adroit fausseté Ne tend qu' à faire briller aux yeux la vérité. Boileau. PART THE FIRST. Sad-swelling on the evening gale That moan'd along the purple heath, Was heard an infant's helpless wail, By him that pensive walk'd beneath. The shepherd turn'd in haste around; And as he turn'd, a beauteous child, Cradled in moss and wild flow'rs, found: The little mourner faintly smil'd. And as his charge the peasant eyed, Through the brown hawthorn's blossom'd shade, A burst that forc'd the boughs aside, Some stranger's guilty flight betray'd. Not far from thence, in peaceful state Ubaldo's ancient castle rose; Whose master's heart, and open gate, Did ne'er on weeping wanderer close. Thither the swain his treasure bore; And as he told, in simple guise, The mystic story o'er and o'er, Fond tears bedew'd the baron's eyes. Within his arms the babe he caught (Sweet babe, by heaven at once supplied!); And melting thus in tender thought, The venerable chieftain cry'd: “Fair offspring of a sire unknown, Pure snowdrop of the barren waste, Henceforth I mark thee as my own, For ever in my garden placed. “There, next to Angela, expand In artless pride thy balmy bloom; And foster'd by no sparing hand, Shed o'er my age a soft perfume.” Fly swift, ye years, on turtle-wing, Nor let one cloud obscure the skies; Fly swift o'er childhood's genial spring, And let youth's ardent summer rise. The years on turtle-wing are past, Nor did one cloud the skies obscure; Behold the fated pair, at last, In youthful sympathy mature! How often, Florizel, hast thou, Ere Dawn withdrew her dappled shade, Pluck'd from the mountain's thymy brow A wreath to grace the blushing maid! Or, when the am'rous marigold Shut its broad breast with closing day, How oft where moonlight, calm and cold, Threw its wan lustre, wouldst thou stray! Oft, where with silver foot unseen, Soft-sliding from her pebbly bed, Some naiad sleek through rushes green Th' insinuative current led; Didst thou her liquid lab'rinth trace, That stole adown the fairy dale; And pausing often in thy pace, List to the blackbird's mellow tale. But most by haunted copse's side, Romantic hill, or arbor trim, Where the vex'd rivulet seem'd to chide The lilies nodding o'er its brim, Thy flute was heard: hard by, enshrin'd A poplar's trembling leaves among, The night-bird, wailing to the wind, Married her sweet note to thy song. Thy song was Angela: and she In sooth deserv'd the fairest meed; For where a nobler theme could be, To suit the stop of shepherd's reed? Have you not seen the fragrant spot Where clust'ring cowslips sweetly blow? Such, ripe for love, and fancy-fraught, Her swelling bosom's lucid snow. Have you not seen the azure stream Kiss'd sportive by the sunny ray? So o'er her blue eye's bashful beam The golden ringlets wildly play. Blooms not a floret on the plain, Breathes not a violet-scented breeze, Could match her pure cheek's vermeil stain, Could like her honey'd accents please. And she was gentler still than fair: Pity could move her feeling mind, Soon as the filmy gossamer Moves lightly to the dallying wind. And merit never met her scorn, And modest worth her soul approv'd, And truth she priz'd though humbly born;— No wonder Florizel she lov'd. No titled birth had he to boast; Son of the desert, Fortune's child. Yet, not by frowning Fortune crost, The muses on his cradle smil'd. He joy'd to con the fabling page Of prowess'd chiefs, and deeds sublime; And e'en essay'd in infant age, Fond task! to weave the wizard rhyme. Whate'er romancer's magic skill Of wonderful or wild bestow'd, Since from Boiardo's fluent quill The long-continued fiction flow'd, He knew; and when some action brave Inspir'd the legendary lay, He sigh'd, and bless'd the laurell'd grave That held the hero's happier clay. The sunshine of the song alone As yet its influence could impart, And splendours from the poet thrown Rear'd seeds of honour in his heart. Nor e'er did he eschew the strain By genius hung on beauty's hearse, Which told the soft Provencal's pain When Vaucluse echo'd to his verse. 'Mid shadows brown he lov'd to roam Where Stillness held her lone retreat, Where ne'er the hermit's distant home Was visited by vagrant feet. Him at his supper oft he found, Of cates the ambient woods afford; And press'd with awe the holy ground, And joy'd to share the frugal board. Wherever misery appear'd A constant guest, the drop of woe That wet the beggar's silver beard He wip'd, and bade no more to flow. Nor did the knight disdain to heed Those workings of a noble soul: Nor bounteous act, nor social deed, Did e'er his stinted store controul. But by the charm of virtues rare, Congenial virtues, closely won, Scarce did the darling daughter share More favour than th' adopted son. PART THE SECOND. On either side the loom of life The fatal sisters take their seat: Obnoxious these, for mischief rife; Those friendly still, of aspect sweet. While these the sable tissue weave, And deeply stamp with many a tear, Those for the human victim grieve, And draw their threads of colour clear. Unconscious of the equal flame That Angela's chaste bosom fires, To muse upon that matchless dame, Lo, where sad Florizel retires! Where the pale vapour idly flits Athwart yon misty mountain grey, The melancholy mourner sits, And silent wastes the weary day. No sound disturbs the dread serene; No busy pinion cleaves the air; Save when, the blast's still pause between, Screams the wing'd herald of despair. 'Tis night's dead noon:—ye sprites benign Whom innocence ne'er calls in vain, Effulgent forms, in mercy shine, In mercy to your favour'd swain. I see him lift his manly arm: His manly arm confin'd I see. Has virtue then no secret charm? Ah! virtue has no charm for thee. A robber-band the youth surround: They mock his wild unweapon'd force: Furious they press him, strongly bound, And darkling bend their mystic course. And now the cavern's mouth they gain, Beneath the mountain's horrid brow: In haste they loose his clanking chain, And meek obedience greets him now. But who is he, of loftier port,— Of loftier port, but look severe,— Who lends the trembling youth support, And scarce withholds the starting tear? He waves the ruffians to retire; And while along his haggard cheeks Flashes a momentary fire, In smother'd sighs the bandit speaks: “By stealth, for many a year I've view'd Thy tender age to manhood grow; I've seen thee valiant, great and good, O anguish! with my deadliest foe. “That foe no longer shall be mine, And thou the just revenge shall aid. With filial force the bold design Effect, and slight yon witching maid. “Nay, stare not so. I cast thee forth: I left thee mid the forest wild. Noble in manners as in birth, O Aribert! thou art my child.” Who now can paint the light'ning-flush That mantled o'er the father's face? Or who the thousand pangs that rush On the son's soul, distinctly trace? Convuls'd with stupid woe he stands, As marble cold, as marble pale; While, wringing sore his palsied hands, The robber thus renews his tale: “Full many a withering blast has blown, Dire-beating on my fenceless head, Since, with misfortune savage grown, To those accurs'd compeers I fled. “Ubaldo's sire, by flase assign, Fell guardian, held yon wide domain In charge; which shortly shall be thine, But ne'er return'd his charge again. “Love was the fault; the purest love, With firmest constancy combin'd: O son! thy mother's worth approve: Thy mother's wrongs shall steel thy mind. “What though a village-virgin born, The inmate of the humble vale? Oft from the thicket's rudest thorn The wild rose scents the passing gale. “Ah early lost! Can I forget Thy placid smile of feign'd repose; Thy balmy kiss, attemp'ring sweet The poison'd chalice of my woes? “Can I forget that wint'ry night When, harsher than the thunder's tone, Sir Hugo sternly claim'd my right, And call'd yon hated tow'rs his own? “My Emma saw the rushing gloom, That soon my ruin'd fortune prest; Ah fairest flow'r of forest-bloom! She saw, and faded on my breast. “Mad with despair, this band I sought: Yon moon has heard the solemn vow. Let vengeance fire thy filial thought: What was I once? what am I now?” Here, as by speechless grief o'ercome, A while he paus'd with icy glare, Then fell; in mutual anguish dumb Stood Aribert, with horrent hair. Soon as relaps'd the vital tide, The sire, still threat'ning to be true, Conducted down the mountain's side His son, and vanish'd from his view. What was his terror, his surprise! A father found! a father lost! This one to save, the other dies, And all his fairy passion crost. “Not so—not so—he must not die, The widow's succour, orphan's aid; Nor shalt thou for a parent sigh, Dear Angela, devoted maid. “Not so—not so—thou must not moan A lover faithless and ingrate; There is a pow'r, when hope is gone, All hope, can overrule our fate. “Not so—not so—his guiltless hand With murder never shall be dyed: By strength unseen, a seraph-band Shall turn the thirsty sword aside.” Such were the agonies intense That his distracted bosom rent, As shuddering frore in every sense He homeward to the castle went. And now, amid the dusky steam, The modest morn peer'd o'er the hill; And, promis'd by a golden gleam, Larks hail'd the sun in carols shrill. PART THE THIRD. Loud howl'd the storm, no star appear'd, The lab'ring moon was seen no more; But oft, by fretful fits, was heard The distant torrent's angry roar; When, studious of his wayward doom, The wondrous orphan took his way (So chanc'd it) to the pictur'd room That in the southern gall'ry lay. Full many a grisly form he view'd Of warrior who in battle died, By painting clad in armour rude; Quaint casque, or morion's crested pride. But most one semblance caught his sight, Completely mail'd, of martial air; And much he eyed, with fond affright, A chief so formidably fair. When sudden, oped by secret springs, Portentous from the living frame, While hoarse the hollow casement rings, Completely mail'd the robber came; Robber no more: in silent wrath, The fearful calm of smother'd ire, He mutters, as he points the path: “Rise, recreant, and pursue thy sire.” Through the long gall'ry's winding maze, Down the steep stairs before unknown, He follows slow with dubious gaze, While the dun archway seems to groan. But what his horror, what his rage, (His horror great, his rage not less,) Led by Ubaldo's perjured page, When o'er the bridge throng'd foemen press! “And now is come the destin'd hour, And now my solemn vow is clear, And now not earth's collected pow'r Shall dare dispute my birthright here. “But still no dark assassin I, In sleep to deal the murd'rous wound. Small time will equal arms supply; Th' alarum ring, the bugle sound. “Thy mother's wrongs remember well: Remember too thy plighted word: Remember how thy father fell, And from that father take the sword.” And now the slumb'rers rush to fight; To fight they rush, nor know the cause; 'Till old Ubaldo's sacred sight Gives to each side a dreary pause. But soon as with the adverse host His Florizel the vet'ran spied, In many a keen emotion lost, “And thou, my son!” he feebly cried. “Not thine, nor of so vile a race; Not thine,” the robber-sire exclaim'd, Then rais'd the vizor from his face, Which fiery red with choler flam'd. Like some aerial shape meanwhile, Scar'd by th' unwonted din of arms, Gleaming along the gloomy aisle, Came Angela's dishevel'd charms. Th' enamour'd youth at once discern'd The silent censure of her frown; Quick from the hostile party turn'd, And threw his sword indignant down. Then cried, as down his pallid cheek Each other the big drops pursu'd: “Nature herself shall fail to break The bonds of love and gratitude.” While thus he spoke, with stedfast stare The baron mark'd the stranger-foe: A moment first, entranc'd in pray'r; The next, his tears began to flow. “O part'ner of my early prime! O deeply on my heart engrav'd! Forgive, forgive, my father's crime: It is, it is, thy son I sav'd. “Sir Hugo, on the bed of death, Stung by remorseful conscience sore, Did but these lands to me bequeath, To hold for thee or thine, in store. “Long have I sought the rightful heir; Long pray'd the pitying pow'rs divine To lift from me that load of care; But ne'er could hear of thee or thine. “Mysterious heav'n! the gloom is past; No more I'm torn, no more distrest; Thy child a waif upon the waste, That child I cherish'd in my breast. “And he is valiant, he is good; Of gentle carriage, generous heart; Methinks he's mingled with my blood: No, Aribert; we must not part. “One only gem on earth I prize, One gem which sure would deck a throne, Aught else I spurn beneath the skies; Belmont with Angela's thy own.”— “And what for me at length remains?”— “Ah! what,” rejoin'd the tortur'd sire, “Can blanch a robber's hideous stains? Water nor purifying fire. “Can I pollute these hallow'd dews, Fast-welling from th' eternal spring, Round the repentant couch t' effuse Which ministers of mercy bring? “Yet nigh yon chapel's ivied wall, Scoop me a solitary cell; There, by the cataract's foaming fall, In lonely penance will I dwell. “There, as my orisons I breathe, And drop with every bead a tear, To smooth the dark decline of death My Emma's image will appear. “Shall I not view that angel-frame, Dim gleaming on the brow of ev'n, When the west glows with faded flame, And tender twilight creeps o'er Heav'n? “Or when the moon, her empress fair, Sails slowly through a lambent cloud, Shall I not view her bosom bare Long whit'ning through its silver shroud? “Oh! yes; and woo her sainted shade, To plead the cause of erring love; And fondly claim her partial aid, To mediate for my sins above; “And pour the grateful rapture wild To Him who link'd in wedded joy Sweet Angela the baron's child, With Aribert the orphan-boy.” THE PURSUIT OF PATRONAGE. An Epistle. Et genus, et virtus, nisi cum re, vilior algâ est. Sense is the scorn of every wealthy fool, And wit in rags is turned to ridicule. Dryden Though lost for ever those delightful dreams That Fancy o'er the twilight-rapture streams; No more recluse, with pensive joy, to walk, Or hearken to the muse's whisper'd talk; No more to breathe the soul in witching rhyme, By wizard fount, deep dell, or hill sublime, What time the sere leaf quivers to the ground, And Silence sheds her solemn calm around, And Autumn's tawny hand with touch unseen Strips from the bending branch its garment green; And moaning sad through each unblossom'd spray, Shrieks shrill the awful genius of decay: Though doom'd, enchanting Poesy, no more High-charm'd to listen to thy warbled lore; But in oblivion's dusky pool to hide That flute, whilere my pleasure and my pride, With which so oft I woke the blushing day, The lark alone sweet rival of my lay: Yet the dire vengeance of immortal song Let genius thunder on the tasteless throng Who, basely girdled by a scoundrel-train, Eschew the minstrel, yet adore the strain; Lift at each line th' ecstatic-rolling eye, But leave the bard to languish and to die. For such there are, and such should surely feel The lasting pang of the poetic wheel; So shall they boast no more a borrow'd fame, Unjust usurpers of the patron's name. Distinguish'd name, by ancientry approv'd; Which Sidney cherished, and Southampton lov'd: One did a Spenser, one a Shakspeare raise, And gave and got inestimable praise. Ah thou, encompass'd with domestic pain, Who fondly hop'st to build the lofty strain; To weave the magic lay whose light and shade, Deep hues and dazzling colours, must not fade; Who mount'st Imagination's rainbow wing, Dipt in gay tin's of the Piërian spring; Ah! turn, and damp'd be thy enthusiast joy, To Chatterton, the muse's matchless boy; With every grace of ancient wisdom blest, All untaught genius breathing from his breast. Behold the haughty soul, o'er heav'n that flew, Submissive for a paltry pittance sue! Behold those lines that feed the general ear, Despis'd, discarded, by the listless peer! Behold (when vain each gentler plea to claim A little notice of that mighty name) In scorn too fierce, and disappointment dire, The wonder of the learned world expire!— Can studious zeal his rapid flights to trace, Or catch one meaning shadow of his face; Can admiration with its late applause, Or o'er each beauty the astonish'd pause; Alas! to soothe his lone enanguish'd ghost, In youth's proud dauntless prime for ever lost, Though my heart gushes o'er his piteous tale, Can e'en this honest verse of mine, avail? But shouldst thou more on elder proofs rely, Th' historic page shall wound thy injur'd eye. There still, in sad succession, they appear To check thy warmth, and start the tender tear. All chill'd his faery ecstacies divine With wayward cross, and penury, and pine; Sore shent by fickle Fortune's wintry blast, The pleasant sunshine of hope's summer past, And o'er his cote fell Eurus whistling frore; Lo! Mulla's minstrel on Juverna's shore. Spenser. Ah me! while foemen deal him grievous wrong, Full deftly he indites his dainty song; And though his tears may with his descant flow, Th' unconquerable mind still mocks at woe. Sweet bard! when ev'ning breathes a purer air, No boist'rous breeze their fleeting form to tear, Still round thy tomb the elfin bevies glide, Bath'd in the trembling moon-beam's yellow tide; Still in that ring their mystic feats renew, And crush the lurking worm, and kill th' unwhole-some dew. Compell'd by want to gild a graceless court, Where all was empty jest and idle sport; Where vice, with folly leagued, her revels held, And chas'd the bashful virtues from the field; See Dryden scatter his ambrosial hoard Of sacred incense o'er somebooby lord. Oh see, scintillant from his mental fire, Bright points of wit that sparkle and expire; Gross pond'rous dolts upbuoy'd in hasty odes, And British blockheads turn'd to Grecian gods! Yet what proud meed awaits the laureat's death; What pomp sepulchral, what distinguish'd wreath? By a lewd rake his sacred corse profan'd, For debt great Dryden's last sad rite's detain'd; When o'er his bier the widow'd plaint is heard, At length by common charity interr'd. Who, led by sweet Simplicity aside From pageants that we gaze at to deride, Has not, while wilder'd in the bow'ry grove, Oft sigh'd: “Come, live with me, and be my love”? Yet, oh! be love transform'd to deadly hate, As freezes memory at Marlow's fate: Disastrous bard! by too much passion warm'd, His fervid breast a menial beauty charm'd; Nor, vers'd in arts deceitful woman knows, Saw he the prospect of his future woes. Vain the soft plaint, that sordid breast to fire With warmth refin'd or elegant desire; Vain his melodious magic, to impart Affections foreign to th' unfeeling heart; In guardless ecstacy's delicious glow, He sinks beneath a vassal murd'rers blow. O'er his dread fate my kindred spirit stands Smit with commutual wound, and Pity wrings her hands. Ah! had some genial ray of bounty shone On talents that but lack'd its aid alone, Had some soft pennon of protection spread Its eider plumage o'er that hapless head, What emanations of the beauteous mind Had deck'd thy works, the marvel of mankind: Snatch'd from low-thoughted Care thy stooping soul, And plac'd thee radiant on Fame's deathless roll; Where still anneal'd, thy own unequall'd strain Shall crown'd by sensibility remain! Could Jonson's learned skill, or moral pow'r, Whose science rifled every Attic flow'r, Their honey-dews suck'd from all blooms that blow, And stripp'd of all its sweets Hymetus' brow; Could aught his wisdom or his worth obtain, Through many a year elaborately vain? In patient poverty his youth was past; And when slow favour ling'ring came at last, Life's sprightly vigour flown, enjoyment lost, Dear was the gift that so much labour cost. E'en polish'd Stanhope, when too late imprest With truth's resistless energy his breast, The proffer'd good his vanity supplied, Saw with a manly fortitude denied; Merit's proud modesty the kindness spurn'd, By venal flattery to be return'd. Quaint Humour's child, whose “colonelling” knight Grave Satire archly kens with new delight, Ingenious Butler, through thy various round Of promissory jilts, what friend was found? Though oft he conn'd thy volume laughter-fraught, Tickled by each inimitable thought, (Good easy man, with heedless glee he read,) Could e'en thy sovereign's purse afford thee bread? And Buckingham's loose conduct well may shew That wit to wit is oft its greatest foe. Oh! in our later era could I see One son of smiling Ridicule like thee, Still, keen correction leering in her eyes, Profuse of mirth, might sportive Censure rise; Drop soft elixir where she wounds the heart, And tickle with the plume that guides her dart. In a dark garret where the biting cold No cheerful hearth allays, poor Boyse behold! A blanket skewer'd his shiv'ring shoulder wears; Outrageous hunger at his vitals tears; Not one dry crust his tuneful toil requites; And e'en in famish'd misery he writes. Yet Fielding's candid judgment may sustain The doubted value of his lofty vein. Hark! what wild numbers break, sublimely sweet, The breathing stillness of this deep retreat? What bursts delirious of reviving song Steal on each sense, those gloomy cells among? 'Tis Smart; Anon the maniac minstrel raves, Loud as the tempest, fiercer than the waves; And now, attuning soft a gentler lay, Its tones, how musically! faint away. Of Taste's bright pleiads a distinguish'd star, Whose burnish'd glories still are beam'd afar, What fair resource did Loyd in grandeur meet, His earliest lustre sullied in the Fleet! With Churchill mark him at the social hoard: What charms they cull from reason's festive board! But all the pleasures of the feast remov'd, Which Hebe might have serv'd, and gods approv'd, All the soft solace of the banquet o'er, And (dire to pay) the long-protracted score, How shall their host the vent'rous heroes quit; Wit without money, money without wit: Till Phebus, muffled in the shaggy cloak Of bookseller, expound the knotty joke, Soothe the Cerberean landlord with a fee, Clear the tremendous bill, and set his fav'rites free? He who aspires to please this sapient age, And reap due profit too, must mount the stage. Yet brief indeed the actor's highest boast, His acmé in an hour attain'd or lost. A casual fall the firmest frame destroys: A curst catarrh obstructs the soundest voice.— Nor shouldst thou, Painting, too unjustly vain, Thy elder sister's nobler art disdain; Or join with powerful Music to dethrone Consummate worth, superior to your own. The symmetry exact, the touching grace Finely diffus'd o'er Action's form or face, The canvas with creative colour fir'd, The airs by hymning cherubim inspir'd, Fleeting and frail, are transitory all, Nor oft will Wisdom for their raptures call. But the bold song where, proud to vanquish time, Fond Poesy pours forth the kindling rhyme; In splendid rivalry where beauties meet, And shining order “Lucidus ordo.” Horace. marks the piece complete; Though envious chance consume the guardian page, Commission'd to inform each future age, Nor fire nor time ?“Nec ignis, Nec poterit ferrum, nec edax abolere vetustas.” Hor., with all their vengeance fraught, Impious, can hurt th' inviolable thought. Tradition's volubly-transmitting tongue Will catch the hallow'd numbers which she sung; Sires to their list'ning sons repeat them o'er, And spread the legend wide till language is no more. Who has not heard of Caravaggio's name? Illumin'd by the painter's purest flame, His graceful strokes delude the gazing eye, Glide to the heart, and Nature's self supply. On journey bent, his weary feet could find, Tatter'd and poor, no habitation kind; No unthatch'd hovel, no deserted shed, Where hapless genius might repose its head. At length a sordid inn where carters rest, And beggars vile, receives the gifted guest; Whose skill, employ'd to grace the gaudy sign, Must prove its best effort before he dine. And now the umber'd board before him stands, Pallet and pencil fill his forming hands; The mingling colours meet, and red and white (Each other's aid) harmoniously unite Till the full figures rise, and swell upon the sight. Sublime it swings aslant the public road: At morn the artist quits his mean abode. Meanwhile, by fortune led to pass that way, On neighing courser, with attendants gay, A critic wight came “pricking o'er the plain:” Right soon the sign-post doth his speed detain; With curious haste he views, and quick surprise, And for a sum immense the picture buys. Amaz'd with joy, th' unconscious master stares, Straight from his stall the saddled steed prepares, And, wing'd with hope, the stranger's path pursues:— But how the rest to tell, too tragic muse! By a ditch-side, in death his sorrowing eyes For ever seal'd, the slighted painter lies. Hence may be taught the young unpractis'd heart, That Gothic dullness chill'd each kindred art; And though the poet, much to public shame, Pre-eminence of penury may claim, Scarce less has barb'rous ignorance o'erlaid The mimic world by Dædal painting made. Oh! say what soul the muses deign to bless, In fawning phrase the servile song will dress; Drop the smooth balm from adulation's plume, And picture plenty on a miser's tomb? Yet some, by partial glimmer led astray Of sun-like inspiration's ardent day, On brainless sculls the blushing wreath have plac'd, Or giv'n a marquis sense, a nabob taste; Stuck a pert fidler next to Newton's bust, And rais'd a titled dolt on Milton's dust. So have I seen a strolling Romeo woo Some cookmaid, redolent of sav'ry stew; And pressing her coarse paw unwash'd and tann'd, Sigh, “the white wonder of my Juliet's hand!” For well, smooth Flatt'ry, can thy colours spread Youth's damask blushes with a warmer red; Uncrutch hoar eld; and make the shrivell'd cheek Blushy as Bacchus, as Adonis sleek. Let him who, desperately prone to eat The crumbs of patronage, would court the great, Consider well, to cool his scribbling rage, Thy apoplectic homily, Le Sage; Daub thick his dedication o'er with lies, And to the slippery heights of falsehood rise; Nor forfeit for uncivil truths his place, But glory in a gen'rous want of grace. In life's lone paths, and solitary glooms, How many a flow'r has spent its choicest blooms! Nipp'd in its bud by an untimely blight, By circling weeds all hid from public sight, Unknown its fragrance, beautiful in vain, And torn and trampled by the passing swain, No lordly son of wealth, no liberal fair, Pluck'd the lost gem to grace a garland rare; But spurn'd the simple chaplet nature yields, Cull'd from the produce of our British fields; While fam'd exotics, a vile sickly race, Find in the warmest beds unbounded space; There fade in state, fuliginously grim, And rot—the martyrs of capricious whim. Who, though on eagle-wing alert to soar, Scans thy sweet lay, disastrous Delacour? Who nervous Brooke's illuminated lines, Where all the patriot in Gustavus shines; Though splendidly obscure, the hero of the mines? Not nobler thoughts could Addison express, And Cato might assume the Swedish dress. O thou who mellowed'st first my artless note, To piety at once and verse devote: Who the rude depths of Dante hast explor'd; Yet Orpheus-like return'd, to light restor'd; And then didst follow, unappal'd by fear, Frantic Orlando in his mad career; Or, bosom'd in Ophelia's haunted vale, Of princely Eugene sung'st the wond'rous tale! O skill'd like Turpin, with sagacious eye To pierce the glorious rites of chivalry, And fill each chronicle's mysterious void! Pattern of modest worth, where art thou, Boyd? Though Fancy o'er my cradled vision smil'd, And fav'ring muses own'd their darling child; Though secret bliss, ineffably refin'd, Shed soft illusions o'er my melting mind; And her fantastic mirror Promise gave; E'en then Misfortune mark'd me for her slave; Dependance pointed to my lot forlorn, And mid the roses thrust a latent thorn. From youth's first dawn to manhood's riper day, What scenes have drawn my pilgrim-step astray: Deceitful scenes; in fairy-prospect bright, But dimm'd too often on the cheated sight! Ere yet grief's keenest shaft unerring sped, And Rapture wip'd the tear that Pity shed, What winning forms aye beck'd me to pursue Such shades as colder Prudence never knew; While, every fibre stretching e'en to pain, I commun'd with the beings of the brain! Late o'er my head I view the gathering cloud Of sorrow wrap me in its sablest shroud; Of life's machine the movements wear away, And those voluptuous fantasies decay. Yet still with undiminish'd smile remain Some silent conscious guests to soothe my pain: Still meek-ey'd Feeling bends, divinely mov'd, n social woe, o'er him the muses lov'd; Still Friendship from her healing store bestows A sov'reign cure each slighter scar to close; And fair Devotion, brightly fleeting by, Unbars new portals to a purer sky, Whence seraphs, leaning from th' angelic quire, Invite to sweep a more than mortal lyre. Be thine, my friend, with free facetious ease, And flashes of unpilfer'd mirth, to please; Whom Fortune fix'd, then learning first to feel, Just on the middle spoke of her inconstant wheel. Be ne'er thy page, to gull a guilty taste, By ribaldry's licentious trash disgrac'd; Be ne'er thy satire strew'd on virtue's bier, Nor yet the frown of vice in office fear; And still with honest apathy avoid That glut of wit where every palate's cloy'd; Where Malice harlequins in Humour's vest, And brother-fools stand gaping for the jest. Oh! would th' indulgent stars this hand allow To quit the barren pen, and grasp the plough; Cheerful to chaunt unmeditated lays, And see at eve the sprightly faggot blaze; Reckless of all the brilliant toys of state That win those babies, falsely styl'd the great; With friends select but few, the noisy town I'd fly for green retreats, and shadows brown; Shrink mid their vernal fold; and safe within, Despise th' abode of luxury and sin; Stretch'd by a winding streamlet's tiny tide, Forget majestic Thames's ocean-pride; Nor miss, where village-spires presume to rise, London's imperial top that wounds the skies. HYMN TO AUTUMN. Now when the sun with less enamour'd beam Lights the faint blushes of the fading year, Oh teach me, matron staid, To woo thy tender calm! For much I love the languish of thine eye, Luxurious stream'd o'er each congenial scene, That lends to all around A delicate repose: Whether thy evening-clouds their skirts unfold Of paler purple, through the forest-gloom Effusing partial streaks From their ethereal glow; Or the blue bosom of the tranquil lake, Where Silence sits amid the dusky steam, Scarce undulating, heaves Thy chasten'd smile beneath: Thy auburn locks with dewy woodbine drest; Ere yet the sere wreath withers on thy brow, Or brumal blasts deform Thy stole of sober green. Oft, mid the leafy wilderness of shade, Through its obscure recesses moaning deep, But yet without a wind, Conduct my devious step. Nor seldom let me catch the softer dash Of distant water, from some willowy sluice, Prone to its pebbled bed Bounding in faery fall; Or curfew's slumbrous swing from village-spire; Or hollow hum of whisp'ring voices near, Homeward returning late; Or watch-dog's sullen bay. Meanwhile the mellow swell of past'ral flute, May from her thicket lure the Attic bird, With one sad-closing strain To harmonize the whole. Then will the muse (the muse, thy handmaid fair), When all the hamlet's hush'd in silence sweet, Resume her solemn song, Her song of grateful praise: For, ever in thy rear is Genius seen, Inly conversing with himself; and then Contrasting with each sight, The creatures of the mind. Thine Wisdom too; and rapt Devotion thine, List'ning the sphery chime with pauseful ear; Sage Meditation still, And eagle-pinion'd Thought. While those too, brighter yet, that troop behind,— Content, blithe child of Labour well repaid, (Who laughing leads along Brown Harvest's buxom form, The poppy nodding mid her sheafy crest,) And Vintage flush'd with his own ruddy grape,— Complete thy festal train, Superior to assault; Well, loveliest Autumn, mayst thou mock the rage Of Winter, surly dotard, following fierce, With frozen breath malign To blight thy later blooms; Nor need'st thou yet the full voluptuous glare Of Summer envy, more divinely drest By Nature's liberal hand In plenitude and peace. GENIUS EXCUSED. Wounded by severest scorn, His fir'd soul flashing o'er his face, Mid the cheerless waste forlorn, Mark yon stripling's way ward pace: Often though he heaves a sigh, Inspiration's in his eye. Must the meanest lieir of gold Riot in sublime excess; And that bosom, never cold, No unenvied transport bless; He at best, degraded boy, Doom'd to steal a sickly joy? Could he sing the feats of wine, And never taste the purple stream? Could he paint the bliss divine, Nor beauty gild his glowing dream? Restriction hence! no pedant art Can match the science of the heart. When these sapient saws expire, And slumber with old sages past; When these frigid rules retire, Like autumn's leaf before the blast; When their memory is flown, Taste shall claim him for her own. “Often,” will tradition say, “Near yon spot of sacred green, When Twilight wav'd her banner grey, Did we note his museful mien; Now conversing with the air, Sunk anon in dumb despair. “Strew your vernal tribute round; Round your fading flowrets strew; Pity, consecrate the ground Where sleeps a breast to pity true: So shall Genius' humble grave Boast the honours once he gave.” TWO ELEGIAC ODES, TO THE MEMORY OF SIR RALPH ABERCROMBIE. FIRST ODE. Where is the British Genius fled? Where is the British Genius fled? Why starts not the poetic tear That erst embalm'd the mighty dead, Soft streaming o'er the warrior's bier? Her languid lid too long is dry; Fell grief has froze her beamless eye; Or sure ere this that lucid drop should flow To wail her favour'd son, and swell the general woe. Waked from her melancholy trance, 'Tis she! the fair aerial form I see with solemn step advance, Bright as the bow that girds the storm: Yet sorrow dims the sickly grace Faint-smiling on her faded face; While, as she braids the ever-during wreath, Pauseful she heaves a sigh o'er conquest dash'd with death. The song begin! my bosom glows: Her dawning influence I feel: The sweet elixir she bestows, A nation's recent wound shall heal. For, oh! methinks each gen'rous heart Throbb'd with participated smart, When Vengeance taught the murd'rous ball to fly, And Vict'ry dubious mark'd the veteran's bleeding thigh. Lo! on yon column's Called by some historians the column of Severus. peak sublime She sits, and folds her purple wing; While, nook'd beneath, malignant Time Aloof his scythe is forc'd to fling: Now, half a native of the skies, Where her undaunted hero dies, Whilere luxurious Antony repos'd, And in a harlot's arms long scenes of glory clos'd. But who is he of sterner brow, Emerg'd from central caves of night, Whose ghostly features seem to glow, And kindle at the furious fight? His dull eye darts a transient gleam; Scarce rous'd from his elysian dream, The well-known British bands he views, dismay'd, 'Tis Julius Julius Cesar.! 'tis himself, the great dictator's shade. Not so, illustrious chief, they fought When erst thou trod'st their savage shore; And thou didst wave, in boundless thought, Thine eagle-flag whole nations o'er. Say, could thy Roman cohort face Yon fearless band of Scotia's race? The 42d regiment of foot, always conspicuous for bravery and resolution. Could brazen buckler, or protended spear, Sustain the missile fire, and bayonet's shock severe? Soon would the temper'd faulchion shear The gorgeous plumage of thy crest, And soon the horseman's dread career Pierce thy firm phalanx' shielded breast; Not even the prudence once that bore Thee safe from Alexandria's shore, When learning shrunk amid the impious blaze, Cesar having fired the arsenal of Alexandria, a great part of the Ptolomean library was consumed by the flames. By a wonderful presence of mind, being forced to retreat, he effected his escape in safety; for instead of stopping at his own ship, which sunk soon after with the multitude of fugitives (being next the port), he with difficulty swam to the vessel furthest off at sea, and thereby preserved his life. Could aught avail thee now, in Britain's brighter days. For him, this day who glorious fell, Yon boastful catacombs Adjoining to the suburbs of the ancient city of Necropolis. were vain, Within whose each sepulchral cell Proud Egypt's meaner lords remain. Nought to his consecrated dust Can sculptur'd pile, or pompous bust, Or even the huge mausoleum, lend of fame: A nobler homage waits to signalize his name. The mistress of the world behold, Whose thunders awe the vassal deep, With fervour clasp his hallow'd mold, And press it to her trembling lip. Can fragile granite, heap'd with care, High-tow'ring in the sultry air, Or almost-animated marble, give So long his gallant deeds and genuine worth to live? Britannia, eminently blest, Whose alabaster rocks repel Each ruder surge that wooes thy breast, Enamour'd with insidious swell; Though One to honour has been paid, Let no dull care thy peace invade; Be not that front's majestic menace lost, Ev'n now whose fateful bend should scare yon envious coast. France, then idly meditating an invasion. Thine is a Hutchinson, whose mind Each amiable classic grace, Each gentler art, each sense refin'd, And martial skill, well pleas'd embrace. Nor deem that Wisdom's serious school But tends the soldier's warmth to cool: Hers to correct rash youth's impetuous pow'r; Lo! Scipio's helmet bent beneath the muse's bow'r. His bosom to each danger bare; A manly spirit unsubdu'd, Before whose path the fiend Despair Flies far with her funereal brood; In battles nurs'd, whose infant age Was rock'd by the rough tempest's rage; Prompt to suggest and act each bold design, Old ocean's richest gem, a dauntless Smith Sir Sidney Smith. is thine. Superior as thou art, disdain Each fruitless vaunt of foreign hate, O'er the illimitable main Fix'd by the sov'reign voice of Fate. How fare the desp'rate foes who ween To interrupt thy naval reign, How far thy sailor-sons the world excel, Yet writhing from her wounds let Scandinavia Alluding to the then last famous sea-engagement, off Copenhagen. tell. Meseems, where stretch'd in proud repose Tall Greenwich overlooks the tide; Fond its broad beauties to disclose, And view them with reflected pride; I hear the hardy seaman's tale, That turns his simple audience pale; He points each scar, and with a conscious smile Thanks his kind stars he saw the hero of the Nile. So, to his long-lost hut return'd, Cheer'd by his offspring's lisping voice, Whom long as dead they hopeless mourn'd, The war-worn soldier shall rejoice; And as his faithful breast he shews Sore-gash'd by unrelenting foes, Think on his many younger comrades slain, Uplift th' expressive eye, and quite forget his pain. Then will he ev'ry scene retrace Where panting Slaughter led the fray, His fir'd soul flushing o'er his face With thoughts of that important day. O consul! Buonaparte. rapt in visions wild, In vain and falsely hast thou styl'd Invincible the standard which they bear: Thy chosen host perceive gaunt Ruin in their rear. Hence learn, 'tis not the prowess'd might Of man, the contest can decide; Severely walking 'mid the fight, A heav'nly champion mocks thy pride. He withers the presumptuous arm; He nerves the weak with powerful charm; Then, striding the fell cannon's sulph'rous flame, Directs the wasteful shot, and triumphs in thy shame. “Here Moore th' intrepid legion led,” The kindling invalid will cry, Here Oakes and daring Paget bled, Determin'd honour in each eye; “Here Hope, regardless of his maim, Pursn'd the sanguine step of fame; And here, slow life long-welling from his wound, Unalterably brave was Abercrombie found.” Nor mortal anguish could o'ercast, Nor languor stoop, his stately mien; 'Till the victorious charge was past, Still mounted, dreadfully serene. Then, as the last explosion fir'd, The last drop from his heart retir'd; And, Sense forsaking her accustom'd seat, Well satisfied he own'd the glorious work complete. While Malta, 'mid her knights renown'd, Receives one nobler stranger more, With less untainted laurels crown'd Than e'er her best defender bore; Say, will his grateful country raise No public tribute to his praise? No lasting monument for years to come; Such as old Athens gave, or more exalted Rome? Oh, yes! where to the warrior-saint St. Paul. Yon temple's shapely pillars rise, In chisel'd flint, or breathing paint, His martial front shall glad our eyes. Though Superstition's frown austere May gloom to mark a soldier there, Religion will adopt with purer grace One memorable chief than all the monkish race. Nor here his bounded honours end:— See royal Fred'rick's The Duke of York. downcast eye Confess the tutor and the friend, Such loss unable to supply. Copartner in each dire campaign That ravag'd Flandria's fatal plain, One gen'rous tear he drops, to merit due: So wept Ulysses' son when Mentor's form withdrew. His learned youth divinely fed With honey from the Attie hive, See princely Moira droop the head, To every finer pang alive; In camp or court alike decreed By wit or valour to succeed, Yet still from courtly adulation free, Unbiass'd by applause, a second Sydney he. Sir Philip Sydney, the patron of Spenser. When the last echo of the song Decays on Time's impassive ear, (As some lone abbey's vaults among, We oft th' imperfect whisper hear,) Ev'n then will virtue's self descend, The dusty veil of darkness rend; And where thy mutilated statue lies, Direct congenial minds,—the brave, the good, the wise. SECOND ODE. Let no unmanly plaint presume Let no unmanly plaint presume To vex the manes of the brave, No fond tear taint the laureat bloom That waves upon the warrior's grave. The softness of a sighing verse May breathe o'er some inglorious hearse Plum'd with the idle pomp of pride; But Fame herself anneals in blood The records of the great and good Who boldly for a nation died. Hush'd be each weaker voice of woe; The hoarse drum's military sound; The solemn ordnance, pealing slow.— The martial horse, with trophies crown'd, And marching in sad state along, With downcast look the soldier-throng, Shall more the hero's worth declare Than aught the weeping muse could bring; Though Rapture, soothing cold Despair, Should smite the animated string. Oh! as the mourning car triumphant moves To lodge thy chieftain with the mighty dead, Britannia, whom th' unwilling world approves, Yet, yet sublimer lift thine aweful head. Let no dim cloud obscure thy radiant brow: For still unnumber'd godlike sons remain, To bid each foreign host before thee bow, And scatter to the winds their tinsel train; To sweep the envious spoiler far away From thy imperial breast, and vindicate thy sway. Blest isle! the forest oak is thine, And thine the iron-hearted steed: Still foremost in th' embattled line, Thy dauntless offspring dare to bleed; Of hardy frame, and generous soul, Whom no degrading fears control, Nor less for milder graces known; The liberal thought, the melting mind, By sweet humanity refin'd, And beauteous arts, are all thy own. While at the helm an Addington presides, Protects thy commerce, and to glory guides. When fiercest the hot contest glows, What alien courage shall oppose The bulwark of a British breast? The steady fires that flash around, And yon deep groan's expiring sound, Its genuine fortitude attest. Behold th' intrepid column charge the foe! Hark the harsh closure of the strident steel! Exanimate they fly the furious blow; Before its ruthless shock their forces reel; 'Till from thick mists emerging to the sight, Gigantic Slaughter glares, then faints amid the fight. O thou for whom the song I raise, Ambitious to bestow my praise! What ardours warm'd thy vet'ran-frame, Though pierc'd with many a wound severe, When, cloth'd in wide-consuming flame, Thy little wond'rous band pursued The gallic vultures by their track of blood, And thunder'd desolation on their rear! Then far was every selfish thought Of life with loss of honour bought; Then every tie that holds the heart, For ever doom'd from home to part, Was lost to thy collected breast, By patriot-zeal alone possest. Caution, determinately cool, Maintain'd her calm unalter'd rule, And taught the conflict where to rage; While bright Victoria, hov'ring nigh, Her keen glance fix'd upon thy bleeding thigh, Scarce more admir'd the soldier than the sage. Though now, ev'n now, illustrious shade, Yet recent from the memorable fray, In blissful bow'rs, unconscious of decay, Thy wearied limbs at length are laid; And thronging round, an airy swarm, Heroic spectres eye thy form; Proud names, of history the splendid boast, Solicitous who shall applaud thee most; Oh! see the gallant youth thy genius led O'er Flandria's well disputed plain, See princely Frederick droop the head With all a pupil's tender pain; Oh! yet, great soul, deliberately wise, Temper his daring heat, and fit him for the skies. Meanwhile, each meed thy country can bestow, Dissolv'd in universal woe, Shall flourish o'er thy sacred dust; The pile sepulchral, and the votive bust: But most a pious monarch's grateful tear Proclaim thy fortunate rememb'rance dear, Dear to himself and to his people too; For ev'ry pompous rite of rev'rence past, That tribute to long faithful service due, In other chiefs thy virtue shall renew, And still in emulous succession last. So the poetic branch, renown'd of old For glitt'ring leaves, and balls of blooming gold, Though torn, appear'd before the Trojan's eyes Still fresh with shining foliage to arise; Uno avulso non deficit alter. Virgil. Unchang'd the value of its precious frame, Its radiant hue unchang'd, another and the same. THE BROWN BEAUTY. While flushing o'er thy olive cheek, Like the morning's dubious break, Virgin shame delights to spread Her roses of a deeper red; And those ruddy lips of thine Emulate the bleeding vine; Think'st thou Celia's languid white Can allure my roving sight, Or my bosom catch a glow From that chilling form of snow? In those orbs, O nymph divine! Stars may well be said to shine, Stars whose pointed rays are made More brilliant by surrounding shade; Shade thy raven-locks supply To relieve my dazzled eye. Trust me, thy transcendant face Takes from its brown a mellower grace; A ripe autumnal bloom benign, Whence all the Loves exulting shine; As jet emits a glossy light, From its polish'd surface bright. EPIGRAMS. THE PRETTY VIXEN. When foam'd the dashing waves, and winds were high, From ocean surely, Venus-like, you sprung; For I can bear the lightning of your eye, But who can bear the thunder of your tongue? ANOTHER, TO THE SAME. With angel face, and faultless form, How strange that you're not to my liking! Yet, when you cuff your spouse, and storm, I own your beauty vastly striking. AN IMITATION OF MARTIAL. My patron lives next street; but, for assistance, We might as well live fourscore miles at distance. SONG. [Sweet is the woodbine's fragrant twine] Sweet is the woodbine's fragrant twine; Sweet the ripe burthen of the vine; The pea-bloom sweet, that scents the air; The rose-bud sweet beyond compare; Sweet the perfume of yonder grove; Sweeter the lip of her I love. Soft the rich meadow's velvet green, Where cowslip-tufts are early seen; Soft the young cygnet's snowy breast, Or down that lines the linnet's nest; Soft the smooth plumage of the dove; Softer the breast of her I love. Bright is the star that opes the day; Bright the mid-noon's refulgent ray; Bright on yon hill the sunny beam; Bright the blue mirror of the stream; Bright the gay twinkling fires above; Brighter the eye of her I love. To match her grace, with idle pain Through Nature's stores I search in vain; All that is bright, and soft, and sweet, Does in her form concenter'd meet: Then, muse, how weak thy pow'r must prove To paint the charms of her I love! ANOTHER. [When I sat by my fair, and she tremblingly told] When I sat by my fair, and she tremblingly told The soft wishes and doubts of her heart, How quickly old Time then delightfully roll'd, For Love lent the plume from his dart! From the blush of her cheek how my bosom caught flame, And her eyes spoke a fondness her lips would not name! But her cheek that once rival'd the summer's full rose, Now as April's sad primrose is pale; In her eye now no bright sensibility glows, Though I breathe forth truth's rapturous tale. And thy moments, old Time, that on downy feet fled, Ah me! are now fetter'd, and weighty with lead. Yet surely, though much of her passion is past, Some sparks of affection remain; And the clouds that her meek-beaming brow have o'ercast, May be melted in pity's soft rain; If not, my wrung breast to distraction I bare, For distraction itself is less hard than despair. THE CORN-DOCTOR: A TALE. Some forty miles from London town, The wonder of each hyppish clown Who with the nerves of Hercules Fancied his carcase ill at ease, A German quack, whose brickdust pill Could purge or vomit, cure or kill, With impudence much more prevailing Than all the nostrums of old Galen, Struck up his stage, a sort of trap Slily to catch each nibbling chap Who wish'd to bite; and seem'd most fully Resolv'd to rout that swagg'ring bully, Death, who time out of mind has got A licence to send folks to pot; Who many a madcap hero slew, And many a perilous doctor too; Daily by curst diseases stuffing Devoutly his huge patent coffin.— Plague on digression! This same wight Determin'd to undo him quite; But most he bid him bold defiance In one particular branch of science, One curious point. “What branch? what point? In toe or finger, or what joint?” Zounds, gentlemen, don't fear your horns; Only in simply cutting—corns. As for the sprouts, your wives' creation, Heav'n shield them all from amputation; I care not, lemans, if they grow High as the horns of Jericho. The great, I'm told, enraptur'd swear Antlers are very pretty wear; You say, mesdames, they're quite becoming: Well, be it so, and hang all humming. Though in the head we chance to fail, Allons! let's hasten to the tale. This valiant quack then, one fair-day, Declaiming in his usual way, Strutted, took snuff, look'd wondrous big In all the learned pomp of wig; Vaunted what kingly toes he'd shorn, And read long lectures on “de corne.” A farmer, who to market brought Much grain, but had not touch'd a groat, Thought this a fellow to his mind, As he no other chap could find; One who would buy his stock entire, And pay him to his heart's desire; So (would his numscull had been thinner!) Courteous invites him home to dinner; Hinting he'd something in his way, And begs the doctor won't delay. Well; dinner's done; the cloth remov'd; Each drank the toast to what he lov'd; When thus the quack accosts him gaily: “Pray, sare, where mostly do your ail lie?”— “Sir,” quoth the clown, in manner ample, “To satisfy, I'll fetch a sample Of last year's crop.”—“Py cot, I'll crop 'em,” Exclaims the quack, alert to stop him; “I'll take 'em, root and pranch, mynheer”.— “Sir, you know corn is very dear; But if you please to take the whole, You'll have a bargain, 'pon my soul.”— “De whole? Aye, aye; de whole, by Got; I'll whip de whole out like a shot.” So saying, while he drew his knife out (Enough to fright a poor man's life out), Right soon he rais'd him on his rump, And seiz'd the wond'ring farmer's stump: Then, without further disquisition, On his big toe began incision; And would have driven the weapon further, Had not his patient roar'd out, Murther! “My got, vat morther? Pye ant pye, Your toe pe vite as your von eye; I put just touche upon the pone:— Dare now, you see de job is done.” Clodpole exclaims: “You rogue, what job? Fly, skip, or I shall crack your nob. With your confounded scalping-knife, You dog, you've crippled me for life; When I thought luck and cash were stirring, You've ta'en my corn off with a murrain.” MY OWN CHARACTER. TO A LADY. This once I will alter my old-fashioned style, For the rosy reward of a sensible smile; And betray the wild sketches of passion, imprest By Nature's own seal on that tablet my breast: Which too oft, as 'tis sway'd by the whim of the brain, A rude chaos of blunder is forc'd to contain; Projections absurd, prepossessions unjust, Though Friendship has still found it true to her trust; And it still, when such blots are expung'd, may be fit For the splendour of sense, or the sparkle of wit. Then first, I confess, lest you kindly mistake, I'm a compound extreme of the sage and the rake: Abstracted, licentious, affected, heroic; A poet, a soldier, a coxcomb, a stoic: This moment, abstemious as faquir or bramin; The next, Aristippus-like, swinishly cramming; Now full of devotion, and loyal dispute; A democrat now, and a deist to boot: Now a frown on my front, and a leer in my eye; Now heaving unfeign'd sensibility's sigh: Now weighing with care each elaborate word; Now the jest of a tavern, as drunk as a lord: By imminent woes now unmov'd as a stone; And now tenderly thrill'd by a grief not my own. Of love shall I speak, who my bosom still bare To the arrows discharg'd from the glance of the fair? A target whose verge many shafts may receive; But whose centre as yet is untouch'd, I believe; For who to one damsel could meanly confine That heart which is ever devoted to nine? Shall I speak of politeness? Ah! there I am mute; For though honest in thought, I'm in manners—a brute. My virtues indeed are too shy to be seen; Though my follies are not quite so bashful, I ween. Not ev'n to a lady a fine thing I say; As blunt as the hero of Wycherly's play: Though ladies, good faith, have been never my game, For I guess the whole sex are in secret the same. Smooth flatt'ry may lift the dear nymph to the sky, But her feelings will certainly give it the lie; And in cases which I, and most probably you know, She would rather be Jane than Diana or Juno. Shall I make to grave dowager Prudence a claim? Alas! I have slighted her much, to my shame; Secur'd no snug office, scrap'd up no estate, Nay, scarce own a garret to shelter my pate; So have nought to consign, when I've finish'd my mirth, But my book to the critics, my body to earth. Through life's checquer'd changes, in every state, Hypocrisy always has met with my hate. Should you seek, in my mere conversation to find Any sprightly conceits that illumine my mind, Your search will be vain; for I candidly vow, I can ne'er make a compliment, seldom a bow: Yet when Venus appears at gay Bacchus's call, I can coax her with any one blood of them all. Though youth's florid blush on my cheek is decay'd (Such blooms will soon wither in study's pale shade), Remembrance still pensively hangs on each scene That rais'd the sweet raptures of careless nineteen: Then, to transport's fine touch every pulse was alive; Now, I droop in the year of my age—twenty-five! “This,” you'll instantly cry, “is a wonderful thing.” But my summer of genius arriv'd ere its spring. The orange-tree thus prematurely, we're told, Bears its blossoms of green, and its fruitage of gold; And these talents of mine, now entirely forgotten, Like the medlar, soon ripe, were, I fear, as soon rotten. CICERO AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS DAUGHTER. Written on a blank leaf of his Epistles. Is this the consul whose electric look, And vocal thunder, the wide senate shook; Flash'd from that tearful eye the flame divine That rent the stubborn soul of Catiline? Ah! could those silent, trembling lips, impart Conviction, Clodius, to thy guilty heart? Or Antony, of half the world possest, Feel their sweet venom rankling in his breast? 'Tis he; but ah, how chang'd! The laureat bow'r No more relieves his solitary hour; Philosophy, with ardent eye, no more Drops on his bosom'd wound her balmy lore; Bland Tusculum itself can now bestow No shaded shelter from resistless woe. His Tullia's name the murm'ring echoes breathe; In every breeze is heard the wail of death; And, wringing sore his desolated hands, The poor, forlorn, dejected father stands; Whose plaint not rolling ages can consume, Superior to the wreck of boastful Rome. THE DREAM. Fly, airy envoy of delight, To my Anthemoë's pillow fly; Press her pure forehead's veiny white, Or flutter in her closing eye. Oh! softly wave thy downy wing, Lest thou too rudely break her rest; Thy opiate dews, oh! gently fling, For Peace resides within her breast. And shouldst thou deign to hear my pray'r, A lover's pray'r devoutly warm, Bid the pale shadow of Despair Each night assume my faded form. With visionary pencil paint The downcast look of hopeless woe; Drooping, disconsolately faint, O'er murder'd hope's expiring glow. Fix on my cheeks th' eternal tear, And banish far each soothing smile; Let that dull blank no dimple wear, Unceasing anguish to beguile. Like the sere leaf on Autumn's brow, Let thy dark tint embrown my face; My furrow'd front let sickness plough, And crush each bloom of youthful grace. So shall thy powerful spell pourtray The secret torture of my mind; And sorrow only seen by day, Still in thy shape remain behind. A FRAGMENT OF PETRONIUS ARBITER. IMITATED. Omnia quæ miseras possunt finire querelas, In promptu voluit candidus esse Deus: Vile olus, et duris hærentia mora rubetis, Pugnantis stomachi composuere famem. Flumine vicino stultus sitit; et riget Euro, Cum calidus tepido consonat igne rogus. Lex armata sedet circum fera limina nuptæ, Nil metuit licito fusa puella toro. Quod satiare potest, dives natura ministrat; Quod docet infrænis gloria, fine caret. What Nature needs, would wretched man be wise, Nature herself commodiously supplies. The vilest herb keen hunger will not scorn, Nor slight the berry blushing on the thorn. Lo! he complains of thirst with fainting sigh, Though elemental nectar murmurs nigh; Or shivers in the biting northern wind, Though a whole crackling forest flames behind, Perpetual horrors haunt his jealous head, Yet willing beauties wooe him to their bed. Abundant nature hears the frugal call, But wild ambition is in want of all. REPARATION. Shame on the sullen soul that for one fault, One tender fault, will slight the taintless mind! Still, Zelia, thou'rt a vestal in thy thought; And Love, as he is pictur'd, should be blind. Then wipe, my dear, those dewy eyes of thine, That, like a dying dove's, are turn'd on me: Mine was the rapture; all the sin be mine, If thou from sorrow and from sin art free. Though cruel custom mar the wanderer's rest, And thy sweet beauty ill such scorn can bear, Love, gentlest monitor, unlocks this breast, And fondly welcomes his old mistress there. Let malice rail, let scandal be thy foe: But sure that heav'n which drest thee in delight, Will spare its erring masterpiece; for know, Hadst thou no stain thou wert an angel quite. SONG, TRANSLATED FROM THE PERSIAN. From love, and from the flowing bowl, Those dear delights that cheer my soul, I've vow'd full often to abstain; I've vow'd, but all my vows are vain. The bowers where black-ey'd houris rove, Shades in celestial sweets that rise, Or ev'n the paradisial grove, Less than her humble dome I prize. Angels ne'er feel, old records say, Of mighty love the blissful sway: Be love to me, mere mortal, giv'n, To angels I resign their heav'n. Still, when I breathe the pious pray'r, That intervening form I view; And turn'd idolater, my fair, To thee alone I deem it due. Stint not the grape's nectareous juice, Nor yet the charms of love refuse: Too soon will Time his sabre bare, And Death was never known to spare. Then tell not me of cloister pale, Or college where dull pedants pine; Gladlier the tavern-door I hail, Where brighter smiles the rosy wine. Soft Zephyr, whisper, as you pass The window where she's wont to be: “Sober, or o'er the sparkling glass, Hafiz still fondly thinks on thee.” EPIGRAM, FROM MARTIAL. Mentitur qui te vitiosum, Zoile, dixit. Non vitiosus homo es, Zoile, sed vitium. He lied who call'd thee, Ned, a vicious elf: Thou art not vicious—thou art vice itself. ELEGIAC EXPOSTULATION TO AN UNFORTUNATE TAYLOR. O thou whose visionary bills unpaid, Long as thy measure, o'er my slumber stream; Whose goose, hot-hissing through the midnight shade, Disturbs the transport of each softer dream! Why do imaginary needles wound? Why do thy sheers clip short my fleeting joys? Ah! why, emerging from thy hell profound, The ghost of shreds and patches awful rise? Once more look up, nor droop thy hanging head; The liberal linings of that breast unfold; Be smiles, far brighter than thy buttons, spread; And nobly scorn the vulgar lust of gold. Though doom'd by fortune, since remotest time, No meaner coin of moderate date to use, Lo! I can well reward with sterling rhyme, Stamp'd by the sacred mintage of the muse. Why mourn thy folly, why deplore thy fate, Why call on ev'ry Power in sore dismay? Thy warmest orisons, alas! are late: Reflect—didst thou e'er know a poet pay? Vain from thy shopboard the eternal sigh; Can guineas from the vacant pocket fly? Can sorrow fill this empty purse of mine? Ah me! so long with dire consumption pin'd, When shall that purse ill-omen'd proudly swell Full as the sail that holds the fav'ring wind? Mysterious ministers of Money, tell. Fond man! while pausing o'er that gloomy page That tells thee what thou art in terms too plain, O'er the capacious ledger lo e thy rage, Nor of unsettled debts again be vain. There lords, and dukes, and mighty princes lic, Nor on them canst thou for prompt payment call. Why starts the big drop in thine anguish'd eye? One honest genuine bard is worth them all. A common garment such as mortals wear (Dull sons of clay, the ready price who give,) Thou mad'st, and lo! it lasted one short year; But in my garment thou shalt ever live. Time ne'er shall rip one consecrated seam Of cloth, from Fancy's loom all superfine; Nor shall I cruel haunt thy softer dream, E'en when I dress thee in a suit divine. Let sage philosophy thy soul inform With strength heroic every ill to bear: Not better broad-cloth braves the angry storm, And constant patience is delightful wear. Be patient then, and wise, nor meanly shrink Beneath Despondency's tumultuous blast: The reck'ning-day may come when least you think, A joyful day, though miracles are past. CARROL'S COMPLAINT. Where Antrim's giant-pillars rise Abrupt, to prop th' incumbent skies, And fling their frowning shadows o'er the flood; Wild with woe his frenzied air, His big breast to the tempest bare, Smit with his country's wounds indignant Carrol stood. Responsive to his tuneful lore, Juverna's ancient harp he bore. Holy harp, whose witching numbers Lapp'd the soul in heavenly slumber, Bade youth's impassion'd bosom bleed, Or wak'd the gen'rous mind to high heroic deed! Thou, a sea-nymph once, couldst skim Gentle ocean's burnish'd brim; Once through coral groves couldst stray, And with the dimpling eddies play; 'Till chang'd by fate, to sooth that shore With song, which thou didst wash before, Thy pristine form reversely twin'd, Thy silvery shoulders stretch'd behind, Lo! still th' uninjur'd mermaid-shape remains; Save that thy copious locks afford To music each appropriate chord, Nor Sol's bright tresses pour'd superior strains. With tutor'd fingers, taught to fly Through ev'ry maze of harmony, The bard (erewhile whose magic measures Steep'd the tearful lid in pleasures, And grac'd the storied hall of chieftains and of kings) Thus swept with sorrowing agony the strings: “Doom'd to perish, hapless coast, Never more thy birthright boast; Purchas'd with thy flowing gore, Independance boast no more. The native fragrance of thy fields, The stores thine every valley yields, Plains where Learning's pilgrim-feet First could find a safe retreat; Plains where nought empoison'd dwells, Whilom purg'd by saintly spells, Basely sold and ever lost; Henceforth shall glut a rav'ning host. Fiends of slaughter, say if yet Martyr'd peace be in your debt; Not enough of carnage, say; So insatiate still to slay. Flesh'd in death, inhuman, tell How many a guiltless victim fell. Has not oft the filial sword The father's wither'd breast explor'd? Has not oft the infant's scream, Mid the fir'd hut's midnight gleam; Has not oft the virgin's shriek, Doubly dyed in blood her cheek; Has not oft the matron's cry, Her sons, her husband, groaning nigh; Wrung and torn my bursting soul?— Mark a part, not blast the whole. The wily knave who leads astray The peasant tribe, an easy prey; The fool by mad ambition led, And idle praise, to risk his head; The bold-fac'd thief, th' assassin dark; Unmov'd, for instant vengeance mark: Carrol's self will dig their grave:— But spare the innocent, the brave. HYMN TO BEAUTY. Mistress of magic wiles, whose humid glance, Transparent bloom, and soft celestial air, So oft my breast have steep'd in heav'nly trance, And chas'd with rosy smile delighted care; Still let thy charming agonies invade; Thy panting pleasure, thy voluptuous pain. Still let me clasp thy semblance in the shade, Oh! still enrol me with thy laughing train. O'er Plato's sapient thought 'twas thou didst stream Visions of joy and philosophic bliss; And sweetest still has been the poet's dream, Nectareous flavour'd by a fragrant kiss. Whence doth bright Painting cull her graceful line, Her glowing tints, her captivating dyes; And whence the poet form his fair design; But from th' inspiring lustre of thine eyes? Those heaving hillocks where twin-strawb'ries grow, Though flutt'ring Loves the blissful confines keep, Insatiate let me print their yielding snow, And press the pouting cherry on thy lip. Askance pale Care, a wither'd crone, may view Envious the glowing fold he can't enjoy; But still to youth and youthful passion true, Be mine the transport prudence would destroy. MORE WONDERS! AN HEROIC EPISTLE TO M. G. LEWIS, Esq. M. P. “The times have been, That when the brains were out the man would die, And there an end; but now they rise again, With twenty mortal murders on their crowns, To push us from our stools.” Shakspeare. Yet once more, O thou muse whose bold dispatch Could raise an Iliad from a bruising-match, Alluding to the Battle of the Bards, which the reader will find at the beginning of the second volume. Bid Gifford, Ward, and Wolcot, Belcher, shine, And crowd with coxcombs thy encumber'd line! Once more, if haply so sublime a flight Has not thine eagle-wing unfeather'd quite, Lift thy sonorous voice distinctly clear, To hail the wonders of this wond'rous year; And though awhile forgot thy epic lore, With slacken'd pinion in epistle soar. Peace to all pedants! Not to thee I sing Whose praises through each echoing college ring; The author of the Pursuits of Literature. Great living lexicon, whose heathen Greek Might rouse the angry shade of sir John Cheeke; Milton's sonnets: Sonnet XI. Or wake old Homer in paternal pain, To view his favour'd Phrygia lost again. Peace to all play'rs! I hope no more to hear The sense of Shakspeare vibrate on my ear; So come not furious in this darkling age, When few effulgent stars adorn the stage, Rudely to quench their ineffectual light, And shroud the theatre in central night. Peace to all poets of the piddling school; By chance who dazzle, or who err by rule; Who by affected point presume to please, Of genuine wit the dark antipodes; Who for sweet babes their brain-abortions pass, And make the winged horse a sluggish ass! A reptile race: if e'er I madly stain My meanest page with such an ideot strain, May that too serve, like their unheeded stuff, To wrap up nails, and pennyworths of snuff. Peace to all patrons! I no longer feed With pearls poetic that sharp-snouted breed; My lord no longer does his gift proclaim, While sneering servants wait to mark my shame; No more the porter, of unvarying face, With courteous insolence denies his grace: For while great bards may pun and shine in state, Poor bards, God help the while! must watch the gate. Yet seldom they such sacred rapture feel As lends a flavour to the well-earn'd meal, Who gain for study, temperance, and health, The bitter blessing of unbounded wealth. Peace to all novelists: a milky tribe Who ne'er descend coarse nature to describe; But throng each hour, “so modest of demaine Spenser.,” With perfect characters to master Lane! I who, with happiest sleight of tuneful heed, Ne'er shook soft warblings from the Doric reed; I who, no simple tenant of the shade, Ne'er saw a shepherd but in masquerade; I who thy garden view with doating eyes, Great Bedford, Covent-garden. fairest sure beneath the skies; I who full often pipe my am'rous lay To nymphs who lamb-like through Old Bond-street stray; Whose sylvan scenes nigh placid Smith field grow, Whose past'rals come from Paternoster-row, Whose rural walk gay Tothill-fields supply; I reck not such fine trumpery—not I. Peace to all censors; if, of peace possest, Their cruel eulogy will let me rest! For oft, to speed some more infernal ends, The ruthless dunces call themselves my friends; Wrest all my motives, maul my harmless mirth, Nay, better than the midwife know my birth; Or, when I write by truth's impartial laws, To private pique ascribe a public cause. Thus late of Wolcot: though, by this good light, I ken not if the blade be black or white; Nor yet know whether, save from babbling fame, Pindar or Wolcot be his proper name. The poet's skill alone intent to scan, I ne'er dissect the morals of the man. 'Tis mine to trace the beauties of his song: To other search domestic faults belong. Should critics on these terms my offer meet, To damn my dulness or applaud my wit, In joint opinion I with Grub-street close, And I and Dutton are no longer foes. Thee now let poignant pleasantry assail; Thee, too tenacious of thy nurse's tale; Thee, Lewis, I devote to satire's shrine: Though pert facility perhaps is thine; Thine quick conception, of the quainter kind; And taste, to trifles aukwardly inclin'd. But why to vice bestow a pander screen? Why with thy monstrous births deform the scene? Why build on blockheads an inglorious fame, Who merely guess thy merit, by thy name; Who pass no further judgment, when they see Those all-sufficient vouchers M. and P.? Go to: as well grave John's funereal croak Might strive t'im part the spirit of a joke; Or Claremont personate the god of wine, Claremont who “looks as he did never dine; Spenser.” As thou by such vile trick aspire to raise A splendid monument of deathless praise. Oft, in youth's idle summer, have I stray'd Delighted through the wild wood's leafy shade, While from some legend's magic clue I caught All its romantic tenderness of thought; Oft, fondly glowing with heroic heat, At Arthur's table took my fancied seat; At Merlin's call, beneath unclouded skies, Saw bloomy bow'rs and golden turrets rise; And, as soft warblings harmoniz'd each spray, Dissolv'd in bliss, all languishingly lay. Soon riper reason spurn'd the specious dream, When manhood made me choose a nobler theme; Some theme that wider benefits pursu'd, Some theme conducive to the public good. Much as thyself I praise the merry elves, But wish not fairy-tales to load our shelves; Nor yet have offer'd, with presumptuous pride, To push, for Geoffry, Geoffry of Monmouth, the chronicler. Juvenal aside: Though oft my breast has felt a rapt'rous thrill, Touch'd by the plume of Ludovico's Ariosto. quill; Though oft with Dante I have lov'd to dwell Mid the dread woes of Ugolino's cell, And o'er the fabled scroll of grief severe Heav'd the big sigh or stream'd the ardent tear. But when those fatal fantasies pervert The wayward sense, not meliorate the heart; When the numb'd soul is steep'd in stupid trance, And ev'n the scriptures dwindle to romance; I curse the madness of a guilty taste, By thee with more than vulgar glory grac'd; Avert my fondness from such nauseous whims, Preferring to Child Waters A celebrated old ballad of that title. David's hymns. Like conj'rer's bag, how many a maniac's scull Is with newts, toads, and asps, completely full! Sure that the horrid medley will go down, He spews his various garbage on the town; Till sprightly belles are frighten'd into fits, And beaus (if blest with any) lose their wits. Perversely ridden by some scribbling imp, Did I, a kraken, challenge you, a shrimp? When first you made the gaping million drunk, Did I expose the baldness of your Monk? Did I discover the mysterious hole From which your putrid carcases you stole? And while those “spirits from the vasty deep” You call'd aloud, did I not only sleep? In pity I forbear, as carrion prey, To taint my nostrils with your hideous play; The Castle Spectre. Where incident and language, point and plot, And all but loathsome spectacle's forgot; Drawbridge and dungeon, knight and trusty squire, Squalid consumption, spectre cloth'd in fire, Illumin'd altars, and “chimeras dire.” Smit with the frenzy of a foreign race Who all their beauty in distortion place, Who couple contraries with equal ease As taylors munch their cucumbers with peas, Was't not enough to filch their flimsy style, But thou must rob the worthies of our isle; Those dauntless spirits whose exalted fire, Shall bid eternity their works admire; Those heirs of honour who, divinely brave, Fought as they sung; o'er whose illustrious grave, The muse hath hung th' imperishable wreath Whose golden blooms ambrosial sweetness breathe; Those bright phenomena of former days, Crown'd with sure profit, and as certain praise; When charming poesy was all their own, And Germans, but for dulness, quite unknown? Ev'n now, when star-eyed Learning has unfurl'd Her pictur'd banner o'er th' applauding world, That Briton who affects the German school Is (lo the aptness of the rhyme!) a fool. Yet wisely (and, I wot, by shrewd advice) Thou sell'st thy tome at an enormous price. How few can reach it in this troublous time! For now a guinea touches the sublime. Shillings, indeed, your middling folks may bring; But, ah! that guinea is a serious thing. Paper nor type affords such true delight As that small portrait to the partial sight: And yet the vassal mob may wish to sport Their taste as freely as the mob at court. Say to what use, should charity prevail, Wilt thou apply the surplus of the sale? Wilt thou bestow some Chatterton his bread, And bid one drooping genius lift his head: Or rather, to renew the holy game, A Covent-garden sisterhood reclaim; New nuns elect, debarr'd from wanton wiles, Or friars of the order of St. Giles; Refit old abbeys mouldering in decay, With wooden crosses plant the public way, Encowl at once each pocket-picking chap, And proudly raise at Holborn a La Trappe? How couldst thou gut each stall, and grub, and glean, Like the vile vamper of a magazine; Nay, for the bliss of being bought and read, Rob at one pull the living and the dead? Oh, witness all ye gods! no pen of mine Had pour'd the stricture of one sober line, If Southey only felt thy plund'ring rage, If only Southey's ballads deck'd thy page: Congenial Southey, who has made poor Joan, A poem entitled Joan of Arc. As though in travail, through his volume groan, And set so oft all necromancy loose; Glorious competitor of mother Goose. But why, by letter'd felony unaw'd, Immortal Dryden of his right defraud? Known in all lands, in every tongue display'd, Great hapless bard whose talent was his trade. Why, not so long elaps'd from mortal day Wrest his green laurels from the brow of Gray? But chief from Burns, whose needy friends remain To reap the profits of his recent strain, Why pluck his purest gem, his richest grace, Which candour wishes in its proper place? Here let me shed a tear, to feeling true, To him, the son of native Humour, due; To whom fair Fancy gave the pow'r, and smil'd, Best to depict the wonderful, the wild; Yet who, 'mid vauntings of capricious pride, With all his fame a slighted victim died. Divulge what “foul fiend” hurried thee along, From Percy to purloin his ancient song; To baffle his research and curious care, And leave the prelate's pious Reliques bare. Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, collected and published by Dr. Percy. 'Twas almost sacrilege; and by saint Paul, Doth loudly for austerest penance call: A fiery ordeal at least I think, Or an eternal fast from pen and ink. But now, with honest wrath too justly warm, Let Fancy lend her intellectual charm; While, sure your ghostly worship to delight, I recollect a vision of the night, And drier maxims featously improve By a mere dream—since dreams descend from Jove. When ev'ry sense by pow'rful Sleep was seal'd, And o'er the brain his poppy-dews prevail'd, In my lone study, lo! methought I sat, Grave as an owl, and pensive as a cat. Before my sight, in pompous garment gay, Fresh from the press thy Tales of Wonder lay; And much I gloated, with lascivious eyes, On its white form, gilt edge, and comely size: When sudden from the lab'ring shelves around I heard at first a small, still, solemn sound, That louder wax'd anon:—and now I view'd Descending from their cells the motley brood; An animated host of various hue; Pale-yellow, chesnut-brown, cerulean blue, And glowing red as if inflam'd by rage; All cover'd with the rev'rend dust of age. Fierce they approach'd, and (oh, extremest grief!) Each from the stranger-volume tore a leaf, Indignant tore; and while my anxious mind Quick doubts involv'd, scarce “left a wreck behind;” Then to their several seats alertly fled, Mutt'ring low curses on thy fated head. Curious to know what lucubration rare Those vellum-vested knaves would deign to spare, Thy tome, all tatter'd as it was, I took: Good heav'n, how much unlike the former book! For they had pick'd the meat, but spurn'd the bone; And left thee only Southey's and—thy own. Pleas'd by the civil censure of the joke, I shook my sides with laughter, and awoke. The man who makes morality his aim, No servile lacquey of a short-liv'd fame; Who from the plenteous store of knowledge flings On peasants honour, or contempt on kings; Who never stoop'd to yelp with mongrel throat A statesman's praise, nor pawn'd his venal vote; Who ne'er his conscience villainously sold, To change his thread-bare frieze for cloth of gold; Who ne'er could truck integrity for pelf, Consummate traitor—traitor to himself; Who with a brave disdain eschews the bow'r Of syren pleasure, and the bait of pow'r; Who, with a gen'rous openness of mind, Renders his genius useful to mankind; Who, filling the rude hind with mental food, The sweet profusion pours of fair and good; Though secret foes his stubborn truth assail, Tried at the bar, or pining in a jail; Against his peace though hell's black imps conspire,— Him do I rev'rence, him do I admire; And, half represt by some low coward fear, Ask in a sigh, why is not H—here? Not the grim scavenger condemn'd to scrape Some German rubbish into form and shape; Who monthly prints at the express desire Of a dull duke, and figures an esquire; Not the collegiate drudge whose puny praise Rests on the ruins of remoter days; Content, with prosody's familiar aid, Bad English in worse Latin to degrade; His Gradus ad Parnassum in one hour Completely rifled of each Roman flow'r, 'Till (bust of Maro tremble from thy base!) Each cantab wonders at his classic grace; Swears, Livy, he disputes the palm with thee, And half denies thy patavinity. One who well knew the soul's minutest springs (Squire Ovid) in harmonious numbers sings: “Intently to have learn'd each lib'ral art, Refines the morals, and reforms the heart.” Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes, Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros. But liberal arts in vain to those are taught Who turn their very learning to a fault. Not the pert fop who, in a fairy trance, Will before breakfast drivel a romance; Nay, if you kindly grant him twice that time, Will metamorphose his romance to rhyme; No: (though ordain'd in that huge house to sit, Renown'd for policy, if not for wit; Where flies the quick reply, the smart remark, Should whig meet whig, and jostle in the dark;) Not ev'n thyself, O Lewis! do I prize When, vainly learn'd, unprofitably wise, In futile schemes thy brighter parts are lost, And the state's welfare by a goblin crost. Hence ye light tribe who weave the gaudy clue Which puzzled reason seldom can pierce through! Ye silky sonneteering fribbles, hence; Disown'd by poesy, disdain'd by sense! Close to sage Bedlam fix your lineal throne, And 'mid craz'd brethren make Moorfields your own. Hear thou the voice of taste, of judgment hear! Let their fair forms in wonted light appear; Let Nature's self, consummate linguist, plead; Be chaste propriety from phrenzy freed; Thy ill example instantly remove, Divorc'd from follies far beneath thy love. When thou hast sprinkled holy water down, And wasted pailfulls on this precious town; When thou hast exercis'd each hare-brain'd rogue, Proclaiming nonsense is no more the vogue; Each boarding-school of beastly novels clear'd, Clean of pollution as a bridegroom's beard; But chiefly go'st thyself at night to bed Compos'd, without one spectre in thy head; And I no more am stunn'd, in list'ning lanes, With river-queens, mad Molls, and crazy Janes; Then will I change my tune to notes of praise, Nor blend the bitter ivy with the bays. THE FREQUENTED VILLAGE. In a sort of dedication of this little poem to Lord Forbes, Dermody rests his claim to a humble imitation of Goldsmith, on the circumstance of “being born very near the place which that poet so elegantly describes.” He says also that “it was written in the space of three hours, in a very wet evening, when his ideas were somewhat cramped and vapid, from the impression of the dull air, or from dulness itself.” While o'er thy urn the pitying Virtues weep, And lull thy tuneful soul to endless sleep, Ah! spare one moment from the baleful tomb, And burst from black oblivion's envious gloom; To future ages, Goldsmith, shine confest, And seize the hallow'd temple of my breast: In warblings wild attune the trembling chord, And soothe the melting mind at every word: For thou alone such pity couldst impart, And touch the master movements of the heart; With beauty's languor tinge the lovely cheek, And raise such thoughts as words but faintly speak. What artless innocence adorns each line, What glowing tints the precious draught refine, When to the heart thy thrilling numbers cling, And rapture floats along the golden string! Caught by the sound, my eyes unbounded roll Along the page, and tell my frenzied soul, While rising passions paint my varying face, And Nature gleams in each attractive trace. E'en now, while o'er the devious path I stray, And smiling auburn stops my museful way, Fresh transports swell the torrent of delight, And all thy simple neatness charms my sight. The new-built village rears its humble head, And desolation's murky crew are fled; Plenty adorns again each rural street, And friendship walks with every sweet I meet. The sounds of joy accost my wish'd return, And not one native wretch is left to mourn. The palsied dame that from yon stagnant flood, Dipp'd the sour bev'rage for her ev'ning food, Now sees again her humble cot secure, And thousand welcomes greet her at the door. And though no husband meets her hast'ning pace, No sportive children bless her smiling face, Yet rose-lip'd peace her couch of straw attends, And all the grateful neighbours are her friends. From the chill storm that rends the tow'ring dome, Yon thickset hedges save her little home; And when the thoughts of former times arise, With pious hand she wipes her streaming eyes; Resign'd and calm she hopes to be forgiv'n, And kneels compliant to the will of Heav'n. Yet though the widow's tears may sometime flow, And tell the tender luxury of woe; Though all her sufferings past sad thoughts inspire, And swell her annals by the ev'ning fire; Full many a wretch, by loss of fortune curst, Though rear'd in plenty, by indulgence curs'd, Has quaffed the cup of grief, unmix'd with joy, And heaved for ages the eternal sigh. Yon elm that, swelling on the ample sight, Copes with the hill behind in equal height, Has seen full many a shepherd tress around, And fresh delighted with the bagpipe's sound. High on a tree with mossy verdure green, The rural minstrel oft, with cheerful mien, Harmonic instrument of song inspires, And feeds the latent spark of am'rous fires. Along the plain the damsels diftly skim; And every ogling swain robust of limb, With simple grace the fair one's hand receives, And holds it close, and willingly believes No rival youth his sweetheart's love possess'd, Or bought the cherry ribbon for her breast; Or led her late at eve to neighbouring fair, To win her virgin heart incautious there. While all their sons attract the village crowd, And tell their joy in revelry aloud, The hoary sire in rev'rend grandeur sit, Recounting feats of valour, or their wit; And such a ring attends the orleage ball, That scarce the alehouse seat can hold them all. Replenish'd quarts supply the nutbrown tide, And swell amain each hoary patriarch's pride; Till each contends to crack the drollest jest, And quite forgets that e'er he was distress'd. The sage exciseman boasts his youthful deeds; The barber spruce, how oft his patient bleeds; And while the farrier apes the tuneful throng, The limping corporal hops, and falls along. The younger race, along the meadows stray, Or build their lofty tenements of clay; Or, warrior-like, the wooden steed bestride, While captive infants totter at their side. Some in a snug retreat, of nobler parts, With mystic tale entrap the yielding hearts, 'Till stalking awful up the winding lane, The rural pedant shakes his hostile cane. Amaz'd, the little audience stand to bow, And read the dismal threat'nings of his brow. The good man views each blooming pupil's face, And gives the nod of triumph or disgrace. But, lo! the curate comes with aspect meek, And asks from each the labour of the week. Some shew the pious task with glist'ning eye, And some expect his anger with a sigh: But far from him the supercilious sneer, Or critic frown, inflieting pangs of fear, To each his little present he extends, And parts with all the youthful troop, his friends. Applausive shouts attend his prosp'rous way, And all unanimous combine the lay. Thus some fond bird regales with choicest food, And anxiously defends her infant brood; Spreads her soft pinions o'er the downy nest, And warms each unfledged darling in her breast: And as with patient wing she flits along, The grateful warblers cheer her with a song; Till rising tuneful from the shelter'd glade, The neighb'ring songsters join the serenade. See where of yore the bankrupt merchant lay, To rav'ning duns and cruel men a prey; Where sunk his state, by barb'rous landlords press'd, And many a pang has agoniz'd his breast; There tow'rs again the sign with gilded post, And rich apparel lie, the wearer's boast. Full many a frolic crowns the oaken chair, And many a son of honest mirth is there. But lo! methinks new wonders strike my eye, Where flames the white-wash'd alehouse sign on high. There leans the bar-maid o'er the creaking door, And gives a well-fill'd tankard to the poor; While in her dimpling cheek the Graces smile, And sweet simplicity attracts the while. Beyond the house, a verdant arbour lies, And spreads its flaunting flow'rs of various dyes, There have I traced the novel's fairy dance, Or pierc'd the murky caves of gay romance, Meanwhile, the quaint ear'd cur, with sudden bark, The pretty trembler frighted in the dark. Ah! vale belov'd; where sportive health advanced, And all the choir of youthful pleasures danced; While poesy led on the jocund throng, And sooth'd their labours with her sweetest song; While Shannon's warbling wave return'd the strain, And hanging mountains caught the sound again: How oft have all thy babbling echoes rung, With the first lays my muse enamour'd sung; And seem'd to propagate the tuneful theme With sounds prophetic of my future fame! Where'er I go; ah! may thy image rest, Within the sacred mansion of my breast: Ah! may that breast thy dearest scenes retain, Thou loveliest village of the loveliest plain. Thy decent church with antique sculptures graced Thy spire with half its mystic marks effaced, The bowling-green with velvet herbage gay, The mill-stream glitt'ring to the solar ray, The well-wove bow'r for whisp'ring lovers made, The school embosom'd in the healthiest shade, The two-arch'd bridge aslant the level road, And slated well the parson's small abode; Nay, even the peasant's straw-thatch hut can charm, And numerous beauties deck th' adjacent farm, When, from the world and all its splendours free, Sweet place, I fondly ruminate on thee. Would the rich man but thank the lab'rers toil, And cheer the brow of anguish with a smile, Inglorious sloth would shortly leave the land, And fly pernicious to some alien strand. Then would the poor man's merit full appear, And smiling Spring invest the blooming year; O'er cultur'd grounds the master walk with joy, And see mute gladness in the farmer's eye; While waving seeds of corn their lord unfold, And clothe the laughing fields with bearded gold. So should sweet Auburn more majestic rise, And glad with new delight the poet's eyes. THE SHEPHERD'S DESPAIR. My Lucy was charming and fair, Love shot all his shafts from her eyes: So sweet, so commanding her air, It could soften at once and surprise. Such pity, such tenderness, play'd, Serene in her face and her mind! But the vision of hope is decay'd, Though the shadows still linger behind. My flute was melodious and soft, The joy of the pastoral throng; The linnet would join from aloft, And Lucy embolden the song: My cheeks which pale sorrow will fade, Were the red rose and lily combin'd. But the vision of hope is decay'd, Though its shadows still linger behind. Ah, fair as the blossoms of spring, Ah! how could that bosom be cold? More love lay in Corydon's ring, More wealth than in Floridel's gold. The dotard now wooes my dear maid, Now feels every rapture refin'd:— Yes: the vision of hope's quite decay'd, Though the shadows still linger behind. No more to my flocks will I sing, No more tend the calls of the fold, No more shall the glad valleys ring, Since affection is barter'd for gold. I will fly with Despair to the shade, I will die on some rude rock reclin'd; For the vision of hope is decay'd, Though the shadows still linger behind. ELEGIAC STANZAS TO FIDELE, IN CYMBELINE. Fear no more the scorching heat; Fear no more the driving show'r: Life has tir'd thy pilgrim feet; Death has nipt thy budding flow'r. Pains nor aches shall vex thy form, Nor penury with gripe of steel; Frozen death's benumbing storm, Has marr'd that breast that wont to feel. Yet shall fond Friendship, cherub mild, With balmy wing defend thy tomb; And hov'ring love, a weeping child, Rove sadly through the sacred gloom. Fond widows, of their loves bereav'd, Shall o'er the fresh sod pensive bend; And village maids untimely grieved, Thy sweetly-silent scene attend. Full many a prayer shall o'er thy clay, Devoutly breathe from artless lip; Full many a moan, at close of day, From plaintive bosom heaving deep. Oft as the shepherd passes by, Shall sorrow catch each mourning wind; And innocence, with incense sigh, Cast a long ling'ring look behind. Here shall no dismal exil'd fay, In vap'rish shroud terrific drest, Affright thy votive train away, And scare the tender hermit's breast. But gleams of sunshine gild the place, When light sinks fainting in the west; And morning's smilings purple grace With orient dawn thy peaceful rest. On the green turf of twinkling dew, That holds the loveliest frame below, Shall Spring assort her harebells blue, And fling her gems of living snow. The lark shall here begin his song Amid the awful stillness round, And cooing turtles frequent throng, The branch that marks the secret ground Meanwhile thy poet's Collins. floating shade, Shall from the womb of night emerge, Review thy rites most duly pay'd, And sing his dear Fidele's dirge. Fear no more the scorching heat; Fear no more the driving show'r: Life has tir'd thy pilgrim feet, Death has nipt thy budding flow'r. THE CAVE OF IGNORANCE. IN TWO CANTOS. CANTO I. ARGUMENT. Foul Archimage, enchaunter vile, The redcross knight doth lead To Ignorance his darksome cave, Through many a murky shade. Ah me! full long shall arts and arms decay, And modest worth in lonely desert pine; Full long shall Penury, with iron sway, The noblest darings of the soul confine, And freeze the genial glow of verse divine. But yet, sweet mourners of the tuneful train, A future age shall in your praise combine; Your fame, your matchless fame, shall still remain, And rising nations swell the high immortal strain Down a deep dell the sly enchaunter led, Through dol'rous lanes and sad, the redcross knight; To where thick yews disclose, inflicting dread, A cave unconscious of the noon-day light. This place the Cave of Ignorance is hight; Where he, the wizard wild, doth aye rejoice To mar the golden treasures of the muse, And scatter to the winds each lofty voice: Ne doth he e'er the glorious page peruse, But with his blackest gall doth fairest works abuse. A feeble lamp-light aids his winking eye, While he on crude Bavarian volume pores; Or strives in Excellence a spot to spy, That he might vilify her precious stores. And ever and anon he loudly roars, When he doth see a model passing rare That mocks all malice; which the carl explores, And makes each wrong as empty as the air: But hard, I ween, it is, to taint the truly fair. Beneath his stool unnumber'd authors lie, For there he casts each gently flowing song; And doth to each a reading fair deny, But still continueth to work them wrong. Here droops dan Virgil under durance strong, And Milton here doth Satan praise no more; Sweet Mulla's modest bard his descant long Doth cast aside of legendary lore, And views his fairy web perdye to pieces tore. Full many a demon urges, on his side, To spoil the commonweal of youthful Taste. Malice, with blinking eye; fantastic pride; Folly, in mockery on a throne yplac'd; Revenge, by troops of rav'nous bloodhounds chas'd; With frontless visage, brazen Impudence; Blind Zeal, with ribs of ruthless iron lac'd, Antique, misshapen wight, with dark pretence; And thousands more; attack the sovreignty of Sense. Soon as the redcross knight those imps espy'd, He sought some way to 'scape their baneful snare; But strait a voice in thunder harsh reply'd: “Beware, bold knight; of jeopardy beware. If aught, disdainful of our word, thou dare, Plung'd in yon dungeon ages shalt thou lie; Where embryo Shades, and half-form'd Centaurs, tear The rankled flesh; where heaves th' eternal sigh: A giant guards the den, his name Uncertainty.” So spoke the wrathful keeper of the gate; Contention hight, yclad in prickly arms; A crown of thistles wreath'd his noisy pate; Stillettoes guard his sides, prepar'd for harms: And a hoarse bugle sounds his rough alarms. A wight he was right fond of obloquy: In Scorn, fell dame, he saw resistless charms, And lov'd the proud demeanor of her eye: To his embrace she bore the fiend Contumacy. Soon as the master of this gloomy cave The voice o'erheard of that same troublous wight, He cry'd with wily words: “Audacious slave, Why thus contemptuous speak to noblest knight That ever blessed my happy nation's sight? Caitiff, avaunt; or by this spell I swear, Thy tortur'd soul shall feel, with wild affright, The ceaseless horrors of continual fear: The whips of pale Remorse, the stings of fell Despair. But thou so courteous knight, come hither, share The various dainties that my court affords: Here spend thy frolic hours, devoid of care, With courtly damsels and with gallant lords. Let earth-born misers pile their golden hoards, Here, senseless of the spring, thy thirst assuage: No mountains stop thy course, nor dang'rous fords; To blessed Ignorance thy life engage, Nor wish to read futurity's ill-omen'd page. “Lo! here no country claims thy strict regard, And cheats thy manly eye with infant bell: No sage will pester here, nor servile bard; No friends will hunt thee in this mazy dell. Then bid old fame, and honours all, farewell. What man would wish the rugged mount to climb, When in the vale more fragrant zephyrs dwell? Or who would tempt the arduous lay sublime, When Ease here idly sings, and consecrates her rhime? “Give o'er thy quest of virtue. If on earth She deigns to live, her residence is here: This spot of holy concord gave her birth; Where zeal aye nurs'd the child, without a fear That could her peace with harsh annoyance scare. In conscious fortitude the virgin see; Her port majestic, her excelling air, She moves in haughty stalk of dignity: On earth fair virtue hight, but here Temerity.” Right wrathful waxed then the redcross knight; And knew th' enchaunter, speaking though so mild: His hairs stood bristling up in fierce affright; His looks grew wan and red, and staring wild; And oft he foam'd with rage, and often smil'd. At length, quick-rising with chivalrous ire, He sought to draw his glaive with gore defil'd; But (marvellous to tell!) as forged by fire, It wreathed round his feet, with semblance unto wire. O mortal hopes, and mortal fears, how vain! Thus when some lozel heir, from riches sprung, Proud as sir Paradel of gaudy train, Doth nothing mind but nimbleness of tongue, And squandering jewels on a heap of dung, Debts grow on debts, on legers legers rise; The banker looks his learned books among, The younker's chearisaunce with spite he spies, And traps the helpless wight who sad in durance lies. CANTO II. ARGUMENT. Intelligence, a trusty spright, Escapes from wicked bond; Till her the good Sir Genius finds, The pride of Fairy Lond. All hail again rich Fancy's orient ray, That gaily gilds this mortal pilgrimage! Ah! never let her soft'ning tints decay, And leave a sombre sadness on my page; But still with flashes bright the soul engage. While she but deigns to visit my low cell, Sequester'd from the strife of party rage, How blest my lot! and Philomel shall dwell Nigh yonder grot where spar-crown'd rivulets swell. And often, at the calm of sober eve, Let Contemplation aid my pensive thought; While fairy minstrels o'er some fountain grieve, And mine ear tingles with the death-bell smote. Oh! then are purest inspirations wrought, In all the majesty of dream array'd; The ray of Heaven, in frenzy'd glances caught, Then bursts of midnight drear the veily shade; And dear illusions throng the wild romantic glade. There was a cunning fay of nimblest flight, In a dark cave by Ignorance confin'd, Shut up from every glimpse of heav'nly light, And every balmy breath of purer wind, Save one small loop-hole which she did not mind. Through this the tiny fay made her escape, Lithe as a willow wand which zephyrs bind: But soon as out from her vile dungeon deep, She rose from pigmy height to most gigantic shape. Indignant at such master's vile control, She wing'd her journey towards blithe Fairy-land; Intent to warm the good sir Genius' soul, And arm with rugged mail his knightly hand; That he might devastate the adverse band, And break the baleful influence of their sway; That by his aid the Redcross might withstand Enchauntment foul, ne in dark cave decay. With this good will the fairy took her fleeting way. And now arriv'd, she furl'd her pennons light, And rov'd through many a bow'r and many a grove; Where laurels flung their arms of verdure bright Across the way, and join'd embrace above. The matted green, with roses interwove, Outvied the syrian hue or damask art: Such carpeting was sure a seat for Love; And Love was there, with bevies fair apart, Mild to the ravish'd eye, and harmless to the heart. Not that sly boy that wont in Carthage erst To pierce the bosom of th' unhappy queen; But one who, every mist of doubt disperst, Confessed virtue in his modest mien. With him the white-robed Charities are seen On yon gemm'd bank, with chaste addresses dancing: Where oft of yore the satyr-tribe have been; But Hymen now, and harmless Joy, advancing, Lead up the quire, to viol soft entrancing. On one side, skirted by a bushy screen From Phœbus' ray, a vined lane extends; Huge oaks, like lofty pillars, rise between, And at the top each bow'ry column bends. Here Genius oft, or with selected friends, Or Silence' self, his-sober revel keeps: Swift-feather'd Haste his every call attends; And when the dewy eye of Cynthia weeps, Morpheus his pillow crowns with pure ambrosial sleeps. Here then the fay the blessed owner found, And told him all her doubts and anxious fears: The knight, full gen'rous, startled at the sound; And in a moment all in mail appears: For Haste had quickly clad him, though in tears At the departure of so kind a master; And scarce, poor wretch! her-little bosom cheers, Unable for the load of such disaster. But yet she stirs her heart, and then procceds much faster. Now from the bow'r they haste with wondrous speed, Many a hillock o'er, and bushy bourn; The night-bird sung her song with tuneful heed, Sad sorrowing o'er her lover's willowy urn: The noisy rook grew clamorous in turn, And marr'd with envious croak each melting thrill; The silver stream began with her to mourn, Yet the rude rook continued croaking still,— Critic, I wot, that's licens'd aye to kill. Sir Genius now the Cave of Error sees; And pierces every glade, by Truth yled: She darts fierce noon-day through th' illumin'd trees, And braids with lucid stars her champion's head. “Who thus presumes to face my presence dread, And draws along this hostile line of light? Who thus unhallow'd burns my downy bed? I know the now; 'tis Genius, recreant knight: Imps, bear the ruthless villain from my blasted sight.” So spoke the darksome fiend, in wild amaze; Nought did the knight in answer yet rejoin, But slow presented to his steadfast gaze A tome which did with golden letters shine; Perfection (hight) of Minstrelsye divine. Soon as the name he saw, with conquer'd pride Thrice he essay'd to kneel before such shrine; But, as with horrent air each word he eyed, Lifeless th' enchaunter fell, and fiercely foaming died. This when sir Genius saw, with mickle joy A magic horn he to his lips applied; Stunn'd with the sound, each other fiends destroy, And lie unmourned by their master's side. The while the redcross knight of horror void, Doth tune the fibres of his breast to pleasure; And 'mongst the clouds is gloriously espied The magic horn, of Fame the sounding treasure, Which gives to every wight renown'd impartial measure. FAREWELL TO CARE. Away, ye Cares; ye black-brow'd Cares, away! Must mortal man aye drag your galling chain? Away! the sun sits monarch of the day, The glorious sun; and guides his glitt'ring wain, His wheels half-hanging o'er the western main. I drink the influence of his balmy light: I feel the hot tide throb through every vein: Young Transport calls, in purple pleasures dight. Young Transport calls, and why should I remain? No: let me shun thy shades, and join her jovial train. What though the haughty patron damns my song, And Malice looks with meagre eye askance? I'll trip the daisied meadows blithe along, Braid my loose locks and mingle in the dance. Not Pride can break this dear delicious trance; Not Envy style this sylvan joyance wrong. For who can bound the pennons of the soul? Who mar those scenes I love to rove among? Ne mortal word the sweet flow'rs can control; Or bid the pausing sun frown grim, and cease to roll. Though Greatness turns away, the rill will pour In liquid measure from its channell'd bed; The surge will gleam, and kiss the golden shore; The blue-topp'd mount will lift his awful head. Though poverty may rule my humble shed, The teeming wild will grant an unbought store; The briar will blow, the living nectar spring, The vernal rushes strew the fragrant floor: Dainties, in sooth, that well might please a king. Then cast thy woes aside, and hymns of comfort sing. The lark is merry though he has no hoard; The blackbird carols though his house is gone; Come, spendthrift, come, and feed at Nature's board; Nature's unkind to luxury alone. Nor pains nor aches shall vex each tortur'd bone; Temperance no room for sickness may afford. Rise with thy brother-bards, in social glee: The morn will put her brightest purple on. Fools of this world! what wight would spleen-sick be, If he could roam at large, and chaunt his joys, with me? With bards long gone celestial converse hold, And court coy fancy in her woodbound bow'r; What time, as by sage Beldames we are told, Aerial warblings charm the solemn hour; While marshall'd elves their glitt'ring glow-worms pour, And “drowsy tinklings lull the distant fold;” What time bright spirits load the wing of eve, And frenzy'd minstrels wond'rous sights behold. Those with soft dreams thy spirit shall relieve, Till fancy brilliant wreaths of fabled verdure give. Beneath the awful foliage of yon oak That shudders at the eddying pool below; Where abbey-aisles rebound the woodman's stroke And sister-currents wildly-dimpling flow; There thou, who bear'st the bitter weight of woe, Mayst all thy scenes of happier youth revoke; Nought shall intrude, save when the silver trout Haply should spring from stripling's hairy yoke; Comus will never lead his revel rout To stun thy feelings there with bacchanalian shout. Those walls, enwrought with age's with'ring grey, Where hoary blossoms crown the turret's brow, Ne'er echo to the drunkard's wassail lay. Here sighs the lover his immortal vow, Here weeps the friend his parted friend below: Fond meditation marks each mould'ring clay, And reverend relics holy horrors tell. Here ancient Virtue lives, serenely gay. Old tales have famed each mystic cavern well; And hidden treasures lurk, eld says, in every cell. Away, ye Cares; ye black-brow'd Cares, away! Let Fortune smile or frown, I still can smile; Constant can fabricate the artless lay, While conscience whispers that I know no guile. Full pleasant prospects, lo! reward my toil, Full glad, I trow, when life 'gins to decay, Those tranquil joys shall gild declining age; While Hope's sheen-mirror darts a lucky ray On the pure breast; and in this mortal cage Uncensur'd may I sing, nor dread Detraction's rage. FAREWELL TO JOY. Bright smiles the orient with celestial red, The fleecy clouds their golden skirts display, Thick phalanx'd trees enclothe the mountain head, And groves luxuriant wanton in the ray. Ah me! can those for mis'ries dire repay, And call the brilliant scenes for ever fled? Can the bright orient's rosy smile impart The balm of hope, or dews of comfort shed? Can trees thick-phalanx'd, groves luxuriant, dart Contentment's glowing beam, and close my bleeding heart? Still shall I load with sighs the sobbing gale, Still murmur to the riv'let's solemn flow, Tell the dull ear of night my piteous tale, And bid still ev'ning weep upon my woe. My myrtle-plants, alas! are with'ring low, My roseate wreaths no more fresh sweets exhale; Sorrow, and blank despair, have marr'd their bloom: My laurels droop in harsh oblivion's vale. Ah! never shall they rise but on my tomb: Ah! never, but in heav'n, disperse their bland perfume. Come, Sadness, then, and thy companion, Care, And all the fiends that crowd the couch of Death: Let the black cypress crown my unkimpt hair, With deadly hemlock twined, the sweetest wreath. Let nought but savage woes around me breathe, Nought but the death-watch greet my sullen ear: For I pre-eminence of grief may claim. Oft shall fond memory pour the heart-drawn tear; While woe congenial pauses on my fame, And dumb Despair points out my long-lamented name. Where the romantic cliff, like Ruin's throne, Hangs o'er the dashing surge with awful steep; Where unseen spirits heave the dismal groan, And distant elves are often heard to weep; Where shiv'ring corpses leave their haunted sleep, Seen by the moon's affrighted eye alone; There let me moulder with the mould'ring ground. For brother-bards, and tuneful souls, long gone, Shall glad with melody the wilds around; And fairies mark my grave, with mountain-garlands crown'd. THE PROGRESS OF PEDANTRY. The wight I sing who thro' Protean changes The course of brazen pedantry pursues; Thro' quibbles, puns, and motley bon-mots, ranges, (Bon-mots, sage elfs, who con all wayward news, Subject perdye right arduous to the muse!) The wight who quite from mortal ken estranges To study Plato and the Stagyrite, Ye sprites Batavian, critics deep, avenge his Dispraises vile; and while all proud I write, Dub me (illustrious meed!) great “sooterkin of wit.” First in the musty cloisters of a college, Poor servitor (a hapless state, I ween), He dives expert in metaphysic knowledge, And sees (what only by his eye is seen) Myst'ries of awful depth; dulness their queen; Like the vain dreams that crown'd the murky foliage Of Morpheus tree, erst view'd by Venus' sun, Darkling he ponders on a chair whose two legs Down topple soon; bereft of sprightly fun, Bereft of beef and ale,—but not bereft of dun. Eftsoons the brother-wizards spy his lore, A scholarship his golden branch appears; Fine branch, that gives him, ale unquaff'd before, October cognamed, hid full many a year. Now deep Smiglecius, wet with nut-brown cheer, Doth pose his pate, and bid the sluggard snore: 'Mongst holy fathers spends he the long night, And livelong day, while others rant and roar. His tassel'd square cap, comely to the sight, Doth make him seem like man that necromancer hight. At last, old pedantry's anointed heir, The Antichrist of learning, he doth rise Despotic fellow of Miss Alma's chair. Exub'rant ignorance doth glaze his eyes: Ignorance that makes a turtle a lord may'r. With frowzy beard, black mouth, and haggard hair, The goblin meagre utters maxims wise; Through logic, physic flounders in despair, Or tumbles in the depth where error lies: Awful profound! where dash'd in woeful guise With cobwebs blind he sleeps; till, miscreant vile! he dies. THE VANITY OF HOPE. Forlorn is he who trusts to-morrow's fate: The genial sun will rise, but not for him. The fool who revels high in gorgeous state Ne'er sees the frightful face of Mis'ry grim, Or views of bitter woe before him swim. The poet's cottage is her surest seat; O'er his meek head she flaps her raven wing; Poisons the pittance poor that he must eat; With deadly juice taints the Pierian spring, And bids her spirits lurk beneath each warbling string. Fair Promise oft may come with smiling face; But trust not, trust not her deceiving wile! Envy perhaps may mar each well-masqued grace, And foul Disdain usurp the pitying smile. O mortal wight! what is thy life but toil; A pilgrimage of woes, a false embrace; A lasting pain where Disappointment rears Her scorpion whip to sting thy gentlest peace; To Innocence shuts close her iron ears, And from the aching heart each beauteous phantom tears? Alert we climb the mountain's rugged brow; And toil to gain the summit, idly vain: At last we find that bliss was left below, And proud Ambition is the sire of Pain. Bright-tressed Transport, and her jocund train, In the deep valley bid their blossoms blow: Struggling Desire the lofty cliff would climb, But foul Derision stands his grinning foe: Awhile he stands; but, lo! in flow'ry prime Mischance will hurl him swift from potency sublime. Forlorn is he who trusts to-morrow's dawn. Then let no glitt'ring gauds delude thine eye; Let Hope's fond rainbow scenery be withdrawn, And brighter aims recal thy glance on high. Fulfilment is the daughter of the sky, Who bids frail doubts and subtleties be gone; With Destiny she shares her radiant seat, Placed to the right of the eternal throne: She can alone make saddest sorrows sweet, Erase thy sable stains, and make thee all-complete. THE VISION OF FANCY. Sir Chanticleer has thrust his red crest high From vetchy bed, and wound his bugle shrill: Night sinks her ebon chariot from the sky, And infant morn peeps blushful o'er the hill. The white-sleev'd mower sweeps with scythed skill, The rosy-featur'd milkmaid loads her pail, The twitt'ring swallow skims the vernal sill, The herald blackbird bids Dan Phœbus hail, And blue-ey'd Pleasure wakes her dryads in the dale. To mellow flute by lively touch address'd, And tinkling tabour trip the merry fays; And wanton wile, shrewd wit, and jocund jest, With revel quaint, disport ten thousand ways, All by a stream whose crisped current plays Melodiously the pebbles smooth among: Perdye, not minstrelsye of Arthur's days, Nor elfin tournament, Arcadian throng, Could nearly vye with sports to this blythe troop belong. There might the rainbow spread its dyes in vain, And all-abash'd before their glories fade; For Tyrian hue, or Melibean stain, Could nought adorn. Bright Fancy, matchless maid, In filmy pearls her helmet sheen array'd, With lucid eyes of toad her shield emboss'd, Her golden tresses gleaming o'er the shade, Lo, lo! the Empress comes; in wonder lost, My swimming eye-balls dance, and worldly care is lost. Fast by her side, begirt with buskins green, Her cheeks envermeil'd with the peach's bloom, Hies heav'nly Health: around the luscious scene She looks, and sweetly sprinkles wild perfume; Towards the heath, towards the auburn broom, She leads her well-breath'd terriers: hark! they tell In tuneful notes the villain Reynard's doom; Reynard, who bids his native haunts farewel, While echoing Transport shouts and bursts the vocal dell. “Hark, hark! to cover,” the loud huntsman cries: “Hark, hark! to cover,” mimic echoes sound: “Hark, hark!” the copse thro' all its branches sighs, And “hark!” the distant vales with glad rebound. Aerial music floats o'er all around: The silver-sliding lapse of ling'ring wave, The cheering shout, the serenading hound, All, all, dispel the spleen, the vapours grave, And rouse the hoary carle from his dismantled cave. Here too, when Eve, in faery vestments clad, Usurped the cloudless empire of the sky, Weaving the blue serene with shadows sad, Meanwhile the beams from Hesper's brilliant eye Enamell'd the bright tapestry of the sky; Ev'n here, where pointed lustres trembling play, The chequer'd bosom of the lake heav'd high, Would fairest Fancy close the sober day, While night-flow'rs, mildly coy, their pensive sweets display. How oft, when stretch'd all careless on some bank Where the brisk stream forsook its flow'ry grave, Dawning to life, with dews ambrosial dank, I warbled numbers to each warbling wave, Numbers that bounteous Nature artless gave! I heard the silvery alders whisper low, Poor Philomel in dying dirges rave; I saw, majestic Queen, thy gorgeous show, And moonlight silent sunk with an unusual glow. Twinkling their light heels to the lunar ray, In antic morrice danc'd thy tiny band, Each crown'd with garlands from the jasmine spray, And each a wreath of vi'let in his hand, Varying each feature; while the yellow sand, With little footsteps etch'd, breath'd odours round, And springing amaranths flung incense bland! Delicious mysteries of faery ground, Myst'ries belov'd that erst my cradled visions crown'd! O! there, methought, with Spenser I convers'd, Spenser who sung their rights with magic reed; And tender Otway, too untimely hers'd, Wont with fond pangs to bid my soft heart bleed. There Shakspeare, wond'rous seneschal decreed, Who read each potent meaning of each spell, In glory garb'd my willing foot would lead, And in low gales his solemn genius tell. Ah, dear delightful guests, ah, evermore farewel! But now the busy village-hum is heard: Shy Fancy frighted quits the noon-day crowd; The chanting trav'ller scares the dappled herd, And the shrill lark retires to verdant shroud. This world, and all its creatures, are abroad: Fancy's own fav'rite bird, the linnet, flies. Then cease to tune thy lay, O muse! aloud, Or spread thy tissued dreams to vulgar eyes; None but the minstrel shares the minstrel's ecstasies. THE SHRINE OF SYMPATHY. TO THE HONOURABLE LADY CHARLOTTE RAWDON. Miserere matris, &amp; preces, placidus, pias Patiensque recipe, quoque ucelsum, altius Superi levarunt, mitius lapsos preme. Seneca in Troad. CANTO I. A tender theme I choose. Favoring fair, Chase from my heart the remnants of despair; And gild with loveliest looks my votive lay, While the bright scenes of beauty I display. But chiefly thou, supreme of every art, To touch the feeling or to gain the heart, Rawdon attend; and with propitious smile The dreaded dangers of my task beguile: So shall the muse attempt a nobler flight, And gain perchance the regions of delight; So shall my bosom glow with purer fire, And pant for glory while thine eyes inspire. The cards were gone, piquet and rout no more, And mute the lapdog's bark, and chairman's roar, When sad sighs rending his distracted breast, Henry his guardian spirit thus address'd: “O thou mild minister to all my woe, Whose heav'nly tears with mine congenial flow, Whose hand of down my aching forehead smoothes, Whose silver tongue my lonely musing soothes; O thou, whate'er thy birth, whate'er thy name! With patient ear await a lover's claim; With wonted heat support his drooping form, And all the agonies of grief disarm; While to thy melting breast he pleads his cause, And pleads by fond affection's moving laws. “Full well you know the dear relentless fair That caus'd, but still denies to lull, my care; Full well you know her beauty's matchless grace, And all the sweet destructions of her face; Full well you know the flame that mines my peace.” “Unhappy youth, thy sad complainings cease. Lo! to thy wish for ever prompt I stand, And wait with beating bosom thy demand. Nor let thy manly fortitude decay In midnight mournings, and in sighs by day; For thou the haughty belle, or soon or late, (So 'tis enrolled in the book of Fate) Shalt clasp compliant to thy blissful arms; And clasp for ever, free from all alarms. What though no toast was ever half so proud, No belle so distant to the humble crowd; What though no birth-night ball, with wond'ring eye, E'er view'd so fair a truant from the sky; (For sure earth's mold was all too rough to claim The undulating model of her frame); What though no heiress owns a richer coach? Proceed with courage to the bold approach. Let Ton in glitt'ring fetters chain her mind; Let Folly wen her sight, to toys inclin'd; Let Gaming draw her with a potent card; Let tempting tissues gain her strict regard; Toys, fetters, cards, and tissues, bind in vain: Still you shall master of her heart remain. Gewgaws awhile may 'witch the female sight, But love alone can give a true delight. Think you the jewell'd vest, embroider'd fine, Can give the breast love's genial glow divine? For which would Musidora's feelings fret, A faithful heart, or a gold coronet? Or are the ties of Nature to compare With a gilt chariot, and a Flanders mare? Perchance the venal maid, that strives to please Some ancient baronet with artful ease; And as the vapours of his age disperse; Smiles in his face, and ogles at—his purse; She, she, indeed, may an exalted fate Prefer to comfort and, a small estate: But, lo! the rosy clouds of morning break, And gay Tithona shews her purple cheek: All elfens now the mushroom board forsake, To seek the mazy dell and tangled brake; With speed their acorn-goblets now conceal, And trip the dewy grass with pearly heel: I must away; the lark's shrill bugle sounds ‘All faery elves toward frequented grounds.’” CANTO II. Ye airy vassals of my sov'reign sway, Where'er ye wander wild, or sportive stray; Whether the soft gales court your floating forms, Or Pity calls you in the midst of storms; My voice attend; that voice by all obey'd, And wing your flight to this distinguish'd maid. Some through each nerve the thrill of rapture wind, Some point the keen sensations of her mind, Some stretch the filmy texture of her train; The swift blood pours through each meand'ring vein, The roseate tincture of the cheek combine, The eye-glance burnish with a beam divine, The pearly tear, bright quintessence of dew, In lily-urn with sweetest myrrh imbue; With pleasure teach the azure stream to start: Myself shall guard the passes of the heart. And ye prime rulers of the female life, Who by or vapours bland, or weary strife, Ambrosial slumbers on each lid bestow, And rest the soft cheek on the hand of snow; Pure Tea, and wrangling Whist, oh! grant my pray'r, And send kind visions to the sleeping fair: Before her sight, let minstrels move again, Or livelier dances lead the smiling train; Unreal lords the sparkling ring display, And rival belles quite vanquish'd steal away. Still let the boxes ken her every grace, And prying optics stare her in the face; While beauty's self directs each winning air, And sylphids thread the ringlets of her hair; While thousand lips proclaim her matchless praise, Fans flutter, swordknots shine, and diamonds blaze.” He said, and bade around her couch to close The cloudy curtains of a deep repose: Then fairest dreams arise at his command, And roll successive by his magic wand; From Morpheus' labyrinth of languor drawn, To the dim twilight of her veily lawn. For on her head-dress rapturous they rest, Or sink enamour'd on her heaving breast. A bracelet rich the guardian sprite procur'd, With studs adorn'd, and with a clasp secur'd, Potent (the wond'rous work of hands divine) The thoughts, the words, the actions, to refine, In the most stubborn bosom to implant A fond attention to each alien want; Potent to guide Compassion's barbed dart, And give to Sympathy the liberal heart: Around her arm he bound the brilliant spell, Her arm which could the milk-white meed excel: For white was ev'ry gem's transparent pride, As the swan's plumage on the silver tide; Or Cynthia's modest front, adorning high The blue pavilion of the starry sky, When negro Night but spreads a glitt'ring gloom, And sleeks with melting gales her raven-plume. Sleep on, proud nymph, regardless of the pain Thy rare perfections cause full many a swain, Who seeks to lose thee in the silent shade, Or greet thee now with softest serenade: “Blest syren, form'd to lure each breast from peace, When will the witch'ry of thy beauty cease? Bright star, design'd to wreck th' incautious crew, When will thine eyes no more thy prey pursue? When wilt thou learn to clear thy haughty brow, When hear the crowds that to thine altars bow?” Thus they, unconscious of their idol's state, Just on the brink of wedlock and of fate: For ere the blushes of the East appear, Or blackbird warbles to young Morning's ear, Her cruel vows are broke, her conquests o'er, And Hymen enters at the open door. So, when ten years their tedious lapse had told, And chiefs who came in youth were now grown old, When Time himself was ready to destroy, Fell the huge tow'rs of heav'n-defended Troy. CANTO III. My course pursue, while I, unerring, guide Thy wat'ry way o'er Envy's wrecking tide; Where plies a grisly ferryman his bark, Whose sails are scandals, and surmises dark, That wing with swiftest flight the liquid plain, But plunge poor wretches in the sable main, While anxious friends in vain may strive to save, And innocence scarce struggles with the wave; For at one dash the winds of malice urge The fainting carcase with the boiling surge, And the most gallant vessel, soonest lost, With shatter'd trophies strews Contention's coast. Yet now we're past: the billows rage no more, And bless'd Perfection gains the welcome shore. O'er yonder realm the nymph Indifference reigns, Queen of all ancient prudes, and silly swains, She views without emotion navies sink, And trav'llers stand on deep Destruction's brink; Deep learn'd in French, though seldom seen in France, She tattles of sans froid and nonchalance; And when her lovers die, with modest air And flippant phrase she sighs: “The de'l may care.” Pride is her worthy minister of state; Bold Fashion now exalts her plumed pate; And Routs, quaint daughters of old Madam Spleen! Are maids of honour to the well-lov'd Queen. Philosophy here studies toys of brass; The art Linnean pores on braided grass, And Poetry too rhymes with half an eye, “Indifferent in her choice, to print or die;” While mild Critique, with pigeon-heart essays A panegyric on the poorest lays; Nor minds, with milk of human kindness full, Whether the work is eminent or dull. We've cross'd her kingdom now; for, lo! I see Our wish'd-for end, the shrine of Sympathy. Ledinia, mark what various figures stand Obedient to the sculptor's forming hand: Some weep, reclining o'er a wreathed urn, Some in dumb agony expressive mourn; While some, in dire extravagance of woe, Bid from the marble trickling torrents flow. Behold yon prospect of excelling grief, Where destitute of any kind relief A lovely damsel, in the bloom of age, Languid resigns her to the ocean's rage, Till a fond youth from the tremendous steep Despairing plunges on the flashing deep, And while the humid sparkles gleam around, To save her drowning, is himself the drown'd! Clasp'd in embrace the hapless lovers lie, While o'er their cold grave sobbing zephyrs sigh. Through the red ruins of the ruthless flame, To save his friend, along yon burning beam How forces Edward his resistless way, While death's dire forms th'heroic deed repay? But, oh! where Calpe's hideous heights arise, Where conflagration mingles with the skies, There Sympathy erects her lofty throne, And claims the godlike Britons for her own, While through the ruddy war they rush to save The fainting Spaniards from the fiery wave. Hail, sacred passion! hail, celestial glow, That lends the hand of mercy to a foe; That nobly ardent, with a gen'rous flame, Mak'st friendship and hostility the same; That shew'st the thoughts of an exalted breast, Where Nature's self benignant stands confess'd! Long may men cherish the immortal heat, While soft souls feel themselves more truly great! On that pure throne, magnetic structure, where Sweet Sympathy is seated, charming fair, Thine eye-balls turn, and view the needle roll, True to her heart as to the faithful pole: “She speaks to thee!” mild Ariel rejoin'd, (For so the fay was titled by mankind.) “Blest Queen,” the alter'd belle extatic cry'd, “Blest Queen, my pensive joy, my bosom's pride, To thy best pow'r I bow, to thee import The sway, the conquest of my milden'd heart. For thee I bid the giddy world farewel, For thee who all the tricks of ton excel; And take, my varied turn of mind to prove, The man of merit to my constant love. Come, Henry, come.”—“Enough,” the sprite exclaim'd, Thy soul the fire of Pity has inflam'd; Thy humid eye with tears the goddess arms, And gives new graces to thy bright'ning charms. My charge is o'er.” He said, and stole away, Forth from the hollow bracelet where he lay. Quick when he flew, a band of sylphids rear The beaming sorcery sublime in air; And as it rose, in jewell'd letters flame, Those words divine around the glitt'ring frame, “From this device, unfeeling mortals learn, That Pity always must to Goodness turn.” AN ESSAY ON WIT. This poem was written at the age of 14. Indoctè, doctique scribimus passim. ?“Those who cannot write, and those who can, All rhyme, and scrawl, and scribble, to a man.” Pope. Hor. Of all the fools with frantic learning curst, Sure the quaint pedant is supremely worst: Who, ev'ry dawn of fancy's ray denied, Fills the huge volume of scholastic pride With deep surmises, classically fit, Yet far remov'd from elegance or wit; Who sums up every trace of Latian lore, And says what graver blockheads said before; Wrests from vindictive Time the mould'ring bust, And wipes from monkish tomes their ancient dust, To pore on pages which some madman wrote, Guiltless of wit, and innocent of thought. Go thou, desirous of the scholiast mine, Who wishest sense from logic to refine; Go, and improve on Maro's rural lay, Or mark his muse the epic pomp display: Peruse sweet Victa's imitative art, And feel the flame of rapture in thy heart; For he with candid niceness probes the wound, Nor taints the bay around his temple bound; He, the glad bard of Leo's golden reign, Rejects the cowl, and plans the tuneful strain, To papal ear attunes the Mantuan reed; Or bids with nobler pangs the bosom bleed.— Each brilliant beauty of each line explore, And then consult old Scaliger no more. Some may perchance with too much caution heed My liberal precepts, and quite cease to read. But no such stupid rule my soul approves: Let each peruse the author that he loves; With smiling Flaccus all his leisure spend, Or to proud Tully's copious speech attend, Till Admiration, satiate with delight, Forgets this world, and thinks all trouble light. But let not Dulness' leaden sons intrude, To mar the calm symposion of the good; To blot the fine sensations of the mind For strains of classic purity inclin'd; O'er the free breast their Gothic clouds to shed, And chase the projects of the heart and head. Keep me, oh! keep me from the pedant beau, That mortal frightfullest of frights below, Who oft disturbs the minstrel's holy rest, And breaks his scull to break a foolish jest; Damns every work of merit or of wit, To reign perpetual censor of the pit. Ah! wretch abhorr'd by ev'ry gen'rous soul, Mixture uncouth of monkey and of owl, How can your plaudit ever meet success, Who when you please us most, but please us less? In vain the dark saliva on thy tongue Wrong turns to right, and right transforms to wrong; Though stunn'd by Malice and her hideous peal, Still we assert our thoughts, and still we feel. Hail glorious freedom of the purer soul, Above the muffled murderer's base control, Who stabs the guiltless bosom with a smile, And bathes the wound with vinegar, not oil; Who nips young Merit in her primal bloom, And scatters to the wind the sweet perfume Which Attic bees with honey'd lip exhal'd, Till the green bud felt his cold hand, and fail'd! Lo! squint-ey'd Malice triumphs still elate O'er luckless Chatterton's disastrous fate; Still shews, insensible, that matchless youth, Nor dares to vindicate his fame by truth. Wit, like true beauty, needs no foreign aid: Each nat'ral lustre has a nat'ral shade. But some, unconscious of her native grace, Deck her, like belles, with tinsel and with lace That glare a while in Folly's garish ray,— But, seen through Judgment's optic, fade away. Beware false ornaments, for all expect Such care exorbitant must hide defect. The gaudy style, the prim conjunction shun: They make true wit a quibble or a pun; They sink the sense beneath the jingling sound That labours like a mole to burst the ground, But all in vain; while leaden Dulness throws New cumbrances on verse, new chains on prose, Till like a cart creaks the rough rumbling song, And Prose scarce trails her period-length along. Long in the mine the beamy diamond lies, Hid by the conscious earth from mortal eyes; But when the sun, with all-reviving light, Flings his hot ray, and summons it to sight, Then twinkling gleams around it glitt'ring play, Till the full lustre burst upon the day. So should true wit emerge by slow degrees, And suit each taste with unaffected ease; Sport round the heart, in frolic mazes rove, And 'stead of baleful Hate, awaken Love. But without fancy, how can wit appear, Or modulate its tone to ev'ry ear? Fancy, fair Empress of the Elfin shore, Who, deeply versed in legendary lore, “Could glance from earth to heav'n, from heav'n to earth,” And give to contraries a mutual birth; Whence, mingling in one blaze the magic light, Springs real wit, the soul's refin'd delight. Think you, did Fancy carelessly desert, In peevish mood, the courtly Roman's heart, When to his touch awoke the silver chord, And great Augustus hung on ev'ry word? Did Fancy, smiling sorceress, discard, For witless dunces, fair Belinda's bard, When mimic battles swell his sportive page, And sylphs with sylphs contend in epic rage? Did she not bless mild Parnell's ev'ning hour, And on each line her brightest influence show'r? What has she, in her high profusion done For frolic Swift, sweet Gay, and manly Addison? And Judgment too, a sage severe, must come, With envious shears to prune the hasty bloom; Exub'rant Nature's embryo buds to form, And bid them rise superior to the storm. For as the sire his infant race must chide, To check wild Folly's growth, or Genius' pride, Yet nurse each darling in his aged breast, And leave to powerful Nature all the rest: So must keen Judgment, with a candid hand, Expel each weed from Wit's luxuriant land; Or, when in seemly rows the flow'rs arise, View the soft offspring with a parent's eyes. Matured by his sage skill, the roots remain, And mock the summer sun, and wint'ry rain; While weaker natives, though of gaudier form, Droop ev'ry leaf, and close each fading charm. And lo, what troops o'erspread th' ideal plain! Riddles, acrostics, crotchets of the brain; Rude sons of folly on false taste begot, Abhorr'd by genius, and devoid of thought. What motley patches on each garb are seen! How leaps each quibble, like a harlequin! Charades, the last in modish grandeur march, With garments varying as the wat'ry arch, When o'er the heav'n it spreads a glitt'ring dye, Yet fading disappoints the curious eye. Chief of the band a pigmy warrior comes; Sound forth, yon jackalls, to the deaf'ning drums: At every step a hundred feet he gets, At every look his tongue incessant frets, Till o'er the plain his giant-bulk descends, And each hoarse word the vocal welkin rends. “What can this monster be?” some belle exclaims, While her own bosom feels his mining flames. Know, beauteous maid (if such peruse my song), This wicked contrariety is Ton: Ton, the fierce pest from Gallia's hated shore, Ton, the great king of ev'ry knave and whore, Who sanctifies the gamester's curs'd pretence, And raises fashion on the throne of sense. But change the theme from folly's tinsel train To the great masters of th' instructive strain; Who, still unconscious of each meaner claim, Exalt their country to applause and fame. Nor I the last in glory's godlike course, To lash a vicious age with nervous force; Or, rising to a pitch supremely high'r, Cast a bold hand around the living lyre; To rescue poesy from every fool, And break the privilege of being dull. How many a blockhead, with undoubted might, Has borne the laurels of the wordy fight, Who free from taste, true elegance, or wit, Has rack'd his well-squeezed numskull while he writ; Or, low'ring high in Grub-street's airy site, Spent for a wretched pun the livelong night? How many a genius, taught to nobler views, Endow'd with every blessing of the muse, Through fortune's frown, or by some patron's curse, Has lost ignobly both the palm and purse? Witness a Smart, At that time it was Dermody's intention to have given a complete collection of Smart's poems; their merit is very well known. to hast'ning ills a prey, The greedy dun unmindful of his say: On Cam's smooth brink the Nine their fav'rite led, Yet, ah! how destitute of praise, and bread! Some mind congenial may espouse his cause, Some mind above the critic's meaner laws. But what avails the plaudit of the few, If they their empty praise alone renew? The dark-brow'd bookseller's auspicious smile, Excels their talk, and soothes the author's toil; For spite of all our high-brain'd tricks, the muse Must sip more solid food than slight Castalian dews. Witness a Brooke, whose pen could once assert The patriot's right, and warm each lib'ral heart; How sunk his fame, with every honour dead! How all his glory's living-lustre fled! Taught to despise the envious crowd that swill Coarse rapture from the Heliconian rill, He knew the minstrel's duty to attend, Nor in the close observer lose the friend: Yet ah! how low the echo of his name! How dumb the trump of canonizing fame! Thus far, my Berwick, The Reverend Mr. Berwick, then chaplain to the Countess of Moira. To this gentleman Dermody has paid no fulsome compliment, for his kindness to him in a singular case requires a much stronger assertion of gratitude. When friendship turned with the tide of fashion and party, he alone remained immoveable to its arbitrary command, and supported the title of a real friend. have I strain'd the theme, While friendship's energy exalts the flame. O thou, my patron, my resplendent pride, Guide my weak bark across the boist'rous tide; Allay the blasts of malice, while the gale Of fav'ring rapture swells my little sail; And, oh! if e'er tow'rds danger's rock I stray, Chide my fond soul, and point the surer way; While, proudly rising o'er the foaming flood, I steer exulting with the great and good. Nor thou despise the shepherd's first essay, Who decks with rigid rules his rural lay; For though the reed was e'er unwont to sound The court's gay talents and its gaudy round, Yet by degrees a nobler note may swell: First we must meditate, and then excel. Those who with nice disgust, and envy sharp, Start at the uncouth tinkling of my harp; Let them (for such there are) attaint my bays, And scoff at youthful glory's dawning rays; Let them the hour of noon-tide radiance wait, And kneel before the sun that they must hate. The bard how blameful who neglects himself, While fed for silence or by pride or pelf; Who casts the rod of satire quite aside, And gives to greatness what a god supply'd! Enough for me (for I defy the great— I mean the abject vassals of the state), That princely Rawdon Those great personages, eminent in their respective stations, are too much admired to admit of any peculiar commendation here. They were unwearied patrons of the unfortunate Dermody, while he lived. Their encouragement to genius is admired, but seldom imitated. will my lay peruse; Rawdon, who guards the poet and his muse. Enough for me that Moira deigns to clear, The clouds of malice magnified by fear; Which round my head their foul contagion flung, While party's fiends yell'd louder as I sung. Enough for me, that you review my toil With partial warmth, and friendship's glowing smile. Here let me pay to worth a tribute due: To Boyd The reverend Hugh Boyd. The amiable character of this worthy gentleman, deserves as much praise as can be offered to merit and benevolence. Dermody esteemed it one of the happiest circumstances of his life, that he had received (though indeed but for a short time) his instructions, in matters of classical, poetical, and theological tendency. He is the author and translator of many classical and esteemed works; and till Dante shall cease to charm, the name of Boyd will be revered by the lovers of poesy. who bade my artless soul pursue True learning's track, with viny wreaths o'erhung; Who form'd the first faint accents of my tongue; Who mark'd with classic neatness each weak line, And bade bold nature's dregs to wit refine. He the best teacher of the song sublime, For he himself can “build the lofty rhime.” Nor has his page escap'd the ken of Fame, His page anneal'd with Alghieri's name. From Tuscan shores his muse exulting flies, And draws a train of light aslant the skies; With fierce Orlando's martial fame returns, While ev'ry breast with expectation burns. Again Astolfo's horn shall swell the line; Again Rinaldo's prowess grow divine; Again whole turms Troops. display the glitt'ring shield, And murder stalk o'er Ronscesvallis' field. Proceed; thou best, last bard, proceed, And at Fame's temple claim thy glorious meed; Claim the best meed to real merit due, And the great tale of Eugene's Eugene, a poem, which reflects honour on Ireland, both as the production and the subject are of its growth. acts pursue; The wondrous story weave in fancy's loom, And let the wizard dyes eternal bloom; Give to the hero all the hero asks, And crown with lasting rapture all thy tasks; So shall I once thy full-grown honours see, Nor blush to boast that I have sung for thee. CORYDON. A MONODY. In this Monody the author, a youth of ten years of age, bewails the death of his brother, who died of the small-pox, anno 1785, ætatis seven. What dire misfortune hovers o'er my head? Why hangs the salt dew on my aching eye? Why doth my bosom pant, so sad, so sore, That was full blithe before?— Bitter occasion prompts th' untimely sigh; Why am I punish'd thus, ye angels! why? A shepherd swain like me, of harmless guise, Whose sole amusement was to feed his kine, And tune his oaten pipe the livelong day,— Could he in aught offend th' avenging skies, Or wake the red-wing'd thunderbolt divine? Ah! no: of simple structure was his lay; Yet unprofan'd with trick of city art, Pure from the head and glowing from the heart.— Thou dear memorial of a brother's love, Sweet flute, once warbled to the list'ning grove, And master'd by his skilful hand, How shall I now command The hidden charms that lurk within thy frame, Or tell his gentle fame? Yet will I hail, unmeet, his star-crown'd shade; And beck his rural friends, a tuneful throng, To mend the uncouth lay, and join the rising song. Ah! I remember well yon oaken arbour gay, Where frequent at the purple dawn of morn, Or 'neath the beetling brow of twilight grey, We sate, like roses twain upon one thorn, Telling romantic tales, of descant quaint, Tinted in various hues with fancy's paint: And I would hearken, greedy of his sound, Lapt in the bosom of soft ecstacy, Till, lifting mildly high Her modest frontlet from the clouds around, Silence beheld us bruise the closing flow'rs, Meanwhile she shed her pure ambrosial show'rs. O Shannon! thy embroider'd banks can tell How oft we stray'd beside thy amber wave, With ozier rods arching thy wizard stream, Or weaving garlands for thy liquid brow. Ah me! my dearest partner seeks the grave; The ruthless grave, extinguisher of joy. Fond Corydon, scarce ripen'd into boy, Where shall I ever find thy pleasing peer? My task is now (ungrateful task, I ween!) To cull the choicest offspring of the year, With myrtles mix'd, and laurels varnish'd bright; And, scatt'ring o'er thy hillock green The poor meed, greet the gloom of night. Ye healing Pow'rs, that range the velvet mead, Exhaling the fresh breeze from Zephyr's bow'r, Oh! where, in that unhappy hour, Where did you fly from his neglected head? Health, thou mountain maid of sprightliest cheek, Ah! why not cool his forehead meek? Why not in his blest cause thy pow'r display, And chase the fell disorder far away? For he erewhile, most lovely of thy train, Wont the entangled wood to trace, Would hear the jocund horn, and join the chase: Till thou relinquish'dst him to grief and pain, E'en in the bloom of flourishing age; And Death, grim tyrant, from his plague-drawn car Espied the horrid Fury's ruthless rage, Then wing'd his ebon shaft, and stopp'd the ling'ring war. Yet cease to weep, ye swains; for if no cloud Of thwarting influence mar my keener sight, I mark'd a stranger star, serenely bright, Burst from the dim inclosure of a shrowd. 'Twas Corydon! a radiant circlet bound His brow of meekness; and the silver sound, Shook from his lyre, of gratulations loud, Smooth'd the unruffled raven-plume of Night.”— Thus chanted the rude youth his past'ral strain, While the cold earth his playmate's bosom press'd. And now the sun, slow westing to the main, Panted to give his wearied coursers rest; The azure-curtains took a crimson stain, And Thetis shone, in golden garments drest. The shepherd-minstrel bent his homeward way, And brush'd the dew-drops from the glitt'ring spray. RUMINATIONS ON A DECAYED MONASTERY. Here, where the pale grass struggles with each wind, Pregnant with form the turf unheeded lies; Here the fat abbot sleeps, in ease reclin'd, And here the meek monk folds his modest eyes. The nun, more chaste than bolted snow, Mingles with the dust below, Nor capricious turns away. Lo! to the taper's tremulous ray White veil'd shades their frames disclose, Vests of lily, cheeks of rose; In dim Fancy's vision seen, Alive, awake, they rush between. Ah! who so cruel, in eternal gloom To close the sweetest workmanship of God; In cloister'd aisles to waste their heav'nly bloom, And dull their bright eyes in the drear abode? Not real penance claim'd them here; Nor lowliness, with melting tear: But Superstition, fiend deform, Sent forth the persecuting storm, And in a charnel's baleful arms Enclos'd the virgin's with'ring charms; Despotic rul'd the fearful band, Pray'r and despondence in his hand,— His own right hand, that seem'd to wield Heav'n's lightning, and Oppression's shield. Poor tremblers! all your griefs are o'er: Beads deep-murmur'd tire no more; Pageants dress'd in pious guise, Lank fasts, and pity-pouring eyes, All, all eclips'd and sunk! Those stones, 'Scutcheon'd with rude gigantic bones, Shew the tyrant zealot's end, And where his schemes of power tend. Near pebbled beds, where riv'lets play, And linger in the beams of day; 'Mid sods by kneeling martyrs worn, Embrown'd with many a horrid thorn, On whose branches off'rings fade, (Proof of vows devoutly paid;) Where the owlet shrieking hides, Cov'ring with leaves his ragged sides; Wont the solemn bell to flow In silver notes, prolonging slow Tides of matchless melody, Rousing the friar to secret glee; While the vot'ries creep along, And, half-unwilling, join the throng, Their fates depending on his word, Own'd of their breasts almighty lord:— Yes, let them slumber here at last, Their tyrannies, their suff'rings past; And lend a venerable dread To the lone abbey's rocking head. ON TRAVELLING. Whate'er of wonder Art of Nature fram'd, For giant strength or pigmy graces fam'd. Oh, let me scan, while Life's short changes last, Pant for the future, and enjoy the past; Oh! thus, while smiling years all-fav'ring roll, Compact my body and expand my soul!— Who, like a worm, in one dull spot would crawl, Nor view with curious eye this lovely ball? Who would not wish, with sacred knowledge smit, To read that page the God of Wisdom writ? Who would not nicely mark each varied hue Of that fair scene the God of Beauty drew? Painter immensely grand, minutely fine, Whose pictures live and flourish as they shine. Whether Killarney's silver-rolling tide, Howth's vernal crest, or Antrim's rocky pride, Entranc'd we view,—the silent rapture glows, And Nature trembles at the work she shews. Who would not fathom Etna's burning womb? Who would not thread old Arden's devious gloom? Who would not tread where dauntless Scipio trod? Who would not trace the long disfigur'd god, Whose mould'ring bust, once crown'd with many a rose, With many a festive myrtle, wants a nose; While lurks in shades uncouth the Paphian queen, And Hermes sticks two Christian saints between? The serious smile their sportive dooms excite, And classic wit laughs loudly at the sight: Nor is the useless moral cast away;— Lo, Grandeur crumbling to a little clay! THE SENSITIVE LINNET. My fond social linnet, to thee What dear winning charms did belong! On my hand thou wouldst carol with glee, On my bosom attend to my song. Sweet bird, in return for my strain, Thou warbled'st thy own o'er again. Love, jealous a bird should thus share My affections, shot speedy his dart: To my swain now I sung ev'ry air; The linnet soon took it to heart. Sweet bird, in how plaintive a strain Thou warbled'st thy own jealous pain! But faithless my lover I found; And in vain to forget him I tried: The linnet perceiv'd my heart's wound; He sicken'd, he droop'd, and he died. Sweet bird, why to death yield the strain? Thy song would have lighten'd my pain. Dear linnet, I'll pillow thy head; In down will I coffin thy breast; And when thy sad mistress is dead, Together in peace we will rest. Sweet bird, how ill-fated our strain! We shall warble, alas! ne'er again. ADVICE TO TWO ADOPTED SISTERS. Dear girls, in youth and beauty's prime Despise not friendship's graver rhyme; Friendship, that marks your early bloom Perfection's brightest tints assume. The tints of modest worth divine, When sense and harmless wit combine, Prompt each low passion to control, Or bind in rosy chains the soul. Oh, ever-charming! let not Pride, Usurper bold, your breasts divide, Nor fashion beauteous nature hide; Assur'd your soft eyes' radiant hue Can heal, disturb, and conquer too; Oh! let not Affectation, queen Of the nice lisp, the mincing mien, And studied glance, obscure their rays, Blighting the bloomy wreath of praise. Yet, sure, this idly-moral strain Is both presumptuous and vain; For well your tender hearts I know; Hearts formed to melt at every woe, Virtue to soothe, vice to chastise, And shine in bounteous pity wise.— Yet num'rous is the tinsel race That hover round a lovely face, As round the candle's beamy blaze Their brother-insect wildly plays. When by those ideot suitors prest, 'Mid the gay flatt'rers falsely blest, Ador'd, and borne by sighs, you move On the frail, floating, clouds of love; When fell Deceit, in angel guise, True demon, plans the pleasing lies; Look round, and if you haply see No honest face—oh! think on me. THE POET'S PETITION TO APOLLO. Scarce fourteen summers crown my age, And yet on life's oft-varied stage (Such are the hapless poet's losses) I've met with fourteen thousand crosses. Debts; duns; proud patrons all so squeamish, Who damn one for a single blemish; Malice, with blinking eye and shrug, Rooting the grave fond Pity dug; Suspence, on courtier's promise waiting, “Like Patience on a monument;” Envy, that darling imp of Satan; Poetic pique, and discontent: Full many a bitter pinch ye gave me; From which, O god Apollo, save me! No more beneath some guardian wing I tune my little pipe, and sing; No more tied by the leg I flutter, Hop but in sight, nor dare to mutter; O'er the wild fields of ether free, I now cry Vive la liberté! And though my nest I have not feather'd, I have at least experience gather'd: That rudder of good conduct, guiding To a calm port where Age may ride in; Till call'd aloft at cherubs' whistle, To try if he has wisely mist ill; And, without boast or flourish pompous Kept honour as his star and compass. That I have never seen the child Of injur'd merit weep, and smil'd; That I have never heard the poor Sigh out their plaints, and clos'd the door; That I have never wish'd to wrong The good man in satiric song; Bear witness Heav'n, that know'st my heart, And now, oh! take thy minstrel's part. Like sad Darius, bruis'd and beaten 'Mong those by whom his goods were eaten; Like Belisarius (poor fellow!) Drest up in rags black, blue, and yellow; Like grave Cervantes in a jail; Like Butler, without soothing ale; Like Tasso praying, in the night, His cat's clear eyes to lend him light; Like Chatterton, who sung so sweet; Like princely The'dore in the Fleet; Like Tippoo Saib by strangers plunder'd; Like—like—ah me, sirs! like a hundred; Behold Tom Dermody quite humbled, From Fortune's wheel (the gipsey) tumbled: Petitioning, in paltry verses, Great George's head-piece from long purses. For he, unlike disloyal brothers, Loves his king's head above all others. And shall I now with formal scrape, The muse low-curt'seying like an ape, Your pardon for this trifle beg, Dash off some lies and make a leg? By Phœbus, no! Consult your breast, Where all the soft-ey'd feelings rest, Each tender passion search with care, My best apology is there. THE VISION OF KILLEIGH CHURCH. As through the churchyard path I rov'd, The mould'ring turrets stagg'ring shook; The stones in ruin'd row remov'd, Out flew the owl, and lonely rook. In antique garb of Erin's loom, Such as on moss-grown tomb is seen, A rev'rend spirit trod the gloom, With venerably-pensive mien: A broken cross adorn'd his head. Which shew'd the blossoms of decay; His sighs a holy stillness shed: At last I heard him softly say: “Alas! where are my glitt'ring tow'rs, My seats where mournful sinners pray'd; Where rosy abbots pass'd their hours, And comforted the bashful maid? “No silver bell with heav'nly call, Sounds sweetly through the rocking spire; No Peter-pence from rich men fall; No symptoms of religious fire. “The solitary curate too Pipes his long sermon through the aisles; Preaches to each deserted pew; And sees no penitence, but smiles. “The clerk alone, a merry wight, With shrill note bids the echoes ring; Fills every bosom with delight, And carols louder than a king. “Nor is he pliant to each rite: More glad would he the tankard swill; Attentive to some ancient fight, Of Boyne, Belleisle, or Bunker's-hill. “Perhaps, as with sonorous shake He startles the low-murm'ring reeds, His thoughts excursive rove on Blake, Or Oliver's ungracious deeds. “The Dean, good man! is seldom here To glaze the window's nitrous pane, The aged widow's cry to hear, For this sort of rhime, Dermody had the authority of Pope. A joke on Jekyl, or some good old Whig Who never chang'd his principle nor wig. Or whistle some facetious strain. “Last week he stript my arching glass, Through which the dim sun sweetly shone; With relics heap'd his loaded ass, And claim'd the trophies as his own. “Ah, that the frame whose tender light Illum'd the nun's sequester'd cell, Should blaze, ill-doom'd, the wintry night, And bid its long-lost post farewell! “The dome where sceptred monarchs knelt, And crested chiefs with virtuous look; Where high-born dames persuasion felt; Now howls o'er B? and Mrs. C?. “How fall'n, that bumpkins should be kept In that same honour'd sacred pew Where great Macdermot pious slept, Or Rod'rick cough'd with Brian Borooh! “But hark! I hear my brothers call, To raise some soul from purgatory.”— Away he swept in tarnish'd pall, And here I choose to end my story. HYMN TO SHAKSPEARE. Sweet offspring of nature, soft rebel to art, Whom Fancy gave passions, and Pity a heart, From thine Avon repair on the wings of delight, And gild with thy glories the horrors of night. Thy Ariel will light up his glow-worms, to shew Thy rapturous path to a mortal below; Thy Ob'ron will bid all his small subjects fly, And revel and trip to the glance of thine eye; While the weird sisters vanish from off the wild heath, And cowslips and eglantines spring forth beneath. The moon shall delay to illumine the East, And thy glad inspiration reign full o'er my breast: My breast that shall glow with pure thoughts evermore. And the secrets of feeling, of laughter, explore; Pour joy o'er the earth, if envigour'd by thee, And pay every rite to thy mulberry-tree. JOHN BAYNHAM'S EPITAPH. This man was the parish-clerk of Killeigh, and the merry friend and sociable companion of Dermody. Here lieth Hercules the Second, A penman fine by critics reckon'd; With back so huge, and brawny neck on't, And shrewdish head, Which oft to smoking hotpot beckon'd: John Baynham's dead. Woes me! no more shall younkers crowd About thy hearth, and gabble loud; Where thou, in magistracy proud, Nought humbly said: Alas! we never thought thee good Till thou wast dead. Though, by my soul! still sober, mellow, I ken'd thee aye a special fellow, Catches or psalm-staves prompt to bellow, O pious breed! I ween thou'rt fixt 'tween heav'n and hell: oh! Our comfort's dead. But for that plaguy profligate, We early might enjoy and late The knowledge of thy teeming pate From board to bed: But now thour't 'neath a puny slate; Droll Johnny's dead. Full many a hard bout hast thou weather'd: By merry Bob severely tether'd; More sadly than if tarr'd and feather'd, Like bull-dog led: Now all my tools are fairly gather'd; Blythe Baynham's dead. Heav'n lend thy soul its surest port, And introduce thee to the court; Revive again thy earthly sport, And melt thy lead! Alas! we mourn; for, by the mort! John Baynham's dead. No curate now can work thy throat, And alter clean thy jocund note; Charon has plump'd thee in his boat, And run a-head: My curse on death, the meddling sot! Gay Johnny's dead. With gills of noblest usquebaugh Will we anoint thy epitaph; While thou at the full bowl shalt laugh, A precious meed: At last thou liest in harbour safe; Sage Johnny's dead. News shall no more thy mornings muzzle, Or schemes good spirit-punch to guzzle; Wounds! thou art past this mortal bustle, With manna fed; Satan and thou hadst a long tussel; At last thou'rt dead. May blessings light upon thy gloom, And geese grow fat upon thy tomb! While no rash scribbler's impious thumb Shall maul thy head; But greet thee soft ‘in kingdom come,’ Though thou art dead. POSTSCRIPT. After inditing these sad stories, I hap'd to hear some brother tories Ranting and roaring loud at Lory's, Lory was another of his associates. He kept a public-house; where the tradesmen of the village assembled, with the parish-clerk John Baynham, and Dermody as their oracle. Not quite well bred; I enter'd, and exclaim'd, ‘Ye glories, John Baynham's dead.’ Scarce had I spoke, when 'neath the table Something sigh'd out most lamentable: Anon, to make my song a fable, Starts out brave John; Sitting, by Jove above! most stable On wicked throne. They press'd my sitting: marv'lous dull, I gap'd at Banquo like a fool, And cried ‘Good sirs, the table's full, And there's a spirit,’ ‘Come reach,’ quoth sprite, ‘an easy stool:’ And lent a wherret. ‘You rogue,’ said he, ‘how dare you write Such stuff on me, as dead outright; I think, by this good candle-light, You've earn'd a drubbing.’ ‘Pho! peace,’ said I, ‘I'll blot it quite; Aye, by St. Dobbin.’ Witness therefore, by my small finger, John chooses still on earth to linger, As penman, poet, toper, singer, In trade full thriving; Know then, old bellman, barber, tinker, John Baynham's living. WILL GORMAN, THE KILLEIGH WEAVER. A piteous elegy, indeed, Endited sad on gabbling Gorman; Who, from his loom and shuttle freed, Took voyage for the Stygian shore, man. So dapper was he in his size, That midnight gossips would surmise Some fay did blind his mother's eyes, And stint him short; Yet would he merry tales devise With mickle Much. sport. The Killeigh Mercury he was, To pen songs on the corner-cross; Or lay them on the pump across, With cautious look. I'faith, we have a piteous loss, Since he forsook. When o'er his loom the great mon Man. sat, He'd verses make on this or that, On Norah's stockings, Nelly's hat, Or Nancy's garters; Or satires pen black as my hat, And cut in quarters. Not Hudibras himself was greater In forging Babylonish metre; Rebus he'd fix on any creature, And ne'er the worse: I think his numscull was completer Stor'd than his purse. Know then (for him you'll ne'er ken more, man), Here lies the shell-work of Will Gorman. A LAMENTABLE ELEGY ON NICHOLAS, THE KILLEIGH TAYLOR. Thy namesake Old Nick (as we say). saw thy worth at last; And took thee, faith, as a dead cast: Thy revels and thy routs are past, Ill-fated Nichol; Auld don The old Don (explained in the preceding note). thy carcase threw with haste Into his pickle. Now you may deck the prince of soot With goodly clothes from head to foot, I ween he wants a new recruit; For since his fall He's got no tolerable suit, But an old pall. Much good may this new custom do thee! May the coquettes of lowland woo thee, And am'rous scratch thy cheeks so ruddy With tooth and nail; And when thou enter'st on thy study, Bid thee all-hail! Cæsar may want thy aid, sir, there; Or Alexander, the great bear, Pawn his lank knapsack in despair, To get thee credit: For authors say, queer clothes they wear, As you may read it. We'll give thee joy of thy free trade. May'st thou by Satan be well paid: And never be by duns dismay'd; Save now and then, By some fair brimstone-blooded jade!— John says, ‘Amen.’ What pompous words thy tongue adorn'd! For monosyllables were scorn'd. Full many a husband hast thou horn'd; For which sweet sport, Forefend you be not now suborn'd In Pluto's court! At Andrew's shall thy praise remain, While ale is made of malt and grain, While Johnnie trembles at the dean: Ev'n, Nic, so long Shall bards thy hapless fate complain In lofty song. What though the Killeigh knell be broke? Kind memory shall thy name invoke, And every jovial heart of oak Inscribe thy stone With epitaphs, at whose each stroke The De'il wou'd groan. Fu' long shall Marks thy merit tell, And Hugh recount thy gambols well: For in sly pranks thou bor'st the bell, And wouldst succeed; Whilst Gragueall Marks and Gragueall, two of his village friends. cries, in sad farewell, ‘Nick Surlock's dead.’ O matchless taylor, whose bra Brave, fine. clothes Would swathe Dress. so fine the country beaus! Must death thus take thee by the nose, And pinch it red; While boys resound, in tuneful woes, ‘Our taylor's dead?’ When the old surly haughre Death. came, Why didst thou not defend thy fame; His dog's-ears with thy scissars maim, Or hurl thy goose? Ah, no! poor wight, thou went'st quite tame Into his noose. ‘Done-over taylor, art thou now: A cold stone on thy weam below, Knock'd by thy rude carniv'rous foe Upon the head; Ah! soon shall ill-made garments shew, Nice Nick is dead. THE DEATH OF POOR DAVIE, THE KILLEIGH PIPER. Come all ye jolly folks of Killeigh, And ponder on the tale I tell ye: Relinquish Susan, Kate, and Nelly, And droop the head; Grim Death has stopt your piper's gullie; Throat. Poor Davie's dead. Wae's me! no more shall thy stuff'd pudding Bagpipe. Set heels quick stamping on a sudden, And fill the hearts of Giles and Cudden With huge delight: Just when the rose of life was budding, Came a fell blight. Oft have I heard your windy music Till it would make both me and you sick, And drunk the beer of Goody Cusack Till darkness fled; Now on your grave I must a yew stick; Poor Davie's dead! When Death, the gilligapus, stole To pluck away thy gabby soul, Had'st thou inspir'd thy tuneful hole With skilful head, He would have run like silly-foal; But now thou'rt dead. Southerne shall strew thy coal-black hearse With epic Hudibrastic verse; Thy praise in lofty lays rehearse, And blath'ring rhyme; Wow, Ah me, alas. he thy future fame shall nurse In scrawls sublime. To greyhound's tail he'll tie A custom he used to put in practice. thy glory, And propagate the rev'rend story: Fam'd as the famous John-a-Dory, His song shall save ye; And tell to trimmer, whig, and tory, Hic jacet Davie. At wedding dinner when thou'st been, With breeches red and cravat clean, How thou would's tune thy engine keen; And, droning loudly, Set cats, maids, dogs, upon the green. A prancing proudly! Then, when the sheepskin cloth was spread, Grasp at the bacon white and red, Against the tankard knock thy head, Or spill the gravy; While younkers laugh'd at a' you said, Right hum'rous Davie. Around thy tomb shall May-maids revel, Scatt'ring sweet flow'rs to scare the devil, And keep thy corse from nightly evil; And bless the sod Where shuffling Davie, blithe yet civil, Lies cold as toad. RECANTATORY POSTSCRIPT. Be it known to all men, as I stumbled Towards Hughye's cot, and fell, and fumbled, Something I heard that strangely grumbled: Amaz'd I canter; Lest by the Fays I should be home led Or Ariel's chanter. However, I took heart o' grace, And ken'd a noise i' that same place, At which I blest myself with face As pale as stone: For I could swear, in any case, 'Twas Davie's drone. So in I went, pry'd all about; The people wonder'd at the rout: At last, with one outrageous shout, Unkennel'd Davie; So stunn'd, that scarce one word came out, To say, ‘God save ye.’ Like that madcap in Hamlet's play, We star'd,—and star'd our fears away; And then sat down, full spruce and gay, As sound as cherry: And Davie's here this very day, Alive and merry. Though all the town, in well-feign'd sorrow, Swore Death had pink'd his body thorough, And laid him flatter than the furrow, There's no believing: In come, and you shall see to-morrow Poor Davie living. MY OWN ELEGY. Gude faith! with all thy roguish trick, Thy Pegasus has got a kick; Flat as a tomb-stone, dumb as stick, Thou liest at last: God send, thou gang'st not to old Nick For frolics past. I do remember thee right well: Thou didst in witty pranks excel, Can all thy deeds of sly note tell, Thou great verse-fighter; But ah! auld Death has borne the bell, And bit the biter. Right glum Silent. is all thy rhyming glee; Struck mute, who wont to be so free: Yet, yet shall I, on bended knee (Faithfu' Achates ‘Fides Achates.’ Virgil.) Drink to thy amorous memory; Fine off'ring that is. For thou didst long to taste the bowl: And if from limbo-logwood whole, Sound, safe. I ken, thy jovial fluttering soul Will snuff the vapours, Gleam pure good humour o'er the whole, And light the tapers. ‘Bathe the delighted sprite Shakespeare: Measure for Measure.’ in ale, Lie ‘wedg'd in fiery’ mugs, exhale The quintessence of pipes, and rail At good old sages; Flouting the de'il and his long tail In smoky pages. When landlady, with burly mien, Bids purses gleam with twinklers sheen, Bright money. 'Tis ‘nuncle pays for thee,’ Alluding to a well-known story of Shuter, the actor. I ween; Gold grow'th not in heaven: Yet, by the laws, we'll lug thee in For reck'ning even. Well, blessings on thy shade so laurel'd! 'Mid all thy high words thou ne'er quarrel'd; Laugh'd loud, and leer'd, when malice snarl'd, A smiling wizard: And when renown'd good beer was barrel'd Grinn'd in thy gizzard. No thanks to those who long'd to pelt or Abuse thy poor muse, helter-skelter; Send thee to solitude for shelter, To grief and moping, Her dim lyre (cause enough to melt her) In darkness groping. Yes: all must grant thee too a smack Of genius, and of warmth. Alack! Genius and warmth are gone apack To land unknown; They'll never come, I fear me, back, To make us groan. The merry catch shall greet thy sprite: And in the dead of list'ning night We'll drone sincere at thy ill plight, And sprinkle strong dews: The hop shall on thy tomb rise light, Nor yield us wrong juice. Tobacco tubes, like trumps inverted, Shall deck thy grave, and smoke thick-darted Nourish the flow'rs around thee started With od'rous aid: Then, mon, be not this once faint-hearted; Thy fortune's made. At judgment-day, when strong-lung'd cherub Shall pipe all hands from silence here up, He'll know thee, Tom, to be a queer cub, And give thee quarters; Wouns! what a sight, to see thy knee rub 'Gainst the saints and martyrs? D'ye now remember, youth, the time Thou'st rattled off sweet chinking rhime, Till, rapt in doggerel sublime, Thou staid'st all night out. While Mumpus One of his associates at John Baynham's. rang'd from clime to clime, Raising a right rout? Peace to thy manes, lad of wax! Free from all venomous attacks, Thou liest in harbour snug: what lacks Thy heart on high? Would that thy friends here could go snacks, And mount the sky! AN ODE TO MYSELF. Thrice hail, thou prince of jovial fellows, Tuning so blithe thy lyric bellows, Of no one's brighter genius jealous; Whose little span Is spent 'twixt poetry and alehouse, 'Twixt quill and cann! Reckless howe'er the world may fadge, Variety thy only badge: Now courting Susan, Kate, or Madge, Or black-ey'd Molly; For living in one sullen lodge Is downright folly. Thy classics sleeping on the shelf, Thou'rt muse and patron to thyself: Aye Ever. So Milton: And hear the Muses in a ring Aye round about Jove's altar sing. frolic when profuse of pelf; Grim as the gallows When dunn'd by that obstreperous elf, False-scoring Alice. Long may'st thou punch ambrosial swill, Drinking no water from that hill By temperate bards recorded still In tasteless rhime; For noble punch shall sweetly fill The thought sublime. By many wrong'd, gay bloom of song, Thou yet art innocent of wrong, Virtue and truth to thee belong, Virtue and truth; Though Pleasure led thy step along, And trapp'd thy youth. With Baynham, social spring So Falstaff: “I am not only witty myself, but the cause of wit in others. of wit, Thou hadst full many a merry fit; And whether haply thou shalt sit With clown or peer, Never shall lingering honour quit Thy heart sincere. MY OWN EPITAPH. Guiltless he met grim Death, and sporting; The farce is finish'd, drop the curtain; The bubble's burst, the whim is ended, The rattle either lost or mended. Here Dermody, oddest of odd compositions; By Virtue and Vice, two contending physicians, Most strangely work'd up; who of each wore the fetter; Just loos'd from this world, lies in hopes of a better: If no blessing ensue he can't suffer a curse; As Fortune and Fate could not find out a worse. All formal rule slighting of plain mortals above; The pole-star of friendship, the comet of love; Though sadly distrest, a vile squand'rer of pelf, For others he felt what he felt not for self. Most injur'd by folks whom he most wish'd to please; To preferment no foe, but a friend to his ease; Unnotic'd for talents he had, and forgot, But most famously notic'd for faults he had not; Though meek as a lamb, deem'd the lion of satire; The madman of rage and the fool of good-nature; Whenever to praise he sometimes condescended, They squeez'd out sly rubs which were never intended: No deist, no drunkard, no rake at a gypsy; Yet often both swearing, and courting, and tipsy. As an author, conceited when once he began; Facetious, and social, and free, as a man: As a man, did I say? when death shifted the scene, A giant of genius, he was not fifteen. Him whom living you nourish'd with ink and with bays, To others the profit, to him the mere praise, Sage critics and cavilers, take it in head To burden with praise and with profit when dead; Oh! now that you fear nor his smiles nor his lashes, Be candid for once, and disturb not his ashes. ELEGIAC STANZAS ON MYSELF. To Pleasure's wiles an easy prey, Beneath this sod a bosom lies; Yet spare the meek offender's clay, Nor part with dry averted eyes. O stranger! if thy wayward lot Through Folly's heedless maze has led, Here nurse the true, the tender thought, And fling the wild flow'r on his head. For he, by this cold hillock clad, Where tall grass twines the pointed stone, Each gentlest balm of feeling had, To sooth all sorrow but his own. For he, by tuneful Fancy rear'd, (Though ever-dumb he sleeps below,) The stillest sigh of anguish heard, And gave a tear to ev'ry woe. Oh! place his dear harp by his side, (His harp, alas! his only hoard;) The fairy breeze at even tide Will trembling kiss each weeping chord. Oft on yon crested cliff he stood, When misty twilight stream'd around; To mark the slowly-heaving flood, And catch the deep wave's sullen sound. Oft when the rosy dawn was seen 'Mid blue to gild the blushing steep, He trac'd o'er yonder margent green The curling cloud of fragrance sweep. Oft did he pause, the lark to hear, With speckled wing, the skies explore; Oft paus'd to see the slow flock near: But he shall hear and see no more. Then, stranger, be his foibles lost; At such small foibles Virtue smil'd: Few was their number, large their cost, For he was Nature's orphan-child. The graceful drop of pity spare, (To him the bright drop once belong'd:) Well, well his doom deserves thy care; Much, much he suffer'd, much was wrong'd. When taught by life its pangs to know, Ah! as thou roam'st the checker'd gloom, Bid the sweet night-bird's numbers flow, And the last sunbeam light his tomb. FAREWELL TO KILLEIGH. At last, while you've been heedless napping, Egad, I'm ready just for hopping: There's neither staying now nor stopping, But dash away; Perchance your bard no more may drop in, To make you gay. Howe'er, I hope you'll place my head Upon a column white and red: Record the witty things I said, And con each joke: You will, I wot, be so well-bred, My hearts of oak. Oft in the dear lost school convene, Smoke deep your funny gab Talk. between; While honest John, in doleful teen, Sound of sorrow. Sighs out my name: Boys, I must alter now the scene And climb to fame. If to old Lory's you repair, To tipple off the fortnight's care, Still Tom shall steal upon you there, And prompt each wish; Tom, that would smoke like a lord may'r, Drink like a fish. When Shakspeare fills each pate so fine, And Dick repeats the pompous line, You'll mouth once more my verse divine; My slipshod muse Shall make the ale as strong as wine, And sweets infuse. How often have we met the moon With vapours bland, and pipe in tune, Ready with Ariel to commune, Or Caliban: Not caring half a taylor's croon For dev'l or man! No more shall I so deeply muse O'er pamphlet bare, or dusty news; No more antiquities peruse With craving eye: Good lack! no more destroy my shoes, Cap'ring for joy. No more love-sonnets sweetly sing, To Hudibrastics chime the string, Or elegies right baleful bring For Davie dead: Alas! 'tis quite another thing: All frolic's fled. But friendship still shall fresh remain; And when I'm o'er the envious main, Tell all my old tricks o'er again With smiling glee: “Heav'ns!” will ye cry in ranting strain, Who'll equal thee? ‘Killeigh is now, alack! deserted: Her once-lov'd poet's quite departed; Full cruel wert thou and hard-hearted To serve her so.’ Partners of all my life, though parted, My soul's with you. Though riches fill my chest, though Glory Swell up my heart, I'm no such tory To gain up all those things before ye, Nor lend a mite; Whate'er I be, 'tis the old story, And all is right. Should I in future years be able To take an arm-chair at your table, Then you wont think this boast a fable, But good stout reason: You'll find me, though but poor, right stable; Ne'er out of season. And now God's luck to this fair meeting! And may we have another greeting; When bairns and wives, the tribe completing, Shall hug each other: While I, of noble actions treating, Hail each a brother! EPISTLE TO J. C. WALKER, ESQ. While in Italy. While safe on Latium's classic shore, Beneath her cloudless skies you rove, The Mantuan's mouldering cot explore, Or Tully's desolated grove; Oh! let my artless muse, unknown To all the charms thy ancients knew, Awake the soft pipe's liquid tone; A song, if not sublime, yet true. 'Tis thine, with fond research to trace The shrinking river's latent vein; From dust to dig th' imperial face, Or raise to light the lofty strain. Then, like the bee, full-fraught return, Instruction pour from Wisdom's urn, And bid the Alban graces smile On lost Juverna's barren isle. This prediction was fulfill'd in the year 1799, when Mr. Walker's Historical Memoir on Italian Tragedy appeared. Methinks a visionary band Of palm-crown'd shades attend thy path; With vigour arm thy curious hand, And lull the sleeping serpent's wrath. Old Tiber on his yellow stream (His blue stole floating in the wind) Awakes from his long-lengthen'd dream, And whispers to thy tranced mind: Recounts what former deeds were done, What poets sung, what warriors fought; Embalms with tears each godlike son, And dwells upon the noble thought: Recounts the fair historic grace That told each martial tale to fame, That wont each hidden fault to trace, And falters at his Livy's name. Oh, couldst thou from some gentle shade Retrieve the lost, the priceless page, The depths of elder Time invade, And brighten blank Oblivion's age! The wish is vain: what taste can do, What elegance with sense combin'd, Thy learned toil shall bring to view, And nourish the abstracted mind. Perchance, with later genius smit, By Vaucluse' silver springs you sit, And 'mid the purple bowret's hear The minstrel of the blooming year. Thee Dante's holy spirit leads Through asphodel-embroider'd meads, Or tumbles with impetuous sweep Down the rough mountain's horrid steep: Meanwhile, the penal lashes sound With lamentable shrieks of woe; And threats the aching soul that wound Shrill murmur'd from the gulf below. Or he who chose Orlando fierce, By Fancy fir'd, his beauteous guide; And rais'd Adventure's knightly pride In wild varieties of verse. Or rather Tasso's chaster lay, Melodious melting, or sublime; Tasso, who sweetest could display The lulling witchery of rhime. Whate'er thy task, pure truth is thine, That 'mid Norwegian frosts would shine; And manly knowledge, temper'd mild, With winning ease, serenely free: For, when fond Nature moulded thee, The Muse, the Virtues, and the Graces, smil'd. THE POET'S RECANTATION. Addressed to the Rev. Mr. Berwick, Chaplain to the Countess of Moira. “Facit recantatio versum “Facit indignatio versum.” Horace..” Puff'd with false hopes of fame and honour, My muse (the Philistines upon her!), Stiff in her own bold ipse dixit, Erst sent me out a true don Quixote; Despising wealth, content, and pleasure, For authorship's enchanted treasure: Nor could the great Eliza's Countess of Moira. kindness Purge from my eye poetic blindness. At last, well vers'd in cares and trouble, I see my former folly double (As Œdipus, with haggard eyes, ‘Saw double suns and worlds arise;’ So Virgil, prince of epic fellows, Is pleas'd in his ninth book to tell us)! And, startled at my faults and foibles, Firm as if sworn on fifty Bibles, Declare eternal hate, and lasting, To lagging rhymes and paper-wasting. Not Brutus did so much determine To hunt from Rome the royal vermin. Thus then, in a most furious fashion, I write (not read) my recantation. Imprimis (pray your godship, mind me), Phœbus, I cast thee far behind me; And all thy books, facete or tragic, I look upon as spells or magic. In second place, I do combine Body and blood against the Nine; Ill-natur'd ballad-chanting slatterns; That spoil'd my luck, and lost my patrons. Lastly, cum vi, et coram rege, I do, my reverend sir, engage ye, To view a quill from goose or sparrow As if it was a Parthian arrow, Or William Tell's unerring dart, Directly bouncing to my heart. Neither shall ink or black or pallid, (I swear, to make your trust more valid,) For me in cup or bottle teem, No more than Pluto's Stygian stream. For ink's, I find by disquisition, The very essence of perdition; The gall was made for man's undoing, And signs the bond 'twixt him and ruin. And if, sometime hence, sorely smit By flashes of electric wit, I should, in deep-designing malice, Deal with the volume-vending tories “Tories” is here used merely as a term of reproach, in which sense it was first given to the political party now bearing this appellation. In its origin it is appropriate to robbers or freebooters; being derived from the native Irish toree, or “give me.”, May scandal plant his blackest gallows, And hang me in his attic stories; Where the grim-phyz'd Reviews exhibit (Fell vaticides!) their ruthless gibbet. Moreover, may the prince of printing (You well may guess him by my hinting) Roll up each page in sulphur-pills; When from his stately chariot's wheels, In doctor's semblance, he bestows Disease and death where'er he goes. Now, having made this adjuration, I find there is some slight occasion To seek some other method (knowing The mouth must still be kept a-going) By which, in lieu of rhymes unpleasant, I may carouse with port and pheasant: While at my door, with hat in hand, Vile bards (once brothers) shivering stand; And, cursing me (a proud Egyptian), Requests his Honour's least subscription. O friend, whose goodness plac'd me once Above the sneer of every dunce, Above the scorn of fools well-drest, In Hastings' generous bounty blest! Once more her pitying heart assail With youthful indiscretion's tale; And bid, above the viler throng, A princely patron grace my song. So ends recant: by marv'lous care, I've clench'd it with a poet's pray'r; A kind of anti-scribbling matin, To scare the fiends of Greek and Latin:— From notes unpaid, that make us mourn; From Marshalsea's close-grated bourn, From whence no debtor can return; From teasing countesses with letters, And rash intrusion on our betters; From Cambrian booksellers, who scrape or Conceal all profits with a caper; From shillings scant, that often send us To tasteless lords; —good Lord, defend us! But if it be thy will immortal, Let Moira-house extend its portal; Forgiving the ill-fated sinner, And welcome Dermody to dinner: And may he live at ease again, Its bard for ever and—Amen. THE PETITION OF TOM DERMODY To the three Fates in Council sitting. “Right rigorous, and so forth! humbled By cares and mournings, tost and tumbled, Before your ladyships Tom Fool, Knowing above the rest you rule, Most lamentably sets his case, With a bold heart and saucy face. Sans shoe or stocking, coat or breeches, You see him now, most mighty witches: His body worn like an old farthing, The angry spirit just a-parting; His credit rotten, and his purse As empty as a cobler's curse; His poems too unsold,—that's worse! In short, between confounded crosses, Patrons all vex'd, and former losses, Sure as a gun he cannot fail Next week to warble in a jail; Which jail to folks not very sanguine Is just as good, or worse than hanging; Though in the first some vain hopes flatter, But Hope's quite strangled by the latter. Thus is poor rhyming rascal treated; Fairly, or rather foully cheated Of all the goods from wit accruing; (Wit, that's synonimous with ruin). Then take it in your head-piece, ladies, To set up a poor bard whose trade is Low fall'n enough in conscience: pity The master of the magic ditty; And turn your wheel once more in haste, To see him on the summit plac'd. For well you wot that woes ('od rot 'em!) Have long time stretch'd him at the bottom: Where he who erst fine lyrics gabbled, With mire and filth was sorely dabbled: So plentifully pelted that He looks like any drowned rat. O Justice, Justice! take his part; Oh! lift him in thy lofty cart, Magnific Fame; and let fat Plenty Marry one poet out of twenty.” FAREWELL TO IRELAND. “Rank nurse of nonsense; on whose thankless coast The base weed thrives, the nobler bloom is lost: Parent of pride and poverty, where dwell Dullness and brogue and calumny:—farewell! Lo! from thy land the tuneful prophet flies, And spurns the dust behind in folly's eyes. Merit, bright meteor, o'er thy gloomy night Stream'd of poetic charm the loveliest light; Dimm'd by thy mist, and shorn of many a ray, The brilliant glory bursts, and glides away, In purer skies to shed its radiant glow, And leaves a lonely waste of gloom below. In vain thy children tun'd the lofty strain; Thy children propp'd the sinking isle in vain; Vice is well-pension'd, virtue seeks the shades, And all the muse and all the patriot fades. No Moira comes to clear thy circling fogs, But Westmorland still rules congenial bogs. “Yet ere my better fortune fills the sail, Ere fav'ring zephyr fans the speeding gale; While tears by turns, and angry curses, rend This injur'd breast; inglorious spot, attend: (For spite of anger, spite of satire's thrill, Nature boils o'er; thou art my country still). Oh! pause on ruin's steepy cliff profound: Oh! raise thy pale, thy drooping sons around; Exalt the poor, the lordly proud oppress, Thy tyrants humble, but thy soldiers bless. Worn by long toil, as if foredoom'd by fate To glut some pamper'd reprobate of state, Thy artists cherish; bid the mighty soul Of wisdom range beyond cold want's control; And haply when some native gem you see Unknown, unfriended, lost,—oh, think on me!” It was peculiarly ungrateful in Dermody to speak in these terms respecting his native country. He received in fact too much friendship, too much patronage. TO SIR JAMES BLAND BURGESS, BART. On his admirable Poem of Richard the First. Lo! from the ruins of ‘the mighty dead,’ Once more the English Genius lifts his head; Britain once more with partial transport views Th' appropriate honours of the epic muse. Oft has the fervour of her genuine flame Illum'd the Theban or the Spartan name; Lending, with liberal grace, to chiefs unknown Immortal wreaths, and laurels not their own: While the brave worthies of this favour'd clime Lay clouded in some legendary rhyme, Whose quaint inanity presum'd to raise A lasting theme in mockery of praise. Not so, with unaffected splendour bright, Meets thy First Richard our enraptur'd sight: Emerging from oblivion's central shade, In all the majesty of song array'd. Oh! would the heirs of pomp, the gifted great, So charm the hours of dignified retreat; So, by soft sanction, tenderly impart A new-born lustre to the tuneful art: Still might I hope, intent on high emprize, To see a Dorset or a Sidney rise.— The hope is vain; that gen'rous glow divine Which breathes in harmony from breasts like thine; That soaring spirit which disdains to creep Round the smooth base of the Parnassian steep, But, hurried with the whirlwind's force along, Grasps the rough summit of sublimest song; Where shall I seek 'mid the degen'rate band Who slight the beauties of their native land: For foreign flow'rs of short duration sigh, And scorn those hardy blooms that never die, Nurs'd by the rigours of our northern sky? To thy auspicious star we fondly turn, Whose steadier rays aloft distinctly burn: To light the minstrel through life's stormy main, Or guide the banish'd muses back again; Here, safe at length, to rest their pilgrim feet, And claim their old hereditary seat. EXCULPATORY LINES TO ATTICUS. This name, Dermody, in all his writings, applied to Mr. Addington. Quo quisque est major, magis est placabilis ira; Et faciles motus mens generosa capit. Ovid. By what strange fate great talents are allied To greatest faults, whose judgment can decide? Whether the finer fibres of the brain, Intensely bent, and stretching ev'n to pain, Relaxing, may too frequently require Fresh fuel for the intellectual fire: Or that rash genius, in its wild career, All-devious visits each eccentric sphere; And, conversant with fancied forms of air, Mocks the cold caution of terrestrial care;— Now, bravely borne on seraph-wing sublime, List'ning th' eternal systems' choral chime “The music of the spheres.” Pope.; Now 'mid the gloom of central Hades hurl'd, Groping the rayless dungeons of the world; Anon with more effulgent face to rise, And sun-like travel through serener skies, Till vile Intemperance, of hideous birth, The struggling pinion chains to native earth, And reason's spark, irregularly bright, At length exhausted sinks in mournful night. How sad the wreck, the triumph how malign, When Vice allures the muses to her shrine; Round her black brow when roses are entwin'd, And demons revel o'er the ruin'd mind! In vain for causes would stern prudence seek, But of the dread effect all ages speak; While on full many a minstrel's doom severe, Relenting pardon streams th' eternal tear. Though 'mid the guilty but illustrious band My humble name unknown must never stand; Though little praise, alas! to me is due; Would I deserv'd so little censure too! Deeply impress'd th' unpleasing theme I feel Which conscious blushes, spite of pride, reveal: Yet, sooth'd once more by thy absolving smile, Enrag'd compunction's scorpion-sting beguile; And find my soul from sensual bondage free, Tutor'd by Virtue, Atticus, and thee. THE FEMALE MENDICANT. As, with step full weak and weary, Faint from door to door I roam, While the wind whistles deep and dreary, And, in vain, I seek a home; Tho' my grey locks with rain are dripping, Tho' scarce my limbs their load can bear, Tho' faster than the show'r I'm weeping, See! they mock the falling tear! Tell me, sweet Child of Pity, why— guiltless wanderer am I? On this sad head, with age so stooping, Full fourscore winters roll'd away, And, ah! tho' now with sorrow drooping, Once I've seen a brighter day; Once I had fortune, health, and beauty, And houses tall, and cultur'd land, Children, observant of their duty, A spouse, who press'd this shrivell'd hand, Now stretch'd in vain: Ah tell me why— A poor, old wanderer am I? Boys, as I go, at me are hooting, Banning sore the palsy'd crone, Still, still, with cruel mock'ry shouting, “Beldame! to thy grave begone!” And, while the scanty faggot picking, I mutter at my wayward doom, Thorns in my seat the imps are sticking, To wound the witch returning home. Tell me, dear Child of Pity, why— An harmless mendicant am I? As thou would'st wish for joy and pleasure, Thro' this tedious road of life, As thou would'st wish for heav'n's best treasure, Sweet babes, and a fond, faithful wife: Scoff not a wretch, with famine pining, Laugh not to scorn the widow's pray'r; When on the bed of death reclining, You'll see my blessing hov'ring there. A little will my wants supply, Feeble, and faint, and old am I. HYMN TO THE MEMORY OF THOMSON. O! gentlest of the gifted train, Whom wild wreaths deck'd from Fancy's bow'r, May wonder raise the ardent strain, To hymn thine inexpressive pow'r. Still, as the vary'd Seasons roll Mid the fierce sunshine, or the storm, I trace thy fair, enthusiast soul, I meet thy silent-musing form. And oft, methinks, where yellowing shades Ripe Autumn's browner beauties show, I hear thee, with the village-maids, Breathe the sad tale of pleasing woe. Or, stretch'd beneath some cliff's rude crest, By each sublimest horror fir'd, New prospects sink into thy breast, While Nature sits with Thee, retir'd. Oft, as the lurid flashes cleave Night's murky vault, and flit around, Shall praise fresh blooms of glory weave, And fence with bays On which no lightning has effect. thy hallow'd mound. For thou could'st in the tempest tow'r, Or dart amid noon's sultry rays, Or rifle each ethereal flow'r From the clear rainbow's liquid blaze. Then what, but these great landscapes wrought By thine own hand, can praise aright? Where substance seems to wed with thought, And words delude the raptur'd sight: Where fancy'd currents seem to rill, And murmur through the magic line: Where swells sublime th' ideal hill, And o'er the page glib light'nings shine. Then oft let Genius young peruse That page divine, with studious care; Meanwhile the much-astonish'd muse Finds her own soul reflected there. And oh! from thy superior sphere, Shade ever sacred to this heart, Lull with high sounds my chasten'd ear, Th' imperishable flame impart! The allusion in almost every stanza of this hymn, to some particular passage in the Seasons, need not to be pointed out to the eye of taste. ON THE MISFORTUNES OF AN INGENIOUS MIND. Alas! too fatally inspir'd, Why heaves this heart, with purest aim, For aught the sage's soul admir'd, Or raptur'd minstrel gave to fame? Why throbs within this lone recess Each finer pulse of general zeal, That mourns, because it cannot bless The wants 'tis fated still to feel? Did fortune blast what nature gave, Averse, with dark malignant glare? Did sorrow mark the victim's grave, When grac'd with more than mortal's share? Ah! cruel gift, ah! baneful prize, By too-bewitching fancy led, To bid hope's fairest visions rise, Then find those fairest wishes fled. To pause on the deserted gloom, By their lost hues more hideous made; While, only left, an early tomb Gleams sudden thro' the awful shade! Less painful far were dull despair, Without one spark delusive giv'n, To flash amid the cells of care, Or snatch a fading glimpse of heav'n. Less injur'd the insensate breast, That ne'er one ardent pang can know; That deems each social call a jest, And slumbers o'er the tale of woe. Like some poor pilgrim, faint and frail, When lonely eve comes darkling on, Still forc'd to tread life's thorny vale, Nor view the tedious travel done. To hang on hope's pale setting ray, To hear in ev'ry breeze a sigh; To end at last the weary way, Then disappointment meet—and die! If this, oh! poesy, thy meed, Whose bosom, sympathy's sole throne, Must oft for other's anguish bleed, And ever, ever, for its own: Quick tear thy sad illusions hence, (Illusions sad indeed, yet dear!) Unroot each tender-twining sense, And freeze on pity's cheek the tear. Oh! let that cheek be marble cold To friendship or affection's kiss, And let each child of song be told Insensibility is Bliss! THE UNION. ?Totamque infusa per artus Mens agitat molem, &amp; magno se corpore miscet. Strike the glitt'ring harp again, Loud let Erin's cliffs resound; Once more the Muse's old domain Is with celestial concord crown'd. Her palmy hand she lifts sublime; She spreads her radiant pinion round; And from each giant mountain shade-embrown'd, Midway on whose flinty breast The flagging eaglet builds his nest, Is heard the choral swell of Druid-rhime. Spirits of woe, who in yon crimson cloud Brood o'er the pale decline of drooping day, And to the sun's weak westering ray Flash each your sanguinary shroud, Bend not on yon bleak hill the mournful brow Where madd'ning brother against brother fought; But, oh! let blessings blooming on the now Misguided martyrs, balm each pensive thought; Exhale from Pity's lid th' ascending tear, And hail with saintly song the bright, absolving year. Majestic months, your prosp'rous march pursue; The sword, in olives twin'd, securely sleeps. Lo! with maternal fondness Mercy weeps, Oh! catch, oh! venerate the holy dew. One drop from that refulgent sluice, Can wash from Murder's pall the deepest dye, And more than angel-purity produce; War owns the influence of that dovelike eye: War owns; and stooping from his iron car, On adamantine axle borne, His rough breast trench'd with many a scar, With many a gash all rudely torn, Receives the balm its sov'reign pow'rs infuse, To every feeling op'd, and every beauteous muse. Still let the Gallic vulture sweep With ruthless sway the realms around, While riding on the subject deep Severe the Bri ish thunders sound; Still let barbarian rage o'erturn The poet's tomb, the hero's urn, The campaigns in Italy. Still bathe the guilty wreath in blood, Whose purple honours soon shall fade, And fast by yellow Tyber's angry flood Profane each venerable glade; Each sacred haunt with living laurel hung, Where godlike Tully thought, or softer Virgil sung. Still, as his native deserts wild, Where young-eyed Science never smil'd, Still let the rude Siberian storm, His mind unfashion'd as his form:— Each arbitrary vaunt is vain, When issuing from this hallow'd shore, Our naval force, a dauntless train, Intent on high emprize, explore The limits of the watery plain, From Danger's front the meed of glory tear, Fling to the winds each vulgar fear; And, mid the general wreck of Nature, brave The missile carnage, and the yawning wave. Oh! for the aid of that celestial youth, See Apocrypha, chap. xi. ver. 8. Clad in the shining panoply of Truth, Who turn'd the foes of fair Judæa pale, Stretch'd his white arm, and shook his silver mail. Then should the shrine of Virtue, rise In all its decent pomp again; Then, swelling to th' attentive skies, Should breathe the bliss-requited strain, And seraphs, stooping from their tuneful sphere, Lend to the Son of Earth, a fond, propitious ear. What time the purple twilight slowly sails O'er dusk Marino's fairy-fading vales, And yon dim isle, as moving on the main, Seems bound by Ocean in a golden chain; Full in the midst, of awful size, Methinks, I see a warrior-spectre rise, With many a wound his stately semblance gor'd; Bright from the beach his kingly front he rears, And still, ah! still, his looks betray Clontarf's ill-fated memorable day, Recent from ruin mid the lapse of years. 'Tis he!—'tis Munster's Lord! Brian Boroimh, (or, as it is pronounced) Boru, the magnanimous King of Munster, who with the greatest part of his army, and all his captains, was slain at the renowned battle of Clontarf, near Dublin. Yet still, a faint, a shadowy smile I trace, Like moon-light, hov'ring on his rev'rend face; His ghostly cheek, methinks, to rapture warms, As round Eblana's tow'rs he views Cherubic Peace her halcyon-calm diffuse, And the fair city swell with renovated charms. Oh! long may that blest calm remain! Oh! long may heav'nly union reign! From whence surpassing transports spring; And oh! the bloody drops, and impious dust, Which foul Rebellion flung on Freedom's bust, May Honour wipe away with taintless wing. So shall each foreign menace fail: So hostile hate in vain assail, Tho' pride may prompt, or wealth allure, A bulwark in confederate strength secure; So rev'ling Nature, in thy partial smiles, Learning, with pilgrim-step, may come, Once more, to recognize his ancient home: Once more, in all his simple state, Bland Hospitality expand the gate, Where Welcome oft was wont, with aspect gay, To woo the weary minstrel from his way; And Commerce, anchoring on the favour'd coast, And Truth, and loyal Love, illustrious boast! Wed in rich kindred the United Isles. GIBRALTAR. The heav'n-rais'd bulwarks of imperial Troy Still rise in song Meonian; and the muse Of deathless Maro consecrates to fame Illustrious Latium!—Shall no lyre resound A brighter subject, a sublimer lay, And claim a fresher wreath?—Spirit of War, First-born of Freedom, who from Calpe's height Hurl'd thy indignant thunders, string the chord To British fortitude, to British fire! For thou canst tell how dauntless Elliot fought, Immortal hero! when the labouring main Groan'd with the huge armada, vengeance-fraught: How from thy rocky seat the warrior pour'd An arch of mortal lightnings on the foe. Discreetly valiant, confidently firm, Each treach'rous wile he saw, each Spanish mine, And marked the tempest low'ring in repose, Anon to burst with a redoubled force. Though palsy'd Famine stretch'd her meagre hand O'er all, and Death his withering glances cast, Still rear'd Britannia's standard o'er the fort, Purpling the wave below with awful shade, Wave soon to be embued with hostile gore, Drawn from the heart of myriads! methinks, ev'n now, The whizzing bullets stun my startled ear, And sulphurous smoke envelopes the grim sky With tenfold horrors! Vain attempt, to scale Gibraltar's giant brow, when marble mounds, And British breasts more stern, defend the place. So strove the haughty pow'r of hell, when fall'n From site celestial to the burning deep, With turms diminish'd by Messiah's hand, To climb the crystal battlements of heav'n; So fell he, vaunting!—The Hispanian crew Wond'ring retire, and eye with envious look The walls impregnable, where Glory sits, Thron'd with her Britons! Like a dreadful row Of gods embattled on Olympus' top, The warriors scowl derision. Heathfield chief, The Mars of Albion, stirs the latent spark Of honour to a blaze, invigorates Each manly bosom; and the fainting cheers! So Britons fight, when Liberty calls out The martial youths, and Justice sounds the trump Of dreadful onset. Spain's dismounted fleet, Spain's gasping soldiery, and the chiefs of Spain, Can testify with tears the Muse's truth. MILTON'S EPITAPHIUM DAMONIS TRANSLATED. ARGUMENT. Thyrsis and Damon, shepherds in the same village were united in the same studies from their infancy, and bound in the strictest friendship. Thyrsis, having gone to the city for recreation's sake, receives an account of the death of Damon. Returning home afterwards, and finding the news true, he bemoans himself and his solitary situation, in the following poem. In the appellation Damon, is understood that of Carolus Diodatus: a person descended from a family of Lucca in Italy, yet in every thing but birth an Englishman; and a youth of the most promising appearance as to wit, learning, and all other conspicuous virtues, while he lived. Sicilian nymphs, attend my mournful claim, And aid my sorrow, by the banks of Thame; For whilom you o'er Bion's early hearse Hung the choice garlands of elegiac verse, And to fair Hylas his last honors paid, And soothed with tender wailings Daphne's shade. How many sighs did weeping Thyrsis heave! How oft awaken'd Echo from her cave! How long with pond'ring steps he wont to rove, And join the trickling rill, and seek the cypress grove! His woes beginning with the dawn of light, His woes nor ending at th' approach of night; While Damon's ling'ring stay he frequent mourn'd, Damon who ne'er to see his friend return'd. And now the second harvest grac'd the plain, And twice the barn receiv'd the golden grain, Since rutless death laid Damon in his tomb, Nor was kind Thyrsis (luckless) then at home; For the sweet muse prolong'd his pleasing hours, And long detain'd 'mid Rome's imperial tow'rs! But, fill'd with home his mind, again he tends His flock neglected, and neglected friends; And while beneath the conscious elm he lies (Once dear retreat to his admiring eyes), On Damon's fate he thinks: beyond control, Tumultuous anguish rushes on his soul; And while affection wrings his very heart, Those simple strains he pours devoid of art. “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your hapless master has no time for you.” Ah me! what Pow'rs in heav'n shall I implore, Since from my breast its better part they tore?— Thus dost thou leave me, Damon, thus unkind? Ah! shall thy virtues die, nor leave behind One lasting trace? Ah! shall my tears still flow, Nor win thee ever from the shades below? But no! thou shalt not join the meaner dead, Hermes to brighter scenes thy step shall lead; And while he drives the humbler throng away, Announce thy entrance in the realms of day. “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your hapless master has no time for you.” Yet if no quaint wolf mark me for his prey, Thine ashes shall not quite in death decay; But thy fresh honour, undefil'd, appear Bathed in the dew of a melodious tear; And long the shepherd swains thy worth shall raise, And join with me to celebrate thy praise. While Faunas loves the plain, and Pales dwells In sylvan scenes; while spotless truth excels, And ancient faith, and minstrelsye sublime; A generous mind, a soul without a crime, Can win applause and bind affection fast: So long shall all thy matchless glories last. “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your hapless master has no time for you.” Those thy rewards, thy sure rewards, shall be: But what avails this pomp of praise to me? Ah! who with faithful love shall now pursue Through dang'rous paths my side; ah! who but you? To brave the winter frost, the summer heat: Nor think the trouble much, though tir'd thy feet, Whether the lion's dang'rous course to fright, Or chase the prowling wolf at dead of night. Ah! who but you shall charm the hours along, And lull my slumber soft with soothing song? “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your hapless master has no time for you.” Whose bosom, Thyrsis, shall I now believe, Who shall with mirth my anxious cares deceive? Who now divert the long revolving night With gay discourses, pregnant of delight; While the dry faggot crackles in the blaze, And the nut bounds, or into coal decays? The winds meanwhile their boisterous revels keep, And through the elm's ærial branches sweep. “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your hapless master has no time for you.” Or in the sultry summer's burning noon, When Pan in beechen bow'r defies the sun; When naiad-nymphs in coral caves below Bid in sweet lapse their warbling waters flow; When shepherds hide beneath the arching glade; And the tir'd lab'rer sleeps, supinely laid; Then who thy solace bland can e'er supply, With friendship's candid lip and sparkling eye? “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your hapless master has no time for you.” Now solitary, silent, slow, I stray Where thickest umbrage crowns the shelter'd way; Here I await calm evening's sober hour, For the rain rushes in a rattling show'r, And the low sullen blasts of Eurus move The tremulous twilight of the wavy grove. “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your hapless master has no time for you.” Ah, how my meeds, so till'd, so fresh before, With noxious noisome herbs are mantled o'er! And ev'n my lofty quicksets seeth'd remain, For want of kindly aid from genial rain: The grape unweeded sinks, the myrtle dies, And the flocks turn to me their meagre eyes. “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your hapless master has no time for you.” To the tall hazels Tit'rus calls me hence; Alphesibœus to yon ashen fence; But Ægon becks me to the willow'd bank, And fair Amyntas to the streamlets dank; ‘Here cooling riv'lets well, here mossy seats; ‘The dumb they speak to, from their gay retreats.” I fly disconsolate, and rather long To sing to the low shrubs my plaintive song. “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your hapless master has no time for you.” There Mopsus summons: (Mopsus can divine The talk of birds, and tell each starry sign.) He met me haply, and half-trembling said, ‘What dread disorder doth thy peace invade? ‘Say, does disastrous love thy quiet mar, ‘Or pestilence of some malignant star? ‘For shepherds oft have felt its horrid pow'r, ‘And a cold leaden weight their vital-blood devour.” “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your hapless master has no time for you.” The virgins wonder too; and ask my ail, And what sad glooms o'er temper's warmth prevail. ‘Not thus,’ (they cry) ‘thy front would erst appear: ‘Why those mute lips, fierce eyes, and looks severe! ‘Whatever mistress does thy rest destroy, ‘Claims frolick mirth, and love, and sprightly joy.’ “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your hapless master has no time for you.” Hyas and Dryope and Aegle fair, Skill'd to attune the lyre to melting air, Tempting approach'd, but tempted all in vain; And Cloris too, the brightest of the plain. No fond caresses, no love-darting eyes, Solace my heart, or bid new flames arise. “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your hapless master has no time for you.” Alas, how like me once the heifers play; How, join'd in frolic gambol, waste the day! The savage wolves alike in flocks combine, T' attack the mighty fold, and slay our kine; The wild ass too his rugged mates will join; And the grim ocean owns the law divine, What time great Proteus on the sandy shore Summons his scaly herds, and counts their numbers o'er; The flutt'ring sparrow feels a mutual tie, And if the pouncing kite descend from high To tear her dear companion from her breast, She seeks another choice, and gains her usual rest. But human kind, a hard unfeeling race, Can ne'er in alien bosoms friendship place; Or if some gentle youth the golden chain Would wish to wear, and share the pleasing pain, Millions among he scarce one friend will gain. Should the kind Fates his fav'rite pray'r approve, And grant an equal worthy of his love, Ah, witless youth! when purest flames arise, They stamp eternal woe, and lo! his partner dies. “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your hapless master has no time for you.” What frenzy forc'd me from his dearest side, While snowy Alps and tow'ring cliffs subside? Why did I, fool, prefer the Latian plains To the blest converse of the pride of swains? Did I, ingrate, such mountains interpose! Ah, cruel hap! I left thy cot for those: Else had I press'd thy cold and withering hand, Thine eyes compos'd, and caught thy last command; While the sad farewels rent my very heart, And mindful of our love thou didst to heav'n depart. “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your hapless master has no time for you.” It is rather curious to observe that the poet has, in his translation, overlooked the following lines: Quamquam etiam vestri nunquam meminisse pigebit, Pastores Thusci, Musis operata juventus, Hic Charis, atque Lepos; et Thuscus tu quoque Damon, Antiquâ genus unde petis Lucumonis ab urbe. Oh that I was serene as erst, when o'er The banks I walk'd of Arno's tuneful shore; And sought his poplar-bows, of verdure gay, Where purple vi'lets deck the painted way! And there I too could hear Monalca's sage, Contend with Lyciad in poetic rage: Though all unmeet, myself would take the reed, And haply with thy partial ear succeed; Full many meeds of thine my stores contain— Goblets, and pipes, and flutes of boxen grain. Both Dati and Francinus Two friends of Milton. wont to raise Thy name, and teach the echoing wood our praise: And they were swains of note; for ev'ry grace Famed, and descended from a Lydian race. “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your helpless master has no time for you.” Beneath the dewing moon I oft have cried, While you lay senseless by the cypress' side, ‘Now careful Damon pens the guarded fold; ‘Now songs of his are sung, or tales are told: ‘Now, for the hare the floating net he draws, ‘Now twists the slender twig for secret cause:’ And dreams which I pourtray'd in times of yore, Now do I still present my sight before. ‘Where art thou, Damon? what delays thee so? ‘Beneath yon shade we'll bank the summer glow; ‘We'll stretch our limbs by Colnus' limpid rill, The river Colne. ‘Or by Cassibelaunus' cloud-capt hill: The town of St. Albans. ‘You will lay ope your scrip, of magic pow'r, ‘And tell the several virtues of each flow'r: ‘Whether the hellebore, or crocus small, ‘Or leaf of hyacinth, excel at med'cine's call.’ Ah! perish potent herbs, and healing flow'r; None after thee, their uses can explore. My flute is broken too, uncouth the sound; And rude, I ween: yet list, ye woodlands round. “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your hapless master has no time for you. I too will sing the Phrygian prows that sought The British shore; and lift my humbler thought To ancient Imogen's illustrious line, Brennus, Arviragus, and old Beline. The landing of the Trojans in England under Brutus. Brutus married Imogen, the daughter of a Grecian king, from whose bondage he had delivered his countrymen. Brennus and Belinus were the sons of Molutius Dunwallo, by some writers called the first king of Britain. Arviragus, the son of Cunobelin, conquered the Roman general Claudius. Then the Armorian colony I chose, And Iogerne's more mysterious woes; And Merlin's stratagems and fell alarms, Disguis'd and hid beneath Gorloran arms. The Britons are said to have retired to Armorica in Bretagne, when they fled from the Saxons. Iogerne was the wife of Gorlois prince of Cornwal. Merlin, the ancient British enchanter, transformed Uther Pendragon into Gorlois; by which artifice Uther had access to the bed of Iogerne, and thus became the father of King Arthur. Oh, would my life but last, thou, flute, should lie On yonder knotty pine, and greet no more mine eye; Or, swell'd with some Britannic theme renown'd, Thy martial stops would Arthur's actions sound. What then? a swain could ill attempt the task; No other fame, no other praise I ask (Unknown, unheeded, to each following age, I care not who will read my past'ral page) If Usa The river Ouse. golden-hair'd, Alaunus The Humber. too, Abra, The name of three rivers in England; the Alain, Alende, and Camlan. and Trent emerging to the view, If Thames 'bove all esteem'd, and the far wave Of Orcades, my floating song will save. “My unfed flocks, go home, ye straggling few; Your hapless master has no time for you.” For thee I kept beneath the laurel-shade, Two graven bowls, with nicest efforts made: Manso the great the precious presents gave; Manso the learn'd, the courteous, and the brave. Around the outside various landscapes shine, Of workmanship complete, and bold design: Here, in the middle, rolls the ruddy tide, And sweet Arabia stands in blooming pride: The phœnix, bird divine, of varied plume, Doth here new vigour from the flames assume; And as the rosy clouds of morning rise, Aurora's blush with piercing glance espies: On th' other part, the valves of heav'n unbar, The ceilings glitter speck'd with many a star, And (strange) the Gods appear; here Cupid darts His diamond arrows at immortal hearts. “Here also, Damon, you reside; elsewhere Your soft simplicity, and truth sincere: For sure Lethean glooms could ne'er acquire Thy generous spirit, and thy soul of fire. Weep we no more! our tears are now profane: Lo! Damon treads the pure ethereal plain; And walks the rainbow-floors, and converse high Holds with departed heroes in the sky; Imbibes refreshing air and softest sleep, And quaffs ambrosian joys with ruby lip. Oh! grant our pray'rs, and lend a fav'ring ear, Whether our mortal Damon's name you hear, Or Diodoti (by which title they Of elements supreme thy worth display). Type of my virgin youth, and rising age, Which wedded pleasures never could engage, Lo! thy white front a radiant circlet twines, And in thy hand the holy palm-tree shines. Thou then shalt join the full seraphic choir, Thy voice attemper'd to the silver lyre; And in melodious concert hymn the praise Of hallowed Sion, crown'd with lasting rays.” END OF VOL. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. BATTLE OF THE BARDS. AN HEROIC POEM. CANTO I. ARGUMENT. The Poet commenceth with a most pertinent, but puzzling question, which seemeth to sink him into a most sublime quandary—Sweareth a dreadful oath that he must procure a Muse, and, at length, discerneth a very suitable one—The Invocation, ejaculated in a style peculiar to himself—Apostrophizeth, and curiously enquireth the origin of such animosity between Sir Pindar and Sir Giffard— Pathetically lamenteth the evil effects of a mistake, and unravelleth the mysterious cause, à principio, of Sir Pindar's rage—Describeth the appearance of a strange monster which exhibiteth itself monthly—Displayeth the bardnivorous appetite of this ferocious animal, and, after much heroical circumlocution, concludeth the first canto with a most eloquent eulogy, and the apotheosis of Thomas Dutton, A.M., and of Anthony Pasquin, Esquire. Cedite Romani Scriptores, cedite Graii! Nescio quid majus nascitur Iliade. Vet. Poet. Frag. Retire, ye Wards, ye stout Mendoza's, yield. Behold two boxing bards usurp the field! ?Tantane cælestibus iræ? Virg. Can gentle spirits, nurs'd on milk of roses, Descend into the fist, and batter noses? Where 'mid the tuneful spinsters can I find One nymph to pugilistic charms inclin'd? Has ever muse, unmindful of her state, In Pindar's fountain wash'd a broken pate? Or grave Melpomene, in contest high, Discharg'd her blue-rag at Thalia's eye? While Bacchus held the bottle, and the Sun Delay'd his patent coach to smoke the fun? Yet, though unskill'd to batter or to bruise, By all the gods! I must invoke a muse: For ne'er, in garret perch'd, may warbling wit Presume that useful lady to omit, Till lawyers curse their clients, quacks their fees, Till taylors kick their cucumbers and peas, Till nobles pay their debts like vulgar men, Till droops the British flag, and “Chaos comes again.” Haste then, sweet nymph! and with thee bring along The mute admirers of thy tragic song: Whether thou hymn'st some youth of talents rare, Ordain'd by Fate to dance on “desert air;” Or to the echoing alleys soft complain (By pill incurable) of am'rous pain; Thou! whom a virgin of High Holborn bore, Erst, to a piper from Irene's shore, What time St. Giles, with all its splendor crown'd, Terrific, aw'd the vassal realm around; Whether at Billingsgate, propitious seat! Where eloquence and mild conviction meet, Thy “goddess-like demeanour” I survey, Another naked Venus from the sea; Or find thee some gay tap-room bow'r within, Ambrosial bow'r! all redolent of gin, Oh! come, dear Impudence!—discreetly pass The next libation of thy fav'rite glass; Come, and in all thy native graces drest, Recline inebriate on my raptur'd breast; Strong as thy bev'rage be the kindling fire, Numbers, sonorous numbers I require, Worthy thy mother, and harmonious sire! Whose pipe Orphean savage myriads led, While stones, high-bounding, jigg'd upon his head; Lur'd from their hovels cognoscenti-hogs, Quick-capering kittens, and slow-dancing dogs; Or bad sage asses musically bray: Such virtue in his charmful bladder lay. Say then (for thou the dread event must know), What anger levell'd the immortal blow? What against Giffard urg'd Sir Pindar's rage, Or arm'd Sir Giffard against Pindar's age? Uuequal match'd, a dubious doom they prove; Blameful alike,—but such the will of Jove! Dios d'eteleieto bowlè! —Omerou Ilias. What direful deeds from trifling causes spring? A bastinado'd bard, or exil'd king: What fell effects from wayward errors flow? A numscull shatter'd, or a nation's woe. Here, (but the nicer epic rule denies That quaint old-fashion'd trick to moralize), Could I through many a pensive page deplore, And sighing, dip my raven-quill in gore; Tell, through mistake, and heedless of a check, How fine Phaeton broke his comely neck; Tell, through mistake, how minions of high place In eight years slaughter drench'd the human race; Tell, through mistake, for Merry-Andrew fit, How each poor playwright deems himself a wit; Tell, through mistake, and mindful of third night, How Mimes, instead of acting, dare to write. Scribblers erroneous other dolts forsake, And libel their dull selves—the worst mistake: For from a mere mistake, perversely wrong, Rises this lofty argument of song. Long had Sir Pindar, of unrivall'd might, To Momus' birchen chaplet prov'd his right; Long had his satire prob'd each pompous sin, And stripp'd each rhiming Marsyas to the skin; Phœbus went further with poor Marsyas, for he stripped off the skin itself. A tender-hearted deity! But lo! all slovenly his uncouth lay, His powers so nervous dwindle to decay; No more by sense approv'd, or folly fear'd, The nauseous dregs of driv'ling age appear'd: Scarce one bright spark illum'd a dreary line, Mirth doz'd, and Malice caught the lucky sign; Yet Candour pitied still, with liberal mind, The tuneful Belisarius, old and blind. Hast thou not heard the undisputed fame Of these great sheets that note an author's name? Hast thou not kenn'd those furious beasts of prey That hunt lank poets in the face of day, And rav'nous on their fleshless members feed? Not fiercer Afric or Hyrcania breed. Quale portentum neque militaris Daunia in latis alit esculetis; Nec Jubæ tellus generat, leonum Arida nutrix.Hor. Oh! hast thou not, in shaggy vesture blue, Beheld that monthly monster, a Review; Wont every garret, horrible, to scour, Bloodier than bum, aye seeking to devour? A hungry tyger of this horrid crew (To the rank scen of carrion ever true) “Upturn'd into the air his nostril wide,” And from afar the drooping minstrel spied; Forth from his lair loud thunder'd critic law, Then clapp'd on Peter his tremendous paw. Whole pamphlets, in his ireful mood, he tore, Fresh-bleeding sonnets strew the letter'd floor; Meek eclogues murmur, strangled in the birth; Lampoons inflammatory load the hearth; Sad elegies their swan-like requiem breathe; Pert epigrams, still lively, smile in death; Soft am'rous odes their “balmy fragrance,” shed, And heap the desk with mountains of the dead. Felix! se nunquam amenta fuissent. Hence stern debate, hence anger, ferret-ey'd, Wolvish dissension hence, and leopard pride; Hence bull-dog battle, monkey malice hence, The mule's deep sullens, and the ass's sense; On every side wild blaz'd the wrathful soul, And either ink-stand bled at every hole. Say whence this curst mistake, bland goddess say? A name, a little name provok'd the fray; (Oh! that the vile critique was never seen, For, oh! that such a name had never been!) For Peter, at some blund'ring dæmon's call, Delug'd on innocence his missile gall; (Here innocent, at least, could he restrain Such odious hints as his own manhood stain), Levell'd at wight unknown his angry squirt, And mad, at random flung about his dirt; Fool! not to know two dunces might be found, Of title similar, on English ground; Luxuriant ground! amid whose golden corn Tall poppies lift the brow, and nod in scorn. Nor here was bounded the destructive pest, New fires inflame the brawny poet's breast, Confederate papers feed them to a blaze, And mirrors pour forth their reflecting rays; At length the censor's mighty self combines, And all the wond'rous worth of Dutton shines! Me duce damnosas homines compascita curas. Ovid. Oh, thou! infallible, with learned air, To yawn and grumble from the critic chair, Smote by the glance of whose majestic eye, The daily grubs of literature die; Whether thou deign'st, with condescension mild, To point the path of each theatric child; Or, gently physic'd by a golden pill, Squeeze the smooth flatt'ry from thine oily quill; Though reason may revolt, and satire rail, Great Dennis' Whether old John Dennis, were he living, would be pleased with the relationship, is rather a critical query. greater son, dread Dutton, hail! And thou, compatriot of a name so dear, Whatever title suit thine only ear, Williams, or Pasquin (that too clumsy veil Doth ill thy splendid ignorance conceal), Whose pompous style, and sentiment so weak, Ape Punch's lofty strut and tiny squeak, Thy diction on dry rubbish deep manure, Hail! partners of the palpable obscure; Rightful heirlooms of dark oblivion's vale, Licens'd proprietors of libel, hail! Not yours the blushes, beautiful, that break Conviction's dawn on Virtue's varying cheek: Yours, Swiss-like, av'rice of the highest price, As ready to defend as combat vice; Yours, empty Arrogance, no bound that knows; Yours, Envy's blight, that blasts the fairest rose; And yours, unconscious of the worst disgrace, A dauntless intrepidity of face. Thrice happy both! if e'er my humble rhime Fortunati ambo, si quid mea carmina possint, &amp;c.Virg. May reach the optics of remoter time, Congenial spirits, clam'rous in your praise, Shall own that fools were rife in George's days; Your volumes, thumb'd by infants yet unborn, Rare wooden prints, expressive, shall adorn; To a dead wall magnific Thespis cling, And Zoroaster dangle from a string; While bloods and drunken bullies bilk a score; While loyal coblers at elections roar; While cits delight in tawdry pantomime; While ladies deem crim. con. a venial crime; While doctors love a cane and flowing wig; While boxers hate a dun, and Jews a pig; While painted beauties ply in Drury-lane, So long your virtue, fame, and honour, shall remain. CANTO II. ARGUMENT. The second Canto openeth with a most picturesque, poetical, natural, and novel description of night—An apparition, as usual, and secundum artem, introduced—The apparition experienceth much hardship in disturbing Peter from the arms of Somnus—Moralizeth in a most spiritual harangue, and after rousing the poet, vanisheth—Morning riseth, so doth Peter—Peter seizeth an hereditary twig, and, in an evil hour, issueth forth—The poet depicteth, and laudeth Piccadilly—Discovereth Sir Giffard in the most placid posture—Various appropriate, but terrific omens—Peter's dilated bulk described, in a manner at least equal to Squire Maro's “Monstrum horrendum,” or Mr. Milton's Lucifer—A second invocation, in a hurry—The goddess Victoria astonished—Peter's Theban uncle, and Milo, the bullock-bruiser, noticed—Interrogation and reply—“A blow, by heav'n, a blow”—A simile and stare—The combat—The Cyclops—The tall Frenchman—Peter oweth much of his safety to beef—Peter's patience—Peter is vanquished and flyeth—sic transit gloria Monday! Now knaves, so studious of the sage's plan, Sought with dark lanthorns for an honest man; Now gamesters conn'd their talismanic board; Now with their wives uncourteous husbands snor'd; Now to their sweethearts tiptoe lovers crept; Now play-projectors murder'd though they slept; Now fearful rose, to punish Dutton's crimes, Plots, incidents, and spectred pantomimes; Now lords their chariots quit on festal state, While Townshend tries their passes at the gate; Now night, pale widow, in her old black gown, Peaceful, had mnffled up this precious town; Watchmen no more the nicer organs shock, But, soft as zephyr, hiccupp'd “one o'clock!” When, close by Peter's couch a goblin stood; Goblin robust, as though of flesh and blood: Thrice twitch'd his night-cap, thrice his pillow shook, Thrice pull'd the coverlid, and mournful spoke. We had many scruples about our ghost's using Peter instead of Petros, as Homer supposeth the gods to speak Greek; but as the laureat had not been long dead, we conceive in that short time he could not forget his English. “Behold the laureat, not again come back “From heav'n's ambrosia to assert his sack, “But wicked with with counsel to repay, “And warn thee of the inevitable day; “For this did Kearsley share his Sunday cheer, “Enthusiast of plumb-pudding and brown beer? “For this did Opie lend a christian look. “To the grand prototype before thy book? “Ah! feel'st thou not the anticipated jest “Of Mistress Cosway, and of Master West? “Hear'st thou not snort the famished steeds of Stubbs? “Haunt not thy vermin'd dream Sir Joseph's grubs? “Skip not his boil'd fleas, buzzing in thine ear? “Or Buller's meteor-wig dost thou not fear? “Portentous on to-morrow's dawn they low'r; “Avert, oh Peter, the disastrous hour! “The hour disgraceful shun, if fate allow, “Destin'd to rob the laurel from thy brow; “But now, on glory meditant arise!”— He spoke, and speaking sought his native skies. Clad in a suit of second-mourning hue, Uprose the morn, Uprose the sun, and uprose George the Third. Peter's Lousiad. and uprose Peter too. Wan as a death-hunter's, his visage frown'd, And wild he cast his rueful eyes around; His eyes, where feebly shone a rush-light ray, His wistful eyes, “that witness'd huge dismay.” Yet fell revenge, impatient of controul, Yet injur'd talent stung his stormy soul; Yet, Wharton's voice his learned zeal alarm'd, (Tenacious of the saw, “fore-warn'd, fore-arm'd,”) And seizing a stout twig his grandsire bore, He cough'd, and issued at the postern-door. The very worst door in the house he could have issued from: Vide Homer, where Hector made his last exit. But some modern city scholiasts differ in opinion. Quinbus Flestrin. Returning never with Pindaric pride Shall he triumphant o'er its threshold stride; But on the steps, with loose dishevell'd hair, Shall sit, unwelcome visitant, Despair. There is a street, full stately to the sight Of trav'lling clown, and Piccadilly hight; Brave street, which first I enter'd, awful thing! When I beheld St. James's and the King. But most, another Academe, this street For shop of bibliopolist is meet; Where Bond-street lounger, tir'd of vain pursuits, May contemplate on Newton, or—his boots; There hold sweet dialogue, facetious smile; There fix the fashion of an author's style; There comb his crop, there meliorate his mind, And give commands—to letter and to bind. Here, deeply studious, in an easy chair, His choler meeken'd, and compos'd his air; Warn'd by no vision of th' impending stroke, But smiling heedless at each passing joke, Ill-fated Giffard sat. The shelves around, For an illustration of the prodigies, vide Homer, Virgil, Statius, and Aristotle's masterpiece. Wing's almanac is not amiss. Convulsive, gave a hideous groan profound; The Baviad thrice, in sympathetic pain, Open'd its filial leaves, and clos'd again; The parrot burst her cage, loquacious fowl! And on the chimney perch'd the mystic owl: When lo! dilated into tenfold might, In breadth a hogshead, and a tow'r in height, In rush'd the bulk of Peter.—Muse benign, Still louder swell that penny-trump of thine; For ne'er did tilt of prowess'd Charlemagne, Or craz'd Orlando, claim a nobler strain; Though his mad capers meet the general view In half a hundred cantos, mine in two. Summon'd by Mars, who had no time to spare, 'Twixt love and war, the contest and the fair; To fix nice points of honor, cool the fray, And see both warriors come with life away; Victoria (she who left her troops behind, Heartsick, in swarthy Egypt), was assign'd: Yet she, like Festus, frighted by Saint Paul, Scarce sav'd her trembling balance from a fall, 'Till clamb'ring to the roof with hasty feet, A folio of campaigns supplied her seat; There sat she, cow'ring, like a pagod nich'd, And deem'd the bards bedevil'd or bewitch'd. Not Peter's uncle, yearly when he came To tune his crowder at th' Olympic game; Not he (though Theban chaps were rather stout) E'er saw or sung so terrible a bout; Though Milo, with one formidable box, Split the tough cranium of a bellowing ox, Peel'd off the hide to save his feet from thorns, And pick'd his teeth, at supper, with the horns. “Is Giffard here?” the maniac minstrel cry'd; Giffard, “Lo! him thou seek'st is here!” reply'd. Ecce! quem quæritis adsum, &amp;c. Virgil. “From hence then take thy ferry o'er to hell!” Right on his sconce the sturdy sapling fell; His sconce, impenetrable, scorn'd a wound, But hollow rung, and gave a mournful sound; The hollow sound which Homer placeth to the account of the armour, is here properly transferred to the scull. Quantum inest rebus inane! While horror bristled up his wond'ring hair, And strain'd each muscle to an iron stare. As when, instead of tipping half-a-crown, Some powder'd bully knocks his barber down; Or to a bard some patronizing duke, Instead of twenty pounds, returns his book; Or to some beau a bailiff in the pit, Instead of choice rappee presents a wr i; So Giffard star'd (and so perdie would you), And writh'd and scratch'd, “and wist not what to do.” Stupid awhile he stood; and ey'd the foe With frozen glare, a monument of woe: 'Till, blown by gusts of rage, his ebbing blood Foaming came back, spring-tide, a roaring flood. And now his shoulders to the work he lays, And now the blow at cent. per cent. repays. Dire blow! that threaten'd ruin to his brain; And all its embryo-brood, a harmless train; For there unfledg'd the young ideas rest, Like callow birdlings in a cuckoo's nest. If thou hast e'er th' Etnean depths explor'd, With molten rocks and flaming lava stor'd; Where old Empedocles once bruised his rump, Popp'd from its sultry summit—no bad jump: If thou hast trac'd that celebrated hole, Nor sing'd thy beard, nor burn'd thy slipper-sole; Then hast thou seen at an infernal heat The one-ey'd brethren on their anvil beat; Quaff down, like purl, amid their maudlin tricks, Full pots of Periphlegeton and Styx; Then well-refresh'd their noisy trade renew, And bang till e'en the fire itself was blue. So, capable King Harry's mail to crack, Read the battle of the angels in Paradise Lost, and make no unfair or invidious comparison: fiat justitia, ruat cœlum. Associate fists keep time on Peter's back; In “regular confusion,” they descend, And Parthian prentices, at either end, Discharge their coward cuffs, and partial succour lend. But, chief of stature, cminently tall, Fit living skeleton for surgeon's hall, A bony Frenchman thy assailants led, Gloomy as death! where most the battle bled: Him shall thy future lays to fame consign, And therefore he shall grace no verse of mine. Had not thy ribs (a seas' nable relief), Been compass'd with a triple coat of beef, Though patience was thy only plaister then, Most patient of the fretful sons of men! Had not its valiant sirloin fill'd thy breast, By heav'n! thy patience ne'er had stood the test; Though patience was thy only plaister then, Most patient of the fretful sons of men: For lo! like Bajazet, to please the rout, The victors in, now turn the vanquish'd out. See the apostrophe in the Eneid on Pallas's learthern girdle being taken by Turnus, as Peter's cane was. Victors in vain!—them cvery month shall goad With keen epistle, and musquito ode; Them, penitent too late of foul abouse, Shall grinning Satire from their dens produce; Them, angel Truth with radiant shafts assail, While Modesty destroys the sland'rous tale; Forgot each other butt of song severe, Them, piecemeal, shall his fury-pamphlets tear; For them shall he desert the weaker side, And, ev'n to kings a couplet be deny'd. Discomfited, deject, with bleeding brow, Alarm'd, his fav'rite mob forsake him now; Yet 'gainst yon fatal shop that caus'd his pain He hurls his unappeasable disdain; Some great revenge he plans, and frames the fall Of master, counter, 'prentices, and all: Glorious emprize! then, mindful of his head, He groans, and surly seeks a 'pothecary's shed. Et gemitu, fugit indignata sub Umbras. Virg. THE RETROSPECT. A DEDICATORY SONNET To the Right Honourable THE COUNTESS OF MOIRA, &amp;c. Deem'st Thou ingrate or dead the Shepherd-boy, Erewhile who sung thee to the list'ning plain? Still pausing on thy deeds with pensive joy, Ingratitude, nor Death have hush'd the strain! Still drest in all her captivating hues, Smiling in tears, will languishingly steal O'er my fantastic dream the much-lov'd muse, Like morn dim-blushing thro' its dewy veil. Her wild-flow'rs bound into a simple wreath, Meekly she proffers to thy partial sight; Oh! softly on their tender foliage breathe! Oh! save them from the Critic's cruel blight! Nurse the unfolding bloom with care benign, And mid them weave one laurel-leaf of Thine! Thomas Dermody. THE RETROSPECT. Vita enim nostra videtur ad Virilitatem usque, qua in statu posita est, quendam quasi pontem ætatis ascendere, ab eâque dehine descendere. De Nores in Art. Poet. Through History's faithful glass when I survey What kingdoms flourish, and what realms decay; Now touch'd with pity, now inspir'd with rage, Scarce can I trust the long-recorded page; New fatal proofs from ancient annals call, Yet deem these ancient annals, fable all. Lo! once in learned pomp where Athens rose The green pool stagnates, and the hemlock grows; One dreary sepulchre, one mingled gloom, Lo! deep in ruin droops imperial Rome. Say, where that wide unconquerable sway Where once the Macedonian Madman lay? Burst like a gaudy bubble on the stream, 'Tis past, and all its glory but a dream. Yet, since, see Venice, solitary isle, Like Venus, mid the genial ocean smile; With awe, the rich Columbian tract behold Clasp half our globe in its gigantic fold; Britain, sublime its subject shores among, And fair Juverna, nurse of lofty song. Through heedless luxury, ambitious pride; Through lust of plunder, or through heav'n defy'd; When slow destruction mines the towery wall, When the huge pillars of a nation fall, Succeeding nations gradual fill its place, To swell of boundless Time the mighty space. In climes least favour'd by benignant skies, The white sails flap, and stately bulwarks rise; Commerce and patient Industry achieve What Sloth and Opulence untempted leave. Soon the dry wilderness is seen no more; Huge cities shine where deserts lay before: Mid the deep glen amaz'd the hermit views The long canal, the garden's vernal hues; Or by the mountain's rough but sheltering side, The newly-risen hamlet's rustic pride. Yet why should I lament as I survey How kingdoms flourish, and how realms decay, When ev'n in my own youth's unfinished bound, Each strange vicissitude of fortune's found; And all the changes of the tragic scene Glare full as copious on the rural green. Each dear delight of childhood's cloudless morn, When blush'd the rose without the fest'ring thorn; Each harmless sport that vacant pastime knew, False to hoar reason, to gay fancy true, With eagle-pinion rolling o'er my head Sadly I mourn,—and sicken when they're fled. Thus the poor peasant mourns, when homeward bound, (As the dank eve-dew settles on the ground,) His decent cottage canopy'd in trees, One ruddy blaze, with horrent hair, he sees! Each mouldering fragment of domestic care Pausing he marks, ineffable despair! Still o'er the little couch, the table's frame, The beachen seat, pursues the greedy flame; Nor from the spot averts his gaze forlorn, Till high in air the native hut is torn. O! ne'er let me forget the summer shade, Where studious thro' its fragrant copse I stray'd; Where slow I wander'd thro' the waving bow'r, When the leaves bent beneath a stilly show'r, And woodland echo, soften'd to a sigh, Scarce caught a sound, unwilling to reply. Ev'n now Imagination's forceful sway Through each long landscape hurries me away; The well known cliff, whose blue aerial brow Majestic beetles on the vale below; The daisy'd pasture, whose luxuriant plain The dim discover'd flocks, a snowy train, Profusely deck; and dripping from the tide, Shake to the flashing sun their fleecy pride, Unmov'd I view:—nay, the train hedge along I hearken to the ploughboy's matin song; Or follow on the crumbling path afar The lazy passage of the creaking car. Hark! from yon hill that centres in the cloud, I hear the opening hound, and hunter loud; His bugle winds thro' many a tuneful maze; The mellow tones my sinking spirit raise; And down the virid steep, with headlong speed Impell'd, I mount a visionary steed! Now, sooth'd again, with slow and skilful eye, Eager, I watch my friends fictitious fly, By some lone bank, along whose level side, Dimpling and quick the lucid waters glide; His pensile bait the speckled trout beguiles, At length he's caught, at length the angler smiles; At length, with cautious and well-guided hand, He trails the glittering captive on the sand. Oh! sweet repast, when for the wish'd embrace, Two cherub-rivals his mild visage trace; Climb on his knee, surround his easy chair, And hope, elate, the shining spoil to share: Meanwhile, with looks of meek paternal love, He seems with gentle pushes, to reprove; Yet, as they struggle, tenderly severe, Drops on each baby-cheek a silent tear. Say what ye will, ye sons of classic art, Whose finewrought fancies seldom reach the heart, Ev'n in life's humblest, most contracted span, We mark the nobler principles of man: The watch-dog beaten from the wicker'd door, To give an easy entrance to the poor; The busy care by tenderness made light, To strew the pilgrim's rushy bed at night; Or round the glimmering hearth, with wonder pale, And simple awe, to note the soldier's tale. These sweet civilities, these social ties, In which the very spring of nature lies, Are of more worth than all the glossing rhyme, Your schoolmen polish'd from remotest time. Eternal Nature! thine the mighty pow'r To rule o'er every sense in every hour; The mastery thine with absolute controul, To wring, correct, or sublimate the soul; Confest to thy superior eye is seen The mazy movements of the nice machine; Thy secret influence, thy sovereign call, Commands them when to rise and where to fall; And in the sultan's and the negro's frame Thy rapid force is general and the same. Nor small the task with no frail varnish fraught, To deck in sylvan dress, the sylvan thought, Peculiar art it claims, and oft requires Than the bold epic more exalted fires; Fires, that each fibre to their purpose wrest, Electric, rushing on the ravish'd breast. Hence, unoppos'd, in full despotic fame, Sweet Auburn's bard must ever be the same; Hence, the fair descant wove in Memory's loom, Perennial rose and myrtle shall perfume; Hence, way ward minstrel of th' attentive vale, The village curate pour his pleasing tale; Hence, too, the heart its choicest incense breathe On warbling Sympathy's immortal wreath. Though here no foreign wonders I rehearse, Tuneful enchantment in each vary'd verse; Here, tho' no bright resistless magic shines, Which rapture moulds, and classic care refines; Nor mystic melodies of measur'd sound That wild'ring, lead the servient passions round; Yet, unambitious of a larger claim, My subject not less humble than my aim, Perchance I hold, with pardonable grace, The muse's mirror up to Nature's face. For me enough; (if aught my verse may boast Of genuine feeling, where refinement's lost,) From the dull crowd my straggling sense to wean; To charm the critics of the village-green; To bid their innocent amusements shew All public vice the source of private woe; And to the lewd metropolis unfold These laws, to love, which is but to behold. Oh! mid the venal city who can prove That sweetest, that divinest passion, Love? Balm of all wounds, without whose solace mild, Existence were a melancholy wild! In sullen hate where hostile tribes would run Unciviliz'd, and loath the rising sun; Oh! who without his store of scorn compleat, Can see it purchas'd in the public street? The venom'd fold, the mercenary kiss; The murdering rapture, and the baleful bliss; The softest luxury of soaring thought, Oh! who can see like each low barter—bought? Pity the wretched daughter of despair, Nor slight her sorrow, tho' you shun her snare: She once in beauteous innocence was blest; Pure was her pleasure, tranquil was her rest; And at the song obscene, the lawless flame, And broken vow, she blush'd unconscious shame. Once fenced with honour as the thorny rose, Now bare she lies to every wind that blows; Like some vile weed, impregnate with decay, Which rots, yet stings athwart the public way.— Art thou not shock'd that dulcet voice to hear Tun'd to the felon-oath and scoff severe? And art thou not still doubly shock'd to find That voice's echo in th' abandon'd mind? Ev'n in the loose delight no bliss she feels: The purse she pilfers, the rich toy conceals; Acts with feign'd passion the incentive part, Her features less disguis'd than is her heart. Hence ever, ev'n in the delicious fold The muscles slacken, and the pulse is cold: The lillies blacken on the harlot's face, Hence lusty health is chill'd in the embrace. Oh! from that hollow cheek, and beamless eye, Precipitate as from a fury fly; Though silently its painted beauties seize, There lurk the fiends Distraction and Disease; Scowl in the dimple, taint the fragant breath, And in the very clasp present you death. How, lovely woman! how can you depart From all those graceful fires that warm the heart? How, witching prodigal, can you bestow Your brighest gem for infamy and woe? Roseless the cheek, extinguish'd is the eye, And even your darling vanity must die.— Ask yon pale wretch, deserted and decay'd, Whose easy trust some villain has betray'd, If all her vital senses are not cold, Cold as some statue in the venal fold; When gay deceit, (heart-sick, yet gay) must move The sleeping embers of unhallow'd love. Oh! she will tell you, and she tells you true, That she the seraph transport never knew; That from the dragon-grasp, the baneful breath Of each wild suitor, came disgust and death; Since first within that glowing breast she lay From whence she fled:—ah! lost, lamented day. Then turtle Peace that unbought odours shed, Truth, feeling, faith, and maiden candour fled; Then thou poor female! from thy hopeless view, Clad in thick clouds, ev'n heav'n itself withdrew! Oft by the sloping outskirts of the wood, Fond search, thro' brake and bramble I pursu'd, Intent, (nor could it with her lip compare,) To cull the honey'd strawberry for my fair. When at the village-dance her hand I caught, My feet were light, and restless as my thought; By times, the coy extended kiss I stole, While mutual glances stream'd the melting soul; But when some wealthier youth her cheek imprest, A thousand timid falsehoods fill'd my breast; I rav'd, I wept, I curs'd the guiltless maid, And at deep midnight sought a deeper shade; Yet, soon, the partial heart was reconcil'd, I own'd my frailty, and the angel smil'd. She smil'd—thro' winding dell, by ozier'd stream The livelong summer-day she was my theme; From every object of the boundless plain I snatch'd some grace to decorate my strain. Blue as the violet's bell her rolling eye; Cowslip her front, her cheek the tulip's dye; Her mouth carnation, hyacinth her hair; Straight as the poplar, as the woodbine fair; And from her nect'rine breath, that fann'd my flame, The peabloom and the scented clover came. Yes, in the ready numbers as they flow'd, My feelings flutter'd, and my wishes glow'd; Unnumber'd monuments of truth I form'd, Nought tir'd, with my own pleasing folly charm'd, 'Till smote at length by reason's temperate ray, The transitory vision died away. So have I seen, with brittle chain embost, When the smooth river sleeps beneath the frost, By tiny fingers rear'd an icy pile; Its sparkling points the dazzled sight beguile; Lo! proudly splendid in the solar beam, Twinkle its corners, its thin columns gleam; Till, melted quite, or on false surface plac'd, Prone the moist structure lies, a shining waste! Oh! Wray, associate of the smiling hour When dewy summer spread life's opening flow'r, Long parted from my pleasure or my pain, Where'er you wander, oh! accept this strain. Whate'er its lights disclose, or shades conceal, Their force your kindred spirit best can feel. Enthusiast of the wildly-simple scene, In what romantic raptures have we been? What gales favonian on our forehead blew, Upon our ken what swelling beauties grew? What radiant turrets, flamy spires would rise? How green our haunts! how azure were our skies! How musical the burnish'd billows roll'd, And how the prospect gleam'd with living gold! Each slightest object, or of shore, or sea, Was tenderest ecstacy when shar'd with thee; For, ne'er, sublim'd by Feeling's social spell, Did delicate sensations join so well. Mutual our joy, and when condemn'd to part, Ah! mutual, more than mutual was the smart. From that sad moment paradisial bloom And orient hues, are solitude and gloom! Diffusive, checquer'd o'er the dale beneath, When purple Twilight rested on the heath, When from the furze the nimble rabbit sprung, And on each spray unusual lustre hung, What way ward forms, eccentrically fair, Have I oft pictur'd on the dappled air? While, dropt by the fantastic hand of Ev'n, Small countless specks have pav'd the floor of heav'n: There mid the silver scenery would I roam, Nor though the church-bell tinkled, think of home. Oh! when to Friendship's curious ear I told Heroic feats, and godlike acts of old, Which (maxims meet for my unpractic'd age,) Haply I glean'd from the historic page, How blithe would I the breezy hillock climb, And in the big narration swell sublime! Then, when aloft Night's pale assembly rose, What downy slumbers of divine repose? What gay ideas throng'd the frolic dream? What mental joys the aëry wing would stream! No bowl, with palatable poison fill'd, Fev'rish, and foul, my aching forehead thrill'd; No malice, rankling in th' eternal wound; No fierce desire was in my bosom found; But round my pillow would undaunted play Content, still reckless of the coming day. Soon as cold Zephyr woke the virgin Morn, And the bright dew-drop trembled on the thorn, Up the green lane I stray'd; on either side In thickest notes each vocal bush reply'd; My tongue was silent, printless was my tread; The Spring's whole choir collected o'er my head, Entranced I stood; lull'd by pure Mantuan lays, Or, what sage Dyer pip'd to later days; The world forgot me, I the world forgot, And my elysium centred in that spot. Now tow'rds yon castle, whose tall turrets shake On the smooth bosom of the shaded lake, I turn; hoarse ravens croak in solemn state; The frisking pointer meets me at the gate; Crows the shrill cock, the turkey gobbles near, All seem to indicate my welcome there. Thro' the wide room the hasty servants run; Here limps the nurse, there creeps the butler's son; While, inly fir'd with military pride, I count the shatter'd pikes on every side: The pointless faulchion, thro' its scabbard thrust; The massy bible, strew'd with reverend dust; The sable chess-board, on the wainscot laid; The pensive kitten, purring in the shade; The dusky glass, half-glist'ning in the sun; Hook'd o'er the antique hearth the rusty gun; The sculptur'd desk, the pictures in a row; The fox's tail, and fishing-net I know! There once plump Hospitality would sit, Grey-bearded Health, plain Sense, and native Wit: In the brown cup they wash'd all pride away, And not one poor man round them but was gay; By sober rules they spent their small estate, Kept want aloof, nor wish'd a higher fate. For, all that frugal nature claims below, Nature's own hoards abundantly bestow. When for superfluous treasure we intreat, Sour in possession, though in prospect sweet, Kindness, not cruelty, the wish denies, So weak is erring man, and God so wise! Their fields, their flocks, their harvest-heaps could give Enough, to bid them and their children live. All else beyond, to no profusion led, But lent the wretch a supper and a bed. Erewhile, the model of a man I knew, Who made, ev'n then, my best encomium true: Early, in this bad world's profuse career, Himself profuse, he bought experience dear; With still enough, 'twas all his last desire, To line his couch, and light his country fire; Back he return'd from the distracting din Of pageant villainy and painted sin, Convinced, (the keen conviction cost a tear,) That humbler merit had no business there. With cordial glee the hoary sires attend, With sparkling eyes they meet their good, old friend; In foaming tankards frequent healths go down, And all inquire, how he escap'd the town? 'Twere well would many a titled heir, who longs For olive arbours and Italian songs, Trace the same sapient track, no longer roam, But learn to propagate his wealth at home: Hence, might the sturdy arm which help'd to raise That wealth, attain its profit, and its praise. Just by the path way rose his neat abode, As if to woo the trav'ler from the road; Before, a chrystal vein of water stood, Behind, 'twas shadow'd by a waving wood. The green-ey'd duck that waddled in the yard; The gritting wheel that on the pavement jarr'd; The flail, with sudden dash that stunn'd the ear; The plaint, that gurgled from the dove-house near; The playful curs that would each other chase; All lent the whitewash'd dome a pastoral grace: And all, by spleen-sick Fashion unconfin'd, Were but the copious comment of his mind. Yes, happy master of that small domain! Thine was the honest blessing of the swain; With thy big praise the stranger's breast would glow, Still doubly dear to every child of woe. Yes, thou wouldst smile, unselfishly o'erjoy'd, To view the peasant in thy field employ'd; From thence procuring (there no need to steal,) For his weak tribe the comfortable meal; Delightful toil! while the slow load he led Of golden grain, a family he fed; Then at hush'd eve, the chaste connubial kiss Was his reward, and Love's domestic bliss. Nor did he (oft in heav'n-ward sigh exprest,) Forget the generous donor of his rest. Ev'n cradled infant, taught by nurturing dame, Full well could lisp its second father's name. Thus lives the good man!—how a country sighs With genuine anguish, when the good man dies! Musing, behold athwart yon black'ning mead, In solemn march his funeral pomp proceed; Pride and protector of the mournful throng, Sad burthen! see him slowly mov'd along; Far off the long procession's dusky hue Now ent'ring at the churchyard-gate I view, And, now, while its new guest looks down from heav'n, Falls the full tear, and dust to dust is giv'n; From hearts his bounty eas'd, what sorrows rise? That last shriek was his passport to the skies! Kind, courteous spirit, affably benign, Round thy glad front serenest glories shine! On everlasting archives are anneal'd, These deeds thy virtuous diffidence conceal'd; Nor shall thy gen'rous mem'ry fade on earth; Theme of the summer seat, and evening hearth, Primrose and pansy, bath'd in pearly dew, On thy green sod ethereal fingers strew; And palmer piety's ambrosial wreath Entwines the desolating scythe of death. Ah! ye hard landlords, can no plea prevail To keep your tardy tenant from the jail? Will you, for losses he could not avert, Unkindly wring the suffering parent's heart? In tenfold woe the widow's portion steep, And pluck its morsel from the orphan's lip? Ev'n now your surly slaves their victim seize, Three pallid infants shrieking at his knees; His skirt they grasp, they mount for the embrace, And hope to read some comfort in his face. Ye thoughtless great, with supercilious eye Daily who pass the naked wanderer by, Who grudge one mite of that enormous store You idly squander, to the shivering poor, How can you talk of sympathies refin'd, The liberal spirit and th' extensive mind? Oh! witness Heav'n! with heart and door unshut, The labouring hind that shrinks into his hut, Whose latch the mendicant may freely raise, Nor for the little alms exhaust his praise, More virtue oft, more native honour knows Than grandeur strutting in his birth-day clothes. I see him, having prest his homely fare, Pursue some cherish'd trav'ler with a pray'r; And thank in secret the indulgent sky That gave him pow'r to wipe the weeping eye. Cherubic Charity, how soft a show'r Of balm benign thy silent favours pour? In the dark dungeon how thy presence charms, Aims the fond hope, the blighted project warms, Pervades, with open hand, the sorrowing earth, And to misfortune lends the laugh of mirth. In thy most winning, most resistless mien, Thou deign'st to visit the sequester'd scene, There the sick couch from ruder blast defend, And art its best physician and its friend! Nor deem that Penury can ne'er invade, With sharpest anguish, the forbidden shade: A weak surmise! mid wintery snows severe, Her bleakest residence is often there. Where in that marshy desert far away The rushlight flings its intermitting ray, With sickness leagu'd, from Pity's eye remov'd, Her pangs, and speechless agonies are prov'd! On the damp clay, or scanty straw reclin'd, With scarce a tatter'd cov'ring from the wind, There, fever-struck, a sire delirious lies, There with convulsive gasp a mother dies; Unheard, ascends the miserable cry, And fainting sob, of famish'd infancy. While costly physic tends the couch of state, Cold, cold, this night, and comfortless your fate; No dose to lull, no potion to sustain, But the deep thunder, and the rattling rain! Oh! Saving Power, when rough inclement hail, And showery sleet, the wand'ring lamb assail! At midnight o'er the distant mountain stray'd, To Thee he bleats, nor bleats in vain for aid; Thy impulse soft to some thick shelter guides, Dries the wet turf, the wholesome herb provides, Nor leaves thy harmless trust, till, pacing by, The shepherd marks him with a careful eye. Yet, melancholy thought, shall man not hear Thy sweet embosom'd accents whisp'ring near? Shall hapless man, with solitary moan Destin'd to die, escape thy gaze alone? Oh! wilt not Thou by the hard pillow stand, Blend the cool draught, and stretch the healing hand? All kindness Thou, thy intervening form Alike defends the warrior and the worm; The dole of good in just libration weighs, Nor plunders those to dissipate on these. From man, base fellow man, all sorrows spring; 'Tis his ungentle slight imprints the sting, He tears the wound, his skill alone can close, 'Tis he that revels in a brother's woes! Branded with all the curses of the dead, Hide, villain, hide thy pestilential head, Whose latent wile, and unsuspected snare, Has at Affliction's threshold fix'd Despair; Ne'er to offended Mercy, impious, dare In death's fore grasp to violate a pray'r; At thy dark deeds the palsy'd cheek is pale, The stiff blood curdles at th' infernal tale: To savage wastes begone, where human eye May ne'er thy desecrated hovel spy, Where the gaunt wolf, and shaggy bear may be For thy profane retreat, fit company! When the last arrowy splendors streak the air, What as yon orchard so divinely fair? How meltingly the borrow'd tints unite On the round balls the crimson and the white? As half amid their clustering leaves they hide, In blushes deeper than the morning dy'd. Oh! cease your farewel to the setting sun, Ye shriller throats!—the nightingale's begun; A note so soft, so querulously clcar, Starts from the closing lid th' obedient tear, While contemplation heaves a tribute sigh Enrapt, and silent droops he knows not why. Away now all ye noisy storms of day, Ye narrow passions, envious feuds, away; Away, ye sounding rattles of this world, When to the dungeon from the throne is hurl'd Ambition's maniac, and his jewell'd head In grim mock-triumph to the scaffold led; Let Fortune's minions worship at her shrine, For what I've got sincerest thanks be mine; Fatal expence will drain the coffer'd ore, When gratitude may make my trifle more: Hail Gratitude! of Truth the lovely child; O'er thee, the gods, in glittering synod smil'd: To thee the intellectual charm they gave, White Honour, with Discretion, truly brave, Mild as the halcyon mid the howling wave! Whilom, what wayward ditties would I frame? My tender breast then emulous of fame; Ev'n then, when the sage pedagogue austere, For tuneful truantry would draw the tear, Ev'n then, I melted in melodious joy, With wild wreaths quaintly crown'd, the Muse's boy! My song to hear, with venerable mien, And brow-intent, the parish-clerk would lean; And conn'd by rote, the garrulous barber knew To spread each sonnet the whole village through. Nor was the village negligent of rhime, There, minstrels were rever'd since eldest time; Nor ceas'd my Hareton's relics to inspire The sprightly viol, and th' heroic lyre. Romantic Hareton! in thy fairy glade, All seasons, and their sweetness, were display'd; Thy fairy glade, where elfin bevies dance, Twinkling their light heels to the lunar glance; Whether coy Spring disclos'd her balmy store, Trembling, and scar'd by blasts she felt before; Or Summer, high her sheafy crest would raise, Luxurious nodding in the noontide blaze; Or matron Autumn's browner beauties leave Their pensive pressure on the gleaming eve; Or ev'n mid central Winter's icy bound, Some dear, peculiar blessings might be found; There, there, erewhile, th' enamour'd eye could trace Blessings that blossom'd in no other place. Ah! o'er the Tuscan beverage I may try, What madding joys in wassail tumult lie; To distant shores depart, where deep enshrin'd Lascivious banquets lull the vanquish'd mind, Yet still lay real happiness behind! Though winds round Maro's cottage Mincio's rill, Though Mulla, taught by Spencer, murmurs still, Yet Shannon, may thy wizard waters tell Of bards who struck the many-chorded shell; Though Maro triumph'd in Augustan sway, Though great Eliza smil'd on Spencer's lay, Yet, princely Moira, may my artless line Boast no ignoble patronage in thine! Ah! poesy, on whose superior state Innum'rous ills, and daily perils wait, Full oft have I had cause, (if woe severe A cause can give,) thy converse to forswear; Yet, with those various evils in thy train, Methinks thy pleasure far exceeds thy pain. As through the frothing surge, with desperate sweep, The smooth keel cuts and harrows up the deep; While the tough cordage cracks, and yelling lond The fierce north blusters in the frozen shroud; In this pent vessel's narrow womb confin'd, Slave to the mercy of the wave and wind; Who sets my bold unshackled fancy free? Who, oh! celestial visitant! but thee? The hazel-bow'r, for studious leisure wove; The boxen seat amid the ivy'd grove; The nibbling sheep, that fed the tufts among; The goats, that on the giddy summit hung; The weather-mark that whistled to the wind; The crooked path, where mingled bri'rs entwin'd; The startling thrush that warbled as he flew; Dear former sights! oh! when shall I review? Say, how can cruel memory retain Those pleasures here, which but augment my pain? Here, where full many a dismal tempest past, At the still hour, the frequent corse is cast In the wide deep, without one sacred tear;— Meanwhile, distinct to musing fancy's ear, Wan ghosts, slow-rising from their wat'ry grave, Moan to the murmur of the falling wave. Yet, vain delusion, I expect once more, Secure to sit, nor dread the billowy roar; Bound o'er the thicket, gambol on the lawn, And taste of all the transports I have drawn. Grant me, oh! God, immensely good and wise, That quiet cell where true religion lies, Where modes of faith, and bigot strife aside, Conscience itself the generous act will guide; The monkish cowl, the drear monastic gloom; The saintly gaud and consecrated tomb, Despis'd; let instinct, each revolving hour, In every part embrace the Sovereign Pow'r! Let every bird I hear, and bud I see, Still closer link my grateful soul to Thee; For, each fresh object of my fostering care, The shrub I rear'd, its fruit I wish'd to share; The flight, the throb of thought, the magic line, Thou gav'st them all, and all of them are Thine! THE MOURNER. By yon unhallow'd trunk, whose leafless form, Rocks to each spectred blast, that sweeps the vale, Where famish'd ravens shriek amid the storm, And flashing fires their withered haunts assail, The child of sorrow sat with musing eye; Meanwhile, the happy hamlet slept around, Oft heaved, in agony, the bursting sigh; Oft sunk, exhausted, on the baneful ground. The tall grass shiv'ring to the moaning wind, Seem'd like harsh thunder to his frighted ear, For by his trembling side, before, behind, Stood all the aguish fiends of dubious Fear. “Ah is it thus the Lord of Nature lies? Thus from his broken heart the accents flow? Thus streams contrition from his haggard eyes? A miserable majesty of wo “Say what avails to strike the seraph wire, The soul to soften, or the breast inflame? What boots the soldier's valour, poet's fire, Or, (that poor meed of all their labour) fame? “The vex'd stream winding thro' its pebbly course Shall in the main its liquid journey end; Life's stream, alas! of every care the source, Can ne'er its slow and turbid progress mend, “'Till rolling down the awful gulph of death, Its eddying surges mock the aching sight; Hoarse-murmuring echo thro' the vaults beneath, And solitary pierce the solid night. “Poor pensioners of Fate, with doubt our doom, Forsaken infants in this peopled wild; Whose only comforts lean upon the tomb, By airy schemes of future bliss beguil'd. “Away! some demon rules the savage globe; (Not He, whose matchless mercy feels for all,) Some demon clad in slaughter's purple robe, The rebel tyrant of our crazy ball! “Away, would he, as pitiful, as great, See virtue struggling with her felon foes? See puny pride with merit's spoils elate, And horror's grin malign at feeling's throes? “Would not the sleeping thunderbolt arise, The lurid ruin sheet the breaching air, His own red arm throw back the clouded skies, And bid, (dread words!) “Mortality despair?” “Assured in this, why longer should I brook The rising mischiefs of each rising day? The stab in dimples wreathed, the angry look, The killing scorn, and some Infernal's sway? “No, I will fly to him, my bosom's God; The God of truth, the bountiful, the brave; His justice soon shall fix my last abode, Whose nod can punish, or, whose nod can save. “Conscious of no ill deed, which honest worth At Heavn's tribunal to my charge could lay, On the long road of death I venture forth, With hope alone to chear me on the way.” He said, and smote his heart; the well-aim'd blow Was met by being in a tide of gore: His pulse paused short, his frame forgot to glow, He fell—The child of sorrow was no more. THE POWERS OF PAINTING. From Hyperion's purple wain, Pendent o'er the western main, Twinkling through the twilight shade, Arrowy lines of splendor play'd; Silence, on her pinion clos'd, Deaf to sorrow's wail, repos'd, Save, that where fresher buds betray The silver streamlet's sinewy way; A Naïad, all to song unknown, With moist heel slipp'd from stone to stone, And stole adown the haunted dale, To chide the tardy nightingale; When, his beechen bow'r beneath, Hung with many a field-flow'r wreath, Pensive Painting, first, essay'd The semblance of a fav'rite maid: Fancy!—whom he oft had seen, Nymph-like, tripping o'er the green, Richly dight in varied hues, (By her side the tendant Muse,) What time, with heav'n's own dyes imprest, The glitt'ring rainbow zon'd her breast. Artless, first, the sketch began; Rude the pencil's early plan; 'Till from the waving wood behind, Whose foliage shook without a wind, Proud to fan his genuine flame, The pitying Pow'rs of Painting came. First, in decent garb array'd, Succinct with pearly clasp her stole, Slow advanc'd a meek-ey'd maid, And curb'd the workings of his soul; With easy grace her state she mov'd; Each fault her patient touch improv'd; The long, luxuriant line She gave with chaster charm to flow; And, from her blue cloud's ruby-tinctur'd glow, Pleas'd Beauty, stooping, smil'd upon Design. Next appear'd a twin-like pair; One, flush'd with bloom, divinely fair; Dusky one, of negro-race, Yet amiable cither face; Quick they thrid the checquer'd maze, Borrowing still, and lending aid, While the mellowing tint betrays The sweet diversity of Light and Shade. But who is she, Costume. exactly drest, With classic care, in Attic vest? Her slender leg with buskin bound: And now, still changing as she turns, Bright on her starry front the turban burns; Anon, with Roman casque, or Indian plumag crown'd; Behind her follow, Science, daring youth! And taleful Mem'ry, and Historic Truth. But oh! how rich the bosom-shrine, Op'ning to thy pure possession, Thou! whose eyes so softly shine, How they languish!—fond Expression! On the finish'd piece they pour Saintly-fading gleams of glory; O'er each scene, and o'er each story, Breathing an irradiate show'r: Whether, (fair Colouring ardent by thy side,) On opal tow'r thou fling'st thy moonlight-beam; Or tinge the murd'rer's poignard, slaughter-dy'd, And shed strange horrors on the sanguine stream; Or, inly bleeding, while he bends to trace The sacred scroll of long-remember'd woe; Thy spell anneals the tears, that, ling'ring flow, Down the pale ruins of the lover's face! THE SOLDIER'S ABSENCE, AND RETURN. Lonely, by the moon's faint lustre Trembling o'er the twilight scene, Beauteous Mary, roam'd, sad-musing, Wildly pale, with pensive mien! As the dear ideas, crowding On her anguish'd thought, succeed, Silent falls the tender tribute, Deep the wounded feelings bleed. “Where, oh! where, reclines my soldier? On what pillow rests thy head? Might this poor distracted bosom, Hold thee living, love, or dead! Might I to thy fond tale listen, Might I thy soft accents hear, Smooth thy brow of every furrow, Drop in every wound a tear! When returning from the battle, Might my fondness chear thy sight, Each exploit, each deed recounting, Thankful, through the livelong night. Or, at azure-dawn departing, When shrill trumpets rend the air, Might I fire thy breast with valour, Might I breathe one fervent pray'r! Here, alas! retired I linger, Dream thy fancy'd danger's o'er; View that face, in charming vision, I, perchance, shall view no more. Often too, sad, saddest omen! Mid the slaughter'd heaps I rove, With hurried hand, each corse unveiling, Terror leading anxious love! Pow'r of pity, whose broad target Throws the rapid sword aside, Catch, oh! catch each fatal bullet, Be his champion, be his guide! Instant, as she spoke, advancing, Lo! her blooming hero came; Sweetly fierce in manly beauty, Crown'd with conquest, wealth, and fame. Lock'd awhile, in soft embraces, Sacred intercourse! they lay; 'Till the early drum rebounding, Loudly call'd the welcome day. THE POOR SCHOLAR. Ah me! that Learning should be so forlorn, That oer the heath her houseless son must stray; Or pillowing on yon turf, beneath the thorn, His aching head, await the cheerless day! Suspended from his satchel'd back, behold Of ancient classics a compendious store; Full ill they feed, or fence him from the cold, Those ancient classics, like himself, were poor. Yet often has he charm'd th' untutor'd ear, With tales, the blind, old bard of Chios sung; Oft, the rude hind has shed a gen'rous tear, As Dido's anguish trembled on his tongue. Oft, has his magic made ev'n misers feel, And turn'd, on rusty hinge, their stubborn door; Season'd, with Attic salt, their coarsest meal, And, with the Roman Style, Or Stylus. eras'd his score. Oft, has the gossip's talk, by blazing hearth, Eternal talk! been silenc'd for his strain; Oft, has the whizzing wheel, and rustic mirth, Subsided in his ditty's am'rous pain; Meanwhile, the plodding brow, and stupid stare, Proclaim'd the triumph of his mystic lore, That won with mighty words the village-fair.— Ah! transient triumph! now proclaim'd no more. Remorseless, now, each former host is found, Satiate of treasures from his mental mine, Deaf to the soft Æolic's silver sound, Nay, unrewarded by a golden line. Admir'd in vain, though from yon leafless spray, The nightingale prolongs her various note, Will the grave owl, fell kite, or prattling jay, One feather lend to patch her russet coat? What plumy patron helps to form her nest? Or, with a straw, repays the minstrel mild? Yet lo! the thorn deep-rankling in her breast, She fills th' unconscious wood with warblings wild. To Genius useless his Elysian dreams; Will mortgag'd Pindus save him from a jail? Or Tagus' or Pactolus' precious streams? The Muses, seldom, are sufficient bail. What talents in yon tatter'd form may meet, Now to ambition dead, and lost to hope; Some new Erasmus, to preside o'er wit, Some second Luther, to pull down a Pope! No glitt'ring branch had he, his course to guide Through college-fellows in their Stygian hall, The deep Cerberean mouth who open wide, And, triple-tongu'd, for opiate dainties call: Nor Arabic, nor Coptic, did he learn, Nor Runic, nor Formosan can he speak; But if the Greek may, haply, serve his turn, Not Scaliger could thunder purer Greek. Sententious Sallust, Tacitus succinct, And Livy's grace, and Tully's tuneful flow, In bright assemblage, has his study linkt: What more did Strada, Celebrated for his Latinity. or old Vossius know? And crabbed Logic featly can he chop; And problems intricate expound with ease: Proud sophisters! your vain distinctions drop, And, while he begs, oh! blush for your degrees! See, from the wicker'd door, with yelp severe, True cynic, as in tub e'er took his seat, The peasant's cur, with sharp-erected ear, And wagging tail, avert his vagrant feet: His churlish master see! with grim malign, In dull derision, shake his brainless head; Nor, may he, with “the tale of Troy divine,” Pelops, or Thebes, procure a scanty bed. Beneath the midnight dews, and angry Jove, Forc'd with th'unshelter'd savage to abide, His lot to pity may that savage move, And mock the falsehood of man's reas'ning pride. But, such the baleful influence of that pow'r, That, with misfortune, wrings the lonely mind; Ev'n amid Nature's offspring, in that hour, That tort'ring hour, no solace can he find. Ev'n they, as with contempt or hatred stung, Seem to adopt Ingratitude's vile plan; And though awake to nought but present wrong, Fly the sad footstep of forsaken Man! THE OLD WORLD. O! what are all the cares of life? Vain transitory, dubious strife; The termagant and brave, (Cares that must soon forbear to teaze,) Must join, in melancholy peace, The world beyond the grave. Mysterious world! could I but guess What habitants thy space posses: Say, are all wise, and good? Or does the noisy coxcomb prate? The blockhead, there too, vex his pate, With folly's idle brood? Does injury there with iron hand The lab'rer's scanty meal command, And gripe the well earn'd fee? Does genius die, unknown, unpay'd— O! is the world in yon dread shade This world's epitome. Does dear seducing woman, ply The syren lips, the roguish eye, And beauty's gilded bait? If things go on in such a way, I ween, 'tis better here to stay; Terra incognita may wait. THE MANIAC. A FRAGMENT. “The frozen north is killing cold, But warm to fortune's frown compared; For love himself is won by gold, Nay life by precious gold ensnared: Then blow, blow, blow, thou felon blast, Till Nature's clay-built mansions are o'ercast, Her babies drown'd! While the grim sisters whirl the wheel so fast, Round, and round, and round, That the threads of mertality snap in the middle, And being's sad riddle, By sages confounded, With time is expounded, Then left for pastime to his offspring death! They tell us being is but breath; Then thus I puff my soul away;— Lo! there! Or, I can chain it in a cobweb wreath, And bid the fickle captive stay. Forbear! Alas! it will not stop, it flies so fast, 'Tis at Heav'n's gaol, ere half a thought is past.” As close by the grated window's twilight pane Darkling I past, with melancholy gaze, Frantic by fits, the maniac reason'd thus, And ever, as he eyed his moving shade, He sigh'd, he started—“Aye, this is my friend, My mild, my melting, false, perfidious friend; See, how he flies me in my evil hour, But courts the sunshine.”—Still he followed close The visionary man, which shifting still, His parley baffled, till at length enraged, With blood-shot eyes, grim smiles, and quiv'ring lip, A rusted key he seized, then smote the wall; “'Tis done,” (he cry'd) and wildly laughed aloud; “And now for justice to my injured self,” He said; and brandishing the massy weight, Deep in his forehead plunged— ANSWER TO AN ANONYMOUS ADDRESS. Of him, whom science once held dear, And fancy seem'd to mark her own, (Reflection, spare the anguish'd tear!) Ah! little, now, is heard or known. Immerst in silent, hopeless woe, To prudence lost, to pleasure cold, Can the mute page my passion show? Can words my bleeding breast unfold? Then, dear invisible, forbear To wake one spark of former pride, Nor the deep wounds of sorrow tear, That feeling would for ever hide! GENIUS PERSONIFIED. By yon lone copse have you not seen, With folded arms and musing mien, The pensive poet stray, What time the west's last, fading fire, Seem'd in soft flashes to expire, And vestal twilight mourn'd the solemn death of day? Did you not mark his varying face, His wayward, wild, disorder'd pace, His loose, uncertain air? The light'nings that illum'd his eye, With angel-forms conversing high, Anon, all sudden sunk in motionless despair? Youth of unsettled soul, ah! stay Thy furious, rash, enthusiast way, Nor seek yon shade forlorn; Nor, on yon tumbling torrent pour, Nor, roam along the desert shore, Till the drear tempest smiles beneath the gleam of morn! Does broken friendship wound thy breast? Or slighted love, severest pest! Or disappointed pride? Ah! me, that breast, divinely meek, Nor love's, nor friendship's bonds could break, And, but thy pastoral reed, thou scorn'st all pomp beside! 'Tis haughty scorn of humbler worth, Disdaining thy inglorious birth, Unconscious of thy mind, That drives thee thus to scenes remote; That checks thy sweetly-warbled note, And in despondence steeps thine energies refin'd: Thus, useless by some savage stream, A ruby sheds its sanguine beam, Nor knows the wond'ring swain; This jewel, in its proper place, The monarch's starry front might grace, Or, brighter than her eyes, the beauty's zone sustain! EDWARD AND ELLEN. A TALE. Loudly roar'd the din of battle, Fiercely raged the rushing foe, And glory flag'd her bloody pinion, O'er many a dauntless heart laid low; When Edward, sought the thickest danger, Rash by love, long-injured, made; Love, that wrought him years of anguish, Love, that wing'd his desp'rate blade. Now, with a fair youth encounter'd, All in soldier's garment drest, Deep he plunged his sword ill-fated, Deep and dreadful in his breast! Slow his languid eyes he lifted, Parting life's last sad farewell, And, mid sobs of death, faint calling “Edward, Edward,” reel'd and fell. “Here I fled a parent's rigor, Constant here my love to find; Cold and cheerless is our meeting, Fate forbid, and I'm resign'd.— “Yet think, oh! think, upon thy Ellen, Nor one tender kiss deny, Since it was thy hand that wounded, Thy fond hand, content I die.” Ghastly pale, he stood all-trembling; Then sinking by his Ellen's side, “Thus, dear angel, thus I follow!” Edward murmur'd, groan'd, and dy'd. THE BLIND BEGGAR'S ADDRESS TO HIS DOG. Speed, grateful partner of my darksome way, Speed to yon stately porch with cautious pace, To me supply the chearful beam of day, And friendship, vainly sought amid my race! No spaniel thou with sleek and fawning art, When fortune wooes, to court the dainty board, But in the rough and anguish'd hour depart, When fortune, too, forsakes thy ruin'd lord: From these fond arms a father's darling fled, Lur'd by a smiling villain's crafty lore; Where hides the wretch belov'd her shameful head, When virgin-truth, when honour is no more? My gallant boy, too resolutely brave, Perchance, ignobly pines in hostile chains; Perchance, far, far from me, a sordid grave He fills:—my faithful dog alone remains. Yet, guiltless he, of pangs that rive this breast, Guiltless, a victim for his country's good, But where shall fair, afflicted sorrow rest, By penury, and pride, and scorn subdu'd? Speed, trusty guide! for in yon dome reside Plenty and peace, devoid of pompous glare; Oh, speed! and while I stroke thy jetty side, With me the sweetest morsel shalt thou share. With ribband gay thy gentle head I'll deck, Or tiny bell, thy weary road to chear, Smooth the dusk beauties of thy shining neck, And clip with harmless skill each velvet ear. With merry bark, when early dawn appears, (No dawn to me,) thou'lt rouse my little shed, And, though too oft my crust be steep'd in tears, Drink from my cup, and from my food be fed. And, when in death are clos'd those watchful eyes, Though scoffing prudence the fond tribute scorn, On thy green tomb a modest wreath shall rise, And gratitude remove the ruder thorn! THE WANDERER. A FRAGMENT. Yon rich domain once own'd Benignus lord, Long by all earthly changes unassail'd; But fell injustice seiz'd his frugal hoard, His cattle perished, and his harvests failed. Forlorn and poor, yet still of steady mind, To foreign climes he bent his cheerless way; One tender babe alone, he left behind, That in the nurse's arms yet lisping lay. Homeward, at last, with feeble steps he came, Full many a year had worn his furrow'd face; A beggar's garb bely'd his nobler frame, For through that garb appear'd a rev'rend grace. And now a stately mansion met his eye; Thither he turned to seek a nightly bed, Where he might heave, unknown, the secret sigh, Where he might haply rest his aching head. His claim was heard: the gates were open'd wide, For Charity herself dwelt porter there; Nor did she help with ostentatious pride, But on each gift bestow'd a friendly tear. The master came to soothe his sorrowing guest, And pledged with sweet humility the bowl; But, oh! what throbbing wonder fill'd his breast, When all his father rush'd upon his soul. Amazed he marked each feature o'er and o'er, Nor could pale age each manly beauty hide, “And do I hold thee (sobb'd he out,) once more, My son! my son!” the happy hermit cry'd. A RHAPSODIC EPISTLE TO A FRIEND. Omnia me tua delectant; sed maximè, maxima cum fides in amicitiâ, consilium, gravitas, constantia, tum lepos, humanitas, literæ. Cicero. Lib. xi. Ep. 27. Though some of your old Greekish fellows Demurely in dry annals tell us, That squire Amphion with a ditty, Sans doute, uprear'd the Theban city; To capering pebbles gave no quarter, And rigadoon'd the lime and mortar; Another, having still'd the motion Of that confounded scold, the ocean, On dolphin's back, rode fairly over Far as from Calais' point to Dover; Bout saddle, certes, he was idle, But the tail serv'd him for a bridle; Then, having got with bumbo merry, Discharg'd with a droll catch his ferry; Nay, Orpheus, (keep us all from evil!) Thus arm'd, went headlong to the devil, And made the damn'd souls, to his fiddle Frisk, like a hen on a hot griddle; Guess, too, the errand for your life?— Why, truly, to redeem—his wife! Few mates, I wot, would so have blunder'd In this blest year of eighteen hundred. Heav'n help the poor rogues that are witty, Those times are past;—the more's the pity! No baker now, say all you can say, Will tick on couplet, verse, or stanza; For Alexandrine smooth, or triplet, No butcher trust a goose's giblet; Nor landlord, (curse the tasteless throng,) Be paid his quit-rent—with a song. Poets, alas! no more have pow'r To build, with tuneful jigs, a tow'r, Save, when sublim'd by slender fare, They conjure castles in the air; Or, partly feeding like wild asses Sunff the keen breezcs of Parnassus; Round the steep hill, like mad curvetting, Quite careless of that thing called—eating; Lean fast that with the Gods doth diet. Milton. “Fat feast that with the dogs doth diet,” Would never let such blades be quiet. For magic lines, still current found, Of sterling weight, and silver sound, That any wight, with ease may scan, Sweet Abr'am Newland is your man; For, damme, I'll maintain it still, There's music in a good bank-bill; And though to rhyme not much confin'd, Music of the most moving kind: Whoever deems this idle fuss, By Jove, “is dark as Erebus;” No fear his pence with mould be rusted, So, hosts! “let no such man be trusted!” And yet, dear part'ner of the pen! Though blockheads jeer us, nine in ten, We to our trade devoutly clinging, Still grace the art,—of ballad-singing; We, when the melting mind's in tune, True, frolic children of the moon, Each ev'ning, from our upper windows, Take a celestial jaunt to Pindus; There romp, and dance, and snatch soft kisses, Charm'd with the nine melodious misses; And then recline the raptur'd head, With each a muse to deck his bed. We from our own prolific brain, Like spiders, spin the lengthen'd strain; And though, perdye, we do not cope With that harmonious urchin, Pope, Congreve facete, or Young sublime, (Those were tall fellows in their time!) Still, though no Virgils, 'faith, or Pindars, We rake not Kotzebue's old cinders, And hawk his rubbish round the land, Proud to be dull—at second-hand. While you the comic fair enjoy, Parent of many a sprightly boy, Whose arch rebuke, and mimic rage, May mend the morals of the stage; Or, in heart-balming laughter steep The languid lid, that wakes to weep, I, by more serious beauties caught, May dress in rhyme the tender thought; (For I have ever cast an eye On ancient, prudish poetry,) To satire's side, indignant, turn, With the grave tragic vestal mourn; Or, (should the pow'rs of mirth allow,) Write doggrel; just as I do now. THE VISION OF ST. PATRICK. A FRAGMENT. The storm was up, for mischief ready, Old Patrick's church, with tempests giddy, Rock'd its tall shatter'd spire unsteady; Each antique pile Regroan'd the blast, when fraught with dread, I Stalk'd the long aisle: Sudden, meanwhile, a mitred shade, In venerable stole array'd, Broke on my musing eye dismay'd From that lone tomb Where Swift, Ierne's boast, is laid Deep clad in gloom. “Ah me!” the awful semblance sigh'd, “Thus lies my son, my country's guide, Where Night and dim Oblivion hide His moulder'd grave, While trophies deck each corse of pride, Each worthless slave. “No filial tear by Wisdom shed, Streams fondly o'er his marble bed; No bosom mourns the patriot dead; No scutcheons grace The man, who Shame's broad colours spread On Folly's face. “Unhappy clime, thrice blest in vain, What hand shall wake the lofty strain? Who, burst from thy inglorious train, By genius fir'd, That view'st unmov'd the minstrel's fane, Dull, uninspir'd. “Long, lovely exile, hath the pow'r Whose sweet chord lent the raptur'd hour, Left that mean coast where knaves devour The meed of merit, Where Want hails down its freezing shower On struggling spirit! “Where Worth's small gem unhceded gleams Mid tasteless Grandeur's gorgeous beams, Where scant the rill of Bounty streams, To nurse those blooms That frame the wreath which richly teems With true perfumes. “Nor Fame shall mark thy little shore, Nor pleas'd Posterity explore Thy curious haunts for native lore, While sad, and low, The Bard resigns his tuneful store To listless Woe.” THE DAYS OF YORE. In knightly hall, or lady's bow'r, Erewhile the vocal lyre was strung; And many a laurel, many a flow'r, Round the sweet Minstrel's harp was hung: Graceful array'd in flowing stole Of green, with tissued roses wove, His ardor warm'd th' heroic soul, His softness sooth'd disastrous love: Mid Harmony's responsive hoard, His cunning fingers featly caught Each sound, that rapture might afford, Or lift sublime the tow'ring thought. Yet oft to shun the garish beam, Mid the deep desert would he stray; And following quick some haunted stream, Oft wander from the world away: Stretch'd, listless, on the headlong steep, Oft would he gaze the scene below; The painted cloud, the toiling deep, The purple heath with golden glow! And oft, in silent transport laid, 'Till the shrill curfew struck his ear, Has Twilight don'd her checquer'd shade, And Darkness veil'd him musing there. But yet no fear, mid wild forlorn, The bard should seek a savage bed; Some hermit, at his glad return, The pillow bless'd that lap'd his head. Of hateful penury no fear, The poet still a welcome found: The peasant press'd his homely cheer, And magic song the banquet crown'd. Gay as the little birds, that fly All devious through the tangled wood, To whom boon Nature's stores supply Their vernal couch, their simple food. Ah me! those happy days are past, And alter'd sore his heavy fate; By each rude vassal's scoff disgrac'd, And banish'd from the lordly gate. Yet nought of Heav'n illumes that heart That deals its tuneful servant wrong, Nor aught of bliss can wealth impart To him, who slights the honey'd song. For, sure, of Heav'n that purer flame, That hath his polish'd mind possess'd; And sure from source celestial came The sunshine that pervades his breast. Then, nobles deign, and barons bold, To rear the glory of your land; And when true genius you behold, Confess th' Almighty Master's hand. Nor dazzling gem on Beauty's brow, Nor titled Grandeur's garter'd shine, Can aught so passing bright bestow, Oh, Genius, as thy splendid line! TO COMIC ROMANCE. This was an original attempt at a new eccentric species of poetry, and may be styled the irregular comic ode. O! quaint-ey'd nymph, of buxom port, Where dost thou hold thy jovial court? Where tread the gay Romance's wizard round? Now Sympathy, with blubber'd face, And zoneless breast, usurps thy place, And sighs, and throbs, and moans, o'ercome thy merry sound. In drawling lethargy of woe, Solemn, serene, and sad, and slow, The novel Muse her fire-drawn rapture deals, Meanwhile he cherry ribbon'd maid, Of lewd town rakes but half afraid, Beats her tumultuous bosom, pants, and feels. It was not so thou sweetest lass, When from thy rosy dimpling glass The ancient sons of Humour quaff'd, And wrote, and shook their sides, and laugh'd. When Mancha's puissant errant Cervantes. urg'd His famous steed, with heel of armour scourg'd; And dapper Sancho, curious wight, With fulminating proverbs burst, How didst thou bless Dulcinea's tender name, From whence his knightly ardour came, And titled him of all thy sons the first. As through the laureate arch he rode, Grim issuing to th' ideal castle, And many a death-denouncing fight; In that blest moment you forgot all past ill, And smil'd, exulting, on the comic wrestle. Nor did the Gallic wit Le Sage. thy influence want, Who him of Santillane recorded; Nor to choice Scarron Author of the comic romance. wert thou scant Of laughing merchandize, so lately hoarded. But oh, when civil dudgeon first grew high, And folks fell out they knew not why, Then did thy knight Hudibras, by Butler. abandon dwelling, And sally forth a colonelling; While politics (who now refuses), Trudg'd cheek by jole with the nine muses; And the new light shone most serenely, On Ralpho's garb, dress'd neat and cleanly. Ill-fated bard of whim and frolic, Sore troubled oft with pursy colic, Inhaler mild of ale Pierian, Of quack Apol droll pickle-hcrring; Thou shalt delight all future ages, Though forced to dine on Hudibrastic pages. Next the gymnastic Parson Parson Adams, chief character in the romance of Joseph Andrews, by Fielding. caught the smile, In cassock'd wisdom, but resistless mirth; Created to inform, and glad the earth, And half allay the pastor's gloomy toil. But soon the sun of Laughter Tom Jones, by the same. rose; Burst through a cloudy host of foes, And rainbow wreaths of varying hues combin'd; With sweet instruction sooth'd the aching mind; Brisk sprightly warmth, a nymph divine, Flam'd in the radiance of each artless line. Amelia's A novel, by Fielding. harrowing tale lay yet untold, Ripe in design, and in pure judgment bold: Domestic love there breathes his tender soul, And anxious nature trembles o'er the whole. In thy bright sky another planet Smollet. shone, With joy-imparting vigour, all his own; The scenes of life his ready hand Bade in sweet succession stand, And left their checquer'd chances to the eye: Satire stood blinking nigh, And while he strove to mend the loaded crew, Dash'd with malignant gall the liveliet hue. His fabling fancy too, fantastic arm'd Stout Chivalry's See his Launcelot Greaves, a most admirable comic performance. The following lines allude to incidents in the romance, which the reader will not regret to be referred to. enthusiast, grizzly chief! Erst wont to urge the plough, with porter warm'd, Or deal with falchion dread deep gash to bleeding beef. How alter'd soon; in steel 'ycased, With mettlesome trot he paced The sober charger, while behind His gallant 'squire the luncheon'd bag assaulted; And tilting tournaments of wind, O'er some unlucky oak's o'erhanging branches vaulted. The maniac marine their well-earn'd honours saw, Right envious of the murd'rous field; And buckling helm around his sturdy jaw, Couch'd his elastic pole, and rung his brazen shield. Another Quixote The Spiritual Quixote. join'd the madding row, Lad of th' uplifted eye, and willing spirit; Replete with methodistic merit, He soft commands the saintly bosom glow; Fresh from the rustic bench, behold he mounts The pulpit-thrones of Whitefield's, Wesley's, courts, And midst his strugglings dire, thou Goddess, spy, O'erflowing sanctity illume his eye! Again resum'd the hobbling rhime, Thou rose o'er Envy and old Time, And breath'd, with loose poetic pride, Thy influence o'er the pleasing guide. Alluding to Anstey's Bath Guide, which, though in the form of an epistolary poem, may be reckoned a romance, as a small plot runs through the whole. Grey-tressed Age shook hands with rose-cheek'd Mirth, And antic Humour, on the smoaky hearth, Pourtray'd the courtly tricks of dance and ball; Meanwhile the cottage seem'd a new Vauxhall. The dormant feelings too 'gan weave Their choicest web in Goldsmith's simple tale; What time he sought with nat'ral hand to save The Vicar mild from Wakefield's silent vale; The pensive Pleasures on the hist'ry hung, And smil'd betimes, and wept, as Auburn's minstre, sung. O! form'd in ev'ry dress to charm, Thou, gentle tyrant of the breast, Couldst with resistles indignation warm Or sink the soul in fancy'd woe deprest: Nature's own hand shall deck thy humble tomb, And bid her dewy wild-flow'rs weep around; Pity's own pencil milden the dread gloom, And harmless Jest frequent the darling ground. But thou art fled; despis'd, and scorn'd, With every winning grace adorn'd: No more thou deign'st t' inspire the Bard, His heart-felt balm, his bright reward, Oh! frolic tut'ress, gay coquette, The pedant bookworm's mouldy crust forget, The prude Philosophy disdain, And o'er my favour'd bosom reign; Weave wild the probable design, Harsh stricture rude to wit refine, And bright'ning into smiles of day, The night of Dulness chase away. ABBEY EFFUSIONS. ON SEEING MASON'S MONUMENT. While mid this solemn dome's sequester'd shade, By venerable virtues sacred made, With softer awe I mark, and gentler tread, One modest modern join the mighty dead. Drayton's cold cheek a pallid blush betrays, And learned Jonson trembles for the bays! Nor may the marble, deck'd by Mason's name, Less fervent pray'r, or meaner homage claim; Though round the tuneful sons of Britain rise, Where, laurel-wreath'd, his recent model lies. Yet, once more, oh! ye Bards, on Mona's steep, Who nightly your mysterious meetings keep, And wailing o'er the corse of warrior brave, Moan to the murmur of the troublous wave; Once more, with your wild warmth and native fire, Smite the deep sorrows of the sounding lyre; While, in the yelling tempest heard afar, Caractacus impels his scythed car; And issuing dreadful from their shadowy shroud, His fleeting coursers paw the dusky cloud. The Minstrel, erst, who wheel'd his brave career “Beyond the visible, diurnal sphere,” Swift as loose stars their golden orbits leave, Or meteors glide along a summer-eve, In quest of flow'rs that strew th' empyrean way, Advent'rous bent, I see;—immortal Gray! Pure o'er thy bust his lambent glories play. Lo! modest Whitehead too, to Friendship warm, (E'en yet her flame illumes his phantom form,) On thee still fix'd his meek, but ardent eye, The brother-seraph bends, and wooes thee to the sky. Oh, lov'd! oh, lost! whose polish'd page no stain Of flatt'ry knew, or ruder wit profane, Which rigid Piety might wish effac'd: Soft, yet sublime, luxuriant, yet chaste, Long may the British youth, whose skill would raise Perfection, worthy of succeeding days, Here led; (his eyes suffus'd with generous dew,) The honours of departed worth to view, Awfully touch'd, breathe forth the sigh sincere, Admire the poet, and his art revere! ON GARRICK'S TOMB AND INSCRIPTION. Mean is the verse, illustrious actor, paid By his weak hand to thy indignant shade, Who, poorly gifted with enthusiast glow, Bade these slight numbers o'er the marble flow; Superior thought should stamp the sacred stone, Diffus'd by genius powerful as thy own. Can Painting's most illumin'd tint supply Th' electric flashes of thy meaning eye? Can softest strains the Muse enamour'd sung, Vie with the honey'd cadence of thy tongue? O! could those adamantine fetters brcak, And thy Pigmalion-semblance warm, and speak; Could the fir'd image quit its cumbrous load, How would'st thou act, and look, and move—a god! Smil'st thou not, mighty master of the heart, At those vile mimics who disgrace thy art? Who, form'd on Imitation's menial plan, Forego the natural privilege of man? Thy start, thy frown, thy accent who essay, To-morrow, still, the copy of to-day: And does not Shakspeare's angry sprite agree, Those scenic puppets murder Him—in Thee? A BALLAD. In tenui, tenuis non gloria. Virg. 'Twas early in the morning, and passing sweet to view, The glist'ning Sun had kiss'd off cold April's falling dew, I heard a lonely virgin, all by a river side, Lamen thus sore her lost love, who in the battle dy'd; She wrung her hands more white than snow, she tore her yellow hair, And though in sorrow sunk, alas! methought look'd wond'rous fair; For ever as the trembling tear stood bursting in her eye, Her pretty bosom swell'd to sight, and gave a piteous sigh. “Why would'st thou go, my own love, the cruel wars to brave, Was not this bosom softer than Ocean's troubled wave? Oh! did you on the damp ground enjoy such swect repose, Or could those smiles that conquer'd me appease your deadly foes? When round your comely temples, where curling tresses grew, The bloody faulchions glitter'd, the whisling bullets flew, Could you no pitying angel, o'erhead, to save you see, And when I thought of you, love, did you still think of me?” The green sod where we lay, love, I've cover'd o'er with flow'rs, And there I've press'd the cold earth for many silent hours; A willow-plant I planted, which you would joy to see, But the flow'rs are all long wither'd, though the willow grows for me! Ungrateful flow'rs they were, for morn, and ev'ning here, I gently op'd their little leaves, and water'd with a tear; And though the drooping willow-slip had least of all my care, Behold you how it springs up, as fast as my despair!” “My father is a hard one, his heart is made of stone, My mother too is hard, and my sisters mock my moan; They talk to me of sweethearts, of gold, and jest, and glee, They little think my poor heart is in the grave with thee! But they nor all the world, my thoughts of thee shall know, And in this nook I'll hide up the treasure of my woe, Till grief and sorrow tir'd out, I'll steal off, bye and bye, And here upon the green sod, I'll lay me down and die!” VERSES, Addressed to the Children of my Friend. Infant buds of early beauty! Sport suspend, to hear my strain; Let a poet tell your duty, Though his verse, perhaps, be vain. To his sad experience listen, Little as you are, attend, Let your eyes with pleasure glisten, Trust the poet in the friend. First to Him, o'er each soft feature Who that rosy bloom has spread, Breathe the pray'r of artless Nature, By his gracious spirit led; He shall angels send to charm you, Angels than yourselves less fair, They with turtle fondness warm you, Shield you with celestial care: Female sweetness, kind discretion, In your mother's smile discern; Holy Friendship's high expression, Honour,—from your father learn. Be of false flow'ry pleasures fearful, Where vulgar children heedless stray, Not like the show'ry April, tearful, Nor sullen, like the Winter's day. Never for foolish gewgaws squabble, Let them not mar your rip'ning joys, Though older heads, a pompous rabble! Alas! too often fight for toys. Soon, soon, will fly those sportive graces, Ah! soon your guiltless pranks be o'er; Sorrow will cloud those pretty faces Where sorrow never sat before. Quickly Time's rapid wing will cover Your tiny span with envious shade; Bess will be sighing for a lover, And Fred pursue some scornful maid: Then passions ficrce, with wild dominion, Torment you on life's tragic stage, Then will you miss the parent-pinion Shelt'ring now your tender age. Then, whatsoever chance betide you, Whether fell Grief your bosom wrings, Or Peace through bli ful regions guide you, You'll own the truth your poet sings. PRINCE SERAPIN, OR THE ENCHANTED HIND. The days are past, when o'er each haunted room The good priest sprinkled drops of holy dew; Scared the fell night hag from her with'ring gloom, And drest with sacred sprays each decent pew. No lonely goblin roams by blasted yew, Or blue-rob'd fiend confin'd by cruel doom; The age of spirits is departed long; None strew with rosemary the virgin-tomb; No shrill chains clank the cloister'd cells among, Yet feel their force awhile, and listen to my song. In faery-lond did dwell a valiant prince; Majestic manly beauty cloath'd his face, And oft he glow'd with battle's warmth intense; Of chivalry, the honour, and the grace; But still maintain'd his country in sweet peace: Wisdom was his, and pow'r, and wit, and sense. Yet all the little tyrant boy o'erthrew; A damsel fair had cast a vapour dense O'er his dim eyes, and often did he rue The pleasing pain, I wot, but she was lovely-true. Her wavy tresses shone like floating gold; Her eyes eclipsed the lightning of the mine; Her cheeks Love's own ambrosial bloom did hold; Her bosom breath'd an incense full divine; Her tender bosom, raptures every shrine, None could, without cntranced thoughts, behold; Her front was mildness, dignity her gait; Her garment fell in many an easy fold; Pure chaplets deck'd her hair, all rifled late; Ah! that this beauteous dear should find the wrath of fate. Long had they woo'd with amorous interchange, And studied all the movements of the heart; At last (what sure will seem to moderns strange) Each felt the influence of the golden dart, And the bland ecstacy of soft revenge; Each did to each the pensive heat impart, And spread the sweet contagion to the breast; Soon shall they clasp, with dear delicious art; Soon shall they nectars taste supremely blest, And tread the carpet-ground in snowy vestment drest. Hark! hark! the merry minstrel-tribe proclaim, The lofty song, in garb (like Summer's) clad; Some join the rattling joust, the tilting game; Some the quick morrice-dance, for none are sad, But bidding farewell care, like wights stark mad. Next, blowing from their nostrils living flame, Richly caparison'd the chargers came; Prauncing right prond, the costly crescents gleam Around their rainbow-necks!—no sound is dumb, All rattling; tabor, flute, fife, trumpet, cymbal, drum. And now the hoary man of God has ty'd The gordian knot (oh prodigy of hate)! The princess seem'd a fair hind by his side;— Then leap'd, with wond'rous vault, the minster-gate. Long did Serapin mourn his way ward fate; Till, bent with eld, a witching beldame cry'd, “Sir knight, thy dame is chang'd by spiteful fay, “A victim to the elfin's rival pride; “Nathless, go hunt, without stop or stay, “And kill your best belov'd on your auspicious way.” With speed he went, and wound the bugle loud, Making faint Echo burst her chrystal cell; Out leap'd a fair hind from the dappled crowd; Out leap'd a fair hind, and he knew her well: Full quick he shot (his jav'lin did excel,) And stretch'd her panting by the greenwood shroud: Then o'er her pour'd the witch three potent charms; Incontinent, she felt this life's alarms, And leap'd, perfection all, to glad Serapin's arms. THE COFFEE-HOUSE. Nymph of the sleepy weed, thy poet aid; O! bid him, à-la-Turk! thy favour find; Wrap his drear head with dullness' genuine shade, His soul in chains indi oluble bind; Let thick tobacco clothe his vap'ry mind With tenfold smoke, from tubes triumphant play'd: So shall he rise the Mahomet of rhyme, Shew all thy shrine, in majesty display'd; Bid cut and dry the ceiling scale sublime, And shatter'd cups well-fraught, in loud harmonious chime. Like Alghiere borne on Virgil's back, Porterly load! I pierce the house of smoke; Facetious jokes around me hov'ring crack, And tables groan with many a brilliant stroke. There stalks the comic in a tarnish'd frock, While tragedy in boots with stern attack, Bids the loud waiter like a lion roar. Sage politics, there seeks his nightly snack; Philosophy, the wall with saws scrapes o'er, And geometry sublime, uproots the oaken floor. Lo! yon pale wight of haggard semblance dire, That on the brown-crush'd paper vents his rage, An essayist he, who claims a muse of fire, Author I wot, full meet, for such a page; See, when the party-wits in talk engage, How stern he rolls his eye-balls, fraught with ire; Shrugg'd shoulders testify his fell dismay, And goosequill waved in many a frantic gyse: Anon, with hasty strides he starts away, To damning pamphlet, poem, farce, wild pantomime, and play. Lo! careful miser counting o'er his purse, Sprinkling light guineas with the heavier coin; He mumbleth ev'ry reck'ning with a curse, And for a farthing prays to pow'rs divine; Ne had he Ormus, or Golconda-mine, Would he be satisfy'd, still carking worse; Eftsoons, he teemeth with a baser plot, Candle to steal, perdye, unto his nurse; Poor nurse! who seldom boileth chearful pot, But from the neighb'ring shop conveyeth pottage hot. The newspapers appear; what busy hum? Is France yet conquer'd, are the Russians beat? How many gone to goal, or kingdom come? What is the price of India stock, and meat? Which of the aldermen gave last grand treat? Did Lady Padewsoy neglect her drum? Or Lady Lapdog's bitch in panic die? Are courtiers honest, ministers struck dumb? What maids of honour loud for husbands cry? Who dived the deepest sea, or soar'd the loftiest sky? Thus in rough parley do they waste the night, Ambitious of most noise, and least pretence. Critique, o'erpow'rs miss Muse with horrid might, And Ignorance with saddle presseth Sense: The present combats with the future tense; Grammar himself, shrewd rogue, prepares for flight: From slightest hints here duels dire commence; A cough, a wink, provokes the bloody fight; So rash those heedless men, who ne'er are in the right. ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF HENRY FLOOD, ESQ. On a steep rock above the dashing wave, While shrieking sea-winds broke the sullen fall, Ierne wept her Flood's untimely grave; Too early claim'd by death's resistless call. Dim-floating clouds enwreath'd the silent shore, For black-pall'd night her sombre scenery drew; Low caverns echo'd to the watery roar, And eve departing cast a pallid blue: When tranc'd in woe, the melancholy maid, Struck with sad hand the harp's symphonious string; Soft sunk each measure through the midnight shade, That waked the druid-sage, and spectre-king. Beneath the moon's wan ray the heroes rose; Heroes of yore, that propp'd Juverna's state: Anxious they heard maternal Virtue's woes, Despairing, wept their brother's final fate. In still low whispers thus they breath'd around, While choral warblings fill'd the pregnant air; “Long shall thy bust with civic bay be crown'd, “Long shall thy worth, thy goodness flourish fair. “Oft, while retired, the sons of Alma tune The grateful reed, each echo's timid tongue Shall learn thy name, and oft th' enshrined moon Shall stoop to hear, her silvery host among. “Yes, thou couldst warm the breast with Spartan fire, Or soothe to peace the wild relentless crowd; The seeds of sov'reign liberty inspire, And dare to tell thy country's wrongs aloud. “Say, what brave meed the patriot's frontshall twine? What gorgeous tribute mark each signal deed? For him the Muse shall raise the lay divine; For him the public bosom deeply bleed. “The storied arch, the monumental vaunt, And all the trifles of ingenious art, Are poor—the real grief should plant Its feeling basis in a people's heart.” ON A DEAD NEGRO. At length the tyrant stays his iron rod, At length the iron rod can hurt no more; The slave soft slumbers 'neath this verdant sod, And all his years of misery are o'er. Perchance, his soul was framed of finest mould, His heart to goodness feelingly aspir'd; Perchance, strong sense his every word controul'd, And glow'd his breast with heat seraphic fir'd. Perchance his deeds bely'd his sable hue, And every sentiment deserv'd a throne: But labour hid him from the general view, And fell oppression mark'd him for her own. O'er his low grave no tender parents weep, Nor widow wails his loss, by all forgot; No friends sincere their holy vigils keep, Nor infant fingers deck the mournful spot. Yet, far more honour'd his unsculptur'd tomb, More sacred far than all the vaulted great; Unwonted brightness clears his parting gloom, And Heav'n approving smiles upon his state. Nor thou with supercilious look deride This votive strain, or his rough state despise; How vain thy vaunting, impotent thy pride! Behold him, thy superior in the skies. Though learning fled his rude untutor'd mind, And all the superfluities of art; Though to his form the graces ne'er inclined, His were the beauties of the head and heart. Full oft the primrose courts the hawthorn shade, And spreads her fragrance on the mean resort; Full oft the cot receives the peasant's head, Whose wond'rous merits had adorn'd a court. Pass but some æras with a rapid flight, Where then the splendours of this terrine ball? Sunk in the bosom of oblivion's night; And death, the ancient chronicler of all. THE SAXON BANQUET. Grasp the sword, the goblet fill, Pledge the honey'd bev'rage round: Fear not, chiefs, your blood to spill, Hydromel will heal the wound. Hark! the war-fiend's brazen wings, Rustle in the frighted air; Hark! the grim-cy'd sisters sing, And weave the bloody web of care. Loud echoing through the fretted hall, Sighs, and moans, and groans combine; Next moment something will befall, This moment, festal mirth is thine. 'Tis come—prepare the steel rib'd vest; Gird the side, defend the breast; Hissing arrows cut the sky; Targets meet, and falchions rattle, Oden! this is thy own battle, Conquest sparkles in thine eye. Swift sweep the scythed cars, whole legions fall, Death spreads his shadowy pall; 'Tis ours to slaughter, theirs to die; 'Tis ours to slaughter, shrouded brethren cry. Green-stoled minstrels! earth's best treasure, Exalt, prolong, the lofty measure, And o'er each corse, with holy fingers, steal Heroic poesy's pure-purpled veil; Green-stoled minstrels! earth's best treasure, To death give peace, to life give pleasure; Time will come, and Hela, grisly guest! Then too, our lonely ghosts shall claim the song of rest. Thus, Rodorick, at the plenteous board Divinely sung, a warrior-bard; Grim valour own'd the tuneful lord, And the replenish'd scull, still smil'd his bright reward. THE WINTER'S NIGHT. The surly demons of the tempest yell, The frozen ground rings sullen on the car; Night breathes her cold sighs o'er the shiv'ring dell, And shected Horror leagues with wan-cheek'd Fear. No more Spring's smiling babes', the roses, rear. Their blushing heads, but bid a long farewell; No more the balmy eye-lids of the Morn Awake green-crested Summer from her cell; With crystal spangles doth she now adorn Her bosom pale, and chill, and weeps her withering thorn. Terrific darkness clothes the baleful heath, While Dread's black legions lift her awful veil; Gigantic Terror calls the fiends of Death, And bids the elves their dismal scenes reveal To the tranc'd trav'ller's eye, whose heart-strings feel The horrid shock, and blasted, tear asunder; The forked lightnings round his forehead dance, Grim howls the flame-rob'd Pow'r that sways the thunder; He sinks, he dies!—the torturing cries advance, Ne'er shall his children catch their father's sprightly glance. Ah me! what now avails the shudd'ring wretch Who hugs her orphan infant to her breast, Beneath some ruin'd castle's yawning breach! Hark! the winds whistle o'er the hapless guest; The shatter'd walls rock, tottering!—sprites unblest, O! spare the meek-ey'd mourner!—Angels catch The falling rocks! arrest the sudden death! Celestial Comfort's soft elixir fetch: Lo, now! even now, she pours her last sad breath, The frighted darling clings, and gasps, and falls beneath! Fell Winter, tyrant of the blooming year, Nature's harsh stepsire! Mirth's Cimmerian foe, Fly with thy ruffian-blasts to cavern drear, Nor mar the lovely woodland's vernal flow; Thou, and thy ravens, shriek the dirge of woe In Lapland's haggard waste; the rude rocks tear And hurl huge fragments to the stagnant wave From some blank hill where witching beldames stare: But oh! Europa's flow'ry natives spare! Zephyr alone his radiant wing shall wave, And melting thaws serene unbind their icy grave. ORIGINAL ELEGY ON A COUNTRY ALEHOUSE. Dim burns the taper with a twinkling flame, The sooty coal forsakes the narrow grate, Frail glasses broke a broken purse proclaim, And vacant jugs the landlord's bill relate. Here let me, then, thy ruin'd state bewail, Fair alehouse, fairest of the busy green; With tears bemoan thy abdicated ale, With sighs survey thy cellar's solemn scene. Here oft, immers'd in politics profound, The social curate smoak'd his ev'ning pipe; Here too the clerk his mantling goblet crown'd, And press'd the blushful glass in beauty ripe. Oft did yon bell (a bell no more!) with joy Bound to the smith's reverberating hand; Oft did the woodman yon crack'd screw employ, And bottled nectars bounce at his command. Ah! here, the purring, solitary cat, Musing, the hearth with em'rald eye reviews; In grand Parnassian pomp the poet sat, And quaff'd substantial bumpers to his Muse. Here has he stood, meanwhile his slumb'ring crew, Stretoh'd o'er the floor, in awful silence lay; (Sad proof how well thy former host could brew!) And wept them hurried from the light of day. Full many an epitaph, with cunning lore, Frolic he mutter'd o'er each victim's head; To calm his sorrows, claim'd one tankard more, And made the young sun light him to his bed. No more the quaint-ey'd catch, the teeming jest, The loud-continued laugh, the ready wit, Shall swell with fond applause the simple breast, The shrinking clown with poignant sting shall hit. Farewell tobacco, mellowing ale farewell! To higher themes the ardent bosom clings; Yet let this verse thy alehouse-honours tell, And bid thy landlord shine, enroll'd with kings. HYMN TO SOLITUDE. Oh! nymph sedately sweet, whose solemn smile, What time the day-star sunk to golden rest, So often would my hermit-step beguile To scenes by Fancy's magic finger drest. Whether in fond, luxurious leisure laid, 'Mid the dim covert of some woody waste, Whose wild uncertainty of waving shade, Scarce one coy sunbeam, tremblingly, embrac'd; Or, musing on each pearly drop that fell, Half pendulous, from some lone Naïad's urn; Whose waters from the rock would slowly well, And in their ling'ring lapse melodious mourn. What vision'd raptures would my breast embay In silent bliss, abstractedly refin'd, 'Till in some artless, but energic lay, Spontaneous burst the free, poetic mind? Say, shall I ever tread the sacred sod, Again divinely fir'd with song sublime? Where, erst, th' enthusiast form of Collins trod, And the rapt Passions listen'd to his rhyme? Oh! woods and wilds, once vocal to his verse, Within whose haunts ev'n now, at ev'ning hour, The green-hair'd sisterhood their dirge rehearse, And round his low tomb nurse the fading flow'r; Shall I not wander through each dusk retreat, Each dcep-drawn alley, hung with ivy pale, And mark the tiny print of fairy feet, And hear soft murmurs die along the vale? Yes, modest maids, who hat'st the painful glare Of splendid Folly, and unmeaning Pride, Still shall we breathe the aromatic air, That wantons o'er the mountain's flow'ry side: Still to thy serious ear my song shall flow, My song enamour'd of the rural theme, Where no rough blasts of loud Ambition blow, To chase th' illusion of Hope's noontide dream. A MONODY ON CHATTERTON. Daughters of Heav'n! blest sisters of sweet Song, Who nurse the seedlings that prolific rise From Poesy's illustrious birth, Firing some favour'd son of Earth, And lending to his breast a portion of the skies; O! hither move along In pensive pace, And with majestic grace Lead bright Imagination's seraph-throng, O'er the rude stones, that frown uncouth— In yon deep dell's oblivious gloom, Sadly sleeps a once-lov'd youth: Ye wood-flow'rs breathe your wild perfume; Ye shrouded warblers harmonize the gale; Here, Autumn, fling thy brilliant bloom, And fence from wayward winds the sacred vale: Tread soft,—ye infants of the air, While in the mazy dance you turn; Tread soft, and pause to mourn, Mingling your mystic sports with sickly care, For Genius slumbers here! True Genius, prompt to mount the sphere Of Fancy, thrid pure rapture's maze, And view her with unshrinking gaze; Prompt to veil in antique dress What antientry could ne'er express; Catch the buskin's lofty mien, Or woo the laughter-loving queen. Immortal boy! thee angels fed With Poesy's abstracted food; Thy bowl was fill'd from Fancy's fountain-head, Thy bowl with wond'rous ecstacies imbued: By Heav'n's own chymic skill refin'd, Thine was the manner of the mind. Yet Man, ingrate, thy labours view'd, Unknown from Dullness' motley brood! O next to Him, whose master-hand Could thrill the pang'd nerve of the heart, Bid the quick tear of pity start, Or Terror shudd'ring own the dread command. Hated reverse to all divine, See the matchless minstrel pine, See the blooming wonder die, Indignant death in his distracted eye! What curses future æras, yet unborn, Shall lavish on the wretch's head, Who saw the tears fond Nature's darling shed, Yet in his bosom struck an aggravating thorn! Barbarian Britain!—Could the choicest gem Of Merit's radiant diadem, Sink in thy gloom, and waste its glorious glow! Averse to bid neglected Genius live, Say, shalt thou share the fame a Chatterton can give? Had he but gain'd his manhood's mighty prime, Bright as the sun, and as the sun sublime; His soaring soul had borne the awful wand Of magic power, and o'er the fairy land Of Fancy, shed a new poetic race, Lending creation to his favour'd place. But ah! the dying sounds decay, Ah! they fade away, Melting, melting, melting, Melting from the ear of day: Despair assumes the Muse's lyre, Damps each softly-sinking fire, Presses the fiery spirit down below, And tells his stubborn soul the bitter tale of woe! At last: superior to her chain, He flies o'er Madness' wild domain; Despis'd and dejected, he faints and he sighs! Too rigorous Heaven!—how ghastly his eyes! Thus I triumph o'er all!—lo! a Chatterton dies! Spare, oh! spare, Almighty Pow'r! His frenzy'd passion, and his last black hour; Spare his mortal portion! spare; Think upon his case distrest, And of his soul's fine essence grant a share To some pure breast! Long did he brave Unkindness' gorgon eye; Fell Famine's meagre lip, and Scorn's polluted breath! He look'd to find a friend, he found no friend but Death! He never look'd on high, Or Thou hadst been his friend; Despair had turn'd his sight below, Despair had fix'd his home of woe, Rashly rebellious fell the fatal blow! God of Mercy! spare his end! Perchance (to mortal audience still unknown) In agony's keen, parting groan, No brother near to wrest his hand, No sire to catch his last command, No mother's mournful care to dress his bier, No sister's tender, tender tear: In Hope's ethereal light he saw Thee shine, And father, mother, brother, sister, all combine— In the full pity of thy op'ning heav'n, His foibles and his faults forgiv'n! Sweetest child of Poesy, May this meet thy soul on high, Cheer thy memory of this world, And shew thy flag of future fame unfurl'd. DEEDS OF DEATH. What art thou, with ebon hair Hanging on thy shoulders bare? Now the hamlet's still as death, Moping o'er the desert heath! Wild and wan thy haggard face, Which by moon-light I can trace: Fiery red thy ferret eye Doth deep in hollow socket lie; And thy fingers lank and lean, Spotted o'er with blood obscene, Look as though a wound they gave, Or had dug a new-made grave! You move your skinny lips severe, Yet no murmur'd sound I hear; Ha! beneath thy sable pall I hear a babe for mercy call; Fainter now its feeble shrick; How you writhe its little neck; How you suck its flowing gore— Lo! its bosom throbs no more. Who are these behind that throng, Dragging a pale corse along? How their murd'rous eyeballs gleam O'er his deep wound's sanguine stream: Now on me their leaden stare Is levell'd with malignant glare; Wrapt in Horror's central gloom Heavy on my heart they come, Yet with pausing step they steal— In pity, Fancy, drop the veil. THE BOWER OF WOODSTOCK. How fall'n the shades that once luxuriant rose, Where ling'ring Transport wav'd his purple wing; Untuneful now the shallow riv'let flows, And o'er the fairy wild rude ravens sing. Where the long labyrinth meand'ring deep, Beguil'd the easy step to yonder grove, Once, Beauty wont her vigils fond to keep, And watch the hour when Henry came and love. Ye sad deserted trees, whose holy boughs Sigh'd at her mournful fate, extend your arms, With vernal arch her little tomb inclose, And guard the fair Perfection's sacred charms. Here Pity's self breathes soft the tender moan Through aspen grots, shrill quiv'ring to the gale; Extinguish'd ardor marks each conscious stone, And turtles tell their fair one's tragic tale. Ev'n now, through yonder gloom, the furious queen, Seems harsh to menace the faint-gleaming sword, Pale Jealousy thrills quick through ev'ry vein, She stabs her husband through his best ador'd. Let Melancholy feed her dreary breast With pensive thoughts, and melt the streaming eye, While Rosamond, in saintly radiance drest, Reviews her faded Woodstock with a sigh. EPISTLE FROM MAJOR ANDRE TO ELEONORA. Written the night before his Execution. From scenes where savage murder stalks around, And sighs of sorrow break through every sound; Where innocence in vain for pardon pleads, And Virtue, doom'd by tyrants, soonest bleeds; Dear long-lost love! thy André greets once more Thy tender bosom, and his native shore; His native shore, where soft-eyed Pity stays, And Mercy lends the crown her brightest rays. Condemn'd, forlorn—ah! let me spare thy breast, Condemn'd, when hope delusive called me blest; Condemn'd, when love prevail'd in all thy charms, Condemn'd, to feel no more thy rapt'rous arms; No more to revel in thy soft'ning eye; Mo more to tell my anguish, till I die. Is this a bridal-night—yon fury-face But ill-adorns the nuptial's hallow'd place! Yon scaffold is my couch! yet all were sweet, Could I once more thy dear embraces meet; Sigh all my soul upon thy breast away, And all my former vows in solemn ardour say: Yet that's denied! inhuman fiends, again Let André banquet on the charming pain, The dreadful luxury of parting love, 'Tween life and death, in one calm moment prove; Count all the minutes with ecstatic haste, And sigh no more when the last minute's past. Yet what is life? a puny pageant all, Nor would I grudge, ye cruel heav'ns, to fall; But ah! yon phantom of my promised bliss Becks to her arms, and lingers on my peace; Lo! her poor bosom pants with fiercest woes! Her radiant tress in frantic frenzy flows; Her eyes brimfull, their precious torrents spend, Yes, I will fly, and bid thy mourning end: Waft in one kiss my ardent soul to thine, And then expire in ecstacy divine. Fond, foolish struggle, can thy shrivell'd hand Force the strong steel, the ruthless watch withstand? Can thy weak nerves that tremble o'er this page, O'ercome the despot's dire infernal rage? O! could the frame invisibly decay, And like the spirit urge its pathless way; Soon would I gain Britannia's happy strand, And bind my heart to her's with Rapture's roseate band. —The tyrant comes—sad lines my sorrows tell, And she will bless this hand that writes a long fare-well. THE PROGRESS OF FANCY. A VISION. Arise! my Muse! and break the bands of sleep, Now when the dawn with orient smile attends The dewy tracks of morn, and the bright sun Yokes his æthereal coursers to the car That whirls aloft the potency of fire, As yet unken'd, save, by effulgence dim, That gilds with purple blush the glitt'ring kiss Of Blomius! hill beloved, where oft the muse Was wont to wander yon majestic slope Of ridgy rocks, where tumbling down amain The cataract pours its hoary deluge, there She pored on Nature, or with frenzied eye, Saw native Oreads mount the steep sublime, And like the mellow horn, in cadence sweet, Call notes, responsive to the wild waves dash Against the jutting shore! Hail! happy morn, Thrice hail ambrosial eves, when the fresh gale Of honied fragrance woo'd my fervid lip, Or sigh'd, enamour'd, on my roseate cheek, When the first dawn appear'd! Bear witness you! For you alone my ecstacy could know! How oft I called mild Hesper to return, When by his argent wand of light, the valves Of day were shut with foldings black conceal'd Of ebon bars, and the portcullis huge Of a drear cloud, whose sable scenery, caught One parting smile of day's envermeil'd face! Then would I dream of scenes romantic there, In visionary gleam of inward thought, New figures trace, unseen by waking eye! Muse! tell the tale of my enraptur'd breast, When from a fleecy cloud of amber hue, A nymph descending met my ravish'd sight; Her front with lightnings wreath'd, her glowing waist Bound with the varying rainbow's lucid zone. In a gold clasp her copious tresses join'd, And flow'd luxuriant on her crimson robe, Whose ample folds, by wildest nature form'd, Devoid of attic grace and cut succinct, Swept the blue air with winnowing scope, and blazed In wond'rous colours changing ever new, To mœlibean tint, or saffron glow; Tyrian, or soft Ionian, and each cast, Famed in the east, ripe store of mimic dyes! Full many a sylph her airy sojourn shared, And waved full many a rosy coronet, And rich festoon, to deck her panting brow! Innvention first advanced; prime source of song, And to the warbling wind her flying touch Apply'd; struck by her touch the trembling chords Sung loud, and in one rapid peal combin'd The sweet, the solemn, and the martial charge! Caught by the sound, methought the goddess view'd The mighty minstrel, on his purple cheek She fix'd the dewy languish of her eye, And seem'd to own him master of her heart! A long succession of illustrious bards Their empress follow'd, and as they approach'd A stream of living glory flow'd behind! Oh! press not thus upon my shrinking eye! Oh! spare the burstings of my aching heart, For sure such vision ne'er entranc'd before The human mind, save when on Milton's soul, Chief leader of the tuneful train, a rush Of deluging light, from heav'nly sluices burst Upon his op'ning soul; his visual ray Unmeet for such a waste of glaring scenes, Bewilder'd in the blaze! for ever fled His mortal form.—Next sportive Spencer came; Sharp points of wit adorn'd his burning breast, And on a shield of gold that hid his arm, In fairy characters Eliza shone. But from his corslet, with sweet myrtle twined In braided thorns, “a heart right well pourtrayed” Bore the lov'd name of rural Rosalind. And Cowley! son of wanton wit, came on; And Pope, the lustre of Belinda's lock, Waved high in air, while thousand sylphids sate Thron'd on each curl, and in their tiny grasp A javelin gleam'd, with diamond tipp'd, to guard The violated hair; thus o'er the fleece By Colchic Jason gain'd, and the rude spells, By Mcdean heroes, stood in silent pause, And wonder'd at the payment of their toil. Each gallant chief his sevenfold shield display'd, And drew the half-sheath'd faulchion! horrent spears Gleam'd to the twikling of the tremulous moon, And plumes proud-crested floated on the lap Of negro night, charm'd with the martial crew! But more the motley caravan attend; Of noble names in the large list of fame Yet passing hasty on, to 'scape the ken Of critic pride, and the grim cynic's snarl. Mason, with Gray, to Dryden's silver car Impetuous urg'd, the reverend minstrel smil'd, And join'd sage converse with the tuneful pair; But lo! a modest bard of humbler mien, Their footsteps follow'd, Dante's hoary shade Majestic, hover'd o'er his head, and placed A paradisial wreath upon his brow, While holiest numbers glided from his tongue. Him Ariosto view'd with kind regard, And stopp'd his chariot, griffin-yoked in air, To thank the son of his translated fame. Now myriads came tumultuous, frantic heat Glow'd in each eye! a mimic tribe were they, For Dullness dress'd them in her robes of state, To mock the pageant of a mightier queen. Orlando's bard the magic horn, Astolfo's horn. renown'd, Seiz'd in his wrath, and blew a blast so dread, That all the embryo vision chac'd away. THE CAVE OF PATRONAGE. Partitions twain this motley cave divide, Form'd like the ivory doors of fabled fame; Chimæra's beauteous crowd the left-hand side, And angel promises of loveliest frame; There every wight ideal sees his aim, With flying coyness his rash heart deride: Yet hopes he (fool!) to catch the glitt'ring toy, And gain it with a fresh recruit of pride. In vain, the fairy meteors soon destroy His bosom-rest serene, and mar each lively joy. So through the horrid length of bog and mire, Doth Ignis Fatuus lead the weary hind, Catching his simple eye with fatal fire, And lulling with deceit his honest mind: But soon doth he the hard-earn'd diff'rence find; Meand'ring labyrinths his footstep tire, Unholy figures gambol 'fore his sight, Sprinkling fell mildew, while the tempest's sire Pipes horrible the gloomy dirge of night, And shakes the turrets round, with fierce and wild affright. Thus bard, who trusts the former cave will thrive, For soon a trap-door swallows him below, There the poor credulous wretch must ever live, And bear the stings of penury and woe: Like image, playful children mould in snow, Fade his bright hopes and can no more survive; Despair stands ever near; ah! ruthless fiend, With iron fang the harrow'd breast to rive; And still the demon prompts a sudden end, And smiles with sallow cheek, and arrogates the friend. Here dol'rous shadows stalk across the gloom, And sweep their moody harps with frantic hand; Hoar-headed minstrels burst the mould'ring tomb, And roam sad-hearted here! a hapless band! Still rancour with severest reprimand, Doth vex them sore, and justifies their doom; The canker care their bloomy garland taints, And breathes pollution o'er the sweet perfume; Lo! while young Poesy, soft virgin, faints, The wolf-eyed spirits yell, and goad the suffering saints. Here Mulla's minstrel, sweetest Spencer, roves, And warbles heav'nly his dejected lay; Too tender Otway seeks the baleful groves; And laureat Dryden shuns Detraction's day. But lo! yon infant Chatterton. soul that fades away! Erst once so sprightly with the laughing loves; Why does he walk with melancholy pace, And sullen eye, that mocks the gay alcoves? Why does he turn aside his angry face, And shun of fellow-guests, unkind, the pathway trace? No more, my Muse, lest Patronage should hear, And hurl thee headlong to her darksome den; Phœbus, just now, check'd harsh my wrathful ear, And bade, beware the varying hearts of men; Should all desert my humble head, what then? Illustrious fame my volumed praise will rear; Illustrious fame will spread her thousand wings, And shed rich glories on my passing bier; Illustrious fame will tune her silver strings, And place my honour'd bust 'bove Cæsars, chiefs, and kings. Though haughty Burleigh crush'd blithe fancy's son, Say, whose more godlike name shall longer last? O! far more glorious than the monarch-crown, That precious wreath which minstrelsy has placed On poet's awful brow, sublimely graced. The diadem with lustrous jewels sown, Is poorly pilfer'd from the earthy mine; But Fancy's fair judicious hand alone, Hath gem'd the tuneful braid with buds divine, Which shall for ever more with hue ambrosial shine. EDMUND AND ELWINA. A TALE. INSCRIBED TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE COUNTESS OF MOIRA. Fierce war, and faithful love, And truth severe, by fairy fiction drest. Gray's Bard. “Ah! dry, my love, that tender tear, That bursting sigh restrain, For Edmund loads the sable bier, And tears and sighs are vain. “In me a kinder heart behold, In me a purer love; I strove to gain thy hand of old, But ah! in vain I strove. “So languid grew thy melting eye, So heav'd thy panting breast, That I could ne'er approach thee nigh, But sigh among the rest. “Then turn again that eye so blue, Then let thy bosom beat, For with a heart so pure, so true, I kneel before thy feet. “One glance of genial love impart, One smile extend to me, And cure again that aching heart, That always bled for thee. “Ev'n now I feel thy heav'nly charms, My heart can feel them now; And, sunk within thy snowy arms, I ratify my vow.” “Hold, impious wretch!” a peasant cry'd, In minstrel's garb array'd, “Nor taint the poet's loveliest pride, A bashful, blooming maid!” Struck by the sound, the chieftain turn'd, And look'd with rage around, And smote, while all his visage burn'd, The minstrel to the ground. “What peasant thus presumes to bar My prosp'rous way to joy: What hireling tempts unworthy war, Or dares my hopes destroy? “Rash miscreant, tell thy lineage all, Nor tell it with a lie.” Thus answer'd, rising from his fall, The youth, with modest eye: “By Tweed's fair banks my father liv'd, Two blooming sons had he, And yet the hoary man surviv'd To bless his progeny. “But ah! the eldest youth was blind To every social tie, And by his deeds of hate unkind, Caus'd many a bitter sigh. “I was the youngest hope; alas! That I have liv'd so long; To see good Albert's glories pass, And swell some doleful song.” The chieftain's cheek here chang'd to pale, And frenzy turn'd his look, And, starting at the wond'rous tale, Thus quick the minstrel spoke. “A lovely maid possess'd my soul, Ah! would that soul was gone, Beneath a brother's stern control It heav'd full many a groan. “He sent me to a foreign land, He dealt my dole of woe, He robb'd my true-love's plighted hand, And still my tears must flow. “Yet, yet, though nearest to my blood, A villain's name I hate, Still I remember yonder wood, Where he has fix'd my fate.” “Enough!” the frighted chief reply'd, “Thou raven to my doom! Oh! here's my sword, with slaughter dy'd, To bid thee welcome home. “Inhuman murd'rer! who am I?” He cast his garb aside, And drew from off his martial thigh The sword with slaughter dy'd. “Thus take thy due, yet hold my hand, Nor seek a brother's blood.” Awoke by Pity's mild command, The mild'ned minstrel stood. He clasp'd the fair one's trembling arm, And show'd her Edmund's face: “Ah! whence,” cried she, “this mystic charm! Ah! whence this lov'd embrace! “Art thou my Edmund? tell me true; Art thou so kindly giv'n, To make thy murd'rous rival rue, To cleanse my soul for Heav'n?” Depress'd, the elder chieftain sigh'd, And curs'd o'erruling hate, Then kiss'd with cordial lip the bride, Then bless'd the turns of fate. CHEERFULNESS. Euphrosyne, ecstatic guest, What sunny shrine, what favour'd breast, Wilt thou resume? O! wilt thou deign To bless the unaspiring swain, Or, o'er the front of greatness pour Thy joyous thoughts, a radiant show'r? Say, wilt thou gild the ev'ning shade, The artless bow'r of sylvan maid? Wilt thou her rosy lip perfume, Her eye's resistless glance illume; Her purple cheek with livelier hues Invest, their brightness ne'er to lose? Or, like the rest of Fortune's train, For gorgeous court desert the plain, Glad the proud beauty's smile to grace, And revel on her foreign face? No follower thou of Fortune's crew: Delightful nymph! full oft I view Thy vivid influence kindly spread O'er the low cot and tott'ring shed: Then come, my bright, my best reward, And make thy son the happiest bard; And smiling lead along with thee, Humour quaint, and Jollity; And gay Romance, who loves to rove Fantasy's elysian grove; And sparkling Wit, and Angel-youth, His diamond arrows tip'd with truth, His godlike hair, of braided rays, His vest, a meteoric blaze; Come these along, while Envy gaunt, (Her eyeballs impotent to daunt) And Malice, snarling, scowl aloof, Fell tigers! while of temper-proof, Thy starry target bids retire Their gall'd shafts, pointed fierce with ire. How blest my humble cottage then, A snug retreat from worldly men; My blooming flow'rs, my cooling trees, My arbours consecrate to ease; My fruitage ripe, my meadows fine, My bowls for ever crown'd with wine; Pure Friendship seated by my hearth, And silver-tressed, ancient Mirth; And frolic Love, unforc'd, and yet Not quite approaching to coquette; My servants happy as could be, What troubles then would frighten me? MELANCHOLY. 'Tis night—and this the silent hour When Melancholy seeks her bow'r Of sablest yew, embrowned deep, To fold her drooping arms, and weep. Sad syren stay! intrusive maid! And I will follow to the glade, And join my dirge of woe with thine; And statue-fixt, at Horror's shrine, My dark, nocturnal pray'rs rehearse In cadence low of saddest verse; Verse, such as once Medea pay'd To the drear habitants of shade; Verse, such as fits the leaden ear Of listless, gorgon-ey'd Despair! Ye pow'rs of midnight! tend my song, And you, grim messengers, that throng About the new-made grave, and steal The heart's blood, mark'd with many a spell, And petrify'd to purple stone For causes yet unheard, unknown. Hush!—busy elves, that ply around; Lay light your wings in slumber bound, 'Tis silence, soft, and sad, and slow, With cypress stole, and veil of snow, That creeps, (aye, startling at each breeze That rushes through the shudd'ring trees) Along yon aisle of dismal hue, Faint flashes from the taper blue, Lending a momentary glimpse, to show Where the dumb victims lye below! And who those fiends that after come, Wrapt in the thickest garb of gloom? My blood is froze, my pulse is still! 'Tis pale Remorse, whose vitals feel Ten thousand restless vultures gnaw, And Conscience, with her bloody maw! 'Tis Murder—see his eyeballs gleam Red lightning! and his glances stream Along the dagger's azure line. But hark! what noise invades the shrine, What breaks our Goddess' dread repose? 'Tis felon Force, that dare oppose The flight of ghastly Fear!—Behold Squadrons of glassy sprites unfold The shrinking wretch—his blasted eyes Sink inward—oh! he faints, he dies! They come, they swarm! terrific all! Heav'n's! let the hideous fabric fall. THE PEASANT'S APPEAL. Ye lordly sons of independant sway! Supreme in honour, as in wealth secure, Who from the hut, disdainful, turn away, And slight the simple suff'rings of the poor; Won by the magic of prevailing woe, Soft Pity's dew-drop trembling in your eye, Oh! quit each idle pomp of painted show, And lift the latch on shrinking Penury. No more the bright hearth lends its cheerful blaze; With plenty teems no more the frugal board; No more the infant round its parent plays, Or smiling welcome owns the cottage-lord. Long wint'ry hours of ceaseless labour past, When night to toil brief interval bestows, He views with care each darling face o'ercast, And pangs domestic torture his repose. No ruddy features, on the turf-clad seat, That fronts his door, at ev'ning close, are seen; No anxious looks his fond approaching meet, Or little footsteps brush the daisy'd green. The sweet repast of cordial kindness o'er, His stool no oft-invited pilgrim draws, Prompt to relieve with legendary lore, Of wearied industry the festive pause. Scarce can his sinewy strength, and sun-burnt brow, Wrest a dry morsel from the gripe of Pride, Sufficient to sustain life's languid glow, Or with a famish'd family divide. Lost is the garden's small, but useful bound, Whose vegetable charms so gaily spread; Where the tall bean, luxuriant, breath'd around, Or silver turnip rear'd its tufted head: Forgot the culture of a master's hand, Obnoxious weeds the happy confines seize, The specious hemlock's baleful blooms expand, And thistly down waves to the barren breeze. What sorrows must the father's heart assail, Should Sickness, with redoubled rage invade, Fever, wild fiend, or pin'd consumption pale, Want's hideous servants, desolate the shade? Methinks I mark him in this state forlorn, With torment writhing on the cold, damp floor, By each infuriate thought remorseless torn, 'Till the big anguish bursts,—and thought's no more. Taught by this artless, not untender strain, What varied ills the vassal hind await, What silent wrongs inflict severest pain, And bend him, groaning, to his ruthless fate; Ye lordly sons of independant sway! Supreme in honour, as in wealth secure, Ne'er from the hut, disdainful, turn away, Nor slight the simple suff'rings of the poor! AN IRREGULAR ODE TO THE MOON. Now, when faint purpling o'er the western sky, The lord of day his faded lustre weaves, And through yon wild-wood's trembling leaves Shoots his last solitary ray: O! let me woo thee from thy sapphire shrine; To my rapt eye thy snowy breast display. The tranquil pause, the ecstacy divine, The vision'd scene, serenely bright, And all the witcheries of the Muse are thine! The poet's fabling fancy told How, erst in silent pomp descending, O'er Latmos' brow thy radiant crescent bending, Thou cam'st to bless a shepherd boy; And pouring thy delicious charms, Forsook thy shining sphere, Immaculately clear, To taste immortal love in mortal arms. But Slander tun'd the felon lyre, Refin'd and chaste, thy vestal fire, Averse to amorous pangs and ruder joy! Queen of the pensive thought, Forgive his fault; Nor to another bard deny The mildness of thy front, the fondness of thine eye! Lo! from thy beamy quiver fall Arrowy points, that pierce the ground, And light the glow-worm's twinkling lamp; O'er the pale lake's margin damp The fiery phantoms dance around, Till scar'd by frolic Echo's cavern'd call, They burst their circle, shudd'ring flit away, And meltingly in thy wan veil of humid light decay. Oft let me, by the dimpled stream, Kissing thy reflected gleam, The solemn hour of midnight spend; When no cares the bosom rend, When sorrow's piteous tale is done, And trouble sunk with the departed sun. For strife is his, and mad'ning war, And deaf'ning tumult, never mute: But on thy silent moving car Wait Peace, and dew-ey'd Pity's tender train, And Love, sweet warbling to the soothing flute, Whose dying note Is wont to float Seraphic on the night-gale's airy wing, Tempting the planet choir their heav'nly hymns to sing. Hear me!—so may the bird of woe Aye greet thee from her bowery cell below; And ocean's rapid surges stand, Check'd by thy silver hand— For dear the tender twilight of thy sway, The soothing silence, and the modest glow That smooths thy brow, When stream thy amber tresses on the air; Twined with many a roseate ray, Irregularly fair. Dear, too, the shadowy lustre of thy face, As mid yon silent band thy pomp proceeds: Beneath thy influence, best Fond transports balm the lover's breast, When Thought intent, with musing pace, On each delicious promise feeds, And o'er the sombre waste a kindred gloom can trace; While lubbard Folly Sunk in the dreamless grave of slumber dense, Robb'd of each twinkling sense That faintly clear'd the darkness of his mind, Lies prone. Lo! beckon'd by an airy band, Yon sapphire-skirted cloud behind, I spy the lovely vestal, Melancholy; And, sweeter than the sweetest tone Of music, melting on the tingling ear Of sainted sprite, by choral seraph's hand, Catch each celestial sigh, which sad and slow Steals o'er my heart a charming woe. Entranced above vain earthly joys I stand, (Voluptuous sorrow, bliss sincere!) Nor envy the proud wretch, who, madly gay, Courts the licentious glare of grief-disclosing day! What, though beneath thy startled sight The hideous hag of night Gores with deep lash her visionary mare; Or, brooding on some beauteous breast, Chills the cramp'd vein, and stops the liberal course Of nature, wither'd by the powerful pest, Who, grappling on the heart with tyger-force Her fleshless fangs, beholds with iron stare Each struggling pant of weak despair, And gluts with smother'd shrieks the demon ear: Soon fades the baseless spell, Soon drops th' ideal arm its harpy hold; While, rising from the fray severe, Its languid victim looks suspicious round, Seeks the imaginary wound, And smiles to feel her frame by fancy'd ills controll'd! Thine the calm, the solemn hour, When Genius from her bright ethereal bow'r Stoops to touch the thought with fire, To bid the science-pinion'd soul aspire; And mid yon radiant worlds sublime, Hold converse with her sons of ancient time: The rapturous hour of secret love, When mutual all the trembling passions move, When none but Heav'n can hear the vows divine, Are also thine: The free embrace that tells the heart sincere, The wish completed, and the love-fraught tear; While coward Fear Aloof his dubious dull attendants draws, And honest Sympathy fulfils her sacred laws! Nor let the sun his gorgeous scenery prize, Trick'd in each gaudy hue: Lo! on thy lucid vault of spotless blue, How quaintly bends the lunar bow, And wreaths the front of Heav'n with vary'd dyes! How, mingling, melts the humid glow Of blended colours, in one matchless blaze, Studding with golden rays The splendid cope, where sheeted wide Spreads thy pale glory's undulating tide! Thee, too, the swelling Ocean meets with pride; And, as he heaves his azure breast, Courts from thy kindling glance the vivifying gleam Which bids his sparkling surges shine, In borrow'd beauties drest; Till in the boundles mirror thou canst see Thy answering image clear; And the still lapsing waters hear, Greeting with tribute floods thy sovereign shrine, Thee ever praising, ever fed by thee! O! parent of each nobler deed, Thy midnight counsels, in his country's right Bid the patriot dare to bleed; Thy placid scenes of undisturb'd delight Awake th' ecstatic lyre; Thy scenes where Peace and hermit Wisdom hoar For holy intercourse retire, To shun of wassail noise th' unmeaning roar; And with meet awe adore That Will Omnipotent, whose steady arm Lanc'd'mid yon rolling spheres thy moulded ball, And, providently pleas'd with all, Breath'd o'er thy favourite face an inexpressive charm! FUTURITY. Why should the shrinking pinion fear to rise? Why dread the mental journey of the skies? Why still to native earth ignobly cling, And tune to transient themes the vocal string? What though dark Error dims the searching gaze, Though Wisdom wanders in the lucid maze; Though trembling Doubt retard the lofty flight, And strong Belief cries loudly, All is right; Yet let us follow the mysterious clue, While smiling Hope, and dauntless Faith pursue; This brave excursion, this sublime desire, Marks some faint impulse of celestial fire, Some ling'ring lustre of angelic sense, To former, future bliss some fond pretence: Nor shun the path where saints and sages trod, Lo! Nature urges on to know our God! Each finer spring, each secret link to trace, Each streaming glory of his effluent grace, Each depth to dive, each pointless height to scan, And own his mercy justified to Man! O! while the mighty subject lifts my soul, Let no vain muse with fabling voice control; Far from my breast, by simpler knowledge smit, The brilliant diction, and the meteor wit; Sublimely plain, I scorn the glitt'ring guile, All bursts of fancy, and all forms of style! What then is Man? why born? why born to die, Doom'd a vile worm to crawl, a seraph fly? Did strong necessity enforce his birth, Does Heav'n repose upon the child of earth! Hangs there, of sympathy, a social claim, By angels shar'd, to raise him up again? Or, quickly mould'ring in congenial clay, Are all the vital traces worn away? Is God offended with his moulded dust? Can he forgive a sin, for he is just? Can he condemn the faults of flesh and blood, By his own hand instill'd? for he is good. Can he destroy, when, trick'd in specious guise, Vice undermines the breast? for he is wise. These dark enigmas, this important spell, Unerring oracle of reason tell! For surely, purest essence, thou dost know If folly is not all our sense below! Say, should the mortal lord exalt his slave, Grace him with gifts, then plunge him in the grave? Would'st thou not, gracious spirit, curse the deed, And bid the victor with the victim bleed? Who then so impious, who so madly blind, To think Almighty, spotless, meek, refin'd, Mid burning gulphs prepares that gloomy bed, Where the tir'd pilgrim shall recline his head? To wrath immortal, fiercest tortures ty'd; Was it for this the Son, the Saviour dy'd? What need of final judgment's awful hour, If instant flames the parted soul devour? If, through cold realms of ever-during frost, Through ever-kindling fires, the soul is lost! Seiz'd by due penance, when redeem'd by death, Dark dæmons brooding o'er the gasping breath, The gasping breath, that seeks some dismal shore, Where the red deluge forms a mingled roar Of wretches, to immortal gibbets chain'd, By stars oppress'd, or whirlwind force sustain'd, Hurl'd to and fro, the gibe of yelling sprites, Through days uncheerful, and infernal nights! O! exquisite distress! oh, startling thought, Beyond the highest pitch of fancy wrought; Severest of severe! poor trembling thing, (For thing thou art if so) what torments spring, What twilight cares, what agonies unknown— Will no kind suppliance to the sapient Throne, No vows, no pray'rs, soft intercession force, Or, the great mandate from its fate divorce. Is Pity's ear quite clos'd? Is Mercy's eye Averted from thy woes? Is soft reply, Or soothing promise of some stated end, When pangs no more the writhing frame shall rend, Deny'd—Forbid it Reason!—Heav'n forbid! The tear of melting rage, in deep clouds hid, Shall fall on ev'ry wound, like healing dew, Again the long-divided whole renew; Again to man his cherub-semblance give, And Death himself beset, allow the dead to live; Sin purg'd by touch ethereal, sin no more, The Sire shall pardon, and the Son restore! THE DEATH OF HOWARD. Sweet Pity, pensive maid, who oft unseen By vulgar eye, to loftier visions led Thy fav'rite son! Celestial visitant! Now weave the laurel, raise the votive song, And fondly feeling for his doom, unmeet For such a tender heart, ah! gently weep, And dew with holiest tear thy Howard's grave. For he, unconscious of his high desert, Spread his kind blessings over every land, And ev'ry weeping country oft receiv'd The general patriot. Then his praise be sung By every bard who feels for modest worth Untimely blasted! oh, let not his urn, By haughty insolence and vice profan'd, Remain a long memorial of disgrace To climes ungrateful: let his sacred dust Receive the meed of some melodious tear! Goddess begin; and let the faded form Of woe-worn Misery attend the plaint, And soothe her anguish with the sorrowing strain. Such men as he are not the common growth Of common ages; Virtue rears their youth, Hoar Wisdom leads them to her oliv'd shades, And sweet Compassion charms their tender breasts To godlike pity, that their riper years May raise Dejection from her iron couch, Pluck the sharp thorn from Mis'ry's rankled heart, And glad a drooping country, while the earth, Proud of their virtues, propagates their fame. Such men as he are not the haughty slaves That brave their masters, ply the subtle wile, To dash the goblet from Affliction's lip, And swelling with the praise of flatt'rers vile, Outspend profusion on their menial train: He was too gentle for such practices; His eye ne'er glanc'd upon a son of woe, But his heart shudder'd at the suff'rer's tale; Gaunt Poverty ne'er look'd him in the face, But the full tear impearl'd his manly cheek With softest sympathy for alien pain. How often has he pierc'd the cavern-gloom, Where want, and sickness on his scanty bed, Expiring fainted, and with farewell sigh Look'd long misfortunes to his infant-train! His ready hand supply'd their wants unwept By sterner tyrants; from his moist'ning eye, Bland Comfort smil'd, and when their Howard came, Hope, Charity, and Pity, lead his step! How often, nobly prodigal of life, Has the dank dungeon echoed to his moan, And his blest presence gilt the cave of night! While, grown regardless of his galling chains, The captive view'd the stranger's nobler mien In silent rapture, paus'd at ev'ry word, And hail'd the harbinger of better fate? How has the tongue of cherub Innocence Lisp'd thy fond praise in nature's genuine strain, And bless'd thy bounty for a father sav'd! Nor only gen'rous to a few select, Nor bias'd by the country of the wretch That claim'd thy bounty. The poor black that toils From morn to eve, and with a heavy heart Perceives the bondage of that day undone, Ah! doom'd to linger out the night in chains, And starting frantic from his moody dreams, Feel the rough iron fester in his soul! He felt thy bounty too; thy gen'rous heart Repaid his sorrows, and thy plaintive groan Bemoan'd that he was born to be a slave! Ah, sad refinement! can a fairer skin Bear less tormenting than the negro-train? Have not their bosoms felt some kindred pang For wives, and dearest children left behind, To the rude mercy of the planter's soul! Then why not Britain heave the gen'rous sigh, At Indian slav'ry! ah! that she would weep At their long woes, and make the ruffian train That pamper lux'ry with the negro's toil, In dire atonement pay with tears of blood! Then would th' oppress'd uprear their drooping head, And India's Genius, on his crystal car, Proclaim his long, long suff'ring sons were free. Such meed, by mild-repenting Britain paid, Would fill the land with long-lost ecstacy, And soothe the sorrows of her Howard's ghost! Who now, perchance, for human grief distress'd, Seeks the gray twilight of th' elysian shade, And solitary mourns worth's swift decay, And the long tenor of his life undone: A life of goodness! spent to bless mankind, And make wan Mis'ry's train forlorn rejoice! To smooth the frown of arbitrary sway, And rank th' aspiring monarch with the man In social compact? What are kings, that they, Despight of justice, equity, and right, And all the poignant feelings of the soul, Should wrest the thunderbolt from wrath divine, And on their brothers hurl the ruin down? They too must die, unpity'd, and the wreath Of vaunting glory wither o'er their tomb. The news that told an emperor was dead, Whose frown could ruin, and whose smile could bless, Affected people, and congeal'd their hearts, To think ambition had so small a bound! But the sad tale that told a Howard died, Was half rever'd for speaking on such themes, And half accus'd for telling so much woe! Nations were silent at the dol'rous tale, And cloud-rob'd Horror, to each murky cell, In deeper accents, swell'd the piteous dirge, And mourn'd the patriot—Pale-cheek'd Pity sigh'd, Confusion listen'd, with her horrent hair; And Madness, starting at the fatal sound, Her senses wilder'd by excess of grief, Clanks her huge chains—Now she is calm awhile; Silent sad sorrow trickles from her eye; But now again, by madding fancy work'd, She raves and shudders—then she weeps again! Ah, see yon scene! congenial to the heart Of sternest sorrow! There the father lies; His hoar head tells an age of varying woes! The clotted tear that furrows down his cheek, Ah! fretted often by the hand of Care! Was shed not for himself. See there his wife, Bereft of every comfort, lays her down By his dear side; and there his daughter fair, In loveliest sorrow, on her father's breast Her meek hand lays—in firmer grief, the son Unshrinking stands, a youth of modest worth; But ah! how seldom bashful Virtue thrives! They wait their helper! but the fiend Despair In sullen anguish whispers, He is dead! While every echo vibrates with the sound. Wail on ye mourners! roll the leaden eye Of gorgon Disappointment, for no more He comes, to cheer your hearts with anxious care, Dispensing Bounty's ray through the thick night Of hopeless Mis'ry drear! No more he comes To wipe the salt tear from thy closing eye, That, quite debarr'd of ev'ry earthly joy, Ev'n the poor aspect of the winter sun, Pores inward on the soul, and ev'ry morn Opens to see a future night of pain. O Britain! thou hast suffer'd by his fall, And ev'ry son bewails him! now be just To all his virtues, that enrich thy fame, And make thy praise superior to thy state! O! let each British breast, the noblest shrine, Contain his mem'ry, imitate his ways, And wide expand the soul at Virtue's call! O! let sweet Pity, the celestial maid, That fir'd each nobler symptom of his heart, Each worthier action, now possess each son Of gen'rous freedom, and each friend of woe! Such honours best will sanctify his name. Nor storied bust, nor laureate wreath, can vie With imitative virtues of the soul: So (if as great a man can rise again!) In future times, perhaps, some other friend Of virtue may extol thy rising power, Lead thy sons forward to the splendid fane Of seraph Honour, plant thy laurels there, And drop a tear on Pity's cypress'd tomb! From thence proceed to ev'ry house of woe, Relieve the wretched with impartial hand, Bring their pure blessings to his native land, While weeping millions ponder on his name, And hail him—rival of their Howard's fame! ON HISTORY. Bright on the page of hist'ry beams each star, Rever'd in peace, or terrible in war; The statesman hire to latest ages lives, And the sweet poet with his Muse survives; Still thunders one to the admiring crowd, While flows his speech in the dumb volume loud; Still silent senates pause on every stroke, And letters speak what once the hero spoke: The other's verse each manly bosom charms, Represses, vigorates, enchants, and charms; The measured modes majestically glow, And pity weeps o'er scenes of stored woe. How sweet, to share the fight, unhurt, unharm'd, Start to the field with force ideal arm'd; Mark hot-brain'd Charles the regal banner wave, Or unknown hand implant his lowly grave? A Fred'rick, view, in martial strictness firm, Turn the quick rank, or place the dauntless turm; A William, snatch deep danger's highest wreath, And brave the iron front of fiercest death; A Raleigh write, a godlike Newton rise, Potent, to pierce the myst'ry of the skies! An Otway die, ev'n destitute of bread, And scornful vice triumph o'er Dryden dead; A meek usurper quit the royal stage, A Cromwell conquer, and a Cromwell rage; A Mary's hand unjuster sway resign, And great Eliza distant realms combine; Smile at the struggles of this puny globe, And turn from greatness and its ermine robe: O'er sorrows true, the past shed a fresh tear, And feel for turbulence you cannot fear. Hist'ry then, fond memorial of our life, Receptacle of quiet, mirth, or strife; World in epitome! contracted plan, The work of God transferring to a man! E'en we, when all our troublous storms are o'er, Shall view the light again, and live once more; Knowles's and Hollinshead's new tales devise, And Humes, and Robertsons, and Henrys rise. POETICAL PHRENZY. Where fades in yonder tented sky, The ling'ring sun's last rosy dye, I faintly view created forms, Forth from the purple clouds advance, While musing Fancy in her witching trance, Decks each fair shape with inexpressive charms; Serene, the dusky moments glide away, 'Till pensive ev'ning folds the silent valves of day. O! nought of wondrous or sublime, Can 'scape that minstrel's gifted sight; Whose breast the faery joys delight, And all the subtle spells of wizard rhime; He, o'er the pale moon's shaded face Can many a beauteous semblance trace; He, in the torrents tumbling flood, Can view, severe, its angry God; Or, when the elemental fiends conspire, Nature convuls'd, and sick'ning mid the gloom, His eagle-eye may, all unhurt, presume To mark the red right arm, that darts the forked fire. Where'er the poet bends his thoughtful way, Ideal crowds fantastic gambols play; Ev'n where the branches deep-embrown'd, Fling a delightful desert round, His piercing glance society can found: Where, low the tangled thicket lies; Imaginary cities rise; And, plain to wild Invention's ken alone, The forests boast of wonders not their own; Meanwhile, his visionary senses find, New airy children of Promethean mind. In some diviner dream, like those, Shakspeare, thy noblest spirit rose; Then, “sea nymphs rung the hourly knell;” Then, teem'd with hideous births the blasted heath; Then, left the royal Dane his earthy bed beneath; And Fancy whisper'd in thy ravish'd ear, Such matchless flights above yon lunar sphere, As rigid reason ne'er could tell! EPISTLE TO A YOUNG LADY, After many years absence. Tax'd with neglect, in me no common crime, I raise to justice the indignant rhyme; And while, through absence self thine eyes effuse Their wonted sweetness, court no fabled Muse; That sympathetic influence can beguile The dreary interval of many a mile; Gleam through the tempest, cross the dang'rous main, And smooth its liquid mountains to a plain. The genial gale, that wakes the infant spring, Such transport throws not from its purple wing; Studded with stars, the blue expanse of night, Beams not a softer, a serener light; Than feels my heart, when ev'ry fibre glows With the fond eulogy thy lyre bestows! When first, too weak to grasp the laurel-bough, I wove a rosy chaplet for thy brow; And, in its various hues, would idly trace, Some flowery semblance of thy charming face; Oft would the sweet seduction of thy smile, Attune my numbers, and enrich my style; Whate'er of fair or perfect, I design'd, Was merely copied from thy form or mind; Nor, fondly could the subject fail to warm, All softness was thy mind, all symmetry thy form! How oft have I beheld, in rapt'rous trance, Thy graceful steps adorn the sprightly dance; Or, fancy-fix'd th' angelic choir among, Caught the mellifluous magic of thy song; But transient these, to the exalt'd pow'r Of serious converse o'er the social hour, Ambrosial words, from ruby lips that flow'd, Bashfully wise, a banquet for a god! Come then, bewitching as thou art, illume My glowing numbers with immortal bloom; Nor only, on my glowing numbers shine, Let my bold spirit brighten with the line; Hoarded, with pious care, within my breast, Oh! ever let thy dear idea rest; There fix'd, the silent, secret object be, Of my poetical idolatry! So, shall each verse be exquisitely fraught With more luxurious tenderness of thought; So, weaning for awhile from heav'n his ear, And sedulous such rival theme to hear, Waller once more may see his Sidney's name, Reviv'd in song, superior, and the same; The same in beauty, that thy least pretence, In feeling far superior, and in sense. Oh! that as once, to Surry's anxious sight, The magic mirrors dim, fallacious light; Gave the fair face of lovesick Geraldine, So might I for a moment dwell on thine, That shadowy spell each vanish'd bliss would raise, And all my grief be lost in one voluptuous gaze. Cruel! with cold indifference, to defame That bosom-shrine, where Friendship's holy flame Burns, like the vestal lamp, with lasting fire, Still fed by hope, and ever-young desire, Such saintly fire, perchance, as seraphs feel, Who round th' eternal throne their radiant cohorts wheel; Or, martyr'd souls, ascending from the blaze, In murmurs of unutterable praise; Or, such as light the phœnix' fun'ral nest, With fragrant fume, in Araby the blest. Sole angel of that orb! couldst thou profane So pure an altar with so deep a stain, Fair truth, for grim ingratitude, remove, And lift that dæmon on the wreck of love? The vow is vain:—for who, indeed, would fly To gloomy dungeons, from the golden sky? Who Hebe's nectar'd bowl would, madly, slight For venom'd draughts, all satiate of delight?— But when those exquisite illusions fade, Ah! once in richest pageantry array'd; Which stream'd o'er youth's gay dawn their orient dies, Now doom'd, in vision only, to arise; When, like the transient Iris' humid ray, Dissolv'd, those fascinating forms decay, Celestial forms! so delicately faint, Which rapture's fairy-pencil loves to paint; May mem'ry from my vacant brain depart, Lost be my fancy, lost my tuneful art; And that no gleam may cheer the lonely waste, Last be thy image utterly effac'd. A RHAPSODIC ADDRESS TO VARIETY. Poetic Iris, ever-changing, Teach me thy cameleon-song, Bear me each pathless wild along, For what new climate art thou strange in, Through fancy's labyrinth incessant ranging: And ever shield my finer sense, 'Gainst listless lounging indolence, Voluptuous rogue, who loves to lie, With languid limbs and stupid eye, By some smooth stream's melodious fall, Oft vex'd by echo's sportive call, Or hollow wind, shrill whistling by, Or thunder in the distant sky. She best delights on some bold mountain's brow, To cull the wild flow'r scanty nature flings; I seek no garlands for my front below, For heav'nward flight, with broad refulgent wings Of hoary length, shall cleave my liquid way, Sublime his floating form display, And meet the azure-vested morn, Faint in the east with a rosy breast, Just newly born! Then the sharp sound of scythes shall grate on my ear, And the loud shout of sportsmen in rapid career; Meanwhile, the dewy landscape opens, Glitt'ring on my raptur'd eye, Gleamy spires, hoar cliffs, and meadows, Waving bright, with many a dye. Far distant towns, with winding seas embost, And castles, frowning drear, in purply vapours lost. Goddess, grant my ardent pray'r, Thine profuse in varying light; Then, gliding through the colour'd air, Flash upon my dazzled sight, Goddess of sincere delight! THE THRUSH AND THE OWLS. A FABLE. A modest thrush, soft foe to art, Oft charming the poetic heart; Who, sweetest of the feather'd throng, Warbled at eve his melting song; Or, hail'd the dawn's first blushing ray, With gratitude's ecstatic lay, The wild wood echoes, list'ning nigh, Would ev'ry mellow note reply; And lov'd the sound so simply sweet, In native energy complete; Yet envy mark'd our sylvan bard, Envy, the fairest breast's reward; Envy, the shade of purest light, Tainting with flaws the jewel bright! In a dark barn, that border'd near, Three grave birds liv'd, in gloom severe, On critic tree, and fam'd for malice, Grim as three felons on a gallows; Like wretches plotting mischief still, Prepar'd to scandalize or kill, Yet daws and ravens styled those fowls, Most witty, venerable owls. Birds of a feather, always fit, And take plain ignorance for wit. Now, ever when our hero-thrush Would harmonize his tenant bush, Thrilling the tender tale of love, That call'd the twinkling stars above From their bright spheres, and bade them lean Attentive o'er the still serene, Those elves malicious, elves absurd, Hermaphrodites of cat and bird, With shrill to-hoo's came sweeping by, With leathern wing and stupid eye, Wheeling and rustling, till they marr'd The music of our rural bard; Who, frighted by th' ungracious clutter, Clos'd his sweet vespers with a flutter, Disdaining long to swell their pride (For, innocent, he all defy'd!) He no remonstrance fram'd, but fled In shades to hide his injur'd head. At last, by wrongs repeated wounded, Their empty nonsense he confounded; And thus, in keenest sting of satire, Broke through his calm and gentle nature: “Conceited sons of dulness hence, Who fly from merit, worth, and sense, With the same haste you fly from day, Damning the guiltless and the gay: Here, by consent of all the wood, My nest but bare and humble stood, Nor ever have I pilfer'd leaves From your tall tow'r: yon hedge-row gives, Thanks to kind Heav'n, whate'er I need: On the soft silvery dews I feed, Which morn, my patron, flings away, Nor ever pounce the living prey; No snares for harmless mice I plan, Like you, sirs, and that tyrant man. I have no fears for wrangling law, In debt to no one for a straw! But why do I such blockheads mind, Disgrace and outcasts of their kind; Why humour's force on reptiles spend In vain, who cannot comprehend. Away! nor taint my pure abode, Where nature worships nature's God; Such flimsy cynics I despise, But love the censures of the wise!” THE SEARCH; OR FLORIMEL STRAYED. Gentle shepherds, have you seen, Tripping o'er the flow'ry green, Her whose charms have wond'rous pow'r, Lavish Nature's fairest flow'r! Many tokens I can show By which my sweetheart you may know. In her cheeks sly dimples dwell, Like the rose's dewy bell; In her eyes, where rapture plays, Quivers shine of pointed rays; White her front as untrod snow, Her breath the sweet-pea's balmy blow; Her lips as tender morning red; Her teeth, rich pearls in coral bed; Her sunny tresses, waving, vie With the brown broom's golden dye. Yet, lest heedless, you should make Some unworthy, mean mistake, In the search for my soul's flame, Single out the brightest dame, Then bring the wand'rer back to me, For that surely must be she! THE POET TO HIS SOUL. O! spark divine, whose effluence bright Illumes that intellectual sight Which Nature's secret springs can view, And, lynx-like pierce creation through; O! breathing balm, whose sweetness heals The wounds poor injur'd merit feels; The gall of malice changes quite To anodynes of pure delight. O! lofty comfort, tow'ring high, Beyond yon star-enamell'd sky, Counting the brilliant glories there, And purging error's clouds severe. O! best inspirer, teaching all, Constant, at whose nocturnal call Entranc'd I wake, and converse hold With shades that rul'd the world of old. My muse, my portion of a god, Though shrin'd in this unmeet abode, This moving clay, this frail machine, Seldom invok'd, and seldom seen, Save by the visual ray of pray'r, Pour'd on the purple wing of air To Heav'n's high gate, where Pity stands, With Vengeance chain'd in brazen bands; Pity, whose soft and melting tone Can enter on th' eternal throne, And in soft plaintive notes of woe Describe the sons of grief below! O! thou, who still hast warm'd my heart, And must, and can we ever part? Must thou, lone pilgrim, darkling, dare Countries unknown, all wild and bare; Mid penal fires, affrighted stray, Or soar along the milky way: Delightful doubts! suspence sublime, That trembling wait the seal of Time, Of Time and Truth—Ecstatic tost, In seas of fancy thou art lost! Thy judgment reels, pale dread and gloom Sink thee in black Oblivion's womb, While with fresh palm bright Conscience crown'd, Stands smiling at the grim profound. In vain the shafts of Envy fly, Revenge in vain new shafts supply: Vague, ideot-babes, soon forc'd to yield, They cannot pierce thy shadowy shield, The sev'nfold gift of innocence Warding all mortal aim from thence! Let Want's cold grasp benumb this form, Sieg'd by Oppression's wint'ry storm; That form may feel the venom'd smart, When tortures tear, but still thou art! Safe on the gibbet or the rack, Though the strong chords of nature crack; Though demons crowd from flames to see The pains of poor mortality; And as they mark the bursting groan, Return contented to their own! Nor wealth, nor honours, would I take, Thy union, priceless friend, to break; Nor clog thy heav'nward plume, that springs Far, far, beyond the bliss of kings, Collecting, in thy mental roam, Wonders, to glad thy earthly home; And with the seraph throngs above Exchanging amity and love. Sweet commerce! where no oath is giv'n, But reason weds the mind to Heav'n. When on the beauteous bed of death, Blest, I resign the guiltless breath, Incense immaculate! still hang Ambrosial on the parting pang, Nor quit that fane thou lov'st on earth, But bloom in an immortal birth. ON THE SORROWS OF A DEPENDANT STATE. Ah! where shall modest Genius lay his head? For him nor blooms the primrose bed of joy, Nor Plenty pours her festal dainties wide; Nor bleeds the gen'rous grape in purple streams! Fond mother, weep o'er that unhappy child, The wayward Muse has mark'd for many a care; Full often doom'd to shrink (oh! doom severe) Into his cheerless cot, unfed, unknown, Unpity'd too, to think on better times. No flatt'ring crowds attend his morning sleep; No music, but the call of clam'rous duns, Inhuman fiends, insatiable, and loud. Should he presume lone wand'ring in his way, By rattling storms o'ertook, to seek some gate Of lofty semblance, straight the surly clown, With dogs less surly, plies the human chase. Proud dome, it was not so when thy first lord, A princely owner, met the man of song With open heart; the good old porter smil'd, And shook his sides and ruddy cheeks with glee, While the brisk seneschal, with sparkling eye, Brimm'd the huge cup, and pil'd the costly board. In this degenerate syncope, of aught Or amiable or grand, the minstrel droops O'er his sweet harp unstrung; and pitying views The sad decline of Virtue and the Muse. THE LAMENTATION OF DAVID OVER SAUL AND JONATHAN. The beams of Israel's glory die, The flow'rs of beauty are no more; Lo! on yon cloud-clad hill they lie, With visage ghastly pale, and floating in their gore! Full low the regal warriors bow Their helmed heads, and stoop the tow'ry crest, Their eye-lids seal'd by dreary woe, And grim Death brooding o'er each panting breast. How are thy champions' haughty boast Indignant dash'd with grim-ey'd Shame! How are the mighty fall'n, without a name! To live the bulwark of thy haughty coast. Tell not the dismal tale around, Lest rivals triumph at the sound, And hurl our fragile remnants down, While we, the fate of mighty woe, Through Gath with fierce revilings go, And feel th' unhallow'd taunts of hostile Askelon. Ye spiry mounts on Gilboa's swell sublime, Bow to the ground each nodding oak, Let no kind dews refresh the genial clime, Or waving fields the rip'ning power invoke; For there the shield inglorious lies, The mighty shield of royal Saul, As though no bright-plum'd seraphs mark'd his fall; As though no lightnings wing'd his flaming sword; No maily adamant embrac'd his form; No Godhead help'd his own anointed lord To rise superior to the storm. In many a bosom nobly gor'd, Stout Jonathan imbrued his dart; And fierce Saul flesh'd his ruddy sword In many a warrior's streaming heart; Then have they come untrophied back, Though death and sorrow crown the bold attack. As youth was mutual, so was death; The same sad moment saw each struggling, Through the lip quiver, wan, and cold: Fleeter than eagles they could chase the foe, Like lions bare the dauntless breast; But now their victor tale of life is told, Low are their deeds, their matchless conquests low, And many a pilgrim soothes their souls to rest. Ye blooming maids of Israel weep, In gorgeous purple's rich attire; His comely cheeks in tear of rapture steep, And fan with frequent sighs the fun'ral pyre. In the fell heat of furious war, Conquer'd alone by sudden chance, How are the mighty fall'n, the fam'd afar! How has proud Glory tumbled from her car! Ev'n at her wheels, involv'd in dust, Low lies the bloodless sword, the shiver'd lance; Blasted the victor wreath, and broke the warrior bust. Fresh bursts the torrent from my eye, The sluices of my panting breast Can scarce refrain th' increasing flood of woe! For thee shall heave th' eternal sigh, For thee my anxious soul be e'er distrest, My heart-wrung brother humbled low. How are the mighty fall'n! the victors bound, With barren palms of vict'ry crown'd. Death leads the train of triumph near, He lays the conqu'ror on the sable bier, The close-clench'd hand disarms, and snaps the quiv'ring spear. PEACE. WRITTEN IN 1801, AND INSCRIBED TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY ADDINGTON. Now Lord Viscount Sidmouth; the friend and protector of merit. Multa dies, variusque labor mutabilis ævi Retulit in melius, multos alterna revisens Lusit, et in solido rursus fortuna locavit. Virgil. As rising from the gloomy realms of night, The glitt'ring day-star shows his rosy light, Streams his soft radiance o'er the warbling grove, And wakes each spray to harmony and love; So, touch'd by tender thought of happier time, My renovated spirit soars sublime, To catch the lustre of thy genial rays, And bask, sweet Peace, in thy auspicious blaze! Already has the slaught'ring pow'r confest Thy gentle sway, and clasp'd thee to his breast: Already the rash sparks of fury fly From the dread circle of his blood-shot eye, While sooth'd to slumber by resistles charms, The grizzly warrior sinks into thy arms. See! where the smiling joys, a wanton train! Urge his rude car along the level plain, Each iron wheel entwine with florets gay, Or, fearful, wipe fresh drops of blood away. See! where the myrtle's balmy branch they rend, And living laurels with the olive blend, Pleas'd, o'er his rugged front's portentous lour, To shed, with lavish hand, the fragrant show'r; Till many a sprightly sport, and wayward wile, Unbend his features to a surly smile, And the grim god, dissolv'd in new-born bliss, Luxurious, faints upon each nectar'd kiss. While anxious Hawkesbury, whose fervid zeal, And forceful tongue, promote the public weal, Sagacious Hermes of th' applauding state! With winged speed confirms the will of fate, And bids each cloud before his flight remove, Charg'd with the mandates of our British Jove; Again, will Addington his car incline To the weak homage of my humble line? Nor scorn the minstrel-boy, whose modest aim Ne'er scal'd before the arduous steep of fame, Content, in lone obscurity, to sing, Nor bathe his bold lip in the Thespian spring. Delightful rushing on my raptur'd view, What pompous years their radiant march renew! A shining host! and crowded still behind, New, dazzling glories press upon my mind. Oblivion! let thy lenient finger steal O'er the sad, silent past, the shadowy veil! Ah! ne'er let mem'ry's melancholy spell Disturb the gallant bands that guiltless fell; Presenting to pale fancy's tearful sight, The ghostly terrors of each foreign fight; Save when, with pilgrim-step, she loves to trace, By moonlight dim, some memorable place, Where Pity, to her sacred vigil true, Wets the dead soldier's sod with holiest dew; Or sterner Honour consecrates the ground, Whose green turf lightly heaves o'er dust renown'd. Though late, the Muse, on Abercrombie's hearse, Hung her vain wreath of tributary verse; And still would paint with no ungraceful art, His Kempt's Lieutenant-colonel, and secretary to the late General Abercrombie, now in the same situation under General Hutchinson. high purpose, and benignant heart. One of the favor'd few, who best might claim A portion of his friendship, or his fame. Now brighter scenes attract her fond survey, Scenes that entice the wanderer on her way, And festive pleasures, drest in florid bloom, Indignant, chide her ling'ring o'er the tomb. Hark! the loud cannon from the Julian tow'r, With harmless thunder scares the midnight hour! Th' illumin'd domes their mimic stars display, And Thames' blue breast reflects a softer day! Again, majestic river! on thy tide, In splendid state shall anch'ring navies ride; Again, shall rapture hear, thy banks along, The seaman's whistle join the shepherd's song; And sun-burnt commerce waft, with patient smile, The wealth of worlds to her distinguish'd isle. Lo! where the woe-worn widow, trembling stands, And lifts to heav'n her supplicating hands; Lo! where the virgin, thrill'd with doubt severe, In modest anguish hides the trickling tear! Mourners, look up, and live! infectious air, Nor prison'd want, nor comfortless despair, Could from your sailor's faithful soul remove The stubborn ties of duty and of love. Yes! he shall come, with fond assiduous care, To soothe your sorrows, or at least to share; The manly strength, which oft, with lion-force, Through death's dire breach could urge its dauntless course; Once more shall for your helpless age provide, And shield you from the coward-taunt of pride! Methinks, escap'd by chance, from thousands slain, Proud of his wounds, and triumphing in pain, Fame-fed, awhile forgetful he is poor, I see the soldier ope his native door! The latch, by him untouch'd for many a year, Leaps to his hand!—and oh! what scenes appear! The wond'ring wife, approaching from afar, Scarce knows his face, deform'd with many a scar; The tott'ring grandsire, though his eye-sight fail, Feels the superior sense, within, prevail; The ready stool his prattling tribe prepare, Their wild black eyes upturn'd with dubious stare; Aside the knapsack's hairy wonder thrust; Or, from the polish'd musquet rub the rust. Then fledg'd with down, the hurrying moments fly. O'er many a question, many a quick reply, Fell siege, and fatal storm, and ambuscade, In dying embers on the hearth pourtray'd; 'Till wearied toil, to needful rest withdrawn, Adjourns th' unfinish'd story to the dawn. Cherubic Peace! whose wond'rous power can save Contending empires from the gaping grave, When, like an earthquake, felt by Nature's groans, Gigantic discord shakes establish'd thrones, And stooping from the whirlwind's wing sublime, His huge scythe seizes from the grasp of Time, Prepar'd, with one exterminating blow, To lay the labours of creation low. Again, beneath thy joy-inspiring shade, The chearful artizan shall ply his trade, Shape into symmetry the fluid mass Of pliant steel, or fire-tormented brass: Or stamp on kingly gold the monarch's head, No more condemn'd to mould the murd'rous lead. Again, encourag'd by the halcyon-sway, Wealth's merchant-sons shall crowd the busy quay, With costly cargoes load the shining ground, And pour rich plenty on each coast around. E'en the poor captive, whose disastrous doom, Has hurl'd him to the dungeon's dreary gloom, With kind compassion sooth'd, shall gladly know, That Britain venerates a fallen foe, Fond, with soft skill, to close each cruel scar, And heal the gashes of remorseless war. Yet must I mourn your lot, unhappy band! Who pine at distance from your natal land, Doom'd, in unpitied misery to roam, Abroad deserted, and despis'd at home; For I have often mark'd your lonely way, When hast'ning from the giddy and the gay, Some dark, congenial solitude, you sought, In whisper'd plaint t' impart the tender thought; While the unfeeling hind, who ne'er could boast Of fortune's favour, or bemoan'd it, lost, Whose heart ne'er own'd Humanity's sweet glow, Unsympathizing, scoff'd your social woe. Say, why should party's baneful pest divide The panting lover from his promis'd bride? The finer fibres of affection rend, And plant hostility 'twixt friend and friend? Yes! let the exil'd victim view, once more, His vintage swell, though double-dy'd in gore; Lord of himself, in his own mansion stand, And share the harvest, planted by his hand. Ah! would ambition learn his proper bound, Nor rear th' aspiring front terrific crown'd With sanguine gems, and lurid laurels, seen But seldom 'mid the olive's bashful green; Would temp'rate Reason's philosophic rule Assuage his frenzy, and his hot blood cool, Instilling gentler cares of home-felt joy, And sheath the sword, impatient to destroy; Soon would those souls, that fir'd the recent flight, In sacred league symphoniously unite; Divine conviction, with Orphean skill, Subdue to milder ends the savage will; Each weed extirpate from the mental mould, And a fresh growth of fairer bloom unfold. Thou, too, dejected vestal! doom'd to find, For thy pure train, no habitation kind; Thou, like the weary dove, who long hast flown O'er a vile world, immerg'd in vices of its own; Religion! thou shouldst view, with glad surprise, Thy temples o'er the impious deluge rise, And flooding Infidelity retreat Before the pressure of thy sainted feet! Vainly, would human arrogance deny, The pow'rs that in thy dread commission lie; Vainly, would his prepost'rous dream advance To heaven's high seat the anarchy of chance; And print upon the yielding heart of youth, The poet's fiction, not th' apostle's truth, Rude health impair'd, this idle mock'ry fled, When sickness plants with thorns his burning bed, When conscience self her gorgon-mirror rears, And shakes her snaky scourge, and slights his tears, Where shall the God-abandon'd look for ease, Who laugh'd, so Intely, at his just decrees? Where, but to that exulting fiend, whose praise He toil'd to celebrate in happier days. Oh, Faith! oh, spotless Piety! awhile Retard your flight from our deluded isle! Yet, will its children learn your holy law; Yet, hear your melting lore, with contrite awe; Yet, spurn the miscreant-tribe, who madly stain With error's dust your angel-guarded fane; Redress your martyrs, who in silence grieve, And bid the nations tremble, and believe! The time is near, (by prophecy imprest, The big idea bursts my lab'ring breast!) When baffled factions shall, at length, subside, And rigid virtue be our surer guide; Rough industry, with honest hardship brown, Shall, in domestic quiet, lay him down, In simple charms, and decent plenty blest, Light slumbers shall o'ershade his nightly rest, Of spirit blithe, and vig'rous with repose, Content attend him as to toil he goes, And transport, fled from palace-down, adorn The blushful beauties of each welcome morn. Intent, from history's prolific page, To cull the sweets of each immortal sage, Far from presuming Folly's painful glare, Shall Learning trim his lamp, with pensive care, Concentrate ev'ry beam of thought refin'd, And pour meridian lustre on the mind. The reptile-race of dulness, that devour The freshest blossoms of the muse's bow'r, Whose venom'd rancour has so long defac'd Th' untainted trophies of impartial taste, As smote, Ithuriel! by thy lightning spear, Shall shrink, and hide the guilty head in fear: The muse herself, in such divine array, As when she purg'd her Milton's visual ray, Or, with the glorious visitation warm, To Avon's bard reveal'd her awful form, And, proud her utmost favors to impart, Unlock'd the secret sluices of the heart, A more exalted portance shall assume, And in Britannia raise another Rome. No dauntless chief shall then expire in vain, Prescrved by the imperishable strain; No statesman then, without a song sincere, The cumb'rous burthen of a country bear; The stately epic shall prolong his praise, Borne on the tide of time to distant days, And future states confess his wisdom, crown'd With all the magic of melodious sound. No more, to merit ignorantly blind, Shall pomp, in solemn secrecy enshrin'd, Bestow on flatt'ry the misjudging ear, While unregarded worth stands shiv'ring near Those, whose superior talents boldly claim Respectful homage to a noble name; Who look'd on fortune with unalter'd eye, Prompt, or to greatly live, or bravely die; Or, by some grand emprize, aspir'd above All meaner toys to universal love; Corruption chaining to its loathsome den, Shall triumph in desert, and feel as men! Approving Britain, steady to confide In truth, so often by her fathers tried, When shrinking the pale crest from circling foes, Her languid lilly woo'd the hardier rose, And, emulative touch'd with gen'rous shame, Shall fan true Freedom's undiminish'd flame; And weigh'd impartial in her golden scales, O'er lordly pow'r the peasant's plea prevails; All legal labyrinths of dull delay, Develop'd to the candid eye of day; Themis, from heav'n descending, shall behold A George's virtues grace an age of gold. ALCANDER. A MONODY ON DR. FRANKLIN. And art thou fall'n from thy majestic height, Bold bird of Jove? the lightning of thine eye Wont to pursue the rebels of the sky, Extinct—and all thy former vigour gone, In such a space! Lamented patriot, say, Is thy full sun of glory clos'd in night? Has death extinguish'd ev'ry genuine ray, Erst beaming from thy breast, truth's spotless throne? Ah, me! how short mortality's sad reign, How short our durance in life's vile abode! When fate commands, all terrine ties, how vain, Vain the calm sceptre or tyrannic rod! Equality unfolds her russet pall, With portion just, o'er all; And dull oblivion mars the pageant dream! Quaint scutcheons, high wrought tombs are seen, Low as the humble shepherd's hillock green, And o'er that hillock green, as pure tears stream And sighs as fervent heave, As o'er the classic urn, or civic grave? But o'er the classic urn, the civic grave, Shall nations bid no laureate honors wave; Say, shall a Moira sink without a name, A Milton seek the shade unken'd by partial fame? Lo! from Parnassian dell the Muses come, And Fancy, fair, her temples bound With flow'rets, cull'd from ev'ry plain around Each verdant stalk, or bell, Dank with Castalian dews, and dipt in loveliest bloom? Struck by her wand, in mystic guise Ten thousand sprites arise Obedient to the spell! In bright array th' aërial squadrons throng; Honour, her eye-ball fix'd in ardent gaze On Truth's eternal blaze— Freedom, with helm of fiery hue, Her front with many a starry gem Illum'd, like that rich diadem That flames a meteor o'er the heav'nly plain, And draws behind a long and glitt'ring train. And prudence too, Like palmer old yclad, with wrinkled brow, And silver'd locks, the long-drawn troop doth join; Though eld has feebled his weak tott'ring frame, And public cares to craze his head combine, And frigid thoughts earth-born, confound his schemes divine. Now from the rest th' immortal queen appears! To her these winged minstrels bow, And to their lyres accord the lofty song, That gives some chosen son to fame. Virtue, th' immortal queen, well-pleas'd, commends Their high heroic theme, their sounding harp Meet, or for Doric reed, or Spartan fife! And o'er each bard with fond attention bends. No sound offends the ear, of discord sharp, No tone, express of inharmonic strife; But cease—th' immortal queen, with humid eye, And paly cheek, signs of excessive woe, Draws from her aching breast one matchless sigh, Bids from her lid one tear ambrosian flow, And cries— “Thou, last and best executor Of all my grand behests! thou, faithful slave Of heav'n, to nothing less than heav'n a slave, Accept this off'ring from a hand divine. Lo! in this crown I've braided flow'rs more sweet Than amaranth, more lasting too, and more Tenacious of their fragrance; modesty, Small gem, that like the violet, eschews The garish day, yet glads the lonely vale With unbought odours; Wisdom, charg'd with sweets, But guarded by a speary throng of thorns, To touch profane offensive; Fortitude That rears his red crest in the glare of noon, Ambitious of the blaze from Phœbus' car Glanc'd on his bosom; Truth, too, decks thy choice Like the pale snowdrop clad in kindred white, Her heart much whiter. But to excel them all, Here's Piety, obscur'd by modest veil, To all the rest, a tint more soft'ning lends, Sombre not sad—Such is the crown of virtue, And such the meed Alcander's worth deserves.” ODE TO DESCRIPTION. NYMPH of the vari-colour'd bow, That arch'd with a majestic show, Girts the cloudy tinctur'd sky, And charms the frenzy-rolling eye Of raptur'd bard, who sees thee ride The flaunting steed with graceful pride, And down the heav'n's cerulean steep Descending fall, with liquid sweep, 'Till Phœbus' orient car appears, And all thy glory melts in tears. Gay nymph, my verdant cottage view, Where snow-drops dwell, and vi'lets blue, And woodbine creeps with scented flow'r, And sweet-bri'r decks the humble door, And op'ning on the well-pleas'd eye, The black-wreath'd mountains prop the sky; And fairies haunt the twilight green, And spirits run in shrowded sheen, To prompt the raven's dirge of woe, Or walk their destin'd round below; And thou shalt hear at dappled morn The crested cock with clarion-horn, But chief the blackbird's shall relieve Thy grief, when dewy-sandal'd eve Meekly sheds a sober ray, And spreads her robe of motley-gray Along the sky, with matron-grace, Till Hesper comes with glowing face; But soon his glitt'ring race is run, Faint rival of the mighty sun! Then let me hear thy whisper'd tale, Embower'd among the shady vale, Of heroes old, and days of yore; Which Eld, with locks of silv'ry hoar, Told thee, when yet an infant young Faint lispings falter'd on thy tongue, Of learned lore, which sons of Fame Produc'd, to raise the Grecian name On lofty song of ancient time, Or annals quaint of deed sublime, Which Jason, by the wizzard aid Of Colchic spells, and potent maid, Achiev'd; how stubborn Ilion fell, And Trojan warriors sunk to hell. Thy light heel on my sod imprint, And pencil out, in heav'nly tint, The joys that rose-crown'd Pleasure shows, Or oh! pourtray the wretch's woes, When comfort cheers with no relief The sombre scenery of his grief, And fell Despair o'ercast the eye, Reverted humbly to the sky. Now wrap me in the whirlwind's gloom, And snatch me to the moss-grown tomb, Where many a widow'd tear was shed, Where many an orphan laid his head, To dream of all his formor joy, When the fond father bless'd his boy, And squeez'd the infant to his breast To soothe his little soul to rest; Or, when he came from daily care, With them his well-earn'd hire to share, Their breast with virtue to inform, And shield them from the wint'ry storm. O! whirl me from the garish day, And let me scenes like those survey; Or, mounted in thy rapid car, Hurry me to the ranks of war, Where Death prolongs the warrior-groan, And Discord, in the cannon's tone, Proclaims her own horrific will, And thunders loudly “Heroes, kill!” But now the chief, in tortures grim, Writhes every agonizing limb; Faint shadows swim before his sight, And murder ends the bloody fight. Now Melancholy, silent, slow, Each pulse quick-beating to my woe, Ah! waft me to the sickly bed, Where lies the prudent father dead, And all his sons! a mournful train, Of doom untimely fix'd complain, And weeping, seem with plaintive cry To catch new sorrows from her eye Who nurs'd their infant years, and now Perceive no pause of ling'ring woe! Or to the cloister's ivy'd wall, Where sighing to the fountain's fall, The maniac weeps, unhappy maid, And calls her dear Alcander's shade; And wrings her hand with frantic woe, And sighs, that he should leave her so; Then sweetly sings her love-lorn song, While Nature wild attunes her tongue To sweetest themes of proffer'd love, And wishes in the conscious grove; But soon her blessings fade away, Again she tunes the dol'rous lay, And bursts her breast, with many a sigh, Beneath the moon's lack-lustre eye. Now lap me in the wild of pleasure, While I taste each lurking treasure Of syren Cyrce's cup divine, And smile as rosy as the wine, That purply dances in the glass Proffer'd by Hebe, blooming lass, Whose tresses, interwove with show'rs Of lilies, and all roseate flow'rs, Steal the raptur'd soul of Jove, And string the bow of sportive Love, To pierce his awful bosom through, And make him court, in public view; While sliding down the cloudy vault, Entic'd by some delicious thought, He clothes himself in down of dove, And leaves the golden throne above, Forgetting quite the thund'ring Jove, And revels in the fair-one's breast; And raptur'd in ecstatic rest, Devours the tempting feast of joy, While Cytherea's winged boy Mimics the gold, and in his heart Fixes swift another dart, Then sets him on some alien scheme, To satisfy her am'rous flame; While scepter'd Juno raves above, To find out her gallanting Jove. But oh! let not the jocund Muse, Ever recite the talk of shrews; But panting, trembling, sighing, wooing, Never mind what they are doing. Goddess, on thy way sublime Waft me to the Indian clime, Where the slaves, with labour faint, O'er the fervid furrows pant, And fearful of the master's eye, Smother soft the rising sigh, That weeps, the toil of day undone, And fury of the scorching sun; That lifts aloft his burning crest, And the hot buckler on his breast, That fires the kindling world around, And scathes the sky, a fiery mound! O! let me join their bitter woe, My tears with pangs congenial flow, And while I raise the angry strain, Curse their fell tyrant's galling chain, That lording o'er his helpless train, Sinks the slave below the man! Now, now, quick frenzy fires my eye, I see the gory murd'rer die; He wallows in the crimson flood Of wife and children's steaming blood; And now by furies stern possest, He stabs the dagger in his breast; His grim frown seems to threat the sky, And madness flashes from his eye— But now how calm the angry frown That call'd avenging lightnings down; He sees bright cherubs rang'd around Start upward at the grizzly wound, And leave his soul, depress'd with care, To feel the pangs of wild despair; To fathom deep th' abyss of night, And plunge the realms devoid of light, Save the blue sulphur's glimm'ring gleam, Tortur'd by many a demon's scream, He wails the knell, in slaughter dy'd, And the stern frown of suicide. To castled cliffs and antres vast, Cavern'd in the rocky waste, My footsteps lead; where Spenser trod, Or Milton woo'd th' inspiring god; There let me tune exalted lays To bards divine of former days, And, dress'd in all thy varying hues, Invoke thee, goddess, for my muse, To wing my soaring soul above, And rival with the bird of Jove In lofty flight, and frame my song The lucid-beaming stars among; While minding sweet my mortal cars, I catch the music of the spheres; And, like Prometheus bold, reveal To wond'ring earth the fire I feel, Inspiring in my tuneful soul Contempt of ev'ry mean controul, That blames sweet Fiction's fairy song, Or calls Description's heighten'd beauties wrong. INVENTION. A DESCRIPTIVE ODE. Now faintly beaming on her lucid throne, The moon, pale regent of the sky, Her silvery sceptre sways on high, While Silence, smoth'ring ev'ry sound Unfit to hail her matron-ear, Save the lone turtle's solitary moan, That makes her awful pause more drear, And keeps the list'ning sense in stilness bound, Her ermine curtain gently draws around: Till mounted on the scowling blast, Anon the midnight demons rave, And hurling in the iron air, Come the fleet bands of wild Despair; And Ruin, tumbled on the rocking wave, And Conscience' haggard form with bleeding bosom bare. Aghast the guilty murd'rer stands, And wrings his blood-polluted hands; The orphan meets his bloodshot eye; His ear is tortur'd with the widow'd sigh; And oft, amidst his moon-struck ire, Fiend Agony, with cheek on fire, And Blasphemy, with icy frown, And pale-ey'd Sorrow, mix the long-continuing groan; While Night, by staring Fear astounded driv'n, Impels her dun steeds up the steep of Heav'n. Then, Muse, who often fir'd my breast With song beyond my infant age, Now greatly swell thy tuneful rage, And more sublimely tell the rest. For thou hast often rang'd the wild, With Inspiration, Fancy's child, And heard her seraph-chorded lyre: While thy heart swell'd with purer fire, Oft hast thou seen her on the bank, With hoary willows fring'd around, Her tresses brown with dewy frag'rance dank, Sweetly excite the pensive-pleasing sound; While all their chrystal caves among, The sedge-crown'd sisters of the rill, Re-echoed bland thy rural song; And ev'ry liquid air in lovelier thrill, And heav'n-rapt Genius too, on yonder hill, His starry head imbost in clouds, Would give the harp a deeper fall; And Melancholy wan, that shrouds Her moping head in fun'ral pall, At dewy-sandal'd Morning's peep, Charm'd with the soft flow of her mellow'd pipe, In melting music ripe; Would often lap herself in raptur'd sleep, Till, haply waken'd by the Oread's call, Or the rude noise abrupt of yon loud-tott'ring wall; While thus exalted by their aid, A more than mortal lustre blaz'd around her head. Seldom the reas'ning pow'r would come, Lorn maid, to raise thy soaring sense; Yet Goodness, void of weak pretence, And cowl'd in no scholastic gloom, Would often bless thy humble cell, And love with thee, fond Muse, to dwell: And Gratitude, celestial sprite, Conversant in the laws above, Would gently clear thy mental sight, And ope the tome of feeling love; Or lead thy ravish'd eye afar, To pierce th' unfolding world of grace, And, fir'd with emulation, trace The glowing journey of the prophet's car; Or with thy Milton's shade converse In heav'nly number'd verse; With him commune, while ev'ry angel hung, On ev'ry word, and bless'd his mending tongue. And Michael rear'd his burning crest, And felt more noble courage fill his breast, When Milton told his heav'n-directed march, Of angels scaling the celestial arch, And Satan shudd'ring at his grim abode, Hurl'd flaming to the deep by his victorious God. Such was thy choice; but varying soon, Thou rov'st along the cypress'd shade, Charm'd with thy Della Crusca's song, Or love-lorn Anna's sweeter boon, To grief and thee! while weeping long, You sympathiz'd with ev'ry care That poignant thrill'd the faithful pair; And willing to reward their love, For him you robb'd the laureate grove, And twin'd the myrtle for the charming maid. Ah! may thy chaplets never fade But o'er the lovers mutual grave, The laurel-spray and blooming myrtle wave. But too digressive Muse, begin the lay, And young Invention's magic birth display. 'Twas by Illyssus' verdant stream, Where Plato, sage, would often rove The shades of oliv'd Academe, And seek hoar Wisdom's learned grove; Blithe Phœbus, free from ev'ry care, Met Fancy, the ecstatic fair, Her bosom's downy swell compress'd— The joyful woodlands told the rest; For all the nymphs and muses came To hail the god and matron dame; And Hymen too, with lucid torch, Enter'd in joy the hallow'd porch; And as he came, with lovelier hue The rose-bud bloom'd, and vi'let blue; The sweetbriar loads the fragrant wind, And round the oak the ivy twin'd With greener clasp, and closer arms— Sweet emblem of the owner's charms! But far estrang'd was ev'ry strife, No clarion hoarse, no martial fife, Floated the strident gale along; No artful sound of grating song; The tortuous horn, the silver lyre, The liquid nymphs, the heav'nly choir, The wooing of the am'rous air, The ring-dove's plaintive pipe was there; And ev'n the master, mad with joy, With music hail'd his darling boy. Invention, when of tender age, Would love his mother's various page, And kindling with her native lore Rove along the whiten'd shore; And oft, at deep of gloomy night, Would watch pale Cynthia's sparkling light, Dancing o'er the liquid way, And scatter'd round in many a ray. Or when his father's steeds would lave Their burning hoofs in ocean's wave, Would make their radiance fade away, And Ev'ning, clad in palmer's gray, Submit to Cynthia's car behind, And solemnize the moaning wind! Then would the youth attempt to climb The cloud-capt mountain's swell sublime, And view the black-brow'd clouds above, Or trace the sable bird of Jove, Where brooding Night's departed gloom Was open'd by the low'ring plume; Then would he lay his infant head On the slop'd mountain's rocky bed. Hark to the torrent's cavern'd roar, Or the wind blust'ring on the shore, Or the sprite's sullen skriek below, Or the calm sigh of gentler woe: Oft would he think, in wizzard dream, He saw the Genius of the stream, Whose eddying waters play on high, And spread with mists the sable sky, Borne by his own mad surge adown, From the rough mountain's crested crown, Till shricking in his moody woe, He plunges in the gulph below. Oft would he seek the charnel gloom, And dew the hapless lover's tomb, Who, robb'd of ev'ry kind relief, In wild extravagance of grief, Impell'd, alas! by stern despair, And the harsh treatment of the fair, Plung'd the fell dagger in his breast; Yet there, alas! he finds no rest; His sad ghost walks his pensive round, And feels his sorrow has no bound! But then his mother leads the boy To scenes of pleasure, shades of joy; To verdant meadows, gay alcoves, And plains the tender poet loves; But verdant meadows, gay alcoves, Nor plains the tender poet loves, Could give his heart such joy sincere As the soft sigh, and stealing tear. From these, Invention oft would stray To abbies hoar, and castles gray, Where Superstition justly bled, Or banners wav'd o'er warriors dead; Here would he loiter, here would find The noblest sympathy of mind; Here, where the shades of widows mourn, Bind the pale ozier o'er the sacred urn: But when to riper years he grew, His soul confess'd a nobler flame; Sage Newton well his influence knew, And he with Inspiration came, To lead the step of sapient Locke to fame. Sweet Mulla's bard, with fancy fraught, Caught native spirit from his pow'r, Lapt in Imagination's fairy bow'r, And mighty Milton pierc'd the vast sublime of thought. Then let the sons of Britain try Invention's vary'd field again, While Judgment lifts the genius high, And Fancy paints, with piercing eye, A new creation in her wond'rous reign! Oh! may we learn sublimer lays, Nor rob the ancient author's bays: May Imitation's servile chain, Confine the free-born soul in vain, And native Liberty no more depart, But fire the poet's thought, or warm the patriot's heart. TO THE MEMORY OF SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. Parent of sorrow, Melancholy pale, And Pity, withering in thy vestal bloom, And musing sage, with sullen eye, And all the rainbow vested pow'rs that ply Th' ethereal pencil on the cloud of morn, Languid, oppress'd, forlorn, Forth from your dim, mysterious mansions come, And o'er yon holy tomb, Where the dead sparks of awful genius lie, Pour the full tear of woe, and heave th' emphatic sigh! They come—lo! Melancholy pale, And Pity, with'ring in her vestal bloom, And musing sage, with sullen eye, And all the rainbow-vested pow'rs that ply Th' ethereal pencil on the clouds of morn, Lament their second Titian's doom, And, plucking from each bud the latent thorn, Ambrosian garlands weave, and look, and pause, and mourn. In Palmer's weeds; hoar Judgment joins their train, His manly visage, amiably mild, Leading young Fancy, his enchanting child, Whose little fingers bind Each blushing native of the fruitful wild, The lily pale, the vi'let blue, The pansy drooping with distemper'd hue; The willow trembling on the quer'lous wave; Those the sportive infant flings, Meanwhile she sings Some effort of the pure poetic mind, And hangs with lasting verse th' immortal painter's grave. Thronging through the twilight shade, Venerable forms are seen, Of warriors, patriots, poets, whose brave deeds He on the swelling page pourtray'd, O'er which, ev'n yet, heroic ardor bleeds! But Judgment forward moves, weeping, he pours The notes of melting sorrow, oft his eye Turn'd in meek anguish to the cruel sky, He speaks! “All hail, in thy Elysian bow'rs, Seraphic stranger, may the harps of heaven, Most musical, thy solemn entry sound, For thou couldst best celestial fire impart, And with thy colours blend the spark of life; Whether, triumphant from the glorious field, The gallant soldier claim'd thy grace divine; Or statesman, steady in his country's cause, Thy vivid tint, thy animating touch Gave lustre to each act; vile envy pined, And Nature fondly lingered o'er thy piece; Not Titian's kindling hues, or Guido's air So exquisitely fine, nor Rosa's force Romantically charming, nor the son Of painting, Angelo, could snatch one leaf From thy acknowledged laurels! Heav'n, how glows, Correctly chaste, enchantingly combin'd, Thy figur'd likeness, see! the rosy cheek, The modest front ingenuous, the lip Breathing delicious love, the sparkling eye In humid radiance rolling, the smooth chin Dimpled, the bosom, through its gauzy veil Panting, and ev'n from continence himself The stolen glance extorting! Beauty's own blush Illumes! what angel, from his sapphire seat, Descended, to unite the magic tints, To give Promethean vigour to thy hand, And rifle all the stores of varying light! Master of the potent art, To fix the sight, to charm the heart, To bid the distant scene return, The sympathetic bosom burn? While to thy canvas looks th' enamour'd youth, Sadly he thinks upon her charming face, Which wore the smile of innocence and truth, Which won with love's inimitable grace; Thy hand her fleeting beauties drew, The shadow flourish'd, though the substance flew! Nor was thy genius that which rais'd thy name, Fame crown'd thee high whilst thou didst shrink from fame; Thine was unbroken friendship's link divine, Honour unblam'd, and gen'rous bounty thine; The fervent tear that pity bade to flow, The feeling breast that bled at alien woe; The simple worth, relieving, as by stealth, The scorn of title, and the scorn of wealth, Proclaim'd thy heart on heav'n's sublimest plan, And even the artist sunk beneath the man! Witness, poor Goldsmith, by thy favour rais'd, At once rewarded, comforted, and prais'd; Witness his grateful spirit, hov'ring here To greet thy coming with a tender tear. Sweet bard of auburn! lift thy pensive head, Thine hours of grief are gone—on this blest shore Aye shalt thou soothe thy friend with genuine lore, United living, and united dead! What mien majestic hurries through the shade, In all the pomp of excellence array'd, Flashes his bright eye through the gleam around, And hark! shrill fairy measures sound, 'Tis Garrick—followed by his Shakspeare's train, Garrick, who, thy admirable draught, Seems more than mortal, as a marvel left For noble souls to startle at, below. Peace to thy manes! Virtue's lip, on earth Thy praise shall breathe, and Time, his ruthless scythe Lay by, astonish'd at thy wond'rous works!” EPIGRAMS. Dulce, et decorum pro patriâ mori.

Say, gentle vermin, art thou smit With curious love of classic wit? Else, why so slily creep along, Enamour'd, nibbling sacred song; Else why in poet's trunk intrude, Where nought remains but tuneful food: If oh! perchance, in thy small size, (Tremendous foe!) some critic lies; John Dennis, once of voice supreme, Now dwindled to a sweeter scream, If so, forbear the charming prey, Critic, or mouse, away! away!

The fearless saint, inviolably chaste, Bold trial! o'er the burning ploughshare past: When the red torture kiss'd her hallow'd heel, The fire, and not the foot, then learn'd to feel. J. SCALIGER'S EPIGRAM On the sonnets of Petrarch. IMITATED. Petrarch! how bright a flame illum'd thy breast! Unrival'd wit in smoothest numbers drest. Nor the sweet Muse, nor yet the maid belov'd, Were coy, but both alike thy suit approv'd; Methinks, while I peruse the charming strain, Apollo wooes his Daphne o'er again. To number, to add, or to multiply more, Old miser avails not in thy sad contrition; To give thee some zest with thy ill-gotten store, Then pri'thee, lean penitent, learn division. SONG. Pretty one, on thy soft lip grows A pearl, like dew-drop on the rose; Let me then, like the sun's bright ray, Exhale the honey'd drop away. Pensive one, say, why weeps thine eye, Streaming like an ev'ning sky, Which, like the gentle moon, should move, Lighting to ecstacy and love! Cruel one, thou hast kill'd my heart, Beyond the cunning'st leech's art; Panting long time, at last, at last Its foolish strugglings quickly past; Gentle one, thou, perchance, complain Because the tender thing is slain; If so, and thou dost wish to save, Smile, and redeem it from the grave. BALLAD, Imitated from the Spanish of Cervantes. Kind Guardian! if you will, you may With bolts, and bars, oppose my way; In ev'ry nook set guards, and spies, To watch me with their Argus-eyes; But if my heart is fixed on flight, You may as well wish me good night. By sages shrewd it has been said, 'Tis wond'rous hard to hold a maid; And Love, all furious when confin'd, But fiercer fires the stubborn mind; 'Tis better then, since force is vain, To turn the lock, and loose the chain; For if my heart is fix'd on flight, You may as well wish me good night. If sov'reign will commands to go, What fool will face so rash a foe? 'Twill strike ev'n wakeful caution blind, And through death's self a passage find; Unheard-of means shall straight remove All bars that hinder woman's love; So if my heart is fix'd on flight, You may as well wish me good night. As flies, though sure to scorch their frame, Will wanton through the taper's flame; So love all danger will despise, Resistless rushing to its prize; Then if my mind is fix'd on flight, You may as well wish me good night. When I my purpose chuse to keep, Severity, alas! may sleep: A lover's palm, like wax, is warm, 'Tis melting warm; his wish is fire; No obstacles his patience tire; But head will plot, and hand perform; His eyes can talk; his careful feet Are silence-shod, your ears to cheat; And as my mind is fix'd on flight, You may as well wish me good night. TO THE EVENING STAR. Soft star! approaching slowly on the sky With solemn march, if e'er beneath thy beam, Darkling, I heav'd the deep-impassion'd sigh, Or bade the silent tear of feeling stream; If e'er, with fancy's magic voice, I call'd Ten thousand sprites to tend thy sapphire car, If e'er by rushing darkness unappall'd, I follow'd thy receding light afar; Be gracious, now:—to this love-labour'd bow'r With thy bright clue conduct my promis'd fair, Full on her face thy yellow radiance pour, And gild the flowing tissue of her hair; So shall the nightingale, her note prolong, Wild-warbling to thine ear our bridal-song! TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE FRANCIS, EARL OF MOIRA, &amp;c. To the munificence of this amiable and accomplished nobleman the author is indebted for more unaltered favour, than can be repaid by the trifling effusions of poetical fancy. How many with'ring years of dull despair, Have o'er my fated front relentless roll'd, Since first, beneath a Moira's partial care, My happier moments wav'd their wings of gold! Ah me! and must I never more behold The glorious orb of day in gladness rise? No more salute, with rapture-beaming eyes, The glimmering star that shuts the shepherd's fold? No more! if led not by thy lenient hand, To the lone hermitage of learned case, Where pensive joy may tenderly expand His blooms, sore-shatter'd by the blighting breeze; And a new, mental Eden, by degrees, Bud forth, best patron! at thy soft command! TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOHN HILY ADDINGTON. A swain, within whose native vale alone, Ere this blest time, was heard his simple reed, Ambitious now, of glory's dazzling meed, Essays the lofty lyre's majestic tone; Feeling, perchance, nor Fancy, yet are fled, Nor lost the charms that from their influence spring: For those celestial forms were wont to fling, Their faery visions o'er my youthful head; But where amid Expression's copious store, For raptur'd thought fit diction may I find? How dress th' exuberance of my grateful mind, In chaste, though glowing terms, untried before? Patron and pride! o'er my unvarying cheek, No blush for servile flatt'ry shall arise; Yet ah! while timid doubts, in vain, disguise The modest soul,—let meaning Silence speak: Thou canst not, surely, Atticus! refuse That poor, frail tribute of th' indebted Muse! A FRAGMENT. The shadowy semblance, lo! is past!— Loudly yells the midnight blast, And, hark! the death-bell's sullen toll Strikes upon my shrinking soul! Whither, whither am I led? “To the drear caverns of the dead. Here with murder shalt thou dwell; Mark yon bleeding phantom well: Know you not the wound you gave, You was bloody, he was brave; In the dark you dealt the blow, With a hatchet fell'd him low, His cleft head distended wide, Hideous hangs upon each side. Why dost thou enwrithing start, 'Gainst thy ribs why knocks thy heart? Why, to the taper's glimmering blue, Gleams thy front with clammy dew? Welcome to his cell below, Thou with thy murder'd host must go!” Mercy, Mercy, do not clasp My frame in such a frozen grasp; Fibres from my heart yon tear, Loose me, loose me, spectre drear; Oh! ten thousand fathoms deep I behold a vap'ry steep, Wild with ecstacy of pain, Madness rushes on my brain, Round and round my senses tost, Now I tumble—I am lost. WRITTEN IN A BURIAL PLACE. Ah me! and must I, like the tenant lie Of this dark cell, all hush'd the witching song, And will not Feeling bend his streaming eye On my green sod, as slow he wends along, And, smiting his rapt bosom, softly sigh, “His genius soar'd above the vulgar throng!” Will he not fence my weedless turf around, Sacred from dull-ey'd Folly's vagrant feet, And there, soft-swelling in aerial sound, Will he not list, at eve, to voices sweet, Strew with the spring's first flow'rs the little mound, And often muse within the lone retreat! Yes;—though I not affect th' immortal bay, Nor bold effusions of the learned quill, Nor often have I wound my tedious way Up the steep summit of the Muse's hill, Yet sometimes have I pour'd th' incondite lay, And sometimes have I felt the rapt'rous thrill; Him therefore, whom ev'n once, the sacred Muse Has blest, shall be to feeling ever dear, And soft as sweet sad April's gleamy dews, On my cold clay shall fall the genial tear, While pensive as the springing herb he views, He cries, “Though mute, there is a poet here!” TO MY CAT. For that thou, once, didst lend a poet aid, And from the green lamp of thy glaring eye, Didst to divine Torquato Tasso, of whom this tradition is recorded. light supply, When penury around diffus'd her shade, Illustrious shalt thou live in lofty song; Full well dost thou deserve immortal praise, Whose influence beam'd on such delightful lays; Go, then, and soar above the vulgar throng, And close to Virgo shine, a feline star! And as the rolling spheres shall turn around, Still sweetly purr to the ecstatic sound, By astronomic sages ken'd afar; Though, darkling, pregnant with poetic dream, Ah! never may I need thy virid gleam! ODE TO NECESSITY. Why persecutest thou me, Saul? “Necessity, thou mother of Invention, (Which proverb comes, I own, quite smooth in rhime,) Firing full many a rogue to claim a pension, And o'er the rugged alps of Satire climb, Forcing with goose-quill stabs, and tuneful curses, The mighty men to stand, and lend their purses; Why stick thus bur-like to the minstrel-crew, So harmless, meek, and such damn'd bankrupts too? All worth in this here place below is us'd Worse than a pickpocket, knock'd down, abus'd By every strutting blackguard Major Sturgeon, And thou attendest him by way of surgeon. Folly, dull dog, is fat, and sprucely drest, And holds of surly Wealth the golden keys; While Wit, poor, merry fellow, nought surveys, But mice and mangled lyrics in his chest: Of Fate's dark law so cruel is the letter! Yet Conscience whispers, “all is for the better.” Insensibility, eye-frozen knave, Who grins and roars at tragedies so grave, Who never knew the gentle pang of pity, Has several times been lord-may'r of the city; While Feeling, whose sad tears for ever thawing, Wept on pale bleeding forms of his own drawing, Fell to those exquisite sensations martyr, Found one cold morning dangling in his garter! This, dame, is curs'd provoking; all the toil Of Genius, or of Virtue, can't provide Faggots to make the pot of Plenty boil; While that ungracious bravo, swagg'ring Pride, Turns up the nose of scorn, and full of whim, Swears “the whole little world was made for him.” This management would set old Plato mad, Now, by my soul, 'tis really too bad. TO ANTHEMOE. There lurks within thy lyre a dang'rous spell, That lures my soul from Wisdom's dauntless aim; Yet, if I know thy gen'rous bosom well, Thou wouldst not dash me from the steeps of Fame. Trust me, thy melting plaint's melodious flow, Would animate to love the icy grave: And yet, if thy pure feelings well I know, Thou would'st not sink me to an am'rous slave. Grac'd with no ornaments of birth, or wealth, That to the minions of Success belong, Ev'n at the price of my sole treasure, health, I own that I would be renown'd for song! For this, by the pale taper's trembling ray, My paler front presents a studious shade; In whose dim eye, Mirth's sprightly sparks decay; On whose brown cheek Youth's vernal blushes fade; For this, I wander from the world aside, Mutt'ring wild descants to the toiling deep, 'Mid the lone forest's leafy refuge hide, And slight the blessings of inactive sleep. Serene, while tempesting the sparkling brine, The furious winds from ev'ry quarter roar, Led by Philosophy's unclouded shine, I seek Hope's watch-tow'r on a distant shore. Nor measur'd dance, nor gay theatric scene, Nor woman's smile, my sterner sense invite; Though Beauty too, at times, will steal between, And my heart vibrate with no mean delight; Soft-smiling o'er the dreary wreck of Time, When my Anthemoe's semblance I behold, Fix'd by the Muse's magic pow'r, sublime, Her eye's blue languish, and her locks of gold! Then, then, with my creative fancy fir'd, Pygmalion-like, I fold the idol-form, By ages yet unborn to be admir'd, Beyond the sweep of Desolation's storm! Feel'st thou not too, the elevated thought? Those lesser stars whose transient lights adorn Their twinkling spheres, ah! where shall they be sought, When bursts the brightness of thy future morn? Then freely scatter from thy balmy breast What Feeling may receive, or Friendship give; And, (spare a vaunt which would befit thee best,) That thou may'st be immortal, let me live. TO MY MUSE. Well, after all our quarrels, strifes, and squabble, And though full oft I've curs'd thy tuneful gabble, I cannot say, sweet slut, I quite abhor ye— Methinks I have a sneaking kindness for ye. Nor can I quite forget the bliss-wing'd hours We spent of yore, collecting wild hedge-flow'rs Of varied light and shade, what time the dawn Fair child, in purple vapours swath'd, appear'd, The sullen face of ancient Darkness cheer'd, And flung his short beams o'er the glimm'ring lawn, Till father Sol unclos'd his radiant eye, Took Thetis' parting kiss, and scal'd the sky, Then peeping through thick mists, dispers'd all sorrow, And bade his early bard, the lark, good-morrow. Yes, you were youthful then, and gay, and airy, Light as an Oread, a beauteous fairy, Leading me mad o'er park-gate, hedge, and ditches, Nor car'd three farthings tho' I tore my breeches! Oft would the plum'd choir, twitt'ring from the shade, Prate to lone Echo, in her winding shell, Their loves and fears, and sportive pastimes tell, Swelling the slender pipe till thou hast sung, And all in breathless silence charmed hung. Ev'n Zephyr furl'd his filmy plume with care, Floating before, in rude and reckless flight, Now on the soft breast of his gentle air Fix'd pendulous, and still as musing night. Charms you once had, and these most rapturous too Ere envious Woe, and sour Misfortune scowl'd; Ere the loud blast of dismal Horror howl'd Round my sad front, nor could unripen'd age, And guiltless song, the felon fiends assuage. Now metamorphos'd to a scolding shrew, All thy lov'd beauties lose their former force, And much am I advis'd to sue For a poetical divorce; But, hang it, 'tis too late to shut the stable, We must even drudge as well as we are able. FRIENDSHIP. Donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos. Ovid. In sonnet trim, and ditty quaint, I've often read the trite complaint, That truth, search all the nation round, Untainted truth, will scarce be found; Yet trust me, which I wot you will, I know a shyer stranger still. Let Bow-street send her myriads forth, From east to west, from south to north; “Cry havoc!” and, inspiring awe, Let slip the hungry dogs of law; Direct, at once, on diff'rent journeys, Bums, setters, runners, spies, attorneys; Keep Townshend in perpetual hire, With catchpoles, and “chimæras dire;” 'Fore heav'n, in vain will be their trouble, This bilk will give them all the double, And though they're often in “view hollow,” 'Tis merely loss of time to follow. Come, bend thy serious brow, and furl Thy front's most formidable curl, Excogitate, perpend, unloose The myst'ry of this gordian noose, Break its inextricable links, And solve this riddle for a sphynx? What, Master Ædipus, you're hamper'd, Your syllogistic schemes have scamper'd, You've scann'd old Euclid, and the schoolmen, Grave whisker'd charlatans that fool men, Yet cannot answer this plain question:— Well, as 'tis tough for your digestion, And may your puzzled wits endanger, 'Tis Friendship is this wond'rous stranger. Friendship, soft cement of the soul, Clear flame, above all base control, Whose light can shed a radiance pure Through Sorrow's palpable obscure, Though much of thee is sung and spoken, Frail ware! how often art thou broken! Friendship! in life's conflicting storm, Where may we grasp thy fleeting form? How oft, sublime on borrow'd plume, Does Int'rest vile thy shape assume? How often, pompously bely'd, Art thou the vaunting puff of Pride? Nay, Av'rice self, unfeeling crone, Not seldom takes thy honey'd tone; But should Misfortune once torment us, Then thou'rt a mere—Non est inventus. This, now, to prove in mode most ample, Take me, myself, then—par exemple. When late, enforc'd by powerful spell, I visited the debtor's hell, And did, though earthly-born presume, Into dread Hades' central gloom; Ah me! where no Orphean squeak Drew iron tears down jailor's cheek; When, so unluckily he tript, Pegasus' wings were fairly clipt: His tail, too, batter'd to a stump, Nay, scarce a hair upon his rump; When told by each rich dunce's damn'd son, “The Philistines are on you, Sampson;” And I had hardly breath to call “Why do'st thou persecute me, Saul?” What great man, pitying my story, Unlock'd the gates of purgatory, And whisper'd Cerberus, the porter, “This fellow keeps a miss, I court her, Miss Muse, a dame extremely lavish, Though many a dolt attempts to ravish: For sake of this celestial fair, Do, let him taste the outward air, Lo! here the glitt'ring dross he owes you; This conduct, certainly, may pose you, But I've done more, as I'm an earl, For eunuch, or an op'ra-girl; Besides, the yellow trash encumbers, And he'll repay in heav'nly numbers.” Then turn to me, and say, Sir Poet, I've friendship, and I'm come to show it; Fly from this dreary-looking barrack; Go, pen ode, madrigal, pindaric; Chaunt, quaver, whistle, trill, or warble, Songs, sweet enough to melt a marble; Catch flying Fancy by the neck fast, And write an epic—before breakfast.” Did any wight this course pursue? You shrug! the dev'l a one but you. To you, though late your worth I've known, True friend, to you I'm bound alone. And may the only spark that warms My heart, so cold to other charms, Oh! may my tuneful art expire, My faint touch tremble on the lyre, May it be strew'd with mould'ring dust, Nor I have pow'r to wipe its rust, Dew'd be each chord with many a tear, All tuneless to its master's ear, Its feeble frame may Dulness rend, When I forget the cordial friend. ON THE DEATH OF LORD HEATHFIELD. Aloft on Calpe's hideous height, Rob'd in the sable garb of Night, Sate the fell demons of the fight, And wav'd their banners blue; When moving with pathetic eye The pensive Muse stole silent by, And view'd full oft with rising sigh, Where Heathfield's laurels grew. “Sound soft the harp, in solemn tone,” And wail with sweet melodious moan— The hero's rigid race is run, Gone like the meteor's blaze! The warrior falls to rise no more, Mute be the cannon's thund'ring roar, And sad, huge Calpe's rocky shore, When thus the chief decays. The chief who in the fight deform The fiery cataract could disarm, And rise superior to the storm Now seeks an humble grave: Ah! shall my verse adorn his doom, His laureate meed unfading bloom, While holiest tears bedew his tomb, And trophy'd standards wave? Hail Britain's bravest son, all hail! Sequester'd from this worldly vale, Enthron'd, where virtue shall not fail, I see thy rev'rend shade: Lo! braided amaranths entwine Thy youthful brow in wreaths divine, While thousand stars fierce-flashing shine Around thy lumin'd head. Above the tongue of vulgar Fame, Thou hast anneal'd thy deathless name, In Calpe's glory-giving flame, And Spain shall still prolong The chieftain's praise, whose bold hand caught A wreath beyond the minstrel's thought— Yet let us tell how you have fought, “And build the lofty song.” THE GRAVE OF MORNO. Heard ye not the moan profound Bursting from yon blighted mound, Where, amid the murky air, The wild ash waves its branches bare? There, in dark-brown dust array'd, Morno's giant limbs are laid. Who, like him, with grim delight, Could front the hideous fiend of Fight? When the spears, as rattling hail, Bounded from his sable mail. See! where from the blasted bough Hangs the helm that grac'd his brow! See! its rusty vizor gleam To the pale moon's blood-shot beam! While its swinging plumage sighs To the winds that mournful rise. Never on the listed plain Shall his broad bulk gloom again; Never from his meteor-eye Shall the sons of Fingal fly: Never shall his cold lip taste The honey'd scull, the rich repast; Never bugle's mellow call Invite him to the festal hall; Nor his dull ear fondly dwell On the shrill harp's silver swell. What rose-lip'd virgins now prepare The chaplet for his raven-hair? Broider'd round with purple leaves, Who the robe of honour weaves? Crown'd by Honour, clasp'd by Love, In vain:—his winding sheet is wove. But the man of days to come, Searching for the hero's tomb, Hither by sad impulse led, Shall incline his hoary head; Aw'd to pious murmurs, breathe Brief homage o'er the mould beneath, Then, deeply-lesson'd, turn aside From the lone wreck of human pride. TO A POETICAL ENTHUSIAST. Youth! as thou read'st some celebrated page, Where Fancy all her charmful pow'rs display'd, Hast thou not curs'd thy star, with impious rage, That sunk thee, a dull blind worm, in the shade? Ah! fairer far thy calm, inglorious lot; Sweeter, though uninspir'd, thy leaden sleep; And though by Fame's obstrep'rous trump forgot, O'er thy green turf each neighb'ring hind will weep. He, who these polish'd lines so well could form, Was Passion's slave, was Indiscretion's child; Now, earth-enamour'd, grov'ling wirh the worm; Now, seraph-plum'd, the wonderful, the wild! From his lone grave the trav'ler turns aside:— Youth! by his own red hand thy envy'd fav'rite died. TO FEELING. Though she, the Sappho of the fair, Did for thy rival, dull, declare, In strain that mov'd ev'n her, O! let me court thy tearfull eye, Thy woe-fraught breast, thy tend'rest sigh, And all thy pangs prefer. Without thee, what is busy life? The husband dear, the lovely wife, The mercy-glancing maid, All, in delicious woe, confess Thy soft entrancing pow'r to bless, And gentle hearts invade. Amidst thy own terrific griefs, For others thou canst weep, Lend the sad penitent relief, And lull the wretch's sleep. Canst Sorrow's wounds with tears embalm, The fiery eye of Anger calm, And bid the sword be sheath'd: How dear, I well can tell the sighs That sad-participating rise, From lips of Pity breath'd. Then come, sweet mourner, with me live, Both bosoms tremblingly alive, The shrinking flow'r shall wreath Thy pallid brow; and at the last, Angels shall view us (troubles past) Unanimous in death. THE PIPE OF TOBACCO. Hail, solace of the wounded heart, Whose fumes ambrosial joys impart Beyond the doctor's gilded bait, Beyond the glutton's sumptuous state! How bless'd when by the chimney's side I draw the brisk, delicious tide, And talk with venerable pride Of things abstruse, By thy sweet vapours more supply'd Than by the Muse. How we discuss the daily scandal, And politics divinely handle, Knock authors down—by inch of candle, And damn each critic, Till seiz'd by smoke, I, lack! can stand ill, Quite paralytic. The midwife's gab of fire obstetric, The smith's Newtonian flow of rhet'ric, The barber's tale of Charles or Fred'ric, The joiner's carol, When join'd by thy supreme emetic, Would broach a barrel— Thy dingy volumes most they read, And pluck forth laurels from thy weed; Blest be the man who sow'd thy seed, With cautious care, Bright fire, and smoke, may he ne'er need, And 'bacco fare. O! how religion, trade, and state, Chime in so nice with each debate! Zounds! how tobacco tends to create Good-humour'd battles, And bids the whole communion prate As loud as rattles. So tabernacled, son and brother, Nod, drowsy, drooping, to each other, Striving their listlessness to smother, At snuffled sermon, Or preacher who has lost his rudder, Capricious vermin! Puns, quibbles, cranks, conundrums, crosticks, Deal bloody blows, like murd'ring pot-sticks, And, faith, they sometimes wield their hot sticks, Inspir'd by thee, sir, But then they'd eat ev'n grass (and rot sticks!) Like Nebuchadnezzar. Bland comforter of all poor bards, How balmy o'er a pack o' cards, When conversation interlards Thy friendly vapour, O! I will court thy best regards, To soil my paper. And though thou cost me much in pocket, Tobacco! 'gad, I'll never lock it, But wight who ever will may smoke it, With tongue awag, Till tapers sink into the socket, Like fox in bag. AN HEROIC EPISTLE FROM A FEMALE RABBI IN JERUSALEM TO A CELEBRATED BUCK IN IRELAND. Cœlum, non animum mutant Qui trans mare currunt. Hor. Dear, hapless youth! the object of my flame, Believe me still in love, and still the same; Ev'n now my bosom feels the former fire, Again thy letter wakes my warm desire; Again I burn with all a lover's pain, And greet thee! distant, on Ierne's plain. Ah! could you think the torments I endure, (Sad sign! my hopeless passion still is pure) Lest thou through wilds and dreary desarts go, Or lie in bogs, a spectacle of woe! Perhaps, ev'n now deform with sable mire, You want a warming glass and cheering fire; Nor canst thou bear their malice so prepense, Depriv'd of half thy wit and half thy pence. No sullen landlord there will take thee in, Refuse thy cash, and give the glass of gin! No! barb'rous men! they, join'd with waiters, fleece The luckless wretch, and fob the golden piece: Gods! can the Irish have their hearts so hard? And will their inns the trav'lling buck discard? Can all his tales of pleasure and of pain, Of Dukes cornuted, and of shoeboys slain, Of puppies pink'd, and beaus by monkies torn, Of chairmen bilk'd, and watermen forlorn, Told in the pleasing garb of nature, fail? Oh! can't they broach a tun of amber ale? No! though the suppliant prays, devoid of gold, No frothing vase he gains, of pewter mold; For him no quarts with foliag'd handles shine, And letters, carv'd by workmanship divine; No grooms with blankets toss my love on high, “And add new monsters to the frighted sky.” Or plung'd in lakes too muddy for the Muse, His grizzly locks begrim'd with horrent ooze. My lover stares! I'll catch him in my arms, Though ponds and blankets threat with dire alarms! I'll wring those locks I often oil'd so smart, When thou, anointed monarch of my heart, Or laid thy head recumbent on my knee, And shook thy greasy dripping curls at me. But ah! again my hapless bosom beats, To think how scribblers fell will maul thy feats, In murky rhimes their dire allusions cloak, And ah! for e'er prolong th' infernal joke; If thou canst keep thy hand from breaking panes, Trembling from cars, and serenading lanes, Despise their malice, you shall envy'd be, Though cynics, curs, and princes laugh at thee. But ah! my dearest, let not gypsies lead Thy vagrant wand'rings to the rural mead; Let dire Drumcondra A kind of Vauxhall near Dublin. e'er unheeded lie, Though teapots, cups, and saucers, court the eye: Perchance, while bagpipes play, and gibes go round, Love floats adown thy throttle with the sound; Or madness lurks beneath the strident strings, Or French flies load thy draught with fiery wings. Full many a snare will tempt thy youthful heart, But, dearest, chief beware of the black cart. A huge cart in the form of an artillery waggon, led by the police officers through the streets, for the purpose of carrying the beggars found there to the house of correction. Around the moving engine, watchmen ply, With hell-hound grin, and turn th' eternal eye. Oh! if their ken should meet thy lovely face, And mount thee tow'ring, source of dire disgrace; Their slipshod dames that pour'd the morning note Have spit-up barriers threat'ning at their throat. There captive Helens poke through crannied chinks, There sit the sharper and the am'rous minx; And oft, to shew the dreadful place has merit, The cage-coop'd Methodists confess the spirit, While to the list'ning saints that swear around, They preach, and nasal twangs return the sound; Escape but these, and firm in conscious hope, Despise the challenge, and outbrave the rope. If scribblers dare thy nobler deeds abuse, A purse will hush the poet and his muse; Sweet is the shilling's silver sound to hear, Substantial jingle in the poet's ear; For spite of all they write, and all they think, Poor mortal songsters, sure, must eat and drink. But, dearest Buck, excuse me when I tell My soul to thee, because I know thee well. What trifling scheme, or air-balloon pretence, Could make thee game, and wager with thy prince, Give all thy solid chattles to the wind, Stake all thy wealth, nor leave a wreck behind? Ah, witless wight! ah little didst thou know, That supple courtiers schem'd thy future woe; And Foxes waiting for the destin'd luck, At once turned brave, and hunted for the Buck, While eager for the money and the fame, The royal sportsmen called the practice game. Attic orations, pickled periods, pelt, With keenest force, but yet they cannot melt; Nor flow'ry speeches sav'd with Grecian salt, Nor brilliant puns, could buy a pint of malt. Thus re-nos'd youths a luckless frog assail, And pelt the helpless trav'ller head and tail; But when their prey is dead, with pity pierc'd, They lay him in a hole, on slate inhears'd; And when the life is parted from their prize, They greet his snout with epitaph and cries. Ah! sad refinement! when he's dead and gone, In place of bangs and thumps, to give a stone. Thus you, my love, by wicked courtiers bit, Paid sterling brass for French-imported wit, Wit, which though fine, and ready at command, Is not quite current in your booby land; True music there comes charming in a rent, And the best rhimes are plac'd in cent. per cent. What golden dreams the raptur'd fancy fill, When George's jingle in the vocal till! What song so charming as a banker's note? They have no charms for thee, to grief devote. Alas! no golden dream shall fill thy thought, No solid gold thy fob, with riches fraught. Ah! how will Dublin bucks thy spirit warm, “Mock at thy breeches, and deride thy form!” Ah! how will Dublin belles contemptuous rail, And simper at thy alter'd face, so pale! Full many a bull will knock thy echoing pate, But bulls in Ireland are but few—of late— Full many a blood “will lace thy silver skin,” For thus they riot in excess of sin. Rouleaus and dress can cure the loss of sense, But ah! no charm can heal the want of pence; No dowager for thee will give a ball, Ah! doom'd to stand unwelcome in the hall. The printshops oft shall show resemblance quaint, And thy sweet face run yellow still in paint. Ill-fated youth, one effort still remains To ease thy former griefs and future pains, To wipe the black dishonour from thy face, “The hangman-grandeur and the shoeboy grace;” And best of all—Your character shall lose No heav'nly deed among my parent Jews. Whether ambitious of a star you vie, Or city glories catch your judging eye; If aldermanic feasts can tempt to ease, And streams of sauce, and spicy hills of geese, Strong-season'd turtles, or the golden ham, Or hares transfix'd, and metamorphos'd lamb. Lo! there they lie! oh, grasp thy knife and fork, There split the turkey-paunch, and scalp the pork; Ev'n now I see the pork, so red and white; Yet ah! I am forbid my chief delight! See icy promontories crown the fish! Confectionary mountains load the dish! See mystic viands in the oval tart, And queen-cakes, emblems of my own sweetheart. If these can charm thy heart, or turn thy head, Oh! strew the board with Apennines of dead! But first—Like sapient Sir John D? so stout, Save majesty some thousands by sour-crout. If stars and garters boast a brighter blaze, And thistles tempt you greater than the bays, To China go, and when you come again, Build bright pagodas on your native plain; From Spain transport her fragrant orange groves, Where zebras soon may propagate their loves; Squirrels and monkies then shall yoke with dogs, And sweet signoras bless the vocal bogs; Guitars and bagpipes then shall squeak around, And all the croaking nations hail the sound! Apply soft Indian odes to Irish drones, And be your sacred model Sir Will Jones. But ah! my love, beware of ill-tim'd rage, Nor leap from twelve foot windows o'er a stage, Thy legs may suffer, that would grieve my heart, Yet we have nought to pay the healing art. The sons of Peon now, of bus'ness full, Can scarce attend to heal a rich man's skull: And can they, can they, when in wealth secure, Attend at all the pennyless and poor? Ah, no! though bucks have whilom fill'd their jaws, Yet now they leave them, in a better cause. Ingratitude, thou constant bane of macs! And can such brazen gizzards dwell in Quacks? If parliament delights thee, and a coach, Study the well-turn'd eloquence of Roach. Sir Boyle Roach. Harangue, and stamp, and then harangue again, And bray the loudest of the long-ear'd train; Mingle farrago-like your Irish Latin, And stoutly stun the ear of patriot Grattan. This, this, will rise you higher than a steeple, And make you chief defender of the people; But sure the people, laughing in their sleeves, Each action mock, for ev'ry action grieves; You rise Demosthenes in self-esteem, But if you slumber, does your country dream? No, I repent my counsel—Still be cool, Nor let the nation totter on a fool: Full many a babbling Atlas, when grown older, Has wept the weight of countries on his shoulder; Full many a statesman had his “back y-bent,” His country's porter, paid at cent. per cent. No, love, I wish your blund'ring country well, For Jews have batten'd there, as bankers tell. No, love, you shall not help the fall of stocks, Nor tempt again the cormorant and fox; They yet have work, while H? has a pound, When he is hang'd at last, they may be drown'd; Then shall their pepper'd quids sublimely hail, And belles no more the luckless man assail. Thus when stout chanticleer, with ruby crest, Adorns the stake, and bares his glowing breast, The hens and chickens pensive stalk around, Now peck a grain, then shudder at his wound, Their plumage ruffle when they see his blood, Scream loud, and shake their tails besprent with mud; But when through clarion beak he breathes his last, They yield to fate, and quite forget the past, Run flaunting through the channel in a row, T' attract the notice of some dunghill beau, And in most melancholy moans they sigh Their widow'd wand'rings to the cock on high! Thus have I labour'd for thy good, and laid Thy last kind letter underneath my head. But oh! unhappy hunger! rats have tore Thy lovely scrawl, and rent my night-cap more. Conceive my posture; in one hand I smother Thy precious scraps, my night-cap in the other; One eye adverse beholds a rotten chink, My left orb squints upon a jug of drink; Ev'n now a dog my loaded pockets maul'd; Gods! how I shrunk, I trembled, and I bawl'd— Moses came in as rough as any bear; I thrust your precious paper G— knows where; I blush'd my crime—and now I date this scrawl From the black cov'ring of a garret wall; On broken chair I hang my doleful harp, And the wind strikes the string with breezes sharp! Oh! cou'dst thou see me now with icy nose, Dripping with dew, and crimson as the rose, My tatter'd petticoat around my head, Mice my companions, and the floor my bed, My head-dress damag'd with unusual flaws, And my red tresses interwove with straws. Yes, gen'rous youth, you'd fetch the cheering cake, And pawn your only breeches for my sake; The racy rum would raise my soul to joy, And make me lovelier for my charming boy. Yet let me suffer all that I can feel, If thou canst 'scape the gamester's goary steel; This scrawl shall tell your feats when I am dead, And still alive perplex thy anxious head; Perhaps some bard, by tender feelings mov'd, May tell that once you liv'd, and once I lov'd. SONG. [Cold lies that form beneath the sod] Cold lies that form beneath the sod, Where all the graces shone; Cold too that breast, a languid load, Which virtue mark'd her own. Ah! never shall that sprightly eye, Illume life's dreary gloom; To silence charm that anguish'd sigh, That now bewails thy tomb. Ah! never shall thy balmy lip, Speak comfort to my soul, In ecstacy my troubles steep, And ev'ry grief control. Ah! never shall that heav'nly breast, Support my aching head;— —Grim horror's now thy baleful guest, Thy train, the ghastly dead! DOCTOR FAUSTUS'S PANEGYRIC. Hail, Lord of boluses anointed; Of cholic'd guts, and bones disjointed; Vicegerent here, by death appointed, To work his slaves, Penning each mittimus so pointed, To glut the graves. So skilful, if the patient's water, B' applied to your nostrils seven months a'ter, You'll ferret ev'ry son and daughter, 'Till they're at ease, Nimrod, that huntest after slaughter, Like fox for geese! Is the young squire as door-nail dead, You clap a blister to his head, Add clyster till his bum be red; Ill-fated booby, For fear of waking him, light tread, And close the lobby. With gallipots his bedstead pillar, Sprinkle him with powders like a miller, Then sagely say, supreme mankiller, He's in a sleep, Good faith he's so, for the tomb-teller, And snoring deep! Such learned words thy skill compose, The devil incarnate they would pose, And puzzle your master under the rose, To con their meaning; St. Dunstan, thou couldst tweak his nose, And send him grinning. Greek, Latin, twined with Hebrew roots, Are beating up with Scotch recruits, Pressing each mystic word that suits, Thy mutter'd knowledge, Thou couldst fill Aristotle's boots, And kick the college. Whene'er I ken thy pestle pounding, Methinks I hear a death knell sounding, Some one is taking the cold ground in A nap quietus, While thou art polysyllables rounding, Like Epictetus. By the Lord, an thou goest on so gaily, The Hades will be peopled daily; “Shake not at me thy wig so mealy, I did it not,” I only hint, your subjects really, Are gone to pot. Perchance, you'd take it in your noddle, To send me some stout opium bottle, Or cram cursed slipslops down my throttle, In lieu of answer; Do, and I'll dress your bull's pout-twattle, Till you may dance, Sir. I'll pour thy physic down thy gullet, Pamper thee up with pills, like pullet, Slash thee with potions, like a mullet, Or engine spouting, Thy sprite carnivorous, I'll lull it, Recesses all, routing. Thou dirty leech, I wou'd'nt, I tell ye, E'en let you tap Pegasus' belly, Or glyster him, obstreperous fellow, Or pick his corns; I'gad, good slop, you'd better rally, And gild your horns. So mind your farrier trade, nor meddle With christians, like bear and fiddle, Or I will shew thy jargon riddle, Of hum, and haw; Plunge thee, dull miscreant, in the puddle, And stop thy maw. THE QUESTION AND REPLY. Why streams so fast from those dim eyes, The tear that tells a secret woe? Does sorrow breathe such tender sighs, For some lost friend, who sleeps below; A brother, in untimely battle slain, Or parents rescu'd from the world of pain? Ah, no!—nor friendship's cold embrace, Nor brother's deeply-bleeding breast, Nor parents sunk in endless rest, Could cause such anguish as that fatal face! From love,—from love alone my tortures spring, And the fell viper wounds me while I sing. AN ELEGY ON A PROVERB-MONGER. Friends, cease your doleful cries and mourning, Though Hodges' soul is burnt, or burning, “Tis a long lane that has no turning,” “And fire wastes tow,” “There's sweet as well as sour in churning,” And “joy ends woe.” At most, though death should load his bier, And Satan long his soul should tear, What can they do?—so de'el may care, They cannot form I ween, “a silk purse of sow's ear, “Or beer of barm.” “As sure as two and two make four,” They'll let his soul in quiet snore, And lay him as dead on the floor, “As David's sow,” “A soft word sootheth wrath,” therefore, Don't look below. What, though some time in hell he stay, “Sour vinegar must make sweet whey:” Rome was not finish'd in a day; Be of my mind, Your ditty sad and songs delay, For “words are wind.” Each methodist, or stupid ass, Will tell you, Sirs, that “flesh is grass;” And it will also come to pass, “That grass will fire;” The ember lies just where it was, The smoke mounts higher. So, let the good folks do their will, The sexton will e'en take his fill, It brings more “grist unto his mill,” And “drains the bog;” Heav'n rest him, they may make him still, “A hog, or dog.” For, being “old dog” as I may say, At every wicked gambol gay, “When cat is out, the mice will play,” And mock old Nick, He'll sport, if fortune, in this way, Don't shew “dog's trick.” Then, “sure's a gun” he'll find to's cost, “He reckon'd on without his host,” And “cock-a-hoop” not mind what's lost, “Till pay-day come,” When he must desolate the coast “Without beat o' drum.” If he don't chance with saws, to tether Satan's two ears, like “bird of a feather,” He must go without “why or whether,” To “fill the oven,” Kick'd out, with all his goods together, By foot “so cloven.’ I warrant, though the queer rogue tickles His highness' taste, with flatt'ring pickles, And ere a month, or some short week, lies, “Claim cater cousin, And be as great with Master Nichol's, As “six to the dozen.” Then cease, he's snug enough “in port,” Prince serjeant of th' infernal court, Following his own congenial sport, As is the fashion, And proverbs mouthing of each sort, 'Twas “his vocation.” TO FEELING. Why thrills each nerve at Fancy's pictur'd woe, At pity's tale why starts the tender breast? Can scenes, by thought's delusive pencil drest, Bid the full drop of pregnant anguish flow? What cruel pow'r thus wrings my easy heart? 'Tis feeling, prophetess of distant ills, With pensive ecstacy she poin's the dart, In pleasing poison ting'd, that slow, but surely kills. Oft o'er the cradled infant hath she wept, And mark'd, with eye deprest, the woes of age; Oft while the babe, in harmless silence slept, She trac'd the vary'd passions, and their rage; Wild-bursting wrath, revenge, with blood-shot glance, Pale jealousy, on love, with scowling brow Still watchful fix'd, false honor's impious glow, All sunk as yet beneath the mental trance, Nor rous'd by fervid youth, to shake this mortal stage. Oft while the matron hung with fondest mirth On him, whose truth first won her partial thought, And all her smiling offspring throng the hearth, Has feeling her funereal vision wrought; Oft seem'd to view the baleful hearse await The ghastly sire, the matron's widow'd weeds, The smiling offspring snatch'd by feverish fate; Meanwhile, fallacious grief! her tortur'd bosom bleeds. Ah! me, too many are our cares unfeign'd, Too many troubles guard life's thorny way; Yet ne'er have I of thy soft pangs complain'd, Nor sought, with heedless haste, the giddy gay; Beneath thy willows have I lov'd to mourn, While stream'd the tribute tear from pity's sluice, Still deck'd with flow'rs the hapless stranger's urn, Sincerely sad—the martyr of the Muse! AN ODE TO A GREAT MAN'S GREAT PORTER. Sweet Cerberus, let dainty sonnets move thee, So may Apollo and the Muses love thee; Crown thy proud front with wreaths so fine; O! let a poor, lean, hungry Orpheus dine! In vain—no modulations charm thy breast, Harder than brass, or bookseller, or marble; Thou long'st to crush the muses little nest, Lo! thou wouldst castrate ev'ry bard, Which usage is confounded hard, To spoil their vigour, not to make them warble.— Some critic, felon, gave thee form, With nails corroded, and obstetic pain, Th' impenetrable offspring of his brain, While printer's devils bestrode the howling storm; Yes, caitiff, thou hast vitriol suck'd, with aquafortis, For murd'ring songsters thy infernal sport is! I have no golden branch, God help the while, To make this fiend-like sybil smile; This sybil, scatt'ring my fair leaves about, This ghost of opposition, swift interring, My still-born verses with an hideous shout, And knocking genius dead as any herring. Tygers and Russian bears would spare the darlings, Yet thou, vile ox-cheeks, choak the pretty starlings; The pretty starlings, wont of yore, Amid the radiant blaze of morn to soar, Swelling their tuneful throats, their small wings flutt'ring, Still, Cyclops, thou'rt lewd curses mutt'ring; Still like a hell-hound, barking loud and dread; Good hell-hound, quick chop off my tuneful head, Or, let me enter thy enchanted hall, For either by thy teeth, or sharper want, I fall; Sad luck, indeed, but not uncommon! So damme, in I rush, despite of frowns, And parte-colour'd, bluff-cheek'd clowns; Assurance be my guide, I die a Roman! AN EPISTLE TO THE CONTROVERTISTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CATHOLIC COMBUSTION. In medio tutissimus ibis. ARGUMENT IN ABSTRACT. The poet introduceth himself with a stare—Groweth so witty that Tom Brown was a mule to him—Saluteth the Pope magnificently—Hinteth at the huge rabble-rout of writers—Lasheth them severely—Addresseth both sides of the gutter with admirable politeness—Swearing—Contention—Hanging— Scribbling—Goose—Bacon—Falleth foul of the unfortunate authors who have written on the Catholic question—Cutteth them up nicely—Minceth and maketh a Christmas pye of them—Forsweareth ingratitude—Describeth the commotion of the coffee-house critics—Shoals of similes to the end of the chapter—Jack Presbyter's shrewd doubts—Unwilling to have the Catholics saved—Meekly possesseth his gentle, and humane turn of temper—Appeareth to wax rather impertinent—Avoweth his own praises again—Satan handed in with the witch of Endor—Classically elegant allusion—More egotism—Stickleth for freedom and equality—Pagan tenets —Laudeth any man who adoreth the great Creator—Groweth warm in defence of the Catholics—Scalpeth Ierne about her indolence in protecting genius—Cursory dialogue between the Poet and his Muse—Starteth with new vigour to the gaol—Inditeth at the same time an ode to Miss Toleration, who is born to bear the load of every man, and concludeth with a sigh to the Catholic peasantry of Ireland. PRŒMIUM. Marv'ling, with most becoming stare, I view'd Of blue-bound quartos, what a motley brood, Red-hot, and flaming from the devil's hand, As o'er the window's glassy arches, peering, Keen as a cat, I pored a-pamphleteering, And spied such heaps, that with emphatic eye, Loud did I cry, “Good lack! have Stockdale, Hatchard, time to stand In such rare attitudes, so striking fine?” I gaz'd upon the bibliopolist's gay shrine, With such anxiety—as would amaze ye, Like one stark crazy. Crazy, that word my judgment spurns, With loftier simile my bosom burns. So have I seen in Gill'ry's shop, Hector, of Priam's house the prop; Hector, (as Homer says) so famed for grinning, With one hand, Styanax's bottom pinning, And th' other, stretch'd in agony of prayers, As if to beckon Jove down stairs. The influence of religion, catches All folk, like cur-dogs, by the breeches; All brothers of the quill in prose sublime, Without or reason, write, or rhime; In civet, the pope's magnific toe, Ne'er kick'd up such a dust before, Nor did that venerable beau, Suffer his rosy cherubim to snore, But bade the itch of authorship to bite 'em Ad infinitum. Then, shall not I in bold poetic fury, Outface this venerable jury, And say, “My noble, and approv'd good masters,” When mother-church is sick, Even I, in the nick, Can patch the good old dame with plasters; Therefore, in pompous sounding lay, I dash away. EPISTLE. Messieurs! Whether to relics you may choose to kneel, To ribbon-rags, and bits of broken steel, Or, Luther's honest schemes of diet studying, On Friday, feast with carnal beef and pudding; Or, whether of a mongrel-race, You twang full sermons through the nose In this same disputary case; To all I offer up my lyric does, Nor care, so patriotic my proceeding, Which party's ribs are left a-bleeding. The Catholics, Embolden'd by the sublime wish of protecting those they regard and love, of handing down the blessings of liberty to their children, and lastly, of exalting themselves above the level of servitude, they have determined again to petition their equals for the rights of life, and the rewards of patience, under a sway little less than despotic. I own (who cut such capers Upon the forehead and the breast,) Have thrown all other sects into the vapours, And rous'd the whole vexatious nest; Who swear most furiously, the scoundrel Romans, Shall sit outside the House of Commons. Per contra, the fierce Romans swear, To pull taxation by the ear, Knock pride, like rotten flounder, on the stones, And break emancipation's bones; Yes, they will be fry'd, bak'd, and roasted, Ere privilege, the darling claim they lose, Purchase the blessed boon, whatever cost it, Or hang, cum totis viris, in their shoes; And really, if they break their chains asunder, I would advise the gentlemen to thunder. Poor fellows! many a scribbler strips his muse, Videlicet, a goose; With all the rage of criticism taken, To bang their consecrated bacon. Furious they fling their venom'd foam about, And take St. Peter by the snout. Their periods all, like Addison's, so short, Their florid dialect like Burke's; Their sense as strong as fifty Turks, Their wit as sharp and bright as knives and forks: Give me, indeed, a world of sport; I scorn to speak ill words of any body, Of asses ev'n—Ingratum odi. Gaping, like oysters, at low tide, The politicians prate about this matter, And raise, with truly Aristarchal pride, Heav'n's! what a clatter! The coffee lingers at each statesman's lip, And fluent wisdom butters every sip. The horns that blew down (bubble-like) old Jericho, Making the stagg'ring battlements to pound Their dying habitants upon the ground, Without any quarter; Lying, like carrots in a smoking harrico, Or composition-bolus in a mortar, Were but mere bagpipes to the mighty lungs, That swell of Mistress Fame, the thousand tongues. See, in yon box, how close the critics sit, Meanwhile, the froth-crown'd goblet briskly moves, Light bounce (quicksilver all) the squibs of wit, That fit the subject like a pair of gloves; The Catholics they hunt as noblest game, And talk, and tipple into fame, Till the gruff waiter (an unwelcome guest!) Presumes the jovial triflers to infest. Loud as the post-horn's echoing shout, The Protestants not quite devout, With cautious care, forsooth, exclaim, “Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,” Which in the English, Sirs, is quite the same, As much as, “Martin shall repent his Entering on leagues with Master Peter,” Nothing than this construction comes completer. Jack Presbyter There are many Protestants, distinguished by their rank and virtues, who view the Catholics as brethren, and willingly would emancipate them from their present state of subjection; notwithstanding the holy prejudice which has recently been displayed by the white-stoled zealots, who dread the least innovation on their unmerited wealth and influence. is ready to run wild, Nay, March-hare mad, at this presumption, Trembles, least legislature is beguil'd, And marvels at the ninny-hammer's gumption; (Gumption, a word which doth not vary, Though not in Johnson's Dictionary.) He fumes, to think those papists should be saved, And power of his strong locks entirely shaved! Now I, a timid, gentle sort of wight, My pigeon-heart, as alabaster-white, Would wish to see, In each degree, The offspring of one kingdom greatly free: Which wish has brought into my mind, An ode so simple, gen'rous, and refin'd; An ode, which kindling up like tinder, Breathes the celestial fire of Pindar, And wonld not (reader, 'tis no trope!) Disgrace the pen of Dryden, Gray, or Pope. ODE TO TOLERATION. Mild nymph, with calm unalter'd eye, Rais'd in soft rapture to the sky, And loosely folded arms; Glowing with holy love, I view Thy rosy cheek's ambrosial hue; Thy bosom's tranquil charms; Glowing, I wooe thee to my pilgrim seat, Nymph! ever lovely, ever sweet. Thou canst the voice of party hear, With undisturb'd and candid car, Nor turn the angry frown; Appease the harpy fangs of law, And make the peasant's wholesome straw, More soft than bolted down; Yes, thou canst render all complete, Nymph, ever lovely, ever sweet. By true religion's sacred side, Constant you tread, with glorious pride, To hush the rapid storm; Thy starry presence gilds the gloom, Thy fragrance bathes the rose's bloom, And gives creation form; Spring flings her flow'rs beneath thy feet, Nymph! ever lovely, ever sweet. O! thou canst check the turbid mind, Spread pure affection through mankind Savage and fell no more; Thy tongue, with words, 'bove mortal speech, The high decrees of heav'n can teach, And pity's tender lore; Blest 'bove the haughty, 'bove the great Nymph! ever lovely, ever sweet. Descend from thy illustrious car Of sapphire light, that beams afar, In brilliant pomp, descend; So shall I smile on human race, My trust in each man's bosom place, And think each man my friend; Glowing, I wooe thee to my pilgrim seat, Nymph! ever lovely, ever sweet. End of the Ode. EPISTLE continued. Is this not pretty, gentles, eh! Quite in the taking way? Sublime and beautiful, and soft, and tender, Enough to melt the rugged witch of Endor: Like snuff, to pinch Sir Satan by the nose, And match the music of the warbling crows. So, in the gentle radiance of the night, Lov'd Philomel her plaintive dirges pours, Saddens the pale-eyed moon-beam's sombre light, And tunes to pity's nerve the lonely hours; Meanwhile, low breezes creep the leaves among, And stilly whispers break her solitary song. Is that not pretty too? methinks I rise, In ev'ry line more tow'ring to the skies; My eagle-pinion sails the heights of air, And leaves the mead below to dullness and despair. Freedom I love, and Freedom strikes the lyre; Freedom, the Attic chord, divinely touches; Freedom, of poesy the manly sire, Who, could he get vile slav'ry in his clutches, Would give the dæmon such a Cornish hug, And crack his sides, as topers crack a jug. Yes, I would have Equality through all, 'Tis fair Equality that rules the ball; In golden balance hangs the orbs of light, And bids the 'tendant glories beam so bright; In ardent equipoise aloft they stand, And bless Equality's almighty hand. Disunion, fiercer than the tempest's wing, Scatters destruction o'er the trembling globe, Rude rends sweet concord's floating robe, And blights the pallid cheek of infant spring; Disunion rises from the cell of death, To kill the cordial smile, and blast the festal wreath. Religion may be won by various courses, People have worshipp'd sheep and horses; Onions, were fav'rite gods of the Egyptians, As Monsieur Pliny tells in grave descriptions; Howe'er, to those I would not be so civil, As to trot headlong to the devil, Because, though they were great some years ago, Perchance, their tents, this year, are pitch'd below. But he who kneels to Him, whose mighty call Shook Sinai's top, in thunder, and in flame, Whose right hand clasps this universal all; And is through ev'ry land th' eternal same; Though modes may differ, he's as free To gain his utmost wish, as me! Say, am I judge? can I condemn? accuse? The rights of brotherhood abuse, Forbid his blooming hopes of life to rise, And crush the fruitful stem before his eyes? No, the same common good is made for each, And left within the best deserver's reach. May not a Catholic They have long seen, without murmuring, those who are oppressors, climb to the highest offices of the state, while they are universally despised, and neglected. Scorn itself is attended with loss of fortune. They are refused any department in the commonwealth! For what cause? Is it because they are loyal in their sufferings, and willing to assist without their hire? Is it because they are hindered from polishing their genius by the force of proper education? Is it because they defend that which they do not possess?— Who will reply? It cannot be that they are treated as vassals for following, with veneration, the mode of worship their forefathers, and those whose memory they held dear, followed. Who can say they are wrong, or who attest themselves right?—Another tribunal shall judge that matter. as well preside At honor's helm, as him who mocks his pray'r? Teem not his veins with full as rich a tide? Feels not his breast as soft a load of care? Is he not equal? then, whose impious hand Shall drive from virtue's post the loyal band! Who fights our battles? who protects our coast,— And is their gen'rous labour lost? And must their meritorious actions die? O'er which desponding justice heaves a sigh! Through danger's ruin, lo! the heroes rush, Nor mind a being in the awful crush; Content their country's force to save, By their own early grave! But cease, my song; the tears of honest rage, In agony, bedew my spotless page. No mitigation of your bondage crave, For mis'ry is the portion of the brave! TO THE CATHOLICS OF IRELAND. Weep, sons of hapless Erin, weep, Your chains in tears of anguish steep, And as you bend the streaming eye, Where pale and plunder'd brethren lie, On Albion's head no blessings breathe, She's ting'd with blood the victor wreath! Lo! where the famish'd peasant lies, No more with freedom flash his eyes, No more the smiling pleasures steal From heav'n, to bless his temp'rate meal; Ev'n hospitality, no more Courts the tir'd stranger to the door. Indignant, wisdom flies the land, Where folly plants her venal band; Gay humour drops the beamy dart, All pow'rless on corruption's heart; And, veil'd in shame's most sullen hues, Fair honour follows with the Muse! Sweet country, shall I never hear Best music to the patriot's ear; The ploughman carol, as he wakes The small lark from the russet brakes; Or twilight, as it creeps along, Made lovely by his ev'ning song! For, ah! without the lab'rer's toil, (So much despis'd, the courtier's spoil!) Without the soft arts that refine The soul, and knit in bonds divine, The vacant boast, the armed train, Or all that tyrants grant—are vain! Bleeds not my filial breast, and flow No tributes to my country's woe? Yes, while these streaming sluices view Heav'n's light, shall pity fill anew; But little can such grief avail! Can tears a tyrant's heart assail? Thy foes shall see, with equal fire, I wield the sword, or sweep the lyre. So, mid the brown wood's leafy vault, While echoing wilds his anguish caught, The minstrel mourn'd—beneath the shade Of barren boughs, for slav'ry made, Juverna heard, and, as she sigh'd, Quick turn'd, the blushful cheek to hide. The speeding sail, that oft, of yore, Commercial wealth, and plenty bore; Droops in the gale—some British god Has barr'd the ocean's open road, In wild inviolable jest, Says Thou be wretched, I am blest! Weep, sons of hapless Erin, weep, Your chains in tears of anguish steep; And as you bend the streaming eye, Where pale and plunder'd brethren lie; On Albion's head no blessings breathe, She's ting'd with blood the victor wreath!</field>
