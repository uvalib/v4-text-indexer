      <field name="fulltext">Dedication. TO COUNT ARTHUR DE GOBINEAU ORVAL; OR, THE FOOL OF TIME. A POEM. (IN FIVE EPOCHS: DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL.) “La prépondérance du cœur sur l'esprit, .... unique source, spontanée ou systématique, de l'harmonic humaine.”—Auguste Comte. FIRST EPOCH. BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM. Scene I.—Sunset. Mountain and Valley near the Castle of Orval, which is partly visible in the background. Mists forming over the landscape. Distant joy-bells, which cease as the scene opens. The Guardian Angel descends. Guardian Angel. From soul to soul hath war been waged, From star to star, from sun to sun: Nor e'er shall be the strife assuaged That's hourly lost and hourly won. Ancient of Days, that here in light, And there in darkness, dost array Thee, Thou madest day, Thou madest night, And both obey Thee. The sons of night Thy servants are: They work Thy will, no less than we, The sons of light, that with them war Unwearied where no end can be. But woe to man, if light in vain He sees, and seeks the darkness rather! From seed of evil, evil grain That man shall gather. Dreams fade, deeds fail, and days depart, And all is changed in time and place. Thrice blessèd are the pure in heart: For only they shall see God's face. Man's life from cradle leads to tomb: Man's love from Earth may lead to Heaven: Be thankful, therefore, thou to whom A heart was given. Hold fast, O man, to whom God gives, To keep thy heart still undefiled, The holy human love that lives In kiss of wife, and kiss of child, Hold fast the gift! The hour, that now To Heaven returns, to Heaven is bearing A husband's sacramental vow, Vow'd in God's hearing. The pure in heart God's face shall see. They of the Blest are blessèd most. Man's heart, O Lord, lies bare to Thee: Shall this man, Lord, be saved, or lost? Though o'er his soul be cast the net That Satan weights with strong temptation, He that hath yet a heart may yet Escape damnation. (The Guardian Angel ascends.) Evil Spirits (rising with the mist). With the vapours arising from earth arise, Shadows of Falsehood, whose shapes are lies, And enter where ye are waited! Phantoms, and films, and illusions, That mimic the light you loathe, With deliriums, dreams, and confusions The creature that calls you, clothe! Choke the conscience, and cheat the eyes, Strangle the spirit, but stifle its cries: For the fall of the fool is fated. Love to lust, and courage to crime, And sense to sin, for the fool of time, Orval! Orval! Thou, first, loved beauty of youth's lost bloom, The Departed of Yesterday, rise from the tomb, And bewilder him that bewails thee. Too soon to the darkness hurried, Wan ghost, to the light rearise, And, haunting him, dead but unburied, Reappear in a dream to his eyes. In the dews of the night be thou bathed, and bound With the blossoms that grow upon graves, and crown'd, By the heart of the fool that hails thee, With the stars of the night, till the grave-worm's slime Be as glow-worm lights to the fool of time, Orval! Orval! Thou also, old picture of Paradise, well In the cobwebb'd lumber-chamber of Hell Hast thou rested, rotted, and rusted: Beëlzebub's masterpiece, painted Long since, though thy canvas be old, And the hues of it tarnisht and fainted, Yet retoucht with our purple and gold, Thou shalt brighten, and glitter, and glow, for him, With the colours of Eden ere they wax'd dim. Come forth, and be furbisht and dusted! O Nature, mother of sins sublime, Fair be thy face to the fool of time, Orval! Orval! Last, thou, too, carrion bird of prey, Whose name upon earth is Ambition, away, Where the huntsman to hunt thee hastens! Stuff'd with Hell's ashes and cinders, Famed Bird of Perdition, depart From thy perch on the Past. Nothing hinders Thy flight, though a scarecrow thou art. Spread thy wings in the ardours of morn, and bright As the sunrise, and swift as the wind, be thy flight, Till firmly thy talon fastens, Red with carnage, and crooked with crime, On the ruin'd heart of the fool of time, Orval! Orval! Scene II. Twilight. On the road to the Castle. Bridal Guests and Kinsmen passing. Country Kinsman. I say, good men should choose good wives. Town Kinsman. Good Cousin, Were I about to choose a lackey, now, I'd choose him, Coz, for his good looks: because There's nothing you can absolutely know About your lackey, but the looks of him, Until you've hired him. But, were I to choose A wife, I'd choose her for her fortune, Coz, Because there's nothing else a man can know About a maiden, till he has married her. Our fair new Cousin . . Country Kinsman. With brown woodland eyes, Shy as a forest creature freshly caught— Zounds, Cousin! if Orval's not the lovingest spouse, As she's the loveliest, the world has seen Since Adam married Eve among the roses, The devil take him! A Priest. Son, I have known this lady, Since when she was the sweetest child, whom now I know the sweetest woman, in Christendom; Nor ever in the simple saintliness Of her most innocent soul, have I known aught To wish away. Country Kinsman. I am glad to hear it, Father; For patience is the strength of Saints: and much I fear that Orval's bride may need that virtue. Young is he yet; and youth in him was ever More full of whims and wanderings than the wind. Old Kinsman. Ay, our old House should have an older Head: And more than ever in this swaggering age, Whose starts and turns make sound experience seem A stubborn ass. But this wild nephew of mine Is wilder than a young unhooded hawk, And cramm'd with crazy thoughts: the flatter'd fool Of the new-fangled time's pernicious prate, Which no saue man can sanction. Young Kinsman. Uncle, Uncle, You wrong my cousin Orval! I and he Were schoolmates. What the boy was, I believe The man is yet. Rash, choleric, if you will, But not less proud of his old name is he Because more proud, justly more proud, dear Uncle, Of his own power to add new value to it: Nor yet unmanly vain of gifts the gods Give no man that is ignorant of their worth: To him all noble names are trumpet notes Sounding his spirit to arms: and his full mind Is stored with every kind of generous fuel That's quick to kindle to whatever spark Time, as he passes, from his torch shakes out. Old Kinsman. Green wood! green wood! all smoke and splutter, boy. Who was that Priest? Country Kinsman. His name is Father Adam. Town Kinsman. Not the first man in the world? Eh, Coz? Poor Kinsman. Well, I, For my part, say that I most cordially Applaud this marriage: which not only links Two lordly lines in one, but also mends What in the solid substance of our House A somewhat too close contact with the Court Hath here and there rubb'd shabby. Town Kinsman. How he'll cringe To the new Countess, with his lap-dog looks! Already is he hankering, look at him, After his platter. Country Kinsman. For all that, he's right. I scorn the Court. No king shall ever hang His key between two buttons on my back. I'll be no lackey, who was born a lord. And as for Orval, youth's a fault time mends. I like his generous wildness well enough. Old Kinsman. 'Faith, all these greatly-gifted youths begin By taking out a patent of their own For the creation of the world: and end By selling it for something they find still Worth having in the world, just as it is, As soon as they grow wiser. Country Kinsman. Certainly. And good wives make good husbands ... Town Kinsman. Good books say. And I say, Coz, a sweetheart's cream: a bride Butter: a wife ... stale cheese. Yonder's the gate. Old Kinsman. And the sun's down. Boy, lift the link this way. Come, gentlemen; we 're not an hour too soon. Scene III.—Twilight. Under the walls of the Castle. A graveyard adjoining a garden. The Castle, lighted in the background. Dance music from within. Evil Spirit (hovering low). I hear a sound, long silenced, heard Long since; when in this frozen breast The burning wells of sense were stirr'd By that wild music's wandering quest. Long since, and so long since, alas, I may no more remember when, In dream, or wake, my dwelling was Among the homes and hearts of men. Long since I heard what now I hear; My lip was warm with love and wine: Men's praise was murmur'd in my ear, So fair a woman's form was mine. But now the fiends that howl behind Command my heartless, homeless ghost Some earthly form more fair to find Than was the earthly form she lost. (Over the graves.) Blue eyes of Beauty, closed and cold, Though film'd by death, and stain'd with mould, Beneath the gravestone dreaming; Awake! and yield to mine the hue You give the graveyard violet blue, When grey March mornings, drench'd with dew, Among the graves are gleaming. Bright hair of Beauty, mixt with moss, —Rich threads the red worm runs across, When to his work he passes; Float from the grave, and give to mine The gay gold gleams you grant to shine Through butter-cups that glitter fine Between the graveyard grasses. Red lips of Beauty, bloodless lips, Whose lover cold, Corruption, slips Through coffin planks to kiss you; Yield what, to flush the graveyard rose With reflex light, your redness throws Up bramble stems. No bud that blows From these will miss you. Ho! Satin sark, on narrow bed, For a dead Queen's slumber spread, Slumbering chaste in charnel; Leave the limbs, though they be cold, Of the corpse which thou dost fold, Clothe me! Thou, too, crown of gold, Deckt with grave-grown darnel! (Over the flowers.) Woe to thee, garden! woe Be to thy warden! Who Cometh to check me? Pansy, and passionflower, Pranking your lady's bower, Red rose, and lily, shower Rare blooms to deck me! Red rose, and lily white, Mine must you be to-night. Fade ye, and fall ye! Wrench'd be from root and stem Flower-gold, and flower-gem! Deck me my diadem, Each as I call ye! Blighted this garden be, Blossom, and branch, and tree! Perish, or come to Bloom in my cheek and breast, Roses and lilies! Rest Ruin'd and dispossest, Garden, and home too! Scene IV.—Night. Within the Castle. Private chamber with a balcony overlooking illuminated gardens. Folding doors (closed) in the background communicating with the state apartments of the Castle. Orval and Veronica in the balcony. SONG (with music, from the gardens). The Spirit that shepherds and feeds The soft herds of the unseen Hours (Among life's flowers, that are weeds, And among love's weeds, that are flowers) Wherever his light will leads, As he wanders this world of ours, Those flocks of his Whose sweet food is The fresh-fallen dew of the blossoming bliss That is wither'd as soon as it flourishes:— Orval. Not yet! Veronica. Then one kiss more, my own dear love, My husband, ... all best things in one best word! Orval. O breathe not, breathe not, even ... much less, move, Thou fair fulfilment of all dreams! Veronica. My lord, Guests in the garden ... look! My ladies wait To robe thy bride. Orval. 'Twill be no more the same As it hath been, when we two pace in state, I the staid spouse, and you the bashful dame. Veronica. Dear despot! Orval. Sweet, I prithee, by the flame Of this one moment's fire life's substance prove, Then take the ashes, Chance! I have lived, I love. (They embrace). SONG (from the gardens). He hath open'd the pale penfold, Gray Twilight had woven together, Of the dim day's faded gold And the eve's wan azure weather. And the stars and sea-winds Which that Spirit unbinds, As they dance forth in light and in laughter, Loosen, each from his lair In the caverns of Care, The passionate hopes that were pining there, By Pride lockt fast, —To follow at last, Those dancers, dancing after. Veronica. I must away! Orval. Oh, dreams less fair than this Have died ere now, slain by their own strong bliss! Wake me not yet! Veronica. I hear my ladies call. Orval. No! 'twas the night-wind in those trembling trees That tremble, being near thee; or the fall Of yonder fountain, sighing for far seas, As I for thee ... some Naïad's madrigal! Veronica. Flatterer! Orval. My love is great; all language small. SONG (as before). Night is come forth from her hold: And the forests and fields unfold, Mutter, and sigh, and stir: While, to wander away with her, From their camps on the mountains cold, Cedar, and pine, and fir Are borne upon shadows bold, Having husht, lest their way be told, Bird, cricket, and grasshopper. At her bosom she bears The twin-born heirs Of all that is brightest and all that is best, In the gift of their mighty mother: Whose faint lips, prest To that mother's breast, Are fed deep on the streams Of the dim sweet dreams That nourish each nurseling brother: But, O, which is her fleetest and fairest son? For soft-wingèd Sleep is the name of the one, And swift-wingèd Love is the other. A Waiting Woman (entering). The bride's-ladies of Lady Orval attend My lady in her chamber. Orval. Ah, the end! Waiting Woman. The lords of Montmirail, and Fontlerey, Conan, and Cornuant, and Vitikend, Cuthbert, and Giles of Orm ..... Orval. Enough! go say That Lady Orval comes. (Exit Waiting Woman.) Veronica. I must not stay. Dear love, this noise and heat, how wearisome! The tiresome dance, the tedious talk! .. How blest, Dear love, 'twill be in our own quiet home To be alone together, and to rest. Orval. No, no! A costlier fancy comes in place Of that which must depart now ... to complete, And crown Love's feast-day with a final grace, For Love's feast-night to cherish. Go now, Sweet! Bathe all that beauty in new beams. Prepare Thy perfect splendour. Think what I must feel When presently I stand aside, as 'twere, From my own bliss .. mix with the crowd .. conceal, So far as fancy can, from every thought The knowledge of my sovereignty in thee; And see thee float before me sumptuously In light, by thy full-beaming beauty wrought (From love's bright never-failing source, thyself!) Around thee ... like the languid splendour, blent With balmy spices, when some radiant elf Kindles all round him his rare element, Upfloating to his native ether free, While bursts the wizard's limbec .... as tho' nought Of thee were mine, but that which all may see; Till, spent with wishful wonder, back I sink, Back on the dear delicious truth divine That bids me live, with lavish leave to think, And feel, and know, that all of thee is mine! Mine, to make costly chaos and confusion Of this well-order'd world! mine, mine the right To ruffle that calm hair's composed profusion, And free that bosom from its bondage bright! Veronica. O hush! my poor heart dreads this dear delusion. I shudder, gazing from that dizzy height Where thy praise holds me ... into an abyss. I, who am full of faults, and weak and slight, With nothing but the love you'll never miss To keep me lovely in my dear love's sight. When you shall find me nothing of all this Your fancy feigns me now ... Orval. Quench fancy quite In feeling thus, then ... drown'd in such a kiss! Veronica. May God, beneath whose gaze my heart lies bare As the unclouded summer, grant the prayer I pray'd when at His altar late I knelt, This morn, and pray'd, when on my cheek I felt My mother's tears ... that I may be to thee All that his wife, my whole heart loves, should be! Orval. Go, robe thyself in glory! Let my glance, Borne on thy beauty down the bounding dance, Glide, where thou glidest, as the passionate bee Follows hot fragrance through midsummer air. Veronica. My Orval! Dost thou wish it? would that we Might glide away out of all noise and glare, And be quite quiet ... in each other hidden Safe from all eyes! But what by thee is bidden Seems ever sweet to do. Orval. Veronica! (She breaks from him.) (as before). SONG Ere the moon is washt down by the wave in the west, (O thought dread and sweet!) Ere the nightingale, roused by the moon, is at rest, They shall meet! They, the twain who, of mortals, were taught by the Power That gave sweets to the bee, giving scent to the flower, To find in each other, what few find out, The one thing sweet in a world so sour, The one thing sure in a life of doubt. They shall meet, O where, They, the Strong and the Fair? In what hour, not of time? in what land, not of earth? There where life is delight, and where being is birth: Where the soul and the sense are one feeling alone, As the heaven and the moonlight are two and yet one: Where the eyes from the lips Drink delicious eclipse, While, in rose-braided car, Love, free lord of his own, To the fair, the afar, The unseen, the unknown, Through faint depths of dim fire Is drawn, with tugg'd rein, By the steeds of Desire, In strong triumph amain, Through the twilit courts of the orient porch Of the Dawn of Life; where the bashful train Of those tender timorous Spirits, that are The bearers bright of his blushing torch, Are waiting the will of the Morning Star, To unfasten the gate which the Destinies bar On the brave bold world, that is yet unborn, Of the resolute race that is yet to be, When the sunrise of Freedom, in Truth's fair morn, Shall be solemn and bright over land and sea, And all earth be one nation, whose name is borne, Trampling tyranny, scorning scorn, By the gentle, the just, and the free. Orval (alone). Ay! wherefore should it dawn not now, that day? (as before). SONG For the eyes of Hate shall be held so near To the looks of Love, that their light shall sear His baleful balls, and snaky Error Die, caught in the fangs of her own child, Terror. O dawn of the day we have waited long! O star of the summits we seek in song! Arise, and be bright On the bridal bower We have fashion'd to-night For Beauty and Power; From whose embrace Bring the bright first-born Of the Promist Race, The mild monarchs of Morn, The strong lords of the Luminous Hour! Orval. Wherefore not now ... not here? For some new world Majestic, populous with august shapes Of power, and light, and loveliness, begins From out mine inmost being to put forth fast Full pulses of a multitudinous life. O ye innumerable teeming thoughts, Forces, and faculties, and fantasies, That rise within me, lords of lucid stars Whose light makes midnight glorious, are ye not The monarchs of To-morrow? I have roam'd, Horsed on four-hoovèd Cheiron, reedy plains Where river nymphs rose up to stare at us, And Amazonian maidens aim'd swift darts That sung and miss'd us, as we fleeted past Into old sleepy woods. I have twang'd the strings Of Orpheus' harp, and tasted berries brown, Asclepios gather'd out of gusty groves By night for none but me. I have sail'd far With heroes in a hollow ship, through gulfs And plunging seas, to Colchis; and have seen Black-eyed Medea boiling bitter herbs, And pluckt the fleecy prize, and hasted home Outspeeding Jason's ship. And, after all These wonders, I awoke, I knew not where, Toucht by a woman's hand. And this stale world Of common life looks new and strange to me, Who find myself set suddenly, aware, Awake, with eyes wide ope, a living man, In the mid concourse of mankind ... to cope, Contend with, conquer, or be crusht by it? No! Already in my right hand glows and throbs The golden ball of empire! In my soul Already stirs the instinct of command, The godlike purpose, the preponderant will, The proud resolve, and all that makes a man! Farewell, you fair, fast-fading forms! Farewell, You ghostly nurses of the full-grown strength That in these pulses pants, impatient now For action! Let mankind take heed! There comes, Uncall'd, among the multitude of men, A stranger, native to an age not theirs; Who means from out the mass of mortal deeds To carve a mighty monument for dreams That are immortal. Let mankind make way! Phantom Voices (on the air, dispersedly). Whither, O whither, do we float to find thee? Thee, whom we chose and cherisht for our own! Dost thou not hear upon the dark behind thee Familiar voices making fondest moan? Whilst thou wast ours, Say, did we ever seek, false friend, to bind thee Faster than falling flowers Which, for thy careless crown Cull'd by our fond hands from forgotten bowers, If lightest winds blew (could blown rose-leaves blind thee?) Dropp'd from thy loose locks, in soft-shaken showers, Laughingly down? Orval. Whence are those voices? I have heard them once, When? Where? But now how changed their tone! how faint! Doth the wind sing them? or doth fancy feign The fleeting echo of departed days? What are those forms that float before mine eyes, And seem to sink into yon drowning dark With desperate gestures, and wan visages? The Voices (growing fainter). Faintly, ah faintly (effort unavailing!) Strive we to reach thee! Thou recedest ever. Where doth the fault lie? What hath been the failing? Was it thine or ours? ah, vain the dear endeavour, Loved one, but lost! And upon the midnight air we hush our wailing; Ghost, after withering ghost, Wounded, with wings that shiver, Shaked by the night-wind, a despairing host, Lost as loosed blossoms on the bleak air sailing Down from hurt boughs that, bitten by the frost, Bloom again never! Orval. They fade. So best! Lost friends, whose liquid eyes, That shine through swimming tears, from mine recede Like sad stars waning in the windy mist Night sends to quench them ... you, whose woeful arms, Yet waving, melt upon the midnight air, Whose voices I no longer disentwine From the night-swarming murmurs of the crowd Beneath me ... fare you well, without regret! If from the world of dreams I am come down To earth at last, it is because on earth I find at last a world of dreams fulfill'd In one unblemisht life's beneficence Of love for me. God, if my full soul falter, Faithless to faith so fair, my soul disown! Guardian Angel (passing above). Keep thy vow before God's altar, And be my brother before God's throne. A Kinsman (of the House of Orval, entering with Father Adam). I told you we should 'light upon him here, Lost in the admiration of himself. Rouse, Orval! All thy kindred wait below. Father Adam. Peace be upon this house, and thee, my son! Orval. Peace, Father? No! In passion there's no peace. Painters and priests have given dove's wings to Love. They err, Love's wings have eagle plumes. Father Adam. My son, Those Loves with eagle plumes are birds of prey Or birds of passage. Holy household love Ranges no further than the dove's wing bears The dove's breast from her nested brood. All loves That are not also duties, loves that build No nest, are wanton wanderers, fed by chance Or plunder; and the husbandman does well To scare them off, or shoot them down. Young man, There's more in holy marriage than mere love. And that small consecrated golden hoop Circling the finger of a wife, the vow Breathed o'er it from a husband's heart converts Into Eternity. Love takes it up, And turns it to a sacred talisman That opes to him the sacramental doors Of that mysterious temple roofing all The space between God's altar and man's tomb. Kinsman. That's what I say myself. Most certainly, Love's the least part of marriage. Look you now, Dear Cousin, at this marriage of your own Which all of us rejoice at—I not least;— Won from the wandering ways youth roams alone, Fitly companion'd, taking with you all That should accompany life's traveller, trains Of goodly baggage, troops of trusty friends, You enter here life's broad main highway, bound For where life's sober business must begin In serious earnest. You begin it well, With all the necessary furniture; Lord, as by these wise nuptials now you are, Of half a province, with a princely name. Think what you may be, should be, must be. Cousin, The king is old and weak, and knows no more Than a sick pauper in a hospital, Plagued by a dozen vile diseases, each Disputed by a dozen doctors, where To turn, or whom to trust. Last year's new nostrums Are all used up: last year's new minister Totters already: and the hasty time Wears out great reputations fast as men Wear boots out on forced marches. You're the man, The very man that's wanted ... Orval. What! to smear My white hands with the soils of your bad work, That's daily wearying hands, no longer clean, Of clumsy drudges, task'd in vain to keep This execrable heap of rotten rubbish, You call a system, just a little longer Than, if the wind blows, it seems likely now To hold together? I'll not touch it, Cousin. I will not turn state tinker,—stop one hole, And make a dozen; by a pauper prince Paid from the plunder of a pauper people, And call'd fine names, for doing foolish work, By foolish folk. No, Father, you say well. There's more in marriage than mere love: though love, If true to one, is true to all. But if I march forth to the battle-field of life Bearing love's banner, it shall be to fight Not in the rear, but in the van, and win New realms for man. Kinsman. I've but one word to say, then. 'Tis what a certain celebrated cook Said to his too enthusiastic pupil: ‘You push the pepper to fanaticism.’ But here comes Lady Orval. Father Adam. Welcome, daughter! Bride's-ladies (entering with Lady Orval). Love us, Lord Orval, for the loveliness We must restore to you; our sweet tasks done. Orval. I do, dear ladies, and most lovingly For your loved kindnesses I thank you all. Commend me to the Graces, who, I see, When Venus lost her godhead, wisely came To live with you. Master Andrew (entering). My lord, the hall is thronged By liegemen to the Orvals, vassals, friends And guests, inquiring for their noble host, With voices whose impatient eagerness I know not how to answer. Orval. We are ready. Give me thy hand, dear love. Throw wide the doors. Thou tremblest, my Veronica? Veronica. Stay by me! (The doors are thrown open.) Retainers. Long live the Bride and Bridegroom! Louder, lads! Long live our Lord and Lady! Orval. Thanks to all, From us and ours. Fair welcome, worthy friends! Joy's mouth is mute. Let music make amends. Orval and Veronica pass down the hall saluting the guests. Music as the scene closes. END OF THE FIRST EPOCH. SECOND EPOCH. HUSBAND AND WIFE. Scene I.—Night. Gothic Bedchamber. Bed with canopy, plumes, and heraldic ornaments, &amp;c. A lamp burning dimly. In the bed Veronica asleep. Beside the bed, in a chair, Orval, also asleep. Orval (speaking in his sleep). Whence com'st thou? wherefore art thou here again? Thou whom, for many a wretched night and day, Lone as an orphan in a stepdame's house, Sad as a Sadducee beside a tomb, Memory hath mourn'd! What rests 'twixt thee and me Of aught resembling intercourse, less vain Than fancy figures from a wind that sighs Between two graves? Why dost thou haunt me thus? What can I more? art thou not satisfied? Why are the dead not dead? who can undo What time hath done? who can win back the wind? Beckon lost music from a broken lute? Renew the redness of a last year's rose? Or dig the sunken sunset from the deep? Why lingerest thou, with those heart-breaking eyes? What can my love avail thee? Life is lost. Why beckonest thou? How can I follow thee? Dost thou not see Prometheus' fate is mine? The rock, the chain, the vulture at the heart! Away! (Awaking). Where am I? Ah . . . beside my wife! My wife? . . . What is there in that little word To make my flesh creep, and my conscience cry, And wrap my life fast with infernal fire, And change this pleasant earth into a hell? Veronica! . . . thou light of a lost star, Thou heaven unhallow'd, thou unhaloed saint, Thou injured injury, thou sinless source Of sin, thou faultlessness all full of faults, Thou loss in gain, thou death in life! What woe That wants a name yet shall have thine to wear? Happy, thou sleepest, thou unhappy cause Of sleeplessness. Sleep on! dream on! wake never! Would I had never slept, or never waked! For I have slept too long, or waked too soon, Who, dreaming, dream'd thee . . . what thou never wast, And, waking, wake to . . . what can never be! I dream'd, and saw . . . . 'twas nothing but a dream! I wake, and see . . . 'tis nothing like my dream! Yet thou art fair, my lost Veronica: Too fair thou art, too fair not to be woo'd, And fond as fair . . . too fond not to be won: Tender as evening air, true as a star; Pure as the dewdrop of an April dawn; Gentle, as creatures that were never wrong'd; Faithful, as creatures that no wrong can change, Because their faith is like a dead friend's love, Something that's ever what it was . . . But She? . . . O heavenly angels! Are these haunted eyes The dupes, or the deceivers, of my heart? Evil Spirit (rises). Woe! woe! thou hast betray'd me and thyself! (Evil Spirit sinks.) Orval (starting up). Accursèd be the day, accurst the hour, Wherein I wedded! Curst the hour, the day, When I betray'd . . . madman, for what? for what? The glorious bride of my immortal soul! Whose beauty . . . Fool, to think Earth's fairest face Could outface Heaven's! Veronica (waking). Home of my heart! my Orval! —Where is he? Am I alone? . . . Love, art thou there? Thank God! thank God! I dream'd of thee. My dream Was sad and strange. But thou art there, thank God! What ails thee, love? Arisen, and clad already? Thou should'st have waked me sooner. Day? is it day? Orval Day? no, child. Night. Black midnight. Sleep again! Turn thee upon thy pillow. Sleep! sleep fast! Veronica. What ails thee, love? thy voice is strange: thine eyes Are wild . . . Orval. Air, air! fresh air! An evil dream— A feverish fancy—nothing. Heed me not. Sleep, child. Thou canst. Sleep on. I'll walk awhile. Heaven's breath upon my brow, the sight of stars, The fresh cold rustling in the roofless fields Of the first birds, will help this aching head. Sleep fast, Veronica! The night is long. (He rushes out.) Scene II.—Night. A garden by a graveyard, as before. Orval (walking with agitated gestures). O fool! fool! miserable, brainless beast! What devil was in thee when thou didst that deed? Who drugg'd the cup which thy besotted soul Suck'd, as 'twere nectar, to the deadly dregs? What bribed thee, brute, to be the murderer Of thine own liberty? this double chain Of never-changing custom, whose cramp links So glitter'd in thy gross and greedy gaze That thou didst take their gilded iron for gold, And sell thyself to clutch them! Break it now Thou canst not, though thou tear away the flesh They cling to, and canker. Out on this cheat, time, That wins eternity away from all Who trust the present's fraudulent promise pledged Upon a bankrupt future! What hath been This life of mine, since that disastrous hour Which made it mine no more? . . Death's leave to rot Down to the grave by gradual dull decays, And moulder slowly! (Clock strikes from the Castle tower.) Ha! is it not the hour When I was wont to mount my throne? My throne! Where is it? where my nimble ministers, Those beautiful bright Spirits of burning orbs, Whose congregated glories girt me round With rows of starry brows intensely turn'd To me, their monarch; hands in homage raised, Radiant, to reach my sceptre's point that, where I waved, it sway'd them, as the unseen wind Around their ardent centre sways the tops Of yearning flames: so yearn'd they all to me! And my will ruled them all, like a young god. Where are they vanisht from me? What new lord Sits on the throne my vassals built for me, Waving my wand? Minions, must I return Like a repentant abdicated prince, Yet hankering after power too rashly yielded, To cry your pity, beg your leave to take My crown again, and sue back your releast And vagrant suffrage? Rather shall I be Like some lost god, whom loss of empire goads, Clad in fierce grandeur of a fallen fiend, And hungry for old incense gone, to prowl About the precincts of his perisht power, With red eyes peering into empty bowls Among his brazen shrines, and in the dark, Where no more tapers burn, crouching to catch And crush apostate priests. But no, by heaven! My spirit, that long hath slept, awakes. Still mine Is all that made me what I was—your lord! Bright slaves, behold me! Tremble! appear! obey! (He waves his arms wildly.) (After a pause). They come not. I hear nothing but the wind Sighing among the graves: and nothing see But the wan clouds, whitening and darkening fast, As through their melancholy membrane thin, Like a faint impulse through a sick man's veins, The flitting of the momentary moon Comes and is gone. Nature draws down the veil O'er her divine deep eyes, and like a stranger Hastes from me. Vox clamantis in deserto! I cry and there is none to answer me, Call and none comes. The Spirit that once plagued Saul Plagues me: and unto me too, as to him, The voices of the oracles are dumb. God! Thou art just. Thy priests have consecrated The union of two human lives. But Thou? Wilt Thou vouchsafe no severance of the bond Which now unites two corpses? (Evil Spirit rises.) Ah, she comes! Bright One, again thy breath is on my brow! Again, again, those deep eyes in my soul On their own trembling image are shining sad As stars on a dark water! Calm and pale Dictatress of my passionate destinies, Beest thou but empty air, phantom or dream, Or insubstantial vapour, the vext mind Sends hovering up from the unquiet heat Of its own burning thoughts, small care have I To know aught else of thee than that thou art; And O how beautiful thou art to me! Child of mine inmost self, that comest thus, In the last watches of the wakeful night, To tempt the father that begat thee, . . O stay! If thus it be, and thou, indeed, no more, Image of all beätifying beauty, Than the poor painted creature of the cloud And habitant of hollow nothingness; What then am I, from whose corporeal self And palpable humanity, fair fiend, Thou hast suckt out the nobler essences To feed the light of those bewildering eyes? This is the dross and refuse of a man, Not I, not anything! So let me breathe In that fine air thou breathest, . . else I die! Thou hast dislodged me from myself . . I claim Inhabitation of thine airy sphere. All thine I am. Lead on. I follow thee. Evil Spirit. I have heard. Remember thou, Mortal, thine immortal vow! Through the night air dark and hollow, Where I lead thee, follow! follow! Further than the rocky ledge Of the stretch'd land's sea-girt edge, Further than where heaven's clear cope O'er the flat sea's end doth slope; Higher than tree-top ever grew Mountain reach'd, or wild bird flew; Deeper than those depths of green By the drowning seaman seen; There where sun hath never set, Never rose hath wither'd yet, Beauty never ceased to be Beautiful, nor freedom free: There, where life is life for ever, Love, the light it loses never; Where, a bright immortal child, Joy is ever fresh and wild, Fed on flowers that never there Winter strips of blossoms bare. Would'st thou woo me? Hither to me! Night and day must thou pursue me. Come, my lover! Darkness cover All the life whose light is over. To me! Woo me! Would'st thou view me As I am, pursue, pursue me! Orval. Rest! rest! O, if thou be the exprest Desire Of all desires, the Thought of every thought, Why rest no longer than a fleeting thought, A vain desire? The Voice of Veronica (from a window in the Castle.) Dear heart, the night is chill. Thou wilt take cold. Come back, come back, my own! Without thy presence I am full of fears In this drear dim old chamber, all alone. O haste, dear heart! The morning breaks. Haste home! Orval. Anon! anon! (Evil Spirit sinks.) Voice on the Air (dying away.) Weak mortal lover, Fare thee well! The charm is over. Soon to meet, though now to part, Faithless soul, and feeble heart, Hers thou art not: mine thou art. Orval. Gone! . . . Yet methought with promise of return. And then? . . . Hers,—hers, whate'er She be! Farewell, Home of my fathers, and thou native land; Farewell, old garden where my boyhood play'd; Farewell, friends, kindred, all . . . and farewell, she Form'd for all these, only not form'd for me! Voice from the Window above. Orval! Orval. Anon! anon! The Voice. Prithee come soon. I am not very strong just now, dear love, Not since our little Muriel was born, —Nor very well; nor able to say why These faint cold seizures frighten me so much. But come, thou dearest! Orval. And my child? . . . Gods! gods! (He re-enters the house.) Scene III.—An Antechamber in the Castle. A Nurse and Doctor. Doctor. The child is a fine one—perfectly healthy—wants nothing but his natural nourishment. But you must be careful about your mistress.Nurse. O my dear lady! What is the matter with her, Doctor?Doctor. Nerves, only nerves. Nothing but nerves.Nurse. And what is nerves, Doctor?Doctor. Nerves are . . . humph! nerves are . . . (looking at his watch). Bless my soul, how late it is! Be good enough to see that Lady Orval takes the draught I have prescribed, every fourth hour. And above all, no excitement! no excitement! The child will do very well. Which is the way, my good woman? Thank you. Remember, no excitement. And the draught every four hours. (Exit.) Nurse. O my dear lady! if I knew what ailed her. Nerves? Sweet soul, 'tis the heart, I fear, that is breaking. Scene IV.—Evening. A chamber in the Castle, lighted and richly furnished. High Gothic windows open. Through them a wild landscape is dimly visible. The night is sultry and cloudy with partial moonlight, frequently obscured. At one end of the chamber Veronica is seated by her harp. Near her, an infant asleep in a cradle. At the other end Orval, leaning against a window, and apparently watching the night: his back turned to Veronica. Veronica. I have sent to Father Adam. Orval. Eh? . . . ah, true, The Priest. Quite right. Veronica. He will be here at noon To-morrow. Orval. In truth? at noon—to-morrow. Veronica. At noon. That's settled. Orval. Thanks. Veronica. And all the Family, Of course I mean both Families, attend. Orval. Good. Veronica. Everything is now in readiness. I have arranged it all myself. Orval. Thanks. Veronica. All. And made good Master Andrew jealous. Orval. No, I am not jealous, child. Veronica. Thou? . . . (ah, the old, Old aching empty end of every effort!) I have distributed the largesses: The winter cloaks for the old women. . . Orval. Thanks. Veronica. Such pretty hoods and ribbons for the young ones: And food and drink and music for them all. Orval. Ay, food and drink. Veronica. Dost thou approve? Orval. Of course. Veronica. Dear God be thank'd! This ceremony over, Our little Muriel will be a Christian. Sleep, sleep, my little one! my pretty one! How the child has been dreaming! Only see, The little coverlet is all tumbled. Sleep, My little Muriel, my pretty chick! Orval. Oh, the heat here! This house is stifling me. There's thunder somewhere. I can feel it in me. Would the storm only burst! . . Ouf! I shall choke. Veronica (after watching in silence for some minutes her husband, whose back is turned, draws the harp to her, and sings). If my love but loved me, I, What should I do? I that love him! Rise, and live? or drop and die? If I knew some way to prove him Mine at last, hap then what may— —Tone of voice, or glance of eye, Could they make my love my lover,— Should I even dare to try Such a power? who now, to move him Trying all I can, no way To win him to me can discover, For all my trying night and day! (With sudden vehemence). To-day, . . . to-morrow . . . yesterday . . . for ever! What have I done? what have I done, sweet saints? Orval! I cannot bear it. Look on me! Dost thou not see that I am dying of it? Not one word dost thou speak to me. Not one! Not even one kind look, one answering smile. Dost thou not even see what I am suffering? All find me alter'd since . . . . ah, love, all eyes Save thine are sad to see this withering change. Hath no one told thee, love, how pale I am, And thin, and weak, and wasted? Orval. (Surely now The hour approaches!) On the contrary, My love, I never saw you looking better. Veronica. Alas! I think you see me not at all. You do not see nor hear me. When I speak You turn away impatient. When you speak 'Tis not to me. How have I wrong'd thee, Orval? Thou dost wrong me most deeply. Whose the fault? This morning I confess'd all sins of mine With tears of sorrowfullest penitence To Him that is more pitiful than thou. For I have sinn'd to Him . . . often, to thee Never! At the confessional I set Bare in God's sight each sore and bleeding nerve Of this bruised heart; and search'd out all its faults, The secretest ones—that seem scarce faults at all At first, or only faults like those friends find In a loved face; who love it all the more For just such blemishes as serve to break, With here and there the quaint familiar turn Of some defective feature, outlines else Too faultless, they aver, to crave and get The lenient pity, love soon turns to praise. Such faults are worst. Love laps them round so well With borrow'd lovelinesses that beguile Kind Custom to conceal them for his sake! And she contrives to baffle our best search, Hiding them from us in our best-known selves, Till, fed on unsuspected tolerance, oft, Like savage creatures, tame in infancy, Which yet no kindness can for long redeem From their original wildness, these praised faults, As we and they grow older, turn themselves To drear deformities, revealed at last By those unflattering looking-glasses, eyes That love's departure leaves wide open. Alas! Many such faults I found: but none, God knows, None against thee! in all my soul no thought That should offend thee, Orval. Orval. You have not Offended me. Veronica. Heaven knows how I have loved thee! Orval. And 'tis my duty also to love thee. Veronica. O hush! . . . not that . . . not Duty . . . that drear word! Harsh charity which the unwilling eye And grudging heart dole out to orphan hopes. Far better buried in the grave of love, Than fed on such cold comfort. Rather say Thou canst not love me, Orval. Truth is sad. But truth is best. The bitter truth once faced, Both will be freer from the fear of it. And let the rest come on us as God wills! I have heard say there is in all our bones A humour Nature's kindly forethought keeps Hid in them, with no seeming use at all, Until you break them, when the fracture frees This wholesome juice that helps her healing hand To mend its mischief. May be, broken hearts Have some such secret balm in readiness To make the best of ruin. But do not, love, Begin to hate me now, because you think That you must love me, whom you cannot love. Only the truth, love! I shall bear it somehow. Only the truth! 'tis doubt that tortures most. The truth! it could not even surprise me, love, If I had counted on myself. But then, I thought so little of myself at first, So much of what was great and strong in you, Which seem'd to cover me and keep me safe. I always knew myself unworthy thee, And always fear'd that you must find this out, But not so soon. All seems so sudden now. I should have been prepared . . . . Orval. Veronica! Veronica. Love, if you knew I recognized your right To take back all the love I never claim'd, Nor ever quite call'd mine, you'd have no cause To hate me thus. Orval. Veronica! Veronica. Not me, Not me, have pity upon! But . . . . O my husband, (Rushes to the cradle) This . . innocent remnant of my wretched love, That never wrong'd thee . . . Think! it is God's gift, Not mine, not mine! O father, look on it, It is thine own! it is thyself! (She kneels.) Orval. Tears? prayers? Clasp'd hands? and supplicating sobs? Wife, wife, What have I said, what have I done, to bring This vehement battery of most stormy speech And fierce reproach upon me? Prithee rise. Veronica. Nay, not till, on the altar I build here To patience, all the love I render back With unreproachful tears, the duty too, That cannot comfort me who claim it not, Be dedicated to thy child, whose birth Was the beginning of my burial. Orval, Swear thou wilt love thy son! Orval. Him? . . and thee too! I love ye both. Believe it. (He stoops to kiss her.) Evil Spirit (rises). Hail, my lover! Our bridal hour is come. Away with me, There, whence thy sighs have won me! Veronica (flinging herself into his arms). Husband! The Spirit. Haste! (The storm bursts outside.) Veronica. Orval! that crash! the thunder-bolt hath fallen Upon our roof. The terrible lightning flash Is in mine eyes! Orval. How fair thou art! how fair, Bright mystery! ethereal sorceress! Thine eyes are wells of wonder! thy loose locks Gold labyrinths wherein love wanders lost! Ripe budding kisses, bright with crimson dew, And bathed in breathing balm, are thy red lips! And thy looks draw me, fill'd with music, forth In response to them, as a minstrel's hand Draws hidden tune out of a throbbing lute. Veronica. Help! help, my husband! all the air is fire. I burn! I stifle! Help! Orval. Once more, once more, That voice, though I should die to hear it! The Spirit. She That would retain thee must, herself, depart, With all things that decay. Her little life Is but a dying taper's smoke. Her love A leaf that falls before the gust of time, Confounded with a million like it, lost And trodden down into the common clay. Her beauty is the heritage of the worm; Her youth the play and sparkle of a stream Which soon the winter of old age shall freeze. I am immortal. Veronica. Orval, Orval! Saints, Save us, . . save him, my husband! The house burns. The choking smoke! the scorching flame! Speak, Orval, What seest thou yonder with those staring eyes Fixt on the fearful fiery glare? Help! help! Orval. Hush, woman! hush! Creature of clay, blaspheme not! Daughter of Eve, thou standest in the light Of that Divine Ideal, in whose image The Almighty One conceived thee, too. But thou, Even in thy mother's womb, woman, hast heard The whisper of the serpent, and thou art —That which thou art! The Spirit. Come! (Veronica swoons). Orval. Farewell, clay! I follow. Scene V.—Early Dawn. High mountain landscape. Orval (ascending). It spreads before me, opens out on me, And round me,—all I have loved, and long'd to lose The life of my life in, winning it! My heart Leaps like a river-god's what time he hears, Fluttering the cold reeds of his frozen banks, The first, faint, solitary kingfisher: And all at once his drowsy godhead awakes, And he, no blind, frost-bitten brooklet now, But Ocean's lusty child, shakes free his limbs Of their cold chains, which frowning Tanaïs takes, And hastes to find, in some bright island bay Far off, the sportive sea-maid that he loves. Voice in the Air. Hither to me! hither to me! Orval. Still on, Higher I mount, and higher: as a strong star, Stopp'd by no cloud that clings to the world's edge Where night's lees settle. Far behind me fades, And far beneath me, the loath'd life I leave. Ha! miserable insects, misnamed men, Wretchedest worms that never yet had wings To save you from yourselves, that sting each other! Swarm on, sting on! and, in the dust that breeds ye, Grovel, and grope, and crawl, and die content! For once, your prey escapes you. Voice in the Air. Follow! follow! Higher! still higher, follow! Orval. I follow. Lead! Scene VI.—Noon. Within the Church. Veronica, priest, sponsors, nurse, and child. Guests, kinsmen, and retainers, &amp;c.—Organ music. A Guest. So hotly bidden, and so coldly thank'd! Strange, that Lord Orval comes not! Another. Strange, if he Were not strange! Doubtless, he is all this while Penning some page of an immortal poem, Resolved that nothing but the end of the world, Which some folks think at hand, shall interrupt him, And break off his best strophe. A Third. Hush! Look yonder. How woeful white our hostess. . . . The First. Ay! she seems In pain, poor lady. What a wretched face! The Second. She has not spoken yet to any of us. The First. And what strange eyes! The Third. Eyes! do you call them eyes? They glow like pits of fire where nameless things, That died unblest, are being burn'd away. The First. What finely-carven features! The Second. Yes, but carved From some clear stuff, not like a woman's flesh, And colour'd like half-faded white-rose leaves. 'Tis all too thin, and wan, and wanting blood, To take my taste. No fulness, and no flush! A watery half-moon in a wintry sky Looks less uncomfortably cold. And . . . . well, I never in the eyes of a sane woman Saw such a strange unsatisfied regard. A Fourth. Humph! this begins to look less festival Than funeral. Or, if a feast, a strange one, Like Timon's last . . . a putting a good face The Second. On a bad case. The Fourth. And I that (pity me!) Declined a breakfast with an epicure Just to please Orval! The First. Listen! The Priest. Muriel, wilt thou Receive the holy baptism of Christ? Sponsors. I will. First Guest. Look! look! how those wild eyes wax wide, And flash with formidable intensity! The Second. She stretches out her arms toward the child. What is she muttering? Mark her. She will speak. But . . . . Gracious heavens! The Fourth. Aha! did I not say it, ‘There's something here amiss’? First. She staggers. Third. Marquis, Your arm! You are the nearest of us. Quick, Or she will fall! Priest. Muriel, dost thou renounce The devil and all his works? dost thou renounce The pomps and vanities of this wicked world, And all the sinful lusts of the flesh? Sponsors. I do. Fourth Guest. 'Faith, that's a large concession! First. Hush! Those lips Struggle . . . that white face twitches. What is she saying? Veronica. Muriel, receive her blessing, who unblest Hath given to thee, what unto her was given To grieve for, got—the bitter gift of life! For I, that did in sorrow bear thee, most Do sorrow that thou must much sorrow bear. Yet one thing is reveal'd, which comforts me: Begot in Sorrow, shalt thou Song beget. So shall thy father scorn thee not, as me He scorns,—for songless sadness: and so God Shall hear thy voice among the morning stars, And in between the palms of Paradise, And where the singing of those Spirits sounds To whom God listens,—and forget thee not, As me He hath forgotten. Powers shall be About thee, cohorts through a perilous land, And cloud by day, and fire by night. . . . Ha, fiends! Can all the sworded Seraphs and sentinel Saints, That stand on guard by this baptismal font, Not keep those plucking fingers from their prey? Son, have the Black Ones got thee? Touch him not! The sign is on his forehead. Know your lord. This is God's crownèd Poet! Sponsors. What wild words Are these? and art thou mad, Veronica? Revere these solemn precincts, nor insult God's House, thyself, and us. Veronica. They hold him not. Wings hath he, like a dove's, to flee away And be at rest. God gave him those dove's wings. He is God's gracious bird, that sang to us A little while, before the morning light Was quench'd in cloud. But he is fled away. God hides him safe. Priest. Lady, this violent speech Wastes all our minds in fearful wonder; frights From her chaste cells, whose incensed masonry Is dim with the pure breath of pious thoughts, The solemn echo that inhabits here, Unused to answer sinful cries; plucks down The heavenward wings of holy prayer; and kills The startled soul of sanctity. Hell's power Shall not prevail against this sign. Behold! Satan, I charge thee by the Name I serve, Come out of her! Let every Christian soul Pray for her peace. Woman . . . you do forego The reverence owed yourself, to outrage thus Our sacred office, and the temple of God. Anathema Sathanas! Vade retro! Relations (muttering). Indecent! . . . Scandalous! . . . Intolerable! She hath disgraced us all. . . Where's Orval? . . . Shame! Drag her away! . . . What devil hath got into her? . . Can no one shut those lips? . . . Veronica. Remember, Muriel! Remember, or my curse be on thee, son! For the black wings are buzzing after us. If the black fingers catch thee by the hair, I know where they will drag thee. Higher yet! Fly higher yet! Show them the crown God girt About thy forehead. How I pray'd for that! And now it glitters clear . . . a crown of stars, And every star with mystic music fill'd! Show them thy crown, O Poet, and they will crouch, And so we shall escape them. Fly! fly! fly! Farewell, my dove. I cannot follow thee. Thou hast such nimble wings, thou bird of God. And Heaven is so far off. Ah, turn! they throng Faster and faster. Save me! Guests. Look to her! Oh miserable lady! (Veronica falls insensible.) First Guest. Come away! Something hath happen'd in the House of Orval Which never should have been. Fourth. Ah, said I not ‘Something is here amiss’? Second. In any case, Our presence, I conceive, will be less thank'd Than our departure. After you, my lord. First. Your Excellency first. Second. Nay, then, indeed, If you insist . . . Third. Marquis! Fourth. Ten thousand thanks. Exquisite flavour! How do you call this snuff? Third. I had it from the old king: and he's a judge. Well, friend, you may be, after all, in time To eat your breakfast with your epicure. First. Come, gentlemen. Unwilling, have we been, As unwisht, witnesses of this sad scene. Scene VII.—Cloud, crag, and precipice, above a stormy sea. Orval (still ascending). Where is she? Whither fleeted, on the wind That whips me through this wither'd waste? Where am I? Have they a name for men to know them by, These desert steeps, . . . . Calpe, or Caucasus, Atlas, or utmost Thule's mountain-tops Mark'd on no mariner's chart? One thing is sure; That never, even in dream, I trod, before, The dreadful pavement of this dizzy path That winds I know not where: never beheld The broken margent of that savage sea That in his beachèd basin, far below, Boils like Hell's cauldron; nor yon livid peak Peering and disappearing through those gaps Of restless cloud, tormented by the wind. How horribly the huge stone's solid bulk Seems hovering in the gust above my head! Fierce as Death's altar, wreathed for sacrifice With snaky shapes that round it, gaping, twine. And what are they? Troops of pale ghostly priests, Or but fantastic vapours, sweeping round With hooded heads, and waving arms? whose dance About their dismal altar floats in time To . . . what low humming sound of surly song Comes from the abyss to cheer them? Am I, then, The victim these are waiting? the one thing Yet wanting to complete their ghastly rites? I care not. I must on. Here is no rest. Already have I cross'd the groaning tract Of thunder, that with dense blue drench blots all The blighted plain out. Far beneath me, borne About these fang'd and crooked crags, I hear Faint noises only, as ever and anon Between black sullen shores of gulfy cloud There runs, and breaks, and falls, a pallid sea Of momentary fire. Still on! still on! The few lean firs, and solitary pines, That struggled, few and fewer, as on I pass'd, To keep pace with me, all have fallen away. I have outstript them, scarcely heeding how They stopp'd aghast, dejected, gazing where They dared not clamber. Nature's self cried ‘Halt! I can no further go!’ Yet on went I, And still must on,—still on, while aught is left Above me where man's foot may tread. Still on! A Voice in the air. Follow! Orval. I follow. The Voice. Haste! Orval. Where art thou? The Voice. Here. Orval. Ever beyond! The Voice. Hither to me! Orval. At last Behold the summit! Further pathway noae To foot of man, beyond the utmost edge Of this sheer precipice, earth's reach'd end vouchsafes. Here must I rest. Here where, save stormy winds, None ever mounted. Leagues below me, wheels The wild sea eagle in his highest flight. Higher than Babel's builders ever built I have attain'd. Voice in the air. Hither to me! Orval. Where art thou? The Voice. I wait thee, O my lover! Orval. But far off Thou art already. And I cannot pass Where pathway none can be. Nor from myself Spin, spiderlike, a passage through the vast And vacant air to reach thee. I have climb'd The sudden sidewall of the world. Beyond Is nothing but the abyss. Another Voice (nearer, and louder). Where are thy wings? Orval. Already dost thou flout me, mocking fiend? The Second Voice. Is not thy soul immortal, infinite, As thy desire, which on a single thought Can soar beyond the battlements of space, And, swifter than the speed of shooting stars, Traverse the empyrean? Yet dost thou cling, Fear's captive, to some few bare inches left Of Earth's base dust? What! art thou Earth's at last, Poor cowering piece of most presumptuous clay, That would'st have only Heaven? Advance! advance! Why dost thou shrink? Stopp'd by a little stone, Scared by a passing wind! Ha, doth thy flesh Shiver, thy bones ache, in the buffeting blast, Great Spirit? searcher of the unsearchable, Climber of the inaccessible! Dost fear? Dost falter? thou, the undaunted! Orval. Insolent voice, I falter not. Show but thyself. Appear In any form however horrible! Take substance, and confront me! Leave thy lair In the loose element . . . come forth . . . approach, That I may crush thee! Dare me to the endeavour, And if I quail before thee, never more May I behold the beauty I would embrace! I fear thee not. The First Voice. Lean on me. Take my hand, And it shall guide thee. (The Phantom of the Voice appears beyond the precipice.) Orval. Heaven and earth! . . . . Fast, fast, The flowers from off those glorious tresses fall, And turn themselves to venomous crawling things, With bloated pouches, and thick-speckled skins, And fangs that flicker on the clammy crag! The Phantom. Haste, O my lover, haste! I wait thee. Come! Orval. Great God! . . . What hideous whirlwind shakes, and rends To rags, the shuddering splendour of that robe? The Phantom. Hither to me! Why dost thou linger? Come, My wooer, my wild lover, my bright lord! Orval. The whirling sleet is white on her wet hair. How bony grows the beauty of that breast! The Phantom. Hast thou forgot thy vow? Art thou not mine? Come, traitor! Come! Orval. O horrible! horrible! The sudden lightning hath stabb'd out her eyes. Voice (wailing away). Blind! blind for evermore! Eternal dark! Voices of Evil Spirits (in the whirlwind). Away now, thou ancient damnation! Thy task is accomplisht. Farewell! Return to thine old habitation, And abide in the nethermost Hell. Gone is the robe we gave thee, Crumbled thy crown: Never a prayer can save thee. Drop, though it cannot lave thee, Into Lethe! Down, and drown! And thou, dost thou shrink, the unshrinking? Descend! Thou hast mounted in vain. For each mariner shipwreckt, and sinking, There is room in the infinite main. Others, ere thou, have striven And fail'd. Not first Nor last art thou, to whom Heaven, For the profit of Hell, hath given The pride that in Hell is curst. Orval. My God, for this then am I lost—that I, The earth-born, have unearthly beauty loved Better than all earth gave me? follow'd this, Trusted in this, suffer'd for this! for this, Forsaking all, am I forsaken now By that for which all else I have forsaken? Defrauded by I know not what false fiend Whose form was like an angel's fashion'd! Voices of Evil Spirits. Stay! This fool hath yet a word to say, Lest God hear him, still be near him! We are watching for our prey. The soul that hath woo'd her is blind As the Hell that hath won our wan elf. The wonder was he of mankind, Who in wonderment worshipt himself; And still, though the idol he worshipt be Broken, unbrokenly worships he. Prate on! we hear thee exulting, Add folly to folly, and sin To sin, proud fool, insulting The Heaven thou could'st not win. That Heaven lay near thee, and round thee. Thou hadst but to enter, and dwell Content in the Paradise found thee, And barter'd by thee for Hell. Orval. For this, you unjust skies? for this . . . . Vain! vain! The last hour locks me round. The surcharged blast Spouts blinding storm. The wroth sea roars, and rises Higher and higher, as though the dead men's hearts Were heaving underneath it. Rock by rock, The ruin'd land sinks: and a fervid light, More dismal than all blackest blackness, burns The withering world's red shrivell'd edges bare Of aught save that strange horror which begins Where all else ends. It rises still, that sea! White fire, and whirling water, and hissing wind, And crackling crag, in one red gulf of Hell Confounded, and, confounding all things else! Merciless and o'erwhelming elements, Man never was your master! Unseen hands Are hugging me. And on my shoulder hangs The dragging fiend. Help! help, thou Heavenly One! Evil Spirits. Sons of the Father of lies, Rejoice! we have play'd for, and won him. He struggles, and groans, and cries: But the weight of our falsehood is on him. Round him and over him Hover, and cover him, Baffle, bewilder, and drag him down! If he should break from the net we throw for him, Still shall we know him again for our own. Our mark he beareth, Wherever he fareth: We have bitten it deeper than flesh and bone: Tears though he weep on it, Tears shall but deepen it, Tears that bewail what they cannot atone! Time shall harden it, Lest God pardon it. When we return for him so shall we find him. Shatter the spell now! Unblind, unbind him, Loosen, and launch him, and leave him alone! Orval. The strife is futile. My brain breaks. The abyss Lays out long hands upon me. Ah, at last My soul sees clear. At last, and yet too late! Omnipotent one, must it be ever thus, And ever shall Thy Foe triumphant be? Guardian Angel (passing above). Peace, wild winds and stormy waters! Peace, thou troubled soul, to thee! Pride that snares, and Sin that slaughters, Passion's phrenzied sons and daughters, Pass, and set this sinner free! Holy dew, from Heaven alighted, Ere in childhood Faith began, Brighten Faith in manhood blighted! Holy symbol, sign'd and slighted, For the child's sake, save the man! Turn thee to the ancient places! Holy angels undefiled Live in loving human faces. Griefs are given to thee for graces, And for guide a little child. From the grave though Love impeach thee For the loveless years of yore, From the cradle Love shall reach thee Pardoning hands to turn and teach thee. Go in peace, and sin no more. Scene VIII.—Gothic chamber in the Castle of Orval—same as in Scene IV. Orval (entering hurriedly, followed by servants). Where is your mistress, I say?A Servant. Lady Orval has been ill, my lord.Orval. Not in her chamber! where is she? Speak.Another Servant Our Lady left the Castle yesterday.Orval. Left? gone? where? 'sdeath, sirrah, why dost thou answer not? Speak, you staring fool! Are you all dumb? Zounds! do you know me? Am I a man to be mocked by mine own valets? Andrew! Where is Andrew?Servants (whispering). Ay, Master Andrew, go forward. Tell him thou. We dare notAndrew. (I would I were a tinker's ass! I had rather carry tin kettles than this news. O Lord, is it not the very day our poor Lady first came to the Castle? I shall never get it off my heart. It lies there as heavy as lead.)Orval. Andrew!Andrew. Ay, my lord.Orval. Come hither, Andrew.Andrew. Ay, my lord.Orval. Nearer, Andrew.Andrew. Ay, my lord. (It will choke me. It sticks like a fish-bone in a man's gullet.)Orval. So, Andrew. Art thou too in the conspiracy? Where is thy lady? Devils in hell! dost thou hear me, fellow?Andrew. No, my lord, ay, my lord.Orval. Where is she gone?Andrew. Gone! Ay, my lord. Indeed, to be sure. And 'tis there the pity of it, I say.Orval. Knave, thou shalt smart for this. Where is my wife?Andrew. Gone, my lord.Orval. Where?Andrew. Away, my lord.Orval. The witch catch thee! Whither, sirrah?Andrew. To the Mad-House. (Exeunt servants hastily.) Orval (after a long pause). Veronica! Veronica! . . . . Eh? . . . hark! Was it her voice there? . . . No . . . Veronica! Gone? gone? . . . What said those men to me, just now? Impossible! . . . Oh, she but hides herself. I should have guess'd that sooner. A child's trick, Poor girl, to punish me for my long absence. Ah, but this lasts too long. Veronica! Veronica! . . . Enough! enough! . . . Forgive! Forget! . . I do implore thee, love! . . . No sound. And surely I search'd everywhere . . . No trace! And those men's faces . . . . . Oh no, no! my God, That were too horrible! Hilo! hilo! Without! Without! . . . No voice . . . no footstep . . . no reply! The house is empty. And the woman to whom I vow'd a faithful heart, a life of love, And loving care . . . Devil! have I cast her, living, Into the dwelling of the damn'd? It was So pure a thing, so innocent and glad! Perfectly fair and good, to me God gave her. What have I done with her? Where is she now? Ha! ha! . . . . Who laugh'd then? . . . was it I myself? Mad? . . is it I, not she, that's mad? . . Ah no, I dare not hope that. It would be too just, Therefore too merciful. I can reason yet, And reasonably know myself a wretch. There is no blood upon these hands of mine. Why do they feel so like a murderer's? Thou cursèd hand! thou hast kill'd the innocent. Quick, then, and kill the guilty! (Draws his dagger.) Out, thou sharp Straightforward justicer! (Sinking his hand.) Nay! even thou Would'st be too lenient. There's no point o' the law Thou dost administer can reach and strike The original culprit. Silly lancet, all Thy simple surgeoning cures nothing. Here There is an ulcer which thou canst not probe. The soul! the soul! I cannot kill the soul! Back to thy case! (He sheathes the dagger.) What am I, then? In Hell What name shall devils invent for one more damn'd Already than Hell's devilishest? . . . And she? Where now is laid that saintly head? What cries Of horror and of infamy now shame Those modest ears? That brow so calm . . . that lip So innocently smiling . . . changed, O Heaven! Changed . . . and by me . . . to what? Ah wretched wife, Didst thou send forth, into the wilderness Where God himself was tempted, and where all Save He have perish'd, thy poor simple mind To seek me, and hast lost it thus? A Voice from below. Ha! ha! Optime! Optime! O what a theme For a tremendous poem! What a rare Dramatic genius! Bravo! Orval. Ah, the voice Of Satan still! Peace, mocking fiend. What, ho! My horse! my pistols! ho! To horse! to horse! (Rushes out.) Scene IX.—In the house of one of the Orval Family. Young and Old Kinsman. Young Kinsman. I have been to the castle, but could learn no more than that Orval had returned, and left it suddenly. I am off to the camp this evening. Perhaps when you see him you will oblige me by mentioning to him the trifling service I have been so fortunate as to have had it in my power to render him. I make a point of neglecting no opportunity to help those who can help me. And I like to show respect for the Head of our House, and a due concern for the dignity of all its members.Old Kinsman. Humph! But really I have half forgotten what it was all about.Young Kinsman. You remember that shocking scene in the church the other day—and all that has happened since? Well, one of those daily scribblers—fellows who live in garrets pelting princely names with onion peel,—contrived to get hold of the story—wrote and printed it, after his own fashion—not omitting our Cousin's name even, in one of his insolent pamphlets, andOld Kinsman. All the world read it.—I remember. The publisher made a fortune by it. Go on.Young Kinsman. I found out the hole where this vermin burrowed. And sent my valet to cudgel the rascal. The castigation was a sound one.Old Kinsman. Well?Young Kinsman. Whereupon my man . . . you will hardly believe it, . . . sends me a challenge.Old Kinsman. Good heavens! You did not accept it?Young Kinsman. Of course not. How could I? I should have been delighted to have had the honour of running any gentleman through the body to oblige Orval. But a fellow with no name—except on a title-page—whose father nobody knows, and whose mother everybody might have known.—A poor devil who must have pawned his shirt, if he had one, for the loan of a sword to cross with mine . . .Old Kinsman. Oh certainly—quite impossible—a very presumptuous fellow. But what did you do?Young Kinsman. Put myself to infinite trouble—pray tell Orval— went to town for no other purpose—saw the minister —and had my man lodged in gaol the same evening; where he is safe for life. And what is more, I flatter myself that I have not only arranged this little private matter promptly and satisfactorily, but also that it has enabled me to become a public benefactor. For the rascal, when he was arrested, had already begun the publication of twelve volumes of periodical blasphemy and sedition, which he entitled a Dictionary of the Sciences (he is one of those confoundedly popular busybodies who profess to know everything, and who really know nobody), but which was in fact nothing less than a series of insidious and venomous attacks upon Religion and Aristocracy, Church and State, and everything else that is sacred. I feel that I have extinguished a volcano. And as for the publisher of that libel . . Trust me, he will make no more fortunes out of the affairs of our Family. The man is ruined.Old Kinsman. Oh, that is your man, is it? I know him well—his books, I mean. A dangerous dog. For he writes wittily, and, it must be confessed, with extreme beauty of style. This sort of writers is the most dangerous of all. Wit and elegance should not be tolerated except in the well-born. Ministers make a huge mistake in dealing with the press. They prohibit coarse language, vulgar virulence, sheer downright stupid abuse: all of which are harmless enough. And they tolerate refinement, grace, wit, good taste; which are damnably dangerous. I look upon all these popular penmen as so many tailors, whose sly purpose it is to cut out and put together the patchwork of society after the pattern of their own interests. They desire, of course, to stitch their frieze so fast to our velvet, that all may look one and the same piece: we, on the contrary, to prevent such ignoble contact. Yet you prohibit the use of blunt bodkin, and coarse packthread, that make no way at all through such a piece of work; which needs delicate handling. And you allow the sharp needle that flits fast, and the fine silk that goes through. A mistake. Wit is the only instrument nice enough to carry the social thread safely from top to bottom, and tack the frieze to the velvet so tight, that the seam between them is invisible.Young Kinsman. Wit or no wit . . if I were the State,Old Kinsman. The State would be even more in debt than it is. But what then?Young Kinsman. I would hang all writers, printers, and publishers.Old Kinsman. No use. The stream of time is troubled to the depth, and the mud must come to the surface somehow. We must try to improve the people by degrees: for, I doubt we cannot chain it up much longer, and the cur is by no means fit to go loose. Fideliter dedicisse . . . .Young Kinsman. Improve the people! Well, I saw a peasant broken on the wheel yesterday for stabbing an abbot—a young man of one of our best families—who had kindly improved the condition of the brute's sister.Old Kinsman. Humph! You have acted very becomingly. And I will tell Orval if I see him. Anything more? It is time for my bath and chocolate.Young Kinsman. Thanks. I will not detain you.Old Kinsman. Detain me, young gentleman?Young Kinsman. Ten thousand pardons. I meant to say I kiss your hand, Uncle. So delighted you approve. If you will kindly tell Orval. Thanks. My coach is at the door. An infinite number of good days to you, Uncle! Scene X.—Corridor in a Mad-House. Wife of the Mad-House Doctor (with a bunch of keys, followed by Orval). No, I think not, Sir. They tell me there is no hope of the lady's recovery. Poor thing! I am grieved that my husband is not here. It would have given him the greatest satisfaction to have the honour of waiting on your worship. He could have explained to you, better than I, the nature of this malady. Interesting case. My husband, Sir, has been very successful in the treatment of this kind of insanity. He has given much study to the subject. Perhaps you have read his book upon the Brain? 'Tis much admired. But the worst cases— cases like this, I fear, are quite incurable. Quite. This way, if you please, Sir. You won't mind the noise? There is no danger. 'Tis only Howling Tom. A violent case, very. But we keep him chained. The lady, poor dear, is quiet enough. Pray, Sir, observe the view from that window. The finest in this part of the country. Indeed, we are very healthily situated. But the establishment is large, Sir. Large, dear me, and costs a deal to keep up. And so little encouragement! One year we accommodated no less than four hundred lunatics, and not a sixpence from Government. Some of them paupers, too. For the Parish obliges us to receive them. But that sort of patients seldom lives long. Which is the Lord's mercy. To be sure, one makes something, when the season is good, by the gardens and orchards. Our pears are especially successful. Some of our patients are vastly fond of gardening, Sir. And we occupy them that way. Only the milder sort, of course. Bless your heart, there's a young man here that is a smart hand at pruning wall fruit. Yet for all that, he will swear you by St Christopher that he is a king's bastard. But there's no harm in him. Pray, Sir, is it true that the lady's husband ran away in the night with another gentleman's lady? Well, I dare say, if the lady had been married as long as I—and that's full thirty years; thirty years, Sir, come next Lady-day—she would not have taken it so mightily to heart. In truth, she looks but a child. This is a strange world. Is it not, Sir? The gallery to the right, if you please. We have been thin, very thin, this year. But perhaps we shall do better by and by. Let us all hope for the best. That's what I say, Sir. And the Lord be bountiful to them that deserve it. Now, Sir. This way. (Exeunt.) Scene XI.—In the Mad-House. High vaulted Chamber barely furnished. Window barred. On a low wooden sofa Veronica is lying. Orval, with the Doctor's wife, at the door. Orval. Leave me alone with her! Doctor's Wife. I do not dare. Sir, if my husband knew . . . Orval. Tush, woman! away! Let none dare come 'twixt her and me. Stand back. (Pushes her out, and enters; shutting the door behind him.) Voice from the Cells above. You have chain'd up your God! You have crucified Christ Jesus! Voice from the Cells below. To the gallows, to the block, With every old grey head that wears a crown! Princes, and priests, and men with noble names, And all that's clad in purple, and wears soft raiment, All they whose feet go delicately, all they Whose lips are fed on dainty fare,—I doom. The time is come to liberate mankind, And by me only must the blow be struck. Voice from the Right. Down on your knees, you dogs! Down in the dust Before your lord and master! Lick my feet. Grovel and fawn! For, by the grace of God, I only, I myself, and none but I, Am your legitimate sovereign. Cringe, you curs! Voice from the Left. The red stars start and plunge. The skinny moon Time hath forgot to feed with sallow fire, And she is dead: and on her pucker'd cheek Blue plague-spots sprout. He hath arrived at last, The long-hair'd comet with a hungry eye, That, shark-like, swims about all drowning worlds. The great and terrible Judgment Day is at hand. Thou that art in the city, flee away! Thou that art in the mountain, hide thyself! And woe be to the breasts that do give suck! Time is condemn'd: for he hath slain his sons. The secrets of all hearts shall soon be known. Thou sea, give up thy dead! Orval. Veronica! Dost thou not know me? Veronica. Ay. Have I not sworn Fidelity to thee . . . and love . . . till death? Orval. Give me thy hand, love. Let us fly this place. Veronica. I cannot. All's so weary here. I think My heart hath got into my head. It feels So full, . . and oh, so heavy! and I am weak: I cannot bear the weight of it. Orval. One step, But one! Lean on me. All's prepared. One step! The horses wait below. Lean on me, sweet. So . . . I will bear thee. Veronica. Nay, let me rest here. I am very weary, lord. I have gone far, And suffer'd much. Thou seest how weak I am. I will obey thee, lord. But I need time. I am slow of effort, and change ever came To me unkindly, and was hard to bear. Be patient with me, lord. If I rest here A little while, I think that presently I shall grow worthy of thee. Orval. O my God! Veronica. God? Yes. How I have pray'd to God for this! Three nights and days, unceasing . . . . but they seem'd Three lives and deaths of agony. Then, at last God heard me. Orval. I am judged: and Hell begins. Veronica. And sent a sudden Spirit to comfort me, And take me out of trouble, and teach me words That can make worlds—wonderful worlds! wherein 'Tis possible to enter and escape From any kind of this world's wretchedness, If one knows how. For he is full of eyes And voices, and his breath is burning fire. So that there came a change: and I began To see those bright surprising things which God Sees, unsurprised, for ever. For, when first Thou hadst left me, lord, and I was all alone, And knew that I must still be all alone For evermore—even though new things should come To sit beside me, speaking with feign'd tones, And trying all they can, for my sad sake, To look like old things—then I pray'd, ‘O God, Grant me,’ . . I pray'd, . . ‘since all things else are gone, Never to come again, that he may come Who never came before,—the Spirit with eyes And voices—he, that on his lips hath song, And vision in his looks,—that I may see, Though I have lost it, what life might have been. Lest even in Heaven I should be ignorant.’ Orval. For her sake, not for mine, have pity, O God! Veronica. And this God granted to me. For my prayer Was strong. And on the third sad day, dear lord, (Because, I think, God wisht me worthier thee) That Spirit came: and then the wondrous change: And I became a Poet. Orval. Veronica! Veronica. Yes. Scorn me not. I am not what I was. Wilt thou not praise me, Master? Ha! feel here, How it beats in me, all this brave new world That I am Queen of! how it shakes me . . feel . . So yearning to be freed! One word of mine, One little word can loose, or lock, it fast. 'Tis as I will. Shall I not show it thee? Wilt thou not see how beautiful it is? Couldst thou have made it fairer, lord? Say no! Breathe not too hard. Such things are slight. Sometimes A breath dissolves them, as a breath begets. But be quite quiet, as it is good to be When the long, loud, and heavy daylight leaves Sore labour loosed, and the tired sense is soothed, And ready to receive in thankful peace, As best behoves, what comes:—first, a light wind, So light, that all along a sleepy land Laden with summer, it can make no sound Where it winds softly, as a harmless snake, Unhoused by some wise Indian's charming pipe, Through little hamlets husht, and old warm woods Solemn at sunset, till, to prove its power, With laughter low it lifts the loose rose leaves And lays them on the grass, where lovers sit Lonely as thou and I; and then, a star Silent and sudden, stol'n there, who knows how? In heaven just where the waning amber flame Of the faint west burns to a clear cold green. So softly, and so silently, my world Out of my heart grows, as a summer night Grows out of heaven. Only be very still, Only lean back with half-shut eyes, and lips Half-open, acquiescent as they are Whose hearts are happy; and thou too wilt feel Its presence, as a summer night is felt Rather than seen. Is it not fair enough For thee to dwell in, also? Master, say, Thou wilt not leave me all alone again Those wretched days, and long unrestful nights? Orval. Never! nor night nor day. So help me Heaven! Poor innocent fawn that by the heedless hand That should have fed thee hast been stricken down! Veronica. Nay, am I not thine equal? I know all. Why should I fear thee? Sit upon the ground Beside me, and look up, and listen. Thine eyes Are bright; but not so starry bright as those Of other creatures fair, and strong, and strange, That nightly come—from far—to hear me sing, Crouching at my cold feet: creatures born wild, But tamed by songs that lure them from their lairs Where mountain springs are loosed, or lower down, Moss-mason'd haunts where hermit violets hide; Or grottoes gray, under dim ancient gulfs Of drowsy seas, where water gods grow old And placid, propt on quiet coral beds Blush-coloured by the sea-maids; or far, far Beyond the sempiternal frosts, in caves That glitter with witch fires to welcome home, Ere the short northern night be spent, some wan Sea-fairy, coming in her flying-coat Of white swan-feathers. Others, with long hair And lustrous serpent limbs, that love to lie Low among yellow maize in a hot land, Long sallow summer noons; and some that leave Their wandering camps on thunder-paven clouds, To listen . . . as thou listenest now. Nay, wait! (She sings.) What shall the Spirits that serve me bring to thee? Wilt thou the light of the load-star, lord? Or pluckt-out eyes of the Pleiads? My King, to thee Pharaoh's chariot, and crown, and sword, Shall they fetch from the deep? Or fling to thee, Robbing Orion, his burning band? They can dive, and soar, and run, Serving me ever by sea and land: Because my song is a mighty one. What shall we bring to thee? What shall we sing to thee? Master, praise us, and prize our worth. Listen! we cling to thee Singing, and sing to thee Songs of sorrow, and songs of mirth: Songs of the winds and waves, Plagues, famines, and earthquakes, and wars: Ditties of death and of birth: Litanies learn'd from the graves: Lullabies sung by the stars To the dead that sleep under the earth. Orval. Misery! misery! Veronica. Embrace me, now! My husband, I am happy at last. Voice from the Cells Below. Behold, The days of endurance are o'er! With mine own right hand have I slain Seven kings: and their crowns were of gold, And their robes were red with the stain Of a trampled people's gore. And a hundred Priests, as they sung High mass at the lighted altar, I caught by the throat, and hung Their heads in a hempen halter. But there resteth a too-many-more. Voice from the Cells to the Left Woe to ye! woe! for the sun Is about to be snuft out: And the spent stars, one by one, Shall sink, and leave never a spark: And the world shall wander about In the dark, like a day that is done, And lose its way in the dark. Orval. As mine is lost already! Fitly sings The voice of some mad miserable wretch The unconscious dirge of all that's dying here In my life's utter failure! Veronica. Sigh no more. Why wilt thou sadden me? Thine eyes are wet: Thy cheek is wan. Canst thou, too, grieve? Smile, Orval! I know a secret that shall comfort thee. Thy son will be a Poet. Orval. What meanest thou? Veronica. The Priest, with holy water at the font, Baptized him Muriel. But I, with tears Pour'd from the wells of a most perfect woe, Baptized him Poet. Orval. God, my punishment Is just. But it is more than I can bear. Veronica. Art thou not satisfied, great Master? Voice from the Cells above. Father, Forgive them, for they know not what they do. Veronica. Hush! Didst thou hear him? Was there ever a man So mad as that? Orval. Merciful Heavens! Veronica. In truth That man is mad. He knows not what he says. But stoop! . . . Lean down thine ear . . . close . . . closer . . . so, For 'tis a fearful thing. Now, I must tell thee How it will be, if ever God goes mad. There's not a worm that crawls about this earth But suddenly 'twill cry out ‘I am God’! Mark this . . . and, soon as it hath cried out thus, Proclaiming its divinity, 'twill die Dismally, rot, and putrify, and breed From the foul dust of its dead wretchedness Wretcheder reptiles still. The sun and moon, And all the stars of heaven, that stand so fast, Will stagger, feeling God's hand loosed, and fall Upon each other, and all together, dasht Into eternal darkness, disappear. Then Jesus Christ, that loves us, will no more Have power to save us: God Himself, in whom He trusted, as we trusted Him, being lost. In both hands will He lift up His great Cross, And, as a woodman to the water drags Wearily a fell'd tree, and casts it in, And lets the torrent take and whirl it away From where it grew, i' the old time, when birds Came in from heaven to house among its leaves, Safe from the dark,—and, safe from noontide heats, The little children slept beneath its boughs, From age to age,—so shall He cast that Cross Into the torrent of departing time: And there shall it be shatter'd, and men's lives All litter'd with sad ruins of what it was. Tell no man this. Orval. Return, Veronica, Wilt thou not see thy child? Veronica. He is not there. He hath flown away. I know it. God gave him wings. He is gone to wander the wide universe, The winds know where: but they will never tell, For no man understands what the winds say. He hath far to go. And when he comes again He will have gazed on all things that God made Glorious, and terrible, and beautiful; And tokens of them shall he bring with him, Lest men should doubt him. When he comes again, Then wilt thou love him, Orval, for the sake Of his bright spoils. Orval. Woman! . . . My heart is broken. Ah, God! that change? . . . Veronica! . . . Thou ailest? Veronica. Yes. They have hung up somewhere in my head A burning lamp. And ever that lamp swings Backwards and forwards. And it hurts me, lord. Orval. Veronica! for Heaven's sweet sake . . . Veronica. Woe! woe! To Muriel the Poet! For his days Are number'd. Woe to Muriel! woe! woe! The Dark Ones have him. Orval. Holloa! Help! help! help! Doctor's Wife (entering with other women, and in great agitation). A blister! . . . Quick! . . . Fetch mustard to the feet! Run to the Apothecary! Bustle, wench! A blister! . . . I must look to the lady here. Ah, sir, 'tis you have been the cause of this. O dear! O dear! What will my husband say? How could I help it, if he forced me out? Quick, you there, to the storeroom! Veronica. Fare thee well, My husband! Doctor's Wife. Lord ha' mercy, what is this? Are you the lady's husband after all? I'm sure I beg your worship's pardon. Wench, Dip me that spunge in vinegar. Make haste! Well, this is wonderful! Orval. Love, do not die. Pity me. Pardon me. Not die! not die! If you but knew what ages of remorse This moment's wretchedness contains! how lost, How utterly, miserably lost I am, If I lose you, love! I have sinn'd! I have sinn'd! I dare not die. There must be years of pain Ere I can hope to win a grave near thine. Veronica. Belovèd, I do well. I know at last Thou lovest me. And I am dying. Thank God! Orval. Alas, that swollen throat, and reddening brow . . . . . . Pity, dread Power! lift up Thy heavy hand! Doctor's Wife. Sir, she will burst a blood-vessel. Pray, sir, Help me to cut this corset. She must choke. A knife! a knife, wench! Anything that's near! What will my husband say to this? Orval. No, no! This spasm must pass. There . . I have cut it . . see! Her breast is bare. . . She breathes. Veronica! She hears me not. For God's sake, Madam, speak! Such things must happen often in such a place— And you are used to them—you are not afraid That she will die?—Look at her—Tell me—surely Nothing's to fear? The Doctor (who has entered unobserved while Orval was speaking). No, sir. Nor yet to hope. Sir, you may drop that dagger. There's no breath Left in that bosom. Upon those lips no pain Where the last life-blood trickles. She sleeps well. Nothing will wake her now. Cover the corpse. END OF THE SECOND EPOCH. THIRD EPOCH. FATHER AND SON. Scene I.—Sunset. Interior of a Gothic Chapel. Monuments, arms, banners, &amp;c. Through an open door and porch in the background are seen a garden and graveyard (as in preceding scenes). The rays of the setting sun, passing through a stained window, between the tombs, fall in prismatic colours on the face and figure of the child, Muriel, who is kneeling. Orval is standing beside his son. Orval. Pray, Muriel, pray, my son, for the repose Of thy dead mother's soul. Muriel. Mater Regina! Ave Veronica! pro nobis ora! Queen of the flowers and stars! Orval. That is no part, Boy, of thy prayer. Thou hast changed the words of it. Think, child, again. Pray for thy mother's soul. This is the day, and this the hour, she died, Ten years ago. Pray for her soul's peace. Muriel. Hail Veronica! Mater Regina, hail! Thou movest among the holy angels of God, As the moon moveth through the stars of heaven: And from their folded wings the angels pluck Pure purple plumes, and strew them at thy feet: And over these thou walkest, clad in mild And melancholy splendour, as the moon Walks o'er the purple wavelets of the sea. Orval. Boy, boy! what is this talk? Muriel. The words pierce through me, And pass from out of me. I cannot help it. Orval. Rise, son. God listens not to prayers like thine. Alas! thy mother thou hast never known. How, therefore, should'st thou love her? Muriel. Deeply, Father. I see my Mother often. Orval (starting). Where? Muriel. In dreams. Dreams? Everywhere I see her. Yesterday, For instance, when . . . Orval. When . . . Boy, what say'st thou? Muriel. Father, How pale she is! but oh how beautiful! Orval (troubled). Doth she speak ever? Muriel. Ay, last night . . . Orval. Last night? Muriel. Methought I saw her down the darkness floating, Vested in white, wan as a star-beam veil'd In wandering mist. And ever as she flew This song she sang, which in my soul still sounds. Orval. What sang she? Muriel. I can sing it. But the tune, The music, and the magic of it all, Are gone! gone . . . gone! Orval. The words, Muriel? the words? Muriel (sings). From off the immemorial palms Whose murmur thrills, from dawn to even, The golden Paradisal calms With music only heard in Heaven, I strip the balmy branches down, To build a place of dreams and shadows, Where thou may'st sleep, more soft and deep, Than dews in leaves and grasses, grown To seed, in windless meadows. I glide among the glorious throngs Of choral seraphs, weaning Away, for thee, from out their songs The music's midmost meaning. From wells of wonder, depths of dream, For thee, my child, I gather Sweet sounds, and sights, and dim delights; That thou may'st speak with power, and seem A prophet to thy father. There, Father! There's no word I have forgotten. Only the tune was something otherwise. But all day long I hear so many, and then The echoes of them grow confused. For all Passes, so swift! so swift! Orval. Veronica, Merciless Pythoness, whose spirit, fed fierce From troubled Memory's sad prophetic springs, Still shrieks for sacrifice! Wilt thou destroy Even thine own child? Is not my cup of doom Fill'd to the bitter brim? Must my son pay Thy vengeance for his father's crime? and I Dig out my heart to hold another grave? Is thy revenge, wrong'd one, not sated yet? Revenge? What am I raving? Is not she At rest, in Heaven? These are the common cheats Of childhood's easily self-deceiving brain, Whose uncorrected custom is to clothe With mimic imagery our own crude troops Of bodily feelings, till they front the eye Garb'd in a borrow'd life, and seem to be The individual external shapes Of things not shaped within us. Muriel. Now again. Father, I hear my mother's voice. Her form I see not. Orval. Where, child, dost thou hear the voice? Muriel. Yonder, among the graves and cypresses, Where the sun's light is fading fast. Orval. The voice What is it saying? Muriel. Singing, Father. Listen! (Sings.) Gifts I bring to thee, many in one, Spirit of Muriel, soul of my son! Gifts from the Powers that dwell on the height: Gifts from the Powers that dwell in the deep: Magic of music and marvellous light, Magic of marvellous dream and sleep! Much shall be taken: but much is given: When the shade is on earth, and the star is in heaven. From the depths of the love of a mother In thy soul have I pour'd, I am pouring, Such a light as shall last when all other Is perisht, and earth is deploring That her darkest night, ere his day be done, Should dwell in the eyes of her brightest son. And the name of the gifts that I give thee Is Beauty: that never is past. For if Beauty but love and not leave thee, Thy father shall love thee at last. And thine eyes shall be shut: but thy spirit shall see: And I pass: but I pass not away from thee. Ah me! I lose the rest. Orval (musingly). Is it possible That the last word upon a dying lip, The last thought of a parting soul, should be The thought and word of all eternity? O horrible! . . . if, after all, among The blessed souls in Heaven (for, surely, she Is with them) there be spirits who are . . . . mad! Muriel. My mother's voice grows faint. I lose it, Father, There, in the light that's going from the graves. Orval. Dreadful Corrector of man's pride! hast thou Predestined, then, the child of my last hopes To a life of madness,—an untimely grave? Mercy! O from Thy feeble creature, doom'd To breast a bruising world, take not away Thy guiding gift of Reason! Architect Of this inimitable monument (Not built by hands, nor reparable here) To the most sorrowful memory of a soul That sleeps, I trust, in sempiternal peace, Shatter not what Thyself hast made so fair! Behold how desolate am I! who gaze Around my life as, round a wasted land, A watchman gazes, from a ruin'd tower: An eminence above a solitude! Pity my child, and pluck him from the clutch Of those infernal persecutors all That persecute me still. To me Thou hast given Strength to support the burthen and the strain Of fierce intolerable thought. But him? A single thought, intense as those that burn Nightly and daily here, might scorch and snap The slender thread of his most delicate life. God! God! For ten long weary wastes of years, Neither by day, nor yet by night, have I Known rest. And men have envied me my lot! And in the clumsy catalogue, this blind Ill-judging world compiles for ignorant Fame, I have been number'd with the fortunate! There is no human heart that knows what pains, What torments from within and from without, What fearful memories, what foreboded ills, Thou hast imposed on mine. God, Thou hast spared My reason, but to stone hast stricken my heart. For I have gazed in the Gorgonian eyes Of that most Beauteous Horror: and henceforth The heart is ice, the imagination fire. Father of Love, grant me to love my child! Creator, spare thy creature! Rise, boy. Sign The cross, and come. Peace to thy mother's soul! Scene II.—A public promenade. Persons of all classes passing. Orval in conversation with a Philosopher. Philosopher. Trust me, my lord! I never am deceived. When I speak positively I have grounds For what I say. And I repeat,—the time Approaches, when we shall emancipate Women and negroes. Orval. Ah, . . . . you think . . . Philosopher. I know it. The countenance of Humanity is about To assume new features. All that we behold Implies amelioration, the approach Of a more perfect social epoch. Yes, Society must regenerate itself By the elimination of decrepit forms. Orval. You think so? Philosopher. Surely, even as this old globe We all inhabit, in its progress round The central light . . . Orval. See you that rotten tree Yonder? Philosopher. Where? Orval. There. Philosopher. What? with the green leaves budding Upon the wither'd bark? Orval. The same. How many Years longer, should you say, that tree can stand? Philosopher. How can I tell? One . . . two, perhaps. Orval. And yet Although the roots be rotten, the trunk touchwood, Fit only for the fire,—young leaves are budding Upon the wither'd branch. Do you mark it? Philosopher. Well, What does that signify? Orval. Nay, sir, I know not. Save that the tree must fall, and be reduced To powder, which the winds of heaven will soon Sweep from the surface of the earth. Philosopher. What then? My lord, you are wandering from the subject-matter. Orval. I? on the contrary. I was but seeking An image of this age: an illustration Of you, sir, and your theories. Philosopher. Well, I say . . . (They pass.) Scene III.—A lonely place among the mountains. Orval (in reflection). To ashes I have burn'd the wealth of time Upon the greedy altar of full-cramm'd Unsatisfied Experience: that grim god That hath a hundred hands to snatch and seize, And in them all nothing to give. All kinds Of knowledge and of passion I have cast Into the ever hungering fire of one Intense necessity to feel. All doubts I have interrogated, all desires dislodged From sullen slumber in their savage lairs, And hunted hotly to the death; all hearts I have ransack'd: and in mine own I find Only the grave's great nothingness. My will Can wake in others every sentiment, Every emotion; but within myself (Whose soul dwells dark in vast vacuity) There is not either hope, or fear, or faith, Or love. I walk through life, as through a desert Once throng'd with cities, temples, palaces, Places of sin and pleasure for proud kings, Whose pride God punisht, pulling down their towers, Making their places empty, and their land A nameless solitude. I seem to see (Since nothing breaks the boundless prospect bare All round my barren path) . . . to see far off, Beforehand, and so, unsurprised, encounter The coming of all possible events. I have no fear, and no desire have I, That's not already old, and quite worn out. I know that blindness on my son must fall. I know the irreparably rotten frame And structure of this old society Wherein I live, whereof I am a part, Must fall to pieces. All these things I know, And, knowing them, suffer—even as God rejoices— In myself only, for myself alone! Guardian Angel (passing in the air above). Love thy neighbour! love thy neighbour As thou lovest thyself! For others, Not thine own self only, labour, Live, and suffer. Help thy brothers: Heal the hurt: and bind the broken. So shall pain to thee be token Of the pardoning power of what Pain, for others borne, makes ever Most divine in man's endeavour To reach God. Orval. What voice was that? Unhappy child! Doom'd, for a father's fault By a mad mother's wrongs, to darken'd days.— An endless incompleteness! a half-life Made up of glorious failures! a flaw'd star Fill'd with a beauteous sadness of eclipse! Faint shadow of a fleeting angel, forced To follow through a rough and thorny world Feebly, the far, far off celestial flight Of that wing'd glory, whose bright parentage Its substanceless and scatter'd radiance owns Vainly,—earth's weary traveller still, and still Heaven's fugitive outcast! Most unhappy child! Most miserable father! No escape From the revengeful furies! no surcease Of everlasting punishment! no rest Anywhere found! What is yon mighty eagle That rises yonder from the black ravine Above the monumental mountains, bright With sudden sunlight on his splendid wings, Like Glory from a tomb? The Eagle. Hail, Orval! Hail! Orval. He spreads his flight toward me. And the loud Harsh-sounding beat of his enormous vans Is like the hiss and rush of iron shot Heard through the smoke of battle. The Eagle. With the sword Of thy forefathers, Orval, shalt thou all Their ancient glory and power reconquer. Hail! Orval. His circling flight a windy whirlpool makes And wavering darkness on the dismal air Above my head. Round and around he wheels On iron wing. My dizzy brain, too, whirls Round and around. Fast, faster! on the wind My hair is danced . . . my pulse beats . . . faster! faster! His keen eye glitters on me, hard and cold, As the sharp shining of an unsheathed glaive. It pierces through my brow, and through my brain, It pierces . . . Ha! at last . . . I comprehend! The Eagle. Be bold and cruel. Nothing fear, Nothing yield. To none give way. Crimson'd all be thy career With the blood of trampled prey. Strong of will, and hard of hand, Vanquish foes, and friends command: O'er men's lives thy purpose spread: Paven be thy path with power, Piece of perishable clay! Soon man's longest day is sped: Soon the living are the dead: Make immortal life's brief hour, Be a god: create, destroy, Subject all things to thy sway! Life is power, and power is joy, Though it be but for a day. (The Eagle disappears into a clond). Orval. I thank thee well, bird of the boundless air, Lord of the summits, rider of the storm! Hail to thee from these heaven-insulting hills Whose bare and blasted pinnacles have been Sole witnesses of our wild colloquy! Whate'er thou art—true messenger, or false— Prophet or tempter—boding harbinger Of evil, or high augury of good, Hail to thee, Glory's solitary herald! And, O thou mighty Genius of the Past, Hear my heart's invocation! If from earth Thou beest, with the departed ages, gone Into the bosom of invisible God, Yet come thou back! come to my call! return, Inspire my soul with thy strong solemn breath, Prompt my heart, guide my dedicated hand, And fashion into formidable deeds The fiery thoughts that in me rise! (Setting his foot on a worm.) Die, reptile! Nature thy lost life lacks not. The eyed air Sees not—earth hears not—and the winds of heaven Take hence no record of the fugitive pang Of thy minute extinction. In the abyss Of imminent confused calamity Which I behold, beginning, at my feet, To gape for men, thousands—like thee—shall perish, Leaving behind them neither name, nor fame, Nor glory, nor regret. Not one of those Reckless innumerable clouds, that roll Through heaven's remorseless emptiness, will pause To weep celestial drops of pity down On hosts of earth's unnoticeable sons Whom time is to oblivion hastening now. And I myself? . . Before me dim, and drear, And lurid,—hewn through the time-harden'd mass Of mortal misery,—I begin to see, As by the light of battle-fires, my own Predestined pathway to a bloody grave. O thou blue heaven, that girdlest in cold peace This groaning earth! Behold, her weary womb Travails, tormented with the endless birth Of endless woes: yet is thine infinite calm Untroubled by her infinite agony! O Nature! pitiless mother! I go forth Upon a perilous journey. But at length I am about to live the life of man— The natural life, of man! For I go forth To fight my brothers. Sound thy trumpet, Time, And bid me to the battle. My spirit is arm'd. Scene IV.—After dark. A Hovel on a heath. At the door of the Hovel. A Voice Outside. What lives when it is buried? A Voice Inside. Liberty. What wakes when it is slumbering? Voice Outside. Revenge. Voice Inside. When the dogs bark, what doth the fox do? Voice Outside. Burrow. Voice Inside. When the fox burrows, what do the geese? Voice Outside. Cackle. Voice Inside. When the geese cackle, what do the cubs cry? Voice Outside. Panurge! Voice Inside. Enter Lucius Junius Brutus! (The Modern Brutus enters the Hovel.) Scene V.—Noon. An apartment in the Castle. Orval, Muriel, and a Physician. Orval. All science hitherto has fail'd. In you Is my last hope. Physician. Your lordship's confidence Honours me much. Orval. Speak to him, Muriel. Explain to him thy sensations, child. Muriel. I neither Can recognize you, Father, nor this gentleman. Sparks of bright fire entangled in black webs Before my eyes seem to be passing ever. Sometimes it seems a crawling of black snakes With glittering spots that sparkle as they glide Into a twisted globe of dusky coils; Sometimes a golden cloud: then the cloud opens, Breaks into sparks, stains, and soft colours, and all Once more is darkness. But I feel no pain. Physician. Come hither, little lord. What is his age? Orval. Twixt ten years and eleven. Doctor. Turn this way, To the window . . so, my boy. Orval. Well, Doctor? Physician. Well, The eyelids are quite healthy. All the white O' the eye is clear. The veins are not surcharged. The nerves are sound, too. Have no fear, young sir. We soon shall cure you. (To Orval): Not a hope, my lord! The pupil is insensible to light. Complete paralysis of the optic nerve! Muriel. All's dark around me. Utterly dark. Orval. Alas! Those sightless orbs are staring at the sun. Muriel. I can see better when I close my eyes. Physician. The mind has wasted, here, the body's force. You must beware of catalepsy. Orval. Anything You please . . . the half o' my fortune . . . all of it . . . If you but cure my son! Physician. Science, my lord, Has no capacity to compensate Nature's defeat. We can do nothing here. My duty to your lordship. I've a case Of cataract in the neighbourhood . . . Orval. Stay, sir, For mercy's sake . . . as you are a Christian man . . Leave us not thus! Wait! wait! examine further. Physician. Perhaps it might be interesting to you To know the name of this disease . . . Orval. No hope, then? Indeed no hope? Indeed? Physician. 'Tis amaurosis. (Exit.) Orval (embracing his son). But thou see'st yet, my child—my hope—my all! A little yet? Muriel, a little? Muriel. I can Hear thy voice only, Father. Orval. Muriel, Turn to the window. Look! the day is clear, The sun shines bright. Muriel. I see, as though it were, A multitude of changing shapes that swim Fast, fast, between the eyelid and the eye. I seem to recognize amongst them things I knew once—places I have seen—and scraps Of books that I have read. Orval. Then thou seest yet? Muriel, thou seest yet? the blind see not, boy. But thou seest . . Muriel. With my mind's eyes, Father, yes. Orval (kneeling). Great Spirit, that dwellest in eternal light, Illumine those dark eyes . . . . (Starting up.) Tush! 'tis in vain. Whom do I kneel to? For no prayers of mine Are pathways to God's presence. A Voice behind. Thankless one, Thy son is now a poet. Be satisfied. Scene VI.—Night. At the sign of the Dragon. A sort of loft, accessible only from below by a ladder which is indistinctly seen through a dark aperture. In one part of the floor an iron ring is fastened, forming the handle to a trapdoor. The loft is dimly lighted. The Modern Brutus (alone). What, if Panurge were betraying us? It wrongs my faith to fear it. But why all These compromises, these delays, these pardons? Or wherefore should he spare this man—the worst, The proudest, and most powerful, of our foes? He cannot fear him, cannot pity him, And cannot need him. Why then these misgivings? For, Orval gone, the head goes, and therewith Must fall the body at once. Well, I have leave To test this brother's truth: who should be here Already, I think. He seems trustworthy, stout Of heart and will. Why did Panurge seem To be so sure the man would disobey The order I must give him? If he shrink . . . . (Lifts up the trap-door—looks down, and closes it again with a sigh.) All is prepared. O shame! O worst of all, Mother, that we should ever be compell'd By the strict justice of thine injured cause To sacrifice to thee one of thy sons, One of our brothers! But be witness thou, Dread and dear Goddess, whom I breathe to serve And live to die for, that in all this world There's nothing I love more than I love thee; Nothing that from the deep and bitter cry Of thy great outraged heart mine own withholds, Nothing in me that is not thine! O Mother, Is not thy cry for ever in mine ears, Thy wrongs for ever present to mine eyes, Thy patient centuries of suffering, Thy pains, and shames, and injuries, all mine, And thy predestined, though so long-delay'd, Dominion the sole business of my thoughts? My heart is virgin, and my soul sincere. Be witness, Mother, if it be my doom To smite a brother, 'tis not that thy son I love not, Mother, but that I love thee More than he loved thee, the degenerate one! (A distant clock strikes.) The hour! (Looking down the ladder.) He comes. (A youth, meanly clad, enters by the ladder, which the Modern Brutus draws up, closing the aperture.) Thou art exact. The Youth. And thou. Modern Brutus. Welcome, my brother! The Youth. Thou hast seen the Chief? Modern Brutus. I have. The Youth. And hast received the orders? Modern Brutus. Yes. The Youth. The man's name, Brother? (Modern Brutus whispers him). Orval? all I fear'd! Modern Brutus. Thou shrinkest? Great the peril, if thou fail. But men that are in earnest never fail. Great is the peril, yes. Greater the cause, Greater the glory . . . great if thou succeed, Great if thou perish. The Youth. Orval? why that man? Brother, must that man die? Modern Brutus. Brother, he must. Thou knowest the forfeit? The Youth. Ay. If that were all . . . Modern Brutus. It is not all. By thee or by another He dies. Thy death can save him not. And yet Thou diest if he but live beyond the hour Thine oath, to him, made final. The Youth. Brother, listen! This Orval is not as the others are: Hopelessly unimprovable by time. Hath he not pleaded for the People's Cause Often? Modern Brutus. For pastime, yes. When he was young. The Youth. And who more loudly hath denounced than he The wrongs we all have suffered from his class? Modern Brutus. When? when there seem'd no chance of their redress. To whom? to those whose ears, he knew, were deaf. Then it was safe. Friend, when mankind began To dwell in cities, each behind him left, In the wilds, his individuality. In this, our modern epoch, every man, High, low, or rich, or poor, is but a cork Dropt by the purblind accident of birth On one or other of the mighty waves Of that most stormy sea—Society. He seems to move, but moves not: he is moved By the elemental current. As the cork Is by the wave it floats on, so the man Is, by the class that he belongs to, borne Where wind and tide, and not his own will, urge him. The man's capacity of choice, whate'er It pleases him to call it,—judgment, will, Or conscience—is, unconsciously to him, Conditioned by the circumstance of what Supports and bears him. When the skies are clear, And seas are calm, each cork that floats at ease, Loose in its lazy element, hath leave Of wind and wave to look this way and that, And please itself with profitless selection Of one or other prospect out of reach. But when the storm comes, all are whirled, and driven Whichever way the waves, that bear them, beat. The Youth. Not Orval. Ever from the titled tribe Of most ignoble men with noble names This man stood separate: and to them belongs No more than to the lowland the lone alp That from the lowland soars. Companionless He in his solitary conscience . . . Modern Brutus. Tut! In the long run, the conscience of a man Rests in the bosom of his class. The point Of individual honour is for each Fixt by the general interest of the whole. And if I say “the whole” I mean, of course, Merely the whole of those whose interests hang Together in one balance. The whole tribe Of bears, wolves, lions, tigers, have, no doubt, Interests in common to themselves, which we, The tribes of men, find much opposed to ours. But, being a man, when I say “Liberty” I mean not liberty for tigers, wolves, Lions, and bears, but liberty for men; Which may mean death to lions, and their like. The Youth. Hast thou a mother? Modern Brutus. No. The Youth. But once thou hadst? Modern Brutus. None but The Revolution. Motherless And fatherless, and nameless have I lived, Until I lived for what is now to me Father and mother both . . Our Cause. The Youth. Alas! For then thou canst not understand. Modern Brutus. Why not? The Youth. Brother, that man once saved my mother's life. Modern Brutus. Which, Son of Freedom, that man's life now kills. The Youth. My father was—a vagrant and a thief (For rich men have made poverty a crime). He lived between the high road and the jail— Lived? starved—I scarce know how: died—on the gallows. We tramp'd, and tramp'd—my mother and myself, A mere brat then—barefoot from barn to barn To the great town—to beg my father's life Back from the hangman's hand—and reach'd the town At dawn—in time to join the gaping crowd Beneath the scaffold where they strangled him. My mother's shrieks disturb'd the ceremony Which they call'd Justice Vindicated—marr'd The Majesty of Law—that was their phrase— They hailed her to the jail, and from the jail They hailed her to the Justice. When a man Insults some noble lady, what does she? I know not. But I know that every word That man said was an outrage, and a wrong, An infamous wrong to womanhood: and I know, While he was speaking, that my mother spat In that man's face. Spit in the face of Justice? A vagrant, and a tramp, a felon's wife? Off with her to the whipping-post! Just then, As they were dragging her away—I think I hear her shrieks yet—see those eyes, and see The stare change in them from intensest terror To indignation, as there came a sneer Curling the courtly and contemptuous lip Of some young noble who had lounged in there Whilst strolling homeward from a night's debauch. —I think that sneer was not for my poor dam, But her tormentors. But she knew not that. The brute that held her had a knife in his belt. She pluckt it out, sprang loose, and stabb'd the youth. The wound was skin-deep, but the skin was noble. The crime was patent, and the sentence death, Death by the wheel. O that last night of all Pass'd with my wretched mother, in the den Of their condemn'd ones! O the agony When that door open'd—as I deem'd, on death, The death of all I ever loved—my mother! But it was life. 'Twas the young noble's self That came to save us. He had pleaded for her; He brought her pardon . . . she was free! O Brother, If you but knew what was the meaning then Of that word . . . Free! Brother, that noble's name Was Orval. Brother, Orval is the man That spared my mother's life. I cannot kill him. Modern Brutus. Alas! alas, my brother! O why, why Fell not to me the glorious task? Call back That hasty word, that breath that breaks an oath! Brother, were men at peace,—man's great cause gain'd, The sword of Freedom sheath'd, her banners furl'd, Her troops disbanded, and her foes disperst, We two might sit here, side by side, all night, Praising this Orval for his one good deed: And thou shouldst teach me thy dead mother's name, That I might teach, for that name's sake, this rough Coarse voice of mine, hoarse from harsh battle-cries, To find out tenderer tones . . . Were there but time! But there's no time—no peace. We are at war, And war hath two sides only—Friend and Foe. What separates foes from friends? A name: a flag: A uniform: the colour of a coat: Rude guides, but safe! No nice distinctions stop War's brutal but inevitable path. 'Tis not a man, it is a cause, we fight, Though with the cause we strike the man. War's fault, And theirs that forced war on us, but not ours. My friend, my brother in arms, O let the dead Bury their dead! Woe be to him whose hand Is on the plough if he turn back before The field be furrow'd. I that never knelt To any man, behold, I kneel to thee! Brother, once more, wilt thou redeem thine oath? The Youth. Brother, once more, I will not. Modern Brutus. Be it so. Mine own I must redeem, then. The Youth. How? Modern Brutus. Unheard, Unseen. In silence, and in secresy. Here, and at once. Ere long the time shall be, When the scorn'd Justice of The Revolution, Now forced to hide in holes and dens like this Her sacred head, and trust unwitness'd hands Like mine to do her bidding in the dark, Shall strike her victim on the public place, Crowds in the streets, crowds on the housetops, crowds Everywhere round her, to applaud the blow! Behold thy grave. (He opens the trap.) Mother of mighty times, Goddess armipotent, whose strong right hand Plucks down upon the heads of trembling kings The mouldering masonries their slaves have built Against the march of thy majestic hosts! Fair harvester, whose foizon, now full-ear'd, Is ripening fast, large-hearted Liberty, Look down, and bless thy victim, and thy priest. Brother, one last embrace . . . brother no more! Not I have torn our bond of brotherhood. Pardon me, as I needs must pardon thee, Unhappy youth! Sad for thy sake am I Who dare not spare thee, for the sake of Her That claims, from me the blow, from thee the blood. This is not murder: it is sacrifice. Thou hast been judged. Panurge (suddenly appearing through the open trap.) And art acquitted. Modern Brutus. Thou! How art thou here, Panurge? Panurge. Lucius Junius, Wherever the Cause needs me, there am I. What matter how? Dost thou not know me yet? Brutus, withhold thine hand. Rise up, young man. I have heard all. And, for thy broken oath This once, I pardon thee. Modern Brutus. My chief, our laws . . . Panurge. Enjoin unquestioning obedience, Brutus, to me. Not against human rights, But human wrongs, my banner is unfurl'd. This blood shall not be on it. States and thrones, And dynasties, and churches, have been founded On crimes: whereof I hold the worst of all To be Ingratitude. Our empire, boy, Needs no such vile assistance. Lucius Junius, Open this door, and let that ladder down. (Brutus obeys in silence.) (To the Youth, in a whisper). Young man, I cannot save thee, nor thy friend, Beyond to-night Lord Orval's life is doom'd: His death is certain . . . save for the sole chance, The last, that's left to him . . . Let him know that . . . Flight. Instant flight. Let him know that, young man, If thou would'st save him. Hush! (Aloud). Brutus, thou hast Served firmly, and served faithfully, the Cause. Blessèd are they that hear and do. Embrace Thy pardon'd Brother. Modern Brutus. He hath yet to prove He is my brother. Panurge. And he shall. Away, Young man! Thou hast thy brother's confidence To win back,—mine to justify. Depart. (Whispering). Make haste! Thou hast not half an hour to lose. (The Youth descends the ladder.) Did I not tell thee, Lucius Junius Brutus, This man would fail us? Modern Brutus. But why pardon him? Why didst thou let him go? Panurge. Because I knew That he would go to carry out my will. Modern Brutus. What! dost thou trust him yet? Panurge. Implicitly. Modern Brutus. To do what? Panurge. To warn Orval. Modern Brutus. To warn him? Wilt thou let him escape? Panurge. Unthinking boy! How can he? If he fly, he is lost. I fear, I fear he will not fly! Modern Brutus. But if he do? Panurge. Disgrace first, and death afterwards, for him. His life? that's nothing. But his influence? That's all. That's what we must annihilate. Dost thou not see how easy it is to take This man's life? but how difficult to take Its influence from the lives of other men? 'Tis that which we must aim at. If he fly (Be satisfied, I have him in my net He cannot 'scape me)—if he fly—why then, His influence flies with him, and is lost. Then, body and soul, and name and fame, he is mine! Boy, there are lives and lives, and deaths and deaths. This man's life is impress'd in palpable forms Upon the public mind; and this man's death Must be impress'd upon it also thus. 'Tis not enough for me to have his life. There's too much of it living in his name. I must have both. I know that frighten'd hind, Soon as he leaves this house, will haste to warn him. My only fear is that he will not fly, So will he 'scape me. I shall have to weave New webs. But doubt not, I shall catch him yet. His mind to mine for mastery? . . . We shall see! Now leave me, Brutus. I must be alone. Modern Brutus (going). What, if Panurge is betraying us? Scene VII.—Night. A Chamber in the Castle. Lights, &amp;c. Physician and Kinsman. First Kinsman. Undoubtedly. Most sad. But are you sure, sir? Stone blind? Physician. Unusual . . . extraordinary, So young . . . Second Kinsman. He always was a weakly child. The mother died . . . you understand? Physician. The mother? How? . . . do you mean . . . ? Second Kinsman. Precisely. Orval (entering). Pardon me, Gentlemen, for so long detaining you. But 'tis not till past midnight that of late The crisis comes. Then he begins to speak. Follow me. This way, Doctor. Third Relation. After you, sir. Physician. I am all anxiety to contemplate This deeply interesting phenomenon. (Exeunt). Scene VIII. —A Bed-chamber, dimly lighted. Orval, Physician, Nurse, and Kinsmen as before. Muriel asleep. First Kinsman. Hush! Listen! Second Kinsman. Is he awake? His eyes are open. And yet he seems to hear not. Physician. Gentlemen, Really, I must entreat your silence. Second Kinsman. Strange! Muriel (rising). Away! away! Second Kinsman. Mark! the arms folded. Fisrt Kinsman. Ay, Upon the breast. He seems to walk as one That walks with difficulty through a crowd. Physician. Gentlemen, I entreat . . . Nurse. Dear Lord! Muriel. Avaunt Creatures of Darkness! Am I not the son Of Light and Song? Where are my singing robes? Off, Hell-garb! Who hath clad me in it? Ye? What will ye with me? Shall I yield to ye The empire of my soul? Ye? I defy ye! Never, abortive terrors, sullen shapes Sent to torment me, never shall I be The slave of him whose sceptre sent you forth! Not though mine eyes be taken from me: mine Mine eyes are still. I know where they are gone. My mother bathes them in the light of Heaven: They shall return to me, star-sighted, strong, Sun-searching, splendid with sidereal fire. First Kinsman. Mad! Just like his poor mother. Physician. As I suspected. Nurse. O Holy Virgin, give the lad these eyes Of mine, or I shall weep them blind as his! Second Kinsman. It is a melancholy satisfaction Always, to be quite sure one can do nothing To mitigate the affliction of one's friends. Nurse. Lord! Lord! that I should live to hear him talk Like a proud Pagan, or wild man o' the woods, Or any other common creature! I That suckled the poor brat at mine own breast, Ay, did I! and a finer babe was never Put to the nipple. Many's the time I said it, “Look if our little lord (the Saints preserve him!) Come not to something great!” And, O Lord, Lord, To come to this! Physician. Be silent my good woman. This is extremely interesting. First Kinsman. Hist! Muriel. Mother! Dear Mother of mine in Heaven, I prithee send Down to me images of lovely things: That I, with these, may make me, here i' the midst Of this great darkness, Mother, a new world, Like that which I have lost. Second Kinsman. What think you, Coz? Physician. Gentlemen, really . . . First Kinsman. Listen! Muriel. Come with me. Let us go hence . . . April hath gone before. I know the way she went. And we shall find Things dropt by her in the grass. Come down with me Into the dimmest wildness of the wood, Where only here and there the hidden sun Brightens the clear translucent green, and paves Our whisperous path with drops of fire, that trickle Through tender webs of winking shade. The moss Is ever fresh and buxom to the foot Under these low-bent boughs. I know a place Quiet and happy, quite shut in with leaves And flowers; faint woodbine, and the bramble rose, And freckled foxglove, cloven ivy, and loose Convolvuluses, all the walls have woven With fragrant broidery: and underneath The pleasant grass is multitudinous all With merry daisies thick as evening stars, And plots of tufted thyme, and primroses, Pale priestesses, with countenances calm In sanctuaries of rough dewy leaves, And cowslips, and anemones, and violets, And crocuses, like points of windless flames Tenderly curved and stain'd. This place is safe. An old tree holds it in one arm of his. The winds are warn'd to vex us not. Orval. Alas! Second Relation. His talk is wholly unintelligible. Physician. Precisely as I had anticipated. Muriel. Ah, they have spoil'd my palace! Bud and leaf Shatter'd! Is no place safe from them? Ah me, Again the ghastly darkness! Mother! Mother! First Kinsman. I never saw such anguish in a face. Muriel. Mother, I hear thee not. I hear thee not! Leave me not all alone in the great darkness. Oh! Second Kinsman. What a moan! (Muriel sinks back, exhausted, on the bed.) Physician. My lord, it is my duty To state the truth to you without reserve. Second Kinsman. Ay, hear him, Cousin. Speak out, Doctor. Tell us Precisely what this means. Physician. My lord, your son Is victim to a mental malady, Superinduced by a too exquisite sense, Become habitual, as I greatly fear, Of his sad physical calamity. Extreme cerebral agitation thus, Acting upon a bodily frame o'erwrought Already by the habit of a life Somewhat too studious for his childish years, Induces the condition of what, thus Developed, as we find it here, my lord, Must be call'd normal trance. Orval. Inscrutable Lawgiver! hear how glibly doth this pedant Explain thy laws! Physician. A pen and ink, if you please. We must try soothing remedies. I fear 'Tis no great use, though. Laurei decoctio . . . Aqua. . . Orval. You will find all that you can want, sir, In the next room. Go,—write out what you will. Gentlemen, Cousins, I entreat your leave To be alone. Kinsmen. Cousin, good night. Good night. (Exeunt with the Physician.) Muriel (waking). Good night? . . A long, long night! They should have said A night without an end. Not good! not good! Father, I am very tired. Orval. Lean on me, lad. So . . Let me lift thee into bed. Muriel. My sleep To-night was broken by strange voices, Father. Where are we? If I could, I would sleep again. I am so tired. Orval. Sleep, my poor boy. Sleep sound. Thy father's blessing be upon thy dreams. My blessing? Ah, what can my blessing give him? Not light, alas, nor health, nor joy, nor peace. Sleep, Muriel. Sleep, unhappy child! For me The blood-red battle-dawn is breaking. Here There is no time for tears, none for regret! Soon, at the head of a half-barbarous Handful of men, must I go forth, to cope With the mad masses of mankind. And thou? How shalt thou fare, poor boy?—sick, helpless, blind! Child-poet, with no audience in a world Of grown-up miseries! Poor perishing bud, Blighted from birth, and canker'd in the green, Last of a lofty, old, illustrious tree! Sole, fragile, scion of a haughty House Whose sires, of yore, in iron harness trod Tremendous fields, and bearded brawling kings. Farewell! O heart of mine, bear up, bear up Against this load—Break not, thou stubborn heart! Let all break on thee, till this breaking world Be ended. Sleep, my son. He sleeps already. And, sleeping smiles . . . ah, not on me! Once more, Once more . . . one last sad kiss . . . and then . . . farewell, Thou most unfortunate of the angels stray'd From Heaven! Andrew (entering hastily). My lord, the man that brought this letter Refused to wait: but left it, vehemently Affirming it to be of urgent import, Concerning nothing less than life or death Or imminent danger to your lordship. Orval. Good. Leave it. And leave me. (Exit Servant.) I am weary of all things. Life can bring nothing new . . . not even death. (Opens the letter, languidly, and reads). “Thine hours are counted. Fly, Lord Orval, fly! There is no inch of all this land that's safe For thee to stand on. The Sworn Brotherhood Are sworn to have thy life. Their hands are lifted Invisibly against thee, everywhere: Their daggers are all round thee, day and night, When the air seems most empty: and their eyes, Unseen, are on thee. Linger not an hour. One whom thou hast befriended; and that knows More than he may reveal. Burn this. And fly.” I fly? He little knows me that wrote this. (Burns the letter in the candle.) The Nurse. My lord, the Doctor asks your presence. Orval. I come. Rest by the boy. And watch him well. He sleeps. . . . . Rather to arms at once! to arms! Arise, Arise, mine eagle! Havoc calls. I come. END OF THE THIRD EPOCH. FOURTH EPOCH. MAN AND MAN. Scene I.—Night. Interior of a subterranean Cellar; filthy, and ill-lighted by a lanthorn swung from the vaulting. Along the walls pistols and cutlasses suspended. On the floor broken wine-flasks and empty barrels strewn about. In the midst, under the lanthorn, a rude table. Thereon a greasy volume open: pens, ink in a broken wine-glass, and a large earthen bowl smeared over the edges with blood. On a sort of altar, a skeleton gorgeously robed and crowned. Tapers burning before it. Between the altar and the table a small high platform, covered with crimson cloth, and canopied in black. On the platform is seated the President of the Secret Society of The Avengers. Before him, at the foot of the platform, a Novice, kneeling, with hands bound, breast bare, and marks of blood upon it. The rest of the Brotherhood is grouped around the Novice. The President. And to maintain inviolate secrecy. The Novice. I swear. So help me God! President. Citizen Novice, Thy tongue trips. Have a care. There is no God. We have deposed him. He was in our way, For, being a tyrant, he made common cause With the other tyrants. Bring the symbol forth Of brutish Superstition. (One of the brethren brings forward a crucifix.) Man, behold The no-more-to-be-tolerated badge Of thy past degradation. Spit on it. Novice. Citizen Atheist, I obey. President. Remove it. He hath saved his throat. The Brother. Back to thy tomb, defunct Divinity! The President. To spare not man, nor woman, Against whose life the edict hath gone forth. Novice. I swear. President. To execute, without remorse, Without reluctance, and without delay, Whatever order shall be given to thee. Novice. I swear. The President. Upon all persons, old or young, Or high or low, or great or small, or here Or elsewhere, nobles, prelates, princes, kings, Or those that do adhere to the same. Novice. I swear. President. And to observe the aforesaid laws to the death. Novice. I swear. President. He hath pass'd the triple ordeal. Enter his name upon the Books. A Brother (writing). Josiah Cobble. Eyes grey, small. Hair red. Stature low. Age four and twenty years. Former condition, Maker of boots and shoes in the employ Of the Enemies of Human Freedom. Sworn A Brother of the Secret Philosophical And Philanthropical Society Of the Avengers: sitting in this city On the First Day of the Second Month o' the Year One, of the General Emancipation. Enter'd. President. Unbind his hands. Give him the bowl. Rise, Brother, and embrace thy brethren. Drink. Chorus of the United Brotherhood. Press the grapes of the vintage of vengeance. Thine, Young vintager, now is the vineyard gate. And drink, Son of Freedom, the blood and the wine: The wine of the wanton, the blood of the great! Fallen thy bonds are. Behold, we have burst them. Laugh! Not on nectar the old gods nurst The growth of the young gods, who have disperst them: And stronger than nectar, to quench our thirst, Is the cup of the curses wherewith we have curst them By whom we were curst. Feed on the flesh of the princes of earth. Let it fatten thee now, as our own fatten'd them. There be plenty of bones, and of blood no dearth: And these dishes are garnisht with gold and gem. Sign'd are the lintels, and sharpen'd the daggers. The powerless strikes, and the powerful staggers. The halters are spun. Judged are the judges: rod-beaten the lictors: Tried the tribunals: and vanquisht the victors: The heads are all reckon'd: the headsman is beckon'd: Our work hath begun. (A knocking without.) President. Back to your places, all of you! Remove Those weapons. Each man to his work again. Who knocks? A Voice Outside. A friend, and Freedom's Son. President. His name? The Voice. Lucius Junius. President. 'Tis the Modern Brutus! Salute him, Brothers. Open in the name Of Liberty. Hail to thee, Lucius Junius! (The Modern Brutus enters.) Omnes. Brutus, thy brethren here, in thee, salute The soul of Rome's best Roman. Brutus. Good, friends, good! I see that you are sharpening your knives Ready for use. Good, good! Be all prepared. What art thou making, Brother Citizen? One of the Brethren. A hempen rope. Brutus. Good! He that 'scapes the steel Must hang by the cord. And thou? Another. I stole this knife Out of the kitchen of an old Archbishop. And it has sliced him many an ortolan. I am giving it a new handle, and an edge. Brutus. Good, good! Some throats are easier cut than capons. And thou? A Third. This is the fowling-piece with which The keeper of my lord shot my boy, Jack, For having stolen a hare. The man had this When, last night, I shot him. I took it from him. It is a keepsake. I am giving it A new lock. Brutus. Good, good! There be other vermin Than hares that now need thinning. Keep the gun. President. But tell us, Brother Citizen, is the day Fixt yet? Brutus. Oh patience, Citizen President! I want a man of you. Which is the idlest? Or which the boldest? President. There's a novice here That hath not yet been tried. Wilt thou have him? He took the oath but even now. Brutus. Good, good! Follow me, Brother Novice. Novice. I obey. Scene II.—Noon. The Revolutionary Camp. Within the Tent of Panurge. Citizens armed, standing sentry. Shouting without. Panurge (entering the tent). How many hundred brainless brutes have howl'd Hurrah to every word that from my lips Hath fallen just now! What one of all them Divined my simplest meaning, comprehended The plainest of my purposes, or caught The faintest glimmer of the goal to which My will is leading them? O fervide Imitatorum pecus! (The Modern Brutus enters with the Novice.) Is it the man? Brutus. Ay. Panurge. Dost thou know Lord Orval? Novice. Know him? Yes, By sight, great Citizen. He once spoke to me. Panurge. In truth? what said he? Novice. At the Church door once, Meaning no harm, I brusht him as I pass'd. He turn'd, and kick'd me, adding, with an oath, “Out of my way, hound!” I have made a rope To hang him with. 'Tis ever in my pocket. Panurge. To-morrow thou wilt go to him, at daybreak: And say to him that I intend to see him; That I will visit him at midnight, tell him, Alone—in private—without witnesses. Novice. Citizen General, how many men Do you propose to give me? Panurge. Not a man. Novice. There will be danger. With no escort ... Panurge. Man, Thine escort is Panurge's name. Alone Thou must approach him. Novice. I obey. Panurge. And tell him, For certain, that to-morrow—at midnight— I shall be with him. Novice. And if he should hang me? Panurge. Thou wilt have had the honour, then, to perish A martyr to the People's Cause. Novice. Long live The People's Cause! .. (The devil take 'em all!) Panurge. And now good day, good Citizen. Depart. Forget not. Novice. Citizen General, I obey. (Exit.) Brutus. Why these half measures, these delays, Panurge? Or to what end these midnight meetings with The People's foes? these parleyings with a man Like Orval? Had I but thy sanction then When I besought it, Orval at this hour Had not been living. And that snare of thine To catch him flying hath fail'd egregiously. Flight? he is in the field against us now, First, foremost, and sole formidable foe! Panurge, when I vow'd to follow thee, To admire thee, to obey thee—when I made Thee master of my mind,—it was because I then believed thee master of thine own: A man of keen eye and sure hand: a man Of one aim, and one blow. Panurge. Peace, prattler, peace! Brutus. All is in readiness. The arms are forged, The cannon cast, the powder magazined, And the battalions drill'd, and the lists drawn. Our troops wait only for the word to move. The lightnings and the thunders of our power Vibrate impatient in thy slack right hand. Speak the word only, and the thunder falls. Panurge. Rash boy! thy hot brain and o'erweening youth Know not the majesty of restraint. Mistake not Impulse for power. Brutus. Nay, think, Panurge! think! Already these amazed aristocrats Terrified, trembling, fly like a tame herd That scents the unseen lion. Abandoning To desolation their doom'd palaces, And paper-palisaded castles all, They have assembled their unscatter'd strengths In the firm-mason'd Fastness of St. John. We with our legions need but flood the land To overwhelm them in their last retreat. Our dogs might in a day destroy such rabbits In such a warren. Give the word. Panurge. Not yet. What need of haste? Their doom is sure. Effete Both morally and physically, weak Old toothless lapdogs whelp'd by Luxury, Nature, the hardy mother of brave men, Spurns them with loathing from her wholesome lap. And, whether it be to-morrow or to-day That we exterminate the litter, boy, It matters not the weight of a hair. Go to. I know my hour. Brutus. What daunts thee, then? Panurge. Nought daunts me. I am but the Doomsman. Nature is the Judge. Brutus. Albeit, when Nature's voice cries to thee “Strike!” What stays thy laggard hand thus? Panurge. Mine own will: Thy master, Lucius, Junius, Brutus. Brutus. Psha! Thy will? who knows? Thy whim, more like. And I, Whose hand hath smitten upon their guilty thrones The consecrated tyrannies of time, Whose knee was never crook'd to man or God, Who fear no consequence, and spare no foe, Am I to follow blindly the blind guidance Of thy dark brain? Panurge. Blindly. It is thine oath. Brutus. Thou art betraying us, Panurge! Panurge. Tush! Mistrust is the hobgoblin of weak minds. For there where ignorance doth a darkness make, Any old broomstick serves to make a fear. But have a care. Speak not so loud, young man. Some of my folk might hear thee. Brutus. Of thy folk? Our folk! We have no spies here. And what then? My speech is my true heart's ambassador That scorns disguise, and boldly goes his way To challenge Falsehood where he finds her. Man, What if our folk do hear my voice? Panurge. Why, then I shall be forced to have thee shot, for daring To raise it in my presence. (With sudden tenderness). Trust me, boy. Have patience. Brutus (with emotion). Pardon! I forgot myself. But (earnestly), Chief, I fear not death in any form. And if my death be necessary, if My death can help or serve the People's Cause, Serve only, even, for salutary example, Speak! I am ready to die. Panurge. (An ardent mind! This man believes and hopes. It is a pity That such a happy man should ever die. Earth hath too few of his thrice fortunate kind, And cannot profitably spare what she So rarely is possest of.) Boy, think more. Speak less. Grow older. Live. And in good time Thou wilt be able to understand ... Delay. Are the new cartridges distributed? Brutus. Yes. Panurge. Dost thou know no more of this Lord Orval? Brutus. No. Why? In truth, I care to know no more Than is already known of that bad man. Panurge. He hath assembled all his vassals. And they Are faithful to him. They believe in him. They follow him, and still look up to him. Brutus. A handful of born slaves! It is in us, Faith's true force is incarnate. Panurge. I would see him— With mine own eyes ... hear him—with mine own ears— Not thine ... and read the soul of this strange man. Too proud he is! too proud. Pride must be humbled. He should be one of Us. Brutus. He? One of us? He, the aristocrat! Panurge. No. He, the poet. You understand not. Leave me. Brutus. Am I pardon'd, Citizen General? Panurge. Boy, wert thou not ... But go! Leave me. Thy life belongs to the Good Cause. I charge thee keep it safe. Boy, thine own hand Shall plant the People's Flag upon the towers And rooftops of the Fastness of St John. Now leave me. Brutus (going). Truly, he is a great man. How could I doubt him? Out, base heart! (Exit). Panurge (alone). Ay, Orval! It must be with mine own eyes only, and only In thine own face, that I the riddle read Writ by the Destinies for thee and me. Strange, that this man, alone of all the world, Dares to resist me! What, compared to mine, Is this man's strength? Nothing, It cannot weigh A dozen grains of sand i' the scale. Some few Raw boors, and stupid serfs, that follow yet The blazoned boast of his affronting flag, With that blind instinct of fidelity That's ever in tame creatures. Nothing more. Why do I wish to see, to hold discourse With this one man? Hath my own spirit now been Confronted, for the first time, with its peer? Perchance its rival? ... I must crush—shall crush him. But then? ... O thou mysterious Power of Thought, That in me sittest, weaving webs to catch The buzzing folly of this brief fly, man! Easier shalt thou deceive all human kind Than thine own self. What? Art thou not the thought Of earth's unthinking millions? the bright soul O' the brute material multitude? And thou, Doubtest thou of thyself? What were but crime In others, is, in thee, completed law, Power fulfill'd and perfect. Thou hast given A name to nameless masses of mankind, A language to dumb droves of beasts of burden, A soul to soulless human engines,—call'd Forth out of formless chaos, and created A whole world's manifest fabric in the form And image of thyself, and breathed into it A motion and a light. But thou thyself, O soul, what art thou? shapeless? doubting? dark? Uncertain of the goal to which thou goest? Nay then, I swear it, soul, thou art sublime! Scene III.—Sunset, which deepens towards the close of the scene. The Forest. Booths, tents, canvas encampments. Torchfires, and wandering lights among the distant trees. A space cleared in the midst, with a rude gallows erected. Men and women dancing round it. Various groups passing over the foreground. Orval and The Novice. Orval advances, holding the Novice by the hand, who follows reluctantly. Orval is enveloped in a long mantle, and wears the Cap of Liberty. Orval. Remember! Novice. On my life, my lord, I swear it! I will return you safely—if myself Do 'scape the perils you have put upon us By this most desperate venture. Orval. Glance of eye, Or turn of head, and at my foot thou liest, A bullet in thy scull. Sir, I am arm'd. And,—mark me!—I am risking my own life,— Thine hath for me less value than a dog's. Novice. Hi! ... You will crush my wrist-bone! Zounds, my lord, Your hand hath iron claws! How must I serve you? Orval. Address me as a comrade—newly come. What are those—dancing yonder? Novice. Round the gallows? That is the new dance of the Libertines,— Freedom's bolero. Orval. On, then! let us see it. Chorus (of men and women, half naked, dancing round the gallows in caps of Liberty). Bread to eat! bread to eat! Or we will have heads to gnaw. We have cook'd the cooks that cook'd the meat, And so we must eat it raw. Hourrah! For, that men should starve while there's flesh to carve, Is neither logic nor law, Hourrah! Kings have had no pity on us: Dance about the gallows! Priests have had no pity on us: Dance! dance, good fellows! God hath had no pity on us: Dance about the gallows! Down, then, with God, and with Priests, and Kings! Enough, and too much have we had of these things! Dance, dance, good fellows! Orval (to a girl dancing). Wench, I rejoice to see thee step so brisk. Thy leg is stockingless,—but, 'faith! 'tis stout, And jigs it bravely! The Girl (dancing). God a' mercy, man! This day hath kept us waiting long enough. All my life long have I wash'd dishes up, And scour'd floors,—ay, with never a good word, Never a Thank-ye! Only cuffs and kicks, And offal, when the dogs had had enough. Damnation! it is time for me to feed When I am hungry, sleep when I am tired, And dance when the whim takes me! Orval. Dance, girl! dance! Novice. The devil on it, we must budge, my lord, Or you will be discover'd. Orval. If I am, 'Twill be the worse for thee. Come further on. What have we yonder? Novice. By the oak-stump? Orval. Ay. Novice. That is the Lackeys' Club. Orval. Why then, no doubt, We shall find old acquaintances this way. Novice (aside). Ten thousand ducats to be out o' the wood! This man is mad! First Lackey. Yes, friend: I had the honour To slit my master's throat last night. Second Lackey. Fine fellow! Your health. I'm looking for my Baron still. A Valet. Citizens, pray let us admire ourselves! Already—long ago—whilst blacking boots, Even till our backs grew crookèd,—long ago, Whilst curling wigs, and powdering noble pates, Even till our own wax'd bald, ... we felt within us The glorious consciousness of our own rights. Not vainly, have we stood behind the chairs Of sage Philosophers, and heard them talk: Whilst stirring up the chocolate we served them, They stirr'd in us the philosophic soul! Not vainly, by the tables of the great Have we been watchers: secrets, grudged to kings, Slipp'd out to us. And truly, if we cringed To carry the bread-basket up and down, Whilst for the banquet we did count out loaves, We for the scaffold then were counting heads. Ay! and if, when we pour'd the wine, we smiled, It was because the wine began to smell Already like the blood it was enriching For us to taste hereafter! Drink, then, all, Drink, Citizens, with me ... health to our Club! Chorus of Lackeys. Health to our Club! and to our President! For he is a Philosopher. Drink death To all our Masters! Live Philosophy! Live Freedom, and the Rights of Man! The Valet. My friends, I thank you,—with emotion, not unworthy The generous sentiments you have express'd. Chorus of Lackeys. Broken! broken are the bonds of servile duty! Burst at length in man's supreme emancipation! From the boudoirs, perfumed sweet, of painted Beauty, From the languid-lighted halls and haunts of Fashion, From the satin-circled walls and scented ambers Of the sleek and whisper-swarming antechambers Of dethronèd Royalty, And the primly-paced saloons of Art and Science, We together are come forth to hurl defiance On the victor-voice of Freedom, freely, under the free sky, At the doors where courtiers cringe, Slaves to every creaking hinge, Creatures to a golden key, and students of a lie! Semi-chorus. And the statesman, with his scheme Of little frauds to cheat the state: Second Semi-chorus. And the poet with his theme Of little flatteries to the great: First Semi-chorus. And the soldier, o'er his sword Ducking to the slave he serves: And the king, whose kingly word Shifts each way his terror swerves! Second Semi-chorus. And the dainty Dame of Honour With the badge of shame upon her! Chorus. We have seen, and we can tell All that's hid 'twixt Heaven and Hell! First Semi-chorus. What was whisper'd shall be shouted! What was trusted shall be doubted! What was honour'd shall be scouted! Second Semi-chorus. What was unknown all shall know! What was high shall then be low. For such secrets blood must flow. Chorus. Ay, such filth to be wash'd clean, Blood shall flow of King and Queen. Such strange sickness needs strange cures. This is our Credo. What is yours? Orval. Excellent company! Why these are men Of rarest information,—full of matter! What are those voices from the hill, that sound Like wild beasts howling? Novice. 'Tis the Butcher's Club. Chorus of Butchers. Hatchet and axe Shall pay no tax To any king on his throne, Whilst bones and blood Are the People's food, So keep ye the blood and the bone, Hah ha! Keep ye the blood and the bone! We are The Jolly Butchers, we: Our purple palace the shambles be. Hither, good fellows, and sing with me, Merrily, merrily sing;— Cutting of throats is a rare good trade! For love, or for money—'tis all one thing. And it matters not if the knife be laid To the throat of a calf or a king, Hah ha! For a calf will bleed like a king! We are the children of Strength and Blood: And we know what blood and strength can do. It is we that find the People food. Though the kings provide for the business too. To every man his due, my friend, To every man his due! For the kings we have slaughter'd the calf and ox: For the People we slaughter the kings. While there's flesh in the shambles or blood on the blocks, The Jolly Butcherman sings, Hah ha! The Jolly Butcherman sings: Hatchet and axe Shall pay no tax To any king on his throne: For bones and blood Are the People's food, So keep ye the blood and the bone, Hah ha! Make much of the blood and the bone! Orval. I like these fellows better. They, at least, Have grace to leave Philosophy alone, And spare us that vile cant, that sickens me, Of Freedom, and Enlightenment, and so forth. Madam, your Humble Servant! Novice. You forget! Pray call her Citizen, or Freedom's Daughter, Or else Emancipated Bondswoman. You will destroy us with your old-world titles. As you love life, be careful! The Woman. Madam, quotha? What is this fellow? Fy! O thou dost stink Most villanous strong, methinks, of the old leaven! Orval. 'Faith! my tongue tripp'd then. The Woman. Man, I am as thou. A woman—free—unfetter'd—independent! My favours I distribute without stint To that society whence I derive The rights I exercise in doing thus. To all free men, freely, I give my love. Hark! .... an' thou hadst not such a frosty eye .... Thou art a sturdy knave .... I like thee well.... Kiss! Orval. And, pray, hath this same society Given thee also, worthiest of women, These jewels? that gold bracelet? those pearl earrings? O most exceeding generosity! O rare, beneficent Society! The Woman. This trash? ... and yet 'tis pretty .... truly, pearls Suit well enough this sort of hair! ... Nay, these Were given me by my husband—I would say My enemy—the enemy of Woman— The enemy of Liberty and Love— In the old days, ere I enjoy'd my freedom. Husbands are Man's and Woman's Enemies! Orval. Freest of women, verily I wish thee An infinite enjoyment! (They pass on.) Knowest thou Who is yon soldier, leaning all alone, I' the rocky ground, against the blasted oak? How doth he eye the setting sun! Novice. He yonder? Oh, he is Fortune's soldier. Brave enough! But yet—a hireling. I do know the man. The Revolution hath employ'd him thrice In divers foreign countries. He hath won Nine battles—taken seven towns ... Good eve, General Castrocaro! What! already Planning campaigns? some new design a-foot? The Soldier. Fools! Though in Freedom ye may be my brothers, In Genius ye are not my kindred. Go! My plans are known but by the victories Which they achieve. Disturb me not. Away! Orval. Hark ye! Take my advice. Hang up that fellow. Hang him to-night. This, trust me, is the stuff That makes an Aristocracy. A Weaver. Too late! Curses, and maledictions! Orval. What is this? Novice. No beggar, or he would be better clothed. Orval. What dost thou there in the rank ditch, poor wretch? Why, how now? Look! there is not so much skin Upon this mummy, sir, as would suffice To cover the whole compass of thy valour! Weaver. Curses, and maledictions! Curse, and curse, And curse, again, the Merchants of the Earth! Orval. This knave is strong in the arithmetic. Hark, how he adds and multiplies! And yet Methinks he doth repeat himself too oft. Weaver. Accursèd be the Merchants of the Earth! For they have suck'd the life-blood out of me. My fairest years—the years when other men Wander about the free and happy fields, In blissful hand-in-hand with her they love, And breathe the blessèd air, and the fresh flowers, Till they bless God that they are young, and live, And do enjoy the joyfulness of living, I evermore was weaving my death-shroud At their rapacious and remorseless looms; Coffin'd alive in their damn'd factories! Orval. Drink, then, the cup thou clutchest in thy hand. The wine will yet refresh thee. Weaver. Late! too late! I have no strength to lift it to my lips. I have crawl'd here to die. Alas! for me The Day of Freedom dawns too late. I curse The Merchants of the Earth that do sell silk! Ay, and the Princes of the Earth that wear it! I curse the Trader, for he buys men's bodies! I curse the Courtier, for his glossy coat Is woven from the fibre of men's lives! Curses, and maledictions! curses, curs— .... (He dies.) Novice. Pah, what a hideous corpse! It stinks already. Orval. Look on this carrion, miserable hound! Where now be your big-mouthèd promises? Where be your virtues? your philosophies? What now? the dust hath claim'd fraternity With your free brother. Warn the worm away, Lest he make free with this starved inch of Freedom; For he is Nature's tyrant; and it seems He loves a savoury meal. Come, Citizen, And study here the perfect state of man! The Emancipation of the Human Race! Novice (aside). Insolent Noble! may thy carcase too Rot ere 'tis older, and the dogs devour it! (Aloud). My lord, we must away! The sun hangs low. And I am sworn to give account this night To him that sent me, of my mission. Orval. Hold! I have a fancy to see more of this. March! march, sir! A Voice from the Trees. Son of Freedom, bid good-night To the old Sun! Another Voice from the Forest. Good-night to thee, old tyrant! I do salute thee with a parting curse. Long while hast thou our hard taskmaster been. Long hast thou driven us to labour, forth From stall and shed,—to sweat, and still to groan; Thou only smiling from thy golden chair Up yonder, evermore the same damn'd smile. To-morrow shalt thou find thy slaves set free. Now to the devil with thee! off! give place To the Dark Hour, our friend. Novice. Here comes a band Of peasants. We must draw aside, my lord, Or we shall be accosted. Peasants (passing). Forwards, friends! Yonder, among the booths, the girls are dancing. What fun! d'ye hear the fiddle squeak? up yonder There's beer and wine, and cakes, and junketing. And there our friends are roasting for us all The oxen from the plough! Hourrah! hourrah! A Girl's Voice from the Crowd. March! march, old guts! This is a lazy lord. Kick him up, wooden-shoes! That's right. Voice of a Noble. Good friends, Mercy! I am an old man. Mercy! mercy! A Man's Voice. The more sins, then, hast thou to answer, grey-beard! Yah-ha! Oh, Kate hath got him. Take her off. There's ne'er a terrier hath a sharper tooth Than Kate. She'll kill him! The Noble's Voice. Friends, if you would hear me! A Girl's Voice. Give back my lover's blood, my father's curse! A Man's Voice. Give back to me my long days of forced labour! A Woman's Voice. Give back my poor boy that was flogg'd to death! A Man's Voice. Give back, give back to me my daughter's shame! Other Voices. Up with him! By the devil's beard, old sir, You shall hang high, as suits a gentleman! The Noble's Voice. Children, ... why I might be your father! Mercy! Indeed I never meant you any wrong. And, if I did you wrong and knew it not, I do repent me. Look on these grey hairs. An old man's blood, what can it profit you? Sins have I, that is sure, to answer for, But which among you must not say the same? O let me live! take anything but life, For that is robbing God, whose gift it is! And I will give you up my parks, and manors, My castles, and my summer villas all. And you shall have my bailiffs, all of them, To roast, or hang, or anything you please. If these have done you wrong, I knew it not. A Man's Voice. If you talk more, we'll put a pitchfork through you. Come, hoist him! We shall miss the dancing else. Chorus of Peasants. A bluebottle fly of Beëlzebub Came buzz on the hive of the working bees. We have clipp'd the wing of this gilded grub, And we bring him now to rot at his ease. Their Lordships lordly carcases Shall be thick as straw on the stubble lands. When their castles burn like furnaces, We shall have fuel to warm our hands. As for us, who are hungry, and poor, and cold, And weary enough of the long day's work, We must have fire, food, slumber, and gold, So up with the torch and the three-prong'd fork! (They pass on.) Orval. I could not mark his features in the crowd, Nor recognize his voice. Novice. No doubt it was One of your Lordship's noble friends or kinsmen. Orval. Whoe'er he was, I care not. I despise him. For he will die, a coward. Him I scorn, And thee I loathe. Move on, sir! Here's a path Should lead us somewhere. Bah! some day, who knows? We shall make poetry of all this filth. Come, sirrah! Do you hear me? (They disappear into the forest). Scene IV.—Night. Another part of the forest. Moonlight at intervals. In the background, the ruins of a Church, and in the midst of the ruins the Altar of Reason lighted. The ground broken and uneven. The scene frequently obscured. Confused noises in all directions. Orval and the Novice. Orval. This fine red foolscap hath been torn to tatters Down there i' the brushwood. What are those strange fires Among the ruins? Novice. We have lost our way In the low thickets. As I fancied, this Must be the heart of the forest. Those red fires Are from the altars of the New Religion, Where Amathusius, nightly, at this hour, Initiates the neophytes. Orval. Come on, then, And let us look at the New Prophet! Novice. Softly! Here every step is on the chance of death. We are approaching to the sanctuary. Cover thy face! Orval. Ay! round these steps are strewn The ruins of the centuries! Here lies The old colossus of the Christian World Tumbled in splinters. Column, capital, Arch, shaft, niche, statue, pedestal, and plinth, A heap of undistinguishable stones! My heel strikes on the images of saints. Sharp morsels of stain'd glass, the costly work Of noble masters who praised God with power, And worshipp'd as they work'd, where'er I walk Crackle and fly to bits beneath my foot. The moon, it seems too, dare not look this way. Have a care, sirrah, how you pick your steps! Here 'tis pitch dark. This should have been some cloister Once,—by the clammy travertine that peels Under my finger from the crumbled wall. Pah! ... and the frescoes here, do they sweat blood? My hand is wet! Thank heaven! a gleam of light Shows yonder grating like the bars of Hell. What have we here? A marble warrior sleeping Upon a marble tomb. He hath not waked, Though on his head the roof hath fallen down. He must have fought hard to deserve such rest. To sleep thus, were to be supremely blest! For he that sleeps, sleeps for himself: but he That waketh, knoweth not for what he wakes. Where are we? Novice. Forty days, and forty nights Our people toil'd here at the axe and crowbar. We have destroy'd the last of all the churches. This was the graveyard. (Distant songs faintly heard.) Orval. Men of the new times, Your songs delight me not! Before, behind, Here—there—and everywhere, where'er I gaze, Dimly I see faint shadows and pale lights, That pass and wander all among these ruins: From place to place they float on the night winds: They hover to and fro, and find no rest, But, with an ever-wavering motion, mix Their lifeless ghosts among the living throng Of men and women yonder. This night's heart Must have a guilty conscience! Pause we here. Voices rapidly passing onwards. First Voice. Hail, Brothers, in the name of Liberty! Second Voice. Hail, Brothers, by the baptism of blood! Third Voice. Hail, Brothers, to the Light of Reason, hail! Fourth Voice. Haste! haste, or ye will be too late! The Priests Of Liberty have all her altars lit. The Psalm of Liberty is chaunting now. Haste, Brothers, haste! Novice. It is too late to turn. We must push onwards now. No help for it! The vast crowd, swarming all this way, shuts fast Each outlet in our rear. Pray, pray be cautious! Orval. Follow my finger yonder. What is he, That man, whose form, upon the rolling smoke Dilated, and by smoky vapours curl'd Laöcoön-like, looks risen from out the fire? Red-lit by those infernal flames, his face Is as a fallen angel's. And his voice, Blown hoarse this way upon the gusty dark, Is like a madman's. Novice. That is Amathusius, The inspired Prophet of the Future. Round him Behold his priests—philosophers, and poets, Musicians, artists, writers;—at their feet, The new-made votaries,—naked girls and boys. Orval. Ah ha! That is your Aristocracy? Now show me him that sent thee. Novice. Him I see not. He is not of these. Amathusius the Prophet. Daughter of Liberty, Arise! approach! come to her Prophet's breast! Come naked! come thou free from shame, and free From ancient prejudice. Thou, chosen first, Free Bride of Free Humanity! Deep, deep, I drink the floated odours of thy hair! Sweet, sweet! I drain the red love of thy lip! Daughter of Liberty, upon thy brow The goddess seals this consecrating kiss! A Girl. I fly into thine arms! I pant for thee, Prophet of Liberty! I love ... I burn! Another Girl. Behold! I spread mine arms out on the air To reach thee, O Beloved! ... I faint—I fall— I pant with passion at thy feet! I writhe— I grovel at thy throne! ... I burn! I burn! Orval. The poor wretch is, indeed, in a convulsion. Novice. Oh, if you wait, you will see more of them. This happens every night. But hark! ... The Prophet. Behold, I am transfigured, thrill'd, beatified! Daughter of Liberty, from thine embrace I gather inspiration. Hearken, all! I am about to prophesy. Orval. The girl Has fallen on the flint, now, in a fit. Abominable profanation! Novice. Hist! The Prophet. Lo now! we twain, my delicate white witch, We are the breathing symbols of a world Ennobled, and regenerated. Mark! Around us are the ruins everywhere Of a benighted, but abolish'd, Past. Our foot is on the altar and the shrine Of a deposed Divinity. Rejoice, All ye to whom, in us, hath been reveal'd The bridals of the Better Day! Rejoice! Chorus of Women. Blessèd thou among women, O bride And beloved of the Prophet! Lo, we, Thy sisters, exult in the pride Of ourselves consecrated in thee! The Prophet. Hark! I proclaim a new world! a new God! The People's God: the God of Happiness, Pleasure, and Plenty! The old God of Sorrow Sinks, with the ruins of a world of tears, Smit by the Light of Reason, to the abyss! Blood must wash out the traces of past pain, And we will dig the earth with graves to hold The griefs that have been walking to and fro Upon her surface till they grew too many. Those that would save the altars of the Past Shall perish on them. I have prophesied. Chorus of Men. Destroy'd are the temples of Pride and Oppression! And unmorticed the hands from the bodies of those Who built them of old. We have offer'd Priests' flesh on Each fane whence the Priest hath bless'd Liberty's foes Orval. Mine eagle! O mine eagle! yet fulfil Thine auguries of old! Mine Eagle, rise! And of the bones of all these murderers I will rebuild anew the Church of Christ! A multitude of Voices. Liberty, Liberty, and Happiness! Pleasure, and Love! Hourrah! hourrah! Chorus of Priests. Where now Are the Kings, and the Princes, and Priests, With their mitres, and sceptres, and ermine, Who prey'd on the People like beasts? Chorus of Assassins. We have made a clear house of the vermin! First Assassin. I slew the first king! Second Assassin. I the second! Third Assassin. I The third! The Prophet. Be ye exalted, in the day Of exaltation, men of the red hand! For ye among the chosen have been chosen, And ye among the saints are sainted most! Chorus of Assassins. Through midnight, a midnight band, Do we walk the troubled land, With the knife hid in the hand. The Prophet. Daughter of Liberty, awake! arise! Sleepest thou, Daughter? Sleep no more,—no more! (The Thunder bursts overhead.) Hark! The free elements, the everlasting Sublime Destroyers, call to us! ... to us, The Children of Destruetion! we that are As thunder and as lightning searching earth To desolate, and purify with fire! The Ignorance of Nations hath ascribed To our free kindred of the skies, till now, Co-partnership with human Slavery: And, in the various fablings of mankind, The thunder ever was the slave of Power. First, antique Kronos, then Olympian Zeus, And last, the Christian's Triple Tyrant, claim'd Dominion of the desolating bolt. Yet is it, rather, Nature in revolt That frets her old confine, and utters forth These revolutionary voices, dash'd From the deep heart of discontent,—and streaks The sky with fiery protest! Wake! Arise! Oh! if the thunders ever served the gods, Then serve they, now, that New Divinity Whose ministers we are! But they are free Of the free heaven,—as we of the free earth. For there is no more God in Heaven,—and soon On earth there will be no more worshippers! Orval. There was a time,—if I had heard this noise In heaven, I would have held it for a sign, And cried ... God wakes! Beware! But Thou, O God, Hast Thou, Thyself, in Thine eternal toil At setting things to rights, which presently Go wrong again,—hast Thou, too, lived to feel What to Thy creature is the last result Of Thy grand gift of life,—this weary longing For utter self-forgetfulness? Alas! Through every hideous mask of yon mad dance Still must I recognize the mocking eyes Of mine own hopes?—those phantoms of my youth That, in life's unattainable distance seen, Once seem'd so fair,—changed, by what wicked spell, To gross and foul realities; which yet, Even in their basest degradation, keep (Like fallen and degenerate Spirits, transform'd Into the mimics of their former selves On that infernal stage where imps of Hell Are apes of Heaven) strange semblance horrible Of their original beauty! Fearful Shape, Whose maniac mouth with bloody spume is smear'd, And round whose lurid robe is Licence writ, —Fell Antic, marshalling this monstrous Masque! Art thou not she that, clad in glorious beams, Fair as the Future, solemn as the Past, And far as both from life's dull Present, once Stood o'er me, murmuring “I am Liberty”? And thou, grim Giant with the gory club And brutish brow, methinks through all disguise I know thy face, though fairer face was thine When first I hail'd and named thee Brotherhood, And with rash voice, invoked thee from afar, Whom, being come, I loathe! Oh, Circe's wand Is on us here! and noble Spirits, that sail'd Bold over perilous seas to win life's prize, From heroes turn'd to hogs and wolves, with howl And grunt proclaim the moral of their lives Whom love of beauty lured, from their safe home In happy human carelessness of life's Eternal incompleteness, to pursue Impossible Ideals. We are fool'd By time, and plagued with granted prayers. Hence-forth Let man, whose realm is in the Actual, leave To the great God, what, by the greedy grasp Of his impatient passion, man destroys, —The Ideal Beauty! I am sick of hope. (The storm increases.) What? you untutor'd Spirits of the Storm, Have ye learn'd nothing from your past defeats? To-morrow, will you be fast chain'd again: To-morrow, the old forces, the old forms, The old legitimate authorities That keep things in their places, will come back, And, laughing, look you out of countenance! Then must you be humiliated much By smiling heavens, mock'd by little breezes, And baffled by a sunbeam! Wretched rebels, Roll on! you can get nothing by this noise. I, too, know these hysterics. Be at peace! The Prophet. Daughter of Liberty, come forth! Descend! Now must we march once more our midnight rounds, To institute Destruction in the House Of this Old God that by the People's voice Hath been deposed. Forth! forth! Awake, I say! The Girl (awaking). For thee! .. for thee ... and all mankind ... I burn With love ... with love! Orval. Who is the giant yonder That bars their progress, with his brawny bulk? A mere youth, yet a giant! Mark him now. He is speaking with your Prophet. Novice. Hell and devils! By all that's desperate, 'tis he! Orval. 'Tis who? Novice. The Modern Brutus. And they come this way. We are both dead men! Orval. Thou poor poltroon! hide here Under my cloak .... But, if thou shakest thus, I'll strangle thee! Novice. For mercy's sake, away! Orval. No! I will see this farce out to the end. What are those women, dancing in the ruins, Among the smouldering embers, robed like queens? Novice. Those yonder? They are Countesses, Princesses, Great ladies that have left their wedded lords, And have embraced the New Religion, here. Orval. Methinks I could weep now, if this were not The very scorn of scorn! O women! women, Whom we have loved, and honour'd, ay! and served,— Loved with the loyal heart of honest man, That fears no falsehood where he trusts all truth! Honour'd on knightly knee, with tender homage, Half deïfied with holy poesies, And held unsullied in the secretest shrine Of things divine within us! .. Served, ah God! Served with the soldier's sword, the poet's pen, And all the thousand nameless services Of silent adoration, that make strong The better portion of men's days and deeds! Were ye not mothers, daughters, sisters, wives? Our mothers, and our daughters, and our sisters? And we almost have worship'd you as angels! Why then, ... why then, God bless my Grandmother! For we will yet be merry. Novice. They are firing The chancel yonder! Orval. What, then, do we fight for? Homes without love, hearths without honour left! Veronica, thy pure soul is in Heaven. I am glad of it! A Voice from Beneath. Now for an epitaph, Pious, pathetic, but yet not too long! Orval. Peace, mocker! or speak only to my mind. My heart thou knowest not. Novice. They pour this way! We are dead men. Curse this aristocrat, For he will be the death of me! The Prophet (advancing, and to Orval). How, Brother? What art thou, that dost look thus sad and haughty? Why art thou not, here, in the midst of us? Novice. Lost! lost! Orval. I am of the Destroyers also. Prophet. Whence? Orval. From a distant Brotherhood, new come. I saw your fires far off, and follow'd them. The Modern Brutus. Who is thy fellow? wherefore doth he hide His head, thus, in thy cloak? Orval. My younger brother. A vow is on him, not to show his face Till he hath murder'd—at the least, a Baron. Prophet. And whom hast thou slain, Brother? Orval. I was sworn, Only upon the eve of my departure From Spain, a member of the Spanish Club. Modern Brutus. For whom, then, hast thou destin'd the first blow Of thy yet unslaked steel and virgin hand? Orval. For thee! ...... if thou betrayest us. Modern Brutus. Good! good! Here, Brother, take my dagger. Orval. Brother, mine Will serve the purpose. Chorus of Assassins. Live the Modern Brutus! Live the Assassin of the Spanish Club! Chorus of Poets. Little leg to little foot: And now a little body to 't: Little face to little feature: We have made a little creature. First Semi-chorus. Next a little claw, to fight with, And a little tooth, to bite with, And a little paunch to fit. Who knows what may come of it? Second Semi-chorus. Though the limbs be small and pliant, They may grow, and make a giant. First Semi-chorus. Give it, now, a little tongue; And a little word to utter. It will talk when it grows strong. Hark! the lips begin to mutter. Second Semi-chorus. Though the voice be faint and weak, Earth shall shake when it can speak. First Semi-Chorus. Make it little wings, to fly Over earth and over sky; Wings shall sprout on either shoulder: It shall soar when it grows older. Second Semi-chorus. Wings of butterfly just now: Wings of eagle soon will grow. First Semi-chorus. Choose we now a little name To call the little creature by, And be sure 'tis still the same When it waxes stout and high. Chorus. Nay! no name yet. Let it be Naked, nameless, wing'd, and free As the Son of Cytherea When to Psyche's couch came he: Felt, not seen,—a young Idea! Voices in the Distance. Away! the breeze that's in the trees Hath warn'd us not to stay. The dark grows thin. The birds begin. The dawn's at hand. Away! Novice. The night is ending. Distant Voices. To the East! the East! Novice. The forest will be emptied in an hour. Orval. But who come yonder? Novice. We shall presently Distinguish their appearance. They approach us. Chorus of Philosophers. From its helpless infancy In the film-eyed ages, we Have wean'd the Human Race, my friend: Nurst the bantling on the knee Of divine Philosophy; Taught the child its A,B,C. And given it a name and a place, my friend. Now the course o' the world is free, And we are the first in the race, my friend! First Semi-chorus. Like a long-delay'd sunrise That all at length, and all at once, Leaps among the cloven chasms Of the Dawn, in sudden spasms Of inextinguishable laughter, Till all the wonder over-runs The riven East with red surprise, And every cloud that roof'd the skies Burns like a blazing rafter, Second Semi-chorus. Even so, though sunken long In gulfs of darkness, down among The old benighted centuries, To our invocation wakes The Light of Truth with a heart of fire, Eagle plumes and sanguine eyes; And with a sudden splendour takes Earth and skies, to so comprise A whole world's long desire! First Semi-chorus. Like a trumpet sounding on Men to die at Marathon, Like the clash of sword on shield, Triumphing the trampled field, Clash'd on purple plains Platæan, Hark! from hill to hill, the pæan Of the People's Liberty! Comrade of the conquering cause, Whom the gust of combat draws Out of darken'd lands, on high Lo! the light of larger laws Flooding all Futurity! Second Semi-chorus. Pilgrim from the land of night, Superstition's home for ages, Thou, lured hither by the light Pour'd by us upon the pages Of the ancient Book of Life, Thou shalt open with a knife What was sealèd from the sight Of the schools and of the sages. Distant Voices. Hark hark! the watch-dogs bark! The east is growing grey. The red cock is crowing, hark! Comrades, come away! An Assassin. Hail to thee, comrade! hark! ... I drink thy health In this old skull of an old Saint. Good-night! (He throws the skull to Orval, and passes.) Chorus of Assassins. The arrow flieth in the noon. The sickness walks below the moon, And so walk we. Semi-chorus. Brother follow! through the hollow Night thy comrades call to thee! Second Semi-chorus. Hist! hist! The moon's in a mist. There is a ghost walking over the lea. Well I wist what he hides in his fist, For he mutters and talks To himself as he walks, But he doth not wish that the world should see. First Semi-chorus. Over wood and over water, Hark! I hear the howlet's daughter (He hath daughters three!) Call her sisters, “Come and slaughter The rats in the hollow tree. We may do as we list, for the moon's in a mist, And nobody now can see.” Second Semi-chorus. When the night had kill'd the day, I did hear the lion say To the leopard ... “Come away, Brother leopard! here is prey.” First Semi-chorus. I have seen the Destroyer,—the Angel That beareth the final evangel, Descending with blood on his wings, To purchase of priests and of kings The earth for a burial-ground, To bury the Old Dead God. He survey'd it, and measured it round And across with his measuring rod. Chorus. As the dog-fish through the dark Of his dismal world doth sail, Never swerving from his mark, Where he tracketh a sick whale; Even so, do we go Up and down, and to and fro By a road without a name, With a meaning and an aim, And a hate that shall not fail. Following still, and still pursuing, Over regions red with ruin, Evermore some kings undoing, Speed we on our trail! Distant Voices. The wan stars sink beneath the brink Where the cold-tided day Whitens night's shore, and still flows o'er Faint, but how fast! Away! First Dancing Girl. Kill for me, Brother, Prince Lois! Second Dancing Girl. And kill for me, Brother, Duke John! First Dancing Girl. Go to, thou, with thy noise! Let the old one be first made away with! Dancing Children. Goodman knave! we have broken our toys. Bring us the head of a noble to play with, Or the crown of a king ... what fun! Chorus of Artists. Here's a new temple to build, my friend, The People's new Faith,—to enshrine it: And we, the men of the modern guild, my friend, We are the folks to design it. First Artist. Gothic is out of date. Second Artist. And nobody cares for Byzàntine. Chorus. No! Let it be something great, Stately, and elephantine! Builded strong shall be every column, Of twelve dead kings in a circle solemn: And the capitals shall be bossy and full, Each boss made out of a noble's skull. And the gory locks shall drip evermore Rare tracery red of the richest gore! Art is immortal,—'tis true, my friend! But meanwhile, sometimes her servants starve. Now we have found something new, my friend, Better than marble to cut and carve. (They pass). Distant Voices. The night is passing: the dawn is at hand. Hasten away, o'er the wasted land! Novice. Away, my lord, away! the ground is clear. We may escape unnoticed. Orval. Silence, cur! Once more, once more ere I depart, once more Seek, O my soul, to compass palpably, And set before thee in a single shape, Distinct to thought, the whole circumference Of this infernal chaos, which some fiend Frees roaring from the riven womb of Time To overwhelm creation! What hath made This brute beast tame hath made me fierce. 'Tis well! Oh I had need enough of this strong wine, To wake the drowsy heart that in me dwells, And sting my spirit back to life again; For, by the mass! it is a weary world, And I am sick of watching it! so sick, I would be well content to sleep it out,— Even as God doth! But I thank thee, Scorn, For thou hast made me man! Come, Horror! come, And harrow all my heart! Come, bitter Rage, And wring me to the nerve, that I may roar Defiance, till I crack the sleepy doors Of Heaven's indifferent Justice, and break up This maddening silence! Resolution come, Though from the midriff of Despair, and mail My manhood up in iron purposes! O for one echo of the Fiat, heard In Heaven, what time the Sons of Morning sang To see the cosmic beauty of a world Forth issuing from the formless infinite! He that should ever hear within himself That word of God re-echoed from the Past, And save thereof one syllable of Power To re-create creation ... soul of mine, That man would be ... Voice from Below. A little God-Almighty! Orval. Who spoke then? Novice. Nay, not I. Let us away. Orval. Well! if it be not mine,—the nobler part, To heal and to regenerate,—be it mine, What yet remains,—to crush, and to subdue! Ay! when the lion dies, why let the bees Build houses and make honey in his carcase. The lion lives, though; and his heart in me Is beating yet! O, swift, mine eagle, swift And fierce thy flight be! Novice. Dawn is breaking yonder. And I shall die of ague in these dews. Orval. Let us descend, then. Put me on my way, And I will free thee, when we reach the valley. Novice. Where wilt thou drag me, through this boiling mist? Halt! I can go no further. Orval. March! Down there The torch-fires dwindle in the vaporous dells: The cries and songs of last mad night's mad revel Faint off along the forest. (The dawn becomes faintly visible. A pale light creeps over the scene, and the mists begin to rise and move.) Dost thou mark Upon yon white and rolling vapours borne Among the haggard forest trees, whence yet The night-dews drip, pale shadows passing by? Hear'st thou no moan upon the morning air? Novice. I see not anything but the raw mists: Hear nothing but the tumbling stone that falls From precipice to precipice beneath us. Come! or we shall be founder'd in the fog! Spirits passing in the Mist. Mourn for the Dead Christ, mourn! Where have they buried our Lord? In the heart of the mad world's scorn? Orval. Ah God, for my horse, and my sword! I will hew Thee a cross out of every tree, To crucify them that have crucified Thee! The Spirits (passing). By the shrines, among the tombs, Was our blissful twilight dwelling. Through the glories and the glooms, Did our bosoms bear the swelling Silver psalm, and the sonorous Anthem's solemn-chanted chorus, And the organ's deep Amen, From the golden pipes out-welling Music to the hearts of men. Whither shall we seek new dwelling, Sisters? Spirits of the Bells. Ah, there is no telling! All the world is changed since then. From the swallow-swarmèd steeple, From our homes in happy bells, To the hearts of faithful people Over fields, and floods, and fells, Did our white wings, music-haunted, Bear sweet invocations, chaunted By the silver Sabbath chimes; And in lonely forests daunted Savage creatures from their crimes. Now our homes are ruin'd wholly: Now our haunts are no more holy: And we wander, sadly, slowly, Tenants of the troubled times. Spirits of the Casements. We, that lived among the gleaming Garments of the sworded Saints, In a rose and amber glory; We, that sail'd the purple-streaming Pageant, which the sunset paints With a martyr's mighty story On the calm Cathedral floor, Underneath the flaming casement, When the day is downward stealing:— Spirits of the Dome. We, that hung and hover'd o'er Angels smiling sweet amazement From the golden-misted ceiling, In the glowing dome above;— Spirits of the Aisles. We, that shifted soft surprises Of still light, where sinks or rises, Through the palely-pillar'd grove Shade of morning or of even;— Choral Spirits. Now upon the winds of heaven Lurid-lighted with red levin, Hither, hither, dimly driven, Down the darkness do we move. (The sun rises.) Orval. Ah, the sun rises! in whose golden beam Their forms are melted from my sight. And now They fade away across the pine-tree tops! Novice. There is the valley. Yonder lies your road. Orval. O blessèd dawn of day! O blowing breeze Of the fresh morning! hail, thrice hail to ye! Now .... Jesu, and my sword! Here fellow, take The symbol and the thing together. Keep them. Thou hast earn'd both. (Throws a purse, with the Cap of Liberty, to the Novice.) Novice. I have your Lordship's word Pledged to his safety, who shall visit you To-night. But ... Orval. Tush! away! We gentlemen Break not our promise ... Jesu, and my sword! Voices (answering from the valley). Maria, and our swords! Long live our lord! Orval. Fare thee well, Citizen! Thou to thine own, And mine to me. I do not envy, sir, The knave that owns you. Jesu, and Maria! Jesu Maria, and our swords! Friends, welcome! (He descends the valley.) Scene V.—Early morning. Valley and Woodland in the domain of Orval. Orval. Through the deep quietness of these old woods I walk unwelcomed. The offended flowers Look on me, like the faces of lost friends. Yet there is nothing I have won from life, Nor anything I yet may hope to win, That's worth to me what in the winning it I have flung away—the friendship of such things! The Voice of Muriel (singing from the heart of the wood). The ivy hangs and the violet blows Above and beneath in the bright June weather. I breathe the breath of the bramble rose, And I and the sweet birds sing together. Orval. O all that's left my of lost youth! How like The music of the dirge of my dead heart Sounds thy glad matin song to these sad ears! The Voice of Muriel (singing). Sing, happy bird, and rebuke the world For its foolish cares and its empty deeds, And its gods of clay and of gold, whose curl'd Hot incense Tophet with darkness feeds. Orval. Blind! and I pitied, who now envy him! The Voice of Muriel. Mine eyes are shut: but my heart is not. And my spirit feels what your eyes see merely, The mighty mirth of our mother Earth, When the glory of God on her face shines clearly. Orval. Poor flower, thou know'st not thou art perishing! O you inexorable unjust Powers That mock us with your seeming leave to choose The paths on which you thrust us headlong, why, Why have you ever whirl'd my life away From all love's holding-places? The Guardian Angel (above). Foolish child! Chide not the nursing hand that stole away, To save for Love, the toys Love else had broken. Orval. What hath Love been to me? The Impossible. And still for ever, The Impossible! What was it that my vain youth loved? a dream, A phantom, ever beckoning me away To deserts, where it left me lone ... The Voice. The Past. Orval. And now, life's journey well nigh o'er; when, tired, I can scarce further fare, and fain would rest, What's left for love to linger on? a child: A life for ever beyond mine ... The Voice. The Future. Orval. What, then, am I? The Voice. The Present. Orval. Mystic Voice, That dost mine inmost questionings answer thus, Yet further answer, What art thou? The Voice. The hour, Orval, is not far off when thou shalt know. Scene VI.—Night. The Tent of Panurge. Panurge. Wait me by the witch elm. And if thou hear A pistol-shot, fired from the Castle, bring Thy fellows to the rescue. Otherwise Wait me till dawn. Modern Brutus. O head of all our hopes! Once more I do conjure thee ..... Panurge. Tush! Brutus. Yet think— 'Tis an aristocrat—the worst of all, And the most desperate. Thou goest alone. He, in the centre of his strength, is arm'd. Panurge. Go to! Go to! This Old Nobility Breaks not its word of honour. Brutus. But ... Panurge. The Prince Of Darkness hath his commendable points, His courtesies, and his punctilios. We all must trust the Devil himself sometimes. Farewell till dawn. Ho! lights without there! Watch. (Exit.) Scene VII.—Night. Manorial Hall in the Castle of Orval. Arms, blazons, and family portraits along the walls. In the foreground a marble table lighted by a brazen lamp. On the table a chart outspread, and beside the chart a sword and pistols, richly jewelled. In the background a smaller table, carved and gilded; the coverlet splendidly embroidered. Thereon a silver wine flagon and goblets. One side of the scene is closed by a carved screenwork, through which is the entrance to the hall, an open archway hung with tapestried curtains. On the other side a vast hearth, surmountea by an antique clock. Orval is seated at the table studying the chart. He looks up as the hand of the dial points to midnight. Orval. Midnight! It was, methinks, at this same hour, Upon the eve of battle and of death, That the last Brutus, if the tale be true, Beheld his Evil Genius. I await A like encounter, haply a like fate; Who, ere that unreturning traveller, Time, Add to lost hours this night's now neighbour'd noon, Here in my fathers' hall must, face to face, Behold a being of no fathers' born; A man without a birthplace or a name, An apparition from the immense abyss Of nothingness arisen (who knows?) to be Perchance the father of an age not mine; If I, lone champion of the kingly past, Whose ghostly armies are the dead and gone, Whose battle-cry is a world's epitaph, Now fail to hurl this human portent back Into the blackness of the bottomless pit, From whence it issues. I? Ay, there's the point Where stealthy thought creeps in to steal the heart Of hardiest enterprise. What is my blood To consecrate? Or is it yet so well Worth saving from the slough wherein it sinks, This marrowless and miserable frame Of things, that styles itself Society? The unkingly tenancy of kingly thrones, The coalesced and concrete egotisms Of Class, the unintelligence of Power, The Church's great uncharity, and all The organized hypocrisy of things! Can man's wit cheat, against such desperate odds, Nature's remorseless wisdom? Am I not Leading a self-surrender'd host to fight For an already-abdicated cause? It may be. I devote myself to death For that which haply cannot live. So be it! Why, this is as I will. This is my strength, This the respect that saves my self-respect. For what I do, I do because I must, With manly made-up mind, foursquare to fate, Possessing perfectly what is mine own, The deed; and careless of what is not mine, Fate's dealing with it after it is done. To calculate the gain or loss of it, That would spoil all. What's failure? or success? Nothing. They have no value in themselves. They are base counters. What gives worth to them Is just the so much of a man's own self As he can stake upon them. Any man May be a martyr to whatever cause Can pay the price of martyrs' crowns. But he That's martyr to his faith in martyrdom, And gives himself to death, because he deems To die for any cause is, in itself, A nobler thing than any cause men die for, That man hath surely won the perfect palm, And I will win it! Were it possible To contemplate success as being made The measure of the value of the act And its prescribed repayment, I might pause. For who that champions any human hope Through life's inhuman battle could accept, Here in the witness of Eternal God, Unscared, the dread responsibility Of being answerable for success? But loyalty to failure is at least Absolved from shame, whatever be the event. Souls of my dead forefathers, me, an arm'd Lone watcher by your knightly tombs, inspire With that undaunted scorn of doubt that once I' the wondrous ages whence, with duteous rites, My spirit invokes ye, did inspire yourselves To those high deeds whereof I am the heir! Last of the lion-hearts whose lordly life Once fill'd those hollow images of men With helmèd heads from yonder wall down bent Above my own,—sole guardian of the hearth Which your renown makes honourable yet, Sole resolute remnant of your race and mine, Fallen upon times that are not ours,—behold In me whatever now remains on earth To represent your virtues and your faults! (Clock strikes.) Be nigh me now! I am prepared. Master Andrew (entering.) My lord, The man that was expected is arrived. Orval. Admit him. Panurge (entering). 'Give good even to your lordship! (Exit Master Andrew.) 'Faith, I am ill at ceremonious turns Of language,—phrases, titles! (Throws down his cap and mantle; and, gazing round him, eyes impatiently the arms and portraits on the walls.) Orval. Sir, be seated! I thank you for the faith you have reposed In the reputed honour of this roof; And thus, after the fashion of my fathers, I pledge my guest. (Goes to the table in the background; pours wine; and offers a goblet to Panurge.) Panurge (taking the goblet mechanically; his eye still fixed on the armorial bearings, &amp;c.) Humph! ha! .... If I mistake not, Yon daub of red and blue along the wall Is, in the language of the dead and buried, Call'd an escutcheon. 'Tis a kind of painting Will soon be out of fashion. Orval. Sir, all fashions. That go come back again. What seems the newest Is but the oldest, which, when it returns, Is least remember'd: God having been pleased To economize the invention of mankind. Panurge. There spoke the son o' the Old Nobility! I know the man .... opinionated, proud, Arrogant, supercilious, nice in speech, Reckless in deed, self-confident: whose thoughts Are brazen gods the braggart Vanity, That makes them, worships: and the man himself, Her proselyte, prays to them never more Than when no soldier in the field, no coin Is left him in the coffer. Desperate men Are ever frantic in their trust in God, Not finding in themselves what can be trusted. Their fears are fathers to their faiths. Orval. All force Begins in fear; else fear were purposeless: The force of forethrift in the fear of want, The force of honour in the fear of shame. But who fears God of all men least fears man. Belief is nourisht at the mother breast Of Providence: the beggar Unbelief Lives on the alms of Fortune. Panurge. Show me, then, But so much only as the nether spark Of that fire-barbèd bolt which is to fall, Blasting the rabble and republican heads Of our stark-naked unbelieving host; Or but a feather of the wings of one Of all those harness'd angels that are pledged, Upon the invocation of your priests, To smite our revolutionary ranks And raise the siege about your harass'd halls. Bid the bolt fall, or bid the angel smite: And if, by fast or prayer, cross sign'd, hymn sung, Or any other pious conjuring, Thou canst compel them to perform the task Assign'd them by the priesthood of thy faith, Be that faith mine, Lord Orval! Orval. Friend, methinks Thy humour lacks originality. So old is Atheism, and so stale That creed's vocabulary, I confess That I had hoped speech newer from the man Of the new epoch. Panurge. Tut! all speech is trash That takes transmitted value from the man That speaks it, as from what to speak it moves him He takes his own. Be what I represent, Not how I represent it, thy concern. My creed and its vocabulary both, If old, are also new, as nature. Cries Of half a world's intolerable wrong, The wail of unrequited toil, the moan Of martyr'd patience, the tumultuous shout For knowledge from long-pining Ignorance pour'd, The howl of human hunger, and the shriek Of irrepressible protest, power no more Can stifle in the angry heart of man, —Demanding recognition of a race In prejudice imprison'd, dogg'd by doubt, By fear tormented, and by custom bound To bestial habitudes; .. all these, light lord, Are but the broken scatter'd utterances Of that indignant Truth whose creed I preach, Whose hand I arm, and whose retributive Dominion trumpet-tongued I have proclaim'd Above the annihilation of thine own! This is the faith of millions that in me Hath found a voice. As for myself, the sole Divinity that I acknowledge now Is the all-procreant intellect that rules This restless brain; whose power, whate'er it be, Suffices to give meat to starving mouths, And hope to stricken hearts. Canst thou aver The God thou worshipest hath ever been As helpful to His worshippers? Orval. The God My sires before me worshipt, with the faith Which they bequeathed unspotted to their son, I worship still. And He, that gave to them Power and glory in their days of pride, To me hath given, in mine hour of trial, Patience to bear, and courage to withstand. Panurge. Nay, then, but I will swear thee, by the book Of thy good deeds, thou dost a devil serve. Leave we, however, these absurd disputes Unto the theologians; if, in truth, There be yet theologians to dispute them. To business, noble sir! Orval. Speak. I am dumb To learn the cause and object of this most Unsought and unintelligible honour. Citizen God, I wait thine oracle. Panurge (musingly). Ay. Wherefore am I here ... thou askest. Orval. I? Nay, sir, I did not question you. Panurge. Proud host, I question then myself: and to myself Make answer: first, because I wisht to know thee As man may know man, and to judge of thee As man may judge of man. Orval. Licet videre Virgilium ... an interest, Virgil shared, Doubtless, with each Numidian lion last Arrived in Rome ... Panurge. In the next place, because I wisht to save thee (do not frown, Lord Orval!) As man would save man, if he could. Orval. Save me? For thy first wish I thank thee. For the second My thanks I needs must keep, sir, for my God, And my good sword. Panurge. Thy sword? thy God? words, names, Nothings! But hearken. Multitudes of mouths Shriek for thy blood. Strong hands, gaunt arms, are stretcht To seize thee. What is thy defence? A few Handfuls of men, ill arm'd, ill fed, a few Handfuls of earth—scant room for tall men's graves. Where is thine ordnance? where thy foundries,—stores Of siege? thy muniments of war? Where, most Of all, the valour of thy followers—troops They are not? Where the manliness in whose Behalf thou dost thy manhood sacrifice? Come, come! I talk, my lord, to no blind fool, No blundering blockhead. Were I in thy place, I know what it were best that I should do. Orval. Sir! ... I am patient. Panurge. Well, then ... hark! Were I Lord Orval, I would say to this man here, This man that had a whim—a trick o' the heart, A start of nature—call it what you will— To so think of me, that he came by night Out of my foeman's camp, companionless, With no guard but his faith in my good word, To save my life ... this man who offers me, In the frank name of Friend, a title won From something nobler than the gewgaws daub'd On yonder garish wall .. a title, man, Refused to thousands that revere him, even As God, and follow him as Destiny, —Were I the man that you, Lord Orval, seem, And you the friend I speak of—I to him Would say “Alliance between thee and me! Mine army I disband, my lordship keep, Lands, manors, seignories, and titles all, Upon the faith of his full-plighted word, Who fearless trusted to my own his life.” Thine age, Lord Orval? Orval. Whatsoever age Hath grace of God to be the least like yours, sir. Inquisitor, what is mine age to thee? Panurge. Methinks, if nothing but the timely frost Of life's eventual winter should in thee Obstruct the springs of nature, they have yet, Ere they shoot o'er the fall, some fifteen years Through which to flow. For life in men like thee Flows fast, and soon flows out. Thou should'st be young. On that pale face passion, not time, hath prey'd, And thy frame, firmly mason'd in the form Of noblest manhood, might defy decay For yet another half of human life Stretcht to the longest, if the life that frets Its fiery channels through those violent veins Were of more sluggish element. (He muses.) So be it! Be one gap golden in the iron rule Of the inexorable Necessity, One head exempted from the curse of all! What harm in that? No! live, Lord Orval! live The last of all the nobles of this land! Keep thy broad fields and thine ancestral halls, Thy bright excepted title keep. To us Surrender but the drivellers, dotards, dolts Of that doom'd class thou canst not save. Stand off, Or at my side stand safe. Leave room and way For the arm'd Justice of the Revolution, Whose victims, they: whose pontiffs I and thou, Co-Cæsars, partners in the purple robe Of more than Roman power. To thee I pour This first libation! (Drinks.) Orval. Grant me patience, Heaven! Sir, I have listen'd. Are we at the end? Each word that, in the pictured presences Of my dead fathers, you have dared to speak To me their son, has been an insult. Well, I have listen'd. Have you more to add? But no, By Heaven, Citizen General, forbear! Patience is human, and must end at last. Inflict no more upon my knowledge that You stand here safe, sir, in my knightly word, And under the asylum of my roof. Panurge. Thy roof! thy word! O Pride, thou hast many names! What? with the old and tatter'd rags long dropt From the broad banner of Humanity, Think'st thou to patch and purfle and trick out The naked Vanity that still goes bare? Tinsel! still tinsel! and still shame behind! Man, man, there's life in that fast-swelling vein, Warm life in that flusht brow and flashing eye. And yet I tell thee all this vigorous life Thou hast coupled to a corpse. Go to! To me Names are but nothings. Dost thou think I wince? No, for thou canst not look me in the face And swear, by the oath of a gentleman, that thou And thine deserve not death: and, after death,— Oblivion! Orval. Ha! And thou and thine, what else Have ye deserved? Panurge. Life! Victory! Hearken why. There's but one law of things immutable, Invincible. 'Tis that which doth compel The world to pass out of one phase of life Into another, and so ever on. And by this law already thou and thine Have been condemn'd, as old, weak, overfull, To pass away, and so make room for us That be young, strong, and hungry. Strive no more With fate. Væ victis! Yield; for we must have. Orval. Ah, boaster! sole of mortal men, to thee Hath Destiny her hidden mind reveal'd? That thou should'st menace me with victory? Thou man of clay, thou creature of a chance! Not less than all that are of woman born Mark for the first ball in the battle-hour, Or the first stroke of any sabre slasht At hazard through the cannon's smoky breath! Panurge. Do not deceive thyself, Lord Orval. Me Fate, my wise mother, head and foot, hath dipt In the invulnerable lake. Along The paths I tread Chance walks not. Mortal foes I scorn. Nor sword can strike, nor bullet pierce Me that am mail'd in Nature's iron, until My being shall have ceased to be to thine A dread Necessity. When from my path Hath perisht all obstruction, wheresoe'er That path may lead me matters not. My work Will have been done. But hark! Time mocks at us. (Clock strikes.) Man, I must leave thee to thy fate. One word! If thou be weary of thine own life, still Thou hast a son. Save him. Orval. The safety, sir, Of that pure soul is in God's keeping. Here, On earth, the son's place is beside the sire. (Buries his face in his hands.) Panurge. Ay, meditate! For meditation is Fit neighbour to the grave. Orval. Away, wild fool! Thou knowest not what passes here,—nor canst! Sir, if in your low nature there be depths I fathom not, there yet are heights in mine You cannot scale. Keep thou thy world. Leave mine To me. Panurge. My world? I have none. I keep nothing. Slave of one thought, and bondsman to one form! With every impulse of my will I make, And, having made, destroy a hundred worlds. Nor can thy fancy image, even in dream, My mind's unfrontier'd realm. Orval. Abortion born Of Nature in decline! thy boasted sense Is barren to conceive what is the strength Of those whose noble fixity of faith O'er fortune's fleeting sands is founded firm Under the present in the solid past. Look yonder on the images of those Whose life in me is living. Scan their forms, Their faces mark! On every noble brow The selfsame blood is eloquent: the same High thought shines clear from every kingly eye. That blood in me yet flows, and in my heart That thought, the patriarchal heritage Of honour'd lives, is resolute. But thou, Man of the day that hath no yesterday, Where is thy native land? thy homestead where? Thy wandering tent is every evening pitcht Upon the ruins of thy neighbour's hearth, Thy march is every morn to rapine new. But home of thine thou hast not, wheresoe'er Men honour yet the memory of their sires. Panurge. Honour their memory by all means! Well Have I been studying all this while, my lord, The list of your illustrious ancestors. See if I have not... “mark'd their faces, scann'd Their forms” exactly! This grave Councillor Grill'd Jews and roasted witches to the taste Of priestly palates,—the approved head-cook And caterer to that cannibal, the Church. Well, I admire the beard of him, and praise The barber's skill that trimm'd it. This one here Was a King's Chancellor, and had in charge The Great Seal, and sign manual. They served him, Upon occasion, to forge documents, Falsify acts and deeds, buy judges, rob The public treasure, and appropriate The private property of lesser men. Yonder fine fellow, with the soft black eyes, White ruffles, and smooth chin, only seduced The wives and daughters of his friends. But here Comes next a Patriot who proudly wears The Golden Fleece, which paid the services Of his sword's hiring by the Spanish King. That noble lady in the stainless silks, With swanlike throat, and stately brow serene, She was her footman's mistress. This one here, With such a glory of gold curls, and such Unstinted revelation of rich charms, Was a king's concubine. Behold, my lord, The spotless fountains of your lineage fair And noble! But the Judgment Day draws nigh. And O be sure that we ignoble men, Whose mean task is to ply the rope and axe, Shall not forget these most illustrious lords, Nor yet their worthy offspring. Orval. Slanderer! Son of our serfs, thou liest in thy throat! Had not my noble fathers shelter'd thine, Thou hadst not stood before me to blaspheme Their honest names. And when, from out the herd Of animal brutes they had for ages been, Thy base begetters did at last begin To emerge into humanity, it was Our fathers that for thine built churches, schools, And taught them human duties. Wretch! thy curse, Shatter'd, from off their ancient glory falls As once of old in fragments fell the brand Of the black Painim from the stainless shield Of Christendom's pure Knighthood. Thee and thine, Do I not know ye? Sir, I have visited Your rabble camp. I know you all. Your mad Philosophers, your atheistic priests, Your consecrated murderers, horrible And sexless harlots ... under every mask Of your abominable devil's dance Last night, sir, I detected and I scorn'd The face of every worn-out villany And wither'd vice of the old world, smear'd o'er With the coarse barbarous war-paint of the new. I heard your new songs, and I recognized In all the same old burden, “Blood and gold!” “Rapine and wrong!” But you, sir, you yourself I saw not. Why? Because you did not deign, And rightly did not deign, sir, to descend From where the folly of your worshippers Above their heads, on your dishonest throne, Hath raised you, back to your low native place In the rank filth and ordure at their feet. Because you, in your secret soul, despised The dupes of your imposture. What remains? But if one spark of man yet in thee burns, Look on my face, Panurge,—'tis the face Of one whom thou canst neither dupe nor daunt, And not less thoroughly despise thyself Than those whom thou despisest. (He seats himself, under the arms of his Family.) Panurge (musingly). True. My world Is not yet in the actual developed. 'Tis but the rough sketch of the future time. An infant giant ... must be nurst and taught: It grows apace—will grow up in good time From cubhood into manhood. It hath need Of nourishment—care—and it may be, too, No gentle discipline. But mark me, Orval, The time shall come when this brute world of mine Will thoroughly acquire the consciousness Of its existence as a fact in time Indisputable: when it will cry out “I am!” and then in all the universe Of Nature shall no other voice be left To answer “I am too.” Orval. Well, sir? and then? Panurge. And then, Lord Orval, from the life in me This night incarnate shall a race arise, Such as the teeming earth has never yet Rear'd from her fruitful bosom. Men as gods, Knowing both good and evil: masters they Both of themselves and of their home, this globe; Which globe itself shall be to them one vast Palace of Pleasure, by the Spirits of Art And Science rear'd into the golden light Of the glad time, a happy fabric fair In the wide-porchèd doors of whose serene Dominion shall the elements of earth And heaven await the bidding of their lords! Orval. Thou liest, impostor! and thy strain'd voice fails To hit the pitch of inspiration. Slave Of Reason, she thou servest hath scaled up The springs of prophecy and oracle. Panurge. Man, interrupt me not! Millions of hearts Have hunger'd for this prophecy, vouchsafed To thee alone. I tell thee, in that time, Mankind shall commune with a god—a god Unlike to thine—incapable of death— Wrench'd from the bosom of the vast unknown By the strong toil and trouble infinite Of centuries of unappeased desire. From his long hiding-place in heaven at last Torn down and welcomed to this world of theirs By his stout human children, in the day When man shall have attain'd the age at which Knowledge of Truth is man's inheritance. Then shall Humanity both save itself And save its God. Orval. Blasphemer, centuries Have flow'd already from the fount of time, Since when the God, of whom thou feelest now The inevitable necessity, revealed Himself to those who, of his earthly sons, Have eyes to see, or ears to hear. And ere Thy birth was to the service of his foes Permitted, by that God Humanity Hath—even from thee—been saved. Panurge. A brave god! Count The nigh two thousand years of human pain And degradation irremediable Since— Orval. On the summit of the seven hills, In the strong heart of sempiternal Rome, Over the lost dominion of the Cæsars, Above the ruin'd remnants of a power More powerful than thine,—girt by fall'n gods Nobler than those thou worshipest—fall'n gods That dared not lift up from the dust of time Their hopeless heads, to gaze upon the feet Of their excruciated Conqueror—there, Once—in the morning of my life—I saw That Cross, and Him that hung thereon, with arms Outstretcht to east and west in the embrace Of infinite benediction! Panurge. Bah! the old Old nursery doggrel, the long lullaby With which how many periwigg'd and powder'd Respectable old women have for years Been getting off to sleep that overgrown Big baby the Fool-People! Shake this heap Of rusty iron, and methinks 'twill sound A truer note. (Strikes the armour.) But thou? I read thy heart. What faith is there is of a nobler kind. Listen to me, Lord Orval. If thy soul Hath ever loved Truth better than all creeds That seek to cramp and cannot even clasp her; If thou hast ever follow'd her fair steps Beyond the bounds of Use and Wont—beyond The perishable aims that tie small minds To small successes; if thou hast ever felt Thyself to be of God created, in The image of Humanity, God's Son, Rather than of blind Chance in the mere form Of a three-hundred-years-old Noble; if Thou seest, across the universe of deeds, Beyond the few poor earthy inches spann'd By the brief shadow of thyself, the vast Capacities of Nature's wondrous gift, A human life; and, seeing this, dost prize The gift, for man's sake—not thine own;—then heed The voice that now perchance for the last time, At the last hour, is speaking. Orval, rise! Rise, soul and heart of Nature's nobleman, Far nobler in thy manly right to be, Than in whatever title to the name Of meaner men ignoble Custom grants! Rise, and consider, for man's sake, with me What shall be done to help him. Orval (in great agitation). Tempter! Son Of the old Serpent! .. But no. These are dreams. The first man perish'd in the wilderness Among the brutes: and their lost Paradise Men may not now recapture. Panurge. (Ha? have I hit At last the weak spot in Pride's buckler! Fool Not to have seen this sooner? He is troubled. Have I, by a mere blunder, toucht at last, The sensitive nerve of poesy—the chord That sounds in golden unison with hope To the man's inmost heart? Victoria!) Orval. I too have dream'd ... Ah, if my blood, even yet, Could purchase .. if my head ... man, you should have it! But no, the days are past. It is too late. Panurge. Listen! We cannot put back time. The dead Their dead must bury. Think! A leech forbids His patient to take any exercise: Warns him that movement may to life be fatal. The patient disobeys, and walks a mile. What think you of that leech, if, to repair The mischief done, he make his patient walk The whole mile back? The People's sick, my lord, Your friends forbade it stir. But it does stir: Moves forward somehow. And its doctors now, Who had forbidden it to move at all, Insist upon its moving back again. Is motion backward less injurious Than motion forward? An anachronism of Panurge's. I think that Börne has said this, or something like it. O. M. Orval. Grant your simile. Forward .. to what? Panurge. Ay, there's the point to which I sought to bring this talk. When two wise men Discuss dispassionately such a point They cannot fail to agree upon it. Orval. Well? Panurge. I take it there's no grounded difference Between, what on the surface seem opposed, Our real opinions. Orval. Sir, proceed. Panurge. I will. The point. What kind of Government is best? Government by the best. Orval. But who are they? Panurge. The real aristoi: the most capable Of governing: the wise men: I and thou. Orval. And, sir, if you and I be knaves, being wise, What power is it likely we shall leave To that most dangerous class—the honest men? Panurge. If all start fair, the power a man attains Is proof of his capacity for power. And never in the history of mankind Was such a field for power as I have clear'd. Think! is it nothing to have swept away Parliament, Church, and Aristocracy? All's even now. And o'er the level waste What rises but supreme necessity For the superior mind and stronger hand? For men must still be govern'd. Orval. You grant that? Panurge. Of course. And govern'd by the best, I say. Orval. So the old obsolete, much abused device Of Aristocracy has yet some part To play in the new system? Panurge. Yes, renew'd Itself, though, in the person of its new And better representatives. Orval. Of course. But what becomes then of Equality? Panurge. Think not that I suppose any one man Is worth as much as any other man. No fool am I. The wise and noble-minded Are worth more than the ignorant and base. Equality means equal start for all; Not equal prizes for the swift and slow. The true great men should get the true great power. Orval. Yes. But great men, sir, are a kind of fruit That does not grow on every common tree. God grants them to us rarely. When they come, They come to power in their own great way, Do what we will, by nature's force in them; And when they come not, there's no kind of care Or forcing culture can from sapless stocks Make such fruits grow. Sir, no philosophy, If nature makes but little men, can turn Those little men to great men—'tis to save The little men from being slaves and tools Not to true great men, but untrue great rogues, Which little men for great men oft mistake, That the Philosophy of Government Should be applied. Science? what need of that, To know a giant when he strides in view? Or move on swiftly, mounted on his back? Or trample monsters vanquisht by his club? But if the race of giants be extinct, As travellers tell, till giants grow again, Let Science help us to make seven-league boots, And clubs mechanical that, fitly plied, May in a dwarf's hand deal a giant's blow, Skill eking out the thrift of force. This Church, This Parliament, this Aristocracy, Contrivances which Science had devised To do the business of society, You have abolish'd . . . what! in the wild wish That some great man, who has not yet appear'd, Should, when he comes, if he should ever come, Find round him ample room in which to try His hand at renovating ruin? Sir, Call you this prospect progress? You put back The world, not forward; leaving all to Chance, The blind brute-headed, unintelligent god, Placed on his old barbarian throne again. Sir, better to my thinking, a bad King Check'd by a not much better Parliament, A loose Nobility, and a lazy Church, Than such an absolute Chaos as you make, With no more hopeful prospect in reserve Than ultimate Order in that worst of shapes, A single-handed Despotism, crown'd And robed i' the name of wrong'd Democracy. Panurge. Not Despotism, if the canvass'd choice Of the free Many crown the chosen One. Orval. Whom having crown'd, if the free Many then Should, being human, haply change its mind, Repent its choice, and wish the chosen One A chosen Other, shall this most free Many Be free to uncrown, as 'twas free to crown? Is the free Many free to change as choose? If so, then where is your stability? If only free to give, but, having given, Not free to take again its gift abused, Where is your liberty? Panurge. We cannot quite Leave time out of the account. Men must improve Ere things can be improved. But one wise man, Wielding the power which many thousand fools May in a lucky moment be induced To delegate to him on their behalf, Can in a year improve things, more than they Can in a century improve themselves. I say, Make way for the strong men. Orval. And I, Leave room, sir, for the weak. They have God's leave To live as well as we. Alas, Panurge, Do we not strangely seem to have changed parts? For you, my Citizen Guest, have all this while Been speaking for Aristocratic Rights; For Popular Privileges, I. 'Tis there The hopelessness, the misery of it all! Ages,—perchance a hundred years ago— That might have then been possible, which now Our fates forbid, and we made common cause Who now must be no common foes. Too late! We can no longer understand each other, Never forgive each other for the past. The hour hath struck for both: and both must fight, And one must fall. Nature and time, in strange Conspiracy, have made us enemies Beyond all reconcilement. Now farewell, My Citizen Guest. 'Tis time that we should part. My vassals shall conduct thee to thy friends. Panurge. Farewell, Lord Orval! Till we meet once more On the storm'd ramparts. Then, when thou hast left Nor ball nor powder . . . Orval. We will then cross swords, sir. Ho, Herman! Andrew! (Enter Andrew and Herman.) Panurge. Madman! Be it so. I am sad. I would have saved thee. Thou and I Are eagles of one feather. But the bolt Of heaven hath on thine eirie fall'n. Behold, In yonder purple Oriel, while we speak, The sun is rising. To the sun I soar. Adieu! Orval. Adieu, sir! Andrew, from these halls Safe to the outposts of our enemy Escort our guest. Adieu. (Exit Panurge, escorted by Andrew and Herman. Orval remains lost in thought: then with a heavy sigh,) The spurring hour Posts to the bourne. And this fool, life, at last, Chasing the future, falls into the past. END OF THE FOURTH EPOCH. FIFTH EPOCH. MAN AND FATE. Scene I.—Early morning. Interior of the fortress-chapel of St. John. Lofty columns, with niches, supporting the nave, on either side. In each niche is an armed statue: and the Senators and chief Ecclesiastical Dignitaries are seated, one under every statue, in their robes of state, to left and right. Behind them, through the spaces between the columns, the rest of the Nobility, armed and in dense masses, is visible. In the background, by the main altar, the Archbishop is seated in a splendid chair, gorgeously clad, and having across his knees an antique sword. Behind and around the altar is grouped the rest of the Priesthood. Orval, bareheaded, kneeling before the altar with a banner in his hand. Organ music. HYMN. In the last of Thy churches, here, Of Thy servants the last, do we O God of our fathers, revere Thy name; and we call upon Thee. For have we not heard with our ears, And have not our fathers told What was done in the former years, The great deeds of the days of old? How the heathen Thy hand hath driven, When it planted Thy people in: How the nations Thy wrath hath riven, When it cast them out in their sin. In Thy name hath the refuge been Of our sires, in the old generations; And or ever the hills were seen Didst Thou stablish the world's foundations. Therefore tremble we not, neither fear, Though the earth be removèd and flee, And the hills from their place disappear And be sunk in the midst of the sea. In Thy name have we bended the bow, In Thy name we have girded the sword, In Thy name shall we overthrow, And scatter our enemies, Lord. But, O wherefore yet sleepest Thou? And O be Thou not absent for ever! Hide, O hide not Thy face from us now, But arise, O Lord, and deliver! A Noble in the Crowd. Mark him! Not Lucifer, ere Heaven he lost Could have look'd haughtier. A Second. Nor young Alexander When he had conquer'd what, for all he boasts, Lord Orval hath not conquer'd yet—the world. A Third. Ay. And what hath he done, this mimic Mars, To justify the godship he puts on So proudly? The First. Nothing. The Second. For ten foemen fallen Beneath his sword, a hundred of his own Have been most rashly wasted. (Organ ceases.) First. Hist! the choice Of this man to the undeserved command Of us, men noble as himself—nay, nobler, Is what . . . Second. Behoves us to prevent. First. My thought. Third. And mine. Orval. Here on Thine altar, Lord of Hosts, That didst to me, Thy faithful soldier, grant The strength to take it, kneeling, I lay down This banner, pluckt in battle from Thy foes. Archbishop. Servant of God, receive this sacred sword Which Bouillon's noble Chief in Holy Land Made famous. Voices. Hail to Orval! Orval, hail! Archbishop. Next, with the benediction of these hands, And by the general suffrage of thy peers, Receive of all our armies, and of this Renown'd and ancient citadel,—the last Whence floats our ensign,—the supreme command: Whom, in the name of all, I now proclaim General-in-chief. Voices. Hail, Orval! A Voice in the Crowd. I protest. Omnes. Silence! away with him! Hail, Orval! hail! Orval. Friends, Fellow-soldiers, Princes, Senators, If there be any one among you all That can against mine honest name advance Aught to disgrace the choice wherewith you grace it, Let him stand forth, and look me in the face, And, like a noble gentleman, lay bare His purpose and his sword. (Silence.) Archbishop. No voice disputes Thy well-won title. Omnes. Hail, Lord Orval! hail! Orval. You do accept me for your leader, then? Omnes. We do! we do! Orval. I cannot promise you That I will lead you all to victory: Ask that of God: but I do pledge myself To lead you all to glory. Omnes. Hail! Orval. Swear all, Each on his own good sword, as thus swear I On noble Godfrey's saintly brand, to Heaven That hears, and our own hearts, brave gentlemen, That, long as in our knightly hands be life, Blood in our veins, or in our bodies breath, We will not yield up our fair fathers' faith, The names they won us, or the lands they left; So swear to live, and so to die at last, Dying unshamed, when He that gave us life His gift recalls,—of hunger, if He will, Hot thirst, or else what honourable men, Losing all else save honour's self, may win, Wounds that grace noble life with noble death; Bequeathing, if nought else, their fathers' fame Fair to our sons—no heritage of shame! Omnes. We swear! we swear! (The Archbishop raises the cross over the altar, all draw their swords and kneel.) O Lord our God, Smite with Thine avenging rod, Him that sweareth, if he be To his oath forsworn, and Thee! By the righteous wrath of Heaven Perish,—if in heart of craven, Head of traitor, soul of spy,— Treason, fear, and perjury! HYMN (with organ music as the scene closes). The Lord is King: and hath put on Glorious apparelling. Earth the footstool, Heaven the throne, Of the Lord, our God and King! Let God arise, and scatter'd be All His enemies! and they That hate Him shall before Him flee, As smoke that vanisheth away. Lord, we call Thee from the deep. Hear our cry, consider well! Shall He slumber, shall He sleep, He that watcheth Israel? Scene II.—Afternoon. Platform on the ramparts. Voices without. Way for the wounded! (The wounded are carried across the stage. Nobles entering in disorder.) A Count. Who will surgeon me This gash? I bleed to death. Chirurgeon ho! Where's Orval? A Baron. Orval? When I saw him last He was surrounded by our swarming foe, But fighting still. No lion fiercer. A Prince. Well, It was a desperate sortie. The Count. Desperate? ay, They shambled us like sheep. The Baron. All's lost! Orval (entering, followed by Andrew and vassals). Lost? ha! Who said then “All is lost”? What man of you, That in his heart hath manhood left and life, Dare say “All's lost”? The Prince. What, Orval? never more I thought to see thee amongst living men. Welcome, brave chief! We bleed at every pore. What's left of us? How long can we hold out? Orval. So long as we are living men: no longer. The Baron. Count, you have seen that cruel man. How say you, If we should fall into his bloody hands, Shall we find mercy? Orval. Mercy? ay, my lord! Such shameful mercy as the hangman grants The felon that he gibbets—a swift end. Thy father would have scorn'd such mercy. The Baron. Ah, Then nothing's left but to defend ourselves As best we may. Orval. And you, Prince? What say you? The Prince. My lord, a word with you. (They walk apart.) All this is well To put upon the crowd. But you and I Know that we must capitulate. My lord, After this day's disastrous end, to think We can repulse the enemy is not Courage, but madness. Orval. Hush! speak lower, Prince. The Prince. Wherefore? Orval. 'Twere pity if our friends should hear From one whose name was honourable once Words that dishonour it. (Aloud.) Remember, sirs, That unto him who of surrender speaks The punishment is death. The Count, the Baron, and the Prince together. The punishment Is death to him that of surrender speaks. Omnes. Ay, no surrender! Death, but no surrender! (They go out.) Orval. Where is my son? Andrew. In the north tower. He sits All day upon the flinty step beneath The iron door that on the dungeons opes, Singing strange songs. Orval. The western bastion arm More strongly. We are weakest on that side. See that the wall be double mann'd: this night They may attack us. Go, good Andrew, ere The sun sinks from our western outlook mark The enemy, and bring me word of him. Andrew. God help us! O my lord, our soldiers faint. They are o'erwatch'd. Orval. There is no lack of wine For princely tables in our cellars stored. Broach them the best. Andrew. I will, my lord. Orval. See to it. (Exit Andrew.) (Orval ascends the ramparts, and eyes the plain. from beside the standard of St. John, which is planted on the ramparts.) Yonder, from his red ramparts of the west, Into his black and cloudy coffin, sinks The bloody sun. And yonder spreads the foe. My day is setting. And, like thee, O sun, I to a gory grave am going down. I too, like thee, have travell'd the world round. Bright be mine end as thine! When we are gone What shall come after? On what world not ours Still wilt thou shine, and we, thy peers, be dust, Who, whiles we yet were living souls, to thee No homage owed! The days are few and fast. And soon I,—they,—all these, that keep the forms And semblances of men, shall be dead clay. What matter, if, while yet we are, we are Immortal in the moment we make ours? O solitude of sovereignty! which they That creep, and they that soar, aspire to reach, By no base crawling guile, nor no blind flight, But with the firm-set footsteps of a man Whose vision measures what his manful will Hath made the pathway of his purposes, I have attain'd to be this day supreme And paramount arbiter of those that were My seeming equals yesterday. Content! My days haste from me, but I grasp myself. O such as never in the time gone by I was, when through the dark of dreamless nights I watch'd the rising of thy nebulous star, Thou phantom Poësy, am I, who now Hail life's bright burning brief Reality! What if my days be number'd, being cramm'd With numberless delights? And we will cheat The chary time with memorable deeds That shall outlive him, and whiles yet he lives Feed him on passionatest pleasures. War, Thou grand begetter of immortal men, Make thou this lean life big with burly lust Of glory, and fame gotten with a gust! Scene III.—Night. A Chamber in the Fortress, in the wall of which is an iron door. Muriel is seated on the step of the door. Another door leading to the ramparts. Orval (entering from the second door). A hundred men fresh-breathed to the redoubt! After the battle they that fought must rest. See the south battery arm'd. A Voice behind the Door. God help us all! Orval (laying down his arms). Dear Muriel, thou hast heard the barking mouths Of our artillery. But fear not, son! Our walls are stout. 'Tis not to-night, nor yet To-morrow, they will fall. Muriel. Yes. I have heard The cannon, Father; but I mind it not. I have had other cause of fear. Orval. For me, lad? Muriel. No. For I know thine hour is not yet come. Orval. Mine hour! Ay, truce to care! My heart to-night Is light and vacant. If the raven croaks, 'Tis o'er the corpses of our enemies Which we have left to feed him in the glen. I am all thine. Tell me thy pretty thoughts, lad, And I will hear thee as in the old time In our old home. Muriel. Follow me, Father. Orval. Whither? Muriel (opening the iron door). Down to the Dread Tribunal. Orval. How, boy? Who Hath taught thee to undo this iron door? Hold, Muriel! hold! this gloomy stair leads down Only to dismal subterranean dens Where rot the bones of long-forgotten men. Muriel. Ay, Father. There, where thine imperial eye No ray in the eternal midnight finds To guide thy steps, my spirit its path discerns. Follow. The darkness to the darkness goes. (He descends. Orval snatches up the lamp, and follows). Scene IV.—Vast subterranean dungeons hewn in the rock, and strewn with rusty chains, bones, and old instruments of torture. Cells in various directions barred with iron gratings. The obscurity is feebly lighted by the lamp which Orval holds at the foot of a huge rocky stone; on the top of which Muriel is standing, in a listening attitude. Orval. Son! son! Muriel. Hush, Father! hush! Orval. Come back! come back! Muriel. Dost thou not hear their voices? Orval. Nothing, boy, But the eternal silence of the tomb. Muriel. Dost thou not see their forms? Orval. I can perceive Only the giant shadows to whose shapes This wavering flame uncertain motion lends. Muriel. I see them. They approach. One after one Forth troop they from their gloomy dens, and sit In dismal synod yonder. Orval. Wretched boy, The night-damp's giddy cold doth fever thee! Boy, wilt thou rob me of the little strength That's left me, who now need so much? so much! Muriel. I see them, Father . . . pale and fearful forms Dim-garmented, with solemn faces stern, Assembling to the dreadful Judgment Seat; Whereto they summon . . . ah, he comes, The Accused! Orval. Muriel! Muriel. Dost thou hear them? Orval. Muriel! Voices (faintly, out of the far darkness). By the rights that from wrongs we have wrung, By the power that on pain hath been nurtured, We,—who were strangled and hung, We,—who were fetter'd and tortured, Limbs that were gall'd by the gyve, Flesh that was burn'd in the fire, Bodies once buried alive In the midnight and mire, We arise in the fulness of time: And, for robes, in our wrongs we array us, Who are judges at last of the crime Which the sons for the fathers must pay us. For the guilty too late is repentance Now that we, who were victims, are fates: And Satan our terrible sentence To execute waits. Orval. What seest thou, Muriel? Muriel. The Accused! the Accused! Orval. Who is he? Muriel. Father! Father, 'tis thyself! Orval. O boy! O son! Must thou my doomsman be? The Voices (growing louder). Son of a race accurst, in thee All its crimes completed be: All its powers united, all Its grandeurs, grandest in thy fall: All the passions, all the pride Which the dead Past deified! Of thy race the last, yet first, Thou the greatest, thou the worst, Highest crown'd, and deepest curst! Fated son of fatal sires, In whose glory flash their fires Brightest as the flame expires! Orval. What hearest thou? what art thou gazing at? Muriel, I charge thee, come! Unman me not. A Voice in the darkness. Because thou never hast loved aught, nor ever Hast aught adored save thine own self, O soul, Therefore the face of God shalt thou see never. Evil thy course, Damnation be thy goal! Orval. Son, I see nothing. But methinks I hear From underground, and in the gloomy air Above me, mutterings, menaces, and moans. Muriel. But He now lifts his head, haughty as thine When thou art anger'd, Father, and responds To the dread shadows that do challenge him, With resolute defiance, even as thou When those whom thou despisest are not weak. The Voices. As we, in our wretchedness, wretchedly thou Shalt perish unburied, unblest, unknown, And never a tomb upon earth shall show If the dust beneath it were once thine own. None shall weep for thee: none shall pray for thee: Never a parting psalm be sung, Never a priest shall point death's way for thee, Never a passing bell be rung. Swift and sudden thine end shall be, And bloody and bitter as ours hath been. With the selfsame chain To this rock of pain, Yet black with the blood we have bled in vain, As thy fathers bound us, do we bind thee, To bleed unpitied and die unseen! Orval. At last I see, and know, ye, Spirits damn'd! Muriel. Father, advance not! In the name of Christ I do beseech thee, Father! Orval. Muriel, What seest thou yet? Muriel. A form. Orval. Whose form? Muriel. Thine own. Thy second self—thine image—ghastly pale— Chain'd—and they torture it. I hear it groan. Forgive me, Father, but . . . Orval. My son! Muriel. This night My Mother came, and charged me . . . (He swoons, and falls.) Orval. Nothing else Was wanting. To the threshold of Hell's Hall Mine own son drags me. O Veronica, Implacable Spirit! and Thou, God, to Whom I have so oft, and so intensely, pray'd, Is all in vain? Away! down here i' the dark The shadows overcome me. Up! away! Back to the light! Where I have yet to combat With living men. When I have lost or won That combat, let what else remains begin: Eternal memory, and eternal pain! (Exit, bearing Muriel in his arms.) The Voices (fainting away.) Because thou never hast loved aught, nor ever Hast aught adored, but thine own self, O soul, Therefore shalt thou the face of God see never. Evil thy course, Damnation be thy goal! Scene V.—Interior Court of the Fortress, crowded with the besieged nobles; old men, women, and children in various attitudes of distress. Orval in the midst, his arms folded. In front, the envoy of Panurge (an old noble and kinsman to Orval). Cries and confusion in the doors. Orval. No. By my son's life, by my dead wife, no! The Women. Pity! Orval. No Pity. Providence to us Grants but the last grand general pity—death. The Women. Not here! not here! better the hangman's hands. We die of fever and of famine here. Our babes are corpses at our milkless breasts. The Men. 'Sdeath! but we'll hear this honourable man. Send him not back unheard. We'll hear the Envoy. He comes commission'd from Panurge's self To bring us terms. We'll hear him. Speak, old man! The Kinsman. Good citizen was I my whole life long. Good citizen and honest is my heart. If I have undertaken to come here, Graced with the confidence of that great man Who is the People's Representative, It is because I understand my age, And recognize its glorious mission. Orval. Back Unworthy and ridiculous old man! Hide those grey hairs for shame, ere I forget The weakness they should honour. (Andrew, hark! Prithee, good knave, find Herman. Bid him haste With all our spears to join us here. Be swift.) (Exit Andrew.) A Count. Orval, thy madness throws us all away. Other Nobles. Are we his vassals? 'Sdeath, he shall find out What we are made of! We'll no more obey him. The Prince. This honest Envoy, this good nobleman, Brings us, I doubt not, honourable terms. Behoves us hear them in our own behalf. The Others. Keeping our lives, we'll yield the citadel. The Envoy. The great man who hath sent me grants your lives To all of you, upon the just condition That you henceforth become good citizens, And recognize the age in which it is Our glorious privilege to live. Omnes. Well spoken! We recognize the age in which it is Our glorious privilege to live. We wish To be henceforth good citizens. Orval. Curs! hounds! My very noble, somewhat foolish, most Forgetful friends, methinks before you were Good citizens you swore a certain oath As loyal noble men to die with me Rather than yield, save with your valued lives, One inch of these old walls. That oath be sure I shall not break,—nor you! Good citizens, I mean to make you die like men, although I cannot make you live like gentlemen. Aha, you love your lives? you wish to be Good citizens? you recognize (pray how?) The glorious age in which you have found out It is a privilege to live? Then ask Your fathers why they taught you to oppress And to despise all sons of Adam born Ungraced by what the despicable lives You care to keep have to disgraces turn'd, Your most dishonoured titles? You, Sir Count, Ask your half-starved, emancipated serfs How you have recognized this glorious age In which it is your privilege to live. And you, sir? Life's a privilege, no doubt. But how have you employ'd it? Playing cards, Corrupting women, in soft foreign lands Squandering the misused revenues your hard And grasping bailiffs wrung from the sore toil Of miserable peasants in your own, To pay your joyless orgies? You, my lord, You also recognize this glorious age; In which your special privilege, we know, Hath ever been to fawn upon the strong And trample on the weak. What, Lady! you too? Last of how many other loves, not all Quite glorious, do you love this glorious age? It was your privilege—but have you used it?— To teach your children to be brave and true, High-minded, pure,—and so add honest men To this most honest world in which it is Our privilege to live. O you great gods! Must men be turn'd to worms before they die? Death is before us: but, like soldiers, march With me to find it in a soldier's grave, And not, as felons, where the hangman waits To trim the gallows. Nobles (whispering to each other). How can we rely Upon the promise of this renegade? He brings no written word. Report avers Panurge never spares when he can smite. Others. Ay, that's to pause at. Once in those red hands, Who knows what worse than death may be our doom? Others. Dead men, though, are we now. In all our stores There's not a crumb of bread left. The Women. Men, have mercy On us, and on your children! Must we starve? Yonder there's bread enough to feed our slaves Till they be fat. And here we die by inches. The Men. We'll hear the Envoy further. Others. No, at once Surrender. There's no holding out. Others. Surrender! Surrender! we waste time. The Envoy. I promise you, As I have said, your liberties and lives If you surrender. Pleading for your sakes Who, though unwise, I yet will hope, my friends, This much have I obtain'd of that great man Who with his confidence hath honoured me. Orval. Hence, hound! or plead for thine own life. (Andrew and Herman enter, with troops.) Ho, comrades! Miss not your mark . . . yon Cap of Liberty, The terror of its worthy wearer, now Sets shaking on his foolish forehead. Aim! (The Envoy runs off.) Orval. Find, bind, and to his master send him back. A moment, gentlemen!—I have a word To say to some old friends here. (Addressing his soldiers in turn.) Luke, thy hand! It is not easy to forget thy face While yet it keeps that scar: and I remember No huntsman ever handled hunting spear As thou with that left hand of thine. Ah, Luke, The boars had a had time of it when we Were somewhat younger. And hast thou forgotten That day I saved thee from a broken neck On the Black Mountain, when we could not find The izard we had shot? And you, old friends; Faith, 'twas a lucky chance that fired your farms, For we rebuilt them better. Eh? And you, Do you remember when to our domains, Flying from your bad lord, you came by night? I think you lack'd not shelter, aid, and food, Till we found land to build you houses on, And fields for your own tillage. Well, the times Are changed since then: and may be you are changed, As others are. The ground I go to win Is scant, and only wide enough to hold One brave man's bones. Long have you follow'd me. But now if you would follow me, old friends, It must be to the grave. I counsel you Rather to follow these most noble lords Who love their lives, as doubtless you love yours, And leave me here to die, a little wiser, But not much sadder, friends, than I have lived. Soldiers. Long live our noble master! long live Orval! Orval. See that whatever rests of meat and wine Be shared among our faithful soldiers, Herman. Then to the ramparts! Friends, this braggart foe Shall find there is some life left in us yet. Herman. Wine, boys, and meat! then to the ramparts, ho! Andrew. The will of God be done! We are all dead men. Soldiers. God bless Lord Orval! Wine and meat, lads! Come! (Exeunt soldiers.) The Women. Orval, we curse thee in our children's name! Children. God, curse this Orval, for our fathers' sake! Men. For our wives' sake we curse thee, Orval! Orval. Curse Yourselves for cowards. To the ramparts, ho! Scene VI.—Ramparts of St John. Corpses, dismounted cannon, and broken arms scattered over the ground. Distant artillery and shouts of victory outside. Soldiers passing rapidly across the stage. Orval in the breach. Andrew beside him. Orval (sheathing his sword). To conquer danger is to conquer fate. We have repulsed them. Andrew. Our last cartridges Have served us well. But they must rally soon. And then . . . . There's not a pound of powder left Among us all. Orval. What! is all spent? Andrew. My lord, No mortal man can conquer destiny. Orval. Bring my son to me, Andrew. Andrew. Ay, my lord. Orval (looking over the wall). The smoke of battle hath obscured my sight. The glen beneath me seems to swim and sink In a great sea of blood, and yonder crags To stagger like sick men. So much my thoughts My senses have confounded. (Seats himself in the breach.) What avails The short-lived angel of this little world, Whose name is man, to get himself call'd great, If after a few years of noisy life Into the eternal silence he falls back? One should be God or nothing. (Andrew enters with Muriel.) Andrew, take A dozen trusty men of mine own band; Search every cellar, every vault explore, And beat back to the ramparts and the walls All those whom there methinks that thou shalt find Skulking conceal'd. Andrew. Even Princes, Counts, and Dukes? Orval. All whom thou findest. (Exit Andrew.) Son, give me thy hand. It is the last time that thy father's lips May touch thy brow. 'Tis like thy mother's, boy. Muriel. Father, before the trumpet call'd to arms, I heard her voice. Orval. What said she? Muriel. “Son, to-night Thou shalt be with me.” Orval. Nought of me? Muriel. Nought else. Only “Thou shalt be with me, son, to-night.” Orval. Will my strength fail me here, at the last stage Of life's disastrous journey? One step more. Courage, tired heart! the grave is near. My son, We are about to part. I cannot tell If we shall ever meet again. Muriel. O Father, Leave me not! We will go together. Orval. Child, It may not be. Our ways are not the same. Sad hath the life I gave thee been, my son, But happiness awaits thee: and, among Thy kindred cherubs, soon wilt thou forget The earthly father thou shalt see no more. Muriel. What are those cries? I tremble. Hark! they come, O Father, and the bellowing cannon-mouths Proclaim it . . . the Last Hour which was foretold! (The nobles in disorder are driven to the walls, pursued by Andrew and Herman. Firing and shouts without.) Orval. On, Herman! On! A Voice in the Crowd. You give us broken guns, No powder and no ball, and bid us stand Marks to be shot at! Other Voices. 'Sdeath! How can we keep These shatter'd walls, unarm'd, half-starved? . . Back! back! Others. Back! Whither art thou driving us? Orval (with a terrible cry). To Death! Son, son, one last embrace! Boy, in this kiss Would that to thine I could unite my soul For evermore! But I begin to see The way that I am going. 'Tis not thine. (Muriel falls, struck by a ball, and dies.) Voice in the air. To me, my Son's pure Spirit! Orval. Dead? To me, My peers in arms! Dead? And I loved him. Friends, The foe is but a sword's length from us. Up, And roll him from the ramparts! (The enemy begins to appear over the battlements.) Who's for Orval? An Orval, ho! Down, Sons of Freedom! down, And feed the other nobler birds of prey. An Orval! ho, an Orval! Friends, have at them! (Exit, followed by all tumultuously.) Scene VII.—Another part of the platform. Nobles (rushing past in disorder). The Red Flag waves over the Western Fort. Fly! they are on us. Forces of the Enemy in pursuit. Freedom, and No Quarter! The Envoy (of Scene V.) That is the chief lieutenant of Lord Orval. You know me, all, an honest citizen. The scoundrel beat, and did misuse me vilely, When for the People's Cause I pleaded here. 'Tis a blood-thirsty knave. I say, he beat me. Down with him, honest citizens! Andrew. Ha, fox! The old dog hath a tooth left in his head. (Wounds the Envoy.) The Envoy. The wretch will kill me. Help, good citizens! Citizens. That man shot Ralph. We saw him on the wall. Down with the greybeard! Freedom, and No Quarter! (Fighting. Andrew falls. They pass on.) Orval entering, covered with blood, his sword drawn). This way they follow'd when those cowards fled. Who's here? What, Andrew? Art thou down, old friend? Thou bleedest? Andrew. Ay, to death. Orval. O brave, and true! O my old faithful servant! Andrew. Let me be. I am a dying man. Orval. I'll leave thee not. Andrew. Go, get you gone. I am dying. Orval. All that's left Of Orval, gallant soldier, I give thee In these true tears. There's no one left on earth To shed such tears for me. Andrew. Then keep thy tears. Orval. I'll help thee hence. Andrew. I am past help of all Save the great God into whose hand I fall. Look to thyself. There's that upon thy soul I would not have on mine for all the glory Of all the kingdoms of the world. (Dies.) Orval (flinging his sword over the wall). Away! Go also thou, last trusty friend! No more Shall Orval need thy service. We go hence As naked as we came. Now nothing's left Of Orval save himself. All mine are fall'n, And those poor trembling wretches whom I ruled Are kneeing their new master. (Looks round.) Here all's bare. The foe returns not. We will rest awhile. This is as good a height as any other From which to look back on the broken world Which I have thrown behind me, and consider What sort of thing it was. Hark! now again The cry comes this way. Ha! from the North Tower The red flag flutters. 'Tis my name, they call. The rabble shrieks for Orval. Bloodhounds base, Have you no scent? Here is your noble quarry! (Shouting from the wall.) Orval is here! Behold me. I am Orval! But ye are not my judges, wretched grains Of most ignoble dust which the wild wind Of aimless accident awhile blows up, Nor yet my doomsmen. By no mortal hand Dies Orval. (He mounts the wall, and gazesover the precipice beneath.) Earth, take back whate'er of thine Held for awhile this yet unconquer'd Spirit, Which now goes hence. All mine eternity I see before me—black and terrible, And, in the midst, God, like a sun that burns For ever, lighting nothing. Farewell, world! Receive me, thou, my native element, Into whose vast and sombre depths, thus, thus, With outstretcht arms and open'd spirit, I plunge! (He leaps from the wall, and disappears into the abyss beneath.) Scene VIII.—Interior Court of the Fortress. Flourish of Trumpets. The conquered Nobles, with their wives and children, are led in, chained. After them, Panurge, the Modern Brutus, General Castrocaro (see Epoch IV., Scene III.), and other Revolutionary Chiefs. With them, the Envoy. Panurge (addressing the prisoners). Thy name? First Prisoner. Enulphus, Seignior of Beaurain. Panurge. A name that shall be heard on earth no more. Thine? Second Prisoner. Guy de Malpas, Lord of Montmirail. Panurge. Thou hast pronounced it the last time. And thine? Third Prisoner. Pons, Prince of Arden. Panurge. Thine? Fourth Prisoner. John, Duke of Orm. Panurge. Struck from the list of living men, John, Pons! Castrocaro. These rascals have our forces held in check Nigh four whole months: and you see here with what: Some dozen guns, and obsolete parapets! Brutus. How many more of them remain? Panurge. Oh, take them! They are not worth our reckoning. Take them hence, And make examples of them all . . . save one— Whatever one of all of them can tell Where we shall find this Orval. Several Voices. When the trump That call'd our troops in, sounded victory, Sudden he disappear'd. Till then, we saw him Here, there, and everywhere, from wall to wall. The Envoy. Citizen President, suffer me to speak As intercessor for these prisoners' lives. 'Tis they, Great Citizen, that did erewhile (Upon my urging what the love I bear The People's Cause gave eloquence to urge) Into my hands deliver up the keys Of this strong place, where else we had not stood Triumphant now. Which conduct, I opine, Deserves the praise of all good citizens, And proves they are good citizens themselves. Panurge. Be silent, citizen! I recognize No intercessor 'twixt mine own right hand And my decrees. Thyself shall see them hang'd. I charge thee with the expedition of it. Envoy. Good citizen, my life long, have I been. The proofs are patent. But I did not serve The People's Cause to see my kinsmen kill'd Like common felons . . . Panurge. This old Doctrinaire Is wearisome. Gag him, and hang him tight. March. Where is Orval? Who can bring us to him? A sack of gold for Orval dead or alive! (Enter a Lieutenant). What news? Hast thou seen Orval? Lieutenant. Citizen Chief, By order of the General Castrocaro I, with my men, the western ramparts storm'd. There, as we enter'd, by the parapet Of the third bastion, we beheld a man Alone amid the dying and the dead. “Seize him!” I cried. And at the word our troops Had well nigh scaled the bastion, when the man Sprang to the outer rock—there paused—and seem'd With searching glance to sound the abyss beneath him: Then spread his arms, and, as a swimmer drops Into the sea, he plunged. We saw no more: But heard the body bound from stone to stone Over the precipice. His sword we found Under the parapet. Behold it here. Panurge. There's blood upon the hilt, and on the blade The arms of Orval graven. Well I know it. He hath kept his word. Glory to him! To you The gallows. (To Castrocaro.) See them hung within an hour. Then set about the raizing of this Fort. Brutus! (Exeunt all but the Modern Brutus, who approaches Panurge. They seat themselves on the bastion.) Brutus. Yon sun that now is setting fast Shall rise to-morrrow on an alter'd world! Thou hast watch'd long, and needest rest. Dear Master, Incessant care hath stol'n a march on age, And mark'd thy forehead first. Panurge. The hour of rest Is not for me, boy, yet. The last death-groan Of my grand foe completes but half my task. Nothing's done yet. All, all remains to do. From Orval's death my life begins. Look forth. See yonder plains whose dark immensity, Beneath us, stretches 'twixt my thoughts and me; The yet untraversed field of my designs! Those smouldering homesteads must be palaces: Those deserts we must people: pierce yon rocks: With golden harvests clothe those arid tracts: Dry up those marshes: plant yon barren heath: Channel this valley, and that waste redeem, Unite those lakes, and give to each his part And profit of the soil our swords have won: Until the living be the dead twice told In number, and the new world's opulence Outshine the old world's riches. Until then We have not justified our first dread deed, Destruction's drear necessity. Brutus. To achieve Those giant tasks, the God of Liberty Will give us strength. Panurge. What say'st thou of a God? Here, our foot slips in human blood. That blood Was once a living thing, which thought, spake, acted. What is it now? Behind me I can see Nothing but these dismantled fortress walls; Before me, nothing but yon wasted plain; And yet I feel as though, besides us two, Some one were here. Brutus. Why here's what was, indeed, Some one an hour ago, but nothing now. See how his corpse is mangled! Panurge. Not so much But I can recognize his face. It was Lord Orval's faithful servant. That man's name, I think, was Andrew. But that man is dead, And has no name now. Or, at least, no name That we can guess. Yet there's a Spirit here, A living Spirit (hath It any name?) A dreadful Spirit of I know not Whom, And know not What, seems hovering over us. Mark, Brutus, yon black boulder jutting out From the steep precipice. There's blood on it. What if 'twere Orval's? There's no special hue Of redness to distinguish one man's blood From any other man's. Yet men's blood differs. 'Tis there he must have fallen. Brutus. O my Chief, Why dost thou tremble? Panurge. See'st thou yonder, boy? Brutus. Ay. Panurge. What? Brutus. Why, nothing but the setting sun Reddening the cloud on yonder mountain peak. What's to be mark'd in that? Panurge. A sign! a sign! I know it. I have seen it in bad dreams. Brutus. Lean upon me. Thy face is white as death. Panurge. Millions of men obey me. Multitudes, Nations in arms. Where is my People? Brutus. Hark! Their cry is yet upon the air beneath us. Thy People call thee. In their name, and mine, Pluck those changed eyes from yonder reddening rock! Panurge. He stands there, still! Pierced with three nails, which are Three stars. His arms are stretch'd across the world. We cannot pass them. Brutus. Master, I see nothing. Away! away! Panurge. Vicisti, Galileë! (He dies.) END OF THE POEM. IMITATIONS AND PARAPHRASES. “Une langue à l'égard d'une autre est un chiffre où les mots sont changés en mots, et non les lettres en lettres.”—Pascal. NONNOS. EUROPA. IMITATION. (From the opening of the First Dionysiac.) Sing, O goddess, the thunder-breath, the bearer of lightening From the luminous son of Kronos, the ardent heralding Of a bright child-birth,—the glow of a nuptial glory, brightening The fiery bridal chamber of burning Semele! Sing The double birth of Bacchus, whom, moist from the midst o' the flame, Zeus pluckt,—the unripe fruit of a motherhood half unblown: Father and mother both was the god, by a twofold name, To him, for whose sweet sake a masculine womb in his own Self-wounded body he wrought; forgetting not how, of yore, With the pang divine of another birth, parturient, he Forth from out of his own bright swollen forehead bore Full-arm'd the dazzling dread of Athenè issuing free. Bring, O Muses, to me bring bacchanal wands, and smite The shaken cymbals shrill, and fetch me the thyrsus spear, Famed of divine Dionysos! And forthwith unto my sight, As I mingle your dances among, may the multiform Proteus appear, Leaving afar by the Pharos his favourite isle, and roll'd In changes many as be these mystical songs of mine! For, if like an orbèd dragon his trailing from he fold, I will sing how, under the ivied spear, in a war divine The turbulent giants were stricken, they and their dragon hair: And if, as a bellowing lion, he toss his billowy mane, Ye, as I sing, shall behold young Bacchus, my boy-god fair, In the arms of Rhea, snatching the nipple her lion cubs drain: But, if, in the midst of his manifold metamorphose, anon Like a fretful leopard he leap, into praise my song shall roll, Singing how over the gorgeous Ind rode the triumphing son Of Zeus, when the pard and the elephant pull'd at his chariot pole: Then, if he should fashion himself to the form of a tuskèd boar, While he fashions himself, will I fashion my song till its strain be aglow With the loves of the son of Thyone, and how he wedded of yore Aura, the daughter of Cybele, Aura, the beautiful foe Of the tuskèd boars, the mother of that third Bacchus to be: And again, what time away in a wave of the water he glides, With divine Dionysos my song shall be plunged in the unplumb'd sea, As when, from the Thracian's assault, he fled under the nethermost tides: But if, into the shape of a rustling tree, at the last, he shoot, While his borrow'd branches murmur, my song shall be heard between, Praising Icarios, lord of the winepress red when the foot, With the foot competing, crushes the glad grape bunches green. Bring to me, O Mimelones, the bacchanal wands, and cover (Brightly replacing thus this common diurnal vest) With the fair and spotted fawn skin, fragrantly sprinkled over By odorous drops of the sweet Maronid nectar, my breast! Keep ye for Menelaos,—led by Homeros, and her Whose hidden dwelling is down in the depths of the hollow main, Eidothea,—keep ye the coarse seal's coat of briny fur, And bring me the cymbals and buckler. Not mine be the dulcet strain Of the double-throated fife: lest Phœbos offended be. For I know he is vext by each vivid pipe's importunate din Since the challenge of Marsyas; when he in scorn uphung on a tree The flesh of that felon flay'd, and made of it a puft wine-skin, To punish his insolent pipe, having peel'd the boaster bare, And left his bleeding limbs of their brown hide dispossest. But thou, O goddess, begin! begin, and first declare The story of Kadmos old, and all his wandering quest. On the beach of Sidon now, bull-shaped, with an upthrust horn, Zeus from alying throat had sent forth a lovesick lowing, Softening an ardent eyeball; while, in light bonds upborne, Round the white limbs of a woman infant Eros was throwing Intertwinèd hands. For to her his curvèd throat The mariner bull bends low, down sinking a duteous knee; And, while o'er his glossy flank the girl's form seems to float, Bearing Europa, smoothly, silently, saileth he. Out of the reach of the ripple, though faint with a lovely fear, She, unmoving, is moved: so, silently, seated high On the back of a scaly triton, as she on her swimming steer, Thetis, and Aphroditè, and Galatèa go by. Kyanochætes admires the cloven-footed swimmer: Triton afar replies to the gold's insidious lowing, From his clearly-echoing conch: and, aghast, in the dim green glimmer, Nereus to Doris turns with a pointed finger, showing That ravisht maiden fair, that hornèd sailor divine, Shapes of wonder and awe; for the girl's hand holds the horn Of her breathing bark, like a helm, as he beats breast-deep the brine, And the girl's eyes glance o'er the glooming wave with a gaze forlorn, Desire her pilot is: and the crafty Boreas lifts And puffs with an amorous breath her grament's floating fold; Over her bounteous bosom his silken sail he shifts, And wantons there at his own wild will like a lover bold. So on a dolphin borne when haply a Nereïd glides To visit her liquid realms light over the lullèd sea, At the touch of her guiding hand her seaborn steed divides With a foamy furrow the fields that his azure pasture be. Eros, herdsman now for the nonce, with his bow's sharp hook, Turn'd into a pastoral goad, the mild bull's shoulder smites: Through Poseidon's liquid fallows while thus, with the shepherd crook Of Kypris, he the hornèd spouse of Herè excites, The pure and austere cheek of virgin Pallas (cold maid That never a mother knew) is flusht with a scornful shame, Beholding her mighty father, the son of Kronos, wade In a watery furrow, led by a woman's finger, tame. But the midsea wave and tide give way to the ardent god; For was it not down in the midsea deeps that the globèd blue With the birth of Aphroditè brighten'd and greaten'd and glow'd? And Europa leads and is led, and is captain and cargo too. VIRGIL. THE BEES OF ARISTÆUS. PARAPHRASE. (From the Fourth Georgic.) v. 317. The shepherd Aristæus, when his bees Sickness (so runs the tale) or dearth destroy'd, Along Peneian Tempe flying, above The sacred headspring rested sad, and thus, With much-reproachful moan, his parent call'd: “Mother Cyrene, who the gulfy deeps Of this stream holdest! mother, if indeed Thymbræan Apollo, as thou dost aver, Be my begetter, why was I begot To bear the grudge of most unfavouring fates, Though from the gods' illustrious lineage sprung? Or whither fleeted is thy sometime love Of us, whom wherefore didst thou oft exhort To hope the heaven itself? For now, behold, Even the poor honour of this mortal life, By me, endeavouring all things, barely wrung From tilth and the hard tendance of the herd, Thou being my mother, I must needs forego! Haste, therefore, to make end! with thine own hand Uproot my pleasant woodland places all, Fall on my sheepfolds with unfriendly fire, Burn up my barns, my crops exterminate, And lay the tough axe to my tender vines, If thou art weary of thy son's renown.” That sound, in halls beneath the waters high, The mother heard. Around her sat the Nymphs, Plucking Milesian wools of watchet hue: Drymo, and Xantho, and Phyllodoce, With sparkling tresses round their white necks pour'd; Ligèa, and Nisæa, and Thalìa, And Spio, and Cymodoce; with whom Maiden Cydippe, and Lycoria O' the yellow hair, to whom were newly known Lucina's earliest labours; Beroë, And Clio, sister Oceanitides: Each with gold fillet girt about the brows, Each garb'd in skins gay-colour'd; and Ephyre, Opis, and Asian Deiopeïa; and, all Her darts at last laid by, swift Arethuse. Among them Clymene the tale was telling Of Vulcan's frustrate forethought, and the frauds Of Mars, and his sweet thefts; and all the loves Full-frequent of the gods, since Chaos was, She number'd. Taken by whose song, the while The listening Nymphs around their spindles whirl'd The fluent threads, yet once again that moan Of Aristæus struck his mother's ears; And all those Nymphs upon their glassy seats Were startled. Foremost of her sisters then, Above the topmost wave her yellow head Upheaving, Arethusa glanced around: And, from aloof, “Not idly scared,” she cried, “Sister Cyrene, by such moan wert thou; Whose chiefest care, sad, Aristæus' self, Stands by the wave of thy Peneian Sire Weeping, and, by thy name, thee, cruel, calls.” To her the mother by new fear heart-struck, “O hither bring him, bring him unto us! To him,” she cried, “the thresholds of the gods It is vouchsafed to traverse.” And forthwith She bade the waters wide asunder shrink, Wherethro' the youth might enter. The scoop'd wave Even as a mountainous hollow, around him hung: The abyss received him to its bosom vast, And down beneath the river he was drawn. There moves he, marvelling at his mother's home, And her wet kingdoms: lakes in caverns lock'd, And sounding groves: there, by the unwieldy toil Of waters all bewilder'd, round he looks, And in their places sees those rivers all That wander underneath the massy earth: Phasis, and Lycus, and the headspring high Whence, first from under-ground, Enipeus bursts, Whence Father Tiber, whence smooth Anio flows, And roughly-sounding rocky Hypanis, Mysian Caïcus, and, with double horn, Golden bull-brow'd Eridanus, than whom No river through rich-cultured lands goes down More passionately into the purple sea. Soon as her son was enter'd in, beneath Her chamber's sparry-hanging roof, and there Cyrene knew his woes, though vainly wept, Not irremediable, in order round, Her sisters all their liquid fountains pour Upon his hands; and diapers, they bear Daintily woven. Part, the tables load With viands, and full goblets range. Anon, With fired Panchæan spice the altars glow. And “Take we beakers of Mæonian wine,” The mother cried, “And to Oceanus “Libations pour!” So saying, herself the Sire Of all things, Ocean, and her Sister Nymphs, (The hundred woodland ministers, and they That tend upon the streams, a hundred more) Invoking, thrice with liquid nectar drench'd The blazing altar. Thrice the quicken'd flame, High as the roof-top leaping, flash'd. Then she, By that fair omen fortified, began: “There dwells in the Carpathian gulf a Sage To Neptune dear; sea-colour'd Proteus. He That wanders the wide water, charioted By his two-footed steeds to fishes join'd, Now to revisit his loved native land Pallene, and the Emathian port, is gone. Him, both we Nymphs revere, and Nereus' self, Our Sire grandæval: for to him, as seer, Be all things known, that are, or once have been, Or in the far off time are yet to be. So pleased it Neptune, whose unwieldy flocks, Rank seals, he pastures underneath the gulf. Him, son, behoves thee first to seize, and bind, That he thy cause of mischief may declare, And second the event. For counsel none He unenforced vouchsafes: nor may'st thou him Beseeching turn: on whom, when caught, hard force And chains essay: round these, if thou persist, His frustrate wiles shall waste themselves away. Myself, what time the sun's mid-ardours burn, When thirsty is the herb, and to the herd Most pleasant every haunt of happy shade, Thee to the hiding places will conduct Wherein the old man, weary from the wave, Betakes himself, whom there, in slumber sunk Supine, thou may'st most easily assail. Howbeit, when him thou holdest in thy hands Fast bound, his various aspects, even then, Shall fool thee with brute faces counterfeit: For sudden shall he seem a bristly board, Fell tigress, dragon scaled, and lioness With tawny mane; or, to escape his chains, Give forth anon sharp sound of crackling flame, Or, in thin waters falling, melt away. But thou, the more he shift his shapes, so much The more, son, tighten stern his stubborn bonds; Till to the same his form returns, as when With sleepy eyelids sunk thou saw'st him first. So counsell'd she: and liquid odour pour'd Ambrosial o'er her son, that all his frame With fragrance flooded: on his curls composed Came breathing gusts of sweet, and to his limbs Light nimble health. A hollow huge there is, Deep-cavern'd in the side of a hoar crag, Wherein the oft-wind-beaten wave o' the sea Into long gorges breaks, and falls; erewhile To storm-struck mariners a haven safe. There Proteus, under the broad beetlling cliff, Houseth: and there, turn'd from the light o' the day, The Nymph among the shadows placed the youth. Herself, at hand, in vapour veil'd, retires. By this, swift Sirius, scorching thirsty Ind, Was hot in heaven: and now the fiery sun His middle orbit had nigh fill'd: the grass Was parching: and to muddy ooze the beams Baked in their suck'd and shrunken river-beds The tepid brooks; when from the sea-wave forth Came Proteus, seeking his accustom'd cave. Around him the vast deep's moist people play'd, And, shambling, shook abroad the salt sea-spray. Anon, to slumber, scatter'd here and there, About the sea-beach, settled the sea-beasts. Himself, meanwhile, as one that tends his herds The hills among, what time the Even star Back to their stalls his beeves from pasture bids, And the lambs' bleating the wolf's hunger whets, Above them, in the midst, upon a crag Sat down considerate, and their number told. Whom to assail soon as the chance he spied, Scarce Aristæus the old man vouchsafed Scant time to stretch at ease his wearied limbs, But with alarum loud upon him rush'd, Prone where he lay, and him fast manacled. He, not unmindful of his art meanwhile, Himself to all manner of marvellous shapes transform'd: Fire, formidable beast, and flowing stream. But, when by no false seeming might he 'scape, Vanquisht, he turned anon into himself, With human countenance resumed; and said: “Rash boy, who bade thee our abodes approach? Or here what seek'st thou?” But the other cried: “Proteus, thou know'st: thyself, thou know'st: nor thee May any man in aught deceive. Do thou Therefore, thine own deceivings, prithee, cease. Here, to the gods obedient, are we come, Of our misfortunes to enquire the cause.” Thus far he spake: whereto in answer, shaked By mighty spasms, the prophet around him roll'd The glassy glare of his sea-colour'd eyes, And grimly gnashing, thus the fates declared: “Thee nothing less than wrath divine reproves. Large debt thou owest of evil done: and worse (If fates forbid not) hast deserved, than these Retributive woes by wretched Orpheus waked, Indignant raging for his ravisht spouse. She headlong flying, headlong to her doom, From thy pursuit the river-banks along, Spurn'd with unheedful steps in the high reed A hydra huge that by the rivage housed. The hill-tops, then, with their lamentings loud, In chorus, her companion Dryads fill'd: Deep moan'd the Rhodopeian mountains: moan'd Craggy Pangæa, and the region wild Of Rhesus: moan'd those realms the Getæ: Hebrus: and where, from Athens, the North Wind Bore ravisht Orithyia to his haunt. But he, his heart's love-sickness solacing To a hollow shell, the lonesome shores along, Thee, at the dawning of the day, sweet wife, Thee, at the darkening, solitary sung. “Down, even, through the jaws of Tænarus, down To the high doors of Dis, and that black grove, With hideous darkness horrible, he went: Down to the Manes, and their dreadful king, And hearts to human prayers implacable. Moved by his music from the nether seats Of Erebus, lean shades and lightless shapes Came flocking, thick as birds, at eventide, In multitudes, that to the woodlands wing, Or from the hills are driven by winter rains: Matrons, and men, and bodies with no life Of high-soul'd heroes, and unwedded maids, Children, and youths upon the funeral pyre Before the faces of their parents stretch'd: Whom the slow ooze of that unlovely marsh About Cocytus binds with sooty slime And shapeless sedge, or ninefold Styx constrains. “Amazement all the habitations husht Of Tartarus, and the inmost depths of death, And those cold tangled coils of livid snakes Woven in the locks of the Eumenides: Cerberus his three silenced jaws withheld Wide gaping: and Ixion's orbèd wheel, Still'd from the whirling of the wild wind, stood. “Anon, returning, all those perils 'scaped, With his restored Eurydice, what time He reach'd the upper airs (behind him she: For such command Proserpina imposed), That lover rash his frenzied fancy seized; Fault to forgive, if Death forgiveness knew! Sudden he paused: and his Eurydice, —His, now that day's true light is reach'd at last, Unmindful, by his love, alas, o'ercome, Turn'd to behold: thus all his labour lost: Broken his pact with Death's unpardoning lord: And thrice, from all his fens, Avernus shriek'd! “‘Ah, what hath lost me, miserable,’ she moan'd, ‘Orpheus, and thee? what fatal frenzy this? Me, hark! once more the cruel Fates recall, And sleepy death my swimming sight obscures. Farewell! For I fare hence, in the vast night That gathers round me, and in vain to thee Weak hands am waving; thine, alas, no more!’ Speaking, she faded sudden from his sight, Like vapour mixt with unsubstantial air: Nor him, yet yearning ah how much to say, And shadows pale with frustrate passion clasping, She any more beheld: for never more The ferryman of Orcus to o'erpass The opposing deep permitted. What to do Is left him? whither should he turn? to whom Appeal, who mourns a now twice-ravisht spouse? The Manes by what weeping, by what voice Of wail may he the Nether Powers, appease? She, cold, meanwhile, in Stygian bark is borne. “Him, rumour'd tales report, for seven whole months Continuous, weeping on a windy crag Far off by Strymon's solitary wave: Charm'd from their lairs by his melodious moan, Came tigers, creeping under caverns cold, Lull'd into languor, and the lured oak trees. So Philomela in the poplar shade Laments, bewailing her departed brood, Whom, haply, passing, the hard ploughman spied, And from the nest, yet callow, filch'd: but she Mourns, brooding night by night upon the bough, There pours and pours her miserable song And with sad plainings fills the region round. “No woman's beauty him, nor wedlock, soothed. Lonely along the Hyperborean wilds Of ice, and frosty Tanaïs, and the wolds Unwidow'd ever of Rhiphæan snows Wandering, his lost Eurydice he wail'd, And the vain gifts of Dis. Stung by his scorn “Quo muncre, &amp;c.” By which pious office of his rendered indignant, &amp;c. The Thracian women, in the revels fierce Of midnight Bacchus, and the season due To rights divine, the youth asunder rent, And wide upon the wilds his ruins strew'd. Even then, tho' from the marble shoulders torn, The while his head Œagrian Hebrus whirl'd Down the mid-stream, still ‘Ah Eurydice!’ ‘Hapless Eurydice!’ from chilly lips The voice call'd ever; and the parting soul ‘Eurydice!’ ‘Eurydice!’ the rocks All down the stream re-echoed as it roll'd.” Thus Proteus: and adown the steep he sprang, Plunged, and the bubbling billow above him whirl'd. But not Cyrene. “Son,” to him, o'erawed, Returning lightly, “Put away,” she said, “Sad thoughts out of thy heart. Of thy mischance This the sole cause. For this, unhappy boy, The woodland Nymphs, with whom her wont it was In the high groves to wake the choral dance, Death on thy bees have sent. But, suppliant, thou Bring offerings, and imploring peace, revere The mild Napææ that to votive gifts, In wrath relentful, light forgiveness grant. The manner, first, of thy beseeching them In order due will I declare. Four bulls Well-chosen, and in shape surpassing all, Of those, now thine, that on the summits feed Of green Lycæus, and, by yoke untoucht, Heifers as many more, do thou select: Therewith, four altars to those goddesses, In their high precincts, build: and from the throats Of these let forth the sacred blood: and leave The bodies of them in the leafy grove. Then, when her rising the ninth dawn reveals, Lethæan poppies to the nether ghost Of Orpheus offer: and a heifer slay, With a black sheep, appeased Eurydice Revering thus: and to the grove return.” Nor linger'd he. But those maternal words Duteous obey'd. Forth to the hallow'd groves He went: and there the altars raised, and there Four chosen bulls, in shape surpassing all, And heifers by the yoke as yet untoucht As many more, he led. Anon, what time, This done, her rising the ninth dawn reveal'd, Lethæan poppies to the nether ghost Of Orpheus given, he to the grove return'd. But there a wonder, sudden, and to tell Surpassing strange, was witness'd. All about Those bulls' half-molten entrails, and deep down I' the heifer's womb, a sound of humming bees, That, bubbling up from out the bursten ribs, Swarm'd forth in clouds innumerable: and now They fly together on the tall tree-tops, And from the bended boughs in cluster hang. LUCRETIUS. INVOCATION TO VENUS AND INTRODUCTION OF THE EPICUREAN PHILOSOPHY. PARAPHRASE. (De rerum natura, lib. 1.) Benignant Mother of the Ænead race, Venus, to gods and men delightful! Thou That, underneath the sliding signs of heaven, With concourse throngest the ship-bearing sea And fruitful earth: by whose conceiving, all That lives doth leap into the light o' the sun: Thee, Goddess, thee, at thine approach, the winds Flee, and the skyey clouds: the dœdal earth To thee her flow'rets sweet uprears: to thee The waters wide of Ocean laugh, and all The stainless heaven in full-pour'd light is clear. Soon as the vernal forehead of the day Unveil'd appears, what time the procreant gale Of free Favonius nimbly breathes abroad, Thee, Goddess, and thy comings, thrill'd at heart By thy strong sweetness, first the aëry birds Herald; and then, their happy haunts about, The wild herds bound, and swim the torrent brooks. So taken by delight of thy sweet lures With fond desire, the life of all that lives To follow thee, where'er thou wilt, is fain; Till last, amid the seas, among the hills, And by the flowing of the headlong streams, Green grassy lawns, and leafy homes of birds, In every breast implanting balmy love, Each, in his several kind, thou dost constrain With lusty heart life's ages to renew. Sole, who dost universal nature sway, Since without thee may never aught arise Into the regions of celestial light, Nor lovely aught, nor aught delightful be, Thee my divine associate I desire In verses yet unwritten, to reveal The Nature of the Universe of Things, Which now I meditate for Memmius' son, Memmius my friend; whom, Goddess, thou hast will'd, Gifted in all, at all times to excel. So much the more, Divine Inspirer, grant Enduring sweetness to these words of mine: And lull, meanwhile, war's barbarous business all To slumbrous rest the lands and seas around: For thou alone our mortal hearts canst help With hushful peace. Since Mars armipotent, That over war's wild labours lorddom wields, Oft in thy lap, by love's eternal wound O'ermaster'd, flings himself; and, gazing up (His full firm-moulded throat back-sloped at ease), Into his soul thy sweetness there he breathes, There feeds on love his famisht looks, the while His sigh'd-forth spirit upon thy lip doth hang. O'er him, so leaning, as thy sacred form, O Goddess, all its fluent beauty bends, Pour from thy lips a language of soft sounds, And for thy Romans, O Renown'd, beseech Untroubled peace. For, neither may we hope With even mind, in this uneven hour That shakes the land, our purpose to pursue, Nor Memmius' noble scion, in a time So toss'd, be wanting to the common weal. For what remains, to me, O Memmius, lend Thine ears' free listening; and, from cares withdrawn, Thyself to truth's pure argument address. Nor yet, despised ere comprehended, spurn My gifts, for thee, with studious zeal, disposed. For of the supreme order of the spheres, The gods, and nature's primal sources all, Discourse with thee I purpose; and to show Whence nature all things doth to being bring, Put forth, and nourish; whither, also, she Anon, dissolving, doth restore them all. These, in the rendering of our argument, Matter, we call; the elemental seeds And generative substances of things; Naming them primal; since all things that are From these, the first, derivatively come. For all the being of the gods must needs, Of its own nature, perfect peace enjoy, Living immortally, far off removed From all this coil of sublunary things: Exempt from peril, from all pain exempt, Itself to itself sufficing, and of us Naught needing, neither by the good, nor ill Men do, disposed to favour or to wrath. What time man's life before his own eyes lay Low grovelling, ground to earth beneath the weight Of grim Religion, that from cloudy air Her lifted head in heaven put forth, and stood High over men with horrible countenance, A man in Greece, then first of all mankind, Dared to uplift, against her, mortal eyes, And, fearless fronting, firm withstand, her. Him Nor rumours of the gods, nor thunder-bolts, Nor heaven with muttering menace, could dismay But rather all the more within him roused Sharp courage, and the yearning of his soul To be the first to shatter the shut bars Of Nature's portals. Therefore, his soul's strength Prevail'd: and he, in high procedure, far O'erpass'd the wide world's burning boundary walls, And traversed in the spirit and the thought The vast immeasurable infinite. Thence, now, triumphant, he to us reports What may be; what may not be; what, in fine, Is the capacity of all things; what The bound abysmal. Whence, in turn, brought down And trodden 'neath our feet Religion writhes. Us level with heaven's height his victory sets. DANTE. THE FIRST CANTO OF THE INFERNO. PARAPHRASE. (In terza rima.) Upon the journey of our life midway Methought that, from the right path stray'd, I stood In a wood obscure. Full hard it is to say How savage, rough, and stubborn, was that wood: Whereof such dread as death can scarce excel My thought renews. But, to set forth the good Which there I found, I needs must also tell What other things I did encounter there. Into this wood how me the chance befell To enter, memory may not well declare, So full of slumber was I at that place Whence, leaving the true path, I wander'd here. But, soon as I had near'd a mountain's base, Whereby the vale subsided, that with fear My heart had pierced, I, lifting up my face, Beheld his shoulders in the rays, now clear, Of that full planet robed, which pilots right Man's every path. Whereat, were quieted A little the long stirrings of affright That in the hollow of my heart were bred By the so piteous passage of the night. And even as one that, with back-turnèd head, When up from out of ocean 'scaped to shore, Pants, and the perilous deep doth wistful scan, So turn'd my spirit, flying still, to explore That pass yet never left by living man. Anon, athwart the wilderness, once more I, after rest of wearied limbs, began To foot the upward path; where of my feet The one firm-set was lowest all the way. And lo, a lithe she-leopard, passing fleet, With fur of many colours coated gay, Hard by the upslope! Nor would she retreat Thenceforth from sight, but round my path didplay Till oft I turn'd with purpose back to fare. It was the season when the morning springs, And now, amid the stars that with him were When Love Divine first moved those beauteous things, The sun was rising. Hope the happy air, The season sweet, and gay apparellings Of that bright beast inspired: yet 'twas not so With me, but what my hope was made worse dread By vision of what seem'd a lion, who Against me came with high-uplifted head, And all so hunger-mad, 'twas even as tho' Air's self the awe of him disquieted. Therewith a she-wolf, that did look to be Stuff'd in her leanness with all lusts; and, long Ere now, with miseries manifold hath she Made lean the life of many a mortal throng. So huge a heaviness she cast on me, Wrought from her aspect fierce, of fear so strong, That of the height all hope I lost. As one, Glad of his getting, when to him is nigh The time that takes it from him, maketh moan With all his being's might, even so was I, In such a sudden sorrow so far gone; By that unpeaceable beast continually Tormented; which, sore baffling me, at last Little by little drove me backward where The sun is silent. There, down ruining fast, Nigh to the nether space, my sense was ware Of one before me in the wildness vast, That, for long silence, seem'd faint-voiced. To him, Soon as I saw him, “Pity me!” I cried, “Whate'er thou beest, true man, or shadow dim.” “No man: but what was once man,” he replied. “Lombards were my begetters, both of them, And Mantuans they, by country, either side. Myself sub Julio born, though late, at Rome Beneath benign Augustus dwelt, i' the day Of feign'd and fabling gods. Poet, him come From Troy, just offspring of Anchises grey, When burn'd was Ilium, once his haughty home, I sung. But thou, why dost thou rather, say, To perils such return, than scale yon mount Delightful, source and cause of every bliss?” “O art thou Virgil, and indeed that fount Whence such full flow of utterance streams?” to this I, with shamed forehead, answer'd, “Thee I count The light and honour of all song that is! Requite me my much love, and study slow, That me to search thy volume have constrain'd. Thou art my master, and my maker thou, Thou only he of whom I have obtain'd That style whose beauty me makes honour'd now! Behold what beast compels me leave ungain'd That height! O famed for wisdom, from her paw That shakes my veins and pulses, save me!” He, Soon as the weeping of my woe he saw, Made response to me, “Other pathway thee Behoves it to attempt, if from the jaw Of this wild desert thou thyself would'st free. She against whom thou clamourest, that she-beast, Lets no man pass her, but doth all impede Even to the death. The greed of whose grim breast So cursèd is, not anything can feed Her ravenous lust, which, ever after feast, Worse famine than before doth in her breed. Many the beasts wherewith she couples be, And many more they shall be, till arrive That Greyhound which shall pine her heart, till she Wretchedly perish. Not by land shall live, Nor yet by lucre, but by wisdom, he, And love and virtue. And his folk shall thrive 'Twixt either Feltro. He shall lift on high That so-low-fallen Italy for whose sake Maiden Camilla in time past did die, Euryalus, Nisus, Turnus: and shall make From his pursuing through all cities fly Back into Hell her that Hell's bound to break Hate first impell'd. I, therefore, for thy good Considering, thee now counsel and commend To follow me. And I, from out this wood Thy guide will be, with whom thou mayest wend That everlasting deep where dwells the brood Of those whose desperate shrieks thine ears shall rend, And gaze on spirits of the former time In dole, demanding second death; then who, Content, in fire endure, with hope to climb Hereafter, whensoever time be due, To the beatified: whose blissful clime If thou to visit then aspirest too, Unto that end another spirit shall be; Worthier than I; to whose high ministering Thee will I, then departing, leave. For me He that above hath empire and is king Holds rebel to his law, and doth decree That by my means shall none have entering Into His state. He in all parts hath sway, But there His throne is, there His palace high, There doth He chiefly dwell. O happy they Whom there He chooses!” And to him, then I, “O poet, by that God that in thy day Thou didst not know (this ill and worse to fly) I charge thee, lead me where thou said'st, aright; That I may see Saint Peter's Gate, and those That, by thy showing, be in such sad plight.” Onward he moved: and I behind him close. FRANCESCA DA RIMINO. PARAPHRASE. (Fifth Canto of the Inferno.) When of my Teacher I had learn'd the names Of those renownèd knights of other days, And theirs, the former time's most famous dames, Lost in sad wonder, after mute amaze, “Bard,” I began, “much is my heart inclined To parley with yon twain that, where I gaze, Seem coming, borne so light upon the wind.” And he to me: “Their nearer neighbouring note; Then, by the love that moves them, thus entwined, Charge them, and they will come.” No sooner smote The swift gust near us, which those spirits, join'd, Did simultaneous to our sight upfloat, Than, moved to utterance, “Come! O come,” I cried, “Afflicted souls! nor yet to our inquiring Deny discourse, if by nought else denied,” As doves, solicited by fond desiring, To their loved nest, on steady wings and wide, Through air are wafted by the sweet inspiring Of their own wishes swift; so, parting there Dido's dim throng, the twain toward us sail'd In such wise speeding through that evil air; So much my cry compassionate prevail'd. “O being that, beneficent and fair, Through this obscure comest, visiting,” they wail'd, “Us that have earth embrued with bloody stain, Were He, the Universal King, our friend, Since thou hast pity on our pitiless pain, Prayers to Him we for thy peace would send. Whate'er to hear, or haply tell, thou art fain, To tell or hear, thy bidding we attend, What time, as now, the wind is whist. The land That bore me seaward lies where Po proceeds Down, with his sequent waters, to his rest. Love, that in gentle heart scant kindling breeds, Him, by the fairness of the form that drest This spirit once (and yet indignant bleeds Sharp memory of its taking off!) possest; Love, that in one beloved doth love beget, Me too well pleased with pleasing him, so well That, as thou seest, he hath not left me yet: Love led us to one death: Caïna's hell Waits him that spilt our lives.” Such response met My sense, from such resentful sorrowing sent, That so long, for the sadness of it, was My countenance in such dejection bent, The Poet cried, “What musest thou?” “Alas!” I answer'd, “What sweet thoughts, what fond intent Have brought them to this miserable pass!” Then, yet once more returning to the two, “Francesca, pitifullest tears,” I cried, “For thy deep woes I weep. Yet tell me how To him and thee did Love the means provide, First in the time of your sweet sighs, to know Your yet uncertain wishes?” She replied, “There is no greater pang than to recall In misery days of happiness that were. And that thy Teacher knows. Yet I, if all So deep be thy desire to see laid bare Of our love's growth the root original, Will speak as one that weeping tells his care. For pleasant passing of the time, one day, Of love-thrall'd Launcelot the tale we read: We were alone: all danger far away From our suspecting: though the colour fled Our faces oft, and oft our looks to stray Into each other's eyes that reading led. One point alone o'ercame us. We the while Thus reading still, still unsuspecting ever, When as we read of that so long'd-for smile That such deep love did, with such dear endeavour, To so sweet kissing of sweet lips beguile, He that from me shall be disparted never Me on the mouth all trembling kist. Accurst The felon book was, and its scribe as well! “Galeotto fu il libro, e chi lo scrisse.” Those commentators who affirm that the Galeotto of this line is the proper name of Galahad are probably right. They have, at least, ample warrant for their opinion in the sixty-sixth chapter of the Italian Romance of Lancilotto, relating “Come la Reina conobbe Lancilotto . . . e come la prima congiunzione fu fatta fra Lancilotto e Ginevra per lo mezzo di Galeotto.” The obvious sense of the passage is that both the book and its author were go-betweens. But, although the go-between of the Italian Romance is called Galahad,—a name which probably was to Dante's Italian contemporaries (as that of Shakespeare's Pandarus was, and is, to Englishmen) a synonym for pimp, yet, in any case, the force of Dante's supposed allusion to him would be lost upon English readers who cannot associate the memory of the “Virgin Knight” with the ignoble character and functions ascribed to the Galahad of the Italian tale. For this reason I am content to take the simple common meaning of the word galeotto, viz., a felon— a scoundrel—the French galérien. Mr. Cary, indeed, translates the line thus— “The book and writer both were love's purveyors;” but this euphuistic paraphrase appears to me to convey no sense of the denunciatory intensity of Francesca's abrupt and startling exclamation. There is a dramatic effect in the angry suddenness with which the narrator of the tragedy breaks off her narration by an implied curse, just at the point where the situation she is describing was broken into, and abruptly ended, by a crime: and I think it little matters how you translate this word galeotto, so long as you retain unimpaired the imprecatory force which it gives to the whole passage. O. M. That day we read no more. While thus the first, The other spirit made moan so miserable That, by sick pity all my sense disperst, Down, as to earth a dead corpse falls, I fell.” MICHELAGNOLO BUONARROTI SONNETS AND MADRIGALS. IMITATED. THE BIRTH OF LOVE. I know not if, in waking dream, or sleep, His light, that made her, on my soul hath shined; Or if from out the memory or the mind Aught else of brightness, pour'd, my spirit doth steep. Perchance within me some late beam I keep Of Heaven's original glory left behind; Some smouldering sense of scarce I know what kind Of sweetest pain; whence I perforce must weep. Not of myself, nor can I well declare Whence, is the power that in me moves, and guides My dazzled heart through every new surprise. But, since I saw you, lady, thus I fare, Whom bitter sweet with yes and no divides. Doubtless 'tis all the doing of your eyes. LOVE VINDICATED. Call it not impious crime, nor mortal sin, That noble love that mighty Beauty excites In him whose softly-opening heart invites Some beam of holier light to enter in. Love wakes, and moves; and plumes his wings to win His upward goal. And oft the soul, that slights Her earthly home, to Heaven's ancestral heights Doth, by his ardour lured, her flight begin. The love that speaks of thee aspires on high, Nor feebly burns nor falters. To obey A baser passion my true heart were shamed. True Love for Heaven, as Lust for Earth, doth sigh: This doth the soul, that doth the senses, sway: And at ignoble mark his bow is aim'd. MADRIGALS. I. Me, though unbound yet free in vain, What fetter binds and brings to thee? If sight of thee, with unseen chain, Can fetter those thyself would'st free, What power have I those eyes to flee Whose warm desire The darts of Love hath dipt in fire? II. Why memory of those eyes, and the dear hope Whereby I live not only, but am blest, From hour to hour do all my days beguile, Demand the cause, wherewith in vain I cope, Of Love, and Nature, that allow no rest, And the fond wont that mine hath been long while With all life's hours to pile Love's monument to thee. Life soon were death, could life no longer see Your light, sweet eyes: For all my life is by your light begot, And soon it dies If banisht, after birth, to any spot Unsweeten'd by the light that in you lies. III. How is it, that I am mine no more? Who from myself hath banisht me? Who in myself more seems to be At home, than was myself before? How hath it happ'd, that I should miss The moment when she slipp'd so slyly Into my heart? and what is this, This wistful love, that through the eyes Into the soul doth steal so shyly, And, there grown bold and wanton, tries A thousand ways of exit wily? IV. If, here, in sculptured stone, Whereto erewhile did Art her form consign, That form, while years roll on, May live, O what with her sweet self,—divine Not to mine only, but all mortal sight— By Heaven shall then be done? Since she Heaven's making is; this marble, merely mine! Yet must she fade, and follow Time's brief flight; And all her beauty is but hers in spite, If Death, that takes her life, the dead stone spare. What shall repair This wrong to Nature done by Time's disdain, If, while her son's works stay, her own be ta'en? V. While, to the call of Time, my days fleet fast, Love still disputes Time's power, Nor will forego one hour That's owed him yet, despite the long years past. My soul, that groans and cries As one that, injured, dies, Laments in me my better life downcast. 'Twixt what to bless and blast Hath power,—'twixt Death and Love, Dubious, my vext heart strove To choose the best, yet doth it hug the worst. Thus by bad custom is good counsel curst. CANZONE. Low doth life's flame burn down, and faint, in me, Fast as from fallen thunder fades away The fluttering fire that wing'd his ardent flight. Love, all thine ancient hurts I pardon thee: But my faint heart, where chill'd thy hot darts stay, Deep wounded once, doth no new wounds invite. If all thy fires these languid eyes could light, The worn-out heart would not rekindle now Its long-quench'd glow. Wherefore I shun thee, Love, in self-disdain; Too weak a wearying war to wage again. Me, by new beauty, would'st thou, haply, lure Back to the perilous pass, my dull desire, Warn'd by old woes, will now no more essay? Worst are those ills which later years endure: And I should be as ice before the fire, That doth not kindle, but dissolves away. Death, from the danger of my later day Sole saviour now, must pluck me from the harm Of thy fierce arm, That, working woe by sight of others' weal, Still strives to whirl a long arrested wheel. My soul, with whom Death parleys, doth prepare, Taking cold counsel of herself, within Sad shade of solemn thoughts that neighbour night, This body soon to leave behind her, where Her ghostly journey must, ere long, begin; Which mingled hope and fear but dimly light. Ah, Love! how fierce thou standest, full in sight Of my sad eyes; strong-arm'd, from me to rend, What me defend, These timely thoughts of Death; that thy wild hours May from a wither'd tree snatch leaves and flowers! What can I more? What owe I thee? My debt Is paid in full. More hours can he afford Whose past's whole wealth thy greedy garner stocks? What craft or what compulsion back may get To thee my homage gone, ungenerous lord, Who mak'st the pain thy seeming pity mocks? The soul that hath undone her dungeon locks, And loosed her bonds, knows better than again To hug her chain, And all her new-found freedom, fool'd, forego His service to resume, that wrought her woe. Whatever earth brings forth earth takes again: And more and more all mortal beauty fleets: Who loves (and this know I) is never free: Near neighbour is great pleasure to great pain: And most by those that deepest drain the sweets The bitters in life's chalice tasted be. O tyrant Love, what is thy will of me? Wilt thou that I, oblivious of past ill, Be thy fool still, While the scant time, my near departure claims, Be spent by thee on sorrows and on shames? Go, song of mine, from ice by fire begot! And haply if Love meet thee by the way, Bid him delay To war with one that challenges him not: Tell him, he wins no glory by the blow That smites a long-already-fallen foe. RONSARD. SONNETS AND CHANSONS. PARAPHRASES. “Voici le bois que ma saincte Angelette.” Here is the wood that freshen'd to her song: See here the flowers that keep her footprints yet: Where, all alone, my saintly Angelette Went wandering with her maiden thoughts along: Here is the little rivulet where she stopp'd: And here the greenness of the grass shows where She linger'd through it, searching here and there Those daisies dear which in her breast she dropp'd: Here did she sing: and here she wept: and here Her smile came back: and there I seem to hear Those faint half-words wherewith my heart is rife: There did she sit: there childlike did she dance To some vague impulse of her own romance. Ah, Love on all these thoughts unwinds my life! “Cache pour cest nuict.” Hide for a night thy horn, good Moon! Fair fortune For this shall keep Endymion ever prest Deep-dreaming amorous on thine argent breast, Nor ever shall enchanter thee importune. Hateful to me the day: most sweet the night! I fear the myriad meddling eyes of day: But courage comes with night. Close, close, I pray, Your curtains, dear dark skies, on my delight! Thou, too, thou Moon, thou too hast felt love's power! Pan with a white fleece won thee for an hour. And you, siderial signs in yonder blue, Favour the fire whereby my heart is moved! Forget not, signs, the greater part of you Was only set in heaven for having loved. “Page suy moy.” Follow, my Page, where the green grass embosoms The enamell'd season's freshest-fallen dew: Then home, and my still house with handfuls strew Of frail-lived April's newliest-nurtured blossoms. Take from the wall, now, my song-tunèd lyre. Here will I sit, and charm out the sweet pain Of a dark eye whose light hath burn'd my brain, The unloving loveliness of my desire! And here mine ink, and here my papers, place: A hundred pages white, whereon to trace A hundred words of desultory woe: Words which shall last like graven diamonds sure, That some day hence a future race may know, And ponder on, the pain that I endure. “Les espics sont à Ceres.” Ceres hath her harvests sweet: Chloris hath the young green grass: Woods for Fauns with cloven feet: His green laurel Phœbus has: Minerva hath her olive tree: And the pine's for Cybele. Sweet sounds are for Zephyr's wings: Sweet fruit for Pomona's bosom: For the Nymphs are crystal springs: And for Flora bud and blossom: But sighings, weepings, sad ideas, These alone are Cytherea's. “Ma douce jouvence.” My sweet youth now is all done: The strength and the beauty are gone: The tooth now is black: and the head now is white: And the nerves now are loos'd: in the veins Only water (not blood now) remains Where the pulse beat of old with delight. Adieu! O my lyre! O adieu You sweet women, my lost loves! and you, Each dead passion! The end creepeth nigher. Not one pastime of youth has kept pace With my age: nought is left in their place But the bed, and the cup, and the fire. My head is confused with low fears, And sickness, and too many years, Some care in each corner I meet. And wherever I linger, or go, I turn back, and look after, to know If Death be still dogging my feet: Dogging me down the dark stair That windeth, I cannot tell where, To some Pluto, that opens for ever His cave to all comers: alas, How easily down it all pass, And return from it—never, ah never! DANISH. Und wenn ein Irrlicht euch die Wege weisen soll, So müst ihr's so genau nicht nehmen. THE ELVES. IMITATIONS. 1 Stretching the tired limbs over the ground, Laying the head o'er the Elfin Mound, Seem'd I, or dream'd I, to hear and to see Two milk-white maidens come lightly to me, So lightly to me? I saw them but once: I shall see them no more. Dreaming is o'er. 2 Two milk-white maidens: two little elf-girls: One of them kist me under the curls: One of them whisper'd me warm in the ear “Up, and dance with us! the moon shines clear On mountain and mere.” I saw them but once: I shall see them no more. Dreaming is o'er. 3 “And look! and my sisters shall glance the sweet glances: And rise! and my sisters shall dance the sweet dances: And list! and my sisters shall sing the sweet songs.” And the Elves of the forest came round me in throngs, Around me in throngs! I saw them but once: I shall see them no more. Dreaming is o'er. 4 And a marvellous music in air was heard, And voices neither of breeze nor bird: And the torrent, that never before stood still, Stopp'd all at once of his own wild will On the windy hill. I saw them but once: I shall see them no more. Dreaming is o'er. 5 The torrent, that never before was at rest, Still'd every beat of his bubbling breast: And the little white delicate fishes all Danced. dimpling the diamond waterfall That stood like a wall. I saw them but once: I shall see them no more. Dreaming is o'er. 6 The little s'y fishes with silvery tails Paddled and play'd: and the nightingales And all the sweet things that live in the air Sang aloud down the valleys, and everywhere Through the moonlight fair. I saw them but once: I shall see them no more. Dreaming is o'er. 7 “And wilt thou be of us? and wilt thou be ours? We will play thee strange music, and ply thee strange powers: Dance thee sweet dances, and sing thee sweet tunes: And teach thee to read and to write the great runes That charm stars and moons.” I saw them but once: I shall see them no more. Dreaming is o'er. 8 “And that dreaming dragon, that sleepeth, roll'd Fold over fold, on a heap of red gold, Shall lift up the eyelid from over the eye, And sleepily see thee, and, seeing thee, fly To the desert, and die.” I saw them but once: I shall see them no more. Dreaming is o'er. 9 Round the elfin ring did the music flow: And they dancèd high, and they dancèd low. I watch'd them, drooping an eyelid bland, But grasping the glaive in the wary hand, Not trusting the band. I saw them but once: I shall see them no more. Dreaming is o'er. 10 And “Hearest thou? fearest thou, fool, to feel pleasure? Delayest thou? weighest thou mirth with a measure? We will give thee quick riddance: long rest from all strife: And cut off the cares that encumber thy life With a sharp, sharp knife.” I saw them but once: I shall see them no more. Dreaming is o'er. 11 If the cock had not crow'd at that moment so shrill, And the red dawn flicker'd far off on the hill, Which sent them all flitting, by tens and twelves, I might have been there with them yet, and the Elves Had my soul to themselves. But I saw them once only, and saw them no more. Dreaming is o'er. 12 Thou, that ridest by night over elfin ground, Lay not the head on the Elfin Mound. And let not the eyelid sink over the eye: For the Elves are fair: and the Elves are sly: And a man might die. Once only I saw them: I see them no more. Dreaming is o'er. LORD OLAF. PART I. 1 To the merry wedding feast to bid the wedding guest, Light, Lord Olaf, unespied, in the middle night doth ride: But the dance flies fast through the hollow, hollow wood, And the white women dance in the wild wood. 2 O the merry, merry wives! fair they dance by fours and fives: But the Elf Queen of them all ... he hath heard the Elf Queen call, And the dance flies fast through the hollow, hollow wood, While the white women dance in the wild wood. 3 “Hail, Lord Olaf, to the dance! while the moon is in a trance, And the shade is on the tree, get thee down and dance with me, For the dance flies fast through the hollow, hollow wood, And the white women dance in the wild wood.” 4 “Nay, nay,” he answer'd, “nay, I may neither list nor stay, For to-morrow, O to-morrow is my merry marriage day.” But the dance flies fast through the hollow, hollow wood, And the white women dance in the wild wood. 5 “List, Lord Olaf! an'ye will dance with me by yonder hill, Ye shall have a sark of silk, soft as sleep and white as milk.” And the dance flies fast through the hollow, hollow, wood, And the white women dance in the wild wood. 6 “Hist! a silken sark snow-white: for my mother bleach'd it bright In the mad moonlight, in the middle of the night.” O the dance flies fast through the hollow, hollow, wood, And the white women dance in the wild wood. 7 “Nay, I may no more delay; neither list to what ye say; For to-morrow, for to-morrow is my merry marriage day.” But the dance flies fast through the hollow, hollow wood, And the white women dance in the wild wood. 8 “List, Lord Olaf! an' with me ye will dance by yonder tree, Ye shall have a scarf of gold broider'd bright on scarlet fold.” And the dance flies fast through the hollow, hollow wood, And the white women dance in the wild wood. 9 “Take the golden scarf away! I may neither look nor stay: For to-morrow, O to-morrow, is my merry marriage day.” But the dance flies fast through the hollow, hollow wood, And the white women dance in the wild wood. 10 “Hist, Lord Olaf! scarlet fold, broider'd gay with burning gold: For I wrought it in the cold of the cavern'd hills of old.” O the dance flies fast through the hollow, hollow wood, And the white women dance in the wild wood. 11 “Keep, O keep the silken sark, and the golden scarf! for hark, From the far off forest dells comes a sound of bridal bells!” But the dance flies fast through the hollow, hollow wood, And the white women dance in the wild wood. 12 “An' ye will not dance with me, list, Lord Olaf, ye shall be Fairest bridegroom ever borne to his grave on bridal morn.” Ho! the dance flies fast through the hollow, hollow wood, And the white women dance in the wild wood. 13 Light she leapt to his red horse: “Now ride on across the gorse! “Ride!” she cried, “Not every bride clasps a dead man to her side!” And the dance flies fast through the hollow, hollow wood, And the white women dance in the wild wood. PART II. 1 Pale, Lord Olaf stood before his own good castle door, And his mother from the gate call'd “Lord Olaf, why so late?” The Elf Queen, the Elf Queen, her kissing is so cold! 2 “And, Lord Olaf, do ye ail? Why, son Olaf, why so pale? For thy cheek is white as death, and there's blood upon the heath.” The Elf Queen, the Elf Queen, her kissing is so cold! 3 “Mother, mother, much I ail: and my cheek may well be pale. Evil, evil was the chance! I have seen the Elf Queen dance. The Elf Queen, the Elf Queen, whose kissing is so cold!” 4 “Hold! what say ye, O my son? and what is it ye have done? And what shall I tell thy bride?” “Tell her, tell her that I ride,” (O Elf Queen, O Elf Queen, thy kissing is so cold!) 5 “That I ride around, around in the forest, with my hound: In the forest through the gorse, to try my red roan horse.” But the Elf Queen, the Elf Queen, her kissing is so cold! 6 Blithely blows the castle horn for the merry marriage morn: And the silver music swells from the swinging bridal bells. But the Elf Queen, the Elf Queen, her kissing is so cold! 7 Come the minstrels: comes the priest: with the merry wedding guest: And the bride with the bride maiden: and the banquet board is laden. The Elf Queen, the Elf Queen, her kissing is so cold! 8 And the hydromel is pour'd, and the red wine, round the board. “Mother, mother, where is he that should be here with me?” The Elf Queen, the Elf Queen, her kissing is so cold! 9 “O he rides around, around in the forest with his hound; In the forest, through the gorse with his greyhound and his horse.” The Elf Queen, the Elf Queen, her kissing is so cold! 10 “Nay, his horse is in the stall, and his greyhound in the hall: And O, dear as these may be, more Lord Olaf loveth me!” The Elf Queen, the Elf Queen, her kissing is so cold! 11 “Long his horse may stand in stall, and his greyhound bide in hall: Weary men do slumber deep: and he lyeth in a sleep.” The Elf Queen, the Elf Queen, her kissing is so cold! 12 Then the scarlet cloth she raised, and upon his face they gazed: And fear fell upon them all, the feasters in that hall. The Elf Queen, the Elf Queen, her kissing is so cold! 13 “O maiden, maiden, weep! He that sleepeth such a sleep Needeth but a narrow bed!” Not a word the maiden said. The Elf Queen, the Elf Queen, her kissing is so cold! 14 On the mournful morrow morn three corpses forth were borne: From the castle corpses three: and two were fair to see. O Elf Queen, O Elf Queen, thy kissing is so cold! SERVIAN. Omne meum: nihil meum. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO. I. The Sultan Murad o'er Kossovo comes With banners and drums. There, all in characters fair, He wrote a letter; and there Bade his estaffettes despatch To bear it to Krouchevatch, To the white-wall'd town of the Tzar, To the hands of Prince Lazar. “Listen, Lazarus, chief of the Serbs, to me! That which never hath been, that which never shall be, Is that two lords one land should sway, And the same rayas two tributes pay. Send to me, therefore, the tributes and keys; The golden keys of each white town; And send me a seven years' tribute with these. But if this thou wilt not do, Then come thou down over Kossovo: On the field of Kossovo come thou down, That we may divide the land with our swords. These are my words.” When Lazarus this letter had read, Bitter, bitter were the tears he shed. II. A grey bird, a falcon, comes flying apace From Jerusalem, from the Holy Place; And he bears a light swallow abroad. It is not a grey bird, a falcon, God wot! But the Saint Elias; and it is not A light swallow he bears from afar, But a letter from the Mother of God To the Tzar who in Kossovo stays. And the letter is dropt on the kness of the Tzar; And these are the words that it says:— “Lazarus, Prince of a race that I love, Which empire choosest thou? That of the heaven above? Or that of the earth below? If thou choose thee an earthly realm, Saddle horse, belt, spur, and away! Warriors, bind ye both sabre and helm, And rush on the Turks, and they With their army whole shall perish. But, if rather a heavenly crown thou cherish, At Kossovo build ye a temple fair. There no foundations of marble lay, But only silk of the scarlet dye. Range ye the army in battle-array, And let each and all full solemnly Partake of the blessèd sacrament there. For then of a certainty know Ye shall utterly perish, both thou, And thine army all; and the Turk shall be Lord of the land that is under thee.” When the Tzar he read these words, His thoughts were as long and as sharp as swords. “God of my fathers, what shall I choose? If a heavenly empire, then must I lose All that is dearest to me upon earth; But if that the heavenly here I refuse, What then is the earthly worth? It is but a day, It passeth away, And the glory of earth full soon is o'er, And the glory of God is more and more.” “What is this world's renown?” (His heart was heavy, his soul was stirr'd.) “Shall an earthly empire be preferr'd To an everlasting crown? At Kossovo build me a temple fair: Lay no foundations of marble down, But only silk of the scarlet dye.” Then he sent for the Servian Patriarch: With him twelve bishops to Kossovo went. It was at the lifting of the dark: They ranged the army in battle-array, And the army all full solemnly Received the blessed sacrament, And hardly was this done, when lo! The Turks came rushing on Kossovo. III. Ivan Kossantchitch, my pobratime What of the Turk? How deem ye of him? Is he strong, is he many, is he near? Our battle, say! may we show him? May we hope to overthrow him? What news of him bringest thou here? And Ivan Kossantchitch replied: “Milosch Obìlitch, my brother dear, I have lookt on the Turk in his pride. He is strong, he is many, he is near, His tents are on every side. Were we all of us hewn into morsels, and salted, Hardly, I think, should we salt him his meat. Two whole days have I journeyed, nor halted, Toward the Turk, near the Turk, round him, and never Could I number his numbers, or measure his end. From the Maple to Sazlia, brother, my feet Have wander'd; from Sazlia round by the river, Where the river comes round to the bridge with a bend; And over the bridge to the town of Zvétchan; From Zvétchan to Tchéchan, and further, and ever Further, and over the mountains, wherever Foot may fall, or eye may scan, I saw nought but the Mussulman. “Eastward and westward, and southward and nor'ward, Scaling the hillside, and scathing the gorse, Horseman to horseman, and horse against horse; Lances like forests when forests are black; Standards like clouds flying backward and forward, White tents like snowdrifts piled up at the back. The rain may, in torrents, fall down out of heaven, But never the earth will it reach: Nothing but horsemen, nothing but horses, Thick as the sands which the wild river courses Leave, after tempest, in heaps on the beach. Murad, for pasture, hath given To his horsemen the plain of Mazguite. Lances a-ripple all over the land, Tost like the bearded and billowy wheat By the winds of the mountain driven Under the mountain slab. Murad looks down in command Over Sitnitza and Lab.” “Answer me, Ivan, answer ye me, Where may the tent of Murad be? His milk-white tent, may one see it afar O'er the plain, from the mountain, or out of the wood? For I have sworn to the Prince Lazar A solemn vow upon Holy Rood, To bring him the head of the Turkish Tzar, And set my feet in his infidel blood.” “Art mad, my pobratime, art mad? Where may the tent be, the tent of Murad? In the midst of a million eyes and ears: In the midst of a million swords and spears, In the heart of the camp of the Turk. Fatal thy vow is, and wild is the work; For hadst thou the wings of the falcon, to fly Fleeter than lightning, along the deep sky, The wings of the falcon, though fleet be they, Would never bear thee thy body away.” And Milosch abjured him: “O Ivan, my brother (Tho' not by the blood, yet more dear than all other), See thou say nothing of this to our lord, Lest ye sorrow his heart; and say never a word, Lest our friends be afflicted, and fail. But thou Shalt rather answer to who would know, And boldly aver to the Tzar, ‘The Turk is many, but more are we, And easy and light is the victory: For he is not an army of men of war, But a rabble rather Of rascals that gather To promise of plunder from places afar; Priests and pedlars, Jugglers and fiddlers, Dancers and drummers, Varlets and mummers, Boys and buffoons—all craven loons That never in burly of battle have bled, Never have combated sword in hand; They are only come, the beggars, for bread, And to feed on the fat of the land. And the dreadful dismal dysentery Is among their men, and their horses die, Of a daily increasing malady.’” IV. Lazarus, lord of the Serbs, our Tzar, At Krouchevatch high Slava doth hold. Around him, sitting by cups of gold, His sons and his seigneurs are. To right, the reverend Youg Bogdan; Round whom the nine young Yougovitch; To left, that thrice-accursèd man, The traitor black, Vouk Brankovitch; And many a lord, along the board, And last of all, in the knightly train, Milosch, the manly Voïvod; Next him, Servian Voïvodes twain, Ivan Kossantchitch, his brother in God, And Milan Toplitza, a man without stain. And the Tzar bade pour the purple wine, And, brimming up his golden cup, Lookt all adown that lordly line. “To whom shall the King first pledge?” he began. “If first to age, this health should be, To no man do I drink but thee, Revered old Youg Bogdan; But if to rank or high degree, Vouk Brankovitch, I drink to thee. If to friendship be the toast, My brothers nine, I know not which Amongst you all I love the most, You gallant-hearted Yougovitch! If to beauty, then be thine, Ivan, first the flowing wine. If to length and strength of limb, Then the wine to Milan brim, No man measures height with him. If to valour, more than even Stature, beauty, friendship, age, Our first honours should be given, Then to Milosch must we pledge. Yet, be that as it may be, Milosch, I drink to none but thee! Milosch, thy health! Drink, man, drink! Why should any man care to think? Traitor or true, or friend or foe, To thee I drain this goblet low; And, ere to-morrow, at Kossovo, Thou thy master hast betray'd To the Turk, for wages paid, (Friend or foe, whate'er befall, True or traitor, what care I?) The King drinks to thee in his hall, Lip to lip, and eye to eye, Pledge me now in sight of all; And, since to thee I fill it up, Take thou too this golden cup, And add it to ill-gotten wealth— Milosch, thy health!” Lightly Milosch bounded up, Lightly caught the golden cup, To the black earth bow'd his head, And “Noble master, thanks!” he said, “For the pledge thou pledgest me, And thanks that, of thy courtesy, Thou to me dost first allot, A true, true health, O King, to thee, To pledge back in this golden token; Thanks for this, my lord, but not For the words which thou hast spoken. For, oh! (and may my loyalty, Dear liege, not fatal prove to me, Before the truth is judged between Us, and his fair company) My true heart is sound and clean, Traitor never have I been, Traitor never will I be! But at Kossovo to-morrow morn I trust, as I am a living man, A soldier and a Christian, To go to the death for the true, true faith, True to the last where my faith is sworn, Careless of calumny, scorning scorn! The traitor is sitting by thy side, He toucheth thy robe, thy wine he drinketh, To God and his king he hath foully lied, Vouk Brankovitch, the servile-eyed, Christian false, and perjured friend! God judge between us twain i' the end, And perish he in the thought he thinketh! To-morrow a noble day will be, For at Kossovo all men shall see What is the truth betwixt us two, And who is traitor, and who is true. For I swear by the great sun in the sky, And I swear by the living God on high That judgeth us all, whate'er befall, When at Kossovo upon battle-plain, Murad, the Turk, I have sought and slain (Sought and slain, for I swore by the rood To set my feet in his Turkish blood), If God but grant me safe and sane A living man to come again Back to white-wall'd Krouchevatch, And there that traitor foul I catch, Vouk Brankovitch, I will have by the throat. All men shall see it, and all men shall note, For it shall be done in the light of the sun. To my good war-lance I will fix his skull, As a woman fixes a ball of wool To her distaff when her spinning is done. Then I will bear him to Kossovo, Bear him back to the battle-plain; All men shall see it, and all men shall know Who is the traitor of us twain.” V. At the royal board a noble pair Sit together, and full sad they are. Lazarus and his Militza fair, The sweet-eyed Tzarina and the Tzar. Troubled is the Tzar's broad brow, The Tzarina's eyes are dim, And, with tears that dare not flow, The Tzarina says to him:— “Lord Lazarus, O golden crown Of Servia, and sweetheart my own! To-morrow morn to Kossovo With thee to the battle go Servitors and Voïvodes. I alone, in these abodes, Vacant of thy voice, remain; Hearing, haply, on the wind, Murmurs of the battle-plain; Heavy of heart, and sad of mind, Silent in sorrow, alone with pain. O think on this, my life, my lord, Never a soul to carry a word To Kossovo, from me to thee, To Krouchevatch from thee to me; Wherefore, lord of my brothers nine, The sons of Youg, our father old, (Golden stars in a crown of gold!) Let one, for once, be wholly mine. Mine to witness the tears I weep; Mine to solace the vigil I keep; Mine alone, of my nine brothers, To pray with me for those eight others; Of brothers nine, but leave me one To swear by when the rest be gone!” And Lazarus, lord of the Serbs, replied: “Militza, sweetheart, wife true-eyed, Of thy nine brothers, tell to me which Thou lovest best, that he should rest In our white palace to watch by thee. Which of them, sweetheart?—tell to me!” And she answer'd, “Bocko Yougovitch.” And Lazarus, lord of the Serbs, replied: “Militza, sweetheart, wife true-eyed, To-morrow, when from her red bower The watery dawn begins to break, Ere yet the sun hath felt his power Seek thou the city walls, and take Thy post against the Eastern gate: There shalt thou see the army pass, To mantle the field in martial state, And trample the dew-drop out of the grass. All lusty warriors, leal and true, Who in battle have never turn'd their backs, In complete steel, with curtle axe; Each spearman true, as his own true steel. And, foremost of all, that, with iron heel, Crush the wet violet down in the moss, With purple plumes, in vesture rich, Thy brother, Bocko Yougovitch, Bearing the standard of the Cross. Seize thou the golden bridle-ring, Greet him fair from his lord the king, And bid him that he the standard yield To whomsoever he deemeth best, And turn about from the battle-field, In our white palace with thee to rest.” VI. Now, when the dawn from her red bower Upclomb the chilly skies, and, all Athwart the freshening city tower, The silent light began to fall About the breezy yellow flower That shook on the shadowy city wall, Militza, through the glimmering streets, Goes forth against the Eastern gate. There, all i' the morning light, she meets The army on to the distant down, Winding out of the dusky town, To mantle the field in martial state, And trample the dew-drop out of the grass. O brothers, a goodly sight it was! With curtle axe, in complete steel, So many a warrior, lusty and leal, So many a spearman, stout and true, Marching to battle in order due. And foremost among that stately throng, With, over his helmet's golden boss, Floating plumes of the purple rich, The gallant Bocko Yougovitch Bearing the standard of the Cross. All blazing gold his corselet beam'd, Imperial purple fold on fold, The mighty Christian ensign stream'd Over his red-roan courser bold; And high upon the standard top Against the merry morning gleam'd An apple wrought of purest gold; Thereon the great gold cross, from which All glittering downward, drop by drop, Great golden acorns, lightly hung, Over his shining shoulder flung Flashes of light o'er Yougovitch. She caught the bridle ring: in check The red-roan courser paw'd the ground. About her brother's bended neck Her milk-white arm she softly wound, And half in hope, and half in fear, She whisper'd in the young man's ear:— “Brother, my liege and thine, the king, Commits me to thy comforting. He greets thee fair, and bids me say (The which with all my heart I pray) That thou the royal ensign yield To whomsoever thou deemest best, And turn about from the battle-field At Krouchevatch with me to rest, That of nine brothers I may have one To swear by when the rest be gone.” But “Foul befall,” the young man said, “The man that turns his horse's head, Whoe'er he be, from battle-plain: Turn thee, sister, turn again To thy white tower! I will not yield The Holy Cross 'tis mine to bear, Nor turn about from the battle-field. Not though the king should give, I swear, The whole of Krouchevatch to me, Would I turn thitherwards with thee. To-day will be the noblest day Yon sun in heaven did ever see; Nor shall my own true comrades say This day, in sorrow or scorn, of me, —‘The craven heart that dared not go To the great fight at Kossovo; That fear'd to find a saintly death, Nor pour'd his blood for Holy Rood, Nor fell for the Christian faith.’” He prickt his horse toward the gate, And, through a cloud of hoary mist Glittering like one great amethyst, Swept forth into the morning wan. Then up there rides in royal state, With his seven sons, old Youg Bogdan. She stopt them one by one; she took The bridle rein; she spoke to them all. Not one of them all would turn and look: Not one of them all would listen and wait; But the trumpet sounded in the gate, And they follow'd the trumpet call. And after these, a little space, Voïn Yougovitch not far She spied come riding at slow pace, Leading the destriers of the Tzar, All trapt and housed with gold be they, And going an amble by the way. His good steed was of dapple grey. She caught the bridle ring: in check The good grey courser paw'd the ground. Her milk-white arm she softly wound About her brother's bended neck; And half in hope, and half in fear. She whisper'd in the young man's ear:— “Brother, my liege, and thine, the king, Commits me to thy comforting. He greets thee fair, and bids me say (The which with all my heart I pray) That thou the royal destriers yield To whomsoever thou deemest best, And turn about from the battle-field In Krouchevatch with me to rest, That of nine brothers I may have one To swear by when the rest be gone.” But “Sister, foul befall,” he said, “The man that turns his horse's head, Whoe'er he be, from battle-plain: Turn thee, sister, turn again To thy white tower! I will not yield The destriers of my lord the Tzar, Nor turn about from the battle-field, Where all my noble kinsmen are, Albeit to meet my death I go To the great fight at Kossovo; To pour my blood for Holy Rood, To fight to the death for the Christian Faith, With my kinsmen all to fight and fall, With our foreheads against the foe.” Through the gate he prickt his steed, And off to the dreary downs afar, Leading as fast as he might lead The destriers of the Tzar. But Dame Militza, when no more She heard the echoing hoofs that bore Her brother from her, even as one From whom the light of life is gone, Fell swooning on the cold curb-stone. Then came the Tzar himself anon, And his great war-horse pacing on, Did stoutly neigh in lusty pride; But when he past beside that stone, He stopt, and stoopt, and swerv'd aside. There, all her fair white length o'erthrown, The Tzar his own true wife espied, And fast the bitter tears down ran, As he call'd to his servant Gouloban “Good Gouloban, my faithful friend, In this thy trusty service prove; From off thy milk-white horse descend, And, as thou dost thy master love, In thy true arms thy mistress take, With whom to her tall tower go; And, God forgive thee for my sake, But go not thou to Kossovo. I will requite thee when again I meet thee, if I be not slain, Howbeit, I deem my doom at hand, For the Turk is lord of half the land.” Down stept the trusty serving man, Full fast his bitter tears down ran, And sad was the heart of Gouloban. He lifted up that drooping flower, Lifted her on to his milk-white steed, And rode with her to her tall tower, As fast as he might speed. There laid he her in linen bed, And lowly laid her lovely head. But o'er the airy morning smote, Along the blowing breeze remote, A solitary trumpet note. Full well the milk-white war-horse knew The music of that martial sound, And in the courtyard paw'd the ground, And blithely from his nostrils blew The morning mist. Then Gouloban Adown the turret stairway ran, He leapt to stirrup, he leapt to selle, From fleeting hands he waved farewell; Again he heard the trumpet blow, And he rode back to Kossovo. VII. All when the misty morn was low, And the rain was raining heavily Two ravens came from Kossovo, Flying along a lurid sky: One after one, they perch'd upon The palace of the great Lazar, And sat upon the turret wall. One 'gan croak, and one 'gan call, “Is this the palace of the Tzar? And is there never a soul inside?” Was never a soul within the hall, To answer to the ravens' call, Save Militza. She espied The two black birds on the turret wall, That all in the wind and rain did croak, And thus the ravens she bespoke: “In God's great name, black ravens, say, Whence came ye on the wind to-day? Is it from the plain of Kossovo? Hath the bloody battle broke? Saw ye the two armies there? Have they met? And, friend or foe, Which hath vanquisht? How do they fare?” And the two black fowls replied: “In God's great name, Militza, dame, From Kossovo at dawn we came. A bloody battle we espied: We saw the two great armies there, They have met, and ill they fare. Fallen, fallen, fallen are The Turkish and the Christian Tzar. Of the Turks is nothing left; Of the Serbs a remnant rests, Hackt and hewn, rent and reft, Broken shields, and bloody breasts.” And lo! while yet the ravens spoke, Up came the servant, Miloutine: And he held his right hand, cleft By a ghastly sabre stroke, Bruised and bloody, in his left; Gasht with gashes seventeen Yawn'd his body where he stood, And his horse was dripping blood. “O sorrow, sorrow, bitter woe And sorrow, Miloutine!” she said; “For now I know my lord is dead. For, were he living, well I know, Thou hadst not left at Kossovo Thy lord forsaken to the foe.” And Miloutine spake, breathing hard: “Get me from horse: on cool greensward Lay me, lay me, mistress mine: A little water from the well, To bathe my wounds in water cold, For they are deep and manifold; And touch my lip with rosy wine, That I may speak before I die. I would not die before I tell The tale of how they fought and fell.” She got him from his bloody steed, And wiped the death-drops from his brow, And in the fresh grass laid him low; And washt his wounds in water cold, For they were deep and manifold; Full ghastly did they gape and bleed: She stanch'd them with her garment's fold, And lightly held his body up, And bathed his lips with rosy wine, And all the while her tears down ran, And dropt into the golden cup; And still she question'd of the war: “O tell me, tell me, Miloutine, Where fell the glorious Prince Lazar? Where are fallen my brothers nine? Where my father, Youg Bogdan? Where Milosch, where Vouk Brankovitch? And where Strahinia Banovitch?” Then when the servant, Miloutine, Three draughts had drain'd of rosy wine, Although his eyes were waxing dim, A little strength came back to him. He stood up on his feet, and, pale And ghastly, thus began the tale: “They will never return again, Never return! ye shall see them no more; Nor ever meet them within the door, Nor hold their hands. Their hands are cold, Their bodies bleach in bloody mould. They are slain! all of them slain! And the maidens shall mourn, and the mothers deplore, Heaps of dead heroes on battle plain. Where they fell, there they remain, Corpses stiff in their gore. But their glory shall never grow old Fallen, fallen, in mighty war, Fallen, fighting about the Tzar, Fallen, where fell our lord Lazar! Never more be there voice of cheer! Never more be there song or dance! Muffled be moon and star! For broken now is the lance, Shiver'd both shield and spear, And shatter'd the scimitar. And cleft is the golden crown, And the sun of Servia is down, O'erthrown, o'erthrown, o'erthrown, The roof and top of our renown, Dead is the great Lazar! “Have ye seen when the howling storm-wind takes The topmost pine on a hoary rock, Tugs at it, and tears, and shakes, and breaks, And tumbles it into the ocean? So when this bloody day began,— In the roaring battle's opening shock, Down went the grey-hair'd Youg Bogdan. And following him, the noblest man That ever wore the silver crown Of age, grown grey in old renown, One after one, and side by side Fighting, thy nine brothers died: Each by other, brother brother Following, till death took them all. But of these nine the last to fall Was Bocko. Him, myself, I saw, Three awful hours—a sight of awe, Here, and there, and everywhere, And all at once, made manifest, Like a wild meteor in a troubled air, Whose motion never may be guest. For over all the lurid rack Of smoking battle, blazed and burn'd, And stream'd and flasht, Like flame before the wind upturn'd, The great imperial ensign splasht With blood of Turks: where'er he dasht Amongst their bruised battalions, I Saw them before him reel and fly: As when a falcon from on high, Pounce on a settle-down of doves, That murmurs make in myrrhy groves, Comes flying all across the sky, And scatters them with instant fright; So flew the Turks to left and right, Broken before him. Milosch fell, Pursued by myriads down the dell, Upon Sitnitza's rushy brink, Whose chilly waves will roll, I think, So long as time itself doth roll, Red with remorse that they roll o'er him. Christ have mercy on his soul, And blessèd be the womb that bore him. Not alone he fell. Before him Twelve thousand Turkish soldiers fell, Slaughter'd in the savage dell. His right hand was wet and red With the blood that he had shed, And in that red right hand he had (Shorn from the shoulder sharp) the head Of the Turkish Tzar, Murad. “There resteth to Servia a glory, A glory that shall not grow old; There remaineth to Servia a story, A tale to be chanted and told! They are gone to their graves grim and gory, The beautiful, brave, and bold; But out of the darkness and desolation, Of the mourning heart of a widow'd nation, Their memory waketh an exultation! Yea, so long as a babe shall be born, Or there resteth a man in the land— So long as a blade of corn Shall be reapt by a human hand— So long as the grass shall grow On the mighty plain of Kossovo— So long, so long, even so, Shall the glory of those remain Who this day in battle were slain. “And as for what ye inquire Of Vouk,—when the worm and mole Are at work on his bones, may his soul Eternally singe in hell-fire! Curst be the womb that bore him! Curst be his father before him! Curst be the race and the name of him! And foul as his sin be the fame of him! For blacker traitor never drew sword— False to his faith, to his land, to his lord! And doubt ye, doubt ye, the tale I tell? Ask of the dead, for the dead know well; Let them answer ye, each from his mouldy bed, For there is no falsehood among the dead: And there be twelve thousand dead men know Who betray'd the Tzar at Kossovo.” I.THE STAG AND THE VILA. O'er the mountain, the wild stag browses the mountain herbage alone, At morn he browses, at noon he sickens, at eve he maketh moan. From the rifts of the rocky quarries the Vila The Vilas are supernatural beings that appear frequently in the poetry, and exist to this day in the popular superstition, of the Serbs. I have been unable to trace their origin, but they would seem to be a remnant of the early Slave mythology; and, being a mountain race, to have survived the fate of the lowland members of the fairy family, notwithstanding the presence of perhaps almost as many “holy freres” as those to whose “blessing of thorpes and dairies,” Chaucer, in his day, attributed the fact that “there bin no faëries.” They are a kind of fierce Oreads, dwelling among the mountains and forests, and sometimes about the margin of waste waters. Their attributes are varying, and not distinctly ascertainable, but they are mostly terrible, and hostile to man. They are not, however, incapable of sympathy with the human race; for they have been known (though generally after being vanquished by them) to love great heroes. Evidence of this is to be found in the recorded exploits of Marko Kralievitch. That hero was beloved by one of these beings, who, indeed, prophesied his death, and that of his horse, Charatz. This animal was aged above one hundred and fifty years at the period of his death, and, according to some authorities, was the gift of a Vila. The love of these beings, however, is generally treacherous, and often fatal. The Vilas are not immortal, nor invulnerable. The Vila Ravioëla, who wounded the voivode Milosch with a golden arrow, was nearly massacred by Marko. They preserve, however, through incalculable time, supernatural youth and beauty. They believe in God and Saint John, and abhor the Turks. When they appear to mortal eyes it is as“Unwedded maids, Shadowing more beauty in their airy brows Than have the white breasts of the Queen of Love,” with long hair floating over their shoulders, and clothed in snow-white vesture. They are wise in the use of herbs and simples, they know the properties of every flower and berry, and possess strange medical arts. hears him, and calls, “O beast of the mountain meadows, the woods, and the waterfalls, What sorrow is thine, so great that, browsing at morn, at noon thou ailest, And now to the stars thou art moaning? What is it that thou bewailest?” And the stag to the Vila makes answer, mournfully moaning low: “O queen of the mountain, my sister! I mourn for my lost white doe, My milk-white doe, my darling! from me, o'er the mountain track, She wander'd away to the fountain; she wander'd, she never came back. Either forlornly she wanders, mourning me, missing her way, Or the hunters have follow'd and found her, and she hath perisht their prey, Or else she forgets me, the faithless thing! and ever by valley and crag Strays wanton after a belling note, and follows another stag. If she be lost in the lonesome places, and hollows under the moon, I pray that God, of his goodness, will guide her back to me soon. If the hunters have slain my beloved one, wandering the woodland alone, I pray that God, of his justice, will send them a fate like my own; But if she follows another stag, caring no more to come back, I pray that God, in his vengeance, guide the hunter fleet on her track.” II.LOVE AND SLEEP. I walkt the high and hollow wood, from dawn to evendew, The wild-eyed wood stared on me, and unclaspt, and let me through, Where mountain pines, like great black birds, stood percht against the blue. Not a whisper heaved the woven woof of those warm trees: All the little leaves lay flat, unmoved of bird or breeze: Day was losing light all round, by indolent degrees. Underneath the brooding branches, all in holy shade, Unseen hands of mountain things a mossy couch had made; There asleep among pale flowers my beloved was laid. Slipping down, a sunbeam bathed her brows with bounteous gold, Unmoved upon her maiden breast her heavy hair was roll'd, Her smile was silent as the smile on corpses three hours old. “O God!” I thought, “if this be death, that makes not sound nor stir!” My heart stood still with tender awe, I dared not waken her, But to the dear God, in the sky, this prayer I did prefer: “Grant, dear Lord, in the blessèd sky, a warm wind from the sea, To shake a leaf down on my love from yonder leafy tree; That she may open her sweet eyes, and haply look on me.” The dear God, from the distant sea a little wind releast, It shook a leaflet from the tree, and laid it on her breast. Her sweet eyes ope'd, and looked on me. How can I tell the rest? III.TITTLE-TATTLE. Two lovers kist in the meadow green, They thought there was none to espy: But the meadow green told what it had seen To the white flock wandering by. The white flock told it the shepherd: The shepherd the traveller from far: The traveller told it the mariner, Watching the pilot star: The mariner told it his little bark: The little bark told it the sea: The sea told it the river, Flowing down by the lea: The river told it the maiden's mother, And so to the maid it came back: The maiden, as soon as she heard it, Curst them all for a tell-tale pack: “Meadow, be barren for ever, Grass, grow not henceforth from the mould of thee! Flock, be devour'd by the wolf! Shepherd, the Turk seize hold of thee! Traveller, rot of the fever! Mariner, drown in the gulf! Bark, may the whirlwind perplex thee, And break thee against the shore! Sea, may the moon ever vex thee! River, be dry evermore!” IV.MATRIMONIAL CONSIDERATIONS. Where mountains shut the silence up, a milk-white maiden stood: Her face was like a light, and kindled all the solitude. And while the wild white mountain flowers turned passionately pale, And while the chilly water ran reluctant to the vale, And the bald eagle, near the sun, stood still on some tall peak, That milk-white maiden to her own sweet face began to speak: “O face, sweet source of all my care, Fair face (because I know thee fair!) If I knew thou should'st be kist By any husband, wither'd, old, and grey, I would wander, mist-like, with the mist, The monstrous mountain many a league away, Until, in some abandon'd place, Where the starved wolf cracks the bones Of perisht men, and the wind groans For want of something to devour, I should find, wild in the wind, Among the blotcht and mildew'd stones, The harsh-blowing absinth flower; And pluck the stubborn root of it, That from the bitter fruit of it I might the blighting juice express; Therewith to bathe thee, O my face, my face! Till all thy beauty should be bitterness, And each unloved caress Burn on the old man's lip, which should embrace Death on thy rosy portals, O my face! “But if I knew, O my face, my face! That thy lips should be kist by whom I would list, I would glide, unespied, to a place, my face, Where red roses, I know, ripely ripple and blow, And white lilies grow more snowy than snow; And all in the balmy evening light, While the dew is new, and the stars but a few, The roses so red, and the lilies so white, I would pluck, with the sunset upon them, and press From those flowers their sweetest sweetnesses, To embalm thee, my face, till what he should embrace Should be fairer than lilies and richer than roses; So that when on thy lips my beloved one reposes, A thousand summers of fragrant sighs Might fan the faint fire of his soul's desire With raptures pure as the rivers that rise Among the valleys of Paradise.” V.LOVE CONFERS NOBILITY. He. Violet, Violet is a pet name, as well as a proper name. little one mine! I would love thee, but thou art so small. She. Love me, my love, from those heights of thine, And I shall grow tall, so tall! The pearl is small, but it hangs above A royal brow, and a kingly mind: The quail is little, little, my love, But she leaves the hunter behind. VI.A SOUL'S SWEETNESS. He. O maiden of my soul! What odour from the orange hast thou stole, That breathes about thy breast with such sweet power? What sweetness, unto me More sweet than amber honey to the bee That builds i' the oaken bole, And sucks the essential summer of the year To store with sweetest sweets her hollow tower? Or is it breath of basil, maiden dear? Or of the immortal flower? She. By the sweet heavens, young lover! No odour from the orange have I stole; Nor have I robb'd for thee, Dearest, the amber dower Of the building bee, From any hollow tower In oaken bole: But if, on this poor breast thou dost discover Fragrance of such sweet power, Trust me, O my belovèd and my lover, 'Tis not of basil, nor the immortal flower, But from a virgin soul. VII.REMINISCENCES. He. And art thou wed, my Belovèd? My Belovèd of long ago! She. I am wed, my Belovèd. And I have given A child to this world of woe. And the name I have given my child is thine, So that, when I call to me my little one, The heaviness of this heart of mine For a little while may be gone. For I say not . . . “Hither, hither, my son!” But . . . “Hither, my love, my Belovèd!” VIII.SLEEP AND DEATH. The morning is growing: the cocks are crowing: Let me away, love, away! 'Tis not the morning light; Only the moonbeam white. Stay, my white lamb, stay, And sleep on my bosom, sleep! The breeze is blowing: the cattle are lowing: Let me away, love, away! 'Tis not the cattle there; Only the call to prayer. Stay, my white lamb, stay, And sleep on my bosom, sleep! The Turks are warning to the mosk: 'tis morning! Let me away, love, away! 'Tis not the Turks, sweet soul! Only the wolves that howl. Stay, my white lamb, stay, And sleep on my bosom, sleep! The white roofs are gleaming: the glad children screaming: Let me away, love, away! 'Tis the night-clouds that gleam: The night winds that scream. Stay, my white lamb, stay, And sleep on my bosom, sleep! My mother in the gateway calls to me . . . “Come straightway!” And I must away, love, away! Thy mother's in her bed, Dumb, holy, and dead. Stay, my white lamb, stay, And sleep on my bosom, sleep! IX.A CONJUGAL DISPUTE. All at the mid of the night, there arose A quarrel 'twixt husband and wife; For, the young Omer Bey and his spouse, Falling into discussion and strife, Wild words to each other they said, Side by side, at the dead Of the night, on their marriage bed. Had it been about anything less The quarrel might have passt by; But it was not a trifle, you guess, That set words running so high. Yet the cause in dispute (to be brief) Was only a white handkerchief, Broider'd all over with gold, And scented with rose and with amber, So sweet the whole house could not hold That scent from the nuptial chamber. For (the whole truth herewith to disclose) This handkerchief border'd with gold, And scented with amber and rose, Had been given to the Bey (to enfold Her letters, which lay on his breast), By the mistress that he loved best. But his wife had a sensitive nose For the scent of amber and rose; And the fiend himself only knows Whether, but for a lie, ere the close Of that quarrel there had not been blows. “You know I've a sister, my treasure, The wife of our friend Zekir Bey; I love her, you know, beyond measure, And she, dear, on our bridal day, To me gave this white handkerchief, Border'd all over with gold, And scented with amber and rose; Which precious, for her sake, I hold, Though the scent of it, much to my grief, Has troubled our nuptial repose.” Smiling, her husband she heard, Feeling no faith in his word, For troubled his face was, she saw. Up she leapt by the light of the taper, Barefooted, and seized ink and paper; And wrote to her sister-in-law:— “Wife of our friend, Zekir Bey, Long live thy husband, nought ail him, May'st thou never have cause to bewail him! Speak truth, and fear nothing. But say (For truly the truth must be told) To thy brother, on our bridal day, Did'st thou give a white handkerchief, brightly Embroider'd all over with gold, And scented with rose and with amber So sweet, that the scent of it nightly May be smelt in the Bey's bridal chamber?” When this came to the wife of the Bey, She burst into tears, as she read: And “Pity upon me!” she said, “For I know not, alas! what to say. If I speak truth, I put strife 'Twixt the brother I love and his wife; If I speak false, much I dread Lest my husband die for it,” she said. Then the letter she laid in her breast, And she ponder'd with many a sigh, “I choose of two evils the least, If my husband must die, let him die! Since the choice lies 'twixt one or the other— Any husband a woman may spare, But the sister that injures a brother Does that which she cannot repair.” Thus shrewdly the matter she saw: And she wrote to her sister-in-law:— “Wife of my brother, the Bey! My husband is well. May naught ail him! And I trust I shall never bewail him. To my brother on your marriage day (And truly the truth shall be told) I gave a white handkerchief, brightly Embroider'd all over with gold, And scented with rose and with amber So sweet, that the scent (as you say, And as I cannot doubt of it) nightly May be smelt in the Bey's bridal chamber.” X.DEGREES OF AFFECTION. Up and down the Tchardak, A sort of gallery or verandah, running round a house. Also, sometimes, a pavilion, summer-house, or granary. underneath the blossom'd roof, Musing, young Iövo, Diminutive for Iovan or John. at midnoon, walkt all aloof. Suddenly the Tchardak broke beneath him: slipping through The rotten plank, he fell, and his right arm was snapt in two. Straight, a leech he sought him. Evil leech, in truth, he found. Save the mountain Vila, none had skill to heal the wound: But the Vila claim'd in price of service, ere the cure began, The right hand of the mother of the maim'd and mangled man; The long hair of his sister with the riband in the hair; And the white pearl necklace which his wife was wont to wear. The mother gave her right hand, and the sister gave her curls; But the wife refused her necklace . . . “I? I will not give my pearls! Each is perfect, each is precious, nowhere else is such a set. 'Twas my dowry from my father, and I mean to wear it yet.” This the Vila of the mountain heard; and, anger'd in her mood, She dropt a little purple drop of poison in the food Of young Iövo, and he died. Then, for the murder'd man, Those three women to lament, in funeral dole began. One there was that, deeply mourning, evermore did grieve: One that miss'd and mourn'd for him at morning and at eve: One that mourn'd him now and then, with eyes a little dim, And looks a little changed, whenever she remember'd him. She whose sorrow ceased not, mourning more than any other, Missing aye her murder'd son, was young Iövo's mother: She that mourn'd at morning, and at evening mourn'd and miss'd her Brother, when day came or went, was young Iövo's sister. She that mourn'd him now and then, when sometimes in her life Old memories fill'd vacant hours, was young Iövo's wife. XI.THE FAIR IKONIA. The fair Ikonia boasted at the bath, Gaily, amidst the matrons . . . “Tell me which Amongst you, matrons, such a husband hath As mine, Iövo Morniakovitch? Where he goeth, there I go: Where he resteth, there rest I: Is he silent? then I know That he names me silently: Does he speak? of me he speaketh: Does he dream? of me he dreameth: Does he wake? for me he waketh: Mine by night, when moonlight beameth! Mine at dawn, when daylight breaketh! First from dreams of me to wake, That his kiss may ope my eyes: ‘Dear, the dawn begins to break, Light of my life, arise! arise!’ Life is long, the journey through it Lone and weary, others tell. I shall never turn and miss him From my side, and this is well.” This the wily widow, Anna, Heard, and slyly slipt away: Then she clothed herself with splendour: And she stood, in rich array, Where, from the Bazar, Iövo Came home, singing all the way: Deckt her cheeks with painted roses, Darker dyed her midnight hair, Breathed the breath of perfumed posies, Laid her bounteous bosom bare, Stood like glory in the gateway, Murmur'd, mild as evening air, “Sad, Iövo, seems thy case, Wedded to a barren wife; If thou would'st not see thy race Pass and perish, with thy life, Wed with me, and I will bear thee Every year a noble heir, Every year a gracious infant, With strong hands and golden hair.” The epithet “golden” generally implies “strength” in the Serb poetry. The words are literally “with golden hands,” &amp;c. Long he listen'd: soft her voice was; Long he lookt: her dark eyes glisten'd. As the counsel, so the choice was. All too long he lookt and listen'd. Thus the wily widow, Anna, Won Iövo then and there: And each year a boy she bore him With strong hands and golden hair. Silent walk'd the fair Ikonia, Making neither moan nor word, Up the great Bazar walkt silent, And she bought herself a cord: In the garden square a golden Orange-tree grows all alone, There her silken cord she fasten'd, And she hang'd herself thereon. Came one running to Iövo, “On thy golden orange-tree, Fair Ikonia, dead, is hanging.” “Hanging? Let her hang!” quoth he, “I've a fairer far than she.” XII.A WISH. I would I were a rivulet, And I know where I would run! To Save, the chilly river, Where the market boats pass on; To see my dear one stand By the rudder; and whether the rose Which, at parting, I put in his hand, Warm with a kiss in it, blows; Whether it blows or withers: I pluckt it on Saturday; I gave it to him on Sunday; On Monday he went away. XIII.IMPERFECTION. All in the spring, When little birds sing, And flowers do talk From stalk to stalk; Whispering to a silver shower, A violet did boast to be Of every flower the fairest flower That blows by lawn or lea. But a rose that blew thereby Answer'd her reproachfully (All in the spring, When little birds sing, And flowers do talk From stalk to stalk): “Violet, I marvel me Of fairest flower by lawn or lea The fairest thou should'st boast to be; For one small defect I spy, Should make thee speak more modestly: Thy face is fashion'd tenderly, But then it hangs awry.” XIV.EMANCIPATION. The Day of Saint George! and a girl pray'd thus: “O Day of Saint George, when again to us Thou returnest, and they carouse Here in my mother's house, May'st thou find me either a corpse or a bride, Either buried or wed; Rather married than dead; But however that may betide, And whether a corpse or a spouse, No more in my mother's house.” XV.THE VOICE OF NATURE; OR, WHAT THE FISH SAID TO THE MAIDEN. By the sea a maiden is sitting, And she says to herself at her knitting: “O my heart! what more deep than the ocean, Or more wide than the plain can be? Or more swift than the horse in his motion? Or more sweet than the food of the bee? Or more dear than a brother?” And a fish from the sea replies: “O maiden, but a little wise! The plain is less wide than the sea, And the heaven more deep than this is; Eyes swifter than horses be; And honey less sweet than kisses; And a lover more dear than all other.” XVI.THE MALADY OF MOIO. Moïo, the Tzarovitch (bolder is no man!) Walkt to the Bath with the Turk lords one day: Mahmoud the Pacha's white wife (and what woman Is fairer than she is?) was walking away. Even as the sun, o'er the ardours of even, Looks on the moon, and the moon on the sun, Wistfully, each, disunited in heaven, Soon to be pacing far pathways alone, So through the mist of a moment of ecstacy, Thrilled with a rapture delicious and dim, Mute on the pale Pachinitza the Tzarovitch Gazed, and the pale Pachinitza on him. Moïo walkt silently back to his palace: Troubled his heart was, and changed was his mood. Straightway he sicken'd of love, and lay dying, Dying of love for the wife of Mahmoud. Ladies the loveliest all came to visit him: Only the wife of Mahmoud stay'd away. Then the Sultana rose up and wrote to her— “Wouldst thou be greater than all of us, say? Moïo is lying upon his couch dying; Sore is his sickness, and fatal they say: Ladies the loveliest all come to visit him, Thou, art thou more, Pachinitza, than they?” She, when she heard of it, loopt up her white sleeve, Loopt up her light robe as white as a star; Presents she bore for him, worthy a monarch's son, Figs from the sea-coast, and grapes from Mostar. Lightly she trod o'er the long golden gallery, Past all ungreeted the corridor dim, Pale, the dumb purple pavilion she enter'd, Where the Sultana was watching by him. Softly she sat by his bed-side, and softly Wiped from his forehead the fever, and said, “This is a malady known to me surely! Long did I watch, and long weep by the bed Once where my brother lay moaning and mad of it, Moaning and madden'd, unable to move; Poison they said it was. I, too, have drunk of it. This is the passionate poison of love.” Trembling he listen'd, as trembling she utter'd it. Lightly he leapt from the couch where he lay, Fasten'd, behind her, the long golden gallery, Laught as he sank on her soft lips, and they Three white days, little heeding the daylight, Three blue nights, little noting the moon, Seal'd by sweet kisses in silent caresses, Rested, while round them May melted to June. Gaily the nightingale sang in the garden. Love the bird sang of, and sweet was the tune. Three white days, little loving the daylight, Three blue nights, ill at rest 'neath the moon, Mahmoud the Pacha walkt, mourning his miss'd one, “Come, Pachinitza, come back to me soon!” Sadly the nightingale sang in his garden. Love the bird sang of, but harsh was the tune. Then, when the fourth day was low in the orient, Mahmoud the Pacha sat down in his hall; There a white letter he wrote to the Sultan: “Sultan Imperial, dear master of all! There's a white dove, with a gold treasure casket, Flown to thy doors from thy servant's abode. Send back my white dove, restore me my treasure, If thou hast fear of the justice of God.” But to the Pacha the Sultan sent answer: “Mahmoud, my servant, behoves thee to know There's in my palace a falcon unhooded, And what he hath taken he never lets go.” XVII.A SERVIAN BEAUTY. 'Tis the Kolo Kolo, signifying literally a wheel, is the generic term for all the Servian national dances; in most of which the dancers, either taking hands, or united each to each by a handkerchief tied round the waist or to the girdle, form a ring and advance or retreat to and from the centre to a monotonous music, either of the voice or some very simple wind instruments. Both sexes take part in these dances, which are frequently in the open air. that dances before the white house, And 'tis Stoian's fair sister, O fair, fair is she! Too fair she is truly, too fair heaven knows, (God forgive her!) so cruel to be. The fair Vila, whom the wan clouds fondly follow O'er the mountain wherever she roam it, Is not fairer nor whiter than she. Her long soft eyelash is the wing of the swallow When the dew of the dawn trembles from it, And as dawn-stars her blue eyes to me; Her eyebrows so dark are the slender sea-leeches; A strange, but very frequent, simile in Servian poetry. Her rich-bloomèd cheeks are the ripe river peaches, Her teeth are white pearls from the sea; Her lips are two half-open'd roses; And her breath the south wind, which discloses The sweetness that soothes the wild bee. She is tall as the larch, she is slender As any green bough the birds move; See her dance—'tis the peacock's full splendour! Hear her talk—'tis the coo of the dove! And, only but let her look tender— 'Tis all heaven melting down from above! XVIII.A DISCREET YOUNG WOMAN. Militza has long soft eyelashes, So darkly-dreaming droopt on either cheek, You scarce can guess what little lightning flashes From those deep eyes, beneath them beaming, break. And her fair face, like a flower, Has such drooping ways about it, I have watcht her, many an hour, Three full years (O never doubt it!), And yet never have seen fairly Eyes or face,—reveal'd so rarely! Only just to rob one glance From the happy grass beneath her On the green where maidens dance When the month makes merry weather, I the Kolo call'd together, Trusting to my happy chance. While the dance grew sweeter, faster (Bosoms heaving, tresses shaken), Suddenly with dim disaster All the sky was overtaken. Rolling darkness drown'd the sunlight, Rolling thunder drencht the valleys, And in heaven was left but one light From the lightning's livid sallies. Like a necklace lightly shatter'd, Shedding rubies, shedding pearls, Here and there the Kolo scatter'd All its bevy of bright girls. Little, darling, timid creatures! Each, with frighten'd flutter'd features, Lifted up her pretty eyes To the tempest growling o'er her; But Militza, very wise, Still kept looking straight before her. Little voices, silvery, wild, All at once, in fretful cadence, Brake out chiding the sweet child. “What, Militza!” cried the maidens, “Those grass-grazing eyes, I wonder, From the ground can nothing startle? Hark, child! how it groans, the thunder! See! the lightnings, how they dartle Here and there by angry fits, In and out the stormy weather! Hast thou wholly lost thy wits, Little fool? Or must we deem Thou wouldst something wiser seem Than the whole world put together?” But Militza answers . . . “Neither Have I lost my wits, nor grown Wiser, maidens, I must own, Than the whole world put together. I am not the Vila white, Who, amidst her mountain ranges, Lifting looks of stormy light, Through his fifty moody changes, Woos the tempest's troubled sprite Down the mountain melting o'er her— I am not a Vila white, But a girl that looks before her.” XIX.BOLOZÀNOVITCH THE KNAVE. Djoul, For Gul, the Turk word, meaning rose. the Turk, on a morning in May, When every bird is brilliant in feather, And every flower in blossom is gay, To celebrate sweetly the merry May weather, From dawn to dusk, in dance and play, Call'd a hundred matrons and maids together. And the fairest maiden of all, that day, Was the maid Bolozànovitch loved, they say. He sought her all a summer noon, And on to eventide; He sought her under the summer moon, Through all the country wide, Till at nightfall he came, in the mist and murk, To the lighted house of Djoul, the Turk. “Djoul, Djoul with the raven hair! Give me a shift of linen fair, Such as thyself art wont to wear On the day when the glad new moon is born; Paint me the eyebrow with antimony; These bronzèd cheeks with white and red Colour; and comb me, and curl me the head; Hang me over the shoulders free Silken tresses two or three, Such as by matron or maid are worn; Bind me the brow with a golden braid, And clothe me, anon, in the clothes of a maid From head to foot, with many a fold Of the milk-white tunic flowing and full; And give me a distaff of gold And a ball of Egyptian wool; Then suffer me thus 'mid the maidens to move, That I may speak to the maiden I love.” Djoul, the Turk with the raven hair, Laught as she listen'd, and granted his prayer. She clothed him in clothes of a maid, Comb'd him and curl'd him the hair, Painted his dark face fair, Over his long limbs laid Many a milk-white fold Of vesture flowing and full; Then gave him a distaff of gold, And a ball of Egyptian wool; And when he was trickt, and pincht, and padded, And painted, and plaster'd, to look like a lass, Because he yet lookt like the knave that he was, This good counsel she added: “Bolozànovitch, knave, take note! When anon, 'mid our women ye stand, The old women take by the hand, And kiss on their finger tips; The young women kiss on the lips; But for those that are maidens and girls, You shall kiss them under the throat, And over the collar of pearls.” Bolozànovitch gladly (the knave!) Gave heed to the counsel she gave, And of all, as she bade him, took note. The old women each on the finger tips He kist, and the young women each on the lips, And the maidens under the throat. Maidenlike thus 'mid the maidens he moved, Drooping the eyelid over the ground; But when he came to the maiden he loved, He made her a little red wound Just in the soft white fold Of her slender throat. Then she Cried out to the women around, “Strike! strike with your distaffs of gold, The knave who has wounded me! For this was not a woman. Behold, 'Tis the knave Bolozànovitch, he! XX.THE WIFE OF HASSAN AGA. This poem was translated by Goethe into German, in 1789, from an Italian translation published by the Abbé Fortis in 1774; and was thus first of these national songs and legends that ever passed from Servia into more civilized lands. Goethe's translation (Klaggesang von der edeln Fraun des Asan Aga) is unrhymed. What is it so white on the mountain green? A flight of swans? or a fall of snow? The swans would have flown, and the snow would have been Melted away long ago. It is neither snow-fall, nor yet swan-flight, But the tent of Hassan Aga so white. Sore was the wound which in battle he got, His mother and sister (for these without blame Might do as they listed) to visit him came; But his wife, for the modest-minded shame Of a matron chaste, could not. Wherefore, when he had heal'd him his wound so sore, Anger'd he said to his faithful spouse: “Meet me no more, see me no more, 'Mid our children, within my white house.” He frown'd and he rode away. Silent with deep dismay. The Turkish woman wept, Bitterly wept at her husband's word, Clothed herself with sorrow, and crept Into her chamber, and cover'd her brows, When the hoof of a horse was heard At the door of the Aga's house. The fair Aguinitza The wife of an Aga; as Pachinitza, wife of a Pacha. fled trembling away To the window, to fling herself down in her fear: Her two little daughters came running, and they Cried, “Mother, come back, mother dear! For it is not our father Hassan is here, But our uncle Pintorovitch Bey.” Back she turn'd, faltering she came, Weeping she fell on the breast of her brother, And . . . “O my brother,” . . . she cried . . . “the shame, From her children to sever a mother!” The Bey held silence, nor answer'd a word, His smile was stern but his eyes were dim, As he drew from his silken pouch, and laid In the hands of his sister, the letter which said That her dower to her should, in full, be restored, And she should return to their mother with him. The writing of divorce. When the fair Turk that letter had read, Her children she call'd to her one by one, She kist her two boys on the brow and cheek: She kist her two girls on their lips' young red But when to the little one, lying alone In the little cradle, she came, The little one smiled as he slept: Her heart began to break With an inward anguish of shame: She could neither move nor speak: She sat down by the cradle and wept. Then her brother Pintorovitch Bey Drew softly the cradle away, Lifted her into the saddle behind, Turn'd, as he mounted, and kist her, And rode off to his house with his sister, Over the hills, in the wind. Not long in the house of her mother She rested; not even a week. Lovers, one after the other, Came riding to sue and to seek: For never more lovely a lady Breath'd beauty to trouble the land, And soon from Imoski the Kadi Came gaily to ask for her hand. “O spare me, O save me, my brother! My poor heart in sunder is reft: My poor eyes are full of old tears: Let me not be the bride of another, For the sake of my little ones left, For the sake of the once happy years!” But of all this full lightly he thought, And he gave to the Kadi her hand: Then sadly the Bey she besought, And moaning she made her demand— On a fair paper, pure white, These words to Imaski to write: “Fair greeting, in fair courtesy, From her that hath been given to thee, And courtesy to her prayer! When the noble Svals The Servian ceremonial of marriage is very peculiar. On the wedding day the bridegroom proceeds to the house of the bride, accompanied by the guests, of both sexes, who attend the marriage on his invitation; and who in this capacity (of guests or witnesses) are called Svats. He is supported by a Koum, or Best-man, a Stari Svat, or chief guest (the oldest and most honoured of the company), who attest the marriage, and a Dever (paranymph or groomsman), which latter personage may be a married man. These receive the bride from the hands of her parents, and are bound not to lose sight of her till she enters her new home. All participation in the nuptial ceremonial is interdicted by custom to the parents of the bride, who do not again behold their daughter until eight days after the marriage. A mother, indeed, cannot, compatibly with established usage, attend or be near her daughter in child-bed. By being groomsman or witness to a marriage, a relationship is contracted with the bride's family of a nature so close and so strict as to be deemed incompatible with marriage at any future period between the groomsman and any member of that family. assembled be, And ye come in a noble company From her white house to carry thy bride, Bring ye a long white covering fair To cover her eyes; that so, when ye ride Beside the white house of the Aga, she May see not the little ones there.” When this letter was come to the Kadi's hand, He assembled the noblest Svats of the land; And they all in a noble company rode To carry the bride from her white abode. Gaily to seek her they started, And with her they gaily departed. But, when they were merrily riding before The Aga's white house, from the window at once Lookt her two little daughters; her two little sons Came running to her from the door, And . . . “Come back, mother dear, with us, come! For dinner is waiting at home.” Then, weeping, the twice-wedded spouse To the bold Stari Svat, . . . “Dear, my brother in God, For the dear love of God, pass not by this abode! Let the horse wait here by the house; That I, ere I see them no more, (My dear ones, my little ones, see them no more!) May speak, though it be but a while.” And the horses stopt straightway, and stood by the door, And she past through the door with a smile. Gay gifts to her children she gave: To both of her boys bold and brave Golden jatagans rich, and to both Of her girls a long tunic of cloth. But when to the little one, lying alone In the cradle, she came, she laid mournfully on The small cradle a white orphan garment, A little white garment, and sigh'd, And turn'd from the cradle wild-eyed, With looks of despairing endearment. All of this Hassan Aga espied, And he turn'd to his two sons, and cried, “Little orphans, come here! come to me! For pitiless, children, is she, Your mother stone-hearted, the bride!” Cruel, cruel and keen was the word! Silent she listen'd and heard, Heard the harsh words that he said. To the black earth she bow'd her bright head: She had not another reply, Than to droop her white forehead, and die: For the heart of the mother was broken in twain For the love, and the loss, of her little ones ta'en. XXI.SLEEPLESSNESS. Sleep will not take the place of Love, Nor keep the place from Sorrow. Oh, when the long nights slowly move To meet a lonely morrow, The burthen of the broken days, The grief that on the bosom weighs, And all the heart oppresses, But lightly lies on restless eyes Love seals no more with kisses. XXII.NEGLECTED FLOWERS. Little violet, drooping all alone, like my own Drooping heart, I would pluck thee; but there's none, no, not one! To whom I dare to give thee: so I leave thee, and pass on. I would give thee gladly, gladly, if I dared, to Ali Bey; But too proud (ah well-a-day!) is Ali Bey—so they say! Proud he is! I do not dare. Would he care, he, to wear Any flower that buds or blows? . . . save the rose, I suppose! No! rest there, and despair! Live or die! Thou and I Have no chance to catch one glance from his eye, passing by. XXIII.PLUCKING A FLOWER. He. O maiden, vermeil rose! Unplanted, unsown, Blooming alone As the wild-flower blows, With a will of thine own! Neither grafted nor grown, Neither gather'd nor blown, O maiden, O rose! Blooming alone In the green garden-close, Unnoticed, unknown, Unpropt, unsupported, Unwater'd, unfed, Unkist, and uncourted, Unwoo'd, and unwed, O sweet wild rose, Who knows? Who knows? Might I kiss thee, and court thee? My kiss would not hurt thee! O sweet, sweet rose, In the green garden-close, If a gate were undone, And if I might come to thee, And meet thee alone? Sue thee, and woo thee, And make thee my own? Clasp thee, and cull thee,—what harm would be done? She. Beside thy field my garden blows. Were a gate in the garden left open . . . who knows? And I water'd my garden at eventide? (Who knows?) And if somebody silently happen'd to ride That way? And a horse to the gate should be tied? And if somebody (who knows who?), unespied, Were to enter my garden to gather a rose? Who knows? . . . I suppose No harm need be done. My belovèd one, Come lightly, come softly, at set of the sun! Come, and caress me! Kiss me, and press me! Fold me, and hold me! Kiss me with kisses that leave not a trace, But set not the print of thy teeth on my face, Or my mother will see it, and scold me. XXIV.TRANSPLANTING A FLOWER. O maiden, mother's golden treasure! Purest gold of perfect pleasure! Do they beat thee, and ill-treat thee, That I meet thee all alone? Do they beat thee, that I meet thee All too often, all too late, After nightfall, at the gate Of the garden, all alone? Tell me, tell me, little one, Do they do it? If I knew it, They should rue it! I would come Oftener, later, yet again, (Hail, or snow, or wind, or rain!) Oftener, later! Nor in vain: For if mother, for my sake, Were to drive thee out of home, Just three little steps 'twould take (Think upon it, little one!)— Just three little steps, or four, To my door from mother's door. Love is wise. I say no more. Ponder on it, little one! XXV.A MESSAGE. Sweet sister of my loved, unloving one, Kiss thy wild brother, kiss him tenderly! Ask him what is it, witless, I have done That he should look so coldly upon me? Ah, well . . . I know he recks not! Let it be. Yet say . . . “There's many a woodland nodding yet For who needs wood when winter nights be cold.” Say . . . “Love to give finds ever love to get. There lack not goldsmiths where there lacks not gold. The wood will claim the woodman by-and-by; The gold (be sure!) the goldsmith cannot miss; Each maid to win finds lads to woo: and I . . .” Well, child, but only tell him, tell him this! Sweet sister, tell him this! XXVI.ISOLATION. The night is very dark and very lonely: And as dark, and all as lonely, is my heart: And the sorrow that is in it night knows only: For the dawn breaks, and my heart breaks. Far apart From my old self seems my new self. And my mother And my sister are in heaven,—so they say: And the dear one dearer yet than any other Is far, far away. The sweet hour of his coming . . . night is falling! The hour of our awakening . . . bird on bough! The hour of last embraces . . . friends are calling “Love, farewell!” . . . and every hour is silent now. XXVII.A REGRET. Lost empire of my maidenhood! Could I be once more what I would, Then what I am I would not be. Ah well-a-day, and woe is me! Could I a maiden be once more, And unknow all that I have known, And feel as I have felt of yore, I would not change with any queen; Not for sceptre, crown, or throne, If I could be what I have been Would I grow what I have grown. Lost empire of my maidenhood! Sweetest sweet! and chiefest good! Now that thou art gone, I know, Could I call thee back again! How to keep thee. Even so! Loss is all my gain! Would that I were with the flocks As of old among the rocks! For the flocks do blithely bleat, And the mountain airs blow sweet, And the river runneth fleet, Running to the happy sea: But the glory of the river, And the gladness of the flocks, And the mirth among the rocks, And the music on the wind Ministrant to a merry mind, These are joyous things, for ever Dead, or fled, for me! On the wind there moans for ever One word only, which the river, Murmuring, murmurs to the shore, And the flocks, with chilly bleat, Evermore that word repeat, And that word is—Nevermore! Nevermore, O never, never Any more, by mount or river, Shall I be as I have been, A mountain maid, a virgin queen! XXVIII.THE BAN OF VARADIN. A wassailer in wildest ways, But foul befall the churl who says That what he drinks he never pays, So mad a devil dwells within The brain of Peter Doïtchin, The burly Ban of Varadin! Servian name for Petervardein, fortress in Hungary. Three hundred ducats in a day, Good sooth, he swill'd them all away! And, when he had no more to pay, First his massy mace of gold, Then this coal-black horse he sold. “Fill up the can, keep out the cold, And let the merry devil in, Sweetheart!” laught Peter Doïtchin, The burly Ban of Varadin! Quoth King Mathias Probably Mathias Corvinus. . . . “Burly Ban, God curse thee for a brainless man, Whose goods flow from him in the can! Three hundred ducats in a day, Thou hast swill'd them all away, And, for lack of more to pay, Thou thy massy mace of gold, And thy coal-black war-steed bold, For a sorry stoup hast sold.” “King Mathias, cease thy prattle! Brainless heads are hard in battle: Fighting men make thirsty cattle. Had'st thou the tavern drain'd with me, The tavern wench upon thy knee, (So sweet and sound a wench is she!) Thou would'st have drunk up thy good town Of Pesth, with Buda tower and down, Camp, acropolis, court, and crown!” XXIX.FATIMA AND MEHMED. Beneath a milk-white almond tree, Fatima and Mehmed be. The black earth is their bridal bed; The thick-starrèd sky clear-spread Is their coverlet all the night, As they lie in each other's arms so white. The grass is full of honey-dew; The crescent moon, that glimmers through The unrippled leaves, is faint and new: And the milk-white almond blossoms All night long fall on their bosoms.
