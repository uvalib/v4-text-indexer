      <field name="fulltext">Parliamentary Letters. FROM AN ELECTIONEERING CANDIDATE TO A FRIEND IN LONDON. My dear cousin Edward, I know you will stare, When you hear that my uncle has made me his heir! In his will he has left me his mansion and goods, His household appendages, acres, and woods; And I mean, as I'm greatly enrich'd by his bounty, To sit down in splendour, and stand for the county. Yes, Ned, you may wonder, and start an objection, Attempting to end my political plan; Yet at the ensuing contested election, I've hopes of becoming a Parliament Man. And why should I not? I've a landed estate, Which gives me a title to rank with the great; And having a family seat, you'll allow That a seat in the House will be due to me now: I shall not be the first who contrived to obtain Popularity—bought with the lucre of gain; They say I'm not clever—but he that is worse May carry his point, if he carry a purse! Though whilst all are eager to glean from his store, Those who vote in his favour may vote him a bore. The great dissolution-of-parliament day Will soon clear the seats of both Houses they say, Our Members would doubtless remain there for ever, If left 'till they all had exhausted their breath: But that's not the case, for a Parliament never Is suffer'd to die of a natural death: When like to be ousted, and laid on the shelf 'Twill always lay violent hands on itself; As a sensible dog, who knows what he's about, Sneaks off—at a rumour of turning him out. Then many a Member will prove he is willing, For England's advantage, to spend his last shilling; Regardless of self, he'll throw thousands about him, Assured that the Senate could not do without him. The man who is Member at present, I hear, Intends, if he can, to oppose my career; But as I am the richest, his friends will soon see Some weighty inducements for fixing on me; And they'll say, when his fortune no longer contents them, Their old representative misrepresents them. For boroughs, like flirts, have but little objection To changing their suitors as politics veer; And he may be hooted, and lose his election, Whose fortune was wasted to gain it last year: Constituents know, when a candidate offers, 'Tis prudent to make the best bargain they can; And having well weighed the contents of his coffers, They vote for the money much more than the man. I fear I have lived in the country so long, That at first setting out I shall do something wrong; For of news I know nothing, except what I've met, Once a week at our club, in the County Gazette; As I then never meddled in matters of state, I seldom had leisure to read the debate, But just glanced it over in haste; looking after The “hears,” and the “cheers,” and the “very loud laughter; Though I often was puzzled at last, to find out What the Parliament Men had been laughing about. As I know not exactly what course to pursue, Dear Ned, I shall place my reliance on you; And beg you will send, when you've leisure to pen it, A new Vade-Mecum for men in the Senate. Be clear and concise; and explicitly note Which side I shall find it most proper to vote; What men in the state now possess most authority, And also what sentiments please the majority; Direct me in all things, and say if my glory Will most be enhanced as a Whig, or a Tory: And when that is settled, I beg you will show The distinguishing marks which each party possesses; Whether Tory or Whig, a man may as well know An item or two of the creed he professes. When my canvass begins I suppose they'll expect me To state my opinions before they elect me. Then haste (for there is not a day to be lost) And send my political thoughts by the post; Be speedy, I beg, for I'm longing to see My letters and papers directed M.P. Letter IN ANSWER TO THE FORMER. Hail! child of promise! thou whose soul aspires To shame all antecedent country squires, Who, every inch a senator, wouldst sit Famed for your learning, eloquence, and wit; Resolved in England's history to claim An ample page devoted to your name. In my mind's eye already I perceive Our savour'd county's representative; And view him raised to his exalted station, A first-rate Member of the legislation. You ask advice; a thing which, I believe, Is always found more hard to take than give; All men will ask it of their friends like you, But most men pre-determine what to do; And if their friend opposes them, they still Pursue their plan, and think he judges ill: —As mine, however, is the easy task, I nib my pen to give you what you ask. If you would have me show the best of ways To move with men's applause in modern days, If you would know how praises are obtain'd, And learn how popularity is gain'd; The wondrous secret is not hard to tell, One little word—reform—contains the spell. Reform should be your watchword; day and night This ultimatum should be kept in sight; Declare that ministers in church and state, And princes too, should be regenerate; Reform their habits first; when that is done, On leisure days you may reform your own. Take public characters of every sort, (Preferring those, of course, who go to court); Let all their actions be severely tried, Discover, if you can, their weaker side; Find out a flaw, and, in your next oration, Compassionately plan their reformation; And in your comments, carefully make use Of inuendos, scandal, and abuse. Though fear or delicacy form a fence To guard our equals from malevolence, These (or at least the latter) cannot be A check to those who slander Royalty; No qualm of conscience ever intervenes To bid us spare our princes, dukes, or queens: Those who rule over us we freely scan, And of their actions think the worst we can. All men who sit in Parliament possess Some independent notions, more or less; But independence, Doctor Johnson says, May be defined distinctly in two ways; His page first calls it “freedom,” but the whole Proclaims it “an exemption from control:” Freedom is England's pride; yet, spite of this, Some think control at times is not amiss: And small constraints we wisely should endure, To make our country's freedom more secure: Men of reputed worth have argued thus, But old opinions are despised by us; Our fathers err'd, poor men, and knowledge runs In streams far more resplendent to their sons. We see how admirably men succeed In misinterpreting the books they read; I mean, we view them (slighting all the rest) Fix on the inference which suits them best; Our Independent Members thus agree In being constant friends of liberty; Which (as their actions show us) they define Freedom from laws both human and Divine. In days of yore a man might freely own (Without much blame) attachment to the crown; To British hearts, the isle that gave them birth Appeared the dearest, brightest spot on earth; Loyalty was not thought a stigma then; And England was the pride of Englishmen; Her sons, while foreign nations own'd her fame, Were not the first to vilify her name: But love of country, and such things, of late Have properly been voted out of date. It has been said (and said by men of sense, Which makes their errors of more consequence) That every station, whether high or low, Has its peculiar share of joy and woe; That all gradations wisely were design'd To aid the common welfare of mankind, And that these boundaries of rank secure The mutual benefit of rich and poor. Weak-sighted men! we boast a nobler plan, And boldly vindicate the rights of man. The day may yet arrive, when we shall see Mankind enjoy a blest equality; When all shall safely trample on the crown, And empty coronets be melted down; When mighty justice shall no more look big, And law shall lose his terrors and his wig; When all alike shall share the common store, And paupers' claims be misnamed stealth no more; When industry shall be a name unknown, And men shall rise by strength of limbs alone; When rich and poor the feather'd tribe may eat, And game certificates be obsolete; When church and state shall lose their load of evil, And all created beings find their level; When learned pedants shall no longer dare Maintain established creeds and forms of prayer; But those may preach who feel they have a call, And grace give ordinations to us all. O blessed consummation! days of peace! Commitments, bailiffs, debts, and duns, shall cease; And “Universal Suffrage” shall bespeak A bran new parliament just once a week; Mankind shall walk about without offence In unsophisticated innocence; Statutes at large shall rot upon their shelves, And none shall hang,—but those who hang themselves. When we direct the helm, I meditate A mighty revolution in the state; Our wives and daughters we'll no more condemn Eternally to pucker, darn, and hem; But raised from household culinary cares, Females shall interfere in state affairs: Then shall they stand (nor heed a husband's frowns) Fair representatives of borough-towns; Then those rare talents, which are now confined To the dull task of stitching for mankind; Those bright imaginations, which have toil'd In the alternatives of roast and boil'd, Shall shine in public life, and overawe Surrounding states with politics and law. Petticoat government! through future ages This brilliant theme shall grace historic pages; Our country's annals shall hereafter state How ladies shone in council or debate; Our maiden aunts shall breathe emphatic words, And shake the House of Commons or of Lords; And blooming belles shall benefit the nation, By writing pamphlets on administration. Woman! too long, by tyrant custom tied, Has thy tongue's eloquence been misapplied; Those who have voices to such vast extent Should surely have a voice in Parliament: Too long, alas! thy radiant sun has set Behind the flimsy veil of etiquette; Too long propriety, with frown severe, Withheld thy talents from their proper sphere; And lordly man's authoritative tone Too long has claim'd the senate as his own; Thy genius doom'd to slumber, or possess No aim but folly, flattery, and dress. But now be bold! reform shall aid our plan; Step forth, and snatch the laurel wreath from man; With gift of speech all potentates perplex, And scorn the title of the softer sex! Methinks e'en now I see St. Stephen's shine With senators profound and feminine; Their cheeks all blushing with the warmth they feel, Their eyes all bright with patriotic zeal! Then shall those nymphs who now peruse at most La Belle Assemblée, or the Morning Post, Sagely explore, with comprehensive glance, The maze of treaties, taxes, and finance; Then academic honours shall prepare A female speaker for the Speaker's chair; And pretty lips shall eloquently speak In learned Latin, and more learned Greek; Saying—what scarce can be explain'd when said, And writing franks that scarcely can be read. The privilege of franking, I believe You think a Member's best prerogative; E'en now with visionary bliss you see Epistles of three sheets, yet postage free! And from your country friends you claim a host Of tender benedictions sent per post: 'Tis true the prospect smiles; but earthly joy, Moralists say, is mingled with alloy; And 'midst your honours, troubles will unite To make you feel that moralists are right. When you are just elected, and can claim M. P. to dignify your noble name; Eer your unpractised fingers can command A Member's unintelligible hand; Notes will arrive with compliments and thanks, Unconscionably claiming scores of franks; 'Till to your neighbours you become almost A regular appendage to the post. It now shall be my aim to represent The most prevailing pleas of discontent; To store your mind with murmurs, and to teach How much those murmurs ornament a speech: In war you should exclaim, “'Twere better far “To live all slaves, than bear the ills of war; “Taxes and burdens of all kinds increase; “On any terms 'twere better to have peace.” Condemn the gift of pensions, and applause, For loss of limbs, in so absurd a cause; Declare defeat is certain;—or pretend Defeat would be an eligible end; Let laurels flourish round a foreign brow, We demand peace,—obtain'd—no matter how. It also is your duty to bestow, In artful language, praises on our foe; He fights our country; but a liberal mind Discovers countrymen in all mankind; Should England fall, and bear another name, —England or France;—to us 'twere all the same. If war, and its anticipated ill, Bring peace and glory, you may murmur still; If public men give dinners,—take offence At your low means, and their magnificence; Forget the services they did the state, And grumble at their services of plate: In all rejoicings, search out a pretence For blaming fetes, and folly, and expense; Look coldly on, and show that you despise Such childish sport, such vulgar prejudice. I know, dear Ben, it is your cruel fate To be by birth descended from the great; But 'tis your interest to feel,—or feign, For birth an insurmountable disdain; Despise all honorary claims, and sport With ribbons, titles, stars of every sort; With great humility your rank disclaim, And view your noble pedigree with shame; Your ancestors were British Peers; what then? We need no more Right Honourable men; And whilst you shade the honours they have won, Be famed as their dishonourable son. Go tell the mob—(but hold, I'm not discreet, Mob is a slavish word, grown obsolete:) Go tell the multitude, you offer cures For all their griefs,—and that those griefs are yours; And if they boast no grievances, point out Some new distress they ought to grieve about: Use high-flown words and beautiful bombast; Say ills disgrace times present and times past; Proclaim to all, your projects are pursued For patriotic ends and public good; Let every sentence harrow up the soul, With Want, Oppression, Famine, and Controul; Let tales of woe unmerited be heard, And rank rebellion lurk in every word; Talk loud and long, and only just withdraw In time to shun the vigilance of law; And in each prudent pause it will appear That more is understood than meets the ear: Spare none in place,—or, if one man is spared, Show you would talk high treason,—if you dared. Lead those you seem to serve: the multitude Are led with ease to evil or to good; Whate'er may be their present idol's aim, Worthy or worthless, theirs will be the same: And those who, with enthusiastic zeal, Now talk of loyalty they seem to feel; To-morrow, led astray, with hearts as warm, Will pelt nobility, and cry reform. Let their worst passions labour for your use, For all their errors find some fit excuse; And whilst they serve your purpose, and maintain The daring schemes of your seditious brain; Whilst by their crimes you boldly hope to rise To that high state you outwardly despise; Whilst they believe you seek their good alone —More worldly wise, you struggle for your own. These are my counsels: now, my friend, go forth, And let my pupil's actions prove their worth; Let your consistency be firm and strong; Oppose all measures, whether right or wrong: Say ministers, and all who aid them too, Have nothing but emolument in view; Would vote for Beelzebub,—be bought or sold; Would rather steal “than eat their mutton cold.” If you should doubt my judgment, look around— Some perfect specimens may soon be found, Who act as you must do, and boldly storm About their injuries, and seek reform; Who speak of liberty, and prove that each At least possesses liberty of speech. Behold some pert apprentice stoutly stand, A home-made champion of his native land; This self-elected judge his plan produces For cleansing Parliament of all abuses; Spurning the shop, for counters grown too great, His rising talents rise against the state; In reformation's cause so firmly staunch, He'd fell the constitution, root and branch; And reproduce the senate and the throne, Raised on new plans and fancies of his own. He thus, by means not rightly understood, Disturbs his country—for his country's good; And oft applies, its safety to secure, Desperate remedies, that kill or cure: Inflamed with party politics, he aims To swell the list of patriotic names; And feels that if posterity be just, Ages to come will venerate his bust: His vehement career no fears can check; In freedom's cause who would not risk his neck? In freedom's name his standard is unfurl'd, Which sows the seeds of discord in the world; Whilst others' lives are risk'd in the pursuit, He fondly hopes to reap the golden fruit. Possess'd of nought, this patriotic man At worst can only end as he began: He cannot lose; and since his thoughts disdain Justice and law,—he possibly may gain. There have been men (by folly misnamed great) Who sought reform by means more moderate; Who loved the soil, and, though they were aware Some weeds had mingled with the blossoms there, With caution would have moved them, for they knew A careless hand might kill the blossoms too: They fear'd to check the errors in their growth, Lest rashness should annihilate them both. These said that if our cause had been the best, Which revolution ever yet possest; If all our enmities were justly aim'd, And all out plots by sense and reason framed; The methods used, and those who use them too, Would surely crush the end we have in view. Others, far more misguided than the rest, Think that the present system is the best: “Is that corrupt,” they say, “which stood alone “Whilst other Governments were overthrown? “Which smiled amidst the storm, and still possest “Safety at home, and shelter for the rest; “Can that be weak, or liable to fall, “Which felt the woes of war, and braved them all? “Why should we seek by visionary ways “To find security for future days? “Why are these untried theories pursued, “Whilst this has proved so practically good?” Some timid fools, perhaps, who fear the laws, Adoring what they call “the good old cause,” Will spurn our principles, and madly cling— (Oh! matchless ignorance!) to church and king! “If none must labour, how”—it will be said,— “Can the large loaves they promise us be made? “If none must judge or govern, and the strong “Encompass all, who'll guard the weak from wrong?” We look with scorn on those who argue thus, And they, poor creatures, look with scorn on us; Such weak objections cannot hurt our scheme, We'll have a government that works by steam: Before our systems, Whigs and Tories fall; Both we despise, and are despised by all. Letter FROM THE CANDIDATE TO HIS FRIEND IN LONDON. My Mentor! my oracle! trust me, I feel Much obliged by your friendly affection and zeal; More just admonitions were never yet heard, There's sense and discretion in every word; I'll keep your injunctions for ever in view, And you'll find in due time they will benefit you: Yes, you, my dear Edward; for when I appear At the loftiest height of my brilliant career; When biographers trace my political course, Describe my perfections, and search for their source; At the end of my memoirs in quarto—your name Some flattering note may undoubtedly claim; And the lasting reward of your kindness shall be A slight immortality, borrowed from me. I'm sure of success, my procession's prepared, And Monday, or Tuesday, I hope to be chair'd; And three times a day at a mirror I stand In an attitude holding my hat in my hand; To tutor my face for the multitude, blending The dignified frown with the smile condescending: I've twenty extempore speeches in store, Which have been in rehearsal a fortnight or more. The women adore you, and call you defender, And friend to the rights of the feminine gender; My sisters and cousins, nay, all that I meet, With eloquent ardour your praises repeat; And you're likely some tender emotions to plant In the sensitive breast of my elderly aunt; You've charm'd the poor woman; she now talks of seeking Some man who professes to teach public speaking; But I rather suspect (so beware what you do) She'd rejoice in some snug private speaking with you. I hear that electors expect to be fed, And will dine (at my cost) at a guinea a-head; I shall take your advice, not a hint shall be lost; Reform shall be mingled with every toast: I've engaged the hotel, and I mean to begin By making it splendid without and within; Transparent devices shall shine on the wall, And “Speedy Reform” be the motto of all; And our landlord, when friends of reform meet to dine, I hope will contrive a reform in his wine: We'll make an agreement to set all our faces Against the receivers of sinecure places. And, talking of that, if I ever should see A place of some consequence offer'd to me; A sinecure place;—Ned, I supplicate you To tell me what then 'twill be decent to do. To you, my dear friend, I explicitly state My scholastic attainments are not very great; The village church-warden (an honour'd vocation) Was superindendent of my education; My master's own portion of knowledge amounts To spelling, and reading, and casting accounts; And I'm in no danger, it must be confess'd, Of eclipsing the talents my tutor possess'd; Now I've lately been frighten'd with stories concerning Some Members of Parliament noted for learning: They tell me that gentlemen sometimes arise Extremely sarcastic,—unpleasantly wise; Who speak very much to the purpose, 'tis said, And quote from all languages, living and dead. If one, thus enlighten'd by college and schools, Were to measure my speeches by critical rules, Or to treat my remarks in a sholar-like way, O! how should I answer? or what should I say? For even suppose I'd the volumes to quote; —Ye gods! what a trouble to learn them by rote!! Answer TO THE CANDIDATE'S SECOND LETTER. Again I write, delighted to perceive How much you estimate the hints I give; A voluntary pupil, you may be Soon amply qualified to lecture me: Yet whilst you urge me to resume my pen, And freely write of manners and of men; Whilst thus you court my counsels, and attend Implicitly to all the rules I send; Whilst arguments so flattering you use To make me scribble;—how can I refuse? And O! believe me, whilst my labour leads My friend to do imperishable deeds; Whilst thus his guileless innocence I guard; The occupation is its own reward: But were it not, the promises you give, That in your life my humble name shall live, Would make me diligent, and bid me claim Borrow'd effulgence, and reflected fame; And though one note alone should crown my task In modern volumes, that is all I ask; Each modern writer of a book devotes One half to long explanatory notes; One work is written—wonderfully good!— It needs another to be understood. Ere long, some highly favour'd hand shall trace Each varied look of your expressive face; And gaping multitudes shall daily stop To view your charms in an engraver's shop: Works of all kinds shall issue from the press, To tell the world the virtues you possess; Enumerating all you've done and said, And giving us your life before you're dead; Your “beauties” then shall grace some hot-press'd page (Selected beauties now are all the rage); When these are cull'd, their next resource will be Your great success in wit and repartee; And whilst each new perfection meets your eyes, Perhaps you'll stare to find yourself so wise. You'll live to be a poet, for I spy A poet's frenzy rolling in your eye; But should you write—(and in these scribbling times What poet ever yet withheld his rhymes?) Should you e'er write an epic, never hint Your thoughts on politics before you print; Remember the reviewers:—some may praise, And find a spark of genius in your lays; But fear those party writers who condemn Each hapless youth who does not think with them. Still undecided, it appears to me You argue thus,—“To be, or not to be:” That's an important question, I admit; If courage fails you, I will answer it:— Be all you wish: shall one, whose breast is warm With happy dreams of radical reform, Shrink from the fray, and let his ardour cease For want of arguments from Rome or Greece? Or fear to benefit the present age, Because he never studied Homer's page? No,—genius is resplendent, overturning All the dull efforts of pedantic learning; Should they quote Latin, never look aghast;— But talk the louder, you'll be heard at last. You ask if, after all the ills you find In place-receivers, you could change your mind; Yes,—if a tempting offer should appear, Some thousand comfortable pounds a year,— You may accept them all, nor fear disgrace, Your former scruples would be out of place; Say learned men have kindly set you right: You see the matter in its proper light; Nor can the change be call'd a dereliction, It only proves you're open to conviction. Let not expensive dinners give you pain— This is a tax which greatness must sustain; Your voters have no interested views, But turtle feasts 'twere madness to refuse; And their huge appetites a proof will give In this they need no representative. Besides, when mortal men on business meet, Without a dinner all seems incomplete: At justice meetings, where grave sages sit Arranging roads or rates, as they think fit; At parish meetings, where in long debate Churchwardens frown in enviable state; At corporation meetings, where 'tis just Paving and lighting should be well discuss'd; At quarter day, when lawyers are intent Collecting in due form a client's rent;— In fact, whate'er is done by saint or sinner, Nothing will prosper if there's not a dinner. Your aunt is worthy of her nephew; now 'Tis time to decorate the female brow With lasting laurels; and your aunt shall claim The glory of establishing their fame. Oh! let her hasten to secluded shades, And found a college for scholastic maids; Let caps and gowns their lovely persons grace; Not fashion's dress, but suited to the place; Their volubility of tongue and pen Will far exceed the oldest, ablest men; She most will charm who most intently tries To take degrees, or struggle for a prize; And we shall boast, midst those who aid our cause, Spinsters of arts, and doctresses of laws. Avoid all those who party views reject, Who always vote as conscience may direct; But worship those who, kings and realms to shake, Boldly oppose, for opposition's sake; And, to obtain the sanction of the throng, Vociferate “whatever is,—is wrong.” When all your plans have prosper'd, and you find Your potent spells regenerate mankind; When your reforming influence imparts Foreign propensities to British hearts; When opposition to your voice is sin, When all your foes are out, and you are in; When you possess importance, pension, place, Your ministers—all ministers of grace; When your decree is law;—you may engage The age to come will be a golden age.

      <field name="fulltext">Miscellaneous Poems. HUMAN JOYS AND HUMAN WOES. As pebbles on the beach appear, Beneath the waters, bright and clear; But taken thence and dried, they lose Their polish'd and transparent hues So human joys in youth receive Those charms which youth alone can give; But when that ardent time is o'er, Their brightest tints are seen no more. As summer clouds, that lightly pass In shadows o'er the sunny grass, And quickly vanish, having made Nought but a momentary shade; So human woes, when hearts are gay, Glide imperceptibly away; And having done their worst, we find They scarcely leave a trace behind. TO A Friend WHO SAID “When you are gone you will forget me.” Let not suspicions so unkind Make parting with you more severe: For I shall ever bear in mind Those friends who made me happy here. And if you feel that you must be, Though absent, mindful of my name; In justice to yourself and me, Believe that I shall feel the same. You say in every form you see A record of our joys you'll find; But distant scenes will bring to me No trace of her I leave behind. Yet oh! in every changing scene I'll think—(for I must think about you)— How bless'd with you it might have been, But how unbless'd it is without you. Lines WRITTEN AT GRETNA GREEN. Here Cupid is free, and there is not a fetter To check his wild fancies, or rob him of bliss: This spot is his own; and there is not a better, For giving love's warm inspiration, than this: And Nancy—if e'er you had treated me coldly (And Venus forbid I should say that you do), Even then from this place I'd petition you boldly, With some little prospect of winning you too. Here lovers unlicensed may soon be united; For all those formalities, dull and severe, Which England expects, are deliciously slighted, And hearts have despotic authority here: And Nancy—whilst viewing love's favourite scene, Where true hearts are coupled, and led to his throne; I vow—(just by way of amusement I mean)— I cannot help coupling yours and my own. Adieu, happy green, though your gambols are pleasant, Though loved by the spirited, youthful, and free; As I have no pretty companion at present, Your privilege only can tantalize me; And Nancy—perhaps I shall never partake Of a fugitive frolic; but oh! if I do, Believe me, my dear, it will be for the sake Of a little associate very like you. Lines WRITTEN IN THE VALE OF LLANGOLLEN, IN WALES. Sweet vale of Llangollen, I bid you adieu, One moment I pause ere my course I pursue; I fondly look back on the scenes I have pass'd, And sigh when I think that this look is the last: Farewell to the glens where the willow trees grow, And shadow the waters that murmur below; Farewell to the rills I at intervals see 'Midst the copsewood that fringes the banks of the Dee. The river winds on with a surface so clear, That through it the pebbles distinctly appear, Except o'er the rock where the waterfall gushes, And hurries in foam to its bed of green rushes; Oh! this is the valley where lovers should rove,— So lovely!—'twas form'd for the accents of love; In a spot so delighful as this, not a word But such as love dictates should ever be heard. Sweet vale of Llangollen! though years pass away Ere I look on the scenes that have charm'd me today; Though the visions I cherish perhaps may be vain, And I never may walk in thy valley again: Wherever I rove—when the soft summer breeze Shall fan me in groves less romantic than these; I'll think of Llangollen, and wish I could see The shadowy path on the banks of the Dee. RETROSPECTION. When I look back upon the past, As o'er a troubled sea; I mourn when I reflect how fast The hand of Time has overcast Days once endear'd to me. Our early joys we dimly trace, When sorrows intervene; Now care our former thoughts displace, And many a friendly form and face Are indistinctly seen. Yet though the gloomy lapse of years Youth's fickle ties may part; Love—an unchanging brightness wears, And e'en in sorrow it appears To sooth the wounded heart. Though pain'd, and slighted, and oppress'd, It still retains its truth; In age—outliving all the rest, This passion clings around the breast, Reminding us of youth. [We parted,—yet I never heard] We parted,—yet I never heard Her lips repeat a last adieu; We parted,—yet no soothing word Assured me she would still be true: And when I left my Anna's side, I only felt that gentle sorrow Which lovers feel, who but divide To meet again in joy to-morrow. Oh! who that from a friend must sever For long—long years,—perhaps for ever, Would wish to fly without possessing A parting look, a parting blessing? Though in that moment are combined All that can agonize the mind; Though lips cannot express their woe, Though tears may then refuse to flow; Though anguish, not to be exprest, Nearly o'erwhelms the throbbing breast; Yet when the trying hour is o'er, And friendly forms are seen no more; When one fond look in vain is sought, There's consolation in the thought That the last word, the parting sigh, Recorded their fidelity. How precious to my heart had been The memory of such a scene; The silent pressure of the hand, Which friends so well can understand; The fond, intelligible touch, Which to a lover says so much; The words, the looks,—which, though they fill Our eyes with tears,—are comforts still. LOVE. How rare is love! not that light flame, Weak and unworthy of the name, By which gay youths so often swear To her who happens to be nearest; Adoring ev'ry form that's fair; The newest always thought the dearest. But oh! how rare the love which wears A form unchanged through many years; Which fades not when the youthful day That gave it birth has pass'd away; Which e'en in age may still possess The fond esteem, the tenderness, The uncontaminated truth, It first profess'd in early youth: Which will not blush, or shrink from hearing Those vows, so fond, and so endearing, Those tender things it used to say In courtship's oft delusive day. Such love, alas! is seldom seen; So many causes intervene To dazzle passion's wand'ring eye, And lead it to inconstancy: So many doubts,—howe'er unjust, So many trifles cause distrust; Trifles at first, but magnified Till the frail mask is thrown aside. In some afflictions, length of years, Or change of scene, may dry our tears; Most have some ray of hope, which still Alleviates the present ill:— But slighted love's a secret wound, For which no earthly cure is found; And how much more acute, to know A hand beloved has aim'd the blow. The mournful youth, whose tears are shed O'er one he loved—now cold and dead; This consolation yet has known,— Living, her love was all his own. But one who many years has moved Near her his heart sincerely loved; Whose presence in his eyes has been The brightness of the brightest scene; Whose words—whose very thoughts, when known, Seem'd interwoven with his own; When he is roused from dreams so sweet, And feels her kindness all deceit; When this is learnt,—and learnt too late, It leaves the bosom desolate. She still may play a fickle part, A part which he can never learn; In vain he strives to teach his heart To think of her with unconcern: To others he can ne'er transfer The love so lately taught by her. But when more lasting feelings blend, And promise love a better end; When hearts by folly are not led, And roses o'er the path are spread, Which may be found, when youth is gone, A couch for age to rest upon; Then let not wordly thoughts destroy The prospect of such perfect joy; Or friends, with cruel kindness sever Those—love ordain'd to join for ever, Oh! love is born in youthful days, When pleasure sheds her purest rays; And love endures to latest years, To sooth our woes,—to dry our tears: It cannot lengthen early bliss, Or cause time's fleet career to stop; But offers age much more than this, Its social joy,—its firmest prop. It cannot join the ties that sever, Or make gay moments last for ever; But, if love's real sparks remain, Moments as gay may come again: It cannot freshen autumn leaves, Or breath new life on vigour flown: And ah! why should it?—when it gives To age a sunshine of its own. TO A Lady WITH A LOCK OF HAIR. Could locks of hair the thoughts unfold Of those upon whose heads they curl'd, You'd have a chance of being told The sweetest sayings in the world. Then would this little lock reveal Each secret sigh, each fond regret; All I have felt, and all I feel For one I never can forget. If it said true, 'twould say thou art My daily care, my nightly dream, The cherish'd idol of my heart, My constant thought, my constant theme. But ah! it owns no magic spell To be the record of my woes; And I will guard my griefs too well, To let them injure your repose. And wherefore should I wish you here,— The hope is vain, it cannot be; For other scenes to you are dear, And other friends have banish'd me. Perhaps their words more warmth impart, A nobler form perhaps they own; But none can bear a warmer heart, Or love you more than I have done. Their eyes more lustre may possess, Their lips more skill'd in flattery's lore; Yet though perhaps I please you less, I feel they cannot love you more. The trees their pendant blossoms bear, The bowers their former shade renew; But not again to deck your hair, But not again to shelter you. The lawns as soft a verdure boast, The same enjoyments still remain; 'Tis I am changed, 'tis I have lost The joys, the hopes that warm'd me then. Yet still at eve I wander there, Our former walks I still may see; The walks remain—but where, oh! where Is she who made them dear to me? Because my tears have pass'd away, The world may think I love you less; But features would be seldom gay, Did all disclose their wretchedness. 'Tis true they never see me weep; They little think the pangs I feel; But no affliction is so deep As that we labour to conceal. I care not what befals me now.— Can ought on earth deserve my care?— I know these things are past; but how Can I forget that “such things were?” TO ELLEN. Ellen! there was a time when I could tune My harp to mirthful measures, and repeat My songs of love with confidence, for soon Your lip in singing them could make them sweet: The voice of others might my accents greet With praise, or with contempt; I gladly flew From their reproach, a recompence to meet In Ellen's smiles of kindness;—for I drew The subject of my song, and its reward, from you. But now my harp is tuned to notes of woe, In losing you it lost its lively tone; And those who now the voice of praise bestow, Can never praise or look—as you have done: Their words may be the same, but there are none Who breathe them with an accent half so dear; They may look kindly too;—but you alone Can glance forth kindest looks that banish fear, From lovely laughing eyes that could not be severe. In fancy's vision I behold thee now, In form and feature beautiful and bright; With locks of darkest brown upon thy brow, And eyes that beam with most expressive light: Thy charms shall be remember'd when the sight Has ceased to trace them; as the blaze of day Lives unforgotten in the gloom of night: The hope that sweetens love hath pass'd away, But hopeless it exists, and never can decay. How dull and cheerless is the garden walk! How uninviting is the ball-room's blaze! The gay lyburnum withers on its stalk, The monthly rosebud unobserved decays, For Ellen cannot wear them:—still I gaze Upon the spot that you inhabited; And trace the happiness of former days: Sad is the memory of pleasures fled, Like thinking of those friends who loved us, and are dead. LOVE AND SCIENCE. Once, when Rosa was cruel, I cried, in a pet, My passion I'll conquer, her charms I'll forget, The bloom of her features shall lure me in vain, I'll change my sad fetters for freedom again; Through the mazes of science henceforward I'll rove, And with books, pens, and ink, bid defiance to love. After giving the damsel a hasty adieu, To astronomy first I with eagerness flew; And with look most profound I examined the skies;— But the stars made me think of my Rosa's bright eyes; And the hue of the heavens, the beams of the sun Recall'd,—what I hoped they would teach me to shun. To geography quickly I turn'd to explore On a map's painted surface the sea and the shore; But my eye glanced them over, and rested alone Upon one spot of earth, and alas! 'twas that one Of which I had firmly resolved to beware; For Rosa, and all her attractions, were there. Next in painting and music I hoped to insure For my love and my sorrows a permanent cure; But, in spite of all caution, my pencil would steal A sly little outline of Rosa's profile; And I always observed that my flute and my voice Were only in tune to the songs of her choice. I then turn'd to botany, studying hard To bury each trace of my former regard; But my thoughts were abstracted, nor heeded the bloom Of the tulip or rose, or the lily's perfume; For memory still to my mind would present A check which afforded a lovelier tint. To poetry next I devoted my time, And pour'd forth my sighs and afflictions in rhyme; And I found with delight that I loved to revile Each action of Rosa, and laugh at her smile; But, alas! it this sorrowful truth did impart, She was most in my thoughts, perhaps most in my heart. “Ah! me,” I exclaimed, “all my efforts are vain, “Dear Rosa, receive your poor truant again; “Without you the moments are tedious to him, “His instrument useless, his telescope dim; “And science herself can no longer engage, “Unless you are near him to point out the page.” YES, MY LOVE, YES. When I see the kind looks you bestow on another, And think of the time when those looks were my own; How can I the pangs of anxiety smother, Or cease to remember the joys that are flown? You love me no longer—severely I feel it, Yet would not for worlds you should share my distress; If my sorrow afflicts you, with care I'll conceal it, I still wish you happy—oh! yes, my love, yes. Your affections could ne'er be so fickle and veering As to treat him with scorn you so lately approved; Ah! when you first charm'd me with looks so endearing, You meant to be constant, and thought that you loved: Then may you be blest—for I never can blame you, Though torn with an anguish I cannot express; 'Mid the friends of my bosom, believe me I'll name you The first and the dearest,—oh! yes, my love, yes. I still will remember, though fated to lose you, Those dreams that deluded my fancy so long; When a story or song from these lips could amuse you, And you were the theme of both story and song: But my lips have forgotten their amorous measure, My harp is tuned only to sorrow's excess; Your name is still dear, and I breathe it with pleasure, Yet sigh as I breathe it—oh! yes, my love, yes. TO A Lady WHO DECLARED THE AUTHOR WAS IN LOVE, SAYING, “I read it in your eyes.” Say not you read it in my eyes, For eyes, alas! are sad deceivers; And they may well their system prize Who boast the name of unbelievers. In eyes, and their mute eloquence, I once reposed my whole reliance; And studied hard to gain from thence The fundamental rules of science. I once perused those splendid books, And gazed on animated pages; Reading much more in Ellen's looks Than e'er was taught by ancient sages. What charms did wisdom then present, To make me long for its possession; I found each glance an argument, And every smile a proof impression. I never thought that too much time To such a subject could be given; Each little sentence was sublime, And every chapter spoke of heaven. I read with rapture, and supposed My constant diligence was prudent; But now those looks to me are closed, And charm some more deserving student. With literary zeal I seek A second or a third edition; But every other must be weak, Placed with the first in competition. Then, lady, never hope to find A tale of truth in tender glances; In these, believe me, are combined The wildest fictions and romances. Yet still the charming science prize, Nor heed the warnings of dejection; And may you read in smiling eyes, Assurance of the heart's affection! TO ROSA. Fair Rosa! when on me you smiled, And caught me in the artful trap, All thought me then most blest, and styled Your love—a feather in my cap. And now that all those smiles so bright Have fled before woe's stormy weather, Alas! I find my friends were right, Your love, indeed, was but a feather. TO LAURA. Dear Laura! when you were a flirting young miss, And I was your dutiful swain, Your smiles could exalt to the summit of bliss, Your frowns could o'erwhelm me with pain: You were dear to me then, love, but now you're my wife, It is strange the fond tie should be nearer; Yet when I am paying your debts, on my life You seem to get dearer and dearer. TO A TELL-TALE. When I told you my secrets, you know 'twas your boast They would all be “between you and me and the post;” But since I can trust to your faith, and my own, How is it, good sir, that my secrets are known? “Between you and me and the post” it must be, And I have my suspicions of one of the three; The post spread the rumour, and such its extent, I believe 'twas the two-penny post that you meant. CONDOLENCE. A fine farmer's daughter (who thought that all labor Wast vastly degrading, and base) Was courted and won by a volatile neighbour, Who left her to grief and disgrace. The farmer convey'd her with rage to her lover: —The father he vowed should atone; Who said (when the heart-rending story was over), “My woes are as great as your own.” “I pity her vastly, yet now you have brought her, “Good neighbour,—there's nought to be done; “I only can say you've a very bad daughter, “And I have a very bad son.” A TRIP TO PORTSMOUTH. (A FACT.) A country farmer who, by constant care, Had realised some hundred pounds a-year; Thought that as Jonathan, his only son, Had just attain'd the age of twenty-one; 'Twas surely time the hopeful youth should see Something of fashion and gentility: He therefore purchased him a Sunday coat, Furnish'd his pockets with a ten-pound note, And sent him forth, to rove a month or two, And visit Portsmouth and the grand review. The youth, who innocently thought, 'till then, That all mankind were Zomerzetshire men, Nor dreamt the world could possibly contain One foot of ground beyond his native plain; Now look'd around,—and view'd, with vast delight, The varied scenes that met his aching sight; Whilst every joy the former far surpass'd, And each new wonderment excell'd the last. At length the period of return is come, And Jonathan prepares to journey home; Resolving in his way to pass an hour Near Winton's vale, and famed St. Cross's tower. Onward he rides, with slow and pensive pace, Noting the rural beauties of the place: When lo! as near St. Catherine's hill he's straying, The College boys, as usual, there were playing; And in their sable gowns, with smiling faces, Upon the grassy steep were running races; Awhile he paused,—astonish'd at the fun: Thought 'twas exceeding odd, and then rode on. On his return, with sage and knowing mien, He thus relates the wonders he has seen; “Father, I've witness'd mighty men, 'tis true, “I've seen the kings, the ships, and the review: “At sturdy Blucher too I've had a peep, “And in a boat have sail'd upon the deep: “But oh! dear father, what amazed me most, “Was—as one morn through Winton's vale I cross'd, “I saw—(a sight I ne'er did see before)— “Matter of fifty parsons, aye, and more; “Black gowns and all! (methinks I see them still) “Full fifty parsons running down a hill!!!” Epistle FROM A LADY AT CHELTENHAM, TO HER SISTER IN THE COUNTRY. Dear Bess, when I left you, I promised to write An account of our doings each Saturday night; And beginning with Monday, by sketches diurnal, To give my epistles the form of a journal; But spare me, dear sister, for here 'tis my fate To be walking so early, and dancing so late; Here's so much to be done, and so much to be said, So much work for the heels (not to mention the head), You must only expect an occasional scrawl, And think you're well off to be noticed at all. Oh! Betsey, I wish that my ink and my pen Were fit to describe all the balls and the men: The balls are exceedingly gay; but the fact is, I know them as yet more by precept than practice; For waltzing's the fashion, and that I confess Is an art which at present I do not possess; But a Dandy has offer'd to show me the way, And appointed to give me a lesson to-day, So you see I improve, for I'm learning already To do giddy actions without being giddy. What damsel would lavish her breath or her skill On a dull country dance, or insipid quadrille; I'm weary of both, and with languor I view The formal precision of “En avant deux;” Where they study their lessons with serious looks, And often peep into their sly little books Thus searching a volume when rather perplext, To find illustrations of what should come next, As if “chassez croisez” no man could succeed in Without meditation, and very hard reading. Whilst these duodecimo books I detest, Country dances I think even worse than the rest; Where unsociable space loving partners divides, Who smile at each other from opposite sides; And, instead of soft pressures and whispers seraphic Their little endearments are all telegraphic:— There you stand in a set of two dozen, and stop Till some get to the bottom, and you to the top; And when you are there the reward you obtain Is to run down the middle, and run up again; And then the vile ill-looking creatures, who stand All eager in turn to take hold of your hand; As you follow the leader through twenty or thirty; With hands very warm, and with gloves very dirty. But in waltzing you're join'd (as in marriage) to one Who claims (or should claim) your attention alone; Unless on the circle of gazers you glance, Assured they are thinking how well you both dance. In patent Kaleidoscopes all may discern A novel attraction at every turn; And every movement presents to the sight A figure more perfect, a colour more bright; But waltzing, though charming to those who can do it. Is rather fatiguing to people who view it; For though turns are incessant, no changes you meet. But giddiness, bustle, embracing, and heat. At first they move slowly, with caution and grace, Like horses when just setting out on a race; For dancers at balls, just like horses at races, Must amble a little to show off their paces. The music plays faster, their raptures begin, Like lambkins they skip, like tetotums they spin: Now draperies whirl, and now petticoats fly, And ancles at least are exposed to the eye. O'er the chalk-cover'd ball-room in circles they swim; He smiles upon her, and she smiles upon him; Her arm on his shoulder is tenderly placed, His hand quite as tenderly circles her waist; They still bear in mind, as they're turning each other, The proverb “one good turn's deserving another;” And these bodily turns often end, it is said, In turning the lady's or gentleman's head. POSTSCRIPT. When you talk of this dance, I request it may be, Not waltzing, but valtzing, pronounced with a v. I suppose in the village you've nothing to do But to drink your bohea, and play cribbage and loo. By the bye—now I'm talking of tea, it is serious To hear that this article's so deleterious; You'll drink it with terror, I'm sure, when you know That they make it with verdigris, copper, and sloe; Slow poison our beverage surely must be, With sloe juice in our wine, and sloe leaves in our tea. An Epistle FROM AN APOTHECARY IN BATH, TO A SURGEON IN LONDON. This Epistle was occasioned by a regulation which was supposed to exclude all “Venders of Medicines” from the Kingston Rooms in Bath. My dear Mister Lancet, I take up my pen To tell you the wrongs of us medical men, To speak of oppressions we all have endured, And utter complaints which can never be cured; And oh! I shall tell you of usage so vile, That 'twill fever your blood, and unsettle your bile. After feeling the pulse of the old and the young, And making remarks on a dowager's tongue; After striving to remedy mortal disasters, With poultices, blisters, emetics, and plasters: You know, my dear friend, with what joy and delight I used to attend the assemblies at night; And, weary of making up potions and pills, I gazed at fair faces, and join'd in quadrilles: Oh! this was delightful; there weekly I met A dozen fair patients, arranged in the set; And as we cross'd hands, I approach'd them so close As to see the effect of my yesterday's dose. Thus whilst to mamma I prescribe the Bath waters, A dance with myself I prescribed for the daughters; I often applied to my partner by chance An enlivening look as we went down the dance; And thought it my duty sometimes to impart Aperient physic to open her heart. But would you believe it? I now am disgraced! From the book of subscriptions my name is erased! They've sent back my money, and wickedly swear No “vender of medicines” shall ever go there! It seems 'tis their firm resolution to stop All medical people who smell of the shop: No pounder or mixer of physic may see Their new operations:—whereas an M. D. Because he's diploma'd, and licensed to kill, May boldly prescribe, and subscribe if he will; A doctor may still be a dancer, and thus Rooms are open to them, but are costive to us. To be sent in disgrace from the gay and the young Is surely sufficient to blister my tongue; 'Tis enough to suspend animation, and place My professional drugs in the hues of my face. But list! and beware, oh! ye Kingston Committee! How ye injure the physical strength of the city: For if you persist in your new regulation, You'll keep out the Mayor and the whole Corporation! Awhile ye may triumph, and laugh at our woe— But when ye are sick, and your spirits are low, When those you turn'd out shall at length be call'd in, Oh! tremble, for then shall our vengeance begin: Whole legions of gallipots soon shall arise, And surgical terrors shall dazzle your eyes; Your bowels shall suffer,—we'll punish you thus, Remembering that you had no bowels for us; Pillulas and powders shall fall to your lot, Till we find you no longer worth powder and shot; We'll drench you with drugs, and new plans we'll pursue, And try all experiments first upon you; Your blood shall be spilt, and your tears shall be shed, And our phials of wrath shall be pour'd on your head. You see, my dear Lancet, I'm quite in a passion At being expell'd from the regions of fashion; I will not submit to so grievous a fall, For I never can stomach the measure at all; You surely must own this medicinal question Will prove to our tribe rather hard of digestion: When I feel I'm consider'd a vulgar excrescence (My blood's in a state of complete effervescence) I'll poison our foes,—nay, their end shall be shorter, I'll pound them to death with my pestle and mortar; No ball-room committee shall ever controul us, Is the firm resolution of Anthony Bolus. Lines SUPPOSED TO BE WRITTEN BY A LADY ON THE DEATH OF AN ONLY DAUGHTER. Oh! tell me not to smile again, Since dear Maria's smiles are o'er; Oh! tell me not my tears are vain, For that must make me weep the more. You say that Folly ever rules In tears and unavailing sighs;— —If feeling be the badge of fools, I've no ambition to be wise. Go bid the stormy billows cease, Go chide the whirlwinds of the air; But never whisper words of peace, To soothe the sorrows of despair. Oh! they are rooted in my heart, No balm can ever banish them; The rose once cropt,—no magic art Can e'er replace it on the stem. No spell permits us to retread The paths where youth and pleasure smiled; No form of words can raise the dead, Or give me back my only child. Then say no more that tears are vain To one so desolate and sad; I ne'er can view her form again, She died—and yet I am not mad! I am not mad—I yet survive Through life's drear path to wander on; But who, alas! would wish to live, When all we loved on earth are gone? TO ?. Farewell.—Now our friendship is over,— Henceforth let all intercourse end; For he who is false as a lover Can never be true as a friend: Away! when in boyhood I sought thee, Sincerity beam'd on thy brow;— And then—oh! I could not have thought thee The wretch thou hast proved thyself now. Had the hand of adversity taken Each flowret that bloom'd in your view, Or had you by her been forsaken Who now is deserted by you; Had the storms of misfortune assail'd thee, Yet left thee in virtue the same; Oh! then I would proudly have hail'd thee, Nor blush'd to acknowledge thy claim. It surely was cruel so early To darken her opening years, And leave one who loved you sincerely A prey to repentance and tears: The world, with its frowns and its terrors, May punish her fault if it will:— But you were the cause of her errors, You should have protected her still.
