      <field name="fulltext">Vlpian Fulwell to his Booke. When lustie Ver beginnes to decke eche bushe and bowe with greene: And Flora faire in flaunting wise is gorgeous to be seene: Then Natures Impes tryumphes with ioy till horie Hyemps frowne: Whose frostie face with blastes bedewde Turnes all these vpsy downe. His stormie stoutnesse dryues the byrdes their warbling notes to seace: He keepes as captiue, flowers faire, till spring do them releace. Yet can his vysage not preuaile The Flower of Fame to vade: Whose growing greene shall not be shutt in griesely winters shade. As Hedera with hawtie head doth scorne syr Boreas blast: Euen so this pierlesse Flower of Fame shall stande as firme and fast. Out of which stately Blossom breedes Note.a Bud of Eglentine Whose worthinesse adornes the stocke of natures noble lyne. Not euery whiffling taunting wynde that flyes from scornefull tong: Sall shake the stalke, ne yet the Flower to do it any wrong. For why (my booke) thy Patrons name Such noble sownde doth yelde: That thou maist thinke thy selfe well bleste, to shrowde vnder his shielde. Before whose feete, wee bothe will lye and hope such grace to fynde: That wee with ioye may passe abrode to please thy Readers mynde. Which thing God graunt. A manifest description of king Henryes noble vertues. Prepare your pennes ye Poets fyne, Your wittes &amp; curious heddes now showe: In fyled phraes of flowing ryme, Your stately styles do ye bestow, On hym whose fame ryght farre doth flye, and lodged is in starrie Skye. To whome whyle lyfe in corps did laste, The myghtie Ceasar would geue place, The conquerors of worldes past, may yelde vnto Kyng Henryes grace. whose onely name was such a shield As feard his forrein foes in field. His kyngly Maiestie was such, As ioyed eche faithfull subiects hart: And Rebells proude he forct to couch, By dint of Sworde to feele the smart. A second Alexander hee, In valianties appeerde to bee. And that which Princes best beseemes, Gods glorie he did much aduaunce: The chiefest thing belonging to a king is to set forth good glorie.Repressing Error that had bene of many yeres continuaunce. This was his cheefe ioy and delyght, Whereby Gods gospell shyneth bryght. His carefull hed in this respect, A chaire of state in heauen hath woon: Where he soiurnes with the elect, A mate with heauenly fathers sonne. whose seat is set in lasting blisse, and crownd with crowne that endlesse is. The fower Vertues were so well within his sacred brest yfraught: Too simple is my pen to tell the giftes that nature to him taught. My skillesse quill is farre too bace, To paint the prudence of his grace. A Salomon for Godly witt. A mirror for all Princes.A Solon for his constant mynde: A Sampson when he list to hit the furye of his foes vnkynde. Unto his fryndes a gentill Lam, A Prince that loude a valyant man. Whome God by dyuers meanes did blesse, As one well worthie of the same: With victorie for to represse His enemies to his great fame. And many yeres to rule and raine, To Englandes ioy, to Scotlandes paine. Yea, and a blessing more then this, That doth ryght farre surmount the rest: Which is to English hartes a blisse, wherewith this happie Realme is blest. Elizabeth Queene. His daughter doth him so reuyue, as though the Father were alyue. In whome such vertues rare are seene, As makes farre countreis maruaile much: That shee a virgin and a Queene. In godlynes and wit is such. Though lyfe from father be exylde. His giftes are left vnto his chylde. As worthie Prince, by due discent, The regall Scepter for to guyde: And Christ his foes for to preuent, By Godly zeale shee doth prouyde. The fathers steppes shee treades so ryght, As doth eche English harte delyght. So that though Royall Henry bee Returnde to earth from whence he came: Elizabeth, yet may we see, doth bewtifie her fathers fame. Whome God preserue in Regall seat, Til Nestors yeres be full complete A Discourse of the vnyting the two noble howses of Lancaster &amp; Yorke, from which vnyted howse, king Henry was the first king that proceeded. When mightie Ioue from heauenly throne, Behelde the blody broyle, That Mars had made through ciuill sworde, within this countrey soyle. And pitying the ruthfull rage that on this Realme did rayne: Most louingly did bend his eares, to heare our moane and plaine. The earth that earst was brewd with blood, beginneth now to ioye: By the Bore is ment k. Richard. The Bore is chaced that was wont this Realme so to annoy. The Lady Concord came from Heauen, To stablysh this decree: That Lancaster &amp; Yorke henceforth, vnyted shall agree. Meethought I hearde the golden wordes That Concorde did resite: And eke mee seemde myne eyes behelde, This noble heauenly wighte. Who pierst the Skyes with warbling winges, and Scepter in her hande: Uppon her hed a Diadem ycompast with a bande. Whereat my mynde was all amazde, To muse I coulde not ceace: Till at the last I myght perceiue, It was the bande of peace. Her face as bright as Phebus beames, Concord a heauenly Wyght.Her heares, lyke burnisht Golde: Her feature like an Angell shape, As ioyed mee to beholde. With comly grace shee did commaund that scylence should be synde: To rule the prease that then was thear, Till shee had saide her mynde. When all was whusht, and euery man with listning eares was bent: To heare her speake, then with these wordes, shee shewd forth her intent. Oh noble lande, since first the tyme The wordes of lady Concorde vnto Englande.that Brute in thee did raygne: Whose lyne intestiue warre did ende, As fame doth yet remaine. Turmoilde and tost with ciuill Sworde, Thou sundry tymes hast bene: Such was thy lott and such mishap, as yet in thee is seene. Thy noble peares haue yeld their soules When fatall Sworde had slayne: Unto the Theater of Ioue on Mars for to complayne. Thy vulgar sorte in hugie heapes do prease their plaintes to showe: With humble sute that perfect peace, in English land may growe. And Ioue that long haue rewde thy cace, hath sent mee for to ceace These bluddie broyles, and now to turne thy warre to perfect peace. Where discorde raignes and breedes debate, Subuertion is at hande: And dayly proofe doth shewe that hate confoundeth many a lande. Let Troyans testifye the same, Let Pryam witnesse beare: What Seignorie cannot bring forth Examples bought too deare. Desire of rule doth oft tymes dymme Ambition an enemie to all common wealthes. And clips the fame of lyfe: When Subiects touche the Princes seate, by sowing seede of stryfe. The Romaine rowt can well declare, The smart of Pompeies broyle: Numidia remembreth well, The brunt of Iugurthes spoyle. With thousandes more, whome to resite, were tyme but vainly spent: But ryght shall sit in Regall seate, The Tyran to preuent. And God that all these turmoyles vewes, at last will worke his wyll, When false vsurper shall take foyle, then ryght shall florish still. To thee (oh famous Realme) I speake, whose brute doth pierce the Skyes: Which for thy wealth, the Heauenly heste, This order doth deuyse. And I, of Ioue the messenger, this newes now bring to thee: With bande of Peace, as faithfull pledge, If thou thereto agree. What losse and languor thou hast had, Thy selfe canst witnesse best: And Mischiefe hath not sparde to spurne, To purchase thy vnrest. Wherefore the God that guydes all thinges, doth charge thee that with speede Thou ioyne in knott of Mariage, as thus he hath decreede. There is a lande in Westerne soyle, That Britaine hath to name: Which coast doth now retayne the wyght that must thy quyet frame: A proper youth, of pregnant witt, A description of k. Henry the vii. To whome with speede repayre: Of Lancaster that noble house, He is the ryghtfull heire. His Princely porte doth well deserue, To wear thy Regall Crowne: By due discent to wield the Sworde, with fame and bryght renowne. This worthie wight shall turne the warre That long thy wealth hath wast: This Earle Henry shall redresse Thy wayling woe forepast. Now see the sequell of this hest, That God appointed hath: Marke well the meane against Syr Mars, To pacifie his wrath. A noble spouse within thy lande, Of ryght must now be found: To linke in sacred wedlockes state, And Queene for to be crownde. Beholde a Uirgin bryght of hue with vertues force bedect: Of personage surpassing all that Nature hath elect, Dianaes peere for chastitie, A seconde Susan shee: Her godly nature well deserues A Goddesse for to bee. The daughter of a Royall king, That rewlde thy lande of late: The heyre of Yorke, that long hath beene with Lancaster at bate. Elizabeth this Lady hight, The daughter of king Edw. 4.The late king Edwardes chylde: Shee shall bring forth a peerlesse Prince, thy people for to shylde. Now sith these houses twaine hath causde Such ruyne for to raygne: Which bluddie broyle hath forced thee to feele the smarte and paine. With speede repaire to Britaine lande This Henry home to call: And place him in thy regall seate, Be ye his Subiectes all. As for his Foes take ye no feare, For God his frende doth stande: He is annoynted of the Lorde, to rule thy famous lande. Which being done, let sacred state The ende of lady concords Oration. of Wedlocke ioyne these twayne: Then be thou sure in perfect peace, hereafter to remayne. When Concorde had these wordes rehearst and all her message tolde: To see the ioye that men did make, was wonder to beholde. With clapping handes and cheerefull shoutes They shewde foorth great delyght: And thought eche day to bee a yere, till he shoulde come in syght. And when that Fame had blowne her blast that hee had taken lande: Determining to chace the Bore with force of myghtie hande. Eche man him selfe do then addresse, This royall Prince to place: With courage stoute and loyall hartes, They serue his noble grace. The Byrthe of the puisant Prince King Henry the eyght, which was in the yere of our Lorde God. 1490. the xxii. of Iune. When Lady Concorde quencht the broyle, That cyuill Sworde long tyme had bred: And calmed eke the warlyke toyle, Wherewith this Realme but earst was fed: Our thraldome then shee did remoue, And freedome sent from God aboue. The houses twayne that long had beene At deadly foode for regall throne: Of Lancaster and Yorke I meane, were then by God conioynde in one. This Mariage made, Sir Mars geeues place, And eche man thankt God for his grace. But he that doth all thinges foresee, And knowes the sequell of the same: knewe that a Braunche of that same tree, Shoulde bring forth fruite of endlesse fame: And yelde such sapp as should delyghte, The Heauens and eke eche English wyght. The natall day by Gods decree, Approched on with luckie speede: When as the blossome of this tree Should shewe the fruite of happie seede: Whereat both heauen and earth reioyce and shewe the same with cheerefull voyce. The fower vertues myght you viewe, Descend from Heauen in Golden Cloude: And to beholde the heauenly crewe, that ioyed this birthe with voyce full loude: Did sounde suche tryumphes in the skyes, That through the worlde rounde it flyes. Then Iustice tooke the Diadem That shee herselfe was wont to weare: Her Ballaunce eke and ioyned them, whereby shee wonts eche cause to heare: And yeldeth them vnto his grace, In equitie to run hys race. When Iustice had her selfe thus yelde, Came Fortitude with cowrage stoute, And deckte this Babe with Sworde &amp; shyelde, To conquere all the raging rowte, That shoulde attempt or take in hande, His princely power to withstande. Then Temperance and Prudence eke, So decked there his sacred mynde, As neuer earst was seene the lyke, Such grace from God to him was synde. For Solon there did yelde his fame, And Salomon eke did the same. The Muses all obeysaunce made, And echeone gaue a Lawrell crowne: Sir Mars did there him selfe disgrade, And yeldeth vp his large renowne. This Prince did Ioue him selfe ordaine, In endlesse fame on earth to raygne. And though he were a seconde sonne, yet God foresawe what shoulde ensue: The Royall race that he should run, Ere he was borne ryght well he knewe. And in the wombe did him appoint, with sacred Oyle and king annoynt. When tract of tyme had brought this Prince, Unto the age of eyghteen yeres, His raygne began in this prouince, whose noble courage then appeares. That English hartes great ioy did make, And forayne Foes then gan to quake. King Henry the eyght being proclaimed king of Englande the xxii. day of Aprill 1509. goeth to the Tower of London. Beholde the happie day at hande, For him to weare the Regall crowne: Whereby to rewle this noble lande, And wield the same with high renowne. Which was declarde by Tromp of Fame, That all Europa hearde the same. Unto this blast of golden sounde, Did forrein Princes bende their eares: The noyse to heauen eke did rebounde, That Englandes Foes then quake in feares. And frendes vnto the English Roye, with clapping handes gan shewe their ioye. Then as the auncient custome was, To London Tower is he brought: With Regall porte he so did passe, That all men ioyde in worde and thought. His countinaunce of Regaltie, shewde forth a kingly Maiestie. So that if thousandes in his way had right resemblance of his face: Yet euery man myght iudge and saye, Lo this is hee, God saue his grace. He did the rest excell so farre, as doth the Sunne the dimmest Starre. Within this noble Castle nowe This Royall king his seat hath take: Whose speciall carke and care is howe In order good his Realme to make. His whole desire and studye is for to reforme that was amisse. Where Prudence rules with good foresyght, The common wealth doth prosper well: Where wisedome guydes eche thing aright, Thear Commons seeldome do rebell: But serue their Prince with loyall hartes, And nothing slack to do their partes. The stately porte that Princes beare, With Iustice ioynde ryght to mayntaine: Both holdes the Subiect in due feare, And trewe allegeance doth remayne. This king did his affaires so frame, As made men feare and loue his name. Of the Coronation of king Henry the viii. If Fame foresawe what woulde ensue, As well as thinges forepast: Shee woulde not rashly sentence geeue, In blowing vp her blast. Ne woulde shee iudge eche tryumph then at first for to excell: But that another might succeede to beare away the bell. What meanst thou Fame in auncient tyme to call the learned trayne: To paynt the Pageaunts that were shewde, when Caesar gan his raygne. And cause them then with painfull toyle, the same so to commende: As though it neuer shoulde take foyle, but last vnto the ende. If thou hadst knowne as now thou doest, Of this moste happie day: I doubt not but thou wouldste haue causde their painfull Pennes to staye. Yet is this thing not so far past, but that thou maist reclayme: If thou recant thy former blast, by calling backe againe. Reuoke therefore thy rashe exployt, whereat I must needes grudge: And when thou hast perpended well, Thy selfe shalt be the Iudge. And plainly see that Caesars gestes Ne his tryumphing fame: Nor yet his blased pompouse daye, was equall with this same. Against the tyme this pierles Prince, The stately towne shoulde passe, That London hight, whose gorgious stretes, So richely decked was. That Rome whereof so many write, In pompe for to excell: Was neuer yet adornde so braue, Nor furnisht halfe so well. More lyke a pleasant Paradice, That noble Citie seemde: Then lyke a place of earthie moulde, As men might well haue deemde. So sumptuously the stately streates, were deckt with euery thing: As though that Ioue from heauen were come to be their earthly king. So ioyde men in this Royall Prince, when he his Crowne should take: That Sorroes all were set to sleepe, and solace did awake. The worthie Pageaunts that were shewde, My Pen cannot discharge: And to descrybe the same aright, will fill a volume large. Which passing sightes so seemely were set forth to view of eye: That Rome and Greece with all the rest would let their fame go by. And Caesars frendes that so aduaunce his tryumphes and renowne: Would come from graues if that they myght, their Pennes thear to throwe downe. Thus as he passed through the streates, vnto the crowning place: Eche man erectes his cheerefull voyce, And sayes God saue your grace. His noble trayne of worthie Pieres, Eche one in his degree: Attende on this most royall king, A worthie sight to see. In fine, no shewes of Princely pompe At this tryumphe did want: The Conduites all gush out with Wine, wherof there was no scant. To Westminster thus gan he passe, To take the Crowne his ryght: Where bothe his Queene and he were crownde To Englandes great delyght. Of the winning of Turwin and Turnay. Who list to reade of Martiall actes, Bellona, the goddesse of warre.And of Bellonaes trayne, May in the eyghth kyng Henryes lyfe, A Myrror see most plaine. Of warre shee is the Goddesse stoute, on whome doth still attend, The noble crewe and armed rowte that fatall bowe doth bende. This direfull Goddesse here rehearst hath at a call alwaye Three handmaydes euer readye prest, her pleasure to obey. Whereby shee Princes doth correct and Cities stoute subdue: That lyue and raigne disorderly, and rule by meanes vntrue. The firste is Blood by dynt of Sworde, The seconde Fyer fierce, The thirde is Famyn worst of all, that cruelly doth pierce. And eyther of them by her selfe is able to throwe downe The myghtiest king and Conquerour that euer yet waer crowne. But if they all conioyne in one, what Prince, what realme or lande: Or else what worlde might remaine, their powers to withstande: So puissant these Damsels are, That on this Goddesse wayte: And being by their Lady calde, they then addresse them strayte, To shewe dame Natures dyrefull kynde, that shee to them hath yelde: With terror then they shewe their force on Castle, Towne or feelde. This Goddesse and her handmaydes three with all their myght and mayne: Alwaies attendant myght you see vppon king Henries trayne. The Scottes can well reporte the same, who felt therof the smarte: when all the cheefetaines of their Realme were slayn by deadly darte. Now let king Iames his griesly ghost awake from fatall sleepe: And shewe his hap and rufull fall that causde all Scotlande weepe. Let all the Scottish noble peeres, bewayle the wofull hower: when they agreede on Bramston hilles to meete king Henryes power. But sith from Earth they may not ryse this dolefull tale to tell: I will for them declare the trueth in order as befell. His foes of Fraunce, whose faithlesse leagues, he euer found vntrue: Can witnes beare of his great force, They all his stoutnesse knewe. And Turwin first shall testifie his puissance and myght: Who felt the smart of Fyers rage with losse of many a knyght. Now see the sole and onely cause that he this siege did laye: In proper person with his power vnto this townes decaye. When tract of tyme had tryde the truth, that Frenchemen wonts to holde, Whose breache of truce and Princes peace, No wight could yet witholde. This Roiall king sent foorth his Shippes, with hoysed Sayles aloft: whose force did scoure the coast from foes, and quaylde their courage oft. But yet he thought his presence myght accomplysh many thinges: That coulde not so in absence bee, Such is the porte of kinges. A comfort to the Subiectes all, A terror to the foes: A Princes person in the fielde doth seeledome conquest lose. His person in the fielde was suche, As made his Souldiours stoute: His onely name woulde feare his foes And make them stande in doubt. His counsell graue so prudent was, his wytt so wisely stayde: That all the rest myght leaue consultes when he the woord had sayde. When thus his prudence had perceiude with iudgement and foresyght: Now that his antique foes of Fraunce, deteyned his due right. He causde his noble Name then in readynesse to lye. And he him selfe determined, Sir Neptunes chaunce to trye. The Shipmen take their tackles then, and all thinges redy makes: With gladsome hartes the Soldiers all this cheerefull voyage takes. The Shippes are rygde with all thinges meete For such a royall trayne. This noble king is nowe embarkte, his ryght in Fraunce to gayne. With noyse of Gunnes and sound of Trumpe, and stroke of rollyng Drum: They cut the rage of foming waues, tyll they to Fraunce are come. With marching foorth in warlyke wise, to Turwin towne they bende: who then perceyues it is hye tyme, herselfe for to defende. Her walles and Towers they are deckt with tooles of Vulcanes frame: No thundring noyse of Gunne was sparde, No flashe of Fyers flame. But when their eyes could witnes beare, this king encamped then: And sawe the siege so stoutly set with lustie valyant men: Their hartes began to quake and quayle, their courage then abate: They knewe his presence in the Campe was to his trayne a gate And strong Portculleys to defende his lusty Soldiers stoute: Whose faithfull hartes vnto his grace for Foes did neuer doute. A Harolde then with blast of Trumpe, was sent out of the fielde: To summon them obediently vnto their Prince to yelde. Or else to stande vnto the lot, that myght to them befall: By dint of Swoord or Fiers flame, or Famine worste of all. Who aunswerd then that they were bent, the chaunce of warre to trye: And to defend their furnisht walles, and theron lyue and dye. Which messadge being then returnde, it was a wondrous sight: To see how soldiers hasted then, with Turwyn men to fight. The Trumpets blewe, the Drummes stryke vp To shewe Sir Mars his lore: A terror sure it was to heare the thundring Cannons rore. The king right lyke a ventrous knight did nothing balke the brunt: He comforted the Souldiers all through euery Bande and Front. Saint George Saint George they all gan crye, and fiercely do assayle Their enemies within the towne, with hope for to preuayle. No engin was omitted then that myght their purpose gayne: The battry was so fierce and sharpe, that they in thende were fayne To parle, and to entreat for peace, their states for to maintayne. In fine they craude for mercye then, Acknowleging their faulte, Desyring his most noble grace to cease his sharpe assault. And they his vassayls woulde become, and faithfull to his Crowne: In token of their loyaltie, they yelde to him their towne. And all the furniture thereof, to vse at his owne will: Desyring that he will vouchsafe, their bloods not for to spill. Whose noble aunswer was againe, Sith you for mercy craue: We mercy graunt you for your lyues, from bloody Swoorde to saue. With Trump and Banner then displayde, he entreth this his towne: An. Regni. 5.Saint George his flagg is then aduaunst, And all the rest throwne downe. Anno Domini. 1513. The Lamentable complaint of king Iames of Scotlande, who was slayne at Scottish fielde. Anno. 1513. Among the rest, whom rewfull fate hath reft, whose shrouding sheetes hath wrapt their woful lyues why haue not I a place among th? left, whose fall eche tong with dayly talke reuyues. Such is the wheele that froward Fortune driues To day a king of puisance and might, And in one howre a wofull wretched wight. A happie life by happie end is tride A wretched race by wofull ende is known: Though pleasant wind the Ship do rightly guyd At last by rage of stormes tis ouer throwne. The greatest Oke with tempest is fyrst blowne. Though fortune seeme a loft to hoyse thy sayle, Yet fortune ofte tymes smyles to small auaile. I thought my Bower buylt on happie soyle, Which vnder propped was with tickle staye: Wherfore on sodayne chaunce I tooke the foyle In hope for to haue had a noble praye. In search whereof I reapt my fatall daye, With shamefull death my fame was forcte to bow A gwerdon meete for breach of sacred vow. A Prince his promise ought not to be broke, Much more his Othe of ryght obserude should be: But greedie gayne doth oft the mynde prouoke, To breake both othe and vowe, as seemes by mee. Ambicion blearde myne eyes I coulde not see. I fynd, though man with man his faith forgoe Yet man with God may not do so. I was a king, my power was not small, I ware the Crowne to wield the Scottish land: I raignde and rewlde, the greater was my fall, The myght of God, no kingdome can withstand, An Earle wan of mee the vpper hande. With blodie Sworde my lucklesse lyfe to ende, By shamefull death without tyme to amende. Such was the force of Atrops cruell spight, Unlooked for to cut my fatall lyne: My wretched carcas then was brought in sight, Through London streats, wherat y? Scots repine The endeles shame of this mishap is myne. Like butchers ware, on horsbacke was I brought The king of kinges for me this end hath wrought. Let Princes all by me example take, What daunger tis to dally in such cace: By periurie their faythes for to forsake, Least seate of shame shall be their endles place, Foule infamie shall their renoune deface: Of falsed faith such is deserued hyre, And he must falle that will too hyghe aspyre. Ye noble Peeres whose liues with myne did end, Send forth fr? graues your griesly ghosts ech one To wayle the chaunce that Fortune vs did sende. Let all the Scots powre out their plaints &amp; mone That we to hedles haste were apt and prone. Which rashe beginning voyde of Godly awe, Had lyke successe for breach of sacred lawe. I thought that Englande had beene far to weake, For my strong powre when Henry was away: Which made mee light regarde my vow to breake But yet I founde they were left in good stay, With force and strength to purchase my decay. Thus my aspiring minde had guerdon due, Which may a Myrror bee for men to vewe. Whereby to shun the breach of sacred vow, And not to seeke by lawelesse meanes to rayne: For right will force vsurped rule to bow, And reape repulst in steade of noble gaine, Thus truthe in tyme doth turne her foe to paine. And GOD him selfe doth shield the rightful cause Then let men learne to lyue within his lawes. The Lamentation of king Iames, Sonne vnto king Iames before mentioned. What hard mishap haue I among the rest, Whose froward fate vntimely deth hath wrought while youthfull yeres did harbour in my brest, My wretched corpes to lodge in claye is brought. By haples chaunce contrary to my thought. But who is sooner trapte by witched wyle, Then he whose harte is free from craftie guyle. Shall I exclayme on fortunes frowarde face, Or on the wombe that life to mee fyrst gaue: Or on my Fathers facte whose foule deface Hath caused mee this luckelesse lot to haue: Would god my mothers wombe had ben my graue Or els the Ayre that yelded mee fyrst breath, With sodayne dampe had rendred present death. Woulde God my Fathers facte had beene vndon, When he made vow a faythfull leage to holde: Or els I woulde I had not beene his Sonne But rather borne to pen the Sheepe in folde. My Father in this poynt was far too bolde Whereby he moude almighty GOD to spill Him selfe and me his Sonne that thought no ill. What may I deeme of this my Fathers deede, Whereof I grounde the chiefe cause of my playnte What stonie harte for pittie will not bleede, To see how death this pageaunt doth depainte, In floure of age, our liues so to attainte: The Father and the Sonne sucessiuelie The Realme eke plagde for one mans periurie. I can not scuse his rage and hautie pride, That forced mee my vnkle to offende, Who courteousely my comming did abide, In frendlie wise a time with ioye to spende. I was constraynde my owne minde to vnbende The Prelasie then bare so great a swaye, That king and keiser must their mindes obaye. I was constraynde contrarye to my will, Reuengement on the English Realme to take And eke of Mars his lore to learne the skill Where I lyke Phaeton my match did make, My foes mee rulde, my frendes I did forsake. Though I was king, another bare the sworde, Whome I durst not offende in deede ne worde. I call for vengeaunce on thy wretched lyfe, Thou Prelate proude that hast procurde my fall: Thou were the cause and aucthor of the strife I was thy Prince and yet I was thy thrall, Take heede therefore by mee ye Princes all. Where enuious subiects beares so great aswaye, The Princes state is like for to decaye. Such men they are as fyrst do stier vp stryfe, But they them selues of sauegarde will be sure: Their deedes are scant, their words are very ryfe, They rayse the broyle, the brunte they not endure, Yet bloody warre they dayly do procure. And prease foorth Princes to auenge their yre Whyle they them selues with gredy minds aspire. Lo by this meanes my fatall shrouding sheete, Is now my weede no other robe haue I, The graue is eke my Courte a Pallas meete: Wherein my wretched corps for aye must lye. Wo worth those subiectes that aspire so highe, To rule the Prince whome they ought to obay, Such subiectes rule hath purchast my decaye. Howe King Henry and the King of Fraunce met together betweene Calice and boloigne by a place called Morguison 1532. My glauncing Pen nowe glyded ys From Mars his bluddie broyle: And eke my muse desyres to rest a whyle in frindships soyle. As waywarde warre bereues the breath of many worthie wyghtes: So frindly peace preserues the lyues of noble valyant knyghtes. And Tully doth preferre that peace which grounded is on yll: Before the warre whose quarell ryght, The blood of man doth spill. In faithfull league of frindships force where Princes knitt the knot: Unto those realmes whyle it doth last is sure a happie lott. The Princes sleepe is not vnsounde, For doubt of forraine foes: The Souldiers werye wounded limmes to rest do then repose. The Marchant sendes hys hoysed sayles the surging Seas to sheare: Which scowreth through the wandring waues deuoyde of doubtfull feare. The publyke state of common wealth then lyues in quyet rest, So that recourse from sundrie soyles Both worke all for the best. Eche countrey helpeth other then and what one lande doth want Another doth supply the same, no needefull thinges are scant. And eke through Concorde sclender thinges to valure great encrease: But discorde both consume as fast then let vs praye for peace: Which causeth worldly wealth to ryse and frindly faith to flowe: As thother hath contrarye force, and makes wealth ebbe as lowe. Nowe frindship that long tyme had sought to knitt within her bande: The king of Fraunce vnto the no- ble King of this oure lande: Founde out a tyme conuenient, and eke indifferent place: Whereas these noble Princes bothe together myght embrace. To treate of faithfull frindships lore with one consent they meete: Where they with ioye and tryumphes greate eche other then do greete. The thing that bothe Realmes long desyrde, at that tyme myght you viewe: The order of which ioyfull sight, hereafter doth ensue. The Historie of the winning of Bulleyne by the moste victorious King Henrye the eyghth in his owne person. Yf townes subuerted coulde declare, with tong or paynting Pen, Their rufull falles and finall fate their losse of worthie men: Or if the ruinous Castels olde that flatt on grounde nowe lye, Or else the walles that earst were deckt with lofty Turrets hye, Coulde shewe their wofull ouerthrowes by any kynde of waye: And eke what Captaines them subdude to take the spoyle and praye: Then Bulleyne that was wont to bragg in brauery of her myght: Woulde clips her fame of large renowne, that earst did shyne so bryght. This stately Forte, whose furnisht walles felt neuer yet annoye: Nowe playnly shewde the auncient tales that Poets tolde of Troye. Prince Agamemnon with his Greekes that wan olde Ilions towne: In all his toyle of tenne yeres siege gat neuer such renowne. The mighty Monarke Macedon that conquerd Darius soyles Wonne neuer greater victorie, thoughe many greater spoyles. But as king Henries courage stoute alwayes his foes subdude: So mercy matcht his manly mynde who bloodshed still eschewde. He neuer brewde his sworde in bloode on them that mercy craue: His face with fauour still was fraught, submissiue men to saue. And Bullein men among the rest, can testifie this case: Who tasted both his force, and eke his fauourable grace. What mischiefe myght his hand haue wrought, if tyrannye had raygnd: Or rage had harbourd in his brest which he alwayes refraynd. Though pleasant prayes do oft entice the mynd that gapes for gayne: To passe the boundes of princely fame, great spoyle for to obtayne: Yet no such crime of greedy mynde from mercy might him moue: The towne of Bulleyne can right well this fame of him approue. Theyr towne, theyr lyues, theyr goodes and all, lay in his might and power: For to haue spoylde and ouerthrowne, and destroyde in one hower. But piety prickt his Princely hart, in mercy to excell: Whose noble nature doth deserue for prayse to beare the bell. An Epitaph of the deathe of the moste valyant and renowmed Prince King Henry the eyghth. Awake ye worthies nyne, that long in graues haue rest: Powre out your plaints with wayling teares Let langor be your geast. Do off your shrowding sheetes, that clads you in the claye, and decke your selues with black attyre, your mourning to displaye. Bedewe with saltie teares your manly faces stowte: Laye downe those weapons that were wont to quell the raging rowte. For nowe that pierlesse Prince that neuer yet tooke foyle: The eyghth king Henry hath resynde his bodye to the soyle. Recorde your dolefull tunes, ye noble Peeres eche one. Let gryping greefes gnawe on your breastes to shewe your pensiue moane. With bryndie blubbered teares, ye commons all lament: Sende forth your sobbes from boyling breast, let trynkling teares be spent. For our Achilles nowe hath left vs in the fielde: That wonted was with valiant force from foes our lyues to shylde. And this hath death deuysde to wrecke his wrathfull spyght: wherefore (O Mors) wee curses yelde on thee both daye and nyght. Oh noble Brutus lande, howe much was death thy foe: when he with cruell darte constraynde this Gemme from thee to goe. But though the cursed dame that cuttes the fatall lyne: So muche enuyed thy happie state in making him declyne: Yet God through mercy great in spyght of death his darte Hath left a Blossome of his braunche to ease thy pensiue smarte. For whome now let vs praye, that shee the race may runne of Nestors yeres, with like successe as yet her grace hath done. And that his royall Impe Elizabeth by name: May weare the Crowne and wielde the sworde with ioye and endlesse fame. Whose lyfe doth render lyght vnto her fathers fame: whose noble harte doth plainly shewe the stocke from whence shee came. Though death hath done his woorst with drift of dyrefull darte: By stryking of that valyant king and piercing of his harte: Yet hath he not the powre his fame to ouercast: which shall remaine in mouth of man whyle Pen and ynke doth last. And eke the shyning Sunne shall cease his running race before king Henries worthie fame shall suffer one deface. And as his soule is lodgde with Ioue in starrie Skye: Euen so remembraunce of his name on earth shall neuer dye. A Preamble to this parte of the Booke following. Lyke as the auncient Greekes haue painted out at large, Their noble ladyes worthie lyues and therof taken charge: And as the Romaine dames had writers of their actes, Euen so the trowpe of Englysh trayne haue some to tell their factes. Whose bryght and shyning fame deserues to haue a place, Coequall with the best that hath runne on in vertues race. Then let not Englande blushe to blase their ladies lyues, Which no whit is inferiour vnto the Romayne wyues. Let them vaunt if they list of Lucrece chastitie, I prayse the greekes Penelope for her fidelitie. A nomber myght be namde that wryters pennes haue praysde, Who for their lyues and noble actes an endlesse fame hath raysde. And yet among the rest that retche their fame so farre: Let English dames shewe foorth their shyne lyke Venus twinkling Starre. Whose nomber sure is greate, although I name but fewe: But yet as tyme will lycence mee I shall more largely shewe. The lyues and noble actes of Ladyes in those dayes: whome noble vertue hath aduaunsde to winne immortall prayse. For lyke as valyant men therof do gayne renowne: So worthie actes of weomen kynde may not bee quite throwne downe. Fame may not parciall bee but as desertes requyre: Must yelde to euery worldly wyght their due deserued hyre. A Commemoration of Queene Anne Bullayne. Ye noble Imphes of Parnas hill, Ye Muses all arowe: Resownd your pleasant melodie, your warbling notes bestowe. Take wrest in hand to tune those stringes that render Siluer sownd: And let the voyce of Musikes lore vnto the Skies rebownde. Blo vp with ioye the chearefull blast of Englandes blissefull state: In prayse of this most noble Queene king Henries lawfull mate. Let Poets decke their sacred heds with leafe of Lawrell bow: And take their painfull Pennes in hande their skill to publishe nowe. A gracious Queene and lawfull spowse King Henry (lo) enioyes: who earst was helde from wedlockes lawe by shewe of Romysh toyes. Her vertuous mynde and Godly harte Gods worde doth so embrace: As well deserues in Bibels tome her noble name to place. Whome Ioue hath fedde with heauenly foode and knowledge of his truth: And eke adornde with sacred giftes in this her tender youth. Anne Bolloygne (lo) this ladye hight, whose praise for to depainte: My quaking Quill in trembling fist, doth quayle and gins to fainte. Lest that the rudenesse of my style myght Clips her noble fame: Whose praise, the best that handels pen of ryght shoulde fynely frame. Let Virgill leaue dame Didos actes and fate of Priams towne: And take of mee this charge in hande to purchase him renowne. Or else vouchsafe (O Sulmose Imphe, to lende thy Pen awhyle To furuishe forth with eloquence the basenesse of my style. But well I see it is but vayne for helpe of them to craue: In whome no ayde is to be had, that long hath lodgde in graue. Wherefore my Muse, although thy skill be rude and farre too bace: Yet take thy Pen to write somewhat of her most noble grace. Her harte did harbour heauenly giftes that in her brest was bred: And Pallas for her wisedom seemde to soiurne in her hed. Her face and featurde shape was fraught by Nature passing well: Her inwarde giftes and outwarde grace all others did excell. Thus Ioue ioynde with Minerua here, this noble Queene to frame: So that it playnly did appere, from heauenly throne shee came. A Phenix right, whose course of kynde ys singuler alwaye: Whose ashes yeldes another byrde, So one remaynes for aye. This noble Phenix in lykewise Notehath of her sinders sent A noble Impe, a worthie Queene ere shee from worlde went. Whose Princely praise hath pearst the pricke and price of endlesse fame: And hit the marke of regall race from whence her highnesse came. Ye noble dames that do delyght for vertue praise to gayne: Desire to know this Princes lyfe and learne for to retayne: Those vertues that you then may viewe, as Mirrours to you all: Then shall you reape the right renown, that neuer shall take fall. An Epitaph on the death of Queene Anne Bullayne. Yf wayling woes might win thy life, to lodge in corpes agayne: Thy bodie should O noble Queene, not thus in graue remayne. For if that death might life redeeme, and life were bought with death: Ten thousande to restore your lyfe, woulde render vytall breath. But sith that may in no wise bee, for death woulde worke his spight: With yernefull voyce and dolefull domps we shall expell delight. And shew our greefes with secret sighes, and langour of the breste: The flodds of teares shed for thy sake, declares our harts vnrest. And were it not thy royall Impe did mittigate our payne: The sorrow for thy fatall day, wee vneth could sustayne. Yet this somewhat recomfortes vs for that we be moste sure Thy blessed soule is lodgde with God Foreuer to endure. Also thy noble splendent fame O noble Prince Queene Anne Shall liue on earth till worldes ende within the mouth of man. And eke thy lyfe shalbe a lore for Ladies all to learne: Wherin they may, as in a glasse Dame Vertues path desearne. A Commemoration of Queene Iane. Among the rest, whose worthie lyues hath runne in vertues race: O noble Fame peruse thy trayne, and geue Queene Iane a place. A nymphe of chaste Dianaes trayne, a vertuous virgin eke: In tender youth, a Matrons hart, with modest mynde most meeke. So that dame Vertue may reioyce for breeding such a wight: Whose nature shewde the fayre bright beames of vertues shyning lyght. Whereby shee was elect and chose to bee the linked mate of valyant Caesars equall Peere, till Atrops shewde her hate. Whose whirlyng wheele doth wander still, and runne with restles race: And is as frendly to the Page as t him that beares the Mace. Thus till the Sisters did agree, to cut the fatall lyne: This noble Lady euermore to vertue did enclyne. Whose Godly lyfe and finall ende, I wish ech lady vew: That Fame may in her Register, for aye her name renewe. An Epitaph of the death of Queene Iane. Yf dart of death might be repeld, by fame of verteous life: And fatall Sisters would with hold, the blade of bloody knife: From cruell cut of vitall lyne, to spare the worthie wight: This noble Queene shoulde not haue felt, the rancor of theyr spyght. But sith in exorable they, for euer will remayne: The body though they cause to couch, good fame they cannot stayne. The valiant men, the verteous dames, that on the earth hath raygnde Haue yelded to their cursed knyfe, yet endles fame hath gaynd. They haue subdude stowte Caesars hart, they forcde not Helens hewe: Of Cressus wealth they no whit carde they ioye all to subdue. And eke among the rest that hath sustaynde their cancred hate: This noble Queene hath felt the flame of her vntymely fate. Whose worthie fame shall not be shutt with bodye in the claye: But lyue and florishe on the earth whyle Phebus guydes the daye. In Prayse of the renowned Ladye Queene Katherin Par. Dame Vertue longing to behold her troupe of noble trayne: Determined to take the vewe of them that did remayne. Appointing Fame with sound of trompe, to sommon and assite: Ech one that in her booke was namde to be a worthy wight. Of weomen sect (as for the rest) another tyme should bee: For famous menne to shewe theyr selues, ech one in theyr degree. This noble troupe assembled was most goodly to behold: And eche one called by theyr names as Fame had them enrold. The Goddesses sate in there seates, the Graces placed were: The Muses nyne, the noble Nimphes, in theire degrees sat there. Dame Vertue being cheefest iudge and lady of the place: Decreed that one among the rest, should beare the cheefest mace. Commaunding euery lady theare, to answere to theyr name: As they in order should be calde, by voyce of noble Fame. When this decree proclaymed was, and all thinges whusht and still: My greedy eyes to view this sighte, coulde neuer gase their fill. Then Fame calde for Vlisses wife, whereto one sayde strayght waye: That dyrefull death with cruell launce, had lodgde her corse in claye. Then heard I good Cornelia namde, and many other calde: Some aunswerde here, and some by fate in earthy clod were stalde. At last by lot the Cryer sayd, where is that noble Dame: That was the eight king Henries wife, and had K. P. to name. Wherto a noble English Queene, that then was in the place: Made aunswere that her mortall lyfe, had run the fatall race. Then vertue sent foorth saltie teares, and bad the Cryer pawse: And sayd shee lost the worthiest wight, that euer kept her lawes. Dame Pacience with wringing handes, her dollor did declare: And prudent pallas, for her parte, no paynefull plaints did spare. The Muses mooude with mestiue moode, resounded dolefull voyce: The Graces all with rented heares, in langor did reioyce. In fyne the whole assembly there, in sodayne sorowes were: For ech one thought this noble Queene, dame Vertues Mace shoulde beare. At last stoode vp Virginitie, attyred all in whyte: Whose countenaunce lyke Phebus beames, did yelde a heauenly lyght. Unto the iudge dame Vertue shee, her minde began to showe: with Angels voice and Heauenly grace, eche worde shee did bestow. O noble Dames leaue off (? shee) your dumpyshe dolors staye: And licence mee, O rightfull iudge. somwhat herein to saye. With that it was a ioye to see How sorowes were resynde: And Vertue bad Virginitie proceede to say her minde. Eche one attentiue eare gan bende to heare this noble voice: Whose prudent wordes and graue deuyse, made all the rest reioyce. This was the tale the Goddesse tolde, O worthie wightes drawe neere: And see the only cause, that wee are nowe assembled heere. Ye are the troupe and noble trayne that vertue hath embracde, Whose endlesse fame for vertues sake, shall neuer be defacde. Here haue you hearde that auncient dames by fatall stroke are slayne: And yet theire names in booke of Fame for euer shall remayne. Among the rest Queene Katherin Par, (so was her Parents name:) Hath yelde her soule vnto the heauens, yet left on earth her fame. Unto whose lot it shoulde haue lyght dame Vertues Mace to guyde: But cruell Atrops all too soone, her noble race enuyde. Yet one among this worthie crewe must take the charge in hande: whose due desertes, for vertuous praise, in chiefest place must stande. Here is a royall Queene in place, whose lyfe I knowe right well: within whose brest, euen from a babe, vnto this day I dwell. Whome you (O Lady Vertue) fyrst committed to my charge: When nature made her perfect moulde, her skill to shewe at large. And whyle vpon this Princely babe in Cradle I attende: You Lady Pallas came in haste, your heauenly giftes to spende. And Caliop with all her Nimphes, made haste from Pernas hill: For to adorne this peereles peace, with perfect learned skill. You lady Graces know right well, and beare it yet in mynde: What haste you made vnto this babe, ye fearde to bee behynde. In fyne her grace was theare adornde, with all your giftes so well: That outwarde shape and inwarde giftes, Panthora did excell. Her father was a royall king graund Captain of the trayne: Of all the worthie warlike wights that fame did euer gayne. Her noble Mother bare the bell for vertue in her dayes: Whose worthie fame with toung and Penne hath reapte immortal prayse. And shee a virgin (lo) doth were the Fathers regall crowne: And prudently doth wyeld the sworde, with lardge and bright renowne. She hath repressed errors blinde, and causde Gods worde to shyne: Whose noble lyfe from vertues lore, did neuer yet declyne. Shee best deserues to haue the Mace, that vertue meanes bestowe: Elizabeth of England Queene, you all her grace do knowe. And let Queene Katherin Par enioye Fame for her vertuous race: And vnto Queene Elizabeth dame vertue yeld thy Mace. No sooner had virginitie, this sentence vttred tho: But all the reste with one consent, sayde Lady be it so. Then Vertue praysde the noble Mayde, that thus this tale declarde: Commaunding scilence to be synde that iudgement myght be harde. Then saide the Iudge, this is the doome, and sentence in this case: Queene Katherin Par in booke of Fame shall haue a speciall place: And noble Queene Elizabeth as cheefest of my trayne: Shall take this Scepter at my hande, as meetest for to raygne. Hereat this noble heauenly crewe brake vp with greate delyte: And I yet holde my Pen in hande Queene Katherins lyfe to wryte. The names of the Capitaines that were at Hadington, as neare as coulde be called to remembrance. The Earle of Shrewsberye. The Earle of Rutlande. The Lorde Graye. Sir Iames Wilforde. Sir Iames Acroft. Sir Wadam Selinger. Sir Oswalde Wolstrap. Sir Robert Worsley. Capitayne Pellam. Capitayne Dethick, who was my cheefe instructer in this matter. Capitayne Wood. Capitayne Windam. Capitayne Tayler. Capitayne Collbie. Capitayne Fitzwilliams. Capitaine Tiberio an Italian. Capitayne Whitton. Capitayne Boothe. Capitayne Pikeman. Capitayne Gam. Capitayne Garton. Capitayne Bagshot. Capitayne Ashley. Capitayne Lawson. A Commendation of the Englishe Souldiers that serued at this siege of Hadington. The frowning furious dame, that hight Bellona fierce: That grieflie Goddesse, whose outrage doth Kinges and Countries pierce: Drewe forth her bluddie blade, Sets vp her Stander blacke: And fenced with her fyerie Flagg, to worke her wrakefull wracke. Who can scape scotfree then, that dares abyde the broyle: The noble harte for honour fyghtes, the Tyran huntes for spoyle. The Cowarde crakes with woordes, and hopes for happie daye: Yet is he not the firste that strykes, nor last that runnes away. At point of harde distresse, a hardie man is knowne: At ratling shott or hunger sharpe a dastarde is downe throwne. But when Bellona sawe the warlyke Englishe wyghtes: That at this siege, in Marciall actes affied their whole delyghtes: Shee wondred as shee myght, to see that all her rage: Coulde by no meanes, the haughtie hartes of Englishe men asswage. Tryumphing Garlandes then with speede shee gan prepare: To crowne those lustie Captaines all that had of her no care. The nobles that were theare Shee gaue eche one a Crowne: Adorning them by due desert with large and bryght renowne. And then shee calles by name the rest to take their hyre: Whiche was, that they shoulde to the toppe of mounting Fame aspyre. Sir Wilforde come thou first, Receiue thy iust rewarde: Thy hautie harte, of furious foe had neuer yet regarde. Sir Croftes come forth also to clayme thy worthie name: Controll eche misse, for so thou maiste, Thou winnest the forte of Fame. Sir Sellinger approche Thou setst thy Foe at naught: Sir Wolstrap in the Arte of warre hath worthelye bene taught. Sir Worseley was not worste, but of the worthie wightes: And thus Bellona made an ende of talking to her knyghtes. Now Pellam that hath charge of Pellet and of Shott: A Garlande had by due desert, as lyghted to his lot. And Dethicke dreading nought the daunger of his foe: By polecie with prowes ioynde, gaue oft the ouerthrowe. Wood woulde not take the foyle at anye equall matche: And Windam well coulde wynde the twist his wylye Foes to catche. Fitzwilliams woulde not slacke to fyght for countrey soyle: And Taylers trustie diligence sparde not for any toyle. But Collbie knowes the cast the craking Scot to trayne: His name in Scotlande is well knowne, but to their often paine. Tiberio tooke no care for his Italia lande: But manfully among the rest, did in the quarell stande. And Whitten whet his witt, eke playde his parte full stowte: And Boothe woulde neuer balke the brunt of Frenche or Scottish rowte. Pykeman past thorough the Pykes and provde a valyant man: And Gam by prowes wonne the game that Frenchemen woulde haue wan. So Garton he coulde guyde and garde his menne full well: And Bagshot was no whitt abasht what chaunce soeuer fell. As Ashleyes Auncent came with honour from the fielde: So Aslaby wan good reporte to Foe he woulde not yelde. Nowe Lawson is the laste, yet not of lowest name: But equall with his captayne mates that hath deserude good fame. Thease Captaines and their men them selues so stoutly showde: That Garlandes of still lasting Fame is now on them bestowde. A Garlande is small gayne, wheare lymmes and lyuing lacke: I wishe the Souldier as my selfe to feele no kynde of wracke. And suche as flowe in wealth and seese a Souldier pore: I woulde he were in forefrunt set when rattlyng Canons rore. Finis. The Aucthor. When Fame rang out her Larum bell of glorious golden sounde: And blewe the blast of Princes actes whiche in her booke shee founde: By her enrolde and Registred in Scroll of endlesse brute: Whose memories shoulde neuer quayle vntill eche tung were mute. This sownde of Bell and blast of Trompe was hearde to Parnas hill: Where as Queene Caliop and her trayne do vse their cunning skill. Theare myght you see these noble Nimphes throwe downe their Lawrell crownes: With ruffeled heares, outragiously to fling through Dales and Downes. And gad, more lyke to wandring wyghtes, Then learned Ladies sure: And euery one a Poet sought her Pen to put in vre. At last (by chaunce) I met the Muse that wonts my quill to guyde: who is the symplest of them all, and when shee mee espyde: All haile (quod shee) euen thou art hee whome I do nowe requyre: Take Pen in fist without delaye to finishe my desyre. For nowe it lyghteth to thy lot King Henryes fame to write: And though thy Muse be verie base, shrinke not for to endyte. When thou hast done thy diligence The learnedst of our trayne: To polyshe this that thou hast done, will not shunne ne disdaine. Alas (quoth I) my louing Muse, Tis far for mee vnfitt: To write his due deserued Fame, requyres a learned witt. Shall Coridon take Harpe in hande, where Orpheus is in place: Arions pleasant melodie doth Pannes rude pype deface. But all this myght not moue the Muse to alter her request: Shee forced mee to take my Pen and so to do my best. Thus brought shee mee to Hermon hill, where heauenly dewe doth dwell: Note And thear I wrote as shee mee taught God graunt it be Ful well. FINIS.</field>
