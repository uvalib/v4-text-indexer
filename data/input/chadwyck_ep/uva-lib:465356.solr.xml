      <field name="fulltext">ATALANTA. CANTO I. Ecce tibi HesperiÃ¦ Tellus! hanc arripe velis. Virg. Of Albion's reign, with delegated sway, O'er Indian realms, her progress and decline Thro' factious usurpation, till the pow'r Of Concord, in her golden sphere, dispel The gath'ring storm, I sing, on trembling wings Borne by the Muse o'er Atalanta's wave. Queen of the song! who strung the Latian lyre To strains sublime, and crown'd the righteous cause, When tyrant Julius, and his frantic train Of tribunes leagu'd, o'erturning Freedom's seat, And law and country in great Cato's fall, Come from the sacred hill! where with the Nine, By bow'ring shades, and hallow'd streams, you lead The Roman bard, and twine with blooming flow'rs His sacred crown, and in oblivion soothe His wounds, fresh streaming for his country's woe: O! aid the Muse! else grov'ling, to ascend Th'etherial heights, where Fancy dwells; bestow A wreath to shade her leafless brow; she sings, In liberal verse, thy fav'rite theme attun'd To native notes. And, thou bright orient Beam Of War! whose radiance gilds the martial praise Of an illustrious Line, their loyal zeal, Their pride of arms, their patriot love approv'd In adverse times, reflecting, as afar Your sparkling crescent o'er the western storm Smiles like some friendly planet, in thy sphere Diffusing mild benevolence and joy, Meet solace of the brave, who proud pursue Your conquering banners on Atlanta's shore, Smile on my strains! ambitious of the shade Your laurels yield, from Envy's blast, the Muse Thence culling flow'rs to deck her barren lay, With PERCY's name would consecrate her song. Beyond the blaze of grandeur, birth, or pow'r, Long may thy brighter glory shine, and fame Sound to the list'ning world, heroic praise Crown'd with celestial clemency, who bids The weak and injur'd rest beneath thy shield. Fair England's awful Genius be thy guide Thro' fields of war, thy heavenly guard to turn The deadly shaft; and, as the storm subsides, Infold thy valour in a mother's arms, Whilst filial duty, at a Parent's tomb, Sad tribute pays, and wipe her Soldier's tear. Far o'er the deep, where bright Hyperion decks His western throne, and Ocean's radiant queen, With orient imitated state receives The spheres bright regent in his native clime, A mighty region lies, extending vast From the bleak Arctic to the golden South; With crowding nations throng'd, a dauntless race From Albion's isle, nurs'd in Hesperian plains, 'Mid blooming dales, and groves, and copious streams Cerulean, where in silver circling arms Majestic Thetis folds her fav'rite land, The pride and bulwark of the western world. This rich domain Neptune of old consign'd His proffer'd dowry, when the Albion prince Espous'd the Ocean's daughter: Long he urg'd In Thetis' court his am'rous suit, and scarce With sov'reign honours won the royal maid; What time the sea gods all in marine state Rode forth, and gliding in their em'rald cars, Nereus, and Doris, with their daughter train, Brought home the blushing bride. In princely guise With ruby crown, 'mid bending waves she went To Thamis' iv'ry hall; her spousal song The Syrens sung, and the glad Tritons blew Their coral trumpets: With orisons pure Each goddess bless'd their union; and to grace With recompence their virtues, Neptune gave This western world, like a rich pearl, to deck The golden splendours of their triple crown. In proud Augusta thron'd, their sov'reign race With blameless rule their dove-like scepter sway'd, And wreath'd their coronal with radiance meet Of mildness, clemency, and public love, Attemp'ring public justice. Thro' the realm, Like dulcet charm of spring, their influence beam'd, Restoring nature; commerce, arts, and arms That seven-fold shield, encircling all we prize, Flourish'd; and Freedom dealt her blissful store, Inspiring all. O'er hill and peopled plain More sweet the seasons smil'd; streamlet and flood, And rural Thame, kissing their margin green, Grottos, and bow'ring shades, glad winding, roll'd Their tribute to the ocean; while the voice Of happy nations, like the incense breath Of dewy morn, when prime Aurora wakes The grateful flowers, with meet response of praise The fount explores whence all their blessings flow. Nor less beyond the surge, their new domain, Cherish'd in Albion's warm embraces, grew A mighty empire, from the parent state Deriving pow'r, and firmness, native worth, And that Promethean flame which fires the sons Of Albion, beam'd from Freedom's fearless eye. For o'er this region fair, her fav'rite child, Her latest, best belov'd, the Queen of Isles With doating fondness hung. Bright teeming Hope, Fost'ring their infancy, with transport's eye Rapt into future golden dreams, repays, Like a rich usurer, with vast return Her growing care. From every crouding port The eager youth, whose manly bosoms burn For vent'rous enterprize, like Hybla's swarm In summer-tide, burst forth. O'er the blue wave Their daring sails a new-found world explore: Till drawn by joyful rumours of a land, Like eastern Charan, or the blooming dales Of blissful Eden water'd, to their lure The fervent nation hasted; Ocean groan'd Beneath the cumbrous navies; and the winds Had grudg'd their office, but that now they bore Such sacred freight of freedom's sons, of arts, And industry, to polish, not lay waste, The fairest portion of the new found world. The Nereids from crystalline grots ascend, To smooth their path; and in their rocky fort Stern Ãolus his blust'ring bands confin'd. In van, with trident scepter grac'd, the Sire Of ocean led their wat'ry caravan; 'Till, safely landed on the promis'd shore, Where her proud palace shines with iv'ry tow'rs, And brazen valves, the Ablion Goddess spoke, While list'ning silence held the circling throng. âYe Britons! whose aspiring minds surmount âAll dangers, braving the rude winds and waves, âWho waft my native treasures, richer far âThan eastern pearl or gold, here fix your seats; âAnd as my victor navies ride the main âWith naval thunders, to subdue the pride âOf guilty tyrants, in your charge rejoice âTo bless the nations; pour with lib'ral hand âThe sacred gifts on each neglected shore, âThat bounteous Heav'n may see the tribute praise âOf good diffusive, and the poor, and weak, âAnd erring stranger in thy light rejoice. âGo! where assenting fates ordain; extend âTh'entrusted talents to remotest climes. âUnto these wond'ring Indian realms display âMy cross and banner, signs of sacred peace âAnd amity, like Heav'n's bright bow, to calm âThe lowring storm, and bid wild discord cease. âGo! fix the barrier where usurping night âMay hide remote till the bright day star rise, âAnd drive rude Ignorance thy moody train, âWith frantic superstition, to their place; âWhere endless war and rapine, lawless pow'r, âAnd bondage grim, and desolation rude, âAnd burning zeal, the fiercest, worst of fiends âThat e'er from Erebus assail'd, may find âTheir cruel fangs restrain'd: Behind my shield, âTheir refuge, bid the welcome nations rest âFrom harm, as in their peaceful sanctuary; âTheir Indian kings, and feather cinctur'd chiefs, âAnd various quiver'd tribes, whose peaceful seats, âIn friendly league, you shelter, not destroy. âAnd see! where in yon fertile islands, crown'd âWith bow'ring shades, the wood nymphs fair invite, âAs in Calypso's haunt, your bless'd delay; âOr by the margin of cerulean floods, âSwell'd with a hundred tributary streams âSalubrious, choose your seat; or in the plain âSkirted with distant hills and ancient woods, âWhere gay Pomona smiles, and bellowing herds âWith native freedom range in lusty droves, âTheir rural theatre. What Heav'n bestows, âWho guides the fervent nations, sees them rise, âOr from their radiant zenith set in shades, âRanging their progress, summit and decline, âWith reverence I intrust your charter'd right, âIn duteous subord'nation to the realm, âThe Parent realm, whence all your blessings flow. âNurs'd in her fost'ring arms your tribes shall rise âA mighty nation, 'mid the sunny vales âLike Israel 'camping, numerous, nor enslav'd âBy tyrants fang: Your own AUGUSTUS reigns, âAnd decks with public love his civic crown. âBeneath the refuge of his scepter'd arm âPossess this fertile land: The village gay âWith rural industry construct; with walls âAnd ranged streets, and spiry turrets plan âImperial cities; and from op'ning ports, âWhere the glad voice of mariner resounds, âAs to the whistling winds aloft he gives âThe swelling sail and waves his last adieu, âSend forth your trading fleets to hide the seas. âNor fear the hostile foe, with Envy's eye âMalignant still, repining at your good. âWith seven-fold shield your own AUGUSTUS guards âThe sons of freedom; ev'ry tyrant's dread, âHis thund'ring fleets and conqu'ring hosts shall shake âEach adverse shore, and watch your rising states, âImpregnable as Tigris mural pride; âWhile, like the lowly shrub, which grov'ling shades âUnmark'd the forest walk, your power at first âIn gradual progress shall in time ascend âTo match your native oak, and by the streams âOf many rivers shoot his moisten'd roots, âAnd spread on high the branches of his strength, âWide shadowing many a shore, and myriads glad âBeneath his goodly foliage. Now afar âExtatic Hope, with eye prophetic, looks âInto futurity; and you shall rise âAnother empire in the radiant west; âReflecting Albion's glory, bold and free, âThe seat of arts and commerce, the defence âOf nations wrong'd, the scourge of guilty pow'r, âSurpassing Mexico, and fam'd Peru âBy rich Potosi's flood, or diamond blaze âOf great Golconda thron'd in eastern wave. âGo! in the smiles of Providence secure âFrom slavish yoke, increase and multiply; âAnd O your better liberty maintain âAgainst these worst of enemies to man, âAbhorr'd Impiety, luxurious Guilt, âCorruption's secret canker, and the fiends âOf madd'ning Faction, who, beneath the mask âOf specious freedom, like night felons steal âTo thrall the unwary brave: despoil'd of all âTheir peace and conscience, from delusive dream âThey wake despairing; with malignant joy âThe tempters lead, and down the headlong steep âOf parricide and ruin urge their prey. âBy Heav'n conjoin'd the ties of nature bind âThe parent and his children; your descent âImplies subordination; and the pow'r âWhich props your weakness claims a meet return: âObservant of her sway, fair Albion's right âRevere as sacred: burst one smallest link âOf that eternal adamantine chain âWhich binds the golden planets to their spheres, âUnion and life, and order must dissolve, âAnd universal ruin crush the pole.â The Goddess spoke; and breathing in her sons, With gracious inspiration, high resolves, Benignant purpose, ardor, patience firm, Along the smiling floods and blooming dales, Like a young heir rejoicing to possess, With buoyant hope, some vast inheritance, The guardian Genius led their eager way. So where steep Orca's rocky front o'erhangs The northern foam, high in his airy build The royal eagle tends his lordly young With brooding wings, and marks their native fire, Their piercing eye, and pounces strong, the dread Of Scandian vultures; from his rocky fort, Now fit to rear a kingdom of their own, He drives them forth; with enterprising flight, In mutual league, on sailing vans they ride The fluid air, and o'er the feather'd tribes, The vassals of their empire, stretch their sway For many a league, and rule in distant isles. The Muse, who in her simple mirror shews Things past in brief review, omits the toil And painful struggles of their rising states; Nor will she yet her record stain with broils, And war, and moody discord; these, alas! With ten-fold horrors on a bloody stage Re-acting, claim her future funeral song, O! might her numbers suit her mournful theme, And Heaven in mercy close the scene of death, As sad remembrance blots the verse with tears. And let me charm a while the pangs of woe, In sweet oblivion, as I shift the song To happier scenes, illum'd with peace and joy. Ye venerable names! Paternal chiefs! Who fix'd the basis of your infant states With persevering toil, and gave them laws, Thou noble Calvert! Patriot Pen, long try'd In broils thrice loyal Berkely firm, and thou Immortal Rhaleigh! ill required chief, Whose soul invincible, thro' bonds and death, With Roman spirit sought the public good; O deign! from your high sphere, to lead the Muse O'er your vast empire, thron'd in civil pride Of late, and soon from the wide wasting storm To rise a glorious fabric; the review May yield your high sensations pause, and close Your wound fresh bleeding o'er your country's fate. And what a goodly region courts my song! Extensive, fertile, whose fair blooming shores, Hesperian gardens, by the sacred Nine Of old reveal'd, now to their fav'rite isle Bequeath'd, in more than blissful vision rear Their fragrant bosoms to th'enamour'd sun; While up their silver winding rivers glide The fleets of wealthy Commerce, and explore Like other Jasons Colchis golden strand; Not yielding to the fam'd PhÅnician clime, In power and merchandise; or where the floods Of Pegu and Camboia, Indian realms, Roll gold and pearl down the sparkling wave. Another Albion, daughter of the sea, And regal queen, her scepter here extends From the south sultry cape, to where the tribes Of ancient Apalach their warlike seats Maintain'd by Santee or Savannah's shores; Till on that solemn day, their regal crown With eagle plumage, in firm treaty they In Thames' hall resign'd at BRUNSWICK's feet. Their friendly tribes and Apalachian Kings To western hills retir'd, the wealthy soil In freighted navies her Sicilian stores From Ashley's tide to distant ports conveys. Contiguous, o'er the foaming brine are seen Like a slow exhalation to arise, The pleasing villages, and shady isles, Where Anglia's vestal queen of old reclaim'd Virginia's Pagan sons: They down the wave Of vast Potammoc with their quiver'd chiefs, And strange attire, their ancient seats perfum'd With aromatic herb review; or where The blooming orchards basking to the sun Unfold their purple fruitage, soon to flow In sparkling wines profuse, or where the pride Of laurel and of flow'ry poplars grace The fragrant shores, and charm the ravish'd sense Of ling'ring mariner, in grateful shade, They hold rich traffic with their silvan spoils. Hence to the north expands the ocean's bay In giant state, rejoicing in his strength, Where kindred nations in his arms repose, And tow'ring cities glitt'ring o'er the wave, With op'ning ports and fleets that hide the seas. His hundred floods circling their verdant isles, And cedar groves, and wide extended plains, Where stalk the buffalo and branching elk, Confess O Baltimore! thine ancient sway, And thine prime patriot Pen! not least in fame. But what fair province! to the solar beam Gives all her lib'ral bosom, rich, adorn'd With gifts of Ceres! her sweet rural seats, And pop'lous cities rise, her greenwood shades, And mountains: thron'd amid her sea-like floods, Which from the ocean's northern lakes descend, Which circling many an Indian tribe rejoice, To lave with swelling tides her peopl'd shores; Like Memphis' queen she sits in conscious pride, Another England, nurse of arts and arms, With num'rous navies to controul the seas; Whilst her coy Sister, in romantic view, With dales, and chrystal lakes, and mountain woods, Bold Caledonia, girt with chosen Knights, High to the north her rocky bulwark stands. Eastward, chrystalline bound, the Atlantic brine Invests the mighty region; south and west The mountains with their Indian tribes; and where The empire verges toward the freezing pole, Vast lakes, their inland seas, whence foaming burst, With thund'ring noise, adown the headlong steep, Canada's swelling tides, and to the main Receding, with collected deluge flow. Ye Pow'rs! who, thron'd above the spheres, ordain The fate of nations; who their teeming birth, Their growing strength, their tide of glory, mark With gracious eye; as once your prophet saw, In wond'rous trance, on Zion's sacred hill, The holy waters from the mystic place, The golden sanctuary of God, ascend, And round the purple altar, in their course Increasing, from the lofty portals, flow A mighty river; on whose crowding banks They quaff'd new life, and trees of every kind Yielded their fruits for food, and o'er the weak; With healing influence, spread their cooling shade: 'Twas you, ye heavenly Pow'rs! who bid the light Of radiant truth, sprung from the Sovereign Mind, To gild the Gentile shores; and, with the sun Journeying, on the benighted strangers beam Day-spring of grace and joy; and Albion sent To show'r your blessings on a promis'd land. 'Twas you assign'd them portions, nurs'd their states, Their temples rear'd, and in the charm of peace The sable natives roving bands confin'd: Bless'd your high care by the cerulean stream, With arts and increase: by the hand sustain'd Which guides the planets in their orbs, they rose As by a new creation, like the sons Of stormy Adria, or the BelgÃ¦ fam'd For toilsome perseverance. Nature's face By wondrous transmutation they subdu'd To form their varied plan: the marshy plain, Drain'd of its moisture, rose in village scenes, With flow'ry circling meads: their cedar groves And ancient oaks, a venerable shade, Gave place; and where the howling wolves did haunt In troops, and the green serpent roll'd his train, Th'industrious planter ploughs the fertile ground, And all the valley smiles with waving corn. The nymphs and silvans left their cool retreats, In grot, and shaggy hill, and wond'ring saw Strange towns usurp their native haunt, and woods Of uncouth hue and foreign harvests rise: Saw with sad eyes, prophetic of their doom, The city's turret pride, the bastion firm, The circling moat, and pensile bridge abrupt, The piled magazines of death, and dread His brazen thunders lowring o'er the dale. Or hapless exiles on the dashing beach, Aghast beheld the solid mound work on Its huge barrier to curb th'indignant tides; And the capacious port with giant arms Wide grasping to enchain the subject waves: Whilst blooming Doris, and her sea-green train, With troubled looks, beneath the trembling surge, Explore their chrystal caves, and Ocean shook With boding fears for his decreasing sway. But say, ye tuneful Sisters! ye who watch'd Their dawn of glory, till it mounted swift To its meridian clime, and on the gaze Of wond'ring nations, from its zenith beam'd Like a new star! say, from what central source This meteor drew supplies? Th'infuriate blaze Of headlong faction, like the comet's course, To fierce extremes, or as Vesuvius' rage, The world's incendiary, while intestine storm In horror reigns, dread on the midnight sky Vents his dilacerate bowels, surging fire, Nitre, and blazing mass, could never cease Such pastime, to illume a nation's fame. Nor thine illiberal hand, whose iron rod Peruvian princes quell'd, and, hapless doom! Freeborn enchain'd to dig Iberian mines, Infernal avarice! by whatever name Ador'd, could mean Oppression's task forego To build so fair a structure. On the wreck Of nations prostrate let the guilty thrones Of Turkish or of Christian tyrants rise, Founded in blood. Amidst imperious waves, Bedeck'd with trophies proud, and treasur'd store, The spoils of conquer'd provinces, again Let mighty Ecbatan, with mural pride, Far o'er the subject east her sceptre stretch, And half the world enchain in slavish yoke. From no unhallowed source their greatness grew, Nor avarice vile, nor insolence of pow'r, Nor savage war with hosts distain'd in blood, Or thron'd in spoil, the trophies of her guilt. What gave them strength and riches was the soul Of public Virtues; they, in bright patrole, From England's shores, with golden light of morn, Descending, thro' the smiling region spread Celestial influence: them the Majestic Queen Of isles, begirt with her auspicious train Of potent charm, to bless her favour'd land On gracious visit led. O'er the blue waves, That stoop'd their foaming pride, in gorgeous state Imperial, 'mid the blooming Nereid throng, With looks of high demeanor, that bespoke Her sov'reign station, in chrystalline car, She rode a marine deity. The deeps From all their caves command the scaly throng To make her homage; and the winds and waves In gratulation smooth her wat'ry way, Like Neptune's queen confess'd: a verdant wreath Of British oak her radiant tresses bound; And on her brow, enchass'd, a ruby crown Glitter'd with naval trophies; whilst afar Her red cross shield, like Jove's dread Ã¦gis, blaz'd Terrific splendors, that dismay'd the fiends Of discord, war, and rapine. Ocean's floods Obsequious on her trident sceptre wait, Ensign of wide controul; and the rough storms Which vex the main, in peaceful league combine To waft her voyage, and her robe expand Of lively azure dye, bespangled fair With glitt'ring stars, that rule the swelling seas In distant climes which own her naval sway. She came and in her fost'ring arms embrac'd, With mother's joy, the kindred climes, the face Of various nature smil'd; the rural plain, And crouding mart conceiv'd new life; the shouts Of grateful nations shook the rebounding shore, For with her went her bevy fair, the train Of guardian genii em'lous like their queen To mark their bright'ning way, and bless mankind. First, Freedom, goddess of the fearless eye, Daughter of heav'n, who with etherial grace Redeems the world from fang of guilty pow'r; At whose dread voice the proudest thrones will shake Of Turk, or Christian tyrant, and the brave Burst from their chains, reviving at the sound. Of port sublime, celestial beauty glow'd O'er all her form: full to the swelling gale Her lib'ral bosom rose, and ev'ry look Disclos'd the soul within, the gen'rous sigh For injur'd right, the lofty sentiment, The godlike aim to perfect man, the flame Of public love enliv'ning all, and thence Sov'reign disdain of slavish yoke, and keen With native sense of insult, or of wrong, That Argus jealousy with watchful eye. Conscious of worth innate, and high designs Of good to all her sons, the beam of joy And virtue's transport glow'd in ev'ry charm. Following their sacred guide the enamour'd throng Confess the guardian pow'r, while Faction fierce With discord, anarchy, and civil rage Fled the effulgence to their howling caves Of native Erebus. No portion she Had in licentious works of wild misrule, Where ruffian force and rapine fell devour The peace of injur'd nations, and the bands Of Belial's sons invade their country's right With parricide. With cordial mind she came To heal dissentions, and establish peace, To quell each selfish faction, and construct The general good on firm connected base Of civil right, and legal government. On such foundations, in her native isle, Albion, the world's proud envy, and their dread, Arose; and from her patriot Senate, where Her fires congenial blaze from soul to soul, With growing flame, to light declining times, She comes on grateful errand, to transfuse The Parent's spirit in her gen'rous Sons. And with them came, returning from the skies, Her native seat, the grave majestic form Of awful Justice, delegate of Heav'n, Whose solemn sentence, pure from passion's stain, And guardian care, the public glory builds, Bold Guilt controuls, and suff'ring Virtue cheers, And saves the nations verging to decay; 'Till on the flaming arch the sapphire throne Shall blaze, and God's eternal Kingdom reign. For this she bears th'entrusted golden scale, Pois'd by the hand of Rectitude, the sword, Ensign of pow'r supreme, her righteous doom With backward hand inflicting still, and looks Of sad commiseration for their fate; Yet from the sacred trust and gen'ral weal Inflexible, firm judgment she maintains, Tho' slow yet sure; nor can revolting Guilt Impeach the sentence, by his judging peers, As by th'internal voice of conscience past, Self-judging, self-condemn'd. O! privilege high Of Albion's sons! freeborn! long may they boast Their sacred right, nor feel the heaviest scourge, When life, and fame, and kindred, all we prize, Must bleed to glut a tyrant's hasty rage. What radiant female form from yon bright cloud Descends! her solemn garb, her incens'd blaze From golden censer, her enraptur'd eye Conversing with the skies, her roll unseal'd To public view, Religion's pow'r proclaim, As pure from violence, and low designs, And superstitious rites, with reason's beam And lib'ral soul, the genuine fruit of faith, She comes to honour God, and raise mankind: To strengthen every social tie, extend, Godlike, the sphere of charity, and truth; To give the laws new force; and bind the floods Of vice and bold impiety, to bear Celestial day to regions dark, unfold Her volume and her crimson cross, insure The precious gifts they share by doing good, And sanctify their blessings, as from hearts Flowing with gratitude the incense breath Of faith and love to Heav'n's high throne ascends. Thus came Religion; and with her combin'd In league of amity, her daughter bright, Sweet Peace, her genuine offspring, ere of yore Selfish Ambition, Pride, and worldly Love, Begot wild superstition's jarring train Of vain imaginations, forms of faith Erroneous, rites discordant, whence the plagues: Of strife, and schism, headlong zeal, and war, And bloody persecution. She, adorn'd In robes of innocence, with placid mien, And eye that beam'd benevolence, emblem meet Of peace celestial, on her errand went, To dissipate each gath'ring storm, and lay The surge of outrage: fled from guilty climes, Where Discord sounds her clarion, rousing war, With carnage oft to drench the eastern world In Turk or Christian blood, in calm recess She smiles sweet influence, height'ning ev'ry bliss By its assurance. She like brothers bound The separate states in pleasing chains of love And kindred intercourse; her brooding wings, Her olive branch, and dove-like scepter spread, And bid the land beneath her shade repose. Her meet compeer, with her the radiant dame Of elevated thought, and piercing eye, Conversing with the pole her kindred clime, Bright Science, went associate. She who burst The chains of Gothic darkness, and on minds Depress'd by ignorance pour'd her lib'ral day. Fled from the waste of war, the jarring broils Of sordid passion, to the sacred shades, Inviolate, of academic lore, Her peaceful sanctuary, she, with the Nine Harmonious maids conversing, and the soul. Of Plato, and immortal seers renown'd, In solitude, and contemplation, yields The hours to wisdom's keen research, in chace Of radiant Truth, in secret depths conceal'd, Of coy recess, till she, the brightest maid That ever shone in blooming charms, is found, Sweet solace of their toil. Heard ye the strain! From Deva's wave adown fair Albion's vale, And sacred shades, re-echoed to the ear Of Contemplation. Hark! their Minstrel wakes, By modest merit crown'd, the tuneful quires, With dulcet symphony, and leads the throng Encharm'd in moral exstacy, and takes With thrilling ravishment the willing soul. The Queen of Arts, fair daughter of the sphere, Rode with her train majestic: on her brow In bright effulgence beam'd her starry crown: With pictur'd zodiac bound, her flowing robe Shone with the hues of Iris' vivid bow: And in her hand her golden scepter sway'd With mystic charm, thro' ocean, earth, and sky: Cherish'd the sister arts, embellish'd life, The elements controul'd, wild passion's rage, A nobler task, even savage tribes subdu'd To her mild reign, and for celestial climes, With strains angelic, harmoniz'd mankind. But who is she! rob'd like some Tyrian queen, In sweeping purple stole, where meet pourtray'd, As in celestial canopy, the train Of constellations bright; the northern bands Of slow Bootes, Orion vast, and fires Of southern Argo, steer their radiant way: In sov'reign state, o'er the translucent waves, Her coral throne, thick set with pearly shell Glitters, and on her head imperial crowns. 'Tis Commerce; she who sways the circling seas In ev'ry clime, and to remotest shores Her scepter'd mace, emblem of peace, extends; Who binds the nations, by opposing floods, Or demons of ambition, pride, and war, Disjoin'd, in social intercourse, and pours Like Amalthea from her copious store, Increasing treasures, to exalt the fame Of kingdoms rais'd on opulence and pow'r. From the degenerate nations sunk in sloth, Or plung'd in guilt, where savage Mars invades, And Rapine oft her peaceful caravan, Apart retiring, on Hesperian shores, Her new recess, she holds gay residence: For with her came the founders of her reign In ancient times; dread Neptune who invests The circling globe, with Nereus and his sons, The hoary Phorcis, Belus great, and he Cerulean augur Glaucus, Triton huge, With sounding shell, who bids the ocean rest, Or blows the signal when conflicting deeps Outstorm the winds; the blooming Cretan dame, Bright Ariadne, Bacchus' spouse, and she, Far-fam'd of yore, Astarte, Tyrian queen, Who rules the tides, and Maia's winged son. Hypotades was there; who holds the winds And adverse storms in custody; to smooth The wat'ry way, fair Leda's twins, and she, Prime queen of eve, who leads the starry train, And lights the ocean's path, bright Hesper's beam. Nor were they wanting, Doris' blooming band She bore to Nereus, nymphs with dimpling smiles, And winning looks, to calm the winds and seas, While Halcyon broods upon her wat'ry couch, And the lone dame, with ghastly forms of sleep Dismay'd, surveys the main, and wishful waits Her lord's return, yet dreads his long delay. Erato prime, who combs her raven hair, While Zephyr breathes, chaste Galatea deem'd, Abhorring rage, since Acis' hapless wound, The friend of mariners; Cymothoe fleet, Who treads the foam, smooth Panope who plays Amid the Syren sisters, while they sing, With kind Cymodice, the waves to rest, And blend sweet voices with Arion's lyre. Amid her troop the pow'r of Commerce rode Sublime; around her, rang'd in circling line, Like whit'ning crescent, o'er the surging foam, Her crouding navies march'd in bright array, Hiding the sea-green wave: more num'rous far Than these who plough'd the fam'd Trinacrian seas, From Afric, or the Syrian country, fraught With rich returns; or they who from the coast Of golden Havilah, or fragrant Ind, Replete with costly merchandize, explor'd From spicy isles, the Erythrean wave. Last came bold Fortitude, with feature firm, And manly port, whose dauntless soul can brave All dangers, and all hardships bear, sustain'd, Thro' ev'ry suff'rance, by the great design, Which in his breast expands, like the firm oak, Which mocks in native pride the northern blast. Industry too, with cheerful eye, who loathes Enervate sloth, and, on his task intent, Salutes the early dawn; and honest Toil, Vig'rous, with spreading chest, and limbs embrown'd With dust and sweat, whose brawny arm supports The fabric of the state, who feeds the weak And indigent, and gives ingrateful sloth And lordly pride to riot on his spoils, In dress and luxury. From native isles Hygeia, blooming queen of health, who led Young Hymen with his jocund train, and torch Enkindling fond desire; and blushing sweet As beauty, rose full on the ravish'd eye, Hebe, like morning breath of op'ning flow'rs, When vernal zephyrs born on purple wing Brood o'er the fragrant spoil in sweet delay, Emblem of female charm and nuptial love. Such the celestial virtues in her train Associate, and with these the Albion Queen Thro' all her provinces lustration held, Diffusing gracious influence. Their approach, As when the golden planets in their spheres Combine with kindly aspect, brighten'd up The various face of Nature, and renew'd With sweet vicissitude the peopl'd shores And rural plain. Or should the Muse pursue The parent Genii, where in crouding mart, And princely cities they auspicious shed Their sovereign virtues, and thro' nations beam'd As from their central throne the genial ray She marks their noblest triumph; sees the brood Of adverse dÃ¦mons, of rapacious pow'r, Impiety, and fierce Contention quell'd, And Hydra guilt with bestial train, the fiends Of Riot, Sloth, Injustice, who bequeath To their foul race remorseful portion stamp'd With loss, and misery, and endless woe. She sees the felons shun the bless'd approach, As when Aurora gilds the bright'ning east, Nocturnal shadows fly th'etherial beam. Then like Sidonian mart proud Boston rose, With stately bulwarks round her parent waves, Riv'ling Egyptian Pharos. The vast port, Her silver crescent, in bright circle folds The fleets of commerce fraught with various stores, Her wealthy merchandise; seen on the flood Tremble her glitt'ring spires. Th'emporium fair With many a splendid dome, and crowding streets, The haunt of industry and riches, shews A marine amphitheatre afar O'er ocean radiant by the eastern ray. Nor less, her, lordly rival 'mid the pride Of swelling floods, and verdant isles, fair York Shone in Imperial state; her beauty, far, Like Solyma with lofty temples crown'd, The Indian kings adown her wand'ring wave, With annual tribute woo; while o'er the brine To Thames full wave remote her navies ride, And princely merchants court her Colchian shore. Who yonder lifts her regal tow'rs amid Cool bow'rs and fragrant shades, that Nature seems Transform'd, and Pan and bounteous Ceres choose Their urban residence: here patriot Pen His peaceful brethren fix'd, not by the arm Of barbarous war, but friendly treaties held With Indian tribes, who, from the purchas'd land Receding to their hunter grounds, the seats Of virtuous Industry, 'mid confluent streams And Sylvan scenes, and orchard's blooming pride, He rang'd like Eden's groves, and on the plan Of order and proportion, meet for trade, Bid Philadelphia, queen of cities, rise, Image of her who grac'd Chaldean plains In traffic, site, and order, e'er the floods Of impious pride and luxury o'erthrew Euphrates' glory. On that guilty shore O had the plague been stay'd! nor discord wav'd Her fury's torch, nor waste, and impious war, Fell scourge of vice, profan'd the seats of peace, Of loyalty and virtue. Oh! how fallen From thy meridian glory, like a star, Proud Atalanta! in the radiant west Enthron'd, as queen of many provinces. How desolate thy mournful cities! once The rendezvous of nations, Hark! the voice Of lamentation; war and storm besiege Her trembling gates: the virgin's piercing cry, And frantic widow's, who lament the slain, Their parents, brothers, husbands, rend the skies: While parricide, and fire, and bigot zeal Fiercer than both, kindles the desperate brand That impious gives their streets and temples fair To horrid conflagration. Hark! the shriek Of misery ascends, and dÃ¦mons shout Exulting in their ruin. Thus, when Heav'n Her flaming ministers of justice sends To humble guilt, the dread convulsion shakes The groaning earth; sulphureous lightnings dart From yawning chasm abrupt, and involv'd In one wide spreading vortex of despair, With all her shrieking myriads gulph'd in fire, Descends some proud emporium: such thy fate, Palermo, such Peruvian Lima, reft Of all your grandeur in the drear abyss. But from such scenes of horror may the Muse, Wand'ring with tears of sacred pity, turn In meet commiseration, and her theme Resume with orient rays of hope, to change The wreck of war to peace, thro' HIM who rides Serene the deep'ning tempest's wings, who calms The waves of civil discord, and constrains The wrath of man to peaceful works of praise In golden years advancing. Stretch the eye Of kindling fancy from the sultry cape Of southern Augustine, to where the main Hoarse sounding foams wide o'er the frozen coast Of Ladrador, what mighty nations rise, Of various climate, policy, and strength, Em'lous of pow'r, aspiring to be great, And each his neighbour with the rival eye Of jealousy observing, firmly bound In meet subordination by the power Who gives them life, who gave them liberty, And every gift which makes life worth possessing. How fair their cities rise! how rich in trade, And various industry, the fountain pure From pride and luxury, which feeds the strength, A nation's strength, from her increasing sons. See how with lib'ral eye, that gracious speaks Love and benevolence, in social band The guardian powers walk forth. Bright Peace extends Her olive branch, the public interest smiles Assenting league; with harmless policy Astrea lifts her righteous scale to prop On basis firm the stable state, while round Her golden chain of union, to cement The general weal, auspicious concord drew. Then rose Religion's sacred domes, and wak'd Her solemn quires: the useful arts diffus'd With Science their prime guide to great designs, Congenial influence, over all supreme, Imparting wealth, and firmness 'flam'd the soul, The sov'reign virtue, which of old blaz'd forth Like inspiration in her patriot sons, To build the Roman and the Grecian fame, The public love, which burns from heart to heart In Albion's race; which, like the fire he stole From Heav'n's high sphere, inspires congenial life Thro' the else lumpish mass; and quelling strong Each selfish wish, the mercenary view, Corruption's brood, the swelling pride of rank, Each jarring principle, on solid base Of equal life their ballanc'd pow'rs sustain'd. The crowding coasts with gratulation hail The pow'rs whose smile renews the grateful land, And woo their residence with them to dwell In bless'd affinity. In triumph they At their high festival, the Sister's crown, With honour to distinguish'd merit due, And plac'd in public eminence. For now Apart from care and business, thro' their tribes Assembling 'mid their native groves and streams In annual state, they hold autumnal feast In social joy and gladness, meet return To heav'nly Pow'rs, best incense to ascend From grateful hearts, with conscious bliss to share The gifts of Providence. Of honest front, Came Toil, with vig'rous race, in russet weed, Reaping the fields he sow'd, in Doric mirth, Sweet interval, beyond the joys of Pride, And pamper'd luxury, carousing, brief, The year is clos'd, their task renews with morn. The village, see! and rural scene is throng'd With such bold yeomanry, as once relum'd Declining Rome, now Albion's manly boast, In whose firm breasts the love of country burns, Courage sedate, disdain of servitude, And conscious pride of Liberty, who smiles Gay at the rural task. Their genial hour To bless, in blooming bevy, hand in hand, The silvan Virtues came; bright Innocence, In virgin robes begirt, and Temp'rance pure; Amid the roses of her cheeks betray'd, Unconscious of her worth, with down-cast eye, Sweet modest Merit, Peace with placid mien, Activity with sparkling eye, and Health's Fair swelling form, with harmless Pleasance gay. Amid her trooping wood nymphs Ceres came, With her own treasures crown'd, queen of the feast, In bloom of female beauty: lib'ral, round, A bounteous goddess, she her golden horn With plenty shook. Pomona, with her spoils, A fragrant tribute; Pales too was there, And chaste Euphrosyne, and faithful Love, And youthful Hymen born on purple wings, High wav'd his torch, and oft relum'd his flame, With light of radiant eyes, at dance or song: Whilst all-reclin'd beneath the cooling shade Of spreading plantain or palmettos fair, Along the margin of meand'ring streams, The Manly Throng, pleas'd with communion sweet Of social converse, blend their hearts and thoughts, In rational delight, their prime repast. Or, as meet relaxation, they unbend To jocund fancy, wit, and sportive mirth, Or quaff the mellow vintage, ev'ry eye Brightens with conscious bliss, and ev'ry cup With more than nectar'd joys o'erflows, to think Their Happiness how great and how secure. Each mountain hoar, each verdant hill begirt With native groves, as conscious of the Train Benignant, o'er their subject vallies wav'd A deep'ning fresher shade. The valleys crown'd With golden spoils of harvest, sung acclaim In rural jubilee. Along the bank Of ev'ry swelling flood or stream adorn'd With hamlets fair the Genii pass'd, and lo! The rural scene rose fairer, and the land Pour'd forth her swarming myriads, ev'ry shore Shouted for joy, and in the green-wood shade The harmless sylvans and the dryads held Their festival. So in Arcadian plains Where bards inspired sung the golden age, Descending Genii leagu'd in consort sweet With favour'd mortals, held their blissful reign Unstain'd by modern crimes. The seasons smil'd; Spontaneous, Earth her double harvests gave, And Spring eternal knit in jocund dance With blooming Ceres, and the son of Jove Their blissful choirs led on the margin green Of fam'd Eurota by Laconia's shore. In that bless'd season, from the deeps reveal'd To every eye, the ALBION GENIUS shone In dreaded Majesty, as whilom seen, The martial guardian of this fav'rite shore. His lofty head above the clouds encrown'd With triple radiance flam'd: the gath'ring storm Still as he frown'd with anger boding brow, In deeper darkness clos'd, or bursting stream'd With lightning. On his arm, with horrent blaze Of Gorgon terror, rout, and fell dismay, To hostile pow'r, th'etherial Ã¦gis rose; And in his hand, ensign of sovereign sway, The brandish'd spear of mighty Neptune shook Each hostile realm, and Ocean's distant isles. Attended by his conquering hosts he came, And dreaded navy, on the subject seas, The champion bold of freedom, to assert Each sacred right, when injur'd nations cry Like Heav'n's loud storm to shake a guilty world: From Albion's isle three ample strides he took, Beneath the fourth trembled the fluent deep, And Atalanta's coasts. Round he survey'd The happy region rich in arts and arms, And crouding nations that in peace repose Beneath his thund'ring spear, his treasure hid Like a rich diamond in the western wave. Then as he sums their various worth, the work Of lab'ring years, their civil policy, Their freedom, peace, their opulence and power, The boons of Liberty his daughter fair, With conscious pride his soul dilates, in hope More elevate he stood with lion port, Awing each distant storm, and thus began With more than mortal voice, the murmuring winds Were hush'd, and each suspended wave, the crowd Heard their great Oracle in silence rapt. âHail, kindred shores! paternal tribes, my sons, âThe dawn of mighty nations, here to found âTheir peaceful kingdoms, when the wreck of war âShall deluge all the east! In sweet recess âYour bow'ring shades, your fertile plains, and streams, âThe haunt of rural Genii, pleas'd I hail âAs in Saturnian times, from noxious change âOf a bad world remote. For you I leave âAugusta's walls, where fate imperial rule âOrdains, and from her central throne infolds âYou in the gentlest circle of her sway. âWith you, on friendly visit, would unbend âFrom public cares, and o'er your silvan seats, âYour marts of commerce, or your cities fair, âWand'ring, in gay lustration, would solace âMine anxious thoughts, nor leave your gen'rous sons âUncounsel'd to abide the gath'ring storm. âFor, in the roll of destiny, I mark'd âAs late the brazen archives I survey'd, âEmblazon'd with your fate, in brightest noon âYour radiant years eclips'd, with lurid gloom, âAnd tempest ruinous, which threats to shake âYour states to desolation, should High Grace âOf Heav'n reject you, and the fiends of guilt âO'er right, and loyalty, and peace prevail, âIn foul conspiracy. Long have you shar'd âA rich inheritance, in all the bliss âPropitious Albion on her sons bestows, âHer youngest offspring, yet not least in love, âAs round your farthest shores her fost'ring arms, âAnd seven-fold shield, your prime defence, she rais'd, âCherish'd your helpless infancy, and rear'd âYour rising youth to full maturity âOf strength and glory, and your urgent need âIn adverse times to aid, her patriot's toil, âHer lib'ral treasures, and her richest blood âHas flow'd, when gen'rous Halket, fearless Howe, âAnd Wolfe, in death victorious, greatly gave âTheir valiant lives, the ransom of your weal: âSo the fam'd bird of wilderness, replete âWith strong sensations, o'er her callow young, âHid in the barren solitude, and pierc'd âWith clamant want, hangs anxious, nor delays âTo rear her offspring with her streaming blood. âO! give not then your easy faith betray'd âTo sly Insinuation's guileful tongue: âNor rashly judge, by long experience try'd, âYour faithful Friend. Howe'er by vaunted names âVarnish'd, or plausible pretence, suspect âThe cause of freedom, as an impious fraud, âWhen selfish avarice, ambition, pride, âHatred of righteous government, or worse âLicentious outrage, kindle up the flames âOf jealousy and discord; league to loose âEach sacred bond, and feed with airy dreams âThe cred'lous, of new republic rais'd âFirm on its own foundations. Can the band âOf Albion Patriots, freedom's Senate, stain âHer annals with oppression! Or, ordain'd âHer guardians, wound her int'rest in her sons! âCan HE, who in the Public Father veils âWith grace imperial dignity, and reigns âO'er mighty nations, in their loyal hearts, âBy love, and gratitude, not pow'r subdu'd, âWHO in their bliss rejoices, and their woe âFeels with paternal sympathy, can HE âStoop from his golden sphere! and soil the fame âOf patriot dignity, by ignoble acts âOf tyrant usurpation! Sooner shall âHyperion, wand'ring, his etherial path âForsake, and radiant planets quench their fires. âSole for your good HE reigns. The sacred laws âWhich bind the subject people, jointly curb âThe legislative pow'rs, as fram'd for all, âIn triple league; what madness to dissolve âThis sacred bond of loyalty and peace! âI see the hurrying fates come on, the times âOf desolation: Sacrilege invades âThe seats of Concord, and o'erturns her throne. âIn these bad days, see! proud Seduction charms âThe cred'lous multitude, with false detail âOf native freedom injur'd, native claim âOf empire separate. The swelling theme, âBandy'd by upstart patriots, factious priests, âWho Judas-like again the PRINCE of PEACE, âIn his deluded ruin'd Flock betray, âFor the same paltry bribe, the golden dream âOf guilty eminence, the price of blood, âShall rouse a popular phrenzy, and withdraw âFrom just allegiance myriads. Mark, my sons! âThis faithful warning ere too late, nor bar âAgainst yourselves sweet Mercy's gates. The rights, âThe glorious freedom of unnumber'd tribes âThat croud fam'd Albion's empire, safely rest âIn their chief asylum, her Senate, where âThe soul of freedom, justice, public love, âFertile in good, and with a parent's care, âMost tender of the children's right, delights âTo fix her residence, and blazing full âIn steady Patriots, like the fervour bold âOf Roman Tully, or of Cato, flows âFrom kindred hearts that urge their country's good, âAnd to this central point their constant zeal âTurning, as faithful magnet seeks the pole. âHere found on Native Base your Native Rights âIn filial confidence, and scorn the lure âOf Siren traitors, who with plausive tale âOf heav'n-born liberty profan'd, would hide âTheir private indignation, lust of pow'r, âThe woes of anarchy, and ruffian war, âAnd likest Stygian fiends, from blissful state âSeduc'd, would tempt you down the giddy steep âTo yawning gulphs of ruin and despair.â The Genius spoke, and o'er the fav'rite clime, With look benign, his shady Ã¦gis spread, Their shield of safety; while his glitt'ring spear, And vollied thunder rattling from his arm, Dispell'd the storm, shook ev'ry adverse shore, And Discord pierc'd with terror and dismay.
