      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I., VOL. II. ODES OF ANACREON. JUVENILE POEMS. POEMS RELATING TO AMERICA. JUVENILE POEMS. TO JOSEPH ATKINSON, ESQ. FRAGMENTS OF COLLEGE EXERCISES. Nobilitas sola est atque unica virtus. Juv. Mark those proud boasters of a splendid line, Like gilded ruins, mouldering while they shine, How heavy sits that weight of alien show, Like martial helm upon an infant's brow; Those borrow'd splendours, whose contrasting light Throws back the native shades in deeper night. Ask the proud train who glory's shade pursue, Where are the arts by which that glory grew? The genuine virtues that with eagle-gaze Sought young Renown in all her orient blaze! Where is the heart by chymic truth refin'd, Th' exploring soul, whose eye had read mankind? Where are the links that twin'd, with heav'nly art, His country's interest round the patriot's heart? [Is there no call, no consecrating cause] Justum bellum quibus necessarium, et pia arma quibus nulla nisi in armis relinquitur spes. —Livy. Is there no call, no consecrating cause, Approv'd by Heav'n, ordain'd by nature's laws, Where justice flies the herald of our way, And truth's pure beams upon the banners play? Yes, there's a call sweet as an angel's breath To slumb'ring babes, or innocence in death; And urgent as the tongue of Heav'n within, When the mind's balance trembles upon sin. Oh! 'tis our country's voice, whose claim should meet An echo in the soul's most deep retreat; Along the heart's responding chords should run, Nor let a tone there vibrate—but the one! VARIETY. Ask what prevailing, pleasing power Allures the sportive, wandering bee To roam, untired, from flower to flower, He'll tell you, 'tis variety. Look Nature round, her features trace, Her seasons, all her changes see; And own, upon Creation's face, The greatest charm's variety. For me, ye gracious powers above! Still let me roam, unfix'd and free; In all things,—but the nymph I love, I'll change, and taste variety. But, Patty, not a world of charms Could e'er estrange my heart from thee;— No, let me ever seek those arms, There still I'll find variety. TO A BOY, WITH A WATCH. WRITTEN FOR A FRIEND. Is it not sweet, beloved youth, To rove through Erudition's bowers, And cull the golden fruits of truth, And gather Fancy's brilliant flowers? And is it not more sweet than this, To feel thy parents' hearts approving, And pay them back in sums of bliss The dear, the endless debt of loving? It must be so to thee, my youth; With this idea toil is lighter; This sweetens all the fruits of truth, And makes the flowers of fancy brighter. The little gift we send thee, boy, May sometimes teach thy soul to ponder, If indolence or siren joy Should ever tempt that soul to wander. 'Twill tell thee that the winged day Can ne'er be chain'd by man's endeavour; That life and time shall fade away, While heav'n and virtue bloom for ever! SONG. [If I swear by that eye, you'll allow] If I swear by that eye, you'll allow, Its look is so shifting and new, That the oath I might take on it now The very next glance would undo. Those babies that nestle so sly Such thousands of arrows have got, That an oath, on the glance of an eye Such as yours, may be off in a shot. Should I swear by the dew on your lip, Though each moment the treasure renews, If my constancy wishes to trip, I may kiss off the oath when I choose. Or a sigh may disperse from that flow'r Both the dew and the oath that are there; And I'd make a new vow ev'ry hour, To lose them so sweetly in air. But clear up the heav'n of your brow, Nor fancy my faith is a feather; On my heart I will pledge you my vow, And they both must be broken together! TO ? [Remember him thou leav'st behind] Remember him thou leav'st behind, Whose heart is warmly bound to thee, Close as the tend'rest links can bind A heart as warm as heart can be. Oh! I had long in freedom rov'd, Though many seem'd my soul to share; 'Twas passion when I thought I lov'd, 'Twas fancy when I thought them fair. Ev'n she, my muse's early theme, Beguil'd me only while she warm'd; 'Twas young desire that fed the dream, And reason broke what passion form'd. But thou—ah! better had it been If I had still in freedom rov'd, If I had ne'er thy beauties seen, For then I never should have lov'd. Then all the pain which lovers feel Had never to this heart been known; But then, the joys that lovers steal, Should they have ever been my own? Oh! trust me, when I swear thee this, Dearest! the pain of loving thee, The very pain is sweeter bliss Than passion's wildest ecstasy. That little cage I would not part, In which my soul is prison'd now, For the most light and winged heart That wantons on the passing vow. Still, my belov'd! still keep in mind, However far remov'd from me, That there is one thou leav'st behind, Whose heart respires for only thee! And though ungenial ties have bound Thy fate unto another's care, That arm, which clasps thy bosom round, Cannot confine the heart that's there. No, no! that heart is only mine By ties all other ties above, For I have wed it at a shrine Where we have had no priest but Love. SONG. [When Time, who steals our years away] When Time, who steals our years away, Shall steal our pleasures too, The mem'ry of the past will stay, And half our joys renew. Then, Julia, when thy beauty's flow'r Shall feel the wintry air, Remembrance will recall the hour When thou alone wert fair. Then talk no more of future gloom; Our joys shall always last; For Hope shall brighten days to come, And Mem'ry gild the past. Come, Chloe, fill the genial bowl, I drink to Love and thee: Thou never canst decay in soul, Thou'lt still be young for me. And as thy lips the tear-drop chase, Which on my cheek they find, So hope shall steal away the trace That sorrow leaves behind. Then fill the bowl—away with gloom! Our joys shall always last; For Hope shall brighten days to come, And Mem'ry gild the past. But mark, at thought of future years When love shall lose its soul, My Chloe drops her timid tears, They mingle with my bowl. How like this bowl of wine, my fair, Our loving life shall fleet; Though tears may sometimes mingle there, The draught will still be sweet. Then fill the cup—away with gloom! Our joys shall always last; For Hope will brighten days to come, And Mem'ry gild the past. SONG. [Have you not seen the timid tear] Have you not seen the timid tear, Steal trembling from mine eye? Have you not mark'd the flush of fear, Or caught the murmur'd sigh? And can you think my love is chill, Nor fix'd on you alone? And can you rend, by doubting still, A heart so much your own? To you my soul's affections move, Devoutly, warmly true; My life has been a task of love, One long, long thought of you. If all your tender faith be o'er, If still my truth you'll try; Alas, I know but one proof more— I'll bless your name, and die! REUBEN AND ROSE. A TALE OF ROMANCE. The darkness that hung upon Willumberg's walls Had long been remember'd with awe and dismay; For years not a sunbeam had play'd in its halls, And it seem'd as shut out from the regions of day. Though the valleys were brighten'd by many a beam, Yet none could the woods of that castle illume; And the lightning, which flash'd on the neighbouring stream, Flew back, as if fearing to enter the gloom! “Oh! when shall this horrible darkness disperse!” Said Willumberg's lord to the Seer of the Cave;— “It can never dispel,” said the wizard of verse, “Till the bright star of chivalry sinks in the wave!” And who was the bright star of chivalry then? Who could be but Reuben, the flow'r of the age? For Reuben was first in the combat of men, Though Youth had scarce written his name on her page. For Willumberg's daughter his young heart had beat,— For Rose, who was bright as the spirit of dawn, When with wand dropping diamonds, and silvery feet, It walks o'er the flow'rs of the mountain and lawn. Must Rose, then, from Reuben so fatally sever? Sad, sad were the words of the Seer of the Cave, That darkness should cover that castle for ever, Or Reuben be sunk in the merciless wave! To the wizard she flew, saying, “Tell me, oh, tell! Shall my Reuben no more be restor'd to my eyes?” “Yes, yes—when a spirit shall toll the great bell Of the mouldering abbey, your Reuben shall rise!” Twice, thrice he repeated “Your Reuben shall rise!” And Rose felt a moment's release from her pain; And wip'd, while she listen'd, the tears from her eyes, And hop'd she might yet see her hero again. That hero could smile at the terrors of death, When he felt that he died for the sire of his Rose; To the Oder he flew, and there, plunging beneath, In the depth of the billows soon found his repose.— How strangely the order of destiny falls!— Not long in the waters the warrior lay, When a sunbeam was seen to glance over the walls, And the castle of Willumberg bask'd in the ray! All, all but the soul of the maid was in light, There sorrow and terror lay gloomy and blank: Two days did she wander, and all the long night, In quest of her love, on the wide river's bank. Oft, oft did she pause for the toll of the bell, And heard but the breathings of night in the air; Long, long did she gaze on the watery swell, And saw but the foam of the white billow there. And often as midnight its veil would undraw, As she look'd at the light of the moon in the stream, She thought 'twas his helmet of silver she saw, As the curl of the surge glitter'd high in the beam. And now the third night was begemming the sky; Poor Rose, on the cold dewy margent reclin'd, There wept till the tear almost froze in her eye, When—hark!—'twas the bell that came deep in the wind! She startled, and saw, through the glimmering shade, A form o'er the waters in majesty glide; She knew 'twas her love, though his cheek was decay'd, And his helmet of silver was wash'd by the tide. Was this what the Seer of the Cave had foretold?— Dim, dim through the phantom the moon shot a gleam; 'Twas Reuben, but, ah! he was deathly and cold, And fleeted away like the spell of a dream! Twice, thrice did he rise, and as often she thought From the bank to embrace him, but vain her endeavour! Then, plunging beneath, at a billow she caught, And sunk to repose on its bosom for ever! DID NOT. 'Twas a new feeling—something more Than we had dared to own before, Which then we hid not; We saw it in each other's eye, And wish'd, in every half-breath'd sigh, To speak, but did not. She felt my lips' impassion'd touch— 'Twas the first time I dared so much, And yet she chid not; But whisper'd o'er my burning brow, “Oh! do you doubt I love you now?” Sweet soul! I did not. Warmly I felt her bosom thrill, I press'd it closer, closer still, Though gently bid not; Till—oh! the world hath seldom heard Of lovers, who so nearly err'd, And yet, who did not. TO ? [That wrinkle, when first I espied it] That wrinkle, when first I espied it, At once put my heart out of pain; Till the eye, that was glowing beside it, Disturb'd my ideas again. Thou art just in the twilight at present, When woman's declension begins; When, fading from all that is pleasant, She bids a good night to her sins. Yet thou still art so lovely to me, I would sooner, my exquisite mother! Repose in the sunset of thee, Than bask in the noon of another. TO MRS. ? ON SOME CALUMNIES AGAINST HER CHARACTER. Is not thy mind a gentle mind? Is not that heart a heart refin'd? Hast thou not every gentle grace, We love in woman's mind and face? And, oh! art thou a shrine for Sin To hold her hateful worship in? No, no, be happy—dry that tear— Though some thy heart hath harbour'd near, May now repay its love with blame; Though man, who ought to shield thy fame, Ungenerous man, be first to shun thee; Though all the world look cold upon thee, Yet shall thy pureness keep thee still Unharm'd by that surrounding chill; Like the famed drop, in crystal found, This alludes to a curious gem, upon which Claudian has left us some very elaborate epigrams. It was a drop of pure water enclosed within a piece of crystal. See Claudian. Epigram. “de Crystallo cui aqua inerat.” Addison mentions a curiosity of this kind at Milan; and adds, “It is such a rarity as this that I saw at Vendome in France, which they there pretend is a tear that our Saviour shed over Lazarus, and was gathered up by an angel, who put it into a little crystal vial, and made a present of it to Mary Magdalen.” —Addison's Remarks on several Parts of Italy. Floating, while all was froz'n around,— Unchill'd, unchanging shalt thou be, Safe in thy own sweet purity. ANACREONTIC. [Press the grape, and let it pour] ? in lachrymas verterat omne merum. Tib. lib. i. eleg. 5. Press the grape, and let it pour Around the board its purple show'r; And, while the drops my goblet steep, I'll think in woe the clusters weep. Weep on, weep on, my pouting vine! Heav'n grant no tears, but tears of wine. Weep on; and, as thy sorrows flow, I'll taste the luxury of woe. TO ? [When I lov'd you, I can't but allow] When I lov'd you, I can't but allow I had many an exquisite minute; But the scorn that I feel for you now Hath even more luxury in it. Thus, whether we're on or we're off, Some witchery seems to await you; To love you was pleasant enough, And, oh! 'tis delicious to hate you! TO JULIA. IN ALLUSION TO SOME ILLIBERAL CRITICISMS. Why, let the stingless critic chide With all that fume of vacant pride Which mantles o'er the pedant fool, Like vapour on a stagnant pool. Oh! if the song, to feeling true, Can please th' elect, the sacred few, Whose souls, by Taste and Nature taught, Thrill with the genuine pulse of thought— If some fond feeling maid like thee, The warm-ey'd child of Sympathy, Shall say, while o'er my simple theme She languishes in Passion's dream, “He was, indeed, a tender soul— “No critic law, no chill control, “Should ever freeze, by timid art, “The flowings of so fond a heart!” Yes, soul of Nature! soul of Love! That, hov'ring like a snow-wing'd dove, Breath'd o'er my cradle warblings wild, And hail'd me Passion's warmest child,— Grant me the tear from Beauty's eye, From Feeling's breast the votive sigh; Oh! let my song, my mem'ry, find A shrine within the tender mind; And I will smile when critics chide, And I will scorn the fume of pride Which mantles o'er the pedant fool, Like vapour round some stagnant pool! TO JULIA. Mock me no more with Love's beguiling dream, A dream, I find, illusory as sweet: One smile of friendship, nay, of cold esteem, Far dearer were than passion's bland deceit! I've heard you oft eternal truth declare; Your heart was only mine, I once believ'd. Ah! shall I say that all your vows were air? And must I say, my hopes were all deceiv'd? Vow, then, no longer that our souls are twin'd, That all our joys are felt with mutual zeal; Julia!—'tis pity, pity makes you kind; You know I love, and you would seem to feel. But shall I still go seek within those arms A joy in which affection takes no part? No, no, farewell! you give me but your charms, When I had fondly thought you gave your heart. THE SHRINE. TO ? My fates had destin'd me to rove A long, long pilgrimage of love; And many an altar on my way Has lur'd my pious steps to stay; For, if the saint was young and fair, I turn'd and sung my vespers there. This, from a youthful pilgrim's fire, Is what your pretty saints require: To pass, nor tell a single bead, With them would be profane indeed! But, trust me, all this young devotion Was but to keep my zeal in motion; And, ev'ry humbler altar past, I now have reach'd the shrine at last! TO A LADY, WITH SOME MANUSCRIPT POEMS. ON LEAVING THE COUNTRY. When, casting many a look behind, I leave the friends I cherish here— Perchance some other friends to find, But surely finding none so dear— Haply the little simple page, Which votive thus I've trac'd for thee, May now and then a look engage, And steal one moment's thought for me. But, oh! in pity let not those Whose hearts are not of gentle mould, Let not the eye that seldom flows With feeling's tear, my song behold. For, trust me, they who never melt With pity, never melt with love; And such will frown at all I've felt, And all my loving lays reprove. But if, perhaps, some gentler mind, Which rather loves to praise than blame, Should in my page an interest find, And linger kindly on my name; Tell him—or, oh! if, gentler still, By female lips my name be blest: For, where do all affections thrill So sweetly as in woman's breast?— Tell her, that he whose loving themes Her eye indulgent wanders o'er, Could sometimes wake from idle dreams, And bolder flights of fancy soar; That Glory oft would claim the lay, And Friendship oft his numbers move; But whisper then, that, “sooth to say, “His sweetest song was giv'n to Love!” TO JULIA. Though Fate, my girl, may bid us part, Our souls it cannot, shall not sever; The heart will seek its kindred heart, And cling to it as close as ever. But must we, must we part indeed? Is all our dream of rapture over? And does not Julia's bosom bleed To leave so dear, so fond a lover? Does she too mourn?—Perhaps she may; Perhaps she mourns our bliss so fleeting: But why is Julia's eye so gay, If Julia's heart like mine is beating? I oft have lov'd that sunny glow Of gladness in her blue eye gleaming— But can the bosom bleed with woe, While joy is in the glances beaming? No, no!—Yet, love, I will not chide; Although your heart were fond of roving, Nor that, nor all the world beside Could keep your faithful boy from loving. You'll soon be distant from his eye, And, with you, all that's worth possessing. Oh! then it will be sweet to die, When life has lost its only blessing! TO ? [Sweet lady, look not thus again] Sweet lady, look not thus again: Those bright deluding smiles recall A maid remember'd now with pain, Who was my love, my life, my all! Oh! while this heart bewilder'd took Sweet poison from her thrilling eye, Thus would she smile, and lisp, and look, And I would hear, and gaze, and sigh! Yes, I did love her—wildly love— She was her sex's best deceiver! And oft she swore she'd never rove— And I was destin'd to believe her! Then, lady, do not wear the smile Of one whose smile could thus betray; Alas! I think the lovely wile Again could steal my heart away. For, when those spells that charm'd my mind, On lips so pure as thine I see, I fear the heart which she resign'd Will err again, and fly to thee! NATURE'S LABELS. A FRAGMENT. In vain we fondly strive to trace The soul's reflection in the face; In vain we dwell on lines and crosses, Crooked mouth, or short proboscis; Boobies have look'd as wise and bright As Plato or the Stagirite: And many a sage and learned skull Has peep'd through windows dark and dull. Since then, though art do all it can, We ne'er can reach the inward man, Nor (howsoe'er “learn'd Thebans” doubt) The inward woman, from without, Methinks 'twere well if Nature could (And Nature could, if Nature would) Some pithy, short descriptions write, On tablets large, in black and white, Which she might hang about our throttles, Like labels upon physic-bottles; And where all men might read—but stay— As dialectic sages say, The argument most apt and ample For common use is the example. For instance, then, if Nature's care Had not portray'd, in lines so fair, The inward soul of Lucy L?nd?n, This is the label she'd have pinn'd on. LABEL FIRST. Within this form there lies enshrin'd The purest, brightest gem of mind. Though Feeling's hand may sometimes throw Upon its charms the shade of woe, The lustre of the gem, when veil'd, Shall be but mellow'd, not conceal'd. Now, sirs, imagine, if you're able, That Nature wrote a second label, They're her own words—at least suppose so— And boldly pin it on Pomposo. LABEL SECOND. When I compos'd the fustian brain Of this redoubted Captain Vain, I had at hand but few ingredients, And so was forc'd to use expedients. I put therein some small discerning, A grain of sense, a grain of learning; And when I saw the void behind, I fill'd it up with—froth and wind! TO JULIA. ON HER BIRTHDAY. When Time was entwining the garland of years, Which to crown my beloved was given, Though some of the leaves might be sullied with tears, Yet the flow'rs were all gather'd in heaven. And long may this garland be sweet to the eye, May its verdure for ever be new; Young Love shall enrich it with many a sigh, And Sympathy nurse it with dew. A REFLECTION AT SEA. See how, beneath the moonbeam's smile, Yon little billow heaves its breast, And foams and sparkles for awhile,— Then murmuring subsides to rest. Thus man, the sport of bliss and care, Rises on time's eventful sea; And, having swell'd a moment there, Thus melts into eternity! CLORIS AND FANNY. Cloris! if I were Persia's king, I'd make my graceful queen of thee; While Fanny, wild and artless thing, Should but thy humble handmaid be. There is but one objection in it— That, verily, I'm much afraid I should, in some unlucky minute, Forsake the mistress for the maid. THE SHIELD. Say, did you not hear a voice of death! And did you not mark the paly form Which rode on the silvery mist of the heath, And sung a ghostly dirge in the storm? Was it the wailing bird of the gloom, That shrieks on the house of woe all night? Or a shivering fiend that flew to a tomb, To howl and to feed till the glance of light? 'Twas not the death-bird's cry from the wood, Nor shivering fiend that hung on the blast; 'Twas the shade of Helderic—man of blood— It screams for the guilt of days that are past. See, how the red, red lightning strays, And scares the gliding ghosts of the heath! Now on the leafless yew it plays, Where hangs the shield of this son of death. That shield is blushing with murderous stains; Long has it hung from the cold yew's spray; It is blown by storms and wash'd by rains, But neither can take the blood away! Oft by that yew, on the blasted field, Demons dance to the red moon's light; While the damp boughs creak, and the swinging shield Sings to the raving spirit of night! TO JULIA, WEEPING. Oh! if your tears are giv'n to care, If real woe disturbs your peace, Come to my bosom, weeping fair! And I will bid your weeping cease. But if with Fancy's vision'd fears, With dreams of woe your bosom thrill; You look so lovely in your tears, That I must bid you drop them still. DREAMS. TO ? In slumber, I prithee how is it That souls are oft taking the air, And paying each other a visit, While bodies are heaven knows where? Last night, 'tis in vain to deny it, Your Soul took a fancy to roam, For I heard her, on tiptoe so quiet, Come ask, whether mine was at home. And mine let her in with delight, And they talk'd and they laugh'd the time through; For, when souls come together at night, There is no saying what they mayn't do! And your little Soul, heaven bless her! Had much to complain and to say, Of how sadly you wrong and oppress her By keeping her prison'd all day. “If I happen,” said she, “but to steal “For a peep now and then to her eye, “Or, to quiet the fever I feel, “Just venture abroad on a sigh; “In an instant she frightens me in “With some phantom of prudence or terror, “For fear I should stray into sin, “Or, what is still worse, into error! “So, instead of displaying my graces, “By daylight, in language and mien, “I am shut up in corners and places, “Where truly I blush to be seen!” Upon hearing this piteous confession, My Soul, looking tenderly at her, Declar'd, as for grace and discretion, He did not know much of the matter; “But, to-morrow, sweet Spirit!” he said, “Be at home after midnight, and then “I will come when your lady's in bed, “And we'll talk o'er the subject again.” So she whisper'd a word in his ear, I suppose to her door to direct him, And, just after midnight, my dear, Your polite little Soul may expect him. TO ROSA. WRITTEN DURING ILLNESS. The wisest soul, by anguish torn, Will soon unlearn the lore it knew; And when the shrining casket's worn, The gem within will tarnish too. But love's an essence of the soul, Which sinks not with this chain of clay; Which throbs beyond the chill control Of with'ring pain or pale decay. And surely, when the touch of Death Dissolves the spirit's earthly ties, Love still attends th' immortal breath, And makes it purer for the skies! Oh Rosa, when, to seek its sphere, My soul shall leave this orb of men, That love which form'd its treasure here, Shall be its best of treasures then! And as, in fabled dreams of old, Some air-born genius, child of time, Presided o'er each star that roll'd, And track'd it through its path sublime; So thou, fair planet, not unled, Shalt through thy mortal orbit stray; Thy lover's shade, to thee still wed, Shall linger round thy earthly way. Let other spirits range the sky, And play around each starry gem; I'll bask beneath that lucid eye, Nor envy worlds of suns to them. And when that heart shall cease to beat, And when that breath at length is free, Then, Rosa, soul to soul we'll meet, And mingle to eternity! SONG. [The wreath you wove, the wreath you wove] The wreath you wove, the wreath you wove Is fair—but oh, how fair, If Pity's hand had stol'n from Love One leaf to mingle there! If every rose with gold were tied, Did gems for dewdrops fall, One faded leaf where Love had sigh'd Were sweetly worth them all. The wreath you wove, the wreath you wove Our emblem well may be; Its bloom is yours, but hopeless Love Must keep its tears for me. THE SALE OF LOVES. I dreamt that, in the Paphian groves, My nets by moonlight laying, I caught a flight of wanton Loves, Among the rose-beds playing. Some just had left their silv'ry shell, While some were full in feather; So pretty a lot of Loves to sell, Were never yet strung together. Come buy my Loves, Come buy my Loves, Ye dames and rose-lipp'd misses!— They're new and bright, The cost is light, For the coin of this isle is kisses. First Cloris came, with looks sedate, The coin on her lips was ready; “I buy,” quoth she, “my Love by weight, “Full grown, if you please, and steady.” “Let mine be light,” said Fanny, “pray— “Such lasting toys undo one; “A light little Love that will last to day,— “To-morrow I'll sport a new one.” Come buy my Loves, Come buy my Loves, Ye dames and rose-lipp'd misses!— There's some will keep, Some light and cheap, At from ten to twenty kisses. The learned Prue took a pert young thing, To divert her virgin Muse with, And pluck sometimes a quill from his wing, To indite her billet-doux with. Poor Cloe would give for a well-fledg'd pair Her only eye, if you'd ask it; And Tabitha begg'd, old toothless fair, For the youngest Love in the basket. Come buy my Loves, &amp;c. &amp;c. But one was left, when Susan came, One worth them all together; At sight of her dear looks of shame, He smiled, and pruned his feather. She wish'd the boy—'twas more than whim— Her looks, her sighs betray'd it; But kisses were not enough for him, I ask'd a heart, and she paid it! Good-by, my Loves, Good-by, my Loves, 'Twould make you smile to've seen us First trade for this Sweet child of bliss, And then nurse the boy between us. TO ? [The world had just begun to steal] The world had just begun to steal Each hope that led me lightly on; I felt not, as I us'd to feel, And life grew dark and love was gone. No eye to mingle sorrow's tear, No lip to mingle pleasure's breath, No circling arms to draw me near— 'Twas gloomy, and I wish'd for death. But when I saw that gentle eye, Oh! something seem'd to tell me then. That I was yet too young to die, And hope and bliss might bloom again. With every gentle smile that crost Your kindling cheek, you lighted home Some feeling, which my heart had lost, And peace, which far had learn'd to roam. 'Twas then indeed so sweet to live, Hope look'd so new and Love so kind, That, though I mourn, I yet forgive The ruin they have left behind. I could have lov'd you—oh, so well!— The dream, that wishing boyhood knows, Is but a bright, beguiling spell, That only lives while passion glows: But, when this early flush declines, When the heart's sunny morning fleets, You know not then how close it twines Round the first kindred soul it meets. Yes, yes, I could have lov'd, as one Who, while his youth's enchantments fall, Finds something dear to rest upon, Which pays him for the loss of all. TO ? [Never mind how the pedagogue proses] Never mind how the pedagogue proses, You want not antiquity's stamp; A lip, that such fragrance discloses, Oh! never should smell of the lamp. Old Cloe, whose withering kiss Hath long set the Loves at defiance, Now, done with the science of bliss, May take to the blisses of science. But for you to be buried in books— Ah, Fanny, they're pitiful sages, Who could not in one of your looks Read more than in millions of pages. Astronomy finds in those eyes Better light than she studies above; And Music would borrow your sighs As the melody fittest for Love. Your Arithmetic only can trip If to count your own charms you endeavour; And Eloquence glows on your lip When you swear, that you'll love me for ever. Thus you see, what a brilliant alliance Of arts is assembled in you;— A course of more exquisite science Man never need wish to pursue. And, oh!—if a Fellow like me May confer a diploma of hearts, With my lip thus I seal your degree, My divine little Mistress of Arts! ON THE DEATH OF A LADY. Sweet spirit! if thy airy sleep Nor sees my tears nor hears my sighs, Then will I weep, in anguish weep, Till the last heart's drop fills mine eyes. But if thy sainted soul can feel, And mingles in our misery; Then, then my breaking heart I'll seal— Thou shalt not hear one sigh from me. The beam of morn was on the stream, But sullen clouds the day deform: Like thee was that young, orient beam, Like death, alas, that sullen storm! Thou wert not form'd for living here, So link'd thy soul was with the sky; Yet, ah, we held thee all so dear, We thought thou wert not form'd to die. INCONSTANCY. And do I then wonder that Julia deceives me, When surely there's nothing in nature more common? She vows to be true, and while vowing she leaves me— And could I expect any more from a woman? Oh, woman! your heart is a pitiful treasure; And Mahomet's doctrine was not too severe, When he held that you were but materials of pleasure, And reason and thinking were out of your sphere. By your heart, when the fond sighing lover can win it, He thinks that an age of anxiety's paid; But, oh, while he's blest, let him die at the minute— If he live but a day, he'll be surely betray'd. THE NATAL GENIUS. A DREAM. TO ? THE MORNING OF HER BIRTHDAY. In witching slumbers of the night, I dreamt I was the airy sprite That on thy natal moment smil'd; And thought I wafted on my wing Those flow'rs which in Elysium spring, To crown my lovely mortal child. With olive-branch I bound thy head, Heart's ease along thy path I shed, Which was to bloom through all thy years; Nor yet did I forget to bind Love's roses, with his myrtle twin'd, And dew'd by sympathetic tears. Such was the wild but precious boon Which Fancy, at her magic noon, Bade me to Nona's image pay; And were it thus my fate to be Thy little guardian deity, How blest around thy steps I'd play! Thy life should glide in peace along, Calm as some lonely shepherd's song That's heard at distance in the grove; No cloud should ever dim thy sky, No thorns along thy pathway lie, But all be beauty, peace, and love. Indulgent Time should never bring To thee one blight upon his wing, So gently o'er thy brow he'd fly; And death itself should but be felt Like that of daybeams, when they melt, Bright to the last, in evening's sky! ELEGIAC STANZAS, SUPPOSED TO BE WRITTEN BY JULIA, ON THE DEATH OF HER BROTHER. Though sorrow long has worn my heart; Though every day I've counted o'er Hath brought a new and quick'ning smart To wounds that rankled fresh before; Though in my earliest life bereft Of tender links by nature tied; Though hope deceiv'd, and pleasure left; Though friends betray'd and foes belied; I still had hopes—for hope will stay After the sunset of delight; So like the star which ushers day, We scarce can think it heralds night!— I hop'd that, after all its strife, My weary heart at length should rest, And, fainting from the waves of life, Find harbour in a brother's breast. That brother's breast was warm with truth, Was bright with honour's purest ray; He was the dearest, gentlest youth— Ah, why then was he torn away? He should have stay'd, have linger'd here To soothe his Julia's every woe; He should have chas'd each bitter tear, And not have caus'd those tears to flow. We saw within his soul expand The fruits of genius, nurs'd by taste; While Science, with a fost'ring hand, Upon his brow her chaplet plac'd. We saw, by bright degrees, his mind Grow rich in all that makes men dear;— Enlighten'd, social, and refin'd, In friendship firm, in love sincere. Such was the youth we lov'd so well, And such the hopes that fate denied;— We lov'd, but ah! could scarcely tell How deep, how dearly, till he died! Close as the fondest links could strain, Twin'd with my very heart he grew; And by that fate which breaks the chain, The heart is almost broken too. TO THE LARGE AND BEAUTIFUL MISS ? IN ALLUSION TO SOME PARTNERSHIP IN A LOTTERY SHARE. IMPROMPTU. —Ego pars ? Virg. In wedlock a species of lottery lies, Where in blanks and in prizes we deal; But how comes it that you, such a capital prize, Should so long have remain'd in the wheel? If ever, by Fortune's indulgent decree, To me such a ticket should roll, A sixteenth, Heav'n knows! were sufficient for me; For what could I do with the whole? A DREAM. I thought this heart enkindled lay On Cupid's burning shrine: I thought he stole thy heart away, And plac'd it near to mine. I saw thy heart begin to melt, Like ice before the sun; Till both a glow congenial felt, And mingled into one! TO ? [With all my soul, then, let us part] With all my soul, then, let us part, Since both are anxious to be free; And I will send you home your heart, If you will send back mine to me. We've had some happy hours together, But joy must often change its wing; And spring would be but gloomy weather, If we had nothing else but spring. 'Tis not that I expect to find A more devoted, fond, and true one, With rosier cheek or sweeter mind— Enough for me that she's a new one. Thus let us leave the bower of love, Where we have loiter'd long in bliss; And you may down that pathway rove, While I shall take my way through this. ANACREONTIC. [“She never look'd so kind before—] “She never look'd so kind before— “Yet why the wanton's smile recall? “I've seen this witchery o'er and o'er, “'Tis hollow, vain, and heartless all!” Thus I said and, sighing, drain'd The cup which she so late had tasted; Upon whose rim still fresh remain'd The breath, so oft in falsehood wasted. I took the harp, and would have sung As if 'twere not of her I sang; But still the notes on Lamia hung— On whom but Lamia could they hang? Those eyes of hers, that floating shine, Like diamonds in some Eastern river; That kiss, for which, if worlds were mine, A world for every kiss I'd give her. That frame so delicate, yet warm'd With flushes of love's genial hue;— A mould transparent, as if form'd To let the spirit's light shine through. Of these I sung, and notes and words Were sweet, as if the very air From Lamia's lip hung o'er the chords, And Lamia's voice still warbled there! But when, alas, I turn'd the theme, And when of vows and oaths I spoke, Of truth and hope's seducing dream— The chord beneath my finger broke. False harp! false woman!—such, oh, such Are lutes too frail and hearts too willing; Any hand, whate'er its touch, Can set their chords or pulses thrilling. And when that thrill is most awake, And when you think Heav'n's joys await you, The nymph will change, the chord will break— Oh Love, oh Music, how I hate you! TO JULIA. I saw the peasant's hand unkind From yonder oak the ivy sever; They seem'd in very being twin'd; Yet now the oak is fresh as ever! Not so the widow'd ivy shines: Torn from its dear and only stay, In drooping widowhood it pines, And scatters all its bloom away. Thus, Julia, did our hearts entwine, Till Fate disturb'd their tender ties: Thus gay indifference blooms in thine, While mine, deserted, droops and dies! HYMN OF A VIRGIN OF DELPHI, AT THE TOMB OF HER MOTHER. Oh, lost, for ever lost—no more Shall Vesper light our dewy way Along the rocks of Crissa's shore, To hymn the fading fires of day; No more to Tempé's distant vale In holy musings shall we roam, Through summer's glow and winter's gale, To bear the mystic chaplets home. The laurel, for the common uses of the temple, for adorning the altars and sweeping the pavement, was supplied by a tree near the fountain of Castalia; but upon all important occasions, they sent to Tempé for their laurel. We find, in Pausanias, that this valley supplied the branches, of which the temple was originally constructed; and Plutarch says, in his Dialogue on Music, “The youth who brings the Tempic laurel to Delphi is always attended by a player on the flute.” ???? ??? ??? ?? ????????????? ????? ??? ???????? ?????? ??? ??????? ?????????? ???????. 'Twas then my soul's expanding zeal, By nature warm'd and led by thee, In every breeze was taught to feel The breathings of a Deity. Guide of my heart! still hovering round, Thy looks, thy words are still my own— I see thee raising from the ground Some laurel, by the winds o'erthrown, And hear thee say, “This humble bough “Was planted for a doom divine; “And, though it droop in languor now, “Shall flourish on the Delphic shrine! “Thus, in the vale of earthly sense, “Though sunk awhile the spirit lies, “A viewless hand shall cull it thence, “To bloom immortal in the skies!” All that the young should feel and know, By thee was taught so sweetly well, Thy words fell soft as vernal snow, And all was brightness where they fell! Fond soother of my infant tear, Fond sharer of my infant joy, Is not thy shade still lingering here? Am I not still thy soul's employ? Oh yes—and, as in former days, When, meeting on the sacred mount, Our nymphs awak'd their choral lays, And danc'd around Cassotis' fount; As then, 'twas all thy wish and care, That mine should be the simplest mien, My lyre and voice the sweetest there, My foot the lightest o'er the green: So still, each look and step to mould, Thy guardian care is round me spread, Arranging every snowy fold, And guiding every mazy tread. And, when I lead the hymning choir, Thy spirit still, unseen and free, Hovers between my lip and lyre, And weds them into harmony. Flow, Plistus, flow, thy murmuring wave Shall never drop its silv'ry tear Upon so pure, so blest a grave, To memory so entirely dear! SYMPATHY. TO JULIA. ? sine me sit nulla Venus. Sulpicia. Our hearts, my love, were form'd to be The genuine twins of Sympathy, They live with one sensation: In joy or grief, but most in love, Like chords in unison they move, And thrill with like vibration. How oft I've heard thee fondly say, Thy vital pulse shall cease to play When mine no more is moving; Since, now, to feel a joy alone Were worse to thee than feeling none So twinn'd are we in loving! THE TEAR. On beds of snow the moonbeam slept, And chilly was the midnight gloom, When by the damp grave Ellen wept— Fond maid! it was her Lindor's tomb! A warm tear gush'd, the wintry air Congeal'd it as it flow'd away: All night it lay an ice-drop there, At morn it glitter'd in the ray. An angel, wand'ring from her sphere, Who saw this bright, this frozen gem, To dew-ey'd Pity brought the tear, And hung it on her diadem! THE SNAKE. My love and I, the other day, Within a myrtle arbour lay, When near us, from a rosy bed, A little Snake put forth its head. “See,” said the maid with thoughtful eyes— “Yonder the fatal emblem lies! “Who could expect such hidden harm “Beneath the rose's smiling charm?” Never did grave remark occur Less à-propos than this from her. I rose to kill the snake, but she, Half-smiling, pray'd it might not be. “No,” said the maiden—and, alas, Her eyes spoke volumes, while she said it— “Long as the snake is in the grass, “One may, perhaps, have cause to dread it: “But, when its wicked eyes appear, “And when we know for what they wink so, “One must be very simple, dear, “To let it wound one—don't you think so?” TO ROSA. Is the song of Rosa mute? Once such lays inspired her lute! Never doth a sweeter song Steal the breezy lyre along, When the wind, in odours dying, Wooes it with enamour'd sighing. Is my Rosa's lute unstrung? Once a tale of peace it sung To her lover's throbbing breast— Then was he divinely blest! Ah! but Rosa loves no more, Therefore Rosa's song is o'er; And her lute neglected lies; And her boy forgotten sighs. Silent lute—forgotten lover— Rosa's love and song are over! ELEGIAC STANZAS. [When wearied wretches sink to sleep] Sic juvat perire. When wearied wretches sink to sleep, How heavenly soft their slumbers lie! How sweet is death to those who weep, To those who weep and long to die! Saw you the soft and grassy bed, Where flowrets deck the green earth's breast? 'Tis there I wish to lay my head, 'Tis there I wish to sleep at rest. Oh, let not tears embalm my tomb,— None but the dews at twilight given! Oh, let not sighs disturb the gloom,— None but the whispering winds of heaven! LOVE AND MARRIAGE. Eque brevi verbo ferre perenne malum. Secundus, eleg. vii. Still the question I must parry, Still a wayward truant prove: Where I love, I must not marry; Where I marry, cannot love. Were she fairest of creation, With the least presuming mind; Learned without affectation; Not deceitful, yet refin'd; Wise enough, but never rigid; Gay, but not too lightly free; Chaste as snow, and yet not frigid; Fond, yet satisfied with me: Were she all this ten times over, All that heav'n to earth allows, I should be too much her lover Ever to become her spouse. Love will never bear enslaving; Summer garments suit him best; Bliss itself is not worth having, If we're by compulsion blest. ANACREONTIC. [I fill'd to thee, to thee I drank] I fill'd to thee, to thee I drank, I nothing did but drink and fill; The bowl by turns was bright and blank, 'Twas drinking, filling, drinking still. At length I bid an artist paint Thy image in this ample cup, That I might see the dimpled saint, To whom I quaff'd my nectar up. Behold, how bright that purple lip Now blushes through the wave at me; Every roseate drop I sip Is just like kissing wine from thee. And still I drink the more for this; For, ever when the draught I drain, Thy lip invites another kiss, And—in the nectar flows again. So, here's to thee, my gentle dear, And may that eyelid never shine Beneath a darker, bitterer tear Than bathes it in this bowl of mine! THE SURPRISE. Chloris, I swear, by all I ever swore, That from this hour I shall not love thee more.— “What! love no more? Oh! why this alter'd vow?” Because I cannot love thee more—than now! TO MISS ?, ON HER ASKING THE AUTHOR WHY SHE HAD SLEEPLESS NIGHTS. I'll ask the sylph who round thee flies, And in thy breath his pinion dips, Who suns him in thy radiant eyes, And faints upon thy sighing lips: I'll ask him where's the veil of sleep That us'd to shade thy looks of light; And why those eyes their vigil keep, When other suns are sunk in night? And I will say—her angel breast Has never throbb'd with guilty sting; Her bosom is the sweetest nest Where Slumber could repose his wing! And I will say—her cheeks that flush, Like vernal roses in the sun, Have ne'er by shame been taught to blush, Except for what her eyes have done! Then tell me, why, thou child of air! Does slumber from her eyelids rove? What is her heart's impassion'd care?— Perhaps, oh sylph! perhaps, 'tis love. THE WONDER. Come, tell me where the maid is found, Whose heart can love without deceit, And I will range the world around, To sigh one moment at her feet. Oh! tell me where's her sainted home, What air receives her blessed sigh, A pilgrimage of years I'll roam To catch one sparkle of her eye! And if her cheek be smooth and bright, While truth within her bosom lies, I'll gaze upon her morn and night, Till my heart leave me through my eyes. Show me on earth a thing so rare, I'll own all miracles are true; To make one maid sincere and fair, Oh, 'tis the utmost Heav'n can do! LYING. Che con le lor bugie pajon divini. Mauro d'Arcano. I do confess, in many a sigh, My lips have breath'd you many a lie; And who, with such delights in view, Would lose them, for a lie or two? Nay,—look not thus, with brow reproving Lies are, my dear, the soul of loving. If half we tell the girls were true, If half we swear to think and do, Were aught but lying's bright illusion, This world would be in strange confusion. If ladies' eyes were, every one, As lovers swear, a radiant sun, Astronomy must leave the skies, To learn her lore in ladies' eyes. Oh, no—believe me, lovely girl, When nature turns your teeth to pearl, Your neck to snow, your eyes to fire, Your amber locks to golden wire, Then, only then can Heaven decree, That you should live for only me, Or I for you, as night and morn, We've swearing kist, and kissing sworn. And now, my gentle hints to clear, For once I'll tell you truth, my dear. Whenever you may chance to meet Some loving youth, whose love is sweet, Long as you're false and he believes you, Long as you trust and he deceives you, So long the blissful bond endures, And while he lies, his heart is yours: But, oh! you've wholly lost the youth The instant that he tells you truth. ANACREONTIC. [Friend of my soul, this goblet sip] Friend of my soul, this goblet sip, 'Twill chase that pensive tear; 'Tis not so sweet as woman's lip, But, oh! 'tis more sincere. Like her delusive beam, 'Twill steal away thy mind: But, truer than love's dream, It leaves no sting behind. Come, twine the wreath, thy brows to shade; These flow'rs were cull'd at noon;— Like woman's love the rose will fade, But, ah! not half so soon. For though the flower's decay'd, Its fragrance is not o'er; But once when love's betray'd, Its sweet life blooms no more. END OF THE FIRST VOLUME. THE PHILOSOPHER ARISTIPPUS It does not appear to have been very difficult to become a philosopher amongst the ancients. A moderate store of learning, with a considerable portion of confidence, and just wit enough to produce an occasional apophthegm, seem to have been all the qualifications necessary for the purpose. The principles of moral science were so very imperfectly understood that the founder of a new sect, in forming his ethical code, might consult either fancy or temperament, and adapt it to his own passions and propensities; so that Mahomet, with a little more learning, might have flourished as a philosopher in those days, and would have required but the polish of the schools to become the rival of Aristippus in morality. In the science of nature, too, though some valuable truths were discovered by them, they seemed hardly to know they were truths, or at least were as well satisfied with errors; and Xenophanes, who asserted that the stars were igneous clouds, lighted up every night and extinguished again in the morning, was thought and styled a philosopher, as generally as he who anticipated Newton in developing the arrangement of the universe. For this opinion of Xenophanes, see Plutarch. de Placit. Philosoph. lib. ii. cap. 13. It is impossible to read this treatise of Plutarch, without alternately admiring the genius, and smiling at the absurdities of the philosophers. TO A LAMP WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM BY LAIS. Dulcis conscia lectuli lucerna. Martial., lib. xiv. epig. 39. “Oh! love the Lamp” (my Mistress said), “The faithful Lamp that, many a night, “Beside thy Lais' lonely bed “Has kept its little watch of light. “Full often has it seen her weep, “And fix her eye upon its flame, “Till, weary, she has sunk to sleep, “Repeating her beloved's name. “Then love the Lamp—'twill often lead “Thy step through learning's sacred way; “And when those studious eyes shall read, “At midnight, by its lonely ray, “Of things sublime, of nature's birth, “Of all that's bright in heaven or earth, “Oh, think that she, by whom 'twas given, “Adores thee more than earth or heaven!” Yes—dearest Lamp, by every charm On which thy midnight beam has hung The ancients had their lucernæ cubiculariæ or bedchamber lamps, which, as the Emperor Galienus said, “nil cras meminere;” and, with the same commendation of secrecy, Praxagora addresses her lamp in Aristophanes, ??????. We may judge how fanciful they were, in the use and embellishment of their lamps, from the famous symbolic Lucerna, which we find in the Romanum Museum Mich. Ang. Causei, p. 127.; The head reclin'd, the graceful arm Across the brow of ivory flung; The heaving bosom, partly hid, The sever'd lip's unconscious sighs, The fringe that from the half-shut lid Adown the cheek of roses lies: By these, by all that bloom untold, And long as all shall charm my heart, I'll love my little Lamp of gold— My Lamp and I shall never part. And often, as she smiling said, In fancy's hour, thy gentle rays Shall guide my visionary tread Through poesy's enchanting maze. Thy flame shall light the page refin'd, Where still we catch the Chian's breath, Where still the bard, though cold in death, Has left his soul unquench'd behind. Or, o'er thy humbler legend shine, Oh man of Ascra's dreary glades. Hesiod, who tells us in melancholy terms of his father's flight to the wretched village of Ascra. ???. ??? ????. v. 251.

Id. v. 30., Pluck'd from the greenest tree, that shades The crystal of Castalia's wave. Then, turning to a purer lore, We'll cull the sages' deep-hid store, From Science steal her golden clue. And every mystic path pursue, Where Nature, far from vulgar eyes, Through labyrinths of wonder flies. 'Tis thus my heart shall learn to know How fleeting is this world below, Where all that meets the morning light, Is chang'd before the fall of night! ?(??? ?? ??? ??????? ?????, as expressed among the dogmas of Heraclitus the Ephesian, and with the same image by Seneca, in whom we find a beautiful diffusion of the thought. “Nemo est mane, qui fuit pridie. Corpora nostra rapiuntur fluminum more; quidquid vides currit cum tempore. Nihil ex his quæ videmus manet. Ego ipse, dum loquor mutari ipsa, mutatus sum,” &amp;c. I'll tell thee, as I trim thy fire, “Swift, swift the tide of being runs, “And Time, who bids thy flame expire, “Will also quench yon heaven of suns.” Oh, then if earth's united power Can never chain one feathery hour; If every print we leave to-day To-morrow's wave will sweep away; Who pauses to inquire of heaven Why were the fleeting treasures given, The sunny days, the shady nights, And all their brief but dear delights, Which heaven has made for man to use, And man should think it crime to lose? Who that has cull'd a fresh-blown rose Will ask it why it breathes and glows, Unmindful of the blushing ray, In which it shines its soul away; Unmindful of the scented sigh, With which it dies and loves to die. Pleasure, thou only good on earth! Aristippus considered motion as the principle of happiness, in which idea he differed from the Epicureans, who looked to a state of repose as the only true voluptuousness, and avoided even the too lively agitations of pleasure, as a violent and ungraceful derangement of the senses. One precious moment giv'n to thee— Oh! by my Lais' lip, 'tis worth The sage's immortality. Then far be all the wisdom hence, That would our joys one hour delay! Alas, the feast of soul and sense Love calls us to in youth's bright day, If not soon tasted, fleets away. Ne'er wert thou formed, my Lamp, to shed Thy splendour on a lifeless page;— Whate'er my blushing Lais said Of thoughtful lore and studies sage, 'Twas mockery all—her glance of joy Told me thy dearest, best employ. Maupertuis has been still more explicit than this philosopher, in ranking the pleasures of sense above the sublimest pursuits of wisdom. Speaking of the infant man, in his production, he calls him, “une nouvelle créature, qui pourra comprendre les choses les plus sublimes, et ce qui est bien au-dessus, qui pourra gouter les mêmes plaisirs.” See his Vénus Physique. This appears to be one of the efforts at Fontenelle's gallantry of manner, for which the learned President is so well and justly ridiculed in the Akakia of Voltaire. Maupertuis may be thought to have borrowed from the ancient Aristippus that indiscriminate theory of pleasures which he has set forth in his Essai de Philosophe Morale, and for which he was so very justly condemned. Aristippus, according to Laertius, held ?? ????????? ?? ?????? ??????, which irrational sentiment has been adopted by Maupertuis: “Tant qu on ne considère que l'état présent, tous les plaisirs sont du même genre,” &amp;c. &amp;c. And, soon as night shall close the eye Of heaven's young wanderer in the west; When seers are gazing on the sky, To find their future orbs of rest; Then shall I take my trembling way, Unseen but to those worlds above, And, led by thy mysterious ray, Steal to the night-bower of my love. TO MRS. ?. ON HER BEAUTIFUL TRANSLATION OF VOITURE'S KISS. Mon âme sur mon lèvre étoit lors toute entière, Pour savourer le miel qui sur la vôtre étoit; Mais en me retirant, elle resta derrière, Tant de ce doux plaisir l'amorce l'a restoit. Voiture. How heav'nly was the poet's doom, To breathe his spirit through a kiss; And lose within so sweet a tomb The trembling messenger of bliss! And, sure his soul return'd to feel That it again could ravish'd be; For in the kiss that thou didst steal, His life and soul have fled to thee. RONDEAU. [“Good night! good night!”—And is it so?] “Good night! good night!”—And is it so? And must I from my Rosa go? Oh Rosa, say “Good night!” once more, And I'll repeat it o'er and o'er, Till the first glance of dawning light Shall find us saying, still, “Good night.” And still “Good night,” my Rosa, say— But whisper still, “A minute stay;” And I will stay, and every minute Shall have an age of transport in it; Till Time himself shall stay his flight, To listen to our sweet “Good night.” “Good night!” you'll murmur with a sigh, And tell me it is time to fly: And I will vow, will swear to go, While still that sweet voice murmurs “No!” Till slumber seal our weary sight— And then, my love, my soul, “Good night!” SONG. [Why does azure deck the sky?] Why does azure deck the sky? 'Tis to be like thy looks of blue; Why is red the rose's dye? Because it is thy blushes' hue. All that's fair, by Love's decree, Has been made resembling thee! Why is falling snow so white, But to be like thy bosom fair? Why are solar beams so bright? That they may seem thy golden hair! All that's bright, by Love's decree, Has been made resembling thee! Why are nature's beauties felt? Oh! 'tis thine in her we see! Why has music power to melt? Oh! because it speaks like thee. All that's sweet, by Love's decree, Has been made resembling thee! TO ROSA. Like one who trusts to summer skies, And puts his little bark to sea, Is he who, lur'd by smiling eyes, Consigns his simple heart to thee. For fickle is the summer wind, And sadly may the bark be tost; For thou art sure to change thy mind, And then the wretched heart is lost! WRITTEN IN A COMMONPLACE BOOK, CALLED “THE BOOK OF FOLLIES;” IN WHICH EVERY ONE THAT OPENED IT WAS TO CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING. TO THE BOOK OF FOLLIES. This tribute's from a wretched elf, Who hails thee, emblem of himself. The book of life, which I have trac'd, Has been, like thee, a motley waste Of follies scribbled o'er and o'er, One folly bringing hundreds more. Some have indeed been writ so neat, In characters so fair, so sweet, That those who judge not too severely, Have said they lov'd such follies dearly Yet still, O book! the allusion stands; For these were penn'd by female hands: The rest—alas! I own the truth— Have all been scribbled so uncouth That Prudence, with a with'ring look, Disdainful, flings away the book. Like thine, its pages here and there Have oft been stain'd with blots of care; And sometimes hours of peace, I own, Upon some fairer leaves have shown, White as the snowings of that heav'n By which those hours of peace were given. But now no longer—such, oh, such The blast of Disappointment's touch!— No longer now those hours appear; Each leaf is sullied by a tear: Blank, blank is ev'ry page with care, Not ev'n a folly brightens there. Will they yet brighten?—never, never! Then shut the book, O God, for ever! TO ROSA. Say, why should the girl of my soul be in tears At a meeting of rapture like this, When the glooms of the past and the sorrow of years Have been paid by one moment of bliss? Are they shed for that moment of blissful delight, Which dwells on her memory yet? Do they flow, like the dews of the love-breathing night, From the warmth of the sun that has set? Oh! sweet is the tear on that languishing smile, That smile, which is loveliest then; And if such are the drops that delight can beguile, Thou shalt weep them again and again. LIGHT SOUNDS THE HARP. Light sounds the harp when the combat is over, When heroes are resting, and joy is in bloom; When laurels hang loose from the brow of the lover, And Cupid makes wings of the warrior's plume. But, when the foe returns, Again the hero burns; High flames the sword in his hand once more: The clang of mingling arms Is then the sound that charms, And brazen notes of war, that stirring trumpets pour;— Then, again comes the Harp, when the combat is over— When heroes are resting, and Joy is in bloom— When laurels hang loose from the brow of the lover, And Cupid makes wings of the warrior's plume. Light went the harp when the War-God, reclining, Lay lull'd on the white arm of Beauty to rest, When round his rich armour the myrtle hung twining, And flights of young doves made his helmet their nest. But, when the battle came, The hero's eye breathed flame: Soon from his neck the white arm was flung; While, to his wakening ear, No other sounds were dear But brazen notes of war, by thousand trumpets sung. But then came the light harp, when danger was ended, And Beauty once more lull'd the War-God to rest; When tresses of gold with his laurels lay blended, And flights of young doves made his helmet their nest.

Repeat its magic o'er and o'er, And let the sound my lips adore, Live in the breeze, till every tone, And word, and breath, speaks her alone. Give me the wreath that withers there, It was but last delicious night, It circled her luxuriant hair, And caught her eyes' reflected light. Oh! haste, and twine it round my brow. 'Tis all of her that's left me now. And see—each rosebud drops a tear, To find the nymph no longer here— No longer, where such heavenly charms As hers should be—within these arms. SONG. [Fly from the world, O Bessy! to me] Fly from the world, O Bessy! to me, Thou wilt never find any sincerer; I'll give up the world, O Bessy! for thee, I can never meet any that's dearer. Then tell me no more, with a tear and a sigh, That our loves will be censur'd by many; All, all have their follies, and who will deny That ours is the sweetest of any? When your lip has met mine, in communion so sweet, Have we felt as if virtue forbid it?— Have we felt as if heav'n denied them to meet?— No, rather 'twas heav'n that did it. So innocent, love, is the joy we then sip, So little of wrong is there in it, That I wish all my errors were lodg'd on your lip, And I'd kiss them away in a minute. Then come to your lover, oh! fly to his shed, From a world which I know thou despisest; And slumber will hover as light o'er our bed As e'er on the couch of the wisest. And when o'er our pillow the tempest is driven, And thou, pretty innocent, fearest, I'll tell thee, it is not the chiding of heav'n, 'Tis only our lullaby, dearest. And, oh! while we lie on our deathbed, my love, Looking back on the scene of our errors, A sigh from my Bessy shall plead then above, And Death be disarm'd of his terrors. And each to the other embracing will say, “Farewell! let us hope we're forgiven.” Thy last fading glance will illumine the way, And a kiss be our passport to heaven! THE RESEMBLANCE. ? yo cercand' io, Donna, quant' e possibile, in altrui La desiata vostra forma vera. Petrarc. Sonett. 14. Yes, if 'twere any common love, That led my pliant heart astray, I grant, there's not a power above, Could wipe the faithless crime away. But, 'twas my doom to err with one In every look so like to thee That, underneath yon blessed sun, So fair there are but thou and she. Both born of beauty, at a birth, She held with thine a kindred sway, And wore the only shape on earth That could have lured my soul to stray. Then blame me not, if false I be, 'Twas love that wak'd the fond excess; My heart had been more true to thee, Had mine eye priz'd thy beauty less. FANNY, DEAREST. Yes! had I leisure to sigh and mourn, Fanny, dearest, for thee I'd sigh; And every smile on my cheek should turn To tears when thou art nigh. But, between love, and wine, and sleep, So busy a life I live, That even the time it would take to weep Is more than my heart can give. Then bid me not to despair and pine, Fanny, dearest of all the dears! The Love that's order'd to bathe in wine, Would be sure to take cold in tears. Reflected bright in this heart of mine, Fanny, dearest, thy image lies; But, ah, the mirror would cease to shine, If dimm'd too often with sighs. They lose the half of beauty's light, Who view it through sorrow's tear; And 'tis but to see thee truly bright That I keep my eye-beam clear. Then wait no longer till tears shall flow, Fanny, dearest—the hope is vain; If sunshine cannot dissolve thy snow, I shall never attempt it with rain. THE RING. TO ? No—Lady! Lady! keep the ring: Oh! think, how many a future year, Of placid smile and downy wing, May sleep within its holy sphere. Do not disturb their tranquil dream, Though love hath ne'er the mystery warm'd; Yet heav'n will shed a soothing beam, To bless the bond itself hath form'd. But then, that eye, that burning eye,— Oh! it doth ask, with witching power, If heaven can ever bless the tie Where love inwreaths no genial flower? Away, away, bewildering look, Or all the boast of virtue's o'er; Go—hie thee to the sage's book, And learn from him to feel no more. I cannot warn thee: every touch, That brings my pulses close to thine, Tells me I want thy aid as much— Ev'n more, alas, than thou dost mine. Yet, stay,—one hope, one effort yet— A moment turn those eyes away, And let me, if I can, forget The light that leads my soul astray. Thou say'st, that we were born to meet, That our hearts bear one common seal;— Think, Lady, think, how man's deceit Can seem to sigh and feign to feel. When, o'er thy face some gleam of thought, Like daybeams through the morning air, Hath gradual stole, and I have caught The feeling ere it kindled there; The sympathy I then betray'd, Perhaps was but the child of art, The guile of one, who long hath play'd With all these wily nets of heart. Oh! thine is not my earliest vow; Though few the years I yet have told, Canst thou believe I've lived till now, With loveless heart or senses cold? No—other nymphs to joy and pain This wild and wandering heart hath mov'd; With some it sported, wild and vain, While some it dearly, truly, lov'd. The cheek to thine I fondly lay, To theirs hath been as fondly laid The words to thee I warmly say, To them have been as warmly said. Then, scorn at once a worthless heart, Worthless alike, or fix'd or free; Think of the pure, bright soul thou art, And—love not me, oh love not me. Enough—now, turn thine eyes again; What, still that look and still that sigh! Dost thou not feel my counsel then? Oh! no, beloved,—nor do I. TO THE INVISIBLE GIRL. They try to persuade me, my dear little sprite, That you're not a true daughter of ether and light, Nor have any concern with those fanciful forms That dance upon rainbows and ride upon storms; That, in short, you're a woman; your lip and your eye As mortal as ever drew gods from the sky. But I will not believe them—no, Science, to you I have long bid a last and a careless adieu: Still flying from Nature to study her laws, And dulling delight by exploring its cause, You forget how superior, for mortals below, Is the fiction they dream to the truth that they know. Oh! who, that has e'er enjoyed rapture complete, Would ask how we feel it, or why it is sweet; How rays are confus'd, or how particles fly Through the medium refin'd of a glance or a sigh; Is there one, who but once would not rather have known it, Than written, with Harvey, whole volumes upon it? As for you, my sweet-voiced and invisible love, You must surely be one of those spirits, that rove By the bank where, at twilight, the poet reclines, When the star of the west on his solitude shines, And the magical fingers of fancy have hung Every breeze with a sigh, every leaf with a tongue. Oh! hint to him then, 'tis retirement alone Can hallow his harp or ennoble its tone; Like you, with a veil of seclusion between, His song to the world let him utter unseen, And like you, a legitimate child of the spheres, Escape from the eye to enrapture the ears. Sweet spirit of mystery! how I should love, In the wearisome ways I am fated to rove, To have you thus ever invisibly nigh, Inhaling for ever your song and your sigh! Mid the crowds of the world and the murmurs of care, I might sometimes converse with my nymph of the air, And turn with distaste from the clamorous crew, To steal in the pauses one whisper from you. Then, come and be near me, for ever be mine, We shall hold in the air a communion divine, As sweet as, of old, was imagin'd to dwell In the grotto of Numa, or Socrates' cell. And oft, at those lingering moments of night, When the heart's busy thoughts have put slumber to flight, You shall come to my pillow and tell me of love, Such as angel to angel might whisper above. Sweet spirit!—and then, could you borrow the tone Of that voice, to my ear like some fairy-song known, The voice of the one upon earth, who has twin'd With her being for ever my heart and my mind, Though lonely and far from the light of her smile, An exile, and weary and hopeless the while, Could you shed for a moment her voice on my ear, I will think, for that moment, that Cara is near; That she comes with consoling enchantment to speak, And kisses my eyelid and breathes on my cheek, And tells me, the night shall go rapidly by, For the dawn of our hope, of our heaven is nigh. Fair spirit! if such be your magical power, It will lighten the lapse of full many an hour; And, let fortune's realities frown as they will, Hope, fancy, and Cara may smile for me still. THE RING. A TALE. Annulus ille viri. —Ovid. Amor. lib. ii. eleg. 15. The happy day at length arriv'd When Rupert was to wed The fairest maid in Saxony, And take her to his bed. As soon as morn was in the sky, The feast and sports began; The men admir'd the happy maid, The maids the happy man. In many a sweet device of mirth The day was pass'd along; And some the featly dance amus'd, And some the dulcet song. The younger maids with Isabel Disported through the bowers, And deck'd her robe, and crown'd her head With motley bridal flowers. The matrons all in rich attire, Within the castle walls, Sat listening to the choral strains That echo'd through the halls. Young Rupert and his friends repair'd Unto a spacious court, To strike the bounding tennis-ball In feat and manly sport. The bridegroom on his finger wore The wedding-ring so bright, Which was to grace the lily hand Of Isabel that night. And fearing he might break the gem, Or lose it in the play, He look'd around the court, to see Where he the ring might lay. Now, in the court a statue stood, Which there full long had been; It might a Heathen goddess be, Or else, a Heathen queen. Upon its marble finger then He tried the ring to fit; And, thinking it was safest there, Thereon he fasten'd it. And now the tennis sports went on, Till they were wearied all, And messengers announc'd to them Their dinner in the hall. Young Rupert for his wedding-ring Unto the statue went; But, oh, how shock'd was he to find The marble finger bent! The hand was clos'd upon the ring With firm and mighty clasp; In vain he tried, and tried, and tried, He could not loose the grasp! Then sore surpris'd was Rupert's mind— As well his mind might be; “I'll come,” quoth he, “at night again, “When none are here to see.” He went unto the feast, and much He thought upon his ring; And marvell'd sorely what could mean So very strange a thing! The feast was o'er, and to the court He hied without delay, Resolv'd to break the marble hand And force the ring away. But, mark a stranger wonder still— The ring was there no more, And yet the marble hand ungrasp'd, And open as before! He search'd the base, and all the court, But nothing could he find; Then to the castle hied he back With sore bewilder'd mind. Within he found them all in mirth, The night in dancing flew; The youth another ring procur'd, And none the adventure knew. And now the priest has join'd their hands, The hours of love advance: Rupert almost forgets to think Upon the morn's mischance. Within the bed fair Isabel In blushing sweetness lay, Like flowers, half-open'd by the dawn, And waiting for the day. And Rupert, by her lovely side, In youthful beauty glows, Like Phœbus, when he bends to cast His beams upon a rose. And here my song would leave them both, Nor let the rest be told, If 'twere not for the horrid tale It yet has to unfold. Soon Rupert, 'twixt his bride and him, A death cold carcass found; He saw it not, but thought he felt Its arms embrace him round. He started up, and then return'd, But found the phantom still; In vain he shrunk, it clipp'd him round, With damp and deadly chill! And when he bent, the earthy lips A kiss of horror gave; 'Twas like the smell from charnel vaults, Or from the mould'ring grave! Ill fated Rupert!—wild and loud Then cried he to his wife, “Oh! save me from this horrid fiend, “My Isabel! my life!” But Isabel had nothing seen, She look'd around in vain; And much she mourn'd the mad conceit That rack'd her Rupert's brain. At length from this invisible These words to Rupert came: (Oh God! while he did hear the words What terrors shook his frame!) “Husband, husband, I've the ring “Thou gav'st to-day to me; “And thou'rt to me for ever wed, “As I am wed to thee!” And all the night the demon lay Cold-chilling by his side, And strain'd him with such deadly grasp, He thought he should have died. But when the dawn of day was near, The horrid phantom fled, And left th' affrighted youth to weep By Isabel in bed. And all that day a gloomy cloud Was seen on Rupert's brows; Fair Isabel was likewise sad, But strove to cheer her spouse. And, as the day advanc'd, he thought Of coming night with fear: Alas, that he should dread to view The bed that should be dear! At length the second night arriv'd, Again their couch they press'd; Poor Rupert hop'd that all was o'er, And look'd for love and rest. But oh! when midnight came, again The fiend was at his side, And, as it strain'd him in its grasp, With howl exulting cried:— “Husband, husband, I've the ring, “The ring thou gav'st to me; “And thou'rt to me for ever wed, “As I am wed to thee!” In agony of wild despair, He started from the bed; And thus to his bewilder'd wife The trembling Rupert said: “Oh Isabel! dost thou not see “A shape of horrors here, “That strains me to its deadly kiss, “And keeps me from my dear?” “No, no, my love! my Rupert, I “No shape of horrors see; “And much I mourn the phantasy “That keeps my dear from me.” This night, just like the night before, In terrors pass'd away, Nor did the demon vanish thence Before the dawn of day. Said Rupert then, “My Isabel, “Dear partner of my woe, “To Father Austin's holy cave “This instant will I go.” Now Austin was a reverend man, Who acted wonders maint— Whom all the country round believ'd A devil or a saint! To Father Austin's holy cave Then Rupert straightway went; And told him all, and ask'd him how These horrors to prevent. The father heard the youth, and then Retir'd awhile to pray; And, having pray'd for half an hour Thus to the youth did say: “There is a place where four roads meet, “Which I will tell to thee; “Be there this eve, at fall of night, “And list what thou shalt see. “Thou'lt see a group of figures pass “In strange disorder'd crowd, “Travelling by torchlight through the roads, “With noises strange and loud. “And one that's high above the rest, “Terrific towering o'er, “Will make thee know him at a glance, “So I need say no more. “To him from me these tablets give, “They'll quick be understood; “Thou need'st not fear, but give them straight, “I've scrawl'd them with my blood!” The night-fall came, and Rupert all In pale amazement went To where the cross-roads met, as he Was by the Father sent. And lo! a group of figures came In strange disorder'd crowd, Travelling by torchlight through the roads, With noises strange and loud. And, as the gloomy train advanc'd, Rupert beheld from far A female form of wanton mien High seated on a car. And Rupert, as he gaz'd upon The loosely vested dame, Thought of the marble statue's look, For hers was just the same. Behind her walk'd a hideous form, With eyeballs flashing death; Whene'er he breath'd, a sulphur'd smoke Came burning in his breath. He seem'd the first of all the crowd, Terrific towering o'er; “Yes, yes,” said Rupert, “this is he, “And I need ask no more.” Then slow he went, and to this fiend The tablets trembling gave, Who look'd and read them with a yell That would disturb the grave. And when he saw the blood-scrawl'd name, His eyes with fury shine; “I thought,” cries he, “his time was out, “But he must soon be mine!” Then darting at the youth a look Which rent his soul with fear, He went unto the female fiend, And whisper'd in her ear. The female fiend no sooner heard Than, with reluctant look, The very ring that Rupert lost, She from her finger took. And, giving it unto the youth, With eyes that breath'd of hell, She said, in that tremendous voice, Which he remember'd well: “In Austin's name take back the ring, “The ring thou gav'st to me; “And thou'rt to me no longer wed, “Nor longer I to thee.’ He took the ring, the rabble pass'd, He home return'd again; His wife was then the happiest fair, The happiest he of men. TO ? ON SEEING HER WITH A WHITE VEIL AND A RICH GIRDLE. ?????????? ??????? ??????? ?(???. Ap. Nicephor. in Oneirocritico. Put off the vestal veil, nor, oh! Let weeping angels view it; Your cheeks belie its virgin snow, And blush repenting through it. Put off the fatal zone you wear; The shining pearls around it Are tears, that fell from Virtue there, The hour when Love unbound it. WRITTEN IN THE BLANK LEAF OF A LADY'S COMMONPLACE BOOK. Here is one leaf reserv'd for me, From all thy sweet memorials free; And here my simple song might tell The feelings thou must guess so well. But could I thus, within thy mind, One little vacant corner find, Where no impression yet is seen, Where no memorial yet hath been, Oh! it should be my sweetest care To write my name for ever there! TO MRS. BL?. WRITTEN IN HER ALBUM. They say that Love had once a book (The urchin likes to copy you), Where, all who came, the pencil took, And wrote, like us, a line or two. 'Twas Innocence, the maid divine, Who kept this volume bright and fair, And saw that no unhallow'd line Or thought profane should enter there; And daily did the pages fill With fond device and loving lore, And every leaf she turn'd was still More bright than that she turn'd before. Beneath the touch of Hope, how soft, How light the magic pencil ran! Till Fear would come, alas, as oft, And trembling close what Hope began. A tear or two had dropp'd from Grief, And Jealousy would, now and then, Ruffle in haste some snow-white leaf, Which Love had still to smooth again. But, ah! there came a blooming boy, Who often turn'd the pages o'er, And wrote therein such words of joy, That all who read them sigh'd for more. And Pleasure was this spirit's name, And though so soft his voice and look, Yet Innocence, whene'er he came, Would tremble for her spotless book. For, oft a Bacchant cup he bore, With earth's sweet nectar sparkling bright; And much she fear'd lest, mantling o'er, Some drops should on the pages light. And so it chanc'd, one luckless night, The urchin let that goblet fall O'er the fair book, so pure, so white, And sullied lines and marge and all! In vain now, touch'd with shame, he tried To wash those fatal stains away; Deep, deep had sunk the sullying tide, The leaves grew darker every day. And Fancy's sketches lost their hue, And Hope's sweet lines were all effac'd, And Love himself now scarcely knew What Love himself so lately trac'd. At length the urchin Pleasure fled, (For how, alas! could Pleasure stay?) And Love, while many a tear he shed, Reluctant flung the book away The index now alone remains, Of all the pages spoil'd by Pleasure, And though it bears some earthy stains, Yet Memory counts the leaf a treasure. And oft, they say, she scans it o'er, And oft, by this memorial aided, Brings back the pages now no more, And thinks of lines that long have faded. I know not if this tale be true, But thus the simple facts are stated; And I refer their truth to you, Since Love and you are near related. TO CARA, AFTER AN INTERVAL OF ABSENCE. Conceal'd within the shady wood A mother left her sleeping child, And flew, to cull her rustic food, The fruitage of the forest wild. But storms upon her pathway rise, The mother roams, astray and weeping; Far from the weak appealing cries Of him she left so sweetly sleeping. She hopes, she fears; a light is seen, And gentler blows the night wind's breath; Yet no—'tis gone—the storms are keen, The infant may be chill'd to death! Perhaps, ev'n now, in darkness shrouded, His little eyes lie cold and still;— And yet, perhaps, they are not clouded, Life and love may light them still. Thus, Cara, at our last farewell, When, fearful ev'n thy hand to touch, I mutely asked those eyes to tell If parting pain'd thee half so much: I thought,—and, oh! forgive the thought, For none was e'er by love inspir'd Whom fancy had not also taught To hope the bliss his soul desir'd. Yes, I did think, in Cara's mind, Though yet to that sweet mind unknown, I left one infant wish behind, One feeling, which I called my own. Oh blest! though but in fancy blest, How did I ask of Pity's care, To shield and strengthen, in thy breast, The nursling I had cradled there. And, many an hour, beguil'd by pleasure, And many an hour of sorrow numbering, I ne'er forgot the new-born treasure, I left within thy bosom slumbering. Perhaps, indifference has not chill'd it, Haply, it yet a throb may give— Yet, no—perhaps, a doubt has kill'd it; Say, dearest—does the feeling live? TO CARA, ON THE DAWNING OF A NEW YEAR'S DAY. When midnight came to close the year, We sigh'd to think it thus should take The hours it gave us—hours as dear As sympathy and love could make Their blessed moments,—every sun Saw us, my love, more closely one. But, Cara, when the dawn was nigh Which came a new year's light to shed, That smile we caught from eye to eye Told us, those moments were not fled: Oh, no,—we felt, some future sun Should see us still more closely one. Thus may we ever, side by side, From happy years to happier glide; And still thus may the passing sigh We give to hours, that vanish o'er us, Be follow'd by the smiling eye, That Hope shall shed on scenes before us! TO ?, 1801. To be the theme of every hour The heart devotes to Fancy's power, When her prompt magic fills the mind With friends and joys we've left behind, And joys return and friends are near, And all are welcom'd with a tear:— In the mind's purest seat to dwell, To be remember'd oft and well By one whose heart, though vain and wild, By passion led, by youth beguil'd, Can proudly still aspire to be All that may yet win smiles from thee:— If thus to live in every part Of a lone, weary wanderer's heart; If thus to be its sole employ Can give thee one faint gleam of joy, Believe it, Mary,—oh! believe A tongue that never can deceive, Though, erring, it too oft betray Ev'n more than Love should dare to say,— In Pleasure's dream or Sorrow's hour, In crowded hall or lonely bower, The business of my life shall be, For ever to remember thee. And though that heart be dead to mine, Since Love is life and wakes not thine, I'll take thy image, as the form Of one whom Love had fail'd to warm, Which, though it yield no answering thrill, Is not less dear, is worshipp'd still— I'll take it, wheresoe'er I stray, The bright, cold burden of my way. To keep this semblance fresh in bloom, My heart shall be its lasting tomb, And Memory, with embalming care, Shall keep it fresh and fadeless there. THE GENIUS OF HARMONY AN IRREGULAR ODE. Ad harmoniam canere mundum. Cicero de Nat. Deor. lib. iii. There lies a shell beneath the waves, In many a hollow winding wreath'd, Such as of old Echoed the breath that warbling sea-maids breath'd; This magic shell, From the white bosom of a syren fell, As once she wander'd by the tide that laves Sicilia's sands of gold. It bears Upon its shining side the mystic notes Of those entrancing airs In the “Histoire Naturelle des Antilles,” there is an account of some curious shells, found at Curaçoa, on the back of which were lines, filled with musical characters so distinct and perfect, that the writer assures us a very charming trio was sung from one of them. “On le nomme musical, parcequ'il porte sur le dos des lignes noirâtres pleines de notes, qui ont une espèce de clé pour les mettre en chant, de sorte que l'on diroit qu'il ne manque que la lettre à cette tablature naturelle. Ce curieux gentilhomme (M. du Montel) rapporte qu'il en a vû qui avoient cinq lignes, une clé, et des notes, qui formoient un accord parfait. Quelqu'un y avoit ajouté la lettre, que la nature avoit oubliée, et la faisoit chanter en forme de trio, dont l'air étoit fort agréable.”—Chap. xix. art. 11. The author adds, a poet might imagine that these shells were used by the syrens at their concerts., The genii of the deep were wont to swell, When heaven's eternal orbs their midnight music roll'd! Oh! seek it, wheresoe'er it floats; And, if the power Of thrilling numbers to thy soul be dear, Go, bring the bright shell to my bower, And I will fold thee in such downy dreams As lap the Spirit of the Seventh Sphere, When Luna's distant tone falls faintly on his ear! According to Cicero, and his commentator, Macrobius, the lunar tone is the gravest and faintest on the planetary heptachord. “Quam ob causam summus ille cœli stellifer cursus, cujus conversio est concitatior, acuto et excitato movetur sono; gravissimo autem hic lunaris atque infimus.”—Somn. Scip. Because, says Macrobius, “spiritu ut in extremitate languescente jam volvitur, et propter angustias quibus penultimus orbis arctatur impetu leniore convertitur.”—In Somn. Scip. lib. ii. cap. 4. In their musical arrangement of the heavenly bodies, the ancient writers are not very intelligible. —See Ptolem. lib. iii. Leone Hebreo, pursuing the idea of Aristotle, that the heavens are animal, attributes their harmony to perfect and reciprocal love. “Non pero manca fra loro il perfetto et reciproco amore: la causa principale, che ne mostra il loro amore, è la lor amicitia armonica et la concordanza, che perpetuamente si trova in loro.”—Dialog. ii. di Amore, p. 58. This “reciproco amore” of Leone is the ??????? of the ancient Empedocles, who seems, in his Love and Hate of the Elements, to have given a glimpse of the principles of attraction and repulsion. See the fragment to which I allude in Laertius, ?????? ??? ????????, ???????????, ?. ?. ?., lib. viii. cap. 2. n. 12. And thou shalt own, That, through the circle of creation's zone, Where matter slumbers or where spirit beams; From the pellucid tides Leucippus, the atomist, imagined a kind of vortices in the heavens, which he borrowed from Anaxagoras, and possibly suggested to Descartes., that whirl The planets through their maze of song, To the small rill, that weeps along Murmuring o'er beds of pearl; From the rich sigh Of the sun's arrow through an evening sky Heraclides, upon the allegories of Homer, conjectures that the idea of the harmony of the spheres originated with this poet, who, in representing the solar beams as arrows, supposes them to emit a peculiar sound in the air., To the faint breath the tuneful osier yields On Afric's burning fields In the account of Africa which D'Ablancourt has translated, there is mention of a tree in that country, whose branches when shaken by the hand produce very sweet sounds. “Le même auteur (Abenzégar) dit, qu'il y a un certain arbre, qui produit des gaules comme d'osier, et qu'en les prenant à la main et les branlant, elles font une espèce d'harmonie fort agréable,” &amp;c. &amp;c. —L' Afrique de Marmol.; Thou'lt wondering own this universe divine Is mine!

Descartes thought that our earth might formerly have been a sun, which became obscured by a thick incrustation over its surface.

Iamblich. de Vit. This, as Holstenius remarks, was in imitation of the Magi., Where the rapt Samian slept his holy slumber?

Such dreams, so heavenly bright, I swear By the great diadem that twines my hair, And by the seven gems that sparkle there This diadem is intended to represent the analogy between the notes of music and the prismatic colours.

Cassiodorus, whose idea I may be supposed to have borrowed, says, in a letter upon music to Boetius, “Ut diadema oculis, varia luce gemmarum, sic cythara diversitate soni, blanditur auditui.” This is indeed the only tolerable thought in the letter.—Lib. ii. Variar., Mingling their beams In a soft iris of harmonious light, Oh, mortal! such shall be thy radiant dreams. [I found her not—the chamber seem'd] I found her not—the chamber seem'd Like some divinely haunted place, Where fairy forms had lately beam'd, And left behind their odorous trace! It felt, as if her lips had shed A sigh around her, ere she fled, Which hung, as on a melting lute, When all the silver chords are mute, There lingers still a trembling breath After the note's luxurious death, A shade of song, a spirit air Of melodies which had been there. I saw the veil, which, all the day, Had floated o'er her cheek of rose; I saw the couch, where late she lay In languor of divine repose; And I could trace the hallow'd print Her limbs had left, as pure and warm, As if 'twere done in rapture's mint, And Love himself had stamp'd the form. Oh my sweet mistress, where wert thou? In pity fly not thus from me; Thou art my life, my essence now, And my soul dies of wanting thee. TO MRS. HENRY TIGHE, ON READING HER “PSYCHE.” Tell me the witching tale again For never has my heart or ear Hung on so sweet, so pure a strain, So pure to feel, so sweet to hear. Say, Love, in all thy prime of fame, When the high heaven itself was thine; When piety confess'd the flame, And even thy errors were divine; Did ever Muse's hand, so fair, A glory round thy temples spread? Did ever lip's ambrosial air Such fragrance o'er thy altars shed? One maid there was, who round her lyre The mystic myrtle wildly wreath'd;— But all her sighs were sighs of fire, The myrtle wither'd as she breath'd. Oh! you, that love's celestial dream, In all its purity, would know, Let not the senses' ardent beam Too strongly through the vision glow. Love safest lies, conceal'd in night, The night where heaven has bid him lie; Oh! shed not there unhallow'd light, Or, Psyche knows, the boy will fly. See the story in Apuleius. With respect to this beautiful allegory of Love and Psyche, there is an ingenious idea suggested by the senator Buonarotti, in his “Osservazioni sopra alcuni frammenti di vasi antici.” He thinks the fable is taken from some very occult mysteries, which had long been celebrated in honour of Love; and accounts, upon this supposition, for the silence of the more ancient authors upon the subject, as it was not till towards the decline of pagan superstition, that writers could venture to reveal or discuss such ceremonies. Accordingly, observes this author, we find Lucian and Plutarch treating, without reserve, of the Dea Syria, as well as of Isis and Osiris; and Apuleius, to whom we are indebted for the beautiful story of Cupid and Psyche,. has also detailed some of the mysteries of Isis. See the Giornale di Litterati d'Italia, tom. xxvii. articol. 1. See also the observations upon the ancient gems in the Museum Florentinum, vol. i. p. 156. I cannot avoid remarking here an error into which the French Encyclopédistes have been led by M. Spon, in their article Psyche. They say “Petrone fait un récit de la pompe nuptiale de ces deux amans (Amour et Psyche). Déjà, dit-il,” &amp;c. &amp;c. The Psyche of Petronius, however, is a servant-maid, and the marriage which he describes is that of the young Pannychis. See Spon's Recherches curieuses, &amp;c. Dissertat. 5. Sweet Psyche, many a charmed hour, Through many a wild and magic waste, To the fair fount and blissful bower Allusions to Mrs. Tighe's Poem. Have I, in dreams, thy light foot trac'd! Where'er thy joys are number'd now, Beneath whatever shades of rest, The Genius of the starry brow Constancy. Hath bound thee to thy Cupid's breast; Whether above the horizon dim, Along whose verge our spirits stray,— Half sunk beneath the shadowy rim, Half brighten'd by the upper ray By this image the Platonists expressed the middle state of the soul between sensible and intellectual existence.,— Thou dwellest in a world, all light, Or, lingering here, dost love to be, To other souls, the guardian bright That Love was, through this gloom, to thee; Still be the song to Psyche dear, The song, whose gentle voice was given To be, on earth, to mortal ear, An echo of her own, in heaven. FROM THE HIGH PRIEST OF APOLLO TO A VIRGIN OF DELPHI. This poem, as well as a few others in the following volume, formed part of a work which I had early projected, and even announced to the public, but which, luckily, perhaps, for myself, had been interrupted by my visit to America in the year 1803. Among those impostures in which the priests of the pagan temples are known to have indulged, one of the most favourite was that of announcing to some fair votary of the shrine, that the God himself had become enamoured of her beauty, and would descend in all his glory, to pay her a visit within the recesses of the fane. An adventure of this description formed an episode in the classic romance which I had sketched out; and the short fragment, given above, belongs to an epistle by which the story was to have been introduced. Cum digno digna ? Sulpicia. “Who is the maid, with golden hair, “With eye of fire, and foot of air, “Whose harp around my altar swells, “The sweetest of a thousand shells?” 'Twas thus the deity, who treads The arch of heaven, and proudly sheds Day from his eyelids—thus he spoke, As through my cell his glories broke.

It should seem that lunar spirits were of a purer order than spirits in general, as Pythagoras was said by his followers to have descended from the regions of the moon. The heresiarch Manes, in the same manner, imagined that the sun and moon are the residence of Christ, and that the ascension was nothing more than his flight to those orbs. “Along its shadowy pathway rolls— “There shall we meet,—and not ev'n He, “The God who reigns immortally, “Where Babel's turrets paint their pride “Upon th' Euphrates' shining tide The temple of Jupiter Belus, at Babylon; in one of whose towers there was a large chapel set apart for these celestial assignations. “No man is allowed to sleep here,” says Herodotus; “but the apartment is appropriated to a female, whom, if we believe the Chaldæan priests, the deity selects from the women of the country, as his favourite.” Lib. i. cap. 181.,— “Not ev'n when to his midnight loves “In mystic majesty he moves, “Lighted by many an odorous fire, “And hymn'd by all Chaldæa's choir,— “E'er yet, o'er mortal brow, let shine “Such effluence of Love Divine, “As shall to-night, blest maid, o'er thine.” Happy the maid, whom heaven allows To break for heaven her virgin vows! Happy the maid!—her robe of shame Is whiten'd by a heavenly flame, Whose glory, with a lingering trace, Shines through and deifies her race! Fontenelle, in his playful rifacimento of the learned materials of Van-Dale, has related in his own inimitable manner an adventure of this kind which was detected and exposed at Alexandria. See L'Histoire des Oracles, dissert. 2. chap. vii. Crebillon, too, in one of his most amusing little stories, has made the Génie Mange-Taupes, of the Isle Jonquille, assert this privilege of spiritual beings in a manner rather formidable to the husbands of the island. FRAGMENT. [Pity me, love! I'll pity thee] Pity me, love! I'll pity thee, If thou indeed has felt like me. All, all my bosom's peace is o'er! At night, which was my hour of calm, When from the page of classic lore, From the pure fount of ancient lay My soul has drawn the placid balm, Which charm'd its every grief away, Ah! there I find that balm no more. Those spells, which make us oft forget The fleeting troubles of the day, In deeper sorrows only whet The stings they cannot tear away. When to my pillow rack'd I fly, With wearied sense and wakeful eye. While my brain maddens, where, oh, where Is that serene consoling pray'r, Which once has harbinger'd my rest, When the still soothing voice of Heaven Hath seem'd to whisper in my breast, “Sleep on, thy errors are forgiven!” No, though I still in semblance pray, My thoughts are wandering far away And ev'n the name of Deity Is murmur'd out in sighs for thee. A NIGHT THOUGHT. How oft a cloud, with envious veil, Obscures yon bashful light, Which seems so modestly to steal Along the waste of night! 'Tis thus the world's obtrusive wrongs Obscure with malice keen Some timid heart, which only longs To live and die unseen. THE KISS. Grow to my lip, thou sacred kiss, On which my soul's beloved swore That there should come a time of bliss, When she would mock my hopes no more. And fancy shall thy glow renew, In sighs at morn, and dreams at night, And none shall steal thy holy dew Till thou'rt absolv'd by rapture's rite. Sweet hours that are to make me blest, Fly, swift as breezes, to the goal, And let my love, my more than soul Come blushing to this ardent breast. Then, while in every glance I drink The rich o'erflowings of her mind, Oh! let her all enamour'd sink In sweet abandonment resign'd, Blushing for all our struggles past, And murmuring, “I am thine at last!” SONG. [Think on that look whose melting ray] Think on that look whose melting ray For one sweet moment mix'd with mine, And for that moment seem'd to say, “I dare not, or I would be thine!” Think on thy ev'ry smile and glance, On all thou hast to charm and move; And then forgive my bosom's trance, Nor tell me it is sin to love. Oh, not to love thee were the sin; For sure, if Fate's decrees be done, Thou, thou art destin'd still to win, As I am destin'd to be won! THE CATALOGUE. “Come, tell me,” says Rosa, as kissing and kist, One day she reclin'd on my breast; “Come, tell me the number, repeat me the list “Of the nymphs you have lov'd and carest.”— Oh Rosa! 'twas only my fancy that roved, My heart at the moment was free; But I'll tell thee, my girl, how many I've loved, And the number shall finish with thee. My tutor was Kitty; in infancy wild She taught me the way to be blest; She taught me to love her, I lov'd like a child, But Kitty could fancy the rest. This lesson of dear and enrapturing lore I have never forgot, I allow: I have had it by rote very often before, But never by heart until now. Pretty Martha was next, and my soul was all flame, But my head was so full of romance That I fancied her into some chivalry dame, And I was her knight of the lance. But Martha was not of this fanciful school, And she laugh'd at her poor little knight; While I thought her a goddess, she thought me a fool, And I'll swear she was most in the right. My soul was now calm, till, by Cloris's looks, Again I was tempted to rove; But Cloris, I found, was so learned in books That she gave me more logic than love. So I left this young Sappho, and hasten'd to fly To those sweeter logicians in bliss, Who argue the point with a soul-telling eye, And convince us at once with a kiss. Oh! Susan was then all the world unto me, But Susan was piously given; And the worst of it was, we could never agree On the road that was shortest to Heaven. “Oh, Susan!” I've said, in the moments of mirth, “What's devotion to thee or to me? “I devoutly believe there's a heaven on earth, “And believe that that heaven's in thee!” IMITATION OF CATULLUS. TO HIMSELF. Miser Catulle, desinas ineptire, &amp;c. Cease the sighing fool to play; Cease to trifle life away; Nor vainly think those joys thine own, Which all, alas, have falsely flown. What hours, Catullus, once were thine, How fairly seem'd thy day to shine, When lightly thou didst fly to meet The girl whose smile was then so sweet— The girl thou lov'dst with fonder pain Than e'er thy heart can feel again. Ye met—your souls seem'd all in one, Like tapers that commingling shone; Thy heart was warm enough for both, And hers, in truth, was nothing loath. Such were the hours that once were thine; But, ah! those hours no longer shine. For now the nymph delights no more In what she lov'd so much before; And all Catullus now can do, Is to be proud and frigid too; Nor follow where the wanton flies, Nor sue the bliss that she denies. False maid! he bids farewell to thee, To love, and all love's misery; The heyday of his heart is o'er, Nor will he court one favour more. Fly, perjur'd girl!—but whither fly? Who now will praise thy cheek and eye? Who now will drink the syren tone, Which tells him thou art all his own? Oh, none:—and he who lov'd before Can never, never love thee more. [Oh woman, if through sinful wile] “Neither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more!” St. John, chap. viii. Oh woman, if through sinful wile Thy soul hath stray'd from honour's track, 'Tis mercy only can beguile, By gentle ways, the wanderer back. The stain that on thy virtue lies, Wash'd by those tears, not long will stay; As clouds that sully morning skies May all be wept in show'rs away. Go, go, be innocent,—and live; The tongues of men may wound thee sore; But Heav'n in pity can forgive, And bids thee “go, and sin no more!” NONSENSE. Good reader! if you e'er have seen, When Phœbus hastens to his pillow, The mermaids, with their tresses green, Dancing upon the western billow: If you have seen, at twilight dim, When the lone spirit's vesper hymn Floats wild along the winding shore, If you have seen, through mist of eve, The fairy train their ringlets weave, Glancing along the spangled green:— If you have seen all this, and more, God bless me, what a deal you've seen!

Tell me at once if this be true, And I will calm my jealous breast; Will learn to join the dangling crew, And share your simpers with the rest. But if your heart be not so free,— Oh! if another share that heart, Tell not the hateful tale to me, But mingle mercy with your art. I'd rather think you “false as hell,” Than find you to be all divine,— Than know that heart could love so well, Yet know that heart would not be mine! TO PHILLIS.

When, tir'd of life and misery, I wish to sigh my latest breath, Oh, Emma! I will fly to thee, And thou shalt sing me into death. And if along thy lip and cheek That smile of heav'nly softness play, Which,—ah! forgive a mind that's weak,— So oft has stol'n my mind away; Thou'lt seem an angel of the sky, That comes to charm me into bliss: I'll gaze and die—Who would not die, If death were half so sweet as this? ON THE BIRTHDAY OF MRS. ? SONG. WRITTEN IN IRELAND. 1799. Of all my happiest hours of joy, And even I have had my measure, When hearts were full, and ev'ry eye Hath kindled with the light of pleasure, An hour like this I ne'er was given, So full of friendship's purest blisses; Young Love himself looks down from heaven, To smile on such a day as this is. Then come, my friends, this hour improve, Let's feel as if we ne'er could sever; And may the birth of her we love Be thus with joy remember'd ever! Oh! banish ev'ry thought to-night, Which could disturb our soul's communion; Abandon'd thus to dear delight, We'll ev'n for once forget the Union! On that let statesmen try their pow'rs, And tremble o'er the rights they'd die for; The union of the soul be ours, And ev'ry union else we sigh for. Then come, my friends, &amp;c. In ev'ry eye around I mark The feelings of the heart o'erflowing; From ev'ry soul I catch the spark Of sympathy, in friendship glowing. Oh! could such moments ever fly; Oh! that we ne'er were doom'd to lose 'em; And all as bright as Charlotte's eye, And all as pure as Charlotte's bosom. Then come, my friends, &amp;c. For me, whate'er my span of years, Whatever sun may light my roving; Whether I waste my life in tears, Or live, as now, for mirth and loving; This day shall come with aspect kind, Wherever fate may cast your rover; He'll think of those he left behind, And drink a health to bliss that's over! Then come, my friends, &amp;c. SONG. These words were written to the pathetic Scotch air “Galla Water.” [Mary, I believ'd thee true] Mary, I believ'd thee true, And I was blest in thus believing; But know I mourn that e'er I knew A girl so fair and so deceiving. Fare thee well. Few have ever lov'd like me,— Yes, I have lov'd thee too sincerely! And few have e'er deceiv'd like thee,— Alas! deceiv'd me too severely. Fare thee well!—yet think awhile On one whose bosom bleeds to doubt thee; Who now would rather trust that smile, And die with thee than live without thee. Fare thee well! I'll think of thee, Thou leav'st me many a bitter token; For see, distracting woman, see, My peace is gone, my heart is broken!— Fare thee well! MORALITY. A FAMILIAR EPISTLE. ADDRESSED TO J. AT?NS?N, ESQ. M.R.I.A. Though long at school and college dozing, O'er books of verse and books of prosing, And copying from their moral pages Fine recipes for making sages; Though long with those divines at school, Who think to make us good by rule; Who, in methodic forms advancing, Teaching morality like dancing, Tell us, for Heav'n or money's sake, What steps we are through life to take: Though thus, my friend, so long employ'd, With so much midnight oil destroy'd, I must confess, my searches past, I've only learn'd to doubt at last. I find the doctors and the sages Have differ'd in all climes and ages, And two in fifty scarce agree On what is pure morality. 'Tis like the rainbow's shifting zone, And every vision makes its own. The doctors of the Porch advise, As modes of being great and wise, That we should cease to own or know The luxuries that from feeling flow:— “Reason alone must claim direction, “And Apathy's the soul's perfection. “Like a dull lake the heart must lie; “Nor passion's gale nor pleasure's sigh, “Though Heav'n the breeze, the breath, supplied, “Must curl the wave or swell the tide!” Such was the rigid Zeno's plan To form his philosophic man; Such were the modes he taught mankind To weed the garden of the mind; They tore from thence some weeds, 'tis true, But all the flow'rs were ravaged too! Now listen to the wily strains, Which, on Cyrené's sandy plains, When Pleasure, nymph with loosen'd zone, Usurp'd the philosophic throne,— Hear what the courtly sage's Aristippus. tongue To his surrounding pupils sung:— “Pleasure's the only noble end “To which all human pow'rs should tend, “And Virtue gives her heav'nly lore, “But to make Pleasure please us more. “Wisdom and she were both design'd “To make the senses more refin'd, “That man might revel, free from cloying, “Then most a sage when most enjoying!” Is this morality?—Oh, no! Ev'n I a wiser path could show. The flow'r within this vase confin'd, The pure, the unfading flow'r of mind, Must not throw all its sweets away Upon a mortal mould of clay: No, no,—its richest breath should rise In virtue's incense to the skies. But thus it is, all sects we see Have watchwords of morality: Some cry out Venus, others Jove; Here 'tis Religion, there 'tis Love. But while they thus so widely wander, While mystics dream, and doctors ponder; And some, in dialectics firm, Seek virtue in a middle term; While thus they strive, in Heaven's defiance, To chain morality with science; The plain good man, whose actions teach More virtue than a sect can preach, Pursues his course, unsagely blest, His tutor whisp'ring in his breast; Nor could he act a purer part, Though he had Tully all by heart. And when he drops the tear on woe, He little knows or cares to know That Epictetus blam'd that tear, By Heav'n approv'd, to virtue dear! Oh! when I've seen the morning beam Floating within the dimpled stream; While Nature, wak'ning from the night, Has just put on her robes of light, Have I, with cold optician's gaze, Explor'd the doctrine of those rays? No, pedants, I have left to you Nicely to sep'rate hue from hue. Go, give that moment up to art, When Heav'n and nature claim the heart; And, dull to all their best attraction, Go—measure angles of refraction. While I, in feeling's sweet romance, Look on each daybeam as a glance From the great eye of Him above, Wak'ning his world with looks of love! THE TELL-TALE LYRE. I've heard, there was in ancient days A Lyre of most melodious spell; 'Twas heav'n to hear its fairy lays, If half be true that legends tell. 'Twas play'd on by the gentlest sighs, And to their breath it breath'd again In such entrancing melodies As ear had never drunk till then! Not harmony's serenest touch So stilly could the notes prolong; They were not heavenly song so much As they were dreams of heav'nly song! If sad the heart, whose murmuring air Along the chords in languor stole, The numbers it awaken'd there Were eloquence from pity's soul. Or if the sigh, serene and light, Was but the breath of fancied woes, The string, that felt its airy flight, Soon whisper'd it to kind repose. And when young lovers talk'd alone, If, mid their bliss that Lyre was near, It made their accents all its own, And sent forth notes that heav'n might hear. There was a nymph, who long had lov'd, But dar'd not tell the world how well: The shades, where she at evening rov'd, Alone could know, alone could tell. 'Twas there, at twilight time, she stole, When the first star announc'd the night,— With him who claim'd her inmost soul, To wander by that soothing light. It chanc'd that, in the fairy bower Where blest they wooed each other's smile, This Lyre, of strange and magic power. Hung whisp'ring o'er their heads the while. And as, with eyes commingling fire, They listen'd to each other's vow, The youth full oft would make the Lyre A pillow for the maiden's brow: And, while the melting words she breath'd Were by its echoes wafted round, Her locks had with the chords so wreath'd, One knew not which gave forth the sound. Alas, their hearts but little thought, While thus they talk'd the hours away, That every sound the Lyre was taught Would linger long, and long betray. So mingled with its tuneful soul Were all their tender murmurs grown, That other sighs unanswer'd stole, Nor words it breath'd but theirs alone. Unhappy nymph! thy name was sung To every breeze that wander'd by; The secrets of thy gentle tongue Were breath'd in song to earth and sky. The fatal Lyre, by Envy's hand Hung high amid the whisp'ring groves, To every gale by which 'twas fann'd, Proclaimed the mystery of your loves. Nor long thus rudely was thy name To earth's derisive echoes given; Some pitying spirit downward came, And took the Lyre and thee to heaven. There, freed from earth's unholy wrongs, Both happy in Love's home shall be; Thou, uttering nought but seraph songs, And that sweet Lyre still echoing thee! PEACE AND GLORY. WRITTEN ON THE APPROACH OF WAR. Where is now the smile, that lighten'd Every hero's couch of rest? Where is now the hope, that brighten'd Honour's eye and Pity's breast? Have we lost the wreath we braided For our weary warrior men? Is the faithless olive faded? Must the bay be pluck'd again? Passing hour of sunny weather Lovely, in your light awhile, Peace and Glory, wed together, Wander'd through our blessed isle. And the eyes of Peace would glisten, Dewy as a morning sun, When the timid maid would listen To the deeds her chief had done. Is their hour of dalliance over? Must the maiden's trembling feet Waft her from her warlike lover To the desert's still retreat? Fare you well! with sighs we banish Nymph so fair and guests so bright; Yet the smile, with which you vanish, Leaves behind a soothing light;— Soothing light, that long shall sparkle O'er your warrior's sanguin'd way, Through the field where horrors darkle, Shedding hope's consoling ray. Long the smile his heart will cherish, To its absent idol true; While around him myriads perish, Glory still will sigh for you! SONG. [Take back the sigh, thy lips of art] Take back the sigh, thy lips of art In passion's moment breath'd to me; Yet, no—it must not, will not part, 'Tis now the life-breath of my heart, And has become too pure for thee. Take back the kiss, that faithless sigh With all the warmth of truth imprest Yet, no—the fatal kiss may lie, Upon thy lip its sweets would die, Or bloom to make a rival blest. Take back the vows that, night and day, My heart receiv'd, I thought, from thine; Yet, no—allow them still to stay, They might some other heart betray, As sweetly as they've ruin'd mine. LOVE AND REASON. “Quand l'homme commence à raisonner, il cesse de sentir.” J. J. Rousseau. Quoted somewhere in St. Pierre's Etudes de la Nature. 'Twas in the summer time so sweet, When hearts and flowers are both in season, That—who, of all the world, should meet, One early dawn, but Love and Reason! Love told his dream of yesternight, While Reason talked about the weather; The morn, in sooth, was fair and bright, And on they took their way together. The boy in many a gambol flew, While Reason, like a Juno, stalk'd, And from her portly figure threw A lengthen'd shadow, as she walk'd. No wonder Love, as on they pass'd, Should find that sunny morning chill, For still the shadow Reason cast Fell o'er the boy, and cool'd him still. In vain he tried his wings to warm, Or find a pathway not so dim, For still the maid's gigantic form Would stalk between the sun and him. “This must not be,” said little Love— “The sun was made for more than you.” So, turning through a myrtle grove, He bid the portly nymph adieu. Now gaily roves the laughing boy O'er many a mead, by many a stream; In every breeze inhaling joy, And drinking bliss in every beam. From all the gardens, all the bowers, He cull'd the many sweets they shaded, And ate the fruits and smell'd the flowers, Till taste was gone and odour faded. But now the sun, in pomp of noon, Look'd blazing o'er the sultry plains; Alas! the boy grew languid soon, And fever thrill'd through all his veins. The dew forsook his baby brow, No more with healthy bloom he smil'd— Oh! where was tranquil Reason now, To cast her shadow o'er the child? Beneath a green and aged palm, His foot at length for shelter turning, He saw the nymph reclining calm, With brow as cool as his was burning. “Oh! take me to that bosom cold,” In murmurs at her feet he said; And Reason op'd her garment's fold, And flung it round his fever'd head. He felt her bosom's icy touch, And soon it lull'd his pulse to rest; For, ah! the chill was quite too much, And Love expir'd on Reason's breast! [Nay, do not weep, my Fanny dear] Nay, do not weep, my Fanny dear; While in these arms you lie, This world hath not a wish, a fear, That ought to cost that eye a tear, That heart, one single sigh. The world!—ah, Fanny, Love must shun The paths where many rove; One bosom to recline upon, One heart to be his only-one, Are quite enough for Love. What can we wish, that is not here Between your arms and mine? Is there, on earth, a space so dear As that within the happy sphere Two loving arms entwine? For me, there's not a lock of jet Adown your temples curl'd, Within whose glossy, tangling net, My soul doth not, at once, forget All, all this worthless world. Tis in those eyes, so full of love, My only worlds I see; Let but their orbs in sunshine move, And earth below and skies above May frown or smile for me. ASPASIA. 'Twas in the fair Aspasia's bower, That Love and Learning, many an hour, In dalliance met; and Learning smil'd With pleasure on the playful child, Who often stole, to find a nest Within the folds of Learning's vest. There, as the listening statesman hung In transport on Aspasia's tongue, The destinies of Athens took Their colour from Aspasia's look. Oh happy time, when laws of state When all that rul'd the country's fate, Its glory, quiet, or alarms, Was plann'd between two snow-white arms! Blest times! they could not always last— And yet, ev'n now, they are not past. Though we have lost the giant mould, In which their men were cast of old, Woman, dear woman, still the same, While beauty breathes through soul or frame, While man possesses heart or eyes, Woman's bright empire never dies! No, Fanny, love, they ne'er shall say, That beauty's charm hath pass'd away; Give but the universe a soul Attun'd to woman's soft control, And Fanny hath the charm, the skill. To wield a universe at will. THE GRECIAN GIRL'S DREAM OF THE BLESSED ISLANDS. It was imagined by some of the ancients that there is an ethereal ocean above us, and that the sun and moon are two floating, luminous islands, in which the spirits of the blest reside. Accordingly we find that the word ???????, was sometimes synonymous with ???, and death was not unfrequently called ???????? ?????, or “the passage of the ocean.” TO HER LOVER. ???? ?? ????? ?????????, ????? ?? ????? ???????? ??????. ??????? ???? ????????. Oracul. Metric. a Joan. Opsop. collecta. Was it the moon, or was it morning's ray, That call'd thee, dearest, from these arms away? Scarce had'st thou left me, when a dream of night Came o'er my spirit so distinct and bright, That, while I yet can vividly recall Its witching wonders, thou shalt hear them all. Methought I saw, upon the lunar beam, Two winged boys, such as thy muse might dream, Descending from above, at that still hour, And gliding, with smooth step, into my bower. Fair as the beauteous spirits that, all day, In Amatha's warm founts imprison'd stay Eunapius, in his life of Iamblichus, tells us of two beautiful little spirits or loves, which Iamblichus raised by enchantment from the warm springs at Gadara; “dicens astantibus (says the author of the Dii Fatidici, p. 160.) illos esse loci Genios:” which words, however, are not in Eunapius. I find from Cellarius, that Amatha, in the neighbourhood of Gadara, was also celebrated for its warm springs, and I have preferred it as a more poetical name than Gadara. Cellarius quotes Hieronymus. “Est et alia villa in vicinia Gadaræ nomine Amatha, ubi calidæ aquæ erumpunt.” —Geograph. Antiq. lib. iii. cap. 13., But rise at midnight, from th' enchanted rill, To cool their plumes upon some moonlight hill. At once I knew their mission;—'twas to bear My spirit upward, through the paths of air, To that elysian realm, from whence stray beams So oft, in sleep, had visited my dreams. Swift at their touch dissolv'd the ties, that clung All earthly round me, and aloft I sprung; While, heav'nward guides, the little genii flew Thro' paths of light, refresh'd by heaven's own dew, And fann'd by airs still fragrant with the breath Of cloudless climes and worlds that know not death. Thou know'st, that, far beyond our nether sky, And shown but dimly to man's erring eye, A mighty ocean of blue ether rolls This belief of an ocean in the heavens, or “waters above the firmament,” was one of the many physical errors in which the early fathers bewildered themselves. Le P. Baltus, in his “Défense des Saints Pères accusés de Platonisme,” taking it for granted that the ancients were more correct in their notions (which by no means appears from what I have already quoted), adduces the obstinacy of the fathers, in this whimsical opinion, as a proof of their repugnance to even truth from the hands of the philosophers. This is a strange way of defending the fathers, and attributes much more than they deserve to the philosophers. For an abstract of this work of Baltus, (the opposer of Fontenelle, Van Dale, &amp;c. in the famous Oracle controversy,) see “Bibliothèque des Auteurs Ecclésiast. du 180 siècle, part 1. tom. ii.”, Gemm'd with bright islands, where the chosen souls, Who've pass'd in lore and love their earthly hours, Repose for ever in unfading bowers. That very moon, whose solitary light So often guides thee to my bower at night, Is no chill planet, but an isle of love, Floating in splendour through those seas above, And peopled with bright forms, aërial grown, Nor knowing aught of earth but love alone. Thither, I thought, we wing'd our airy way:— Mild o'er its valleys stream'd a silvery day, While, all around, on lily beds of rest, Reclin'd the spirits of the immortal Blest. There were various opinions among the ancients with respect to their lunar establishment; some made it an elysium, and others a purgatory; while some supposed it to be a kind of entrepôt between heaven and earth, where souls which had left their bodies, and those that were on their way to join them, were deposited in the valleys of Hecate, and remained till further orders. ???? ???? ??????? ???? ?????? ????? ?????????, ??? ??? ????? ???? ?????? ??? ??? ????????????????. —Stob. lib. i.

Oh! there I met those few congenial maids, Whom love hath warm'd, in philosophic shades; There still Leontium The pupil and mistress of Epicurus, who called her his “dear little Leontium” (??????????), as appears by a fragment of one of his letters in Laertius. This Leontium was a woman of talent; “she had the impudence (says Cicero) to write against Theophrastus;” and Cicero, at the same time, gives her a name which is neither polite nor translatable. “Meretricula etiam Leontium contra Theophrastum scribere ausa est.” —De Natur. Deor. She left a daughter called Danae, who was just as rigid an Epicurean as her mother; something like Wieland's Danae in Agathon.

Ségur rather fails on the inspiring subject of Aspasia. —“Les Femmes,” tom. i. p. 122. The Author of the “Voyage du Monde de Descartes” has also placed these philosophers in the moon, and has allotted seigneuries to them, as well as to the astronomers (part ii. p. 143.); but he ought not to have forgotten their wives and mistresses; “curæ non ipsâ in morte relinquunt.”, in Aspasia's eyes, Forgot the yoke of less endearing ties; While fair Theano There are some sensible letters extant under the name of this fair Pythagorean.

But think, my Theon, with what joy I thrill'd, When near a fount, which through the valley rill'd, My fancy's eye beheld a form recline, Of lunar race, but so resembling thine That, oh! 'twas but fidelity in me, To fly, to clasp, and worship it for thee. No aid of words the unbodied soul requires, To waft a wish or embassy desires; But by a power, to spirits only given, A deep, mute impulse, only felt in heaven, Swifter than meteor shaft through summer skies, From soul to soul the glanc'd idea flies. Oh, my beloved, how divinely sweet Is the pure joy, when kindred spirits meet! Like him, the river-god The river Alpheus, which flowed by Pisa or Olympia, and into which it was customary to throw offerings of different kinds, during the celebration of the Olympic games. In the pretty romance of Clitophon and Leucippe, the river is supposed to carry these offerings as bridal gifts to the fountain Arethusa. ??? ??? ??? ????????? ???? ??? ??????? ???????????. ???? ??? ? ??? ???????? ?????, ?. ?. ?.

Think, when he meets at last his fountain-bride, What perfect love must thrill the blended tide! Each lost in each, till, mingling into one, Their lot the same for shadow or for sun, A type of true love, to the deep they run. 'Twas thus— But, Theon, 'tis an endless theme, And thou grow'st weary of my half-told dream. Oh would, my love, we were together now, And I would woo sweet patience to thy brow, And make thee smile at all the magic tales Of starlight bowers and planetary vales, Which my fond soul, inspir'd by thee and love, In slumber's loom hath fancifully wove. But no; no more—soon as to-morrow's ray O'er soft Ilissus shall have died away, I'll come, and, while love's planet in the west Shines o'er our meeting, tell thee all the rest. TO CLOE. IMITATED FROM MARTIAL. I could resign that eye of blue, Howe'er its splendour used to thrill me; And ev'n that cheek of roseate hue,— To lose it, Cloe, scarce would kill me. That snowy neck I ne'er should miss, However much I've rav'd about it; And sweetly as that lip can kiss, I think I could exist without it. In short, so well I've learn'd to fast, That, sooth my love, I know not whether I might not bring myself at last, To—do without you altogether. THE WREATH AND THE CHAIN. I bring thee, love, a golden chain, I bring thee too a flowery wreath; The gold shall never wear a stain, The flow'rets long shall sweetly breathe. Come, tell me which the tie shall be, To bind thy gentle heart to me. The Chain is form'd of golden threads, Bright as Minerva's yellow hair, When the last beam of evening sheds Its calm and sober lustre there. The Wreath's of brightest myrtle wove, With sun-lit drops of bliss among it, And many a rose-leaf, cull'd by Love, To heal his lip when bees have stung it. Come, tell me which the tie shall be, To bind thy gentle heart to me. Yes, yes, I read that ready eye, Which answers when the tongue is loath, Thou lik'st the form of either tie, And spread'st thy playful hands for both. Ah!—if there were not something wrong, The world would see them blended oft; The Chain would make the Wreath so strong! The Wreath would make the Chain so soft! Then might the gold, the flow'rets be Sweet fetters for my love and me. But, Fanny, so unblest they twine, That (heaven alone can tell the reason) When mingled thus they cease to shine, Or shine but for a transient season. Whether the Chain may press too much, Or that the Wreath is slightly braided, Let but the gold the flow'rets touch, And all their bloom, their glow is faded! Oh! better to be always free, Than thus to bind my love to me. The timid girl now hung her head, And, as she turn'd an upward glance, I saw a doubt its twilight spread Across her brow's divine expanse. Just then, the garland's brightest rose Gave one of its love-breathing sighs— Oh! who can ask how Fanny chose, That ever look'd in Fanny's eyes? “The Wreath, my life, the Wreath shall be “The tie to bind my soul to thee.” TO ? [And hast thou mark'd the pensive shade] And hast thou mark'd the pensive shade, That many a time obscures my brow, Midst all the joys, beloved maid, Which thou canst give, and only thou? Oh! 'tis not that I then forget The bright looks that before me shine; For never throbb'd a bosom yet Could feel their witchery, like mine. When bashful on my bosom hid, And blushing to have felt so blest, Thou dost but lift thy languid lid, Again to close it on my breast;— Yes,—these are minutes all thine own, Thine own to give, and mine to feel; Yet ev'n in them, my heart has known The sigh to rise, the tear to steal. For I have thought of former hours, When he who first thy soul possess'd, Like me awak'd its witching powers, Like me was lov'd, like me was blest. Upon his name thy murmuring tongue Perhaps hath all as sweetly dwelt; Upon his words thine ear hath hung, With transport all as purely felt. For him—yet why the past recall, To damp and wither present bliss? Thou'rt now my own, heart, spirit, all, And heaven could grant no more than this! Forgive me, dearest, oh! forgive; I would be first, be sole to thee, Thou shouldst have but begun to live, The hour that gave thy heart to me. Thy book of life till then effac'd, Love should have kept that leaf alone On which he first so brightly trac'd That thou wert, soul and all, my own. TO ?'S PICTURE. Go then, if she, whose shade thou art, No more will let thee soothe my pain; Yet, tell her, it has cost this heart Some pangs, to give thee back again Tell her, the smile was not so dear, With which she made thy semblance mine, As bitter is the burning tear, With which I now the gift resign. Yet go—and could she still restore, As some exchange for taking thee, The tranquil look which first I wore, When her eyes found me calm and free; Could she give back the careless flow, The spirit that my heart then knew— Yet, no, 'tis vain—go, picture, go— Smile at me once, and then—adieu!

Love and Psyche are here considered as the active and passive principles of creation, and the universe is supposed to have received its first harmonizing impulse from the nuptial sympathy between these two powers. A marriage is generally the first step in cosmogony. Timæus held Form to be the father, and Matter the mother of the World; Elion and Berouth, I think, are Sanchoniatho's first spiritual lovers, and Manco-capac and his wife introduced creation amongst the Peruvians. In short, Harlequin seems to have studied cosmogonies, when he said “tutto il mondo è fatto come la nostra famiglia.” Blest infant of eternity! Before the day-star learn'd to move, In pomp of fire, along his grand career, Glancing the beamy shafts of light From his rich quiver to the farthest sphere, Thou wert alone, oh Love! Nestling beneath the wings of ancient Night, Whose horrors seem'd to smile in shadowing thee. No form of beauty sooth'd thine eye, As through the dim expanse it wander'd wide; No kindred spirit caught thy sigh, As o'er the watery waste it lingering died. Unfelt the pulse, unknown the power, That latent in his heart was sleeping,— Oh Sympathy! that lonely hour Saw Love himself thy absence weeping. But look, what glory through the darkness beams! Celestial airs along the water glide:— What Spirit art thou, moving o'er the tide So beautiful? oh, not of earth, But, in that glowing hour, the birth Of the young Godhead's own creative dreams. 'Tis she! Psyche, the firstborn spirit of the air. To thee, oh Love, she turns, On thee her eyebeam burns: Blest hour, before all worlds ordain'd to be! They meet— The blooming god—the spirit fair Meet in communion sweet. Now, Sympathy, the hour is thine; All nature feels the thrill divine, The veil of Chaos is withdrawn, And their first kiss is great Creation's dawn! TO HIS SERENE HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF MONTPENSIER, ON HIS PORTRAIT OF THE LADY ADELAIDE FORBES. Donington Park, 1802. To catch the thought, by painting's spell, Howe'er remote, howe'er refin'd, And o'er the kindling canvass tell The silent story of the mind; O'er nature's form to glance the eye, And fix, by mimic light and shade, Her morning tinges, ere they fly, Her evening blushes, ere they fade;— Yes, these are Painting's proudest powers; The gift, by which her art divine Above all others proudly towers,— And these, oh Prince! are richly thine. And yet, when Friendship sees thee trace, In almost living truth exprest, This bright memorial of a face On which her eye delights to rest; While o'er the lovely look serene, The smile of peace, the bloom of youth, The cheek, that blushes to be seen, The eye that tells the bosom's truth; While o'er each line, so brightly true, Our eyes with lingering pleasure rove, Blessing the touch whose various hue Thus brings to mind the form we love; We feel the magic of thy art, And own it with a zest, a zeal, A pleasure, nearer to the heart Than critic taste can ever feel. THE FALL OF HEBE. A DITHYRAMBIC ODE. Though I have styled this poem a Dithyrambic Ode, I cannot presume to say that it possesses, in any degree, the characteristics of that species of poetry. The nature of the ancient Dithyrambic is very imperfectly known. According to M. Burette, a licentious irregularity of metre, an extravagant research of thought and expression, and a rude embarrassed construction, are among its most distinguishing features; and in all these respects, I have but too closely, I fear, followed my models. Burette adds, “Ces caractères des dityrambes se font sentir à ceux qui lisent attentivement les odes de Pindare.” —Mémoires de l'Acad. vol. x. p. 306. The same opinion may be collected from Schmidt's dissertation upon the subject. I think, however, if the Dithyrambics of Pindar were in our possession, we should find that, however wild and fanciful, they were by no means the tasteless jargon they are represented, and that even their irregularity was what Boileau calls “un beau désordre.” Chiabrera, who has been styled the Pindar of Italy, and from whom all its poetry upon the Greek model was called Chiabreresco (as Crescimbeni informs us, lib. i. cap. 12.), has given, amongst his Vendemmie, a Dithyrambic, “all' uso de' Greci;” full of those compound epithets, which, we are told, were a chief characteristic of the style (????????? ?? ?????? ??????? —Suid. ????????????.); such as Briglindorato Pegaso Nubicalpestator. But I cannot suppose that Pindar, even amidst all the licence of dithyrambics, would ever have descended to ballad-language like the following: Bella Filli, e bella Clori, Non più dar pregio a tue bellezze e taci, Che se Bacco fa vezzi alle mie labbra Fo le fiche a' vostri baci. ? esser vorrei Coppier, E se troppo desiro Deh fossi io Bottiglier. Rime del Chiabrera, part ii. p. 352. 'Twas on a day When the immortals at their banquet lay; The bowl Sparkled with starry dew, The weeping of those myriad urns of light, Within whose orbs, the almighty Power, At nature's dawning hour, Stor'd the rich fluid of ethereal soul. This is a Platonic fancy. The philosopher supposes, in his Timæus, that, when the Deity had formed the soul of the world, he proceeded to the composition of other souls, in which process, says Plato, he made use of the same cup, though the ingredients he mingled were not quite so pure as for the former; and having refined the mixture with a little of his own essence, he distributed it among the stars, which served as reservoirs of the fluid.—????? ???? ??? ????? ??? ??? ???????? ??????? ?? ? ??? ??? ?????? ????? ???????? ??????, ?. ?. ?. Around, Soft odorous clouds, that upward wing their flight From eastern isles (Where they have bath'd them in the orient ray, And with rich fragrance all their bosoms fill'd), In circles flew, and, melting as they flew, A liquid daybreak o'er the board distill'd. All, all was luxury! All must be luxury, where Lyæus smiles. His locks divine Were crown'd With a bright meteor-braid, Which, like an ever-springing wreath of vine, Shot into brilliant leafy shapes, And o'er his brow in lambent tendrils play'd: While mid the foliage hung, Like lucid grapes, A thousand clustering buds of light, Cull'd from the gardens of the galaxy. Upon his bosom Cytherea's head Lay lovely, as when first the Syrens sung Her beauty's dawn, And all the curtains of the deep, undrawn, Reveal'd her sleeping in its azure bed. The captive deity Hung lingering on her eyes and lip, With looks of ecstasy. Now, on his arm, In blushes she repos'd, And, while he gazed on each bright charm, To shade his burning eyes her hand in dalliance stole. And now she rais'd her rosy mouth to sip The nectar'd wave Lyæus gave, And from her eyelids, half-way clos'd, Sent forth a melting gleam, Which fell, like sun-dew, in the bowl: While her bright hair, in mazy flow Of gold descending Adown her cheek's luxurious glow, Hung o'er the goblet's side, And was reflected in its crystal tide, Like a bright crocus flower, Whose sunny leaves, at evening hour With roses of Cyrene blending We learn from Theophrastus, that the roses of Cyrene were particularly fragrant.—???????? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?????? ????., Hang o'er the mirror of some silvery stream.

Scip. lib. i. cap. 14.; And still As the resplendent rill Gushed forth into the cup with mantling heat, Her watchful care Was still to cool its liquid fire With snow-white sprinklings of that feathery air The children of the Pole respire, In those enchanted lands The country of the Hyperboreans. These people were supposed to be placed so far north that the north wind could not affect them; they lived longer than any other mortals; passed their whole time in music and dancing, &amp;c. &amp;c. But the most extravagant fiction related of them is that to which the two lines preceding allude. It was imagined that, instead of our vulgar atmosphere, the Hyperboreans breathed nothing but feathers! According to Herodotus and Pliny, this idea was suggested by the quantity of snow which was observed to fall in those regions; thus the former: ?? ?? ????? ?????????? ??? ????? ???? ?????? ?? ??? ???? ?????????? ????? ??????. —Herodot. lib. iv. cap. 31. Ovid tells the fable otherwise: see Metamorph. lib. xv. Mr. O'Halloran, and some other Irish Antiquarians, have been at great expense of learning to prove that the strange country, where they took snow for feathers, was Ireland, and that the famous Abaris was an Irish Druid. Mr. Rowland, however, will have it that Abaris was a Welshman, and that his name is only a corruption of Ap Rees!, Where life is all a spring, and north winds never blow. But oh! Bright Hebe, what a tear, And what a blush were thine, When, as the breath of every Grace Wafted thy feet along the studded sphere, With a bright cup for Jove himself to drink, Some star, that shone beneath thy tread, Raising its amorous head To kiss those matchless feet, Check'd thy career too fleet; And all heaven's host of eyes Entranc'd, but fearful all, Saw thee, sweet Hebe, prostrate fall Upon the bright floor of the azure skies It is Servius, I believe, who mentions this unlucky trip which Hebe made in her occupation of cup-bearer; and Hoffman tells it after him: “Cum Hebe pocula Jovi administrans, perque lubricum minus cauté incedens, cecidisset,” &amp;c.; Where, mid its stars, thy beauty lay, As blossom, shaken from the spray Of a spring thorn Lies mid the liquid sparkles of the morn. Or, as in temples of the Paphian shade, The worshippers of Beauty's queen behold An image of their rosy idol, laid Upon a diamond shrine. The wanton wind, Which had pursued the flying fair, And sported mid the tresses unconfined Of her bright hair, Now, as she fell,—oh wanton breeze! Ruffled the robe, whose graceful flow Hung o'er those limbs of unsunn'd snow, Purely as the Eleusinian veil Hangs o'er the Mysteries! The arcane symbols of this ceremony were deposited in the cista, where they lay religiously concealed from the eyes of the profane. They were generally carried in the procession by an ass; and hence the proverb, which one may so often apply in the world, “asinus portat mysteria.” See the Divine Legation, book ii. sect. 4. The brow of Juno flush'd— Love bless'd the breeze! The Muses blush'd; And every cheek was hid behind a lyre, While every eye looked laughing through the strings. But the bright cup? the nectar'd draught Which Jove himself was to have quaff'd? Alas, alas, upturn'd it lay By the fall'n Hebe's side; While, in slow lingering drops, th' ethereal tide, As conscious of its own rich essence, ebb'd away. Who was the Spirit that remember'd Man, In that blest hour, And, with a wing of love, Brush'd off the goblet's scatter'd tears, As, trembling near the edge of heaven they ran, And sent them floating to our orb below? In the Geoponica, lib. ii. cap. 17., there is a fable somewhat like this descent of the nectar to earth. ?? ?????? ??? ???? ???????????, ??? ??? ???????? ?????? ????????????, ???????????? ?????? ??? ????? ??? ????????? ?? ????? ??? ???????? ??? ?????, ??? ?????????? ??? ?????? ?? ?? ?????? ??? ??? ??? ???????, ?. ?. ?.

The shower Fell glowing through the spheres; While all around new tints of bliss, New odours and new light, Enrich'd its radiant flow. Now, with a liquid kiss, It stole along the thrilling wire Of Heaven's luminous Lyre The constellation Lyra. The astrologers attribute great virtues to this sign in ascendenti, which are enumerated by Pontano, in his Urania: ? Ecce novem cum pectine chordas Emodulans, mulcetque novo vaga sidera cantu, Quo captæ nascentum animæ concordia ducunt Pectora, &amp;c., Stealing the soul of music in its flight: And now, amid the breezes bland, That whisper from the planets as they roll, The bright libation, softly fann'd By all their sighs, meandering stole.

See also his Treatise de Isid. et Osir. Observing that the lotos showed its head above water at sunrise, and sank again at his setting, they conceived the idea of consecrating this flower to Osiris, or the sun. This symbol of a youth sitting upon a lotos is very frequent on the Abraxases, or Basilidian stones. See Montfaucon, tom. ii. planche 158., and the “Supplement,” &amp;c. tom. ii. lib. vii. chap. 5.; When round him, in profusion weeping, Dropp'd the celestial shower, Steeping The rosy clouds, that curl'd About his infant head, Like myrrh upon the locks of Cupid shed. But, when the waking boy Wav'd his exhaling tresses through the sky, O morn of joy!— The tide divine, All glorious with the vermil dye It drank beneath his orient eye, Distill'd, in dews, upon the world, And every drop was wine, was heavenly wine! Blest be the sod, and blest the flower On which descended first that shower, All fresh from Jove's nectareous springs;— Oh far less sweet the flower, the sod, O'er which the Spirit of the Rainbow flings The magic mantle of her solar God! The ancients esteemed those flowers and trees the sweetest upon which the rainbow had appeared to rest; and the wood they chiefly burned in sacrifices, was that which the smile of Iris had consecrated.

ON HER SINGING. I more than once have heard, at night, A song, like those thy lip hath given, And it was sung by shapes of light, Who look'd and breath'd, like thee, of heaven. But this was all a dream of sleep, And I have said, when morning shone, “Why should the night-witch, Fancy, keep “These wonders for herself alone?” I knew not then that fate had lent Such tones to one of mortal birth; I knew not then that Heaven had sent A voice, a form like thine on earth. And yet, in all that flowery maze Through which my path of life has led, When I have heard the sweetest lays From lips of rosiest lustre shed; When I have felt the warbled word From Beauty's lip, in sweetness vying With music's own melodious bird, When on the rose's bosom lying; Though form and song at once combin'd Their loveliest bloom and softest thrill, My heart hath sigh'd, my ear hath pin'd For something lovelier, softer still:— Oh, I have found it all, at last, In thee, thou sweetest living lyre, Through which the soul of song e'er pass'd, Or feeling breath'd its sacred fire. All that I e'er, in wildest flight Of fancy's dreams, could hear or see Of music's sigh or beauty's light Is realiz'd, at once, in thee! IMPROMPTU, ON LEAVING SOME FRIENDS. O dulces comitum valete cœtus! Catullus. No, never shall my soul forget The friends I found so cordial-hearted; Dear shall be the day we met, And dear shall be the night we parted. If fond regrets, however sweet, Must with the lapse of time decay, Yet still, when thus in mirth you meet, Fill high to him that's far away! Long be the light of memory found Alive within your social glass; Let that be still the magic round, O'er which Oblivion dares not pass. A WARNING. TO ? Oh fair as heaven and chaste as light! Did nature mould thee all so bright, That thou shouldst e'er be brought to weep O'er languid virtue's fatal sleep, O'er shame extinguish'd, honour fled, Peace lost, heart wither'd, feeling dead? No, no! a star was born with thee, Which sheds eternal purity. Thou hast, within those sainted eyes, So fair a transcript of the skies, In lines of light such heavenly lore, That man should read them and adore. Yet have I known a gentle maid Whose mind and form were both array'd In nature's purest light, like thine;— Who wore that clear, celestial sign, Which seems to mark the brow that's fair For destiny's peculiar care: Whose bosom too, like Dian's own, Was guarded by a sacred zone, Where the bright gem of virtue shone; Whose eyes had, in their light, a charm Against all wrong, and guile, and harm. Yet, hapless maid, in one sad hour, These spells have lost their guardian power; The gem has been beguil'd away; Her eyes have lost their chastening ray; The modest pride, the guiltless shame, The smiles that from reflection came, All, all have fled, and left her mind A faded monument behind; The ruins of a once pure shrine, No longer fit for guest divine. Oh! 'twas a sight I wept to see— Heaven keep the lost one's fate from thee! TO ? ['Tis time, I feel, to leave thee now] 'Tis time, I feel, to leave thee now, While yet my soul is something free; While yet those dangerous eyes allow One minute's thought to stray from thee. Oh! thou becom'st each moment dearer; Every chance that brings me nigh thee, Brings my ruin nearer, nearer,— I am lost, unless I fly thee. Nay, if thou dost not scorn and hate me, Doom me not thus so soon to fall; Duties, fame, and hopes await me,— But that eye would blast them all! For, thou hast heart as false and cold As ever yet allur'd or sway'd, And couldst, without a sigh, behold The ruin which thyself had made. Yet,—could I think that, truly fond, That eye but once would smile on me, Ev'n as thou art, how far beyond Fame, duty, wealth, that smile would be! Oh! but to win it, night and day, Inglorious at thy feet reclin'd, I'd sigh my dreams of fame away, The world for thee forgot, resign'd. But no, 'tis o'er, and—thus we part, Never to meet again,—no, never. False woman, what a mind and heart Thy treachery has undone for ever! WOMAN. Away, away—you're all the same, A smiling, fluttering, jilting throng; And, wise too late, I burn with shame, To think I've been your slave so long. Slow to be won, and quick to rove, From folly kind, from cunning loath, Too cold for bliss, too weak for love, Yet feigning all that's best in both; Still panting o'er a crowd to reign,— More joy it gives to woman's breast To make ten frigid coxcombs vain, Than one true, manly lover blest. Away, away—your smile's a curse— Oh! blot me from the race of men, Kind pitying Heaven, by death or worse, If e'er I love such things again. TO ?

Let me but see that snowy arm Once more upon the dear harp lie, And I will cease to dream of harm, Will smile at fate, while thou art nigh. Give me that strain of mournful touch, We us'd to love long, long ago, Before our hearts had known as much As now, alas! they bleed to know. Sweet notes! they tell of former peace, Of all that look'd so smiling then, Now vanish'd, lost—oh pray thee, cease, I cannot bear those sounds again. Art thou, too, wretched? yes, thou art; I see thy tears flow fast with mine— Come, come to this devoted heart, 'Tis breaking, but it still is thine! A VISION OF PHILOSOPHY.

See the extracts made by Bayle, in his article, Cham. The identity of Cham and Zoroaster depends upon the authority of Berosus (or rather the impostor Annius), and a few more such respectable testimonies.

Sacr. lib. iv. cap. 1. sink Beneath the waters, which ingulph'd a world!— Of visions, by Calliope reveal'd To him Orpheus.—Paulinus, in his Hebdomades, cap. 2. lib. iii. has endeavoured to show, after the Platonists, that man is a diapason, or octave, made up of a diatesseron, which is his soul, and a diapente, which is his body. Those frequent allusions to music, by which the ancient philosophers illustrated their sublime theories, must have tended very much to elevate the character of the art, and to enrich it with associations of the grandest and most interesting nature. See a preceding note, for their ideas upon the harmony of the spheres. Heraclitus compared the mixture of good and evil in this world, to the blended varieties of harmony in a musical instrument (Plutarch. de Animæ Procreat.); and Euryphamus, the Pythagorean, in a fragment preserved by Stobæus, describes human life, in its perfection, as a sweet and well tuned lyre. Some of the ancients were so fanciful as to suppose that the operations of the memory were regulated by a kind of musical cadence, and that ideas occurred to it “per arsin et thesin,” while others converted the whole man into a mere harmonized machine, whose motion depended upon a certain tension of the body, analogous to that of the strings in an instrument. Cicero indeed ridicules Aristoxenus for this fancy, and says, “Let him teach singing, and leave philosophy to Aristotle;” but Aristotle himself, though decidedly opposed to the harmonic speculations of the Pythagoreans and Platonists, could sometimes condescend to enliven his doctrines by reference to the beauties of musical science; as, in the treatise ???? ?????? attributed to him, ??????? ?? ?? ????, ????????? ???????????, ?. ?. ?. The Abbé Batteux, in his enquiry into the doctrine of the Stoics, attributes to those philosophers the same mode of illustration. “L'âme étoit cause active ?????? ??????; le corps cause passive ??? ??? ???????:—l'une agissant dans l'autre; et y prenant, par son action même, un caractère, des formes, des modifications, qu'elle n'avoit pas par elle-même; à peu près comme l'air, qui, chassé dans un instrument de musique, fait connoître, par les différens sons qu'il produit, les différentes modifications qu'il y reçoit.” See a fine simile founded upon this notion in Cardinal Polignac's poem, lib 5. v.734., who trac'd upon his typic lyre The diapason of man's mingled frame, And the grand Doric heptachord of heaven. With all of pure, of wondrous and arcane, Which the grave sons of Mochus, many a night, Told to the young and bright-hair'd visitant Of Carmel's sacred mount. Phythagoras is represented in Iamblichus as descending with great solemnity from Mount Carmel, for which reason the Carmelites have claimed him as one of their fraternity. This Mochus or Moschus, with the descendants of whom Phythagoras conversed in Phœnicia, and from whom he derived the doctrines of atomic philosophy, is supposed by some to be the same with Moses. Huett has adopted this idea, Démonstration Evangélique, Prop. iv. chap. 2. § 7.; and Le Clerc, amongst others, has refuted it. See Biblioth. Choisie, tom. i. p. 75. It is certain, however, that the doctrine of atoms was known and promulgated long before Epicurus. “With the fountains of Democritus,” says Cicero, “the gardens of Epicurus were watered;” and the learned author of the Intellectual System has shown, that all the early philosophers, till the time of Plato, were atomists. We find Epicurus, however, boasting that his tenets were new and unborrowed, and perhaps few among the ancients had any stronger claim to originality. In truth, if we examine their schools of philosophy, notwithstanding the peculiarities which seem to distinguish them from each other, we may generally observe that the difference is but verbal and trifling; and that, among those various and learned heresies, there is scarcely one to be selected, whose opinions are its own, original and exclusive. The doctrine of the world's eternity may be traced through all the sects. The continual metempsychosis of Pythagoras, the grand periodic year of the Stoics, (at the conclusion of which the universe is supposed to return to its original order, and commence a new revolution,) the successive dissolution and combination of atoms maintained by the Epicureans—all these tenets are but different intimations of the same general belief in the eternity of the world. As explained by St. Austin, the periodic year of the Stoics disagrees only so far with the idea of the Pythagoreans, that instead of an endless transmission of the soul through a variety of bodies, it restores the same body and soul to repeat their former round of existence, so that the “identical Plato, who lectured in the Academy of Athens, shall again and again, at certain intervals, during the lapse of eternity, appear in the same Academy and resume the same functions—” ? sic eadem tempora temporaliumque rerum volumina repeti, ut v. g. sicut in isto sæculo Plato philosophus in urbe Atheniensi, in eâ scholâ quæ Academia dicta est, discipulos docuit, ita per innumerabilia retro sæcula, multum plexis quidem intervallis, sed certis, et idem Plato, et eadem civitas, eademque schola, iidemque discipuli repetiti et per innumerabilia deinde sæcula repetendi sint. —De Civitat. Dei, lib. xii. cap. 13. Vanini, in his dialogues, has given us a similar explication of the periodic revolutions of the world. “Eâ de causâ, qui nunc sunt in usu ritus, centies millies fuerunt, totiesque renascentur quoties ceciderunt.” 52. The paradoxical notions of the Stoics upon the beauty, the riches, the dominion of their imaginary sage, are among the most distinguishing characteristics of their school, and, according to their advocate Lipsius, were peculiar to that sect. “Priora illa (decreta) quæ passim in philosophantium scholis ferè obtinent, ista quæ peculiaria huic sectæ et habent contradictionem: i. e. paradoxa.” —Manuduct. ad Stoic. Philos. lib. iii. dissertat. 2. But it is evident (as the Abbé Garnier has remarked, Mémoires de l'Acad. tom. xxxv.) that even these absurdities of the Stoics are borrowed, and that Plato is the source of all their extravagant paradoxes. We find their dogma, “dives qui sapiens,” (which Clement of Alexandria has transferred from the Philosopher to the Christian, Pædagog. lib. iii. cap. 6.) expressed in the prayer of Socrates at the end of the Phædrus. ? ???? ??? ?? ??? ????? ???? ???? ????, ?????? ??? ???? ???????? ????????? ??????? ?? ??? ???, ???? ????? ????? ??? ?????? ???????? ?? ????????? ??? ?????. And many other instances might be adduced from the ??????????, the ?????????, &amp;c. to prove that these weeds of paradox were all gathered among the bowers of the Academy. Hence it is that Cicero, in the preface to his Paradoxes, calls them Socratica; and Lipsius, exulting in the patronage of Socrates, says “Ille totus est noster.” This is indeed a coalition, which evinces as much as can be wished the confused similitude of ancient philosophical opinions: the father of scepticism is here enrolled amongst the founders of the Portico; he, whose best knowledge was that of his own ignorance, is called in to authorise the pretensions of the most obstinate dogmatists in all antiquity. Rutilius, in his Itinerarium, has riduculed the sabbath of the Jews, as “lassati mollis imago Dei;” but Epicurus gave an eternal holyday to his gods, and, rather than disturb the slumbers of Olympus, denied at once the interference of a Providence. He does not, however, seem to have been singular in this opinion. Theophilus of Antioch, if he deserve any credit, imputes a similar belief to Pythagoras:—???? (?????????) ?? ??? ?????? ????? ???????? ????? ??????????. And Plutarch, though so hostile to the followers of Epicurus, has unaccountably adopted the very same theological error. Thus, after quoting the opinions of Anaxagoras and Plato upon divinity, he adds, ?????? ??? ???????????? ?????????. ??? ??? ???? ???????? ????????????? ??? ??????????. —De Placit. Philosoph. lib. i. cap. 7. Plato himself has attributed a degree of indifference to the gods, which is not far removed from the apathy of Epicurus's heaven; as thus, in his Philebus, where Protarchus asks, ?????? ????? ?? ???? ??????? ?????, ???? ?? ????????; and Socrates answers, ???? ??? ??? ?????, ??????? ???? ????? ???????? ?????????? ?????;—while Aristotle supposes a still more absurd neutrality, and concludes, by no very flattering analogy, that the deity is as incapable of virtue as of vice. ??? ??? ????? ????? ?????? ???? ?????, ???? ?????, ????? ???? ????. —Ethic. Nicomach. lib. vii. cap. 1. In truth, Aristotle, upon the subject of Providence, was little more correct than Epicurus. He supposed the moon to be the limit of divine interference, excluding of course this sublunary world from its influence. The first definition of the world, in his treatise ???? ?????? (if this treatise be really the work of Aristotle) agrees, almost verbum verbo, with that in the letter of Epicurus to Pythocles; and both omit the mention of a deity. In his Ethics, too, he intimates a doubt whether the gods feel any interest in the concerns of mankind.—?? ??? ??? ????????? ??? ?????????? ??? ???? ???????. It is true, he adds ????? ?????, but even this is very sceptical. In these erroneous conceptions of Aristotle, we trace the cause of that general neglect which his philosophy experienced among the early Christians. Plato is seldom much more orthodox, but the obscure enthusiasm of his style allowed them to accommodate all his fancies to their own purpose. Such glowing steel was easily moulded, and Platonism became a sword in the hands of the fathers. The Providence of the Stoics, so vaunted in their school, was a power as contemptibly inefficient as the rest. All was fate in the system of the Portico. The chains of destiny were thrown over Jupiter himself, and their deity was like the Borgia of the epigrammatist, “et Cæsar et nihil.” Not even the language of Seneca can reconcile this degradation of divinity. “Ille ipse omnium conditor ac rector scripsit quidam fata, sed sequitur; semper paret, semel jussit.” —Lib. de Providentiâ, cap. 5. With respect to the difference between the Stoics, Peripatetics, and Academicians, the following words of Cicero prove that he saw but little to distinguish them from each other:— “Peripateticos et Academicos, nominibus differentes, re congruentes; a quibus Stoici ipsi verbis magis quam sententiis dissenserunt.” —Academic. lib. ii. 5.; and perhaps what Reid has remarked upon one of their points of controversy might be applied as effectually to the reconcilement of all the rest. “The dispute between the Stoics and Peripatetics was probably all for want of definition. The one said they were good under the control of reason, the other that they should be eradicated.” —Essay, vol. iii. In short, it appears a no less difficult matter to establish the boundaries of opinion between any two of the philosophical sects, than it would be to fix the landmarks of those estates in the moon, which Ricciolus so generously allotted to his brother astronomers. Accordingly we observe some of the greatest men of antiquity passing without scruple from school to school, according to the fancy or convenience of the moment. Cicero, the father of Roman philosophy, is sometimes an Academician, sometimes a Stoic; and, more than once, he acknowledges a conformity with Epicurus; “non sine causa igitur Epicurus ausus est dicere semper in pluribus bonis esse sapientem, quia semper sit in voluptatibus.” —Tusculan. Quæst. lib. v. Though often pure in his theology, Cicero sometimes smiles at futurity as a fiction; thus, in his Oration for Cluentius, speaking of punishments in the life to come, he says, “Quæ si falsa sunt, id quod omnes intelligunt, quid ei tandem aliud mors eripuit, præter sensum doloris?”:—though here we should, perhaps, do him but justice by agreeing with his commentator Sylvius, who remarks upon this passage, “Hæc autem dixit, ut causæ suæ subserviret.” The poet, Horace, roves like a butterfly through the schools, and now wings along the walls of the Porch, now basks among the flowers of the Garden; while Virgil, with a tone of mind strongly philosophical, has yet left us wholly uncertain as to the sect which he espoused. The balance of opinion declares him to have been an Epicurean, but the ancient author of his life asserts that he was an Academician; and we trace through his poetry the tenets of almost all the leading sects. The same kind of eclectic indifference is observable in most of the Roman writers. Thus Propertius, in the fine elegy to Cynthia, on his departure for Athens, Illic vel studiis animum emendare Platonis, Incipiam, aut hortis, docte Epicure, tuis. Lib. iii. Eleg. 21. Though Broeckhusius here reads, “dux Epicure,” which seems to fix the poet under the banners of Epicurus. Even the Stoic Seneca, whose doctrines have been considered so orthodox, that St. Jerome has ranked him amongst the ecclesiastical writers, while Boccaccio doubts (in consideration of his supposed correspondence with St. Paul) whether Dante should have placed him in Limbo with the rest of the Pagans —even the rigid Seneca has bestowed such commendations on Epicurus, that if only those passages of his works were preserved to us, we could not hesitate, I think, in pronouncing him a confirmed Epicurean. With similar inconsistency, we find Porphyry, in his work upon abstinence, referring to Epicurus as an example of the most strict Pythagorean temperance; and Lancelotti (the author of “Farfalloni degli antici Istorici”) has been seduced by this grave reputation of Epicurus into the absurd error of associating him with Chrysippus, as a chief of the Stoic school. There is no doubt, indeed, that however the Epicurean sect might have relaxed from its original purity, the morals of its founder were as correct as those of any among the ancient philosophers; and his doctrines upon pleasure, as explained in the letter to Menœceus, are rational, amiable, and consistent with our nature. A late writer, De Sablons, in his Grands Hommes venés, expresses strong indignation against the Encyclopédistes for their just and animated praises of Epicurus, and discussing the question, “si ce philosophe étoit vertueux,” denies it upon no other authority than the calumnies collected by Plutarch, who himself confesses that, on this particular subject, he consulted only opinion and report, without pausing to investigate their truth.—???? ??? ?????, ?? ??? ???????? ?????????. To the factious zeal of his illiberal rivals, the Stoics, Epicurus chiefly owed these gross misrepresentations of the life and opinions of himself and his associates, which, notwithstanding the learned exertions of Gassendi, have still left an odium on the name of his philosophy; and we ought to examine the ancient accounts of this philosopher with about the same degree of cautious belief which, in reading ecclesiastical history, we yield to the invectives of the fathers against the heretics,—trusting as little to Plutarch upon a dogma of Epicurus, as we would to the vehement St. Cyril upon a tenet of Nestorius. (1801.) The preceding remarks, I wish the reader to observe, were written at a time, when I thought the studies to which they refer much more important as well as more amusing than, I freely confess, they appear to me at present.—Then, in a flow Of calmer converse, he beguil'd us on Through many a maze of Garden and of Porch, Through many a system, where the scatter'd light Of heavenly truth lay, like a broken beam From the pure sun, which, though refracted all Into a thousand hues, is sunshine still Lactantius asserts that all the truths of Christianity may be found dispersed through the ancient philosophical sects, and that any one who would collect these scattered fragments of orthodoxy might form a code in no respect differing from that of the Christian. “Si extitisset aliquis, qui veritatem sparsam per singulos per sectasque diffusam colligeret in unum, ac redigeret in corpus, is profecto non dissentiret a nobis.” —Inst. lib. vi. c. 7., And bright through every change!—he spoke of Him, The lone To ?? ????? ??? ??????., eternal One, who dwells above, And of the soul's untraceable descent From that high fount of spirit, through the grades Of intellectual being, till it mix With atoms vague, corruptible, and dark; Nor yet ev'n then, though sunk in earthly dross, Corrupted all, nor its ethereal touch Quite lost, but tasting of the fountain still. As some bright river, which has roll'd along Through meads of flowery light and mines of gold, When pour'd at length into the dusky deep, Disdains to take at once its briny taint, But keeps unchanged awhile the lustrous tinge, Or balmy freshness, of the scenes it left. This bold Platonic image I have taken from a passage in Father Bouchet's letter upon the Metempsychosis, inserted in Picart's Cérém. Relig. tom. iv. And here the old man ceased—a winged train Of nymphs and genii bore him from our eyes. The fair illusion fled! and, as I wak'd, 'Twas clear that my rapt soul had roamed, the while, To that bright realm of dreams, that spirit-world, Which mortals know by its long track of light O'er midnight's sky, and call the Galaxy. According to Pythagoras, the people of Dreams are souls collected together in the Galaxy.—????? ?? ???????, ???? ?????????, ?? ????? ?? ?????????? ????? ??? ??? ????????. —Porphyr. de Antro Nymph.

To see thee every day that came, And find thee still each day the same; In pleasure's smile, or sorrow's tear To me still ever kind and dear;— To meet thee early, leave thee late, Has been so long my bliss, my fate, That life, without this cheering ray, Which came, like sunshine, every day, And all my pain, my sorrow chas'd, Is now a lone and loveless waste. Where are the chords she us'd to touch? The airs, the songs she lov'd so much? Those songs are hush'd, those chords are still, And so, perhaps, will every thrill Of feeling soon be lull'd to rest, Which late I wak'd in Anna's breast. Yet, no—the simple notes I play'd From memory's tablet soon may fade; The songs, which Anna lov'd to hear, May vanish from her heart and ear; But friendship's voice shall ever find An echo in that gentle mind, Nor memory lose nor time impair The sympathies that tremble there. TO LADY HEATHCOTE, ON AN OLD RING FOUND AT TUNBRIDGE-WELLS. “Tunnebridge est à la même distance de Londres, que Fontainebleau l'est de Paris. Ce qu'il y a de beau et de galant dans l'un et dans l'autre sexe s'y rassemble au tems des eaux. La compagnie,” &amp;c. &amp;c. See Mémoires de Grammont, Second Part. chap. iii. Tunbridge Wells. When Grammont grac'd these happy springs, And Tunbridge saw, upon her Pantiles, The merriest wight of all the kings That ever rul'd these gay, gallant isles; Like us, by day, they rode, they walk'd, At eve, they did as we may do, And Grammont just like Spencer talk'd, And lovely Stewart smil'd like you. The only different trait is this, That woman then, if man beset her, Was rather given to saying “yes,” Because,—as yet, she knew no better. Each night they held a coterie, Where, every fear to slumber charm'd, Lovers were all they ought to be, And husbands not the least alarm'd. Then call'd they up their schoolday pranks, Nor thought it much their sense beneath To play at riddles, quips, and cranks, And lords show'd wit, and ladies teeth. As—“Why are husbands like the mint?” Because, forsooth, a husband's duty Is but to set the name and print That give a currency to beauty. “Why is a rose in nettles hid “Like a young widow, fresh and fair?” Because 'tis sighing to be rid Of weeds, that “have no business there!” And thus they miss'd and thus they hit, And now they struck and now they parried; And some lay in of full grown wit, While others of a pun miscarried. 'Twas one of those facetious nights That Grammont gave this forfeit ring For breaking grave conundrum-rites, Or punning ill, or—some such thing:— From whence it can be fairly trac'd, Through many a branch and many a bough, From twig to twig, until it grac'd The snowy hand that wears it now. All this I'll prove, and then, to you Oh Tunbridge! and your springs ironical, I swear by Heathcote's eye of blue To dedicate th' important chronicle. Long may your ancient inmates give Their mantles to your modern lodgers, And Charles's loves in Heathcote live, And Charles's bards revive in Rogers. Let no pedantic fools be there; For ever be those fops abolish'd, With heads as wooden as thy ware, And, heaven knows! not half so polish'd. But still receive the young, the gay, The few who know the rare delight Of reading Grammont every day, And acting Grammont every night. THE DEVIL AMONG THE SCHOLARS, A FRAGMENT. ?? ????? ? ?????? Chrysost. Homil. in Epist. ad Hebræos. But, whither have these gentle ones, These rosy nymphs and black-eyed nuns, With all of Cupid's wild romancing, Led my truant brains a dancing? Instead of studying tomes scholastic, Ecclesiastic, or monastic, Off I fly, careering far In chase of Pollys, prettier far Than any of their namesakes are,— The Polymaths and Polyhistors, Polyglots and all their sisters. So have I known a hopeful youth Sit down in quest of lore and truth, With tomes sufficient to confound him, Like Tohu Bohu, heap'd around him,— Mamurra Mamurra, a dogmatic philosopher, who never doubted about any thing, except who was his father.—“Nullâ de re unquam præterquam de patre dubitavit.” —In Vit. He was very learned—“Là-dedans, (that is, in his head when it was opened,) le Punique heurte le Persan, l'Hébreu choque l'Arabique, pour ne point parler de la mauvaise intelligence du Latin avec le Grec,” &amp;c. —See L'Histoire de Montmaur, tom. ii. p. 91. stuck to Theophrastus, And Galen tumbling o'er Bombastus. Bombastus was one of the names of that great scholar and quack Paracelsus.—“Philippus Bombastus latet sub splendido tegmine Aureoli Theophrasti Paracelsi,” says Stadelius de circumforaneâ Literatorum vanitate.—He used to fight the devil every night with a broadsword, to the no small terror of his pupil Oporinus, who has recorded the circumstance. (Vide Oporin. Vit. apud Christian. Gryph. Vit. Select. quorundam Eruditissimorum, &amp;c.) Paracelsus had but a poor opinion of Galen:—“My very beard (says he in his Paragrænum) has more learning in it than either Galen or Avicenna.” When lo! while all that's learn'd and wise Absorbs the boy, he lifts his eyes, And through the window of his study Beholds some damsel fair and ruddy, With eyes, as brightly turn'd upon him as The angel's The angel, who scolded St. Jerom for reading Cicero, as Gratian tells the story in his “Concordantia discordantium Canonum,” and says, that for this reason bishops were not allowed to read the Classics: “Episcopus Gentilium libros non legat.” —Distinct. 37. But Gratian is notorious for lying —besides, angels, as the illustrious pupil of Pantenus assures us, have got no tongues. ???? ?? ???? ?? ???, ????? ???????? ? ??????? ???? ?? ?????? ??? ??? ????? ????????. —Clem. Alexand. Stromat. were on Hieronymus. Quick fly the folios, widely scatter'd, Old Homer's laurel'd brow is batter'd, And Sappho, headlong sent, flies just in The reverend eye of St. Augustin. Raptur'd he quits each dozing sage, Oh woman, for thy lovelier page: Sweet book!—unlike the books of art,— Whose errors are thy fairest part; In whom the dear errata column Is the best page in all the volume! The idea of the Rabbins, respecting the origin of woman, is not a little singular. They think that man was originally formed with a tail, like a monkey, but that the Deity cut off this appendage, and made woman of it. Upon this extra-ordinary supposition the following reflection is founded:— If such is the tie between women and men, The ninny who weds is a pitiful elf, For he takes to his tail like an idiot again, And thus makes a deplorable ape of himself. Yet, if we may judge as the fashions prevail, Every husband remembers th' original plan, And, knowing his wife is no more than his tail, Why he—leaves her behind him as much as he can. But to begin my subject rhyme— 'Twas just about this devilish time, When scarce there happen'd any frolics That were not done by Diabolics, A cold and loveless son of Lucifer, Who woman scorn'd, nor saw the use of her, A branch of Dagon's family, (Which Dagon, whether He or She, Is a dispute that vastly better is Referr'd to Scaliger Scaliger. de Emendat. Tempor.—Dagon was thought by others to be a certain sea-monster, who came every day out of the Red Sea to teach the Syrians husbandry.—See Jaques Gaffarel (Curiosités Inouies, chap. i.), who says he thinks this story of the sea-monster “carries little show of probability with it.” et cæteris,) Finding that, in this cage of fools, The wisest sots adorn the schools, Took it at once his head Satanic in, To grow a great scholastic manikin,— A doctor, quite as learn'd and fine as Scotus John or Tom Aquinas I wish it were known with any degree of certainty whether the Commentary on Boethius attributed to Thomas Aquinas be really the work of this Angelic Doctor. There are some bold assertions hazarded in it: for instance, he says that Plato kept school in a town called Academia, and that Alcibiades was a very beautiful woman whom some of Aristotle's pupils fell in love with:—“Alcibiades mulier fuit pulcherrima, quam videntes quidam discipuli Aristotelis,” &amp;c. —See Freytag Adparat. Litterar. art. 86. tom. i., Lully, Hales Irrefragabilis, Or any doctor of the rabble is. In languages The following compliment was paid to Laurentius Valla, upon his accurate knowledge of the Latin language:— Nunc postquam manes defunctus Valla petivit, Non audet Pluto verba Latina loqui. Since Val arriv'd in Pluto's shade, His nouns and pronouns all so pat in, Pluto himself would be afraid To say his soul's his own, in Latin!See for these lines the “Auctorum Censio” of Du Verdier (page 29.)., the Polyglots, Compar'd to him, were Babel sots; He chatter'd more than ever Jew did;— Sanhedrim and Priest included, Priest and holy Sanhedrim Were one-and-seventy fools to him. But chief the learned demon felt a Zeal so strong for gamma, delta, That, all for Greek and learning's glory It is much to be regretted that Martin Luther, with all his talents for reforming, should yet be vulgar enough to laugh at Camerarius for writing to him in Greek. “Master Joachim (says he) has sent me some dates and some raisins, and has also written me two letters in Greek. As soon as I am recovered, I shall answer them in Turkish, that he too may have the pleasure of reading what he does not understand.” “Græca sunt, legi non possunt,” is the ignorant speech attributed to Accursius; but very unjustly:—for, far from asserting that Greek could not be read, that worthy jurisconsult upon the Law 6. D. de Bonor. Possess. expressly says, “Græcæ literæ possunt intelligi et legi.” (Vide Nov. Libror. Rarior. Collection. Fascic. IV.)—Scipio Carteromachus seems to have been of opinion that there is no salvation out of the pale of Greek Literature: “Via prima salutis Graiâ pandetur ab urbe:” and the zeal of Laurentius Rhodomannus cannot be sufficiently admired, when he exhorts his countrymen, “per gloriam Christi, per salutem patriæ, per reipublicæ decus et emolumentum,” to study the Greek language. Nor must we forget Phavorinus, the excellent Bishop of Nocera, who careless of all the usual commendations of a Christian, required no further eulogium on his tomb than “Here lieth a Greek Lexicographer.”, He nightly tippled “Græco more,” And never paid a bill or balance Except upon the Grecian Kalends:— From whence your scholars, when they want tick, Say, to be Attic's to be on tick, In logics, he was quite Ho Panu ? ????.—The introduction of this language into English poetry has a good effect, and ought to be more universally adopted. A word or two of Greek in a stanza would serve as ballast to the most “light o' love” verses. Ausonius, among the ancients, may serve as a model:— ?? ??? ??? ????? ????? in hac regione???????. ????? ab nostris ???????? esse ???????? Ronsard, the French poet, has enriched his sonnets and odes with many an exquisite morsel from the Lexicon. His “chère Entelechie,” in addressing his mistress, can only be equalled by Cowley's “Antiperistasis.”; Knew as much as ever man knew. He fought the combat syllogistic With so much skill and art eristic, That though you were the learned Stagyrite, At once upon the hip he had you right. In music, though he had no ears Except for that amongst the spheres, (Which most of all, as he averr'd it, He dearly loved, 'cause no one heard it,) Yet aptly he, at sight, could read Each tuneful diagram in Bede, And find, by Euclid's corollaria, The ratios of a jig or aria. But, as for all your warbling Delias, Orpheuses and Saint Cecilias, He own'd he thought them much surpass'd By that redoubted Hyaloclast Or Glass-Breaker—Morhofius has given an account of this extraordinary man, in a work, published 1682,—“De vitreo scypho fracto,” &amp;c. Who still contriv'd by dint of throttle, Where'er he went to crack a bottle. Likewise to show his mighty knowledge, he, On things unknown in physiology, Wrote many a chapter to divert us, (Like that great little man Albertus,) Wherein he show'd the reason why, When children first are heard to cry, If boy the baby chance to be, He cries O A!—if girl, O E!— Which are, quoth he, exceeding fair hints Respecting their first sinful parents; “Oh Eve!” exclaimeth little madam, While little master cries “Oh Adam!” Translated almost literally from a passage in Albertus de Secretis, &amp;c. But, 'twas in Optics and Dioptrics, Our dæmon play'd his first and top tricks. He held that sunshine passes quicker Through wine than any other liquor; And though he saw no great objection To steady light and clear reflection, He thought the aberrating rays, Which play about a bumper's blaze, Were by the Doctors look'd, in common, on, As a more rare and rich phenomenon. He wisely said that the sensorium Is for the eyes a great emporium, To which these noted picture-stealers Send all they can and meet with dealers. In many an optical proceeding The brain, he said, show'd great good breeding; For instance, when we ogle women (A trick which Barbara tutor'd him in), Although the dears are apt to get in a Strange position on the retina, Yet instantly the modest brain Doth set them on their legs again! Alluding to that habitual act of the judgment, by which, notwithstanding the inversion of the image upon the retina, a correct impression of the object is conveyed to the sensorium. Our doctor thus, with “stuff'd sufficiency” Of all omnigenous omnisciency, Began (as who would not begin That had, like him, so much within?) To let it out in books of all sorts, Folios, quartos, large and small sorts; Poems, so very deep and sensible That they were quite incomprehensible Under this description, I believe “the Devil among the Scholars” may be included. Yet Leibnitz found out the uses of incomprehensibility, when he was appointed secretary to a society of philosophers at Nuremberg, chiefly for his ingenuity in writing a cabalistical letter, not one word of which either they or himself could interpret. See the Eloge Historique de M. de Leibnitz, l'Europe Savante.—People in all ages have loved to be puzzled. We find Cicero thanking Atticus for having sent him a work of Serapion “ex quo (says he) quidem ego (quod inter nos liceat dicere) millesimam partem vix intelligo.” Lib. ii. epist. 4.

TO FRANCIS, EARL OF MOIRA, GENERAL IN HIS MAJESTY'S FORCES, MASTER-GENERAL OF THE ORDNANCE, CONSTABLE OF THE TOWER, ETC. TO LORD VISCOUNT STRANGFORD. ABOARD THE PHAETON FRIGATE, OFF THE AZORES BY MOONLIGHT. Sweet Moon! if, like Crotona's sage Pythagoras; who was supposed to have a power of writing upon the Moon by the means of a magic mirror. —See Bayle, art. Pythag., By any spell my hand could dare To make thy disk its ample page, And write my thoughts, my wishes there; How many a friend, whose careless eye Now wanders o'er that starry sky, Should smile, upon thy orb to meet The recollection, kind and sweet, The reveries of fond regret, The promise, never to forget, And all my heart and soul would send To many a dear-lov'd, distant friend. How little, when we parted last, I thought those pleasant times were past, For ever past, when brilliant joy Was all my vacant heart's employ: When, fresh from mirth to mirth again, We thought the rapid hours too few; Our only use for knowledge then To gather bliss from all we knew. Delicious days of whim and soul! When, mingling lore and laugh together, We lean'd the book on Pleasure's bowl, And turn'd the leaf with Folly's feather. Little I thought that all were fled, That, ere that summer's bloom was shed, My eye should see the sail unfurl'd That wafts me to the western world. And yet, 'twas time;—in youth's sweet days, To cool that season's glowing rays, The heart awhile, with wanton wing, May dip and dive in Pleasure's spring; But, if it wait for winter's breeze, The spring will chill, the heart will freeze. And then, that Hope, that fairy Hope,— Oh! she awak'd such happy dreams, And gave my soul such tempting scope For all its dearest, fondest schemes, That not Verona's child of song, When flying from the Phrygian shore, With lighter heart could bound along, Or pant to be a wanderer more! Alluding to these animated lines in the 44th Carmen of Catullus:— Jam mens prætrepidans avet vagari, Jam læti studio pedes vigescunt! Even now delusive hope will steal Amid the dark regrets I feel, Soothing, as yonder placid beam Pursues the murmurers of the deep, And lights them with consoling gleam, And smiles them into tranquil sleep. Oh! such a blessed night as this, I often think, if friends were near, How we should feel, and gaze with bliss Upon the moon-bright scenery here! The sea is like a silvery lake, And, o'er its calm the vessel glides Gently, as if it fear'd to wake The slumber of the silent tides. The only envious cloud that lowers Hath hung its shade on Pico's height A very high mountain on one of the Azores, from which the island derives its name. It is said by some to be as high as the Peak of Teneriffe., Where dimly, mid the dusk, he towers, And scowling at this heav'n of light, Exults to see the infant storm Cling darkly round his giant form! Now, could I range those verdant isles, Invisible, at this soft hour, And see the looks, the beaming smiles, That brighten many an orange bower; And could I lift each pious veil, And see the blushing cheek it shades,— Oh! I should have full many a tale, To tell of young Azorian maids. I believe it is Guthrie who says, that the inhabitants of the Azores are much addicted to gallantry. This is an assertion in which even Guthrie may be credited. Yes, Strangford, at this hour, perhaps, Some lover (not too idly blest, Like those, who in their ladies' laps May cradle every wish to rest,) Warbles, to touch his dear one's soul, Those madrigals, of breath divine, Which Camoens' harp from Rapture stole And gave, all glowing warm, to thine. These islands belong to the Portuguese. Oh! could the lover learn from thee, And breathe them with thy graceful tone, Such sweet, beguiling minstrelsy Would make the coldest nymph his own. But, hark!—the boatswain's pipings tell 'Tis time to bid my dream farewell: Eight bells:—the middle watch is set; Good night, my Strangford!—ne'er forget That, far beyond the western sea Is one, whose heart remembers thee. STANZAS. [A beam of tranquility smil'd in the west] ????? ?? ???? ???? ? ??? ????????? ????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ????. Æschyl. Fragment. A beam of tranquility smil'd in the west, The storms of the morning pursued us no more; And the wave, while it welcom'd the moment of rest, Still heav'd, as remembering ills that were o'er. Serenely my heart took the hue of the hour, Its passions were sleeping, were mute as the dead; And the spirit becalm'd but remember'd their power, As the billow the force of the gale that was fled. I thought of those days, when to pleasure alone My heart ever granted a wish or a sigh; When the saddest emotion my bosom had known, Was pity for those who were wiser than I. I reflected, how soon in the cup of Desire The pearl of the soul may be melted away; How quickly, alas, the pure sparkle of fire We inherit from heav'n, may be quench'd in the clay; And I pray'd of that Spirit who lighted the flame, That Pleasure no more might its purity dim; So that, sullied but little, or brightly the same, I might give back the boon I had borrow'd from Him. How blest was the thought! it appeared as if Heaven Had already an opening to Paradise shown; As if, passion all chasten'd and error forgiven, My heart then began to be purely its own. I look'd to the west, and the beautiful sky Which morning had clouded, was clouded no more: “Oh! thus,” I exclaimed, “may a heavenly eye “Shed light on the soul that was darken'd before.” TO THE FLYING-FISH. It is the opinion of St. Austin upon Genesis, and I believe of nearly all the Fathers, that birds, like fish, were originally produced from the waters; in defence of which idea they have collected every fanciful circumstance which can tend to prove a kindred similitude between them; ?????????? ???? ?????????? ???? ?? ?????. With this thought in our minds, when we first see the Flying-Fish, we could almost fancy, that we are present at the moment of creation, and witness the birth of the first bird from the waves. When I have seen thy snow-white wing From the blue wave at evening spring, And show those scales of silvery white, So gaily to the eye of light, As if thy frame were form'd to rise, And live amid the glorious skies; Oh! it has made me proudly feel, How like thy wing's impatient zeal Is the pure soul, that rests not, pent Within this world's gross element, But takes the wing that God has given, And rises into light and heaven! But, when I see that wing, so bright, Grow languid with a moment's flight, Attempt the paths of air in vain, And sink into the waves again; Alas! the flattering pride is o'er; Like thee, awhile, the soul may soar, But erring man must blush to think, Like thee, again the soul may sink. Oh Virtue! when thy clime I seek, Let not my spirit's flight be weak: Let me not, like this feeble thing, With brine still dropping from its wing, Just sparkle in the solar glow And plunge again to depths below; But, when I leave the grosser throng With whom my soul hath dwelt so long, Let me, in that aspiring day, Cast every lingering stain away, And, panting for thy purer air, Fly up at once and fix me there. TO MISS MOORE. FROM NORFOLK, IN VIRGINIA, NOVEMBER, 1803. In days, my Kate, when life was new, When, lull'd with innocence and you, I heard, in home's beloved shade, The din the world at distance made; When, every night my weary head Sunk on its own unthorned bed, And, mild as evening's matron hour, Looks on the faintly shutting flower, A mother saw our eyelids close, And bless'd them into pure repose; Then, haply if a week, a day, I linger'd from that home away, How long the little absence seem'd! How bright the look of welcome beam'd, As mute you heard, with eager smile, My tales of all that pass'd the while! Yet now, my Kate, a gloomy sea Rolls wide between that home and me; The moon may thrice be born and die, Ere ev'n that seal can reach mine eye, Which used so oft, so quick to come, Still breathing all the breath of home,— As if, still fresh, the cordial air From lips belov'd were lingering there. But now, alas,—far different fate! It comes o'er ocean, slow and late, When the dear hand that fill'd its fold With words of sweetness may lie cold. But hence that gloomy thought! at last, Beloved Kate, the waves are past: I tread on earth securely now, And the green cedar's living bough Breathes more refreshment to my eyes Than could a Claude's divinest dyes. At length I touch the happy sphere To liberty and virtue dear, Where man looks up, and, proud to claim His rank within the social frame, Sees a grand system round him roll, Himself its centre, sun, and soul! Far from the shocks of Europe—far From every wild, elliptic star That, shooting with a devious fire, Kindled by heaven's avenging ire, So oft hath into chaos hurl'd The systems of the ancient world. The warrior here, in arms no more, Thinks of the toil, the conflict o'er, And glorying in the freedom won For hearth and shrine, for sire and son, Smiles on the dusky webs that hide His sleeping sword's remember'd pride. While Peace, with sunny cheeks of toil, Walks o'er the free, unlorded soil, Effacing with her splendid share The drops that war had sprinkled there. Thrice happy land! where he who flies From the dark ills of other skies, From scorn, or want's unnerving woes, May shelter him in proud repose: Hope sings along the yellow sand His welcome to a patriot land; The mighty wood, with pomp, receives The stranger in its world of leaves, Which soon their barren glory yield To the warm shed and cultur'd field; And he, who came, of all bereft, To whom malignant fate had left Nor home nor friends nor country dear, Finds home and friends and country here. Such is the picture, warmly such, That Fancy long, with florid touch, Had painted to my sanguine eye Of man's new world of liberty. Oh! ask me not, if Truth have yet Her seal on Fancy's promise set; If ev'n a glimpse my eyes behold Of that imagin'd age of gold;— Alas, not yet one gleaming trace! Such romantic works as “The American Farmer's Letters,” and the account of Kentucky by Imlay, would seduce us into a belief, that innocence, peace, and freedom had deserted the rest of the world for Martha's Vineyard and the banks of the Ohio. The French travellers, too, almost all from revolutionary motives, have contributed their share to the diffusion of this flattering misconception. A visit to the country is, however, quite sufficient to correct even the most enthusiastic prepossession. Never did youth, who lov'd a face As sketch'd by some fond pencil's skill, And made by fancy lovelier still, Shrink back with more of sad surprise, When the live model met his eyes, Than I have felt, in sorrow felt, To find a dream on which I've dwelt From boyhood's hour, thus fade and flee At touch of stern reality! But, courage, yet, my wavering heart! Blame not the temple's meanest part Norfolk, it must be owned, presents an unfavourable specimen of America. The characteristics of Virginia in general are not such as can delight either the politician or the moralist, and at Norfolk they are exhibited in their least attractive form. At the time when we arrived the yellow fever had not yet disappeared, and every odour that assailed us in the streets very strongly accounted for its visitation., Till thou hast trac'd the fabric o'er:— As yet, we have beheld no more Than just the porch to Freedom's fane; And, though a sable spot may stain The vestibule, 'tis wrong, 'tis sin To doubt the godhead reigns within! So here I pause—and now, my Kate, To you, and those dear friends, whose fate Touches more near this home-sick soul Than all the Powers from pole to pole, One word at parting,—in the tone Most sweet to you, and most my own. The simple strain I send you here A trifling attempt at musical composition accompanied this Epistle., Wild though it be, would charm your ear, Did you but know the trance of thought In which my mind its numbers caught. 'Twas one of those half-waking dreams, That haunt me oft, when music seems To bear my soul in sound along, And turn its feelings all to song. I thought of home, the according lays Came full of dreams of other days; Freshly in each succeeding note I found some young remembrance float, Till following, as a clue, that strain, I wander'd back to home again. Oh! love the song, and let it oft Live on your lip, in accents soft. Say that it tells you, simply well, All I have bid its wild notes tell,— Of Memory's dream, of thoughts that yet Glow with the light of joy that's set, And all the fond heart keeps in store Of friends and scenes beheld no more. And now, adieu!—this artless air, With a few rhymes, in transcript fair, Are all the gifts I yet can boast To send you from Columbia's coast; But when the sun, with warmer smile, Shall light me to my destin'd isle Bermuda., You shall have many a cowslip-bell, Where Ariel slept, and many a shell, In which that gentle spirit drew From honey flowers the morning dew. THE LAKE OF THE DISMAL SWAMP. A BALLAD. WRITTEN AT NORFOLK, IN VIRGINIA. “They tell of a young man, who lost his mind upon the death of a girl he loved, and who, suddenly disappearing from his friends, was never afterwards heard of. As he had frequently said, in his ravings, that the girl was not dead, but gone to the Dismal Swamp, it is supposed he had wandered into that dreary wilderness, and had died of hunger, or been lost in some of its dreadful morasses.” —Anon. “La Poésie a ses monstres comme la nature.” —D'Alembert. “They made her a grave, too cold and damp “For a soul so warm and true; “And she's gone to the Lake of the Dismal Swamp The Great Dismal Swamp is ten or twelve miles distant from Norfolk, and the Lake in the middle of it (about seven miles long) is called Drummond's Pond., “Where, all night long, by a fire-fly lamp, “She paddles her white canoe. “And her fire-fly lamp I soon shall see, “And her paddle I soon shall hear; “Long and loving our life shall be, “And I'll hide the maid in a cypress tree, “When the footstep of death is near.” Away to the Dismal Swamp he speeds— His path was rugged and sore, Through tangled juniper, beds of reeds, Through many a fen, where the serpent feeds, And man never trod before. And, when on the earth he sunk to sleep, If slumber his eyelids knew, He lay, where the deadly vine doth weep Its venomous tear and nightly steep The flesh with blistering dew! And near him the she-wolf stirr'd the brake, And the copper-snake breath'd in his ear, Till he starting cried, from his dream awake, “Oh! when shall I see the dusky Lake, “And the white canoe of my dear?” He saw the Lake, and a meteor bright Quick over its surface play'd— “Welcome,” he said, “my dear-one's light!” And the dim shore echoed, for many a night, The name of the death-cold maid. Till he hollow'd a boat of the birchen bark, Which carried him off from shore; Far, far he follow'd the meteor spark, The wind was high and the clouds were dark, And the boat return'd no more. But oft, from the Indian hunter's camp This lover and maid so true Are seen at the hour of midnight damp To cross the Lake by a fire-fly lamp, And paddle their white canoe! TO THE MARCHIONESS DOWAGER OF DONEGALL. FROM BERMUDA, JANUARY, 1804. Lady! where'er you roam, whatever land Woos the bright touches of that artist hand; Whether you sketch the valley's golden meads, Where mazy Linth his lingering current leads Lady Donegall, I had reason to suppose, was at this time still in Switzerland, where the well-known powers of her pencil must have been frequently awakened.; Enamour'd catch the mellow hues that sleep, At eve, on Meillerie's immortal steep; Or musing o'er the Lake, at day's decline, Mark the last shadow on that holy shrine The chapel of William Tell on the Lake of Lucerne., Where, many a night, the shade of Tell complains Of Gallia's triumph and Helvetia's chains; Oh! lay the pencil for a moment by, Turn from the canvass that creative eye, And let its splendour, like the morning ray Upon a shepherd's harp, illume my lay. Yet, Lady, no—for song so rude as mine, Chase not the wonders of your art divine; Still, radiant eye, upon the canvass dwell; Still, magic finger, weave your potent spell; And, while I sing the animated smiles Of fairy nature in these sun-born isles, Oh, might the song awake some bright design, Inspire a touch, or prompt one happy line, Proud were my soul, to see its humble thought On painting's mirror so divinely caught; While wondering Genius, as he lean'd to trace The faint conception kindling into grace, Might love my numbers for the spark they threw, And bless the lay that lent a charm to you. Say, have you ne'er, in nightly vision, stray'd To those pure isles of ever-blooming shade, Which bards of old, with kindly fancy, plac'd For happy spirits in th' Atlantic waste? M. Gebelin says, in his Monde Primitif, “Lorsque Strabon crût que les anciens théologiens et poëtes plaçoient les champs élysées dans les isles de l'Océan Atlantique, il n'entendit rien à leur doctrine.” M. Gebelin's supposition, I have no doubt, is the more correct; but that of Strabo is, in the present instance, most to my purpose. There listening, while, from earth, each breeze that came Brought echoes of their own undying fame, In eloquence of eye, and dreams of song, They charm'd their lapse of nightless hours along:— Nor yet in song, that mortal ear might suit, For every spirit was itself a lute, Where Virtue waken'd, with elysian breeze, Pure tones of thought and mental harmonies. Believe me, Lady, when the zephyrs bland Floated our bark to this enchanted land,— These leafy isles upon the ocean thrown, Like studs of emerald o'er a silver zone,— Not all the charm, that ethnic fancy gave To blessed arbours o'er the western wave, Could wake a dream, more soothing or sublime, Of bowers ethereal, and the Spirit's clime. Bright rose the morning, every wave was still, When the first perfume of a cedar hill Sweetly awak'd us, and, with smiling charms, The fairy harbour woo'd us to its arms. Nothing can be more romantic than the little harbour of St. George's. The number of beautiful islets, the singular clearness of the water, and the animated play of the graceful little boats, gliding for ever between the islands, and seeming to sail from one cedar-grove into another, formed altogether as lovely a miniature of nature's beauties as can well be imagined. Gently we stole, before the whispering wind, Through plaintain shades, that round, like awnings, twin'd And kiss'd on either side the wanton sails, Breathing our welcome to these vernal vales; While, far reflected o'er the wave serene, Each wooded island shed so soft a green That the enamour'd keel, with whispering play, Through liquid herbage seem'd to steal its way. Never did weary bark more gladly glide, Or rest its anchor in a lovelier tide! Along the margin, many a shining dome, White as the palace of a Lapland gnome, Brighten'd the wave;—in every myrtle grove Secluded bashful, like a shrine of love, Some elfin mansion sparkled through the shade; And, while the foliage interposing play'd, Lending the scene an ever-changing grace, Fancy would love, in glimpses vague, to trace The flowery capital, the shaft, the porch This is an illusion which, to the few who are fanciful enough to indulge in it, renders the scenery of Bermuda particularly interesting. In the short but beautiful twilight of their spring evenings, the white cottages, scattered over the islands, and but partially seen through the trees that surround them, assume often the appearance of little Grecian temples; and a vivid fancy may embellish the poor fisherman's hut with columns such as the pencil of a Claude might imitate. I had one favourite object of this kind in my walks, which the hospitality of its owner robbed me of, by asking me to visit him. He was a plain good man, and received me well and warmly, but I could never turn his house into a Grecian temple again., And dream of temples, till her kindling torch Lighted me back to all the glorious days Of Attic genius; and I seem'd to gaze On marble, from the rich Pentelic mount, Gracing the umbrage of some Naiad's fount. Then thought I, too, of thee, most sweet of all The spirit race that come at poet's call, Delicate Ariel! who, in brighter hours, Liv'd on the perfume of these honied bowers, In velvet buds, at evening, lov'd to lie, And win with music every rose's sigh. Though weak the magic of my humble strain To charm your spirit from its orb again, Yet, oh, for her, beneath whose smile I sing, For her (whose pencil, if your rainbow wing Were dimm'd or ruffled by a wintry sky, Could smooth its feather and relume its dye,) Descend a moment from your starry sphere, And, if the lime-tree grove that once was dear, The sunny wave, the bower, the breezy hill, The sparkling grotto can delight you still, Oh cull their choicest tints, their softest light, Weave all these spells into one dream of night, And, while the lovely artist slumbering lies, Shed the warm picture o'er her mental eyes; Take for the task her own creative spells, And brightly show what song but faintly tells. TO GEORGE MORGAN, ESQ. OF NORFOLK, VIRGINIA. This gentleman is attached to the British consulate at Norfolk. His talents are worthy of a much higher sphere; but the excellent dispositions of the family with whom he resides, and the cordial repose he enjoys amongst some of the kindest hearts in the world, should be almost enough to atone to him for the worst caprices of fortune. The consul himself, Colonel Hamilton, is one among the very few instances of a man, ardently loyal to his king, and yet beloved by the Americans. His house is the very temple of hospitality, and I sincerely pity the heart of that stranger who, warm from the welcome of such a board, could sit down to write a libel on his host, in the true spirit of a modern philosophist.

Oh, what a sea of storm we've pass'd!— High mountain waves and foamy showers, And battling winds whose savage blast But ill agrees with one whose hours Have passed in old Anacreon's bowers. Yet think not poesy's bright charm Forsook me in this rude alarm We were seven days on our passage from Norfolk to Bermuda, during three of which we were forced to lay-to in a gale of wind. The Driver sloop of war, in which I went, was built at Bermuda of cedar, and is accounted an excellent sea-boat. She was then commanded by my very regretted friend Captain Compton, who in July last was killed aboard the Lilly in an action with a French privateer. Poor Compton! he fell a victim to the strange impolicy of allowing such a miserable thing as the Lilly to remain in the service; so small, crank, and unmanageable, that a well-manned merchant-man was at any time a match for her.:— When close they reef'd the timid sail, When, every plank complaining loud, We labour'd in the midnight gale, And ev'n our haughty main-mast bow'd, Even then, in that unlovely hour, The Muse still brought her soothing power, And, midst the war of waves and wind, In song's Elysium lapp'd my mind. Nay, when no numbers of my own Responded to her wakening tone, She open'd, with her golden key, The casket where my memory lays Those gems of classic poesy, Which time has sav'd from ancient days. Take one of these, to Lais sung,— I wrote it while my hammock swung, As one might write a dissertation Upon “Suspended Animation!” Sweet This epigram is by Paul the Silentiary, and may be found in the Analecta of Brunck, vol. iii. p. 72. As the reading there is somewhat different from what I have followed in this translation, I shall give it as I had it in my memory at the time, and as it is in Heinsius, who, I believe, first produced the epigram.

Sadly you lean your head to mine, And mute those arms around me twine, Your hair adown my bosom spread, All glittering with the tears you shed. In vain I've kiss'd those lids of snow, For still, like ceaseless founts they flow, Bathing our cheeks, whene'er they meet. Why is it thus? do, tell me, sweet! Ah, Lais! are my bodings right? Am I to lose you? is to-night Our last—go, false to heaven and me! Your very tears are treachery. Such, while in air I floating hung, Such was the strain, Morgante mio! The muse and I together sung, With Boreas to make out the trio. But, bless the little fairy isle! How sweetly after all our ills, We saw the sunny morning smile Serenely o'er its fragrant hills; And felt the pure, delicious flow Of airs, that round this Eden blow Freshly as ev'n the gales that come O'er our own healthy hills at home. Could you but view the scenery fair, That now beneath my window lies, You'd think, that nature lavish'd there Her purest wave, her softest skies, To make a heaven for love to sigh in, For bards to live and saints to die in. Close to my wooded bank below, In glassy calm the waters sleep, And to the sunbeam proudly show The coral rocks they love to steep. The water is so clear around the island, that the rocks are seen beneath to a very great depth; and, as we entered the harbour, they appeared to us so near the surface that it seemed impossible we should not strike on them. There is no necessity, of course, for heaving the lead; and the negro pilot, looking down at the rocks from the bow of the ship, takes her through this difficult navigation, with a skill and confidence which seem to astonish some of the oldest sailors. The fainting breeze of morning fails; The drowsy boat moves slowly past, And I can almost touch its sails As loose they flap around the mast. The noontide sun a splendour pours That lights up all these leafy shores; While his own heav'n, its clouds and beams, So pictured in the waters lie, That each small bark, in passing, seems To float along a burning sky. Oh for the pinnace lent to thee In Kircher's “Ecstatic Journey to Heaven,” Cosmiel, the genius of the world, gives Theodidactus a boat of asbestos, with which he embarks into the regions of the sun. “Vides (says Cosmiel) hanc asbestinam naviculam commoditati tuæ præparatam.” —Itinerar. I. Dial. i. cap. 5. This work of Kircher abounds with strange fancies., Blest dreamer, who, in vision bright, Didst sail o'er heaven's solar sea And touch at all its isles of light. Sweet Venus, what a clime he found Within thy orb's ambrosial round! When the Genius of the world and his fellow-traveller arrive at the planet Venus, they find an island of loveliness, full of odours and intelligences, where angels preside, who shed the cosmetic influence of this planet over the earth; such being, according to astrologers, the “vis influxiva” of Venus. When they are in this part of the heavens, a casuistical question occurs to Theodidactus, and he asks, “Whether baptism may be performed with the waters of Venus?”— “An aquis globi Veneris baptismus institui possit?” to which the Genius answers, “Certainly.”— There spring the breezes, rich and warm, That sigh around thy vesper car; And angels dwell, so pure of form That each appears a living star. This idea is Father Kircher's. “Tot animatos soles dixisses.” —Itinerar. I. Dial. i. cap. 5. These are the sprites, celestial queen! Thou sendest nightly to the bed Of her I love, with touch unseen Thy planet's brightening tints to shed; To lend that eye a light still clearer, To give that cheek one rose-blush more, And bid that blushing lip be dearer, Which had been all too dear before. But, whither means the muse to roam? 'Tis time to call the wanderer home. Who could have thought the nymph would perch her Up in the clouds with Father Kircher? So, health and love to all your mansion! Long may the bowl that pleasures bloom in, The flow of heart, the soul's expansion, Mirth and song, your board illumine. At all your feasts, remember too, When cups are sparkling to the brim, That here is one who drinks to you, And, oh! as warmly drink to him. LINES, WRITTEN IN A STORM AT SEA. That sky of clouds is not the sky To light a lover to the pillow Of her he loves— The swell of yonder foaming billow Resembles not the happy sigh That rapture moves Yet do I feel more tranquil far Amid the gloomy wilds of ocean, In this dark hour, Than when, in passion's young emotion, I've stolen, beneath the evening star, To Julia's bower. Oh! there's a holy calm profound In awe like this, that ne'er was given To pleasure's thrill; 'Tis as a solemn voice from heaven, And the soul, listening to the sound, Lies mute and still. 'Tis true, it talks of danger nigh, Of slumbering with the dead to-morrow In the cold deep, Where pleasure's throb or tears of sorrow No more shall wake the heart or eye, But all must sleep. Well!—there are some, thou stormy bed, To whom thy sleep would be a treasure; Oh! most to him, Whose lip hath drain'd life's cup of pleasure, Nor left one honey drop to shed Round sorrow's brim. Yes—he can smile serene at death: Kind heaven, do thou but chase the weeping Of friends who love him; Tell them that he lies calmly sleeping Where sorrow's sting or envy's breath No more shall move him. ODES TO NEA; WRITTEN AT BERMUDA. ??? ????????. Euripid. Medea, v. 967. [Nay, tempt me not to love again] Nay, tempt me not to love again, There was a time when love was sweet; Dear Nea! had I known thee then, Our souls had not been slow to meet. But, oh, this weary heart hath run, So many a time, the rounds of pain, Not ev'n for thee, thou lovely one, Would I endure such pangs again. If there be climes, where never yet The print of beauty's foot was set, Where man may pass his loveless nights, Unfever'd by her false delights, Thither my wounded soul would fly, Where rosy cheek or radiant eye Should bring no more their bliss, or pain, Nor fetter me to earth again. Dear absent girl! whose eyes of light, Though little priz'd when all my own, Now float before me, soft and bright As when they first enamouring shone,— What hours and days have I seen glide, While fix'd, enchanted, by thy side, Unmindful of the fleeting day, I've let life's dream dissolve away. O bloom of youth profusely shed! O moments! simply, vainly sped, Yet sweetly too—for Love perfum'd The flame which thus my life consum'd; And brilliant was the chain of flowers, In which he led my victim-hours. Say, Nea, say, couldst thou, like her, When warm to feel and quick to err, Of loving fond, of roving fonder, This thoughtless soul might wish to wander,— Couldst thou, like her, the wish reclaim, Endearing still, reproaching never, Till ev'n this heart should burn with shame, And be thy own more fix'd than ever? No, no—on earth there's only one Could bind such faithless folly fast; And sure on earth but one alone Could make such virtue false at last! Nea, the heart which she forsook, For thee were but a worthless shrine— Go, lovely girl, that angel look Must thrill a soul more pure than mine. Oh! thou shalt be all else to me, That heart can feel or tongue can feign; I'll praise, admire, and worship thee, But must not, dare not, love again. [I pray you, let us roam no more] —Tale iter omne cave. Propert. lib. iv. eleg. 8. I pray you, let us roam no more Along that wild and lonely shore, Where late we thoughtless stray'd; 'Twas not for us, whom heaven intends To be no more than simple friends, Such lonely walks were made. That little Bay, where turning in From ocean's rude and angry din, As lovers steal to bliss, The billows kiss the shore, and then Flow back into the deep again, As though they did not kiss. Remember, o'er its circling flood In what a dangerous dream we stood— The silent sea before us, Around us, all the gloom of grove, That ever lent its shade to love, No eye but heaven's o'er us! I saw you blush, you felt me tremble, In vain would formal art dissemble All we then look'd and thought; 'Twas more than tongue could dare reveal, 'Twas ev'ry thing that young hearts feel, By Love and Nature taught. I stoop'd to cull, with faltering hand, A shell that, on the golden sand, Before us faintly gleam'd; I trembling rais'd it, and when you Had kist the shell, I kist it too— How sweet, how wrong it seem'd! Oh, trust me, 'twas a place, an hour, The worst that e'er the tempter's power Could tangle me or you in; Sweet Nea, let us roam no more Along that wild and lonely shore, Such walks may be our ruin. [You read it in these spell-bound eyes] You read it in these spell-bound eyes, And there alone should love be read; You hear me say it all in sighs, And thus alone should love be said. Then dread no more; I will not speak; Although my heart to anguish thrill, I'll spare the burning of your cheek, And look it all in silence still. Heard you the wish I dar'd to name, To murmur on that luckless night, When passion broke the bonds of shame, And love grew madness in your sight? Divinely through the graceful dance, You seem'd to float in silent song, Bending to earth that sunny glance, As if to light your steps along. Oh! how could others dare to touch That hallow'd form with hand so free, When but to look was bliss too much, Too rare for all but Love and me! With smiling eyes, that little thought How fatal were the beams they threw, My trembling hands you lightly caught, And round me, like a spirit, flew. Heedless of all, but you alone,— And you, at least, should not condemn, If, when such eyes before me shone, My soul forgot all eyes but them,— I dar'd to whisper passion's vow,— For love had ev'n of thought bereft me,— Nay, half-way bent to kiss that brow, But, with a bound, you blushing left me. Forget, forget that night's offence, Forgive it, if, alas! you can; 'Twas love, 'twas passion—soul and sense— 'Twas all that's best and worst in man. That moment, did th' assembled eyes Of heaven and earth my madness view, I should have seen, through earth and skies, But you alone—but only you. Did not a frown from you reprove, Myriads of eyes to me were none; Enough for me to win your love, And die upon the spot, when won. A DREAM OF ANTIQUITY. I just had turn'd the classic page, And trac'd that happy period over, When blest alike were youth and age, And love inspired the wisest sage, And wisdom graced the tenderest lover. Before I laid me down to sleep Awhile I from the lattice gaz'd Upon that still and moonlight deep, With isles like floating gardens rais'd, For Ariel there his sports to keep; While, gliding 'twixt their leafy shores The lone night-fisher plied his oars. I felt,—so strongly fancy's power Came o'er me in that witching hour,— As if the whole bright scenery there Were lighted by a Grecian sky, And I then breath'd the blissful air That late had thrill'd to Sappho's sigh. Thus, waking, dreamt I,—and when Sleep Came o'er my sense, the dream went on; Nor, through her curtain dim and deep, Hath ever lovelier vision shone. I thought that, all enrapt, I stray'd Through that serene, luxurious shade Gassendi thinks that the gardens, which Pausanias mentions, in his first book, were those of Epicurus; and Stuart says, in his Antiquities of Athens, “Near this convent (the convent of Hagios Asomatos) is the place called at present Kepoi, or the Gardens; and Ampelos Kepos, or the Vineyard Garden: these were probably the gardens which Pausanias visited.” Vol. i. chap. 2., Where Epicurus taught the Loves To polish virtue's native brightness,— As pearls, we're told, that fondling doves Have play'd with, wear a smoother whiteness. This method of polishing pearls, by leaving them awhile to be played with by doves, is mentioned by the fanciful Cardanus, de Rerum Varietat. lib. vii. cap. 34. 'Twas one of those delicious nights So common in the climes of Greece, When day withdraws but half its lights, And all is moonshine, balm, and peace. And thou wert there, my own belov'd, And by thy side I fondly rov'd Through many a temple's reverend gloom, And many a bower's seductive bloom, Where Beauty learn'd what Wisdom taught, And sages sigh'd and lovers thought; Where schoolmen conn'd no maxims stern, But all was form'd to soothe or move, To make the dullest love to learn, To make the coldest learn to love. And now the fairy pathway seem'd To lead us through enchanted ground, Where all that bard has ever dream'd Of love or luxury bloom'd around. Oh! 'twas a bright, bewildering scene— Along the alley's deepening green Soft lamps, that hung like burning flowers, And scented and illum'd the bowers, Seem'd, as to him, who darkling roves Amid the lone Hercynian groves, Appear those countless birds of light, That sparkle in the leaves at night, And from their wings diffuse a ray Along the traveller's weary way. In Hercynio Germaniæ saltu inusitata genera alitum accepimus, quarum plumæ, ignium modo, colluceant noctibus. —Plin. lib. x. cap. 47. 'Twas light of that mysterious kind, Through which the soul perchance may roam, When it has left this world behind, And gone to seek its heavenly home. And, Nea, thou wert by my side, Through all this heav'n-ward path my guide. But, lo, as wand'ring thus we rang'd That upward path, the vision chang'd; And now, methought, we stole along Through halls of more voluptuous glory Than ever liv'd in Teian song, Or wanton'd in Milesian story. The Milesiacs, or Milesian fables, had their origin in Miletus, a luxurious town of Ionia. Aristides was the most celebrated author of these licentious fictions.

Farewell to Bermuda The inhabitants pronounce the name as if it were written Bermooda. See the commentators on the words “still-vex'd Bermoothes,” in the Tempest.—I wonder it did not occur to some of those all-reading gentlemen that, possibly, the discoverer of this “island of hogs and devils” might have been no less a personage than the great John Bermudez, who, about the same period (the beginning of the sixteenth century), was sent Patriarch of the Latin church to Ethiopia, and has left us most wonderful stories of the Amazons and the Griffins which he encountered. —Travels of the Jesuits, vol. i.

And thou—when, at dawn, thou shalt happen to roam Through the lime-cover'd alley that leads to thy home, Where oft, when the dance and the revel were done, And the stars were beginning to fade in the sun, I have led thee along, and have told by the way What my heart all the night had been burning to say— Oh! think of the past—give a sigh to those times, And a blessing for me to that alley of limes. [If I were yonder wave, my dear] If I were yonder wave, my dear, And thou the isle it clasps around, I would not let a foot come near My land of bliss, my fairy ground. If I were yonder conch of gold, And thou the pearl within it plac'd. I would not let an eye behold The sacred gem my arms embrac'd. If I were yonder orange-tree, And thou the blossom blooming there, I would not yield a breath of thee To scent the most imploring air. Oh! bend not o'er the water's brink, Give not the wave that odorous sigh, Nor let its burning mirror drink The soft reflection of thine eye. That glossy hair, that glowing cheek, So pictur'd in the waters seem, That I could gladly plunge to seek Thy image in the glassy stream. Blest fate! at once my chilly grave And nuptial bed that stream might be; I'll wed thee in its mimic wave, And die upon the shade of thee. Behold the leafy mangrove, bending O'er the waters blue and bright, Like Nea's silky lashes, lending Shadow to her eyes of light. Oh, my belov'd! where'er I turn, Some trace of thee enchants mine eyes; In every star thy glances burn; Thy blush on every flow'ret lies. Nor find I in creation aught Of bright, or beautiful, or rare, Sweet to the sense, or pure to thought, But thou art found reflected there. THE SNOW SPIRIT. No, ne'er did the wave in its element steep An island of lovelier charms; It blooms in the giant embrace of the deep, Like Hebe in Hercules' arms. The blush of your bowers is light to the eye, And their melody balm to the ear; But the fiery planet of day is too nigh, And the Snow Spirit never comes here. The down from his wing is as white as the pearl That shines through thy lips when they part, And it falls on the green earth as melting, my girl, As a murmur of thine on the heart Oh! fly to the clime, where he pillows the death, As he cradles the birth of the year; Bright are your bowers and balmy their breath, But the Snow Spirit cannot come here. How sweet to behold him, when borne on the gale, And brightening the bosom of morn, He flings, like the priest of Diana, a veil O'er the brow of each virginal thorn. Yet think not the veil he so chillingly casts Is the veil of a vestal severe; No, no, thou wilt see, what a moment it lasts, Should the Snow Spirit ever come here. But fly to his region—lay open thy zone, And he'll weep all his brilliancy dim, To think that a bosom, as white as his own, Should not melt in the daybeam like him. Oh! lovely the print of those delicate feet O'er his luminous path will appear— Fly, my beloved! this island is sweet, But the Snow Spirit cannot come here.

'Twas noon; and every orange bud Hung languid o'er the crystal flood, Faint as the lids of maiden's eyes When love-thoughts in her bosom rise. Oh, for a naiad's sparry bower, To shade me in that glowing hour! A little dove, of milky hue, Before me from a plantain flew, And, light along the water's brim, I steer'd my gentle bark by him; For fancy told me, Love had sent This gentle bird with kind intent To lead my steps, where I should meet— I knew not what, but something sweet. And—bless the little pilot dove! He had indeed been sent by Love, To guide me to a scene so dear As fate allows but seldom here; One of those rare and brilliant hours, That, like the aloe's The Agave.

Plato, I think, allows a poet to be “three removes from truth;” ???????? ??? ??? ????????. lingering flowers, May blossom to the eye of man But once in all his weary span. Just where the margin's opening shade A vista from the waters made, My bird repos'd his silver plume Upon a rich banana's bloom. Oh vision bright! oh spirit fair! What spell, what magic rais'd her there? 'Twas Nea! slumbering calm and mild, And bloomy as the dimpled child, Whose spirit in elysium keeps Its playful sabbath, while he sleeps. The broad banana's green embrace Hung shadowy round each tranquil grace; One little beam alone could win The leaves to let it wander in, And, stealing over all her charms, From lip to cheek, from neck to arms, New lustre to each beauty lent,— Itself all trembling as it went! Dark lay her eyelid's jetty fringe Upon that cheek whose roseate tinge Mix'd with its shade, like evening's light Just touching on the verge of night. Her eyes, though thus in slumber hid, Seem'd glowing through the ivory lid, And, as I thought, a lustre threw Upon her lip's reflecting dew,— Such as a night-lamp, left to shine Alone on some secluded shrine, May shed upon the votive wreath, Which pious hands have hung beneath. Was ever vision half so sweet! Think, think how quick my heart-pulse beat, As o'er the rustling bank I stole;— Oh! ye, that know the lover's soul, It is for you alone to guess, That moment's trembling happiness. A STUDY FROM THE ANTIQUE. Behold, my love, the curious gem Within this simple ring of gold; 'Tis hallow'd by the touch of them Who liv'd in classic hours of old. Some fair Athenian girl, perhaps, Upon her hand this gem display'd, Nor thought that time's succeeding lapse Should see it grace a lovelier maid. Look, dearest, what a sweet design! The more we gaze, it charms the more; Come—closer bring that cheek to mine, And trace with me its beauties o'er. Thou seest, it is a simple youth By some enamour'd nymph embrac'd— Look, as she leans, and say in sooth Is not that hand most fondly plac'd? Upon his curled head behind It seems in careless play to lie Somewhat like the symplegma of Cupid and Psyche at Florence, in which the position of Psyche's hand is finely and delicately expressive of affection. See the Museum Florentinum, tom. ii. tab. 43, 44. There are few subjects on which poetry could be more interestingly employed than in illustrating some of these ancient statues and gems., Yet presses gently, half inclin'd To bring the truant's lip more nigh. Oh happy maid! too happy boy! The one so fond and little loath, The other yielding slow to joy— Oh rare, indeed, but blissful both. Imagine, love, that I am he, And just as warm as he is chilling; Imagine, too, that thou art she, But quite as coy as she is willing: So may we try the graceful way In which their gentle arms are twin'd, And thus, like her, my hand I lay Upon thy wreathed locks behind: And thus I feel thee breathing sweet, As slow to mine thy head I move; And thus our lips together meet, And thus,—and thus,—I kiss thee, love. [There's not a look, a word of thine] —???????? ???????, ??? ??????????? ?????????. Aristot. Rhetor. lib. iii. cap. 4. There's not a look, a word of thine, My soul hath e'er forgot; Thou ne'er hast bid a ringlet shine, Nor giv'n thy locks one graceful twine Which I remember not. There never yet a murmur fell From that beguiling tongue, Which did not, with a lingering spell, Upon my charmed senses dwell, Like songs from Eden sung. Ah! that I could, at once, forget All, all that haunts me so— And yet, thou witching girl,—and yet, To die were sweeter than to let The lov'd remembrance go. No; if this slighted heart must see Its faithful pulse decay, Oh let it die, remembering thee, And, like the burnt aroma, be Consum'd in sweets away. TO JOSEPH ATKINSON, ESQ. FROM BERMUDA. Pinkerton has said that “a good history and description of the Bermudas might afford a pleasing addition to the geographical library;” but there certainly are not materials for such a work. The island, since the time of its discovery, has experienced so very few vicissitudes, the people have been so indolent, and their trade so limited, that there is but little which the historian could amplify into importance; and, with respect to the natural productions of the country, the few which the inhabitants can be induced to cultivate are so common in the West Indies, that they have been described by every naturalist who has written any account of those islands. It is often asserted by the trans-Atlantic politicians that this little colony deserves more attention from the mother-country than it receives, and it certainly possesses advantages of situation, to which we should not be long insensible, if it were once in the hands of an enemy. I was told by a celebrated friend of Washington, at New York, that they had formed a plan for its capture towards the conclusion of the American War; “with the intention (as he expressed himself) of making it a nest of hornets for the annoyance of British trade in that part of the world.” And there is no doubt it lies so conveniently in the track to the West Indies, that an enemy might with ease convert it into a very harassing impediment. The plan of Bishop Berkeley for a college at Bermuda, where American savages might be converted and educated, though concurred in by the government of the day, was a wild and useless speculation. Mr. Hamilton, who was governor of the island some years since, proposed, if I mistake not, the establishment of a marine academy for the instruction of those children of West Indians, who might be intended for any nautical employment. This was a more rational idea, and for something of this nature the island is admirably calculated. But the plan should be much more extensive, and embrace a general system of education; which would relieve the colonists from the alternative to which they are reduced at present, of either sending their sons to England for instruction, or intrusting them to colleges in the states of America, where ideas, by no means favourable to Great Britain, are very sedulously inculcated. The women of Bermuda, though not generally handsome, have an affectionate languor in their look and manner, which is always interesting. What the French imply by their epithet aimante seems very much the character of the young Bermudian girls—that predisposition to loving, which, without being awakened by any particular object, diffuses itself through the general manner in a tone of tenderness that never fails to fascinate. The men of the island, I confess, are not very civilised; and the old philosopher, who imagined that, after this life, men would be changed into mules, and women into turtle-doves, would find the metamorphosis in some degree anticipated at Bermuda. “The daylight is gone—but, before we depart, “One cup shall go round to the friend of my heart, “The kindest, the dearest—oh! judge by the tear “I now shed while I name him, how kind and how dear.” 'Twas thus in the shade of the Calabash Tree, With a few, who could feel and remember like me, The charm that, to sweeten my goblet, I threw Was a sigh to the past and a blessing on you. Oh! say, is it thus, in the mirth-bringing hour, When friends are assembled, when wit, in full flower, Shoots forth from the lip, under Bacchus's dew, In blossoms of thought ever springing and new— Do you sometimes remember, and hallow the brim Of your cup with a sigh, as you crown it to him Who is lonely and sad in these valleys so fair, And would pine in elysium, if friends were not there! Last night, when we came from the Calabash-Tree, When my limbs were at rest and my spirit was free, The glow of the grape and the dreams of the day Set the magical springs of my fancy in play, And oh,—such a vision as haunted me then I would slumber for ages to witness again. The many I like, and the few I adore, The friends who were dear and beloved before, But never till now so beloved and dear, At the call of my Fancy, surrounded me here; And soon,—oh, at once, did the light of their smiles To a paradise brighten this region of isles; More lucid the wave, as they look'd on it, flow'd, And brighter the rose, as they gather'd it, glow'd. Not the valleys Heræan (though water'd by rills Of the pearliest flow, from those pastoral hills Mountains of Sicily, upon which Daphnis, the first inventor of bucolic poetry, was nursed by the nymphs. See the lively description of these mountains in Diodorus Siculus, lib. iv. ????? ??? ??? ???? ??? ???????? ?????, ? ???? ??????, ?. ?. ?., Where the Song of the Shepherd, primeval and wild, Was taught to the nymphs by their mystical child) Could boast such a lustre o'er land and o'er wave As the magic of love to this paradise gave. Oh magic of love! unembellish'd by you, Hath the garden a blush or the landscape a hue? Or shines there a vista in nature or art, Like that which Love opes thro' the eye to the heart? Alas, that a vision so happy should fade! That, when morning around me in brilliancy play'd, The rose and the stream I had thought of at night Should still be before me, unfadingly bright; While the friends, who had seem'd to hang over the stream, And to gather the roses, had fled with my dream. But look, where, all ready, in sailing array, The bark that's to carry these pages away A ship, ready to sail for England., Impatiently flutters her wing to the wind, And will soon leave these islets of Ariel behind. What billows, what gales is she fated to prove, Ere she sleep in the lee of the land that I love! Yet pleasant the swell of the billows would be, And the roar of those gales would be music to me. Not the tranquillest air that the winds ever blew, Not the sunniest tears of the summer-eve dew, Were as sweet as the storm, or as bright as the foam Of the surge, that would hurry your wanderer home. THE STEERMAN'S SONG, WRITTEN ABOARD THE BOSTON FRIGATE 28TH APRIL. I left Bermuda in the Boston about the middle of April, in company with the Cambrian and Leander, aboard the latter of which was the Admiral, Sir Andrew Mitchell, who divides his year between Halifax and Bermuda, and is the very soul of society and good-fellowship to both. We separated in a few days, and the Boston after a short cruise proceeded to New York. When freshly blows the northern gale, And under courses snug we fly; Or when light breezes swell the sail, And royals proudly sweep the sky; 'Longside the wheel, unwearied still I stand, and, as my watchful eye Doth mark the needle's faithful thrill, I think of her I love, and cry, Port, my boy! port. When calms delay, or breezes blow Right from the point we wish to steer; When by the wind close-haul'd we go, And strive in vain the port to near; I think 'tis thus the fates defer My bliss with one that's far away, And while remembrance springs to her, I watch the sails and sighing say, Thus, my boy! thus. But see the wind draws kindly aft, All hands are up the yards to square, And now the floating stu'n-sails waft Our stately ship through waves and air. Oh! then I think that yet for me Some breeze of fortune thus may spring, Some breeze to waft me, love, to thee— And in that hope I smiling sing, Steady, boy! so. TO THE FIRE-FLY. The lively and varying illumination, with which these fire-flies light up the woods at night, gives quite an idea of enchantment. “Puis ces mouches se developpant de l'obscurité de ces arbres et s'approchant de nous, nous les voyions sur les orangers voisins, qu'ils mettoient tout en feu, nous rendant la vue de leurs beaux fruits dorés que la nuit avoit ravie,” &amp;c. &amp;c. —See L'Histoire des Antilles, art. 2. chap.4. liv. i. At morning, when the earth and sky Are glowing with the light of spring, We see thee not, thou humble fly! Nor think upon they gleaming wing. But when the skies have lost their hue, And sunny lights no longer play, Oh then we see and bless thee too For sparkling o'er the dreary way. Thus let me hope, when lost to me The lights that now my life illume, Some milder joys may come, like thee, To cheer, if not to warm, the gloom! TO THE LORD VISCOUNT FORBES. FROM THE CITY OF WASHINGTON. If former times had never left a trace Of human frailty in their onward race, Nor o'er their pathway written, as they ran, One dark memorial of the crimes of man; If every age, in new unconscious prime, Rose, like a phenix, from the fires of time, To wing its way unguided and alone, The future smiling and the past unknown; Then ardent man would to himself be new, Earth at his foot and heaven within his view: Well might the novice hope, the sanguine scheme Of full perfection prompt his daring dream, Ere cold experience, with her veteran lore, Could tell him, fools had dreamt as much before. But, tracing as we do, through age and clime, The plans of virtue midst the deeds of crime, The thinking follies and the reasoning rage Of man, at once the idiot and the sage; When still we see, through every varying frame Of arts and polity, his course the same, And know that ancient fools but died, to make A space on earth for modern fools to take; 'Tis strange, how quickly we the past forget; That Wisdom's self should not be tutor'd yet, Nor tire of watching for the monstrous birth Of pure perfection midst the sons of earth! Oh! nothing but that soul which God has given, Could lead us thus to look on earth for heaven; O'er dross without to shed the light within, And dream of virtue while we see but sin. Even here, beside the proud Potowmac's stream, Might sages still pursue the flattering theme Of days to come, when man shall conquer fate, Rise o'er the level of his mortal state, Belie the monuments of frailty past, And plant perfection in this world at last! “Here,” might they say, “shall power's divided reign “Evince that patriots have not bled in vain. “Here godlike liberty's herculean youth, “Cradled in peace, and nurtur'd up by truth “To full maturity of nerve and mind, “Shall crush the giants that bestride mankind. Thus Morse. “Here the sciences and the arts of civilised life are to receive their highest improvements: here civil and religious liberty are to flourish, unchecked by the cruel hand of civil or ecclesiastical tyranny: here genius, aided by all the improvements of former ages, is to be exerted in humanising mankind, in expanding and enriching their minds with religious and philosophical knowledge,” &amp;c. &amp;c. —P. 569. “Here shall religion's pure and balmy draught “In form no more from cups of state be quaff'd, “But flow for all, through nation, rank, and sect, “Free as that heaven its tranquil waves reflect. “Around the columns of the public shrine “Shall growing arts their gradual wreath intwine, “Nor breathe corruption from the flowering braid, “Nor mine that fabric which they bloom to shade. “No longer here shall Justice bound her view, “Or wrong the many, while she rights the few; “But take her range through all the social frame, “Pure and pervading as that vital flame “Which warms at once our best and meanest part, “And thrills a hair while it expands a heart!” Oh golden dream! what soul that loves to scan The bright disk rather than the dark of man, That owns the good, while smarting with the ill, And loves the world with all its frailty still,— What ardent bosom does not spring to meet The generous hope, with all that heavenly heat, Which makes the soul unwilling to resign The thoughts of growing, even on earth, divine! Yes, dearest friend, I see thee glow to think The chain of ages yet may boast a link Of purer texture than the world has known, And fit to bind us to a Godhead's throne. But, is it thus? doth even the glorious dream Borrow from truth that dim, uncertain gleam, Which tempts us still to give such fancies scope, As shock not reason, while they nourish hope? No, no, believe me, 'tis not so—ev'n now, While yet upon Columbia's rising brow The showy smile of young presumption plays, Her bloom is poison'd and her heart decays. Even now, in dawn of life, her sickly breath Burns with the taint of empires near their death; And, like the nymphs of her own withering clime, She's old in youth, she's blasted in her prime. “What will be the old age of this government, if it is thus early decrepit!” Such was the remark of Fauchet, the French minister at Philadelphia, in that famous despatch to his government, which was intercepted by one of our cruisers in the year 1794. This curious memorial may be found in Porcupine's Works, vol. i. p. 279. It remains a striking monument of republican intrigue on one side and republican profligacy on the other; and I would recommend the perusal of it to every honest politician, who may labour under a moment's delusion with respect to the purity of American patriotism. Already has the child of Gallia's school The foul Philosophy that sins by rule, With all her train of reasoning, damning arts, Begot by brilliant heads on worthless hearts, Like things that quicken after Nilus' flood, The venom'd birth of sunshine and of mud,— Already has she pour'd her poison here O'er every charm that makes existence dear; Already blighted, with her blackening trace, The opening bloom of every social grace, And all those courtesies, that love to shoot Round virtue's stem, the flow'rets of her fruit. And, were these errors but the wanton tide Of young luxuriance or unchasten'd pride; The fervid follies and the faults of such As wrongly feel, because they feel too much; Then might experience make the fever less, Nay, graft a virtue on each warm excess. But no; 'tis heartless, speculative ill, All youth's transgression with all age's chill; The apathy of wrong, the bosom's ice, A slow and cold stagnation into vice. Long has the love of gold, that meanest rage, And latest folly of man's sinking age, Which, rarely venturing in the van of life, While nobler passions wage their heated strife, Comes skulking last, with selfishness and fear, And dies, collecting lumber in the rear,— Long has it palsied every grasping hand And greedy spirit through this bartering land; Turn'd life to traffic, set the demon gold So loose abroad that virtue's self is sold, And conscience, truth, and honesty are made To rise and fall, like other wares of trade. “Nous voyons que, dans les pays où l'on n'est affecté que de l'esprit de commerce, on trafique de toutes les actions humaines et de toutes les vertus morales.” —Montesquieu, de l'Esprit des Lois, liv. xx. chap. 2. Already in this free, this virtuous state, Which, Frenchmen tell us, was ordain'd by fate, To show the world, what high perfection springs From rabble senators, and merchant kings,— Even here already patriots learn to steal Their private perquisites from public weal, And, guardians of the country's sacred fire, Like Afric's priests, let out the flame for hire. Those vaunted demagogues, who nobly rose From England's debtors to be England's foes I trust I shall not be suspected of a wish to justify those arbitrary steps of the English government which the colonies found it so necessary to resist; my only object here is to expose the selfish motives of some of the leading American demagogues., Who could their monarch in their purse forget, And break allegiance, but to cancel debt The most persevering enemy to the interests of this country, amongst the politicians of the western world, has been a Virginian merchant, who, finding it easier to settle his conscience than his debts, was one of the first to raise the standard against Great Britain, and has ever since endeavoured to revenge upon the whole country the obligations which he lies under to a few of its merchants., Have prov'd at length, the mineral's tempting hue, Which makes a patriot, can unmake him too. See Porcupine's account of the Pennsylvania Insurrection in 1794. In short, see Porcupine's works throughout, for ample corroboration of every sentiment which I have ventured to express. In saying this, I refer less to the comments of that writer than to the occurrences which he has related and the documents which he has preserved. Opinion may be suspected of bias, but facts speak for themselves. Oh! Freedom, Freedom, how I hate thy cant! Not Eastern bombast, not the savage rant Of purpled madmen, were they number'd all From Roman Nero down to Russian Paul, Could grate upon my ear so mean, so base, As the rank jargon of that factious race, Who, poor of heart and prodigal of words, Form'd to be slaves, yet struggling to be lords, Strut forth, as patriots, from their negro-marts, And shout for rights, with rapine in their hearts. Who can, with patience, for a moment see The medley mass of pride and misery, Of whips and charters, manacles and rights, Of slaving blacks and democratic whites In Virginia the effects of this system begin to be felt rather seriously. While the master raves of liberty, the slave cannot but catch the contagion, and accordingly there seldom elapses a month without some alarm of insurrection amongst the negroes. The accession of Louisiana, it is feared, will increase this embarrassment; as the numerous emigrations, which are expected to take place, from the southern states to this newly acquired territory, will considerably diminish the white population, and thus strengthen the proportion of negroes, to a degree which must ultimately be ruinous., And all the piebald polity that reigns In free confusion o'er Columbia's plains? To think that man, thou just and gentle God! Should stand before thee with a tyrant's rod O'er creatures like himself, with souls from thee, Yet dare to boast of perfect liberty; Away, away—I'd rather hold my neck By doubtful tenure from a sultan's beck, In climes, where liberty has scarce been nam'd, Nor any right but that of ruling claim'd, Than thus to live, where bastard Freedom waves Her fustian flag in mockery over slaves; Where—motley laws admitting no degree Betwixt the vilely slav'd and madly free— Alike the bondage and the licence suit The brute made ruler and the man made brute. But, while I thus, my friend, in flowerless song, So feebly paint, what yet I feel so strong, The ills, the vices of the land, where first Those rebel fiends, that rack the world, were nurst, Where treason's arm by royalty was nerv'd, And Frenchmen learn'd to crush the throne they serv'd— Thou, calmly lull'd in dreams of classic thought, By bards illumin'd and by sages taught, Pant'st to be all, upon this mortal scene, That bard hath fancied or that sage hath been. Why should I wake thee? why severely chase The lovely forms of virtue and of grace, That dwell before thee, like the pictures spread By Spartan matrons round the genial bed, Moulding thy fancy, and with gradual art Brightening the young conceptions of thy heart. Forgive me, Forbes—and should the song destroy One generous hope, one throb of social joy, One high pulsation of the zeal for man, Which few can feel, and bless that few who can,— Oh! turn to him, beneath whose kindred eyes Thy talents open and thy virtues rise, Forget where nature has been dark or dim, And proudly study all her lights in him. Yes, yes, in him the erring world forget, And feel that man may reach perfection yet. TO THOMAS HUME, ESQ. M.D. FROM THE CITY OF WASHINGTON. ?????????? ????????? ???? ??????. ??????? ?? ??????? ??? ????. Xenophont. Ephes. Ephesiac. lib. v. 'Tis evening now; beneath the western star Soft sighs the lover through his sweet segar, And fills the ears of some consenting she With puffs and vows, with smoke and constancy. The patriot, fresh from Freedom's councils come, Now pleas'd retires to lash his slaves at home; Or woo, perhaps, some black Aspasia's charms, And dream of freedom in his bondsmaid's arms. The “black Aspasia” of the present ? of the United States, inter Avernales haud ignotissima nymphas, has given rise to much pleasantry among the anti-democrat wits in America. In fancy now, beneath the twilight gloom, Come, let me lead thee o'er this “second Rome!” “On the original location of the ground now allotted for the seat of the Federal City (says Mr. Weld) the identical spot on which the capitol now stands was called Rome. This anecdote is related by many as a certain prognostic of the future magnificence of this city, which is to be, as it were, a second Rome.” —Weld's Travels, letter iv. Where tribunes rule, where dusky Davi bow, And what was Goose-Creek once is Tiber now A little stream runs through the city, which, with intolerable affectation, they have styled the Tiber. It was originally called Goose-Creek.:— This embryo capital, where Fancy sees Squares in morasses, obelisks in trees; Which second-sighted seers, ev'n now, adorn With shrines unbuilt and heroes yet unborn, Though nought but woods “To be under the necessity of going through a deep wood for one or two miles, perhaps, in order to see a next-door neighbour, and in the same city, is a curious and, I believe, a novel circumstance.” —Weld, letter iv. The Federal City (if it must be called a city) has not been much increased since Mr. Weld visited it. Most of the public buildings, which were then in some degree of forwardness, have been since utterly suspended. The hotel is already a ruin; a great part of its roof has fallen in, and the rooms are left to be occupied gratuitously by the miserable Scotch and Irish emigrants. The President's house, a very noble structure, is by no means suited to the philosophical humility of its present possessor, who inhabits but a corner of the mansion himself, and abandons the rest to a state of uncleanly desolation, which those who are not philosophers cannot look at without regret. This grand edifice is encircled by a very rude paling, through which a common rustic stile introduces the visiters of the first man in America. With respect to all that is within the house, I shall imitate the prudent forbearance of Herodotus, and say, ?? ?? ?? ????????. The private buildings exhibit the same characteristic display of arrogant speculation and premature ruin; and the few ranges of houses which were begun some years ago have remained so long waste and unfinished that they are now for the most part dilapidated. and J?n they see, Where streets should run and sages ought to be. And look, how calmly in yon radiant wave, The dying sun prepares his golden grave. Oh mighty river! oh ye banks of shade! Ye matchless scenes, in nature's morning made, While still, in all th' exuberance of prime, She pour'd her wonders, lavishly sublime, Nor yet had learn'd to stoop, with humbler care, From grand to soft, from wonderful to fair;— Say, were your towering hills, your boundless floods, Your rich savannas and majestic woods, Where bards should meditate and heroes rove, And woman charm, and man deserve her love,— Oh say, was world so bright, but born to grace Its own half-organised, half-minded race The picture which Buffon and De Pauw have drawn of the American Indian, though very humiliating, is, as far as I can judge, much more correct than the flattering representations which Mr. Jefferson has given us. See the Notes on Virginia, where this gentleman endeavours to disprove in general the opinion maintained so strongly by some philosophers that nature (as Mr. Jefferson expresses it) be-littles her productions in the western world. M. de Pauw attributes the imperfection of animal life in America to the ravages of a very recent deluge, from whose effects upon its soil and atmosphere it has not yet sufficiently recovered. —Recherches sur les Américains, part i. tom. i. p. 102. Of weak barbarians, swarming o'er its breast, Like vermin gender'd on the lion's crest? Were none but brutes to call that soil their home, Where none but demigods should dare to roam? Or worse, thou wondrous world! oh! doubly worse, Did heaven design thy lordly land to nurse The motley dregs of every distant clime, Each blast of anarchy and taint of crime Which Europe shakes from her perturbed sphere, In full malignity to rankle here? But hold,—observe you little mount of pines, Where the breeze murmurs and the fire-fly shines. There let thy fancy raise, in bold relief, The sculptur'd image of that veteran chief On a small hill near the capitol there is to be an equestrian statue of General Washington. Who lost the rebel's in the hero's name, And climb'd o'er prostrate loyalty to fame; Beneath whose sword Columbia's patriot train Cast off their monarch, that their mob might reign. How shall we rank thee upon glory's page? Thou more than soldier and just less than sage! Of peace too fond to act the conqueror's part, Too long in camps to learn a statesman's art, Nature design'd thee for a hero's mould, But, ere she cast thee, let the stuff grow cold. While loftier souls command, nay, make their fate, Thy fate made thee and forc'd thee to be great. Yet Fortune, who so oft, so blindly sheds Her brightest halo round the weakest heads, Found thee undazzled, tranquil as before, Proud to be useful, scorning to be more; Less mov'd by glory's than by duty's claim, Renown the meed, but self-applause the aim; All that thou wert reflects less fame on thee, Far less, than all thou didst forbear to be. Nor yet the patriot of one land alone,— For, thine's a name all nations claim their own; And every shore, where breath'd the good and brave, Echo'd the plaudits thy own country gave. Now look, my friend, where faint the moonlight falls On yonder dome, and, in those princely halls,— If thou canst hate, as sure that soul must hate, Which loves the virtuous, and reveres the great,— If thou canst loathe and execrate with me The poisonous drug of French philosophy, That nauseous slaver of these frantic times, With which false liberty dilutes her crimes,— If thou hast got, within thy freeborn breast, One pulse that beats more proudly than the rest, With honest scorn for that inglorious soul, Which creeps and winds beneath a mob's control, Which courts the rabble's smile, the rabble's nod, And makes, like Egypt, every beast its god, There, in those walls—but, burning tongue, forbear! Rank must be reverenc'd, even the rank that's there: So here I pause—and now, dear Hume, we part: But oft again, in frank exchange of heart, Thus let us meet, and mingle converse dear By Thames at home, or by Potowmac here. O'er lake and marsh, through fevers and through fogs, Midst bears and yankees, democrats and frogs, Thy foot shall follow me, thy heart and eyes With me shall wonder, and with me despise. In the ferment which the French revolution excited among the democrats of America, and the licentious sympathy with which they shared in the wildest excesses of jacobinism, we may find one source of that vulgarity of vice, that hostility to all the graces of life, which distinguishes the present demagogues of the United States, and has become indeed too generally the characteristic of their countrymen. But there is another cause of the corruption of private morals, which, encouraged as it is by the government, and identified with the interests of the community, seems to threaten the decay of all honest principle in America. I allude to those fraudulent violations of neutrality to which they are indebted for the most lucrative part of their commerce, and by which they have so long infringed and counteracted the maritime rights and advantages of this country. This unwarrantable trade is necessarily abetted by such a system of collusion, imposture, and perjury, as cannot fail to spread rapid contamination around it. While I, as oft, in fancy's dream shall rove, With thee conversing, through that land I love, Where, like the air that fans her fields of green, Her freedom spreads, unfever'd and serene; And sovereign man can condescend to see The throne and laws more sovereign still than he. LINES WRITTEN ON LEAVING PHILADELPHIA. ? ????? ??? ????? ????? ?????? ?????? ???. Sophocl. Œdip. Colon. v. 758. Alone by the Schuylkill a wanderer rov'd, And bright were its flowery banks to his eye; But far, very far were the friends that he lov'd, And he gaz'd on its flowery banks with a sigh. Oh Nature, though blessed and bright are thy rays, O'er the brow of creation enchantingly thrown, Yet faint are they all to the lustre that plays In a smile from the heart that is fondly our own. Nor long did the soul of the stranger remain Unblest by the smile he had languish'd to meet; Though scarce did he hope it would soothe him again, Till the threshold of home had been prest by his feet. But the lays of his boyhood had stol'n to their ear, And they lov'd what they knew of so humble a name; And they told him, with flattery welcome and dear, That they found in his heart something better than fame. Nor did woman—oh woman! whose form and whose soul Are the spell and the light of each path we pursue; Whether sunn'd in the tropics or chill'd at the pole, If woman be there, there is happiness too:— Nor did she her enamouring magic deny,— That magic his heart had relinquish'd so long,— Like eyes he had lov'd was her eloquent eye, Like them did it soften and weep at his song. Oh, blest be the tear, and in memory oft May its sparkle be shed o'er the wanderer's dream; Thrice blest be that eye, and may passion as soft, As free from a pang, ever mellow its beam! The stranger is gone—but he will not forget, When at home he shall talk of the toils he has known, To tell, with a sigh, what endearments he met, As he stray'd by the wave of the Schuylkill alone. LINES WRITTEN AT THE COHOS, OR FALLS OF THE MOHAWK RIVER. There is a dreary and savage character in the country immediately about these Falls, which is much more in harmony with the wildness of such a scene than the cultivated lands in the neighbourhood of Niagara. See the drawing of them in Mr. Weld's book. According to him, the perpendicular height of the Cohos Fall is fifty feet; but the Marquis de Chastellux makes it seventy-six. The fine rainbow, which is continually forming and dissolving, as the spray rises into the light of the sun, is perhaps the most interesting beauty which these wonderful cataracts exhibit. Gia era in loco ove s' udia 'l rimbombo Dell' acqua ?. Dante. From rise of morn till set of sun I've seen the mighty Mohawk run; And as I mark'd the woods of pine Along his mirror darkly shine, Like tall and gloomy forms that pass Before the wizard's midnight glass; And as I view'd the hurrying pace With which he ran his turbid race, Rushing, alike untir'd and wild, Through shades that frown'd and flowers that smil'd, Flying by every green recess That woo'd him to its calm caress, Yet, sometimes turning with the wind, As if to leave one look behind,— Oft have I thought, and thinking sigh'd, How like to thee, thou restless tide, May be the lot, the life of him Who roams along thy water's brim; Through what alternate wastes of woe And flowers of joy my path may go; How many a shelter'd, calm retreat May woo the while my weary feet, While still pursuing, still unblest, I wander on, nor dare to rest; But, urgent as the doom that calls Thy water to its destin'd falls, I feel the world's bewildering force Hurry my heart's devoted course From lapse to lapse, till life be done, And the spent current cease to run. One only prayer I dare to make, As onward thus my course I take;— Oh, be my falls as bright as thine! May heaven's relenting rainbow shine Upon the mist that circles me, As soft as now it hangs o'er thee! SONG OF THE EVIL SPIRIT OF THE WOODS. The idea of this poem occurred to me in passing through the very dreary wilderness between Batavia, a new settlement in the midst of the woods, and the little village of Buffalo upon Lake Erie. This is the most fatiguing part of the route, in travelling through the Genesee country to Niagara. Qua via difficilis, quaque est via nulla. Ovid. Metam. lib. iii. v. 227. Now the vapour, hot and damp, Shed by day's expiring lamp, Through the misty ether spreads Every ill the white man dreads; Fiery fever's thirsty thrill, Fitful ague's shivering chill! Hark! I hear the traveller's song, As he winds the woods along;— Christian, 'tis the song of fear; Wolves are round thee, night is near, And the wild thou dar'st to roam— Think, 'twas once the Indian's home! “The Five Confederated Nations (of Indians) were settled along the banks of the Susquehannah and the adjacent country, until the year 1779, when General Sullivan, with an army of 4000 men, drove them from their country to Niagara, where, being obliged to live on salted provisions, to which they were unaccustomed, great numbers of them died. Two hundred of them, it is said, were buried in one grave, where they had encamped.” —Morse's American Geography. Hither, sprites, who love to harm, Wheresoe'er you work your charm, By the creeks, or by the brakes, Where the pale witch feeds her snakes, And the cayman The alligator, who is supposed to lie in a torpid state all the winter, in the bank of some creek or pond, having previously swallowed a large number of pine-knots, which are his only sustenance during the time. loves to creep, Torpid, to his wintry sleep: Where the bird of carrion flits, And the shuddering murderer sits This was the mode of punishment for murder (as Charlevoix tells us) among the Hurons. “They laid the dead body upon poles at the top of a cabin, and the murderer was obliged to remain several days together, and to receive all that dropped from the carcass, not only on himself but on his food.”, Lone beneath a roof of blood; While upon his poison'd food, From the corpse of him he slew Drops the chill and gory dew. Hither bend ye, turn ye hither, Eyes that blast and wings that wither! Cross the wandering Christian's way, Lead him, ere the glimpse of day, Many a mile of mad'ning error Through the maze of night and terror, Till the morn behold him lying On the damp earth, pale and dying. Mock him, when his eager sight Seeks the cordial cottage-light; Gleam then, like the lightning-bug, Tempt him to the den that's dug For the foul and famish'd brood Of the she-wolf, gaunt for blood; Or, unto the dangerous pass O'er the deep and dark morass, Where the trembling Indian brings Belts of porcelain, pipes, and rings, Tributes, to be hung in air, To the Fiend presiding there! “We find also collars of porcelain, tobacco, ears of maize, skins, &amp;c. by the side of difficult and dangerous ways, on rocks, or by the side of the falls; and these are so many offerings made to the spirits which preside in these places.” —See Charlevoix's Letter on the Traditions and the Religion of the Savages of Canada. Father Hennepin too mentions this ceremony; he also says, “We took notice of one barbarian, who made a kind of sacrifice upon an oak at the Cascade of St. Anthony of Padua, upon the river Mississippi.” —See Hennepin's Voyage into North America. Then, when night's long labour past, Wilder'd, faint, he falls at last, Sinking where the causeway's edge Moulders in the slimy sedge, There let every noxious thing Trail its filth and fix its sting; Let the bull-toad taint him over, Round him let musquitoes hover, In his ears and eyeballs tingling, With his blood their poison mingling, Till, beneath the solar fires, Rankling all, the wretch expires! TO THE HONOURABLE W. R. SPENCER. FROM BUFFALO, UPON LAKE ERIE. Nec venit ad duros musa vocata Getas. Ovid. ex Ponto, lib. l. ep. 5. Thou oft hast told me of the happy hours Enjoy'd by thee in fair Italia's bowers, Where, lingering yet, the ghost of ancient wit Midst modern monks profanely dares to flit, And pagan spirits, by the Pope unlaid, Haunt every stream and sing through every shade There still the bard who (if his numbers be His tongue's light echo) must have talk'd like thee,— The courtly bard, from whom thy mind has caught Those playful, sunshine holydays of thought, In which the spirit baskingly reclines, Bright without effort, resting while it shines,— There still he roves, and laughing loves to see How modern priests with ancient rakes agree; How, 'neath the cowl, the festal garland shines, And Love still finds a niche in Christian shrines. There still, too, roam those other souls of song, With whom thy spirit hath commun'd so long, That, quick as light, their rarest gems of thought, By Memory's magic to thy lip are brought. But here, alas! by Erie's stormy lake, As, far from such bright haunts my course I take, No proud remembrance o'er the fancy plays, No classic dream, no star of other days Hath left that visionary light behind, That lingering radiance of immortal mind, Which gilds and hallows even the rudest scene, The humblest shed, where Genius once has been! All that creation's varying mass assumes Of grand or lovely, here aspires and blooms; Bold rise the mountains, rich the gardens glow, Bright lakes expand, and conquering This epithet was suggested by Charlevoix's striking description of the confluence of the Missouri with the Mississippi. “I believe this is the finest confluence in the world. The two rivers are much of the same breadth, each about half a league; but the Missouri is by far the most rapid, and seems to enter the Mississippi like a conqueror, through which it carries its white waves to the opposite shore, without mixing them: afterwards it gives its colour to the Mississippi, which it never loses again, but carries quite down to the sea.” —Letter xxvii. rivers flow; But mind, immortal mind, without whose ray, This world's a wilderness and man but clay, Mind, mind alone, in barren, still repose, Nor blooms, nor rises, nor expands, nor flows. Take Christians, Mohawks, democrats, and all From the rude wig-wam to the congress-hall, From man the savage, whether slav'd or free, To man the civiliz'd, less tame than he,— 'Tis one dull chaos, one unfertile strife Betwixt half-polish'd and half-barbarous life; Where every ill the ancient world could brew Is mix'd with every grossness of the new; Where all corrupts, though little can entice, And nought is known of luxury, but its vice! Is this the region then, is this the clime For soaring fancies? for those dreams sublime, Which all their miracles of light reveal To heads that meditate and hearts that feel? Alas,! not so—the Muse of Nature lights Her glories round; she scales the mountain heights, And roams the forests; every wond'rous spot Burns with her step, yet man regards it not. She whispers round, her words are in the air, But lost, unheard, they linger freezing there Alluding to the fanciful notion of “words congealed in northern air.”, Without one breath of soul, divinely strong, One ray of mind to thaw them into song. Yet, yet forgive me, oh ye sacred few, Whom late by Delaware's green banks I knew; Whom, known and lov'd through many a social eve, 'Twas bliss to live with, and 'twas pain to leave. In the society of Mr. Dennie and his friends, at Philadelphia, I passed the few agreeable moments which my tour through the States afforded me. Mr. Dennie has succeeded in diffusing through this cultivated little circle that love for good literature and sound politics, which he feels so zealously himself, and which is so very rarely the characteristic of his countrymen. They will not, I trust, accuse me of illiberality for the picture which I have given of the ignorance and corruption that surround them. If I did not hate, as I ought, the rabble to which they are opposed, I could not value, as I do, the spirit with which they defy it; and in learning from them what Americans can be, I but see with the more indignation what Americans are. Not with more joy the lonely exile scann'd The writing traced upon the desert's sand, Where his lone heart but little hop'd to find One trace of life, one stamp of human kind, Than did I hail the pure, th' enlighten'd zeal, The strength to reason and the warmth to feel, The manly polish and the illumin'd taste, Which,—'mid the melancholy, heartless waste My foot has travers'd,—oh you sacred few! I found by Delaware's green banks with you. Long may you loathe the Gallic dross that runs Through your fair country and corrupts its sons; Long love the arts, the glories which adorn Those fields of freedom, where your sires were born. Oh! if America can yet be great, If neither chain'd by choice, nor doom'd by fate To the mob-mania which imbrutes her now, She yet can raise the crown'd, yet civic brow Of single majesty,—can add the grace Of Rank's rich capital to Freedom's base, Nor fear the mighty shaft will feebler prove For the fair ornament that flowers above;— If yet releas'd from all that pedant throng, So vain of error and so pledged to wrong, Who hourly teach her, like themselves, to hide Weakness in vaunt, and barrenness in pride, She yet can rise, can wreathe the Attic charms Of soft refinement round the pomp of arms, And see her poets flash the fires of song, To light her warriors' thunderbolts along;— It is to you, to souls that favouring heaven Has made like yours, the glorious task is given:— Oh! but for such, Columbia's days were done; Rank without ripeness, quicken'd without sun, Crude at the surface, rotten at the core, Her fruits would fall, before her spring were o'er. Believe me, Spencer, while I wing'd the hours Where Schuylkill winds his way through banks of flowers, Though few the days, the happy evenings few, So warm with heart, so rich with mind they flew, That my charm'd soul forgot its wish to roam, And rested there, as in a dream of home. And looks I met, like looks I'd lov'd before, And voices too, which, as they trembled o'er The chord of memory, found full many a tone Of kindness there in concord with their own. Yes,—we had nights of that communion free, That flow of heart, which I have known with thee So oft, so warmly; nights of mirth and mind, Of whims that taught, and follies that refin'd. When shall we both renew them? when, restor'd To the gay feast and intellectual board, Shall I once more enjoy with thee and thine Those whims that teach, those follies that refine? Even now, as, wandering upon Erie's shore, I hear Niagara's distant cataract roar, I sigh for home,—alas! these weary feet Have many a mile to journey, ere we meet. ? ??????, ?? ??? ????? ??? ?????? ???. Euripides. BALLAD STANZAS. I knew by the smoke, that so gracefully curl'd Above the green elms, that a cottage was near, And I said, “If there's peace to be found in the world, “A heart that was humble might hope for it here!” It was noon, and on flowers that languish'd around In silence repos'd the voluptuous bee; Every leaf was at rest, and I heard not a sound But the woodpecker tapping the hollow beech-tree. And, “Here in this lone little wood,” I exclaim'd, “With a maid who was lovely to soul and to eye, “Who would blush when I prais'd her, and weep if I blam'd, “How blest could I live, and how calm could I die! “By the shade of yon sumach, whose red berry dips “In the gush of the fountain, how sweet to recline, “And to know that I sigh'd upon innocent lips, “Which had never been sigh'd on by any but mine!” A CANADIAN BOAT SONG. WRITTEN ON THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE. I wrote these words to an air which our boatmen sung to us frequently. The wind was so unfavourable that they were obliged to row all the way, and we were five days in descending the river from Kingston to Montreal, exposed to an intense sun during the day, and at night forced to take shelter from the dews in any miserable hut upon the banks that would receive us. But the magnificent scenery of the St. Lawrence repays all such difficulties. Our voyageurs had good voices, and sung perfectly in tune together. The original words of the air, to which I adapted these stanzas, appeared to be a long, incoherent story, of which I could understand but little, from the barbarous pronunciation of the Canadians. It begins Dans mon chemin j'ai rencontré Deux cavaliers très-bien montés; And the refrain to every verse was, A l'ombre d'un bois je m'en vais jouer, A l'ombre d'un bois je m'en vais danser. I ventured to harmonise this air, and have published it. Without that charm which association gives to every little memorial of scenes or feelings that are past, the melody may, perhaps, be thought common and trifling; but I remember when we have entered, at sunset, upon one of those beautiful lakes, into which the St. Lawrence so grandly and unexpectedly opens, I have heard this simple air with a pleasure which the finest compositions of the first masters have never given me; and now there is not a note of it which does not recall to my memory the dip of our oars in the St. Lawrence, the flight of our boat down the Rapids, and all those new and fanciful impressions to which my heart was alive during the whole of this very interesting voyage. The above stanzas are supposed to be sung by those voyageurs who go to the Grand Portage by the Utawas River. For an account of this wonderful undertaking, see Sir Alexander Mackenzie's General History of the Fur Trade, prefixed to his Journal. Et remigem cantus hortatur. Quintilian. Faintly as tolls the evening chime Our voices keep tune and our oars keep time. Soon as the woods on shore look dim, We'll sing at St. Ann's our parting hymn. “At the Rapid of St. Ann they are obliged to take out part, if not the whole, of their lading. It is from this spot the Canadians consider they take their departure, as it possesses the last church on the island, which is dedicated to the tutelar saint of voyagers.” —Mackenzie, General History of the Fur Trade. Row, brothers, row, the stream runs fast, The Rapids are near and the daylight's past. Why should we yet our sail unfurl? There is not a breath the blue wave to curl. But, when the wind blows off the shore, Oh! sweetly we'll rest our weary oar. Blow, breezes, blow, the stream runs fast, The Rapids are near and the daylight's past. Utawas' tide! this trembling moon Shall see us float over thy surges soon. Saint of this green isle! hear our prayers, Oh, grant us cool heavens and favouring airs. Blow, breezes, blow, the stream runs fast, The Rapids are near and the daylight's past. TO THE LADY CHARLOTTE RAWDON. FROM THE BANKS OF THE ST. LAWRENCE. Not many months have now been dream'd away Since yonder sun, beneath whose evening ray Our boat glides swiftly past these wooded shores, Saw me where Trent his mazy current pours, And Donington's old oaks, to every breeze, Whisper the tale of by-gone centuries;— Those oaks, to me as sacred as the groves, Beneath whose shade the pious Persian roves, And hears the spirit-voice of sire, or chief, Or loved mistress, sigh in every leaf. “Avendo essi per costume di avere in venerazione gli alberi grandi et antichi, quasi che siano spesso ricettaccoli di anime beate.” —Pietro della Valle, part. second., lettera 16 da i giardini di Sciraz. There, oft, dear Lady, while thy lip hath sung My own unpolish'd lays, how proud I've hung On every tuneful accent! proud to feel That notes like mine should have the fate to steal, As o'er thy hallowing lip they sigh'd along, Such breath of passion and such soul of song. Yes,—I have wonder'd, like some peasant boy Who sings, on Sabbath-eve, his strains of joy, And when he hears the wild, untutor'd note Back to his ear on softening echoes float, Believes it still some answering spirit's tone, And thinks it all too sweet to be his own! I dreamt not then that, ere the rolling year Had fill'd its circle, I should wander here In musing awe; should tread this wondrous world, See all its store of inland waters hurl'd In one vast volume down Niagara's steep, Or calm behold them, in transparent sleep, Where the blue hills of old Toronto shed Their evening shadows o'er Ontario's bed; Should trace the grand Cadaraqui, and glide Down the white rapids of his lordly tide Through massy woods, mid islets flowering fair, And blooming glades, where the first sinful pair For consolation might have weeping trod, When banish'd from the garden of their God. Oh, Lady! these are miracles, which man, Cag'd in the bounds of Europe's pigmy span, Can scarcely dream of,—which his eye must see To know how wonderful this world can be! But lo,—the last tints of the west decline, And night falls dewy o'er these banks of pine. Among the reeds, in which our idle boat Is rock'd to rest, the wind's complaining note Dies like a half-breath'd whispering of flutes; Along the wave the gleaming porpoise shoots, And I can trace him, like a watery star Anburey, in his Travels, has noticed this shooting illumination which porpoises diffuse at night through the river St. Lawrence. —Vol. i. p. 29., Down the steep current, till he fades afar Amid the foaming breakers' silvery light, Where yon rough rapids sparkle through the night. Here, as along this shadowy bank I stray, And the smooth glass-snake The glass-snake is brittle and transparent., gliding o'er my way, Shows the dim moonlight through his scaly form, Fancy, with all the scene's enchantment warm, Hears in the murmur of the nightly breeze Some Indian Spirit warble words like these:— From the land beyond the sea, Whither happy spirits flee; Where, transform'd to sacred doves “The departed spirit goes into the Country of Souls, where, according to some, it is transformed into a dove.” —Charlevoix, upon the Traditions and the Religion of the Savages of Canada. See the curious fable of the American Orpheus in Lafitau, tom. i. p. 402., Many a blessed Indian roves Through the air on wing, as white As those wond'rous stones of light “The mountains appeared to be sprinkled with white stones, which glistened in the sun, and were called by the Indians manetoe aseniah, or spirit-stones.” —Mackenzie's Journal., Which the eye of morning counts On the Apallachian mounts,— Hither oft my flight I take Over Huron's lucid lake, Where the wave, as clear as dew, Sleeps beneath the light canoe, Which, reflected, floating there, Looks as if it hung in air. These lines were suggested by Carver's description of one of the American lakes. “When it was calm,” he says, “and the sun shone bright, I could sit in my canoe, where the depth was upwards of six fathoms, and plainly see huge piles of stone at the bottom, of different shapes, some of which appeared as if they had been hewn; the water was at this time as pure and transparent as air, and my canoe seemed as if it hung suspended in that element. It was impossible to look attentively through this limpid medium, at the rocks below, without finding, before many minutes were elapsed, your head swim and your eyes no longer able to behold the dazzling scene.” Then, when I have stray'd a while Through the Manataulin isle Après avoir traversé plusieurs isles peu considérables, nous en trouvâmes le quatrième jour une fameuse nommèe l'Isle de Manitoualin. —Voyages du Baron de Lahontan, tom. i. let. 15. Manataulin signifies a Place of Spirits, and this island in Lake Huron is held sacred by the Indians., Breathing all its holy bloom, Swift I mount me on the plume Of my Wakon-Bird “The Wakon-Bird, which probably is of the same species with the bird of Paradise, receives its name from the ideas the Indians have of its superior excellence; the Wakon-Bird being, in their language, the Bird of the Great Spirit.” —Morse., and fly Where, beneath a burning sky, O'er the bed of Erie's lake Slumbers many a water-snake, Wrapt within the web of leaves, Which the water-lily weaves. The islands of Lake Erie are surrounded to a considerable distance by the large pond-lily, whose leaves spread thickly over the surface of the lake, and form a kind of bed for the water-snakes in summer. Next I chase the flow'ret-king Through his rosy realm of spring; See him now, while diamond hues Soft his neck and wings suffuse, In the leafy chalice sink, Thirsting for his balmy drink; Now behold him all on fire, Lovely in his looks of ire, Breaking every infant stem, Scattering every velvet gem, Where his little tyrant lip Had not found enough to sip. Then my playful hand I steep Where the gold-thread “The gold thread is of the vine kind, and grows in swamps. The roots spread themselves just under the surface of the morasses, and are easily drawn out by handfuls. They resemble a large entangled skein of silk, and are of a bright yellow.” —Morse. loves to creep, Cull from thence a tangled wreath, Words of magic round it breathe, And the sunny chaplet spread O'er the sleeping fly-bird's head “L'oiseau mouche, gros comme un hanneton, est de toutes couleurs, vives et changeantes: il tire sa subsistence des fleurs commes les abeilles; son nid est fait d'un cotton très-fin suspendu à une branche d'arbre.” —Voyages aux Indes Occidentales, par M. Bossu, seconde part, lett. xx., Till, with dreams of honey blest, Haunted, in his downy nest, By the garden's fairest spells, Dewy buds and fragrant bells, Fancy all his soul embowers In the fly-bird's heaven of flowers. Oft, when hoar and silvery flakes Melt along the ruffled lakes, When the gray moose sheds his horns, When the track, at evening, warns Weary hunters of the way To the wig-wam's cheering ray, Then, aloft through freezing air, With the snow-bird Emberiza hyemalis. —See Imlay's Kentucky, p. 280. soft and fair As the fleece that heaven flings O'er his little pearly wings, Light above the rocks I play, Where Niagara's starry spray, Frozen on the cliff, appears Like a giant's starting tears. There, amid the island-sedge, Just upon the cataract's edge, Where the foot of living man Never trod since time began, Lone I sit, at close of day, While, beneath the golden ray, Icy columns gleam below, Feather'd round with falling snow, And an arch of glory springs, Sparkling as the chain of rings Round the neck of virgins hung,— Virgins Lafitau supposes that there was an order of vestals established among the Iroquois Indians. —Mœurs des Sauvages Américains, &amp;c. tom. i. p. 173., who have wander'd young O'er the waters of the west To the land where spirits rest! Thus have I charm'd, with visionary lay, The lonely moments of the night away; And now, fresh daylight o'er the water beams! Once more, embark'd upon the glittering streams, Our boat flies light along the leafy shore, Shooting the falls, without a dip of oar Or breath of zephyr, like the mystic bark The poet saw, in dreams divinely dark, Borne, without sails, along the dusky flood Vedi che sdegna gli argomenti umani; Si che remo non vuol, ne altro velo, Che l' ale sue tra liti si lontani. Vedi come l' ha dritte verso 'l cielo Trattando l' aere con l' eterne penne; Che non si mutan, come mortal pelo. Dante, Purgator. cant. ii., While on its deck a pilot angel stood, And, with his wings of living light unfurl'd, Coasted the dim shores of another world! Yet, oh! believe me, mid this mingled maze Of nature's beauties, where the fancy strays From charm to charm, where every flow'ret's hue Hath something strange, and every leaf is new,— I never feel a joy so pure and still, So inly felt, as when some brook or hill, Or veteran oak, like those remember'd well, Some mountain echo or some wild-flower's smell, (For, who can say by what small fairy ties The mem'ry clings to pleasure as it flies?) Reminds my heart of many a silvan dream I once indulg'd by Trent's inspiring stream; Of all my sunny morns and moonlight nights On Donington's green lawns and breezy heights. Whether I trace the tranquil moments o'er When I have seen thee cull the fruits of lore, With him, the polish'd warrior, by thy side, A sister's idol and a nation's pride! When thou hast read of heroes, trophied high In ancient fame, and I have seen thine eye Turn to the living hero, while it read, For pure and brightening comments on the dead;— Or whether memory to my mind recalls The festal grandeur of those lordly halls, When guests have met around the sparkling board, And welcome warm'd the cup that luxury pour'd; When the bright future Star of England's throne, With magic smile, hath o'er the banquet shone, Winning respect, nor claiming what he won, But tempering greatness, like an evening sun Whose light the eye can tranquilly admire, Radiant, but mild, all softness, yet all fire;— Whatever hue my recollections take, Even the regret, the very pain they wake Is mix'd with happiness;—but, ah! no more— Lady! adieu—my heart has linger'd o'er Those vanish'd times, till all that round me lies, Stream, banks, and bowers have faded on my eyes! IMPROMPTU, AFTER A VISIT TO MRS. ?, OF MONTREAL. 'Twas but for a moment—and yet in that time She crowded th' impressions of many an hour: Her eye had a glow, like the sun of her clime, Which wak'd every feeling at once into flower. Oh! could we have borrow'd from Time but a day, To renew such impressions again and again, The things we should look and imagine and say Would be worth all the life we had wasted till then. What we had not the leisure or language to speak, We should find some more spiritual mode of revealing, And, between us, should feel just as much in a week As others would take a millennium in feeling. WRITTEN ON PASSING DEADMAN'S ISLAND This is one of the Magdalen Islands, and, singularly enough, is the property of Sir Isaac Coffin. The above lines were suggested by a superstition very common among sailors, who call this ghost-ship, I think, “the flying Dutchman.” We were thirteen days on our passage from Quebec to Halifax, and I had been so spoiled by the truly splendid hospitality of my friends of the Phaeton and Boston, that I was but ill prepared for the miseries of a Canadian vessel. The weather, however, was pleasant, and the scenery along the river delightful. Our passage through the Gut of Canso, with a bright sky and a fair wind, was particularly striking and romantic., IN THE GULF OF ST. LAWRENCE, LATE IN THE EVENING, SEPTEMBER, 1804. See you, beneath yon cloud so dark, Fast gliding along a gloomy bark? Her sails are full,—though the wind is still, And there blows not a breath her sails to fill! Say, what doth that vessel of darkness bear? The silent calm of the grave is there, Save now and again a death-knell rung, And the flap of the sails with night-fog hung. There lieth a wreck on the dismal shore Of cold and pitiless Labrador; Where, under the moon, upon mounts of frost, Full many a mariner's bones are tost. Yon shadowy bark hath been to that wreck, And the dim blue fire, that lights her deck, Doth play on as pale and livid a crew As ever yet drank the churchyard dew. To Deadman's Isle, in the eye of the blast, To Deadman's Isle, she speeds her fast; By skeleton shapes her sails are furl'd, And the hand that steers is not of this world! Oh! hurry thee on—oh! hurry thee on, Thou terrible bark, ere the night be gone, Nor let morning look on so foul a sight As would blanch for ever her rosy light! TO THE BOSTON FRIGATE Commanded by Captain J. E. Douglas, with whom I returned to England, and to whom I am indebted for many, many kindnesses. In truth, I should but offend the delicacy of my friend Douglas, and, at the same time, do injustice to my own feelings of gratitude, did I attempt to say how much I owe to him., ON LEAVING HALIFAX FOR ENGLAND, OCTOBER, 1804. ?????? ???????? ????????. Pindar. Pyth. 4. With triumph this morning, oh Boston! I hail The stir of thy deck and the spread of thy sail, For they tell me I soon shall be wafted, in thee, To the flourishing isle of the brave and the free, And that chill Nova-Scotia's unpromising strand Sir John Wentworth, the Governor of Nova-Scotia, very kindly allowed me to accompany him on his visit to the College, which they have lately established at Windsor, about forty miles from Halifax, and I was indeed most pleasantly surprised by the beauty and fertility of the country which opened upon us after the bleak and rocky wilderness by which Halifax is surrounded.—I was told that, in travelling onwards, we should find the soil and the scenery improve, and it gave me much pleasure to know that the worthy Governor has by no means such an “inamabile regnum” as I was, at first sight, inclined to believe. Is the last I shall tread of American land. Well—peace to the land! may her sons know, at length, That in high-minded honour lies liberty's strength, That though man be as free as the fetterless wind, As the wantonest air that the north can unbind, Yet, if health do not temper and sweeten the blast, If no harvest of mind ever sprung where it pass'd, Then unblest is such freedom, and baleful its might,— Free only to ruin, and strong but to blight! Farewell to the few I have left with regret; May they sometimes recall, what I cannot forget, The delight of those evenings,—too brief a delight! When in converse and song we have stol'n on the night; When they've ask'd me the manners, the mind, or the mien Of some bard I had known or some chief I had seen, Whose glory, though distant, they long had ador'd, Whose name had oft hallow'd the wine-cup they pour'd; And still as, with sympathy humble but true, I have told of each bright son of fame all I knew, They have listen'd, and sigh'd that the powerful stream Of America's empire should pass, like a dream, Without leaving one relic of genius, to say How sublime was the tide which had vanish'd away! Farewell to the few—though we never may meet On this planet again, it is soothing and sweet To think that, whenever my song or my name Shall recur to their ear, they'll recall me the same I have been to them now, young, unthoughtful, and blest, Ere hope had deceiv'd me or sorrow deprest. But, Douglas! while thus I recall to my mind The elect of the land we shall soon leave behind, I can read in the weather-wise glance of thine eye, As it follows the rack flitting over the sky, That the faint coming breeze will be fair for our flight, And shall steal us away, ere the falling of night. Dear Douglas! thou knowest, with thee by my side, With thy friendship to soothe me, thy courage to guide, There is not a bleak isle in those summerless seas, Where the day comes in darkness, or shines but to freeze, Not a tract of the line, not a barbarous shore, That I could not with patience, with pleasure explore! Oh think then how gladly I follow thee now, When Hope smooths the billowy path of our prow, And each prosperous sigh of the west-springing wind Takes me nearer the home where my heart is inshrin'd; Where the smile of a father shall meet me again, And the tears of a mother turn bliss into pain; Where the kind voice of sisters shall steal to my heart, And ask it, in sighs, how we ever could part?— But see!—the bent top-sails are ready to swell— To the boat—I am with thee—Columbia, farewell!

Demosth. Philipp. iii. Boast on, my friend—though stript of all beside, Thy struggling nation still retains her pride Angli suos ac sua omnia impense mirantur; cæteras nationes despectui habent. —Barclay (as quoted in one of Dryden's prefaces).: That pride, which once in genuine glory woke When Marlborough fought, and brilliant St. John spoke; That pride which still, by time and shame unstung, Outlives even Wh?tel?cke's sword and H?wk?sb'ry's tongue! Boast on, my friend, while in this humbled isle England began very early to feel the effects of cruelty towards her dependencies. “The severity of her government (says Macpherson) contributed more to deprive her of the continental dominions of the family of Plantagenet than the arms of France.” —See his History, vol. i. Where Honour mourns and Freedom fears to smile, Where the bright light of England's fame is known But by the shadow o'er our fortunes thrown; Where, doom'd ourselves to nought but wrongs and slights “By the total reduction of the kingdom of Ireland in 1691 (says Burke), the ruin of the native Irish, and in a great measure, too, of the first races of the English, was completely accomplished. The new English interest was settled with as solid a stability as any thing in human affairs can look for. All the penal laws of that unparalleled code of oppression, which were made after the last event, were manifestly the effects of national hatred and scorn towards a conquered people, whom the victors delighted to trample upon, and were not at all afraid to provoke.” Yet this is the era to which the wise Common Council of Dublin refer us for “invaluable blessings,” &amp;c., We hear you boast of Britain's glorious rights, As wretched slaves, that under hatches lie, Hear those on deck extol the sun and sky! Boast on, while wandering through my native haunts, I coldly listen to thy patriot vaunts; And feel, though close our wedded countries twine, More sorrow for my own than pride from thine. Yet pause a moment—and if truths severe Can find an inlet to that courtly ear, Which hears no news but W?rd's gazetted lies, And loves no politics in rhyme but Pye's,— If aught can please thee but the good old saws Of “Church and State,” and “William's matchless laws,” And “Acts and Rights of glorious Eighty-eight,”— Things, which though now a century out of date, Still serve to ballast, with convenient words, A few crank arguments for speeching lords It never seems to occur to those orators and addressers who round off so many sentences and paragraphs with the Bill of Rights, the Act of Settlement, &amp;c., that most of the provisions which these Acts contained for the preservation of parliamentary independence have been long laid aside as romantic and troublesome. I never meet, I confess, with a politician who quotes seriously the Declaration of Rights, &amp;c., to prove the actual existence of English liberty, that I do not think of that marquis, whom Montesquieu mentions Liv. xxi. chap. 2., who set about looking for mines in the Pyrenees, on the strength of authorities which he had read in some ancient authors. The poor marquis toiled and searched in vain. He quoted his authorities to the last, but found no mines after all.,— Turn, while I tell how England's freedom found, Where most she look'd for life, her deadliest wound; How brave she struggled, while her foe was seen, How faint since Influence lent that foe a screen; How strong o'er James and Popery she prevail'd, How weakly fell, when Whigs and gold assail'd. The chief, perhaps the only advantage which has resulted from the system of influence, is that tranquil course of uninterrupted action which it has given to the administration of government. If kings must be paramount in the state (and their ministers for the time being always think so), the country is indebted to the Revolution for enabling them to become so quietly, and for removing skilfully the danger of those shocks and collisions which the alarming efforts of prerogative never failed to produce. Instead of vain and disturbing efforts to establish that speculative balance of the constitution, which, perhaps, has never existed but in the pages of Montesquieu and De Lolme, a preponderance is now silently yielded to one of the three estates, which carries the other two almost insensibly, but still effectually, along with it; and even though the path may lead eventually to destruction, yet its specious and gilded smoothness almost atones for the danger; and, like Milton's bridge over Chaos, it may be said to lead, “Smooth, easy, inoffensive, down to ?.” While kings were poor, and all those schemes unknown Which drain the people, to enrich the throne; Ere yet a yielding Commons had supplied Those chains of gold by which themselves are tied; Then proud Prerogative, untaught to creep With bribery's silent foot on Freedom's sleep, Frankly avow'd his bold enslaving plan, And claim'd a right from God to trample man! But Luther's schism had too much rous'd mankind For Hampden's truths to linger long behind; Nor then, when king-like popes had fallen so low, Could pope-like kings The drivelling correspondence between James I. and his “dog Steenie” (the Duke of Buckingham), which we find among the Hardwicke Papers, sufficiently shows, if we wanted any such illustration, into what doting, idiotic brains the plan of arbitrary power may enter. escape the levelling blow. That ponderous sceptre (in whose place we bow To the light talisman of influence now), Too gross, too visible to work the spell Which modern power performs, in fragments fell: In fragments lay, till, patch'd and painted o'er With fleurs-de-lys, it shone and scourged once more. 'Twas then, my friend, thy kneeling nation quaff'd Long, long and deep, the churchman's opiate draught Of passive, prone obedience—then took flight All sense of man's true dignity and right; And Britons slept so sluggish in their chain, That Freedom's watch-voice call'd almost in vain. Oh England! England! what a chance was thine, When the last tyrant of that ill-starr'd line Fled from his sullied crown, and left thee free To found thy own eternal liberty! How nobly high, in that propitious hour, Might patriot hands have rais'd the triple tower Tacitus has expressed his opinion, in a passage very frequently quoted, that such a distribution of power as the theory of the British constitution exhibits is merely a subject of bright speculation, “a system more easily praised than practised, and which, even could it happen to exist, would certainly not prove permanent;” and, in truth, a review of England's annals would dispose us to agree with the great historian's remark. For we find that at no period whatever has this balance of the three estates existed; that the nobles predominated till the policy of Henry VII., and his successor reduced their weight by breaking up the feudal system of property; that the power of the Crown became then supreme and absolute, till the bold encroachments of the Commons subverted the fabric altogether; that the alternate ascendency of prerogative and privilege distracted the period which followed the Restoration; and that, lastly, the Acts of 1688, by laying the foundation of an unbounded court-influence, have secured a preponderance to the Throne, which every succeeding year increases. So that the vaunted British constitution has never perhaps existed but in mere theory. Of British freedom, on a rock divine Which neither force could storm nor treachery mine! But no—the luminous, the lofty plan, Like mighty Babel, seem'd too bold for man; The curse of jarring tongues again was given To thwart a work which raised men nearer heaven. While Tories marr'd what Whigs had scarce begun, While Whigs undid what Whigs themselves had done The monarchs of Great Britain can never be sufficiently grateful for that accommodating spirit which led the Revolutionary Whigs to give away the crown, without imposing any of those restraints or stipulations which other men might have taken advantage of so favourable a moment to enforce, and in the framing of which they had so good a model to follow as the limitations proposed by the Lords Essex and Halifax, in the debate upon the Exclusion Bill. They not only condescended, however, to accept of places, but took care that these dignities should be no impediment to their “voice potential” in affairs of legislation; and although an Act was after many years suffered to pass, which by one of its articles disqualified placemen from serving as members of the House of Commons, it was yet not allowed to interfere with the influence of the reigning monarch, nor with that of his successor Anne. The purifying clause, indeed, was not to take effect till after the decease of the latter sovereign, and she very considerately repealed it altogether. So that, as representation has continued ever since, if the king were simple enough to send to foreign courts ambassadors who were most of them in the pay of those courts, he would be just as honestly and faithfully represented as are his people. It would be endless to enumerate all the favours which were conferred upon William by those “apostate Whigs.” They complimented him with the first suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act which had been hazarded since the confirmation of that privilege; and this example of our Deliverer's reign has not been lost upon any of his successors. They promoted the establishment of a standing army, and circulated in its defence the celebrated “Balancing Letter,” in which it is insinuated that England, even then, in her boasted hour of regeneration, was arrived at such a pitch of faction and corruption, that nothing could keep her in order but a Whig ministry and a standing army. They refused, as long as they could, to shorten the duration of parliaments; and though, in the Declaration of Rights, the necessity of such a reform was acknowledged, they were able, by arts not unknown to modern ministers, to brand those as traitors and republicans who urged it. See a pamphlet published in 1693, upon the King's refusing to sign the Triennial Bill, called “A Discourse between a Yeoman of Kent and a Knight of a Shire.”— “Hereupon (says the Yeoman) the gentleman grew angry, and said that I talked like a base commons-wealth man.” But the grand and distinguishing trait of their measures was the power they bestowed on the Crown of almost annihilating the freedom of elections,—of turning from its course, and ever defiling that great stream of Representation, which had, even in the most agitated periods, reflected some features of the people, but which, from thenceforth; became the Pactolus, the “aurifer amnis,” of the court, and served as a mirror of the national will and popular feeling no longer. We need but consult the writings of that time, to understand the astonishment then excited by measures, which the practice of a century has rendered not only familiar but necessary. See a pamphlet called “The Danger of mercenary Parliaments,” 1698; State Tracts, Will. III. vol. ii.; see also “Some Paradoxes presented as a New Year's Gift” (State Poems, vol. iii.)., The hour was lost, and William, with a smile, Saw Freedom weeping o'er the unfinish'd pile! Hence all the ills you suffer,—hence remain Such galling fragments of that feudal chain The last great wound given to the feudal system was the Act of the 12th of Charles II., which abolished the tenure of knight's service in capite, and which Blackstone compares, for its salutary influence upon property, to the boasted provisions of Magna Charta itself. Yet even in this Act we see the effects of that counteracting spirit which has contrived to weaken every effort of the English nation towards liberty. The exclusion of copyholders from their share of elective rights was permitted to remain as a brand of feudal servitude, and as an obstacle to the rise of that strong counterbalance which an equal representation of property would oppose to the weight of the Crown. If the managers of the Revolution had been sincere in their wishes for reform, they would not only have taken this fetter off the rights of election, but would have renewed the mode adopted in Cromwell's time of increasing the number of knights of the shire, to the exclusion of those rotten insignificant boroughs, which have tainted the whole mass of the constitution. Lord Clarendon calls this measure of Cromwell's “an alteration fit to be more warrantable made, and in a better time.” It formed part of Mr. Pitt's plan in 1783; but Pitt's plan of reform was a kind of announced dramatic piece, about as likely to be ever acted as Mr. Sheridan's “Foresters.”, Whose links, around you by the Norman flung, Though loosed and broke so often, still have clung. Hence sly Prerogative, like Jove of old, Has turn'd his thunder into showers of gold, Whose silent courtship wins securer joys, ? fore enim tutum iter et patens Converso in pretium Deo. Aurum per medios ire satellites, &amp;c. Horat. It would be a task not uninstructive to trace the history of Prerogative from the date of its strength under the Tudor princes, when Henry VII. and his successors “taught the people (as Nathaniel Bacon says) Historic. and Politic. Discourse, &amp;c. part ii. p. 114. to dance to the tune of Allegiance,” to the period of the Revolution, when the Throne, in its attacks upon liberty, began to exchange the noisy explosions of Prerogative for the silent and effectual air-gun of Influence. In following its course, too, since that memorable era, we shall find that, while the royal power has been abridged in branches where it might be made conducive to the interests of the people, it has been left in full and unshackled vigour against almost every point where the integrity of the constitution is vulnerable. For instance, the power of chartering boroughs, to whose capricious abuse in the hands of the Stuarts we are indebted for most of the present anomalies of representation, might, if suffered to remain, have in some degree atoned for its mischief, by restoring the old unchartered boroughs to their rights, and widening more equally the basis of the legislature. But, by the Act of Union with Scotland, this part of the prerogative was removed, lest Freedom should have a chance of being healed, even by the rust of the spear which had formerly wounded her. The dangerous power, however, of creating peers, which has been so often exercised for the government against the constitution, is still left in free and unqualified activity; notwithstanding the example of that celebrated Bill for the limitation of this ever-budding branch of prerogative, which was proposed in the reign of George I. under the peculiar sanction and recommendation of the Crown, but which the Whigs thought right to reject, with all that characteristic delicacy, which, in general, prevents them when enjoying the sweets of office themselves, from taking any uncourtly advantage of the Throne. It will be recollected, however, that the creation of the twelve peers by the Tories in Anne's reign (a measure which Swift, like a true party man, defends) gave these upright Whigs all possible alarm for their liberties. With regard to the generous fit about his prerogative which seized so unroyally the good king George I., historians have hinted that the paroxysm originated far more in hatred to his son than in love to the constitution. Coxe says that this Bill was projected by Sunderland. This, of course, however, is a calumny: no loyal person, acquainted with the annals of the three Georges, could possibly suspect any one of those gracious monarchs either of ill-will to his heir, or indifference for the constitution. Taints by degrees, and ruins without noise. While parliaments, no more those sacred things Which make and rule the destiny of kings, Like loaded dice by ministers are thrown, And each new set of sharpers cog their own. Hence the rich oil, that from the Treasury steals, Drips smooth o'er all the Constitution's wheels, Giving the old machine such pliant play “They drove so fast (says Welwood of the ministers of Charles I.), that it was no wonder that the wheels and chariot broke.” (Memoirs, p. 35.)—But this fatal accident, if we may judge from experience, is to be imputed far less to the folly and impetuosity of the drivers, than to the want of that suppling oil from the Treasury which has been found so necessary to make a government like that of England run smoothly. Had Charles been as well provided with this article as his successors have been since the happy Revolution, his Commons would never have merited from him the harsh appellation of “seditious vipers,” but would have been (as they now are, and I trust always will be) “dutiful Commons,” “loyal Commons,” &amp;c. &amp;c., and would have given him ship-money, or any other sort of money he might have fancied., That Court and Commons jog one joltless way, While Wisdom trembles for the crazy car, So gilt, so rotten, carrying fools so far; And the duped people, hourly doom'd to pay The sums that bribe their liberties away Among those auxiliaries which the Revolution of 1688 marshalled on the side of the Throne, the bugbear of Popery has not been the least convenient and serviceable. Those unskilful tyrants. Charles and James, instead of profiting by that useful subserviency which has always distinguished the ministers of our religious establishment, were so infatuated as to plan the ruin of this best bulwark of their power, and, moreover, connected their designs upon the Church so undisguisedly with their attacks upon the Constitution, that they identified in the minds of the people the interests of their religion and their liberties. During those times, therefore, “No Popery” was the watchword of freedom, and served to keep the public spirit awake against the invasions of bigotry and prerogative. The Revolution, however, by removing this object of jealousy, has produced a reliance on the orthodoxy of the Throne, of which the Throne has not failed to take advantage; and the cry of “No Popery” having thus lost its power of alarming the people against the inroads of the Crown, has served ever since the very different purpose of strengthening the Crown against the pretensions and struggles of the people. The danger of the Church from Papists and Pretenders was the chief pretext for the repeal of the Triennial Bill, for the adoption of a standing army, for the numerous suspensions of the Habeas Corpus Act, and, in short, for all those spirited infractions of the constitution by which the reigns of the last century were so eminently distinguished. We have seen very lately, too, how the Throne has been enabled, by the same scarecrow sort of alarm, to select its ministers from among men, whose servility is their only claim to elevation, and who are pledged (if such an alternative could arise) to take part with the scruples of the King against the salvation of the empire.,— Like a young eagle, who has lent his plume To fledge the shaft by which he meets his doom,— See their own feathers pluck'd, to wing the dart Which rank corruption destines for their heart! But soft! methinks I hear thee proudly say, “What! shall I listen to the impious lay, “That dares, with Tory licence, to profane “The bright bequests of William's glorious reign? “Shall the great wisdom of our patriot sires, “Whom H?wks?b?y quotes and savoury B?rch admires, “Be slander'd thus? shall honest St?le agree “With virtuous R?se to call us pure and free, “Yet fail to prove it? Shall our patent pair “Of wise state-poets waste their words in air, “And P?e unheeded breathe his prosperous strain, “And C?nn?ng take the people's sense in vain?” Somebody has said, “Quand tous les poëtes seraient noyés, ce ne serait pas grand dommage;” but I am aware that this is not fit language to be held at a time when our birth-day odes and state-papers are written by such pretty poets as Mr. P?e and Mr. C?nn?ng. All I wish is, that the latter gentleman would change places with his brother P?e, by which means we should have somewhat less prose in our odes, and certainly less poetry in our politics. The people!—ah, that Freedom's form should stay Where Freedom's spirit long hath pass'd away! That a false smile should play around the dead, And flush the features when the soul hath fled! “It is a scandal (said Sir Charles Sedley in William's reign) that a government so sick at heart as ours is should look so well in the face;” and Edmund Burke has said, in the present reign, “When the people conceive that laws and tribunals, and even popular assemblies, are perverted from the ends of their institution, they find in these names of degenerated establishments only new motives to discontent. Those bodies which, when full of life and beauty, lay in their arms and were their joy and comfort, when dead and putrid become more loathsome from remembrance of former endearments.” —Thoughts on the present Discontents, 1770. When Rome had lost her virtue with her rights, When her foul tyrant sat on Capreæ's heights ? Tutor haberi Principis, Augustâ Caprearum in rupe sedentis Cum grege Chaldæo. Juvenal. Sat. x. v. 92. The senate still continued, during the reign of Tiberius, to manage all the business of the public; the money was then and long after coined by their authority, and every other public affair received their sanction. We are told by Tacitus of a certain race of men, who made themselves particularly useful to the Roman emperors, and were therefore called “instrumenta regni,” or “court tools.” From this it appears, that my Lords M?, C?, &amp;c. &amp;c. are by no means things of modern invention. Amid his ruffian spies, and doom'd to death Each noble name they blasted with their breath,— Even then, (in mockery of that golden time, When the Republic rose revered, sublime, And her proud sons, diffused from zone to zone, Gave kings to every nation but their own,) Even then the senate and the tribunes stood, Insulting marks, to show how high the flood Of Freedom flow'd, in glory's by-gone day, And how it ebb'd,—for ever ebb'd away! There is something very touching in what Tacitus tells us of the hopes that revived in a few patriot bosoms, when the death of Augustus was near approaching, and the fond expectation with which they already began “bona libertatis incassum disserere.” According to Ferguson, Cæsar's interference with the rights of election “made the subversion of the republic more felt than any of the former acts of his power.” —Roman Republic, book v. chap. i. Look but around—though yet a tyrant's sword Nor haunts our sleep nor glitters o'er our board, Though blood be better drawn, by modern quacks, With Treasury leeches than with sword or axe; Yet say, could even a prostrate tribune's power, Or a mock senate, in Rome's servile hour, Insult so much the claims, the rights of man, As doth that fetter'd mob, that free divan, Of noble tools and honourable knaves, Of pension'd patriots and privileged slaves;— That party-colour'd mass, which nought can warm But rank corruption's heat—whose quicken'd swarm Spread their light wings in Bribery's golden sky, Buzz for a period, lay their eggs, and die;— That greedy vampire, which from Freedom's tomb Comes forth, with all the mimicry of bloom Upon its lifeless cheek, and sucks and drains A people's blood to feed its putrid veins! Thou start'st, my friend, at picture drawn so dark— “Is there no light?” thou ask'st—“no lingering spark “Of ancient fire to warm us? Lives there none, “To act a Marvell's part?” Andrew Marvell, the honest opposer of the court during the reign of Charles the Second, and the last member of parliament who, according to the ancient mode, took wages from his constituents. The Commons have, since then, much changed their pay-masters. —See the State Poems for some rude but spirited effusions of Andrew Marvell.—alas! not one. To place and power all public spirit tends, In place and power all public spirit ends The following artless speech of Sir Francis Winnington, in the reign of Charles the Second, will amuse those who are fully aware of the perfection we have since attained in that system of government whose humble beginnings so much astonished the worthy baronet. “I did observe (says he) that all those who had pensions, and most of those who had offices, voted all of a side, as they were directed by some great officer, exactly as if their business in this House had been to preserve their pensions and offices, and not to make laws for the good of them who sent them here.”—He alludes to that parliament which was called, par excellence, the Pensionary Parliament.; Like hardy plants, that love the air and sky, When out, 'twill thrive—but taken in, 'twill die! Not bolder truths of sacred Freedom hung From Sidney's pen or burn'd on Fox's tongue, Than upstart Whigs produce each market-night, While yet their conscience, as their purse, is light; While debts at home excite their care for those Which, dire to tell, their much-lov'd country owes, And loud and upright, till their prize be known, They thwart the King's supplies to raise their own. But bees, on flowers alighting, cease their hum— So, settling upon places, Whigs grow dumb. And, though most base is he who, 'neath the shade Of Freedom's ensign plies corruption's trade, And makes the sacred flag he dares to show His passport to the market of her foe, Yet, yet, I own, so venerably dear Are Freedom's grave old anthems to my ear, That I enjoy them, though by traitors sung, And reverence Scripture even from Satan's tongue. Nay, when the constitution has expired, I'll have such men, like Irish wakers, hired To chant old “Habeas Corpus” by its side, And ask, in purchas'd ditties, why it died? See yon smooth lord, whom nature's plastic pains Would seem to've fashion'd for those Eastern reigns When eunuchs flourish'd, and such nerveless things As men rejected were the chosen of kings According to Xenophon, the chief circumstance which recommended these creatures to the service of Eastern princes was the ignominious station they held in society, and the probability of their being, upon this account, more devoted to the will and caprice of a master, from whose notice alone they derived consideration, and in whose favour they might seek refuge from the general contempt of mankind.—?????? ????? ?? ???????? ???? ???? ?????? ????????? ??? ??? ????? ???????? ????????? ???????????.—But I doubt whether even an Eastern prince would have chosen an entire administration upon this principle.;— Even he, forsooth, (oh fraud, of all the worst!) Dared to assume the patriot's name at first— Thus Pitt began, and thus begin his apes; Thus devils, when first raised, take pleasing shapes But oh, poor Ireland! if revenge be sweet For centuries of wrong, for dark deceit And withering insult—for the Union thrown Into thy bitter cup “And in the cup an Union shall be thrown.” Hamlet., when that alone Of slavery's draught was wanting Among the many measures, which, since the Revolution, have contributed to increase the influence of the Throne, and to feed up this “Aaron's serpent” of the constitution to its present healthy and respectable magnitude, there have been few more nutritive than the Scotch and Irish Unions. Sir John Packer said, in a debate upon the former question, that “he would submit it to the House, whether men who had basely betrayed their trust, by giving up their independent constitution, were fit to be admitted into the English House of Commons.” But Sir John would have known, if he had not been out of place at the time, that the pliancy of such materials was not among the least of their recommendations. Indeed, the promoters of the Scotch Union were by no means disappointed in the leading object of their measure, for the triumphant majorities of the court-party in parliament may be dated from the admission of the 45 and the 16. Once or twice, upon the alteration of their law of treason and the imposition of the malt-tax (measures which were in direct violation of the Act of Union), these worthy North Britons arrayed themselves in opposition to the court; but finding this effort for their country unavailing, they prudently determined to think thenceforward of themselves, and few men have ever kept to a laudable resolution more firmly. The effect of Irish representation on the liberties of England will be no less perceptible and permanent. ????? ??? ?????? ???????? ??????????? From Aratus (v. 715.) a poet who wrote upon astronomy, though, as Cicero assures us, he knew nothing whatever about the subject: just as the great Harvey wrote “De Generatione,” though he had as little to do with the matter as my Lord Viscount C. The infusion of such cheap and useful ingredients as my Lord L., Mr. D. B., &amp;c. &amp;c. into the legislature, cannot but act as a powerful alterative on the constitution, and clear it by degrees of all troublesome humours of honesty.—if for this Revenge be sweet, thou hast that dæmon's bliss; For, sure, 'tis more than hell's revenge to see That England trusts the men who've ruin'd thee;— That, in these awful days, when every hour Creates some new or blasts some ancient power, When proud Napoleon, like th' enchanted shield The magician's shield in Ariosto:— E tolto per vertù dello splendore La libertate a loro.

We are told that Cæsar's code of morality was contained in the following lines of Euripides, which that great man frequently repeated:— ????? ??? ??????? ??? ?????????? ???? ????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ????? This is also, as it appears, the moral code of Napoleon. Whose light compell'd each wondering foe to yield, With baleful lustre blinds the brave and free, And dazzles Europe into slavery,— That, in this hour, when patriot zeal should guide, When Mind should rule, and—Fox should not have died, All that devoted England can oppose To enemies made fiends and friends made foes, Is the rank refuse, the despised remains Of that unpitying power, whose whips and chains Drove Ireland first to turn, with harlot glance, Tow'rds other shores, and woo th' embrace of France;— Those hack'd and tainted tools, so foully fit For the grand artisan of mischief, P?tt, So useless ever but in vile employ, So weak to save, so vigorous to destroy— Such are the men that guard thy threaten'd shore, Oh England! sinking England! The following prophetic remarks occur in a letter written by Sir Robert Talbot, who attended the Duke of Bedford to Paris in 1762. Talking of states which have grown powerful in commerce, he says, “According to the nature and common course of things, there is a confederacy against them, and consequently in the same proportion as they increase in riches, they approach to destruction. The address of our King William, in making all Europe take the alarm at France, has brought that country before us near that inevitable period. We must necessarily have our turn, and Great Britain will attain it as soon as France shall have a declaimer with organs as proper for that political purpose as were those of our William the Third ? Without doubt, my Lord, Great Britain must lower her flight. Europe will remind us of the balance of commerce, as she has reminded France of the balance of power. The address of our statesmen will immortalise them by contriving for us a descent which shall not be a fall, by making us rather resemble Holland than Carthage and Venice.” —Letters on the French Nation. boast no more. INTOLERANCE, A SATIRE. “This clamour, which pretends to be raised for the safety of religion, has almost worn out the very appearance of it, and rendered us not only the most divided but the most immoral people upon the face of the earth.” Addison, Freeholder, No. 37. Start not, my friend, nor think the Muse will stain Her classic fingers with the dust profane Of Bulls, Decrees, and all those thundering scrolls, Which took such freedom once with royal souls The king-deposing doctrine, notwithstanding its many mischievous absurdities, was of no little service to the cause of political liberty, by inculcating the right of resistance to tyrants, and asserting the will of the people to be the only true fountain of power. Bellarmine, the most violent of the advocates for papal authority, was one of the first to maintain (De Pontif. lib. i. cap. 7.), “that kings have not their authority or office immediately from God nor his law, but only from the law of nations;” and in King James's “Defence of the Rights of Kings against Cardinal Perron,” we find his Majesty expressing strong indignation against the Cardinal for having asserted “that to the deposing of a king the consent of the people must be obtained”—“for by these words (says James) the people are exalted above the king, and made the judges of the king's deposing,” p. 424.—Even in Mariana's celebrated book, where the nonsense of bigotry does not interfere, there may be found many liberal and enlightened views of the principles of government, of the restraints which should be imposed upon royal power, of the subordination of the Throne to the interests of the people, &amp;c. &amp;c. (De Rege et Regis Institutione. See particularly lib. i. cap. 6. 8. and 9.)—It is rather remarkable, too, that England should be indebted to another Jesuit for the earliest defence of that principle upon which the Revolution was founded, namely, the right of the people to change the succession.—(See Doleman's “Conferences,” written in support of the title of the Infanta of Spain against that of James I.)—When Englishmen, therefore, say that Popery is the religion of slavery, they should not only recollect that their own boasted constitution is the work and bequest of popish ancestors; they should not only remember the laws of Edward III., “under whom (says Bolingbroke) the constitution of our parliaments, and the whole form of our government, became reduced into better form;” but they should know that even the errors charged on Popery have leaned to the cause of liberty, and that Papists were the first promulgators of the doctrines which led to the Revolution.—In general, however, the political principles of the Roman Catholics have been described as happened to suit the temporary convenience of their oppressors, and have been represented alternately as slavish or refractory, according as a pretext for tormenting them was wanting. The same inconsistency has marked every other imputation against them. They are charged with laxity in the observance of oaths, though an oath has been found sufficient to shut them out from all worldly advantages. If they reject certain decisions of their church, they are said to be sceptics and bad Christians; if they admit those very decisions, they are branded as bigots and bad subjects. We are told that confidence and kindness will make them enemies to the government, though we know that exclusion and injuries have hardly prevented them from being its friends. In short, nothing can better illustrate the misery of those shifts and evasions by which a long course of cowardly injustice must be supported, than the whole history of Great Britain's conduct towards the Catholic part of her empire., When heaven was yet the pope's exclusive trade, And kings were damn'd as fast as now they're made. No, no—let D?gen?n search the papal chair The “Sella Stercoraria” of the popes.—The Right Honourable and learned Doctor will find an engraving of this chair in Spanheim's “Disquisitio Historica de Papâ Fœminâ” (p. 118.); and I recommend it as a model for the fashion of that seat which the Doctor is about to take in the privy-council of Ireland. For fragrant treasures long forgotten there; And, as the witch of sunless Lapland thinks That little swarthy gnomes delight in stinks, Let sallow P?rc?v?l snuff up the gale Which wizard D?gen?n's gather'd sweets exhale. Enough for me, whose heart has learn'd to scorn Bigots alike in Rome or England born, Who loathe the venom, whencesoe'er it springs, From popes or lawyers When Innocent X. was entreated to decide the controversy between the Jesuits and the Jansenists, he answered, that “he had been bred a lawyer, and had therefore nothing to do with divinity.”—It were to be wished that some of our English pettifoggers knew their own fit element as well as Pope Innocent X., pastry-cooks or kings,— Enough for me to laugh and weep by turns, As mirth provokes, or indignation burns, As C?nn?ng vapours, or as France succeeds, As H?wk?sb'ry proses, or as Ireland bleeds! And thou, my friend, if, in these headlong days, When bigot Zeal her drunken antics plays So near a precipice, that men the while Look breathless on and shudder while they smile— If, in such fearful days, thou'lt dare to look To hapless Ireland, to this rankling nook Which Heaven hath freed from poisonous things in vain, While G?ff?rd's tongue and M?sgr?ve's pen remain— If thou hast yet no golden blinkers got To shade thine eyes from this devoted spot, Whose wrongs, though blazon'd o'er the world they be, Placemen alone are privileged not to see— Oh! turn awhile, and, though the shamrock wreathes My homely harp, yet shall the song it breathes Of Ireland's slavery, and of Ireland's woes, Live, when the memory of her tyrant foes Shall but exist, all future knaves to warn, Embalm'd in hate and canonised by scorn. When C?stl?r?gh, in sleep still more profound Than his own opiate tongue now deals around, Shall wait th' impeachment of that awful day. Which even his practised hand can't bribe away. Yes, my dear friend, wert thou but near me now, To see how Spring lights up on Erin's brow Smiles that shine out, unconquerably fair, Even through the blood-marks left by C?md?n Not the C?md?n who speaks thus of Ireland:— “To wind up all, whether we regard the fruitfulness of the soil, the advantage of the sea, with so many commodious havens, or the natives themselves, who are warlike, ingenious, handsome, and well-complexioned, soft-skinned and very nimble, by reason of the pliantness of their muscles, this Island is in many respects so happy, that Giraldus might very well say, ‘Nature had regarded with more favourable eyes than ordinary this Kingdom of Zephyr.’” there,— Could'st thou but see what verdure paints the sod Which none but tyrants and their slaves have trod, And didst thou know the spirit, kind and brave, That warms the soul of each insulted slave, Who, tired with struggling, sinks beneath his lot, And seems by all but watchful France forgot The example of toleration, which Bonaparte has held forth, will, I fear, produce no other effect than that of determining the British government to persist, from the very spirit of opposition, in their own old system of intolerance and injustice; just as the Siamese blacken their teeth, “because,” as they say, “the devil has white ones.” See l'Histoire Naturelle et Polit. du Royaume de Siam, &amp;c.— Thy heart would burn—yes, even thy Pittite heart Would burn, to think that such a blooming part Of the world's garden, rich in nature's charms, And fill'd with social souls and vigorous arms, Should be the victim of that canting crew, So smooth, so godly,—yet so devilish too; Who, arm'd at once with prayer-books and with whips One of the unhappy results of the controversy between Protestants and Catholics, is the mutual exposure which their criminations and recriminations have produced. In vain do the Protestants charge the Papists with closing the door of salvation upon others, while many of their own writings and articles breathe the same uncharitable spirit. No canon of Constance or Lateran ever damned heretics more effectually than the eighth of the Thirty-nine Articles consigns to perdition every single member of the Greek church; and I doubt whether a more sweeping clause of damnation was ever proposed in the most bigoted council, than that which the Calvinistic theory of predestination in the seventeenth of these Articles exhibits. It is true that no liberal Protestant avows such exclusive opinions; that every honest clergyman must feel a pang while he subscribes to them; that some even assert the Athanasian Creed to be the forgery of one Vigilius Tapsensis, in the beginning of the sixth century, and that eminent divines, like Jortin, have not hesitated to say, “There are propositions contained in our Liturgy and Articles, which no man of common sense amongst us believes.” Strictures on the Articles, Subscriptions, &amp;c. But while all this is freely conceded to Protestants; while nobody doubts their sincerity, when they declare that their articles are not essentials of faith, but a collection of opinions which have been promulgated by fallible men, and from many of which they feel themselves justified in dissenting,— while so much liberty of retractation is allowed to Protestants upon their own declared and subscribed Articles of religion, is it not strange that a similar indulgence should be so obstinately refused to the Catholics, upon tenets which their church has uniformly resisted and condemned, in every country where it has independently flourished? When the Catholics say, “The Decree of the Council of Lateran, which you object to us, has no claim whatever upon either our faith or our reason; it did not even profess to contain any doctrinal decision, but was merely a judicial proceeding of that assembly; and it would be as fair for us to impute a wife-killing doctrine to the Protestants, because their first pope, Henry VIII., was sanctioned in an indulgence of that propensity, as for you to conclude that we have inherited a king-deposing taste from the acts of the Council of Lateran, or the secular pretensions of our popes. With respect, too, to the Decree of the Council of Constance, upon the strength of which you accuse us of breaking faith with heretics, we do not hesitate to pronounce that Decree a calumnious forgery, a forgery, too, so obvious and ill-fabricated, that none but our enemies have ever ventured to give it the slightest credit for authenticity.”—When the Catholics make these declarations (and they are almost weary with making them), when they show, too, by their conduct, that these declarations are sincere, and that their faith and morals are no more regulated by the absurd decrees of old councils and popes, than their science is influenced by the papal anathema against that Irishman Virgilius, surnamed Solivagus, a native of Ireland, who maintained, in the 8th century, the doctrine of the Antipodes, and was anathematised accordingly by the Pope. John Scotus Erigena, another Irishman, was the first that ever wrote against transubstantiation. who first found out the Antipodes,—is it not strange that so many still wilfully distrust what every good man is so much interested in believing? That so many should prefer the dark-lantern of the 13th century to the sunshine of intellect which has since overspread the world, and that every dabbler in theology, from Mr. Le Mesurier down to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, should dare to oppose the rubbish of Constance and Lateran to the bright and triumphant progress of justice, generosity, and truth?, Blood on their hands, and Scripture on their lips, Tyrants by creed, and torturers by text, Make this life hell, in honour of the next! Your R?desd?les, P?rc?v?ls,—great, glorious Heaven, If I'm presumptuous, be my tongue forgiven, When here I swear, by my soul's hope of rest, I'd rather have been born, ere man was blest With the pure dawn of Revelation's light, Yes,—rather plunge me back in Pagan night, And take my chance with Socrates for bliss In a singular work, written by one Franciscus Collius, “upon the Souls of the Pagans,” the author discusses, with much coolness and erudition, all the probable chances of salvation upon which a heathen philosopher might calculate. Consigning to perdition without much difficulty Plato, Socrates, &amp;c. the only sage at whose fate he seems to hesitate is Pythagoras, in consideration of his golden thigh, and the many miracles which he performed. But, having balanced a little his claims, and finding reason to father all these miracles on the devil, he at length, in the twenty-fifth chapter, decides upon damning him also. (De Animabus Paganorum, lib. iv. cap. 20. and 25.)—The poet Dante compromises the matter with the Pagans, and gives them a neutral territory or limbo of their own, where their employment, it must be owned, is not very enviable—“Senza speme vivemo in desio.”—Cant. iv.— Among the numerous errors imputed to Origen, he is accused of having denied the eternity of future punishment; and, if he never advanced a more irrational doctrine, we may venture, I think, to forgive him. He went so far, however, as to include the devil himself in the general hell-delivery which he supposed would one day or other take place, and in this St. Augustin thinks him rather too merciful—“Miserecordior profecto fuit Origenes, qui et ipsum diabolum,” &amp;c. (De Civitat. Dei. lib. xxi. cap. 17.)—According to St. Jerom, it was Origen's opinion, that “the devil himself, after a certain time, will be as well off as the angel Gabriel”—“Id ipsum fore Gabrielem quod diabolum.” (See his Epistle to Pammachius.) But Halloix, in his Defence of Origen, denies strongly that this learned father had any such misplaced tenderness for the devil., Than be the Christian of a faith like this, Which builds on heavenly cant its earthly sway, And in a convert mourns to lose a prey; Which, grasping human hearts with double hold,— Like Danäe's lover mixing god and gold Mr. Fox, in his Speech on the Repeal of the Test Act (1790), thus condemns the intermixture of religion wih the political constitution of a state:—“What purpose (he asks) can it serve, except the baleful purpose of communicating and receiving contamination? Under such an alliance corruption must alight upon the one, and slavery overwhelm the other.” Locke, too, says of the connection between church and state, “The boundaries on both sides are fixed and immoveable. He jumbles heaven and earth together, the things most remote and opposite, who mixes these two societies, which are in their original, end, business, and in every thing, perfectly distinct and infinitely different from each other.” —First Letter on Toleration. The corruptions introduced into Christianity may be dated from the period of its establishment under Constantine, nor could all the splendour which it then acquired atone for the peace and purity which it lost.,— Corrupts both state and church, and makes an oath The knave and atheist's passport into both; Which, while it dooms dissenting souls to know Nor bliss above nor liberty below, Adds the slave's suffering to the sinner's fear, And, lest he 'scape hereafter, racks him here! There has been, after all, quite as much intolerance among Protestants as among Papists. According to the hackneyed quotation— Iliacos intra muros peccatur et extra. Even the great champion of the Reformation, Melanchthon, whom Jortin calls “a divine of much mildness and good-nature,” thus expresses his approbation of the burning of Servetus: “Legi (he says to Bullinger) quæ de Serveti blasphemiis respondistis, et pietatem ac judicia vestra probo. Judico etiam senatum Genevensem rectè fecisse, quod hominem pertinacem et non omissurum blasphemias sustulit; ac miratus sum esse qui severitatem illam improbent.”—I have great pleasure in contrasting with these “mild and good-natured” sentiments the following words of the Papist Baluze, in addressing his friend Conringius: “Interim amemus, mî Conringi, et tametsi diversas opiniones tuemur in causâ religionis, moribus tamen diversi non simus, qui eadem literarum studia sectamur.” —Herman. Conring. Epistol. par. secund. p. 56. Hume tells us that the Commons, in the beginning of Charles the First's reign, “attacked Montague, one of the King's chaplains, on account of a moderate book which he had lately composed, and which, to their great disgust, saved virtuous Catholics, as well as other Christians, from eternal torments.”—In the same manner a complaint was lodged before the Lords of the Council against that excellent writer Hooker, for having, in a Sermon against Popery, attempted to save many of his Popish ancestors for ignorance.—To these examples of Protestant toleration I shall beg leave to oppose the following extract from a letter of old Roger Ascham (the tutor of Queen Elizabeth), which is preserved among the Harrington Papers, and was written in 1566, to the Earl of Leicester, complaining of the Archbishop Young, who had taken away his prebend in the church of York: “Master Bourne Sir John Bourne, Principal Secretary of State to Queen Mary. did never grieve me half so moche in offering me wrong, as Mr. Dudley and the Byshopp of York doe, in taking away my right. No byshopp in Q. Mary's time would have so dealt with me; not Mr. Bourne hymself, when Winchester lived, durst have so dealt with me. For suche good estimation in those dayes even the learnedst and wysest men, as Gardener and Cardinal Poole, made of my poore service, that although they knewe perfectly that in religion, both by open wrytinge and pryvie talke, I was contrarye unto them; yea, when Sir Francis Englefield by name did note me speciallye at the councill-board, Gardener would not suffer me to be called thither, nor touched ellswheare, saiinge suche words of me in a lettre, as, though lettres cannot, I blushe to write them to your lordshipp. Winchester's good-will stoode not in speaking faire and wishing well, but he did in deede that for me By Gardener's favour Ascham long held his fellowship, though not resident., whereby my wife and children shall live the better when I am gone.” (See Nugæ Antiquæ, vol. i. pp. 98, 99.)— If men who acted thus were bigots, what shall we call Mr. P?rc?v?l? In Sutcliffe's “Survey of Popery” there occurs the following assertion:—“Papists, that positively hold the heretical and false doctrines of the modern church of Rome, cannot possibly be saved.”—As a contrast to this and other specimens of Protestant liberality, which it would be much more easy than pleasant to collect, I refer my reader to the Declaration of Le Père Courayer;—doubting not that, while he reads the sentiments of this pious man upon toleration, he will feel inclined to exclaim with Belsham, “Blush, ye Protestant bigots! and be confounded at the comparison of your own wretched and malignant prejudices with the generous and enlarged ideas, the noble and animated language of this Popish priest.”— Essays, xxvii. p. 86. But no—far other faith, far milder beams Of heavenly justice warm the Christian's dreams; His creed is writ on Mercy's page above, By the pure hands of all-atoning Love; He weeps to see abused Religion twine Round Tyranny's coarse brow her wreath divine; And he, while round him sects and nations raise To the one God their varying notes of praise, Blesses each voice, whate'er its tone may be, That serves to swell the general harmony. “La tolérance est la chose du monde la plus propre à ramener le siècle d'or, et à faire un concert et une harmonie de plusieurs voix et instruments de différents tons et notes, aussi agréable pour le moins que l'uniformité d'une seule voix.” Bayle, Commentaire Philosophique, &amp;c. part ii. chap. vi.— Both Bayle and Locke would have treated the subject of Toleration in a manner much more worthy of themselves and of the cause, if they had written in an age less distracted by religious prejudices. Such was the spirit, gently, grandly bright, That fill'd, oh Fox! thy peaceful soul with light; While free and spacious as that ambient air Which folds our planet in its circling care, The mighty sphere of thy transparent mind Embraced the world, and breathed for all mankind. Last of the great, farewell!—yet not the last— Though Britain's sunshine hour with thee be past, Ierne still one ray of glory gives, And feels but half thy loss while Grattan lives. THE SCEPTIC, A PHILOSOPHICAL SATIRE. ????? ?????? ???????. Pindar. ap. Herodot. lib. iii. THE SCEPTIC. As the gay tint, that decks the vernal rose “The particular bulk, number, figure, and motion of the parts of fire or snow are really in them, whether any one perceive them or not, and therefore they may be called real qualities, because they really exist in those bodies; but light, heat, whiteness, or coldness, are no more really in them than sickness or pain is in manna. Take away the sensation of them; let not the eye see light or colours, nor the ears hear sounds; let the palate not taste, nor the nose smell, and all colours, tastes, odours, and sounds, as they are such particular ideas, vanish and cease.” —Locke, book ii. chap. 8. Bishop Berkeley, it is well known, extended this doctrine even to primary qualities, and supposed that matter itself has but an ideal existence. But, how are we to apply his theory to that period which preceded the formation of man, when our system of sensible things was produced, and the sun shone, and the waters flowed, without any sentient being to witness them? The spectator, whom Whiston supplies, will scarcely solve the difficulty: “To speak my mind freely,” says he, “I believe that the Messias was there actually present.” —See Whiston, of the Mosaic Creation., Not in the flower, but in our vision glows; As the ripe flavour of Falernian tides Not in the wine, but in our taste resides; So when, with heartfelt tribute, we declare That Marco's honest and that Susan's fair, 'Tis in our minds, and not in Susan's eyes Or Marco's life, the worth or beauty lies: For she, in flat-nosed China, would appear As plain a thing as Lady Anne is here; And one light joke at rich Loretto's dome Would rank good Marco with the damn'd at Rome. There's no deformity so vile, so base, That 'tis not somewhere thought a charm, a grace; No foul reproach, that may not steal a beam From other suns, to bleach it to esteem. Boetius employs this argument of the Sceptics among his consolatory reflections upon the emptiness of fame. “Quid quod diversarum gentium mores inter se atque instituta discordant, ut quod apud alios laude, apud alios supplicio dignum judicetur?”—Lib. ii. prosa 7. Many amusing instances of diversity, in the tastes, manners, and morals of different nations, may be found throughout the works of that amusing Sceptic Le Mothe le Vayer.—See his Opuscule Sceptique, his Treatise “De la Secte Sceptique,” and, above all, those Dialogues, not to be found in his works, which he published under the name of Horatius Tubero.—The chief objection to these writings of Le Vayer (and it is a blemish which may be felt also in the Esprit des Loix), is the suspicious obscurity of the sources from whence he frequently draws his instances, and the indiscriminate use made by him of the lowest populace of the library,—those lying travellers and wonder-mongers, of whom Shaftesbury, in his Advice to an Author, complains, as having tended in his own time to the diffusion of a very shallow and vicious sort of scepticism.— Vol. i. p. 352. The Pyrrhonism of Le Vayer, however, is of the most innocent and playful kind; and Villemandy, the author of Scepticismus Debellatus, exempts him specially in the declaration of war which he denounces against the other armed neutrals of the sect, in consideration of the orthodox limits within which he confines his incredulity. Ask, who is wise?—you'll find the self-same man A sage in France, a madman in Japan; And here some head beneath a mitre swells, Which there had tingled to a cap and bells: Nay, there may yet some monstrous region be, Unknown to Cook, and from Napoleon free, Where C?stl?r?gh would for a patriot pass, And mouthing M?ve scarce be deem'd an ass! “List not to reason (Epicurus cries), “But trust the senses, there conviction lies This was the creed also of those modern Epicureans, whom Ninon de l'Enclos collected around her in the Rue des Tournelles, and whose object seems to have been to decry the faculty of reason, as tending only to embarrass our wholesome use of pleasures, without enabling us, in any degree, to avoid their abuse. Madame des Houlières, the fair pupil of Des Barreaux in the arts of poetry and gallantry, has devoted most of her verses to this laudable purpose, and is even such a determined foe to reason, that, in one of her pastorals, she congratulates her sheep on the want of it. St. Evremont speaks thus upon the subject:— “Un mélange incertain d'esprit et de matière Nous fait vivre avec trop ou trop peu de lumière. Nature, élève-nous à la clarté des anges, Ou nous abaise au sens des simples animaux.” Which may be thus paraphrased:— Had man been made, at nature's birth, Of only flame or only earth, Had he been form'd a perfect whole Of purely that, or grossly this, Then sense would ne'er have clouded soul, Nor soul restrain'd the sense's bliss. Oh happy, had his light been strong, Or had he never shared a light, Which shines enough to show he's wrong, But not enough to lead him right.:”— Alas! they judge not by a purer light, Nor keep their fountains more untinged and bright: Habit so mars them, that the Russian swain Will sigh for train-oil, while he sips Champagne; And health so rules them, that a fever's heat Would make even Sh?r?d?n think water sweet. Just as the mind the erring sense See, among the fragments of Petronius, those verses beginning “Fallunt nos oculi,” &amp;c. The most sceptical of the ancient poets was Euripides; and it would, I think, puzzle the whole school of Pyrrho to produce a doubt more startling than the following:— ??? ?? ????? ?? ??? ????? ? ???????? ??????, ?? ??? ?? ???????? ????. See Laert. in Pyrrh. Socrates and Plato were the grand sources of ancient scepticism. According to Cicero (de Orator. lib. iii.), they supplied Arcesilas with the doctrines of the Middle Academy; and how closely these resembled the tenets of the Sceptics, may be seen even in Sextus Empiricus (lib. i. cap. 33.), who, with all his distinctions, can scarcely prove any difference. It appears strange that Epicurus should have been a dogmatist; and his natural temper would most probably have led him to the repose of scepticism, had not the Stoics, by their violent opposition to his doctrines, compelled him to be as obstinate as themselves. Plutarch, indeed, in reporting some of his opinions, represents him as having delivered them with considerable hesitation.—????????? ????? ??????????? ??????, ???????? ??? ???????????.—De Placit. Philosoph. lib. ii. cap. 13. See also the 21st and 22d chapters. But that the leading characteristics of the sect were self-sufficiency and dogmatism, appears from what Cicero says of Velleius, De Natur. Deor.—“Tum Velleius, fidenter sanè, ut solent isti, nihil tam verens quam ne dubitare aliquâ de re videretur.” believes, The erring mind, in turn, the sense deceives; And cold disgust can find but wrinkles there, Where passion fancies all that's smooth and fair. P????, who sees, upon his pillow laid, A face for which ten thousand pounds were paid, Can tell, how quick before a jury flies The spell that mock'd the warm seducer's eyes. Self is the medium through which Judgment's ray Can seldom pass without being turn'd astray. The smith of Ephesus Acts, chap. xix. “For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen.” thought Dian's shrine, By which his craft most throve, the most divine; And ev'n the true faith seems not half so true, When link'd with one good living as with two. Had W?lc?t first been pension'd by the throne, Kings would have suffer'd by his praise alone; And P?ine perhaps, for something snug per ann., Had laugh'd, like W?ll?sley, at all Rights of Man. But 'tis not only individual minds,— Whole nations, too, the same delusion blinds. Thus England, hot from Denmark's smoking meads, Turns up her eyes at Gallia's guilty deeds; Thus, self-pleas'd still, the same dishonouring chain She binds in Ireland, she would break in Spain; While prais'd at distance, but at home forbid, Rebels in Cork are patriots at Madrid. If Grotius be thy guide, shut, shut the book,— In force alone for Laws of Nations look.

For him no pension pours its annual fruits, No fertile sinecure spontaneous shoots; Not his the meed that crown'd Don H?kh?m's rhyme, Nor sees he e'er, in dreams of future time, Those shadowy forms of sleek reversions rise, So dear to Scotchmen's second-sighted eyes.

If, weary of the world's bewildering maze The agitation of the ship is one of the chief difficulties which impede the discovery of the longitude at sea; and the tumult and hurry of life are equally unfavourable to that calm level of mind which is necessary to an inquirer after truth.

By Tory Hume's seductive page beguiled, We fancy Charles was just and Strafford mild He defends Strafford's conduct as “innocent and even laudable.” In the same spirit, speaking of the arbitrary sentences of the Star Chamber, he says,—“The severity of the Star Chamber, which was generally ascribed to Laud's passionate disposition, was perhaps, in itself, somewhat blameable.”; And Fox himself, with party pencil, draws Monmouth a hero, “for the good old cause!” That flexibility of temper and opinion, which the habits of scepticism are so calculated to produce, are thus pleaded for by Mr. Fox, in the very sketch of Monmouth to which I allude; and this part of the picture the historian may be thought to have drawn from himself. “One of the most conspicuous features in his character seems to have been a remarkable, and, as some think, a culpable degree of flexibility. That such a disposition is preferable to its opposite extreme will be admitted by all, who think that modesty, even in excess, is more nearly allied to wisdom than conceit and self-sufficiency. He who has attentively considered the political, or indeed the general concerns of life, may possibly go still further, and may rank a willingness to be convinced, or, in some cases, even without conviction, to concede our own opinion to that of other men, among the principal ingredients in the composition of practical wisdom.”—It is right to observe, however, that the Sceptic's readiness of concession arises rather from uncertainty than conviction, more from a suspicion that his own opinion may be wrong, than from any persuasion that the opinion of his adversary is right. “It may be so,” was the courteous and sceptical formula, with which the Dutch were accustomed to reply to the statements of ambassadors. See Lloyd's State Worthies, art. Sir Thomas Wyat.

TO STEPHEN WOOLRICHE, ESQ. INTERCEPTED LETTERS, &amp;c. LETTER I. FROM THE PR?NC?SS CH?RL?E OF W?L?S TO THE LADY B?RB?A ASHL?Y. This young Lady, who is a Roman Catholic, had lately made a present of some beautiful Ponies to the Pr?nc?ss. My dear Lady Bab, you'll be shock'd, I'm afraid, When you hear the sad rumpus your Ponies have made; Since the time of horse-consuls (now long out of date), No nags ever made such a stir in the state. Lord Eld?n first heard—and as instantly pray'd he To “God and his King”—that a Popish young Lady (For though you've bright eyes and twelve thousand a year, It is still but too true you're a Papist, my dear,) Had insidiously sent, by a tall Irish groom, Two priest-ridden Ponies, just landed from Rome, And so full, little rogues, of pontifical tricks, That the dome of St. Paul's was scarce safe from their kicks. Off at once to Papa, in a flurry he flies— For Papa always does what these statesmen advise, On condition that they'll be, in turn, so polite As in no case whate'er to advise him too right— “Pretty doings are here, Sir (he angrily cries, While by dint of dark eyebrows he strives to look wise)— “'Tis a scheme of the Romanists, so help me God! “To ride over your most Royal Highness roughshod— “Excuse, Sir, my tears—they're from loyalty's source— “Bad enough 'twas for Troy to be sack'd by a Horse, “But for us to be ruin'd by Ponies still worse!” Quick a Council is call'd—the whole Cabinet sits— The Archbishops declare, frighten'd out of their wits, That if once Popish Ponies should eat at my manger, From that awful moment the Church is in danger! As, give them but stabling, and shortly no stalls Will suit their proud stomachs but those at St. Paul's. The Doctor Mr. Addington, so nicknamed., and he, the devout man of Leather Alluding to a tax lately laid upon leather., V?ns?tt?t, now laying their Saint-heads together, Declare that these skittish young a-bominations Are clearly foretold in Chap. vi. Revelations— Nay, they verily think they could point out the one Which the Doctor's friend Death was to canter upon. Lord H?rr?by, hoping that no one imputes To the Court any fancy to persecute brutes, Protests, on the word of himself and his cronies, That had these said creatures been Asses, not Ponies, The Court would have started no sort of objection, As Asses were, there, always sure of protection. “If the Pr?nc?ss will keep them (says Lord C?stl?r?gh), “To make them quite harmless, the only true way “Is (as certain Chief Justices do with their wives) “To flog them within half an inch of their lives. “If they've any bad Irish blood lurking about, “This (he knew by experience) would soon draw it out.” Should this be thought cruel, his Lordship proposes “The new Veto snaffle The question whether a Veto was to be allowed to the Crown in the appointment of Irish Catholic Bishops was, at this time, very generally and actively agitated. to bind down their noses— “A pretty contrivance, made out of old chains, “Which appears to indulge, while it doubly restrains; “Which, however high-mettled, their gamesomeness checks “(Adds his Lordship humanely), or else breaks their necks!” This proposal receiv'd pretty general applause From the Statesmen around—and the neck-breaking clause Had a vigour about it, which soon reconcil'd Even Eld?n himself to a measure so mild. So the snaffles, my dear, were agreed to nem. con., And my Lord C?stl?r?gh, having so often shone In the fettering line, is to buckle them on. I shall drive to your door in these Vetos some day, But, at present, adieu!—I must hurry away To go see my Mamma, as I'm suffer'd to meet her For just half an hour by the Qu?n's best repeater. Ch?rl?tte. LETTER II. FROM COLONEL M'M?H?N TO G?LD FR?NC?S L?CKIE, ESQ. Dear Sir, I've just had time to look Into your very learned Book For an account of this extraordinary work of Mr. Leckie, see the Edinburgh Review, vol. xx., Wherein—as plain as man can speak, Whose English is half modern Greek— You prove that we can ne'er intrench Our happy isles against the French, Till Royalty in England's made A much more independent trade;— In short, until the House of Guelph Lays Lords and Commons on the shelf, And boldly sets up for itself. All, that can well be understood In this said Book, is vastly good; And, as to what's incomprehensible, I dare be sworn 'tis full as sensible. But, to your work's immortal credit, The Pr?n?e, good Sir, the Pr?n?e has read it (The only Book, himself remarks, Which he has read since Mrs. Clarke's). Last levee-morn he look'd it through, During that awful hour or two Of grave tonsorial preparation, Which, to a fond, admiring nation, Sends forth, announc'd by trump and drum, The best-wigg'd Pr?n?e in Christendom. He thinks with you, th' imagination Of partnership in legislation Could only enter in the noddles Of dull and ledger-keeping twaddles, Whose heads on firms are running so, They ev'n must have a King and Co., And hence, most eloquently show forth On checks and balances, and so forth. But now, he trusts, we're coming near a Far more royal, loyal era; When England's monarch need but say, “Whip me those scoundrels, C?stl?r?gh!” Or, “Hang me up those Papists, Eld?n,” And 'twill be done—ay, faith, and well done. With view to which, I've his command To beg, Sir, from your travell'd hand, (Round which the foreign graces swarm “The truth indeed seems to be, that having lived so long abroad as evidently to have lost, in a great degree, the use of his native language, Mr. Leckie has gradually come not only to speak, but to feel, like a foreigner.” —Edinburgh Review.) A Plan of radical Reform; Compil'd and chos'n as best you can, In Turkey or at Ispahan, And quite upturning, branch and root, Lords, Commons, and Burdétt to boot. But, pray, whate'er you may impart, write Somewhat more brief than Major C?rtwr?ght: Else, though the Pr?e be long in rigging, 'Twould take, at least, a fortnight's wigging,— Two wigs to every paragraph— Before he well could get through half. You'll send it also speedily— As, truth to say, 'twixt you and me, His Highness, heated by your work, Already thinks himself Grand Turk! And you'd have laugh'd, had you seen how He scar'd the Ch?nc?ll?r just now, When (on his Lordship's entering puff'd) he Slapp'd his back and call'd him “Mufti!” The tailors too have got commands, To put directly into hands All sorts of Dulimans and Pouches, With Sashes, Turbans, and Paboutches, (While Y?rm?th's sketching out a plan Of new Moustaches à l'Ottomane) And all things fitting and expedient To turkify our gracious R?g?nt! You therefore, have no time to waste— So, send your System.— Yours, in haste. POSTSCRIPT. Before I send this scrawl away, I seize a moment, just to say, There's some parts of the Turkish system So vulgar, 'twere as well you miss'd 'em. For instance—in Seraglio matters— Your Turk, whom girlish fondness flatters, Would fill his Haram (tasteless fool!) With tittering, red-cheek'd things from school. But here (as in that fairy land, Where Love and Age went hand in hand The learned Colonel must allude here to a description of the Mysterious Isle, in the History of Abdalla, Son of Hanif, where such inversions of the order of nature are said to have taken place.—“A score of old women and the same number of old men played here and there in the court, some at chuck-farthing, others at tip-cat or at cockles.”— And again, “There is nothing, believe me, more engaging than those lovely wrinkles,” &amp;c. &amp;c.—See Tales of the East, vol. iii. pp. 607, 608.; Where lips, till sixty, shed no honey, And Grandams were worth any money,) Our Sultan has much riper notions— So, let your list of she-promotions Include those only, plump and sage, Who've reach'd the regulation-age; That is, (as near as one can fix From Peerage dates) full fifty-six. This rule's for fav'rites—nothing more— For, as to wives, a Grand Signor, Though not decidedly without them, Need never care one curse about them. LETTER III. FROM G?GE PR?CE R?G?T TO THE E? OF Y?TH. This letter, as the reader will perceive, was written the day after a dinner given by the M?rq?s of H?d?t. We miss'd you last night at the “hoary old sinner's,” Who gave us, as usual, the cream of good dinners; His soups scientific—his fishes quite prime— His pâtés superb—and his cutlets sublime! In short, 'twas the snug sort of dinner to stir a Stomachic orgasm in my Lord El?b?gh, Who set to, to be sure, with miraculous force, And exclaim'd, between mouthfuls, “a He-Cook, of course!— “While you live—(what's there under that cover? pray, look)— “While you live—(I'll just taste it)—ne'er keep a She-Cook. “'Tis a sound Salic Law—(a small bit of that toast)— “Which ordains that a female shall ne'er rule the roast; “For Cookery's a secret—(this turtle's uncommon)— “Like Masonry, never found out by a woman!” The dinner, you know, was in gay celebration Of my brilliant triumph and H?nt's condemnation; A compliment, too, to his Lordship the Judge For his Speech to the Jury—and zounds! who would grudge Turtle soup, though it came to five guineas a bowl, To reward such a loyal and complaisant soul? We were all in high gig—Roman Punch and Tokay Travell'd round, till our heads travell'd just the same way; And we car'd not for Juries or Libels—no—damme! nor Ev'n for the threats of last Sunday's Examiner! More good things were eaten than said—but Tom T?rrh?t In quoting Joe Miller, you know, has some merit; And, hearing the sturdy Justiciary Chief Say—sated with turtle—“ I'll now try the beef”— Tommy whisper'd him (giving his Lordship a sly hit) “I fear 'twill be hung-beef, my Lord, if you try it!” And C?md?n was there, who, that morning, had gone To fit his new Marquis's coronet on; And the dish set before him—oh dish well-devis'd!— Was, what old Mother Glasse calls, “a calf's head surpris'd!” The brains were near Sh?ry, and once had been fine, But, of late, they had lain so long soaking in wine, That, though we, from courtesy, still chose to call These brains very fine, they were no brains at all. When the dinner was over, we drank, every one In a bumper, “the venial delights of Crim. Con.;” At which H?df?t with warm reminiscences gloated, And E?b'r?h chuckled to hear himself quoted. Our next round of toasts was a fancy quite new, For we drank—and you'll own 'twas benevolent too— To those well-meaning husbands, cits, parsons, or peers, Whom we've, any time, honour'd by courting their dears: This museum of wittols was comical rather; Old H?df?t gave M?ss?y, and I gave your f?th?r. In short, not a soul till this morning would budge— We were all fun and frolic,—and even the J?e Laid aside, for the time, his juridical fashion, And through the whole night wasn't once in a passion! I write this in bed, while my whiskers are airing, And M?c Colonel M'Mahon. has a sly dose of jalap preparing For poor T?mmy T?rr?t at breakfast to quaff— As I feel I want something to give me a laugh, And there's nothing so good as old T?mmy, kept close To his Cornwall accounts, after taking a dose. LETTER IV. FROM THE RIGHT HON. P?TR?CK D?GEN?N TO THE RIGHT HON. SIR J?HN N?CH?L. Dublin. This letter, which contained some very heavy enclosures, seems to have been sent to London by a private hand, and then put into the Twopenny Post-Office, to save trouble. See the Appendix. Last week, dear N?ch?l, making merry At dinner with our Secretary, When all were drunk, or pretty near (The time for doing business here), Says he to me, “Sweet Bully Bottom! “These Papist dogs—hiccup—'od rot 'em!— “Deserve to be bespatter'd—hiccup— “With all the dirt ev'n you can pick up. “But, as the Pr?ce (here's to him—fill— “Hip, hip, hurra!)—is trying still “To humbug them with kind professions, “And, as you deal in strong expressions— “Rogue”—“traitor”—hiccup—and all that— “You must be muzzled, Doctor Pat!— “You must indeed—hiccup—that's flat.”— Yes—“muzzled” was the word, Sir John— These fools have clapp'd a muzzle on The boldest mouth that e'er ran o'er With slaver of the times of yore! In sending this sheet to the Press, however, I learn that the “muzzle” has been taken off, and the Right Hon. Doctor again let loose!— Was it for this that back I went As far as Lateran and Trent, To prove that they, who damn'd us then, Ought now, in turn, be damn'd again?— The silent victim still to sit Of Gr?tt?n's fire and C?nn?g's wit, To hear ev'n noisy M?th?w gabble on, Nor mention once the W?e of Babylon! Oh! 'tis too much—who now will be The Nightman of No-Popery? What Courtier, Saint, or even Bishop, Such learned filth will ever fish up? If there among our ranks be one To take my place, 'tis thou, Sir John; Thou, who, like me, art dubb'd Right Hon. Like me too, art a Lawyer Civil That wishes Papists at the devil. To whom then but to thee, my friend, Should Patrick A bad name for poetry; but D?gen?n is still worse.— As Prudentius says upon a very different subject— Torquetur Apollo Nomine percussus. his Port-folio send? Take it—'tis thine—his learn'd Port-folio, With all its theologic olio Of Bulls, half Irish and half Roman— Of Doctrines, now believ'd by no man— Of Councils, held for men's salvation, Yet always ending in damnation— (Which shows that, since the world's creation, Your Priests, whate'er their gentle shamming, Have always had a taste for damning,) And many more such pious scraps, To prove (what we've long prov'd, perhaps,) That, mad as Christians us'd to be About the Thirteenth Century, There still are Christians to be had In this, the Nineteenth, just as mad! Farewell—I send with this, dear N?ch?l, A rod or two I've had in pickle Wherewith to trim old Gr?tt?n's jacket.— The rest shall go by Monday's packet. P. D. Among the Enclosures in the foregoing Letter was the following “Unanswerable Argument against the Papists.“ We're told the ancient Roman nation Made use of spittle in lustration ? Lustralibus antè salivis Expiat.Pers. sat. 2.; (Vide Lactantium ap. Gallæum— I have taken the trouble of examining the Doctor's reference here, and find him, for once, correct. The following are the words of his indignant referee Gallæus—“Asserere non veremur sacrum baptismum a Papistis profanari, et sputi usum in peccatorum expiatione a Paganis non a Christianis manâsse.” i.e. you need not read but see 'em;) Now, Irish Papists, fact surprising, Make use of spittle in baptizing; Which proves them all, O'Finns, O'Fagans, Connors, and Tooles, all downright Pagans. This fact's enough;—let no one tell us To free such sad, salivous fellows.— No, no—the man, baptiz'd with spittle, Hath no truth in him—not a tittle! APPENDIX. Among the papers, enclosed in Dr. D?g?n?n's Letter, was found an Heroic Epistle in Latin verse, from Pope Joan to her Lover, of which, as it is rather a curious document, I shall venture to give some account. This female Pontiff was a native of England, (or, according to others, of Germany,) who, at an early age, disguised herself in male attire, and followed her lover, a young ecclesiastic, to Athens, where she studied with such effect, that upon her arrival at Rome, she was thought worthy of being raised to the Pontificate. This Epistle is addressed to her Lover (whom she had elevated to the dignity of Cardinal), soon after the fatal accouchement, by which her Fallibility was betrayed. She begins by reminding him tenderly of the time, when they were together at Athens—when, as she says, ? “by Ilissus' stream “We whispering walk'd along, and learn'd to speak “The tenderest feelings in the purest Greek;— “Ah, then how little did we think or hope, “Dearest of men, that I should e'er be Pope! Spanheim attributes the unanimity, with which Joan was elected, to that innate and irresistible charm, by which her sex, though latent, operated upon the instinct of the Cardinals— “Non vi aliquâ, sed concorditer, omnium in se converso desiderio, quæ sunt blandientis sexus artes, latentes in hâc quanquam!” “That I, the humble Joan, whose house-wife art “Seem'd just enough to keep thy house and heart, “(And those, alas, at sixes and at sevens,) “Should soon keep all the keys of all the heavens!” Still less (she continues to say) could they have foreseen, that such a catastrophe as had happened in Council would befall them—that she “Should thus surprise the Conclave's grave decorum, “And let a little Pope pop out before 'em— “Pope Innocent! alas, the only one “That name could e'er be justly fix'd upon.” She then very pathetically laments the downfall of her greatness, and enumerates the various treasures to which she is doomed to bid farewell for ever:— “But oh, more dear, more precious ten times over— “Farewell my Lord, my Cardinal, my Lover! “I made thee Cardinal—thou mad'st me—ah! “Thou mad'st the Papa of the world Mamma!” I have not time at present to translate any more of this Epistle; but I presume the argument which the Right Hon. Doctor and his friends mean to deduce from it, is (in their usual convincing strain) that Romanists must be unworthy of Emancipation now, because they had a Petticoat Pope in the Ninth Century. Nothing can be more logically clear, and I find that Horace had exactly the same views upon the subject. Romanus (eheu posteri negabitis!) Emancipatus Fœminæ Fert vallum! LETTER V. FROM THE COUNTESS DOWAGER OF C?RK TO LADY ?. My dear Lady ?! I've been just sending out About five hundred cards for a snug little Rout— (By the bye, you've seen Rokeby?—this moment got mine— The Mail-Coach Edition See Mr. Murray's Advertisement about the Mail-Coach copies of Rokeby.—prodigiously fine!) But I can't conceive how, in this very cold weather, I'm ever to bring my five hundred together; As, unless the thermometer's near boiling heat, One can never get half of one's hundreds to meet. (Apropos—you'd have laugh'd to see Townsend last night, Escort to their chairs, with his staff, so polite, The “three maiden Miseries,” all in a fright; Poor Townsend, like Mercury, filling two posts, Supervisor of thieves, and chief-usher of ghosts!) But, my dear Lady ?, can't you hit on some notion, At least for one night to set London in motion?— As to having the R?g?nt, that show is gone by— Besides, I've remark'd that (between you and I) The Marchesa and he, inconvenient in more ways, Have taken much lately to whispering in doorways; Which—consid'ring, you know, dear, the size of the two— Makes a block that one's company cannot get through; And a house such as mine is, with doorways so small, Has no room for such cumbersome love-work at all.— (Apropos, though, of love-work—you've heard it, I hope, That Napoleon's old mother's to marry the Pope,— What a comical pair!)—but, to stick to my Rout, 'Twill be hard if some novelty can't be struck out. Is there no Algerine, no Kamchatkan arriv'd? No Plenipo Pacha, three-tail'd and ten-wiv'd? No Russian, whose dissonant consonant name Almost rattles to fragments the trumpet of fame? I remember the time, three or four winters back, When—provided their wigs were but decently black— A few Patriot monsters, from Spain, were a sight That would people one's house for one, night after night. But—whether the Ministers paw'd them too much— (And you know how they spoil whatsoever they touch) Or, whether Lord G?rge (the young man about town) Has, by dint of bad poetry, written them down, One has certainly lost one's peninsular rage; And the only stray Patriot seen for an age Has been at such places (think, how the fit cools!) As old Mrs. V?gh?n's or Lord L?v?rp?l's. But, in short, my dear, names like Wintztschitstopschinzoudhoff Are the only things now make an ev'ning go smooth off: So, get me a Russian—till death I'm your debtor— If he brings the whole Alphabet, so much the better. And—Lord! if he would but, in character, sup Off his fish-oil and candles, he'd quite set me up! Au revoir, my sweet girl—I must leave you in haste— Little Gunter has brought me the Liqueurs to taste. POSTSCRIPT. By the bye, have you found any friend that can construe That Latin account, t'other day, of a Monster? Alluding, I suppose, to the Latin Advertisement of a Lusus Naturæ in the Newspapers lately. If we can't get a Russian, and that thing in Latin Be not too improper, I think I'll bring that in. LETTER VI. FROM ABDALLAH I have made many inquiries about this Persian gentleman, but cannot satisfactorily ascertain who he is. From his notions of Religious Liberty, however, I conclude that he is an importation of Ministers; and he has arrived just in time to assist the P?e and Mr. L?ck?e in their new Oriental Plan of Reform.—See the second of these Letters.— How Abdallah's epistle to Ispahan found its way into the Twopenny Post-Bag is more than I can pretend to account for., IN LONDON, TO MOHASSAN, IN ISPAHAN. Whilst thou, Mohassan, (happy thou!) Dost daily bend thy loyal brow Before our King—our Asia's treasure! Nutmeg of Comfort; Rose of Pleasure!— And bear'st as many kicks and bruises As the said Rose and Nutmeg chooses; Thy head still near the bowstring's borders, And but left on till further orders— Through London streets, with turban fair, And caftan, floating to the air, I saunter on, the admiration Of this short-coated population— This sew'd up race—this button'd nation— Who, while they boast their laws so free, Leave not one limb at liberty, But live, with all their lordly speeches, The slaves of buttons and tight breeches. Yet, though they thus their knee-pans fetter (They're Christians, and they know no better) “C'est un honnête homme,” said a Turkish governor of De Ruyter; “c'est grand dommage qu'il soit Chrétien.”. In some things they're a thinking nation; And, on Religious Toleration, I own I like their notions quite, They are so Persian and so right! You know our Sunnites Sunnites and Shiites are the two leading sects into which the Mahometan world is divided; and they have gone on cursing and persecuting each other, without any intermission, for about eleven hundred years. The Sunni is the established sect in Turkey, and the Shia in Persia; and the differences between them turn chiefly upon those important points, which our pious friend Abdallah, in the true spirit of Shiite Ascendency, reprobates in this Letter.,—hateful dogs! Whom every pious Shiite flogs Or longs to flog “Les Sunnites, qui étoient comme les Catholiques de Musulmanisme.” —D' Herbelot.—'tis true, they pray To God, but in an ill-bred way; With neither arms, nor legs, nor faces Stuck in their right, canonic places. “In contradistinction to the Sounis, who in their prayers cross their hands on the lower part of the breast, the Schiahs drop their arms in straight lines; and as the Sounis, at certain periods of the prayer, press their foreheads on the ground or carpet, the Schiahs,” &amp;c. &amp;c. —Forster's Voyage. 'Tis true, they worship Ali's name “Les Tures ne détestent pas Ali réciproquement; au contraire, ils le reconnoissent,” &amp;c. &amp;c. —Chardin. Their Heav'n and ours are just the same— (A Persian's Heav'n is eas'ly made, 'Tis but black eyes and lemonade.) Yet, though we've tried for centuries back— We can't persuade this stubborn pack, By bastinadoes, screws, or nippers, To wear th' establish'd pea-green slippers. “The Shiites wear green slippers, which the Sunnites consider as a great abomination.” —Mariti. Then, only think, the libertines! They wash their toes—they comb their chins For these points of difference, as well as for the Chapter of the Blanket, I must refer the reader (not having the book by me) to Picart's Account of the Mahometan Sects., With many more such deadly sins; And what's the worst, though last I rank it) Believe the Chapter of the Blanket! Yet, spite of tenets so flagitious, (Which must, at bottom, be seditious; Since no man living would refuse Green slippers, but from treasonous views; Nor wash his toes, but with intent To overturn the government,)— Such is our mild and tolerant way, We only curse them twice a day (According to a Form that's set), And, far from torturing, only let All orthodox believers beat 'em, And twitch their beards, where'er they meet 'em. As to the rest, they're free to do Whate'er their fancy prompts them to, Provided they make nothing of it Tow'rds rank or honour, power or profit; Which things, we nat'rally expect, Belong to us, the Establish'd sect, Who disbelieve (the Lord be thanked!) Th' aforesaid Chapter of the Blanket. The same mild views of Toleration Inspire, I find, this button'd nation, Whose Papists (full as giv'n to rogue, And only Sunnites with a brogue) Fare just as well, with all their fuss, As rascal Sunnites do with us. The tender Gazel I enclose Is for my love, my Syrian Rose— Take it when night begins to fall, And throw it o'er her mother's wall. GAZEL. Rememberest thou the hour we past,— That hour the happiest and the last? Oh! not so sweet the Siha thorn To summer bees, at break of morn, Not half so sweet, through dale and dell, To Camels' ears the tinkling bell, As is the soothing memory Of that one precious hour to me. How can we live, so far apart? Oh! why not rather, heart to heart, United live and die— Like those sweet birds, that fly together, With feather always touching feather, Link'd by a hook and eye! This will appear strange to an English reader, but it is literally translated from Abdallah's Persian, and the curious bird to which he alludes is the Juftak, of which I find the following account in Richardson:—“A sort of bird, that is said to have but one wing; on the opposite side to which the male has a hook and the female a ring, so that, when they fly, they are fastened together.” LETTER VII. FROM MESSRS. L?CK?GT?N AND CO. TO ?, ESQ. From motives of delicacy, and, indeed, of fellow-feeling, I suppress the name of the Author, whose rejected manuscript was inclosed in this letter.—See the Appendix. Per Post, Sir, we send your MS.—look'd it thro'— Very sorry—but can't undertake—'twouldn't do. Clever work, Sir!—would get up prodigiously well— Its only defect is—it never would sell. And though Statesmen may glory in being unbought, In an Author 'tis not so desirable thought. Hard times, Sir,—most books are too dear to be read— Though the gold of Good-sense and Wit's small-change are fled, Yet the paper we Publishers pass, in their stead, Rises higher each day, and ('tis frightful to think it) Not even such names as F?tzg?r?d's can sink it! However, Sir—if you're for trying again, And at somewhat that's vendible—we are your men. Since the Chevalier C?rr Sir John Carr, the author of “Tours in Ireland, Holland, Sweden,” &amp;c. &amp;c. took to marrying lately, The Trade is in want of a Traveller greatly— No job, Sir, more easy—your Country once plann'd, A month aboard ship and a fortnight on land Puts your Quarto of Travels, Sir, clean out of hand. An East-India pamphlet's a thing that would tell— And a lick at the Papists is sure to sell well. Or—supposing you've nothing original in you— Write Parodies, Sir, and such fame it will win you, You'll get to the Blue-stocking Routs of Albinia! This alludes, I believe, to a curious correspondence, which is said to have passed lately between Alb?n?a, Countess of B?ck?gh?ms?e, and a certain ingenious Parodist. (Mind—not to her dinners—a second-hand Muse Mustn't think of aspiring to mess with the Blues.) Or—in case nothing else in this world you can do— The deuce is in't, Sir, if you cannot review! Should you feel any touch of poetical glow, We've a Scheme to suggest—Mr. Sc?tt, you must know, (Who, we're sorry to say it, now works for the Row Paternoster Row.,) Having quitted the Borders, to seek new renown, Is coming, by long Quarto stages, to Town; And beginning with Rokeby (the job's sure to pay) Means to do all the Gentlemen's Seats on the way. Now, the Scheme is (though none of our hackneys can beat him) To start a fresh Poet through Highgate to meet him; Who, by means of quick proofs—no revises—long coaches— May do a few Villas, before Sc?tt approaches. Indeed, if our Pegasus be not curst shabby, He'll reach, without found'ring, at least Woburn-Abbey. Such, Sir, is our plan—if you're up to the freak, 'Tis a match! and we'll put you in training next week. At present, no more—in reply to this Letter, a Line will oblige very much Yours, et cetera. Temple of the Muses. APPENDIX. The Manuscript, found enclosed in the Bookseller's Letter, turns out to be a Melo-Drama, in two Acts, entitled “The Book There was, in like manner, a mysterious Book, in the 16th Century, which employed all the anxious curiosity of the Learned of that time. Every one spoke of it; many wrote against it; though it does not appear that any body had ever seen it; and Grotius is of opinion that no such Book ever existed. It was entitled “Liber de tribus impostoribus.” (See Morhof. Cap. de Libris damnatis.)—Our more modern mystery of “the Book” resembles this in many particulars; and, if the number of Lawyers employed in drawing it up be stated correctly, a slight alteration of the title into “à tribus impostoribus” would produce a coincidence altogether very remarkable.,” of which the Theatres, of course, had had the refusal, before it was presented to Messrs. L?ck?ngt?n and Co. This rejected Drama, however, possesses considerable merit, and I shall take the liberty of laying a sketch of it before my Readers. The first Act opens in a very awful manner— Time, three o'clock in the morning—Scene, the Bourbon Chamber The same Chamber, doubtless, that was prepared for the reception of the Bourbons at the first Grand Fête, and which was ornamented (all “for the Deliverance of Europe”) with fleurs-de-lys. in C?rl?t?n House— Enter the P?e R?g?t solus—After a few broken sentences, he thus exclaims:— Away—Away— Thou haunt'st my fancy so, thou devilish Book, I meet thee—trace thee, wheresoe'er I look. I see thy damned ink in Eld?n's brows— I see thy foolscap on my H?rtf?d's Spouse— V?ns?tt?t's head recalls thy leathern case, And all thy blank-leaves stare from R?d?r's face! While, turning here (laying his hand on his heart), I find, ah wretched elf, Thy List of dire Errata in myself. (Walks the stage in considerable agitation.) Oh Roman Punch! oh potent Curacoa! Oh Mareschino! Mareschino oh! Delicious drams! why have you not the art To kill this gnawing Book-worm in my heart? He is here interrupted in his Soliloquy by perceiving on the ground some scribbled fragments of paper, which he instantly collects, and “by the light of two magnificent candelabras” discovers the following unconnected words, “Wife neglected”—“the Book”—“Wrong Measures”—“the Queen”— “Mr. Lambert”—“the R?g?t.” Ha! treason in my house!—Curst words, that wither My princely soul, (shaking the papers violently) what Demon brought you hither? “My Wife;”—“the Book” too!—stay—a nearer look— (holding the fragments closer to the Candelabras) Alas! too plain, B, double O, K, Book— Death and destruction! He here rings all the bells, and a whole legion of valets enter. A scene of cursing and swearing (very much in the German style) ensues, in the course of which messengers are despatched, in different directions, for the L?rd Ch?nc?ll?r, the D?e of C?b?l?d, &amp;c. &amp;c. The intermediate time is filled up by another Soliloquy, at the conclusion of which the aforesaid Personages rush on alarmed; the D?ke with his stays only half-laced, and the Ch?nc?ll?r with his wig thrown hastily over an old red night-cap, “to maintain the becoming splendour of his office.” “To enable the individual, who holds the office of Chancellor, to maintain it in becoming splendour.” (A loud laugh.) —Lord Castlereagh's Speech upon the Vice-Chancellor's Bill. The R?g?t produces the appalling fragments, upon which the Ch?nc?ll?r breaks out into exclamations of loyalty and tenderness, and relates the following portentous dream. 'Tis scarcely two hours since I had a fearful dream of thee, my P?e!— Methought I heard thee, midst a courtly crowd, Say from thy throne of gold, in mandate loud, “Worship my whiskers!”— (weeps) not a knee was there But bent and worshipp'd the Illustrious Pair, Which curl'd in conscious majesty! (pulls out his handkerchief) —while cries Of “Whiskers, whiskers!” shook the echoing skies.— Just in that glorious hour, methought, there came, With looks of injur'd pride, a Princely Dame, And a young maiden, clinging by her side, As if she fear'd some tyrant would divide Two hearts that nature and affection tied! The Matron came—within her right hand glow'd A radiant torch; while from her left a load Of Papers hung— (wipes his eyes) collected in her veil— The venal evidence, the slanderous tale, The wounding hint, the current lies that pass From Post to Courier, form'd the motley mass; Which, with disdain, before the Throne she throws, And lights the Pile beneath thy princely nose. (Weeps.) Heav'ns, how it blaz'd!—I'd ask no livelier fire, (With animation) To roast a Papist by, my gracious Sire!— But ah! the Evidence— (weeps again) I mourn'd to see— Cast, as it burn'd, a deadly light on thee: And Tales and Hints their random sparkles flung, And hiss'd and crackled, like an old maid's tongue; While Post and Courier, faithful to their fame, Made up in stink for what they lack'd in flame. When, lo, ye Gods! the fire ascending brisker, Now singes one, now lights the other whisker. Ah! where was then the Sylphid, that unfurls Her fairy standard in defence of curls? Throne, Whiskers, Wig soon vanish'd into smoke, The watchman cried “Past One,” and—I awoke. Here his Lordship weeps more profusely than ever, and the R?g?t (who has been very much agitated during the recital of the Dream) by a movement as characteristic as that of Charles XII. when he was shot, claps his hands to his whiskers to feel if all be really safe. A Privy Council is held—all the Servants, &amp;c. are examined, and it appears that a Tailor, who had come to measure the R?g?t for a Dress (which takes three whole pages of the best superfine clinquant in describing) was the only person who had been in the Bourbon Chamber during the day. It is, accordingly, determined to seize the Tailor, and the Council breaks up with a unanimous resolution to be vigorous. The commencement of the Second Act turns chiefly upon the Trial and Imprisonment of two Brothers Mr. Leigh Hunt and his brother.—but as this forms the under plot of the Drama, I shall content myself with extracting from it the following speech, which is addressed to the two Brothers, as they “exeunt severally” to Prison:— Go to your prisons—though the air of Spring No mountain coolness to your cheeks shall bring; Though Summer flowers shall pass unseen away, And all your portion of the glorious day May be some solitary beam that falls, At morn or eve, upon your dreary walls— Some beam that enters, trembling as if aw'd, To tell how gay the young world laughs abroad! Yet go—for thoughts as blessed as the air Of Spring or Summer flowers await you there; Thoughts, such as He, who feasts his courtly crew In rich conservatories, never knew; Pure self-esteem—the smiles that light within— The Zeal, whose circling charities begin With the few lov'd-ones Heaven has plac'd it near, And spread, till all Mankind are in its sphere; The Pride, that suffers without vaunt or plea, And the fresh Spirit, that can warble free, Through prison-bars, its hymn to Liberty! The Scene next changes to a Tailor's Work-shop, and a fancifully-arranged group of these Artists is discovered upon the Shop-board—Their task evidently of a royal nature, from the profusion of gold-lace, frogs, &amp;c. that lie about—They all rise and come forward, while one of them sings the following Stanzas to the tune of “Derry Down.” My brave brother Tailors, come, straighten your knees, For a moment, like gentlemen, stand up at ease, While I sing of our P?e (and a fig for his railers) The Shop-board's delight! the Mæcenas of Tailors! Derry down, down, down derry down. Some monarchs take roundabout ways into note, While His short cut to fame is—the cut of his coat; Philip's Son thought the World was too small for his Soul, But our R?g?t's finds room in a lac'd button-hole. Derry down, &amp;c. Look through all Europe's Kings—those, at least, who go loose— Not a King of them all's such a friend to the Goose. So, God keep him increasing in size and renown, Still the fattest and best fitted P?e about town! Derry down, &amp;c. During the “Derry down” of this last verse, a messenger from the S?c?t?y of S?e's Office rushes on, and the singer (who, luckily for the effect of the scene, is the very Tailor suspected of the mysterious fragments) is interrupted in the midst of his laudatory exertions, and hurried away, to the no small surprise and consternation of his comrades. The Plot now hastens rapidly in its developement—the management of the Tailor's examination is highly skilful, and the alarm, which he is made to betray, is natural without being ludicrous. The explanation, too, which he finally gives is not more simple than satisfactory. It appears that the said fragments formed part of a self-exculpatory note, which he had intended to send to Colonel M'M?n upon subjects purely professional, and the corresponding bits (which still lie luckily in his pocket) being produced, and skilfully laid beside the others, the following billet-doux is the satisfactory result of their juxta-position. Honour'd Colonel—my Wife, who's the Queen of all slatterns, Neglected to put up the Book of new Patterns. She sent the wrong Measures too—shamefully wrong— They're the same us'd for poor Mr. Lambert, when young; But, bless you! they wouldn't go half round the R?g?t— So, hope you'll excuse yours till death, most obedient. This fully explains the whole mystery—the R?g?t resumes his wonted smiles, and the Drama terminates as usual, to the satisfaction of all parties. LETTER VIII. FROM COLONEL TH?M?S TO ? SK?FF?NGT?N, ESQ. Come to our Fête This Letter enclosed a Card for the Grand Fête on the 5th of February., and bring with thee Thy newest, best embroidery. Come to our Fête, and show again That pea-green coat, thou pink of men, Which charm'd all eyes, that last survey'd it; When Br?mm?l's self inquir'd “who made it?”— When Cits came wond'ring, from the East, And thought thee Poet Pye at least! Oh! come, (if haply 'tis thy week For looking pale,) with paly cheek; Though more we love thy roseate days, When the rich rouge-pot pours its blaze Full o'er thy face, and, amply spread, Tips ev'n thy whisker-tops with red— Like the last tints of dying Day That o'er some darkling grove delay. Bring thy best lace, thou gay Philander, (That lace, like H?rry Al?x?nd?r, Too precious to be wash'd,)—thy rings, Thy seals—in short, thy prettiest things! Put all thy wardrobe's glories on, And yield in frogs and fringe, to none But the great R?g?t's self alone; Who—by particular desire— For that night only, means to hire A dress from Romeo C?tes, Esquire. An amateur actor of much risible renown. Hail, first of Actors! Quem tu, Melpomene, semel Nascentem placido lumine, videris, &amp;c. Horat. The Man, upon whom thou hast deign'd to look funny, Oh Tragedy's Muse! at the hour of his birth— Let them say what they will, that's the Man for my money, Give others thy tears, but let me have thy mirth! best of R?g?ts! Born for each other's fond allegiance! Both gay Lotharios—both good dressers— Of serious Farce both learn'd Professors— Both circled round, for use or show, With cock's combs, wheresoe'er they go! The crest of Mr. C?tes, the very amusing amateur tragedian here alluded to, was a cock; and most profusely were his liveries, harness, &amp;c., covered with this ornament. Thou know'st the time, thou man of lore! It takes to chalk a ball-room floor— Thou know'st the time, too, well-a-day! It takes to dance that chalk away. To those, who neither go to balls nor read the Morning Post, it may be necessary to mention, that the floors of Ball-rooms, in general, are chalked, for safety and for ornament, with various fanciful devices. The Ball-room opens—far and nigh Comets and suns beneath us lie; O'er snow-white moons and stars we walk, And the floor seems one sky of chalk! But soon shall fade that bright deceit, When many a maid, with busy feet That sparkle in the lustre's ray, O'er the white path shall bound and play Like Nymphs along the Milky Way:— With every step a star hath fled, And suns grow dim beneath their tread! So passeth life—(thus Sc?tt would write, And spinsters read him with delight,)— Hours are not feet, yet hours trip on, Time is not chalk, yet time's soon gone! Hearts are not flint, yet flints are rent, Hearts are not steel, yet steel is bent. After all, however, Mr. Sc?tt may well say to the Colonel, (and, indeed, to much better wags than the Colonel,) ???? ????????? ? ????????? But, hang this long digressive flight!— I meant to say, thou'lt see, that night, What falsehood rankles in their hearts, Who say the Pr?e neglects the arts— Neglects the arts?—no, Str?hl?g A foreign artist much patronized by the Prince Regent., no; Thy Cupids answer “'tis not so;” And every floor, that night, shall tell How quick thou daubest, and how well. Shine as thou may'st in French vermilion, Thou'rt best, beneath a French cotillion; And still com'st off, whate'er thy faults, With flying colours in a Waltz. Nor need'st thou mourn the transient date To thy best works assign'd by fate. While some chef-d'œuvres live to weary one, Thine boast a short life and a merry one; Their hour of glory past and gone With “Molly put the kettle on!” The name of a popular country-dance. But, bless my soul! I've scarce a leaf Of paper left—so, must be brief. This festive Fête, in fact, will be The former Fête's fac-simile “C?rl?t?n H?e will exhibit a complete fac-simile, in respect to interior ornament, to what it did at the last Fête. The same splendid draperies,” &amp;c. &amp;c. —Morning Post.; The same long Masquerade of Rooms, All trick'd up in such odd costumes, (These, P?rt?r Mr. Walsh Porter, to whose taste was left the furnishing of the rooms of Carlton House., are thy glorious works!) You'd swear Egyptians, Moors, and Turks, Bearing Good-Taste some deadly malice, Had clubb'd to raise a Pic-Nic Palace; And each to make the olio pleasant Had sent a State-Room as a present. The same fauteuils and girondoles— The same gold Asses The salt-cellars on the Pr?e's own table were in the form of an Ass with panniers., pretty souls! That, in this rich and classic dome, Appear so perfectly at home. The same bright river 'mong the dishes, But not—ah! not the same dear fishes— Late hours and claret kill'd the old ones— So 'stead of silver and of gold ones, (It being rather hard to raise Fish of that specie now-a-days) Some sprats have been by Y?rm?th's wish, Promoted into Silver Fish, And Gudgeons (so V?ns?tt?t told The R?g?t) are as good as Gold! So, prithee, come—our Fête will be But half a Fête if wanting thee. SATIRICAL AND HUMOROUS POEMS. ??????????? ???????. THE INSURRECTION OF THE PAPERS. A DREAM. “It would be impossible for his Royal Highness to disengage his person from the accumulating pile of papers that encompassed it.” —Lord Castlereagh's Speech upon Colonel M'Mahon's Appointment, April 14. 1812. Last night I toss'd and turn'd in bed, But could not sleep—at length I said, “I'll think of Viscount C?stl?r?gh, “And of his speeches—that's the way.” And so it was, for instantly I slept as sound as sound could be. And then I dreamt—so dread a dream! Fuseli has no such theme; Lewis never wrote or borrow'd Any horror, half so horrid! Methought the Pr?e, in whisker'd state, Before me at his breakfast sate; On one side lay unread Petitions, On t'other, Hints from five Physicians; Here tradesmen's bills,—official papers, Notes from my Lady, drams for vapours— There plans of saddles, tea and toast, Death-warrants and the Morning Post. When lo! the Papers, one and all, As if at some magician's call, Began to flutter of themselves From desk and table, floor and shelves, And, cutting each some different capers, Advanc'd, oh jacobinic papers! As though they said, “Our sole design is “To suffocate his Royal Highness!” The Leader of this vile sedition Was a huge Catholic Petition, With grievances so full and heavy, It threaten'd worst of all the bevy. Then Common-Hall Addresses came In swaggering sheets, and took their aim Right at the R?g?t's well-dress'd head, As if determin'd to be read. Next Tradesmen's Bills began to fly, And Tradesmen's Bills, we know, mount high; Nay ev'n Death-warrants thought they'd best Be lively too, and join the rest. But, oh the basest of defections! His Letter about “predilections”— His own dear Letter, void of grace, Now flew up in its parent's face! Shock'd with this breach of filial duty, He just could murmur “et Tu Brute?” Then sunk, subdued upon the floor At Fox's bust, to rise no more! I wak'd—and pray'd, with lifted hand, “Oh! never may this Dream prove true; “Though paper overwhelms the land, “Let it not crush the Sovereign too!” PARODY OF A CELEBRATED LETTER. Letter from his Royal Highness the Prince Regent to the Duke of York, Feb. 13. 1812. At length, dearest Freddy, the moment is nigh, When, with P?rc?v?l's leave, I may throw my chains by; And, as time now is precious, the first thing I do, Is to sit down and write a wise letter to you. I meant before now to have sent you this Letter, But Y?rm?th and I thought perhaps 'twould be better To wait till the Irish affairs were decided— (That is, till both Houses had prosed and divided, With all due appearance of thought and digestion)— For, though H?rtf?rd House had long settled the question, I thought it but decent, between me and you, That the two other Houses should settle it too. I need not remind you how cursedly bad Our affairs were all looking, when Father went mad “I think it hardly necessary to call your recollection to the recent circumstances under which I assumed the authority delegated to me by Parliament.” —Prince's Letter.; A straight waistcoat on him and restrictions on me, A more limited Monarchy could not well be. I was call'd upon then, in that moment of puzzle, To choose my own Minister—just as they muzzle A playful young bear, and then mock his disaster, By bidding him choose out his own dancing-master. I thought the best way, as a dutiful son, Was to do as Old Royalty's self would have done. “My sense of duty to our Royal father solely decided that choice.” —Ibid. So I sent word to say, I would keep the whole batch in, The same chest of tools, without cleansing or patching; For tools of this kind, like Martinus's sconce The antique shield of Martinus Scriblerus, which, upon scouring, turned out to be only an old sconce., Would lose all their beauty, if purified once; And think—only think—if our Father should find, Upon graciously coming again to his mind “I waved any personal gratification, in order that his Majesty might resume, on his restoration to health, every power and prerogative,” &amp;c. —Prince's Letter., That improvement had spoil'd any favourite adviser— That R?se was grown honest, or W?stm?rel?nd wiser— That R?d?r was, ev'n by one twinkle, the brighter— Or L?v?rp?l's speeches but half a pound lighter— What a shock to his old royal heart it would be! No!—far were such dreams of improvement from me: And it pleased me to find, at the House, where, you know “And I have the satisfaction of knowing that such was the opinion of persons for whose judgment,” &amp;c. &amp;c. —Ibid., There's such good mutton cutlets, and strong curaçoa The letter-writer's favourite luncheon., That the Marchioness call'd me a duteous old boy, And my Y?rm?th's red whiskers grew redder for joy. You know, my dear Freddy, how oft, if I would, By the law of last Sessions I might have done good. I might have withheld these political noodles From knocking their heads against hot Yankee Doodles; I might have told Ireland I pitied her lot, Might have sooth'd her with hope—but you know I did not. And my wish is, in truth, that the best of old fellows Should not, on recovering, have cause to be jealous, But find that, while he has been laid on the shelf, We've been all of us nearly as mad as himself. You smile at my hopes—but the Doctors and I, Are the last that can think the K?ng ever will die. “I certainly am the last person in the kingdom to whom it can be permitted to despair of our royal father's recovery.” —Prince's Letter. A new era's arriv'd “A new era is now arrived, and I cannot but reflect with satisfaction,” &amp;c. —Ibid.—though you'd hardly believe it— And all things, of course, must be new to receive it. New villas, new fêtes (which ev'n Waithman attends)— New saddles, new helmets, and—why not new friends? I repeat it, “New Friends”—for I cannot describe The delight I am in with this P?rc?v?l tribe. Such capering!—Such vapouring!—Such rigour!—Such vigour! North, South, East, and West, they have cut such a figure, That soon they will bring the whole world round our ears, And leave us no friends—but Old Nick and Algiers. When I think of the glory they've beam'd on my chains, 'Tis enough quite to turn my illustrious brains. It is true we are bankrupts in commerce and riches, But think how we find our Allies in new breeches! We've lost the warm hearts of the Irish, 'tis granted, But then we've got Java, an island much wanted, To put the last lingering few who remain, Of the Walcheren warriors, out of their pain. Then how Wellington fights! and how squabbles his brother! For Papists the one, and with Papists the other; One crushing Napoleon by taking a City, While t'other lays waste a whole Cath'lic Committee. Oh deeds of renown!—shall I boggle or flinch, With such prospects before me? by Jove, not an inch. No—let England's affairs go to rack, if they will, We'll look after th' affairs of the Continent still; And, with nothing at home but starvation and riot, Find Lisbon in bread, and keep Sicily quiet. I am proud to declare I have no predilections “I have no predilections to indulge,—no resentments to gratify.” —Prince's Letter., My heart is a sieve, where some scatter'd affections Are just danc'd about for a moment or two, And the finer they are, the more sure to run through: Neither feel I resentments, nor wish there should come ill To mortal—except (now I think on't) Beau Br?mm?l, Who threaten'd last year, in a superfine passion, To cut me, and bring the old K?ng into fashion. This is all I can lay to my conscience at present; When such is my temper, so neutral, so pleasant, So royally free from all troublesome feelings, So little encumber'd by faith in my dealings (And that I'm consistent the world will allow, What I was at Newmarket the same I am now). When such are my merits (you know I hate cracking), I hope, like the Vender of Best Patent Blacking, “To meet with the gen'rous and kind approbation “Of a candid, enlighten'd, and liberal nation.” By the bye, ere I close this magnificent Letter, (No man, except Pole, could have writ you a better,) 'Twould please me if those, whom I've humbug'd so long “I cannot conclude without expressing the gratification I should feel if some of those persons with whom the early habits of my public life were formed would strengthen my hands, and constitute a part of my government.” —Prince's Letter. With the notion (good men!) that I knew right from wrong, Would a few of them join me—mind, only a few— To let too much light in on me never would do; But even Grey's brightness shan't make me afraid, While I've C?md?n and Eld?n to fly to for shade; Nor will Holland's clear intellect do us much harm, While there's W?stm?rel?nd near him to weaken the charm. As for Moira's high spirit, if aught can subdue it, Sure joining with H?rtf?rd and Y?rm?th will do it! Between R?d?r and Wh?rt?n let Sheridan sit, And the fogs will soon quench even Sheridan's wit: And against all the pure public feeling that glows Ev'n in Whitbread himself we've a Host in G?rge R?se! So, in short, if they wish to have Places, they may, And I'll thank you to tell all these matters to Grey “You are authorized to communicate these sentiments to Lord Grey, who, I have no doubt, will make them known to Lord Grenville.” —Prince's Letter., Who, I doubt not, will write (as there's no time to lose) By the twopenny post to tell Grenville the news; And now, dearest Fred (though I've no predilection), Believe me yours always with truest affection. P.S. A copy of this is to P?rc?l going “I shall send a copy of this letter immediately to Mr. Perceval.” —Prince's Letter.— Good Lord, how St. Stephen's will ring with his crowing! ANACREONTIC TO A PLUMASSIER. Fine and feathery artisan, Best of Plumists (if you can With your art so far presume) Make for me a Pr?ce's Plume— Feathers soft and feathers rare, Such as suits a Pr?ce to wear. First, thou downiest of men, Seek me out a fine Pea-hen; Such a Hen, so tall and grand, As by Juno's side might stand, If there were no cocks at hand. Seek her feathers, soft as down, Fit to shine on Pr?ce's crown; If thou canst not find them, stupid! Ask the way of Prior's Cupid. See Prior's poem, entitled “The Dove.” Ranging these in order due, Pluck me next an old Cuckoo; Emblem of the happy fates Of easy, kind, cornuted mates. Pluck him well—be sure you do— Who wouldn't be an old Cuckoo, Thus to have his plumage blest, Beaming on a R?y?l crest? Bravo, Plumist!—now what bird Shall we find for Plume the third? You must get a learned Owl, Bleakest of black-letter fowl— Bigot bird, that hates the light P?rc?v?l., Foe to all that's fair and bright. Seize his quills, (so form'd to pen Books In allusion to “the Book” which created such a sensation at that period., that shun the search of men; Books, that, far from every eye, In “swelter'd venom sleeping” lie,) Stick them in between the two, Proud Pea-hen and Old Cuckoo. Now you have the triple feather, Bind the kindred stems together With a silken tie, whose hue Once was brilliant Buff and Blue; Sullied now—alas, how much! Only fit for Y?rm?th's touch. There—enough—thy task is done; Present, worthy G?ge's Son; Now, beneath, in letters neat, Write “I serve,” and all's complete. EXTRACTS FROM THE DIARY OF A POLITICIAN. Wednesday. Through M?nch?st?r Square took a canter just now— Met the old yellow chariot The incog. vehicle of the Pr?ce., and made a low bow. This I did, of course, thinking 'twas loyal and civil, But got such a look—oh 'twas black as the devil! How unlucky!—incog. he was trav'lling about, And I like a noodle, must go find him out. Mem. —when next by the old yellow chariot I ride, To remember there is nothing princely inside. Thursday. At Levee to day made another sad blunder— What can be come over me lately, I wonder? The Pr?ce was as cheerful, as if, all his life, He had never been troubled with Friends or a Wife— “Fine weather,” says he—to which I, who must prate, Answered, “Yes, Sir, but changeable rather, of late.” He took it, I fear, for he look'd somewhat gruff, And handled his new pair of whiskers so rough, That before all the courtiers I fear'd they'd come off, And then, Lord, how Geramb Baron Geramb, the rival of his R. H. in whiskers. would triumphantly scoff! Mem. —to buy for son Dicky some unguent or lotion To nourish his whiskers—sure road to promotion! England is not the only country where merit of this kind is noticed and rewarded. “I remember,” says Tavernier, “to have seen one of the King of Persia's porters, whose mustaches were so long that he could tie them behind his neck, for which reason he had a double pension.” Saturday. Last night a Concert—vastly gay— Given by Lady C?stl?r?gh. My Lord loves music, and, we know, Has “two strings always to his bow.” A rhetorical figure used by Lord C?stl?r?gh, in one of his speeches. In choosing songs, the R?g?t nam'd “Had I a heart for falsehood fram'd.” While gentle H?rtf?d begg'd and pray'd For “Young I am, and sore afraid.” EPIGRAM. What news to-day?—“Oh! worse and worse— “Mac Colonel M?cm?h?n. is the Pr?ce's Privy Purse!”— The Pr?ce's Purse! no, no, you fool, You mean the Pr?ce's Ridicule. KING CRACK One of those antediluvian Princes, with whom Manetho and Whiston seem so intimately acquainted. If we had the Memoirs of Thoth, from which Manetho compiled his History, we should find, I dare say, that Crack was only a Regent, and that he, perhaps, succeeded Typhon, who (as Whiston says) was the last King of the Antediluvian Dynasty. AND HIS IDOLS. WRITTEN AFTER THE LATE NEGOTIATION FOR A NEW M?N?STRY. King Crack was the best of all possible Kings, (At least, so his Courtiers would swear to you gladly,) But Crack now and then would do het'rodox things, And, at last, took to worshipping Images sadly. Some broken-down Idols, that long had been plac'd In his father's old Cabinet, pleas'd him so much, That he knelt down and worshipp'd, though—such was his taste!— They were monstrous to look at, and rotten to touch. And these were the beautiful Gods of King Crack!— But his People, disdaining to worship such things, Cried aloud, one and all, “Come, your Godships must pack— “You'll not do for us, though you may do for Kings.” Then, trampling these images under their feet, They sent Crack a petition, beginning “Great Cæsar! “We're willing to worship; but only entreat “That you'll find us some decenter Godheads than these are.” “I'll try,” says King Crack—so they furnish'd him models Of better shap'd Gods, but he sent them all back; Some were chisell'd too fine, some had heads 'stead of noddles, In short, they were all much too godlike for Crack. So he took to his darling old Idols again, And, just mending their legs and new bronzing their faces, In open defiance of Gods and of man, Set the monsters up grinning once more in their places. WHAT'S MY THOUGHT LIKE? Quest. Why is a Pump like V?sc?nt C?stl?r?gh?Answ.

DIALOGUE BETWEEN A CATHOLIC DELEGATE AND HIS R?Y?L H?GHN?SS THE D?E OF C?B?L?D. EPIGRAM. Said his Highness to Ned Edward Byrne, the head of the Delegates of the Irish Catholics., with that grim face of his, “Why refuse us the Veto, dear Catholic Neddy?” “Because, Sir,” said Ned, looking full in his phiz, “You're forbidding enough, in all conscience, already!” WREATHS FOR THE MINISTERS. AN ANACREONTIC. Hither, Flora, Queen of Flowers! Haste thee from Old Brompton's bowers— Or, (if sweeter that abode) From the King's well-odour'd Road, Where each little nursery bud Breathes the dust and quaffs the mud. Hither come and gaily twine Brightest herbs and flowers of thine Into wreaths for those, who rule us, Those, who rule and (some say) fool us— Flora, sure, will love to please England's Household Deities! The ancients, in like manner, crowned their Lares, or Household Gods. See Juvenal, Sat. 9. v. 138.—Plutarch, too, tells us that Household Gods were then, as they are now, “much given to War and penal Statutes.”—??????????? ??? ????????? ????????.

LIB. II. FREELY TRANSLATED BY THE PR?CE R?G?T. This and the following are extracted from a Work, which may, some time or other, meet the eye of the Public—entitled “Odes of Horace, done into English by several Persons of Fashion.” Quid bellicosus Cantaber, et Scythes, Hirpine Quincti, cogitet, Hadria Divisus objecto, remittas Quærere. Come, Y?rm?th, my boy, never trouble your brains, About what your old crony, The Emperor Boney, Is doing or brewing on Muscovy's plains; Nec trepides in usum Poscentis ævi pauca.Nor tremble, my lad, at the state of our granaries: Should there come famine, Still plenty to cram in You always shall have, my dear Lord of the Stannaries. Brisk let us revel, while revel we may; Fugit retro Levis juventas et decor.For the gay bloom of fifty soon passes away, And then people get fat, And infirm, and—all that, Pellente lascivos amores Canitie.And a wig (I confess it) so clumsily sits, That it frightens the little Loves out of their wits; Neque uno Luna rubens nitet Vultu.Thy whiskers, too, Y?rm?t!—alas, even they, Though so rosy they burn, Too quickly must turn (What a heart-breaking change for thy whiskers!) to Grey. Quid æternis minorem Consiliis animum fatigas?Then why, my Lord Warden, oh! why should you fidget Your mind about matters you don't understand? Or why should you write yourself down for an idiot, Because “you,” forsooth, “have the pen in your hand!” Think, think how much better Than scribbling a letter, (Which both you and I Should avoid by the bye,) Cur non sub alta vel platano, vel hac Pinu jacentes sic temere.How much pleasanter 'tis to sit under the bust Of old Charley Charles Fox., my friend here, and drink like a new one; While Charley looks sulky and frowns at me, just As the Ghost in the Pantomime frowns at Don Juan.

HORACE, ODE XXII. LIB. I. FREELY TRANSLATED BY LORD ELD?N. Integer vitæ scelerisque purus. The man who keeps a conscience pure, (If not his own, at least his Prince's,) Through toil and danger walks secure, Looks big and black, and never winces. Non eget Mauri jaculis, neque arcu, Nec venenatis gravida sagittis, Fusce, pharetra.No want has he of sword or dagger, Cock'd hat or ringlets of Geramb; Though Peers may laugh, and Papists swagger, He doesn't care one single d?mn. Sive per Syrtes iter æstuosas, Sive facturus per inhospitalem Caucasum, vel quæ loca fabulosus Lambit Hydaspes.? The Noble Translator had, at first, laid the scene of these imagined dangers of his Man of Conscience among the Papists of Spain, and had translated the words “quæ loca fabulosus lambit Hydaspes” thus—“The fabling Spaniard licks the French;” but, recollecting that it is our interest just now to be respectful to Spanish Catholics (though there is certainly no earthly reason for our being even commonly civil to Irish ones), he altered the passage as it stands at present.Whether midst Irish chairmen going, Or through St. Giles's alleys dim, 'Mid drunken Sheelahs, blasting, blowing, No matter, 'tis all one to him. Namque me silvâ lupus in Sabinâ, Dum meam canto Lalagen, et ultra Terminum curis vagor expeditis, Fugit inermem. I cannot help calling the reader's attention to the peculiar ingenuity with which these lines are paraphrased. Not to mention the happy conversion of the Wolf into a Papist, (seeing that Romulus was suckled by a wolf, that Rome was founded by Romulus, and that the Pope has always reigned at Rome,) there is something particularly neat in supposing “ultra terminum” to mean vacation-time; and then the modest consciousness with which the Noble and Learned Translator has avoided touching upon the words “curis expeditis,” (or, as it has been otherwise read, “causis expeditis,”) and the felicitous idea of his being “inermis” when “without his wig,” are altogether the most delectable specimens of paraphrase in our language.For instance, I, one evening late, Upon a gay vacation sally, Singing the praise of Church and State, Got (God knows how) to Cranbourne Alley. When lo! an Irish Papist darted Across my path, gaunt, grim, and big— I did but frown, and off he started, Scar'd at me, even without my wig. Quale portentum neque militaris Daunias latis alit æsculetis, Nec Jubæ tellus generat leonum Arida nutrix.Yet a more fierce and raw-bon'd dog Goes not to Mass in Dublin City, Nor shakes his brogue o'er Allen's Bog, Nor spouts in Catholic Committee. Pone me pigris ubi nulla campis Arbor æstiva recreatur aura: Quod latus mundi, nebulæ, malusque Jupiter urget. I must here remark, that the said Dick M?rt?n being a very good fellow, it was not at all fair to make a “malus Jupiter” of him.Oh! place me midst O'Rourkes, O'Tooles, The ragged royal-blood of Tara; Or place me where Dick M?rt?n rules The houseless wilds of Connemara; Dulce ridentem Lalagen amabo, Dulce loquentem.Of Church and State I'll warble still Though ev'n Dick M?rt?n's self should grumble; Sweet Church and State, like Jack and Jill, There cannot be imagined a more happy illustration of the inseparability of Church and State, and their (what is called) “standing and falling together,” than this ancient apologue of Jack and Jill. Jack, of course, represents the State in this ingenious little Allegory. Jack fell down, And broke his Crown, And Jill came tumbling after.So lovingly upon a hill— Ah! ne'er like Jack and Jill to tumble! THE NEW COSTUME OF THE MINISTERS. ? Nova monstra creavit. Ovid. Metamorph. l. i. v. 437. Having sent off the troops of brave Major Camac, With a swinging horse-tail at each valorous back, And such helmets, God bless us! as never deck'd any Male creature before, except Signor Giovanni— “Let's see,” said the R?g?t (like Titus, perplex'd With the duties of empire,) “whom shall I dress next?” He looks in the glass—but perfection is there, Wig, whiskers, and chin-tufts all right to a hair That model of Princes, the Emperor Commodus, was particularly luxurious in the dressing and ornamenting of his hair. His conscience, however, would not suffer him to trust himself with a barber, and he used, accordingly, to burn off his beard.—“timore tonsoris,” says Lampridius. (Hist. August. Scriptor.) The dissolute Ælius Verus, too, was equally attentive to the decoration of his wig. (See Jul. Capitolin.)— Indeed, this was not the only princely trait in the character of Verus, as he had likewise a most hearty and dignified contempt for his Wife.—See his insulting answer to her in Spartianus.; Not a single ex-curl on his forehead he traces— For curls are like Ministers, strange as the case is, The falser they are, the more firm in their places. His coat he next views—but the coat who could doubt? For his Y?rm?th's own Frenchified hand cut it out; Every pucker and seam were made matters of state, And a Grand Household Council was held on each plait. Then whom shall he dress? shall he new-rig his brother, Great C?mb?rl?d's Duke, with some kickshaw or other? And kindly invent him more Christian-like shapes For his feather-bed neckcloths and pillory capes. Ah! no—here his ardour would meet with delays, For the Duke had been lately pack'd up in new Stays, So complete for the winter, he saw very plain 'Twould be devilish hard work to unpack him again. So, what's to be done?—there's the Ministers, bless' em!— As he made the puppets, why shouldn't he dress 'em? “An excellent thought!—call the tailors—be nimble— “Let Cum bring his spy-glass, and H?rtf?d her thimble; “While Y?rm?th shall give us, in spite of all quizzers, “The last Paris cut with his true Gallic scissors.” So saying, he calls C?stl?r?gh, and the rest Of his heaven-born statesmen, to come and be drest. While Y?rm?th, with snip-like and brisk expedition, Cuts up, all at once, a large Cath'lic Petition In long tailors' measures, (the P?e crying “Well-done!”) And first puts in hand my Lord Chancellor Eld?n. CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN A LADY AND GENTLEMAN, UPON THE ADVANTAGE OF (WHAT IS CALLED) “HAVING LAW In allusion to Lord Ell?nb?gh. ON ONE'S SIDE.” The Gentleman's Proposal. “Legge aurea, S'ei piace, ei lice.” Come, fly to these arms, nor let beauties so bloomy To one frigid owner be tied; Your prudes may revile, and your old ones look gloomy, But, dearest, we've Law on our side. Oh! think the delight of two lovers congenial, Whom no dull decorums divide; Their error how sweet, and their raptures how venial, When once they've got Law on their side. 'Tis a thing, that in every King's reign has been done, too: Then why should it now be decried? If the Father has done it, why shouldn't the Son, too? For so argues Law on our side. And, ev'n should our sweet violation of duty By cold-blooded jurors be tried, They can but bring it in “a misfortune,” my beauty, As long as we've Law on our side. The Lady's Answer. Hold, hold, my good Sir, go a little more slowly; For, grant me so faithless a bride, Such sinners as we, are a little too lowly, To hope to have Law on our side. Had you been a great Prince, to whose star shining o'er 'em The People should look for their guide, Then your Highness (and welcome!) might kick down decorum— You'd always have Law on your side. Were you ev'n an old Marquis, in mischief grown hoary, Whose heart, though it long ago died To the pleasures of vice, is alive to its glory— You still would have Law on your side. But for you, Sir, Crim. Con. is a path full of troubles; By my advice therefore abide, And leave the pursuit to those Princes and Nobles Who have such a Law on their side. OCCASIONAL ADDRESS FOR THE OPENING OF THE NEW THEATRE OF ST. ST?PH?N, INTENDED TO HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY THE PROPRIETOR IN FULL COSTUME, ON THE 24TH OF NOVEMBER, 1812. This day a New House, for your edification, We open, most thinking and right-headed nation! Excuse the materials—though rotten and bad, They're the best that for money just now could be had; And, if echo the charm of such houses should be, You will find it shall echo my speech to a T. As for actors, we've got the old Company yet, The same motley, odd, tragi-comical set; And consid'ring they all were but clerks t'other day, It is truly surprising how well they can play. Our Manager Lord C?stl?r?gh., (he, who in Ulster was nurst, And sung Erin go Brah for the galleries first, But, on finding Pitt-interest a much better thing, Chang'd his note of a sudden, to God save the King,) Still wise as he's blooming, and fat as he's clever, Himself and his speeches as lengthy as ever, Here offers you still the full use of his breath, Your devoted and long-winded proser till death. You remember last season, when things went perverse on, We had to engage (as a block to rehearse on) One Mr. V?ns?tt?t, a good sort of person, Who's also employ'd for this season to play, In “Raising the Wind,” and “the Devil to Pay.” He had recently been appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer. We expect too—at least we've been plotting and planning— To get that great actor from Liverpool, C?nn?g; And, as at the Circus there's nothing attracts Like a good single combat brought in 'twixt the acts, If the Manager should, with the help of Sir P?ph?m, Get up new diversions, and C?nn?g should stop 'em, Who knows but we'll have to announce in the papers, “Grand fight—second time—with additional capers.” Be your taste for the ludicrous, humdrum, or sad, There is plenty of each in this House to be had. Where our Manager ruleth, there weeping will be, For a dead hand at tragedy always was he; And there never was dealer in dagger and cup, Who so smilingly got all his tragedies up. His powers poor Ireland will never forget, And the widows of Walcheren weep o'er them yet. So much for the actors;—for secret machinery, Traps, and deceptions, and shifting of scenery, Y?rm?th and Cum are the best we can find, To transact all that trickery business behind. The former's employ'd too to teach us French jigs, Keep the whiskers in curl, and look after the wigs. In taking my leave now, I've only to say, A few Seats in the House, not as yet sold away, May be had of the Manager, Pat C?stl?r?gh. THE SALE OF THE TOOLS. Instrumenta regni. —Tacitus. Here's a choice set of Tools for you, Ge'mmen and Ladies, They'll fit you quite handy, whatever your trade is; (Except it be Cabinet-making;—no doubt, In that delicate service they're rather worn out; Though their owner, bright youth! if he'd had his own will, Would have bungled away with them joyously still.) You can see they've been pretty well hack'd—and alack! What tool is there job after job will not hack? Their edge is but dullish, it must be confess'd, And their temper, like E?nb'r?h's, none of the best; But you'll find them good hard-working Tools, upon trying, Wer't but for their brass, they are well worth the buying; They're famous for making blinds, sliders, and screens, And are, some of them, excellent turning machines. The first Tool I'll put up (they call it a Chancellor) Heavy concern to both purchaser and seller. Though made of pig iron, yet worthy of note 'tis, 'Tis ready to melt at a half minute's notice. An allusion to Lord Eld?n's lachrymose tendencies. Who bids? Gentle buyer! 'twill turn as thou shapest; 'Twill make a good thumb-screw to torture a Papist; Or else a cramp-iron, to stick in the wall Of some church that old women are fearful will fall; Or better, perhaps, (for I'm guessing at random,) A heavy drag-chain for some Lawyer's old Tandem. Will nobody bid? It is cheap, I am sure, Sir— Once, twice,—going, going,—thrice, gone!—it is yours, Sir. To pay ready money you sha'n't be distrest, As a bill at long date suits the Chancellor best. Come, where's the next Tool?—Oh! 'tis here in a trice— This implement, Ge'mmen, at first was a Vice; (A tenacious and close sort of tool, that will let Nothing out of its grasp it once happens to get;) But it since has received a new coating of Tin, Bright enough for a Prince to behold himself in. Come, what shall we say for it? briskly! bid on, We'll the sooner get rid of it—going—quite gone. God be with it, such tools, if not quickly knock'd down, Might at last cost their owner—how much? why, a Crown! The next Tool I'll set up has hardly had handsel or Trial as yet, and is also a Chancellor— Such dull things as these should be sold by the gross; Yet, dull as it is, 'twill be found to shave close, And like other close shavers, some courage to gather, This blade first began by a flourish on leather. “Of the taxes proposed by Mr. Vansittart, that principally opposed in Parliament was the additional duty on leather.” Ann. Register. You shall have it for nothing—then, marvel with me At the terrible tinkering work there must be, Where a Tool such as this is (I'll leave you to judge it) Is placed by ill luck at the top of the Budget! LITTLE MAN AND LITTLE SOUL. A BALLAD. To the tune of “There was a little man, and he woo'd a little maid.” DEDICATED TO THE RT. HON. CH?RL?S ABB?T. Arcades ambo Et cant-are pares. 1813. There was a little Man, and he had a little Soul, And he said, “Little Soul, let us try, try, try, “Whether it's within our reach “To make up a little Speech, “Just between little you and little I, I, I, “Just between little you and little I!”— Then said his little Soul, Peeping from her little hole, “I protest, little Man, you are stout, stout, stout, “But, if it's not uncivil, “Pray tell me what the devil “Must our little, little speech be about, bout, bout, “Must our little, little speech be about?” The little Man look'd big, With th' assistance of his wig, And he call'd his little Soul to order, order, order, Till she fear'd he'd make her jog in To gaol, like Thomas Croggan, (As she wasn't Duke or Earl) to reward her, ward her, ward her, As she wasn't Duke or Earl, to reward her. The little Man then spoke, “Little soul, it is no joke, “For as sure as J?cky F?ll?r loves a sup, sup, sup, “I will tell the Prince and People “What I think of Church and Steeple, “And my little patent plan to prop them up, up, up, “And my little patent plan to prop them up.” Away then, cheek by jowl, Little Man and little Soul Went and spoke their little speech to a tittle, tittle, tittle, And the world all declare That this priggish little pair Never yet in all their lives look'd so little, little, little, Never yet in all their lives look'd so little! REINFORCEMENTS FOR LORD WELLINGTON. Suosque tibi commendat Troja Penates Hos cape fatorum comites. Virgil. 1813. As recruits in these times are not easily got, And the Marshal must have them—pray, why should we not, As the last and, I grant it, the worst of our loans to him, Ship off the Ministry, body and bones to him? There's not in all England, I'd venture to swear, Any men we could half so conveniently spare; And, though they've been helping the French for years past, We may thus make them useful to England at last. C?stl?r?gh in our sieges might save some disgraces, Being us'd to the taking and keeping of places; And Volunteer C?nn?g, still ready for joining, Might show off his talent for sly undermining. Could the Household but spare us its glory and pride, Old H?df?t at horn-works again might be tried, And the Ch?f J?st?e make a bold charge at his side: While V?ns?tt?t could victual the troops upon tick, And the Doctor look after the baggage and sick. Nay, I do not see why the great R?g?t himself Should, in times such as these, stay at home on the shelf: Though through narrow defiles he's not fitted to pass, Yet who could resist, if he bore down en masse? And though oft, of an evening, perhaps he might prove, Like our Spanish confed'rates, “unable to move The character given to the Spanish soldier, in Sir John Murray's memorable despatch.,” Yet there's one thing in war of advantage unbounded, Which is, that he could not with ease be surrounded. In my next I shall sing of their arms and equipment; At present no more, but—good luck to the shipment! HORACE, ODE I. LIB. III. A FRAGMENT. Odi profanum vulgus et arceo: Favete linguis: carmina non prius Audita Musarum sacerdos Virginibus puerisque canto. Regum timendorum in proprios greges, Reges in ipsos imperium est Jovis. 1813. I hate thee, oh, Mob, as my Lady hates delf; To Sir Francis I'll give up thy claps and thy hisses, Leave old Magna Charta to shift for itself, And, like G?dw?n, write books for young masters and misses. Oh! it is not high rank that can make the heart merry, Even monarchs themselves are not free from mishap: Though the Lords of Westphalia must quake before Jerry, Poor Jerry himself has to quake before Nap. HORACE, ODE XXXVIII. LIB. I. A FRAGMENT TRANSLATED BY A TREASURY CLERK, WHILE WAITING DINNER FOR THE RIGHT HON. G?RGE R?SE. Persicos odi, puer, adparatus; Displicent nexæ philyra coronæ; Mitte sectari, Rosa quo locorum Sera moretur. Boy, tell the Cook that I hate all nick-nackeries, Fricassees, vol-au-vents, puffs, and gim-crackeries— Six by the Horse-Guards!—old Georgy is late— But come—lay the table cloth—zounds! do not wait, Nor stop to inquire, while the dinner is staying, At which of his places Old R?e is delaying! The literal closeness of the version here cannot but be admired. The Translator has added a long, erudite, and flowery note upon Roses, of which I can merely give a specimen at present. In the first place, he ransacks the Rosarium Politicum of the Persian poet Sadi, with the hope of finding some Political Roses, to match the gentleman in the text— but in vain: he then tells us that Cicero accused Verres of reposing upon a cushion “Melitensi rosâ fartum,” which, from the odd mixture of words, he supposes to be a kind of Irish Bed of Roses, like Lord Castlereagh's. The learned Clerk next favours us with some remarks upon a well-known punning epitaph on fair Rosamond, and expresses a most loyal hope, that, if “Rosa munda” mean “A Rose with clean hands” it may be found applicable to the Right Honourable Rose in question. He then dwells at some length upon the “Rosa aurea,” which, though descriptive, in one sense, of the old Treasury Statesman, yet, as being consecrated and worn by the Pope, must, of course, not be brought into the same atmosphere with him. Lastly, in reference to the words “old Rose,” he winds up with the pathetic lamentation of the Poet “consenuisse Rosas.” The whole note indeed shows a knowledge of Roses, that is quite edifying. IMPROMPTU UPON BEING OBLIGED TO LEAVE A PLEASANT PARTY, FROM THE WANT OF A PAIR OF BREECHES TO DRESS FOR DINNER IN. 1810. Between Adam and me the great difference is, Though a paradise each has been forc'd to resign, That he never wore breeches, till turn'd out of his, While, for want of my breeches, I'm banish'd from mine. LORD WELLINGTON AND THE MINISTERS. 1813. So gently in peace Alcibiades smil'd, While in battle he shone forth so terribly grand, That the emblem they grav'd on his seal, was a child With a thunderbolt plac'd in its innocent hand. Oh Wellington, long as such Ministers wield Your magnificent arm, the same emblem will do; For while they're in the Council and you in the Field, We've the babies in them, and the thunder in you! IRISH MELODIES. DEDICATION. TO THE MARCHIONESS DOWAGER OF DONEGAL. GO WHERE GLORY WAITS THEE. Go where glory waits thee, But while fame elates thee, Oh! still remember me. When the praise thou meetest To thine ear is sweetest, Oh! then remember me. Other arms may press thee, Dearer friends caress thee, All the joys that bless thee, Sweeter far may be; But when friends are nearest, And when joys are dearest, Oh! then remember me! When, at eve, thou rovest By the star thou lovest, Oh! then remember me. Think, when home returning, Bright we've seen it burning, Oh! thus remember me. Oft as summer closes, When thine eye reposes On its ling'ring roses, Once so lov'd by thee, Think of her who wove them, Her who made thee love them, Oh! then remember me. When, around thee dying, Autumn leaves are lying, Oh! then remember me. And, at night, when gazing On the gay hearth blazing, Oh! still remember me. Then should music, stealing All the soul of feeling, To thy heart appealing, Draw one tear from thee; Then let memory bring thee Strains I us'd to sing thee,— Oh! then remember me. REMEMBER THE GLORIES OF BRIEN THE BRAVE. Brien Boromhe, the great monarch of Ireland, who was killed at the battle of Clontarf, in the beginning of the 11th century, after having defeated the Danes in twenty-five engagements. WAR SONG. Remember the glories of Brien the brave, Tho' the days of the hero are o'er; Tho' lost to Mononia Munster. and cold in the grave, He returns to Kinkora The palace of Brien. no more. That star of the field, which so often hath pour'd Its beam on the battle, is set; But enough of its glory remains on each sword, To light us to victory yet. Mononia! when Nature embellish'd the tint Of thy fields, and thy mountains so fair, Did she ever intend that a tyrant should print The footstep of slavery there? No! Freedom, whose smile we shall never resign, Go, tell our invaders, the Danes, That 'tis sweeter to bleed for an age at thy shrine, Than to sleep but a moment in chains. Forget not our wounded companions, who stood This alludes to an interesting circumstance related of the Dalgais, the favourite troops of Brien, when they were interrupted in their return from the battle of Clontarf, by Fitzpatrick, prince of Ossory. The wounded men entreated that they might be allowed to fight with the rest.—Let stakes (they said) be stuck in the ground, and suffer each of us, tied to and supported by one of these stakes, to be placed in his rank by the side of a sound man.” “Between seven and eight hundred wounded men (adds O'Halloran) pale, emaciated, and supported in this manner, appeared mixed with the foremost of the troops;—never was such another sight exhibited.”—History of Ireland, book xii. chap. i. In the day of distress by our side; While the moss of the valley grew red with their blood, They stirr'd not, but conquer'd and died. That sun which now blesses our arms with his light, Saw them fall upon Ossory's plain;— Oh! let him not blush, when he leaves us to-night, To find that they fell there in vain. ERIN! THE TEAR AND THE SMILE IN THINE EYES. Erin, the tear and the smile in thine eyes, Blend like the rainbow that hangs in thy skies! Shining through sorrow's stream, Saddening through pleasure's beam, Thy suns with doubtful gleam, Weep while they rise. Erin, thy silent tear never shall cease, Erin, thy languid smile ne'er shall increase, Till, like the rainbow's light, Thy various tints unite, And form in heaven's sight One arch of peace! OH! BREATHE NOT HIS NAME. Oh! breathe not his name, let it sleep in the shade, Where cold and unhonour'd his relics are laid: Sad, silent, and dark, be the tears that we shed, As the night-dew that falls on the grass o'er his head. But the night-dew that falls, though in silence it weeps, Shall brighten with verdure the grave where he sleeps; And the tear that we shed, though in secret it rolls, Shall long keep his memory green in our souls. WHEN HE, WHO ADORES THEE. When he, who adores thee, has left but the name Of his fault and his sorrows behind, Oh! say wilt thou weep, when they darken the fame Of a life that for thee was resign'd? Yes, weep, and however my foes may condemn, Thy tears shall efface their decree; For Heaven can witness, though guilty to them, I have been but too faithful to thee. With thee were the dreams of my earliest love; Every thought of my reason was thine; In my last humble prayer to the Spirit above, Thy name shall be mingled with mine. Oh! blest are the lovers and friends who shall live The days of thy glory to see; But the next dearest blessing that Heaven can give Is the pride of thus dying for thee. THE HARP THAT ONCE THROUGH TARA'S HALLS. The harp that once through Tara's halls The soul of music shed, Now hangs as mute on Tara's walls, As if that soul were fled.— So sleeps the pride of former days, So glory's thrill is o'er, And hearts, that once beat high for praise, Now feel that pulse no more. No more to chiefs and ladies bright The harp of Tara swells; The chord alone, that breaks at night, Its tale of ruin tells. Thus Freedom now so seldom wakes, The only throb she gives, Is when some heart indignant breaks, To show that still she lives. FLY NOT YET. Fly not yet, 'tis just the hour, When pleasure, like the midnight flower That scorns the eye of vulgar light, Begins to bloom for sons of night, And maids who love the moon. 'Twas but to bless these hours of shade That beauty and the moon were made; 'Tis then their soft attractions glowing Set the tides and goblets flowing. Oh! stay,—Oh! stay,— Joy so seldom weaves a chain Like this to-night, that oh, 'tis pain To break its links so soon. Fly not yet, the fount that play'd In times of old through Ammon's shade, Solis Fons, near the Temple of Ammon. Though icy cold by day it ran, Yet still, like souls of mirth, began To burn when night was near. And thus, should woman's heart and looks At noon be cold as winter brooks, Nor kindle till the night, returning, Brings their genial hour for burning. Oh! stay,—Oh! stay,— When did morning ever break, And find such beaming eyes awake As those that sparkle here? OH! THINK NOT MY SPIRITS ARE ALWAYS AS LIGHT. Oh! think not my spirits are always as light, And as free from a pang as they seem to you now; Nor expect that the heart-beaming smile of to-night Will return with to-morrow to brighten my brow. No:—life is a waste of wearisome hours, Which seldom the rose of enjoyment adorns; And the heart that is soonest awake to the flowers, Is always the first to be touch'd by the thorns. But send round the bowl, and be happy awhile— May we never meet worse, in our pilgrimage here, Than the tear that enjoyment may gild with a smile, And the smile that compassion can turn to a tear. The thread of our life would be dark, Heaven knows! If it were not with friendship and love intertwin'd; And I care not how soon I may sink to repose, When these blessings shall cease to be dear to my mind. But they who have lov'd the fondest, the purest, Too often have wept o'er the dream they believ'd; And the heart that has slumber'd in friendship securest, Is happy indeed if 'twas never deceiv'd. But send round the bowl; while a relic of truth Is in man or in woman, this prayer shall be mine,— That the sunshine of love may illumine our youth, And the moonlight of friendship console our decline. THO' THE LAST GLIMPSE OF ERIN WITH SORROW I SEE. Tho' the last glimpse of Erin with sorrow I see, Yet wherever thou art shall seem Erin to me; In exile thy bosom shall still be my home, And thine eyes make my climate wherever we roam. To the gloom of some desert or cold rocky shore, Where the eye of the stranger can haunt us no more, I will fly with my Coulin, and think the rough wind Less rude than the foes we leave frowning behind. And I'll gaze on thy gold hair as graceful it wreathes, And hang o'er thy soft harp, as wildly it breathes; Nor dread that the cold-hearted Saxon will tear One chord from that harp, or one lock from that hair. “In the twenty-eighth year of the reign of Henry VIII. an Act was made respecting the habits, and dress in general, of the Irish, whereby all persons were restrained from being shorn or shaven above the ears, or from wearing Glibbes, or Coulins (long locks), on their heads, or hair on their upper lip, called Crommeal. On this occasion a song was written by one of our bards, in which an Irish virgin is made to give the preference to her dear Coulin (or the youth with the flowing locks) to all strangers (by which the English were meant), or those who wore their habits. Of this song, the air alone has reached us, and is universally admired.”—Walker's Historical Memoirs of Irish Bards, p. 134. Mr. Walker informs us also, that, about the same period, there were some harsh measures taken against the Irish Minstrels. RICH AND RARE WERE THE GEMS SHE WORE. This ballad is founded upon the following anecdote:— “The people were inspired with such a spirit of honour, virtue, and religion, by the great example of Brien, and by his excellent administration, that, as a proof of it, we are informed that a young lady of great beauty, adorned with jewels and a costly dress, undertook a journey alone, from one end of the kingdom to the other, with a wand only in her hand, at the top of which was a ring of exceeding great value; and such an impression had the laws and government of this Monarch made on the minds of all the people, that no attempt was made upon her honour, nor was she robbed of her clothes or jewels.” —Warner's History of Ireland, vol. i. book x. Rich and rare were the gems she wore, And a bright gold ring on her wand she bore; But oh! her beauty was far beyond Her sparkling gems, or snow-white wand. “Lady! dost thou not fear to stray, “So lone and lovely through this bleak way? “Are Erin's sons so good or so cold, “As not to be tempted by woman or gold?” “Sir Knight! I feel not the least alarm, “No son of Erin will offer me harm:— “For though they love woman and golden store, “Sir Knight! they love honour and virtue more!” On she went, and her maiden smile In safety lighted her round the green isle; And blest for ever is she who relied Upon Erin's honour, and Erin's pride. AS A BEAM O'ER THE FACE OF THE WATERS MAY GLOW. As a beam o'er the face of the waters may glow While the tide runs in darkness and coldness below, So the cheek may be ting'd with a warm sunny smile, Though the cold heart to ruin runs darkly the while. One fatal remembrance, one sorrow that throws Its bleak shade alike o'er our joys and our woes, To which life nothing darker or brighter can bring For which joy has no balm and affliction no sting— Oh! this thought in the midst of enjoyment will stay, Like a dead, leafless branch in the summer's bright ray; The beams of the warm sun play round it in vain, It may smile in his light, but it blooms not again. THE MEETING OF THE WATERS. “The Meeting of the Waters” forms a part of that beautiful scenery which lies between Rathdrum and Arklow, in the county of Wicklow, and these lines were suggested by a visit to this romantic spot, in the summer of the year 1807. There is not in the wide world a valley so sweet As that vale in whose bosom the bright waters meet The rivers Avon and Avoca.; Oh! the last rays of feeling and life must depart, Ere the bloom of that valley shall fade from my heart. Yet it was not that nature had shed o'er the scene Her purest of crystal and brightest of green; 'Twas not her soft magic of streamlet or hill, Oh! no,—it was something more exquisite still. 'Twas that friends, the belov'd of my bosom, were near, Who made every dear scene of enchantment more dear, And who felt how the best charms of nature improve, When we see them reflected from looks that we love. Sweet vale of Avoca! how calm could I rest In thy bosom of shade, with the friends I love best, Where the storms that we feel in this cold world should cease, And our hearts, like thy waters, be mingled in peace. HOW DEAR TO ME THE HOUR. How dear to me the hour when daylight dies, And sunbeams melt along the silent sea, For then sweet dreams of other days arise, And memory breathes her vesper sigh to thee. And, as I watch the line of light, that plays Along the smooth wave tow'rd the burning west, I long to tread that golden path of rays, And think 'twould lead to some bright isle of rest. TAKE BACK THE VIRGIN PAGE. WRITTEN ON RETURNING A BLANK BOOK. Take back the virgin page, White and unwritten still; Some hand, more calm and sage, The leaf must fill. Thoughts come, as pure as light, Pure as even you require: But, oh! each word I write Love turns to fire. Yet let me keep the book: Oft shall my heart renew, When on its leaves I look, Dear thoughts of you. Like you, 'tis fair and bright; Like you, too bright and fair To let wild passion write One wrong wish there. Haply, when from those eyes Far, far away I roam, Should calmer thoughts arise Tow'rds you and home; Fancy may trace some line, Worthy those eyes to meet, Thoughts that not burn, but shine, Pure, calm, and sweet. And as, o'er ocean far, Seamen their records keep, Led by some hidden star Through the cold deep; So may the words I write Tell thro' what storms I stray— You still the unseen light, Guiding my way. THE LEGACY. When in death I shall calmly recline, O bear my heart to my mistress dear; Tell her it liv'd upon smiles and wine Of the brightest hue, while it linger'd here. Bid her not shed one tear of sorrow To sully a heart so brilliant and light; But balmy drops of the red grape borrow, To bathe the relic from morn till night. When the light of my song is o'er, Then take my harp to your ancient hall; Hang it up at that friendly door, Where weary travellers love to call. “In every house was one or two harps, free to all travellers, who were the more caressed, the more they excelled in music.” —O'Halloran. Then if some bard, who roams forsaken, Revive its soft note in passing along, Oh! let one thought of its master waken Your warmest smile for the child of song. Keep this cup, which is now o'erflowing, To grace your revel, when I'm at rest; Never, oh! never its balm bestowing On lips that beauty hath seldom blest. But when some warm devoted lover To her he adores shall bathe its brim, Then, then my spirit around shall hover, And hallow each drop that foams for him. HOW OFT HAS THE BENSHEE CRIED. How oft has the Benshee cried, How oft has death untied Bright links that Glory wove, Sweet bonds entwin'd by Love! Peace to each manly soul that sleepeth; Rest to each faithful eye that weepeth; Long may the fair and brave Sigh o'er the hero's grave. We're fall'n upon gloomy days! I have endeavoured here, without losing that Irish character, which it is my object to preserve throughout this work, to allude to the sad and ominous fatality, by which England has been deprived of so many great and good men, at a moment when she most requires all the aids of talent and integrity. Star after star decays, Every bright name, that shed Light o'er that land, is fled. Dark falls the tear of him who mourneth Lost joy, or hope that ne'er returneth; But brightly flows the tear, Wept o'er a hero's bier. Quench'd are our beacon lights— Thou, of the Hundred Fights! This designation, which has been before applied to Lord Nelson, is the title given to a celebrated Irish Hero, in a Poem by O'Guive, the bard of O'Niel, which is quoted in the “Philosophical Survey of the South of Ireland,” page 433. “Con, of the hundred Fights, sleep in thy grass—grown tomb, and upbraid not our defeats with thy victories.” Thou, on whose burning tongue Truth, peace, and freedom hung! Fox, “Romanorum ultimus.” Both mute,—but long as valour shineth, Or mercy's soul at war repineth, So long shall Erin's pride Tell how they liv'd and died. WE MAY ROAM THROUGH THIS WORLD. We may roam thro' this world, like a child at a feast, Who but sips of a sweet, and then flies to the rest; And, when pleasure begins to grow dull in the east, We may order our wings and be off to the west; But if hearts that feel, and eyes that smile, Are the dearest gifts that heaven supplies, We never need leave our own green isle, For sensitive hearts, and for sun-bright eyes. Then remember, wherever your goblet is crown'd, Thro' this world, whether eastward or westward you roam, When a cup to the smile of dear woman goes round, Oh! remember the smile which adorns her at home. In England, the garden of Beauty is kept By a dragon of prudery placed within call; But so oft this unamiable dragon has slept, That the gardens but carelessly watch'd after all. Oh! they want the wild sweet-briery fence, Which round the flowers of Erin dwells; Which warns the touch, while winning the sense, Nor charms us least when it most repels. Then remember, wherever your goblet is crown'd, Thro' this world, whether eastward or westward you roam, When a cup to the smile of dear woman goes round, Oh! remember the smile that adorns her at home. In France, when the heart of a woman sets sail, On the ocean of wedlock its fortune to try, Love seldom goes far in a vessel so frail, But just pilots her off, and then bids her good-bye. While the daughters of Erin keep the boy, Ever smiling beside his faithful oar, Through billows of woe, and beams of joy, The same as he look'd when he left the shore, Then remember, wherever your goblet is crown'd, Thro' this world, whether eastward or westward you roam, When a cup to the smile of dear woman goes round, Oh! remember the smile that adorns her at home. EVELEEN'S BOWER. Oh! weep for the hour, When to Eveleen's bower The Lord of the Valley with false vows came; The moon hid her light From the heavens that night, And wept behind her clouds o'er the maiden's shame. The clouds pass'd soon From the chaste cold moon, And heaven smil'd again with her vestal flame; But none will see the day, When the clouds shall pass away, Which that dark hour left upon Eveleen's fame. The white snow lay On the narrow path-way, When the Lord of the Valley crost over the moor; And many a deep print On the white snow's tint Show'd the track of his footstep to Eveleen's door. The next sun's ray Soon melted away Every trace on the path where the false Lord came; But there's a light above, Which alone can remove That stain upon the snow of fair Eveleen's fame. LET ERIN REMEMBER THE DAYS OF OLD. Let Erin remember the days of old, Ere her faithless sons betray'd her; When Malachi wore the collar of gold “This brought on an encounter between Malachi (the Monarch of Ireland in the tenth century) and the Danes, in which Malachi defeated two of their champions, whom he encountered successively, hand to hand, taking a collar of gold from the neck of one, and carrying off the sword of the other, as trophies of his victory.” —Warner's History of Ireland, vol. i. book ix., Which he won from her proud invader, When her kings, with standard of green unfurl'd, Led the Red-Branch Knights to danger “Military orders of knights were very early established in Ireland: long before the birth of Christ we find an hereditary order of Chivalry in Ulster, called Curaidhe na Craiobhe ruadh, or the Knights of the Red Branch, from their chief seat in Emania, adjoining to the palace of the Ulster kings, called Teagh na Craiobhe ruadh, or the Academy of the Red Branch; and contiguous to which was a large hospital, founded for the sick knights and soldiers, called Bronbhearg, or the House of the Sorrowful Soldier.” —O'Halloran's Introduction, &amp;c., part i. chap. 5.;— Ere the emerald gem of the western world Was set in the crown of a stranger. On Lough Neagh's bank as the fisherman strays, When the clear cold eve's declining, He sees the round towers of other days In the wave beneath him shining; Thus shall memory often, in dreams sublime, Catch a glimpse of the days that are over; Thus, sighing, look through the waves of time For the long-faded glories they cover. It was an old tradition, in the time of Giraldus, that Lough Neagh had been originally a fountain, by whose sudden overflowing the country was inundated, and a whole region, like the Atlantis of Plato, overwhelmed. He says that the fishermen, in clear weather, used to point out to strangers the tall ecclesiastical towers under the water. Piscatores aquæ illius turres ecclesiasticas, quæ more patriæ arctæ sunt et altæ, necnon et rotundæ, sub undis manifeste sereno tempore conspiciunt, et extraneis transeuntibus, reique causas admirantibus, frequenter ostendunt. —Topogr. Hib. dist. 2. c. 9. THE SONG OF FIONNUALA. To make this story intelligible in a song would require a much greater number of verses than any one is authorised to inflict upon an audience at once; the reader must therefore be content to learn, in a note, that Fionnuala, the daughter of Lir, was, by some supernatural power, transformed into a swan, and condemned to wander, for many hundred years, over certain lakes and rivers in Ireland, till the coming of Christianity, when the first sound of the mass-bell was to be the signal of her release.—I found this fanciful fiction among some manuscript translations from the Irish, which were begun under the direction of that enlightened friend of Ireland, the late Countess of Moira. Silent, oh Moyle, be the roar of thy water, Break not, ye breezes, your chain of repose, While, murmuring mournfully, Lir's lonely daughter Tells to the night-star her tale of woes. When shall the swan, her death-note singing, Sleep, with wings in darkness furl'd? When will heaven, its sweet bell ringing, Call my spirit from this stormy world? Sadly, oh Moyle, to thy winter-wave weeping, Fate bids me languish long ages away; Yet still in her darkness doth Erin lie sleeping, Still doth the pure light its dawning delay. When will that day-star, mildly springing, Warm our isle with peace and love? When will heaven, its sweet bell ringing, Call my spirit to the fields above? COME, SEND ROUND THE WINE. Come, send round the wine, and leave points of belief To simpleton sages, and reasoning fools; This moment's a flower too fair and brief, To be wither'd and stain'd by the dust of the schools. Your glass may be purple, and mine may be blue, But, while they are fill'd from the same bright bowl, The fool, who would quarrel for difference of hue, Deserves not the comfort they shed o'er the soul. Shall I ask the brave soldier, who fights by my side In the cause of mankind, if our creeds agree? Shall I give up the friend I have valued and tried, If he kneel not before the same altar with me? From the heretic girl of my soul should I fly, To seek somewhere else a more orthodox kiss? No, perish the hearts, and the laws that try Truth, valour, or love, by a standard like this! SUBLIME WAS THE WARNING. Sublime was the warning that Liberty spoke, And grand was the moment when Spaniards awoke Into life and revenge from the conqueror's chain. Oh, Liberty! let not this spirit have rest, Till it move, like a breeze, o'er the waves of the west— Give the light of your look to each sorrowing spot, Nor, oh, be the Shamrock of Erin forgot While you add to your garland the Olive of Spain! If the fame of our fathers, bequeath'd with their rights, Give to country its charm, and to home its delights, If deceit be a wound, and suspicion a stain, Then, ye men of Iberia, our cause is the same! And oh! may his tomb want a tear and a name, Who would ask for a nobler, a holier death, Than to turn his last sigh into victory's breath, For the Shamrock of Erin and Olive of Spain! Ye Blakes and O'Donnels, whose fathers resign'd The green hills of their youth, among strangers to find That repose which, at home, they had sigh'd for in vain, Join, join in our hope that the flame, which you light, May be felt yet in Erin, as calm, and as bright, And forgive even Albion while blushing she draws, Like a truant, her sword, in the long-slighted cause Of the Shamrock of Erin and Olive of Spain! God prosper the cause!—oh, it cannot but thrive, While the pulse of one patriot heart is alive, Its devotion to feel, and its rights to maintain; Then, how sainted by sorrow, its martyrs will die! The finger of Glory shall point where they lie; While, far from the footstep of coward or slave, The young spirit of Freedom shall shelter their grave Beneath Shamrocks of Erin and Olives of Spain! BELIEVE ME, IF ALL THOSE ENDEARING YOUNG CHARMS. Believe me, if all those endearing young charms, Which I gaze on so fondly to-day, Were to change by to-morrow, and fleet in my arms, Like fairy-gifts fading away, Thou wouldst still be ador'd, as this moment thou art, Let thy loveliness fade as it will, And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart Would entwine itself verdantly still. It is not while beauty and youth are thine own, And thy cheeks unprofan'd by a tear, That the fervour and faith of a soul can be known, To which time will but make thee more dear; No, the heart that has truly lov'd never forgets, But as truly loves on to the close, As the sun-flower turns on her god, when he sets, The same look which she turn'd when he rose. ERIN, OH ERIN. Like the bright lamp, that shone in Kildare's holy fane The inextinguishable fire of St. Bridget, at Kildare, which Giraldus mentions:—“Apud Kildariam occurrit Ignis Sanctæ Brigidæ, quem inextinguibilem vocant; non quod extingui non possit, sed quod tam solicite moniales et sanctæ mulieres ignem, suppetente materia, fovent et nutriunt, ut a tempore virginis per tot annorum curricula semper mansit inextinctus.” —Girald. Camb. de Mirabil. Hibern. dist. 2. c. 34., And burn'd thro' long ages of darkness and storm, Is the heart that sorrows have frown'd on in vain, Whose spirit outlives them, unfading and warm. Erin, oh Erin, thus bright thro' the tears Of a long night of bondage, thy spirit appears. The nations have fallen, and thou still art young, Thy sun is but rising, when others are set; And tho' slavery's cloud o'er thy morning hath hung The full noon of freedom shall beam round thee yet. Erin, oh Erin, tho' long in the shade, Thy star will shine out when the proudest shall fade. Unchill'd by the rain, and unwak'd by the wind, The lily lies sleeping thro' winter's cold hour, Till Spring's light touch her fetters unbind, And daylight and liberty bless the young flower. Mrs. H. Tighe, in her exquisite lines on the lily, has applied this image to a still more important object. Thus Erin, oh Erin, thy winter is past, And the hope that liv'd thro' it shall blossom at last. DRINK TO HER. Drink to her, who long Hath wak'd the poet's sigh, The girl, who gave to song What gold could never buy. Oh! woman's heart was made For minstrel hands alone; By other fingers play'd, It yields not half the tone. Then here's to her, who long Hath wak'd the poet's sigh, The girl who gave to song What gold could never buy. At Beauty's door of glass, When Wealth and Wit once stood, They ask'd her, “which might pass?” She answer'd, “he, who could.” With golden key Wealth thought To pass—but 'twould not do: While Wit a diamond brought, Which cut his bright way through. So here's to her, who long Hath wak'd the poet's sigh, The girl, who gave to song What gold could never buy. The love that seeks a home Where wealth or grandeur shines, Is like the gloomy gnome, That dwells in dark gold mines. But oh! the poet's love Can boast a brighter sphere; Its native home's above, Tho' woman keeps it here. Then drink to her, who long Hath wak'd the poet's sigh, The girl, who gave to song What gold could never buy. OH! BLAME NOT THE BARD. We may suppose this apology to have been uttered by one of those wandering bards, whom Spenser so severely, and, perhaps, truly, describes in his State of Ireland, and whose poems, he tells us, “were sprinkled with some pretty flowers of their natural device, which have good grace and comeliness unto them, the which it is great pity to see abused to the gracing of wickedness and vice, which, with good usage, would serve to adorn and beautify virtue.” Oh! blame not the bard, if he fly to the bowers, Where Pleasure lies, carelessly smiling at Fame; He was born for much more, and in happier hours His soul might have burn'd with a holier flame. The string, that now languishes loose o'er the lyre, Might have bent a proud bow to the warrior's dart It is conjectured by Wormius, that the name of Ireland is derived from Yr, the Runic for a bow, in the use of which weapon the Irish were once very expert. This derivation is certainly more creditable to us than the following: “So that Ireland, called the land of Ire, from the constant broils therein for 400 years, was now become the land of concord.” —Lloyd's State Worthies, art. The Lord Grandison.; And the lip, which now breathes but the song of desire, Might have pour'd the full tide of a patriot's heart. But alas for his country!—her pride is gone by, And that spirit is broken, which never would bend; O'er the ruin her children in secret must sigh, For 'tis treason to love her, and death to defend. Unpriz'd are her sons, till they've learned to betray; Undistinguish'd they live, if they shame not their sires; And the torch, that would light them thro' dignity's way, Must be caught from the pile, where their country expires. Then blame not the bard, if in pleasure's soft dream, He should try to forget, what he never can heal: Oh! give but a hope—let a vista but gleam Through the gloom of his country, and mark how he'll feel! That instant, his heart at her shrine would lay down Every passion it nurs'd, every bliss it ador'd; While the myrtle, now idly entwin'd with his crown, Like the wreath of Harmodius, should cover his sword. See the Hymn, attributed to Alcæus, ?? ?????? ????? ?? ????? ??????—“I will carry my sword, hidden in myrtles, like Harmodius, and Aristogiton,” &amp;c. But tho' glory be gone, and tho' hope fade away, Thy name, loved Erin, shall live in his songs; Not ev'n in the hour, when his heart is most gay, Will he lose the remembrance of thee and thy wrongs. The stranger shall hear thy lament on his plains; The sigh of thy harp shall be sent o'er the deep, Till thy masters themselves, as they rivet thy chains, Shall pause at the song of their captive, and weep! WHILE GAZING ON THE MOON'S LIGHT. While gazing on the moon's light, A moment from her smile I turn'd, To look at orbs, that, more bright, In lone and distant glory burn'd. But too far Each proud star, For me to feel its warming flame; Much more dear That mild sphere, Which near our planet smiling came “Of such celestial bodies as are visible, the sun excepted, the single moon, as despicable as it is in comparison to most of the others, is much more beneficial than they all put together.” —Whiston's Theory, &amp;c. In the Entretiens d'Ariste, among other ingenious emblems, we find a starry sky without a moon, with these words, Non mille, quod absens.; Thus, Mary, be but thou my own; While brighter eyes unheeded play, I'll love those moonlight looks alone, That bless my home and guide my way. The day had sunk in dim showers, But midnight now, with lustre meet, Illumin'd all the pale flowers, Like hope upon a mourner's cheek. I said (while The moon's smile Play'd o'er a stream, in dimpling bliss,) “The moon looks “On many brooks, “The brook can see no moon but this;” This image was suggested by the following thought, which occurs somewhere in Sir William Jones's works: “The moon looks upon many night-flowers, the night-flower sees but one moon.” And thus, I thought, our fortunes run, For many a lover looks to thee, While oh! I feel there is but one, One Mary in the world for me. ILL OMENS. When daylight was yet sleeping under the billow, And stars in the heavens still lingering shone, Young Kitty, all blushing, rose up from her pillow, The last time she e'er was to press it alone. For the youth whom she treasured her heart and her soul in, Had promised to link the last tie before noon; And when once the young heart of a maiden is stolen The maiden herself will steal after it soon. As she look'd in the glass, which a woman ne'er misses, Nor ever wants time for a sly glance or two, A butterfly An emblem of the soul., fresh from the night-flower's kisses, Flew over the mirror, and shaded her view. Enrag'd with the insect for hiding her graces, She brush'd him—he fell, alas; never to rise: “Ah! such,” said the girl, “is the pride of our faces, “For which the soul's innocence too often dies.” While she stole thro' the garden, where hearts-ease was growing, She cull'd some, and kiss'd off its night-fallen dew; And a rose, further on, look'd so tempting and glowing, That, spite of her haste, she must gather it too: But while o'er the roses too carelessly leaning, Her zone flew in two, and the hearts-ease was lost: “Ah! this means,” said the girl (and she sigh'd at its meaning), “That love is scarce worth the repose it will cost!” BEFORE THE BATTLE. By the hope within us springing, Herald of to-morrow's strife; By that sun, whose light is bringing Chains or freedom, death or life— Oh! remember life can be No charm for him, who lives not free! Like the day-star in the wave, Sinks a hero in his grave, Midst the dew-fall of a nation's tears. Happy is he o'er whose decline The smiles of home may soothing shine And light him down the steep of years:— But oh, how blest they sink to rest, Who close their eyes on victory's breast! O'er his watch-fire's fading embers Now the foeman's cheek turns white, When his heart that field remembers, Where we tamed his tyrant might. Never let him bind again A chain, like that we broke from then. Hark! the horn of combat calls— Ere the golden evening falls, May we pledge that horn in triumph round! “The Irish Corna was not entirely devoted to martial purposes. In the heroic ages, our ancestors quaffed Meadh out of them, as the Danish hunters do their beverage at this day.” —Walker. Many a heart that now beats high, In slumber cold at night shall lie, Nor waken even at victory's sound:— But oh, how blest that hero's sleep, O'er whom a wond'ring world shall weep! AFTER THE BATTLE. Night clos'd around the conqueror's way, And lightnings show'd the distant hill, Where those who lost that dreadful day, Stood few and faint, but fearless still. The soldier's hope, the patriot's zeal, For ever dimm'd, for ever crost— Oh! who shall say what heroes feel, When all but life and honour's lost? The last sad hour of freedom's dream, And valour's task, moved slowly by, While mute they watch'd, till morning's beam Should rise and give them light to die. There's yet a world, where souls are free, Where tyrants taint not nature's bliss;— If death that world's bright opening be, Oh! who would live a slave in this? 'TIS SWEET TO THINK. 'Tis sweet to think, that, where'er we rove, We are sure to find something blissful and dear, And that, when we're far from the lips we love, We've but to make love to the lips we are near. I believe it is Marmontel who says, “Quand on n'a pas ce que l'on aime, il faut aimer ce que l'on a.”—There are so many matter-of-fact people, who take such jeux d'esprit as this defence of inconstancy, to be the actual and genuine sentiments of him who writes them, that they compel one, in self-defence, to be as matter-of-fact as themselves, and to remind them, that Democritus was not the worse physiologist, for having playfully contended that snow was black; nor Erasmus, in any degree, the less wise, for having written an ingenious encomium of folly. The heart, like a tendril, accustom'd to cling, Let it grow where it will, cannot flourish alone, But will lean to the nearest, and loveliest thing, It can twine with itself, and make closely its own. Then oh! what pleasure, where'er we rove, To be sure to find something, still, that is dear, And to know, when far from the lips we love, We've but to make love to the lips we are near. 'Twere a shame, when flowers around us rise, To make light of the rest, if the rose isn't there; And the world's so rich in resplendent eyes, 'Twere a pity to limit one's love to a pair. Love's wing and the peacock's are nearly alike, They are both of them bright, but they're changeable too, And, wherever a new beam of beauty can strike, It will tincture Love's plume with a different hue. Then oh! what pleasure, where'er we rove, To be sure to find something, still, that is dear, And to know, when far from the lips we love, We've but to make love to the lips we are near. THE IRISH PEASANT TO HIS MISTRESS. Meaning, allegorically, the ancient Church of Ireland. Through grief and through danger thy smile hath cheer'd my way, Till hope seem'd to bud from each thorn that round me lay; The darker our fortune, the brighter our pure love burn'd, Till shame into glory, till fear into zeal was turn'd; Yes, slave as I was, in thy arms my spirit felt free, And bless'd even the sorrows that made me more dear to thee. Thy rival was honour'd, while thou wert wrong'd and scorn'd, Thy crown was of briers, while gold her brows adorn'd; She woo'd me to temples, while thou lay'st hid in caves, Her friends were all masters, while thine, alas! were slaves; Yet cold in the earth, at thy feet, I would rather be, Than wed what I lov'd not, or turn one thought from thee. They slander thee sorely, who say thy vows are frail— Hadst thou been a false one, thy cheek had look'd less pale. They say, too, so long thou hast worn those lingering chains, That deep in thy heart they have printed their servile stains— Oh! foul is the slander,—no chain could that soul subdue— Where shineth thy spirit, there liberty shineth too! “Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.” —St. Paul, 2 Corinthians, iii. 17. ON MUSIC. When thro' life unblest we rove, Losing all that made life dear, Should some notes we used to love, In days of boyhood, meet our ear, Oh! how welcome breathes the strain! Wakening thoughts that long have slept; Kindling former smiles again In faded eyes that long have wept. Like the gale, that sighs along Beds of oriental flowers, Is the grateful breath of song, That once was heard in happier hours; Fill'd with balm, the gale sighs on, Though the flowers have sunk in death; So, when pleasure's dream is gone, Its memory lives in Music's breath. Music, oh how faint, how weak, Language fades before thy spell! Why should Feeling ever speak, When thou canst breathe her soul so well? Friendship's balmy words may feign, Love's are ev'n more false than they; Oh! 'tis only music's strain Can sweetly soothe, and not betray. IT IS NOT THE TEAR AT THIS MOMENT SHED. These lines were occasioned by the loss of a very near and dear relative, who had died lately at Madeira. It is not the tear at this moment shed, When the cold turf has just been laid o'er him, That can tell how belov'd was the friend that's fled, Or how deep in our hearts we deplore him. 'Tis the tear, thro' many a long day wept, 'Tis life's whole path o'ershaded; 'Tis the one remembrance, fondly kept, When all lighter griefs have faded. Thus his memory, like some holy light, Kept alive in our hearts, will improve them, For worth shall look fairer, and truth more bright, When we think how he liv'd but to love them. And, as fresher flowers the sod perfume Where buried saints are lying, So our hearts shall borrow a sweet'ning bloom From the image he left there in dying! THE ORIGIN OF THE HARP. 'Tis believ'd that this Harp, which I wake now for thee, Was a Siren of old, who sung under the sea; And who often, at eve, thro' the bright waters rov'd, To meet, on the green shore, a youth whom she lov'd. But she lov'd him in vain, for he left her to weep, And in tears, all the night, her gold tresses to steep; Till heav'n look'd with pity on true-love so warm, And chang'd to this soft Harp the sea-maiden's form. Still her bosom rose fair—still her cheeks smil'd the same— While her sea-beauties gracefully form'd the light frame; And her hair, as, let loose, o'er her white arm it fell, Was chang'd to bright chords utt'ring melody's spell. Hence it came, that this soft Harp so long hath been known To mingle love's language with sorrow's sad tone; Till thou didst divide them, and teach the fond lay To speak love when I'm near thee, and grief when away. LOVE'S YOUNG DREAM. Oh! the days are gone, when Beauty bright My heart's chain wove; When my dream of life, from morn till night, Was love, still love. New hope may bloom, And days may come, Of milder calmer beam, But there's nothing half so sweet in life As love's young dream: No, there's nothing half so sweet in life As love's young dream. Tho' the bard to purer fame may soar, When wild youth's past; Tho' he win the wise, who frown'd before, To smile at last; He'll never meet A joy so sweet, In all his noon of fame, As when first he sung to woman's ear His soul-felt flame, And, at every close, she blush'd to hear The one lov'd name. No,—that hallow'd form is ne'er forgot Which first love trac'd; Still it lingering haunts the greenest spot On memory's waste. 'Twas odour fled As soon as shed; 'Twas morning's winged dream; 'Twas a light, that ne'er can shine again On life's dull stream: Oh! 'twas light that ne'er can shine again On life's dull stream. THE PRINCE'S DAY. This song was written for a fête in honour of the Prince of Wales's Birthday, given by my friend, Major Bryan, at his seat in the country of Kilkenny. Tho' dark are our sorrows, to-day we'll forget them, And smile through our tears, like a sunbeam in showers: There never were hearts, if our rulers would let them, More form'd to be grateful and blest than ours. But just when the chain Has ceas'd to pain, And hope has enwreath'd it round with flowers, There comes a new link Our spirits to sink— Oh! the joy that we taste, like the light of the poles, Is a flash amid darkness, too brilliant to stay; But, though 'twere the last little spark in our souls, We must light it up now, on our Prince's Day. Contempt on the minion, who calls you disloyal! Tho' fierce to your foe, to your friends you are true; And the tribute most high to a head that is royal, Is love from a heart that loves liberty too. While cowards, who blight Your fame, your right, Would shrink from the blaze of the battle array, The Standard of Green In front would be seen,— Oh, my life on your faith! were you summon'd this minute, You'd cast every bitter remembrance away, And show what the arm of old Erin has in it, When rous'd by the foe, on her Prince's Day. He loves the Green Isle, and his love is recorded In hearts, which have suffer'd too much to forget; And hope shall be crown'd, and attachment rewarded, And Erin's gay jubilee shine out yet. The gem may be broke By many a stroke, But nothing can cloud its native ray; Each fragment will cast A light, to the last,— And thus, Erin, my country tho' broken thou art, There's a lustre within thee, that ne'er will decay; A spirit, which beams through each suffering part, And now smiles at all pain on the Prince's Day. WEEP ON, WEEP ON. Weep on, weep on, your hour is past; Your dreams of pride are o'er; The fatal chain is round you cast, And you are men no more. In vain the hero's heart hath bled; The sage's tongue hath warn'd in vain;— Oh, Freedom! once thy flame hath fled, It never lights again. Weep on—perhaps in after days, They'll learn to love your name; When many a deed may wake in praise That long hath slept in blame. And when they tread the ruin'd isle, Where rest, at length, the lord and slave, They'll wondering ask, how hands so vile Could conquer hearts so brave? “'Twas fate,” they'll say, “a wayward fate “Your web of discord wove; “And while your tyrants join'd in hate, “You never join'd in love. “But hearts fell off, that ought to twine, “And man profan'd what God had given; “Till some were heard to curse the shrine, “Where others knelt to heaven!” LESBIA HATH A BEAMING EYE. Lesbia hath a beaming eye, But no one knows for whom it beameth; Right and left its arrows fly, But what they aim at no one dreameth. Sweeter 'tis to gaze upon My Nora's lid that seldom rises; Few its looks, but every one, Like unexpected light, surprises! Oh, my Nora Creina, dear, My gentle, bashful Nora Creina, Beauty lies In many eyes, But Love in yours, my Nora Creina. Lesbia wears a robe of gold, But all so close the nymph hath lac'd it, Not a charm of beauty's mould Presumes to stay where nature plac'd it. Oh! my Nora's gown for me, That floats as wild as mountain breezes, Leaving every beauty free To sink or swell as Heaven pleases. Yes, my Nora Creina, dear, My simple, graceful Nora Creina, Nature's dress Is loveliness— The dress you wear, my Nora Creina. Lesbia hath a wit refin'd, But, when its points are gleaming round us, Who can tell if they're design'd To dazzle merely, or to wound us? Pillow'd on my Nora's heart, In safer slumber Love reposes— Bed of peace! whose roughest part Is but the crumpling of the roses. Oh! my Nora Creina dear, My mild, my artless Nora Creina! Wit, tho' bright, Hath no such light, As warms your eyes, my Nora Creina. I SAW THY FORM IN YOUTHFUL PRIME. I saw thy form in youthful prime, Nor thought that pale decay Would steal before the steps of Time, And waste its bloom away, Mary! Yet still thy features wore that light, Which fleets not with the breath; And life ne'er look'd more truly bright Than in thy smile of death, Mary! As streams that run o'er golden mines, Yet humbly, calmly glide, Nor seem to know the wealth that shines Within their gentle tide, Mary! So veil'd beneath the simplest guise, Thy radiant genius shone, And that, which charm'd all other eyes, Seem'd worthless in thy own, Mary! If souls could always dwell above, Thou ne'er hadst left that sphere; Or could we keep the souls we love, We ne'er had lost thee here, Mary! Though many a gifted mind we meet, Though fairest forms we see, To live with them is far less sweet, Than to remember thee, Mary! I have here made a feeble effort to imitate that exquisite inscription of Shenstone's, “Hue! quanto minus est cum reliquis versari quam tui meminisse!” BY THAT LAKE, WHOSE GLOOMY SHORE. This ballad is founded upon one of the many stories related of St. Kevin, whose bed in the rock is to be seen at Glendalough, a most gloomy and romantic spot in the county of Wicklow. By that Lake, whose gloomy shore Sky-lark never warbles o'er There are many other curious traditions concerning this Lake, which may be found in Giraldus, Colgan, &amp;c., Where the cliff hangs high and steep, Young Saint Kevin stole to sleep. “Here, at least,” he calmly said, “Woman ne'er shall find my bed.” Ah! the good Saint little knew What that wily sex can do. 'Twas from Kathleen's eyes he flew,— Eyes of most unholy blue! She had lov'd him well and long, Wish'd him hers, nor thought it wrong. Wheresoe'er the Saint would fly, Still he heard her light foot nigh; East or west, where'er he turn'd, Still her eyes before him burn'd. On the bold cliff's bosom cast, Tranquil now he sleeps at last; Dreams of heav'n, nor thinks that e'er Woman's smile can haunt him there. But nor earth nor heaven is free From her power, if fond she be: Even now, while calm he sleeps, Kathleen o'er him leans and weeps. Fearless she had track'd his feet To this rocky, wild retreat; And when morning met his view, Her mild glances met it too. Ah, your Saints have cruel hearts! Sternly from his bed he starts, And with rude, repulsive shock, Hurls her from the beetling rock. Glendalough, thy gloomy wave Soon was gentle Kathleen's grave! Soon the saint (yet ah! too late,) Felt her love, and mourn'd her fate. When he said, “Heav'n rest her soul!” Round the Lake light music stole; And her ghost was seen to glide, Smiling o'er the fatal tide. SHE IS FAR FROM THE LAND. She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps, And lovers are round her, sighing: But coldly she turns from their gaze, and weeps, For her heart in his grave is lying. She sings the wild song of her dear native plains, Every note which he lov'd awaking;— Ah! little they think who delight in her strains, How the heart of the Minstrel is breaking. He had liv'd for his love, for his country he died, They were all that to life had entwin'd him; Nor soon shall the tears of his country be dried, Nor long will his love stay behind him. Oh! make her a grave where the sunbeams rest, When they promise a glorious morrow; They'll shine o'er her sleep, like a smile from the West, From her own loved island of sorrow. NAY, TELL ME NOT, DEAR. Nay, tell me not, dear, that the goblet drowns One charm of feeling, one fond regret; Believe me, a few of thy angry frowns Are all I've sunk in its bright wave yet. Ne'er hath a beam Been lost in the stream That ever was shed from thy form or soul; The spell of those eyes, The balm of thy sighs, Still float on the surface, and hallow my bowl. Then fancy not, dearest, that wine can steal One blissful dream of the heart from me; Like founts that awaken the pilgrim's zeal, The bowl but brightens my love for thee. They tell us that Love in his fairy bower Had two blush-roses, of birth divine; He sprinkled the one with a rainbow's shower, But bath'd the other with mantling wine. Soon did the buds That drank of the floods Distill'd by the rainbow, decline and fade; While those which the tide Of ruby had dy'd All blush'd into beauty, like thee, sweet maid! Then fancy not, dearest, that wine can steal One blissful dream of the heart from me; Like founts, that awaken the pilgrim's zeal, The bowl but brightens my love for thee. AVENGING AND BRIGHT. Avenging and bright fall the swift sword of Erin The words of this song were suggested by the very ancient Irish story called “Deirdri, or the Lamentable Fate of the Sons of Usnach,” which has been translated literally from the Gaelic, by Mr. O'Flanagan (see vol. i. of Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Dublin), and upon which it appears that the “Darthula of Macpherson” is founded. The treachery of Conor, King of Ulster, in putting to death the three sons of Usna, was the cause of a desolating war against Ulster, which terminated in the destruction of Eman. “This story (says Mr. O'Flanagan) has been, from time immemorial, held in high repute as one of the three tragic stories of the Irish. These are, ‘The death of the children of Touran;’ ‘The death of the children of Lear’ (both regarding Tuatha de Danans), and this, ‘The death of the children of Usnach,’ which is a Milesian story.” It will be recollected, that in the Second Number of these Melodies, there is a ballad upon the story of the children of Lear or Lir; “Silent, oh Moyle!” &amp;c. Whatever may be thought of those sanguine claims to antiquity, which Mr. O'Flanagan and others advance for the literature of Ireland, it would be a lasting reproach upon our nationality, if the Gaelic researches of this gentleman did not meet with all the liberal encouragement they so well merit. On him who the brave sons of Usna betray'd!— For ev'ry fond eye he hath waken'd a tear in, A drop from his heart-wounds shall weep o'er her blade. By the red cloud that hung over Conor's dark dwelling “Oh Nasi! view that cloud that I here see in the sky! I see over Eman-green a chilling cloud of blood-tinged red.” —Deirdri's Song., When Ulad's Ulster. three champions lay sleeping in gore— By the billows of war, which so often, high swelling, Have wafted these heroes to victory's shore— We swear to revenge them!—no joy shall be tasted, The harp shall be silent, the maiden unwed, Our halls shall be mute and our fields shall lie wasted, Till vengeance is wreak'd on the murderer's head. Yes, monarch! tho' sweet are our home recollections, Though sweet are the tears that from tenderness fall; Though sweet are our friendships, our hopes, our affections, Revenge on a tyrant is sweetest of all! WHAT THE BEE IS TO THE FLOWERET. He.— What the bee is to the floweret, When he looks for honey-dew, Through the leaves that close embower it, That, my love, I'll be to you. She.— What the bank, with verdure glowing, Is to waves that wander near, Whispering kisses, while they're going, That I'll be to you, my dear. She.— But they say, the bee's a rover, Who will fly, when sweets are gone; And, when once the kiss is over, Faithless brooks will wander on. He.— Nay, if flowers will lose their looks, If sunny banks will wear away, 'Tis but right, that bees and brooks Should sip and kiss them, while they may. LOVE AND THE NOVICE. “Here we dwell, in holiest bowers, “Where angels of light o'er our orisons bend; “Where sighs of devotion and breathings of flowers “To heaven in mingled odour ascend. “Do not disturb our calm, oh Love! “So like is thy form to the cherubs above, “It well might deceive such hearts as ours.” Love stood near the Novice and listen'd, And Love is no novice in taking a hint; His laughing blue eyes soon with piety glisten'd; His rosy wing turn'd to heaven's own tint. “Who would have thought,” the urchin cries, “That Love could so well, so gravely disguise “His wandering wings, and wounding eyes?” Love now warms thee, waking and sleeping, Young Novice, to him all thy orisons rise. He tinges the heavenly fount with his weeping, He brightens the censer's flame with his sighs. Love is the Saint enshrin'd in thy breast, And angels themselves would admit such a guest, If he came to them cloth'd in Piety's vest. THIS LIFE IS ALL CHEQUER'D WITH PLEASURES AND WOES. This life is all chequer'd with pleasures and woes, That chase one another like waves of the deep,— Each brightly or darkly, as onward it flows, Reflecting our eyes, as they sparkle or weep. So closely our whims on our miseries tread, That the laugh is awak'd ere the tear can be dried; And, as fast as the rain-drop of Pity is shed, The goose-plumage of Folly can turn it aside. But pledge me the cup—if existence would cloy, With hearts ever happy, and heads ever wise, Be ours the light Sorrow, half-sister to Joy, And the light, brilliant Folly that flashes and dies. When Hylas was sent with his urn to the fount, Thro' fields full of light, and with heart full of play, Light rambled the boy, over meadow and mount, And neglected his task for the flowers on the way. Proposito florem prætulit officio. Propert. lib. i. eleg. 20. Thus many, like me, who in youth should have tasted The fountain that runs by Philosophy's shrine, Their time with the flowers on the margin have wasted, And left their light urns all as empty as mine. But pledge me the goblet;—while Idleness weaves These flowerets together, should Wisdom but see One bright drop or two that has fall'n on the leaves From her fountain divine, 'tis sufficient for me. OH THE SHAMROCK. Through Erin's Isle, To sport awhile, As Love and Valour wander'd, With Wit, the sprite, Whose quiver bright A thousand arrows squander'd. Where'er they pass, A triple grass It is said that St. Patrick, when preaching the Trinity to the Pagan Irish, used to illustrate his subject by reference to that species of trefoil called in Ireland by the name of the Shamrock; and hence, perhaps, the Island of Saints adopted this plant as her national emblem. Hope, among the ancients, was sometimes represented as a beautiful child, standing upon tip-toes, and a trefoil or three-coloured grass in her hand. Shoots up, with dew-drops streaming, As softly green As emeralds seen Thro' purest crystal gleaming. Oh the Shamrock, the green, immortal Shamrock! Chosen leaf, Of Bard and Chief, Old Erin's native Shamrock! Says Valour, “See, “They spring for me, “Those leafy gems of morning!”— Says Love, “No, no, “For me they grow, “My fragrant path adorning.” But Wit perceives The triple leaves, And cries, “Oh! do not sever “A type, that blends “Three godlike friends, “Love, Valour, Wit, for ever!” Oh the Shamrock, the green, immortal Shamrock! Chosen leaf Of Bard and Chief, Old Erin's native Shamrock! So firmly fond May last the bond, They wove that morn together, And ne'er may fall One drop of gall On Wit's celestial feather. May Love, as twine His flowers divine, Of thorny falsehood weed 'em; May Valour ne'er His standard rear Against the cause of Freedom! Oh the Shamrock, the green, immortal Shamrock! Chosen leaf Of Bard and Chief, Old Erin's native Shamrock! AT THE MID HOUR OF NIGHT. At the mid hour of night, when stars are weeping, I fly To the lone vale we lov'd, when life shone warm in thine eye; And I think oft, if spirits can steal from the regions of air, To revisit past scenes of delight, thou wilt come to me there, And tell me our love is remember'd, even in the sky. Then I sing the wild song 'twas once such pleasure to hear! When our voices commingling breath'd, like one, on the ear; And, as Echo far off through the vale my sad orison rolls, I think, oh my love! 'tis thy voice from the Kingdom of Souls “There are countries,” says Montaigne, “where they believe the souls of the happy live in all manner of liberty, in delightful fields; and that it is those souls, repeating the words we utter, which we call Echo.”, Faintly answering still the notes that once were so dear. ONE BUMPER AT PARTING. One bumper at parting!—tho' many Have circled the board since we met, The fullest, the saddest of any Remains to be crown'd by us yet. The sweetness that pleasure hath in it, Is always so slow to come forth, That seldom, alas, till the minute It dies, do we know half its worth. But come,—may our life's happy measure Be all of such moments made up; They're born on the bosom of Pleasure, They die 'midst the tears of the cup. As onward we journey, how pleasant To pause and inhabit awhile Those few sunny spots, like the present, That 'mid the dull wilderness smile! But Time, like a pitiless master, Cries “Onward!” and spurs the gay hours— Ah, never doth Time travel faster, Than when his way lies among flowers. But come—may our life's happy measure Be all of such moments made up; They're born on the bosom of Pleasure, They die 'midst the tears of the cup. We saw how the sun look'd in sinking, The waters beneath him how bright; And now, let our farewell of drinking Resemble that farewell of light. You saw how he finish'd, by darting His beam o'er a deep billow's brim— So, fill up, let's shine at our parting, In full liquid glory, like him. And oh! may our life's happy measure Of moments like this be made up, 'Twas born on the bosom of Pleasure, It dies 'mid the tears of the cup. 'TIS THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER. 'Tis the last rose of summer Left blooming alone; All her lovely companions Are faded and gone; No flower of her kindred, No rose-bud is nigh, To reflect back her blushes, Or give sigh for sigh. I'll not leave thee, thou lone one! To pine on the stem; Since the lovely are sleeping, Go, sleep thou with them. Thus kindly I scatter Thy leaves o'er the bed, Where thy mates of the garden Lie scentless and dead. So soon may I follow, When friendships decay, And from Love's shining circle The gems drop away. When true hearts lie wither'd, And fond ones are flown, Oh! who would inhabit This bleak world alone? THE YOUNG MAY MOON. The young May moon is beaming, love, The glow-worm's lamp is gleaming, love, How sweet to rove Through Morna's grove “Steals silently to Morna's grove.”—See, in Mr. Bunting's collection, a poem translated from the Irish, by the late John Brown, one of my earliest college companions and friends, whose death was as singularly melancholy and unfortunate as his life had been amiable, honourable, and exemplary., When the drowsy world is dreaming, love! Then awake!—the heavens look bright, my dear, 'Tis never too late for delight, my dear, And the best of all ways To lengthen our days, Is to steal a few hours from the night, my dear! Now all the world is sleeping, love, But the Sage, his star-watch keeping, love, And I, whose star, More glorious far, Is the eye from that casement peeping, love. Then awake!—till rise of sun, my dear, The Sage's glass we'll shun, my dear, Or, in watching the flight Of bodies of light, He might happen to take thee for one, my dear. THE MINSTREL-BOY. The Minstrel-Boy to the war is gone, In the ranks of death you'll find him; His father's sword he has girded on, And his wild harp slung behind him.— “Land of song!” said the warrior-bard, “Tho' all the world betrays thee, “One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard, “One faithful harp shall praise thee!” The Minstrel fell!—but the foeman's chain Could not bring his proud soul under; The harp he lov'd ne'er spoke again, For he tore its chords asunder; And said, “No chains shall sully thee, “Thou soul of love and bravery! “Thy songs were made for the pure and free, “They shall never sound in slavery.” THE SONG OF O'RUARK, PRINCE OF BREFFNI. These stanzas are founded upon an event of most melancholy importance to Ireland; if, as we are told by our Irish historians, it gave England the first opportunity of profiting by our divisions and subduing us. The following are the circumstances, as related by O'Halloran:—“The king of Leinster had long conceived a violent affection for Dearbhorgil, daughter to the king of Meath, and though she had been for some time married to O'Ruark, prince of Breffni, yet it could not restrain his passion. They carried on a private correspondence, and she informed him that O'Ruark intended soon to go on a pilgrimage (an act of piety frequent in those days), and conjured him to embrace that opportunity of conveying her from a husband she detested to a lover she adored. Mac Murchad too punctually obeyed the summons, and had the lady conveyed to his capital of Ferns.”—The monarch Roderick espoused the cause of O'Ruark, while Mac Murchad fled to England, and obtained the assistance of Henry II. “Such,” adds Giraldus Cambrensis (as I find him in an old translation), “is the variable and fickle nature of woman, by whom all mischief in the world (for the most part) do happen and come, as may appear by Marcus Antonius, and by the destruction of Troy.” The valley lay smiling before me, Where lately I left her behind; Yet I trembled, and something hung o'er me, That saddened the joy of my mind. I look'd for the lamp which, she told me, Should shine, when her Pilgrim return'd; But, though darkness began to infold me, No lamp from the battlements burn'd! I flew to her chamber—'twas lonely, As if the lov'd tenant lay dead;— Ah, would it were death, and death only! But no, the young false one had fled. And there hung the lute that could soften My very worst pains into bliss; While the hand, that had wak'd it so often, Now throbb'd to a proud rival's kiss. There was a time, falsest of women, When Breffni's good sword would have sought That man, thro' a million of foemen, Who dar'd but to wrong thee in thought! While now—oh degenerate daughter Of Erin, how fall'n is thy fame! And thro' ages of bondage and slaughter, Our country shall bleed for thy shame. Already, the curse is upon her, And strangers her valleys profane; They come to divide, to dishonour, And tyrants they long will remain. But onward!—the green banner rearing, Go, flesh every sword to the hilt; On our side is Virtue and Erin, On theirs is the Saxon and Guilt. OH! HAD WE SOME BRIGHT LITTLE ISLE OF OUR OWN. Oh! had we some bright little isle of our own, In a blue summer ocean, far off and alone, Where a leaf never dies in the still blooming bowers, And the bee banquets on through a whole year of flowers; Where the sun loves to pause With so fond a delay, That the night only draws A thin veil o'er the day; Where simply to feel that we breathe, that we live, Is worth the best joy that life elsewhere can give. There, with souls ever ardent and pure as the clime, We should love, as they lov'd in the first golden time; The glow of the sunshine, the balm of the air, Would steal to our hearts, and make all summer there. With affection as free From decline as the bowers, And, with hope, like the bee, Living always on flowers, Our life should resemble a long day of light, And our death come on, holy and calm as the night. FAREWELL!—BUT WHENEVER YOU WELCOME THE HOUR. Farewell!—but whenever you welcome the hour, That awakens the night-song of mirth in your bower, Then think of the friend who once welcom'd it too, And forgot his own griefs to be happy with you. His griefs may return, not a hope may remain Of the few that have brighten'd his pathway of pain, But he ne'er will forget the short vision, that threw Its enchantment around him, while ling'ring with you. And still on that evening, when pleasure fills up To the highest top sparkle each heart and each cup, Where'er my path lies, be it gloomy or bright, My soul, happy friends, shall be with you that night; Shall join in your revels, your sports, and your wiles, And return to me, beaming all o'er with your smiles— Too blest, if it tells me that, 'mid the gay cheer Some kind voice had murmur'd, “I wish he were here!” Let Fate do her worst, there are relics of joy, Bright dreams of the past, which she cannot destroy; Which come in the night-time of sorrow and care, And bring back the features that joy used to wear. Long, long be my heart with such memories fill'd! Like the vase, in which roses have once been distill'd— You may break, you may shatter the vase, if you will, But the scent of the roses will hang round it still. OH! DOUBT ME NOT. Oh! doubt me not—the season Is o'er, when Folly made me rove, And now the vestal, Reason, Shall watch the fire awak'd by Love. Altho' this heart was early blown, And fairest hands disturb'd the tree, They only shook some blossoms down, Its fruit has all been kept for thee. Then doubt me not—the season Is o'er, when Folly made me rove, And now the vestal, Reason, Shall watch the fire awak'd by Love. And tho' my lute no longer May sing of Passion's ardent spell, Yet, trust me, all the stronger I feel the bliss I do not tell. The bee through many a garden roves, And hums his lay of courtship o'er, But when he finds the flower he loves, He settles there, and hums no more. Then doubt me not—the season Is o'er, when Folly kept me free. And now the vestal, Reason, Shall guard the flame awak'd by thee. YOU REMEMBER ELLEN. This ballad was suggested by a well-known and interesting story told of a certain noble family in England. You remember Ellen, our hamlet's pride, How meekly she blessed her humble lot, When the stranger, William, had made her his bride, And love was the light of their lowly cot. Together they toil'd through winds and rains, Till William, at length, in sadness said, “We must seek our fortune on other plains;”— Then, sighing, she left her lowly shed. They roam'd a long and a weary way, Nor much was the maiden's heart at ease, When now, at close of one stormy day, They see a proud castle among the trees. “To-night,” said the youth, “we'll shelter there; “The wind blows cold, the hour is late:” So he blew the horn with a chieftain's air, And the Porter bow'd, as they pass'd the gate. “Now, welcome, Lady,” exclaim'd the youth,— “This castle is thine, and these dark woods all!” She believ'd him crazed, but his words were truth, For Ellen is Lady of Rosna Hall! And dearly the Lord of Rosna loves What William the stranger woo'd and wed; And the light of bliss, in these lordly groves, Shines pure as it did in the lowly shed. I'D MOURN THE HOPES. I'd mourn the hopes that leave me, If thy smiles had left me too; I'd weep when friends deceive me, If thou wert, like them, untrue. But while I've thee before me, With heart so warm and eyes so bright, No clouds can linger o'er me, That smile turns them all to light. 'Tis not in fate to harm me, While fate leaves thy love to me; 'Tis not in joy to charm me, Unless joy be shared with thee. One minute's dream about thee Were worth a long, an endless year Of waking bliss without thee, My own love, my only dear! And tho' the hope be gone, love, That long sparkled o'er our way, Oh! we shall journey on, love, More safely, without its ray. Far better lights shall win me Along the path I've yet to roam:— The mind that burns within me, And pure smiles from thee at home. Thus, when the lamp that lighted The traveller at first goes out, He feels awhile benighted, And looks round in fear and doubt. But soon, the prospect clearing, By cloudless starlight on he treads, And thinks no lamp so cheering As that light which Heaven sheds. COME O'ER THE SEA. Come o'er the sea, Maiden, with me, Mine thro' sunshine, storm, and snows: Seasons may roll, But the true soul Burns the same, where'er it goes. Let fate frown on, so we love and part not; 'Tis life where thou art, 'tis death where thou art not. Then come o'er the sea, Maiden, with me, Come wherever the wild wind blows; Seasons may roll, But the true soul Burns the same, where'er it goes. Was not the sea Made for the Free, Land for courts and chains alone? Here we are slaves, But, on the waves, Love and Liberty's all our own. No eye to watch, and no tongue to wound us, All earth forgot, and all heaven around us— Then come o'er the sea, Maiden, with me, Mine thro' sunshine, storm, and snows; Seasons may roll, But the true soul Burns the same, where'er it goes. HAS SORROW THY YOUNG DAYS SHADED. Has sorrow thy young days shaded, As clouds o'er the morning fleet? Too fast have those young days faded, That, even in sorrow, were sweet? Does Time with his cold wing wither Each feeling that once was dear?— Then, child of misfortune, come hither, I'll weep with thee, tear for tear. Has love to that soul, so tender, Been like our Lagenian mine Our Wicklow Gold Mines, to which this verse alludes, deserve, I fear, but too well the character here given of them., Where sparkles of golden splendour All over the surface shine— But, if in pursuit we go deeper, Allur'd by the gleam that shone, Ah! false as the dream of the sleeper, Like Love, the bright ore is gone. Has Hope, like the bird in the story “The bird, having got its prize, settled not far off, with the talisman in his mouth. The prince drew near it, hoping it would drop it; but, as he approached, the bird took wing, and settled again,” &amp;c. —Arabian Nights., That flitted from tree to tree With the talisman's glittering glory— Has Hope been that bird to thee? On branch after branch alighting, The gem did she still display, And, when nearest and most inviting, Then waft the fair gem away? If thus the young hours have fleeted, When sorrow itself looked bright; If thus the fair hope hath cheated, That led thee along so light; If thus the cold world now wither Each feeling that once was dear:— Come, child of misfortune, come hither, I'll weep with thee, tear for tear. NO, NOT MORE WELCOME. No, not more welcome the fairy numbers Of music fall on the sleeper's ear, When half-awaking from fearful slumbers, He thinks the full quire of heaven is near,— Than came that voice, when, all forsaken, This heart long had sleeping lain, Nor thought its cold pulse would ever waken To such benign, blessed sounds again. Sweet voice of comfort! 'twas like the stealing Of summer wind thro' some wreathed shell— Each secret winding, each inmost feeling Of all my soul echoed to its spell. 'Twas whisper'd balm—'twas sunshine spoken!— I'd live years of grief and pain To have my long sleep of sorrow broken By such benign, blessed sounds again. WHEN FIRST I MET THEE. When first I met thee, warm and young, There shone such truth about thee, And on thy lip such promise hung, I did not dare to doubt thee. I saw thee change, yet still relied, Still clung with hope the fonder, And thought, tho' false to all beside, From me thou couldst not wander. But go, deceiver! go, The heart, whose hopes could make it Trust one so false, so low, Deserves that thou shouldst break it. When every tongue thy follies nam'd, I fled the unwelcome story; Or found, in ev'n the faults they blam'd, Some gleams of future glory. I still was true, when nearer friends Conspired to wrong, to slight thee; The heart that now thy falsehood rends, Would then have bled to right thee. But go, deceiver! go,— Some day, perhaps, thou'lt waken From pleasure's dream, to know The grief of hearts forsaken. Even now, tho' youth its bloom has shed, No lights of age adorn thee: The few, who lov'd thee once, have fled, And they who flatter scorn thee. Thy midnight cup is pledg'd to slaves, No genial ties enwreath it; The smiling there, like light on graves, Has rank cold hearts beneath it. Go—go—tho' worlds were thine, I would not now surrender One taintless tear of mine For all thy guilty splendour! And days may come, thou false one! yet, When even those ties shall sever; When thou wilt call, with vain regret, On her thou'st lost for ever; On her who, in thy fortune's fall, With smiles had still receiv'd thee, And gladly died to prove thee all Her fancy first believ'd thee. Go—go—'tis vain to curse, 'Tis weakness to upbraid thee; Hate cannot wish thee worse Than guilt and shame have made thee. WHILE HISTORY'S MUSE. While History's Muse the memorial was keeping Of all that the dark hand of Destiny weaves, Beside her the Genius of Erin stood weeping, For hers was the story that blotted the leaves. But oh! how the tear in her eyelids grew bright, When, after whole pages of sorrow and shame, She saw History write, With a pencil of light That illum'd the whole volume, her Wellington's name. “Hail, Star of my Isle!” said the Spirit, all sparkling With beams, such as break from her own dewy skies— “Thro' ages of sorrow, deserted and darkling, “I've watch'd for some glory like thine to arise. “For, tho' Heroes I've number'd, unblest was their lot, “And unhallow'd they sleep in the cross-ways of Fame;— “But oh! there is not “One dishonouring blot “On the wreath that encircles my Wellington's name. “Yet still the last crown of thy toils is remaining, “The grandest, the purest, ev'n thou hast yet known; “Tho' proud was thy task, other nations unchaining, “Far prouder to heal the deep wounds of thy own. “At the foot of that throne, for whose weal thou hast stood, “Go, plead for the land that first cradled thy fame, “And, bright o'er the flood “Of her tears and her blood, “Let the rainbow of Hope be her Wellington's name!” THE TIME I'VE LOST IN WOOING. The time I've lost in wooing, In watching and pursuing The light, that lies In woman's eyes, Has been my heart's undoing. Tho' Wisdom oft has sought me, I scorn'd the lore she brought me, My only books Were woman's looks, And folly's all they've taught me. Her smile when Beauty granted, I hung with gaze enchanted, Like him the Sprite This alludes to a kind of Irish fairy, which is to be met with, they say, in the fields at dusk. As long as you keep your eyes upon him, he is fixed, and in your power;—but the moment you look away (and he is ingenious in furnishing some inducement) he vanishes. I had thought that this was the sprite which we call the Leprechaun; but a high authority upon such subjects, Lady Morgan, (in a note upon her national and interesting novel, O'Donnel,) has given a very different account of that goblin., Whom maids by night Oft meet in glen that's haunted. Like him, too, Beauty won me, But while her eyes were on me, If once their ray Was turn'd away, O! winds could not outrun me. And are those follies going? And is my proud heart growing Too cold or wise For brilliant eyes Again to set it glowing? No, vain, alas! th' endeavour From bonds so sweet to sever; Poor Wisdom's chance Against a glance Is now as weak as ever. WHERE IS THE SLAVE. Oh, where's the slave so lowly, Condemn'd to chains unholy, Who, could he burst His bonds at first, Would pine beneath them slowly? What soul, whose wrongs degrade it, Would wait till time decay'd it, When thus its wing At once may spring To the throne of Him who made it? Farewell, Erin,—farewell, all, Who live to weep our fall! Less dear the laurel growing, Alive, untouch'd and blowing, Than that, whose braid Is pluck'd to shade The brows with victory glowing. We tread the land that bore us, Her green flag glitters o'er us, The friends we've tried Are by our side, And the foe we hate before us. Farewell, Erin,—farewell, all, Who live to weep our fall! COME, REST IN THIS BOSOM. Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer, Tho' the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here; Here still is the smile, that no cloud can o'ercast, And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last. Oh! what was love made for, if 'tis not the same Thro' joy and thro' torment, thro' glory and shame? I know not, I ask not, if guilt's in that heart, I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art. Thou hast call'd me thy Angel in moments of bliss, And thy Angel I'll be, 'mid the horrors of this,— Thro' the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue, And shield thee, and save thee,—or perish there too! 'TIS GONE, AND FOR EVER. 'Tis gone, and for ever, the light we saw breaking, Like Heaven's first dawn o'er the sleep of the dead— When Man, from the slumber of ages awaking, Look'd upward, and bless'd the pure ray, ere it fled. 'Tis gone, and the gleams it has left of its burning But deepen the long night of bondage and mourning, That dark o'er the kingdoms of earth is returning, And darkest of all, hapless Erin, o'er thee. For high was thy hope, when those glories were darting Around thee, thro' all the gross clouds of the world; When Truth, from her fetters indignantly starting, At once, like a Sun-burst, her banner unfurl'd. “The Sun-burst” was the fanciful name given by the ancient Irish to the Royal Banner. Oh! never shall earth see a moment so splendid! Then, then—had one Hymn of Deliverance blended The tongues of all nations—how sweet had ascended The first note of Liberty, Erin, from thee! But, shame on those tyrants, who envied the blessing! And shame on the light race, unworthy its good, Who, at Death's reeking altar, like furies, caressing The young hope of Freedom, baptiz'd it in blood. Then vanish'd for ever that fair, sunny vision, Which, spite of the slavish, the cold heart's derision, Shall long be remember'd, pure, bright, and elysian, As first it arose, my lost Erin, on thee. I SAW FROM THE BEACH. I saw from the beach, when the morning was shining, A bark o'er the waters move gloriously on; I came when the sun o'er that beach was declining, The bark was still there, but the waters were gone. And such is the fate of our life's early promise, So passing the spring-tide of joy we have known; Each wave, that we danc'd on at morning, ebbs from us, And leaves us, at eve, on the bleak shore alone. Ne'er tell me of glories, serenely adorning The close of our day, the calm eve of our night;— Give me back, give me back the wild freshness of Morning, Her clouds and her tears are worth Evening's best light. Oh, who would not welcome that moment's returning, When passion first wak'd a new life thro' his frame, And his soul, like the wood, that grows precious in burning, Gave out all its sweets to love's exquisite flame. FILL THE BUMPER FAIR. Fill the bumper fair! Every drop we sprinkle O'er the brow of Care Smooths away a wrinkle. Wit's electric flame Ne'er so swiftly passes, As when thro' the frame It shoots from brimming glasses. Fill the bumper fair! Every drop we sprinkle O'er the brow of Care Smooths away a wrinkle. Sages can, they say, Grasp the lightning's pinions, And bring down its ray From the starr'd dominions:— So we, Sages, sit, And, 'mid bumpers bright'ning, From the Heaven of Wit Draw down all its lightning. Would'st thou know what first Made our souls inherit This ennobling thirst For wine's celestial spirit? It chanc'd upon that day, When, as bards inform us, Prometheus stole away The living fires that warm us: The careless Youth, when up To Glory's fount aspiring, Took nor urn nor cup To hide the pilfer'd fire in.— But oh his joy, when, round The halls of Heaven spying, Among the stars he found A bowl of Bacchus lying! Some drops were in that bowl, Remains of last night's pleasure, With which the Sparks of Soul Mix'd their burning treasure. Hence the goblet's shower Hath such spells to win us; Hence its mighty power O'er that flame within us. Fill the bumper fair! Every drop we sprinkle O'er the brow of Care Smooths away a wrinkle. DEAR HARP OF MY COUNTRY. Dear Harp of my Country! in darkness I found thee, The cold chain of silence had hung o'er thee long In that rebellious but beautiful song, “When Erin first rose,” there is, if I recollect right, the following line:— “The dark chain of Silence was thrown o'er the deep.” The chain of Silence was a sort of practical figure of rhetoric among the ancient Irish. Walker tells us of “a celebrated contention for precedence between Finn and Gaul, near Finn's palace at Almhaim, where the attending Bards, anxious, if possible, to produce a cessation of hostilities, shook the chain of Silence, and flung themselves among the ranks.” See also the Ode to Gaul, the Son of Morni, in Miss Brooke's Reliques of Irish Poetry., When proudly, my own Island Harp, I unbound thee, And gave all thy chords to light, freedom, and song! The warm lay of love and the light note of gladness Have waken'd thy fondest, thy liveliest thrill; But, so oft hast thou echo'd the deep sigh of sadness, That ev'n in thy mirth it will steal from thee still. Dear Harp of my country! farewell to thy numbers, This sweet wreath of song is the last we shall twine! Go, sleep with the sunshine of Fame on thy slumbers, Till touch'd by some hand less unworthy than mine; If the pulse of the patriot, soldier, or lover, Have throbb'd at our lay, 'tis thy glory alone; I was but as the wind, passing heedlessly over, And all the wild sweetness I wak'd was thy own. END OF THE THIRD VOLUME. MY GENTLE HARP. My gentle Harp, once more I waken The sweetness of thy slumbering strain; In tears our last farewell was taken, And now in tears we meet again. No light of joy hath o'er thee broken, But, like those Harps whose heav'nly skill Of slavery, dark as thine, hath spoken, Thou hang'st upon the willows still. And yet, since last thy chord resounded, An hour of peace and triumph came, And many an ardent bosom bounded With hopes—that now are turn'd to shame. Yet even then, while Peace was singing Her halcyon song o'er land and sea, Tho' joy and hope to others bringing, She only brought new tears to thee. Then, who can ask for notes of pleasure, My drooping Harp, from chords like thine? Alas, the lark's gay morning measure As ill would suit the swan's decline! Or how shall I, who love, who bless thee, Invoke thy breath for Freedom's strains, When ev'n the wreaths in which I dress thee, Are sadly mix'd—half flow'rs, half chains? But come—if yet thy frame can borrow One breath of joy, oh, breathe for me, And show the world, in chains and sorrow, How sweet thy music still can be; How gaily, ev'n mid gloom surounding, Thou yet canst wake at pleasure's thrill— Like Memnon's broken image sounding, 'Mid desolation tuneful still! Dimidio magicæ resonant ubi Memnone chordæ. —Juvenal. IN THE MORNING OF LIFE. In the morning of life, when its cares are unknown, And its pleasures in all their new lustre begin, When we live in a bright-beaming world of our own, And the light that surrounds us is all from within; Oh 'tis not, believe me, in that happy time We can love, as in hours of less transport we may;— Of our smiles, of our hopes, 'tis the gay sunny prime, But affection is truest when these fade away. When we see the first glory of youth pass us by, Like a leaf on the stream that will never return; When our cup, which had sparkled with pleasure so high, First tastes of the other, the dark-flowing urn; Then, then is the time when affection holds sway With a depth and a tenderness joy never knew; Love, nursed among pleasures, is faithless as they, But the love born of Sorrow, like Sorrow, is true. In climes full of sunshine, though splendid the flowers, Their sighs have no freshness, their odour no worth; 'Tis the cloud and the mist of our own Isle of showers, That call the rich spirit of fragrancy forth. So it is not mid splendour, prosperity, mirth, That the depth of Love's generous spirit appears; To the sunshine of smiles it may first owe its birth, But the soul of its sweetness is drawn out by tears. AS SLOW OUR SHIP. As slow our ship her foamy track Against the wind was cleaving, Her trembling pennant still look'd back To that dear isle 'twas leaving. So loath we part from all we love, From all the links that bind us; So turn our hearts as on we rove, To those we've left behind us. When, round the bowl, of vanish'd years We talk, with joyous seeming,— With smiles that might as well be tears, So faint, so sad their beaming; While mem'ry brings us back again Each early tie that twined us, Oh, sweet's the cup that circles then To those we've left behind us. And when, in other climes, we meet Some isle, or vale enchanting, Where all looks flow'ry, wild, and sweet, And nought but love is wanting; We think how great had been our bliss, If Heav'n had but assign'd us To live and die in scenes like this, With some we've left behind us! As trav'llers oft look back at eve, When eastward darkly going, To gaze upon that light they leave Still faint behind them glowing,— So, when the close of pleasure's day To gloom hath near consign'd us, We turn to catch one fading ray Of joy that's left behind us. WHEN COLD IN THE EARTH. When cold in the earth lies the friend thou hast loved, Be his faults and his follies forgot by thee then; Or, if from their slumber the veil be removed, Weep o'er them in silence, and close it again. And oh! if 'tis pain to remember how far From the pathways of light he was tempted to roam, Be it bliss to remember that thou wert the star That arose on his darkness, and guided him home. From thee and thy innocent beauty first came The revealings, that taught him true love to adore, To feel the bright presence, and turn him with shame From the idols he blindly had knelt to before. O'er the waves of a life, long benighted and wild, Thou camest, like a soft golden calm o'er the sea; And if happiness purely and glowingly smiled On his ev'ning horizon, the light was from thee. And tho', sometimes, the shades of past folly might rise, And tho' falsehood again would allure him to stray, He but turn'd to the glory that dwelt in those eyes, And the folly, the falsehood, soon vanish'd away. As the Priests of the Sun, when their altar grew dim, At the day-beam alone could its lustre repair, So, if virtue a moment grew languid in him, He but flew to that smile and rekindled it there. REMEMBER THEE. Remember thee? yes, while there's life in this heart, It shall never forget thee, all lorn as thou art; More dear in thy sorrow, thy gloom, and thy showers, Than the rest of the world in their sunniest hours. Wert thou all that I wish thee, great, glorious, and free, First flower of the earth, and first gem of the sea, I might hail thee with prouder, with happier brow, But oh! could I love thee more deeply than now? No, thy chains as they rankle, thy blood as it runs, But make thee more painfully dear to thy sons— Whose hearts, like the young of the desert-bird's nest, Drink love in each life-drop that flows from thy breast. WREATH THE BOWL. Wreath the bowl With flowers of soul, The brightest Wit can find us; We'll take a flight Tow'rds heaven to-night, And leave dull earth behind us. Should Love amid The wreaths be hid, That joy, th' enchanter, brings us, No danger fear, While wine is near, We'll drown him if he stings us. Then, wreath the bowl With flowers of soul, The brightest Wit can find us; We'll take a flight Tow'rds heaven to-night, And leave dull earth behind us. 'Twas nectar fed Of old, 'tis said, Their Junos, Joves, Apollos; And man may brew His nectar too, The rich receipt's as follows: Take wine like this, Let looks of bliss Around it well be blended, Then bring Wit's beam To warm the stream, And there's your nectar, splendid! So wreath the bowl With flowers of soul, The brightest Wit can find us; We'll take a flight Tow'rds heaven to-night, And leave dull earth behind us. Say, why did Time His glass sublime Fill up with sands unsightly, When wine, he knew, Runs brisker through, And sparkles far more brightly? Oh, lend it us, And, smiling thus, The glass in two we'll sever, Make pleasure glide In double tide, And fill both ends for ever! Then wreath the bowl With flowers of soul The brightest Wit can find us; We'll take a flight Tow'rds heaven to-night, And leave dull earth behind us. WHENE'ER I SEE THOSE SMILING EYES. Whene'er I see those smiling eyes, So full of hope, and joy, and light, As if no cloud could ever rise, To dim a heav'n so purely bright— I sigh to think how soon that brow In grief may lose its every ray, And that light heart, so joyous now, Almost forget it once was gay. For time will come with all its blights, The ruined hope, the friend unkind, And love, that leaves, where'er it lights, A chill'd or burning heart behind:— While youth, that now like snow appears, Ere sullied by the dark'ning rain, When once 'tis touch'd by sorrow's tears Can never shine so bright again. IF THOU'LT BE MINE. If thou'lt be mine, the treasures of air, Of earth, and sea, shall lie at thy feet; Whatever in Fancy's eye looks fair, Or in Hope's sweet music sounds most sweet, Shall be ours—if thou wilt be mine, love! Bright flowers shall bloom wherever we rove, A voice divine shall talk in each stream; The stars shall look like worlds of love, And this earth be all one beautiful dream In our eyes—if thou wilt be mine, love! And thoughts, whose source is hidden and high, Like streams, that come from heaven-ward hills, Shall keep our hearts, like meads, that lie To be bathed by those eternal rills, Ever green, if thou wilt be mine, love! All this and more the Spirit of Love Can breathe o'er them, who feel his spells; That heaven, which forms his home above, He can make on earth, wherever he dwells, As thou'lt own,—if thou wilt be mine, love! TO LADIES' EYES. To Ladies' eyes around, boy, We can't refuse, we can't refuse, Tho' bright eyes so abound, boy, 'Tis hard to choose, 'tis hard to choose. For thick as stars that lighten Yon airy bow'rs, yon airy bow'rs, The countless eyes that brighten This earth of ours, this earth of ours. But fill the cup—where'er, boy, Our choice may fall, our choice may fall, We're sure to find Love there, boy, So drink them all! so drink them all! Some looks there are so holy, They seem but giv'n, they seem but giv'n, As shining beacons, solely, To light to heav'n, to light to heav'n. While some—oh! ne'er believe them— With tempting ray, with tempting ray, Would lead us (God forgive them!) The other way, the other way. But fill the cup—where'er, boy, Our choice may fall, our choice may fall, We're sure to find Love there, boy, So drink them all! so drink them all! In some, as in a mirror, Love seems pourtray'd, Love seems pourtray'd, But shun the flattering error, 'Tis but his shade, 'tis but his shade. Himself has fix'd his dwelling In eyes we know, in eyes we know, And lips—but this is telling— So here they go! so here they go! Fill up, fill up—where'er, boy, Our choice may fall, our choice may fall, We're sure to find Love there, boy, So drink them all! so drink them all! FORGET NOT THE FIELD. Forget not the field where they perish'd, The truest, the last of the brave, All gone—and the bright hope we cherish'd Gone with them, and quench'd in their grave! Oh! could we from death but recover Those hearts as they bounded before, In the face of high heav'n to fight over That combat for freedom once more;— Could the chain for an instant be riven Which Tyranny flung round us then, No, 'tis not in Man, nor in Heaven, To let Tyranny bind it again! But 'tis past—and, tho' blazon'd in story The name of our Victor may be, Accurst is the march of that glory Which treads o'er the hearts of the free. Far dearer the grave or the prison, Illumed by one patriot name, Than the trophies of all, who have risen On Liberty's ruins to fame. THEY MAY RAIL AT THIS LIFE. They may rail at this life—from the hour I began it, I found it a life full of kindness and bliss; And, until they can show me some happier planet, More social and bright, I'll content me with this. As long as the world has such lips and such eyes, As before me this moment enraptured I see, They may say what they will of their orbs in the skies, But this earth is the planet for you, love, and me. In Mercury's star, where each moment can bring them New sunshine and wit from the fountain on high, Tho' the nymphs may have livelier poets to sing them Tous les habitans de Mercure sont vifs. —Pluralité des Mondes., They've none, even there, more enamour'd than I. And, as long as this harp can be waken'd to love, And that eye its divine inspiration shall be, They may talk as they will of their Edens above, But this earth is the planet for you, love, and me. In that star of the west, by whose shadowy splendour, At twilight so often we've roam'd through the dew, There are maidens, perhaps, who have bosoms as tender, And look, in their twilights, as lovely as you. La Terre pourra être pour Vénus l'étoile du berger et la mère des amours, comme Vénus l'est pour nous. —Pluralité des Mondes. But tho' they were even more bright than the queen Of that isle they inhabit in heaven's blue sea, As I never those fair young celestials have seen, Why—this earth is the planet for you, love, and me. As for those chilly orbs on the verge of creation, Where sunshine and smiles must be equally rare, Did they want a supply of cold hearts for that station, Heav'n knows we have plenty on earth we could spare. Oh! think what a world we should have of it here, If the haters of peace, of affection and glee, Were to fly up to Saturn's comfortless sphere, And leave earth to such spirits as you, love, and me. OH FOR THE SWORDS OF FORMER TIME! Oh for the swords of former time! Oh for the men who bore them, When arm'd for Right, they stood sublime, And tyrants crouch'd before them: When free yet, ere courts began With honours to enslave him, The best honours worn by Man Were those which Virtue gave him. Oh for the swords, &amp;c. &amp;c. Oh for the Kings who flourish'd then! Oh for the pomp that crown'd them, When hearts and hands of freeborn men Were all the ramparts round them. When, safe built on bosoms true, The throne was but the centre, Round which Love a circle drew, That Treason durst not enter. Oh for the Kings who flourish'd then! Oh for the pomp that crown'd them, When hearts and hands of freeborn men Were all the ramparts round them! ST. SENANUS AND THE LADY. ST. SENANUS.In a metrical life of St. Senanus, which is taken from an old Kilkenny MS., and may be found among the Acta Sanctorum Hiberniæ, we are told of his flight to the island of Scattery, and his resolution not to admit any woman of the party; he refused to receive even a sister saint, St. Cannera, whom an angel had taken to the island for the express purpose of introducing her to him. The following was the ungracious answer of Senanus, according to his poetical biographer: Cui Præsul, quid fœminis Commune est cum monachis? Nec te nec ullam aliam Admittemus in insulam. See the Acta Sanct. Hib., page 610. According to Dr. Ledwich, St. Senanus was no less a personage than the river Shannon; but O'Connor and other antiquarians deny the metamorphose indignantly. “Oh! haste and leave this sacred isle, “Unholy bark, ere morning smile; “For on thy deck, though dark it be, “A female form I see; “And I have sworn this sainted sod “Shall ne'er by woman's feet be trod.” THE LADY. “Oh! Father, send not hence my bark, “Through wintry winds and billows dark: “I come with humble heart to share “Thy morn and evening prayer; “Nor mine the feet, oh! holy Saint, “The brightness of thy sod to taint.” The Lady's prayer Senanus spurn'd; The winds blew fresh, the bark return'd; But legends hint, that had the maid Till morning's light delay'd, And given the saint one rosy smile, She ne'er had left his lonely isle. NE'ER ASK THE HOUR. Ne'er ask the hour—what is it to us How Time deals out his treasures? The golden moments lent us thus, Are not his coin, but Pleasure's. If counting them o'er could add to their blisses, I'd number each glorious second: But moments of joy are, like Lesbia's kisses, Too quick and sweet to be reckon'd. Then fill the cup—what is it to us How time his circle measures? The fairy hours we call up thus, Obey no wand but Pleasure's. Young Joy ne'er thought of counting hours, Till Care, one summer's morning, Set up, among his smiling flowers, A dial, by way of warning. But Joy loved better to gaze on the sun, As long as its light was glowing, Than to watch with old Care how the shadow stole on, And how fast that light was going. So fill the cup—what is it to us How Time his circle measures? The fairy hours we call up thus, Obey no wand but Pleasure's. SAIL ON, SAIL ON. Sail on, sail on, thou fearless bark— Wherever blows the welcome wind, It cannot lead to scenes more dark, More sad than those we leave behind. Each wave that passes seems to say, “Though death beneath our smile may be, “Less cold we are, less false than they, “Whose smiling wreck'd thy hopes and thee.” Sail on, sail on,—through endless space— Through calm—through tempest—stop no more: The stormiest sea's a resting place To him who leaves such hearts on shore. Or—if some desert land we meet, Where never yet false-hearted men Profaned a world, that else were sweet,— Then rest thee, bark, but not till then. THE PARALLEL. Yes, sad one of Sion These verses were written after the perusal of a treatise by Mr. Hamilton, professing to prove that the Irish were originally Jews., if closely resembling, In shame and in sorrow, thy wither'd-up heart— If drinking deep, deep, of the same “cup of trembling” Could make us thy children, our parent thou art. Like thee doth our nation lie conquer'd and broken, And fall'n from her head is the once royal crown; In her streets, in her halls, Desolation hath spoken, And “while it is day yet, her sun hath gone down.” “Her sun is gone down while it was yet day.” —Jer. xv. 9. Like thine doth her exile, 'mid dreams of returning, Die far from the home it were life to behold; Like thine do her sons, in the day of their mourning, Remember the bright things that bless'd them of old. Ah, well may we call her, like thee “the Forsaken “Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken.” —Isaiah, lxii. 4.,” Her boldest are vanquish'd, her proudest are slaves; And the harps of her minstrels, when gayest they waken, Have tones mid their mirth like the wind over graves! Yet hadst thou thy vengeance—yet came there the morrow, That shines out, at last, on the longest dark night, When the sceptre, that smote thee with slavery and sorrow, Was shiver'd at once, like a reed, in thy sight. When that cup, which for others the proud Golden City “How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!” —Isaiah, xiv. 11. Had brimm'd full of bitterness, drench'd her own lips; And the world she had trampled on heard, without pity, The howl in her halls, and the cry from her ships. When the curse Heaven keeps for the haughty came over Her merchants rapacious, her rulers unjust, And, a ruin, at last, for the earthworm to cover “Thy pomp is brought down to the grave ? and the worms cover thee.” —Isaiah, xiv. 4., The Lady of Kingdoms “Thou shalt no more be called the Lady of Kingdoms.” —Isaiah, xlvii. 5. lay low in the dust. DRINK OF THIS CUP. Drink of this cup;—you'll find there's a spell in Its every drop 'gainst the ills of mortality; Talk of the cordial that sparkled for Helen! Her cup was a fiction, but this is reality. Would you forget the dark world we are in, Just taste of the bubble that gleams on the top of it; But would you rise above earth, till akin To Immortals themselves, you must drain every drop of it; Send round the cup—for oh there's a spell in Its every drop 'gainst the ills of mortality; Talk of the cordial that sparkled for Helen! Her cup was a fiction, but this is reality. Never was philter form'd with such power To charm and bewilder as this we are quaffing; Its magic began when, in Autumn's rich hour, A harvest of gold in the fields it stood laughing. There having, by Nature's enchantment, been fill'd With the balm and the bloom of her kindliest weather, This wonderful juice from its core was distill'd To enliven such hearts as are here brought together. Then drink of the cup—you'll find there's a spell in Its every drop 'gainst the ills of mortality; Talk of the cordial that sparkled for Helen! Her cup was a fiction, but this is reality. And though, perhaps—but breathe it to no one— Like liquor the witch brews at midnight so awful, This philter in secret was first taught to flow on, Yet 'tis n't less potent for being unlawful. And, ev'n though it taste of the smoke of that flame, Which in silence extracted its virtue forbidden— Fill up—there's a fire in some hearts I could name, Which may work too its charm, though as lawless and hidden. So drink of the cup—for oh there's a spell in Its every drop 'gainst the ills of mortality; Talk of the cordial that sparkled for Helen! Her cup was a fiction, but this is reality. THE FORTUNE-TELLER. Down in the valley come meet me to-night, And I'll tell you your fortune truly As ever 'twas told, by the new-moon's light, To a young maiden, shining as newly. But, for the world, let no one be nigh, Lest haply the stars should deceive me; Such secrets between you and me and the sky Should never go farther, believe me. If at that hour the heav'ns be not dim, My science shall call up before you A male apparition,—the image of him Whose destiny 'tis to adore you. And if to that phantom you'll be kind, So fondly around you he'll hover, You'll hardly, my dear, any difference find 'Twixt him and a true living lover. Down at your feet, in the pale moonlight, He'll kneel, with a warmth of devotion— An ardour, of which such an innocent sprite You'd scarcely believe had a notion. What other thoughts and events may arise, As in destiny's book I've not seen them, Must only be left to the stars and your eyes To settle, ere morning, between them. OH, YE DEAD! Oh, ye Dead! oh, ye Dead! Paul Zealand mentions that there is a mountain in some part of Ireland, where the ghosts of persons who have died in foreign lands walk about and converse with those they meet, like living people. If asked why they do not return to their homes, they say they are obliged to go to Mount Hecla, and disappear immediately. whom we know by the light you give From your cold gleaming eyes, though you move like men who live, Why leave you thus your graves, In far off fields and waves, Where the worm and the sea-bird only know your bed, To haunt this spot where all Those eyes that wept your fall, And the hearts that wail'd you, like your own, lie dead? It is true, it is true, we are shadows cold and wan; And the fair and the brave whom we lov'd on earth are gone; But still thus ev'n in death, So sweet the living breath Of the fields and the flow'rs in our youth we wander'd o'er, That ere, condemn'd, we go To freeze 'mid Hecla's snow, We would taste it awhile, and think we live once more! O'DONOHUE'S MISTRESS. Of all the fair months, that round the sun In light-link'd dance their circles run, Sweet May, shine thou for me; For still, when thy earliest beams arise, That youth, who beneath the blue lake lies, Sweet May, returns to me. Of all the bright haunts, where daylight leaves Its lingering smile on golden eves, Fair Lake, thou'rt dearest to me; For when the last April sun grows dim, Thy Naïads prepare his steed The particulars of the tradition respecting O'Donohue and his White Horse, may be found in Mr. Weld's Account of Killarney, or more fully detailed in Derrick's Letters. For many years after his death, the spirit of this hero is supposed to have been seen on the morning of May-day, gliding over the lake on his favourite white horse, to the sound of sweet unearthly music, and preceded by groups of youths and maidens, who flung wreaths of delicate spring flowers in his path. Among other stories, connected with this Legend of the Lakes, it is said that there was a young and beautiful girl whose imagination was so impressed with the idea of this visionary chieftain, that she fancied herself in love with him, and at last, in a fit of insanity, on a May-morning threw herself into the lake. for him Who dwells, bright Lake, in thee. Of all the proud steeds, that ever bore Young plumed Chiefs on sea or shore, White Steed, most joy to thee; Who still, with the first young glance of spring, From under that glorious lake dost bring My love, my chief, to me. While, white as the sail some bark unfurls, When newly launch'd, thy long mane The boatmen at Killarney call those waves which come on a windy day, crested with foam, “O'Donohue's white horses.” curls, Fair Steed, as white and free; And spirits, from all the lake's deep bowers, Glide o'er the blue wave scattering flowers, Around my love and thee. Of all the sweet deaths that maidens die, Whose lovers beneath the cold wave lie, Most sweet that death will be, Which, under the next May evening's light, When thou and thy steed are lost to sight, Dear love, I'll die for thee. ECHO. How sweet the answer Echo makes To music at night, When, roused by lute or horn, she wakes, And far away, o'er lawns and lakes, Goes answering light. Yet Love hath echoes truer far, And far more sweet, Than e'er beneath the moonlight's star, Of horn or lute, or soft guitar, The songs repeat. 'Tis when the sigh, in youth sincere, And only then,— The sigh that's breath'd for one to hear, Is by that one, that only dear, Breathed back again! OH BANQUET NOT. Oh banquet not in those shining bowers, Where Youth resorts, but come to me: For mine's a garden of faded flowers, More fit for sorrow, for age, and thee. And there we shall have our feast of tears, And many a cup in silence pour; Our guests, the shades of former years, Our toasts, to lips that bloom no more. There, while the myrtle's withering boughs Their lifeless leaves around us shed, We'll brim the bowl to broken vows, To friends long lost, the changed, the dead. Or, while some blighted laurel waves Its branches o'er the dreary spot, We'll drink to those neglected graves, Where valour sleeps, unnamed, forgot THEE, THEE, ONLY THEE. The dawning of morn, the daylight's sinking, The night's long hours still find me thinking Of thee, thee, only thee. When friends are met, and goblets crown'd, And smiles are near, that once enchanted, Unreach'd by all that sunshine round, My soul, like some dark spot, is haunted By thee, thee, only thee. Whatever in fame's high path could waken My spirit once, is now forsaken For thee, thee, only thee. Like shores, by which some headlong bark To th' ocean hurries, resting never, Life's scenes go by me, bright or dark, I know not, heed not, hastening ever To thee, thee, only thee. I have not a joy but of thy bringing, And pain itself seems sweet when springing From thee, thee, only thee. Like spells, that nought on earth can break, Till lips, that know the charm, have spoken, This heart, howe'er the world may wake Its grief, its scorn, can but be broken By thee, thee, only thee. SHALL THE HARP THEN BE SILENT. Shall the Harp then be silent, when he who first gave To our country a name, is withdrawn from all eyes? Shall a Minstrel of Erin stand mute by the grave, Where the first—where the last of her Patriots lies? No—faint tho' the death-song may fall from his lips, Tho' his Harp, like his soul, may with shadows be crost, Yet, yet shall it sound, 'mid a nation's eclipse, And proclaim to the world what a star hath been lost These lines were written on the death of our great patriot, Grattan, in the year 1820. It is only the two first verses that are either intended or fitted to be sung.;— What a union of all the affections and powers By which life is exalted, embellish'd, refined, Was embraced in that spirit—whose centre was ours, While its mighty circumference circled mankind. Oh, who that loves Erin, or who that can see, Through the waste of her annals, that epoch sublime— Like a pyramid raised in the desert—where he And his glory stand out to the eyes of all time; That one lucid interval, snatch'd from the gloom And the madness of ages, when fill'd with his soul, A Nation o'erleap'd the dark bounds of her doom, And for one sacred instant, touch'd Liberty's goal? Who, that ever hath heard him—hath drank at the source Of that wonderful eloquence, all Erin's own, In whose high-thoughted daring, the fire, and the force, And the yet untamed spring of her spirit are shown? An eloquence rich, wheresoever its wave Wander'd free and triumphant, with thoughts that shone through, As clear as the brook's “stone of lustre,” and gave, With the flash of the gem, its solidity too. Who, that ever approach'd him, when free from the crowd, In a home full of love, he delighted to tread 'Mong the trees which a nation had giv'n, and which bow'd, As if each brought a new civic crown for his head— Is there one, who hath thus, through his orbit of life But at distance observed him—through glory, through blame, In the calm of retreat, in the grandeur of strife, Whether shining or clouded, still high and the same,— Oh no, not a heart, that e'er knew him, but mourns Deep, deep o'er the grave, where such glory is shrined— O'er a monument Fame will preserve, 'mong the urns Of the wisest, the bravest, the best of mankind! OH, THE SIGHT ENTRANCING. Oh, the sight entrancing, When morning's beam is glancing O'er files array'd With helm and blade, And plumes, in the gay wind dancing! When hearts are all high beating, And the trumpet's voice repeating That song, whose breath May lead to death, But never to retreating. Oh the sight entrancing, When morning's beam is glancing O'er files array'd With helm and blade, And plumes, in the gay wind dancing. Yet, 'tis not helm or feather— For ask yon despot, whether His plumed bands Could bring such hands And hearts as ours together. Leave pomps to those who need 'em— Give man but heart and freedom, And proud he braves The gaudiest slaves That crawl where monarchs lead 'em. The sword may pierce the beaver, Stone walls in time may sever, 'Tis mind alone, Worth steel and stone, That keeps men free for ever. Oh that sight entrancing, When the morning's beam is glancing, O'er files array'd With helm and blade, And in Freedom's cause advancing! SWEET INNISFALLEN. Sweet Innisfallen, fare thee well, May calm and sunshine long be thine! How fair thou art let others tell,— To feel how fair shall long be mine. Sweet Innisfallen, long shall dwell In memory's dream that sunny smile, Which o'er thee on that evening fell, When first I saw thy fairy isle. 'Twas light, indeed, too blest for one, Who had to turn to paths of care— Through crowded haunts again to run, And leave thee bright and silent there; No more unto thy shores to come, But, on the world's rude ocean tost, Dream of thee sometimes, as a home Of sunshine he had seen and lost. Far better in thy weeping hours To part from thee, as I do now, When mist is o'er thy blooming bowers, Like sorrow's veil on beauty's brow. For, though unrivall'd still thy grace, Thou dost not look, as then, too blest, But thus in shadow, seem'st a place Where erring man might hope to rest— Might hope to rest, and find in thee A gloom like Eden's, on the day He left its shade, when every tree, Like thine, hung weeping o'er his way. Weeping or smiling, lovely isle! And all the lovelier for thy tears— For tho' but rare thy sunny smile, 'Tis heav'n's own glance when it appears. Like feeling hearts, whose joys are few, But, when indeed they come, divine— The brightest light the sun e'er threw Is lifeless to one gleam of thine! 'TWAS ONE OF THOSE DREAMS. Written during a visit to Lord Kenmare, at Killarney. 'Twas one of those dreams, that by music are brought, Like a bright summer haze, o'er the poet's warm thought— When, lost in the future, his soul wanders on, And all of this life, but its sweetness, is gone. The wild notes he heard o'er the water were those He had taught to sing Erin's dark bondage and woes, And the breath of the bugle now wafted them o'er From Dinis' green isle, to Glenà's wooded shore. He listen'd—while, high o'er the eagle's rude nest, The lingering sounds on their way loved to rest; And the echoes sung back from their full mountain quire, As if loth to let song so enchanting expire. It seem'd as if ev'ry sweet note, that died here, Was again brought to life in some airier sphere, Some heav'n in those hills, where the soul of the strain That had ceased upon earth was awaking again! Oh forgive, if, while listening to music, whose breath Seem'd to circle his name with a charm against death, He should feel a proud Spirit within him proclaim, “Even so shalt thou live in the echoes of Fame: “Even so, tho' thy memory should now die away, “'Twill be caught up again in some happier day, “And the hearts and the voices of Erin prolong, “Through the answering Future, thy name and thy song.” FAIREST! PUT ON AWHILE. Fairest! put on awhile These pinions of light I bring thee, And o'er thy own green isle In fancy let me wing thee. Never did Ariel's plume, At golden sunset hover O'er scenes so full of bloom, As I shall waft thee over. Fields, where the Spring delays And fearlessly meets the ardour Of the warm Summer's gaze, With only her tears to guard her. Rocks, through myrtle boughs In grace majestic frowning, Like some bold warrior's brows That Love hath just been crowning. Islets, so freshly fair, That never hath bird come nigh them, But from his course thro' air He hath been won down by them In describing the Skeligs (islands of the Barony of Forth), Dr. Keating says, “There is a certain attractive virtue in the soil which draws down all the birds that attempt to fly over it, and obliges them to light upon the rock.”;— Types, sweet maid, of thee, Whose look, whose blush inviting, Never did Love yet see From Heav'n, without alighting. Lakes, where the pearl lies hid “Nennius, a British writer of the ninth century, mentions the abundance of pearls in Ireland. Their princes, he says, hung them behind their ears: and this we find confirmed by a present made A. C. 1094, by Gilbert Bishop of Limerick, to Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, of a considerable quantity of Irish pearls.” —O'Halloran., And caves, where the gem is sleeping, Bright as the tears thy lid Lets fall in lonely weeping. Glens Glengariff., where Ocean comes, To 'scape the wild wind's rancour, And Harbours, worthiest homes Where Freedom's fleet can anchor. Then, if, while scenes so grand, So beautiful, shine before thee, Pride for thy own dear land Should haply be stealing o'er thee, Oh, let grief come first, O'er pride itself victorious— Thinking how man hath curst What Heaven had made so glorious! QUICK! WE HAVE BUT A SECOND. Quick! we have but a second, Fill round the cup, while you may; For Time, the churl, hath beckon'd, And we must away, away! Grasp the pleasure that's flying, For oh, not Orpheus' strain Could keep sweet hours from dying, Or charm them to life again. Then, quick! we have but a second, Fill round the cup, while you may; For Time, the churl, hath beckon'd, And we must away, away! See the glass, how it flushes, Like some young Hebe's lip, And half meets thine, and blushes That thou shouldst delay to sip. Shame, oh shame unto thee, If ever thou see'st that day, When a cup or lip shall woo thee, And turn untouch'd away! Then, quick! we have but a second, Fill round, fill round, while you may; For Time, the churl, hath beckon'd, And we must away, away! AND DOTH NOT A MEETING LIKE THIS. And doth not a meeting like this make amends, For all the long years I've been wand'ring away— To see thus around me my youth's early friends, As smiling and kind as in that happy day? Though haply o'er some of your brows, as o'er mine, The snow-fall of time may be stealing—what then? Like Alps in the sunset, thus lighted by wine, We'll wear the gay tinge of youth's roses again. What soften'd remembrances come o'er the heart, In gazing on those we've been lost to so long! The sorrows, the joys, of which once they were part, Still round them, like visions of yesterday, throng, As letters some hand hath invisibly traced, When held to the flame will steal out on the sight, So many a feeling, that long seem'd effaced, The warmth of a moment like this brings to light. And thus, as in memory's bark we shall glide, To visit the scenes of our boyhood anew, Tho' oft we may see, looking down on the tide, The wreck of full many a hope shining through; Yet still, as in fancy we point to the flowers, That once made a garden of all the gay shore, Deceived for a moment, we'll think them still ours, And breathe the fresh air of life's morning once more. Jours charmans, quand je songe à vos heureux instans, Je pense remonter le fleuve de mes ans; Et mon cœur enchanté sur sa rive fleurie Respire encore l'air pur du matin de la vie. So brief our existence, a glimpse, at the most, Is all we can have of the few we hold dear; And oft even joy is unheeded and lost, For want of some heart, that could echo it, near. Ah, well may we hope, when this short life is gone, To meet in some world of more permanent bliss, For a smile, or a grasp of the hand, hast'ning on, Is all we enjoy of each other in this. The same thought has been happily expressed by my friend Mr. Washington Irving, in his Bracebridge Hall, vol. i. p. 213. The sincere pleasure which I feel in calling this gentleman my friend, is much enhanced by the reflection that he is too good an American, to have admitted me so readily to such a distinction, if he had not known that my feelings towards the great and free country that gave him birth, have been long such as every real lover of the liberty and happiness of the human race must entertain. But, come, the more rare such delights to the heart, The more we should welcome and bless them the more; They're ours, when we meet,—they are lost when we part, Like birds that bring summer, and fly when 'tis o'er. Thus circling the cup, hand in hand, ere we drink, Let Sympathy pledge us, thro' pleasure, thro' pain, That, fast as a feeling but touches one link, Her magic shall send it direct thro' the chain. THE MOUNTAIN SPRITE. In yonder valley there dwelt, alone, A youth, whose moments had calmly flown, Till spells came o'er him, and, day and night, He was haunted and watch'd by a Mountain Sprite. As once, by moonlight, he wander'd o'er The golden sands of that island shore, A foot-print sparkled before his sight— 'Twas the fairy foot of the Mountain Sprite! Beside a fountain, one sunny day, As bending over the stream he lay, There peep'd down o'er him two eyes of light, And he saw in that mirror the Mountain Sprite. He turn'd, but, lo, like a startled bird, That spirit fled!—and the youth but heard Sweet music, such as marks the flight Of some bird of song, from the Mountain Sprite. One night, still haunted by that bright look, The boy, bewilder'd, his pencil took, And, guided only by memory's light, Drew the once-seen form of the Mountain Sprite. “Oh thou, who lovest the shadow,” cried A voice, low whisp'ring by his side, “Now turn and see,”—here the youth's delight Seal'd the rosy lips of the Mountain Sprite. “Of all the Spirits of land and sea,” Then rapt he murmur'd, “there's none like thee, “And oft, oh oft, may thy foot thus light “In this lonely bower, sweet Mountain Sprite!” AS VANQUISH'D ERIN. As vanquish'd Erin wept beside The Boyne's ill-fated river, She saw where Discord, in the tide, Had dropp'd his loaded quiver. “Lie hid,” she cried, “ye venom'd darts, “Where mortal eye may shun you; “Lie hid—the stain of manly hearts, “That bled for me, is on you.” But vain her wish, her weeping vain,— As Time too well hath taught her— Each year the Fiend returns again, And dives into that water; And brings, triumphant, from beneath His shafts of desolation, And sends them, wing'd with worse than death, Through all her madd'ning nation. Alas for her who sits and mourns, Ev'n now, beside that river— Unwearied still the Fiend returns, And stored is still his quiver. “When will this end, ye Powers of Good?” She weeping asks for ever; But only hears, from out that flood, The Demon answer, “Never!” DESMOND'S SONG. “Thomas, the heir of the Desmond family, had accidentally been so engaged in the chase, that he was benighted near Tralee, and obliged to take shelter at the Abbey of Feal, in the house of one of his dependents, called Mac Cormac. Catherine, a beautiful daughter of his host, instantly inspired the Earl with a violent passion, which he could not subdue. He married her, and by this inferior alliance alienated his followers, whose brutal pride regarded this indulgence of his love as an unpardonable degradation of his family.” —Leland, vol. ii. By the Feal's wave benighted, No star in the skies, To thy door by Love lighted, I first saw those eyes. Some voice whisper'd o'er me, As the threshold I crost, There was ruin before me, If I loved, I was lost. Love came, and brought sorrow Too soon in his train; Yet so sweet, that to-morrow 'Twere welcome again. Though misery's full measure My portion should be, I would drain it with pleasure, If pour'd out by thee. You, who call it dishonour To bow to this flame, If you've eyes, look but on her, And blush while you blame. Hath the pearl less whiteness Because of its birth? Hath the violet less brightness For growing near earth? No—Man for his glory To ancestry flies; But Woman's bright story Is told in her eyes. While the Monarch but traces Thro' mortals his line, Beauty, born of the Graces, Ranks next to Divine! THEY KNOW NOT MY HEART. They know not my heart, who believe there can be One stain of this earth in its feelings for thee; Who think, while I see thee in beauty's young hour, As pure as the morning's first dew on the flow'r, I could harm what I love,—as the sun's wanton ray But smiles on the dew-drop to waste it away. No—beaming with light as those young features are, There's a light round thy heart which is lovelier far: It is not that cheek—'tis the soul dawning clear Thro' its innocent blush makes thy beauty so dear; As the sky we look up to, though glorious and fair, Is look'd up to the more, because Heaven lies there! I WISH I WAS BY THAT DIM LAKE. I wish I was by that dim Lake These verses are meant to allude to that ancient haunt of superstition, called Patrick's Purgatory. “In the midst of these gloomy regions of Donegall (says Dr. Campbell) lay a lake, which was to become the mystic theatre of this fabled and intermediate state. In the lake were several islands; but one of them was dignified with that called the Mouth of Purgatory, which, during the dark ages, attracted the notice of all Christendom, and was the resort of penitents and pilgrims from almost every country in Europe.” “It was,” as the same writer tells us, “one of the most dismal and dreary spots in the North, almost inaccessible, through deep glens and rugged mountains, frightful with impending rocks, and the hollow murmurs of the western winds in dark caverns, peopled only with such fantastic beings as the mind, however gay, is, from strange association, wont to appropriate to such gloomy scenes.” —Strictures on the Ecclesiastical and Literary History of Ireland., Where sinful souls their farewell take Of this vain world, and half-way lie In death's cold shadow, ere they die. There, there, far from thee, Deceitful world, my home should be; Where, come what might of gloom and pain, False hope should ne'er deceive again. The lifeless sky, the mournful sound Of unseen waters falling round; The dry leaves, quiv'ring o'er my head, Like man, unquiet ev'n when dead! These, ay, these shall wean My soul from life's deluding scene, And turn each thought, o'ercharged with gloom, Like willows, downward tow'rds the tomb. As they, who to their couch at night Would win repose, first quench the light, So must the hopes, that keep this breast Awake, be quench'd, ere it can rest. Cold, cold, this heart must grow, Unmoved by either joy or woe, Like freezing founts, where all that's thrown Within their current turns to stone. SHE SUNG OF LOVE. She sung of Love, while o'er her lyre The rosy rays of evening fell, As if to feed with their soft fire The soul within that trembling shell. The same rich light hung o'er her cheek, And play'd around those lips that sung And spoke, as flowers would sing and speak, If Love could lend their leaves a tongue. But soon the West no longer burn'd, Each rosy ray from heav'n withdrew; And, when to gaze again I turn'd, The minstrel's form seem'd fading too. As if her light and heav'n's were one, The glory all had left that frame; And from her glimmering lips the tone, As from a parting spirit, came. The thought here was suggested by some beautiful lines in Mr. Rogers's Poem of Human Life, beginning— ”Now in the glimmering, dying light she grows Less and less earthly.” I would quote the entire passage, did I not fear to put my own humble imitation of it out of countenance. Who ever loved, but had the thought That he and all he loved must part? Fill'd with this fear, I flew and caught The fading image to my heart— And cried, “Oh Love! is this thy doom? “Oh light of youth's resplendent day! “Must ye then lose your golden bloom, “And thus, like sunshine, die away?” SING—SING—MUSIC WAS GIVEN. Sing—sing—Music was given, To brighten the gay, and kindle the loving; Souls here, like planets in Heaven, By harmony's laws alone are kept moving. Beauty may boast of her eyes and her cheeks, But Love from the lips his true archery wings; And she, who but feathers the dart when she speaks, At once sends it home to the heart when she sings. Then sing—sing—Music was given, To brighten the gay, and kindle the loving; Souls here, like planets in Heaven, By harmony's laws alone are kept moving. When Love, rock'd by his mother, Lay sleeping as calm as slumber could make him, “Hush, hush,” said Venus, “no other “Sweet voice but his own is worthy to wake him.” Dreaming of music he slumber'd the while Till faint from his lip a soft melody broke, And Venus, enchanted, look'd on with a smile, While Love to his own sweet singing awoke. Then sing—sing—Music was given, To brighten the gay, and kindle the loving; Souls here, like planets in Heaven, By harmony's laws alone are kept moving. THOUGH HUMBLE THE BANQUET. Though humble the banquet to which I invite thee, Thou'lt find there the best a poor bard can command: Eyes, beaming with welcome, shall throng round, to light thee, And Love serve the feast with his own willing hand. And though Fortune may seem to have turn'd from the dwelling Of him thou regardest her favouring ray, Thou wilt find there a gift, all her treasures excelling, Which, proudly he feels, hath ennobled his way. 'Tis that freedom of mind, which no vulgar dominion Can turn from the path a pure conscience approves; Which, with hope in the heart, and no chain on the pinion, Holds upwards its course to the light which it loves. 'Tis this makes the pride of his humble retreat, And, with this, though of all other treasures bereaved, The breeze of his garden to him is more sweet Than the costliest incense that Pomp e'er received. Then, come,—if a board so untempting hath power To win thee from grandeur, its best shall be thine; And there's one, long the light of the bard's happy bower, Who, smiling, will blend her bright welcome with mine. SING, SWEET HARP. Sing, sweet Harp, oh sing to me Some song of ancient days, Whose sounds, in this sad memory, Long buried dreams shall raise;— Some lay that tells of vanish'd fame, Whose light once round us shone; Of noble pride, now turn'd to shame, And hopes for ever gone.— Sing, sad Harp, thus sing to me; Alike our doom is cast, Both lost to all but memory, We live but in the past. How mournfully the midnight air Among thy chords doth sigh, As if it sought some echo there Of voices long gone by;— Of Chieftains, now forgot, who seem'd The foremost then in fame; Of Bards who, once immortal deem'd, Now sleep without a name.— In vain, sad Harp, the midnight air Among thy chords doth sigh; In vain it seeks an echo there Of voices long gone by. Could'st thou but call those spirits round, Who once, in bower and hall, Sate listening to thy magic sound, Now mute and mouldering all;— But, no; they would but wake to weep Their children's slavery; Then leave them in their dreamless sleep, The dead, at least, are free!— Hush, hush, sad Harp, that dreary tone, That knell of Freedom's day; Or, listening to its death-like moan, Let me, too, die away. SONG OF THE BATTLE EVE. Time—the Ninth Century. To-morrow, comrade, we On the battle-plain must be, There to conquer, or both lie low! The morning star is up,— But there's wine still in the cup, And we'll take another quaff, ere we go, boy, go; We'll take another quaff, ere we go. 'Tis true, in manliest eyes A passing tear will rise, When we think of the friends we leave lone; But what can wailing do? See, our goblet's weeping too! With its tears we'll chase away our own, boy, our own; With its tears we'll chase away our own. But daylight's stealing on;— The last that o'er us shone Saw our children around us play; The next—ah! where shall we And those rosy urchins be? But—no matter—grasp thy sword and away, boy, away; No matter—grasp thy sword and away! Let those, who brook the chain Of Saxon or of Dane, Ignobly by their fire-sides stay; One sigh to home be given, One heartfelt prayer to heaven, Then, for Erin and her cause, boy, hurra! hurra! hurra! Then, for Erin and her cause, hurra! THE WANDERING BARD. What life like that of the bard can be,— The wandering bard, who roams as free As the mountain lark that o'er him sings, And, like that lark, a music brings Within him, where'er he comes or goes,— A fount that for ever flows! The world's to him like some play-ground, Where fairies dance their moonlight round;— If dimm'd the turf where late they trod, The elves but seek some greener sod; So, when less bright his scene of glee, To another away flies he! Oh, what would have been young Beauty's doom, Without a bard to fix her bloom? They tell us, in the moon's bright round, Things lost in this dark world are found; So charms, on earth long pass'd and gone, In the poet's lay live on.— Would ye have smiles that ne'er grow dim? You've only to give them all to him, Who, with but a touch of Fancy's wand, Can lend them life, this life beyond, And fix them high, in Poesy's sky,— Young stars that never die! Then, welcome the bard where'er he comes,— For, though he hath countless airy homes, To which his wing excursive roves, Yet still, from time to time, he loves To light upon earth and find such cheer As brightens our banquet here. No matter how far, how fleet he flies, You've only to light up kind young eyes, Such signal-fires as here are given,— And down he'll drop from Fancy's heaven, The minute such call to love or mirth Proclaims he's wanting on earth! ALONE IN CROWDS TO WANDER ON. Alone in crowds to wander on, And feel that all the charm is gone Which voices dear and eyes beloved Shed round us once, where'er we roved— This, this the doom must be Of all who've loved, and lived to see The few bright things they thought would stay For ever near them, die away. Tho' fairer forms around us throng. Their smiles to others all belong, And want that charm which dwells alone Round those the fond heart calls its own. Where, where the sunny brow? The long-known voice—where are they now? Thus ask I still, nor ask in vain, The silence answers all too plain. Oh, what is Fancy's magic worth, If all her art cannot call forth One bliss like those we felt of old From lips now mute, and eyes now cold? No, no,—her spell is vain,— As soon could she bring back again Those eyes themselves from out the grave, As wake again one bliss they gave. I'VE A SECRET TO TELL THEE. I've a secret to tell thee, but hush! not here,— Oh! not where the world its vigil keeps: I'll seek, to whisper it in thine ear, Some shore where the Spirit of Silence sleeps; Where summer's wave unmurmuring dies, Nor fay can hear the fountain's gush; Where, if but a note her night-bird sighs, The rose saith, chidingly, “Hush, sweet, hush!” There, amid the deep silence of that hour, When stars can be heard in ocean dip, Thyself shall, under some rosy bower, Sit mute, with thy finger on thy lip: Like him, the boy The God of Silence, thus pictured by the Egyptians., who born among The flowers that on the Nile-stream blush, Sits ever thus,—his only song To earth and heaven, “Hush, all, hush!” SONG OF INNISFAIL. They came from a land beyond the sea, And now o'er the western main Set sail, in their good ships, gallantly, From the sunny land of Spain. “Oh, where's the Isle we've seen in dreams, “Our destin'd home or grave?” “Milesius remembered the remarkable prediction of the principal Druid, who foretold that the posterity of Gadelus should obtain the possession of a Western Island (which was Ireland), and there inhabit.” —Keating. Thus sung they as, by the morning's beams, They swept the Atlantic wave. And, lo, where afar o'er ocean shines A sparkle of radiant green, As though in that deep lay emerald mines, Whose light thro' the wave was seen. “'Tis Innisfail The Island of Destiny, one of the ancient names of Ireland.—'tis Innisfail!” Rings o'er the echoing sea; While, bending to heav'n, the warriors hail That home of the brave and free. Then turn'd they unto the Eastern wave, Where now their Day-God's eye A look of such sunny omen gave As lighted up sea and sky. Nor frown was seen through sky or sea, Nor tear o'er leaf or sod, When first on their Isle of Destiny Our great forefathers trod. THE NIGHT DANCE. Strike the gay harp! see the moon is on high, And, as true to her beam as the tides of the ocean, Young hearts, when they feel the soft light of her eye, Obey the mute call, and heave into motion. Then, sound notes—the gayest, the lightest, That ever took wing, when heav'n look'd brightest! Again! Again! Oh! could such heart-stirring music be heard In that City of Statues described by romancers, So wakening its spell, even stone would be stirr'd, And statues themselves all start into dancers! Why then delay, with such sounds in our ears, And the flower of Beauty's own garden before us,— While stars overhead leave the song of their spheres, And list'ning to ours, hang wondering o'er us? Again, that strain!—to hear it thus sounding Might set even Death's cold pulses bounding— Again! Again! Oh, what delight when the youthful and gay, Each with eye like a sunbeam and foot like a feather, Thus dance, like the Hours to the music of May, And mingle sweet song and sunshine together! THERE ARE SOUNDS OF MIRTH. There are sounds of mirth in the night-air ringing, And lamps from every casement shown; While voices blithe within are singing, That seem to say “Come,” in every tone. Ah! once how light, in Life's young season, My heart had leap'd at the sweet lay: Nor paus'd to ask of greybeard Reason Should I the syren call obey. And, see—the lamps still livelier glitter, The syren lips more fondly sound; No, seek, ye nymphs, some victim fitter To sink in your rosy bondage bound. Shall a bard, whom not the world in arms Could bend to tyranny's rude controul, Thus quail, at sight of woman's charms, And yield to a smile his freeborn soul? Thus sung the sage, while, slyly stealing, The nymphs their fetters around him cast, And,—their laughing eyes, the while, concealing,— Led Freedom's Bard their slave at last. For the Poet's heart, still prone to loving, Was like that rock of the Druid race The Rocking Stones of the Druids, some of which no force is able to dislodge from their stations., Which the gentlest touch at once set moving, But all earth's power couldn't cast from its base. OH! ARRANMORE, LOVED ARRANMORE. Oh! Arranmore, loved Arranmore, How oft I dream of thee, And of those days when, by thy shore, I wander'd young and free. Full many a path I've tried, since then, Through pleasure's flowery maze, But ne'er could find the bliss again I felt in those sweet days. How blithe upon thy breezy cliffs At sunny morn I've stood, With heart as bounding as the skiffs That danced along thy flood; Or, when the western wave grew bright With daylight's parting wing, Have sought that Eden in its light Which dreaming poets sing “The inhabitants of Arranmore are still persuaded that, in a clear day, they can see from this coast Hy Brysail or the Enchanted Island, the Paradise of the Pagan Irish, and concerning which they relate a number of romantic stories.” —Beaufort's Ancient Topography of Ireland.;— That Eden where th' immortal brave Dwell in a land serene,— Whose bow'rs beyond the shining wave, At sunset, oft are seen. Ah dream too full of sadd'ning truth! Those mansions o'er the main Are like the hopes I built in youth,— As sunny and as vain! LAY HIS SWORD BY HIS SIDE. Lay his sword by his side It was the custom of the ancient Irish, in the manner of the Scythians, to bury the favourite swords of their heroes along with them.,—it hath served him too well Not to rest near his pillow below; To the last moment true, from his hand ere it fell, Its point was still turn'd to a flying foe. Fellow-lab'rers in life, let them slumber in death, Side by side, as becomes the reposing brave,— That sword which he loved still unbroke in its sheath, And himself unsubdued in his grave. Yet pause—for, in fancy, a still voice I hear, As if breathed from his brave heart's remains;— Faint echo of that which, in Slavery's ear, Once sounded the war-word, “Burst your chains!” And it cries, from the grave where the hero lies deep, “Tho' the day of your Chieftain for ever hath set, “Oh leave not his sword thus inglorious to sleep,— “It hath victory's life in it yet! “Should some alien, unworthy such weapon to wield, “Dare to touch thee, my own gallant sword, “Then rest in thy sheath, like a talisman seal'd, “Or return to the grave of thy chainless lord. “But, if grasp'd by a hand that hath learn'd the proud use “Of a falchion, like thee, on the battle-plain,— “Then, at Liberty's summons, like lightning let loose, “Leap forth from thy dark sheath again!” OH, COULD WE DO WITH THIS WORLD OF OURS. Oh, could we do with this world of ours As thou dost with thy garden bowers, Reject the weeds and keep the flowers, What a heaven on earth we'd make it! So bright a dwelling should be our own, So warranted free from sigh or frown, That angels soon would be coming down, By the week or month to take it. Like those gay flies that wing thro' air, And in themselves a lustre bear, A stock of light, still ready there, Whenever they wish to use it; So, in this world I'd make for thee, Our hearts should all like fire-flies be, And the flash of wit or poesy Break forth whenever we choose it. While ev'ry joy that glads our sphere Hath still some shadow hovering near, In this new world of ours, my dear, Such shadows will all be omitted:— Unless they're like that graceful one, Which, when thou'rt dancing in the sun, Still near thee, leaves a charm upon Each spot where it hath flitted! THE WINE-CUP IS CIRCLING. The wine-cup is circling in Almhin's hall The Palace of Fin Mac-Cumhal (the Fingal of Macpherson) in Leinster. It was built on the top of the hill, which has retained from thence the name of the Hill of Allen, in the county of Kildare. The Finians, or Fenii, were the celebrated National Militia of Ireland, which this Chief commanded. The introduction of the Danes in the above song is an anachronism common to most of the Finian and Ossianic legends., And its Chief, 'mid his heroes reclining, Looks up, with a sigh, to the trophied wall, Where his sword hangs idly shining. When, hark! that shout From the vale without,— “Arm ye quick, the Dane, the Dane is nigh!” Ev'ry Chief starts up From his foaming cup, And “To battle, to battle!” is the Finian's cry. The minstrels have seized their harps of gold, And they sing such thrilling numbers,— 'Tis like the voice of the Brave, of old, Breaking forth from their place of slumbers! Spear to buckler rang, As the minstrels sang, And the Sun-burst The name given to the banner of the Irish. o'er them floated wide; While rememb'ring the yoke Which their fathers broke, “On for liberty, for liberty!” the Finians cried. Like clouds of the night the Northmen came, O'er the valley of Almhin lowering; While onward moved, in the light of its fame, That banner of Erin, towering. With the mingling shock Rung cliff and rock, While, rank on rank, the invaders die: And the shout, that last O'er the dying pass'd, Was “victory! victory!”—the Finian's cry. THE DREAM OF THOSE DAYS. The dream of those days when first I sung thee is o'er, Thy triumph hath stain'd the charm thy sorrows then wore; And ev'n of the light which Hope once shed o'er thy chains, Alas, not a gleam to grace thy freedom remains. Say, is it that slavery sunk so deep in thy heart, That still the dark brand is there, tho' chainless thou art; And Freedom's sweet fruit, for which thy spirit long burn'd, Now, reaching at last thy lip, to ashes hath turn'd? Up Liberty's steep by Truth and Eloquence led, With eyes on her temple fix'd, how proud was thy tread! Ah, better thou ne'er had'st lived that summit to gain, Or died in the porch, than thus dishonour the fane. FROM THIS HOUR THE PLEDGE IS GIVEN. From this hour the pledge is given, From this hour my soul is thine: Come what will, from earth or heaven, Weal or woe, thy fate be mine. When the proud and great stood by thee, None dared thy rights to spurn; And if now they're false and fly thee, Shall I, too, basely turn? No;—whate'er the fires that try thee, In the same this heart shall burn. Tho' the sea, where thou embarkest, Offers now no friendly shore, Light may come where all looks darkest, Hope hath life, when life seems o'er. And, of those past ages dreaming, When glory deck'd thy brow, Oft I fondly think, though seeming So fall'n and clouded now, Thou'lt again break forth, all beaming,— None so bright, so blest as thou! SILENCE IS IN OUR FESTAL HALLS. It is hardly necessary, perhaps, to inform the reader, that these lines are meant as a tribute of sincere friendship to the memory of an old and valued colleague in this work, Sir John Stevenson. Silence is in our festal halls,— Sweet Son of Song! thy course is o'er; In vain on thee sad Erin calls, Her minstrel's voice responds no more;— All silent as th' Eolian shell Sleeps at the close of some bright day, When the sweet breeze, that waked its swell At sunny morn, hath died away. Yet, at our feasts, thy spirit long, Awaked by music's spell, shall rise; For, name so link'd with deathless song Partakes its charm and never dies: And ev'n within the holy fane, When music wafts the soul to heaven, One thought to him, whose earliest strain Was echoed there, shall long be given. But, where is now the cheerful day, The social night, when, by thy side, He, who now weaves this parting lay, His skilless voice with thine allied; And sung those songs whose every tone, When bard and minstrel long have past, Shall still, in sweetness all their own, Embalm'd by fame, undying last. Yes, Erin, thine alone the fame,— Or, if thy bard have shared the crown, From thee the borrow'd glory came, And at thy feet is now laid down. Enough, if Freedom still inspire His latest song, and still there be, As evening closes round his lyre, One ray upon its chords from thee. NATIONAL AIRS. A TEMPLE TO FRIENDSHIP. The thought is taken from a song by Le Prieur, called “La Statue de l'Amitié.” (Spanish Air.) “A Temple to Friendship,” said Laura, enchanted, “I'll build in this garden,—the thought is divine!” Her temple was built, and she now only wanted An image of Friendship to place on the shrine. She flew to a sculptor, who set down before her A Friendship, the fairest his art could invent; But so cold and so dull, that the youthful adorer Saw plainly this was not the idol she meant. “Oh! never,” she cried, “could I think of enshrining “An image, whose looks are so joyless and dim;— “But yon little god, upon roses reclining, “We'll make, if you please, Sir, a Friendship of him.” So the bargain was struck; with the little god laden She joyfully flew to her shrine in the grove: “Farewell,” said the sculptor, “you're not the first maiden “Who came but for Friendship and took away Love.” FLOW ON, THOU SHINING RIVER. (Portuguese Air.) Flow on, thou shining river; But, ere thou reach the sea, Seek Ella's bower, and give her The wreaths I fling o'er thee. And tell her thus, if she'll be mine, The current of our lives shall be, With joys along their course to shine, Like those sweet flowers on thee. But if, in wandering thither, Thou find'st she mocks my prayer, Then leave those wreaths to wither Upon the cold bank there; And tell her thus, when youth is o'er, Her lone and loveless charms shall be Thrown by upon life's weedy shore, Like those sweet flowers from thee. ALL THAT'S BRIGHT MUST FADE. (Indian Air.) All that's bright must fade,— The brightest still the fleetest; All that's sweet was made, But to be lost when sweetest. Stars that shine and fall;— The flower that drops in springing;— These, alas! are types of all To which our hearts are clinging. All that's bright must fade,— The brightest still the fleetest; All that's sweet was made But to be lost when sweetest! Who would seek or prize Delights that end in aching? Who would trust to ties That every hour are breaking? Better far to be In utter darkness lying, Than to be bless'd with light and see That light for ever flying. All that's bright must fade,— The brightest still the fleetest; All that's sweet was made But to be lost when sweetest! SO WARMLY WE MET. (Hungarian Air.) So warmly we met and so fondly we parted, That which was the sweeter ev'n I could not tell,— That first look of welcome her sunny eyes darted, Or that tear of passion, which bless'd our farewell. To meet was a heaven, and to part thus another,— Our joy and our sorrow seem'd rivals in bliss; Oh! Cupid's two eyes are not liker each other In smiles and in tears, than that moment to this. The first was like day-break, new, sudden, delicious,— The dawn of a pleasure scarce kindled up yet; The last like the farewell of daylight, more precious, More glowing and deep, as 'tis nearer its set. Our meeting, though happy, was tinged by a sorrow To think that such happiness could not remain; While our parting, though sad, gave a hope that to-morrow Would bring back the bless'd hour of meeting again. THOSE EVENING BELLS. (Air.—The Bells of St. Petersburgh.) Those evening bells! those evening bells! How many a tale their music tells, Of youth, and home, and that sweet time, When last I heard their soothing chime. Those joyous hours are past away; And many a heart, that then was gay, Within the tomb now darkly dwells, And hears no more those evening bells. And so 'twill be when I am gone; That tuneful peal will still ring on, While other bards shall walk these dells, And sing your praise, sweet evening bells! SHOULD THOSE FOND HOPES. (Portuguese Air.) Should those fond hopes e'er forsake thee This is one of the many instances among my lyrical poems, —though the above, it must be owned, is an extreme case,— where the metre has been necessarily sacrificed to the structure of the air., Which now so sweetly thy heart employ; Should the cold world come to wake thee From all thy visions of youth and joy; Should the gay friends, for whom thou wouldst banish Him who once thought thy young heart his own, All, like spring birds, falsely vanish, And leave thy winter unheeded and lone;— Oh! 'tis then that he thou hast slighted Would come to cheer thee, when all seem'd o'er; Then the truant, lost and blighted, Would to his bosom be taken once more. Like that dear bird we both can remember, Who left us while summer shone round, But, when chill'd by bleak December, On our threshold a welcome still found. REASON, FOLLY, AND BEAUTY. (Italian Air.) Reason, and Folly, and Beauty, they say, Went on a party of pleasure one day: Folly play'd Around the maid, The bells of his cap rung merrily out; While Reason took To his sermon-book— Oh! which was the pleasanter no one need doubt, Which was the pleasanter no one need doubt. Beauty, who likes to be thought very sage, Turn'd for a moment to Reason's dull page, Till Folly said, “Look here, sweet maid!”— The sight of his cap brought her back to herself; While Reason read His leaves of lead, With no one to mind him, poor sensible elf! No,—no one to mind him, poor sensible elf! Then Reason grew jealous of Folly's gay cap; Had he that on, he her heart might entrap— “There it is,” Quoth Folly, “old quiz!” (Folly was always good-natured, 'tis said,) “Under the sun “There's no such fun, “As Reason with my cap and bells on his head, “Reason with my cap and bells on his head!” But Reason the head-dress so awkwardly wore, That Beauty now liked him still less than before; While Folly took Old Reason's book, And twisted the leaves in a cap of such ton, That Beauty vow'd (Though not aloud), She liked him still better in that than his own, Yes,—liked him still better in that than his own. FARE THEE WELL, THOU LOVELY ONE! (Sicilian Air.) Fare thee well, thou lovely one! Lovely still, but dear no more; Once his soul of truth is gone, Love's sweet life is o'er. Thy words, whate'er their flatt'ring spell, Could scarce have thus deceived; But eyes that acted truth so well Were sure to be believed. Then, fare thee well, thou lovely one! Lovely still, but dear no more; Once his soul of truth is gone, Love's sweet life is o'er. Yet those eyes look constant still, True as stars they keep their light; Still those cheeks their pledge fulfil Of blushing always bright. 'Tis only on thy changeful heart The blame of falsehood lies; Love lives in every other part, But there, alas! he dies. Then, fare thee well, thou lovely one! Lovely still, but dear no more; Once his soul of truth is gone, Love's sweet life is o'er. DOST THOU REMEMBER. (Portuguese Air.) Dost thou remember that place so lonely, A place for lovers, and lovers only, Where first I told thee all my secret sighs? When, as the moonbeam, that trembled o'er thee, Illumed thy blushes, I knelt before thee, And read my hope's sweet triumph in those eyes? Then, then, while closely heart was drawn to heart, Love bound us—never, never more to part! And when I call'd thee by names the dearest The thought in this verse is borrowed from the original Portuguese words. That love could fancy, the fondest, nearest,— “My life, my only life!” among the rest; In those sweet accents that still inthral me, Thou saidst, “Ah! wherefore thy life thus call me? “Thy soul, thy soul's the name that I love best; “For life soon passes,—but how bless'd to be “That Soul which never, never parts from thee!” OH, COME TO ME WHEN DAYLIGHT SETS. (Venetian Air.) Oh, come to me when daylight sets; Sweet! then come to me, When smoothly go our gondolets O'er the moonlight sea. When Mirth's awake, and Love begins, Beneath that glancing ray, With sound of lutes and mandolins, To steal young hearts away. Then, come to me when daylight sets; Sweet! then come to me, When smoothly go our gondolets O'er the moonlight sea. Oh, then's the hour for those who love, Sweet, like thee and me; When all's so calm below, above, In Heav'n and o'er the sea. When maidens sing sweet barcarolles Barcarolles, sorte de chansons en langue Vénitienne, que chantent les gondoliers à Venise. —Rousseau, Dictionnaire de Musique., And Echo sings again So sweet, that all with ears and souls Should love and listen then. So, come to me when daylight sets; Sweet! then come to me, When smoothly go our gondolets O'er the moonlight sea. OFT, IN THE STILLY NIGHT. (Scotch Air.) Oft, in the stilly night, Ere Slumber's chain has bound me, Fond Memory brings the light Of other days around me; The smiles, the tears, Of boyhood's years, The words of love then spoken; The eyes that shone, Now dimm'd and gone, The cheerful hearts now broken! Thus, in the stilly night, Ere Slumber's chain has bound me, Sad Memory brings the light Of other days around me. When I remember all The friends, so link'd together, I've seen around me fall, Like leaves in wintry weather; I feel like one, Who treads alone Some banquet-hall deserted, Whose lights are fled, Whose garlands dead, And all but he departed! Thus, in the stilly night, Ere Slumber's chain has bound me, Sad Memory brings the light Of other days around me. HARK! THE VESPER HYMN IS STEALING. (Russian Air.) Hark! the vesper hymn is stealing O'er the waters soft and clear; Nearer yet and nearer pealing, And now bursts upon the ear: Jubilate, Amen. Farther now, now farther stealing, Soft it fades upon the ear: Jubilate, Amen. Now, like moonlight waves retreating To the shore, it dies along; Now, like angry surges meeting, Breaks the mingled tide of song: Jubilate, Amen. Hush! again, like waves, retreating To the shore, it dies along: Jubilate, Amen. LOVE AND HOPE. (Swiss Air.) At morn, beside yon summer sea, Young Hope and Love reclined; But scarce had noon-tide come, when he Into his bark leap'd smilingly, And left poor Hope behind. “I go,” said Love, “to sail awhile “Across this sunny main;” And then so sweet his parting smile, That Hope, who never dreamt of guile, Believed he'd come again. She linger'd there till evening's beam Along the waters lay; And o'er the sands, in thoughtful dream, Oft traced his name, which still the stream As often wash'd away. At length a sail appears in sight, And tow'rd the maiden moves! 'Tis Wealth that comes, and gay and bright, His golden bark reflects the light, But ah! it is not Love's. Another sail—'twas Friendship show'd Her night-lamp o'er the sea; And calm the light that lamp bestow'd; But Love had lights that warmer glow'd, And where, alas! was he? Now fast around the sea and shore Night threw her darkling chain; The sunny sails were seen no more, Hope's morning dreams of bliss were o'er,— Love never came again! THERE COMES A TIME. (German Air.) There comes a time, a dreary time, To him whose heart hath flown O'er all the fields of youth's sweet prime, And made each flower its own. 'Tis when his soul must first renounce Those dreams so bright, so fond; Oh! then's the time to die at once, For life has nought beyond. When sets the sun on Afric's shore, That instant all is night; And so should life at once be o'er, When Love withdraws his light;— Nor, like our northern day, gleam on Through twilight's dim delay, The cold remains of lustre gone, Of fire long pass'd away. MY HARP HAS ONE UNCHANGING THEME. (Swedish Air.) My harp has one unchanging theme, One strain that still comes o'er Its languid chord, as 'twere a dream Of joy that's now no more. In vain I try, with livelier air, To wake the breathing string; That voice of other times is there, And saddens all I sing. Breathe on, breathe on, thou languid strain, Henceforth be all my own; Though thou art oft so full of pain Few hearts can bear thy tone. Yet oft thou'rt sweet, as if the sigh, The breath that Pleasure's wings Gave out, when last they wanton'd by, Were still upon thy strings. OH, NO—NOT EV'N WHEN FIRST WE LOVED. (Cashmerian Air.) Oh, no—not ev'n when first we loved, Wert thou as dear as now thou art; Thy beauty then my senses moved, But now thy virtues bind my heart. What was but Passion's sigh before, Has since been turn'd to Reason's vow; And, though I then might love thee more, Trust me, I love thee better now. Although my heart in earlier youth Might kindle with more wild desire, Believe me, it has gain'd in truth Much more than it has lost in fire. The flame now warms my inmost core, That then but sparkled o'er my brow, And, though I seem'd to love thee more, Yet, oh, I love thee better now. PEACE BE AROUND THEE. (Scotch Air.) Peace be around thee, wherever thou rov'st; May life be for thee one summer's day, And all that thou wishest, and all that thou lov'st, Come smiling around thy sunny way! If sorrow e'er this calm should break, May even thy tears pass off so lightly, Like spring-showers, they'll only make The smiles that follow shine more brightly. May Time, who sheds his blight o'er all, And daily dooms some joy to death, O'er thee let years so gently fall, They shall not crush one flower beneath. As half in shade and half in sun This world along its path advances, May that side the sun's upon Be all that e'er shall meet thy glances! COMMON SENSE AND GENIUS. (French Air.) While I touch the string, Wreathe my brows with laurel, For the tale I sing Has, for once, a moral. Common Sense, one night, Though not used to gambols, Went out by moonlight, With Genius, on his rambles. While I touch the string, &amp;c. Common Sense went on, Many wise things saying; While the light that shone Soon set Genius straying. One his eye ne'er raised From the path before him; T'other idly gazed On each night-cloud o'er him. While I touch the string, &amp;c. So they came, at last, To a shady river; Common Sense soon pass'd; Safe, as he doth ever; While the boy, whose look Was in Heaven that minute, Never saw the brook, But tumbled headlong in it! While I touch the string, &amp;c. How the Wise One smiled, When safe o'er the torrent, At that youth, so wild, Dripping from the current! Sense went home to bed; Genius, left to shiver On the bank, 'tis said, Died of that cold river! While I touch the string, &amp;c. THEN, FARE THEE WELL. (Old English Air.) Then, fare thee well, my own dear love, This world has now for us No greater grief, no pain above The pain of parting thus, Dear love! The pain of parting thus. Had we but known, since first we met, Some few short hours of bliss, We might, in numbering them, forget The deep, deep pain of this, Dear love! The deep, deep pain of this. But no, alas, we've never seen One glimpse of pleasure's ray, But still there came some cloud between, And chased it all away, Dear love! And chased it all away. Yet, ev'n could those sad moments last, Far dearer to my heart Were hours of grief, together past, Than years of mirth apart, Dear love! Than years of mirth apart. Farewell! our hope was born in fears, And nursed 'mid vain regrets; Like winter suns, it rose in tears, Like them in tears it sets, Dear love! Like them in tears it sets. GAILY SOUNDS THE CASTANET. (Maltese Air.) Gaily sounds the castanet, Beating time to bounding feet, When, after daylight's golden set, Maids and youths by moonlight meet. Oh, then, how sweet to move Through all that maze of mirth, Led by light from eyes we love Beyond all eyes on earth. Then, the joyous banquet spread On the cool and fragrant ground, With heav'n's bright sparklers overhead, And still brighter sparkling round. Oh, then, how sweet to say Into some loved one's ear, Thoughts reserved through many a day To be thus whisper'd here. When the dance and feast are done, Arm in arm as home we stray, How sweet to see the dawning sun O'er her cheek's warm blushes play! Then, too, the farewell kiss— The words, whose parting tone Lingers still in dreams of bliss, That haunt young hearts alone. LOVE IS A HUNTER-BOY. (Languedocian Air.) Love is a hunter-boy, Who makes young hearts his prey; And, in his nets of joy, Ensnares them night and day. In vain conceal'd they lie— Love tracks them every where; In vain aloft they fly— Love shoots them flying there. But 'tis his joy most sweet, At early dawn to trace The print of Beauty's feet, And give the trembler chase. And if, through virgin snow, He tracks her footsteps fair, How sweet for Love to know None went before him there. COME, CHASE THAT STARTING TEAR AWAY. (French Air.) Come, chase that starting tear away, Ere mine to meet it springs; To-night, at least, to-night be gay, Whate'er to-morrow brings. Like sun-set gleams, that linger late When all is dark'ning fast, Are hours like these we snatch from Fate— The brightest, and the last. Then, chase that starting tear, &amp;c. To gild the deepening gloom, if Heaven But one bright hour allow, Oh, think that one bright hour is given, In all its splendour, now. Let's live it out—then sink in night, Like waves that from the shore One minute swell, are touch'd with light, Then lost for evermore! Come, chase that starting tear, &amp;c. JOYS OF YOUTH, HOW FLEETING! (Portuguese Air.) Whisp'rings, heard by wakeful maids, To whom the night-stars guide us; Stolen walks through moonlight shades, With those we love beside us, Hearts beating, At meeting; Tears starting, At parting; Oh, sweet youth, how soon it fades! Sweet joys of youth, how fleeting! Wand'rings far away from home, With life all new before us; Greetings warm, when home we come, From hearts whose prayers watch'd o'er us. Tears starting, At parting; Hearts beating, At meeting; Oh, sweet youth, how lost on some! To some, how bright and fleeting! HEAR ME BUT ONCE. (French Air.) Hear me but once, while o'er the grave, In which our Love lies cold and dead, I count each flatt'ring hope he gave Of joys, now lost, and charms now fled. Who could have thought the smile he wore, When first we met, would fade away? Or that a chill would e'er come o'er Those eyes so bright through many a day? Hear me but once, &amp;c. WHEN LOVE WAS A CHILD. (Swedish Air.) When Love was a child, and went idling round, 'Mong flowers, the whole summer's day, One morn in the valley a bower he found, So sweet, it allured him to stay. O'erhead, from the trees, hung a garland fair, A fountain ran darkly beneath;— 'Twas Pleasure had hung up the flow'rets there; Love knew it, and jump'd at the wreath. But Love didn't know—and, at his weak years, What urchin was likely to know?— That Sorrow had made of her own salt tears The fountain that murmur'd below. He caught at the wreath—but with too much haste, As boys when impatient will do— It fell in those waters of briny taste, And the flowers were all wet through. This garland he now wears night and day; And, though it all sunny appears With Pleasure's own light, each leaf, they say, Still tastes of the Fountain of Tears. SAY, WHAT SHALL BE OUR SPORT TO-DAY? (Sicilian Air.) Say, what shall be our sport to-day? There's nothing on earth, in sea, or air, Too bright, too high, too wild, too gay For spirits like mine to dare! 'Tis like the returning bloom Of those days, alas, gone by, When I loved, each hour—I scarce knew whom— And was bless'd—I scarce knew why. Ay—those were days when life had wings, And flew, oh, flew so wild a height, That, like the lark which sunward springs, 'Twas giddy with too much light. And, though of some plumes bereft, With that sun, too, nearly set, I've enough of light and wing still left For a few gay soarings yet. BRIGHT BE THY DREAMS. (Welsh Air.) Bright be thy dreams—may all thy weeping Turn into smiles while thou art sleeping. May those by death or seas removed, The friends, who in thy spring-time knew thee, All, thou hast ever prized or loved, In dreams come smiling to thee! There may the child, whose love lay deepest, Dearest of all, come while thou sleepest; Still as she was—no charm forgot— No lustre lost that life had given; Or, if changed, but changed to what Thou'lt find her yet in Heaven! GO, THEN—'TIS VAIN. (Sicilian Air.) Go, then—'tis vain to hover Thus round a hope that's dead; At length my dream is over; 'Twas sweet—'twas false—'tis fled! Farewell! since nought it moves thee, Such truth as mine to see— Some one, who far less loves thee, Perhaps more bless'd will be. Farewell, sweet eyes, whose brightness New life around me shed; Farewell, false heart, whose lightness Now leaves me death instead. Go, now, those charms surrender To some new lover's sigh— One who, though far less tender, May be more bless'd than I. THE CRYSTAL-HUNTERS. (Swiss Air.) O'er mountains bright With snow and light, We Crystal-Hunters speed along; While rocks and caves, And icy waves, Each instant echo to our song; And, when we meet with store of gems, We grudge not kings their diadems. O'er mountains bright With snow and light, We Crystal-Hunters speed along; While grots and caves, And icy waves, Each instant echo to our song. Not half so oft the lover dreams Of sparkles from his lady's eyes, As we of those refreshing gleams That tell where deep the crystal lies; Though, next to crystal, we too grant, That ladies' eyes may most enchant. O'er mountains bright, &amp;c. Sometimes, when on the Alpine rose The golden sunset leaves its ray, So like a gem the flow'ret glows, We thither bend our headlong way; And, though we find no treasure there, We bless the rose that shines so fair. O'er mountains bright With snow and light, We Crystal-Hunters speed along; While rocks and caves, And icy waves, Each instant echo to our song. ROW GENTLY HERE. (Venetian Air.) Row gently here, My gondolier, So softly wake the tide, That not an ear, On earth, may hear, But hers to whom we glide. Had Heaven but tongues to speak, as well As starry eyes to see, Oh, think what tales 'twould have to tell Of wand'ring youths like me! Now rest thee here, My gondolier; Hush, hush, for up I go, To climb yon light Balcony's height, While thou keep'st watch below. Ah! did we take for Heaven above But half such pains as we Take, day and night, for woman's love, What Angels we should be! OH, DAYS OF YOUTH. (French Air.) Oh, days of youth and joy, long clouded, Why thus for ever haunt my view? When in the grave your light lay shrouded, Why did not Memory die there too? Vainly doth Hope her strain now sing me, Telling of joys that yet remain— No, never more can this life bring me One joy that equals youth's sweet pain. Dim lies the way to death before me, Cold winds of Time blow round my brow; Sunshine of youth! that once fell o'er me, Where is your warmth, your glory now? 'Tis not that then no pain could sting me; 'Tis not that now no joys remain; Oh, 'tis that life no more can bring me One joy so sweet as that worst pain. WHEN FIRST THAT SMILE. (Venetian Air.) When first that smile, like sunshine, bless'd my sight, Oh what a vision then came o'er me! Long years of love, of calm and pure delight, Seem'd in that smile to pass before me. Ne'er did the peasant dream of summer skies, Of golden fruit, and harvests springing, With fonder hope than I of those sweet eyes, And of the joy their light was bringing. Where now are all those fondly-promised hours? Ah! woman's faith is like her brightness— Fading as fast as rainbows, or day-flowers, Or aught that's known for grace and lightness. Short as the Persian's prayer, at close of day, Should be each vow of Love's repeating; Quick let him worship Beauty's precious ray— Even while he kneels, that ray is fleeting! PEACE TO THE SLUMBERERS! (Catalonian Air.) Peace to the slumberers! They lie on the battle-plain, With no shroud to cover them; The dew and the summer rain Are all that weep over them. Peace to the slumberers! Vain was their bravery!— The fallen oak lies where it lay, Across the wintry river; But brave hearts, once swept away, Are gone, alas! for ever. Vain was their bravery! Woe to the conqueror! Our limbs shall lie as cold as theirs Of whom his sword bereft us, Ere we forget the deep arrears Of vengeance they have left us! Woe to the conqueror! WHEN THOU SHALT WANDER. (Sicilian Air.) When thou shalt wander by that sweet light We used to gaze on so many an eve, When love was new and hope was bright, Ere I could doubt or thou deceive— Oh, then, rememb'ring how swift went by Those hours of transport, even thou may'st sigh. Yes, proud one! even thy heart may own That love like ours was far too sweet To be, like summer garments, thrown Aside, when pass'd the summer's heat; And wish in vain to know again Such days, such nights, as bless'd thee then. WHO'LL BUY MY LOVE-KNOTS? (Portuguese Air.) Hymen, late, his love-knots selling, Call'd at many a maiden's dwelling: None could doubt, who saw or knew them, Hymen's call was welcome to them. “Who'll buy my love-knots? “Who'll buy my love-knots?” Soon as that sweet cry resounded, How his baskets were surrounded! Maids, who now first dreamt of trying These gay knots of Hymen's tying; Dames, who long had sat to watch him Passing by, but ne'er could catch him;— “Who'll buy my love-knots? “Who'll buy my love-knots?”— All at that sweet cry assembled; Some laugh'd, some blush'd, and some trembled. “Here are knots,” said Hymen, taking Some loose flowers, “of Love's own making; “Here are gold ones—you may trust 'em”— (These, of course, found ready custom). “Come, buy my love-knots! “Come, buy my love-knots! “Some are labell'd ‘Knots to tie men— “Love the maker—Bought of Hymen.’” Scarce their bargains were completed, When the nymphs all cried, “We're cheated! “See these flowers—they're drooping sadly; “This gold-knot, too, ties but badly— “Who'd buy such love-knots? “Who'd buy such love-knots? “Even this tie, with Love's name round it— “All a sham—He never bound it.” Love, who saw the whole proceeding, Would have laugh'd, but for good breeding; While Old Hymen, who was used to Cries like that these dames gave loose to— “Take back our love-knots! “Take back our love-knots!” Coolly said, “There's no returning “Wares on Hymen's hands—Good morning!” SEE, THE DAWN FROM HEAVEN. (To an Air sung at Rome, on Christmas Eve.) See, the dawn from Heaven is breaking O'er our sight, And Earth, from sin awaking, Hails the light! See those groups of angels, winging From the realms above, On their brows, from Eden, bringing Wreaths of Hope and Love. Hark, their hymns of glory pealing Through the air, To mortal ears revealing Who lies there! In that dwelling, dark and lowly, Sleeps the Heavenly Son, He, whose home's above,—the Holy, Ever Holy One! NETS AND CAGES. Suggested by the following remark of Swift's:—“The reason why so few marriages are happy, is, because young ladies spend their time in making nets, not in making cages.” (Swedish Air.) Come, listen to my story, while Your needle's task you ply; At what I sing some maids will smile, While some, perhaps, may sigh. Though Love's the theme, and Wisdom blames Such florid songs as ours, Yet Truth sometimes, like eastern dames, Can speak her thoughts by flowers. Then listen, maids, come listen, while Your needle's task you ply; At what I sing there's some may smile, While some, perhaps, will sigh. Young Cloe, bent on catching Loves, Such nets had learn'd to frame, That none, in all our vales and groves, E'er caught so much small game: But gentle Sue, less giv'n to roam, While Cloe's nets were taking Such lots of Loves, sat still at home, One little Love-cage making. Come, listen, maids, &amp;c. Much Cloe laugh'd at Susan's task; But mark how things went on: These light-caught Loves, ere you could ask Their name and age, were gone! So weak poor Cloe's nets were wove, That, though she charm'd into them New game each hour, the youngest Love Was able to break through them. Come, listen, maids, &amp;c. Meanwhile, young Sue, whose cage was wrought Of bars too strong to sever, One Love with golden pinions caught, And caged him there for ever; Instructing, thereby, all coquettes, Whate'er their looks or ages, That, though 'tis pleasant weaving Nets, 'Tis wiser to make Cages. Thus, maidens, thus do I beguile The task your fingers ply.— May all who hear like Susan smile, And not, like Cloe, sigh! WHEN THROUGH THE PIAZZETTA. (Venetian Air.) When through the Piazzetta Night breathes her cool air, Then, dearest Ninetta, I'll come to thee there. Beneath thy mask shrouded, I'll know thee afar, As Love knows, though clouded, His own Evening Star. In garb, then, resembling Some gay gondolier, I'll whisper thee, trembling, “Our bark, love, is near: “Now, now, while there hover “Those clouds o'er the moon, “'Twill waft thee safe over “Yon silent Lagoon.” GO, NOW, AND DREAM. (Sicilian Air.) Go, now, and dream o'er that joy in thy slumber— Moments so sweet again ne'er shalt thou number. Of Pain's bitter draught the flavour ne'er flies, While Pleasure's scarce touches the lip ere it dies. Go, then, and dream, &amp;c. That moon, which hung o'er your parting, so splendid, Often will shine again, bright as she then did— But, never more will the beam she saw burn In those happy eyes, at your meeting, return. Go, then, and dream, &amp;c. TAKE HENCE THE BOWL. (Neapolitan Air.) Take hence the bowl;—though beaming Brightly as bowl e'er shone, Oh, it but sets me dreaming Of happy days now gone. There, in its clear reflection, As in a wizard's glass, Lost hopes and dead affection, Like shades, before me pass. Each cup I drain brings hither Some scene of bliss gone by;— Bright lips, too bright to wither, Warm hearts, too warm to die. Till, as the dream comes o'er me Of those long vanish'd years, Alas, the wine before me Seems turning all to tears! FAREWELL, THERESA! (Venetian Air.) Farewell, Theresa! yon cloud that over Heaven's pale night-star gath'ring we see, Will scarce from that pure orb have pass'd, ere thy lover Swift o'er the wide wave shall wander from thee. Long, like that dim cloud, I've hung around thee, Dark'ning thy prospects, sadd'ning thy brow; With gay heart, Theresa, and bright cheek I found thee; Oh, think how changed, love, how changed art thou now! But here I free thee: like one awaking From fearful slumber, thou break'st the spell; 'Tis over—the moon, too, her bondage is breaking— Past are the dark clouds; Theresa, farewell! HOW OFT, WHEN WATCHING STARS. (Savoyard Air.) Oft, when the watching stars grow pale, And round me sleeps the moonlight scene, To hear a flute through yonder vale I from my casement lean. “Come, come, my love!” each note then seems to say, “Oh, come, my love! the night wears fast away!” Never to mortal ear Could words, though warm they be, Speak Passion's language half so clear As do those notes to me! Then quick my own light lute I seek, And strike the chords with loudest swell; And, though they nought to others speak, He knows their language well. “I come, my love!” each note then seems to say, “I come, my love!—thine, thine till break of day.” Oh, weak the power of words, The hues of painting dim, Compared to what those simple chords Then say and paint to him! WHEN THE FIRST SUMMER BEE. (German Air.) When the first summer bee O'er the young rose shall hover, Then, like that gay rover, I'll come to thee. He to flowers, I to lips, full of sweets to the brim— What a meeting, what a meeting for me and for him! When the first summer bee, &amp;c. Then, to every bright tree In the garden he'll wander; While I, oh, much fonder, Will stay with thee. In search of new sweetness through thousands he'll run, While I find the sweetness of thousands in one. Then, to every bright tree, &amp;c. THOUGH 'TIS ALL BUT A DREAM. (French Air.) Though 'tis all but a dream at the best, And still, when happiest, soonest o'er, Yet, even in a dream, to be bless'd Is so sweet, that I ask for no more. The bosom that opes With earliest hopes, The soonest finds those hopes untrue; As flowers that first In spring-time burst The earliest wither too! Ay—'tis all but a dream, &amp;c. Though by friendship we oft are deceived, And find love's sunshine soon o'ercast, Yet friendship will still be believed, And love trusted on to the last. The web 'mong the leaves The spider weaves Is like the charm Hope hangs o'er men; Though often she sees 'Tis broke by the breeze, She spins the bright tissue again. Ay—'tis all but a dream, &amp;c. WHEN THE WINE-CUP IS SMILING. (Italian Air.) When the wine-cup is smiling before us, And we pledge round to hearts that are true, boy, true, Then the sky of this life opens o'er us, And Heaven gives a glimpse of its blue. Talk of Adam in Eden reclining, We are better, far better off thus, boy, thus; For him but two bright eyes were shining— See, what numbers are sparkling for us! When on one side the grape-juice is dancing, While on t'other a blue eye beams, boy, beams, 'Tis enough, 'twixt the wine and the glancing, To disturb ev'n a saint from his dreams. Yet, though life like a river is flowing, I care not how fast it goes on, boy, on, So the grape on its bank is still growing, And Love lights the waves as they run. WHERE SHALL WE BURY OUR SHAME? (Neapolitan Air.) Where shall we bury our shame? Where, in what desolate place, Hide the last wreck of a name Broken and stain'd by disgrace? Death may dissever the chain, Oppression will cease when we're gone; But the dishonour, the stain, Die as we may, will live on. Was it for this we sent out Liberty's cry from our shore? Was it for this that her shout Thrill'd to the world's very core? Thus to live cowards and slaves!— Oh, ye free hearts that lie dead, Do you not, ev'n in your graves, Shudder, as o'er you we tread? NE'ER TALK OF WISDOM'S GLOOMY SCHOOLS. (Mahratta Air.) Ne'er talk of Wisdom's gloomy schools; Give me the sage who's able To draw his moral thoughts and rules From the study of the table;— Who learns how lightly, fleetly pass This world and all that's in it, From the bumper that but crowns his glass, And is gone again next minute! The diamond sleeps within the mine, The pearl beneath the water; While Truth, more precious, dwells in wine, The grape's own rosy daughter. And none can prize her charms like him, Oh, none like him obtain her, Who thus can, like Leander, swim Through sparkling floods to gain her! HERE SLEEPS THE BARD. (Highland Air.) Here sleeps the Bard who knew so well All the sweet windings of Apollo's shell; Whether its music roll'd like torrents near, Or died, like distant streamlets, on the ear. Sleep, sleep, mute bard; alike unheeded now The storm and zephyr sweep thy lifeless brow;— That storm, whose rush is like thy martial lay; That breeze which, like thy love-song, dies away! DO NOT SAY THAT LIFE IS WANING. Do not say that life is waning, Or that hope's sweet day is set; While I've thee and love remaining, Life is in th' horizon yet. Do not think those charms are flying, Though thy roses fade and fall; Beauty hath a grace undying, Which in thee survives them all. Not for charms, the newest, brightest, That on other cheeks may shine, Would I change the least, the slightest, That is ling'ring now o'er thine. THE GAZELLE. Dost thou not hear the silver bell, Thro' yonder lime-trees ringing? 'Tis my lady's light gazelle, To me her love thoughts bringing,— All the while that silver bell Around his dark neck ringing. See, in his mouth he bears a wreath, My love hath kist in tying; Oh, what tender thoughts beneath Those silent flowers are lying,— Hid within the mystic wreath, My love hath kist in tying! Welcome, dear gazelle, to thee, And joy to her, the fairest, Who thus hath breathed her soul to me, In every leaf thou bearest; Welcome, dear gazelle, to thee, And joy to her the fairest! Hail ye living, speaking flowers, That breathe of her who bound ye; Oh, 'twas not in fields, or bowers, 'Twas on her lips, she found ye;— Yes, ye blushing, speaking flowers, 'Twas on her lips she found ye. NO—LEAVE MY HEART TO REST. No—leave my heart to rest, if rest it may, When youth, and love, and hope, have pass'd away. Could'st thou, when summer hours are fled, To some poor leaf that's fall'n and dead, Bring back the hue it wore, the scent it shed? No—leave this heart to rest, if rest it may, When youth, and love, and hope, have pass'd away. Oh, had I met thee then, when life was bright, Thy smile might still have fed its tranquil light; But now thou com'st like sunny skies, Too late to cheer the seaman's eyes, When wreck'd and lost his bark before him lies! No—leave this heart to rest, if rest it may, Since youth, and love, and hope, have pass'd away WHERE ARE THE VISIONS. “Where are the visions that round me once hover'd, “Forms that shed grace from their shadows alone; “Looks fresh as light from a star just discovered, “And voices that Music might take for her own?” Time, while I spoke, with his wings resting o'er me, Heard me say, “Where are those visions, oh where?” And pointing his wand to the sunset before me, Said, with a voice like the hollow wind, “There.” Fondly I looked, when the wizard had spoken, And there, mid the dim-shining ruins of day, Saw, by their light, like a talisman broken, The last golden fragments of hope melt away. WIND THY HORN, MY HUNTER BOY. Wind thy horn, my hunter boy, And leave thy lute's inglorious sighs; Hunting is the hero's joy, Till war his nobler game supplies. Hark! the hound-bells ringing sweet, While hunters shout, and the woods repeat, Hilli-ho! Hilli-ho! Wind again thy cheerful horn, Till echo, faint with answering, dies: Burn, bright torches, burn till morn, And lead us where the wild boar lies. Hark! the cry, “He's found, he's found,” While hill and valley our shouts resound, Hilli-ho! Hilli-ho! OH, GUARD OUR AFFECTION. Oh, guard our affection, nor e'er let it feel The blight that this world o'er the warmest will steal: While the faith of all round us is fading or past, Let ours, ever green, keep its bloom to the last. Far safer for Love 'tis to wake and to weep, As he used in his prime, than go smiling to sleep; For death on his slumber, cold death follows fast, While the love that is wakeful lives on to the last. And tho', as Time gathers his clouds o'er our head, A shade somewhat darker o'er life they may spread, Transparent, at least, be the shadow they cast, So that Love's soften'd light may shine through to the last. SLUMBER, OH SLUMBER. “Slumber, oh slumber; if sleeping thou mak'st “My heart beat so wildly, I'm lost if thou wak'st.” Thus sung I to a maiden, Who slept one summer's day, And, like a flower o'erladen With too much sunshine, lay. Slumber, oh slumber, &amp;c. “Breathe not, oh breathe not, ye winds, o'er her cheeks; “If mute thus she charm me, I'm lost when she speaks.” Thus sing I, while, awaking, She murmurs words that seem As if her lips were taking Farewell of some sweet dream. Breathe not, oh breathe not, &amp;c. BRING THE BRIGHT GARLANDS HITHER. Bring the bright garlands hither, Ere yet a leaf is dying; If so soon they must wither, Ours be their last sweet sighing. Hark, that low dismal chime! 'Tis the dreary voice of Time. Oh, bring beauty, bring roses, Bring all that yet is ours; Let life's day, as it closes, Shine to the last thro' flowers. Haste, ere the bowl's declining, Drink of it now or never; Now, while Beauty is shining, Love, or she's lost for ever. Hark! again that dull chime, 'Tis the dreary voice of Time. Oh, if life be a torrent, Down to oblivion going, Like this cup be its current, Bright to the last drop flowing! IF IN LOVING, SINGING. If in loving, singing, night and day We could trifle merrily life away, Like atoms dancing in the beam, Like day-flies skimming o'er the stream, Or summer blossoms, born to sigh Their sweetness out, and die— How brilliant, thoughtless, side by side, Thou and I could make our minutes glide! No atoms ever glanced so bright, No day-flies ever danced so light, Nor summer blossoms mix'd their sigh, So close, as thou and I! THOU LOV'ST NO MORE. Too plain, alas, my doom is spoken, Nor canst thou veil the sad truth o'er; Thy heart is changed, thy vow is broken, Thou lov'st no more—thou lov'st no more. Tho' kindly still those eyes behold me, The smile is gone, which once they wore; Tho' fondly still those arms enfold me, 'Tis not the same—thou lov'st no more. Too long my dream of bliss believing, I've thought thee all thou wert before; But now—alas! there's no deceiving, 'Tis all too plain, thou lov'st no more. Oh, thou as soon the dead couldst waken, As lost affection's life restore, Give peace to her that is forsaken, Or bring back him who loves no more. WHEN ABROAD IN THE WORLD. When abroad in the world thou appearest, And the young and the lovely are there, To my heart while of all thou'rt the dearest, To my eyes thou'rt of all the most fair. They pass, one by one, Like waves of the sea, That say to the Sun, “See, how fair we can be.” But where's the light like thine, In sun or shade to shine? No—no, 'mong them all, there is nothing like thee, Nothing like thee. Oft, of old, without farewell or warning, Beauty's self used to steal from the skies; Fling a mist round her head, some fine morning, And post down to earth in disguise; But, no matter what shroud Around her might be, Men peep'd through the cloud, And whisper'd, “'Tis She.” So thou, where thousands are, Shin'st forth the only star,— Yes, yes, 'mong them all, there is nothing like thee, Nothing like thee. KEEP THOSE EYES STILL PURELY MINE. Keep those eyes still purely mine, Tho' far off I be: When on others most they shine, Then think they're turn'd on me. Should those lips as now respond To sweet minstrelsy, When their accents seem most fond, Then think they're breathed for me. Make what hearts thou wilt thy own, If when all on thee Fix their charmed thoughts alone, Thou think'st the while on me. HOPE COMES AGAIN. Hope comes again, to this heart long a stranger, Once more she sings me her flattering strain; But hush, gentle syren—for, ah, there's less danger In still suff'ring on, than in hoping again. Long, long, in sorrow, too deep for repining, Gloomy, but tranquil, this bosom hath lain; And joy coming now, like a sudden light shining O'er eyelids long darken'd, would bring me but pain. Fly then, ye visions, that Hope would shed o'er me; Lost to the future, my sole chance of rest Now lies not in dreaming of bliss that's before me, But, ah—in forgetting how once I was blest. O SAY, THOU BEST AND BRIGHTEST. O say, thou best and brightest, My first love and my last, When he, whom now thou slightest, From life's dark scene hath past, Will kinder thoughts then move thee? Will pity wake one thrill For him who lived to love thee, And dying loved thee still? If when, that hour recalling From which he dates his woes, Thou feel'st a tear-drop falling, Ah, blush not while it flows: But, all the past forgiving, Bend gently o'er his shrine, And say, “This heart, when living, “With all its faults, was mine.” WHEN NIGHT BRINGS THE HOUR. When night brings the hour Of starlight and joy, There comes to my bower A fairy-wing'd boy; With eyes so bright, So full of wild arts, Like nets of light, To tangle young hearts; With lips, in whose keeping Love's secret may dwell, Like Zephyr asleep in Some rosy sea-shell. Guess who he is, Name but his name, And his best kiss, For reward, you may claim. Where'er o'er the ground He prints his light feet, The flow'rs there are found Most shining and sweet: His looks, as soft As lightning in May, Though dangerous oft, Ne'er wound but in play: And oh, when his wings Have brush'd o'er my lyre, You'd fancy its strings Were turning to fire. Guess who he is, Name but his name, And his best kiss, For reward, you may claim. LIKE ONE WHO, DOOM'D. Like one who, doom'd o'er distant seas His weary path to measure, When home at length, with fav'ring breeze, He brings the far-sought treasure; His ship, in sight of shore, goes down, That shore to which he hasted; And all the wealth he thought his own Is o'er the waters wasted! Like him, this heart, thro' many a track Of toil and sorrow straying, One hope alone brought fondly back, Its toil and grief repaying. Like him, alas, I see that ray Of hope before me perish, And one dark minute sweep away What years were given to cherish. FEAR NOT THAT, WHILE AROUND THEE. Fear not that, while around thee Life's varied blessings pour, One sigh of hers shall wound thee, Whose smile thou seek'st no more. No, dead and cold for ever Let our past love remain; Once gone, its spirit never Shall haunt thy rest again. May the new ties that bind thee Far sweeter, happier prove, Nor e'er of me remind thee, But by their truth and love. Think how, asleep or waking, Thy image haunts me yet; But, how this heart is breaking For thy own peace forget. WHEN LOVE IS KIND. When Love is kind, Cheerful and free, Love's sure to find Welcome from me. But when Love brings Heartache or pang, Tears, and such things— Love may go hang! If Love can sigh For one alone, Well pleased am I To be that one. But should I see Love giv'n to rove To two or three, Then—good-by Love! Love must, in short, Keep fond and true, Through good report, And evil too. Else, here I swear, Young Love may go, For aught I care— To Jericho. THE GARLAND I SEND THEE. The Garland I send thee was cull'd from those bowers Where thou and I wander'd in long vanish'd hours; Not a leaf or a blossom its bloom here displays, But bears some remembrance of those happy days. The roses were gathered by that garden gate, Where our meetings, tho' early, seemed always too late; Where ling'ring full oft through a summer-night's moon, Our partings, tho' late, appeared always too soon. The rest were all cull'd from the banks of that glade, Where, watching the sunset, so often we've stray'd, And mourn'd, as the time went, that Love had no power To bind in his chain even one happy hour. HOW SHALL I WOO? If I speak to thee in friendship's name, Thou think'st I speak too coldly; If I mention Love's devoted flame, Thou say'st I speak too boldly. Between these two unequal fires, Why doom me thus to hover? I'm a friend, if such thy heart requires, If more thou seek'st, a lover. Which shall it be? How shall I woo? Fair one, choose between the two. Tho' the wings of Love will brightly play, When first he comes to woo thee, There's a chance that he may fly away As fast as he flies to thee. While Friendship, tho' on foot she come, No flights of fancy trying, Will, therefore, oft be found at home, When Love abroad is flying. Which shall it be? How shall I woo? Dear one, choose between the two. If neither feeling suits thy heart, Let's see, to please thee, whether We may not learn some precious art To mix their charms together; One feeling, still more sweet, to form From two so sweet already— A friendship that like love is warm, A love like friendship steady. Thus let it be, thus let me woo, Dearest, thus we'll join the two. SPRING AND AUTUMN. Every season hath its pleasures; Spring may boast her flowery prime, Yet the vineyard's ruby treasures Brighten Autumn's sob'rer time. So Life's year begins and closes; Days, tho' short'ning, still can shine; What tho' youth gave love and roses, Age still leaves us friends and wine. Phillis, when she might have caught me, All the Spring looked coy and shy, Yet herself in Autumn sought me, When the flowers were all gone by. Ah, too late;—she found her lover Calm and free beneath his vine, Drinking to the Spring-time over, In his best autumnal wine. Thus may we, as years are flying, To their flight our pleasures suit, Nor regret the blossoms dying, While we still may taste the fruit. Oh, while days like this are ours, Where's the lip that dares repine? Spring may take our loves and flow'rs, So Autumn leaves us friends and wine. LOVE ALONE. If thou would'st have thy charms enchant our eyes, First win our hearts, for there thy empire lies: Beauty in vain would mount a heartless throne, Her Right Divine is given by Love alone. What would the rose with all her pride be worth, Were there no sun to call her brightness forth? Maidens, unloved, like flowers in darkness thrown, Wait but that light, which comes from Love alone. Fair as thy charms in yonder glass appear, Trust not their bloom, they'll fade from year to year: Would'st thou they still should shine as first they shone, Go, fix thy mirror in Love's eyes alone. SACRED SONGS. TO EDWARD TUITE DALTON. ESQ. THIS FIRST NUMBER OF SACRED SONGS IS INSCRIBED, BY HIS SINCERE AND AFFECTIONATE FRIEND, THOMAS MOORE.Mayfield Cottage, Ashbourne, May, 1816. THOU ART, O GOD. (Air.—Unknown. I have heard that this air is by the late Mrs. Sheridan. It is sung to the beautiful old words, “I do confess thou'rt smooth and fair.”) “The day is thine; the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun. “Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.” —Psalm lxxxiv. 16, 17. Thou art, O God, the life and light Of all this wondrous world we see; Its glow by day, its smile by night, Are but reflections caught from Thee. Where'er we turn, thy glories shine, And all things fair and bright are Thine! When Day, with farewell beam, delays Among the opening clouds of Even, And we can almost think we gaze Through golden vistas into Heaven— Those hues, that make the Sun's decline So soft, so radiant, Lord! are Thine. When Night, with wings of starry gloom, O'ershadows all the earth and skies, Like some dark, beauteous bird, whose plume Is sparkling with unnumber'd eyes— That sacred gloom, those fires divine, So grand, so countless, Lord! are Thine. When youthful Spring around us breathes, Thy Spirit warms her fragrant sigh; And every flower the Summer wreathes Is born beneath that kindling eye. Where'er we turn, thy glories shine, And all things fair and bright are Thine. THE BIRD, LET LOOSE. (Air.—Beethoven.) The bird, let loose in eastern skies The carrier-pigeon, it is well known, flies at an elevated pitch, in order to surmount every obstacle between her and the place to which she is destined., When hastening fondly home, Ne'er stoops to earth her wing, nor flies Where idle warblers roam. But high she shoots through air and light, Above all low delay, Where nothing earthly bounds her flight, Nor shadow dims her way. So grant me, God, from every care And stain of passion free, Aloft, through Virtue's purer air, To hold my course to Thee! No sin to cloud, no lure to stay My Soul, as home she springs;— Thy Sunshine on her joyful way, Thy Freedom in her wings! FALLEN IS THY THRONE. (Air.—Martini.) Fall'n is thy Throne, oh Israel! Silence is o'er thy plains; Thy dwellings all lie desolate, Thy children weep in chains. Where are the dews that fed thee On Etham's barren shore? That fire from Heaven which led thee, Now lights thy path no more. Lord! thou didst love Jerusalem— Once she was all thy own; Her love thy fairest heritage “I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly-beloved of my soul into the hands of her enemies.” —Jeremiah, xii. 7., Her power thy glory's throne “Do not disgrace the throne of thy glory.” —Jer. xiv. 21. IV.. Till evil came, and blighted Thy long-lov'd olive-tree “The Lord called thy name a green olive-tree; fair and of goodly fruit,” &amp;c. —Jer. xi. 16.;— And Salem's shrines were lighted For other gods than Thee. Then sunk the star of Solyma— Then pass'd her glory's day, Like heath that, in the wilderness “For he shall be like the heath in the desert.” —Jer. xvii. 6., The wild wind whirls away. Silent and waste her bowers, Where once the mighty trod, And sunk those guilty towers, While Baal reign'd as God. “Go”—said the Lord—“Ye Conquerors! “Steep in her blood your swords, “And raze to earth her battlements “Take away her battlements; for they are not the Lord's.” —Jer. v. 10., “For they are not the Lord's. “Till Zion's mournful daughter “O'er kindred bones shall tread, “And Hinnom's vale of slaughter “Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter; for they shall bury in Tophet till there be no place.” —Jer vii. 32. “Shall hide but half her dead!” WHO IS THE MAID? ST. JEROME'S LOVE. These lines were suggested by a passage in one of St. Jerome's Letters, replying to some calumnious remarks that had been circulated respecting his intimacy with the matron Paula:—“Numquid me vestes sericæ, nitentes gemmæ, picta facies, aut auri rapuit ambitio? Nulla fuit alia Romæ matronarum, quæ meam possit edomare mentem, nisi lugens atque jejunans, fletu pene cæcata.” —Epist. “Si tibi putem.” (Air.—Beethoven.) Who is the Maid my spirit seeks, Through cold reproof and slander's blight? Has she Love's roses on her cheeks? Is hers an eye of this world's light? No—wan and sunk with midnight prayer Are the pale looks of her I love; Or if, at times, a light be there, Its beam is kindled from above. I chose not her, my heart's elect, From those who seek their Maker's shrine In gems and garlands proudly deck'd, As if themselves were things divine. No—Heaven but faintly warms the breast That beats beneath a broider'd veil; And she who comes in glittering vest To mourn her frailty, still is frail. ?? ??? ??????????? ??? ?????????? ???. —Chrysost. Homil. 8. in Epist. ad Tim. Not so the faded form I prize And love, because its bloom is gone; The glory in those sainted eyes Is all the grace her brow puts on. And ne'er was Beauty's dawn so bright, So touching as that form's decay, Which, like the altar's trembling light, In holy lustre wastes away. THIS WORLD IS ALL A FLEETING SHOW. (Air.—Stevenson.) This world is all a fleeting show, For man's illusion given; The smiles of Joy, the tears of Woe, Deceitful shine, deceitful flow— There's nothing true but Heaven! And false the light on Glory's plume, As fading hues of Even; And Love and Hope, and Beauty's bloom, Are blossoms gather'd for the tomb— There's nothing bright but Heaven! Poor wanderers of a stormy day, From wave to wave we're driven, And Fancy's flash, and Reason's ray, Serve but to light the troubled way— There's nothing calm but Heaven! OH THOU WHO DRY'ST THE MOURNER'S TEAR. (Air.—Haydn.) “He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.” —Psalm cxlvii. 3. Oh Thou who dry'st the mourner's tear, How dark this world would be, If, when deceived and wounded here, We could not fly to Thee. The friends who in our sunshine live, When winter comes, are flown; And he who has but tears to give, Must weep those tears alone. But Thou wilt heal that broken heart, Which, like the plants that throw Their fragrance from the wounded part, Breathes sweetness out of woe. When joy no longer soothes or cheers, And even the hope that threw A moment's sparkle o'er our tears, Is dimm'd and vanish'd too, Oh, who would bear life's stormy doom, Did not thy Wing of Love Come, brightly wafting through the gloom Our Peace-branch from above? Then sorrow, touch'd by Thee, grows bright With more than rapture's ray; As darkness shows us worlds of light We never saw by day! WEEP NOT FOR THOSE. (Air.—Avison.) Weep not for those whom the veil of the tomb, In life's happy morning, hath hid from our eyes, Ere sin threw a blight o'er the spirit's young bloom, Or earth had profaned what was born for the skies. Death chill'd the fair fountain, ere sorrow had stain'd it; 'Twas frozen in all the pure light of its course, And but sleeps till the sunshine of Heaven has unchain'd it, To water that Eden where first was its source. Weep not for those whom the veil of the tomb, In life's happy morning, hath hid from our eyes, Ere sin threw a blight o'er the spirit's young bloom, Or earth had profaned what was born for the skies. Mourn not for her, the young Bride of the Vale This second verse, which I wrote long after the first, alludes to the fate of a very lovely and amiable girl, the daughter of the late Colonel Bainbrigge, who was married in Ashbourne church, October 31. 1815, and died of a fever in a few weeks after: the sound of her marriage-bells seemed scarcely out of our ears when we heard of her death. During her last delirium she sung several hymns, in a voice even clearer and sweeter than usual, and among them were some from the present collection, (particularly, “There's nothing bright but Heaven,”) which this very interesting girl had often heard me sing during the summer., Our gayest and loveliest, lost to us now, Ere life's early lustre had time to grow pale, And the garland of Love was yet fresh on her brow. Oh, then was her moment, dear spirit, for flying From this gloomy world, while its gloom was unknown— And the wild hymns she warbled so sweetly, in dying, Were echoed in Heaven by lips like her own. Weep not for her—in her spring-time she flew To that land where the wings of the soul are unfurl'd; And now, like a star beyond evening's cold dew, Looks radiantly down on the tears of this world. THE TURF SHALL BE MY FRAGRANT SHRINE. (Air.—Stevenson.) The turf shall be my fragrant shrine; My temple, Lord! that Arch of thine; My censer's breath the mountain airs, And silent thoughts my only prayers. Pii orant tacite. My choir shall be the moonlight waves, When murmuring homeward to their caves, Or when the stillness of the sea, Even more than music, breathes of Thee! I'll seek, by day, some glade unknown, All light and silence, like thy Throne; And the pale stars shall be, at night, The only eyes that watch my rite. Thy Heaven, on which 'tis bliss to look, Shall be my pure and shining book, Where I shall read, in words of flame, The glories of thy wondrous name. I'll read thy anger in the rack That clouds awhile the day-beam's track; Thy mercy in the azure hue Of sunny brightness, breaking through. There's nothing bright, above, below, From flowers that bloom to stars that glow, But in its light my soul can see Some feature of thy Deity: There's nothing dark, below, above, But in its gloom I trace thy Love, And meekly wait that moment, when Thy touch shall turn all bright again! SOUND THE LOUD TIMBREL. MIRIAM'S SONG. (Air.—Avison. I have so much altered the character of this air, which is from the beginning of one of Avison's old-fashioned concertos, that, without this acknowledgment, it could hardly, I think, be recognized.) “And Miriam, the Prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her, with timbrels and with dances.” —Exod xv 20. Sound the loud Timbrel o'er Egypt's dark sea! Jehovah has triumph'd—his people are free. Sing—for the pride of the Tyrant is broken, His chariots, his horsemen, all splendid and brave— How vain was their boast, for the Lord hath but spoken, And chariots and horsemen are sunk in the wave. Sound the loud Timbrel o'er Egypt's dark sea; Jehovah has triumph'd—his people are free. Praise to the Conqueror, praise to the Lord! His word was our arrow, his breath was our sword.— Who shall return to tell Egypt the story Of those she sent forth in the hour of her pride? For the Lord hath look'd out from his pillar of glory “And it came to pass, that, in the morning watch, the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians, through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians.” —Exod. xiv. 24., And all her brave thousands are dash'd in the tide. Sound the loud Timbrel o'er Egypt's dark sea, Jehovah has triumph'd—his people are free! GO, LET ME WEEP. (Air.—Stevenson.) Go, let me weep—there's bliss in tears, When he who sheds them inly feels Some lingering stain of early years Effaced by every drop that steals. The fruitless showers of worldly woe Fall dark to earth and never rise; While tears that from repentance flow, In bright exhalement reach the skies. Go, let me weep. Leave me to sigh o'er hours that flew More idly than the summer's wind, And, while they pass'd, a fragrance threw, But left no trace of sweets behind.— The warmest sigh that pleasure heaves Is cold, is faint to those that swell The heart, where pure repentance grieves O'er hours of pleasure, loved too well. Leave me to sigh. COME NOT, OH LORD. (Air.—Haydn.) Come not, oh Lord, in the dread robe of splendour Thou wor'st on the Mount, in the day of thine ire; Come veil'd in those shadows, deep, awful, but tender, Which Mercy flings over thy features of fire! Lord, thou rememb'rest the night, when thy Nation “And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these.” —Exod. xiv. 20. Stood fronting her Foe by the red-rolling stream; O'er Egypt thy pillar shed dark desolation, While Israel bask'd all the night in its beam. So, when the dread clouds of anger enfold Thee, From us, in thy mercy, the dark side remove; While shrouded in terrors the guilty behold Thee, Oh, turn upon us the mild light of thy Love! WERE NOT THE SINFUL MARY'S TEARS. (Air.—Stevenson.) Were not the sinful Mary's tears An offering worthy Heaven, When, o'er the faults of former years, She wept—and was forgiven? When, bringing every balmy sweet Her day of luxury stored, She o'er her Saviour's hallow'd feet The precious odours pour'd;— And wiped them with that golden hair, Where once the diamond shone; Though now those gems of grief were there Which shine for God alone! Were not those sweets, so humbly shed— That hair—those weeping eyes— And the sunk heart, that inly bled— Heaven's noblest sacrifice? Thou, that hast slept in error's sleep, Oh, would'st thou wake in Heaven, Like Mary kneel, like Mary weep, “Love much “Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much.” —St. Luke, vii. 47.” and be forgiven! AS DOWN IN THE SUNLESS RETREATS. (Air.—Haydn.) As down in the sunless retreats of the Ocean, Sweet flowers are springing no mortal can see, So, deep in my soul the still prayer of devotion, Unheard by the world, rises silent to Thee, My God! silent, to Thee— Pure, warm, silent, to Thee. As still to the star of its worship, though clouded, The needle points faithfully o'er the dim sea, So, dark as I roam, in this wintry world shrouded, The hope of my spirit turns trembling to Thee, My God! trembling, to Thee— True, fond, trembling, to Thee. BUT WHO SHALL SEE (Air.—Stevenson.) But who shall see the glorious day When, throned on Zion's brow, The Lord shall rend that veil away Which hides the nations now? “And he will destroy, in this mountain, the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.” —Isaiah, xxv. 7. When earth no more beneath the fear Of his rebuke shall lie “The rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth.” —Isaiah, xxv. 8.; When pain shall cease, and every tear Be wiped from every eye. “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; neither shall there be any more pain.” —Rev. xxi. 4. Then, Judah, thou no more shalt mourn Beneath the heathen's chain; Thy days of splendour shall return, And all be new again. “And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.” —Rev. xxi. 5. The Fount of Life shall then be quaff'd In peace, by all who come “And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” —Rev. xxii. 17.; And every wind that blows shall waft Some long-lost exile home. ALMIGHTY GOD! CHORUS OF PRIESTS. (Air.—Mozart.) Almighty God! when round thy shrine The Palm-tree's heavenly branch we twine “The Scriptures having declared that the Temple of Jerusalem was a type of the Messiah, it is natural to conclude that the Palms, which made so conspicuous a figure in that structure, represented that Life and Immortality which were brought to light by the Gospel.” —Observations on the Palm, as a sacred Emblem, by W. Tighe., (Emblem of Life's eternal ray, And Love that “fadeth not away,”) We bless the flowers, expanded all “And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims, and palm-trees, and open flowers.” —1 Kings, vi. 29., We bless the leaves that never fall, And trembling say,—“In Eden thus “The Tree of Life may flower for us!” When round thy Cherubs—smiling calm, Without their flames “When the passover of the tabernacles was revealed to the great lawgiver in the mount, then the cherubic images which appeared in that structure were no longer surrounded by flames; for the tabernacle was a type of the dispensation of mercy, by which Jehovah confirmed his gracious covenant to redeem mankind.” —Observations on the Palm.—we wreathe the Palm, Oh God! we feel the emblem true— Thy Mercy is eternal too. Those Cherubs, with their smiling eyes, That crown of Palm which never dies, Are but the types of Thee above— Eternal Life, and Peace, and Love! OH FAIR! OH PUREST! SAINT AUGUSTINE TO HIS SISTER. In St. Augustine's Treatise upon the advantages of a solitary life, addressed to his sister, there is the following fanciful passage, from which, the reader will perceive, the thought of this song was taken:—“Te, soror, nunquam nolo esse securam, sed timere semperque tuam fragilitatem habere suspectam, ad instar pavidæ columbæ frequentare rivos aquarum et quasi in speculo accipitris cernere supervolantis effigiem et cavere. Rivi aquarum sententiæ sunt scripturarum, quæ de limpidissimo sapientiæ fonte profluentes,” &amp;c. &amp;c. —De Vit. Eremit. ad Sororem. (Air.—Moore.) Oh fair! oh purest! be thou the dove That flies alone to some sunny grove, And lives unseen, and bathes her wing, All vestal white, in the limpid spring. There, if the hovering hawk be near, That limpid spring in its mirror clear Reflects him, ere he reach his prey, And warns the timorous bird away. Be thou this dove; Fairest, purest, be thou this dove. The sacred pages of God's own book Shall be the spring, the eternal brook, In whose holy mirror, night and day, Thou'lt study Heaven's reflected ray;— And should the foes of virtue dare, With gloomy wing, to seek thee there, Thou wilt see how dark their shadows lie Between Heaven and thee, and trembling fly! Be thou that dove; Fairest, purest, be thou that dove. ANGEL OF CHARITY. (Air.—Handel.) Angel of Charity, who, from above, Comest to dwell a pilgrim here, Thy voice is music, thy smile is love, And Pity's soul is in thy tear. When on the shrine of God were laid First-fruits of all most good and fair, That ever bloom'd in Eden's shade, Thine was the holiest offering there. Hope and her sister, Faith, were given But as our guides to yonder sky; Soon as they reach the verge of heaven, There, lost in perfect bliss, they die. One lost in certainty, and one in joy.”Prior. But, long as Love, Almighty Love, Shall on his throne of thrones abide, Thou, Charity, shalt dwell above, Smiling for ever by His side! BEHOLD THE SUN. (Air.—Lord Mornington.) Behold the Sun, how bright From yonder East he springs, As if the soul of life and light Were breathing from his wings. So bright the Gospel broke Upon the souls of men; So fresh the dreaming world awoke In Truth's full radiance then. Before yon Sun arose, Stars cluster'd through the sky— But oh how dim, how pale were those, To His one burning eye! So Truth lent many a ray, To bless the Pagan's night— But, Lord, how weak, how cold were they To Thy One glorious Light! LORD, WHO SHALL BEAR THAT DAY. (Air.—Dr. Boyce.) Lord, who shall bear that day, so dread, so splendid, When we shall see thy Angel, hov'ring o'er This sinful world, with hand to heav'n extended, And hear him swear by Thee that Time's no more? “And the Angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by Him that liveth for ever and ever, that there should be time no longer.” —Rev. x. 5, 6. When Earth shall feel thy fast consuming ray— Who, Mighty God, oh who shall bear that day? When through the world thy awful call hath sounded— “Wake, all ye Dead, to judgment wake, ye Dead!” “Awake, ye Dead, and come to judgment.” And from the clouds, by seraph eyes surrounded, The Saviour shall put forth his radiant head “They shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven—and all the angels with him.” —Matt. xxiv. 30. and xxv. 31.; While Earth and Heav'n before Him pass away “From his face the earth and the heaven fled away.” —Rev. xx. 11.— Who, Mighty God, oh who shall bear that day? When, with a glance, th' Eternal Judge shall sever Earth's evil spirits from the pure and bright, And say to those, “Depart from me for ever!” To these, “Come, dwell with me in endless light!” “And before Him shall be gathered all nations, and He shall separate them one from another. “Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you, &amp;c. “Then shall He say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, &amp;c. “And these shall go away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous into life eternal.” —Matt. xxv. 32. et seq. When each and all in silence take their way— Who, Mighty God, oh who shall bear that day? OH, TEACH ME TO LOVE THEE. (Air.—Haydn.) Oh, teach me to love Thee, to feel what thou art, Till, fill'd with the one sacred image, my heart Shall all other passions disown; Like some pure temple, that shines apart, Reserved for Thy worship alone. In joy and in sorrow, through praise and through blame, Thus still let me, living and dying the same, In Thy service bloom and decay— Like some lone altar, whose votive flame In holiness wasteth away. Though born in this desert, and doom'd by my birth To pain and affliction, to darkness and dearth, On Thee let my spirit rely— Like some rude dial, that, fix'd on earth, Still looks for its light from the sky. WEEP, CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. (Air.—Stevenson.) Weep, weep for him, the Man of GOD “And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab.” —Deut. xxxiv. 8.— In yonder vale he sunk to rest; But none of earth can point the sod “And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.” —Ibid. ver. 6. That flowers above his sacred breast. Weep, children of Israel, weep! His doctrine fell like Heaven's rain “My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew.” —Moses' Song., His words refresh'd like Heaven's dew— Oh, ne'er shall Israel see again A Chief, to God and her so true. Weep, children of Israel, weep! Remember ye his parting gaze, His farewell song by Jordan's tide, When, full of glory and of days, He saw the promised land—and died. “I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.” —Deut. xxxiv. 4. Weep, children of Israel, weep! Yet died he not as men who sink, Before our eyes, to soulless clay; But, changed to spirit, like a wink Of summer lightning, pass'd away. “As he was going to embrace Eleazer and Joshua, and was still discoursing with them, a cloud stood over him on the sudden, and he disappeared in a certain valley, although he wrote in the Holy Books that he died, which was done out of fear, lest they should venture to say that, because of his extraordinary virtue, he went to God.” —Josephus, book iv. chap. viii. Weep, children of Israel, weep! LIKE MORNING, WHEN HER EARLY BREEZE. (Air.—Beethoven.) Like morning, when her early breeze Breaks up the surface of the seas, That, in those furrows, dark with night, Her hand may sow the seeds of light— Thy Grace can send its breathings o'er The Spirit, dark and lost before, And, fresh'ning all its depths, prepare For Truth divine to enter there. Till David touch'd his sacred lyre, In silence lay th' unbreathing wire; But when he swept its chords along, Ev'n Angels stoop'd to hear that song. So sleeps the soul, till Thou, oh Lord, Shalt deign to touch its lifeless chord— Till, waked by Thee, its breath shall rise In music, worthy of the skies! COME, YE DISCONSOLATE. (Air.—German.) Come, ye disconsolate, where'er you languish, Come, at God's altar fervently kneel; Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish— Earth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot heal. Joy of the desolate, Light of the straying, Hope, when all others die, fadeless and pure, Here speaks the Comforter, in God's name saying— “Earth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot cure.” Go, ask the infidel, what boon he brings us, What charm for aching hearts he can reveal, Sweet as that heavenly promise Hope sings us— “Earth has no sorrow that God cannot heal.” AWAKE, ARISE, THY LIGHT IS COME. (Air.—Stevenson.) Awake, arise, thy light is come “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.” —Isaiah, lx.; The nations, that before outshone thee, Now at thy feet lie dark and dumb— The glory of the Lord is on thee! Arise—the Gentiles to thy ray, From ev'ry nook of earth shall cluster; And kings and princes haste to pay Their homage to thy rising lustre. “And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.” —Ib. Lift up thine eyes around, and see, O'er foreign fields, o'er farthest waters, Thy exiled sons return to thee, To thee return thy home-sick daughters. “Lift up thine eyes round about and see; all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from afar, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.” —Isaiah, lx. And camels rich, from Midian's tents, Shall lay their treasures down before thee; And Saba bring her gold and scents, To fill thy air, and sparkle o'er thee. “The multitude of camels shall cover thee; the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and incense.” —Ib. See, who are these that, like a cloud “Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?” —Ib., Are gathering from all earth's dominions, Like doves, long absent, when allow'd Homeward to shoot their trembling pinions. Surely the isles shall wait for me “Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them.” —Ib., The ships of Tarshish round will hover, To bring thy sons across the sea, And waft their gold and silver over. And Lebanon thy pomp shall grace “The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee; the fir-tree, the pine-tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary, and I will make the place of my feet glorious.” —Isaiah, lx.— The fir, the pine, the palm victorious Shall beautify our Holy Place, And make the ground I tread on glorious. No more shall Discord haunt thy ways “Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls, Salvation, and thy gates, Praise.” —Ib. Nor ruin waste thy cheerless nation; But thou shalt call thy portals, Praise, And thou shalt name thy walls, Salvation. The sun no more shall make thee bright “Thy sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.” —Ib., Nor moon shall lend her lustre to thee; But God, Himself, shall be thy Light, And flash eternal glory through thee. Thy sun shall never more go down; A ray, from heav'n itself descended, Shall light thy everlasting crown— Thy days of mourning all are ended. “Thy sun shall no more go down; for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.” —Isaiah, lx. My own, elect, and righteous Land! The Branch, for ever green and vernal, Which I have planted with this hand— Live thou shalt in Life Eternal. “Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands.” —Ib. THERE IS A BLEAK DESERT. (Air.—Crescentini.) There is a bleak Desert, where daylight grows weary Of wasting its smile on a region so dreary— What may that Desert be? 'Tis Life, cheerless Life, where the few joys that come Are lost, like that daylight, for 'tis not their home. There is a lone Pilgrim, before whose faint eyes The water he pants for but sparkles and flies— Who may that Pilgrim be? 'Tis Man, hapless Man, through this life tempted on By fair shining hopes, that in shining are gone. There is a bright Fountain, through that Desert stealing To pure lips alone its refreshment revealing— What may that Fountain be? 'Tis Truth, holy Truth, that, like springs under ground, By the gifted of Heaven alone can be found. In singing, the following line had better be adopted,— “Can but by the gifted of Heaven be found.” There is a fair Spirit, whose wand hath the spell To point where those waters in secrecy dwell— Who may that Spirit be? 'Tis Faith, humble Faith, who hath learn'd that, where'er Her wand bends to worship, the Truth must be there! SINCE FIRST THY WORD. (Air.—Nicholas Freeman.) Since first Thy Word awaked my heart, Like new life dawning o'er me, Where'er I turn mine eyes, Thou art, All light and love before me. Nought else I feel, or hear or see— All bonds of earth I sever— Thee, O God, and only Thee I live for, now and ever. Like him whose fetters dropp'd away When light shone o'er his prison “And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison, and his chains fell off from his hands.” —Acts, xii. 7., My spirit, touch'd by Mercy's ray, Hath from her chains arisen. And shall a soul Thou bidst be free, Return to bondage?—never! Thee, O God, and only Thee I live for, now and ever. HARK! 'TIS THE BREEZE. (Air.—Rousseau.) Hark! 'tis the breeze of twilight calling Earth's weary children to repose; While, round the couch of Nature falling, Gently the night's soft curtains close. Soon o'er a world, in sleep reclining, Numberless stars, through yonder dark, Shall look, like eyes of Cherubs shining From out the veils that hid the Ark. Guard us, oh Thou, who never sleepest, Thou who, in silence throned above, Throughout all time, unwearied, keepest Thy watch of Glory, Pow'r, and Love. Grant that, beneath thine eye, securely, Our souls, awhile from life withdrawn, May, in their darkness, stilly, purely, Like “sealed fountains,” rest till dawn. WHERE IS YOUR DWELLING, YE SAINTED? (Air.—Hasse.) Where is your dwelling, ye Sainted? Through what Elysium more bright Than fancy or hope ever painted, Walk ye in glory and light? Who the same kingdom inherits? Breathes there a soul that may dare Look to that world of Spirits, Or hope to dwell with you there? Sages! who, ev'n in exploring Nature through all her bright ways, Went, like the Seraphs, adoring, And veil'd your eyes in the blaze— Martyrs! who left for our reaping Truths you had sown in your blood— Sinners! whom long years of weeping Chasten'd from evil to good— Maidens! who, like the young Crescent, Turning away your pale brows From earth, and the light of the Present, Look'd to your Heavenly Spouse— Say, through what region enchanted Walk ye, in Heaven's sweet air? Say, to what spirits 'tis granted, Bright souls, to dwell with you there? HOW LIGHTLY MOUNTS THE MUSE'S WING. (Air.—Anonymous.) How lightly mounts the Muse's wing, Whose theme is in the skies— Like morning larks, that sweeter sing The nearer Heav'n they rise. Though Love his magic lyre may tune, Yet ah, the flow'rs he round it wreathes Were pluck'd beneath pale Passion's moon, Whose madness in their odour breathes. How purer far the sacred lute, Round which Devotion ties Sweet flow'rs that turn to heav'nly fruit, And palm that never dies. Though War's high-sounding harp may be Most welcome to the hero's ears, Alas, his chords of victory Are wet, all o'er, with human tears. How far more sweet their numbers run, Who hymn, like Saints above, No victor, but th' Eternal One, No trophies but of Love! GO FORTH TO THE MOUNT. (Air.—Stevenson.) Go forth to the Mount—bring the olive-branch home “And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive-branches,” &amp;c. &amp;c. —Neh. viii. 15., And rejoice, for the day of our Freedom is come! From that time “For since the days of Joshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so: and there was very great gladness.” —Ib. 17., when the moon upon Ajalon's vale, Looking motionless down “Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.” —Josh. x. 12., saw the kings of the earth, In the presence of God's mighty Champion, grow pale— Oh, never had Judah an hour of such mirth! Go forth to the Mount—bring the olive-branch home, And rejoice, for the day of our Freedom is come! Bring myrtle and palm—bring the boughs of each tree That's worthy to wave o'er the tents of the Free. “Fetch olive-branches and pine-branches, and myrtle-branches, and palm-branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths.” —Neh. viii. 15. From that day, when the footsteps of Israel shone, With a light not their own, through the Jordan's deep tide, Whose waters shrunk back as the Ark glided on “And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground.” —Josh. iii. 17.— Oh, never had Judah an hour of such pride! Go forth to the Mount—bring the olive-branch home, And rejoice, for the day of our Freedom is come! IS IT NOT SWEET TO THINK, HEREAFTER. (Air.—Haydn.) Is it not sweet to think, hereafter, When the Spirit leaves this sphere, Love, with deathless wing, shall waft her To those she long hath mourn'd for here? Hearts, from which 'twas death to sever, Eyes, this world can ne'er restore, There, as warm, as bright as ever, Shall meet us and be lost no more. When wearily we wander, asking Of earth and heav'n, where are they, Beneath whose smile we once lay basking, Blest, and thinking bliss would stay? Hope still lifts her radiant finger Pointing to th' eternal Home, Upon whose portal yet they linger, Looking back for us to come. Alas, alas—doth Hope deceive us? Shall friendship—love—shall all those ties That bind a moment, and then leave us, Be found again where nothing dies? Oh, if no other boon were given, To keep our hearts from wrong and stain, Who would not try to win a Heaven Where all we love shall live again? WAR AGAINST BABYLON. (Air.—Novello.) “War against Babylon!” shout we around “Shout against her round about.” —Jer. 1. 15., Be our banners through earth unfurl'd; Rise up, ye nations, ye kings, at the sound “Set up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms,” &amp;c. &amp;c. —Ib. li. 27.— “War against Babylon!” shout through the world! Oh thou, that dwellest on many waters “Oh thou that dwellest upon many waters, thy end is come.” Ib. 13., Thy day of pride is ended now; And the dark curse of Israel's daughters Breaks, like a thunder-cloud, over thy brow! War, war, war against Babylon! Make bright the arrows, and gather the shields “Make bright the arrows; gather the shields.....set the standard upon the walls of Babylon” —Jer. li. 11, 12., Set the standard of God on high; Swarm we, like locusts, o'er all her fields, “Zion” our watchword, and “vengeance” our cry! Woe! woe!—the time of thy visitation “Woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation!” —Jer. 1. 27. Is come, proud Land, thy doom is cast— And the black surge of desolation Sweeps o'er thy guilty head, at last! War, war, war against Babylon! THE SUMMER FÊTE. TO THE HONOURABLE MRS. NORTON. “Where are ye now, ye summer days, “That once inspired the poet's lays? “Blest time! ere England's nymphs and swains, “For lack of sunbeams, took to coals— “Summers of light, undimm'd by rains, “Whose only mocking trace remains “In watering-pots and parasols.” Thus spoke a young Patrician maid, As, on the morning of that Fête Which bards unborn shall celebrate, She backward drew her curtain's shade, And, closing one half-dazzled eye, Peep'd with the other at the sky— Th' important sky, whose light or gloom Was to decide, this day, the doom Of some few hundred beauties, wits, Blues, Dandies, Swains, and Exquisites. Faint were her hopes; for June had now Set in with all his usual rigour! Young Zephyr yet scarce knowing how To nurse a bud, or fan a bough, But Eurus in perpetual vigour; And, such the biting summer air, That she, the nymph now nestling there— Snug as her own bright gems recline, At night, within their cotton shrine— Had, more than once, been caught of late Kneeling before her blazing grate, Like a young worshipper of fire, With hands uplifted to the flame, Whose glow as if to woo them nigher, Through the white fingers flushing came. But oh! the light, the unhoped-for light, That now illumed this morning's heaven! Up sprung Iänthe at the sight, Though—hark!—the clocks but strike eleven, And rarely did the nymph surprise Mankind so early with her eyes. Who now will say that England's sun (Like England's self, these spendthrift days) His stock of wealth hath near outrun, And must retrench his golden rays— Pay for the pride of sunbeams past, And to mere moonshine come at last? “Calumnious thought!” Iänthe cries, While coming mirth lit up each glance, And, prescient of the ball, her eyes Already had begun to dance: For brighter sun than that which now Sparkled o'er London's spires and towers, Had never bent from heaven his brow To kiss Firenze's City of Flowers. What must it be—if thus so fair Mid the smoked groves of Grosvenor Square— What must it be where Thames is seen Gliding between his banks of green, While rival villas, on each side, Peep from their bowers to woo his tide, And, like a Turk between two rows Of Harem beauties, on he goes— A lover, loved for ev'n the grace With which he slides from their embrace. In one of those enchanted domes, One, the most flowery, cool, and bright Of all by which that river roams, The Fête is to be held to-night— That Fête already link'd to fame, Whose cards, in many a fair one's sight (When look'd for long, at last they came,) Seem'd circled with a fairy light;— That Fête to which the cull, the flower Of England's beauty, rank and power, From the young spinster, just come out, To the old Premier, too long in— From legs of far descended gout, To the last new-mustachio'd chin— All were convoked by Fashion's spells To the small circle where she dwells, Collecting nightly, to allure us, Live atoms, which, together hurl'd, She, like another Epicurus, Sets dancing thus, and calls “the World.” Behold how busy in those bowers (Like May-flies, in and out of flowers,) The countless menials swarming run, To furnish forth, ere set of sun, The banquet-table richly laid Beneath yon awning's lengthen'd shade, Where fruits shall tempt, and wines entice, And Luxury's self, at Gunter's call, Breathe from her summer-throne of ice A spirit of coolness over all. And now the important hour drew nigh, When, 'neath the flush of evening's sky, The west-end “world” for mirth let loose, And moved, as he of Syracuse Archimedes. Ne'er dreamt of moving worlds, by force Of four-horse power, had all combined Through Grosvenor Gate to speed their course, Leaving that portion of mankind, Whom they call “Nobody,” behind;— No star for London's feasts to-day, No moon of beauty, new this May, To lend the night her crescent ray;— Nothing, in short, for ear or eye, But veteran belles, and wits gone by, The relics of a past beau-monde, A world, like Cuvier's, long dethroned! Ev'n Parliament this evening nods Beneath th' harangues of minor gods, On half its usual opiate's share; The great dispensers of repose, The first-rate furnishers of prose Being all call'd to—prose elsewhere. Soon as through Grosvenor's lordly square I am not certain whether the Dowagers of this Square have yet yielded to the innovations of Gas and Police, but at the time when the above lines were written they still obstinately persevered in their old régime; and would not suffer themselves to be either well guarded or well lighted.— That last impregnable redoubt, Where, guarded with Patrician care, Primeval Error still holds out— Where never gleam of gas must dare 'Gainst ancient Darkness to revolt, Nor smooth Macadam hope to spare The dowagers one single jolt;— Where, far too stately and sublime To profit by the lights of time, Let Intellect march how it will, They stick to oil and watchmen still:— Soon as through that illustrious square The first epistolary bell, Sounding by fits upon the air, Of parting pennies rung the knell; Warn'd by that tell-tale of the hours, And by the day-light's westering beam, The young Iänthe, who, with flowers Half crown'd, had sat in idle dream Before her glass, scarce knowing where Her fingers roved through that bright hair, While, all capriciously, she now Dislodged some curl from her white brow, And now again replaced it there;— As though her task was meant to be One endless change of ministry— A routing-up of Loves and Graces, But to plant others in their places. Meanwhile—what strain is that which floats Through the small boudoir near—like notes Of some young bird, its task repeating For the next linnet music-meeting? A voice it was, whose gentle sounds Still kept a modest octave's bounds, Nor yet had ventured to exalt Its rash ambition to B alt, That point towards which when ladies rise, The wise man takes his hat and—flies. Tones of a harp, too, gently played, Came with this youthful voice communing; Tones true, for once, without the aid Of that inflictive process, tuning— A process which must oft have given Poor Milton's ears a deadly wound; So pleased, among the joys of Heaven, He specifies “harps ever tuned.” ? their golden harps they took— Harps ever tuned. Paradise Lost, book iii. She who now sung this gentle strain Was our young nymph's still younger sister— Scarce ready yet for Fashion's train In their light legions to enlist her, But counted on, as sure to bring Her force into the field next spring. The song she thus, like Jubal's shell, Gave forth “so sweetly and so well,” Was one in Morning Post much famed, From a divine collection, named, “Songs of the Toilet”—every Lay Taking for subject of its Muse, Some branch of feminine array, Some item, with full scope, to choose, From diamonds down to dancing shoes; From the last hat that Herbault's hands Bequeath'd to an admiring world, Down to the latest flounce that stands Like Jacob's Ladder—or expands Far forth, tempestuously unfurl'd. Speaking of one of these new Lays, The Morning Post thus sweetly says:— “Not all that breathes from Bishop's lyre, “That Barnett dreams, or Cooke conceives, “Can match for sweetness, strength, or fire, “This fine Cantata upon Sleeves. “The very notes themselves reveal “The cut of each new sleeve so well; “A flat betrays the Imbécilles The name given to those large sleeves that hang loosely., “Light fugues the flying lappets tell; “While rich cathedral chords awake “Our homage for the Manches d' Évêque.” 'Twas the first opening song—the Lay Of all least deep in toilet-lore, That the young nymph, to while away The tiring-hour, thus warbled o'er:— SONG. Array thee, love, array thee, love, In all thy best array thee; The sun's below—the moon's above— And Night and Bliss obey thee. Put on thee all that's bright and rare, The zone, the wreath, the gem, Not so much gracing charms so fair, As borrowing grace from them. Array thee, love, array thee, love, In all that's bright array thee; The sun's below—the moon's above— And Night and Bliss obey thee. Put on the plumes thy lover gave, The plumes, that, proudly dancing, Proclaim to all, where'er they wave, Victorious eyes advancing. Bring forth the robe, whose hue of heaven From thee derives such light, That Iris would give all her seven To boast but one so bright. Array thee, love, array thee, love, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Now hie thee, love, now hie thee, love, Through Pleasure's circles hie thee, And hearts, where'er thy footsteps move, Will beat, when they come nigh thee. Thy every word shall be a spell, Thy every look a ray, And tracks of wondering eyes shall tell The glory of thy way! Now hie thee, love, now hie thee, love, Through Pleasure's circles hie thee, And hearts, where'er thy footsteps move, Shall beat when they come nigh thee. Now in his Palace of the West, Sinking to slumber, the bright Day, Like a tired monarch fann'd to rest, Mid the cool airs of Evening lay; While round his couch's golden rim The gaudy clouds, like courtiers, crept— Struggling each other's light to dim, And catch his last smile e'er he slept. How gay, as o'er the gliding Thames The golden eve its lustre pour'd, Shone out the high-born knights and dames Now grouped around that festal board; A living mass of plumes and flowers, As though they'd robb'd both birds and bowers— A peopled rainbow, swarming through With habitants of every hue; While, as the sparkling juice of France High in the crystal brimmers flowed, Each sunset ray that mixed by chance With the wine's sparkles, showed How sunbeams may be taught to dance. If not in written form exprest, 'Twas known, at least, to every guest, That, though not bidden to parade Their scenic powers in masquerade, (A pastime little found to thrive In the bleak fog of England's skies, Where wit's the thing we best contrive, As masqueraders, to disguise,) It yet was hoped—and well that hope Was answered by the young and gay— That, in the toilet's task to-day, Fancy should take her wildest scope;— That the rapt milliner should be Let loose through fields of poesy, The tailor, in inventive trance, Up to the heights of Epic clamber, And all the regions of Romance Be ransacked by the femme de chambre. Accordingly, with gay Sultanas, Rebeccas, Sapphos, Roxalanas— Circassian slaves whom Love would pay Half his maternal realms to ransom;— Young nuns, whose chief religion lay In looking most profanely handsome;— Muses in muslin—pastoral maids With hats from the Arcade-ian shades, And fortune-tellers, rich, 'twas plain, As fortune-hunters form'd their train. With these, and more such female groups, Were mixed no less fantastic troops Of male exhibiters—all willing To look, even more than usual, killing;— Beau tyrants, smock-faced braggadocios, And brigands, charmingly ferocious;— M.P.s turned Turks, good Moslems then, Who, last night, voted for the Greeks; And Friars, staunch No-Popery men, In close confab with Whig Caciques. But where is she—the nymph, whom late We left before her glass delaying, Like Eve, when by the lake she sate, In the clear wave her charms surveying, And saw in that first glassy mirror The first fair face that lured to error. “Where is she,” ask'st thou?—watch all looks As cent'ring to one point they bear, Like sun-flowers by the sides of brooks, Turn'd to the sun—and she is there. Ev'n in disguise, oh never doubt By her own light you'd track her out: As when the moon, close shawl'd in fog, Steals as she thinks, through heaven incog., Though hid herself, some sidelong ray, At every step, detects her way. But not in dark disguise to-night Hath our young heroine veil'd her light;— For see, she walks the earth, Love's own, His wedded bride, by holiest vow Pledged in Olympus, and made known To mortals by the type which now Hangs glittering on her snowy brow, That butterfly, mysterious trinket, Which means the Soul (tho' few would think it), And sparkling thus on brow so white, Tells us we've Psyche here to-night! But hark! some song hath caught her ears— And, lo, how pleased, as though she'd ne'er Heard the Grand Opera of the Spheres, Her goddess-ship approves the air; And to a mere terrestrial strain, Inspired by nought but pink champagne, Her butterfly as gaily nods As though she sate with all her train At some great Concert of the Gods, With Phœbus, leader—Jove, director, And half the audience drunk with nectar. From a male group the carol came— A few gay youths, whom round the board The last-tried flask's superior fame Had lured to taste the tide it pour'd; And one, who, from his youth and lyre, Seem'd grandson to the Teian sire, Thus gaily sung, while, to his song, Replied in chorus the gay throng:— SONG. Some mortals there may be, so wise, or so fine, As in evenings like this no enjoyment to see; But, as I'm not particular—wit, love, and wine, Are for one night's amusement sufficient for me. Nay—humble and strange as my tastes may appear— If driv'n to the worst, I could manage, thank Heaven, To put up with eyes such as beam round me here, And such wine as we're sipping, six days out of seven. So pledge me a bumper—your sages profound May be blest, if they will, on their own patent plan: But as we are not sages, why—send the cup round— We must only be happy the best way we can. A reward by some king was once offer'd, we're told, To whoe'er could invent a new bliss for mankind; But talk of new pleasures!—give me but the old, And I'll leave your inventors all new ones they find Or should I, in quest of fresh realms of bliss, Set sail in the pinnace of Fancy some day, Let the rich rosy sea I embark on be this, And such eyes as we've here be the stars of my way! In the mean time, a bumper—your Angels, on high, May have pleasures unknown to life's limited span; But, as we are not Angels, why—let the flask fly— We must only be happy all ways that we can. Now nearly fled was sunset's light, Leaving but so much of its beam As gave to objects, late so bright, The colouring of a shadowy dream; And there was still where Day had set A flush that spoke him loth to die— A last link of his glory yet, Binding together earth and sky. Say, why is it that twilight best Becomes even brows the loveliest? That dimness, with its softening touch, Can bring out grace, unfelt before, And charms we ne'er can see too much, When seen but half enchant the more? Alas, it is that every joy In fulness finds its worst alloy, And half a bliss, but hoped or guess'd, Is sweeter than the whole possess'd;— That Beauty, when least shone upon, A creature most ideal grows; And there's no light from moon or sun Like that Imagination throws;— It is, alas, that Fancy shrinks Even from a bright reality, And turning inly, feels and thinks Far heavenlier things than e'er will be. Such was th' effect of twilight's hour On the fair groups that, round and round, From glade to grot, from bank to bower, Now wander'd through this fairy ground; And thus did Fancy—and champagne— Work on the sight their dazzling spells, Till nymphs that look'd, at noon-day, plain, Now brighten'd, in the gloom, to belles; And the brief interval of time, 'Twixt after dinner and before, To dowagers brought back their prime, And shed a halo round two-score. Meanwhile, new pastimes for the eye, The ear, the fancy, quick succeed; And now along the waters fly Light gondoles, of Venetian breed, With knights and dames, who, calm reclined, Lisp out love-sonnets as they glide— Astonishing old Thames to find Such doings on his moral tide. So bright was still that tranquil river, With the last shaft from Daylight's quiver, That many a group, in turn, were seen Embarking on its wave serene; And, 'mong the rest, in chorus gay, A band of mariners, from th' isles Of sunny Greece, all song and smiles, As smooth they floated, to the play Of their oar's cadence, sung this lay:— TRIO. Our home is on the sea, boy, Our home is on the sea; When Nature gave The ocean-wave, She mark'd it for the Free. Whatever storms befall, boy, Whatever storms befall, The island bark Is Freedom's ark, And floats her safe through all. Behold yon sea of isles, boy, Behold yon sea of isles, Where every shore Is sparkling o'er With Beauty's richest smiles. For us hath Freedom claim'd, boy, For us hath Freedom claim'd Those ocean-nests Where Valour rests His eagle wing untamed. And shall the Moslem dare, boy, And shall the Moslem dare, While Grecian hand Can wield a brand, To plant his Crescent there? No—by our fathers, no, boy, No, by the Cross we show— From Maina's rills To Thracia's hills All Greece re-echoes “No!” Like pleasant thoughts that o'er the mind A minute come, and go again, Ev'n so, by snatches, in the wind, Was caught and lost that choral strain, Now full, now faint upon the ear, As the bark floated far or near. At length when, lost, the closing note Had down the waters died along, Forth from another fairy boat, Freighted with music, came this song:— SONG. Smoothly flowing through verdant vales, Gentle river, thy current runs, Shelter'd safe from winter gales, Shaded cool from summer suns. Thus our Youth's sweet moments glide, Fenced with flow'ry shelter round; No rude tempest wakes the tide, All its path is fairy ground. But, fair river, the day will come, When, woo'd by whisp'ring groves in vain, Thou'lt leave those banks, thy shaded home, To mingle with the stormy main. And thou, sweet Youth, too soon wilt pass Into the world's unshelter'd sea, Where, once thy wave hath mix'd, alas, All hope of peace is lost for thee. Next turn we to the gay saloon, Resplendent as a summer noon, Where, 'neath a pendent wreath of lights, A Zodiac of flowers and tapers— (Such as in Russian ball-rooms sheds Its glory o'er young dancers' heads)— Quadrille performs her mazy rites, And reigns supreme o'er slides and capers;— Working to death each opera strain, As, with a foot that ne'er reposes, She jigs through sacred and profane, From “Maid and Magpie” up to “Moses In England the partition of this opera of Rossini was transferred to the story of Peter the Hermit; by which means the indecorum of giving such names as “Moÿse,” “Pharaon,” &amp;c. to the dances selected from it (as was done in Paris), has been avoided.;”— Wearing out tunes as fast as shoes, Till fagg'd Rossini scarce respires; Till Mayerbeer for mercy sues, And Weber at her feet expires. And now the set hath ceased—the bows Of fiddlers taste a brief repose, While light along the painted floor, Arm within arm, the couples stray, Talking their stock of nothings o'er, Till—nothing's left, at last, to say. When, lo!—most opportunely sent— Two Exquisites, a he and she, Just brought from Dandyland, and meant For Fashion's grand Menagerie, Enter'd the room—and scarce were there When all flock'd round them, glad to stare At any monsters, any where. Some thought them perfect, to their tastes; While others hinted that the waists (That in particular of the he thing) Left far too ample room for breathing: Whereas, to meet these critics' wishes, The isthmus there should be so small, That Exquisites, at last, like fishes, Must manage not to breathe at all. The female (these same critics said), Though orthodox from toe to chin, Yet lack'd that spacious width of head To hat of toadstool much akin— That build of bonnet, whose extent Should, like a doctrine of dissent, Puzzle church-doors to let it in. However—sad as 'twas, no doubt, That nymph so smart should go about, With head unconscious of the place It ought to fill in Infinite Space— Yet all allow'd that, of her kind, A prettier show 'twas hard to find; While of that doubtful genus, “dressy men,” The male was thought a first-rate specimen. Such Savans, too, as wish'd to trace The manners, habits, of this race— To know what rank (if rank at all) 'Mong reas'ning things to them should fall— What sort of notions heaven imparts To high-built heads and tight-laced hearts, And how far Soul, which, Plato says, Abhors restraint, can act in stays— Might now, if gifted with discerning, Find opportunities of learning: As these two creatures—from their pout And frown, 'twas plain—had just fall'n out; And all their little thoughts, of course, Were stirring in full fret and force;— Like mites, through microscope espied, A world of nothings magnified. But mild the vent such beings seek, The tempest of their souls to speak: As Opera swains to fiddles sigh, To fiddles fight, to fiddles die, Even so this tender couple set Their well-bred woes to a Duet. WALTZ DUET. It is hardly necessary to remind the reader that this Duet is a parody of the often-translated and parodied ode of Horace, “Donec gratus eram tibi,” &amp;c. HE. Long as I waltz'd with only thee, Each blissful Wednesday that went by, Nor stylish Stultz, nor neat Nugee Adorn'd a youth so blest as I. Oh! ah! ah! oh! Those happy days are gone—heighho! SHE. Long as with thee I skimm'd the ground, Nor yet was scorn'd for Lady Jane, No blither nymph tetotum'd round To Collinet's immortal strain. Oh! ah! &amp;c. Those happy days are gone—heighho! HE. With Lady Jane now whirl'd about, I know no bounds of time or breath; And, should the charmer's head hold out, My heart and heels are hers till death. Oh! ah! &amp;c. Still round and round through life we'll go. SHE. To Lord Fitznoodle's eldest son, A youth renown'd for waistcoats smart, I now have given (excuse the pun) A vested interest in my heart. Oh! ah! &amp;c. Still round and round with him I'll go. HE. What if, by fond remembrance led Again to wear our mutual chain, For me thou cut'st Fitznoodle dead, And I levant from Lady Jane. Oh! ah! &amp;c. Still round and round again we'll go. SHE. Though he the Noodle honours give, And thine, dear youth, are not so high, With thee in endless waltz I'd live, With thee, to Weber's Stop-Waltz, die! Oh! ah! &amp;c. Thus round and round through life we'll go. [Exeunt waltzing. While thus, like motes that dance away Existence in a summer ray, These gay things, born but to quadrille, The circle of their doom fulfil— (That dancing doom, whose law decrees That they should live, on the alert toe, A life of ups-and-downs, like keys Of Broadwood's in a long concerto:—) While thus the fiddle's spell, within, Calls up its realm of restless sprites, Without, as if some Mandarin Were holding there his Feast of Lights, Lamps of all hues, from walks and bowers, Broke on the eye, like kindling flowers, Till, budding into light, each tree Bore its full fruit of brilliancy. Here shone a garden—lamps all o'er, As though the Spirits of the Air Had tak'n it in their heads to pour A shower of summer meteors there;— While here a lighted shrubbery led To a small lake that sleeping lay, Cradled in foliage, but, o'er-head, Open to heaven's sweet breath and ray; While round its rim there burning stood Lamps, with young flowers beside them bedded, That shrunk from such warm neighbourhood; And, looking bashful in the flood, Blush'd to behold themselves so wedded. Hither, to this embower'd retreat, Fit but for nights so still and sweet; Nights, such as Eden's calm recall In its first lonely hour, when all So silent is, below, on high, That if a star falls down the sky, You almost think you hear it fall— Hither, to this recess, a few, To shun the dancers' wildering noise, And give an hour, ere night-time flew, To music's more ethereal joys, Came, with their voices—ready all As Echo, waiting for a call— In hymn or ballad, dirge or glee, To weave their mingling minstrelsy. And, first, a dark-ey'd nymph, array'd— Like her, whom Art hath deathless made, Bright Mona Lisa The celebrated portrait by Lionardo da Vinci, which he is said to have occupied four years in painting. —Vasari, vol. vii.—with that braid Of hair across the brow, and one Small gem that in the centre shone— With face, too, in its form resembling Da Vinci's Beauties—the dark eyes, Now lucid, as through crystal trembling, Now soft, as if suffused with sighs— Her lute, that hung beside her, took, And, bending o'er it with shy look, More beautiful, in shadow thus, Than when with life most luminous, Pass'd her light finger o'er the chords, And sung to them these mournful words:— SONG. Bring hither, bring thy lute, while day is dying— Here will I lay me, and list to thy song; Should tones of other days mix with its sighing, Tones of a light heart, now banish'd so long, Chase them away—they bring but pain, And let thy theme be woe again. Sing on, thou mournful lute—day is fast going, Soon will its light from thy chords die away; One little gleam in the west is still glowing, When that hath vanish'd, farewell to thy lay. Mark, how it fades!—see, it is fled! Now, sweet lute, be thou, too, dead. The group, that late, in garb of Greeks, Sung their light chorus o'er the tide— Forms, such as up the wooded creeks Of Helle's shore at noon-day glide, Or, nightly, on her glistening sea, Woo the bright waves with melody— Now link'd their triple league again Of voices sweet, and sung a strain, Such as, had Sappho's tuneful ear But caught it, on the fatal steep, She would have paused, entranced, to hear, And, for that day, deferr'd her leap. SONG AND TRIO. On one of those sweet nights that oft Their lustre o'er th' Ægean fling, Beneath my casement, low and soft, I heard a Lesbian lover sing; And, listening both with ear and thought, These sounds upon the night-breeze caught— “Oh, happy as the gods is he, “Who gazes at this hour on thee!” The song was one by Sappho sung, In the first love-dreams of her lyre, When words of passion from her tongue Fell like a shower of living fire. And still, at close of every strain, I heard these burning words again— “Oh, happy as the gods is he, “Who listens at this hour to thee!” Once more to Mona Lisa turn'd Each asking eye—nor turn'd in vain; Though the quick, transient blush that burn'd Bright o'er her cheek, and died again, Show'd with what inly shame and fear Was utter'd what all loved to hear. Yet not to sorrow's languid lay Did she her lute-song now devote; But thus, with voice that, like a ray Of southern sunshine, seem'd to float— So rich with climate was each note— Call'd up in every heart a dream Of Italy with this soft theme:— SONG. Oh, where art thou dreaming, On land, or on sea? In my lattice is gleaming The watch-light for thee; And this fond heart is glowing To welcome thee home, And the night is fast going, But thou art not come: No, thou com'st not! 'Tis the time when night-flowers Should wake from their rest; 'Tis the hour of all hours, When the lute singeth best. But the flowers are half sleeping Till thy glance they see; And the hush'd lute is keeping Its music for thee. Yet, thou com'st not! Scarce had the last word left her lip, When a light, boyish form, with trip Fantastic, up the green walk came, Prank'd in gay vest, to which the flame Of every lamp he pass'd, or blue, Or green, or crimson, lent its hue; As though a live cameleon's skin He had despoil'd, to robe him in. A zone he wore of clattering shells, And from his lofty cap, where shone A peacock's plume, there dangled bells That rung as he came dancing on. Close after him, a page—in dress And shape, his miniature express— An ample basket, fill'd with store Of toys and trinkets, laughing bore; Till, having reach'd this verdant seat, He laid it at his master's feet, Who, half in speech and half in song, Chaunted this invoice to the throng:— SONG. Who'll buy?—'tis Folly's shop, who'll buy?— We've toys to suit all ranks and ages; Besides our usual fools' supply, We've lots of playthings, too, for sages. For reasoners, here's a juggler's cup, That fullest seems when nothing's in it; And nine-pins set, like systems, up, To be knock'd down the following minute. Who'll buy?—'tis Folly's shop, who'll buy? Gay caps we here of foolscap make, For bards to wear in dog-day weather; Or bards the bells alone may take, And leave to wits the cap and feather. Tetotums we've for patriots got, Who court the mob with antics humble; Like theirs the patriot's dizzy lot, A glorious spin, and then—a tumble. Who'll buy, &amp;c. &amp;c. Here, wealthy misers to inter, We've shrouds of neat post-obit paper; While, for their heirs, we've quicksilver, That, fast as they can wish, will caper. For aldermen we've dials true, That tell no hour but that of dinner; For courtly parsons sermons new, That suit alike both saint and sinner. Who'll buy, &amp;c. &amp;c. No time we've now to name our terms, But, whatsoe'er the whims that seize you, This oldest of all mortal firms, Folly and Co., will try to please you. Or, should you wish a darker hue Of goods than we can recommend you, Why then (as we with lawyers do) To Knavery's shop next door we'll send you. Who'll buy, &amp;c. &amp;c. While thus the blissful moments roll'd, Moments of rare and fleeting light, That show themselves, like grains of gold In the mine's refuse, few and bright; Behold where, opening far away, The long Conservatory's range, Stripp'd of the flowers it wore all day, But gaining lovelier in exchange, Presents, on Dresden's costliest ware, A supper such as Gods might share. Ah much-lov'd Supper!—blithe repast Of other times, now dwindling fast, Since Dinner far into the night Advanced the march of appetite; Deployed his never-ending forces Of various vintage and three courses, And, like those Goths who play'd the dickens With Rome and all her sacred chickens, Put Supper and her fowls so white, Legs, wings, and drumsticks, all to flight. Now waked once more by wine—whose tide Is the true Hippocrene, where glide The Muse's swans with happiest wing, Dipping their bills, before they sing— The minstrels of the table greet The listening ear with descant sweet:— SONG AND TRIO. THE LEVEEE AND COUCHEE. Call the Loves around, Let the whisp'ring sound Of their wings be heard alone, Till soft to rest My Lady blest At this bright hour hath gone. Let Fancy's beams Play o'er her dreams, Till, touch'd with light all through, Her spirit be Like a summer sea, Shining and slumbering too. And, while thus hush'd she lies, Let the whisper'd chorus rise— “Good evening, good evening, to our Lady's bright eyes.” But the day-beam breaks, See, our Lady wakes! Call the Loves around once more, Like stars that wait At Morning's gate, Her first steps to adore. Let the veil of night From her dawning sight All gently pass away, Like mists that flee From a summer sea, Leaving it full of day. And, while her last dream flies, Let the whisper'd chorus rise— “Good morning, good morning, to our Lady's bright eyes.” SONG. If to see thee be to love thee, If to love thee be to prize Nought of earth or heav'n above thee, Nor to live but for those eyes: If such love to mortal given, Be wrong to earth, be wrong to heaven, 'Tis not for thee the fault to blame, For from those eyes the madness came. Forgive but thou the crime of loving, In this heart more pride 'twill raise To be thus wrong, with thee approving, Than right, with all a world to praise! But say, while light these songs resound, What means that buz of whispering round, From lip to lip—as if the Power Of Mystery, in this gay hour, Had thrown some secret (as we fling Nuts among children) to that ring Of rosy, restless lips, to be Thus scrambled for so wantonly? And, mark ye, still as each reveals The mystic news, her hearer steals A look tow'rds yon enchanted chair, Where, like the Lady of the Masque, A nymph, as exquisitely fair As Love himself for bride could ask, Sits blushing deep, as if aware Of the wing'd secret circling there. Who is this nymph? and what, oh Muse, What, in the name of all odd things That woman's restless brain pursues, What mean these mystic whisperings? Thus runs the tale:—yon blushing maid, Who sits in beauty's light array'd, While o'er her leans a tall young Dervise, (Who from her eyes, as all observe, is Learning by heart the Marriage Service,) Is the bright heroine of our song,— The Love-wed Psyche, whom so long We've miss'd among this mortal train, We thought her wing'd to heaven again. But no—earth still demands her smile; Her friends, the Gods, must wait awhile. And if, for maid of heavenly birth, A young Duke's proffer'd heart and hand Be things worth waiting for on earth, Both are, this hour, at her command. To-night, in yonder half-lit shade, For love concerns expressly meant, The fond proposal first was made, And love and silence blush'd consent. Parents and friends (all here, as Jews, Enchanters, house-maids, Turks, Hindoos,) Have heard, approved, and blest the tie; And now, hadst thou a poet's eye, Thou might'st behold, in th' air, above That brilliant brow, triumphant Love, Holding, as if to drop it down Gently upon her curls, a crown Of Ducal shape—but, oh, such gems! Pilfer'd from Peri diadems, And set in gold like that which shines To deck the Fairy of the Mines: In short, a crown all glorious—such as Love orders when he makes a Duchess. But see, 'tis morn in heaven; the Sun Up the bright orient hath begun To canter his immortal team; And, though not yet arrived in sight, His leaders' nostrils send a steam Of radiance forth, so rosy bright As makes their onward path all light. What's to be done? if Sol will be So deuced early, so must we; And when the day thus shines outright, Ev'n dearest friends must bid good night. So, farewell, scene of mirth and masking Now almost a by-gone tale; Beauties, late in lamp-light basking Now, by daylight, dim and pale; Harpers, yawning o'er your harps, Scarcely knowing flats from sharps; Mothers who, while bored you keep Time by nodding, nod to sleep; Heads of hair, that stood last night Crépé, crispy, and upright, But have now, alas, one sees, a Leaning like the tower of Pisa; Fare ye well—thus sinks away All that's mighty, all that's bright; Tyre and Sidon had their day, And even a Ball—has but its night!

FIRST EVENING. “The sky is bright—the breeze is fair, “And the mainsail flowing, full and free— “Our farewell word is woman's pray'r, “And the hope before us—Liberty! “Farewell, farewell. “To Greece we give our shining blades, “And our hearts to you, young Zean Maids! “The moon is in the heavens above, “And the wind is on the foaming sea— “Thus shines the star of woman's love “On the glorious strife of Liberty! “Farewell, farewell. “To Greece we give our shining blades, “And our hearts to you, young Zean Maids!” Thus sung they from the bark, that now Turn'd to the sea its gallant prow, Bearing within it hearts as brave, As e'er sought Freedom o'er the wave; And leaving on that islet's shore, Where still the farewell beacons burn, Friends, that shall many a day look o'er The long, dim sea for their return. Virgin of Heaven! speed their way— Oh, speed their way,—the chosen flow'r, Of Zea's youth, the hope and stay Of parents in their wintry hour, The love of maidens, and the pride Of the young, happy, blushing bride, Whose nuptial wreath has not yet died— All, all are in that precious bark, Which now, alas, no more is seen— Though every eye still turns to mark The moonlight spot where it had been. Vainly you look, ye maidens, sires, And mothers, your beloved are gone!— Now may you quench those signal fires, Whose light they long look'd back upon From their dark deck—watching the flame As fast it faded from their view, With thoughts, that, but for manly shame, Had made them droop and weep like you. Home to your chambers! home, and pray For the bright coming of that day, When, bless'd by heaven, the Cross shall sweep The Crescent from the Ægean deep, And your brave warriors, hastening back, Will bring such glories in their track, As shall, for many an age to come, Shed light around their name and home. There is a Fount on Zea's isle, Round which, in soft luxuriance, smile All the sweet flowers, of every kind, On which the sun of Greece looks down, Pleased as a lover on the crown His mistress for her brow hath twined, When he beholds each floweret there, Himself had wish'd her most to wear; Here bloom'd the laurel-rose “Nerium Oleander. In Cyprus it retains its ancient name, Rhododaphne, and the Cypriots adorn their churches with the flowers on feast-days.” —Journal of Dr. Sibthorpe, Walpole's Turkey., whose wreath Hangs radiant round the Cypriot shrines, And here those bramble-flowers, that breathe Their odour into Zante's wines Id.:— The splendid woodbine, that, at eve, To grace their floral diadems, The lovely maids of Patmos weave Lonicera Caprifolium, used by the girls of Patmos for garlands.:— And that fair plant, whose tangled stems Shine like a Nereid's hair Cuscuta europæa. “From the twisting and twining of the stems, it is compared by the Greeks to the dishevelled hair of the Nereids.” —Walpole's Turkey., when spread, Dishevell'd, o'er her azure bed;— All these bright children of the clime, Each at its own most genial time, The summer, or the year's sweet prime,) Like beautiful earth-stars, adorn The Valley, where that Fount is born: While round, to grace its cradle green, Groups of Velani oaks are seen, Towering on every verdant height— Tall, shadowy, in the evening light, Like Genii, set to watch the birth Of some enchanted child of earth— Fair oaks, that over Zea's vales, Stand with their leafy pride unfurl'd; While Commerce, from her thousand sails, Scatters their fruit throughout the world! “The produce of the island in these acorns alone amounts annually to fifteen thousand quintals.” —Clarke's Travels. 'Twas here—as soon as prayer and sleep (Those truest friends to all who weep) Had lighten'd every heart, and made Ev'n sorrow wear a softer shade— 'Twas here, in this secluded spot, Amid whose breathings calm and sweet Grief might be soothed, if not forgot, The Zean nymphs resolved to meet Each evening now, by the same light That saw their farewell tears that night; And try, if sound of lute and song, If wandering mid the moonlight flowers In various talk, could charm along With lighter step, the lingering hours, Till tidings of that Bark should come, Or Victory waft their warriors home! When first they met—the wonted smile Of greeting having gleam'd awhile— 'Twould touch ev'n Moslem heart to see The sadness that came suddenly O'er their young brows, when they look'd round Upon that bright, enchanted ground; And thought, how many a time, with those Who now were gone to the rude wars, They there had met, at evening's close, And danced till morn outshone the stars! But seldom long doth hang th' eclipse Of sorrow o'er such youthful breasts— The breath from her own blushing lips, That on the maiden's mirror rests, Not swifter, lighter from the glass, Than sadness from her brow doth pass. Soon did they now, as round the Well They sat, beneath the rising moon— And some, with voice of awe, would tell Of midnight fays, and nymphs who dwell In holy founts—while some would tune Their idle lutes, that now had lain, For days, without a single strain;— And others, from the rest apart, With laugh that told the lighten'd heart, Sat, whispering in each other's ear Secrets, that all in turn would hear;— Soon did they find this thoughtless play So swiftly steal their griefs away, That many a nymph, though pleased the while, Reproach'd her own forgetful smile, And sigh'd to think she could be gay Among these maidens there was one, Who to Leucadia Now Santa Maura—the island, from whose cliffs Sappho leaped into the sea. late had been— Had stood, beneath the evening sun, On its white towering cliffs, and seen The very spot where Sappho sung Her swan-like music, ere she sprung (Still holding, in that fearful leap, By her loved lyre,) into the deep, And dying quench'd the fatal fire, At once, of both her heart and lyre. Mutely they listen'd all—and well Did the young travell'd maiden tell Of the dread height to which that steep Beetles above the eddying deep “The precipice, which is fearfully dizzy, is about one hundred and fourteen feet from the water, which is of a profound depth, as appears from the dark blue colour and the eddy that plays round the pointed and projecting rocks.” —Goodisson's Ionian Isles.— Of the lone sea-birds, wheeling round The dizzy edge with mournful sound— And of those scented lilies See Mr. Goodisson's very interesting description of all these circumstances. found Still blooming on that fearful place— As if call'd up by Love, to grace The immortal spot, o'er which the last Bright footsteps of his martyr pass'd! While fresh to every listener's thought These legends of Leucadia brought All that of Sappho's hapless flame Is kept alive, still watch'd by Fame— The maiden, tuning her soft lute, While all the rest stood round her, mute, Thus sketch'd the languishment of soul, That o'er the tender Lesbian stole; And, in a voice, whose thrilling tone Fancy might deem the Lesbian's own, One of those fervid fragments gave, Which still,—like sparkles of Greek Fire, Undying, ev'n beneath the wave,— Burn on thro' Time, and ne'er expire. SONG. As o'er her loom the Lesbian Maid In love-sick languor hung her head, Unknowing where her fingers stray'd, She weeping turn'd away, and said, “Oh, my sweet Mother—'tis in vain— “I cannot weave, as once I wove— “So wilder'd is my heart and brain “With thinking of that youth I love!” I have attempted, in these four lines, to give some idea of that beautiful fragment of Sappho, beginning ??????? ?????, which represents so truly (as Warton remarks) “the languor and listlessness of a person deeply in love.” Again the web she tried to trace, But tears fell o'er each tangled thread; While, looking in her mother's face, Who watchful o'er her lean'd, she said, “Oh, my sweet Mother—'tis in vain— “I cannot weave, as once I wove— “So wilder'd is my heart and brain “With thinking of that youth I love!” A silence follow'd this sweet air, As each in tender musing stood, Thinking, with lips that moved in pray'r, Of Sappho and that fearful flood: While some, who ne'er till now had known How much their hearts resembled hers, Felt as they made her griefs their own, That they, too, were Love's worshippers. At length a murmur, all but mute. So faint it was, came from the lute Of a young melancholy maid, Whose fingers, all uncertain play'd From chord to chord, as if in chase Of some lost melody, some strain Of other times, whose faded trace She sought among those chords again. Slowly the half-forgotten theme (Though born in feelings ne'er forgot) Came to her memory—as a beam Falls broken o'er some shaded spot;— And while her lute's sad symphony Fill'd up each sighing pause between; And Love himself might weep to see What ruin comes where he hath been— As wither'd still the grass is found Where fays have danced their merry round— Thus simply to the listening throng She breath'd her melancholy song:— SONG. Weeping for thee, my love, through the long day, Lonely and wearily life wears away. Weeping for thee, my love, through the long night— No rest in darkness, no joy in light! Nought left but Memory, whose dreary tread Sounds through this ruin'd heart, where all lies dead— Wakening the echoes of joy long fled! Of many a stanza, this alone Had scaped oblivion—like the one Stray fragment of a wreck, which thrown, With the lost vessel's name, ashore, Tells who they were that live no more. When thus the heart is in a vein Of tender thought, the simplest strain Can touch it with peculiar power— As when the air is warm, the scent Of the most wild and rustic flower Can fill the whole rich element— And, in such moods, the homeliest tone That's link'd with feelings, once our own— With friends or joys gone by—will be Worth choirs of loftiest harmony! But some there were, among the group Of damsels there, too light of heart To let their spirits longer droop, Ev'n under music's melting art; And one upspringing, with a bound, From a low bank of flowers, look'd round With eyes that, though so full of light, Had still a trembling tear within; And, while her fingers, in swift flight, Flew o'er a fairy mandolin, Thus sung the song her lover late Had sung to her—the eve before That joyous night, when, as of yore, All Zea met, to celebrate The Feast of May, on the sea-shore. SONG. When the Balaika This word is defrauded here, I suspect, of a syllable; Dr. Clarke, if I recollect right, makes it “Balalaika.” Is heard o'er the sea, I'll dance the Romaika By moonlight with thee. If waves then, advancing, Should steal on our play, Thy white feet, in dancing, Shall chase them away. “I saw above thirty parties engaged in dancing the Romaika upon the sand; in some of those groups, the girl who led them chased the retreating wave.” —Douglas on the Modern Greeks. When the Balaika Is heard o'er the sea, Thou'lt dance the Romaika, My own love with me. Then, at the closing Of each merry lay, How sweet 'tis, reposing, Beneath the night ray! Or if, declining, The moon leave the skies, We'll talk by the shining Of each other's eyes. Oh then, how featly The dance we'll renew, Treading so fleetly Its light mazes through “In dancing the Romaika (says Mr. Douglas) they begin in slow and solemn step till they have gained the time, but by degrees the air becomes more sprightly; the conductress of the dance sometimes setting to her partner, sometimes darting before the rest, and leading them through the most rapid revolutions; sometimes crossing under the hands, which are held up to let her pass, and giving as much liveliness and intricacy as she can to the figures, into which she conducts her companions, while their business is to follow her in all her movements, without breaking the chain, or losing the measure.”: Till stars, looking o'er us From heaven's high bow'rs, Would change their bright chorus For one dance of ours! When the Balaika Is heard o'er the sea, Thou'lt dance the Romaika, My own love, with me. How changingly for ever veers The heart of youth, 'twixt smiles and tears! Ev'n as in April, the light vane Now points to sunshine, now to rain. Instant this lively lay dispell'd The shadow from each blooming brow, And Dancing, joyous Dancing, held Full empire o'er each fancy now. But say—what shall the measure be? “Shall we the old Romaika tread, (Some eager ask'd) “as anciently “'Twas by the maids of Delos led, “When, slow at first, then circling fast. “As the gay spirits rose—at last, “With hand in hand, like links, enlock'd, “Through the light air they seem'd to flit “In labyrinthine maze, that mock'd “The dazzled eye that follow'd it?” Some call'd aloud “the Fountain Dance!”— While one young, dark-ey'd Amazon, Whose step was air-like, and whose glance Flash'd, like a sabre in the sun, Sportively said, “Shame on these soft “And languid strains we hear so oft. “Daughters of Freedom! have not we “Learn'd from our lovers and our sires “The Dance of Greece, while Greece was free— “That Dance, where neither flutes nor lyres, “But sword and shield clash on the ear “A music tyrants quake to hear? For a description of the Pyrrhic Dance see De Guys, &amp;c. —It appears from Apuleius (lib. x.) that this war-dance was, among the ancients, sometimes performed by females. “Heroines of Zea, arm with me, “And dance the dance of Victory!” Thus saying, she, with playful grace, Loosed the wide hat, that o'er her face (From Anatolia See the costume of the Greek women of Natolia in Castellan's Mœurs des Othomans. came the maid) Hung, shadowing each sunny charm; And, with a fair young armourer's aid, Fixing it on her rounded arm, A mimic shield with pride display'd; Then, springing tow'rds a grove that spread Its canopy of foliage near, Pluck'd off a lance-like twig, and said, “To arms, to arms,!” while o'er her head She waved the light branch, as a spear. Promptly the laughing maidens all Obey'd their Chief's heroic call;— Round the shield-arm of each was tied Hat, turban, shawl, as chance might be; The grove, their verdant armoury, Falchion and lance The sword was the weapon chiefly used in this dance. alike supplied; And as their glossy locks, let free, Fell down their shoulders carelessly, You might have dream'd you saw a throng Of youthful Thyads, by the beam Of a May moon, bounding along Peneus' silver-eddied Homer, Il. 2. 753. stream! And now they stepp'd, with measured tread, Martially, o'er the shining field; Now, to the mimic combat led (A heroine at each squadron's head), Struck lance to lance and sword to shield: While still, through every varying feat, Their voices, heard in contrast sweet With some, of deep but soften'd sound, From lips of aged sires around, Who smiling watch'd their children's play— Thus sung the ancient Pyrrhic lay:— SONG. “Raise the buckler—poise the lance— “Now here—now there—retreat—advance!” Such were the sounds, to which the warrior boy Danced in those happy days, when Greece was free; When Sparta's youth, ev'n in the hour of joy, Thus train'd their steps to war and victory. “Raise the buckler—poise the lance— “Now here—now there—retreat—advance!” Such was the Spartan warriors' dance. “Grasp the falchion—gird the shield— “Attack—defend—do all, but yield.” Thus did thy sons, oh Greece, one glorious night, Dance by a moon like this, till o'er the sea That morning dawn'd by whose immortal light They nobly died for thee and liberty! It is said that Leonidas and his companions employed themselves, on the eve of the battle, in music and the gymnastic exercises of their country. “Raise the buckler—poise the lance— “Now here—now there—retreat—advance!” Such was the Spartan heroes' dance. Scarce had they closed this martial lay When, flinging their light spears away, The combatants, in broken ranks, All breathless from the war-field fly; And down, upon the velvet banks And flowery slopes, exhausted lie, Like rosy huntresses of Thrace, Resting at sunset from the chase. “Fond girls!” an aged Zean said— One who, himself, had fought and bled, And now, with feelings, half delight, Half sadness, watch'd their mimic fight— “Fond maids! who thus with War can jest— “Like Love, in Mars's helmet drest, “When, in his childish innocence, “Pleased with the shade that helmet flings, “He thinks not of the blood, that thence “Is dropping o'er his snowy wings. “Ay—true it is, young patriot maids, “If Honour's arm still won the fray, “If luck but shone on righteous blades, “War were a game for gods to play! “But, no, alas!—hear one, who well “Hath track'd the fortunes of the brave— “Hear me, in mournful ditty, tell “What glory waits the patriot's grave:”— SONG. As by the shore, at break of day, A vanquish'd Chief expiring lay, Upon the sands, with broken sword, He traced his farewell to the Free; And, there, the last unfinish'd word He dying wrote was “Liberty!” At night a Sea-bird shriek'd the knell Of him who thus for Freedom fell; The words he wrote, ere evening came, Were cover'd by the sounding sea;— So pass away the cause and name Of him who dies for Liberty! That tribute of subdued applause A charm'd, but timid, audience pays, That murmur, which a minstrel draws From hearts, that feel, but fear to praise, Follow'd this song, and left a pause Of silence after it, that hung Like a fix'd spell on every tongue. At length, a low and tremulous sound Was heard from midst a group, that round A bashful maiden stood, to hide Her blushes, while the lute she tried— Like roses, gathering round to veil The song of some young nightingale, Whose trembling notes steal out between The cluster'd leaves, herself unseen. And, while that voice, in tones that more Through feeling than through weakness err'd, Came, with a stronger sweetness, o'er Th' attentive ear, this strain was heard:— SONG. I saw, from yonder silent cave “This morning we paid our visit to the Cave of Trophonius, and the Fountains of Memory and Oblivion, just upon the water of Hercyna, which flows through stupendous rocks.” —Williams's Travels in Greece., Two Fountains running, side by side, The one was Mem'ry's limpid wave, The other cold Oblivion's tide. “Oh Love!” said I, in thoughtless mood, As deep I drank of Lethe's stream, “Be all my sorrows in this flood “Forgotten like a vanish'd dream!” But who could bear that gloomy blank, Where joy was lost as well as pain? Quickly of Mem'ry's fount I drank, And brought the past all back again; And said, “Oh Love! whate'er my lot, “Still let this soul to thee be true— “Rather than have one bliss forgot, “Be all my pains remember'd too!” The group that stood around, to shade The blushes of that bashful maid, Had, by degrees, as came the lay More strongly forth, retired away, Like a fair shell, whose valves divide, To show the fairer pearl inside: For such she was—a creature, bright And delicate as those day-flow'rs, Which, while they last, make up, in light And sweetness, what they want in hours. So rich upon the ear had grown Her voice's melody—its tone Gathering new courage, as it found An echo in each bosom round— That, ere the nymph, with downcast eye Still on the chords, her lute laid by, “Another Song,” all lips exclaim'd, And each some matchless favourite named; While blushing, as her fingers ran O'er the sweet chords, she thus began:— SONG. Oh, Memory, how coldly Thou paintest joy gone by: Like rainbows, thy pictures But mournfully shine and die. Or, if some tints thou keepest, That former days recall, As o'er each line thou weepest, Thy tears efface them all. But, Memory, too truly Thou paintest grief that's past; Joy's colours are fleeting, But those of Sorrow last. And, while thou bring'st before us Dark pictures of past ill, Life's evening, closing o'er us, But makes them darker still. So went the moonlight hours along, In this sweet glade; and so, with song And witching sounds—not such as they, The cymbalists of Ossa, play'd, To chase the moon's eclipse away This superstitious custom of the Thessalians exists also, as Pietro della Valle tells us, among the Persians., But soft and holy—did each maid Lighten her heart's eclipse awhile, And win back Sorrow to a smile. Not far from this secluded place, On the sea-shore a ruin stood;— A relic of th' extinguish'd race, Who once look'd o'er that foamy flood, When fair Ioulis An ancient city of Zea, the walls of which were of marble. Its remains (says Clarke) “extend from the shore, quite into a valley watered by the streams of a fountain, whence Ioulis received its name.”, by the light Of golden sunset, on the sight Of mariners who sail'd that sea, Rose, like a city of chrysolite, Call'd from the wave by witchery. This ruin—now by barbarous hands Debased into a motley shed, Where the once splendid column stands Inverted on its leafy head— Form'd, as they tell, in times of old, The dwelling of that bard, whose lay Could melt to tears the stern and cold, And sadden, mid their mirth, the gay— Simonides Zea was the birthplace of this poet, whose verses are by Catullus called “tears.”, whose fame, through years And ages past, still bright appears— Like Hesperus, a star of tears! 'Twas hither now—to catch a view Of the white waters, as they play'd Silently in the light—a few Of the more restless damsels stray'd; And some would linger 'mid the scent Of hanging foliage, that perfumed The ruin'd walls; while others went, Culling whatever floweret bloom'd In the lone leafy space between, Where gilded chambers once had been; Or, turning sadly to the sea, Sent o'er the wave a sigh unblest To some brave champion of the Free— Thinking, alas, how cold might be, At that still hour, his place of rest! Meanwhile there came a sound of song From the dark ruins—a faint strain, As if some echo, that among Those minstrel halls had slumbered long, Were murmuring into life again. But, no—the nymphs knew well the tone— A maiden of their train, who loved, Like the night-bird, to sing alone, Had deep into those ruins roved, And there, all other thoughts forgot, Was warbling o'er, in lone delight, A lay that, on that very spot, Her lover sung one moonlight night:— SONG. Ah! where are they, who heard, in former hours, The voice of Song in these neglected bow'rs? They are gone—all gone! The youth, who told his pain in such sweet tone, That all, who heard him, wish'd his pain their own— He is gone—he is gone! And she, who, while he sung, sat listening by, And thought, to strains like these 'twere sweet to die— She is gone—she too is gone! 'Tis thus, in future hours, some bard will say Of her, who hears, and him, who sings this lay— They are gone—they both are gone! The moon was now, from heaven's steep, Bending to dip her silvery urn Into the bright and silent deep— And the young nymphs, on their return From those romantic ruins, found Their other playmates, ranged around The sacred Spring, prepared to tune Their parting hymn These “Songs of the Well,” as they were called among the ancients, still exist in Greece. De Guys tells us that he has seen “the young women in Prince's Island, assembled in the evening at a public well, suddenly strike up a dance, while others sung in concert to them.”, ere sunk the moon, To that fair Fountain, by whose stream Their hearts had form'd so many a dream. Who has not read the tales, that tell Of old Eleusis' sacred Well, Or heard what legend-songs recount Of Syra, and its holy Fount “The inhabitants of Syra, both ancient and modern, may be considered as the worshippers of water. The old fountain, at which the nymphs of the island assembled in the earliest ages, exists in its original state; the same rendezvous as it was formerly, whether of love and gallantry, or of gossiping and tale-telling. It is near to the town, and the most limpid water gushes continually from the solid rock. It is regarded by the inhabitants with a degree of religious veneration; and they preserve a tradition, that the pilgrims of old time, in their way to Delos, resorted hither for purification.” —Clarke., Gushing, at once, from the hard rock Into the laps of living flowers— Where village maidens loved to flock, On summer-nights, and, like the Hours, Link'd in harmonious dance and song, Charm'd the unconscious night along; While holy pilgrims, on their way To Delos' isle, stood looking on, Enchanted with a scene so gay, Nor sought their boats, till morning shone. Such was the scene this lovely glade And its fair inmates now display'd, As round the Fount, in linked ring, They went, in cadence slow and light, And thus to that enchanted Spring Warbled their Farewell for the night:— SONG. Here, while the moonlight dim Falls on that mossy brim, Sing we our Fountain Hymn, Maidens of Zea! Nothing but Music's strain, When Lovers part in pain, Soothes, till they meet again, Oh, Maids of Zea! Bright Fount, so clear and cold, Round which the nymphs of old Stood, with their locks of gold, Fountain of Zea! Not even Castaly, Famed though its streamlet be, Murmurs or shines like thee, Oh, Fount of Zea! Thou, while our hymn we sing, Thy silver voice shalt bring, Answering, answering, Sweet Fount of Zea! For, of all rills that run, Sparkling by moon or sun, Thou art the fairest one, Bright Fount of Zea! Now, by those stars that glance Over heav'n's still expanse, Weave we our mirthful dance, Daughters of Zea! Such as, in former days, Danced they, by Dian's rays, Where the Eurotas strays “Qualis in Eurotæ ripis, aut per juga Cynthi Exercet Diana choros.”—Virgil., Oh, Maids of Zea! But when to merry feet Hearts with no echo beat, Say, can the dance be sweet? Maidens of Zea! No, nought but Music's strain, When lovers part in pain, Soothes, till they meet again, Oh, Maids of Zea! SECOND EVENING. SONG. When evening shades are falling O'er Ocean's sunny sleep, To pilgrims' hearts recalling Their home beyond the deep; When, rest o'er all descending, The shores with gladness smile, And lutes, their echoes blending, Are heard from isle to isle, Then, Mary, Star of the Sea One of the titles of the Virgin:—“Maria illuminatrix, sive Stella Maris.” —Isidor. We pray, we pray, to thee! The noon-day tempest over, Now Ocean toils no more, And wings of halcyons hover, Where all was strife before. Oh thus may life, in closing Its short tempestuous day, Beneath heaven's smile reposing, Shine all its storms away: Thus, Mary, Star of the Sea, We pray, we pray, to thee! On Helle's sea the light grew dim, As the last sounds of that sweet hymn Floated along its azure tide— Floated in light, as if the lay Had mix'd with sunset's fading ray, And light and song together died. So soft through evening's air had breath'd That choir of youthful voices, wreath'd In many-linked harmony, That boats, then hurrying o'er the sea, Paused, when they reach'd this fairy shore, And linger'd till the strain was o'er. Of those young maids who've met to fleet In song and dance this evening's hours, Far happier now the bosoms beat, Than when they last adorn'd these bowers; For tidings of glad sound had come, At break of day, from the far isles— Tidings like breath of life to some— That Zea's sons would soon wing home, Crown'd with the light of Victory's smiles To meet that brightest of all meeds That wait on high, heroic deeds, When gentle eyes that scarce, for tears, Could trace the warrior's parting track, Shall, like a misty morn that clears, When the long-absent sun appears, Shine out, all bliss, to hail him back. How fickle still the youthful breast!— More fond of change than a young moon, No joy so new was e'er possest But Youth would leave for newer soon. These Zean nymphs, though bright the spot, Where first they held their evening play, As ever fell to fairy's lot To wanton o'er by midnight's ray, Had now exchanged that shelter'd scene For a wide glade beside the sea— A lawn, whose soft expanse of green Turn'd to the west sun smilingly, As though, in conscious beauty bright, It joy'd to give him light for light. And ne'er did evening more serene Look down from heaven on lovelier scene. Calm lay the flood around, while fleet, O'er the blue shining element, Light barks, as if with fairy feet That stirr'd not the hush'd waters, went; Some that, ere rosy eve fell o'er The blushing wave, with mainsail free, Had put forth from the Attic shore, Or the near Isle of Ebony;— Some, Hydriot barks, that deep in caves Beneath Colonna's pillar'd cliffs, Had all day lurk'd, and o'er the waves Now shot their long and dart-like skiffs. Woe to the craft, however fleet, These sea-hawks in their course shall meet, Laden with juice of Lesbian vines, Or rich from Naxos' emery mines; For not more sure, when owlets flee O'er the dark crags of Pendelee, Doth the night-falcon mark his prey, Or pounce on it more fleet than they. And what a moon now lights the glade Where these young island nymphs are met! Full-orb'd, yet pure, as if no shade Had touch'd its virgin lustre yet; And freshly bright, as if just made By Love's own hands, of new-born light Stol'n from his mother's star to-night. On a bold rock, that o'er the flood Jutted from that soft glade, there stood A Chapel, fronting towards the sea,— Built in some by-gone century,— Where, nightly, as the seaman's mark, When waves rose high or clouds were dark, A lamp, bequeath'd by some kind Saint, Shed o'er the wave its glimmer faint, Waking in way-worn men a sigh And prayer to heaven, as they went by. 'Twas there, around that rock-built shrine, A group of maidens and their sires Had stood to watch the day's decline, And, as the light fell o'er their lyres, Sung to the Queen-Star of the Sea That soft and holy melody. But lighter thoughts and lighter song Now woo the coming hours along. For, mark, where smooth the herbage lies, Yon gay pavilion, curtain'd deep With silken folds, through which, bright eyes, From time to time, are seen to peep; While twinkling lights that, to and fro, Beneath those veils, like meteors, go, Tell of some spells at work, and keep Young fancies chain'd in mute suspense, Watching what next may shine from thence. Nor long the pause, ere hands unseen That mystic curtain backward drew And all, that late but shone between, In half caught gleams, now burst to view. A picture 'twas of the early days Of glorious Greece, ere yet those rays Of rich, immortal Mind were hers That made mankind her worshippers; While, yet unsung, her landscapes shone With glory lent by heaven alone; Nor temples crown'd her nameless hills, Nor Muse immortalised her rills; Nor aught but the mute poesy Of sun, and stars, and shining sea Illumed that land of bards to be. While, prescient of the gifted race That yet would realm so blest adorn, Nature took pains to deck the place Where glorious Art was to be born. Such was the scene that mimic stage Of Athens and her hills portray'd; Athens, in her first, youthful age, Ere yet the simple violet braid “Violet-crowned Athens.” —Pindar., Which then adorn'd her, had shone down The glory of earth's loftiest crown. While yet undream'd, her seeds of Art Lay sleeping in the marble mine— Sleeping till Genius bade them start To all but life, in shapes divine; Till deified the quarry shone And all Olympus stood in stone! There, in the foreground of that scene, On a soft bank of living green, Sate a young nymph, with her lap full Of newly gather'd flowers, o'er which She graceful lean'd, intent to cull All that was there of hue most rich, To form a wreath, such as the eye Of her young lover, who stood by, With pallet mingled fresh, might choose To fix by Painting's rainbow hues. The wreath was form'd; the maiden raised Her speaking eyes to his, while he— Oh not upon the flowers now gaz'd, But on that bright look's witchery. While, quick as if but then the thought, Like light, had reach'd his soul, he caught His pencil up, and, warm and true As life itself, that love-look drew: And, as his raptured task went on, And forth each kindling feature shone, Sweet voices, through the moonlight air, From lips as moonlight fresh and pure, Thus hail'd the bright dream passing there, And sung the Birth of Portraiture. The whole of this scene was suggested by Pliny's account of the artist Pausias and his mistress Glycera, Lib. 35. c. 40. SONG. As once a Grecian maiden wove Her garland mid the summer bowers, There stood a youth, with eyes of love, To watch her while she wreath'd the flowers. The youth was skill'd in Painting's art, But ne'er had studied woman's brow, Nor knew what magic hues the heart Can shed o'er Nature's charms, till now. CHORUS. Blest be Love, whom we owe All that's fair and bright below. His hand had pictured many a rose, And sketch'd the rays that light the brook; But what were these, or what were those, To woman's blush, to woman's look? “Oh, if such magic pow'r there be, “This, this,” he cried, “is all my prayer, “To paint that living light I see, “And fix the soul that sparkles there.” His prayer, as soon as breath'd, was heard; His pallet, touch'd by Love, grew warm, And Painting saw her hues transferr'd From lifeless flowers to woman's form. Still as from tint to tint he stole, The fair design shone out the more, And there was now a life, a soul, Where only colours glow'd before. Then first carnations learn'd to speak, And lilies into life were brought; While, mantling on the maiden's cheek, Young roses kindled into thought. Then hyacinths their darkest dyes Upon the locks of Beauty threw; And violets, transform'd to eyes, Inshrin'd a soul within their blue. CHORUS. Blest be Love, to whom we owe All that's fair and bright below. Song was cold and Painting dim Till song and Painting learn'd from him. Soon as the scene had closed, a cheer Of gentle voices, old and young, Rose from the groups that stood to hear This tale of yore so aptly sung; And while some nymphs, in haste to tell The workers of that fairy spell How crown'd with praise their task had been, Stole in behind the curtain'd scene, The rest, in happy converse stray'd— Talking that ancient love-tale o'er— Some, to the groves that skirt the glade, Some, to the chapel by the shore, To look what lights were on the sea, And think of the' absent silently. But soon that summons, known so well Through bower and hall, in Eastern lands, Whose sound, more sure than gong or bell, Lovers and slaves alike commands,— The clapping of young female hands, Calls back the groups from rock and field To see some new-form'd scene reveal'd;— And fleet and eager, down the slopes Of the green glade, like antelopes, When, in their thirst, they hear the sound Of distant rills, the light nymphs bound. Far different now the scene—a waste Of Libyan sands, by moonlight's ray; An ancient well, whereon were traced, The warning words, for such as stray Unarmed there, “Drink and away!” The traveller Shaw mentions a beautiful rill in Barbary, which is received into a large bason called Shrub wee krub, “Drink and away”—there being great danger of meeting with thieves and assassins, in such places. While, near it, from the night-ray screen'd, And like his bells, in hush'd repose, A camel slept—young as if wean'd When last the star, Canopus, rose. The Arabian shepherd has a peculiar ceremony in weaning the young camel: when the proper time arrives, he turns the camel towards the rising star, Canopus, and says, “Do you see Canopus? from this moment you taste not another drop of milk.” —Richardson. Such was the back-ground's silent scene;— While nearer lay, fast slumbering too, In a rude tent, with brow serene, A youth whose cheeks of way-worn hue And pilgrim-bonnet, told the tale That he had been to Mecca's Vale: Haply in pleasant dreams, ev'n now Thinking the long wish'd hour is come When, o'er the well-known porch at home, His hand shall hang the aloe bough— Trophy of his accomplish'd vow. “Whoever returns from a pilgrimage to Mecca hangs this plant (the mitre-shaped Aloe) over his street door, as a token of his having performed this holy journey.” —Hasselquist. But brief his dream—for now the call Of the camp-chiefs from rear to van, “Bind on your burdens This form of notice to the caravans to prepare for marching was applied by Hafiz to the necessity of relinquishing the pleasures of this world, and preparing for death:—“For me what room is there for pleasure in the bower of Beauty, when every moment the bell makes proclamation, ‘Bind on your burdens?’”,” wakes up all The widely slumbering caravan; And thus meanwhile, to greet the ear Of the young pilgrim as he wakes, The song of one who, lingering near, Had watch'd his slumber, cheerly breaks. SONG. Up and march! the timbrel's sound Wakes the slumb'ring camp around; Fleet thy hour of rest hath gone, Armed sleeper, up, and on! Long and weary is our way O'er the burning sands to day; But to pilgrim's homeward feet Ev'n the desert's path is sweet. When we lie at dead of night, Looking up to heaven's light, Hearing but the watchman's tone Faintly chaunting “God is one The watchmen, in the camp of the caravans, go their rounds, crying one after another, “God is one,” &amp;c. &amp;c.,” Oh what thoughts then o'er us come Of our distant village home, Where that chaunt, when evening sets, Sounds from all the minarets. Cheer thee!—soon shall signal lights, Kindling o'er the Red-Sea heights, Kindling quick from man to man, Hail our coming caravan “It was customary,” says Irwin, “to light up fires on the mountains, within view of Cosseir, to give notice of the approach of the caravans that came from the Nile.”: Think what bliss that hour will be! Looks of home again to see, And our names again to hear Murmur'd out by voices dear. So pass'd the desert dream away, Fleeting as his who heard this lay. Nor long the pause between, nor moved The spell-bound audience from that spot; While still, as usual, Fancy roved On to the joy that yet was not;— Fancy, who hath no present home, But builds her bower in scenes to come, Walking for ever in a light That flows from regions out of sight. But see, by gradual dawn descried, A mountain realm—rugged as e'er Upraised to heav'n its summits bare, Or told to earth, with frown of pride, That Freedom's falcon nest was there, Too high for hand of lord or king To hood her brow, or chain her wing. 'Tis Maina's land—her ancient hills, The abode of nymphs ? virginibus bacchata Laconis Taygeta. Virg.—her countless rills And torrents, in their downward dash, Shining, like silver, through the shade Of the sea-pine and flowering ash— All with a truth so fresh pourtray'd As wants but touch of life to be A world of warm reality. And now, light bounding forth, a band Of mountaineers, all smiles, advance— Nymphs with their lovers, hand in hand, Link'd in the Ariadne dance See, for an account of this dance, De Guy's Travels; And while, apart from that gay throng, A minstrel youth, in varied song, Tells of the loves, the joys, the ills Of these wild children of the hills, The rest by turns, or fierce or gay, As war or sport inspires the lay, Follow each change that wakes the strings, And act what thus the lyrist sings:— SONG. No life is like the mountaineer's, His home is near the sky, Where, throned above this world, he hears Its strife at distance die. Or, should the sound of hostile drum Proclaim below, “We come—we come,” Each crag that towers in air Gives answer, “Come who dare!” While, like bees, from dell and dingle, Swift the swarming warriors mingle, And their cry “Hurra!” will be, “Hurra, to victory!” Then, when battle's hour is over, See the happy mountain lover, With the nymph, who'll soon be bride, Seated blushing by his side,— Every shadow of his lot In her sunny smile forgot. Oh, no life is like the mountaineer's, His home is near the sky, Where, throned above this world, he hears Its strife at distance die. Nor only thus through summer suns His blithe existence cheerly runs— Ev'n winter, bleak and dim, Brings joyous hours to him; When, his rifle behind him flinging, He watches the roe-buck springing, And away, o'er the hills away Re-echoes his glad “hurra.” Then how blest, when night is closing, By the kindled hearth reposing, To his rebeck's drowsy song, He beguiles the hour along; Or, provoked by merry glances, To a brisker movement dances, Till, weary at last, in slumber's chain, He dreams o'er chase and dance again, Dreams, dreams them o'er again. As slow that minstrel, at the close, Sunk, while he sung, to feign'd repose, Aptly did they, whose mimic art Follow'd the changes of his lay, Pourtray the lull, the nod, the start, Through which, as faintly died away His lute and voice, the minstrel pass'd, 'Till voice and lute lay hush'd at last. But now far other song came o'er Their startled ears—song that, at first, As solemnly the night-wind bore Across the wave its mournful burst, Seem'd to the fancy, like a dirge Of some lone Spirit of the Sea, Singing o'er Helle's ancient surge The requiem of her Brave and Free. Sudden, amid their pastime, pause The wondering nymphs; and, as the sound Of that strange music nearer draws, With mute enquiring eye look round, Asking each other what can be The source of this sad minstrelsy? Nor longer can they doubt, the song Comes from some island-bark, which now Courses the bright waves swift along, And soon, perhaps, beneath the brow Of the Saint's Rock will shoot its prow. Instantly all, with hearts that sigh'd 'Twixt fear's and fancy's influence, Flew to the rock, and saw from thence A red-sail'd pinnace tow'rds them glide, Whose shadow, as it swept the spray, Scatter'd the moonlight's smiles away. Soon as the mariners saw that throng From the cliff gazing, young and old, Sudden they slack'd their sail and song, And, while their pinnace idly roll'd On the light surge, these tidings told:— 'Twas from an isle of mournful name, From Missolonghi, last they came— Sad Missolonghi, sorrowing yet O'er him, the noblest Star of Fame That e'er in life's young glory set!— And now were on their mournful way, Wafting the news through Helle's isles;— News that would cloud ev'n Freedom's ray, And sadden Victory 'mid her smiles. Their tale thus told, and heard, with pain, Out spread the galliot's wings again; And, as she sped her swift career, Again that Hymn rose on the ear— “Thou art not dead—thou art not dead!” As oft 'twas sung, in ages flown, Of him, the Athenian, who, to shed A tyrant's blood, pour'd out his own. SONG. Thou art not dead—thou art not dead! ??????? ??????? ???? ????????. No, dearest Harmodius, no. Thy soul, to realms above us fled, Though, like a star, it dwells o'er head, Still lights this world below. Thou art not dead—thou art not dead! No, dearest Harmodius, no. Through isles of light, where heroes tread And flowers ethereal blow, Thy god-like Spirit now is led, Thy lip, with life ambrosial fed, Forgets all taste of woe. Thou art not dead—thou art not dead! No, dearest Harmodius, no. The myrtle, round that falchion spread Which struck the immortal blow, Throughout all time, with leaves unshed— The patriot's hope, the tyrant's dread— Round Freedom's shrine shall grow. Thou art not dead—thou art not dead! No, dearest Harmodius, no. Where hearts like thine have broke or bled, Though quench'd the vital glow, Their memory lights a flame, instead, Which, ev'n from out the narrow bed Of death its beams shall throw. Thou art not dead—thou art not dead! No, dearest Harmodius, no. Thy name, by myriads sung and said, From age to age shall go, Long as the oak and ivy wed, As bees shall haunt Hymettus' head, Or Helle's waters flow. Thou art not dead—thou art not dead! No, dearest Harmodius, no. 'Mong those who linger'd listening there,— Listening, with ear and eye, as long As breath of night could tow'rds them bear A murmur of that mournful song,— A few there were, in whom the lay Had call'd up feelings far too sad To pass with the brief strain away, Or turn at once to theme more glad; And who, in mood untuned to meet The light laugh of the happier train, Wander'd to seek some moonlight seat Where they might rest, in converse sweet, Till vanish'd smiles should come again. And seldom e'er hath noon of night To sadness lent more soothing light. On one side, in the dark blue sky, Lonely and radiant, was the eye Of Jove himself, while, on the other, 'Mong tiny stars that round her gleam'd, The young moon, like the Roman mother Among her living “jewels,” beamed. Touch'd by the lovely scenes around, A pensive maid—one who, though young, Had known what 'twas to see unwound The ties by which her heart had clung— Waken'd her soft tamboura's sound, And to its faint accords thus sung:— SONG. Calm as, beneath its mother's eyes, In sleep the smiling infant lies, So, watch'd by all the stars of night, Yon landscape sleeps in light. And while the night-breeze dies away, Like relics of some faded strain, Loved voices, lost for many a day, Seem whispering round again. Oh youth! oh love! ye dreams, that shed Such glory once—where are ye fled? Pure ray of light that, down the sky, Art pointing, like an angel's wand, As if to guide to realms that lie In that bright sea beyond: Who knows but, in some brighter deep Than even that tranquil, moon-lit main, Some land may lie, where those who weep Shall wake to smile again! With cheeks that had regain'd their power And play of smiles,—and each bright eye, Like violets after morning's shower, The brighter for the tears gone by, Back to the scene such smiles should grace These wandering nymphs their path retrace, And reach the spot, with rapture new, Just as the veils asunder flew, And a fresh vision burst to view. There, by her own bright Attic flood, The blue-ey'd Queen of Wisdom stood;— Not as she haunts the sage's dreams, With brow unveil'd, divine, severe; But soften'd, as on bards she beams, When fresh from Poesy's high sphere, A music, not her own, she brings, And, through the veil which Fancy flings Oer her stern features, gently sings. But who is he—that urchin nigh, With quiver on the rose-trees hung, Who seems just dropp'd from yonder sky, And stands to watch that maid, with eye So full of thought, for one so young?— That child—but, silence! lend thine ear, And thus in song the tale thou'lt hear:— SONG. As Love, one summer eve, was straying, Who should he see, at that soft hour, But young Minerva, gravely playing Her flute within an olive bower. I need not say, 'tis Love's opinion That, grave or merry, good or ill, The sex all bow to his dominion, As woman will be woman still. Though seldom yet the boy hath given To learned dames his smiles or sighs, So handsome Pallas look'd, that even, Love quite forgot the maid was wise. Besides, a youth of his discerning Knew well that, by a shady rill, At sunset hour, whate'er her learning, A woman will be woman still. Her flute he praised in terms extatic,— Wishing it dumb, nor cared how soon;— For Wisdom's notes, howe'er chromatic, To Love seem always out of tune. But long as he found face to flatter. The nymph found breath to shake and thrill; As, weak or wise—it doesn't matter— Woman, at heart, is woman still. Love changed his plan, with warmth exclaiming, “How rosy was her lips' soft dye!” And much that flute, the flatterer, blaming, For twisting lips so sweet awry. The nymph look'd down, beheld her features Reflected in the passing rill, And started, shock'd—for, ah, ye creatures! Ev'n when divine, you're women still. Quick from the lips it made so odious, That graceless flute the Goddess took, And, while yet fill'd with breath melodious, Flung it into the glassy brook; Where, as its vocal life was fleeting Adown the current, faint and shrill, 'Twas heard in plaintive tone repeating, “Woman, alas, vain woman still!” An interval of dark repose— Such as the summer lightning knows, 'Twixt flash and flash, as still more bright The quick revealment comes and goes, Opening each time the veils of night, To show, within, a world of light— Such pause, so brief, now pass'd between This last gay vision and the scene, Which now its depth of light disclosed. A bower it seem'd, an Indian bower, Within whose shade a nymph reposed, Sleeping away noon's sunny hour— Lovely as she, the Sprite, who weaves Her mansion of sweet Durva leaves, And there, as Indian legends say, Dreams the long summer hours away. And mark, how charm'd this sleeper seems With some hid fancy—she, too, dreams! Oh for a wizard's art to tell The wonders that now bless her sight! 'Tis done—a truer, holier spell Than e'er from wizard's lip yet fell Thus brings her vision all to light:— SONG. “Who comes so gracefully “Gliding along, “While the blue rivulet “Sleeps to her song; “Song, richly vying “With the faint sighing “Which swans, in dying, “Sweetly prolong?” So sung the shepherd-boy By the stream's side, Watching that fairy boat Down the flood glide, Like a bird winging, Through the waves bringing That Syren, singing To the hush'd tide. “Stay,” said the shepherd-boy, “Fairy-boat, stay, “Linger, sweet minstrelsy, “Linger, a day.” But vain his pleading, Past him, unheeding, Song and boat, speeding, Glided away. So to our youthful eyes Joy and hope shone; So, while we gazed on them, Fast they flew on;— Like flowers, declining Ev'n in the twining, One moment shining, And, the next, gone! Soon as the imagined dream went by, Uprose the nymph, with anxious eye Turn'd to the clouds, as though some boon She waited from that sun-bright dome, And marvell'd that it came not soon As her young thoughts would have it come. But joy is in her glance!—the wing Of a white bird is seen above; And oh, if round his neck he bring The long-wish'd tidings from her love, Not half so precious in her eyes Ev'n that high-omen'd bird The Huma. would be, Who dooms the brow o'er which he flies To wear a crown of Royalty. She had herself, last evening, sent A winged messenger, whose flight Through the clear, roseate element, She watch'd till, lessening out of sight, Far to the golden West it went, Wafting to him, her distant love, A missive in that language wrought Which flowers can speak, when aptly wove, Each hue a word, each leaf a thought. And now—oh speed of pinion, known To Love's light messengers alone!— Ere yet another evening takes Its farewell of the golden lakes, She sees another envoy fly, With the wish'd answer, through the sky. SONG. Welcome, sweet bird, through the sunny air winging, Swift has thou come o'er the far-shining sea, Like Seba's dove, on thy snowy neck bringing Love's written vows from my lover to me. Oh, in thy absence, what hours did I number!— Saying oft, “Idle bird, how could he rest?” But thou art come at last, take now thy slumber, And lull thee in dreams of all thou lov'st best. Yet dost thou droop—even now while I utter Love's happy welcome, thy pulse dies away; Cheer thee, my bird—were it life's ebbing flutter, This fondling bosom should woo it to stay. But no—thou'rt dying—thy last task is over— Farewell, sweet martyr to Love and to me! The smiles thou hast waken'd by news from my lover, Will now all be turn'd into weeping for thee. While thus this scene of song (their last For the sweet summer season) pass'd, A few presiding nymphs, whose care Watch'd over all, invisibly, As do those guardian sprites of air, Whose watch we feel, but cannot see, Had from the circle—scarcely missed, Ere they were sparkling there again— Glided, like fairies, to assist Their handmaids on the moonlight plain, Where, hid by intercepting shade From the stray glance of curious eyes, A feast of fruits and wines was laid— Soon to shine out, a glad surprise! And now the moon, her ark of light Steering through Heav'n, as tho' she bore In safety through that deep of night, Spirits of earth, the good, the bright, To some remote immortal shore, Had half-way sped her glorious way, When, round reclined on hillocks green, In groups, beneath that tranquil ray, The Zeans at their feast were seen. Gay was the picture—every maid Whom late the lighted scene display'd, Still in her fancy garb array'd;— The Arabian pilgrim, smiling here Beside the nymph of India's sky; While there the Mainiote mountaineer Whisper'd in young Minerva's ear, And urchin Love stood laughing by. Meantime the elders round the board, By mirth and wit themselves made young, High cups of juice Zacynthian pour'd, And, while the flask went round, thus sung:— SONG. Up with the sparkling brimmer, Up to the crystal rim; Let not a moon-beam glimmer 'Twixt the flood and brim. When hath the world set eyes on Aught to match this light, Which, o'er our cup's horizon, Dawns in bumpers bright? Truth in a deep well lieth— So the wise aver: But Truth the fact denieth— Water suits not her. No, her abode's in brimmers. Like this mighty cup— Waiting till we, good swimmers, Dive to bring her up. Thus circled round the song of glee, And all was tuneful mirth the while, Save on the cheeks of some, whose smile, As fix'd they gaze upon the sea, Turns into paleness suddenly! What see they there? a bright blue light That, like a meteor, gliding o'er The distant wave, grows on the sight, As though 'twere wing'd to Zea's shore. To some, 'mong those who came to gaze, It seem'd the night-light, far away, Of some lone fisher, by the blaze Of pine torch, luring on his prey; While others, as, 'twixt awe and mirth, They breath'd the bless'd Panaya's The name which the Greeks give to the Virgin Mary. name, Vow'd that such light was not of earth, But of that drear, ill-omen'd flame, Which mariners see on sail or mast, When Death is coming in the blast. While marvelling thus they stood, a maid, Who sate apart, with downcast eye, Nor yet had, like the rest, surveyed That coming light which now was nigh, Soon as it met her sight, with cry Of pain-like joy, “'Tis he! 'tis he!” Loud she exclaim'd, and, hurrying by The assembled throng, rush'd tow'rds the sea. At burst so wild, alarm'd, amazed, All stood, like statues, mute, and gazed Into each other's eyes, to seek What meant such mood, in maid so meek? Till now, the tale was known to few, But now from lip to lip it flew:— A youth, the flower of all the band, Who late had left this sunny shore, When last he kiss'd that maiden's hand, Lingering, to kiss it o'er and o'er, By his sad brow too plainly told The' ill-omen'd thought which cross'd him then, That once those hands should lose their hold, They ne'er would meet on earth again! In vain his mistress, sad as he, But with a heart from Self as free As generous woman's only is, Veil'd her own fears to banish his:— With frank rebuke, but still more vain, Did a rough warrior, who stood by, Call to his mind this martial strain, His favourite once, ere Beauty's eye Had taught his soldier-heart to sigh:— SONG. March! nor heed those arms that hold thee, Though so fondly close they come; Closer still will they enfold thee, When thou bring'st fresh laurels home. Dost thou dote on woman's brow? Dost thou live but in her breath? March!—one hour of victory now Wins thee woman's smile till death. Oh what bliss, when war is over, Beauty's long-miss'd smile to meet, And, when wreaths our temples cover, Lay them shining at her feet. Who would not, that hour to reach, Breathe out life's expiring sigh,— Proud as waves that on the beach Lay their war-crests down, and die. There! I see thy soul is burning— She herself, who clasps thee so, Paints, ev'n now, thy glad returning, And, while clasping, bids thee go. One deep sigh, to passion given, One last glowing tear and then— March!—nor rest thy sword, till Heaven Brings thee to those arms again. Even then, e'er loth their hands could part, A promise the youth gave, which bore Some balm unto the maiden's heart, That, soon as the fierce fight was o'er, To home he'd speed, if safe and free— Nay, ev'n if dying, still would come, So the blest word of “Victory!” Might be the last he'd breathe at home. “By day,” he cried, “thou'lt know my bark; “But, should I come through midnight dark, “A blue light on the prow shall tell “That Greece hath won, and all is well!” Fondly the maiden, every night, Had stolen to seek that promised light; Nor long her eyes had now been turn'd From watching, when the signal burn'd. Signal of joy—for her, for all— Fleetly the boat now nears the land, While voices, from the shore-edge, call For tidings of the long-wish'd band. Oh the blest hour, when those who've been Through peril's paths by land or sea, Lock'd in our arms again are seen Smiling in glad security; When heart to heart we fondly strain, Questioning quickly o'er and o'er— Then hold them off, to gaze again, And ask, though answer'd oft before, If they, indeed, are ours once more? Such is the scene, so full of joy, Which welcomes now this warrior-boy, As fathers, sisters, friends all run Bounding to meet him—all but one, Who, slowest on his neck to fall, Is yet the happiest of them all. And now behold him, circled round With beaming faces, at that board, While cups, with laurel foliage crown'd, Are to the coming warriors pour'd— Coming, as he, their herald, told, With blades from victory scarce yet cold, With hearts untouch'd by Moslem steel, And wounds that home's sweet breath will heal. “Ere morn,” said he,—and, while he spoke, Turn'd to the east, where, clear, and pale, The star of dawn already broke— “We'll greet, on yonder wave, their sail!” Then, wherefore part? all, all agree To wait them here, beneath this bower; And thus, while even amidst their glee, Each eye is turn'd to watch the sea, With song they cheer the anxious hour. SONG. “'Tis the Vine! 'tis the Vine!” said the cup-loving boy, As he saw it spring bright from the earth, And call'd the young Genii of Wit, Love, and Joy, To witness and hallow its birth. The fruit was full grown, like a ruby it flamed Till the sun-beam that kiss'd it look'd pale: “'Tis the Vine! 'tis the Vine!” ev'ry Spirit exclaim'd, “Hail, hail to the Wine-tree, all hail!” First, fleet as a bird, to the summons Wit flew, While a light on the vine-leaves there broke, In flashes so quick and so brilliant, all knew 'Twas the light from his lips as he spoke. “Bright tree! let thy nectar but cheer me,” he cried, “And the fount of Wit never can fail:” “'Tis the Vine! 'tis the Vine!” hills and valleys reply, “Hail, hail to the Wine-tree, all hail!” Next, Love, as he lean'd o'er the plant to admire Each tendril and cluster it wore, From his rosy mouth sent such a breath of desire, As made the tree tremble all o'er. Oh, never did flower of the earth, sea, or sky, Such a soul-giving odour inhale: “'Tis the Vine! 'tis the Vine!” all re-echo the cry, “Hail, hail to the Wine-tree, all hail!” Last, Joy, without whom even Love and Wit die, Came to crown the bright hour with his ray; And scarce had that mirth-waking tree met his eye, When a laugh spoke what Joy could not say;— A laugh of the heart, which was echoed around Till, like music, it swell'd on the gale; “'Tis the Vine! 'tis the Vine!” laughing myriads resound, “Hail, hail to the Wine-tree, all hail!” LEGENDARY BALLADS. TO THE MISS FEILDINGS, THIS VOLUME IS INSCRIBED, BY THEIR FAITHFUL FRIEND AND SERVANT, THOMAS MOORE. THE VOICE. It came o'er her sleep, like a voice of those days, When love, only love, was the light of her ways; And, soft as in moments of bliss long ago, It whisper'd her name from the garden below. “Alas,” sigh'd the maiden, “how fancy can cheat! “The world once had lips that could whisper thus sweet; “But cold now they slumber in yon fatal deep, “Where, oh that beside them this heart too could sleep!” She sunk on her pillow—but no, 'twas in vain To chase the illusion, that Voice came again! She flew to the casement—but, hush'd as the grave, In moonlight lay slumbering woodland and wave. “Oh sleep, come and shield me,” in anguish she said, “From that call of the buried, that cry of the Dead!” And sleep came around her—but, starting, she woke, For still from the garden that spirit Voice spoke! “I come,” she exclaimed, “be thy home where it may, “On earth or in heaven, that call I obey;” Then forth through the moonlight, with heart beating fast And loud as a death-watch, the pale maiden past. Still round her the scene all in loneliness shone; And still, in the distance, that Voice led her on; But whither she wander'd, by wave or by shore, None ever could tell, for she came back no more. No, ne'er came she back,—but the watchman who stood, That night, in the tower which o'ershadows the flood, Saw dimly, 'tis said, o'er the moon-lighted spray, A youth on a steed bear the maiden away. CUPID AND PSYCHE. They told her that he, to whose vows she had listen'd Through night's fleeting hours, was a Spirit unblest;— Unholy the eyes, that beside her had glisten'd, And evil the lips she in darkness had prest. “When next in thy chamber the bridegroom reclineth, “Bring near him thy lamp, when in slumber he lies; “And there, as the light o'er his dark features shineth, “Thou'lt see what a demon hath won all thy sighs!” Too fond to believe them, yet doubting, yet fearing, When calm lay the sleeper she stole with her light; And saw—such a vision!—no image, appearing To bards in their day-dreams, was ever so bright. A youth, but just passing from childhood's sweet morning, While round him still linger'd its innocent ray; Though gleams, from beneath his shut eyelids gave warning Of summer-noon lightnings that under them lay. His brow had a grace more than mortal around it, While, glossy as gold from a fairy-land mine, His sunny hair hung, and the flowers that crown'd it Seem'd fresh from the breeze of some garden divine. Entranced stood the bride, on that miracle gazing, What late was but love is idolatry now; But, ah—in her tremor the fatal lamp raising— A sparkle flew from it and dropp'd on his brow. All's lost—with a start from his rosy sleep waking, The Spirit flash'd o'er her his glances of fire; Then, slow from the clasp of her snowy arms breaking, Thus said, in a voice more of sorrow than ire: “Farewell—what a dream thy suspicion hath broken! “Thus ever Affection's fond vision is crost; “Dissolved are her spells when a doubt is but spoken, “And love, once distrusted, for ever is lost!” HERO AND LEANDER. “The night-wind is moaning with mournful sigh, “There gleameth no moon in the misty sky, “No star over Helle's sea; “Yet, yet, there is shining one holy light, “One love-kindled star through the deep of night, “To lead me, sweet Hero, to thee!” Thus saying, he plunged in the foamy stream, Still fixing his gaze on that distant beam No eye but a lover's could see; And still, as the surge swept over his head, “To-night,” he said tenderly, “living or dead, “Sweet Hero, I'll rest with thee!” But fiercer around him the wild waves speed; Oh, Love! in that hour of thy votary's need, Where, where could thy Spirit be? He struggles—he sinks—while the hurricane's breath Bears rudely away his last farewell in death— “Sweet Hero, I die for thee!” THE LEAF AND THE FOUNTAIN. “Tell me, kind Seer, I pray thee, “So may the stars obey thee, “So may each airy “Moon-elf and fairy “Nightly their homage pay thee! “Say, by what spell, above, below, “In stars that wink or flowers that blow, “I may discover, “Ere night is over, “Whether my love loves me, or no, “Whether my love loves me.” “Maiden, the dark tree nigh thee “Hath charms no gold could buy thee; “Its stem enchanted, “By moon-elves planted, “Will all thou seek'st supply thee. “Climb to yon boughs that highest grow, “Bring thence their fairest leaf below; “And thou'lt discover, “Ere night is over, “Whether thy love loves thee or no, “Whether thy love loves thee.” “See, up the dark tree going, “With blossoms round me blowing, “From thence, oh Father, “This leaf I gather, “Fairest that there is growing. “Say, by what sign I now shall know “If in this leaf lie bliss or woe “And thus discover “Ere night is over, “Whether my love loves me or no, “Whether my love loves me.” “Fly to yon fount that's welling “Where moonbeam ne'er had dwelling, “Dip in its water “That leaf, oh Daughter, “And mark the tale 'tis telling The ancients had a mode of divination somewhat similar to this; and we find the Emperor Adrian, when he went to consult the Fountain of Castalia, plucking a bay-leaf and dipping it into the sacred water.; “Watch thou if pale or bright it grow, “List thou, the while, that fountain's flow, “And thou'lt discover “Whether thy lover, “Loved as he is, loves thee or no, “Loved as he is, loves thee.” Forth flew the nymph, delighted, To seek that fount benighted; But, scarce a minute The leaf lay in it, When, lo, its bloom was blighted! And as she ask'd, with voice of woe— Listening, the while, that fountain's flow— “Shall I recover “My truant lover?” The fountain seem'd to answer, “No;” The fountain answered, “No.” CEPHALUS AND PROCRIS. A hunter once in that grove reclined, To shun the noon's bright eye, And oft he wooed the wandering wind, To cool his brow with its sigh. While mute lay even the wild bee's hum, Nor breath could stir the aspen's hair, His song was still “Sweet air, oh come!” While Echo answered, “Come, sweet Air!” But, hark, what sounds from the thicket rise! What meaneth that rustling spray? “'Tis the white-horn'd doe,” the Hunter cries, “I have sought since break of day.” Quick o'er the sunny glade he springs, The arrow flies from his sounding bow, “Hilliho—hilliho!” he gaily sings, While Echo sighs forth “Hilliho!” Alas, 'twas not the white-horn'd doe He saw in the rustling grove, But the bridal veil, as pure as snow, Of his own young wedded love. And, ah, too sure that arrow sped, For pale at his feet he sees her lie;— “I die, I die,” was all she said, While Echo murmur'd, “I die, I die!” YOUTH AND AGE. The air, to which I have adapted these words, was composed by Mrs. Arkwright to some old verses, “Tell me what's love, kind shepherd, pray?” and it has been my object to retain as much of the structure and phraseology of the original words as possible. “Tell me, what's Love?” said Youth, one day, To drooping Age, who crost his way.— “It is a sunny hour of play, “For which repentance dear doth pay; “Repentance! Repentance! “And this is Love, as wise men say.” “Tell me, what's Love?” said Youth once more, Fearful, yet fond, of Age's lore.— “Soft as a passing summer's wind, “Would'st know the blight it leaves behind? “Repentance! Repentance! “And this is Love—when love is o'er.” “Tell me, what's Love?” said Youth again, Trusting the bliss, but not the pain. “Sweet as a May tree's scented air— “Mark ye what bitter fruit 'twill bear, “Repentance! Repentance! “This, this is Love—sweet Youth, beware.” Just then, young Love himself came by, And cast on Youth a smiling eye; Who could resist that glance's ray? In vain did Age his warning say, “Repentance! Repentance!” Youth laughing went with Love away. THE DYING WARRIOR. A wounded Chieftain, lying By the Danube's leafy side, Thus faintly said, in dying, “Oh! bear, thou foaming tide, “This gift to my lady-bride.” 'Twas then, in life's last quiver, He flung the scarf he wore Into the foaming river, Which, ah too quickly, bore That pledge of one no more! With fond impatience burning, The Chieftain's lady stood, To watch her love returning In triumph down the flood, From that day's field of blood. But, field, alas, ill-fated! The lady saw, instead Of the bark whose speed she waited, Her hero's scarf, all red With the drops his heart had shed. One shriek—and all was over— Her life-pulse ceased to beat; The gloomy waves now cover That bridal-flower so sweet, And the scarf is her winding sheet! THE MAGIC MIRROR. “Come, if thy magic Glass have power “To call up forms we sigh to see; “Show me my love, in that rosy bower, “Where last she pledged her truth to me.” The Wizard show'd him his Lady bright, Where lone and pale in her bow'r she lay; “True-hearted maid,” said the happy Knight, “She's thinking of one, who is far away.” But, lo! a page, with looks of joy, Brings tidings to the Lady's ear; “'Tis,” said the Knight, “the same bright boy, “Who used to guide me to my dear.” The Lady now, from her fav'rite tree, Hath, smiling, pluck'd a rosy flower; “Such,” he exclaim'd, “was the gift that she “Each morning sent me from that bower!” She gives her page the blooming rose, With looks that say, “Like lightning, fly!” “Thus,” thought the Knight, “she soothes her woes, “By fancying, still, her true-love nigh.” But the page returns, and—oh, what a sight, For trusting lover's eyes to see!— Leads to that bower another Knight, As young and, alas, as loved as he! “Such,” quoth the Youth, “is Woman's love!” Then, darting forth, with furious bound, Dash'd at the Mirror his iron glove, And strew'd it all in fragments round. MORAL. Such ills would never have come to pass, Had he ne'er sought that fatal view; The Wizard would still have kept his Glass, And the Knight still thought his Lady true. THE PILGRIM. Still thus, when twilight gleam'd, Far off his Castle seem'd, Traced on the sky; And still, as fancy bore him To those dim towers before him, He gazed, with wishful eye, And thought his home was nigh. “Hall of my Sires!” he said, “How long, with weary tread, “Must I toil on? “Each eve, as thus I wander, “Thy towers seem rising yonder, “But, scarce hath daylight shone, “When, like a dream, thou'rt gone!” So went the Pilgrim still, Down dale and over hill, Day after day; That glimpse of home, so cheering, At twilight still appearing, But still, with morning's ray, Melting, like mist, away! Where rests the Pilgrim now? Here, by this cypress bough, Closed his career; That dream, of fancy's weaving, No more his steps deceiving, Alike past hope and fear, The Pilgrim's home is here. THE HIGH-BORN LADYE. In vain all the Knights of the Underwald wooed her, Tho' brightest of maidens, the proudest was she; Brave chieftains they sought, and young minstrels they sued her, But worthy were none of the high-born Ladye. “Whomsoever I wed,” said this maid, so excelling, “That Knight must the conqu'ror of conquerors be; “He must place me in halls fit for monarchs to dwell in;— “None else shall be Lord of the high-born Ladye!” Thus spoke the proud damsel, with scorn looking round her On Knights and on Nobles of highest degree; Who humbly and hopelessly left as they found her, And worshipp'd at distance the high-born Ladye. At length came a Knight, from a far land to woo her, With plumes on his helm like the foam of the sea; His vizor was down—but, with voice that thrill'd through her, He whisper'd his vows to the high-born Ladye. “Proud maiden! I come with high spousals to grace thee, “In me the great conqu'ror of conquerors see; “Enthroned in a hall fit for monarchs I'll place thee, “And mine thou'rt for ever, thou high-born Ladye!” The maiden she smiled, and in jewels array'd her, Of thrones and tiaras already dreamt she; And proud was the step, as her bridegroom convey'd her In pomp to his home, of that high-born Ladye. “But whither,” she, starting, exclaims, “have you led me? “Here's nought but a tomb and a dark cypress tree; “Is this the bright palace in which thou wouldst wed me?” With scorn in her glance said the high-born Ladye. “'Tis the home,” he replied, “of earth's loftiest creatures”— Then lifted his helm for the fair one to see; But she sunk on the ground—'twas a skeleton's features, And Death was the Lord of the high-born Ladye! THE INDIAN BOAT. 'Twas midnight dark, The seaman's bark, Swift o'er the waters bore him, When, through the night, He spied a light Shoot o'er the wave before him. “A sail! a sail!” he cries, “She comes from the Indian shore, “And to-night shall be our prize, “With her freight of golden ore: “Sail on! sail on!” When morning shone He saw the gold still clearer; But, though so fast The waves he pass'd, That boat seem'd never the nearer. Bright daylight came, And still the same Rich bark before him floated; While on the prize His wishful eyes Like any young lover's doated: “More sail! more sail!” he cries, While the waves o'ertop the mast; And his bounding galley flies, Like an arrow before the blast. Thus on, and on, Till day was gone, And the moon through heaven did hie her, He swept the main, But all in vain, That boat seem'd never the nigher And many a day To night gave way, And many a morn succeeded: While still his flight, Through day and night, That restless mariner speeded. Who knows—who knows what seas He is now careering o'er? Behind, the eternal breeze, And that mocking bark, before! For, oh, till sky And earth shall die, And their death leave none to rue it, That boat must flee O'er the boundless sea, And that ship in vain pursue it. THE STRANGER. Come list, while I tell of the heart-wounded Stranger Who sleeps her last slumber in this haunted ground; Where often, at midnight, the lonely wood-ranger Hears soft fairy music re-echo around. None e'er knew the name of that heart-stricken lady, Her language, though sweet, none could e'er understand; But her features so sunn'd, and her eyelash so shady, Bespoke her a child of some far Eastern land. 'Twas one summer night, when the village lay sleeping, A soft strain of melody came o'er our ears; So sweet, but so mournful, half song and half weeping, Like music that Sorrow had steep'd in her tears. We thought 'twas an anthem some angel had sung us;— But, soon as the day—beams had gush'd from on high, With wonder we saw this bright stranger among us, All lovely and lone, as if stray'd from the sky. Nor long did her life for this sphere seem intended, For pale was her check, with that spirit-like hue, Which comes when the day of this world is nigh ended, And light from another already shines through. Then her eyes, when she sung—oh, but once to have seen them— Left thoughts in the soul that can never depart; While her looks and her voice made a language between them, That spoke more than holiest words to the heart. But she pass'd like a day-dream, no skill could restore her— Whate'er was her sorrow, its ruin came fast; She died with the same spell of mystery o'er her, That song of past days on her lips to the last. Nor ev'n in the grave is her sad heart reposing— Still hovers the spirit of grief round her tomb; For oft, when the shadows of midnight are closing, The same strain of music is heard through the gloom. A MELOLOGUE UPON NATIONAL MUSIC. A short Strain of Music from the Orchestra. There breathes a language, known and felt Far as the pure air spreads its living zone; Wherever rage can rouse, or pity melt, That language of the soul is felt and known. From those meridian plains, Where oft, of old, on some high tower, The soft Peruvian pour'd his midnight strains, And call'd his distant love with such sweet power, That, when she heard the lonely lay, Not worlds could keep her from his arms away “A certain Spaniard, one night late, met an Indian woman in the streets of Cozco, and would have taken her to his home, but she cried out, ‘For God's sake, Sir, let me go; for that pipe, which you hear in yonder tower, calls me with great passion, and I cannot refuse the summons; for love constrains me to go, that I may be his wife, and he my husband.’” —Garcilasso de la Véga, in Sir Paul Rycaut's translation., To the bleak climes of polar night, Where blithe, beneath a sunless sky, The Lapland lover bids his rein-deer fly, And sings along the lengthening waste of snow, Gaily as if the blessed light Of vernal Phœbus burn'd upon his brow; Oh Music! thy celestial claim Is still resistless, still the same; And, faithful as the mighty sea To the pale star that o'er its realm presides, The spell-bound tides Of human passion rise and fall for thee! Greek Air. List! 'tis a Grecian maid that sings, While, from Ilissus' silvery springs, She draws the cool lymph in her graceful urn; And by her side, in Music's charm dissolving, Some patriot youth, the glorious past revolving, Dreams of bright days that never can return; When Athens nursed her olive bough, With hands by tyrant power unchain'd; And braided for the muse's brow A wreath by tyrant touch unstain'd. When heroes trod each classic field Where coward feet now faintly falter; When every arm was Freedom's shield, And every heart was Freedom's altar! Flourish of Trumpets. Hark, 'tis the sound that charms The war-steed's wakening ears!— Oh! many a mother folds her arms Round her boy-soldier when that call she hears; And, though her fond heart sink with fears, Is proud to feel his young pulse bound With valour's fever at the sound. See, from his native hills afar The rude Helvetian flies to war; Careless for what, for whom he fights, For slave or despot, wrongs or rights; A conqueror oft—a hero never— Yet lavish of his life-blood still, As if 'twere like his mountain rill, And gush'd for ever! Yes, Music, here, even here, Amid this thoughtless, vague career, Thy soul-felt charm asserts its wondrous power.— There's a wild air which oft, among the rocks Of his own loved land, at evening hour, Is heard, when shepherds homeward pipe their flocks, Whose every note hath power to thrill his mind With tenderest thoughts; to bring around his knees The rosy children whom he left behind, And fill each little angel eye With speaking tears, that ask him why He wander'd from his hut for scenes like these. Vain, vain is then the trumpet's brazen roar; Sweet notes of home, of love, are all he hears; And the stern eyes, that look'd for blood before, Now melting, mournful, lose themselves in tears. Swiss Air.—“Ranz des Vaches.” But, wake the trumpet's blast again, And rouse the ranks of warrior-men! Oh War, when Truth thy arm employs, And Freedom's spirit guides the labouring storm, 'Tis then thy vengeance takes a hallow'd form, And, like Heaven's lightning, sacredly destroys. Nor, Music, through thy breathing sphere, Lives there a sound more grateful to the ear Of Him who made all harmony, Than the bless'd sound of fetters breaking, And the first hymn that man, awaking From Slavery's slumber, breathes to Liberty. Spanish Chorus. Hark! from Spain, indignant Spain, Bursts the bold, enthusiast strain, Like morning's music on the air; And seems, in every note, to swear By Saragossa's ruin'd streets, By brave Gerona's deathful story, That, while one Spaniard's life-blood beats, That blood shall stain the conqueror's glory. Spanish Air.—“Ya Desperto.” But ah! if vain the patriot's zeal, If neither valour's force nor wisdom's light Can break or melt that blood-cemented seal, Which shuts so close the book of Europe's right— What song shall then in sadness tell Of broken pride, of prospects shaded, Of buried hopes, remember'd well, Of ardour quench'd, and honour faded? What muse shall mourn the breathless brave, In sweetest dirge at Memory's shrine? What harp shall sigh o'er Freedom's grave? Oh Erin, Thine! SET OF GLEES. MUSIC BY MOORE. THE MEETING OF THE SHIPS. When o'er the silent seas alone, For days and nights we've cheerless gone, Oh they who've felt it know how sweet, Some sunny morn a sail to meet. Sparkling at once is ev'ry eye, “Ship ahoy!” our joyful cry; While answering back the sounds we hear, “Ship ahoy!” what cheer? what cheer? Then sails are back'd, we nearer come, Kind words are said of friends and home; And soon, too soon, we part with pain, To sail o'er silent seas again. HIP, HIP, HURRAH! Come, fill round a bumper, fill up to the brim, He who shrinks from a bumper I pledge not to him; Here's the girl that each loves, be her eye of what hue, Or lustre, it may, so her heart is but true. Charge! (drinks) hip, hip, hurra, hurra! Come charge high, again, boy, nor let the full wine Leave a space in the brimmer, where daylight may shine; Here's “the friends of our youth—tho' of some we're bereft, May the links that are lost but endear what are left!” Charge! (drinks) hip, hip, hurra, hurra! Once more fill a bumper—ne'er talk of the hour; On hearts thus united old Time has no pow'r. May our lives, tho', alas! like the wine of to-night, They must soon have an end, to the last flow as bright. Charge! (drinks) hip, hip, hurra, hurra! Quick, quick, now, I'll give you, since Time's glass will run Ev'n faster than ours doth, three bumpers in one; Here's the poet who sings—here's the warrior who fights— Here's the statesman who speaks, in the cause of men's rights! Charge! (drinks) hip, hip, hurra, hurra! Come, once more, a bumper!—then drink as you please, Tho', who could fill half-way to toast such as these? Here's our next joyous meeting—and oh when we meet, May our wine be as bright and our union as sweet! Charge! (drinks) hip, hip, hurra, hurra! HUSH, HUSH! “Hush, hush!”—how well That sweet word sounds, When Love, the little sentinel, Walks his night-rounds; Then, if a foot but dare One rose-leaf crush, Myriads of voices in the air Whisper, “Hush, hush!” “Hark, hark, 'tis he!” The night elves cry, And hush their fairy harmony, While he steals by; But if his silv'ry feet One dew-drop brush, Voices are heard in chorus sweet, Whispering, “Hush, hush!” THE PARTING BEFORE THE BATTLE. HE. On to the field, our doom is seal'd, To conquer or be slaves: This sun shall see our nation free, Or set upon our graves. SHE. Farewell, oh farewell, my love, May Heaven thy guardian be, And send bright angels from above To bring thee back to me. HE. On to the field, the battle-field, Where freedom's standard waves, This sun shall see our tyrant yield, Or shine upon our graves. THE WATCHMAN. A TRIO. WATCHMAN. Past twelve o'clock—past twelve. Good night, good night, my dearest— How fast the moments fly! 'Tis time to part, thou hearest That hateful watchman's cry. WATCHMAN. Past one o'clock—past one. Yet stay a moment longer— Alas! why is it so, The wish to stay grows stronger, The more 'tis time to go? WATCHMAN. Past two o'clock—past two. Now wrap thy cloak about thee— The hours must sure go wrong, For when they're past without thee, They're, oh, ten times as long. WATCHMAN. Past three o'clock—past three. Again that dreadful warning! Had ever time such flight? And see the sky, 'tis morning— So now, indeed, good night. WATCHMAN. Past three o'clock—past three. Good night, good night. SAY, WHAT SHALL WE DANCE? Say, what shall we dance? Shall we bound along the moonlight plain, To music of Italy, Greece, or Spain? Say, what shall we dance? Shall we, like those who rove Through bright Grenada's grove, To the light Bolero's measures move? Or choose the Guaracia's languishing lay, And thus to its sound die away? Strike the gay chords, Let us hear each strain from ev'ry shore That music haunts, or young feet wander o'er. Hark! 'tis the light march, to whose measured time, The Polish lady, by her lover led, Delights through gay saloons with step untired to tread, Or sweeter still, through moonlight walks Whose shadows serve to hide The blush that's raised by him who talks Of love the while by her side, Then comes the smooth waltz, to whose floating sound Like dreams we go gliding around, Say, which shall we dance? which shall we dance? THE EVENING GUN. Remember'st thou that setting sun, The last I saw with thee, When loud we heard the evening gun Peal o'er the twilight sea? Boom!—the sounds appear'd to sweep Far o'er the verge of day, Till, into realms beyond the deep, They seem'd to die away. Oft, when the toils of day are done, In pensive dreams of thee, I sit to hear that evening gun, Peal o'er the stormy sea. Boom!—and while, o'er billows curl'd, The distant sounds decay, I weep and wish, from this rough world Like them to die away. BALLADS, SONGS, MISCELLANEOUS POEMS, ETC. TO-DAY, DEAREST! IS OURS. To-day, dearest! is ours; Why should Love carelessly lose it? This life shines or low'rs Just as we, weak mortals, use it. 'Tis time enough, when its flow'rs decay, To think of the thorns of Sorrow; And Joy, if left on the stem to-day, May wither before to-morrow. Then why, dearest! so long Let the sweet moments fly over? Though now, blooming and young, Thou hast me devoutly thy lover, Yet Time from both, in his silent lapse, Some treasure may steal or borrow; Thy charms may be less in bloom, perhaps, Or I less in love to-morrow. WHEN ON THE LIP THE SIGH DELAYS. When on the lip the sigh delays, As if 'twould linger there for ever; When eyes would give the world to gaze, Yet still look down, and venture never; When, though with fairest nymphs we rove, There's one we dream of more than any— If all this is not real love, 'Tis something wond'rous like it, Fanny! To think and ponder, when apart, On all we've got to say at meeting; And yet when near, with heart to heart, Sit mute, and listen to their beating: To see but one bright object move, The only moon, where stars are many— If all this is not downright love, I prithee say what is, my Fanny! When Hope foretells the brightest, best, Though Reason on the darkest reckons; When Passion drives us to the west, Though Prudence to the eastward beckons; When all turns round, below, above, And our own heads the most of any— If this is not stark, staring love, Then you and I are sages, Fanny. HERE, TAKE MY HEART. Here, take my heart—'twill be safe in thy keeping, While I go wand'ring o'er land and o'er sea; Smiling or sorrowing, waking or sleeping, What need I care, so my heart is with thee? If, in the race we are destined to run, love, They who have light hearts the happiest be, Then, happier still must be they who have none, love, And that will be my case when mine is with thee. It matters not where I may now be a rover, I care not how many bright eyes I may see; Should Venus herself come and ask me to love her, I'd tell her I couldn't—my heart is with thee. And there let it lie, growing fonder and fonder— For, even should Fortune turn truant to me, Why, let her go—I've a treasure beyond her, As long as my heart's out at int'rest with thee! OH, CALL IT BY SOME BETTER NAME. Oh, call it by some better name, For Friendship sounds too cold, While Love is now a worldly flame, Whose shrine must be of gold; And Passion, like the sun at noon, That burns o'er all he sees, Awhile as warm, will set as soon— Then, call it none of these. Imagine something purer far, More free from stain of clay Than Friendship, Love, or Passion are, Yet human still as they: And if thy lip, for love like this, No mortal word can frame, Go, ask of angels what it is, And call it by that name! POOR WOUNDED HEART. Poor wounded heart, farewell! Thy hour of rest is come; Thou soon wilt reach thy home, Poor wounded heart, farewell! The pain thou'lt feel in breaking Less bitter far will be, Than that long, deadly aching, This life has been to thee. There—broken heart, farewell! The pang is o'er— The parting pang is o'er; Thou now wilt bleed no more, Poor broken heart, farewell! No rest for thee but dying— Like waves, whose strife is past, On death's cold shore thus lying, Thou sleep'st in peace at last— Poor broken heart, farewell! THE EAST INDIAN. Come, May, with all thy flowers, Thy sweetly-scented thorn, Thy cooling ev'ning showers, Thy fragrant breath at morn: When May-flies haunt the willow, When May-buds tempt the bee, Then o'er the shining billow My love will come to me. From Eastern Isles she's winging Through wat'ry wilds her way, And on her cheek is bringing The bright sun's orient ray: Oh, come and court her hither, Ye breezes mild and warm— One winter's gale would wither So soft, so pure a form. The fields where she was straying Are blest with endless light, With zephyrs always playing Through gardens always bright. Then now, sweet May! be sweeter Than e'er thou'st been before; Let sighs from roses meet her When she comes near our shore. POOR BROKEN FLOWER. Poor broken flow'r! what art can now recover thee? Torn from the stem that fed thy rosy breath— In vain the sun-beams seek To warm that faded cheek; The dews of heav'n, that once like balm fell over thee, Now are but tears, to weep thy early death. So droops the maid whose lover hath forsaken her,— Thrown from his arms, as lone and lost as thou; In vain the smiles of all Like sun-beams round her fall; The only smile that could from death awaken her, That smile, alas! is gone to others now. THE PRETTY ROSE TREE. Being weary of love, I flew to the grove, And chose me a tree of the fairest; Saying, “Pretty Rose-tree, “Thou my mistress shalt be, “And I'll worship each bud thou bearest. “For the hearts of this world are hollow, “And fickle the smiles we follow; “And 'tis sweet, when all “Their witch'ries pall “To have a pure love to fly to: “So, my pretty Rose-tree, “Thou my mistress shalt be, “And the only one now I shall sigh to.” When the beautiful hue Of thy cheek through the dew Of morning is bashfully peeping, “Sweet tears,” I shall say (As I brush them away), “At least there's no art in this weeping.” Although thou shouldst die to-morrow, 'Twill not be from pain or sorrow; And the thorns of thy stem Are not like them With which men wound each other: So my pretty Rose-tree, Thou my mistress shalt be, And I'll ne'er again sigh to another. SHINE OUT, STARS! Shine out, Stars! let Heav'n assemble Round us every festal ray, Lights that move not, lights that tremble, All to grace this Eve of May. Let the flow'r-beds all lie waking, And the odours shut up there, From their downy prisons breaking, Fly abroad through sea and air. And would Love, too, bring his sweetness, With our other joys to weave, Oh what glory, what completeness, Then would crown this bright May Eve! Shine out, Stars! let night assemble Round us every festal ray, Lights that move not, lights that tremble, To adorn this Eve of May. THE YOUNG MULETEERS OF GRENADA. Oh, the joys of our ev'ning posada, Where, resting at close of day, We, young Muleteers of Grenada, Sit and sing the sunshine away; So merry, that even the slumbers, That round us hung, seem gone; Till the lute's soft drowsy numbers Again beguile them on. Oh the joys, &amp;c. Then as each to his lov'd sultana In sleep still breathes the sigh, The name of some black-eyed Tirana Escapes our lips as we lie. Till, with morning's rosy twinkle, Again we're up and gone— While the mule-bell's drowsy tinkle Beguiles the rough way on. Oh the joys of our merry posada, Where, resting at close of day, We, young Muleteers of Grenada, Thus sing the gay moments away. TELL HER, OH, TELL HER. Tell her, oh, tell her, the lute she left lying Beneath the green arbour, is still lying there; And breezes, like lovers, around it are sighing, But not a soft whisper replies to their pray'r. Tell her, oh, tell her, the tree that, in going, Beside the green arbour she playfully set, As lovely as ever is blushing and blowing, And not a bright leaflet has fall'n from it yet. So while away from that arbour forsaken, The maiden is wandering, still let her be As true as the lute, that no sighing can waken, And blooming for ever, unchanged as the tree! NIGHTS OF MUSIC. Nights of music, nights of loving, Lost too soon, remember'd long, When we went by moonlight roving, Hearts all love and lips all song. When this faithful lute recorded All my spirit felt to thee; And that smile the song rewarded— Worth whole years of fame to me! Nights of song, and nights of splendour, Fill'd with joys too sweet to last— Joys that, like the star-light, tender, While they shone, no shadow cast. Though all other happy hours From my fading mem'ry fly, Of that star-light, of those bowers, Not a beam, a leaf shall die! OUR FIRST YOUNG LOVE. Our first young love resembles That short but brilliant ray, Which smiles, and weeps, and trembles Through April's earliest day. And not all life before us, Howe'er its lights may play, Can shed a lustre o'er us Like that first April ray. Our summer sun may squander A blaze serener, grander; Our autumn beam May, like a dream Of heav'n, die calm away; But, no—let life before us Bring all the light it may, 'Twill ne'er shed lustre o'er us Like that first youthful ray. BLACK AND BLUE EYES. The brilliant black eye May in triumph let fly All its darts without caring who feels 'em; But the soft eye of blue, Though it scatter wounds too, Is much better pleased when it heals 'em— Dear Fanny! Is much better pleased when it heals 'em. The black eye may say, “Come and worship my ray— “By adoring, perhaps you may move me!” But the blue eye, half hid, Says, from under its lid, “I love, and am yours, if you love me!” Yes, Fanny! The blue eye, half hid, Says, from under its lid, “I love, and am yours if you love me!” Come tell me, then, why, In that lovely blue eye, Not a charm of its tint I discover; Oh why should you wear The only blue pair That ever said “No” to a lover? Dear Fanny! Oh, why should you wear The only blue pair That ever said “No” to a lover? DEAR FANNY. “She has beauty, but still you must keep your heart cool; “She has wit, but you mustn't be caught so:” Thus Reason advises, but Reason's a fool, And 'tis not the first time I have thought so, Dear Fanny. 'Tis not the first time I have thought so. “She is lovely; then love her, nor let the bliss fly; “'Tis the charm of youth's vanishing season:” Thus Love has advised me, and who will deny That Love reasons much better than Reason, Dear Fanny? Love reasons much better than Reason. FROM LIFE WITHOUT FREEDOM. From life without freedom, say, who would not fly? For one day of freedom, oh! who would not die? Hark!—hark! 'tis the trumpet! the call of the brave, The death-song of tyrants, the dirge of the slave. Our country lies bleeding—haste, haste to her aid; One arm that defends is worth hosts that invade. In death's kindly bosom our last hope remains— The dead fear no tyrants, the grave has no chains. On, on to the combat! the heroes that bleed For virtue and mankind are heroes indeed. And oh, ev'n if Freedom from this world be driven, Despair not—at least we shall find her in heaven. HERE'S THE BOWER. Here's the bower she loved so much, And the tree she planted; Here's the harp she used to touch— Oh, how that touch enchanted! Roses now unheeded sigh; Where's the hand to wreathe them? Songs around neglected lie; Where's the lip to breathe them? Here's the bower, &amp;c. Spring may bloom, but she we loved Ne'er shall feel its sweetness; Time, that once so fleetly moved, Now hath lost its fleetness. Years were days, when here she stray'd, Days were moments near her; Heaven ne'er form'd a brighter maid, Nor Pity wept a dearer! Here's the bower, &amp;c. I SAW THE MOON RISE CLEAR. A FINLAND LOVE SONG. I saw the moon rise clear O'er hills and vales of snow, Nor told my fleet rein-deer The track I wish'd to go. Yet quick he bounded forth; For well my rein-deer knew I've but one path on earth— The path which leads to you. The gloom that winter cast How soon the heart forgets, When Summer brings, at last, Her sun that never sets! So dawn'd my love for you; So, fix'd through joy and pain, Than summer sun more true, 'Twill never set again. LOVE AND THE SUN-DIAL. Young Love found a Dial once, in a dark shade, Where man ne'er had wander'd nor sunbeam play'd; “Why thus in darkness lie?” whisper'd young Love, “Thou, whose gay hours in sunshine should move.” “I ne'er,” said the Dial, “have seen the warm sun, “So noonday and midnight to me, Love, are one.” Then Love took the Dial away from the shade, And placed her where Heav'n's beam warmly play'd. There she reclined, beneath Love's gazing eye, While, mark'd all with sunshine, her hours flew by. “Oh, how,” said the Dial, “can any fair maid, “That's born to be shone upon, rest in the shade?” But night now comes on, and the sunbeam's o'er, And Love stops to gaze on the Dial no more. Alone and neglected, while bleak rain and winds Are storming around her, with sorrow she finds That Love had but number'd a few sunny hours,— Then left the remainder to darkness and showers! LOVE AND TIME. 'Tis said—but whether true or not Let bards declare who've seen 'em— That Love and Time have only got One pair of wings between 'em. In courtship's first delicious hour, The boy full oft can spare 'em; So, loitering in his lady's bower, He lets the grey-beard wear 'em. Then is Time's hour of play; Oh, how he flies, flies away! But short the moments, short as bright, When he the wings can borrow; If Time to-day has had his flight, Love takes his turn to-morrow. Ah! Time and Love, your change is then The saddest and most trying, When one begins to limp again, And t'other takes to flying. Then is Love's hour to stray; Oh, how he flies, flies away! But there's a nymph, whose chains I feel, And bless the silken fetter, Who knows, the dear one, how to deal With Love and Time much better. So well she checks their wanderings, So peacefully she pairs 'em, That Love with her ne'er thinks of wings, And Time for ever wears 'em. This is Time's holyday; Oh, how he flies, flies away! LOVE'S LIGHT SUMMER-CLOUD. Pain and sorrow shall vanish before us— Youth may wither, but feeling will last; All the shadow that e'er shall fall o'er us Love's light summer-cloud only shall cast. Oh, if to love thee more Each hour I number o'er— If this a passion be Worthy of thee, Then be happy, for thus I adore thee. Charms may wither, but feeling shall last: All the shadow that e'er shall fall o'er thee, Love's light summer-cloud sweetly shall cast. Rest, dear bosom, no sorrows shall pain thee, Sighs of pleasure alone shalt thou steal; Beam, bright eyelid, no weeping shall stain thee, Tears of rapture alone shalt thou feel. Oh, if there be a charm In love, to banish harm— If pleasure's truest spell Be to love well, Then be happy, for thus I adore thee. Charms may wither, but feeling shall last: All the shadow that e'er shall fall o'er thee, Love's light summer-cloud sweetly shall cast. LOVE, WAND'RING THROUGH THE GOLDEN MAZE. Love, wand'ring through the golden maze Of my beloved's hair, Traced every lock with fond delays, And, doting, linger'd there. And soon he found 'twere vain to fly; His heart was close confined, For, every ringlet was a tie— A chain by beauty twined. MERRILY EVERY BOSOM BOUNDETH. THE TYROLESE SONG OF LIBERTY. Merrily every bosom boundeth, Merrily, oh! Where the song of Freedom soundeth, Merrily, oh! There the warrior's arms Shed more splendour; There the maiden's charms Shine more tender; Every joy the land surroundeth, Merrily, oh! merrily, oh! Wearily every bosom pineth, Wearily, oh! Where the bond of slavery twineth Wearily, oh! There the warrior's dart Hath no fleetness; There the maiden's heart Hath no sweetness— Every flower of life declineth, Wearily, oh! wearily, oh! Cheerily then from hill and valley, Cheerily, oh! Like your native fountains sally, Cheerily, oh! If a glorious death, Won by bravery, Sweeter be than breath Sigh'd in slavery, Round the flag of Freedom rally, Cheerily, oh! cheerily, oh! REMEMBER THE TIME. THE CASTILIAN MAID. Remember the time, in La Mancha's shades, When our moments so blissfully flew; When you call'd me the flower of Castilian maids, And I blush'd to be call'd so by you; When I taught you to warble the gay seguadille, And to dance to the light castanet; Oh, never, dear youth, let you roam where you will, The delight of those moments forget. They tell me, you lovers from Erin's green isle, Every hour a new passion can feel; And that soon, in the light of some lovelier smile, You'll forget the poor maid of Castile. But they know not how brave in the battle you are, Or they never could think you would rove; For 'tis always the spirit most gallant in war That is fondest and truest in love. OH, SOON RETURN. Our white sail caught the evening ray, The wave beneath us seem'd to burn, When all the weeping maid could say Was, “Oh, soon return!” Through many a clime our ship was driven, O'er many a billow rudely thrown; Now chill'd beneath a northern heaven, Now sunn'd in summer's zone: And still, where'er we bent our way, When evening bid the west wave burn, I fancied still I heard her say, “Oh, soon return!” If ever yet my bosom found Its thoughts one moment turn'd from thee, 'Twas when the combat raged around, And brave men look'd to me. But though the war-field's wild alarm For gentle Love was all unmeet, He lent to Glory's brow the charm, Which made even danger sweet. And still, when victory's calm came o'er The hearts where rage had ceased to burn, Those parting words I heard once more, “Oh, soon return!—Oh, soon return!” LOVE THEE? Love thee?—so well, so tenderly Thou'rt loved, adored by me, Fame, fortune, wealth, and liberty, Were worthless without thee. Though brimm'd with blessings, pure and rare, Life's cup before me lay, Unless thy love were mingled there, I'd spurn the draught away. Love thee?—so well, so tenderly Thou'rt loved, adored by me, Fame, fortune, wealth, and liberty, Are worthless without thee. Without thy smile, the monarch's lot To me were dark and lone, While, with it, ev'n the humblest cot Were brighter than his throne. Those worlds, for which the conqueror sighs, For me would have no charms; My only world thy gentle eyes— My throne thy circling arms! Oh, yes, so well, so tenderly Thou'rt loved, adored by me, Whole realms of light and liberty Were worthless without thee. ONE DEAR SMILE. Couldst thou look as dear as when First I sigh'd for thee; Couldst thou make me feel again Every wish I breath'd thee then, Oh, how blissful life would be! Hopes, that now beguiling leave me, Joys, that lie in slumber cold— All would wake, couldst thou but give me One dear smile like those of old. No—there's nothing left us now, But to mourn the past; Vain was every ardent vow— Never yet did Heaven allow Love so warm, so wild, to last. Not even hope could now deceive me— Life itself looks dark and cold: Oh, thou never more canst give me One dear smile like those of old. YES, YES, WHEN THE BLOOM. Yes, yes, when the bloom of Love's boyhood is o'er, He'll turn into friendship that feels no decay; And, though Time may take from him the wings he once wore, The charms that remain will be bright as before, And he'll lose but his young trick of flying away. Then let it console thee, if Love should not stay, That Friendship our last happy moments will crown: Like the shadows of morning, Love lessens away, While Friendship, like those at the closing of day, Will linger and lengthen as life's sun goes down. THE DAY OF LOVE. The beam of morning trembling Stole o'er the mountain brook, With timid ray resembling Affection's early look. Thus love begins—sweet morn of love! The noon-tide ray ascended, And o'er the valley's stream Diffused a glow as splendid As passion's riper dream. Thus love expands—warm noon of love! But evening came, o'ershading The glories of the sky, Like faith and fondness fading From passion's alter'd eye. Thus love declines—cold eve of love! LUSITANIAN WAR-SONG. The song of war shall echo through our mountains, Till not one hateful link remains Of slavery's lingering chains; Till not one tyrant tread our plains, Nor traitor lip pollute our fountains. No! never till that glorious day Shall Lusitania's sons be gay, Or hear, oh Peace, thy welcome lay Resounding through her sunny mountains. The song of war shall echo through our mountains, Till Victory's self shall, smiling, say, “Your cloud of foes hath pass'd away, “And Freedom comes, with new-born ray, “To gild your vines and light your fountains.” Oh, never till that glorious day Shall Lusitania's sons be gay, Or hear, sweet Peace, thy welcome lay Resounding through her sunny mountains. THE YOUNG ROSE. The young rose I give thee, so dewy and bright, Was the flow'ret most dear to the sweet bird of night, Who oft, by the moon, o'er her blushes hath hung, And thrill'd every leaf with the wild lay he sung. Oh, take thou this young rose, and let her life be Prolong'd by the breath she will borrow from thee; For, while o'er her bosom thy soft notes shall thrill, She'll think the sweet night-bird is courting her still. WHEN 'MIDST THE GAY I MEET. When 'midst the gay I meet That gentle smile of thine, Though still on me it turns most sweet, I scarce can call it mine: But when to me alone Your secret tears you show, Oh, then I feel those tears my own, And claim them while they flow. Then still with bright looks bless The gay, the cold, the free; Give smiles to those who love you less, But keep your tears for me. The snow on Jura's steep Can smile in many a beam, Yet still in chains of coldness sleep, How bright soe'er it seem. But, when some deep-felt ray, Whose touch is fire, appears, Oh, then the smile is warm'd away, And, melting, turns to tears. Then still with bright looks bless The gay, the cold, the free; Give smiles to those who love you less, But keep your tears for me. WHEN TWILIGHT DEWS. When twilight dews are falling soft Upon the rosy sea, love, I watch the star, whose beam so oft Has lighted me to thee, love. And thou too, on that orb so dear, Dost often gaze at even, And think, though lost for ever here, Thou'lt yet be mine in heaven. There's not a garden walk I tread, There's not a flower I see, love, But brings to mind some hope that's fled, Some joy that's gone with thee, love. And still I wish that hour was near, When, friends and foes forgiven, The pains, the ills we've wept through here, May turn to smiles in heaven. YOUNG JESSICA. Young Jessica sat all the day, With heart o'er idle love-thoughts pining; Her needle bright beside her lay, So active once!—now idly shining. Ah, Jessy, 'tis in idle hearts That love and mischief are most nimble; The safest shield against the darts Of Cupid, is Minerva's thimble. The child, who with a magnet plays, Well knowing all its arts, so wily, The tempter near a needle lays, And laughing says, “We'll steal it slily.” The needle, having nought to do, Is pleased to let the magnet wheedle; Till closer, closer come the two, And—off, at length, elopes the needle. Now, had this needle turn'd its eye To some gay reticule's construction, It ne'er had stray'd from duty's tie, Nor felt the magnet's sly seduction. Thus, girls, would you keep quiet hearts, Your snowy fingers must be nimble; The safest shield against the darts Of Cupid, is Minerva's thimble. HOW HAPPY, ONCE. How happy, once, tho' wing'd with sighs, My moments flew along, While looking on those smiling eyes, And list'ning to thy magic song! But vanish'd now, like summer dreams, Those moments smile no more; For me that eye no longer beams, That song for me is o'er. Mine the cold brow, That speaks thy alter'd vow, While others feel thy sunshine now. Oh, could I change my love like thee, One hope might yet be mine— Some other eyes as bright to see, And hear a voice as sweet as thine: But never, never can this heart Be waked to life again; With thee it lost its vital part, And wither'd then! Cold its pulse lies, And mute are ev'n its sighs, All other grief it now defies. I LOVE BUT THEE. If, after all, you still will doubt and fear me, And think this heart to other loves will stray, If I must swear, then, lovely doubter, hear me; By ev'ry dream I have when thou'rt away, By ev'ry throb I feel when thou art near me, I love but thee—I love but thee! By those dark eyes, where light is ever playing, Where Love, in depth of shadow, holds his throne, And by those lips, which give whate'er thou'rt saying, Or grave or gay, a music of its own, A music far beyond all minstrel's playing, I love but thee—I love but thee! By that fair brow, where Innocence reposes, As pure as moonlight sleeping upon snow, And by that cheek, whose fleeting blush discloses A hue too bright to bless this world below, And only fit to dwell on Eden's roses, I love but thee—I love but thee! LET JOY ALONE BE REMEMBER'D NOW. Let thy joys alone be remember'd now, Let thy sorrows go sleep awhile; Or if thought's dark cloud come o'er thy brow, Let Love light it up with his smile. For thus to meet, and thus to find, That Time, whose touch can chill Each flower of form, each grace of mind, Hath left thee blooming still,— Oh, joy alone should be thought of now, Let our sorrows go sleep awhile; Or, should thought's dark cloud come o'er thy brow, Let Love light it up with his smile. When the flowers of life's sweet garden fade, If but one bright leaf remain, Of the many that once its glory made, It is not for us to complain. But thus to meet and thus to wake In all Love's early bliss; Oh, Time all other gifts may take, So he but leaves us this! Then let joy alone be remember'd now, Let our sorrows go sleep awhile; Or if thought's dark cloud come o'er the brow, Let Love light it up with his smile! LOVE THEE, DEAREST? LOVE THEE? Love thee, dearest? love thee? Yes, by yonder star I swear, Which thro' tears above thee Shines so sadly fair; Though often dim, With tears, like him, Like him my truth will shine, And—love thee, dearest? love thee? Yes, till death I'm thine. Leave thee, dearest? leave thee? No, that star is not more true; When my vows deceive thee, He will wander too. A cloud of night May veil his light, And death shall darken mine— But—leave thee, dearest? leave thee? No, till death I'm thine. MY HEART AND LUTE. I give thee all—I can no more— Tho' poor the off'ring be; My heart and lute are all the store That I can bring to thee. A lute whose gentle song reveals The soul of love full well; And, better far, a heart that feels Much more than lute could tell. Tho' love and song may fail, alas! To keep life's clouds away, At least 'twill make them lighter pass Or gild them if they stay. And ev'n if Care, at moments, flings A discord o'er life's happy strain, Let Love but gently touch the strings, 'Twill all be sweet again! PEACE, PEACE TO HIM THAT'S GONE! When I am dead Then lay my head In some lone, distant dell, Where voices ne'er Shall stir the air, Or break its silent spell. If any sound Be heard around, Let the sweet bird alone, That weeps in song, Sing all night long, “Peace, peace to him that's gone!” Yet, oh, were mine One sigh of thine, One pitying word from thee, Like gleams of heaven, To sinners given, Would be that word to me. Howe'er unblest, My shade would rest While list'ning to that tone;— Enough 'twould be To hear from thee, “Peace, peace, to him that's gone!” ROSE OF THE DESERT. Rose of the Desert! thou, whose blushing ray, Lonely and lovely, fleets unseen away; No hand to cull thee, none to woo thy sigh,— In vestal silence left to live and die,— Rose of the Desert! thus should woman be, Shining uncourted, lone and safe, like thee. Rose of the Garden, how unlike thy doom! Destined for others, not thyself, to bloom: Cull'd e'er thy beauty lives through half its day; A moment cherish'd, and then cast away; Rose of the Garden! such is woman's lot,— Worshipp'd, while blooming—when she fades, forgot. 'TIS ALL FOR THEE. If life for me hath joy or light, 'Tis all from thee, My thoughts by day, my dreams by night, Are but of thee, of only thee. Whate'er of hope or peace I know, My zest in joy, my balm in woe, To those dear eyes of thine I owe, 'Tis all from thee. My heart, ev'n ere I saw those eyes, Seem'd doom'd to thee; Kept pure till then from other ties, 'Twas all for thee, for only thee. Like plants that sleep, till sunny May Calls forth their life, my spirit lay, Till, touch'd by Love's awak'ning ray, It lived for thee, it lived for thee. When Fame would call me to her heights, She speaks by thee; And dim would shine her proudest lights, Unshared by thee, unshared by thee. Whene'er I seek the Muse's shrine, Where Bards have hung their wreaths divine, And wish those wreaths of glory mine, 'Tis all for thee, for only thee. THE SONG OF THE OLDEN TIME. In this song, which is one of the many set to music by myself, the occasional lawlessness of the metre arises, I need hardly say, from the peculiar structure of the air. There's a song of the olden time, Falling sad o'er the ear, Like the dream of some village chime, Which in youth we loved to hear. And ev'n amidst the grand and gay, When Music tries her gentlest art, I never hear so sweet a lay, Or one that hangs so round my heart, As that song of the olden time, Falling sad o'er the ear, Like the dream of some village chime, Which in youth we loved to hear. And when all of this life is gone,— Ev'n the hope, ling'ring now, Like the last of the leaves left on Autumn's sere and faded bough,— 'Twill seem as still those friends were near, Who loved me in youth's early day, If in that parting hour I hear The same sweet notes, and die away,— To that song of the olden time, Breath'd, like Hope's farewell strain, To say, in some brighter clime, Life and youth will shine again! WAKE THEE, MY DEAR. Wake thee, my dear—thy dreaming Till darker hours will keep; While such a moon is beaming, 'Tis wrong tow'rds Heav'n to sleep. Moments there are we number, Moments of pain and care, Which to oblivious slumber Gladly the wretch would spare. But now,—who'd think of dreaming When Love his watch should keep? While such a moon is beaming, 'Tis wrong tow'rds Heaven to sleep. If e'er the fates should sever My life and hopes from thee, love, The sleep that lasts for ever Would then be sweet to me, love; But now,—away with dreaming! Till darker hours 'twill keep; While such a moon is beaming, 'Tis wrong tow'rds Heaven to sleep. THE BOY OF THE ALPS. This and the Songs that follow (as far as page 266.) have been published, with music, by Messrs. Addison and Beale, Regent Street. Lightly, Alpine rover, Tread the mountains over; Rude is the path thou'st yet to go; Snow cliffs hanging o'er thee, Fields of ice before thee, While the hid torrent moans below. Hark, the deep thunder, Through the vales yonder! 'Tis the huge av'lanche downward cast; From rock to rock Rebounds the shock. But courage, boy! the danger's past. Onward, youthful rover, Tread the glacier over, Safe shalt thou reach thy home at last. On, ere light forsake thee, Soon will dusk o'ertake thee: O'er yon ice-bridge lies thy way! Now, for the risk prepare thee; Safe it yet may bear thee, Though 'twill melt in morning's ray. Hark, that dread howling! 'Tis the wolf prowling,— Scent of thy track the foe hath got; And cliff and shore Resound his roar. But courage, boy,—the danger's past! Watching eyes have found thee, Loving arms are round thee, Safe hast thou reach'd thy father's cot. FOR THEE ALONE. For thee alone I brave the boundless deep, Those eyes my light through ev'ry distant sea; My waking thoughts, the dream that gilds my sleep, The noon-tide rev'rie, all are given to thee, To thee alone, to thee alone. Though future scenes present to Fancy's eye Fair forms of light that crowd the distant air, When nearer view'd, the fairy phantoms fly, The crowds dissolve, and thou alone art there, Thou, thou alone. To win thy smile, I speed from shore to shore, While Hope's sweet voice is heard in every blast, Still whisp'ring on, that when some years are o'er, One bright reward shall crown my toil at last, Thy smile alone, thy smile alone. Oh place beside the transport of that hour All earth can boast of fair, of rich, and bright, Wealth's radiant mines, the lofty thrones of power,— Then ask where first thy lover's choice would light? On thee alone, on thee alone. HER LAST WORDS, AT PARTING. Her last words, at parting, how can I forget? Deep treasured through life, in my heart they shall stay; Like music, whose charm in the soul lingers yet, When its sounds from the ear have long melted away. Let Fortune assail me, her threat'nings are vain; Those still-breathing words shall my talisman be,— “Remember, in absence, in sorrow, and pain, “There's one heart, unchanging, that beats but for thee.” From the desert's sweet well tho' the pilgrim must hie, Never more of that fresh-springing fountain to taste, He hath still of its bright drops a treasured supply, Whose sweetness lends life to his lips through the waste. So, dark as my fate is still doom'd to remain, These words shall my well in the wilderness be,— “Remember, in absence, in sorrow, and pain, “There's one heart, unchanging, that beats but for thee.” LET'S TAKE THIS WORLD AS SOME WIDE SCENE. Let's take this world as some wide scene, Through which, in frail, but buoyant boat, With skies now dark and now serene, Together thou and I must float; Beholding oft, on either shore, Bright spots where we should love to stay; But Time plies swift his flying oar, And away we speed, away, away. Should chilling winds and rains come on, We'll raise our awning 'gainst the show'r; Sit closer till the storm is gone, And, smiling, wait a sunnier hour. And if that sunnier hour should shine, We'll know its brightness cannot stay, But happy, while 'tis thine and mine, Complain not when it fades away. So shall we reach at last that Fall Down which life's currents all must go,— The dark, the brilliant, destined all To sink into the void below. Nor ev'n that hour shall want its charms If, side by side, still fond we keep, And calmly, in each other's arms Together link'd, go down the steep. LOVE'S VICTORY. Sing to Love—for, oh, 'twas he Who won the glorious day; Strew the wreaths of victory Along the conqu'ror's way. Yoke the Muses to his car, Let them sing each trophy won; While his mother's joyous star Shall light the triumph on. Hail to Love, to mighty Love, Let spirits sing around; While the hill, the dale, and grove, With “mighty Love” resound; Or, should a sigh of sorrow steal Amid the sounds thus echo'd o'er, Twill but teach the god to feel His victories the more. See his wings, like amethyst Of sunny Ind their hue; Bright as when, by Psyche kist, They trembled through and through. Flowers spring beneath his feet; Angel forms beside him run; While unnumber'd lips repeat “Love's victory is won!” Hail to Love, to mighty Love, &amp;c. SONG OF HERCULES TO HIS DAUGHTER. Founded on the fable reported by Arrian (in Indicis) of Hercules having searched the Indian Ocean, to find the pearl with which he adorned his daughter Pandæa. “I've been, oh, sweet daughter, “To fountain and sea, “To seek in their water “Some bright gem for thee. “Where diamonds were sleeping, “Their sparkle I sought, “Where crystal was weeping, “Its tears I have caught. “The sea-nymph I've courted “In rich coral halls; “With Naiads have sported “By bright waterfalls. “But sportive or tender, “Still sought I around “That gem, with whose splendour “Thou yet shalt be crown'd. “And see, while I'm speaking, “Yon soft light afar;— “The pearl I've been seeking “There floats like a star! “In the deep Indian Ocean “I see the gem shine, “And quick as light's motion “Its wealth shall be thine.” Then eastward, like lightning, The hero-god flew, His sunny looks bright'ning The air he went through. And sweet was the duty, And hallow'd the hour, Which saw thus young Beauty Embellish'd by Power. THE DREAM OF HOME. Who has not felt how sadly sweet The dream of home, the dream of home, Steals o'er the heart, too soon to fleet, When far o'er sea or land we roam? Sunlight more soft may o'er us fall, To greener shores our bark may come; But far more bright, more dear than all, That dream of home, that dream of home. Ask of the sailor youth when far His light bark bounds o'er ocean's foam, What charms him most, when ev'ning's star Smiles o'er the wave? to dream of home. Fond thoughts of absent friends and loves At that sweet hour around him come; His heart's best joy where'er he roves, That dream of home, that dream of home. THEY TELL ME THOU'RT THE FAVOUR'D GUEST. Part of a translation of some Latin verses, supposed to have been addressed by Hippolyta Taurella to her husband, during his absence at the gay court of Leo the Tenth. The verses may be found in the Appendix to Roscoe's Work. They tell me thou'rt the favour'd guest Of every fair and brilliant throng; No wit like thine to wake the jest, No voice like thine to breathe the song; And none could guess, so gay thou art, That thou and I are far apart. Alas! alas! how different flows With thee and me the time away! Not that I wish thee sad—heav'n knows— Still if thou can'st, be light and gay; I only know, that without thee The sun himself is dark to me. Do I thus haste to hall and bower, Among the proud and gay to shine? Or deck my hair with gem and flower, To flatter other eyes than thine? Ah, no, with me love's smiles are past, Thou had'st the first, thou had'st the last. THE YOUNG INDIAN MAID. There came a nymph dancing Gracefully, gracefully, Her eye a light glancing Like the blue sea; And while all this gladness Around her steps hung, Such sweet notes of sadness Her gentle lips sung, That ne'er while I live from my mem'ry shall fade The song, or the look, of that young Indian maid. Her zone of bells ringing Cheerily, cheerily, Chimed to her singing Light echos of glee; But in vain did she borrow Of mirth the gay tone, Her voice spoke of sorrow, And sorrow alone. Nor e'er while I live from my mem'ry shall fade The song, or the look, of that young Indian maid. THE HOMEWARD MARCH. Be still my heart: I hear them come: Those sounds announce my lover near: The march that brings our warriors home Proclaims he'll soon be here. Hark, the distant tread, O'er the mountain's head, While hills and dales repeat the sound; And the forest deer Stand still to hear, As those echoing steps ring round. Be still my heart, I hear them come, Those sounds that speak my soldier near; Those joyous steps seem wing'd for home,— Rest, rest, he'll soon be here. But hark, more faint the footsteps grow, And now they wind to distant glades; Not here their home,—alas, they go To gladden happier maids! Like sounds in a dream, The footsteps seem, As down the hills they die away; And the march, whose song So peal'd along, Now fades like a funeral lay. 'Tis past, 'tis o'er,—hush, heart, thy pain! And though not here, alas, they come, Rejoice for those, to whom that strain Brings sons and lovers home. WAKE UP, SWEET MELODY. Wake up, sweet melody! Now is the hour When young and loving hearts Feel most thy power. One note of music, by moonlight's soft ray— Oh, 'tis worth thousands heard coldly by day. Then wake up, sweet melody! Now is the hour When young and loving hearts Feel most thy power. Ask the fond nightingale, When his sweet flower Loves most to hear his song, In her green bower? Oh, he will tell thee, through summer-nights long, Fondest she lends her whole soul to his song. Then wake up, sweet melody! Now is the hour When young and loving hearts Feel most thy power. CALM BE THY SLEEP. Calm be thy sleep as infants' slumbers! Pure as angel thoughts thy dreams! May every joy this bright world numbers Shed o'er thee their mingled beams! Or if, where Pleasure's wing hath glided, There ever must some pang remain, Still be thy lot with me divided,— Thine all the bliss, and mine the pain! Day and night my thoughts shall hover Round thy steps where'er they stray; As, ev'n when clouds his idol cover, Fondly the Persian tracks its ray. If this be wrong, if Heav'n offended By worship to its creature be, Then let my vows to both be blended, Half breathed to Heav'n and half to thee. THE EXILE. Night waneth fast, the morning star Saddens with light the glimm'ring sea, Whose waves shall soon to realms afar Waft me from hope, from love, and thee. Coldly the beam from yonder sky Looks o'er the waves that onward stray; But colder still the stranger's eye To him whose home is far away. Oh, not at hour so chill and bleak, Let thoughts of me come o'er thy breast; But of the lost one think and speak, When summer suns sink calm to rest. So, as I wander, Fancy's dream Shall bring me o'er the sunset seas, Thy look, in every melting beam, Thy whisper, in each dying breeze. THE FANCY FAIR. Come, maids and youths, for here we sell All wond'rous things of earth and air; Whatever wild romancers tell, Or poets sing, or lovers swear, You'll find at this our Fancy Fair. Here eyes are made like stars to shine, And kept, for years, in such repair, That ev'n when turn'd of thirty-nine, They'll hardly look the worse for wear, If bought at this our Fancy Fair. We've lots of tears for bards to shower, And hearts that such ill usage bear, That, though they're broken ev'ry hour, They'll still in rhyme fresh breaking bear, If purchased at our Fancy Fair. As fashions change in ev'ry thing, We've goods to suit each season's air, Eternal friendships for the spring, And endless loves for summer wear,— All sold at this our Fancy Fair. We've reputations white as snow, That long will last, if used with care, Nay, safe through all life's journey go, If pack'd and mark'd as “brittle ware,”— Just purchased at the Fancy Fair. IF THOU WOULD'ST HAVE ME SING AND PLAY. If thou would'st have me sing and play, As once I play'd and sung, First take this time-worn lute away, And bring one freshly strung. Call back the time when pleasure's sigh First breathed among the strings; And Time himself, in flitting by, Made music with his wings. But how is this? though new the lute, And shining fresh the chords, Beneath this hand they slumber mute, Or speak but dreamy words. In vain I seek the soul that dwelt Within that once sweet shell, Which told so warmly what it felt, And felt what nought could tell. Oh, ask not then for passion's lay, From lyre so coldly strung; With this I ne'er can sing or play, As once I play'd and sung. No, bring that long-loved lute again,— Though chill'd by years it be, If thou wilt call the slumb'ring strain, 'Twill wake again for thee. Tho' time have froz'n the tuneful stream Of thoughts that gush'd along, One look from thee, like summer's beam, Will thaw them into song. Then give, oh give, that wakening ray, And once more blithe and young, Thy bard again will sing and play, As once he play'd and sung. STILL WHEN DAYLIGHT. Still when daylight o'er the wave Bright and soft its farewell gave, I used to hear, while light was falling, O'er the wave a sweet voice calling, Mournfully at distance calling. Ah! once how blest that maid would come, To meet her sea-boy hast'ning home; And through the night those sounds repeating, Hail his bark with joyous greeting, Joyously his light bark greeting. But, one sad night, when winds were high, Nor earth, nor heaven, could hear her cry, She saw his boat come tossing over Midnight's wave,—but not her lover! No, never more her lover. And still that sad dream loth to leave, She comes with wand'ring mind at eve, And oft we hear, when night is falling, Faint her voice through twilight calling, Mournfully at twilight calling. THE SUMMER WEBS. The summer webs that float and shine, The summer dews that fall, Tho' light they be, this heart of mine Is lighter still than all. It tells me every cloud is past Which lately seem'd to lour; That Hope hath wed young Joy at last, And now's their nuptial hour! With light thus round, within, above, With nought to wake one sigh, Except the wish, that all we love Were at this moment nigh,— It seems as if life's brilliant sun Had stopp'd in full career, To make this hour its brightest one, And rest in radiance here. MIND NOT THOUGH DAYLIGHT. Mind not though daylight around us is breaking,— Who'd think now of sleeping when morn's but just waking? Sound the merry viol, and daylight or not, Be all for one hour in the gay dance forgot. See young Aurora, up heav'n's hill advancing, Tho' fresh from her pillow, ev'n she too is dancing: While thus all creation, earth, heaven, and sea, Are dancing around us, oh, why should not we? Who'll say that moments we use thus are wasted? Such sweet drops of time only flow to be tasted; While hearts are high beating, and harps full in tune, The fault is all morning's for coming so soon. THEY MET BUT ONCE. They met but once, in youth's sweet hour, And never since that day Hath absence, time, or grief had pow'r To chase that dream away. They've seen the suns of other skies, On other shores have sought delight; But never more, to bless their eyes, Can come a dream so bright! They met but once,—a day was all Of Love's young hopes they knew; And still their hearts that day recall, As fresh as then it flew. Sweet dream of youth! oh, ne'er again Let either meet the brow They left so smooth and smiling then, Or see what it is now. For, Youth, the spell was only thine; From thee alone th' enchantment flows, That makes the world around thee shine With light thyself bestows. They met but once,—oh, ne'er again Let either meet the brow They left so smooth and smiling then, Or see what it is now. WITH MOONLIGHT BEAMING. With moonlight beaming Thus o'er the deep, Who'd linger dreaming In idle sleep? Leave joyless souls to live by day,— Our life begins with yonder ray; And while thus brightly The moments flee, Our barks skim lightly The shining sea. To halls of splendour Let great ones hie; Through light more tender Our pathways lie. While round, from banks of brook or lake, Our company blithe echoes make; And, as we lend 'em Sweet word or strain, Still back they send 'em, More sweet, again. CHILD'S SONG. FROM A MASQUE. I have a garden of my own, Shining with flowers of every hue; I loved it dearly while alone, But I shall love it more with you: And there the golden bees shall come, In summer-time at break of morn, And wake us with their busy hum Around the Siha's fragrant thorn. I have a fawn from Aden's land, On leafy buds and berries nurst; And you shall feed him from your hand, Though he may start with fear at first. And I will lead you where he lies For shelter in the noon-tide heat; And you may touch his sleeping eyes, And feel his little silv'ry feet. THE HALCYON HANGS O'ER OCEAN. The halcyon hangs o'er ocean, The sea-lark skims the brine; This bright world's all in motion, No heart seems sad but mine. To walk through sun-bright places, With heart all cold the while; To look in smiling faces, When we no more can smile; To feel, while earth and heaven Around thee shine with bliss, To thee no light is given,— Oh, what a doom is this! THE WORLD WAS HUSH'D. The world was hush'd, the moon above Sail'd through ether slowly, When, near the casement of my love, Thus I whisper'd lowly,— “Awake, awake, how canst thou sleep? “The field I seek to-morrow “Is one where man hath fame to reap, “And woman gleans but sorrow.” “Let battle's field be what it may,” Thus spoke a voice replying, “Think not thy love, while thou'rt away, “Will here sit idly sighing. “No—woman's soul, if not for fame, “For love can brave all danger!” Then forth from out the casement came A plumed and armed stranger. A stranger? No; 'twas she, the maid, Herself before me beaming, With casque array'd, and falchion blade Beneath her girdle gleaming! Close side by side, in freedom's fight, That blessed morning found us; In Vict'ry's light we stood ere night, And Love, the morrow, crown'd us! THE TWO LOVES. There are two Loves, the poet sings, Both born of Beauty at a birth: The one, akin to heaven, hath wings, The other, earthly, walks on earth. With this through bowers below we play, With that through clouds above we soar; With both, perchance, may lose our way:— Then, tell me which, Tell me which shall we adore? The one, when tempted down from air, At Pleasure's fount to lave his lip, Nor lingers long, nor oft will dare His wing within the wave to dip. While, plunging deep and long beneath, The other bathes him o'er and o'er In that sweet current, ev'n to death:— Then, tell me which, Tell me which shall we adore? The boy of heav'n, even while he lies In Beauty's lap, recalls his home; And when most happy, inly sighs For something happier still to come. While he of earth, too fully blest With this bright world to dream of more, Sees all his heav'n on Beauty's breast:— Then, tell me which, Tell me which shall we adore? The maid who heard the poet sing These twin-desires of earth and sky, And saw, while one inspired his string, The other glisten'd in his eye,— To name the earthlier boy ashamed, To choose the other fondly loath, At length, all blushing, she exclaim'd,— “Ask not which, “Oh, ask not which—we'll worship both. “Th' extremes of each thus taught to shun, “With hearts and souls between them given, “When weary of this earth with one, “We'll with the other wing to heaven.” Thus pledged the maid her vow of bliss; And while one Love wrote down the oath, The other seal'd it with a kiss; And Heav'n look'd on, Heav'n look'd on, and hallow'd both. THE LEGEND OF PUCK THE FAIRY. Would'st know what tricks, by the pale moonlight, Are play'd by me, the merry little Sprite, Who wing through air from the camp to the court, From king to clown, and of all make sport; Singing, I am the Sprite Of the merry midnight, Who laugh at weak mortals, and love the moonlight. To a miser's bed, where he snoring slept And dreamt of his cash, I slily crept; Chink, chink o'er his pillow like money I rang, And he waked to catch—but away I sprang, Singing, I am the Sprite, &amp;c. I saw through the leaves, in a damsel's bower, She was waiting her love at that starlight hour: “Hist—hist!” quoth I, with an amorous sigh, And she flew to the door, but away flew I, Singing, I am the Sprite, &amp;c. While a bard sat inditing an ode to his love, Like a pair of blue meteors I stared from above, And he swoon'd—for he thought 'twas the ghost, poor man! Of his lady's eyes, while away I ran, Singing, I am the Sprite, &amp;c. BEAUTY AND SONG. Down in yon summer vale, Where the rill flows, Thus said a Nightingale To his loved Rose:— “Though rich the pleasures “Of song's sweet measures, “Vain were its melody, “Rose, without thee.” Then from the green recess Of her night-bow'r, Beaming with bashfulness, Spoke the bright flow'r:— “Though morn should lend her “Its sunniest splendour, “What would the Rose be, “Unsung by thee?” Thus still let Song attend Woman's bright way; Thus still let woman lend Light to the lay. Like stars, through heaven's sea, Floating in harmony, Beauty should glide along, Circled by Song. WHEN THOU ART NIGH. When thou art nigh, it seems A new creation round; The sun hath fairer beams, The lute a softer sound. Though thee alone I see, And hear alone thy sigh, 'Tis light, 'tis song to me, 'Tis all—when thou art nigh. When thou art nigh, no thought Of grief comes o'er my heart; I only think—could aught But joy be where thou art? Life seems a waste of breath, When far from thee I sigh; And death—ay, even death Were sweet, if thou wert nigh. SONG OF A HYPERBOREAN. I come from a land in the sun-bright deep, Where golden gardens grow; Where the winds of the north, becalm'd in sleep, Their conch-shells never blow. On the Tower of the Winds, at Athens, there is a conch-shell placed in the hands of Boreas.—See Stuart's Antiquities. “The north wind,” says Herodotus, in speaking of the Hyperboreans, “never blows with them.” Haste to that holy Isle with me, Haste—haste! So near the track of the stars are we “Sub ipso siderum cardine jacent.” —Pompon. Mela., That oft, on night's pale beams, The distant sounds of their harmony Come to our ear, like dreams. Then, haste to that holy Isle with me, &amp;c. &amp;c. The Moon, too, brings her world so nigh “They can shew the moon very near.”—Diodor. Sicul., That when the night-seer looks To that shadowless orb, in a vernal sky, He can number its hills and brooks. Then, haste, &amp;c. &amp;c. To the Sun-god all our hearts and lyres Hecatæus tells us, that this Hyperborean island was dedicated to Apollo; and most of the inhabitants were either priests or songsters. By day, by night, belong; And the breath we draw from his living fires, We give him back in song. Then, haste, &amp;c. &amp;c. From us descends the maid who brings To Delos gifts divine; And our wild bees lend their rainbow wings To glitter on Delphi's shrine. Pausan. Then, haste to that holy Isle with me, Haste—haste! THOU BIDST ME SING. Thou bidst me sing the lay I sung to thee In other days, ere joy had left this brow; But think, though still unchanged the notes may be, How diff'rent feels the heart that breathes them now! The rose thou wear'st to-night is still the same We saw this morning on its stem so gay; But, ah! that dew of dawn, that breath which came Like life o'er all its leaves, hath pass'd away. Since first that music touch'd thy heart and mine, How many a joy and pain o'er both have past,— The joy, a light too precious long to shine, The pain, a cloud whose shadows always last. And though that lay would like the voice of home Breathe o'er our ear, 'twould waken now a sigh— Ah! not, as then, for fancied woes to come, But, sadder far, for real bliss gone by. CUPID ARMED. Place the helm on thy brow, In thy hand take the spear;— Thou art arm'd, Cupid, now, And thy battle-hour is near. March on! march on! thy shaft and bow Were weak against such charms; March on! march on! so proud a foe Scorns all but martial arms. See the darts in her eyes, Tipt with scorn, how they shine! Ev'ry shaft, as it flies, Mocking proudly at thine. March on! march on! thy feather'd darts Soft bosoms soon might move; But ruder arms to ruder hearts Must teach what 'tis to love. Place the helm on thy brow; In thy hand take the spear,— Thou art arm'd, Cupid, now, And thy battle-hour is near. ROUND THE WORLD GOES. Round the world goes, by day and night, While with it also round go we; And in the flight of one day's light An image of all life's course we see. Round, round, while thus we go round, The best thing a man can do, Is to make it, at least, a merry-go-round, By—sending the wine round too. Our first gay stage of life is when Youth, in its dawn, salutes the eye— Season of bliss! Oh, who wouldn't then Wish to cry, “Stop!” to earth and sky? But, round, round, both boy and girl Are whisk'd through that sky of blue; And much would their hearts enjoy the whirl, If—their heads didn't whirl round too. Next, we enjoy our glorious noon, Thinking all life a life of light; But shadows come on, 'tis evening soon, And, ere we can say, “How short!”—'tis night. Round, round, still all goes round, Ev'n while I'm thus singing to you; And the best way to make it a merry-go-round, Is to—chorus my song round too. OH, DO NOT LOOK SO BRIGHT AND BLEST. Oh, do not look so bright and blest, For still there comes a fear, When brow like thine looks happiest, That grief is then most near. There lurks a dread in all delight, A shadow near each ray, That warns us then to fear their flight, When most we wish their stay. Then look not thou so bright and blest, For ah! there comes a fear, When brow like thine looks happiest, That grief is then most near. Why is it thus that fairest things The soonest fleet and die?— That when most light is on their wings, They're then but spread to fly! And, sadder still, the pain will stay— The bliss no more appears; As rainbows take their light away, And leave us but the tears! Then look not thou so bright and blest, For ah! there comes a fear, When brow like thine looks happiest, That grief is then most near. THE MUSICAL BOX. “Look here,” said Rose, with laughing eyes, “Within this box, by magic hid, “A tuneful Sprite imprison'd lies, “Who sings to me whene'er he's bid. “Though roving once his voice and wing, “He'll now lie still the whole day long; “Till thus I touch the magic spring— “Then hark, how sweet and blithe his song!” (A symphony.) “Ah, Rose,” I cried, “the poet's lay “Must ne'er ev'n Beauty's slave become; “Through earth and air his song may stray, “If all the while his heart's at home. “And though in freedom's air he dwell, “Nor bond nor chain his spirit knows, “Touch but the spring thou know'st so well, “And—hark, how sweet the love-song flows!” (A symphony.) Thus pleaded I for freedom's right; But when young Beauty takes the field, And wise men seek defence in flight, The doom of poets is to yield. No more my heart th' enchantress braves, I'm now in Beauty's prison hid; The Sprite and I are fellow-slaves, And I, too, sing whene'er I'm bid. WHEN TO SAD MUSIC SILENT YOU LISTEN. When to sad Music silent you listen, And tears on those eyelids tremble like dew, Oh, then there dwells in those eyes as they glisten A sweet holy charm that mirth never knew. But when some lively strain resounding Lights up the sunshine of joy on that brow, Then the young rein-deer o'er the hills bounding Was ne'er in its mirth so graceful as thou. When on the skies at midnight thou gazest, A lustre so pure thy features then wear, That, when to some star that bright eye thou raisest, We feel 'tis thy home thou'rt looking for there. But, when the word for the gay dance is given, So buoyant thy spirit, so heartfelt thy mirth, Oh then we exclaim, “Ne'er leave earth for heaven, “But linger still here, to make heaven of earth.” THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS. Fly swift, my light gazelle, To her who now lies waking, To hear thy silver bell The midnight silence breaking. And, when thou com'st, with gladsome feet, Beneath her lattice springing, Ah, well she'll know how sweet The words of love thou'rt bringing. Yet, no—not words, for they But half can tell love's feeling; Sweet flowers alone can say What passion fears revealing. A once bright rose's wither'd leaf, A tow'ring lily broken,— Oh these may paint a grief No words could e'er have spoken. Not such, my gay gazelle, The wreath thou speedest over Yon moonlight dale, to tell My lady how I love her. And, what to her will sweeter be Than gems the richest, rarest,— From Truth's immortal tree The tree called in the East Amrita, or the Immortal. One fadeless leaf thou bearest. THE DAWN IS BREAKING O'ER US. The dawn is breaking o'er us, See, heaven hath caught its hue! We've day's long light before us, What sport shall we pursue? The hunt o'er hill and lea? The sail o'er summer sea? Oh let not hour so sweet Unwing'd by pleasure fleet. The dawn is breaking o'er us, See, heaven hath caught its hue! We've day's long light before us, What sport shall we pursue? But see, while we're deciding, What morning sport to play, The dial's hand is gliding, And morn hath pass'd away! Ah, who'd have thought that noon Would o'er us steal so soon,— That morn's sweet hour of prime Would last so short a time? But come, we've day before us, Still heaven looks bright and blue; Quick, quick, ere eve comes o'er us, What sport shall we pursue? Alas! why thus delaying? We're now at evening's hour; Its farewell beam is playing O'er hill and wave and bower. That light we thought would last, Behold, ev'n now, 'tis past; And all our morning dreams Have vanish'd with its beams! But come! 'twere vain to borrow Sad lessons from this lay, For man will be to-morrow— Just what he's been to-day. UNPUBLISHED SONGS, ETC. ASK NOT IF STILL I LOVE. Ask not if still I love, Too plain these eyes have told thee; Too well their tears must prove How near and dear I hold thee. If, where the brightest shine, To see no form but thine, To feel that earth can show No bliss above thee,— If this be love, then know That thus, that thus, I love thee. 'Tis not in pleasure's idle hour That thou can'st know affection's pow'r. No, try its strength in grief or pain; Attempt, as now, its bonds to sever, Thou'lt find true love's a chain That binds for ever! DEAR? YES Dear? yes, tho' mine no more, Ev'n this but makes thee dearer; And love, since hope is o'er, But draws thee nearer. Change as thou wilt to me, The same thy charm must be; New loves may come to weave Their witchery o'er thee, Yet still, though false, believe That I adore thee, yes, still adore thee. Think'st thou that aught but death could end A tie not falsehood's self can rend? No, when alone, far off I die, No more to see, no more caress thee, Ev'n then, my life's last sigh Shall be to bless thee, yes, still to bless thee. UNBIND THEE, LOVE. Unbind thee, love, unbind thee, love, From those dark ties unbind thee; Though fairest hand the chain hath wove, Too long its links have twined thee. Away from earth!—thy wings were made In yon mid-sky to hover, With earth beneath their dove-like shade, And heav'n all radiant over. Awake thee, boy, awake thee, boy, Too long thy soul is sleeping; And thou may'st from this minute's joy Wake to eternal weeping. Oh, think, this world is not for thee; Though hard its links to sever; Though sweet and bright and dear they be, Break, or thou'rt lost for ever. THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE. (A Buffo Song.) There's something strange, I know not what, Come o'er me, Some phantom I've for ever got Before me. I look on high, and in the sky 'Tis shining; On earth, its light with all things bright Seems twining. In vain I try this goblin's spells To sever; Go where I will, it round me dwells For ever. And then what tricks by day and night It plays me In ev'ry shape the wicked sprite Waylays me. Sometimes like two bright eyes of blue 'Tis glancing; Sometimes like feet, in slippers neat, Comes dancing. By whispers round of every sort I'm taunted. Never was mortal man, in short, So haunted. NOT FROM THEE. Not from thee the wound should come, No, not from thee. I care not what or whence my doom, So not from thee! Cold triumph! first to make This heart thy own; And then the mirror break Where fix'd thou shin'st alone. Nor from thee the wound should come, Oh, not from thee. I care not what, or whence, my doom, So not from thee. Yet no—my lips that wish recall; From thee, from thee— If ruin o'er this head must fall, 'Twill welcome be. Here to the blade I bare This faithful heart; Wound deep—thou'lt find that there, In every pulse thou art. Yes from thee I'll bear it all: If ruin be The doom that o'er this heart must fall, 'Twere sweet from thee. GUESS, GUESS. I love a maid, a mystic maid, Whose form no eyes but mine can see; She comes in light, she comes in shade, And beautiful in both is she, Her shape in dreams I oft behold, And oft she whispers in my ear Such words as when to others told, Awake the sigh, or wring the tear;— Then guess, guess, who she, The lady of my love, may be. I find the lustre of her brow, Come o'er me in my darkest ways; And feel as if her voice, ev'n now, Were echoing far off my lays. There is no scene of joy or woe But she doth gild with influence bright; And shed o'er all so rich a glow As makes ev'n tears seem full of light: Then guess, guess, who she, The lady of my love, may be. WHEN LOVE, WHO RULED. When Love, who ruled as Admiral o'er His rosy mother's isles of light, Was cruising off the Paphian shore, A sail at sunset hove in sight. “A chase, a chase! my Cupids all,” Said Love, the little Admiral. Aloft the winged sailors sprung, And, swarming up the mast like bees, The snow-white sails expanding flung, Like broad magnolias to the breeze. “Yo ho, yo ho, my Cupids all!” Said Love, the little Admiral. The chase was o'er—the bark was caught, The winged crew her freight explored; And found 'twas just as Love had thought, For all was contraband aboard. “A prize, a prize, my Cupids all!” Said Love, the little Admiral. Safe stow'd in many a package there, And labell'd slyly o'er, as “Glass,” Were lots of all th' illegal ware, Love's Custom-House forbids to pass. “O'erhaul, o'erhaul, my Cupids all,” Said Love, the little Admiral. False curls they found, of every hue, With rosy blushes ready made; And teeth of ivory, good as new, For veterans in the smiling trade. “Ho ho, ho ho, my Cupids all,” Said Love, the little Admiral. Mock sighs, too,—kept in bags for use, Like breezes bought of Lapland seers,— Lay ready here to be let loose, When wanted, in young spinsters' ears. “Ha ha, ha ha, my Cupids all,” Said Love, the little Admiral. False papers next on board were found, Sham invoices of flames and darts, Professedly for Paphos bound, But meant for Hymen's golden marts. “For shame, for shame, my Cupids all!” Said Love, the little Admiral. Nay, still to every fraud awake, Those pirates all Love's signals knew, And hoisted oft his flag, to make Rich wards and heiresses bring-to. “To Bring-to, to check the course of a ship.” —Falconer. “A foe, a foe, my Cupids all!” Said Love, the little Admiral. “This must not be,” the boy exclaims, “In vain I rule the Paphian seas, “If Love's and Beauty's sovereign names “Are lent to cover frauds like these. “Prepare, prepare, my Cupids all!” Said Love, the little Admiral. Each Cupid stood with lighted match— A broadside struck the smuggling foe, And swept the whole unhallow'd batch Of Falsehood to the depths below. “Huzza, huzza! my Cupids all!” Said Love, the little Admiral. STILL THOU FLIEST. Still thou fliest, and still I woo thee, Lovely phantom,—all in vain; Restless ever, my thoughts pursue thee, Fleeting ever, thou mock'st their pain. Such doom, of old, that youth betided, Who wooed, he thought, some angel's charms, But found a cloud that from him glided,— As thou dost from these out-stretched arms. Scarce I've said, “How fair thou shinest,” Ere thy light hath vanish'd by; And 'tis when thou look'st divinest Thou art still most sure to fly. Ev'n as the lightning, that, dividing The clouds of night, saith, “Look on me,” Then flits again, its splendour hiding,— Ev'n such the glimpse I catch of thee. THEN FIRST FROM LOVE. Then first from Love, in Nature's bow'rs, Did Painting learn her fairy skill, And cull the hues of loveliest flow'rs, To picture woman lovelier still. For vain was ev'ry radiant hue, Till Passion lent a soul to art, And taught the painter, ere he drew, To fix the model in his heart. Thus smooth his toil awhile went on, Till, lo, one touch his art defies; The brow, the lip, the blushes shone, But who could dare to paint those eyes? 'Twas all in vain the painter strove; So turning to that boy divine, “Here take,” he said, “the pencil, Love, “No hand should paint such eyes, but thine.” HUSH, SWEET LUTE. Hush, sweet Lute, thy songs remind me Of past joys, now turn'd to pain; Of ties that long have ceased to bind me, But whose burning marks remain. In each tone, some echo falleth On my ear of joys gone by; Ev'ry note some dream recalleth Of bright hopes but born to die. Yet, sweet Lute, though pain it bring me, Once more let thy numbers thrill; Though death were in the strain they sing me, I must woo its anguish still. Since no time can e'er recover Love's sweet light when once 'tis set,— Better to weep such pleasures over, Than smile o'er any left us yet. BRIGHT MOON. Bright moon, that high in heav'n art shining, All smiles, as if within thy bower to-night Thy own Endymion lay reclining, And thou would'st wake him with a kiss of light!— By all the bliss thy beam discovers, By all those visions far too bright for day, Which dreaming bards and waking lovers Behold, this night, beneath thy ling'ring ray,— I pray thee, queen of that bright heaven, Quench not to-night thy love-lamp in the sea, Till Anthe, in this bower, hath given Beneath thy beam, her long-vow'd kiss to me. Guide hither, guide her steps benighted, Ere thou, sweet moon, thy bashful crescent hide; Let Love but in this bow'r be lighted, Then shroud in darkness all the world beside. LONG YEARS HAVE PASS'D. Long years have pass'd, old friend, since we First met in life's young day; And friends long loved by thee and me, Since then have dropp'd away;— But enough remain to cheer us on, And sweeten, when thus we're met, The glass we fill to the many gone, And the few who're left us yet. Our locks, old friend, now thinly grow, And some hang white and chill; While some, like flow'rs 'mid Autumn's snow, Retain youth's colour still. And so, in our hearts, though one by one, Youth's sunny hopes have set, Thank heav'n, not all their light is gone,— We've some to cheer us yet. Then here's to thee, old friend, and long May thou and I thus meet, To brighten still with wine and song This short life, ere it fleet. And still as death comes stealing on, Let's never, old friend, forget, Ev'n while we sigh o'er blessings gone, How many are left us yet. DREAMING FOR EVER. Dreaming for ever, vainly dreaming, Life to the last pursues its flight; Day hath its visions fairly beaming, But false as those of night. The one illusion, the other real, But both the same brief dreams at last; And when we grasp the bliss ideal, Soon as it shines, 'tis past. Here, then, by this dim lake reposing, Calmly I'll watch, while light and gloom Flit o'er its face till night is closing— Emblem of life's short doom! But though, by turns, thus dark and shining, 'Tis still unlike man's changeful day, Whose light returns not, once declining, Whose cloud, once come, will stay. THOUGH LIGHTLY SOUNDS THE SONG I SING. A Song of the Alps. Though lightly sounds the song I sing to thee, Though like the lark's its soaring music be, Thou'lt find ev'n here some mournful note that tells How near such April joy to weeping dwells. 'Tis 'mong the gayest scenes that oft'nest steal Those saddening thoughts we fear, yet love to feel; And music never half so sweet appears, As when her mirth forgets itself in tears. Then say not thou this Alpine song is gay— It comes from hearts that, like their mountain-lay, Mix joy with pain, and oft when pleasure's breath Most warms the surface, feel most sad beneath. The very beam in which the snow-wreath wears Its gayest smile is that which wins its tears,— And passion's pow'r can never lend the glow Which wakens bliss, without some touch of woe. THE RUSSIAN LOVER. Fleetly o'er the moonlight snows Speed we to my lady's bow'r; Swift our sledge as lightning goes, Nor shall stop till morning's hour. Bright, my steed, the northern star Lights us from yon jewell'd skies; But, to greet us, brighter far, Morn shall bring my lady's eyes. Lovers, lull'd in sunny bow'rs, Sleeping out their dream of time, Know not half the bliss that's ours, In this snowy, icy clime. Like yon star that livelier gleams From the frosty heavens around, Love himself the keener beams When with snows of coyness crown'd. Fleet then on, my merry steed, Bound, my sledge, o'er hill and dale;— What can match a lover's speed? See, 'tis daylight, breaking pale! Brightly hath the northern star Lit us from yon radiant skies; But, behold, how brighter far Yonder shine my lady's eyes! END OF THE FIFTH VOLUME.</field>

TO SAMUEL ROGERS, ESQ. THIS EASTERN ROMANCE IS INSCRIBED, BY HIS VERY GRATEFUL AND AFFECTIONATE FRIEND, THOMAS MOORE.May 19. 1817. LALLA ROOKH. THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN. Khorassan signifies, in the old Persian language, Province or Region of the Sun. —Sir W. Jones. In that delightful Province of the Sun, The first of Persian lands he shines upon, Where all the loveliest children of his beam, Flow'rets and fruits, blush over every stream “The fruits of Meru are finer than those of any other place; and one cannot see in any other city such palaces with groves, and streams, and gardens.” —Ebn Haukal's Geography., And, fairest of all streams, the Murga roves Among Merou's One of the royal cities of Khorassan. bright palaces and groves;— There on that throne, to which the blind belief Of millions rais'd him, sat the Prophet-Chief, The Great Mokanna. O'er his features hung The Veil, the Silver Veil, which he had flung In mercy there, to hide from mortal sight His dazzling brow, till man could bear its light. For, far less luminous, his votaries said, Were ev'n the gleams, miraculously shed O'er Moussa's Moses. cheek “Ses disciples assuroient qu'il se couvroit le visage, pour ne pas éblouir ceux qui l'approchoient par l'éclat de son visage comme Moyse.” —D'Herbelot., when down the Mount he trod, All glowing from the presence of his God! On either side, with ready hearts and hands, His chosen guard of bold Believers stands; Young fire-eyed disputants, who deem their swords, On points of faith, more eloquent than words; And such their zeal, there's not a youth with brand Uplifted there, but, at the Chief's command, Would make his own devoted heart its sheath, And bless the lips that doom'd so dear a death! In hatred to the Caliph's hue of night Black was the colour adopted by the Caliphs of the House of Abbas, in their garments, turbans, and standards.—“Il faut remarquer ici touchant les habits blancs des disciples de Hakem, que la couleur des habits, des cöeffures et des étendarts des Khalifes Abassides ètant la noire, ce chef de Rebelles ne pouvoit pas choisir une qui lui fût plus opposèe.” —D' Herbelot., Their vesture, helms and all, is snowy white; Their weapons various—some equipp'd, for speed, With javelins of the light Kathaian reed “Our dark javelins, exquisitely wrought of Khathaian reeds, slender and delicate.” —Poem of Amru.; Or bows of buffalo horn and shining quivers Fill'd with the stems Pichula, used anciently for arrows by the Persians. that bloom on Iran's rivers The Persians call this plant Gaz. The celebrated shaft of Isfendiar, one of their ancient heroes, was made of it.— “Nothing can be more beautiful than the appearance of this plant in flower during the rains on the banks of rivers, where it is usually interwoven with a lovely twining asclepias.” —Sir W. Jones, Botanical Observations on Select Indian Plants.; While some, for war's more terrible attacks, Wield the huge mace and ponderous battle-axe; And as they wave aloft in morning's beam The milk-white plumage of their helms, they seem Like a chenar-tree grove The oriental plane. “The chenar is a delightful tree; its bole is of a fine white and smooth bark; and its foliage, which grows in a tuft at the summit, is of a bright green.” —Morier's Travels. when winter throws O'er all its tufted heads his feathering snows. Between the porphyry pillars, that uphold The rich moresque-work of the roof of gold, Aloft the Haram's curtain'd galleries rise, Where through the silken net-work, glancing eyes, From time to time, like sudden gleams that glow Through autumn clouds, shine o'er the pomp below.— What impious tongue, ye blushing saints, would dare To hint that aught but Heav'n hath plac'd you there? Or that the loves of this light world could bind, In their gross chain, your Prophet's soaring mind? No—wrongful thought!—commission'd from above To people Eden's bowers with shapes of love, (Creatures so bright, that the same lips and eyes They wear on earth will serve in Paradise,) There to recline among Heav'n's native maids, And crown the' Elect with bliss that never fades— Well hath the Prophet-Chief his bidding done; And every beauteous race beneath the sun, From those who kneel at Brahma's burning fount The burning fountains of Brahma near Chittogong, esteemed as holy. —Turner., To the fresh nymphs bounding o'er Yemen's mounts; From Persia's eyes of full and fawn-like ray, To the small, half-shut glances of Kathay China.; And Georgia's bloom, and Azab's darker smiles, And the gold ringlets of the Western Isles; All, all are there;—each Land its flower hath given, To form that fair young Nursery for Heaven! But why this pageant now? this arm'd array? What triumph crowds the rich Divan to-day With turban'd heads, of every hue and race, Bowing before that veil'd and awful face, Like tulip-beds “The name of tulip is said to be of Turkish extraction, and given to the flower on account of its resembling a turban.” —Beckmann's History of Inventions., of different shape and dyes, Bending beneath the' invisible West-wind's sighs! What new-made mystery now, for Faith to sign, And blood to seal, as genuine and divine, What dazzling mimickry of God's own power Hath the bold Prophet plann'd to grace this hour? Not such the pageant now, though not less proud; Yon warrior youth, advancing from the crowd, With silver bow, with belt of broider'd crape, And fur-bound bonnet of Bucharian shape “The inhabitants of Bucharia wear a round cloth bonnet, shaped much after the Polish fashion, having a large fur border. They tie their kaftans about the middle with a girdle of a kind of silk crape, several times round the body.” —Account of Independent Tartary, in Pinkerton's Collection., So fiercely beautiful in form and eye, Like war's wild planet in a summer sky; That youth to-day,—a proselyte, worth hordes Of cooler spirits and less practis'd swords,— Is come to join, all bravery and belief, The creed and standard of the heav'n-sent Chief. Though few his years, the West already knows Young Azim's fame;—beyond the' Olympian snows Ere manhood darken'd o'er his downy cheek, O'erwhelm'd in fight and captive to the Greek In the war of the Caliph Mahadi against the Empress Irene, for an account of which vide Gibbon, vol. x., He linger'd there, till peace dissolved his chains;— Oh, who could, ev'n in bondage, tread the plains Of glorious Greece, nor feel his spirit rise Kindling within him? who, with heart and eyes, Could walk where Liberty had been, nor see The shining foot-prints of her Deity, Nor feel those god-like breathings in the air, Which mutely told her spirit had been there? Not he, that youthful warrior,—no, too well For his soul's quiet work'd the' awakening spell; And now, returning to his own dear land, Full of those dreams of good that, vainly grand, Haunt the young heart,—proud views of human-kind, Of men to Gods exalted and refin'd,— False views, like that horizon's fair deceit, Where earth and heav'n but seem, alas, to meet!— Soon as he heard an Arm Divine was rais'd To right the nations, and beheld, emblaz'd On the white flag Mokanna's host unfurl'd, Those words of sunshine, “Freedom to the World,” At once his faith, his sword, his soul obey'd The' inspiring summons; every chosen blade That fought beneath that banner's sacred text Seem'd doubly edg'd, for this world and the next; And ne'er did Faith with her smooth bandage bind Eyes more devoutly willing to be blind, In virtue's cause;—never was soul inspir'd With livelier trust in what it most desir'd, Than his, the' enthusiast there, who kneeling, pale With pious awe, before that Silver Veil, Believes the form, to which he bends his knee, Some pure, redeeming angel, sent to free This fetter'd world from every bond and stain, And bring its primal glories back again! Low as young Azim knelt, that motley crowd Of all earth's nations sunk the knee and bow'd, With shouts of “Alla!” echoing long and loud; While high in air, above the Prophet's head, Hundreds of banners, to the sunbeam spread, Wav'd, like the wings of the white birds that fan The flying throne of star-taught Soliman. This wonderful Throne was called The Star of the Genii. For a full description of it, see the Fragment, translated by Captain Franklin, from a Persian MS. entitled “The History of Jerusalem,” Oriental Collections, vol. i. p. 235.—When Soliman travelled, the eastern writers say, “He had a carpet of green silk on which his throne was placed, being of a prodigious length and breadth, and sufficient for all his forces to stand upon, the men placing themselves on his right hand, and the spirits on his left; and that when all were in order, the wind, at his command, took up the carpet, and transported it, with all that were upon it, wherever he pleased; the army of birds at the same time flying over their heads, and forming a kind of canopy to shade them from the sun.” —Sale's Koran, vol. ii. p. 214. note. Then thus he spoke:—“Stranger, though new the frame “Thy soul inhabits now, I've track'd its flame “For many an age The transmigration of souls was one of his doctrines. —Vide D'Herbelot., in every chance and change “Of that existence, through whose varied range,— “As through a torch-race, where, from hand to hand “The flying youths transmit their shining brand, “From frame to frame the unextinguish'd soul “Rapidly passes, till it reach the goal! “Nor think 'tis only the gross Spirits, warm'd “With duskier fire and for earth's medium form'd, “That run this course;—Beings, the most divine, “Thus deign through dark mortality to shine. “Such was the Essence that in Adam dwelt, “To which all Heav'n, except the Proud One, knelt: “And when we said unto the angels, Worship Adam, they all worshipped him except Eblis (Lucifer), who refused.” —The Koran, chap. ii. “Such the refin'd Intelligence that glow'd “In Moussa's Moses. frame,—and, thence descending, flow'd “Through many a Prophet's breast This is according to D'Herbelot's account of the doctrines of Mokanna:—“Sa doctrine étoit, que Dieu avoit pris une forme et figure humaine, depuis qu'il eut commandé aux Anges d'adorer Adam, le premier des hommes. Qu'après la mort d'Adam, Dieu étoit apparu sous la figure de plusieurs Prophétes, et autres grands hommes qu'il avoit choisis, jusqu'à ce qu'il prit celle d'Abu Moslem, Prince de Khorassan, lequel professoit l'erreur de la Tenassukhiah ou Metempschychose; et qu'aprés la mort de ce Prince, la Divinité étoit passée, et descendue en sa personne.”;—in Issa Jesus. shone, “And in Mohammed burn'd; till, hastening on, “(As a bright river that, from fall to fall “In many a maze descending, bright through all, “Finds some fair region where, each labyrinth past, “In one full lake of light it rests at last) “That Holy Spirit, settling calm and free “From lapse or shadow, centers all in me!” Again, throughout the' assembly at these words, Thousands of voices rung: the warriors' swords Were pointed up to heaven; a sudden wind In the' open banners play'd, and from behind Those Persian hangings, that but ill could screen The Haram's loveliness, white hands were seen Waving embroider'd scarves, whose motion gave A perfume forth—like those the Houris wave When beck'ning to their bowers the' immortal Brave. “But these,” pursued the Chief, “are truths sublime, “That claim a holier mood and calmer time “Than earth allows us now;—this sword must first “The darkling prison-house of Mankind burst, “Ere Peace can visit them, or Truth let in “Her wakening daylight on a world of sin. “But then,—celestial warriors, then, when all “Earth's shrines and thrones before our banner fall; “When the glad Slave shall at these feet lay down “His broken chain, the tyrant Lord his crown, “The Priest his book, the Conqueror his wreath, “And from the lips of Truth one mighty breath “Shall, like a whirlwind, scatter in its breeze “That whole dark pile of human mockeries;— “Then shall the reign of mind commence on earth, “And starting fresh as from a second birth, “Man, in the sunshine of the world's new spring, “Shall walk transparent, like some holy thing! “Then, too, your Prophet from his angel brow “Shall cast the Veil that hides its splendours now, “And gladden'd Earth shall, through her wide expanse, “Bask in the glories of this countenance! “For thee, young warrior, welcome!—thou hast yet “Some tasks to learn, some frailties to forget, “Ere the white war-plume o'er thy brow can wave;— “But, once my own, mine all till in the grave!” The pomp is at an end—the crowds are gone— Each ear and heart still haunted by the tone Of that deep voice, which thrill'd like Alla's own! The Young all dazzled by the plumes and lances, The glittering throne, and Haram's half-caught glances; The Old deep pondering on the promis'd reign Of peace and truth; and all the female train Ready to risk their eyes, could they but gaze A moment on that brow's miraculous blaze! But there was one, among the chosen maids, Who blush'd behind the gallery's silken shades, One, to whose soul the pageant of to-day Has been like death:—you saw her pale dismay, Ye wondering sisterhood, and heard the burst Of exclamation from her lips, when first She saw that youth, too well, too dearly known, Silently kneeling at the Prophet's throne. Ah Zelica! there was a time, when bliss Shone o'er thy heart from every look of his; When but to see him, hear him, breathe the air In which he dwelt, was thy soul's fondest prayer; When round him hung such a perpetual spell, Whate'er he did, none ever did so well. Too happy days! when, if he touch'd a flower Or gem of thine, 'twas sacred from that hour; When thou didst study him till every tone And gesture and dear look became thy own,— Thy voice like his, the changes of his face In thine reflected with still lovelier grace, Like echo, sending back sweet music, fraught With twice the' aërial sweetness it had brought! Yet now he comes,—brighter than even he E'er beam'd before,—but, ah! not bright for thee; No—dread, unlook'd for, like a visitant From the' other world, he comes as if to haunt Thy guilty soul with dreams of lost delight, Long lost to all but memory's aching sight:— Sad dreams! as when the Spirit of our Youth Returns in sleep, sparkling with all the truth And innocence once ours, and leads us back, In mournful mockery, o'er the shining track Of our young life, and points out every ray Of hope and peace we've lost upon the way! Once happy pair!—In proud Bokhara's groves, Who had not heard of their first youthful loves? Born by that ancient flood The Amoo, which rises in the Belur Tag, or Dark Mountains, and running nearly from east to west, splits into two branches; one of which falls into the Caspian sea, and the other into Aral Nahr, or the Lake of Eagles., which from its spring In the dark Mountains swiftly wandering, Enrich'd by every pilgrim brook that shines With relics from Bucharia's ruby mines, And, lending to the Caspian half its strength, In the cold Lake of Eagles sinks at length;— There, on the banks of that bright river born, The flowers, that hung above its wave at morn, Bless'd not the waters, as they murmur'd by, With holier scent and lustre, than the sigh And virgin-glance of first affection cast Upon their youth's smooth current, as it pass'd! But war disturb'd this vision,—far away From her fond eyes summon'd to join the' array Of Persia's warriors on the hills of Thrace, The youth exchang'd his sylvan dwelling-place For the rude tent and war-field's deathful clash; His Zelica's sweet glances for the flash Of Grecian wild-fire, and Love's gentle chains For bleeding bondage on Byzantium's plains. Month after month, in widowhood of soul Drooping, the maiden saw two summers roll Their suns away—but, ah, how cold and dim Ev'n summer suns, when not beheld with him! From time to time ill-omen'd rumours came, Like spirit-tongues, mutt'ring the sick man's name, Just ere he dies:—at length those sounds of dread Fell withering on her soul, “Azim is dead!” Oh Grief, beyond all other griefs, when fate First leaves the young heart lone and desolate In the wide world, without that only tie For which it lov'd to live or fear'd to die;— Lorn as the hung-up lute, that ne'er hath spoken Since the sad day its master-chord was broken! Fond maid, the sorrow of her soul was such, Ev'n reason sunk,—blighted beneath its touch; And though, ere long, her sanguine spirit rose Above the first dead pressure of its woes, Though health and bloom return'd, the delicate chain Of thought, once tangled, never clear'd again. Warm, lively, soft as in youth's happiest day, The mind was still all there, but turn'd astray;— A wandering bark, upon whose pathway shone All stars of heaven, except the guiding one! Again she smil'd, nay, much and brightly smil'd, But 'twas a lustre, strange, unreal, wild; And when she sung to her lute's touching strain, 'Twas like the notes, half ecstasy, half pain, The bulbul The nightingale. utters, ere her soul depart, When, vanquish'd by some minstrel's powerful art, She dies upon the lute whose sweetness broke her heart! Such was the mood in which that mission found Young Zelica,—that mission, which around The Eastern world, in every region blest With woman's smile, sought out its loveliest, To grace that galaxy of lips and eyes Which the Veil'd Prophet destin'd for the skies:— And such quick welcome as a spark receives Dropp'd on a bed of Autumn's wither'd leaves, Did every tale of these enthusiasts find In the wild maiden's sorrow-blighted mind. All fire at once the madd'ning zeal she caught;— Elect of Paradise! blest, rapturous thought! Predestin'd bride, in heaven's eternal dome, Of some brave youth—ha! durst they say “of some?” No—of the one, one only object trac'd In her heart's core too deep to be effac'd; The one whose memory, fresh as life, is twin'd With every broken link of her lost mind; Whose image lives, though Reason's self be wreck'd, Safe 'mid the ruins of her intellect! Alas, poor Zelica! it needed all The fantasy, which held thy mind in thrall, To see in that gay Haram's glowing maids A sainted colony for Eden's shades; Or dream that he,—of whose unholy flame Thou wert too soon the victim,—shining came From Paradise, to people its pure sphere With souls like thine, which he hath ruin'd here! No—had not reason's light totally set, And left thee dark, thou hadst an amulet In the lov'd image, graven on thy heart, Which would have sav'd thee from the tempter's art, And kept alive, in all its bloom of breath, That purity, whose fading is love's death!— But lost, inflam'd,—a restless zeal took place Of the mild virgin's still and feminine grace; First of the Prophet's favourites, proudly first In zeal and charms,—too well the' Impostor nurs'd Her soul's delirium, in whose active flame, Thus lighting up a young, luxuriant frame, He saw more potent sorceries to bind To his dark yoke the spirits of mankind, More subtle chains than hell itself e'er twin'd. No art was spar'd, no witchery;—all the skill His demons taught him was employ'd to fill Her mind with gloom and ecstasy by turns— That gloom, through which Frenzy but fiercer burns; That ecstasy, which from the depth of sadness Glares like the maniac's moon, whose light is madness! 'Twas from a brilliant banquet, where the sound Of poesy and music breath'd around, Together picturing to her mind and ear The glories of that heav'n, her destin'd sphere, Where all was pure, where every stain that lay Upon the spirit's light should pass away, And, realizing more than youthful love E'er wish'd or dream'd, she should for ever rove Through fields of fragrance by her Azim's side, His own bless'd, purified, eternal bride!— 'Twas from a scene, a witching trance like this, He hurried her away, yet breathing bliss, To the dim charnel-house;—through all its steams Of damp and death, led only by those gleams Which foul Corruption lights, as with design To show the gay and proud she too can shine— And, passing on through upright ranks of Dead, Which to the maiden, doubly craz'd by dread, Seem'd, through the bluish death-light round them cast, To move their lips in mutterings as she pass'd— There, in that awful place, when each had quaff'd And pledg'd in silence such a fearful draught, Such—oh! the look and taste of that red bowl Will haunt her till she dies—he bound her soul By a dark oath, in hell's own language fram'd, Never, while earth his mystic presence claim'd, While the blue arch of day hung o'er them both, Never, by that all-imprecating oath, In joy or sorrow from his side to sever.— She swore, and the wide charnel echoed, “Never, never!” From that dread hour, entirely, wildly given To him and—she believ'd, lost maid!—to heaven; Her brain, her heart, her passions all inflam'd, How proud she stood, when in full Haram nam'd The Priestess of the Faith!—how flash'd her eyes With light, alas, that was not of the skies, When round, in trances, only less than hers, She saw the Haram kneel, her prostrate worshippers. Well might Mokanna think that form alone Had spells enough to make the world his own:— Light, lovely limbs, to which the spirit's play Gave motion, airy as the dancing spray, When from its stem the small bird wings away: Lips in whose rosy labyrinth, when she smil'd, The soul was lost; and blushes, swift and wild As are the momentary meteors sent Across the' uncalm, but beauteous firmament. And then her look—oh! where's the heart so wise Could unbewilder'd meet those matchless eyes? Quick, restless, strange, but exquisite withal, Like those of angels, just before their fall; Now shadow'd with the shames of earth—now crost By glimpses of the Heav'n her heart had lost; In every glance there broke, without controul, The flashes of a bright, but troubled soul; Where sensibility still wildly play'd, Like lightning, round the ruins it had made! And such was now young Zelica—so chang'd From her who, some years since, delighted rang'd The almond groves that shade Bokhara's tide, All life and bliss, with Azim by her side! So alter'd was she now, this festal day, When, 'mid the proud Divan's dazzling array, The vision of that Youth whom she had lov'd, Had wept as dead, before her breath'd and mov'd;— When—bright, she thought, as if from Eden's track But half-way trodden, he had wander'd back Again to earth, glistening with Eden's light— Her beauteous Azim shone before her sight. O Reason! who shall say what spells renew, When least we look for it, thy broken clew! Through what small vistas o'er the darken'd brain Thy intellectual day-beam bursts again; And how, like forts, to which beleaguerers win Unhop'd-for entrance through some friend within, One clear idea, wakened in the breast By memory's magic, lets in all the rest. Would it were thus, unhappy girl, with thee! But though light came, it came but partially; Enough to show the maze, in which thy sense Wander'd about,—but not to guide it thence; Enough to glimmer o'er the yawning wave, But not to point the harbour which might save. Hours of delight and peace, long left behind, With that dear form came rushing o'er her mind; But, oh! to think how deep her soul had gone In shame and falsehood since those moments shone; And, then, her oath—there madness lay again, And, shuddering, back she sunk into her chain Of mental darkness, as if blest to flee From light, whose every glimpse was agony! Yet, one relief this glance of former years Brought, mingled with its pain,—tears, floods of tears, Long frozen at her heart, but now like rills Let loose in spring-time from the snowy hills, And gushing warm, after a sleep of frost, Through valleys where their flow had long been lost. Sad and subdued, for the first time her frame Trembled with horror, when the summons came (A summons proud and rare, which all but she, And she, till now, had heard with ecstasy,) To meet Mokanna at his place of prayer, A garden oratory, cool and fair, By the stream's side, where still at close of day The Prophet of the Veil retir'd to pray; Sometimes alone—but, oftener far, with one, One chosen nymph to share his orison. Of late none found such favour in his sight As the young Priestess; and though, since that night When the death-caverns echoed every tone Of the dire oath that made her all his own, The' Impostor, sure of his infatuate prize, Had, more than once, thrown off his soul's disguise, And utter'd such unheav'nly, monstrous things, As ev'n across the desperate wanderings Of a weak intellect, whose lamp was out, Threw startling shadows of dismay and doubt;— Yet zeal, ambition, her tremendous vow, The thought, still haunting her, of that bright brow, Whose blaze, as yet from mortal eye conceal'd, Would soon, proud triumph! be to her reveal'd, To her alone;—and then the hope, most dear, Most wild of all, that her trangression here Was but a passage through earth's grosser fire, From which the spirit would at last aspire, Ev'n purer than before,—as perfumes rise Through flame and smoke, most welcome to the skies— And that when Azim's fond, divine embrace Should circle her in heav'n, no darkening trace Would on that bosom he once lov'd remain, But all be bright, be pure, be his again!— These were the wildering dreams, whose curst deceit Had chain'd her soul beneath the tempter's feet, And made her think ev'n damning falsehood sweet. But now that Shape, which had appall'd her view, That Semblance—oh how terrible, if true! Which came across her frenzy's full career With shock of consciousness, cold, deep, severe, As when, in northern seas, at midnight dark, An isle of ice encounters some swift bark, And, startling all its wretches from their sleep, By one cold impulse hurls them to the deep;— So came that shock not frenzy's self could bear, And waking up each long-lull'd image there, But check'd her headlong soul, to sink it in despair! Wan and dejected, through the evening dusk, She now went slowly to that small kiosk, Where, pondering alone his impious schemes, Mokanna waited her—too wrapt in dreams Of the fair-ripening future's rich success, To heed the sorrow, pale and spiritless, That sat upon his victim's downcast brow, Or mark how slow her step, how alter'd now From the quick, ardent Priestess, whose light bound Came like a spirit's o'er the' unechoing ground,— From that wild Zelica, whose every glance Was thrilling fire, whose every thought a trance! Upon his couch the Veil'd Mokanna lay, While lamps around—not such as lend their ray, Glimmering and cold, to those who nightly pray In holy Koom The cities of Com (or Koom) and Cashan are full of mosques, mausoleums, and sepulchres of the descendants of Ali, the Saints of Persia. —Chardin., or Mecca's dim arcades,— But brilliant, soft, such lights as lovely maids Look loveliest in, shed their luxurious glow Upon his mystic Veil's white glittering flow. Beside him, 'stead of beads and books of prayer, Which the world fondly thought he mused on there, Stood Vases, fill'd with Kishmee's An island in the Persian Gulf, celebrated for its white wine. golden wine, And the red weepings of the Shiraz vine; Of which his curtain'd lips full many a draught Took zealously, as if each drop they quaff'd, Like Zemzem's Spring of Holiness The miraculous well at Mecca; so called, says Sale, from the murmuring of its waters., had power To freshen the soul's virtues into flower! And still he drank and ponder'd—nor could see The' approaching maid, so deep his reverie; At length, with fiendish laugh, like that which broke From Eblis at the Fall of Man, he spoke:— “Yes, ye vile race, for hell's amusement given, “Too mean for earth, yet claiming kin with heaven; “God's images, forsooth!—such gods as he “Whom India serves, the monkey deity The god Hannaman.—“Apes are in many parts of India highly venerated, out of respect to the God Hannaman, a deity partaking of the form of that race.” —Pennant's Hindoostan. See a curious account, in Stephen's Persia, of a solemn embassy from some part of the Indies to Goa, when the Portuguese were there, offering vast treasures for the recovery of a monkey's tooth, which they held in great veneration, and which had been taken away upon the conquest of the kingdom of Jafanapatan.;— “Ye creatures of a breath, proud things of clay, “To whom if Lucifer, as grandams say, “Refus'd, though at the forfeit of heaven's light, “To bend in worship, Lucifer was right! This resolution of Eblis not to acknowledge the new creature, man, was, according to Mahometan tradition, thus adopted:—“The earth (which God had selected for the materials of his work) was carried into Arabia to a place between Mecca and Tayef, where, being first kneaded by the angels, it was afterwards fashioned by God himself into a human form, and left to dry for the space of forty days, or, as others say, as many years; the angels, in the mean time, often visiting it, and Eblis (then one of the angels nearest to God's presence, afterwards the devil) among the rest; but he, not contented with looking at it, kicked it with his foot till it rung; and knowing God designed that creature to be his superior, took a secret resolution never to acknowledge him as such.” —Sale on the Koran.— “Soon shall I plant this foot upon the neck “Of your foul race, and without fear or check, “Luxuriating in hate, avenge my shame, “My deep-felt, long-nurst loathing of man's name!— “Soon at the head of myriads, blind and fierce “As hooded falcons, through the universe “I'll sweep my darkening, desolating way, “Weak man my instrument, curst man my prey! “Ye wise, ye learn'd, who grope your dull way on “By the dim twinkling gleams of ages gone, “Like superstitious thieves, who think the light “From dead men's marrow guides them best at night A kind of lantern formerly used by robbers, called the Hand of Glory, the candle for which was made of the fat of a dead malefactor. This, however, was rather a western than an eastern superstition.— “Ye shall have honours—wealth,—yes, Sages, yes— “I know, grave fools, your wisdom's nothingness; “Undazzled it can track you starry sphere, “But a gilt stick, a bawble blinds it here. “How I shall laugh, when trumpeted along, “In lying speech, and still more lying song, “By these learn'd slaves, the meanest of the throng; “Their wits bought up, their wisdom shrunk so small, “A sceptre's puny point can wield it all! “Ye too, believers of incredible creeds, “Whose faith enshrines the monsters which it breeds; “Who, bolder ev'n than Nemrod, think to rise, “By nonsense heap'd on nonsense, to the skies; “Ye shall have miracles, aye, sound ones too, “Seen, heard, attested, every thing—but true. “Your preaching zealots, too inspir'd to seek “One grace of meaning for the things they speak; “Your martyrs, ready to shed out their blood, “For truths too heavenly to be understood; “And your State Priests, sole vendors of the lore, “That works salvation;—as, on Ava's shore, “Where none but priests are privileg'd to trade “In that best marble of which Gods are made The material of which images of Gaudma (the Birman Deity) are made, is held sacred. “Birmans may not purchase the marble in mass, but are suffered, and indeed encouraged, to buy figures of the Deity ready made.” —Symes's Ava, vol. ii. p. 376.; “They shall have mysteries—aye, precious stuff “For knaves to thrive by—mysteries enough; “Dark, tangled doctrines, dark as fraud can weave, “Which simple votaries shall on trust receive, “While craftier feign belief, till they believe. “A Heav'n too ye must have, ye lords of dust,— “A splendid Paradise,—pure souls, ye must: “That Prophet ill sustains his holy call, “Who finds not heav'ns to suit the tastes of all; “Houris for boys, omniscience for sages, “And wings and glories for all ranks and ages. “Vain things!—as lust or vanity inspires, “The heav'n of each is but what each desires, “And, soul or sense, whate'er the object be, “Man would be man to all eternity! “So let him—Eblis! grant this crowning curse, “But keep him what he is, no Hell were worse.” “Oh my lost soul!” exclaim'd the shuddering maid, Whose ears had drunk like poison all he said:— Mokanna started—not abash'd, afraid,— He knew no more of fear than one who dwells Beneath the tropics knows of icicles! But, in those dismal words that reach'd his ear, “Oh my lost soul!” there was a sound so drear, So like that voice, among the sinful dead, In which the legend o'er Hell's Gate is read, That, new as 'twas from her, whom nought could dim Or sink till now, it startled even him. “Ha, my fair Priestess!”—thus, with ready wile, The' impostor turn'd to greet her—“thou, whose smile “Hath inspiration in its rosy beam “Beyond the' Enthusiast's hope or Prophet's dream; “Light of the Faith! who twin'st religion's zeal “So close with love's, men know not which they feel, “Nor which to sigh for, in their trance of heart, “The heav'n thou preachest or the heav'n thou art! “What should I be without thee? without thee “How dull were power, how joyless victory! “Though borne by angels, if that smile of thine “Bless'd not my banner, 'twere but half divine. “But—why so mournful, child? those eyes, that shone “All life last night—what!—is their glory gone? “Come, come—this morn's fatigue hath made them pale, “They want rekindling—suns themselves would fail “Did not their comets bring, as I to thee, “From light's own fount supplies of brilliancy. “Thou seest this cup—no juice of earth is here, “But the pure waters of that upper sphere, “Whose rills o'er ruby beds and topaz flow, “Catching the gem's bright colour, as they go. “Nightly my Genii come and fill these urns— “Nay, drink,—in every drop life's essence burns; “'Twill make that soul all fire, those eyes all light— “Come, come, I want thy loveliest smiles to-night: “There is a youth—why start?—thou saw'st him then; “Look'd he not nobly? such the godlike men “Thou'lt have to woo thee in the bowers above;— “Though he, I fear, hath thoughts too stern for love, “Too rul'd by that cold enemy of bliss “The world calls virtue—we must conquer this; “Nay, shrink not, pretty sage!

At first, tho' mute she listen'd, like a dream Seem'd all he said: nor could her mind, whose beam As yet was weak, penetrate half his scheme. But when, at length, he utter'd, “Thou art she!” All flash'd at once, and shrieking piteously, “Oh not for worlds!” she cried—“Great God! to whom “I once knelt innocent, is this my doom? “Are all my dreams, my hopes of heavenly bliss, “My purity, my pride, then come to this,— “To live, the wanton of a fiend! to be “The pander of his guilt—oh infamy! “And sunk, myself, as low as hell can steep “In its hot flood, drag others down as deep! “Others—ha! yes—that youth who came today— “Not him I lov'd—not him—oh! do but say, “But swear to me this moment 'tis not he, “And I will serve, dark fiend, will worship even thee!” “Beware, young raving thing!—in time beware, “Nor utter what I cannot, must not bear, “Ev'n from thy lips.

The same circumstance is related of the lapwing, as a fact to which he was witness, by Paul Lucas, Voyage fait en 1714. The ancient story concerning the Trochilus, or hummingbird, entering with impunity into the mouth of the crocodile, is firmly believed at Java. —Barrow's Cochin-China. “And so thou'lt fly, forsooth?—what!—give up all “Thy chaste dominion in the Haram Hall, “Where now to Love and now to Alla given, “Half mistress and half saint, thou hang'st as even “As doth Medina's tomb, 'twixt hell and heaven! “Thou'lt fly?—as easily may reptiles run, “The gaunt snake once hath fix'd his eyes upon; “As easily, when caught, the prey may be “Pluck'd from his loving folds, as thou from me. “No, no, 'tis fix'd—let good or ill betide, “Thou'rt mine till death, till death Mokanna's bride! “Hast thou forgot thy oath?”— At this dread word, The Maid, whose spirit his rude taunts had stirr'd Through all its depths, and rous'd an anger there, That burst and lighten'd even through her despair— Shrunk back, as if a blight were in the breath That spoke that word, and stagger'd pale as death. “Yes, my sworn bride, let others seek in bowers “Their bridal place—the charnel vault was ours! “Instead of scents and balms, for thee and me “Rose the rich steams of sweet mortality; “Gay, flickering death-lights shone while we were wed, “And, for our guests, a row of goodly Dead, “(Immortal spirits in their time, no doubt,) “From reeking shrouds upon the rite look'd out! “That oath thou heard'st more lips than thine repeat— “That cup—thou shudderest, Lady,—was it sweet? “That cup we pledg'd, the charnel's choicest wine, “Hath bound thee—aye—body and soul all mine; “Bound thee by chains that, whether blest or curst “No matter now, not hell itself shall burst! “Hence, woman, to the Haram, and look gay, “Look wild, look—any thing but sad; yet stay— “One moment more—from what this night hath pass'd, “I see thou know'st me, know'st me well at last. “Ha! ha! and so, fond thing, thou thought'st all true, “And that I love mankind?—I do, I do— “As victims, love them; as the sea-dog doats “Upon the small, sweet fry that round him floats; “Or, as the Nile-bird loves the slime that gives “That rank and venomous food on which she lives?

Prepare thy soul, young Azim!—thou hast braved The bands of Greece, still mighty though enslaved; Hast faced her phalanx, arm'd with all its fame, Her Macedonian pikes and globes of flame; All this hast fronted, with firm heart and brow, But a more perilous trial waits thee now,— Woman's bright eyes, a dazzling host of eyes From every land where woman smiles or sighs; Of every hue, as Love may chance to raise His black or azure banner in their blaze; And each sweet mode of warfare, from the flash That lightens boldly through the shadowy lash, To the sly, stealing splendours, almost hid, Like swords half-sheath'd, beneath the downcast lid;— Such, Azim, is the lovely, luminous host Now led against thee; and, let conquerors boast Their fields of fame, he who in virtue arms A young, warm spirit against beauty's charms, Who feels her brightness, yet defies her thrall, Is the best, bravest conqueror of them all. Now, through the Haram chambers, moving lights And busy shapes proclaim the toilet's rites;— From room to room the ready handmaids hie, Some skill'd to wreath the turban tastefully, Or hang the veil, in negligence of shade, O'er the warm blushes of the youthful maid, Who, if between the folds but one eye shone, Like Seba's Queen could vanquish with that one “Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes.” —Sol. Song.:— While some bring leaves of Henna, to imbue The fingers' ends with a bright roseate hue “They tinged the ends of her fingers scarlet with Henna, so that they resembled branches of coral.” —Story of Prince Futtun in Bahardanush., So bright, that in the mirror's depth they seem Like tips of coral branches in the stream: And others mix the Kohol's jetty dye, To give that long, dark languish to the eye “The women blacken the inside of their eyelids with a powder named the black Kohol.” —Russel. “None of these ladies,” says Shaw, “take themselves to be completely dressed, till they have tinged the hair and edges of their eyelids with the powder of lead ore. Now, as this operation is performed by dipping first into the powder a small wooden bodkin of the thickness of a quill, and then drawing it afterwards through the eyelids over the ball of the eye, we shall have a lively image of what the Prophet (Jer. iv. 30.) may be supposed to mean by rending the eyes with painting. This practice is no doubt of great antiquity; for besides the instance already taken notice of, we find that where Jezebel is said (2 Kings, ix. 30.) to have painted her face, the original words are, she adjusted her eyes with the powder of lead-ore.” —Shaw's Travels., Which makes the maids, whom kings are proud to cull From fair Circassia's vales, so beautiful. All is in motion; rings and plumes and pearls Are shining every where:—some younger girls Are gone by moonlight to the garden-beds, To gather fresh, cool chaplets for their heads;— Gay creatures! sweet, though mournful, 'tis to see How each prefers a garland from that tree Which brings to mind her childhood's innocent day, And the dear fields and friendships far away. The maid of India, blest again to hold In her full lap the Champac's leaves of gold “The appearance of the blossoms of the gold-coloured Campac on the black hair of the Indian women has supplied the Sanscrit Poets with many elegant allusions.” —See Asiatic Researches, vol. iv., Thinks of the time when, by the Ganges' flood, Her little play-mates scatter'd many a bud Upon her long black hair, with glossy gleam Just dripping from the consecrated stream; While the young Arab, haunted by the smell Of her own mountain flowers, as by a spell,— The sweet Elcaya A tree famous for its perfume, and common on the hills of Yemen. —Niebuhr., and that courteous tree Which bows to all who seek its canopy Of the genus mimosa, “which droops its branches whenever any person approaches it, seeming as if it saluted those who retire under its shade.” —Niebuhr., Sees, call'd up round her by these magic scents, The well, the camels, and her father's tents; Sighs for the home she left with little pain, And wishes ev'n its sorrows back again! Meanwhile, through vast illuminated halls, Silent and bright, where nothing but the falls Of fragrant waters, gushing with cool sound From many a jasper fount, is heard around, Young Azim roams bewilder'd,—nor can guess What means this maze of light and loneliness. Here, the way leads, o'er tesselated floors Or mats of Cairo, through long corridors, Where, rang'd in cassolets and silver urns, Sweet wood of aloe or of sandal burns; And spicy rods, such as illume at night The bowers of Tibet “Cloves are a principal ingredient in the composition of the perfumed rods, which men of rank keep constantly burning in their presence.” —Turner's Tibet., send forth odorous light, Like Peris' wands, when pointing out the road For some pure Spirit to its blest abode:— And here, at once, the glittering saloon Bursts on his sight, boundless and bright as noon; Where, in the midst, reflecting back the rays In broken rainbows, a fresh fountain plays High as the' enamell'd cupola, which towers All rich with Arabesques of gold and flowers: And the mosaic floor beneath shines through The sprinkling of that fountain's silv'ry dew, Like the wet, glistening shells, of every dye, That on the margin of the Red Sea lie. Here too he traces the kind visitings Of woman's love in those fair, living things Of land and wave, whose fate—in bondage thrown For their weak loveliness—is like her own! On one side gleaming with a sudden grace Through water, brilliant as the crystal vase In which it undulates, small fishes shine, Like golden ingots from a fairy mine;— While, on the other, latticed lightly in With odoriferous woods of Comorin “C'est d'où vient le bois d'aloes, que les Arabes appellent Oud Comari, et celui du sandal, qui s'y trouve en grande quantité.” —D' Herbelot., Each brilliant bird that wings the air is seen;— Gay, sparkling loories, such as gleam between The crimson blossoms of the coral tree “Thousands of variegated loories visit the coral-trees.” —Barrow.

So on, through scenes past all imagining, More like the luxuries of that impious King Shedad, who made the delicious gardens of Irim, in imitation of Paradise, and was destroyed by lightning the first time he attempted to enter them., Whom Death's dark Angel, with his lightning torch, Struck down and blasted even in Pleasure's porch, Than the pure dwelling of a Prophet sent, Arm'd with Heav'n's sword, for man's enfranchisement— Young Azim wander'd, looking sternly round, His simple garb and war-boots' clanking sound But ill according with the pomp and grace And silent lull of that voluptuous place. “Is this, then,” thought the youth, “is this the way “To free man's spirit from the deadening sway “Of worldly sloth,—to teach him while he lives, “To know no bliss but that which virtue gives, “And when he dies, to leave his lofty name “A light, a landmark on the cliffs of fame? “It was not so, Land of the generous thought “And daring deed, thy god-like sages taught; “It was not thus, in bowers of wanton ease, “Thy Freedom nurs'd her sacred energies; “Oh! not beneath the' enfeebling, withering glow “Of such dull luxury did those myrtles grow, “With which she wreath'd her sword, when she would dare “Immortal deeds; but in the bracing air “Of toil,—of temperance,—of that high, rare, “Ethereal virtue, which alone can breathe “Life, health, and lustre into Freedom's wreath. “Who, that surveys this span of earth we press,— “This speck of life in time's great wilderness, “This narrow isthmus 'twixt two boundless seas, “The past, the future, two eternities!— “Would sully the bright spot, or leave it bare, “When he might build him a proud temple there, “A name, that long shall hallow all its space, “And be each purer soul's high resting-place. “But no—it cannot be, that one, whom God “Has sent to break the wizard Falsehood's rod,— “A Prophet of the Truth, whose mission draws “Its rights from Heaven, should thus profane its cause “With the world's vulgar pomps;—no, no,—I see— “He thinks me weak—this glare of luxury “Is but to tempt, to try the eaglet gaze “Of my young soul—shine on, 'twill stand the blaze!” So thought the youth;—but, ev'n while he defied This witching scene, he felt its witchery glide Through ev'ry sense. The perfume breathing round, Like a pervading spirit;—the still sound Of falling waters, lulling as the song Of Indian bees at sunset, when they throng Around the fragrant Nilica, and deep In its blue blossoms hum themselves to sleep “My Pandits assure me that the plant before us (the Nilica) is their Sephalica, thus named because the bees are supposed to sleep on its blossoms.” —Sir W. Jones.; And music, too—dear music! that can touch Beyond all else the soul that loves it much— Now heard far off, so far as but to seem Like the faint, exquisite music of a dream; All was too much for him, too full of bliss, The heart could nothing feel, that felt not this; Soften'd he sunk upon a couch, and gave His soul up to sweet thoughts, like wave on wave Succeeding in smooth seas, when storms are laid; He thought of Zelica, his own dear maid, And of the time when, full of blissful sighs, They sat and look'd into each other's eyes, Silent and happy—as if God had given Nought else worth looking at on this side heaven. “Oh, my lov'd mistress, thou, whose spirit still “Is with me, round me, wander where I will— “It is for thee, for thee alone I seek “The paths of glory; to light up thy cheek “With warm approval—in that gentle look, “To read my praise, as in an angel's book, “And think all toils rewarded, when from thee “I gain a smile worth immortality! “How shall I bear the moment, when restor'd “To that young heart where I alone am Lord, “Though of such bliss unworthy,—since the best “Alone deserve to be the happiest:— “When from those lips, unbreathed upon for years, “I shall again kiss off the soul-felt tears, “And find those tears warm as when last they started, “Those sacred kisses pure as when we parted. “O my own life!—why should a single day, “A moment keep me from those arms away?” While thus he thinks, still nearer on the breeze Come those delicious, dream-like harmonies, Each note of which but adds new, downy links To the soft chain in which his spirit sinks. He turns him tow'rd the sound, and far away Through a long vista, sparkling with the play Of countless lamps,—like the rich track which Day Leaves on the waters, when he sinks from us, So long the path, its light so tremulous;— He sees a group of female forms advance, Some chain'd together in the mazy dance By fetters, forg'd in the green sunny bowers, As they were captives to the King of Flowers “They deferred it till the King of Flowers should ascend his throne of enamelled foliage.” —The Bahardanush.; And some disporting round, unlink'd and free, Who seem'd to mock their sisters' slavery; And round and round them still, in wheeling flight Went, like gay moths about a lamp at night; While others wak'd, as gracefully along Their feet kept time, the very soul of song From psaltery, pipe, and lutes of heavenly thrill, Or their own youthful voices, heavenlier still. And now they come, now pass before his eye, Forms such as Nature moulds, when she would vie With Fancy's pencil, and give birth to things Lovely beyond its fairest picturings. Awhile they dance before him, then divide, Breaking, like rosy clouds at even-tide Around the rich pavilion of the sun,— Till silently dispersing, one by one, Through many a path, that from the chamber leads To gardens, terraces, and moonlight meads, Their distant laughter comes upon the wind, And but one trembling nymph remains behind,— Beck'ning them back in vain, for they are gone, And she is left in all that light alone; No veil to curtain o'er her beauteous brow, In its young bashfulness more beauteous now; But a light golden chain-work round her hair “One of the head-dresses of the Persian women is composed of a light golden chain-work, set with small pearls, with a thin gold plate pendant, about the bigness of a crown-piece, on which is impressed an Arabian prayer, and which hangs upon the cheek below the ear.” —Hanway's Travels., Such as the maids of Yezd “Certainly the women of Yezd are the handsomest women in Persia. The proverb is, that to live happy a man must have a wife of Yezd, eat the bread of Yezdecas, and drink the wine of Shiraz.” —Tavernier. and Shiras wear, From which, on either side, gracefully hung A golden amulet, in the' Arab tongue, Engraven o'er with some immortal line From Holy Writ, or bard scarce less divine; While her left hand, as shrinkingly she stood, Held a small lute of gold and sandal-wood, Which, once or twice, she touch'd with hurried strain, Then took her trembling fingers off again. But when at length a timid glance she stole At Azim, the sweet gravity of soul She saw through all his features calm'd her fear, And, like a half-tam'd antelope, more near, Though shrinking still, she came;—then sat her down Upon a musnud's Musnuds are cushioned seats, usually reserved for persons of distinction. edge, and, bolder grown, In the pathetic mode of Isfahan The Persians, like the ancient Greeks, call their musical modes or Perdas by the names of different countries or cities, as the mode of Isfahan, the mode of Irak, &amp;c. Touch'd a preluding strain, and thus began:— There's a bower of roses by Bendemeer's A river which flows near the ruins of Chilminar. stream, And the nightingale sings round it all the day long; In the time of my childhood 'twas like a sweet dream, To sit in the roses and hear the bird's song. That bower and its music I never forget, But oft when alone, in the bloom of the year, I think—is the nightingale singing there yet? Are the roses still bright by the calm Bendemeer? No, the roses soon wither'd that hung o'er the wave, But some blossoms were gather'd, while freshly they shone, And a dew was distill'd from their flowers, that gave All the fragrance of summer, when summer was gone. Thus memory draws from delight, ere it dies, An essence that breathes of it many a year; Thus bright to my soul, as 'twas then to my eyes, Is that bower on the banks of the calm Bendemeer! “Poor maiden!” thought the youth, “if thou wert sent, “With thy soft lute and beauty's blandishment, “To wake unholy wishes in this heart, “Or tempt its truth, thou little know'st the art. “For though thy lip should sweetly counsel wrong, “Those vestal eyes would disavow its song. “But thou hast breath'd such purity, thy lay “Returns so fondly to youth's virtuous day, “And leads thy soul—if e'er it wander'd thence— “So gently back to its first innocence, “That I would sooner stop the unchained dove, “When swift returning to its home of love, “And round its snowy wing new fetters twine, “Than turn from virtue one pure wish of thine!” Scarce had this feeling pass'd, when, sparkling through The gently open'd curtains of light blue That veil'd the breezy casement, countless eyes, Peeping like stars through the blue evening skies, Look'd laughing in, as if to mock the pair That sat so still and melancholy there:— And now the curtains fly apart, and in From the cool air, 'mid showers of jessamine Which those without fling after them in play, Two lightsome maidens spring,—lightsome as they Who live in the' air on odours,—and around The bright saloon, scarce conscious of the ground, Chase one another, in a varying dance Of mirth and languor, coyness and advance, Too eloquently like love's warm pursuit:— While she, who sung so gently to the lute Her dream of home, steals timidly away, Shrinking as violets do in summer's ray,— But takes with her from Azim's heart that sigh We sometimes give to forms that pass us by In the world's crowd, too lovely to remain, Creatures of light we never see again! Around the white necks of the nymphs who danc'd Hung carcanets of orient gems, that glanc'd More brilliant than the sea-glass glittering o'er The hills of crystal on the Caspian shore “To the north of us (on the coast of the Caspian, near Badku,) was a mountain, which sparkled like diamonds, arising from the sea-glass and crystals with which it abounds.” —Journey of the Russian Ambassador to Persia, 1746.; While from their long, dark tresses, in a fall Of curls descending, bells as musical As those that, on the golden-shafted trees Of Eden, shake in the eternal breeze “To which will be added the sound of the bells, hanging on the trees, which will be put in motion by the wind proceeding from the throne of God, as often as the blessed wish for music.” —Sale., Rung round their steps, at every bound more sweet, As 'twere the' extatic language of their feet. At length the chase was o'er, and they stood wreath'd Within each other's arms; while soft there breath'd Through the cool casement, mingled with the sighs Of moonlight flowers, music that seem'd to rise From some still lake, so liquidly it rose; And, as it swell'd again at each faint close, The ear could track through all that maze of chords And young sweet voices, these impassion'd words:— A Spirit there is, whose fragrant sigh Is burning now through earth and air; Where cheeks are blushing, the Spirit is nigh, Where lips are meeting, the Spirit is there! His breath is the soul of flowers like these, And his floating eyes—oh! they resemble “Whose wanton eyes resemble blue water-lilies, agitated by the breeze.” —Jayadeva. Blue water-lilies The blue lotos, which grows in Cashmere and in Persia., when the breeze Is making the stream around them tremble. Hail to thee, hail to thee, kindling power! Spirit of Love, Spirit of Bliss! Thy holiest time is the moonlight hour, And there never was moonlight so sweet as this. By the fair and brave Who blushing unite, Like the sun and wave, When they meet at night; By the tear that shows When passion is nigh, As the rain-drop flows From the heat of the sky; By the first love-beat Of the youthful heart, By the bliss to meet, And the pain to part; By all that thou hast To mortals given, Which—oh, could it last, This earth were heaven! We call thee hither, entrancing Power! Spirit of Love! Spirit of Bliss! Thy holiest time is the moonlight hour, And there never was moonlight so sweet as this. Impatient of a scene, whose luxuries stole, Spite of himself, too deep into his soul, And where, midst all that the young heart loves most, Flowers, music, smiles, to yield was to be lost, The youth had started up, and turn'd away From the light nymphs, and their luxurious lay, To muse upon the pictures that hung round It has been generally supposed that the Mahometans prohibit all pictures of animals; but Toderini shows that, though the practice is forbidden by the Koran, they are not more averse to painted figures and images than other people. From Mr. Murphy's work, too, we find that the Arabs of Spain had no objection to the introduction of figures into painting.,— Bright images, that spoke without a sound, And views, like vistas into fairy ground. But here again new spells came o'er his sense:— All that the pencil's mute omnipotence Could call up into life, of soft and fair, Of fond and passionate, was glowing there; Nor yet too warm, but touch'd with that fine art Which paints of pleasure but the purer part; Which knows ev'n Beauty when half-veil'd is best,— Like her own radiant planet of the west, Whose orb when half retir'd looks loveliest. This is not quite astronomically true. “Dr. Hadley (says Keil) has shown that Venus is brightest when she is about forty degrees removed from the sun; and that then but only a fourth part of her lucid disk is to be seen from the earth.” There hung the history of the Genii-King, Trac'd through each gay, voluptuous wandering With her from Saba's bowers, in whose bright eyes He read that to be blest is to be wise For the loves of King Solomon (who was supposed to preside over the whole race of Genii) with Balkis, the Queen of Sheba or Saba, see D'Herbelot, and the Notes on the Koran, chap. 2. “In the palace which Solomon ordered to be built against the arrival of the Queen of Saba, the floor or pavement was of transparent glass, laid over running water, in which fish were swimming.” This led the Queen into a very natural mistake, which the Koran has not thought beneath its dignity to commemorate. “It was said unto her, ‘Enter the palace.’ And when she saw it she imagined it to be a great water; and she discovered her legs, by lifting up her robe to pass through it. Whereupon Solomon said to her, ‘Verily, this is the place evenly floored with glass.’” —Chap. 27.;— Here fond Zuleika The wife of Potiphar, thus named by the Orientals. The passion which this frail beauty of antiquity conceived for her young Hebrew slave has given rise to a much esteemed poem in the Persian language, entitled Yusef vau Zelikha, by Noureddin Jami; the manuscript copy of which, in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, is supposed to be the finest in the whole world.” —Note upon Nott's Translation of Hafez. woos with open arms The Hebrew boy, who flies from her young charms, Yet, flying, turns to gaze, and, half undone, Wishes that Heav'n and she could both be won; And here Mohammed, born for love and guile, Forgets the Koran in his Mary's smile;— Then beckons some kind angel from above With a new text to consecrate their love. The particulars of Mahomet's amour with Mary, the Coptic girl, in justification of which he added a new chapter to the Koran, may be found in Gagnier's Notes upon Abulfeda, p. 151. With rapid step, yet pleas'd and lingering eye, Did the youth pass these pictur'd stories by, And hasten'd to a casement, where the light Of the calm moon came in, and freshly bright The fields without were seen, sleeping as still As if no life remain'd in breeze or rill. Here paus'd he, while the music, now less near, Breath'd with a holier language on his ear, As though the distance, and that heavenly ray Through which the sounds came floating, took away All that had been too earthly in the lay. Oh! could he listen to such sounds unmov'd, And by that light—nor dream of her he lov'd? Dream on, unconscious boy! while yet thou may'st; 'Tis the last bliss thy soul shall ever taste. Clasp yet awhile her image to thy heart, Ere all the light, that made it dear, depart. Think of her smiles as when thou saw'st them last, Clear, beautiful, by nought of earth o'ercast; Recall her tears, to thee at parting given, Pure as they weep, if angels weep, in Heaven. Think, in her own still bower she waits thee now, With the same glow of heart and bloom of brow, Yet shrin'd in solitude—thine all, thine only, Like the one star above thee, bright and lonely. Oh! that a dream so sweet, so long enjoy'd, Should be so sadly, cruelly destroy'd! The song is hush'd, the laughing nymphs are flown, And he is left, musing of bliss, alone;— Alone?—no, not alone—that heavy sigh, That sob of grief, which broke from some one nigh— Whose could it be?—alas! is misery found Here, even here, on this enchanted ground? He turns, and sees a female form, close veil'd, Leaning, as if both heart and strength had fail'd, Against a pillar near;—not glittering o'er With gems and wreaths, such as the others wore, But in that deep-blue, melancholy dress “Deep blue is their mourning colour.” —Hanway., Bokhara's maidens wear in mindfulness Of friends or kindred, dead or far away;— And such as Zelica had on that day He left her—when, with heart too full to speak, He took away her last warm tears upon his cheek. A strange emotion stirs within him,—more Than mere compassion ever wak'd before; Unconsciously he opes his arms, while she Springs forward, as with life's last energy, But, swooning in that one convulsive bound, Sinks, ere she reach his arms, upon the ground;— Her veil falls off—her faint hands clasp his knees— 'Tis she herself!—'tis Zelica he sees! But, ah, so pale, so chang'd—none but a lover Could in that wreck of beauty's shrine discover The once ador'd divinity—ev'n he Stood for some moments mute, and doubtingly Put back the ringlets from her brow, and gaz'd Upon those lids, where once such lustre blaz'd, Ere he could think she was indeed his own, Own darling maid, whom he so long had known In joy and sorrow, beautiful in both; Who, ev'n when grief was heaviest—when loth He left her for the wars—in that worst hour Sat in her sorrow like the sweet night-flower The sorrowful nyctanthes, which begins to spread its rich odour after sunset., When darkness brings its weeping glories out, And spreads its sighs like frankincense about. “Look up, my Zelica—one moment show “Those gentle eyes to me, that I may know “Thy life, thy loveliness is not all gone, “But there, at least, shines as it ever shone. “Come, look upon thy Azim—one dear glance, “Like those of old, were heav'n! whatever chance “Hath brought thee here, oh, 'twas a blessed one! “There—my lov'd lips—they move—that kiss hath run “Like the first shoot of life through every vein, “And now I clasp her, mine, all mine again. “Oh the delight—now, in this very hour, “When had the whole rich world been in my power, “I should have singled out thee, only thee, “From the whole world's collected treasury— “To have thee here—to hang thus fondly o'er “My own, best, purest Zelica once more!” It was indeed the touch of those fond lips Upon her eyes that chas'd their short eclipse, And, gradual as the snow, at Heaven's breath, Melts off and shows the azure flowers beneath, Her lids unclos'd, and the bright eyes were seen Gazing on his—not, as they late had been, Quick, restless, wild, but mournfully serene; As if to lie, ev'n for that tranced minute, So near his heart, had consolation in it; And thus to wake in his belov'd caress Took from her soul one half its wretchedness. But, when she heard him call her good and pure, Oh, 'twas too much—too dreadful to endure! Shuddering she broke away from his embrace, And, hiding with both hands her guilty face, Said, in a tone whose anguish would have riven A heart of very marble, “Pure!—oh Heaven!”— That tone—those looks so chang'd—the withering blight, That sin and sorrow leave where'er they light; The dead despondency of those sunk eyes, Where once, had he thus met her by surprise, He would have seen himself, too happy boy, Reflected in a thousand lights of joy; And then the place,—that bright, unholy place, Where vice lay hid beneath each winning grace And charm of luxury, as the viper weaves Its wily covering of sweet balsam leaves “Concerning the vipers, which Pliny says were frequent among the balsam-trees, I made very particular inquiry; several were brought me alive both to Yambo and Jidda.” —Bruce.,— All struck upon his heart, sudden and cold As death itself;—it needs not to be told— No, no—he sees it all, plain as the brand Of burning shame can mark—whate'er the hand, That could from Heav'n and him such brightness sever, 'Tis done—to Heav'n and him she's lost for ever! It was a dreadful moment; not the tears, The lingering, lasting misery of years Could match that minute's anguish—all the worst Of sorrow's elements in that dark burst Broke o'er his soul, and with one crash of fate, Laid the whole hopes of his life desolate. “Oh! curse me not,” she cried, as wild he toss'd His desperate hand tow'rds Heav'n—“though I am lost, “Think not that guilt, that falsehood made me fall, “No, no—'twas grief, 'twas madness did it all! “Nay, doubt me not—though all thy love hath ceas'd— “I know it hath—yet, yet believe, at least, “That every spark of reason's light must be “Quench'd in this brain, ere I could stray from thee. “They told me thou wert dead—why, Azim, why “Did we not, both of us, that instant die “When we were parted? oh! could'st thou but know “With what a deep devotedness of woe “I wept thy absence—o'er and o'er again “Thinking of thee, still thee, till thought grew pain, “And memory, like a drop that, night and day, “Falls cold and ceaseless, wore my heart away. “Didst thou but know how pale I sat at home, “My eyes still turn'd the way thou wert to come, “And, all the long, long night of hope and fear, “Thy voice and step still sounding in my ear— “Oh God! thou would'st not wonder that, at last, “When every hope was all at once o'ercast, “When I heard frightful voices round me say “Azim is dead!—this wretched brain gave way, “And I became a wreck, at random driven, “Without one glimpse of reason or of Heaven— “All wild—and even this quenchless love within “Turn'd to foul fires to light me into sin!— “Thou pitiest me—I knew thou would'st—that sky “Hath nought beneath it half so lorn as I. “The fiend, who lur'd me hither—hist! come near, “Or thou too, thou art lost, if he should hear— “Told me such things—oh! with such devilish art, “As would have ruin'd ev'n a holier heart— “Of thee, and of that ever-radiant sphere, “Where bless'd at length, if I but serv'd him here, “I should for ever live in thy dear sight, “And drink from those pure eyes eternal light. “Think, think how lost, how madden'd I must be, “To hope that guilt could lead to God or thee! “Thou weep'st for me—do weep—oh, that I durst “Kiss off that tear! but, no—these lips are curst, “They must not touch thee;—one divine caress, “One blessed moment of forgetfulness “I've had within those arms, and that shall lie, “Shrin'd in my soul's deep memory till I die; “The last of joy's last relics here below, “The one sweet drop, in all this waste of woe, “My heart has treasur'd from affection's spring, “To soothe and cool its deadly withering! “But thou—yes, thou must go—for ever go; “This place is not for thee—for thee! oh no, “Did I but tell thee half, thy tortur'd brain “Would burn like mine, and mine go wild again! “Enough, that Guilt reigns here—that hearts, once good, “Now tainted, chill'd, and broken, are his food.— “Enough, that we are parted—that there rolls “A flood of headlong fate between our souls, “Whose darkness severs me as wide from thee “As hell from heav'n, to all eternity!” “Zelica, Zelica!” the youth exclaim'd, In all the tortures of a mind inflam'd Almost to madness—“by that sacred Heav'n, “Where yet, if pray'rs can move, thou'lt be forgiven, “As thou art here—here, in this writhing heart, “All sinful, wild, and ruin'd as thou art! “By the remembrance of our once pure love, “Which, like a church-yard light, still burns above “The grave of our lost souls—which guilt in thee “Cannot extinguish, nor despair in me! “I do conjure, implore thee to fly hence— “If thou hast yet one spark of innocence, “Fly with me from this place—” “With thee! oh bliss! “'Tis worth whole years of torment to hear this. “What! take the lost one with thee?—let her rove “By thy dear side, as in those days of love, “When we were both so happy, both so pure— “Too heavenly dream! if there's on earth a cure “For the sunk heart, 'tis this—day after day “To be the blest companion of thy way; “To hear thy angel eloquence—to see “Those virtuous eyes for ever turn'd on me; “And, in their light re-chasten'd silently, “Like the stain'd web that whitens in the sun, “Grow pure by being purely shone upon! “And thou wilt pray for me—I know thou wilt— “At the dim vesper hour, when thoughts of guilt “Come heaviest o'er the heart, thou'lt lift thine eyes, “Full of sweet tears, unto the dark'ning skies, “And plead for me with Heav'n, till I can dare “To fix my own weak, sinful glances there; “Till the good angels, when they see me cling “For ever near thee, pale and sorrowing, “Shall for thy sake pronounce my soul forgiven, “And bid thee take thy weeping slave to Heaven! “Oh yes, I'll fly with thee—” Scarce had she said These breathless words, when a voice deep and dread As that of Monker, waking up the dead From their first sleep—so startling 'twas to both— Rung through the casement near, “Thy oath! thy oath!” Oh Heav'n, the ghastliness of that Maid's look!— “'Tis he,” faintly she cried, while terror shook Her inmost core, nor durst she lift her eyes, Though through the casement, now, nought but the skies And moonlight fields were seen, calm as before— “'Tis he, and I am his—all, all is o'er— “Go—fly this instant, or thou'rt ruin'd too— “My oath, my oath, oh God!

Whose are the gilded tents that crowd the way, Where all was waste and silent yesterday? This City of War which, in a few short hours, Hath sprung up here “The Lescar or Imperial Camp is divided, like a regular town, into squares, alleys, and streets, and from a rising ground furnishes one of the most agreeable prospects in the world. Starting up in a few hours in an uninhabited plain, it raises the idea of a city built by enchantment. Even those who leave their houses in cities to follow the prince in his progress are frequently so charmed with the Lescar, when situated in a beautiful and convenient place, that they cannot prevail with themselves to remove. To prevent this inconvenience to the court, the Emperor, after sufficient time is allowed to the tradesmen to follow, orders them to be burnt out of their tents. —Dow's Hindostan. Colonel Wilks gives a lively picture of an Eastern encampment:—“His camp, like that of most Indian armies, exhibited a motley collection of covers from the scorching sun and dews of the night, variegated according to the taste or means of each individual, by extensive inclosures of coloured calico surrounding superb suites of tents; by ragged cloths or blankets stretched over sticks or branches; palm leaves hastily spread over similar supports; handsome tents and splendid canopies; horses, oxen, elephants, and camels; all intermixed without any exterior mark of order or design, except the flags of the chiefs, which usually mark the centres of a congeries of these masses; the only regular part of the encampment being the streets of shops, each of which is constructed nearly in the manner of a booth at an English fair.” —Historical Sketches of the South of India., as if the magic powers Of Him who, in the twinkling of a star, Built the high pillar'd halls of Chilminar The edifices of Chilminar and Balbec are supposed to have been built by the Genii, acting under the orders of Jan ben Jan, who governed the world long before the time of Adam., Had conjur'd up, far as the eye can see, This world of tents, and domes, and sun-bright armory:— Princely pavilions, screen'd by many a fold Of crimson cloth, and topp'd with balls of gold:— Steeds, with their housings of rich silver spun, Their chains and poitrels glittering in the sun; And camels, tufted o'er with Yemen's shells “A superb camel, ornamented with strings and tufts of small shells.” —Ali Bey., Shaking in every breeze their light-ton'd bells! But yester-eve, so motionless around, So mute was this wide plain, that not a sound But the far torrent, or the locust bird A native of Khorassan, and allured southward by means of the water of a fountain between Shiraz and Ispahan, called the Fountain of Birds, of which it is so fond that it will follow wherever that water is carried. Hunting among the thickets, could be heard;— Yet hark! what discords now, of every kind, Shouts, laughs, and screams are revelling in the wind; The neigh of cavalry;—the tinkling throngs Of laden camels and their drivers songs “Some of the camels have bells about their necks, and some about their legs, like those which our carriers put about their fore-horses' necks, which together with the servants (who belong to the camels, and travel on foot,) singing all night, make a pleasant noise, and the journey passes away delightfully.” —Pitt's Account of the Mahometans. “The camel-driver follows the camels singing, and sometimes playing upon his pipe; the louder he sings and pipes, the faster the camels go. Nay, they will stand still when he gives over his music.” —Tavernier.;— Ringing of arms, and flapping in the breez Of streamers from ten thousand canopies;— War-music, bursting out from time to time, With gong and tymbalon's tremendous chime;— Or, in the pause, when harsher sounds are mute, The mellow breathings of some horn or flute, That far off, broken by the eagle note Of the' Abyssinian trumpet “This trumpet is often called, in Abyssinia, nesser cano, which signifies the Note of the Eagle.” —Note of Bruce's Editor., swell and float. Who leads this mighty army?—ask ye “who?” And mark ye not those banners of dark hue, The Night and Shadow The two black standards borne before the Caliphs of the House of Abbas were called, allegorically, The Night and The Shadow. —See Gibbon., over yonder tent?— It is the Caliph's glorious armament.

Nor less in number, though more new and rude In warfare's school, was the vast multitude That, fir'd by zeal, or by oppression wrong'd, Round the white standard of the' impostor throng'd.

But none, of all who own'd the Chief's command, Rush'd to that battle-field with bolder hand, Or sterner hate, than Iran's outlaw'd men, Her Worshippers of Fire The Ghebers or Guebres, those original natives of Persia, who adhered to their ancient faith, the religion of Zoroaster, and who, after the conquest of their country by the Arabs, were either persecuted at home, or forced to become wanderers abroad.—all panting then For vengeance on the' accursed Saracen; Vengeance at last for their dear country spurn'd, Her throne usurp'd, and her bright shrines o'erturn'd. From Yezd's “Yezd, the chief residence of those ancient natives, who worship the Sun and the Fire, which latter they have carefully kept lighted, without being once extinguished for a moment, about 3000 years, on a mountain near Yezd, called Ater Quedah, signifying the House or Mansion of the Fire. He is reckoned very unfortunate who dies off that mountain. —Stephen's Persia. eternal Mansion of the Fire, Where aged saints in dreams of Heav'n expire: From Badku, and those fountains of blue flame That burn into the Caspian “When the weather is hazy, the springs of Naphtha (on an island near Baku) boil up the higher, and the Naphtha often takes fire on the surface of the earth, and runs in a flame into the sea to a distance almost incredible.” —Hanway on the Everlasting Fire at Baku., fierce they came, Careless for what or whom the blow was sped, So vengeance triumph'd, and their tyrants bled. Such was the wild and miscellaneous host, That high in air their motley banners tost Around the Prophet-Chief—all eyes still bent Upon that glittering Veil, where'er it went, That beacon through the battle's stormy flood, That rainbow of the field, whose showers were blood! Twice hath the sun upon their conflict set, And risen again, and found them grappling yet; While streams of carnage in his noontide blaze, Smoke up to Heav'n—hot as that crimson haze, By which the prostrate Caravan is aw'd Savary says of the south wind, which blows in Egypt from February to May, “Sometimes it appears only in the shape of an impetuous whirlwind, which passes rapidly, and is fatal to the traveller, surprised in the middle of the deserts. Torrents of burning sand roll before it, the firmament is enveloped in a thick veil, and the sun appears of the colour of blood. Sometimes whole caravans are buried in it.”, In the red Desert, when the wind's abroad. “On, Swords of God!” the panting Caliph calls,— “Thrones for the living—Heav'n for him who falls!”— “On, brave avengers, on,” Mokanna cries, “And Eblis blast the recreant slave that flies!” Now comes the brunt, the crisis of the day— They clash—they strive—the Caliph's troops give way! Mokanna's self plucks the black Banner down, And now the Orient World's Imperial crown Is just within his grasp—when, hark, that shout! Some hand hath check'd the flying Moslem's rout; And now they turn, they rally—at their head A warrior, (like those angel youths who led, In glorious panoply of Heav'n's own mail, The Champions of the Faith through Beder's vale In the great victory gained by Mahomed at Beder, he was assisted, say the Mussulmans, by three thousand angels, led by Gabriel, mounted on his horse Hiazum. —See The Koran and its Commentators.,) Bold as if gifted with ten thousand lives, Turns on the fierce pursuers' blades, and drives At once the multitudinous torrent back— While hope and courage kindle in his track; And, at each step, his bloody falchion makes Terrible vistas through which victory breaks! In vain Mokanna, midst the general flight, Stands, like the red moon, on some stormy night, Among the fugitive clouds that, hurrying by, Leave only her unshaken in the sky— In vain he yells his desperate curses out, Deals death promiscuously to all about, To foes that charge and coward friends that fly, And seems of all the Great Arch-enemy. The panic spreads—“A miracle!” throughout The Moslem ranks, “a miracle!” they shout, All gazing on that youth, whose coming seems A light, a glory, such as breaks in dreams; And every sword, true as o'er billows dim The needle tracks the load-star, following him! Right tow'rds Mokanna now he cleaves his path, Impatient cleaves, as though the bolt of wrath He bears from Heav'n withheld its awful burst From weaker heads, and souls but half way curst, To break o'er Him, the mightiest and the worst! But vain his speed—though, in that hour of blood, Had all God's seraphs round Mokanna stood, With swords of fire, ready like fate to fall, Mokanna's soul would have defied them all, Yet now, the rush of fugitives, too strong For human force, hurries ev'n him along; In vain he struggles 'mid the wedg'd array Of flying thousands—he is borne away; And the sole joy his baffled spirit knows, In this forc'd flight, is—murdering as he goes! As a grim tiger, whom the torrent's might Surprizes in some parch'd ravine at night, Turns, ev'n in drowning, on the wretched flocks, Swept with him in that snow-flood from the rocks, And, to the last, devouring on his way, Bloodies the stream he hath not power to stay. “Alla illa Alla!”—the glad shout renew— “Alla Akbar!” The Tecbir, or cry of the Arabs. “Alla Acbar!” says Ockley, means, “God is most mighty.”—the Caliph's in Merou. Hang out your gilded tapestry in the streets, And light your shrines and chaunt your ziraleets. The ziraleet is a kind of chorus, which the women of the East sing upon joyful occasions. —Russel. The Swords of God have triumph'd—on his throne Your Caliph sits, and the veil'd Chief hath flown. Who does not envy that young warrior now, To whom the Lord of Islam bends his brow, In all the graceful gratitude of power, For his throne's safety in that perilous hour? Who doth not wonder, when, amid'st the' acclaim Of thousands, heralding to heaven his name— 'Mid all those holier harmonies of fame, Which sound along the path of virtuous souls, Like music round a planet as it rolls,— He turns away—coldly, as if some gloom Hung o'er his heart no triumphs can illume;— Some sightless grief, upon whose blasted gaze Though glory's light may play, in vain it plays. Yes, wretched Azim! thine is such a grief, Beyond all hope, all terror, all relief; A dark, cold calm, which nothing now can break, Or warm or brighten,—like that Syrian Lake The Dead Sea, which contains neither animal nor vegetable life., Upon whose surface morn and summer shed Their smiles in vain, for all beneath is dead!— Hearts there have been, o'er which this weight of woe Came by long use of suffering, tame and slow; But thine, lost youth! was sudden—over thee It broke at once, when all seem'd ecstasy; When Hope look'd up, and saw the gloomy Past Melt into splendour, and Bliss dawn at last— 'Twas then, ev'n then, o'er joys so freshly blown, This mortal blight of misery came down; Ev'n then, the full, warm gushings of thy heart Were check'd-like fount-drops, frozen as they start— And there, like them, cold, sunless relics hang, Each fix'd and chill'd into a lasting pang. One sole desire, one passion now remains To keep life's fever still within his veins, Vengeance!—dire vengeance on the wretch who cast O'er him and all he lov'd that ruinous blast. For this, when rumours reach'd him in his flight Far, far away, after that fatal night,— Rumours of armies thronging to the attack Of the Veil'd Chief,—for this he wing'd him back, Fleet as the vulture speeds to flags unfurl'd, And, when all hope seem'd desp'rate, wildly hurl'd Himself into the scale, and sav'd a world. For this he still lives on, careless of all The wreaths that Glory on his path lets fall; For this alone exists—like lightning-fire, To speed one bolt of vengeance, and expire! But safe as yet that Spirit of Evil lives; With a small band of desperate fugitives, The last sole stubborn fragment, left unriven, Of the proud host that late stood fronting Heaven, He gain'd Merou—breath'd a short curse of blood O'er his lost throne—then pass'd the Jihon's flood The ancient Oxus., And gathering all, whose madness of belief Still saw a Saviour in their down-fall'n Chief, Rais'd the white banner within Neksheb's gates A city of Transoxiana., And there, untam'd, the' approaching conqueror waits. Of all his Haram, all that busy hive, With music and with sweets sparkling alive, He took but one, the partner of his flight, One—not for love—not for her beauty's light— No, Zelica stood withering midst the gay, Wan as the blossom that fell yesterday From the' Alma tree and dies, while overhead To-day's young flower is springing in its stead. “You never can cast your eyes on this tree, but you meet there either blossoms or fruit; and as the blossom drops underneath on the ground (which is frequently covered with these purple-coloured flowers), others come forth in their stead,” &amp;c. &amp;c. —Nieuhoff. Oh, not for love—the deepest Damn'd must be Touch'd with Heaven's glory, ere such fiends as he Can feel one glimpse of Love's divinity. But no, she is his victim;—there lie all Her charms for him—charms that can never pall, As long as hell within his heart can stir, Or one faint trace of Heaven is left in her. To work an angel's ruin,—to behold As white a page as Virtue e'er unroll'd Blacken, beneath his touch, into a scroll Of damning sins, seal'd with a burning soul— This is his triumph; this the joy accurst, That ranks him among demons all but first: This gives the victim, that before him lies Blighted and lost, a glory in his eyes, A light like that with which hell-fire illumes The ghastly, writhing wretch whom it consumes! But other tasks now wait him—tasks that need All the deep daringness of thought and deed With which the Dives The Demons of the Persian mythology. have gifted him—for mark, Over yon plains, which night had else made dark, Those lanterns, countless as the winged lights That spangle India's fields on showery nights Carreri mentions the fire-flies in India during the rainy season. —See his Travels.,— Far as their formidable gleams they shed, The mighty tents of the beleaguerer spread, Glimmering along the' horizon's dusky line, And thence in nearer circles, till they shine Among the founts and groves, o'er which the town In all its arm'd magnificence looks down. Yet, fearless, from his lofty battlements Mokanna views that multitude of tents; Nay, smiles to think that, though entoil'd, beset, Not less than myriads dare to front him yet;— That friendless, throneless, he thus stands at bay, Ev'n thus a match for myriads such as they. “Oh, for a sweep of that dark Angel's wing, “Who brush'd the thousands of the' Assyrian King Sennacherib, called by the Orientals King of Moussal. —D'Herbelot. “To darkness in a moment, that I might “People Hell's chambers with yon host to-night! “But, come what may, let who will grasp the throne, “Caliph or Prophet, Man alike shall groan; “Let who will torture him, Priest—Caliph—King— “Alike this loathsome world of his shall ring “With victims' shrieks and howlings of the slave,— “Sounds, that shall glad me ev'n within my grave!” Thus, to himself—but to the scanty train Still left around him, a far different strain:— “Glorious Defenders of the sacred Crown “I bear from Heav'n, whose light nor blood shall drown “Nor shadow of earth eclipse;—before whose gems “The paly pomp of this world's diadems, “The crown of Gerashid, the pillar'd throne “Of Parviz Chosroes. For the description of his Throne or Palace, see Gibbon and D'Herbelot. There were said to be under this Throne or Palace of Khosrou Parviz a hundred vaults filled with “treasures so immense that some Mahometan writers tell us, their Prophet, to encourage his disciples, carried them to a rock, which at his command opened, and gave them a prospect through it of the treasures of Khosrou.” —Universal History., and the heron crest that shone “The crown of Gerashid is cloudy and tarnished before the heron tuft of thy turban.”—From one of the elegies or songs in praise of Ali, written in characters of gold round the gallery of Abbas's tomb. —See Chardin., “Magnificent, o'er Ali's beauteous eyes The beauty of Ali's eyes was so remarkable, that whenever the Persians would describe any thing as very lovely, they say it is Ayn Hali, or the Eyes of Ali. —Chardin., “Fade like the stars when morn is in the skies: “Warriors, rejoice—the port to which we've pass'd “O'er Destiny's dark wave, beams out at last! “Victory's our own—'tis written in that Book “Upon whose leaves none but the angels look, “That Islam's sceptre shall beneath the power “Of her great foe fall broken in that hour, “When the moon's mighty orb, before all eyes, “From Neksheb's Holy Well portentously shall rise! “Now turn and see!”— They turn'd, and, as he spoke, A sudden splendour all around them broke, And they beheld an orb, ample and bright, Rise from the Holy Well We are not told more of this trick of the Impostor, than that it was “une machine, qu'il disoit être la Lune.” According to Richardson, the miracle is perpetuated in Nekscheb. —“Nakshab, the name of a city in Transoxiania, where they say there is a well, in which the appearance of the moon is to be seen night and day.”, and cast its light Round the rich city and the plain for miles “Il amusa pendant deux mois le peuple de la ville de Nekhscheb, en faisant sortir toutes les nuits du fond d'un puits un corps lumineux semblable à Lune, qui portoit sa lumière jusqu'à la distance de plusieurs miles.” —D'Herbelot. Hence he was called Sazendéhmah, or the Moon-maker.,— Flinging such radiance o'er the gilded tiles Of many a dome and fair-roof'd imaret As autumn suns shed round them when they set. Instant from all who saw the' illusive sign A murmur broke— “Miraculous! divine!” The Gheber bow'd, thinking his idol star Had wak'd, and burst impatient through the bar Of midnight, to inflame him to the war; While he of Moussa's creed saw, in that ray, The glorious Light which, in his freedom's day, Had rested on the Ark The Shechinah, called Sakînat in the Koran. —See Sale's Note, chap. ii., and now again Shone out to bless the breaking of his chain. “To victory!” is at once the cry of all— Nor stands Mokanna loitering at that call; But instant the huge gates are flung aside, And forth, like a diminutive mountain-tide Into the boundless sea, they speed their course Right on into the Moslem's mighty force. The watchmen of the camp,—who, in their rounds, Had paus'd, and ev'n forgot the punctual sounds Of the small drum with which they count the night The parts of the night are made known as well by instruments of music, as by the rounds of the watchmen with cries and small drums. —See Burder's Oriental Customs, vol. i. p. 119., To gaze upon that supernatural light,— Now sink beneath an unexpected arm, And in a death-groan give their last alarm. “On for the lamps, that light yon lofty screen The Serrapurda, high screens of red cloth, stiffened with cane, used to enclose a considerable space round the royal tents. —Notes on the Bahardanush. The tents of Princes were generally illuminated. Norden tells us that the tent of the Bey of Girge was distinguished from the other tents by forty lanterns being suspended before it. —See Harmer's Observations on Job., “Nor blunt your blades with massacre so mean; “There rests the Caliph—speed—one lucky lance “May now achieve mankind's deliverance.” Desperate the die—such as they only cast, Who venture for a world, and stake their last. But Fate's no longer with him—blade for blade Springs up to meet them thro' the glimmering shade, And, as the clash is heard, new legions soon Pour to the spot, like bees of Kauzeroon “From the groves of orange trees at Kauzeroon the bees cull a celebrated honey.” —Morier's Travels. To the shrill timbrel's summons,—till, at length, The mighty camp swarms out in all its strength, And back to Neksheb's gates, covering the plain With random slaughter, drives the' adventurous train; Among the last of whom the Silver Veil Is seen glittering at times, like the white sail Of some toss'd vessel, on a stormy night, Catching the tempest's momentary light! And hath not this brought the proud spirit low? Nor dash'd his brow, nor check'd his daring? No. Though half the wretches, whom at night he led To thrones and victory, lie disgrac'd and dead, Yet morning hears him with unshrinking crest, Still vaunt of thrones, and victory to the rest;— And they believe him!—oh, the lover may Distrust that look which steals his soul away;— The babe may cease to think that it can play With Heaven's rainbow;—alchymists may doubt The shining gold their crucible gives out; But Faith, fanatic Faith, once wedded fast To some dear falsehood, hugs it to the last. And well the' Impostor knew all lures and arts, That Lucifer e'er taught to tangle hearts; Nor, mid these last bold workings of his plot Against men's souls, is Zelica forgot. Ill-fated Zelica! had reason been Awake, through half the horrors thou hast seen, Thou never could'st have borne it—Death had come At once, and taken thy wrung spirit home. But 'twas not so—a torpor, a suspense Of thought, almost of life, came o'er the intense And passionate struggles of that fearful night, When her last hope of peace and heav'n took flight: And though, at times, a gleam of frenzy broke,— As through some dull volcano's veil of smoke Ominous flashings now and then will start, Which show the fire's still busy at its heart; Yet was she mostly wrapp'd in solemn gloom,— Not such as Azim's, brooding o'er its doom, And calm without, as is the brow of death, While busy worms are gnawing underneath— But in a blank and pulseless torpor, free From thought or pain, a seal'd-up apathy, Which left her oft, with scarce one living thrill, The cold, pale victim of her torturer's will. Again, as in Merou, he had her deck'd Gorgeously out, the Priestess of the sect; And led her glittering forth before the eyes Of his rude train, as to a sacrifice,— Pallid as she, the young, devoted Bride Of the fierce Nile, when, deck'd in all the pride Of nuptial pomp, she sinks into his tide. “A custom still subsisting at this day, seems to me to prove that the Egyptians formerly sacrificed a young virgin to the God of the Nile; for they now make a statue of earth in shape of a girl, to which they give the name of the Betrothed Bride, and throw it into the river.” —Savary. And while the wretched maid hung down her head, And stood, as one just risen from the dead, Amid that gazing crowd, the fiend would tell His credulous slaves it was some charm or spell Possess'd her now,—and from that darken'd trance Should dawn ere long their Faith's deliverance. Or if, at times, goaded by guilty shame, Her soul was rous'd, and words of wildness came, Instant the bold blasphemer would translate Her ravings into oracles of fate, Would hail Heav'n's signals in her flashing eyes, And call her shrieks the language of the skies! But vain at length his arts—despair is seen Gathering around; and famine comes to glean All that the sword had left unreap'd:—in vain At morn and eve across the northern plain He looks impatient for the promis'd spears Of the wild Hordes and Tartar mountaineers; They come not—while his fierce beleaguerers pour Engines of havoc in, unknown before, That they knew the secret of the Greek fire among the Mussulmans early in the eleventh century, appears from Dow's Account of Mamood I. “When he arrived at Moultan, finding that the country of the Jits was defended by great rivers, he ordered fifteen hundred boats to be built, each of which he armed with six iron spikes, projecting from their prows and sides, to prevent their being boarded by the enemy, who were very expert in that kind of war. When he had launched this fleet, he ordered twenty archers into each boat, and five others with fire-balls, to burn the craft of the Jits, and naphtha to set the whole river on fire.” The agnee aster, too, in Indian poems the Instrument of Fire, whose flame cannot be extinguished, is supposed to signify the Greek Fire.—See Wilks's South of India, vol. i. p. 471.—And in the curious Javan poem, the Brata Yudha given by Sir Stamford Raffles in his History of Java, we find, “He aimed at the heart of Soéta with the sharp-pointed Weapon of Fire.” The mention of gunpowder as in use among the Arabians, long before its supposed discovery in Europe, is introduced by Ebn Fadhl, the Egyptian geographer, who lived in the thirteenth century. “Bodies,” he says, “in the form of scorpions, bound round and filled with nitrous powder, glide along, making a gentle noise; then, exploding, they lighten, as it were, and burn. But there are others which, cast into the air, stretch along like a cloud, roaring horribly, as thunder roars, and on all sides vomiting out flames, burst, burn, and reduce to cinders whatever comes in their way.” The historian Ben Abdalla, in speaking of the sieges of Abulualid in the year of the Hegira 712, says, “A fiery globe, by means of combustible matter, with a mighty noise suddenly emitted, strikes with the force of lightning, and shakes the citadel.” —See the extracts from Casiri's Biblioth. Arab. Hispan. in the Appendix to Berington's Literary History of the Middle Ages. And horrible as new The Greek fire, which was occasionally lent by the emperors to their allies. “It was,” says Gibbon, “either launched in red-hot balls of stone and iron, or darted in arrows and javelins, twisted round with flax and tow, which had deeply imbibed the inflammable oil.”;—javelins, that fly Enwreath'd with smoky flames through the dark sky, And red-hot globes, that, opening as they mount, Discharge, as from a kindled Naphtha fount See Hanway's Account of the Springs of Naphtha at Baku (which is called by Lieutenant Pottinger Joala Mookee, or, the Flaming Mouth,) taking fire and running into the sea. Dr. Cooke, in his Journal, mentions some wells in Circassia, strongly impregnated with this inflammable oil, from which issues boiling water. “Though the weather,” he adds, “was now very cold, the warmth of these wells of hot water produced near them the verdure and flowers of spring.” Major Scott Waring says, that naphtha is used by the Persians, as we are told it was in hell, for lamps. ? many a row Of starry lamps and blazing cressets, fed With naphtha and asphaltus, yielding light As from a sky., Showers of consuming fire o'er all below; Looking, as through the' illumin'd night they go, Like those wild birds “At the great festival of fire, called the Sheb Sezê, they used to set fire to large bunches of dry combustibles, fastened round wild beasts and birds, which being then let loose, the air and earth appeared one great illumination; and as these terrified creatures naturally fled to the woods for shelter, it is easy to conceive the conflagrations they produced.” —Richardson's Dissertation. that by the Magians oft, At festivals of fire, were sent aloft Into the air, with blazing faggots tied To their huge wings, scattering combustion wide. All night the groans of wretches who expire, In agony, beneath these darts of fire, Ring through the city—while, descending o'er Its shrines and domes and streets of sycamore,— Its lone bazars, with their bright cloths of gold, Since the last peaceful pageant left unroll'd,— Its beauteous marble baths, whose idle jets Now gush with blood,—and its tall minarets, That late have stood up in the evening glare Of the red sun, unhallow'd by a prayer;— O'er each, in turn, the dreadful flame-bolts fall, And death and conflagration throughout all The desolate city hold high festival! Mokanna sees the world is his no more;— One sting at parting, and his grasp is o'er. “What! drooping now?”—thus, with unblushing cheek, He hails the few, who yet can hear him speak, Of all those famish'd slaves around him lying, And by the light of blazing temples dying;— “What!—drooping now?—now, when at length we press “Home o'er the very threshold of success; “When Alla from our ranks hath thinn'd away “Those grosser branches, that kept out his ray “Of favour from us, and we stand at length “Heirs of his light and children of his strength, “The chosen few, who shall survive the fall “Of Kings and Thrones, triumphant over all! “Have you then lost, weak murmurers as you are, “All faith in him, who was your Light, your Star? “Have you forgot the eye of glory, hid “Beneath this Veil, the flashing of whose lid “Could, like a sun-stroke of the desert, wither “Millions of such as yonder Chief brings hither? “Long have its lightnings slept—too long—but now “All earth shall feel the' unveiling of this brow! “To-night—yes, sainted men! this very night, “I bid you all to a fair festal rite, “Where—having deep refresh'd each weary limb “With viands, such as feast Heav'n's cherubim, “And kindled up your souls, now sunk and dim, “With that pure wine the Dark-ey'd Maids above “Keep, seal'd with precious musk, for those they love “The righteous shall be given to drink of pure wine, sealed; the seal whereof shall be musk.” —Koran, chap. lxxxiii.,— “I will myself uncurtain in your sight “The wonders of this brow's ineffable light; “Then lead you forth, and with a wink disperse “Yon myriads, howling through the universe!” Eager they listen—while each accent darts New life into their chill'd and hope-sick hearts; Such treacherous life as the cool draught supplies To him upon the stake, who drinks and dies! Wildly they point their lances to the light Of the fast sinking sun, and shout “To-night!”— “To-night,” their Chief re-echoes in a voice Of fiend-like mockery that bids hell rejoice. Deluded victims!—never hath this earth Seen mourning half so mournful as their mirth. Here, to the few, whose iron frames had stood This racking waste of famine and of blood, Faint, dying wretches clung, from whom the shout Of triumph like a maniac's laugh broke out:— There, others, lighted by the smouldering fire, Danc'd, like wan ghosts about a funeral pyre, Among the dead and dying, strew'd around;— While some pale wretch look'd on, and from his wound Plucking the fiery dart by which he bled, In ghastly transport wav'd it o'er his head! 'Twas more than mignight now—a fearful pause Had follow'd the long shouts, the wild applause, That lately from those Royal Gardens burst, Where the Veil'd demon held his feast accurst, When Zelica—alas, poor ruin'd heart, In every horror doom'd to bear its part!— Was bidden to the banquet by a slave, Who, while his quivering lip the summons gave, Grew black, as though the shadows of the grave Compass'd him round, and, ere he could repeat His message through, fell lifeless at her feet! Shuddering she went—a soul-felt pang of fear, A presage that her own dark doom was near, Rous'd every feeling, and brought Reason back Once more, to writhe her last upon the rack. All round seem'd tranquil—even the foe had ceas'd, As if aware of that demoniac feast, His fiery bolts; and though the heavens look'd red, 'Twas but some distant conflagration's spread. But hark—she stops—she listens—dreadful tone! 'Tis her Tormentor's laugh—and now, a groan, A long death-groan comes with it:—can this be The place of mirth, the bower of revelry? She enters—Holy Alla, what a sight Was there before her! By the glimmering light Of the pale dawn, mix'd with the flare of brands That round lay burning, dropp'd from lifeless hands, She saw the board, in splendid mockery spread, Rich censers breathing—garlands overhead— The urns, the cups, from which they late had quaff'd All gold and gems, but—what had been the draught? Oh! who need ask, that saw those livid guests, With their swoll'n heads sunk blackening on their breasts, Or looking pale to Heav'n with glassy glare, As if they sought but saw no mercy there; As if they felt, though poison rack'd them through, Remorse the deadlier torment of the two! While some, the bravest, hardiest in the train Of their false Chief, who on the battle-plain Would have met death with transport by his side, Here mute and helpless gasp'd;—but, as they died, Look'd horrible vengeance with their eyes' last strain, And clench'd the slackening hand at him in vain. Dreadful it was to see the ghastly stare, The stony look of horror and despair, Which some of these expiring victims cast Upon their souls' tormentor to the last;— Upon that mocking Fiend, whose Veil, now rais'd, Show'd them, as in death's agony they gaz'd, Not the long promis'd light, the brow, whose beaming Was to come forth, all conquering, all redeeming, But features horribler than Hell e'er trac'd On its own brood;—no Demon of the Waste “The Afghauns believe each of the numerous solitudes and deserts of their country to be inhabited by a lonely demon, whom they call the Ghoolee Beeabau, or Spirit of the Waste. They often illustrate the wildness of any sequestered tribe, by saying, they are wild as the Demon of the Waste.” —Elphinstone's Caubul., No church-yard Ghole, caught lingering in the light Of the blest sun, e'er blasted human sight With lineaments so foul, so fierce as those The' Impostor now, in grinning mockery, shows:— “There, ye wise Saints, behold your Light, your Star— “Ye would be dupes and victims, and ye are. “Is it enough? or must I, while a thrill “Lives in your sapient bosoms, cheat you still? “Swear that the burning death ye feel within “Is but the trance with which Heav'n's joys begin; “That this foul visage, foul as e'er disgrac'd “Ev'n monstrous man, is—after God's own taste; “And that—but see!—ere I have half-way said “My greetings through, the' uncourteous souls are fled. “Farewell, sweet spirits! not in vain ye die, “If Eblis loves you half so well as I.— “Ha, my young bride!—'tis well—take thou thy seat; “Nay come—no shuddering—didst thou never meet “The Dead before?—they grac'd our wedding, sweet; “And these, my guests to-night, have brimm'd so true “Their parting cups, that thou shalt pledge one too. “But—how is this?—all empty? all drunk up? “Hot lips have been before thee in the cup, “Young bride—yet stay—one precious drop remains, “Enough to warm a gentle Priestess' veins;— “Here, drink—and should thy lover's conquering arms “Speed hither, ere thy lip lose all its charms, “Give him but half this venom in thy kiss, “And I'll forgive my haughty rival's bliss! “For, me—I too must die—but not like these “Vile, rankling things, to fester in the breeze; “To have this brow in ruffian triumph shown, “With all death's grimness added to its own, “And rot to dust beneath the taunting eyes “Of slaves, exclaiming, ‘There his Godship lies!’ “No—cursed race—since first my soul drew breath, “They've been my dupes, and shall be ev'n in death. “Thou see'st yon cistern in the shade—'tis fill'd “With burning drugs, for this last hour distill'd “Il donna du poison dans le vin à tous ses gens, et se jetta lui-même ensuite dans une cuve pleine de drogues brûlantes et consumantes, afin qu'il ne restât rien de tous les membres de son corps, et que ceux qui restoient de sa secte puissent croire qu'il étoit monté au ciel, ce qui ne manqua pas d'arriver.” —D' Herbelot. “There will I plunge me, in that liquid flame— “Fit bath to lave a dying Prophet's frame!— “There perish, all—ere pulse of thine shall fail— “Nor leave one limb to tell mankind the tale. “So shall my votaries, wheresoe'er they rave, “Proclaim that Heav'n took back the Saint it gave;— “That I've but vanish'd from this earth awhile, “To come again, with bright, unshrouded smile! “So shall they build me altars in their zeal, “Where knaves shall minister, and fools shall kneel; “Where Faith may mutter o'er her mystic spell, “Written in blood—and Bigotry may swell “The sail he spreads for Heav'n with blasts from hell! “So shall my banner, through long ages, be “The rallying sign of fraud and anarchy;— “Kings yet unborn shall rue Mokanna's name, “And, though I die, my spirit, still the same, “Shall walk abroad in all the stormy strife, “And guilt, and blood, that were its bliss in life. “But, hark! their battering engine shakes the wall— “Why, let it shake—thus I can brave them all. “No trace of me shall greet them, when they come, “And I can trust thy faith, for—thou'lt be dumb. “Now mark how readily a wretch like me, “In one bold plunge, commences Deity!” He sprung and sunk, as the last words were said— Quick clos'd the burning waters o'er his head, And Zelica was left—within the ring Of those wide walls the only living thing; The only wretched one, still curs'd with breath, In all that frightful wilderness of death! More like some bloodless ghost—such as, they tell, In the Lone Cities of the Silent “They have all a great reverence for burial-grounds, which they sometimes call by the poetical name of Cities of the Silent, and which they people with the ghosts of the departed, who sit each at the head of his own grave, invisible to mortal eyes.” —Elphinstone. dwell, And there, unseen of all but Alla, sit Each by its own pale carcass, watching it. But morn is up, and a fresh warfare stirs Throughout the camp of the beleaguerers. Their globes of fire (the dread artillery lent By Greece to conquering Mahadi) are spent; And now the scorpion's shaft, the quarry sent From high balistas, and the shielded throng Of soldiers swinging the huge ram along, All speak the' impatient Islamite's intent To try, at length, if tower and battlement And bastion'd wall be not less hard to win, Less tough to break down than the hearts within. First in impatience and in toil is he, The burning Azim—oh! could he but see The' Impostor once alive within his grasp, Not the gaunt lion's hug, nor boa's clasp, Could match that gripe of vengeance, or keep pace With the fell heartiness of Hate's embrace! Loud rings the ponderous ram against the walls; Now shake the ramparts, now a buttress falls, But still no breach—“Once more, one mighty swing “Of all your beams, together thundering!” There—the wall shakes—the shouting troops exult, “Quick, quick discharge your weightiest catapult “Right on that spot, and Neksheb is our own!” 'Tis done—the battlements come crashing down, And the huge wall, by that stroke riv'n in two, Yawning, like some old crater, rent anew, Shows the dim, desolate city smoking through. But strange! no signs of life—nought living seen Above, below—what can this stillness mean? A minute's pause suspends all hearts and eyes— “In through the breach,” impetuous Azim cries; But the cool Caliph, fearful of some wile In this blank stillness, checks the troops awhile.— Just then, a figure, with slow step, advanc'd Forth from the ruin'd walls, and, as there glanc'd A sunbeam over it, all eyes could see The well-known Silver Veil!—“'Tis He, 'tis He, “Mokanna, and alone!” they shout around; Young Azim from his steed springs to the ground— “Mine, Holy Caliph! mine,” he cries, “the task “To crush yon daring wretch—'tis all I ask.” Eager he darts to meet the demon foe, Who still across wide heaps of ruin slow And falteringly comes, till they are near; Then, with a bound, rushes on Azim's spear, And, casting off the Veil in falling, shows— Oh!—'tis his Zelica's life-blood that flows! “I meant not, Azim,” soothingly she said, As on his trembling arm she lean'd her head, And, looking in his face, saw anguish there Beyond all wounds the quivering flesh can bear— “I meant not thou shouldst have the pain of this:— “Though death, with thee thus tasted, is a bliss “Thou wouldst not rob me of, didst thou but know, “How oft I've pray'd to God I might die so! “But the Fiend's venom was too scant and slow;— “To linger on were maddening—and I thought “If once that Veil—nay, look not on it—caught “The eyes of your fierce soldiery, I should be “Struck by a thousand death-darts instantly. “But this is sweeter—oh! believe me, yes— “I would not change this sad, but dear caress, “This death within thy arms I would not give “For the most smiling life the happiest live! “All, that stood dark and drear before the eye “Of my stray'd soul, is passing swiftly by; “A light comes o'er me from those looks of love, “Like the first dawn of mercy from above; “And if thy lips but tell me I'm forgiven, “Angels will echo the blest words in Heaven! “But live, my Azim;—oh! to call thee mine “Thus once again! my Azim—dream divine! “Live, if thou ever lov'dst me, if to meet “Thy Zelica hereafter would be sweet, “Oh, live to pray for her—to bend the knee “Morning and night before that Deity, “To whom pure lips and hearts without a stain, “As thine are, Azim, never breath'd in vain,— “And pray that He may pardon her,—may take “Compassion on her soul for thy dear sake, “And, nought remembering but her love to thee, “Make her all thine, all His, eternally! “Go to those happy fields where first we twin'd “Our youthful hearts together—every wind “That meets thee there, fresh from the well-known flowers, “Will bring the sweetness of those innocent hours “Back to thy soul, and thou may'st feel again “For thy poor Zelica as thou didst then. “So shall thy orisons, like dew that flies “To Heav'n upon the morning's sunshine, rise “With all love's earliest ardour to the skies! “And should they—but, alas, my senses fail— “Oh for one minute!—should thy prayers prevail— “If pardon'd souls may, from that World of Bliss, “Reveal their joy to those they love in this— “I'll come to thee—in some sweet dream—and tell— “Oh Heav'n—I die—dear love! farewell, farewell.” Time fleeted—years on years had pass'd away, And few of those who, on that mournful day, Had stood, with pity in their eyes, to see The maiden's death, and the youth's agony, Were living still—when, by a rustic grave, Beside the swift Amoo's transparent wave, An aged man, who had grown aged there By that lone grave, morning and night in prayer, For the last time knelt down—and, though the shade Of death hung darkening over him, there play'd A gleam of rapture on his eye and cheek, That brighten'd even Death—like the last streak Of intense glory on the horizon's brim, When night o'er all the rest hangs chill and dim. His soul had seen a Vision, while he slept; She, for whose spirit he had pray'd and wept So many years, had come to him, all drest In angel smiles, and told him she was blest! For this the old man breath'd his thanks, and died.— And there, upon the banks of that lov'd tide, He and his Zelica sleep side by side. PARADISE AND THE PERI. One morn a Peri at the gate Of Eden stood, disconsolate; And as she listen'd to the Springs Of Life within, like music flowing, And caught the light upon her wings Through the half-open portal glowing, She wept to think her recreant race Should e'er have lost that glorious place! “How happy,” exclaim'd this child of air, “Are the holy Spirits who wander there, “Mid flowers that never shall fade or fall; “Though mine are the gardens of earth and sea, “And the stars themselves have flowers for me, “One blossom of Heaven out-blooms them all! “Though sunny the Lake of cool Cashmere, “With its plane-tree Isle reflected clear “Numerous small islands emerge from the Lake of Cashmere. One is called Char Chenaur, from the plane trees upon it.” —Foster., “And sweetly the founts of that Valley fall; “Though bright are the waters of Sing-su-hay, “And the golden floods that thitherward stray “The Altan Kol or Golden River of Tibet, which runs into the Lakes of Sing-su-hay, has abundance of gold in its sands, which employs the inhabitants all the summer in gathering it.” —Description of Tibet in Pinkerton., “Yet—oh, 'tis only the Blest can say “How the waters of Heaven outshine them all! “Go, wing thy flight from star to star, “From world to luminous world, as far “As the universe spreads its flaming wall: “Take all the pleasures of all the spheres, “And multiply each through endless years, “One minute of Heaven is worth them all!” The glorious Angel, who was keeping The gates of Light, beheld her weeping; And, as he nearer drew and listen'd To her sad song, a tear-drop glisten'd Within his eyelids, like the spray From Eden's fountain, when it lies On the blue flow'r, which—Bramins say— Blooms nowhere but in Paradise. “The Brahmins of this province insist that the blue campac flowers only in Paradise.” —Sir W. Jones. It appears, however, from a curious letter of the Sultan of Menangcabow, given by Marsden, that one place on earth may lay claim to the possession of it. “This is the Sultan, who keeps the flower champaka that is blue, and to be found in no other country but his, being yellow elsewhere.” —Marsden's Sumatra. “Nymph of a fair but erring line!” Gently he said—“One hope is thine. “'Tis written in the Book of Fate, “The Peri yet may be forgiven Who brings to this Eternal gate “The Gift that is most dear to Heaven! “Go, seek it, and redeem thy sin— “'Tis sweet to let the Pardon'd in.” Rapidly as comets run To the' embraces of the Sun;— Fleeter than the starry brands Flung at night from angel hands “The Mahometans suppose that falling stars are the firebrands wherewith the good angels drive away the bad, when they approach too near the empyrean or verge of the heavens.” —Fryer. At those dark and daring sprites Who would climb the' empyreal heights, Down the blue vault the Peri flies, And, lighted earthward by a glance That just then broke from morning's eyes, Hung hovering o'er our world's expanse. But whither shall the Spirit go To find this gift for Heav'n?—“I know “The wealth,” she cries, “of every urn, “In which unnumber'd rubies burn, “Beneath the pillars of Chilminar The Forty Pillars; so the Persians call the ruins of Persepolis. It is imagined by them that this palace and the edifices at Balbec were built by Genii, for the purpose of hiding in their subterraneous caverns immense treasures, which still remain there. —D'Herbelot, Volney.; “I know where the Isles of Perfume are Diodorus mentions the Isle of Panchaia, to the south o Arabia Felix, where there was a temple of Jupiter. This island, or rather cluster of isles, has disappeared, “sunk (says Grandpré) in the abyss made by the fire beneath their foundations.” —Voyage to the Indian Ocean. “Many a fathom down in the sea, “To the south of sun-bright Araby The Isles of Panchaia.; “I know, too, where the Genii hid “The jewell'd cup of their King Jamshid “The cup of Jamshid, discovered, they say, when digging for the foundations of Persepolis.” —Richardson., “With Life's elixir sparkling high— “But gifts like these are not for the sky. “Where was there ever a gem that shone “Like the steps of Alla's wonderful Throne? “And the Drops of Life—oh! what would they be “In the boundless Deep of Eternity?” While thus she mus'd, her pinions fann'd The air of that sweet Indian land, Whose air is balm; whose ocean spreads O'er coral rocks, and amber beds “It is not like the Sea of India, whose bottom is rich with pearls and ambergris, whose mountains of the coast are stored with gold and precious stones, whose gulfs breed creatures that yield ivory, and among the plants of whose shores are ebony, red wood, and the wood of Hairzan, aloes, camphor, cloves, sandal-wood, and all other spices and aromatics; where parrots and peacocks are birds of the forest, and musk and civet are collected upon the lands.” —Travels of two Mohammedans.; Whose mountains, pregnant by the beam Of the warm sun, with diamonds teem; Whose rivulets are like rich brides, Lovely, with gold beneath their tides; Whose sandal groves and bowers of spice Might be a Peri's Paradise! But crimson now her rivers ran With human blood—the smell of death Came reeking from those spicy bowers, And man, the sacrifice of man, Mingled his taint with every breath Upwafted from the innocent flowers. Land of the Sun! what foot invades Thy Pagods and thy pillar'd shades ? in the ground The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow About the mother-tree, a pillar'd shade, High over-arch'd, and echoing walks between. Milton. For a particular description and plate of the Banyan-tree, see Cordiner's Ceylon.— Thy cavern shrines, and Idol stones, Thy Monarchs and their thousand Thrones? “With this immense treasure Mamood returned to Ghizni, and in the year 400 prepared a magnificent festival, where he displayed to the people his wealth in golden thrones and in other ornaments, in a great plain without the city of Ghizni.” —Ferishta. 'Tis He of Gazna “Mahmood of Gazna, or Ghizni, who conquered India in the beginning of the 11th century.” —See his History in Dow and Sir J. Malcolm.—fierce in wrath He comes, and India's diadems Lie scatter'd in his ruinous path.— His bloodhounds he adorns with gems, Torn from the violated necks Of many a young and lov'd Sultana “It is reported that the hunting equipage of the Sultan Mahmood was so magnificent, that he kept 400 greyhounds and bloodhounds, each of which wore a collar set with jewels, and a covering edged with gold and pearls.” —Universal History, vol. iii.; Maidens, within their pure Zenana, Priests in the very fane he slaughters, And choaks up with the glittering wrecks Of golden shrines the sacred waters! Downward the Peri turns her gaze, And, through the war-field's bloody haze Beholds a youthful warrior stand, Alone beside his native river,— The red blade broken in his hand, And the last arrow in his quiver. “Live,” said the Conqueror, “live to share “The trophies and the crowns I bear!” Silent that youthful warrior stood— Silent he pointed to the flood All crimson with his country's blood, Then sent his last remaining dart, For answer, to the' Invader's heart. False flew the shaft, though pointed well; The Tyrant liv'd, the Hero fell!— Yet mark'd the Peri where he lay, And, when the rush of war was past, Swiftly descending on a ray Of morning light, she caught the last— Last glorious drop his heart had shed, Before its free-born spirit fled! “Be this,” she cried, as she wing'd her flight, “My welcome gift at the Gates of Light. “Though foul are the drops that oft distil “On the field of warfare, blood like this, “For Liberty shed, so holy is Objections may be made to my use of the word Liberty in this, and more especially in the story that follows it, as totally inapplicable to any state of things that has ever existed in the East; but though I cannot, of course, mean to employ it in that enlarged and noble sense which is so well understood at the present day, and, I grieve to say, so little acted upon, yet it is no disparagement to the word to apply it to that national independence, that freedom from the interference and dictation of foreigners, without which, indeed, no liberty of any kind can exist; and for which both Hindoos and Persians fought against their Mussulman invaders with, in many cases, a bravery that deserved much better success., “It would not stain the purest rill, “That sparkles among the Bowers of Bliss! “Oh, if there be, on this earthly sphere, “A boon, an offering Heaven holds dear, “'Tis the last libation Liberty draws “From the heart that bleeds and breaks in her cause!” “Sweet,” said the Angel, as she gave The gift into his radiant hand, “Sweet is our welcome of the Brave “Who die thus for their native Land.— “But see—alas!—the crystal bar “Of Eden moves not—holier far “Than ev'n this drop the boon must be, “That opes the Gates of Heav'n for thee!” Her first fond hope of Eden blighted, Now among Afric's lunar Mountains “The Mountains of the Moon, or the Montes Lunæ of antiquity, at the foot of which the Nile is supposed to arise.” —Bruce. “Sometimes called,” says Jackson, “Jibbel Kumrie, or the white or lunar coloured mountains; so a white horse is called by the Arabians a moon-coloured horse.”, Far to the South, the Peri lighted; And sleek'd her plumage at the fountains Of that Egyptian tide—whose birth Is hidden from the sons of earth Deep in those solitary woods, Where oft the Genii of the Floods Dance round the cradle of their Nile, And hail the new-born Giant's smile. “The Nile, which the Abyssinians know by the names of Abey and Alawy, or the Giant.” —Asiat.

Savary mentions the pelicans upon Lake Mœris. 'Twas a fair scene—a Land more bright Never did mortal eye behold! Who could have thought, that saw this night Those valleys and their fruits of gold Basking in Heav'n's serenest light;— Those groups of lovely date-trees bending Languidly their leaf-crown'd heads, Like youthful maids, when sleep descending Warns them to their silken beds “The superb date-tree, whose head languidly reclines, like that of a handsome woman overcome with sleep.”—Dafard el Hadad.;— Those virgin lilies, all the night Bathing their beauties in the lake, That they may rise more fresh and bright, When their beloved Sun's awake;— Those ruin'd shrines and towers that seem The relics of a splendid dream; Amid whose fairy loneliness Nought but the lapwing's cry is heard, Nought seen but (when the shadows, flitting Fast from the moon, unsheath its gleam,) Some purple-wing'd Sultana “That beautiful bird, with plumage of the finest shining blue, with purple beak and legs, the natural and living ornament of the temples and palaces of the Greeks and Romans, which, from the stateliness of its port, as well as the brilliancy of its colours, has obtained the title of Sultana.” —Sonnini. sitting Upon a column, motionless And glittering like an Idol bird!— Who could have thought, that there, ev'n there, Amid those scenes so still and fair, The Demon of the Plague hath cast From his hot wing a deadlier blast, More mortal far than ever came From the red Desert's sands of flame! So quick, that every living thing Of human shape, touch'd by his wing, Like plants, where the Simoom hath past, At once falls black and withering! The sun went down on many a brow, Which, full of bloom and freshness then, Is rankling in the pest-house now, And ne'er will feel that sun again. And, oh! to see the' unburied heaps On which the lonely moonlight sleeps— The very vultures turn away, And sicken at so foul a prey! Only the fierce hyæna stalks Jackson, speaking of the plague that occurred in West Barbary, when he was there, says, “The birds of the air fled away from the abodes of men. The hyænas, on the contrary, visited the cemeteries,” &amp;c. Throughout the city's desolate walks “Gondar was full of hyænas from the time it turned dark, till the dawn of day, seeking the different pieces of slaughtered carcasses, which this cruel and unclean people expose in the streets without burial, and who firmly believe that these animals are Falashta from the neighbouring mountains, transformed by magic, and come down to eat human flesh in the dark in safety.” —Bruce. At midnight, and his carnage plies:— Woe to the half-dead wretch, who meets The glaring of those large blue eyes Bruce. Amid the darkness of the streets! “Poor race of men!” said the pitying Spirit, “Dearly ye pay for your primal Fall— “Some flow'rets of Eden ye still inherit, “But the trail of the Serpent is over them all!” She wept—the air grew pure and clear Around her, as the bright drops ran; For there's a magic in each tear, Such kindly Spirits weep for man! Just then beneath some orange trees, Whose fruit and blossoms in the breeze Were wantoning together, free, Like age at play with infancy— Beneath that fresh and springing bower, Close by the Lake, she heard the moan Of one who, at this silent hour, Had thither stol'n to die alone. One who in life where'er he mov'd, Drew after him the hearts of many; Yet now, as though he ne'er were lov'd, Dies here unseen, unwept by any! None to watch near him—none to slake The fire that in his bosom lies, With ev'n a sprinkle from that lake, Which shines so cool before his eyes. No voice, well known through many a day, To speak the last, the parting word, Which, when all other sounds decay, Is still like distant music heard;— That tender farewell on the shore Of this rude world, when all is o'er, Which cheers the spirit, ere its bark Puts off into the unknown Dark. Deserted youth! one thought alone Shed joy around his soul in death— That she, whom he for years had known, And lov'd, and might have call'd his own Was safe from this foul midnight's breath,— Safe in her father's princely halls, Where the cool airs from fountain falls, Freshly perfum'd by many a brand Of the sweet wood from India's land, Were pure as she whose brow they fann'd. But see—who yonder comes by stealth This circumstance has been often introduced into poetry; —by Vincentius Fabricius, by Darwin, and lately, with very powerful effect, by Mr. Wilson., This melancholy bower to seek, Like a young envoy, sent by Health, With rosy gifts upon her cheek? 'Tis she—far off, through moonlight dim He knew his own betrothed bride, She, who would rather die with him, Than live to gain the world beside!— Her arms are round her lover now, His livid cheek to hers she presses, And dips, to bind his burning brow, In the cool lake her loosen'd tresses. Ah! once, how little did he think An hour would come, when he should shrink With horror from that dear embrace, Those gentle arms, that were to him Holy as is the cradling place Of Eden's infant cherubim! And now he yields—now turns away, Shuddering as if the venom lay All in those proffer'd lips alone— Those lips that, then so fearless grown, Never until that instant came Near his unask'd or without shame. “Oh! let me only breathe the air, “The blessed air, that's breath'd by thee, “And, whether on its wings it bear “Healing or death, 'tis sweet to me! “There—drink my tears, while yet they fall— “Would that my bosom's blood were balm, “And, well thou know'st, I'd shed it all, “To give thy brow one minute's calm. “Nay, turn not from me that dear face— “Am I not thine—thy own lov'd bride— “The one, the chosen one, whose place “In life or death is by thy side? “Think'st thou that she, whose only light, “In this dim world, from thee hath shone, “Could bear the long, the cheerless night, “That must be hers when thou art gone? “That I can live, and let thee go, “Who art my life itself?—No, no— “When the stem dies, the leaf that grew “Out of its heart must perish too! “Then turn to me, my own love, turn, “Before, like thee, I fade and burn; “Cling to these yet cool lips, and share “The last pure life that lingers there!” She fails—she sinks—as dies the lamp In charnel airs, or cavern-damp, So quickly do his baleful sighs Quench all the sweet light of her eyes. One struggle—and his pain is past— Her lover is no longer living! One kiss the maiden gives, one last, Long kiss, which she expires in giving! “Sleep,” said the Peri, as softly she stole The farewell sigh of that vanishing soul, As true as e'er warm'd a woman's breast— “Sleep on, in visions of odour rest, “In balmier airs than ever yet stirr'd “The' enchanted pile of that lonely bird, “Who sings at the last his own death-lay “In the East, they suppose the Phœnix to have fifty orifices in his bill, which are continued to his tail; and that, after living one thousand years, he builds himself a funeral pile, sings a melodious air of different harmonies through his fifty organ pipes, flaps his wings with a velocity which sets fire to the wood, and consumes himself.” —Richardson., “And in music and perfume dies away!” Thus saying, from her lips she spread Unearthly breathings through the place, And shook her sparkling wreath, and shed Such lustre o'er each paly face, That like two lovely saints they seem'd, Upon the eve of doomsday taken From their dim graves, in odour sleeping; While that benevolent Peri beam'd Like their good angel, calmly keeping Watch o'er them till their souls would waken. But morn is blushing in the sky; Again the Peri soars above, Bearing to Heav'n that precious sigh Of pure, self-sacrificing love. High throbb'd her heart, with hope elate, The Elysian palm she soon shall win, For the bright Spirit at the gate Smil'd as she gave that offering in; And she already hears the trees Of Eden, with their crystal bells Ringing in that ambrosial breeze That from the throne of Alla swells; And she can see the starry bowls That lie around that lucid lake, Upon whose banks admitted Souls Their first sweet draught of glory take! “On the shores of a quadrangular lake stand a thousand goblets, made of stars, out of which souls predestined to enjoy felicity drink the crystal wave.” —From Chateaubriand's Description of the Mahometan Paradise, in his Beauties of Christianity. But, ah! even Peris' hopes are vain— Again the Fates forbade, again The' immortal barrier clos'd—“Not yet,” The Angel said as, with regret, He shut from her that glimpse of glory— “True was the maiden, and her story, “Written in light o'er Alla's head, “By seraph eyes shall long be read. “But, Peri, see—the crystal bar “Of Eden moves not—holier far “Than ev'n this sigh the boon must be “That opes the Gates of Heav'n for thee.” Now, upon Syria's land of roses Richardson thinks that Syria had its name from Suri, a beautiful and delicate species of rose, for which that country has been always famous;—hence, Suristan, the Land of Roses. Softly the light of Eve reposes, And, like a glory, the broad sun Hangs over sainted Lebanon; Whose head in wintry grandeur towers, And whitens with eternal sleet, While summer, in a vale of flowers, Is sleeping rosy at his feet. To one, who look'd from upper air O'er all the' enchanted regions there, How beauteous must have been the glow, The life, the sparkling from below! Fair gardens, shining streams, with ranks Of golden melons on their banks, More golden where the sun-light falls;— Gay lizards, glittering on the walls “The number of lizards I saw one day in the great court of the Temple of the Sun at Balbec amounted to many thousands; the ground, the walls, and stones of the ruined buildings, were covered with them.” —Bruce. Of ruin'd shrines, busy and bright As they were all alive with light; And, yet more splendid, numerous flocks Of pigeons, settling on the rocks, With their rich restless wings, that gleam Variously in the crimson beam Of the warm West,—as if inlaid With brilliants from the mine, or made Of tearless rainbows, such as span The' unclouded skies of Peristan. And then the mingling sounds that come, Of shepherd's ancient reed “The Syrinx or Pan's pipe is still a pastoral instrument in Syria.” —Russel., with hum Of the wild bees of Palestine “Wild bees, frequent in Palestine, in hollow trunks or branches of trees, and the clefts of rocks. Thus it is said (Psalm lxxxi.), ‘honey out of the stony rock.’” —Burder's Oriental Customs., Banquetting through the flowery vales; And, Jordan, those sweet banks of thine, And woods, so full of nightingales. “The river Jordan is on both sides beset with little, thick, and pleasant woods, among which thousands of nightingales warble all together.” —Thevenot. But nought can charm the luckless Peri; Her soul is sad—her wings are weary— Joyless she sees the Sun look down On that great Temple, once his own The Temple of the Sun at Balbec., Whose lonely columns stand sublime, Flinging their shadows from on high, Like dials, which the wizard, Time, Had rais'd to count his ages by! Yet haply there may lie conceal'd Beneath those Chambers of the Sun, Some amulet of gems, anneal'd In upper fires, some tablet seal'd With the great name of Solomon, Which, spell'd by her illumin'd eyes, May teach her where, beneath the moon, In earth or ocean, lies the boon, The charm, that can restore so soon An erring Spirit to the skies. Cheer'd by this hope she bends her thither;— Still laughs the radiant eye of Heaven, Nor have the golden bowers of Even In the rich West begun to wither;— When, o'er the vale of Balbec winging Slowly, she sees a child at play, Among the rosy wild flowers singing, As rosy and as wild as they; Chasing, with eager hands and eyes, The beautiful blue-damsel flies “You behold there a considerable number of a remarkable species of beautiful insects, the elegance of whose appearance and their attire procured for them the name of Damsels.” —Sonnini. That flutter'd round the jasmine stems, Like winged flowers or flying gems:— And, near the boy, who tir'd with play Now nestling 'mid the roses lay, She saw a wearied man dismount From his hot steed, and on the brink Of a small imaret's rustic fount Imaret, “hospice où on loge et nourrit, gratis, les pélerins pendant trois jours.” —Toderini, translated by the Abbé de Cournand. —See also Castellan's Mœurs des Othomans, tom. v. p. 145. Impatient fling him down to drink. Then swift his haggard brow he turn'd To the fair child, who fearless sat, Though never yet hath day-beam burn'd Upon a brow more fierce than that,— Sullenly fierce—a mixture dire, Like thunder-clouds, of gloom and fire; In which the Peri's eye could read Dark tales of many a ruthless deed; The ruin'd maid—the shrine profan'd— Oaths broken—and the threshold stain'd With blood of guests!—there written, all, Black as the damning drops that fall From the denouncing Angel's pen, Ere Mercy weeps them out again. Yet tranquil now that man of crime (As if the balmy evening time Soften'd his spirit) look'd and lay, Watching the rosy infant's play:— Though still, whene'er his eye by chance Fell on the boy's, its lurid glance Met that unclouded, joyous gaze, As torches, that have burnt all night Through some impure and godless rite, Encounter morning's glorious rays. But, hark! the vesper call to prayer, As slow the orb of daylight sets, Is rising sweetly on the air, From Syria's thousand minarets! The boy has started from the bed Of flowers, where he had laid his head, And down upon the fragrant sod Kneels “Such Turks as at the common hours of prayer are on the road, or so employed as not to find convenience to attend the mosques, are still obliged to execute that duty; nor are they ever known to fail, whatever business they are then about, but pray immediately when the hour alarms them, whatever they are about, in that very place they chance to stand on; insomuch that when a janissary, whom you have to guard you up and down the city, hears the notice which is given him from the steeples, he will turn about, stand still, and beckon with his hand, to tell his charge he must have patience for awhile; when, taking out his handkerchief, he spreads it on the ground, sits cross-legged thereupon, and says his prayers, though in the open market, which, having ended, he leaps briskly up, salutes the person whom he undertook to convey, and renews his journey with the mild expression of Ghell gohnnum ghell, or Come, dear, follow me.” —Aaron Hill's Travels., with his forehead to the south, Lisping the' eternal name of God From Purity's own cherub mouth, And looking, while his hands and eyes Are lifted to the glowing skies, Like a stray babe of Paradise, Just lighted on that flowery plain, And seeking for its home again. Oh! 'twas a sight—that Heav'n—that child— A scene, which might have well beguil'd Ev'n haughty Eblis of a sigh For glories lost and peace gone by! And how felt he, the wretched Man Reclining there—while memory ran O'er many a year of guilt and strife, Flew o'er the dark flood of his life, Nor found one sunny resting-place, Nor brought him back one branch of grace. “There was a time,” he said, in mild, Heart-humbled tones—“thou blessed child! “When, young and haply pure as thou, “I look'd and pray'd like thee—but now—” He hung his head—each nobler aim, And hope, and feeling, which had slept From boyhood's hour, that instant came Fresh o'er him, and he wept—he wept! Blest tears of soul-felt penitence! In whose benign, redeeming flow Is felt the first, the only sense Of guiltless joy that guilt can know. “There's a drop,” said the Peri, “that down from the moon “Falls through the withering airs of June “Upon Egypt's land The Nucta, or Miraculous Drop, which falls in Egypt precisely on St. John's day, in June, and is supposed to have the effect of stopping the plague., of so healing a power, “So balmy a virtue, that ev'n in the hour “That drop descends, contagion dies, “And health re-animates earth and skies!— “Oh, is it not thus, thou man of sin, “The precious tears of repentance fall? “Though foul thy fiery plagues within, “One heavenly drop hath dispell'd them all!” And now—behold him kneeling there By the child's side, in humble prayer, While the same sunbeam shines upon The guilty and the guiltless one, And hymns of joy proclaim through Heaven The triumph of a Soul Forgiven! 'Twas when the golden orb had set, While on their knees they linger'd yet, There fell a light more lovely far Than ever came from sun or star, Upon the tear that, warm and meek, Dew'd that repentant sinner's cheek. To mortal eye this light might seem A northern flash or meteor beam— But well the' enraptur'd Peri knew Twas a bright smile the Angel threw From Heaven's gate, to hail that tear Her harbinger of glory near! “Joy, joy for ever! my task is done— “The Gates are pass'd, and Heaven is won! “Oh! am I not happy? I am, I am— “To thee, sweet Eden! how dark and sad “Are the diamond turrets of Shadukiam The Country of Delight—the name of a province in the kingdom of Jinnistan, or Fairy Land, the capital of which is called the City of Jewels. Amberabad is another of the cities of Jinnistan., “And the fragrant bowers of Amberabad! “Farewell, ye odours of Earth, that die “Passing away like a lover's sigh;— “My feast is now of the Tooba Tree The tree Tooba, that stands in Paradise, in the palace of Mahomet. See Sale's Prelim. Disc.—Tooba, says D'Herbelot, signifies beatitude, or eternal happiness., “Whose scent is the breath of Eternity! “Farewell, ye vanishing flowers, that shone “In my fairy wreath, so bright and brief;— “Oh! what are the brightest that e'er have blown, “To the lote-tree, springing by Alla's throne Mahomet is described, in the 53d chapter of the Koran, as having seen the angel Gabriel “by the lote-tree, beyond which there is no passing: near it is the Garden of Eternal Abode.” This tree, says the commentators, stands in the seventh Heaven, on the right hand of the Throne of God., “Whose flowers have a soul in every leaf. “Joy, joy for ever!—my task is done— “The Gates are pass'd, and Heav'n is won!” [Tell me not of joys above] Tell me not of joys above, If that world can give no bliss, Truer, happier than the Love Which enslaves our souls in this. Tell me not of Houris' eyes;— Far from me their dangerous glow, If those looks that light the skies Wound like some that burn below. Who, that feels what Love is here, All its falsehood—all its pain— Would, for ev'n Elysium's sphere, Risk the fatal dream again? Who, that midst a desert's heat Sees the waters fade away, Would not rather die than meet Streams again as false as they? THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS. 'Tis moonlight over Oman's Sea The Persian Gulf, sometimes so called, which separates the shores of Persia and Arabia.; Her banks of pearl and palmy isles Bask in the night-beam beauteously, And her blue waters sleep in smiles. 'Tis moonlight in Harmozia's The present Gombaroon, a town on the Persian side of the Gulf. walls, And through her Emir's porphyry halls, Where, some hours since, was heard the swell Of trumpet and the clash of zel A Moorish instrument of music., Bidding the bright-eyed sun farewell;— The peaceful sun, whom better suits The music of the bulbul's nest, Or the light touch of lovers' lutes, To sing him to his golden rest. All hush'd—there's not a breeze in motion; The shore is silent as the ocean. If zephyrs come, so light they come, Nor leaf is stirr'd nor wave is driven;— The wind-tower on the Emir's dome “At Gombaroon and other places in Persia, they have towers for the purpose of catching the wind, and cooling the houses.” —Le Bruyn. Can hardly win a breath from heaven. Ev'n he, that tyrant Arab, sleeps Calm, while a nation round him weeps; While curses load the air he breathes, And falchions from unnumber'd sheaths Are starting to avenge the shame His race hath brought on Iran's “Iran is the true general name for the empire of Persia.” —Asiat. Res. Disc. 5. name. Hard, heartless Chief, unmov'd alike Mid eyes that weep, and swords that strike;— One of that saintly, murderous brood, To carnage and the Koran given, Who think through unbelievers' blood Lies their directest path to heaven;— One, who will pause and kneel unshod In the warm blood his hand hath pour'd, To mutter o'er some text of God Engraven on his reeking sword “On the blades of their scimitars some verse from the Koran is usually inscribed.” —Russel.;— Nay, who can coolly note the line, The letter of those words divine, To which his blade, with searching art, Had sunk into its victim's heart! Just Alla! what must be thy look, When such a wretch before thee stands Unblushing, with thy Sacred Book,— Turning the leaves with blood-stain'd hands, And wresting from its page sublime His creed of lust, and hate, and crime;— Ev'n as those bees of Trebizond, Which, from the sunniest flowers that glad With their pure smile the gardens round, Draw venom forth that drives men mad. “There is a kind of Rhododendros about Trebizond, whose flowers the bee feeds upon, and the honey thence drives people mad.” —Tournefort. Never did fierce Arabia send A satrap forth more direly great; Never was Iran doom'd to bend Beneath a yoke of deadlier weight. Her throne had fall'n—her pride was crush'd— Her sons were willing slaves, nor blush'd, In their own land,—no more their own,— To crouch beneath a stranger's throne. Her towers, where Mithra once had burn'd, To Moslem shrines—oh shame!—were turn'd, Where slaves, converted by the sword, Their mean, apostate worship pour'd, And curs'd the faith their sires ador'd. Yet has she hearts, mid all this ill, O'er all this wreck high buoyant still With hope and vengeance;—hearts that yet— Like gems, in darkness, issuing rays They've treasur'd from the sun that's set,— Beam all the light of long-lost days! And swords she hath, nor weak nor slow To second all such hearts can dare; As he shall know, well, dearly know, Who sleeps in moonlight luxury there, Tranquil as if his spirit lay Becalm'd in Heav'n's approving ray. Sleep on—for purer eyes than thine Those waves are hush'd, those planets shine; Sleep on, and be thy rest unmov'd By the white moonbeam's dazzling power;— None but the loving and the lov'd Should be awake at this sweet hour. And see—where, high above those rocks That o'er the deep their shadows fling, Yon turret stands;—where ebon locks, As glossy as a heron's wing Upon the turban of a king “Their kings wear plumes of black herons' feathers upon the right side, as a badge of sovereignty.” —Hanway., Hang from the lattice, long and wild,— 'Tis she, that Emir's blooming child, All truth and tenderness and grace, Though born of such ungentle race;— An image of Youth's radiant Fountain Springing in a desolate mountain! “The Fountain of Youth, by a Mahometan tradition, is situated in some dark region of the East.” —Richardson. Oh what a pure and sacred thing Is Beauty, curtain'd from the sight Of the gross world, illumining One only mansion with her light! Unseen by man's disturbing eye,— The flower that blooms beneath the sea, Too deep for sunbeams, doth not lie Hid in more chaste obscurity. So, Hinda, have thy face and mind, Like holy mysteries, lain enshrin'd. And oh, what transport for a lover To lift the veil that shades them o'er!— Like those who, all at once, discover In the lone deep some fairy shore, Where mortal never trod before, And sleep and wake in scented airs No lip had ever breath'd but theirs. Beautiful are the maids that glide, On summer-eves, through Yemen's Arabia Felix. dales, And bright the glancing looks they hide Behind their litters' roseate veils;— And brides, as delicate and fair As the white jasmine flowers they wear, Hath Yemen in her blissful clime, Who, lull'd in cool kiosk or bower “In the midst of the garden is the chiosk, that is, a large room, commonly beautified with a fine fountain in the midst of it. It is raised nine or ten steps, and inclosed with gilded lattices, round which vines, jessamines, and honeysuckles, make a sort of green wall; large trees are planted round this place, which is the scene of their greatest pleasures.” —Lady M. W. Montagu., Before their mirrors count the time The women of the East are never without their looking-glasses. “In Barbary,” says Shaw, “they are so fond of their looking-glasses, which they hang upon their breasts, that they will not lay them aside, even when after the drudgery of the day they are obliged to go two or three miles with a pitcher or a goat's skin to fetch water.” —Travels. In other parts of Asia they wear little looking-glasses on their thumbs. “Hence (and from the lotus being considered the emblem of beauty) is the meaning of the following mute intercourse of two lovers before their parents:— “‘He with salute of deference due, A lotus to his forehead prest; She rais'd her mirror to his view, Then turn'd it inward to her breast.’” Asiatic Miscellany, vol. ii., And grow still lovelier every hour. But never yet hath bride or maid In Araby's gay Haram smil'd, Whose boasted brightness would not fade Before Al Hassan's blooming child. Light as the angel shapes that bless An infant's dream, yet not the less Rich in all woman's loveliness;— With eyes so pure, that from their ray Dark Vice would turn abash'd away, Blinded like serpents, when they gaze Upon the emerald's virgin blaze “They say that if a snake or serpent fix his eyes on the lustre of those stones (emeralds), he immediately becomes blind.” —Ahmed ben Abdalaziz, Treatise on Jewels.;— Yet fill'd with all youth's sweet desires, Mingling the meek and vestal fires Of other worlds with all the bliss, The fond, weak tenderness of this: A soul, too, more than half divine, Where, through some shades of earthly feeling, Religion's soften'd glories shine, Like light through summer foliage stealing, Shedding a glow of such mild hue, So warm, and yet so shadowy too, As makes the very darkness there More beautiful than light elsewhere. Such is the maid who, at this hour, Hath risen from her restless sleep, And sits alone in that high bower, Watching the still and shining deep. Ah! 'twas not thus,—with tearful eyes And beating heart,—she us'd to gaze On the magnificent earth and skies, In her own land, in happier days. Why looks she now so anxious down Among those rocks, whose rugged frown Blackens the mirror of the deep? Whom waits she all this lonely night Too rough the rocks, too bold the steep, For man to scale that turret's height!— So deem'd at least her thoughtful sire, When high, to catch the cool night-air, After the day-beam's withering fire “At Gombaroon and the Isle of Ormus it is sometimes so hot, that the people are obliged to lie all day in the water.” —Marco Polo., He built her bower of freshness there, And had it deck'd with costliest skill, And fondly thought it safe as fair:— Think, reverend dreamer! think so still, Nor wake to learn what Love can dare;— Love, all-defying Love, who sees No charm in trophies won with ease;— Whose rarest, dearest fruits of bliss Are pluck'd on Danger's precipice! Bolder than they, who dare not dive For pearls, but when the sea's at rest, Love, in the tempest most alive, Hath ever held that pearl the best He finds beneath the stormiest water. Yes—Araby's unrivall'd daughter, Though high that tower, that rock-way rude, There's one who, but to kiss thy cheek, Would climb the' untrodden solitude Of Ararat's tremendous peak This mountain is generally supposed to be inaccessible. Struy says, “I can well assure the reader that their opinion is not true, who suppose this mount to be inaccessible.” He adds, that “the lower part of the mountain is cloudy, misty, and dark, the middlemost part very cold, and like clouds of snow, but the upper regions perfectly calm.”—It was on this mountain that the Ark was supposed to have rested after the Deluge, and part of it, they say, exists there still, which Struy thus gravely accounts for:—“Whereas none can remember that the air on the top of the hill did ever change or was subject either to wind or rain, which is presumed to be the reason that the Ark has endured so long without being rotten.” —See Carreri's Travels, where the Doctor laughs at this whole account of Mount Ararat., And think its steeps, though dark and dread, Heav'n's pathways, if to thee they led! Ev'n now thou seest the flashing spray, That lights his oar's impatient way;— Ev'n now thou hear'st the sudden shock Of his swift bark against the rock, And stretchest down thy arms of snow, As if to lift him from below! Like her to whom, at dead of night, The bridegroom, with his locks of light In one of the books of the Shâh Nâmeh, when Zal (a celebrated hero of Persia, remarkable for his white hair,) comes to the terrace of his mistress Rodahver at night, she lets down her long tresses to assist him in his ascent;—he, however, manages it in a less romantic way by fixing his crook in a projecting beam.—See Champion's Ferdosi., Came, in the flush of love and pride, And scal'd the terrace of his bride;— When, as she saw him rashly spring, And midway up in danger cling, She flung him down her long black hair, Exclaiming, breathless, “There, love, there!” And scarce did manlier nerve uphold The hero Zal in that fond hour, Than wings the youth who, fleet and bold, Now climbs the rocks to Hinda's bower. See—light as up their granite steeps The rock-goats of Arabia clamber “On the lofty hills of Arabia Petræa are rock-goats.” —Niebuhr., Fearless from crag to crag he leaps, And now is in the maiden's chamber. She loves—but knows not whom she loves, Nor what his race, nor whence he came;— Like one who meets, in Indian groves, Some beauteous bird without a name, Brought by the last ambrosial breeze, From isles in the' undiscover'd seas, To show his plumage for a day To wondering eyes, and wing away! Will he thus fly—her nameless lover? Alla forbid! 'twas by a moon As fair as this, while singing over Some ditty to her soft Kanoon “Canun, espéce de psalterion, avec des cordes de boyaux; les dames en touchent dans le serrail, avec des décailles armées de pointes de cooc.” —Toderini, translated by De Cournand., Alone, at this same witching hour, She first beheld his radiant eyes Gleam through the lattice of the bower, Where nightly now they mix their sighs; And thought some spirit of the air (For what could waft a mortal there?) Was pausing on his moonlight way To listen to her lonely lay! This fancy ne'er hath left her mind: And—though, when terror's swoon had past, She saw a youth, of mortal kind, Before her in obeisance cast,— Yet often since, when he hath spoke Strange, awful words,—and gleams have broken From his dark eyes, too bright to bear, Oh! she hath fear'd her soul was given To some unhallow'd child of air, Some erring Spirit cast from heaven, Like those angelic youths of old, Who burn'd for maids of mortal mould, Bewilder'd left the glorious skies, And lost their heaven for woman's eyes. Fond girl! nor fiend nor angel he Who woos thy young simplicity; But one of earth's impassion'd sons, As warm in love, as fierce in ire As the best heart whose current runs Full of the Day-God's living fire. But quench'd to-night that ardour seems, And pale his cheek, and sunk his brow;— Never before, but in her dreams, Had she beheld him pale as now: And those were dreams of troubled sleep, From which 'twas joy to wake and weep; Visions, that will not be forgot, But sadden every waking scene, Like warning ghosts, that leave the spot All wither'd where they once have been. “How sweetly,” said the trembling maid, Of her own gentle voice afraid, So long had they in silence stood, Looking upon that tranquil flood— “How sweetly does the moon-beam smile “To-night upon yon leafy isle! “Oft, in my fancy's wanderings, “I've wish'd that little isle had wings, “And we, within its fairy bowers, “Were wafted off to seas unknown, “Where not a pulse should beat but ours, “And we might live, love, die alone! “Far from the cruel and the cold,— “Where the bright eyes of angels only “Should come around us, to behold “A paradise so pure and lonely. “Would this be world enough for thee?”— Playful she turn'd, that he might see The passing smile her cheek put on; But when she mark'd how mournfully His eyes met hers, that smile was gone; And, bursting into heart-felt tears, “Yes, yes,” she cried, “my hourly fears, “My dreams have boded all too right— “We part—for ever part—to-night! “I knew, I knew it could not last— “'Twas bright, 'twas heavenly, but 'tis past! “Oh! ever thus, from childhood's hour, “I've seen my fondest hopes decay; “I never loved a tree or flower, “But 'twas the first to fade away. “I never nurs'd a dear gazelle, “To glad me with its soft black eye, “But when it came to know me well, “And love me, it was sure to die! “Now too—the joy most like divine “Of all I ever dreamt or knew, “To see thee, hear thee, call thee mine,— “Oh misery! must I lose that too? “Yet go—on peril's brink we meet;— “Those frightful rocks—that treacherous sea— “No, never come again—though sweet, “Though heaven, it may be death to thee. “Farewell—and blessings on thy way, “Where'er thou go'st, beloved stranger! “Better to sit and watch that ray, “And think thee safe, though far away, “Than have thee near me, and in danger!” “Danger!—oh, tempt me not to boast—” The youth exclaim'd—“thou little know'st “What he can brave, who, born and nurst “In Danger's paths, has dar'd her worst; “Upon whose ear the signal-word “Of strife and death is hourly breaking; “Who sleeps with head upon the sword “His fever'd hand must grasp in waking. “Danger!—” “Say on—thou fear'st not then, “And we may meet—oft meet again?” “Oh! look not so—beneath the skies “I now fear nothing but those eyes. “If aught on earth could charm or force “My spirit from its destin'd course,— “If aught could make this soul forget “The bond to which its seal is set, “'Twould be those eyes;—they, only they, “Could melt that sacred seal away! “But no—'tis fix'd—my awful doom “Is fix'd—on this side of the tomb “We meet no more;—why, why did Heaven “Mingle two souls that earth has riven, “Has rent asunder wide as ours? “Oh, Arab maid, as soon the Powers “Of Light and Darkness may combine, “As I be link'd with thee or thine! “Thy Father—” “Holy Alla save “His grey head from that lightning glance! “Thou know'st him not—he loves the brave; “Nor lives there under heaven's expanse “One who would prize, would worship thee “And thy bold spirit, more than he. “Oft when, in childhood, I have play'd “With the bright falchion by his side, “I've heard him swear his lisping maid “In time should be a warrior's bride. “And still, whene'er at Haram hours, “I take him cool sherbets and flowers, “He tells me, when in playful mood, “A hero shall my bridegroom be, “Since maids are best in battle woo'd, “And won with shouts of victory! “Nay, turn not from me—thou alone “Art form'd to make both hearts thy own. “Go—join his sacred ranks—thou know'st “The' unholy strife these Persians wage:— “Good Heav'n, that frown!—even now thou glow'st “With more than mortal warrior's rage. “Haste to the camp by morning's light, “And, when that sword is rais'd in fight, “Oh still remember, Love and I “Beneath its shadow trembling lie! “One victory o'er those Slaves of Fire, “Those impious Ghebers, whom my sire “Abhors—” “Hold, hold—thy words are death—” The stranger cried, as wild he flung His mantle back, and show'd beneath The Gheber belt that round him clung. “They (the Ghebers) lay so much stress on their cushee or girdle, as not to dare to be an instant without it.” —Grose's Voyage. —“Le jeune homme nia d'abord la chose; mais, ayant ètè dèpouillè de sa robe, et la large ceinture qu'il portoit comme Ghebr,” &amp;c. &amp;c. —D'Herbelot, art.

D'Herbelot says this belt was generally of leather.— “Here, maiden, look—weep—blush to see “All that thy sire abhors in me! “Yes—I am of that impious race, “Those Slaves of Fire who, morn and even, “Hail their Creator's dwelling-place “Among the living lights of heaven “They suppose the Throne of the Almighty is seated in the sun, and hence their worship of that luminary.” —Hanway. “As to fire, the Ghebers place the spring-head of it in that globe of fire, the Sun, by them called Mythras, or Mihir, to which they pay the highest reverence, in gratitude for the manifold benefits flowing from its ministerial omniscience. But they are so far from confounding the subordination of the Servant with the majesty of its Creator, that they not only attribute no sort of sense or reasoning to the sun or fire, in any of its operations, but consider it as a purely passive blind instrument, directed and governed by the immediate impression on it of the will of God; but they do not even give that luminary, all-glorious as it is, more than the second rank amongst his works, reserving the first for that stupendous production of divine power, the mind of man.” —Grose. The false charges brought against the religion of these people by their Mussulman tyrants is but one proof among many of the truth of this writer's remark, that “calumny is often added to oppression, if but for the sake of justifying it.”: “Yes—I am of that outcast few, “To Iran and to vengeance true, “Who curse the hour your Arabs came “To desolate our shrines of flame, “And swear, before God's burning eye, “To break our country's chains, or die! “Thy bigot sire,—nay, tremble not,— “He, who gave birth to those dear eyes, “With me is sacred as the spot “From which our fires of worship rise! “But know—'twas he I sought that night, “When, from my watch-boat on the sea, “I caught this turret's glimmering light, “And up the rude rocks desperately “Rush'd to my prey—thou know'st the rest— “I climb'd the gory vulture's nest, “And found a trembling dove within;— “Thine, thine the victory—thine the sin— “If Love hath made one thought his own, “That Vengeance claims first—last—alone! “Oh! had we never, never met, “Or could this heart ev'n now forget “How link'd, how bless'd we might have been, “Had fate not frown'd so dark between! “Hadst thou been born a Persian maid, “In neighbouring valleys had we dwelt, “Through the same fields in childhood play'd, “At the same kindling altar knelt,— “Then, then, while all those nameless ties, “In which the charm of Country lies, “Had round our hearts been hourly spun, “Till Iran's cause and thine were one; “While in thy lute's awakening sigh “I heard the voice of days gone by, “And saw, in every smile of thine, “Returning hours of glory shine;— “While the wrong'd Spirit of our Land “Liv'd, look'd, and spoke her wrongs through thee,— “God! who could then this sword withstand? “Its very flash were victory! “But now—estrang'd, divorc'd for ever, “Far as the grasp of Fate can sever; “Our only ties what love has wove,— “In faith, friends, country, sunder'd wide; “And then, then only, true to love, “When false to all that's dear beside! “Thy father Iran's deadliest foe— “Thyself, perhaps, ev'n now—but no— “Hate never look'd so lovely yet! “No—sacred to thy soul will be “The land of him who could forget “All but that bleeding land for thee. “When other eyes shall see, unmov'd, “Her widows mourn, her warriors fall, “Thou'lt think how well one Gheber lov'd, “And for his sake thou'lt weep for all! “But look—” With sudden start he turn'd And pointed to the distant wave, Where lights, like charnel meteors, burn'd Bluely, as o'er some seaman's grave; And fiery darts, at intervals “The Mameluks that were in the other boat, when it was dark used to shoot up a sort of fiery arrows into the air which in some measure resembled lightning or falling stars.” —Baumgarten., Flew up all sparkling from the main, As if each star that nightly falls, Were shooting back to heaven again. “My signal lights!—I must away— “Both, both are ruin'd, if I stay. “Farewell—sweet life! thou cling'st in vain— “Now, Vengeance, I am thine again!” Fiercely he broke away, nor stopp'd, Nor look'd—but from the lattice dropp'd Down mid the pointed crags beneath, As if he fled from love to death. While pale and mute young Hinda stood, Nor mov'd, till in the silent flood A momentary plunge below Startled her from her trance of woe;— Shrieking she to the lattice flew, “I come—I come—if in that tide “Thou sleep'st to-night, I'll sleep there too, “In death's cold wedlock, by thy side. “Oh! I would ask no happier bed “Than the chill wave my love lies under:— “Sweeter to rest together dead, “Far sweeter, than to live asunder!” But no—their hour is not yet come— Again she sees his pinnace fly, Wafting him fleetly to his home, Where'er that ill-starr'd home may lie; And calm and smooth it seem'd to win Its moonlight way before the wind, As if it bore all peace within, Nor left one breaking heart behind!

From the high trees, where all the night She sung so sweet, with none to listen; And hides her from the morning star Where thickets of pomegranate glisten In the clear dawn,—bespangled o'er With dew, whose night-drops would not stain The best and brightest scimitar In speaking of the climate of Shiraz, Francklin says, “The dew is of such a pure nature, that if the brightest scimitar should be exposed to it all night, it would not receive the least rust.” That ever youthful Sultan wore On the first morning of his reign. And see—the Sun himself!—on wings Of glory up the East he springs. Angel of Light! who from the time Those heavens began their march sublime, Hath first of all the starry choir Trod in his Maker's steps of fire! Where are the days, thou wondrous sphere, When Iran, like a sun-flower, turn'd To meet that eye where'er it burn'd?— When, from the banks of Bendemeer To the nut-groves of Samarcand, Thy temples flam'd o'er all the land? Where are they? ask the shades of them Who, on Cadessia's The place where the Persians were finally defeated by the Arabs, and their ancient monarchy destroyed. bloody plains, Saw fierce invaders pluck the gem From Iran's broken diadem, And bind her ancient faith in chains:— Ask the poor exile, cast alone On foreign shores, unlov'd, unknown, Beyond the Caspian's Iron Gates Derbend.—“Les Tures appellent cette ville Demir Capi, Porte de Fer; ce sont les Caspiæ Portæ des anciens.” —D'Herbelot., Or on the snowy Mossian mountains, Far from his beauteous land of dates, Her jasmine bowers and sunny fountains: Yet happier so than if he trod His own belov'd, but blighted, sod, Beneath a despot stranger's nod!— Oh, he would rather houseless roam Where Freedom and his God may lead, Than be the sleekest slave at home That crouches to the conqueror's creed! Is Iran's pride then gone for ever, Quench'd with the flame in Mithra's caves?— No—she has sons, that never—never— Will stoop to be the Moslem's slaves, While heaven has light or earth has graves;— Spirits of fire, that brood not long, But flash resentment back for wrong; And hearts where, slow but deep, the seeds Of vengeance ripen into deeds, Till, in some treacherous hour of calm, They burst, like Zeilan's giant palm The Talpot or Talipot tree. “This beautiful palm-tree, which grows in the heart of the forests, may be classed among the loftiest trees, and becomes still higher when on the point of bursting forth from its leafy summit. The sheath which then envelopes the flower is very large, and, when it bursts, makes an explosion like the report of a cannon.” —Thunberg., Whose buds fly open with a sound That shakes the pigmy forests round! Yes, Emir! he, who scal'd that tower, And, had he reach'd thy slumbering breast, Had taught thee, in a Gheber's power How safe ev'n tyrant heads may rest— Is one of many, brave as he, Who loathe thy haughty race and thee; Who, though they know the strife is vain, Who, though they know the riven chain Snaps but to enter in the heart Of him who rends its links apart, Yet dare the issue,—blest to be Ev'n for one bleeding moment free, And die in pangs of liberty! Thou know'st them well—'tis some moons since Thy turban'd troops and blood-red flags, Thou satrap of a bigot Prince, Have swarm'd among these Green Sea crags; Yet here, ev'n here, a sacred band Ay, in the portal of that land Thou, Arab, dar'st to call thy own, Their spears across thy path have thrown; Here—ere the winds half wing'd thee o'er— Rebellion brav'd thee from the shore. Rebellion! foul, dishonouring word, Whose wrongful blight so oft has stain'd The holiest cause that tongue or sword Of mortal ever lost or gain'd. How many a spirit, born to bless, Hath sunk beneath that withering name, Whom but a day's, an hour's success Had wafted to eternal fame! As exhalations, when they burst From the warm earth, if chill'd at first, If check'd in soaring from the plain, Darken to fogs and sink again;— But, if they once triumphant spread Their wings above the mountain-head, Become enthron'd in upper air, And turn to sun-bright glories there! And who is he, that wields the might Of Freedom on the Green Sea brink, Before whose sabre's dazzling light “When the bright cimitars make the eyes of our heroes wink.” —The Moallakat, Poem of Amru. The eyes of Yemen's warriors wink? Who comes, embower'd in the spears Of Kerman's hardy mountaineers?— Those mountaineers that truest, last, Cling to their country's ancient rites, As if that God, whose eyelids cast Their closing gleam on Iran's heights, Among her snowy mountains threw The last light of his worship too! 'Tis Hafed—name of fear, whose sound Chills like the muttering of a charm!— Shout but that awful name around, And palsy shakes the manliest arm. 'Tis Hafed, most accurs'd and dire (So rank'd by Moslem hate and ire) Of all the rebel Sons of Fire; Of whose malign, tremendous power The Arabs, at their mid-watch hour, Such tales of fearful wonder tell, That each affrighted sentinel Pulls down his cowl upon his eyes, Lest Hafed in the midst should rise! A man, they say, of monstrous birth, A mingled race of flame and earth, Sprung from those old, enchanted kings Tahmuras, and other ancient Kings of Persia; whose adventures in Fairy-land among the Peris and Dives may be found in Richardson's curious Dissertation. The griffin Simoorgh, they say, took some feathers from her breast for Tahmuras, with which he adorned his helmet, and transmitted them afterwards to his descendants., Who in their fairy helms, of yore A feather from the mystic wings Of the Simoorgh resistless wore; And gifted by the Fiends of Fire, Who groan'd to see their shrines expire, With charms that, all in vain withstood, Would drown the Koran's light in blood! Such were the tales, that won belief, And such the colouring Fancy gave To a young, warm, and dauntless Chief,— One who, no more than mortal brave, Fought for the land his soul ador'd, For happy homes and altars free,— His only talisman, the sword, His only spell-word, Liberty! One of that ancient hero line, Along whose glorious current shine Names, that have sanctified their blood; As Lebanon's small mountain-flood Is render'd holy by the ranks Of sainted cedars on its banks. This rivulet, says Dandini, is called the Holy River from the “cedar-saints” among which it rises. In the Lettres Edifiantes, there is a different cause assigned for its name of Holy. “In these are deep caverns, which formerly served as so many cells for a great number of recluses, who had chosen these retreats as the only witnesses upon earth of the severity of their penance. The tears of these pious penitents gave the river of which we have just treated the name of the Holy River.” —See Chateaubriand's Beauties of Christianity. 'Twas not for him to crouch the knee Tamely to Moslem tyranny; 'Twas not for him, whose soul was cast In the bright mould of ages past, Whose melancholy spirit, fed With all the glories of the dead, Though fram'd for Iran's happiest years, Was born among her chains and tears!— 'Twas not for him to swell the crowd Of slavish heads, that shrinking bow'd Before the Moslem, as he pass'd, Like shrubs beneath the poison-blast— No—far he fled—indignant fled The pageant of his country's shame; While every tear her children shed Fell on his soul like drops of flame; And, as a lover hails the dawn Of a first smile, so welcom'd he The sparkle of the first sword drawn For vengeance and for liberty! But vain was valour—vain the flower Of Kerman, in that deathful hour, Against Al Hassan's whelming power.— In vain they met him, helm to helm, Upon the threshold of that realm He came in bigot pomp to sway, And with their corpses block'd his way— In vain—for every lance they rais'd, Thousands around the conqueror blaz'd; For every arm that lin'd their shore, Myriads of slaves were wafted o'er,— A bloody, bold, and countless crowd, Before whose swarm as fast they bow'd As dates beneath the locust cloud. There stood—but one short league away From old Harmozia's sultry bay— A rocky mountain, o'er the Sea Of Oman beetling awfully This mountain is my own creation, as the “stupendous chain,” of which I suppose it a link, does not extend quite so far as the shores of the Persian Gulf. “This long and lofty range of mountains formerly divided Media from Assyria, and now forms the boundary of the Persian and Turkish empires. It runs parallel with the river Tigris and Persian Gulf, and almost disappearing in the vicinity of Gomberoon (Harmozia) seems once more to rise in the southern districts of Kerman, and following an easterly course through the centre of Meckraun and Balouchistan, is entirely lost in the deserts of Sinde.” —Kinnier's Persian Empire.; A last and solitary link Of those stupendous chains that reach From the broad Caspian's reedy brink Down winding to the Green Sea beach. Around its base the bare rocks stood, Like naked giants, in the flood, As if to guard the Gulf across; While, on its peak, that brav'd the sky, A ruin'd Temple tower'd, so high That oft the sleeping albatross These birds sleep in the air. They are most common about the Cape of Good Hope. Struck the wild ruins with her wing, And from her cloud-rock'd slumbering Started—to find man's dwelling there In her own silent fields of air! Beneath, terrific caverns gave Dark welcome to each stormy wave That dash'd, like midnight revellers, in;— And such the strange, mysterious din At times throughout those caverns roll'd,— And such the fearful wonders told Of restless sprites imprison'd there, That bold were Moslem, who would dare, At twilight hour, to steer his skiff Beneath the Gheber's lonely cliff. “There is an extraordinary hill in this neighbourhood, called Kohé Gubr, or the Guebre's mountain. It rises in the form of a lofty cupola, and on the summit of it, they say, are the remains of an Atush Kudu or Fire Temple. It is superstitiously held to be the residence of Deeves or Sprites, and many marvellous stories are recounted of the injury and witchcraft suffered by those who essayed in former days to ascend or explore it.” —Pottinger's Beloochistan. On the land side, those towers sublime, That seem'd above the grasp of Time, Were sever'd from the haunts of men By a wide, deep, and wizard glen, So fathomless, so full of gloom, No eye could pierce the void between: It seem'd a place where Gholes might come With their foul banquets from the tomb, And in its caverns feed unseen. Like distant thunder, from below, The sound of many torrents came, Too deep for eye or ear to know If 'twere the sea's imprison'd flow, Or floods of ever-restless flame. For, each ravine, each rocky spire Of that vast mountain stood on fire The Ghebers generally built their temples over subterraneous fires.; And, though for ever past the days When God was worshipp'd in the blaze That from its lofty altar shone,— Though fled the priests, the votaries gone, Still did the mighty flame burn on “At the city of Yezd, in Persia, which is distinguished by the appellation of the Darûb Abadut, or Seat of Religion, the Guebres are permitted to have an Atush Kudu or Fire Temple (which, they assert, has had the sacred fire in it since the days of Zoroaster) in their own compartment of the city; but for this indulgence they are indebted to the avarice, not the tolerance of the Persian government, which taxes them at twenty-five rupees each man.” —Pottinger's Beloochistan., Through chance and change, through good and ill, Like its own God's eternal will, Deep, constant, bright, unquenchable! Thither the vanquish'd Hafed led His little army's last remains;— “Welcome, terrific glen!” he said, “Thy gloom, that Eblis' self might dread, “Is Heav'n to him who flies from chains!” O'er a dark, narrow bridge-way, known To him and to his Chiefs alone, They cross'd the chasm and gain'd the towers,— “This home,” he cried, “at least is ours;— “Here we may bleed, unmock'd by hymns “Of Moslem triumph o'er our head; “Here we may fall, nor leave our limbs “To quiver to the Moslem's tread. “Stretch'd on this rock, while vultures' beaks “Are whetted on our yet warm cheeks, “Here—happy that no tyrant's eye “Gloats on our torments—we may die!”— 'Twas night when to those towers they came, And gloomily the fitful flame, That from the ruin'd altar broke, Glared on his features, as he spoke:— “'Tis o'er—what men could do, we've done— “If Iran will look tamely on, “And see her priests, her warriors driven “Before a sensual bigot's nod, “A wretch who shrines his lusts in heaven, “And makes a pander of his God; “If her proud sons, her high-born souls, “Men, in whose veins—oh last disgrace! “The blood of Zal and Rustam Ancient heroes of Persia. “Among the Guebres there are some, who boast their descent from Rustam.” —Stephen's Persia. rolls,— “If they will court this upstart race, “And turn from Mithra's ancient ray, “To kneel at shrines of yesterday; “If they will crouch to Iran's foes, “Why, let them—till the land's despair “Cries out to Heav'n, and bondage grows “Too vile for ev'n the vile to bear! “Till shame at last, long hidden, burns “Their inmost core, and conscience turns “Each coward tear the slave lets fall “Back on his heart in drops of gall. “But here, at least, are arms unchain'd, “And souls that thraldrom never stain'd;— “This spot, at least, no foot of slave “Or satrap ever yet profaned; “And though but few—though fast the wave “Of life is ebbing from our veins, “Enough for vengeance still remains. “As panthers, after set of sun, “Rush from the roots of Lebanon “Across the dark-sea robber's way See Russel's account of the panther's attacking travellers in the night on the sea-shore about the roots of Lebanon., “We'll bound upon our startled prey; “And when some hearts that proudest swell “Have felt our falchion's last farewell; “When Hope's expiring throb is o'er, “And ev'n Despair can prompt no more, “This spot shall be the sacred grave “Of the last few who, vainly brave, “Die for the land they cannot save!” His Chiefs stood round—each shining blade Upon the broken altar laid— And though so wild and desolate Those courts, where once the Mighty sate; Nor longer on those mouldering towers Was seen the feast of fruits and flowers, With which of old the Magi fed The wandering Spirits of their Dead “Among other ceremonies the Magi used to place upon the tops of high towers various kinds of rich viands, upon which it was supposed the Peris and the spirits of their departed heroes regaled themselves.” —Richardson.; Though neither priest nor rites were there, Nor charmed leaf of pure pomegranate In the ceremonies of the Ghebers round their Fire, as described by Lord, “the Daroo,” he says, “giveth them water to drink, and a pomegranate leaf to chew in the mouth, to cleanse them from inward uncleanness.”; Nor hymn, nor censer's fragrant air, Nor symbol of their worshipp'd planet “Early in the morning, they (the Parsees or Ghebers at Oulam) go in crowds to pay their devotions to the Sun, to whom upon all the altars there are spheres consecrated, made by magic, resembling the circles of the sun, and when the sun rises, these orbs seem to be inflamed, and to turn round with a great noise. They have every one a censer in their hands, and offer incense to the sun.” —Rabbi Benjamin.; Yet the same God that heard their sires Heard them, while on that altar's fires They swore “Nul d'entre eux oseroit se perjurer, quand il a pris à témoin cet élément terrible et vengeur.” —Encyclopédie Francoise. the latest, holiest deed Of the few hearts, still left to bleed, Should be, in Iran's injur'd name, To die upon that Mount of Flame— The last of all her patriot line, Before her last untrampled Shrine! Brave, suffering souls! they little knew How many a tear their injuries drew From one meek maid, one gentle foe, Whom love first touch'd with others' woe— Whose life, as free from thought as sin, Slept like a lake, till Love threw in His talisman, and woke the tide, And spread its trembling circles wide. Once, Emir! thy unheeding child, Mid all this havoc, bloom'd and smil'd,— Tranquil as on some battle plain The Persian lily shines and towers “A vivid verdure succeeds the autumnal rains, and the ploughed fields are covered with the Persian lily, of a resplendent yellow colour.” —Russel's Aleppo. Before the combat's reddening stain Hath fall'n upon her golden flowers. Light-hearted maid, unaw'd, unmov'd, While Heav'n but spar'd the sire she lov'd, Once at thy evening tales of blood Unlistening and aloof she stood— And oft, when thou hast pac'd along Thy Haram halls with furious heat, Hast thou not curs'd her cheerful song, That came across thee, calm and sweet, Like lutes of angels, touch'd so near Hell's confines, that the damn'd can hear! Far other feelings Love hath brought— Her soul all flame, her brow all sadness, She now has but the one dear thought, And thinks that o'er, almost to madness! Oft doth her sinking heart recall His words—“for my sake weep for all;” And bitterly, as day on day Of rebel carnage fast succeeds, She weeps a lover snatch'd away In every Gheber wretch that bleeds. There's not a sabre meets her eye, But with his life-blood seems to swim; There's not an arrow wings the sky, But fancy turns its point to him. No more she brings with footstep light Al Hassan's falchion for the fight; And—had he look'd with clearer sight, Had not the mists, that ever rise From a foul spirit, dimm'd his eyes— He would have mark'd her shuddering frame, When from the field of blood he came, The faltering speech—the look estrang'd— Voice, step, and life, and beauty chang'd— He would have mark'd all this, and known Such change is wrought by Love alone! Ah! not the Love, that should have bless'd So young, so innocent a breast; Not the pure, open, prosperous Love, That, pledg'd on earth and seal'd above, Grows in the world's approving eyes, In friendship's smile and home's caress, Collecting all the heart's sweet ties Into one knot of happiness! No, Hinda, no,—thy fatal flame Is nurs'd in silence, sorrow, shame;— A passion, without hope or pleasure, In thy soul's darkness buried deep, It lies, like some ill-gotten treasure,— Some idol, without shrine or name, O'er which its pale-ey'd votaries keep Unholy watch, while others sleep. Seven nights have darken'd Oman's sea, Since last, beneath the moonlight ray, She saw his light oar rapidly Hurry her Gheber's bark away,— And still she goes, at midnight hour, To weep alone in that high bower, And watch, and look along the deep For him whose smiles first made her weep;— But watching, weeping, all was vain, She never saw his bark again. The owlet's solitary cry, The night-hawk, flitting darkly by, And oft the hateful carrion bird, Heavily flapping his clogg'd wing, Which reek'd with that day's banquetting— Was all she saw, was all she heard. 'Tis the eighth morn—Al Hassan's brow Is brighten'd with unusual joy— What mighty mischief glads him now, Who never smiles but to destroy? The sparkle upon Herkend's Sea, When toss'd at midnight furiously “It is observed, with respect to the Sea of Herkend, that when it is tossed by tempestuous winds it sparkles like fire.” —Travels of Two Mohammedans., Tells not of wreck and ruin nigh, More surely than that smiling eye! “Up, daughter, up—the Kerna's A kind of trumpet;—it “was that used by Tamerlane, the sound of which is described as uncommonly dreadful, and so loud as to be heard at the distance of several miles.” —Richardson. breath “Has blown a blast would waken death, “And yet thou sleep'st—up, child, and see “This blessed day for Heaven and me, “A day more rich in Pagan blood “Than ever flash'd o'er Oman's flood. “Before another dawn shall shine, “His head—heart—limbs—will all be mine; “This very night his blood shall steep “These hands all over ere I sleep!”— “His blood!” she faintly scream'd—her mind Still singling one from all mankind— “Yes—spite of his ravines and towers, “Hafed, my child, this night is ours. “Thanks to all-conquering treachery, “Without whose aid the links accurst, “That bind these impious slaves, would be “Too strong for Alla's self to burst! “That rebel fiend, whose blade has spread “My path with piles of Moslem dead, “Whose baffling spells had almost driven “Back from their course the Swords of Heaven, “This night, with all his band shall know “How deep an Arab's steel can go, “When God and Vengeance speed the blow. “And—Prophet! by that holy wreath “Thou wor'st on Ohod's field of death “Mohammed had two helmets, an interior and exterior one; the latter of which, called Al Mawashah, the fillet, wreath, or wreathed garland, he wore at the battle of Ohod.” —Universal History., “I swear, for every sob that parts “In anguish from these heathen hearts, “A gem from Persia's plunder'd mines “Shall glitter on thy Shrine of Shrines. “But, ha!—she sinks—that look so wild— “Those livid lips—my child, my child, “This life of blood befits not thee, “And thou must back to Araby. “Ne'er had I risk'd thy timid sex “In scenes that man himself might dread, “Had I not hop'd our every tread “Would be on prostrate Persian necks— “Curst race, they offer swords instead! “But cheer thee, maid,—the wind that now “Is blowing o'er thy feverish brow, “To-day shall waft thee from the shore; “And, e'er a drop of this night's gore “Have time to chill in yonder towers, “Thou'lt see thy own sweet Arab bowers!” His bloody boast was all too true; There lurk'd one wretch among the few Whom Hafed's eagle eye could count Around him on that Fiery Mount,— One miscreant, who for gold betray'd The pathway through the valley's shade To those high towers, where Freedom stood In her last hold of flame and blood. Left on the field last dreadful night, When, sallying from their Sacred height, The Ghebers fought hope's farewell fight, He lay—but died not with the brave; That sun, which should have gilt his grave, Saw him a traitor and a slave;— And, while the few, who thence return'd To their high rocky fortress, mourn'd For him among the matchless dead They left behind on glory's bed, He liv'd, and, in the face of morn, Laugh'd them and Faith and Heaven to scorn. Oh for a tongue to curse the slave, Whose treason, like a deadly blight, Comes o'er the councils of the brave, And blasts them in their hour of might! May Life's unblessed cup for him Be drugg'd with treacheries to the brim,— With hopes, that but allure to fly, With joys, that vanish while he sips, Like Dead-Sea fruits, that tempt the eye, But turn to ashes on the lips! “They say that there are apple-trees upon the sides of this sea, which bear very lovely fruit, but within are all full of ashes.” —Thevenot. The same is asserted of the oranges there; v. Witman's Travels in Asiatic Turkey. “The Asphalt Lake, known by the name of the Dead Sea, is very remarkable on account of the considerable proportion of salt which it contains. In this respect it surpasses every other known water on the surface of the earth. This great proportion of bitter tasted salts is the reason why neither animal nor plant can live in this water.”—Klaproth's Chemical Analysis of the Water of the Dead Sea, Annals of Philosophy, January, 1813. Hasselquist, however, doubts the truth of this last assertion, as there are shell-fish to be found in the lake. Lord Byron has a similar allusion to the fruits of the Dead Sea, in that wonderful display of genius, his third Canto of Childe Harold,—magnificent beyond any thing, perhaps, that even he has ever written. His country's curse, his children's shame, Outcast of virtue, peace, and fame, May he, at last, with lips of flame On the parch'd desert thirsting die,— While lakes, that shone in mockery nigh “The Suhrab or Water of the Desert is said to be caused by the rarefaction of the atmosphere from extreme heat; and, which augments the delusion, it is most frequent in hollows, where water might be expected to lodge. I have seen bushes and trees reflected in it, with as much accuracy as though it had been the face of a clear and still lake.” —Pottinger. “As to the unbelievers, their works are like a vapour in a plain, which the thirsty traveller thinketh to be water, until when he cometh thereto he findeth it to be nothing.” —Koran, chap. 24., Are fading off, untouch'd, untasted, Like the once glorious hopes he blasted! And, when from earth his spirit flies, Just Prophet, let the damn'd-one dwell Full in the sight of Paradise, Beholding heaven, and feeling hell! The day is lowering—stilly black Sleeps the grim wave, while heaven's rack, Dispers'd and wild, 'twixt earth and sky Hangs like a shatter'd canopy. There's not a cloud in that blue plain But tells of storm to come or past;— Here, flying loosely as the mane Of a young war-horse in the blast;— There, roll'd in masses dark and swelling, As proud to be the thunder's dwelling! While some, already burst and riven, Seem melting down the verge of heaven; As though the infant storm had rent The mighty womb that gave him birth, And, having swept the firmament, Was now in fierce career for earth. On earth 'twas yet all calm around, A pulseless silence, dread, profound, More awful than the tempest's sound. The diver steer'd for Ormus' bowers, And moor'd his skiff till calmer hours; The sea-birds, with portentous screech, Flew fast to land;—upon the beach The pilot oft had paus'd, with glance Turn'd upward to that wild expanse;— And all was boding, drear, and dark As her own soul, when Hinda's bark Went slowly from the Persian shore.— No music tim'd her parting oar “The Easterns used to set out on their longer voyages with music.” —Harmer., Nor friends upon the lessening strand Linger'd, to wave the unseen hand, Or speak the farewell, heard no more;— But lone, unheeded, from the bay The vessel takes its mournful way, Like some ill-destin'd bark that steers In silence through the Gate of Tears. “The Gate of Tears, the straits or passage into the Red Sea, commonly called Babelmandel. It received this name from the old Arabians, on account of the danger of the navigation, and the number of shipwrecks by which it was distinguished; which induced them to consider as dead, and to wear mourning for all who had the boldness to hazard the passage through it into the Ethiopic ocean.” —Richardson. And where was stern Al Hassan then? Could not that saintly scourge of men From bloodshed and devotion spare One minute for a farewell there? No—close within, in changeful fits Of cursing and of prayer, he sits In savage loneliness to brood Upon the coming night of blood,— With that keen, second-scent of death, By which the vulture snuffs his food In the still warm and living breath! “I have been told that whensoever an animal falls down dead, one or more vultures, unseen before, instantly appear.” —Pennant. While o'er the wave his weeping daughter Is wafted from these scenes of slaughter,— As a young bird of Babylon “They fasten some writing to the wings of a Bagdat, or Babylonian pigeon.” —Travels of certain Englishmen., Let loose to tell of victory won, Flies home, with wing, ah! not unstain'd By the red hands that held her chain'd. And does the long-left home she seeks Light up no gladness on her cheeks? The flowers she nurs'd—the well-known groves, Where oft in dreams her spirit roves— Once more to see her dear gazelles Come bounding with their silver bells; Her birds' new plumage to behold, And the gay, gleaming fishes count, She left, all filleted with gold, Shooting around their jasper fount “The Empress of Jehan-Guire used to divert herself with feeding tame fish in her canals, some of which were many years afterwards known by fillets of gold, which she caused to be put round them.” —Harris.; Her little garden mosque to see, And once again, at evening hour, To tell her ruby rosary “Le Tespih, qui est un chapelet, composé de 99 petites boules d'agathe, de jaspe, d'ambre, de corail, ou d'autre matière precieuse. J'en ai vu un superbe au Seigneur Jerpos; il étoit de belles et grosses perles parfaites et égales, estimé trente mille piastres.” —Toderini. In her own sweet acacia bower.— Can these delights, that wait her now, Call up no sunshine on her brow? No,—silent, from her train apart,— As if even now she felt at heart The chill of her approaching doom,— She sits, all lovely in her gloom As a pale Angel of the Grave; And o'er the wide, tempestuous wave, Looks, with a shudder, to those towers, Where, in a few short awful hours, Blood, blood, in streaming tides shall run, Foul incense for to-morrow's sun! “Where art thou, glorious stranger! thou, “So lov'd, so lost, where art thou now? “Foe—Gheber—infidel—whate'er “The' unhallow'd name thou'rt doom'd to bear, “Still glorious—still to this fond heart “Dear as its blood, whate'er thou art! “Yes—Alla, dreadful Alla! yes— “If there be wrong, be crime in this, “Let the black waves that round us roll, “Whelm me this instant, ere my soul, “Forgetting faith—home—father—all— “Before its earthly idol fall, “Nor worship ev'n Thyself above him— “For, oh, so wildly do I love him, “Thy Paradise itself were dim “And joyless, if not shar'd with him!” Her hands were clasp'd—her eyes upturn'd, Dropping their tears like moonlight rain; And, though her lip, fond raver! burn'd With words of passion, bold, profane, Yet was there light around her brow, A holiness in those dark eyes, Which show'd,—though wandering earthward now,— Her spirit's home was in the skies. Yes—for a spirit pure as hers Is always pure, ev'n while it errs; As sunshine, broken in the rill, Though turn'd astray, is sunshine still! So wholly had her mind forgot All thoughts but one, she heeded not The rising storm—the wave that cast A moment's midnight, as it pass'd— Nor heard the frequent shout, the tread Of gathering tumult o'er her head— Clash'd swords, and tongues that seem'd to vie With the rude riot of the sky.— But, hark!—that war-whoop on the deck— That crash, as if each engine there, Mast, sails, and all, were gone to wreck, Mid yells and stampings of despair! Merciful Heaven! what can it be? 'Tis not the storm, though fearfully The ship has shudder'd as she rode O'er mountain-waves—“Forgive me, God! “Forgive me”—shriek'd the maid, and knelt, Trembling all over—for she felt As if her judgment-hour was near; While crouching round, half dead with fear, Her handmaids clung, nor breath'd, nor stirr'd— When, hark!—a second crash—a third— And now, as if a bolt of thunder Had riv'n the labouring planks asunder, The deck falls in—what horrors then! Blood, waves, and tackle, swords and men Come mix'd together through the chasm,— Some wretches in their dying spasm Still fighting on—and some that call “For God and Iran!” as they fall! Whose was the hand that turn'd away The perils of the' infuriate fray, And snatch'd her breathless from beneath This wilderment of wreck and death? She knew not—for a faintness came Chill o'er her, and her sinking frame Amid the ruins of that hour Lay, like a pale and scorched flower, Beneath the red volcano's shower. But, oh! the sights and sounds of dread That shock'd her ere her senses fled! The yawning deck—the crowd that strove Upon the tottering planks above— The sail, whose fragments, shivering o'er The strugglers' heads, all dash'd with gore Flutter'd like bloody flags—the clash Of sabres, and the lightning's flash Upon their blades, high toss'd about Like meteor brands The meteors that Pliny calls “faces.”—as if throughout The elements one fury ran, One general rage, that left a doubt Which was the fiercer, Heav'n or Man! Once too—but no—it could not be— 'Twas fancy all—yet once she thought, While yet her fading eyes could see, High on the ruin'd deck she caught A glimpse of that unearthly form, That glory of her soul,—even then, Amid the whirl of wreck and storm, Shining above his fellow-men, As, on some black and troublous night, The Star of Egypt “The brilliant Canopus, unseen in European climates.” —Brown., whose proud light Never hath beam'd on those who rest In the White Islands of the West See Wilford's learned Essays on the Sacred Isles in the West., Burns through the storm with looks of flame That put Heav'n's cloudier eyes to shame. But no—'twas but the minute's dream— A fantasy—and ere the scream Had half-way pass'd her pallid lips, A death-like swoon, a chill eclipse Of soul and sense its darkness spread Around her, and she sunk, as dead. How calm, how beautiful comes on The stilly hour, when storms are gone; When warring winds have died away, And clouds, beneath the glancing ray, Melt off, and leave the land and sea Sleeping in bright tranquillity,— Fresh as if Day again were born, Again upon the lap of Morn!— When the light blossoms, rudely torn And scatter'd at the whirlwind's will, Hang floating in the pure air still, Filling it all with precious balm, In gratitude for this sweet calm;— And every drop the thunder-showers Have left upon the grass and flowers Sparkles, as 'twere that lightning-gem A precious stone of the Indies, called by the ancients, Ceraunium, because it was supposed to be found in places where thunder had fallen. Tertullian says it has a glittering appearance, as if there had been fire in it; and the author of the Dissertation in Harris's Voyages, supposes it to be the opal. Whose liquid flame is born of them! When, 'stead of one unchanging breeze, There blow a thousand gentle airs, And each a different perfume bears,— As if the loveliest plants and trees Had vassal breezes of their own To watch and wait on them alone, And waft no other breath than theirs: When the blue waters rise and fall, In sleepy sunshine mantling all; And ev'n that swell the tempest leaves Is like the full and silent heaves Of lovers' hearts, when newly blest, Too newly to be quite at rest. Such was the golden hour that broke Upon the world, when Hinda woke From her long trance, and heard around No motion but the water's sound Rippling against the vessel's side, As slow it mounted o'er the tide.— But where is she?—her eyes are dark, Are wilder'd still—is this the bark, The same, that from Harmozia's bay Bore her at morn—whose bloody way The sea-dog track'd?—no—strange and new Is all that meets her wondering view. Upon a galliot's deck she lies, Beneath no rich pavilion's shade,— No plumes to fan her sleeping eyes, Nor jasmine on her pillow laid. But the rude litter, roughly spread With war-cloaks, is her homely bed, And shawl and sash, on javelins hung, For awning o'er her head are flung. Shuddering she look'd around—there lay A group of warriors in the sun, Resting their limbs, as for that day Their ministry of death were done. Some gazing on the drowsy sea, Lost in unconscious reverie; And some, who seem'd but ill to brook That sluggish calm, with many a look To the slack sail impatient cast, As loose it flagg'd around the mast. Blest Alla! who shall save her now? There's not in all that warrior band One Arab sword, one turban'd brow From her own Faithful Moslem land. Their garb—the leathern belt D'Herbelot, art. Agduani. that wraps Each yellow vest “The Guebres are known by a dark yellow colour, which the men affect in their clothes.” —Thevenot.—that rebel hue— The Tartar fleece upon their caps “The Kolah, or cap, worn by the Persians, is made of the skin of the sheep of Tartary.” —Waring.— Yes—yes—her fears are all too true, And Heav'n hath, in this dreadful hour, Abandon'd her to Hafed's power;— Hafed, the Gheber!—at the thought Her very heart's blood chills within; He, whom her soul was hourly taught To loathe, as some foul fiend of sin, Some minister, whom Hell had sent To spread its blast, where'er he went, And fling, as o'er our earth he trod, His shadow betwixt man and God! And she is now his captive,—thrown In his fierce hands, alive, alone; His the infuriate band she sees, All infidels—all enemies! What was the daring hope that then Cross'd her like light'ning, as again, With boldness that despair had lent, She darted through that armed crowd A look so searching, so intent, That ev'n the sternest warrior bow'd Abash'd, when he her glances caught, As if he guess'd whose form they sought. But no—she sees him not—'tis gone, The vision that before her shone Through all the maze of blood and storm, Is fled—'twas but a phantom form— One of those passing, rainbow dreams, Half light, half shade, which Fancy's beams Paint on the fleeting mists that roll In trance or slumber round the soul. But now the bark, with livelier bound, Scales the blue wave—the crew's in motion, The oars are out, and with light sound Break the bright mirror of the ocean, Scattering its brilliant fragments round. And now she sees—with horror sees, Their course is tow'rd that mountain-hold,— Those towers, that make her life-blood freeze, Where Mecca's godless enemies Lie, like beleaguer'd scorpions, roll'd In their last deadly, venomous fold! Amid the' illumin'd land and flood Sunless that mighty mountain stood; Save where, above its awful head, There shone a flaming cloud, blood-red, As 'twere the flag of destiny Hung out to mark where death would be! Had her bewilder'd mind the power Of thought in this terrific hour, She well might marvel where or how Man's foot could scale that mountain's brow, Since ne'er had Arab heard or known Of path but through the glen alone.— But every thought was lost in fear, When, as their bounding bark drew near The craggy base, she felt the waves Hurry them tow'rd those dismal caves, That from the Deep in windings pass Beneath that Mount's volcanic mass;— And loud a voice on deck commands To lower the mast and light the brands!— Instantly o'er the dashing tide Within a cavern's mouth they glide, Gloomy as that eternal Porch Through which departed spirits go:— Not ev'n the flare of brand and torch Its flickering light could further throw Than the thick flood that boil'd below. Silent they floated—as if each Sat breathless, and too aw'd for speech In that dark chasm, where even sound Seem'd dark,—so sullenly around The goblin echoes of the cave Mutter'd it o'er the long black wave, As 'twere some secret of the grave! But soft—they pause—the current turns Beneath them from its onward track;— Some mighty, unseen barrier spurns The vexed tide, all foaming, back, And scarce the oars' redoubled force Can stem the eddy's whirling force; When, hark!—some desperate foot has sprung Among the rocks—the chain is flung— The oars are up—the grapple clings, And the toss'd bark in moorings swings. Just then, a day-beam through the shade Broke tremulous—but, ere the maid Can see from whence the brightness steals, Upon her brow she shuddering feels A viewless hand, that promptly ties A bandage round her burning eyes; While the rude litter where she lies, Uplifted by the warrior throng, O'er the steep rocks is borne along. Blest power of sunshine!—genial Day, What balm, what life is in thy ray! To feel thee is such real bliss, That had the world no joy but this, To sit in sunshine calm and sweet,— It were a world too exquisite For man to leave it for the gloom, The deep, cold shadow of the tomb. Ev'n Hinda, though she saw not where Or whither wound the perilous road, Yet knew by that awakening air, Which suddenly around her glow'd, That they had risen from darkness then, And breath'd the sunny world again! But soon this balmy freshness fled— For now the steepy labyrinth led Through damp and gloom—'mid crash of boughs, And fall of loosen'd crags that rouse The leopard from his hungry sleep, Who, starting, thinks each crag a prey, And long is heard, from steep to steep, Chasing them down their thundering way! The jackal's cry—the distant moan Of the hyæna, fierce and lone— And that eternal saddening sound Of torrents in the glen beneath, As 'twere the ever-dark Profound That rolls beneath the Bridge of Death! All, all is fearful—ev'n to see, To gaze on those terrific things She now but blindly hears, would be Relief to her imaginings; Since never yet was shape so dread, But Fancy, thus in darkness thrown, And by such sounds of horror fed, Could frame more dreadful of her own. But does she dream? has Fear again Perplex'd the workings of her brain, Or did a voice, all music, then Come from the gloom, low whispering near— “Tremble not, love, thy Gheber's here?” She does not dream—all sense, all ear, She drinks the words, “Thy Gheber's here.” 'Twas his own voice—she could not err— Throughout the breathing world's extent There was but one such voice for her, So kind, so soft, so eloquent! Oh, sooner shall the rose of May Mistake her own sweet nightingale, And to some meaner minstrel's lay Open her bosom's glowing veil A frequent image among the oriental poets. “The nightingales warbled their enchanting notes, and rent the thin veils of the rose-bud and the rose.” —Jami., Than Love shall ever doubt a tone, A breath of the belovëd one! Though blest, 'mid all her ills, to think She has that one beloved near, Whose smile, though met on ruin's brink, Hath power to make ev'n ruin dear,— Yet soon this gleam of rapture, crost By fears for him, is chill'd and lost. How shall the ruthless Hafed brook That one of Gheber blood should look, With aught but curses in his eye, On her—a maid of Araby— A Moslem maid—the child of him, Whose bloody banner's dire success Hath left their altars cold and dim, And their fair land a wilderness! And, worse than all, that night of blood Which comes so fast—Oh! who shall stay The sword, that once hath tasted food Of Persian hearts, or turn its way? What arm shall then the victim cover, Or from her father shield her lover? “Save him, my God!” she inly cries— “Save him this night—and if thine eyes “Have ever welcom'd with delight “The sinner's tears, the sacrifice “Of sinners' hearts—guard him this night, “And here, before thy throne, I swear “From my heart's inmost core to tear “Love, hope, remembrance, though they be “Link'd with each quivering life-string there, “And give it bleeding all to Thee! “Let him but live,—the burning tear, “The sighs, so sinful, yet so dear, “Which have been all too much his own, “Shall from this hour be Heaven's alone. “Youth pass'd in penitence, and age “In long and painful pilgrimage, “Shall leave no traces of the flame “That wastes me now—nor shall his name “Ere bless my lips, but when I pray “For his dear spirit, that away “Casting from its angelic ray “The' eclipse of earth, he, too, may shine “Redeem'd, all glorious and all Thine! “Think—think what victory to win “One radiant soul like his from sin,— “One wandering star of virtue back “To its own native, heaven-ward track! “Let him but live, and both are Thine, “Together thine—for, blest or crost, “Living or dead, his doom is mine, “And, if he perish, both are lost!” To tearless eyes and hearts at ease The leafy shores and sun-bright seas, That lay beneath that mountain's height, Had been a fair enchanting sight. 'Twas one of those ambrosial eves A day of storm so often leaves At its calm setting—when the West Opens her golden bowers of rest, And a moist radiance from the skies Shoots trembling down, as from the eyes Of some meek penitent, whose last, Bright hours atone for dark ones past, And whose sweet tears, o'er wrong forgiven, Shine, as they fall, with light from heaven! 'Twas stillness all—the winds that late Had rush'd through Kerman's almond groves, And shaken from her bowers of date That cooling feast the traveller loves “In parts of Kerman, whatever dates are shaken from the trees by the wind they do not touch, but leave them for those who have not any, or for travellers.” —Ebn Haukal., Now, lull'd to languor, scarcely curl The Green Sea wave, whose waters gleam Limpid, as if her mines of pearl Were melted all to form the stream: And her fair islets, small and bright, With their green shores reflected there, Look like those Peri isles of light, That hang by spell-work in the air. But vainly did those glories burst On Hinda's dazzled eyes, when first The bandage from her brow was taken, And, pale and aw'd as those who waken In their dark tombs—when, scowling near, The Searchers of the Grave The two terrible angels, Monkir and Nakir, who are called “the Searchers of the Grave” in the “Creed of the orthodox Mahometans” given by Ockley, vol. ii. appear,— She shuddering turn'd to read her fate In the fierce eyes that flash'd around; And saw those towers all desolate, That o'er her head terrific frown'd, As if defying ev'n the smile Of that soft heaven to gild their pile. In vain with mingled hope and fear, She looks for him whose voice so dear Had come, like music, to her ear— Strange, mocking dream! again 'tis fled. And oh, the shoots, the pangs of dread That through her inmost bosom run, When voices from without proclaim “Hafed, the Chief”—and, one by one, The warriors shout that fearful name! He comes—the rock resounds his tread— How shall she dare to lift her head, Or meet those eyes whose scorching glare Not Yemen's boldest sons can bear? In whose red beam, the Moslem tells, Such rank and deadly lustre dwells, As in those hellish fires that light The mandrake's charnel leaves at night. “The Arabians call the mandrake ‘the Devil's candle,’ on account of its shining appearance in the night.” —Richardson. How shall she bear that voice's tone, At whose loud battle-cry alone Whole squadrons oft in panic ran, Scatter'd like some vast caravan, When, stretch'd at evening round the well, They hear the thirsting tiger's yell. Breathless she stands, with eyes cast down, Shrinking beneath the fiery frown, Which, fancy tells her, from that brow Is flashing o'er her fiercely now: And shuddering as she hears the tread Of his retiring warrior band.— Never was pause so full of dread; Till Hafed with a trembling hand Took hers, and, leaning o'er her, said, “Hinda;”—that word was all he spoke, And 'twas enough—the shriek that broke From her full bosom, told the rest.— Panting with terror, joy, surprise, The maid but lifts her wondering eyes, To hide them on her Gheber's breast! 'Tis he, 'tis he—the man of blood, The fellest of the Fire-fiend's brood, Hafed, the demon of the fight, Whose voice unnerves, whose glances blight,— Is her own loved Gheber, mild And glorious as when first he smil'd In her lone tower, and left such beams Of his pure eye to light her dreams, That she believ'd her bower had given Rest to some wanderer from heaven! Moments there are, and this was one, Snatch'd like a minute's gleam of sun Amid the black Simoom's eclipse— Or, like those verdant spots that bloom Around the crater's burning lips, Sweetening the very edge of doom! The past—the future—all that Fate Can bring of dark or desperate Around such hours, but makes them cast Intenser radiance while they last! Ev'n he, this youth—though dimm'd and gone Each star of Hope that cheer'd him on— His glories lost—his cause betray'd— Iran, his dear-lov'd country, made A land of carcasses and slaves, One dreary waste of chains and graves!— Himself but lingering, dead at heart, To see the last, long struggling breath Of Liberty's great soul depart, Then lay him down and share her death— Ev'n he, so sunk in wretchedness, With doom still darker gathering o'er him, Yet, in this moment's pure caress, In the mild eyes that shone before him, Beaming that blest assurance, worth All other transports known on earth, That he was lov'd—well, warmly lov'd— Oh! in this precious hour he prov'd How deep, how thorough-felt the glow Of rapture, kindling out of woe;— How exquisite one single drop Of bliss, thus sparkling to the top Of misery's cup—how keenly quaff'd, Though death must follow on the draught! She, too, while gazing on those eyes That sink into her soul so deep, Forgets all fears, all miseries, Or feels them like the wretch in sleep, Whom fancy cheats into a smile, Who dreams of joy, and sobs the while! The mighty Ruins where they stood, Upon the mount's high, rocky verge, Lay open tow'rds the ocean flood, Where lightly o'er the illumin'd surge Many a fair bark that, all the day, Had lurk'd in sheltering creek or bay Now bounded on, and gave their sails, Yet dripping, to the evening gales; Like eagles, when the storm is done, Spreading their wet wings in the sun. The beauteous clouds, though daylight's Star Had sunk behind the hills of Lar, Were still with lingering glories bright,— As if, to grace the gorgeous West, The Spirit of departing Light That eve had left his sunny vest Behind him, ere he wing'd his flight. Never was scene so form'd for love! Beneath them waves of crystal move In silent swell—Heav'n glows above, And their pure hearts, to transport given, Swell like the wave, and glow like Heav'n. But ah! too soon that dream is past— Again, again her fear returns;— Night, dreadful night, is gathering fast, More faintly the horizon burns, And every rosy tint that lay On the smooth sea hath died away. Hastily to the darkening skies A glance she casts—then wildly cries “At night, he said—and, look, 'tis near— “Fly, fly—if yet thou lov'st me, fly— “Soon will his murderous band be here, “And I shall see thee bleed and die.— “Hush! heard'st thou not the tramp of men “Sounding from yonder fearful glen?— “Perhaps ev'n now they climb the wood— “Fly, fly—though still the West is bright, “He'll come—oh! yes—he wants thy blood— “I know him—he'll not wait for night!” In terrors ev'n to agony She clings around the wondering Chief;— “Alas, poor wilder'd maid! to me “Thou ow'st this raving trance of grief. “Lost as I am, nought ever grew “Beneath my shade but perish'd too— “My doom is like the Dead Sea air, “And nothing lives that enters there! “Why were our barks together driven “Beneath this morning's furious heaven? “Why, when I saw the prize that chance “Had thrown into my desperate arms,— “When, casting but a single glance “Upon thy pale and prostrate charms, “I vow'd (though watching viewless o'er “Thy safety through that hour's alarms) “To meet the' unmanning sight no more— “Why have I broke that heart-wrung vow? “Why weakly, madly met thee now?— “Start not—that noise is but the shock “Of torrents through yon valley hurl'd— “Dread nothing here—upon this rock “We stand above the jarring world, “Alike beyond its hope—its dread— “In gloomy safety, like the Dead! “Or, could ev'n earth and hell unite “In league to storm this Sacred Height, “Fear nothing thou—myself, to-night, “And each o'erlooking star that dwells “Near God will be thy sentinels;— “And, ere to-morrow's dawn shall glow, “Back to thy sire—” “To-morrow!—no—” The maiden scream'd—“thou'lt never see “To-morrow's sun—death, death will be “The night-cry through each reeking tower, “Unless we fly, ay, fly this hour! “Thou art betray'd—some wretch who knew “That dreadful glen's mysterious clew— “Nay, doubt not—by yon stars, 'tis true— “Hath sold thee to my vengeful sire; “This morning, with that smile so dire “He wears in joy, he told me all, “And stamp'd in triumph through our hall, “As though thy heart already beat “Its last life-throb beneath his feet! “Good Heav'n, how little dream'd I then “His victim was my own lov'd youth!— “Fly—send—let some one watch the glen— “By all my hopes of heaven 'tis truth!” Oh! colder than the wind that freezes Founts, that but now in sunshine play'd, Is that congealing pang which seizes The trusting bosom, when betray'd. He felt it—deeply felt—and stood, As if the tale had froz'n his blood, So maz'd and motionless was he;— Like one whom sudden spells enchant, Or some mute, marble habitant Of the still Halls of Ishmonie! For an account of Ishmonie, the petrified city in Upper Egypt, where it is said there are many statues of men, women, &amp;c. to be seen to this day, see Perry's View of the Levant. But soon the painful chill was o'er, And his great soul, herself once more, Look'd from his brow in all the rays Of her best, happiest, grandest days. Never, in moment most elate, Did that high spirit loftier rise;— While bright, serene, determinate, His looks are lifted to the skies, As if the signal lights of Fate Were shining in those awful eyes! 'Tis come—his hour of martyrdom In Iran's sacred cause is come; And, though his life hath pass'd away Like lightning on a stormy day, Yet shall his death-hour leave a track Of glory, permanent and bright, To which the brave of after-times, The suffering brave, shall long look back With proud regret,—and by its light Watch through the hours of slavery's night For vengeance on the' oppressor's crimes. This rock, his monument aloft, Shall speak the tale to many an age; And hither bards and heroes oft Shall come in secret pilgrimage, And bring their warrior sons, and tell The wondering boys where Hafed fell; And swear them on those lone remains Of their lost country's ancient fanes, Never—while breath of life shall live Within them—never to forgive The' accursed race, whose ruthless chain Hath left on Iran's neck a stain Blood, blood alone can cleanse again! Such are the swelling thoughts that now Enthrone themselves on Hafed's brow; And ne'er did Saint of Issa Jesus. gaze On the red wreath, for martyrs twin'd, More proudly than the youth surveys That pile, which through the gloom behind, Half lighted by the altar's fire, Glimmers—his destin'd funeral pyre! Heap'd by his own, his comrades' hands, Of every wood of odorous breath, There, by the Fire-God's shrine it stands, Ready to fold in radiant death The few still left of those who swore To perish there, when hope was o'er— The few, to whom that couch of flame, Which rescues them from bonds and shame, Is sweet and welcome as the bed For their own infant Prophet spread, When pitying Heav'n to roses turn'd The death-flames that beneath him burn'd! The Ghebers say that when Abraham, their great Prophet, was thrown into the fire by order of Nimrod, the flame turned instantly into “a bed of roses, where the child sweetly reposed.” —Tavernier. Of their other Prophet, Zoroaster, there is a story told in Dion Prusæus, Orat. 36., that the love of wisdom and virtue leading him to a solitary life upon a mountain, he found it one day all in a flame, shining with celestial fire, out of which he came without any harm, and instituted certain sacrifices to God, who, he declared, then appeared to him. —v. Patrick on Exodus, iii. 2. With watchfulness the maid attends His rapid glance, where'er it bends— Why shoot his eyes such awful beams? What plans he now? what thinks or dreams? Alas! why stands he musing here, When every moment teems with fear? “Hafed, my own beloved Lord,” She kneeling cries—“first, last ador'd! “If in that soul thou'st ever felt “Half what thy lips impassion'd swore, “Here, on my knees that never knelt “To any but their God before, “I pray thee, as thou lov'st me, fly— “Now, now—ere yet their blades are nigh. “Oh haste—the bark that bore me hither “Can waft us o'er yon darkening sea “East—west—alas, I care not whither, “So thou art safe, and I with thee! “Go where we will, this hand in thine, “Those eyes before me smiling thus, “Through good and ill, through storm and shine, “The world's a world of love for us! “On some calm, blessed shore we'll dwell, “Where 'tis no crime to love too well;— “Where thus to worship tenderly “An erring child of light like thee “Will not be sin—or, if it be, “Where we may weep our faults away, “Together kneeling, night and day, “Thou, for my sake, at Alla's shrine, “And I—at any God's, for thine!” Wildly these passionate words she spoke— Then hung her head, and wept for shame; Sobbing, as if a heart-string broke With every deep-heav'd sob that came. While he, young, warm—oh! wonder not If, for a moment, pride and fame, His oath—his cause—that shrine of flame, And Iran's self are all forgot For her whom at his feet he sees Kneeling in speechless agonies. No, blame him not, if Hope awhile Dawn'd in his soul, and threw her smile O'er hours to come—o'er days and nights, Wing'd with those precious, pure delights Which she, who bends all beauteous there, Was born to kindle and to share. A tear or two, which, as he bow'd To raise the suppliant, trembling stole, First warn'd him of this dangerous cloud Of softness passing o'er his soul. Starting, he brush'd the drops away, Unworthy o'er that cheek to stray;— Like one who, on the morn of fight, Shakes from his sword the dews of night, That had but dimm'd, not stain'd its light. Yet, though subdued the' unnerving thrill, Its warmth, its weakness linger'd still So touching in each look and tone, That the fond, fearing, hoping maid Half counted on the flight she pray'd, Half thought the hero's soul was grown As soft, as yielding as her own, And smil'd and bless'd him, while he said,— “Yes—if there be some happier sphere, “Where fadeless truth like ours is dear,— “If there be any land of rest “For those who love and ne'er forget, “Oh! comfort thee—for safe and blest “We'll meet in that calm region yet!” Scarce had she time to ask her heart If good or ill these words impart, When the rous'd youth impatient flew To the tower-wall, where, high in view, A ponderous sea-horn “The shell called Siiankos, common to India, Africa, and the Mediterranean, and still used in many parts as a trumpet for blowing alarms or giving signals: it sends forth a deep and hollow sound.” —Pennant. hung, and blew A signal, deep and dread as those The storm-fiend at his rising blows.— Full well his Chieftains, sworn and true Through life and death, that signal knew; For 'twas the' appointed warning-blast, The' alarm, to tell when hope was past, And the tremendous death-die cast! And there, upon the mouldering tower, Hath hung this sea-horn many an hour, Ready to sound o'er land and sea That dirge-note of the brave and free. They came—his Chieftains at the call Came slowly round, and with them all— Alas, how few!—the worn remains Of those who late o'er Kerman's plains Went gaily prancing to the clash Of Moorish zel and tymbalon, Catching new hope from every flash Of their long lances in the sun, And, as their coursers charg'd the wind, And the white ox-tails stream'd behind “The finest ornament for the horses is made of six large flying tassels of long white hair, taken out of the tails of wild oxen, that are to be found in some places of the Indies.” —Thevenot., Looking, as if the steeds they rode Were wing'd, and every Chief a God! How fall'n, how alter'd now! how wan Each scarr'd and faded visage shone, As round the burning shrine they came;— How deadly was the glare it cast, As mute they paus'd before the flame To light their torches as they pass'd! 'Twas silence all—the youth hath plann'd The duties of his soldier-band; And each determin'd brow declares His faithful Chieftains well know theirs. But minutes speed—night gems the skies— And oh, how soon, ye blessed eyes, That look from heaven, ye may behold Sights that will turn your star-fires cold! Breathless with awe, impatience, hope, The maiden sees the veteran group Her litter silently prepare, And lay it at her trembling feet;— And now the youth, with gentle care, Hath plac'd her in the shelter'd seat, And press'd her hand—that lingering press Of hands, that for the last time sever; Of hearts, whose pulse of happiness, When that hold breaks, is dead for ever. And yet to her this sad caress Gives hope—so fondly hope can err! 'Twas joy, she thought, joy's mute excess— Their happy flight's dear harbinger; 'Twas warmth—assurance—tenderness— 'Twas any thing but leaving her. “Haste, haste!” she cried, “the clouds grow dark, “But still, ere night, we'll reach the bark; “And by to-morrow's dawn—oh bliss! “With thee upon the sun-bright deep, “Far off, I'll but remember this, “As some dark vanish'd dream of sleep; “And thou—” but ah!—he answers not— Good Heavn'!—and does she go alone? She now has reach'd that dismal spot, Where, some hours since, his voice's tone Had come to soothe her fears and ills, Sweet as the angel Israfil's “The angel Israfil, who has the most melodious voice of all God's creatures.” —Sale., When every leaf on Eden's tree Is trembling to his minstrelsy— Yet now—oh, now, he is not nigh.— “Hafed! my Hafed!—if it be “Thy will, thy doom this night to die, “Let me but stay to die with thee, “And I will bless thy loved name, “Till the last life-breath leave this frame. “Oh! let our lips, our cheeks be laid “But near each other while they fade; “Let us but mix our parting breaths, “And I can die ten thousand deaths! “You too, who hurry me away “So cruelly, one moment stay— “Oh! stay—one moment is not much— “He yet may come—for him I pray— “Hafed! dear Hafed!—” all the way In wild lamentings, that would touch A heart of stone, she shriek'd his name To the dark woods—no Hafed came:— No—hapless pair—you've look'd your last:— Your hearts should both have broken then: The dream is o'er—your doom is cast— You'll never meet on earth again! Alas for him, who hears her cries! Still half-way down the steep he stands, Watching with fix'd and feverish eyes The glimmer of those burning brands, That down the rocks, with mournful ray, Light all he loves on earth away! Hopeless as they who, far at sea, By the cold moon have just consign'd The corse of one, lov'd tenderly, To the bleak flood they leave behind; And on the deck still lingering stay, And long look back, with sad delay, To watch the moonlight on the wave, That ripples o'er that cheerless grave. But see—he starts—what heard he then? That dreadful shout!—across the glen From the land-side it comes, and loud Rings through the chasm; as if the crowd Of fearful things, that haunt that dell, Its Gholes and Dives and shapes of hell, Had all in one dread howl broke out, So loud, so terrible that shout! “They come—the Moslems come!”—he cries, His proud soul mounting to his eyes,— “Now, Spirits of the Brave, who roam “Enfranchis'd through yon starry dome, “Rejoice—for souls of kindred fire “Are on the wing to join your choir!” He said—and, light as bridegrooms bound To their young loves, reclimb'd the steep And gain'd the Shrine—his Chiefs stood round— Their swords, as with instinctive leap, Together, at that cry accurst, Had from their sheaths, like sunbeams, burst. And hark!—again—again it rings; Near and more near its echoings Peal through the chasm—oh! who that then Had seen those listening warrior-men, With their swords grasp'd, their eyes of flame Turn'd on their Chief—could doubt the shame, The' indignant shame with which they thrill To hear those shouts and yet stand still? He read their thoughts—they were his own— “What! while our arms can wield these blades, “Shall we die tamely? die alone? “Without one victim to our shades, “One Moslem heart, where, buried deep, “The sabre from its toil may sleep? “No—God of Iran's burning skies! “Thou scorn'st the' inglorious sacrifice. “No—though of all earth's hope bereft, “Life, swords, and vengeance still are left. “We'll make yon valley's reeking caves “Live in the awe-struck minds of men, “Till tyrants shudder, when their slaves “Tell of the Gheber's bloody glen. “Follow, brave hearts!—this pile remains “Our refuge still from life and chains; “But his the best, the holiest bed, “Who sinks entomb'd in Moslem dead!” Down the precipitous rocks they sprung, While vigour, more than human, strung Each arm and heart.—The' exulting foe Still through the dark defiles below, Track'd by his torches' lurid fire, Wound slow, as through Golconda's vale See Hoole upon the Story of Sinbad. The mighty serpent, in his ire, Glides on with glittering, deadly trail. No torch the Ghebers need—so well They know each mystery of the dell, So oft have, in their wanderings, Cross'd the wild race that round them dwell, The very tigers from their delves Look out, and let them pass, as things Untam'd and fearless like themselves! There was a deep ravine, that lay Yet darkling in the Moslem's way; Fit spot to make invaders rue The many fall'n before the few. The torrents from that morning's sky Had fill'd the narrow chasm breast-high, And, on each side, aloft and wild, Huge cliffs and toppling crags were pil'd,— The guards with which young Freedom lines The pathways to her mountain-shrines. Here, at this pass, the scanty band Of Iran's last avengers stand; Here wait, in silence like the dead, And listen for the Moslem's tread So anxiously, the carrion-bird Above them flaps his wing unheard! They come—that plunge into the water Gives signal for the work of slaughter. Now, Ghebers, now—if e'er your blades Had point or prowess, prove them now— Woe to the file that foremost wades! They come—a falchion greets each brow, And, as they tumble, trunk on trunk, Beneath the gory waters sunk, Still o'er their drowning bodies press New victims quick and numberless; Till scarce an arm in Hafed's band, So fierce their toil, hath power to stir, But listless from each crimson hand The sword hangs, clogg'd with massacre. Never was horde of tyrants met With bloodier welcome—never yet To patriot vengeance hath the sword More terrible libations pour'd! All up the dreary, long ravine, By the red, murky glimmer seen Of half-quench'd brands, that o'er the flood Lie scatter'd round and burn in blood, What ruin glares! what carnage swims! Heads, blazing turbans, quivering limbs, Lost swords that, dropp'd from many a hand, In that thick pool of slaughter stand;— Wretches who wading, half on fire From the toss'd brands that round them fly, 'Twixt flood and flame in shrieks expire;— And some who, grasp'd by those that die, Sink woundless with them, smother'd o'er In their dead brethren's gushing gore! But vainly hundreds, thousands bleed, Still hundreds, thousands more succeed; Countless as tow'rds some flame at night The North's dark insects wing their flight, And quench or perish in its light, To this terrific spot they pour— Till, bridg'd with Moslem bodies o'er, It bears aloft their slippery tread, And o'er the dying and the dead, Tremendous causeway! on they pass. Then, hapless Ghebers, then, alas, What hope was left for you? for you, Whose yet warm pile of sacrifice Is smoking in their vengeful eyes;— Whose swords how keen, how fierce they knew, And burn with shame to find how few. Crush'd down by that vast multitude, Some found their graves where first they stood; While some with hardier struggle died, And still fought on by Hafed's side, Who, fronting to the foe, trod back Tow'rds the high towers his gory track; And, as a lion swept away By sudden swell of Jordan's pride From the wild covert where he lay “In this thicket upon the banks of the Jordan several sorts of wild beasts are wont to harbour themselves, whose being washed out of the covert by the overflowings of the river, gave occasion to that allusion of Jeremiah, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan.” —Maundrell's Aleppo., Long battles with the' o'erwhelming tide, So fought he back with fierce delay, And kept both foes and fate at bay. But whither now? their track is lost, Their prey escap'd—guide, torches gone— By torrent-beds and labyrinths crost, The scatter'd crowd rush blindly on— “Curse on those tardy lights that wind,” They panting cry, “so far behind; “Oh for a bloodhound's precious scent, “To track the way the Gheber went!” Vain wish—confusedly along They rush, more desperate as more wrong: Till, wilder'd by the far-off lights, Yet glittering up those gloomy heights, Their footing, maz'd and lost, they miss, And down the darkling precipice Are dash'd into the deep abyss; Or midway hang, impal'd on rocks, A banquet, yet alive, for flocks Of ravening vultures,—while the dell Re-echoes with each horrible yell. Those sounds—the last, to vengeance dear, That e'er shall ring in Hafed's ear,— Now reach'd him, as aloft, alone, Upon the steep way breathless thrown, He lay beside his reeking blade, Resign'd, as if life's task were o'er, Its last blood-offering amply paid, And Iran's self could claim no more. One only thought, one lingering beam Now broke across his dizzy dream Of pain and weariness—'twas she, His heart's pure planet, shining yet Above the waste of memory, When all life's other lights were set. And never to his mind before Her image such enchantment wore. It seem'd as if each thought that stain'd, Each fear that chill'd their loves was past, And not one cloud of earth remain'd Between him and her radiance cast;— As if to charms, before so bright, New grace from other worlds was given, And his soul saw her by the light Now breaking o'er itself from heaven! A voice spoke near him—'twas the tone Of a lov'd friend, the only one Of all his warriors, left with life From that short night's tremendous strife.— “And must we then, my chief, die here? “Foes round us, and the Shrine so near!” These words have rous'd the last remains Of life within him—“what! not yet “Beyond the reach of Moslem chains!” The thought could make ev'n Death forget His icy bondage—with a bound He springs, all bleeding, from the ground, And grasps his comrade's arm, now grown Ev'n feebler, heavier than his own, And up the painful pathway leads, Death gaining on each step he treads. Speed them, thou God, who heard'st their vow! They mount—they bleed—oh save them now— The crags are red they've clamber'd o'er, The rock-weed's dripping with their gore;— Thy blade too, Hafed, false at length, Now breaks beneath thy tottering strength! Haste, haste—the voices of the Foe Come near and nearer from below— One effort more—thank Heav'n! 'tis past, They've gain'd the topmost steep at last. And now they touch the temple's walls, Now Hafed sees the Fire divine— When, lo!—his weak, worn comrade falls Dead on the threshold of the shrine. “Alas, brave soul, too quickly fled! “And must I leave thee withering here, “The sport of every ruffian's tread, “The mark for every coward's spear? “No, by yon altar's sacred beams!” He cries, and, with a strength that seems Not of this world, uplifts the frame Of the fall'n Chief, and tow'rds the flame Bears him along;—with death-damp hand The corpse upon the pyre he lays, Then lights the consecrated brand, And fires the pile, whose sudden blaze Like lightning bursts o'er Oman's Sea.— “Now, Freedom's God! I come to Thee,” The youth exclaims, and with a smile Of triumph vaulting on the pile, In that last effort, ere the fires Have harm'd one glorious limb, expires! What shriek was that on Oman's tide? It came from yonder drifting bark, That just hath caught upon her side The death-light—and again is dark. It is the boat—ah, why delay'd?— That bears the wretched Moslem maid; Confided to the watchful care Of a small veteran band, with whom Their generous Chieftain would not share The secret of his final doom, But hop'd when Hinda, safe and free, Was render'd to her father's eyes, Their pardon, full and prompt, would be The ransom of so dear a prize.— Unconscious, thus, of Hafed's fate, And proud to guard their beauteous freight, Scarce had they clear'd the surfy waves That foam around those frightful caves, When the curst war-whoops, known so well, Came echoing from the distant dell— Sudden each oar, upheld and still, Hung dripping o'er the vessel's side, And, driving at the current's will, They rock'd along the whispering tide; While every eye, in mute dismay, Was tow'rd that fatal mountain turn'd, Where the dim altar's quivering ray As yet all lone and tranquil burn'd. Oh! 'tis not, Hinda, in the power Of Fancy's most terrific touch To paint thy pangs in that dread hour— Thy silent agony—'twas such As those who feel could paint too well, But none e'er felt and liv'd to tell! 'Twas not alone the dreary state Of a lorn spirit, crush'd by fate, When, though no more remains to dread, The panic chill will not depart;— When, though the inmate Hope be dead, Her ghost still haunts the mouldering heart; No—pleasures, hopes, affections gone, The wretch may bear, and yet live on, Like things, within the cold rock found Alive, when all's congeal'd around. But there's a blank repose in this, A calm stagnation, that were bliss To the keen, burning, harrowing pain, Now felt through all thy breast and brain;— That spasm of terror, mute, intense, That breathless, agonis'd suspense, From whose hot throb, whose deadly aching, The heart hath no relief but breaking! Calm is the wave—heav'n's brilliant lights Reflected dance beneath the prow;— Time was when, on such lovely nights, She who is there, so desolate now, Could sit all cheerful, though alone, And ask no happier joy than seeing That star-light o'er the waters thrown— No joy but that, to make her blest, And the fresh, buoyant sense of Being, Which bounds in youth's yet careless breast,— Itself a star, not borrowing light, But in its own glad essence bright. How different now!—but, hark, again The yell of havoc rings—brave men! In vain, with beating hearts, ye stand On the bark's edge—in vain each hand Half draws the falchion from its sheath; All's o'er—in rust your blades may lie:— He, at whose word they've scatter'd death, Ev'n now, this night, himself must die! Well may ye look to yon dim tower, And ask, and wondering guess what means The battle-cry at this dead hour— Ah! she could tell you—she, who leans Unheeded there, pale, sunk, aghast, With brow against the dew-cold mast;— Too well she knows—her more than life, Her soul's first idol and its last, Lies bleeding in that murderous strife. But see—what moves upon the height? Some signal!—'tis a torch's light. What bodes its solitary glare? In gasping silence tow'rd the Shrine All eyes are turn'd—thine, Hinda, thine Fix their last fading life-beams there. 'Twas but a moment—fierce and high The death-pile blaz'd into the sky, And far away, o'er rock and flood Its melancholy radiance sent; While Hafed, like a vision stood Reveal'd before the burning pyre, Tall, shadowy, like a Spirit of Fire Shrin'd in its own grand element! “'Tis he!”—the shuddering maid exclaims,— But, while she speaks, he's seen no more; High burst in air the funeral flames, And Iran's hopes and hers are o'er! One wild, heart-broken shriek she gave; Then sprung, as if to reach that blaze, Where still she fix'd her dying gaze, And, gazing, sunk into the wave,— Deep, deep,—where never care or pain Shall reach her innocent heart again! Farewell—farewell to thee, Araby's daughter! (Thus warbled a Peri beneath the dark sea,) No pearl ever lay, under Oman's green water, More pure in its shell than thy Spirit in thee. Oh! fair as the sea-flower close to thee growing, How light was thy heart till Love's witchery came, Like the wind of the south “This wind (the Samoor) so softens the strings of lutes, that they can never be tuned while it lasts.” —Stephen's Persia. o'er a summer lute blowing, And hush'd all its music, and wither'd its frame! But long, upon Araby's green sunny highlands, Shall maids and their lovers remember the doom Of her, who lies sleeping among the Pearl Islands, With nought but the sea-star “One of the greatest curiosities found in the Persian Gulf is a fish which the English call Star-fish. It is circular, and at night very luminous, resembling the full moon surrounded by rays.” —Mirza Abu Taleb. to light up her tomb. And still, when the merry date-season is burning For a description of the merriment of the date-time, of their work, their dances, and their return home from the palm-groves at the end of autumn with the fruits, see Kempfer, Amœnitat. Exot., And calls to the palm-groves the young and the old, The happiest there, from their pastime returning At sunset, will weep when thy story is told. The young village-maid, when with flowers she dresses Her dark flowing hair for some festival day, Will think of thy fate till, neglecting her tresses, She mournfully turns from the mirror away. Nor shall Iran, beloved of her Hero! forget thee— Though tyrants watch over her tears as they start, Close, close by the side of that Hero she'll set thee, Embalm'd in the innermost shrine of her heart. Farewell—be it ours to embellish thy pillow With every thing beauteous that grows in the deep; Each flower of the rock and each gem of the billow Shall sweeten thy bed and illumine thy sleep. Around thee shall glisten the loveliest amber That ever the sorrowing sea-bird has wept Some naturalists have imagined that amber is a concretion of the tears of birds. —See Trevoux, Chambers.; With many a shell, in whose hollow-wreath'd chamber We, Peris of Ocean, by moonlight have slept. We'll dive where the gardens of coral lie darkling, And plant all the rosiest stems at thy head; We'll seek where the sands of the Caspian “The bay Kieselarke, which is otherwise called the Golden Bay, the sand whereof shines as fire.” —Struy. are sparkling, And gather their gold to strew over thy bed. Farewell—farewell—until Pity's sweet fountain Is lost in the hearts of the fair and the brave, They'll weep for the Chieftain who died on that mountain, They'll weep for the Maiden who sleeps in this wave. END OF THE SIXTH VOLUME. THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM. Who has not heard of the Vale of Cashmere, With its roses the brightest that earth ever gave “The rose of Kashmire for its brilliancy and delicacy of odour has long been proverbial in the East.” —Forster., Its temples, and grottos, and fountains as clear As the love-lighted eyes that hang over their wave? Oh! to see it at sunset,—when warm o'er the Lake Its splendour at parting a summer eve throws, Like a bride, full of blushes, when ling'ring to take A last look of her mirror at night ere she goes!— When the shrines through the foliage are gleaming half shown, And each hallows the hour by some rites of its own. Here the music of pray'r from a minaret swells, Here the Magian his urn, full of perfume, is swinging, And here, at the altar, a zone of sweet bells Round the waist of some fair Indian dancer is ringing. “Tied round her waist the zone of bells, that sounded with ravishing melody.” —Song of Jayadeva. Or to see it by moonlight,—when mellowly shines The light o'er its palaces, gardens, and shrines; When the water-falls gleam, like a quick fall of stars, And the nightingale's hymn from the Isle of Chenars Is broken by laughs and light echoes of feet From the cool, shining walks where the young people meet.— Or at morn, when the magic of daylight awakes A new wonder each minute, as slowly it breaks, Hills, cupolas, fountains, call'd forth every one Out of darkness, as if but just born of the Sun. When the Spirit of Fragrance is up with the day, From his Haram of night-flowers stealing away; And the wind, full of wantonness, woos like a lover The young aspen-trees “The little isles in the Lake of Cachemire are set with arbours and large-leaved aspen-trees, slender and tall.” —Bernier., till they tremble all over. When the East is as warm as the light of first hopes, And Day, with his banner of radiance unfurl'd, Shines in through the mountainous portal “The Tuckt Suliman, the name bestowed by the Mahommetans on this hill, forms one side of a grand portal to the Lake.” —Forster. that opes, Sublime, from that Valley of bliss to the world! But never yet, by night or day, In dew of spring or summer's ray, Did the sweet Valley shine so gay As now it shines—all love and light, Visions by day and feasts by night! A happier smile illumes each brow, With quicker spread each heart uncloses, And all is ecstasy,—for now The Valley holds its Feast of Roses “The Feast of Roses continues the whole time of their remaining in bloom.” —See Pietro de la Valle.; The joyous Time, when pleasures pour Profusely round and, in their shower, Hearts open, like the Season's Rose,— The Flow'ret of a hundred leaves “Gul sad berk, the Rose of a hundred leaves. I believe a particular species.” —Ouseley., Expanding while the dew-fall flows, And every leaf its balm receives. 'Twas when the hour of evening came Upon the Lake, serene and cool, When Day had hid his sultry flame Behind the palms of Baramoule Bernier., When maids began to lift their heads, Refresh'd from their embroider'd beds, Where they had slept the sun away, And wak'd to moonlight and to play. All were abroad—the busiest hive On Bela's A place mentioned in the Toozek Jehangeery, or Memoirs of Jehanguire, where there is an account of the beds of saffron-flowers about Cashmere. hills is less alive, When saffron-beds are full in flower, Than look'd the Valley in that hour. A thousand restless torches play'd Through every grove and island shade; A thousand sparkling lamps were set On every dome and minaret; And fields and pathways, far and near, Were lighted by a blaze so clear, That you could see, in wandering round, The smallest rose-leaf on the ground. Yet did the maids and matrons leave Their veils at home, that brilliant eve; And there were glancing eyes about, And cheeks, that would not dare shine out In open day, but thought they might Look lovely then, because 'twas night. And all were free, and wandering, And all exclaim'd to all they met, That never did the summer bring So gay a Feast of Roses yet;— The moon had never shed a light So clear as that which bless'd them there; The roses ne'er shone half so bright, Nor they themselves look'd half so fair. And what a wilderness of flowers! It seem'd as though from all the bowers And fairest fields of all the year, The mingled spoil were scatter'd here. The Lake, too, like a garden breathes, With the rich buds that o'er it lie,— As if a shower of fairy wreaths Had fall'n upon it from the sky! And then the sounds of joy,—the beat Of tabors and of dancing feet;— The minaret-crier's chaunt of glee Sung from his lighted gallery “It is the custom among the women to employ the Maazeen to chaunt from the gallery of the nearest minaret, which on that occasion is illuminated, and the women assembled at the house respond at intervals with a ziraleet or joyous chorus.” —Russell., And answer'd by a ziraleet From neighbouring Haram, wild and sweet;— The merry laughter, echoing From gardens, where the silken swing “The swing is a favourite pastime in the East, as promoting a circulation of air, extremely refreshing in those sultry climates.” —Richardson. “The swings are adorned with festoons. This pastime is accompanied with music of voices and of instruments, hired by the masters of the swings.” — Thevenot. Wafts some delighted girl above The top leaves of the orange-grove; Or, from those infant groups at play Among the tents “At the keeping of the Feast of Roses we beheld an infinite number of tents pitched, with such a crowd of men, women, boys, and girls, with music, dances,” &amp;c. &amp;c. —Herbert. that line the way, Flinging, unaw'd by slave or mother, Handfuls of roses at each other.— Then, the sounds from the Lake,—the low whispering in boats, As they shoot through the moonlight;—the dipping of oars, And the wild, airy warbling that every where floats, Through the groves, round the islands, as if all the shores, Like those of Kathay, utter'd music, and gave An answer in song to the kiss of each wave. “An old commentator of the Chou-King says, the ancients having remarked that a current of water made some of the stones near its banks send forth a sound, they detached some of them, and being charmed with the delightful sound they emitted, constructed King or musical instruments of them.” —Grosier. This miraculous quality has been attributed also to the shore of Attica. “Hujus littus, ait Capella, concentum musicum illisis terræ undis reddere, quod propter tantam eruditionis vim puto dictum.” —Ludov. Vives in Augustin de Civitat. Dei, lib. xviii. c. 8. But the gentlest of all are those sounds, full of feeling, That soft from the lute of some lover are stealing,— Some lover, who knows all the heart-touching power Of a lute and a sigh in this magical hour. Oh! best of delights as it every where is To be near the lov'd One,—what a rapture is his Who in moonlight and music thus sweetly may glide O'er the Lake of Cashmere, with that One by his side! If woman can make the worst wilderness dear, Think, think what a Heav'n she must make of Cashmere! So felt the magnificent Son of Acbar Jehanguire was the son of the Great Acbar., When from power and pomp and the trophies of war He flew to that Valley, forgetting them all With the Light of the Haram, his young Nourmahal. When free and uncrown'd as the Conqueror rov'd By the banks of that Lake, with his only belov'd, He saw, in the wreaths she would playfully snatch From the hedges, a glory his crown could not match, And preferr'd in his heart the least ringlet that curl'd Down her exquisite neck to the throne of the world. There's a beauty, for ever unchangingly bright, Like the long, sunny lapse of a summer-day's light, Shining on, shining on, by no shadow made tender, Till Love falls asleep in its sameness of splendour. This was not the beauty—oh, nothing like this, That to young Nourmahal gave such magic of bliss! But that loveliness, ever in motion, which plays Like the light upon autumn's soft shadowy days, Now here and now there, giving warmth as it flies From the lip to the cheek, from the cheek to the eyes; Now melting in mist and now breaking in gleams, Like the glimpses a saint hath of Heav'n in his dreams. When pensive, it seem'd as if that very grace, That charm of all others, was born with her face! And when angry,—for ev'n in the tranquillest climes Light breezes will ruffle the blossoms sometimes— The short, passing anger but seem'd to awaken New beauty, like flowers that are sweetest when shaken. If tenderness touch'd her, the dark of her eye At once took a darker, a heavenlier dye, From the depth of whose shadow, like holy revealings From innermost shrines, came the light of her feelings. Then her mirth—oh! 'twas sportive as ever took wing From the heart with a burst, like the wild-bird in spring; Illum'd by a wit that would fascinate sages, Yet playful as Peris just loos'd from their cages. In the wars of the Dives with the Peris, whenever the former took the latter prisoners, “they shut them up in iron cages, and hung them on the highest trees. Here they were visited by their companions, who brought them the choicest odours.” —Richardson. While her laugh, full of life, without any control But the sweet one of gracefulness, rung from her soul; And where it most sparkled no glance could discover, In lip, cheek, or eyes, for she brighten'd all over,— Like any fair lake that the breeze is upon, When it breaks into dimples and laughs in the sun. Such, such were the peerless enchantments, that gave Nourmahal the proud Lord of the East for her slave: And though bright was his Haram,—a living parterre Of the flow'rs In the Malay language the same word signifies women and flowers. of this planet—though treasures were there, For which Soliman's self might have giv'n all the store That the navy from Ophir e'er wing'd to his shore, Yet dim before her were the smiles of them all, And the Light of his Haram was young Nourmahal! But where is she now, this night of joy, When bliss is every heart's employ?— When all around her is so bright, So like the visions of a trance, That one might think, who came by chance Into the vale this happy night, He saw that City of Delight The capital of Shadukiam. See note, Vol. VI. p. 184. In Fairy-land, whose streets and towers Are made of gems and light and flowers! Where is the lov'd Sultana? where, When mirth brings out the young and fair, Does she, the fairest, hide her brow, In melancholy stillness now? Alas!—how light a cause may move Dissension between hearts that love! Hearts that the world in vain had tried, And sorrow but more closely tied; That stood the storm, when waves were rough, Yet in a sunny hour fall off, Like ships that have gone down at sea, When heaven was all tranquillity! A something, light as air—a look, A word unkind or wrongly taken— Oh! love, that tempests never shook, A breath, a touch like this hath shaken. And ruder words will soon rush in To spread the breach that words begin; And eyes forget the gentle ray They wore in courtship's smiling day; And voices lose the tone that shed A tenderness round all they said; Till fast declining, one by one, The sweetnesses of love are gone, And hearts, so lately mingled, seem Like broken clouds,—or like the stream, That smiling left the mountain's brow As though its waters ne'er could sever, Yet, ere it reach the plain below, Breaks into floods, that part for ever. Oh, you, that have the charge of Love, Keep him in rosy bondage bound, As in the Fields of Bliss above He sits, with flow'rets fetter'd round See the representation of the Eastern Cupid, pinioned closely round with wreaths of flowers, in Picart's Cérémonies Religieuses.;— Loose not a tie that round him clings, Nor ever let him use his wings; For ev'n an hour, a minute's flight Will rob the plumes of half their light. Like that celestial bird,—whose nest Is found beneath far Eastern skies,— Whose wings, though radiant when at rest, Lose all their glory when he flies! “Among the birds of Tonquin is a species of goldfinch, which sings so melodiously that it is called the Celestial Bird. Its wings, when it is perched, appear variegated with beautiful colours, but when it flies they lose all their splendour.” — Grosier. Some difference, of this dangerous kind,— By which, though light, the links that bind The fondest hearts may soon be riven; Some shadow in Love's summer heaven, Which, though a fleecy speck at first, May yet in awful thunder burst;— Such cloud it is, that now hangs over The heart of the Imperial Lover, And far hath banish'd from his sight His Nourmahal, his Haram's Light! Hence is it, on this happy night, When Pleasure through the fields and groves Has let loose all her world of loves, And every heart has found its own, He wanders, joyless and alone, And weary as that bird of Thrace, Whose pinion knows no resting-place. “As these birds on the Bosphorus are never known to rest, they are called by the French ‘les âmes damnées.’” — Dalloway. In vain the loveliest cheeks and eyes This Eden of the Earth supplies Come crowding round—the cheeks are pale, The eyes are dim:—though rich the spot With every flow'r this earth has got, What is it to the nightingale, If there his darling rose is not? “You may place a hundred handfuls of fragrant herbs and flowers before the nightingale, yet he wishes not, in his constant heart, for more than the sweet breath of his beloved rose.” —Jami. In vain the Valley's smiling throng Worship him, as he moves along; He heeds them not—one smile of hers Is worth a world of worshippers. They but the Star's adorers are, She is the Heav'n that lights the Star! Hence is it, too, that Nourmahal, Amid the luxuries of this hour, Far from the joyous festival, Sits in her own sequester'd bower, With no one near, to soothe or aid, But that inspir'd and wond'rous maid, Namouna, the Enchantress;—one, O'er whom his race the golden sun For unremember'd years has run, Yet never saw her blooming brow Younger or fairer than 'tis now. Nay, rather,—as the west wind's sigh Freshens the flower it passes by,— Time's wing but seem'd, in stealing o'er, To leave her lovelier than before. Yet on her smiles a sadness hung, And when, as oft, she spoke or sung Of other worlds, there came a light From her dark eyes so strangely bright, That all believ'd nor man nor earth Were concious of Namouna's birth! All spells and talismans she knew, From the great Mantra “He is said to have found the great Mantra, spell or talisman, through which he ruled over the elements and spirits of all denominations.” —Wilford., which around The Air's sublimer Spirits drew, To the gold gems “The gold jewels of Jinnie, which are called by the Arabs El Herrez, from the supposed charm they contain.” —Jackson. of Afric, bound Upon the wandering Arab's arm, To keep him from the Siltim's “A demon, supposed to haunt woods, &amp;c. in a human shape.” —Richardson. harm. And she had pledg'd her powerful art,— Pledg'd it with all the zeal and heart Of one who knew, though high her sphere, What 'twas to lose a love so dear,— To find some spell that should recall Her Selim's The name of Jehanguire before his accession to the throne. smile to Nourmahal! 'Twas midnight—through the lattice, wreath'd With woodbine, many a perfume breath'd From plants that wake when others sleep, From timid jasmine buds, that keep Their odour to themselves all day, But, when the sun-light dies away, Let the delicious secret out To every breeze that roams about;— When thus Namouna:—“'Tis the hour “That scatters spells on herb and flower, “And garlands might be gather'd now, “That, twin'd around the sleeper's brow, “Would make him dream of such delights, “Such miracles and dazzling sights, “As Genii of the Sun behold, “At evening, from their tents of gold “Upon the' horizon—where they play “Till twilight comes, and, ray by ray, “Their sunny mansions melt away. “Now, too, a chaplet might be wreath'd “Of buds o'er which the moon has breath'd, “Which worn by her, whose love has stray'd, “Might bring some Peri from the skies, “Some sprite, whose very soul is made “Of flow'rets' breaths and lovers' sighs, “And who might tell—” “For me, for me,” Cried Nourmahal impatiently,— “Oh! twine that wreath for me to night.” Then, rapidly, with foot as light As the young musk-roe's, out she flew, To cull each shining leaf that grew Beneath the moonlight's hallowing beams, For this enchanted Wreath of Dreams. Anemones and Seas of Gold “Hemasagara, or the Sea of Gold, with flowers of the brightest gold colour.” —Sir W. Jones., And new-blown lilies of the river, And those sweet flow'rets, that unfold Their buds on Camadeva's quiver “This tree (the Nagacesara) is one of the most delightful on earth, and the delicious odour of its blossoms justly gives them a place in the quiver of Camadeva, or the God of Love.” —Id.;— The tube-rose, with her silvery light, That in the Gardens of Malay Is call'd the Mistress of the Night “The Malayans style the tube-rose (Polianthes tuberosa) Sandal Malam, or the Mistress of the Night.” —Pennant., So like a bride, scented and bright, She comes out when the sun's away;— Amaranths, such as crown the maids That wander through Zamara's shades The people of the Batta country in Sumatra (of which Zamara is one of the ancient names), “when not engaged in war, lead an idle, inactive life, passing the day in playing on a kind of flute, crowned with garlands of flowers, among which the globe-amaranthus, a native of the country, mostly prevails.” — Marsden.;— And the white moon-flower, as it shows, On Serendib's high crags, to those Who near the isle at evening sail, Scenting her clove-trees in the gale; In short, all flow'rets and all plants, From the divine Amrita tree “The largest and richest sort (of the Jambu or rose-apple) is called Amrita, or immortal, and the mythologists of Tibet apply the same word to a celestial tree, bearing ambrosial fruit.” —Sir W. Jones., That blesses heaven's inhabitants With fruits of immortality, Down to the basil tuft Sweet basil, called Rayhan in Persia, and generally found in churchyards. “The women in Egypt go, at least two days in the week, to pray and weep at the sepulchres of the dead; and the custom then is to throw upon the tombs a sort of herb, which the Arabs call rihan, and which is our sweet basil. —Maillet, Lett. 10., that waves, Its fragrant blossom over graves, And to the humble rosemary, Whose sweets so thanklessly are shed To scent the desert “In the Great Desert are found many stalks of lavender and rosemary.” —Asiat. Res. and the dead:— All in that garden bloom, and all Are gather'd by young Nourmahal, Who heaps her baskets with the flowers And leaves, till they can hold no more; Then to Namouna flies, and showers Upon her lap the shining store. With what delight the' Enchantress views So many buds, bath'd with the dews And beams of that bless'd hour!—her glance Spoke something, past all mortal pleasures, As, in a kind of holy trance, She hung above those fragrant treasures, Bending to drink their balmy airs, As if she mix'd her soul with theirs. And 'twas, indeed, the perfume shed From flow'rs and scented flame, that fed Her charmed life—for none had e'er Beheld her taste of mortal fare, Nor ever in aught earthly dip, But the morn's dew, her roseate lip. Fill'd with the cool, inspiring smell, The' Enchantress now begins her spell, Thus singing as she winds and weaves In mystic form the glittering leaves:— I know where the winged visions dwell That around the night-bed play; I know each herb and flow'ret's bell, Where they hide their wings by day. Then hasten we, maid, To twine our braid, To-morrow the dreams and flowers will fade. The image of love, that nightly flies To visit the bashful maid, Steals from the jasmine flower, that sighs Its soul, like her, in the shade. The dream of a future, happier hour, That alights on misery's brow, Springs out of the silvery almond-flower, That blooms on a leafless bough. “The almond-tree, with white flowers, blossoms on the bare branches.” —Hasselquist. Then hasten we, maid, To twine our braid, To-morrow the dreams and flowers will fade. The visions, that oft to worldly eyes The glitter of mines unfold, Inhabit the mountain-herb An herb on Mount Libanus, which is said to communicate a yellow golden hue to the teeth of the goats and other animals that graze upon it. Niebuhr thinks this may be the herb which the Eastern alchymists look to as a means of making gold. “Most of those alchymical enthusiasts think themselves sure of success, if they could but find out the herb, which gilds the teeth and gives a yellow colour to the flesh of the sheep that eat it. Even the oil of this plant must be of a golden colour. It is called Haschischat ed dab.” Father Jerom Dandini, however, asserts that the teeth of the goats at Mount Libanus are of a silver colour; and adds, “this confirms me that which I observed in Candia: to wit, that the animals that live on Mount Ida eat a certain herb, which renders their teeth of a golden colour; which, according to my judgment, cannot otherwise proceed than from the mines which are under ground.” —Dandini, Voyage to Mount Libanus., that dyes The tooth of the fawn like gold. The phantom shapes—oh touch not them— That appal the murderer's sight, Lurk in the fleshly mandrake's stem, That shrieks, when pluck'd at night! Then hasten we, maid, To twine our braid, To-morrow the dreams and flowers will fade. The dream of the injur'd, patient mind, That smiles at the wrongs of men, Is found in the bruis'd and wounded rind Of the cinnamon, sweetest then. Then hasten we, maid, To twine our braid, To-morrow the dreams and flowers will fade. No sooner was the flowery crown Placed on her head, than sleep came down, Gently as nights of summer fall, Upon the lids of Nourmahal;— And, suddenly, a tuneful breeze, As full of small, rich harmonies As ever wind, that o'er the tents Of Azab The myrrh country. blew, was full of scents, Steals on her ear, and floats and swells, Like the first air of morning creeping Into those wreathy, Red-Sea shells, Where Love himself, of old, lay sleeping “This idea (of deities living in shells) was not unknown to the Greeks, who represent the young Nerites, one of the Cupids, as living in shells on the shores of the Red Sea.” —Wilford.; And now a Spirit form'd, 'twould seem, Of music and of light,—so fair, So brilliantly his features beam, And such a sound is in the air Of sweetness when he waves his wings,— Hovers around her, and thus sings: From Chindara's “A fabulous fountain, where instruments are said to be constantly playing.” —Richardson. warbling fount I come, Call'd by that moonlight garland's spell; From Chindara's fount, my fairy home, Where in music, morn and night, I dwell. Where lutes in the air are heard about, And voices are singing the whole day long, And every sigh the heart breathes out Is turn'd, as it leaves the lips, to song! Hither I come From my fairy home, And if there's a magic in Music's strain, I swear by the breath Of that moonlight wreath, Thy Lover shall sigh at thy feet again. For mine is the lay that lightly floats, And mine are the murmuring, dying notes, That fall as soft as snow on the sea, And melt in the heart as instantly:— And the passionate strain that, deeply going, Refines the bosom it trembles through, As the musk-wind, over the water blowing, Ruffles the wave, but sweetens it too. Mine is the charm, whose mystic sway The Spirits of past Delight obey;— Let but the tuneful talisman sound, And they come, like Genii, hovering round. And mine is the gentle song that bears From soul to soul, the wishes of love, As a bird, that wafts through genial airs The cinnamon-seed from grove to grove. “The Pompadour pigeon is the species, which, by carrying the fruit of the cinnamon to different places, is a great disseminator of this valuable tree.” —See Brown's Illustr. Tab. 19. 'Tis I that mingle in one sweet measure The past, the present, and future of pleasure “Whenever our pleasure arises from a succession of sounds, it is a perception of a complicated nature, made up of a sensation of the present sound or note, and an idea or remembrance of the foregoing, while their mixture and concurrence produce such a mysterious delight, as neither could have produced alone. And it is often heightened by an anticipation of the succeeding notes. Thus Sense, Memory, and Imagination, are conjunctively employed.” —Gerrard on Taste. This is exactly the Epicurean theory of Pleasure, as explained by Cicero:—“Quocirca corpus gaudere tamdiu, dum præsentem sentiret voluptatem: animum et præsentem percipere pariter cum corpore et prospicere venientem, nec præteritam præterfluere sinere.” Madame de Staël accounts upon the same principle for the gratification we derive from rhyme:—“Elle est l'image de l'espérance et du souvenir. Un son nous fait désirer celui qui doit lui répondre, et quand le second retentit il nous rappelle celui qui vient de nous échapper.”; When Memory links the tone that is gone With the blissful tone that's still in the ear; And Hope from a heavenly note flies on To a note more heavenly still that is near. The warrior's heart, when touch'd by me, Can as downy soft and as yielding be As his own white plume, that high amid death Through the field has shone—yet moves with a breath! And, oh, how the eyes of Beauty glisten, When Music has reach'd her inward soul, Like the silent stars, that wink and listen While Heaven's eternal melodies roll. So, hither I come From my fairy home, And if there's a magic in Music's strain, I swear by the breath Of that moonlight wreath, Thy Lover shall sigh at thy feet again. 'Tis dawn—at least that earlier dawn, Whose glimpses are again withdrawn “The Persians have two mornings, the Soobhi Kazim and the Soobhi Sadig, the false and the real day-break. They account for this phenomenon in a most whimsical manner. They say that as the sun rises from behind the Kohi Qaf (Mount Caucasus), it passes a hole perforated through that mountain, and that darting its rays through it, it is the cause of the Soobhi Kazim, or this temporary appearance of day-break. As it ascends, the earth is again veiled in darkness, until the sun rises above the mountain, and brings with it the Soobhi Sadig, or real morning.” —Scott Waring. He thinks Milton may allude to this, when he says,— “Ere the blabbing Eastern scout, The nice morn on the Indian steep From her cabin'd loop-hole peep.”, As if the morn had wak'd, and then Shut close her lids of light again. And Nourmahal is up, and trying The wonders of her lute, whose strings— Oh, bliss!—now murmur like the sighing From that ambrosial Spirit's wings. And then, her voice—'tis more than human— Never, till now, had it been given To lips of any mortal woman To utter notes so fresh from heaven; Sweet as the breath of angel sighs, When angel sighs are most divine.— “Oh! let it last till night,” she cries, “And he is more than ever mine.” And hourly she renews the lay, So fearful lest its heavenly sweetness Should, ere the evening, fade away,— For things so heavenly have such fleetness! But, far from fading, it but grows Richer, diviner as it flows; Till rapt she dwells on every string, And pours again each sound along, Like echo, lost and languishing, In love with her own wondrous song. That evening, (trusting that his soul Might be from haunting love releas'd By mirth, by music, and the bowl,) The' Imperial Selim held a feast In his magnificent Shalimar “In the centre of the plain, as it approaches the Lake, one of the Delhi Emperors, I believe Shah Jehan, constructed a spacious garden called the Shalimar, which is abundantly stored with fruit-trees and flowering shrubs. Some of the rivulets which intersect the plain are led into a canal at the back of the garden, and flowing through its centre, or occasionally thrown into a variety of water-works, compose the chief beauty of the Shalimar. To decorate this spot the Mogul Princes of India have displayed an equal magnificence and taste; especially Jehan Gheer, who, with the enchanting Noor Mahl, made Kashmire his usual residence during the summer months. On arches thrown over the canal are erected, at equal distances, four or five suites of apartments, each consisting of a saloon, with four rooms at the angles, where the followers of the court attend, and the servants prepare sherbets, coffee, and the hookah. The frame of the doors of the principal saloon is composed of pieces of a stone of a black colour, streaked with yellow lines, and of a closer grain and higher polish than porphyry. They were taken, it is said, from a Hindoo temple, by one of the Mogul princes, and are esteemed of great value.” —Forster.:— In whose Saloons, when the first star Of evening o'er the waters trembled, The Valley's loveliest all assembled; All the bright creatures that, like dreams, Glide through its foliage, and drink beams Of beauty from its founts and streams “The waters of Cachemir are the more renowned from its being supposed that the Cachemirians are indebted for their beauty to them.” —Ali Yezdi.; And all those wandering minstrel-maids, Who leave—how can they leave?—the shades Of that dear Valley, and are found Singing in gardens of the South “From him I received the following little Gazzel, or Love Song, the notes of which he committed to paper from the voice of one of those singing girls of Cashmere, who wander from that delightful valley over the various parts of India.” —Persian Miscellanies. Those songs, that ne'er so sweetly sound As from a young Cashmerian's mouth. There, too, the Haram's inmates smile;— Maids from the West, with sun-bright hair, And from the Garden of the Nile, Delicate as the roses there “The roses of the Jinan Nile, or Garden of the Nile (attached to the Emperor of Marocco's palace), are unequalled, and matrasses are made of their leaves for the men of rank to recline upon.” —Jackson.;— Daughters of Love from Cyprus' rocks, With Paphian diamonds in their locks “On the side of a mountain near Paphos there is a cavern which produces the most beautiful rock-crystal. On account of its brilliancy it has been called the Paphian diamond.” —Mariti.;— Light Peri forms, such as there are On the gold meads of Candahar “There is a part of Candahar, called Peria, or Fairy Land.” —Thevenot. In some of those countries to the north of India vegetable gold is supposed to be produced.; And they, before whose sleepy eyes, In their own bright Kathaian bowers, Sparkle such rainbow butterflies, That they might fancy the rich flowers, That round them in the sun lay sighing, Had been by magic all set flying. “These are the butterflies which are called in the Chinese language Flying Leaves. Some of them have such shining colours, and are so variegated, that they may be called flying flowers; and indeed they are always produced in the finest flower-gardens.” —Dunn. Every thing young, every thing fair From East and West is blushing there, Except—except—oh, Nourmahal! Thou loveliest, dearest of them all, The one, whose smile shone out alone, Amidst a world the only one; Whose light, among so many lights, Was like that star on starry nights, The seaman singles from the sky, To steer his bark for ever by! Thou wert not there—so Selim thought, And every thing seem'd drear without thee; But, ah! thou wert, thou wert,—and brought Thy charm of song all fresh about thee. Mingling unnotic'd with a band Of lutanists from many a land, And veil'd by such a mask as shades The features of young Arab maids “The Arabian women wear black masks with little clasps prettily ordered.” —Carreri. Niebuhr mentions their showing but one eye in conversation.,— A mask that leaves but one eye free, To do its best in witchery,— She rov'd, with beating heart, around, And waited, trembling, for the minute, When she might try if still the sound Of her lov'd lute had magic in it. The board was spread with fruits and wine; With grapes of gold, like those that shine On Casbin's hills “The golden grapes of Casbin.” —Description of Persia.;—pomegranates full Of melting sweetness, and the pears, And sunniest apples “The fruits exported from Caubul are apples, pears, pomegranates,” &amp;c. —Elphinstone. that Caubul In all its thousand gardens “We sat down under a tree, listened to the birds, and talked with the son of our Mehmaundar about our country and Caubul, of which he gave an enchanting account: that city and its 100,000 gardens,” &amp;c. —Id. bears;— Plantains, the golden and the green, Malaya's nectar'd mangusteen “The mangusteen, the most delicate fruit in the world; the pride of the Malay islands.” —Marsden.; Prunes of Bokara, and sweet nuts From the far groves of Samarcand, And Basra dates, and apricots, Seed of the Sun “A delicious kind of apricot, called by the Persians tokmek-shems, signifying sun's seed.” —Description of Persia., from Iran's land;— With rich conserve of Visna cherries “Sweetmeats, in a crystal cup, consisting of rose-leaves in conserve, with lemon of Visna cherry, orange flowers,” &amp;c. —Russell., Of orange flowers, and of those berries That, wild and fresh, the young gazelles Feed on in Erac's rocky dells. “Antelopes cropping the fresh berries of Erac.” —The Moallakat, Poem of Tarafa. All these in richest vases smile, In baskets of pure santal-wood, And urns of porcelain from that isle “Mauri-ga-Sima, an island near Formosa, supposed to have been sunk in the sea for the crimes of its inhabitants. The vessels which the fishermen and divers bring up from it are sold at an immense price in China and Japan. See Kempfer. Sunk underneath the Indian flood, Whence oft the lucky diver brings Vases to grace the halls of kings. Wines, too, of every clime and hue, Around their liquid lustre threw; Amber Rosolli Persian Tales.,—the bright dew From vineyards of the Green-Sea gushing The white wine of Kishma.; And Shiraz wine, that richly ran As if that jewel, large and rare, The ruby for which Kublai-Khan Offer'd a city's wealth “The King of Zeilan is said to have the very finest ruby that was ever seen. Kublai-Khan sent and offered the value of a city for it, but the King answered he would not give it for the treasure of the world.” —Marco Polo., was blushing Melted within the goblets there! And amply Selim quaffs of each, And seems resolv'd the flood shall reach His inward heart,—shedding around A genial deluge, as they run, That soon shall leave no spot undrown'd, For Love to rest his wings upon. He little knew how well the boy Can float upon a goblet's streams, Lighting them with his smile of joy;— As bards have seen him in their dreams, Down the blue Ganges laughing glide Upon a rosy lotus wreath The Indians feign that Cupid was first seen floating down the Ganges on the Nymphæa Nelumbo. —See Pennant., Catching new lustre from the tide That with his image shone beneath. But what are cups, without the aid Of song to speed them as they flow? And see—a lovely Georgian maid, With all the bloom, the freshen'd glow Of her own country maidens' looks, When warm they rise from Teflis' brooks Teflis is celebrated for its natural warm baths. —See Ebn Haukal.; And with an eye, whose restless ray, Full, floating, dark—oh, he, who knows His heart is weak, of Heav'n should pray To guard him from such eyes as those!— With a voluptuous wildness flings Her snowy hand across the strings Of a syrinda “The Indian Syrinda, or guitar.” —Symez., and thus sings:— Come hither, come hither—by night and by day, We linger in pleasures that never are gone; Like the waves of the summer, as one dies away, Another as sweet and as shining comes on. And the love that is o'er, in expiring, gives birth To a new one as warm, as unequall'd in bliss; And, oh! if there be an Elysium on earth, It is this, it is this. “Around the exterior of the Dewan Khafs (a building of Shah Allum's) in the cornice are the following lines in letters of gold upon a ground of white marble—‘If there be a paradise upon earth, it is this, it is this.’” —Franklin. Here maidens are sighing, and fragrant their sigh As the flower of the Amra just op'd by a bee “Delightful are the flowers of the Amra trees on the mountain-tops, while the murmuring bees pursue their voluptuous toil.” —Song of Jayadeva.; And precious their tears as that rain from the sky “The Nisan or drops of spring rain, which they believe to produce pearls if they fall into shells.” —Richardson., Which turns into pearls as it falls in the sea. Oh! think what the kiss and the smile must be worth When the sigh and the tear are so perfect in bliss, And own if there be an Elysium on earth, It is this, it is this. Here sparkles the nectar, that, hallow'd by love, Could draw down those angels of old from their sphere, Who for wine of this earth For an account of the share which wine had in the fall of the angels, see Mariti. left the fountains above, And forgot heaven's stars for the eyes we have here. And, bless'd with the odour our goblet gives forth, What Spirit the sweets of his Eden would miss? For, oh! if there be an Elysium on earth, It is this, it is this. The Georgian's song was scarcely mute, When the same measure, sound for sound, Was caught up by another lute, And so divinely breathed around, That all stood hush'd and wondering, And turn'd and look'd into the air, As if they thought to see the wing Of Israfil The Angel of Music. See note, Vol. VI. p. 302., the Angel, there;— So powerfully on every soul That new, enchanted measure stole. While now a voice, sweet as the note Of the charm'd lute, was heard to float Along its chords, and so entwine Its sounds with theirs, that none knew whether The voice or lute was most divine, So wondrously they went together:— There's a bliss beyond all that the minstrel has told, When two, that are link'd in one heavenly tie, With heart never changing, and brow never cold, Love on through all ills, and love on till they die! One hour of a passion so sacred is worth Whole ages of heartless and wandering bliss; And, oh! if there be an Elysium on earth, It is this, it is this. 'Twas not the air, 'twas not the words, But that deep magic in the chords And in the lips, that gave such power As Music knew not till that hour. At once a hundred voices said, “It is the mask'd Arabian maid!” While Selim, who had felt the strain Deepest of any, and had lain Some minutes rapt, as in a trance, After the fairy sounds were o'er, Too inly touch'd for utterance, Now motion'd with his hand for more:— Fly to the desert, fly with me, Our Arab tents are rude for thee; But, oh! the choice what heart can doubt, Of tents with love, or thrones without? Our rocks are rough, but smiling there The' acacia waves her yellow hair, Lonely and sweet, nor lov'd the less For flowering in a wilderness. Our sands are bare, but down their slope The silvery-footed antelope As gracefully and gaily springs As o'er the marble courts of kings. Then come—thy Arab maid will be The lov'd and lone acacia-tree, The antelope, whose feet shall bless With their light sound thy loneliness. Oh! there are looks and tones that dart An instant sunshine through the heart,— As if the soul that minute caught Some treasure it through life had sought; As if the very lips and eyes, Predestin'd to have all our sighs, And never be forgot again, Sparkled and spoke before us then! So came thy every glance and tone, When first on me they breath'd and shone; New, as if brought from other spheres, Yet welcome as if lov'd for years. Then fly with me,—if thou hast known No other flame, nor falsely thrown A gem away, that thou hadst sworn Should ever in thy heart be worn. Come, if the love thou hast for me Is pure and fresh as mine for thee,— Fresh as the fountain under ground, When first 'tis by the lapwing found. The Hudhud, or Lapwing, is supposed to have the power of discovering water under ground. But if for me thou dost forsake Some other maid, and rudely break Her worshipp'd image from its base, To give to me the ruin'd place;— Then, fare thee well—I'd rather make My bower upon some icy lake When thawing suns begin to shine, Than trust to love so false as thine! There was a pathos in this lay, That, ev'n without enchantment's art, Would instantly have found its way Deep into Selim's burning heart; But, breathing, as it did, a tone To earthly lutes and lips unknown; With every chord fresh from the touch Of Music's Spirit,—'twas too much! Starting, he dash'd away the cup,— Which, all the time of this sweet air, His hand had held, untasted, up, As if 'twere fix'd by magic there,— And naming her, so long unnam'd, So long unseen, wildly exclaim'd, “Oh Nourmahal! oh Nourmahal! “Hadst thou but sung this witching strain, “I could forget—forgive thee all, “And never leave those eyes again.” The mask is off—the charm is wrought— And Selim to his heart has caught, In blushes, more than ever bright, His Nourmahal, his Haram's Light! And well do vanish'd frowns enhance The charm of every brighten'd glance; And dearer seems each dawning smile For having lost its light awhile: And, happier now for all her sighs, As on his arm her head reposes, She whispers him, with laughing eyes, “Remember, love, the Feast of Roses!” POLITICAL AND SATIRICAL POEMS. LINES ON THE DEATH OF MR. P?RC?V?L. In the dirge we sung o'er him no censure was heard, Unembitter'd and free did the tear-drop descend; We forgot, in that hour, how the statesman had err'd, And wept for the husband, the father, and friend. Oh, proud was the meed his integrity won, And gen'rous indeed were the tears that we shed, When, in grief, we forgot all the ill he had done, And, though wrong'd by him, living, bewail'd him, when dead. Even now, if one harsher emotion intrude, 'Tis to wish he had chosen some lowlier state, Had known what he was—and, content to be good, Had ne'er, for our ruin, aspired to be great. So, left through their own little orbit to move, His years might have roll'd inoffensive away; His children might still have been bless'd with his love, And England would ne'er have been cursed with his sway. FUM AND HUM, THE TWO BIRDS OF ROYALTY. To the Editor of the Morning Chronicle. Sir, In order to explain the following Fragment, it is necessary to refer your readers to a late florid description of the Pavilion at Brighton, in the apartments of which, we are told, “Fum, The Chinese Bird of Royalty,” is a principal ornament. I am, Sir, yours, &amp;c. Mum. One day the Chinese Bird of Royalty, Fum, Thus accosted our own Bird of Royalty, Hum, In that Palace or China-shop (Brighton, which is it?) Where Fum had just come to pay Hum a short visit.— Near akin are these Birds, though they differ in nation (The breed of the Hums is as old as creation); Both, full-craw'd Legitimates—both, birds of prey, Both, cackling and ravenous creatures, half way 'Twixt the goose and the vulture, like Lord C?stl?gh. While Fum deals in Mandarins, Bonzes, Bohea, Peers, Bishops, and Punch, Hum, are sacred to thee! So congenial their tastes, that, when Fum first did light on The floor of that grand China-warehouse at Brighton, The lanterns, and dragons, and things round the dome Were so like what he left, “Gad,” says Fum, “I'm at home.”— And when, turning, he saw Bishop L?ge, “Zooks, it is,” Quoth the Bird, “Yes—I know him—a Bonze, by his phyz— “And that jolly old idol he kneels to so low “Can be none but our round-about godhead, fat Fo!” It chanced at this moment, th' Episcopal Prig Was imploring the P?e to dispense with his wig In consequence of an old promise, that he should be allowed to wear his own hair, whenever he might be elevated to a Bishopric by his R?l H?ss., Which the Bird, overhearing, flew high o'er his head, And some Tobit-like marks of his patronage shed, Which so dimm'd the poor Dandy's idolatrous eye, That, while Fum cried “Oh Fo!” all the court cried “Oh fie!” But, a truce to digression;—these Birds of a feather Thus talk'd, t'other night, on State matters together; (The P?e just in bed, or about to depart for't, His legs full of gout, and his arms full of H?rtf?d,) “I say, Hum,” says Fum—Fum, of course, spoke Chinese, But, bless you, that's nothing—at Brighton one sees Foreign lingoes and Bishops translated with ease— “I say, Hum, how fares it with Royalty now? “Is it up? is it prime? is it spooney—or how?” (The Bird had just taken a flash-man's degree Under B?rr?m?re, Y?th, and young Master L?e) “As for us in Pekin”—here, a dev'l of a din From the bed-chamber came, where that long Mandarin, C?stl?gh (whom Fum calls the Confusius of Prose), Was rehearsing a speech upon Europe's repose To the deep, double bass of the fat Idol's nose. (Nota bene—his Lordship and L?v?rp?l come, In collateral lines, from the old Mother Hum, C?stl?gh a Hum-bug—L?v?rp?l a Hum-drum.) The Speech being finish'd, out rush'd C?stl?gh, Saddled Hum in a hurry, and, whip, spur, away, Through the regions of air, like a Snip on his hobby, Ne'er paused, till he lighted in St. Stephen's lobby. LINES ON THE DEATH OF SH?R?D?N. Principibus placuisse viris! —Horat. Yes, grief will have way—but the fast falling tear Shall be mingled with deep execrations on those, Who could bask in that Spirit's meridian career, And yet leave it thus lonely and dark at its close:— Whose vanity flew round him, only while fed By the odour his fame in its summer-time gave;— Whose vanity now, with quick scent for the dead, Like the Ghole of the East, comes to feed at his grave. Oh! it sickens the heart to see bosoms so hollow, And spirits so mean in the great and high-born; To think what a long line of titles may follow The relics of him who died—friendless and lorn! How proud they can press to the fun'ral array Of one, whom they shunn'd in his sickness and sorrow:— How bailiffs may seize his last blanket, to-day, Whose pall shall be held up by nobles to-morrow! And Thou, too, whose life, a sick epicure's dream, Incoherent and gross, even grosser had pass'd, Were it not for that cordial and soul-giving beam, Which his friendship and wit o'er thy nothingness cast:— No, not for the wealth of the land, that supplies thee With millions to heap upon Foppery's shrine;— No, not for the riches of all who despise thee, Tho' this would make Europe's whole opulence mine;— Would I suffer what—ev'n in the heart that thou hast— All mean as it is—must have consciously burn'd, When the pittance, which shame had wrung from thee at last, And which found all his wants at an end, was return'd! The sum was two hundred pounds—offered when Sh?r?d?n could no longer take any sustenance, and declined, for him, by his friends. “Was this then the fate,”—future ages will say, When some names shall live but in history's curse; When Truth will be heard, and these Lords of a day Be forgotten as fools, or remember'd as worse;— “Was this then the fate of that high-gifted man, “The pride of the palace, the bower and the hall, “The orator,—dramatist,—minstrel,—who ran “Through each mode of the lyre, and was master of all;— “Whose mind was an essence, compounded with art “From the finest and best of all other men's powers;— “Who ruled, like a wizard, the world of the heart, “And could call up its sunshine, or bring down its showers;— “Whose humour, as gay as the fire-fly's light, “Play'd round every subject, and shone as it play'd;— “Whose wit, in the combat, as gentle as bright, “Ne'er carried a heart-stain away on its blade;— “Whose eloquence—bright'ning whatever it tried, “Whether reason or fancy, the gay or the grave,— “Was as rapid, as deep, and as brilliant a tide, “As ever bore Freedom aloft on its wave!” Yes—such was the man, and so wretched his fate;— And thus, sooner or later, shall all have to grieve, Who waste their morn's dew in the beams of the Great, And expect 'twill return to refresh them at eve. In the woods of the North there are insects that prey On the brain of the elk till his very last sigh Naturalists have observed that, upon dissecting an elk, there was found in its head some large flies, with its brain almost eaten away by them. —History of Poland.; Oh, Genius! thy patrons, more cruel than they, First feed on thy brains, and then leave thee to die! EPISTLE FROM TOM CRIB TO BIG BEN A nickname given, at this time, to the Pr?ce R?g?t. CONCERNING SOME FOUL PLAY IN A LATE TRANSACTION. Written soon after Bonaparte's transportation to St.Helena. “Ahi, mio Ben!” Metastasio. Tom, I suppose, was “assisted” to this Motto by Mr. Jackson, who, it is well known, keeps the most learned company going. What! Ben, my old hero, is this your renown? Is this the new go?—kick a man when he's down! When the foe has knock'd under, to tread on him then— By the fist of my father, I blush for thee, Ben! “Foul! foul!” all the lads of the Fancy exclaim— Charley Shock is electrified—Belcher spits flame— And Molyneux—ay, even Blacky Names and nicknames of celebrated pugilists at that time. cries “shame!” Time was, when John Bull little difference spied 'Twixt the foe at his feet, and the friend at his side: When he found (such his humour in fighting and eating) His foe, like his beef-steak, the sweeter for beating. But this comes, Master Ben, of your curst foreign notions, Your trinkets, wigs, thingumbobs, gold lace and lotions; Your Noyaus, Curaçoas, and the Devil knows what— (One swig of Blue Ruin Gin. is worth the whole lot!) Your great and small crosses—(my eyes, what a brood! A cross-buttock from me would do some of them good!) Which have spoilt you, till hardly a drop, my old porpoise, Of pure English claret is left in your corpus; And (as Jim says) the only one trick, good or bad, Of the Fancy you're up to, is fibbing, my lad. Hence it comes,—Boxiana, disgrace to thy page!— Having floor'd, by good luck, the first swell of the age!— Having floor'd, by good luck, the first swell of the age, Having conquer'd the prime one, that mill'd us all round, You kick'd him, old Ben, as he gasp'd on the ground!

THE FUDGE FAMILY IN PARIS. Le Leggi della Maschera richiedono che una persona mascherata non sia salutata per nome da uno che la conosce malgrado il suo travestimento. Castiglione. LETTER I. FROM MISS BIDDY FUDGE TO MISS DOROTHY ?, OF CLONKILTY, IN IRELAND. Amiens. Dear Doll, while the tails of our horses are plaiting, The trunks tying on, and Papa, at the door, Into very bad French is, as usual, translating His English resolve not to give a sou more, I sit down to write you a line—only think!— A letter from France, with French pens and French ink, How delightful! though, would you believe it, my dear? I have seen nothing yet very wonderful here; No adventure, no sentiment, far as we've come, But the corn-fields and trees quite as dull as at home; And but for the post-boy, his boots and his queue, I might just as well be at Clonkilty with you! In vain, at Dessein's, did I take from my trunk That divine fellow, Sterne, and fall reading “The Monk;” In vain did I think of his charming Dead Ass, And remember the crust and the wallet—alas! No monks can be had now for love or for money, (All owing, Pa says, to that infidel Boney;) And, though one little Neddy we saw in our drive Out of classical Nampont, the beast was alive! By the by, though, at Calais, Papa had a touch Of romance on the pier, which affected me much. At the sight of that spot, where our darling Dixhuit Set the first of his own dear legitimate feet To commemorate the landing of Louis le Desiré from England, the impression of his foot is marked out on the pier at Calais, and a pillar with an inscription raised opposite to the spot., (Modell'd out so exactly, and—God bless the mark! 'Tis a foot, Dolly, worthy so Grand a Monarque), He exclaim'd, “Oh, mon Roi!” and, with tear-dropping eye, Stood to gaze on the spot—while some Jacobin, nigh, Mutter'd out with a shrug (what an insolent thing!) “Ma foi, he be right—'tis de Englishman's King; And dat gros pied de cochon—begar, me vil say Dat de foot look mosh better, if turn'd toder way.” There's the pillar, too—Lord! I had nearly forgot— What a charming idea!—rais'd close to the spot; The mode being now, (as you've heard, I suppose,) To build tombs over legs Ci-git la jambe de, &amp;c. &amp;c., and raise pillars to toes. This is all that's occurr'd sentimental as yet; Except, indeed, some little flow'r-nymphs we've met, Who disturb one's romance with pecuniary views, Flinging flow'rs in your path, and then—bawling for sous! And some picturesque beggars, whose multitudes seem To recall the good days of the ancien regime, All as ragged and brisk, you'll be happy to learn, And as thin as they were in the time of dear Sterne. Our party consists (in a neat Calais job) Of Papa and myself, Mr. Connor and Bob. You remember how sheepish Bob look'd at Kilrandy, But, Lord! he's quite alter'd—they've made him a Dandy; A thing, you know, whisker'd, great-coated, and laced, Like an hour-glass, exceedingly small in the waist: Quite a new sort of creatures, unknown yet to scholars, With heads, so immovably stuck in shirt-collars, That seats, like our music-stools, soon must be found them, To twirl, when the creatures may wish to look round them. In short, dear, “a Dandy” describes what I mean, And Bob's far the best of the genus I've seen: An improving young man, fond of learning, ambitious, And goes now to Paris to study French dishes, Whose names—think, how quick! he already knows pat, À la braise, petits pâtés, and—what d'ye call that They inflict on potatoes?—oh! maitre d' hôtel— I assure you, dear Dolly, he knows them as well As if nothing else all his life he had eat, Though a bit of them Bobby has never touch'd yet; But just knows the names of French dishes and cooks, As dear Pa knows the titles of authors and books. As to Pa, what d'ye think?—mind, it's all entre nous, But you know, love, I never keep secrets from you— Why, he's writing a book—what! a tale? a romance? No, ye Gods, would it were!—but his Travels in France; At the special desire (he let out t'other day) Of his great friend and patron, my Lord C?stl?r?gh, Who said, “My dear Fudge”—I forget th' exact words, And, it's strange, no one ever remembers my Lord's; But 'twas something to say that, as all must allow A good orthodox work is much wanting just now, To expound to the world the new—thingummie—science, Found out by the—what's-its-name—Holy Alliance, And prove to mankind that their rights are but folly, Their freedom a joke (which it is, you know, Dolly), “There's none,” said his Lordship, “if I may be judge, Half so fit for this great undertaking as Fudge!” The matter's soon settled—Pa flies to the Row (The first stage your tourists now usually go), Settles all for his quarto—advertisements, praises— Starts post from the door, with his tablets—French phrases— “Scott's Visit,” of course—in short, ev'ry thing he has An author can want, except words and ideas:— And, lo! the first thing, in the spring of the year, Is Phil. Fudge at the front of a Quarto, my dear! But, bless me, my paper's near out, so I'd better Draw fast to a close:—this exceeding long letter You owe to a déjeûner à la fourchette, Which Bobby would have, and is hard at it yet.— What's next? oh, the tutor, the last of the party, Young Connor:—they say he's so like Bonaparte, His nose and his chin—which Papa rather dreads, As the Bourbons, you know, are suppressing all heads That resemble old Nap's, and who knows but their honours May think, in their fright, of suppressing poor Connor's? Au reste (as we say), the young lad's well enough, Only talks much of Athens, Rome, virtue, and stuff; A third cousin of ours, by the way—poor as Job (Though of royal descent by the side of Mamma), And for charity made private tutor to Bob;— Entre nous, too, a Papist—how lib'ral of Pa! This is all, dear,—forgive me for breaking off thus, But Bob's déjeûner's done, and Papa's in a fuss. B. F. P. S. How provoking of Pa! he will not let me stop Just to run in and rummage some milliner's shop; And my début in Paris, I blush to think on it, Must now, Doll, be made in a hideous low bonnet. But Paris, dear Paris!—oh, there will be joy, And romance, and high bonnets, and Madame Le Roi! A celebrated mantua-maker in Paris. LETTER II. FROM PHIL. FUDGE, ESQ. TO THE LORD VISCOUNT C?ST?R?GH. Paris. At length, my Lord, I have the bliss To date to you a line from this “Demoraliz'd” metropolis; Where, by plebeians low and scurvy, The throne was turn'd quite topsy turvy, And Kingship, tumbled from its seat, “Stood prostrate” at the people's feet; Where (still to use your Lordship's tropes) The level of obedience slopes Upward and downward, as the stream Of hydra faction kicks the beam! This excellent imitation of the noble Lord's style shows how deeply Mr. Fudge must have studied his great original. Irish oratory, indeed, abounds with such startling peculiarities. Thus the eloquent Counsellor B?, in describing some hypocritical pretender to charity, said, “He put his hand in his breeches-pocket, like a crocodile, and,” &amp;c. &amp;c. Where the poor Palace changes masters Quicker than a snake its skin, And Louis is roll'd out on castors, While Boney's borne on shoulders in:— But where, in every change, no doubt, One special good your Lordship traces,— That 'tis the Kings alone turn out, The Ministers still keep their places. How oft, dear Viscount C?gh, I've thought of thee upon the way, As in my job (what place could be More apt to wake a thought of thee?)— Or, oftener far, when gravely sitting Upon my dicky, (as is fitting For him who writes a Tour, that he May more of men and manners see,) I've thought of thee and of thy glories, Thou guest of Kings, and King of Tories! Reflecting how thy fame has grown And spread, beyond man's usual share, At home, abroad, till thou art known, Like Major Semple, every where! And marv'lling with what pow'rs of breath Your Lordship, having speech'd to death Some hundreds of your fellow-men, Next speech'd to Sovereigns' ears,—and when All Sovereigns else were doz'd, at last Speech'd down the Sovereign The title of the chief magistrate of Belfast, before whom his Lordship (with the “studium immane loquendi” attributed by Ovid to that chattering and rapacious class of birds, the pies) delivered sundry long and self-gratulatory orations, on his return from the Continent. It was at one of these Irish dinners that his gallant brother, Lord S., proposed the health of “The best cavalry officer in Europe—the Regent!” of Belfast. Oh! mid the praises and the trophies Thou gain'st from Morosophs and Sophis; Mid all the tributes to thy fame, There's one thou should'st be chiefly pleas'd at— That Ireland gives her snuff thy name, And C?gh's the thing now sneez'd at! But hold, my pen!—a truce to praising— Though ev'n your Lordship will allow The theme's temptations are amazing; But time and ink run short, and now, (As thou wouldst say, my guide and teacher In these gay metaphoric fringes, I must embark into the feature On which this letter chiefly hinges Verbatim from one of the noble Viscount's Speeches— “And now, Sir, I must embark into the feature on which this question chiefly hinges.”;— My Book, the Book that is to prove— And will, (so help ye Sprites above, That sit on clouds, as grave as judges, Watching the labours of the Fudges!) Will prove that all the world, at present, Is in a state extremely pleasant; That Europe—thanks to royal swords And bay'nets, and the Duke commanding— Enjoys a peace which, like the Lord's, Passeth all human understanding: That France prefers her go-cart King To such a coward scamp as Boney; Though round, with each a leading-string, There standeth many a Royal crony, For fear the chubby, tottering thing Should fall, if left there loney-poney;— That England, too, the more her debts, The more she spends, the richer gets; And that the Irish, grateful nation! Remember when by thee reign'd over, And bless thee for their flagellation, As Heloisa did her lover! See her Letters.— That Poland, left for Russia's lunch Upon the side-board, snug reposes: While Saxony's as pleased as Punch, And Norway “on a bed of roses!” That, as for some few million souls, Transferr'd by contract, bless the clods! If half were strangled—Spaniards, Poles, And Frenchmen—'twouldn't make much odds, So Europe's goodly Royal ones Sit easy on their sacred thrones; So Ferdinand embroiders gaily It would be an edifying thing to write a history of the private amusements of sovereigns, tracing them down from the fly-sticking of Domitian, the mole-catching of Artabanus, the hog-mimicking of Parmenides, the horse-currying of Aretas, to the petticoat-embroidering of Ferdinand, and the patience-playing of the P?e R?t!, And Louis eats his salmi ??? ??, ??? ?????? ?????????? ????????

Oh Dick! you may talk of your writing and reading, Your Logic and Greek, but there's nothing like feeding; And this is the place for it, Dicky, you dog, Of all places on earth—the head-quarters of Prog! Talk of England—her famed Magna Charta, I swear, is A humbug, a flam, to the Carte The Bill of Fare.—Véry, a well-known Restaurateur. at old Véry's; And as for your Juries—who would not set o'er 'em A Jury of Tasters Mr. Bob alludes particularly, I presume, to the famous Jury Dégustateur, which used to assemble at the Hotel of M. Grimod de la Reynière, and of which this modern Archestratus has given an account in his Almanach des Gourmands, cinquième, année, p. 78., with woodcocks before 'em? Give Cartwright his Parliaments, fresh every year; But those friends of short Commons would never do here; And, let Romilly speak as he will on the question, No Digest of Law's like the laws of digestion! By the by, Dick, I fatten—but n'importe for that, 'Tis the mode—your Legitimates always get fat. There's the R?g?t, there's Louis—and Boney tried too, But, tho' somewhat imperial in paunch, 'twouldn't do:— He improv'd, indeed, much in this point, when he wed, But he ne'er grew right royally fat in the head. Dick, Dick, what a place is this Paris!—but stay— As my raptures may bore you, I'll just sketch a Day, As we pass it, myself and some comrades I've got, All thorough-bred Gnostics, who know what is what.

The process by which the liver of the unfortunate goose is enlarged, in order to produce that richest of all dainties, the foie gras, of which such renowned patés are made at Strasbourg and Toulouse, is thus described in the Cours Gastronomique: —“On déplume l'estomac des oies; on attache ensuite ces animaux aux chenets d'une cheminée, et on les nourrit devant le feu. La captivité et la chaleur donnent à ces volatiles, une maladie hépatique, qui fait gonfler leur foie,” &amp;c. p. 206. I rise—put on neck-cloth—stiff, tight, as can be— For a lad who goes into the world, Dick, like me, Should have his neck tied up, you know—there's no doubt of it— Almost as tight as some lads who go out of it. With whiskers well oil'd, and with boots that “hold up “The mirror to nature”—so bright you could sup Off the leather like china; with coat, too, that draws On the tailor, who suffers, a martyr's applause!— With head bridled up, like a four-in-hand leader, And stays—devil's in them—too tight for a feeder, I strut to the old Café Hardy, which yet Beats the field at a déjeûner à la fourchette. There, Dick, what a breakfast!—oh, not like your ghost Of a breakfast in England, your curst tea and toast Is Mr. Bob aware that his contempt for tea renders him liable to a charge of atheism? Such, at least, is the opinion cited in Christian, Falster. Amœnitat. Philolog.—“Atheum interpretabatur hominem ad herbâ The aversum.” He would not, I think, have been so irreverent to this beverage of scholars, if he had read Peter Petit's Poem in praise of Tea, addressed to the learned Huet—or the Epigraphe which Pechlinus wrote for an altar he meant to dedicate to this herb—or the Anacreontics of Peter Francius, in which he calls Tea ????, ????, ???????.

Which may be thus translated:— Yes, let Hebe, ever young, High in heav'n her nectar hold, And to Jove's immortal throng Pour the tide in cups of gold— I'll not envy heaven's Princes, While, with snowy hands, for me, Kate the china tea-cup rinses, And pours out her best Bohea!; But a side-board, you dog, where one's eye roves about, Like a Turk's in the Haram, and thence singles out One's paté of larks, just to tune up the throat, One's small limbs of chickens, done en papillote, One's erudite cutlets, drest all ways but plain, Or one's kidneys—imagine, Dick—done with champagne!

This repast being ended, and paid for—(how odd! Till a man's us'd to paying, there's something so queer in't!)— The sun now well out, and the girls all abroad, And the world enough air'd for us, Nobs, to appear in't, We lounge up the Boulevards, where—oh, Dick, the phyzzes, The turn-outs, we meet—what a nation of quizzes! Here toddles along some old figure of fun, With a coat you might date Anno Domini 1.; A lac'd hat, worsted stockings, and—noble old soul! A fine ribbon and cross in his best button-hole; Just such as our Pr?ce, who nor reason nor fun dreads, Inflicts, without ev'n a court-martial, on hundreds. It was said by Wicquefort, more than a hundred years ago, “Le Roi d'Angleterre fait seul plus de chevaliers que tous les autres Rois de la Chrétienté ensemble.”—What would he say now? Here trips a grisette, with a fond, roguish eye, (Rather eatable things these grisettes by the by); And there an old demoiselle, almost as fond, In a silk that has stood since the time of the Fronde. There goes a French Dandy—ah, Dick! unlike some ones We've seen about White's—the Mounseers are but rum ones; Such hats!—fit for monkies—I'd back Mrs. Draper To cut neater weather-boards out of brown paper: And coats—how I wish, if it wouldn't distress 'em, They'd club for old Br?mm?l, from Calais, to dress 'em! The collar sticks out from the neck such a space, That you'd swear 'twas the plan of this head-lopping nation, To leave there behind them a snug little place For the head to drop into, on decapitation. In short, what with mountebanks, counts, and friseurs, Some mummers by trade, and the rest amateurs— What with captains in new jockey-boots and silk breeches, Old dustmen with swinging great opera-hats, And shoeblacks reclining by statues in niches, There never was seen such a race of Jack Sprats! From the Boulevards—but hearken!—yes—as I'm a sinner, The clock is just striking the half-hour to dinner: So no more at present—short time for adorning— My Day must be finish'd some other fine morning. Now, hey for old Beauvilliers' A celebrated restaurateur. larder, my boy! And, once there, if the Goddess of Beauty and Joy Were to write “Come and kiss me, dear Bob!” I'd not budge— Not a step, Dick, as sure as my name is R. Fudge. LETTER IV. FROM PHELIM CONNOR TO ?. “Return!”—no, never, while the withering hand Of bigot power is on that hapless land; While, for the faith my fathers held to God, Ev'n in the fields where free those fathers trod, I am proscrib'd, and—like the spot left bare In Israel's halls, to tell the proud and fair Amidst their mirth, that Slavery had been there— “They used to leave a yard square of the wall of the house unplastered, on which they write, in large letters, either the fore-mentioned verse of the Psalmist (‘If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,’ &amp;c.) or the words—‘The memory of the desolation.’” —Leo of Modena. On all I love, home, parents, friends, I trace The mournful mark of bondage and disgrace! No!—let them stay, who in their country's pangs See nought but food for factions and harangues; Who yearly kneel before their masters' doors, And hawk their wrongs, as beggars do their sores: I have thought it prudent to omit some parts of Mr. Phelim Connor's letter. He is evidently an intemperate young man, and has associated with his cousins, the Fudges, to very little purpose.Still let your Still hope and suffer, all who can!—but I, Who durst not hope, and cannot bear, must fly. But whither?—every-where the scourge pursues— Turn where he will, the wretched wanderer views, In the bright, broken hopes of all his race, Countless reflections of th' Oppressor's face. Every where gallant hearts, and spirits true, Are serv'd up victims to the vile and few; While E?gl?d, every where—the general foe Of Truth and Freedom, wheresoe'er they glow— Is first, when tyrants strike, to aid the blow. Oh, E?gl?d! could such poor revenge atone For wrongs, that well might claim the deadliest one; Were it a vengeance, sweet enough to sate The wretch who flies from thy intolerant hate, To hear his curses on such barbarous sway Echoed, where'er he bends his cheerless way;— Could this content him, every lip he meets Teems for his vengeance with such poisonous sweets; Were this his luxury, never is thy name Pronounc'd, but he doth banquet on thy shame; Hears maledictions ring from every side Upon that grasping power, that selfish pride, Which vaunts its own, and scorns all rights beside; That low and desperate envy, which to blast A neighbour's blessings, risks the few thou hast;— That monster, Self, too gross to be conceal'd, Which ever lurks behind thy proffer'd shield;— That faithless craft, which, in thy hour of need, Can court the slave, can swear he shall be freed, Yet basely spurns him, when thy point is gain'd, Back to his masters, ready gagg'd and chain'd! Worthy associate of that band of Kings, That royal, rav'ning flock, whose vampire wings O'er sleeping Europe treacherously brood, And fan her into dreams of promis'd good, Of hope, of freedom—but to drain her blood! If thus to hear thee branded be a bliss That Vengeance loves, there's yet more sweet than this, That 'twas an Irish head, an Irish heart, Made thee the fall'n and tarnish'd thing thou art; That, as the centaur ? Membra et Herculeos toros Urit lues Nessea. ? Ille, ille victor vincitur.Senec. Hercul. Œt. gave th' infected vest In which he died, to rack his conqueror's breast, We sent thee C?gh:—as heaps of dead Have slain their slayers by the pest they spread, So hath our land breath'd out, thy fame to dim, Thy strength to waste, and rot thee, soul and limb, Her worst infections all condens'd in him! When will the world shake off such yokes? oh, when Will that redeeming day shine out on men, That shall behold them rise, erect and free As Heav'n and Nature meant mankind should be! When Reason shall no longer blindly bow To the vile pagod things, that o'er her brow, Like him of Jaghernaut, drive trampling now; Nor Conquest dare to desolate God's earth; Nor drunken Victory, with a Nero's mirth, Strike her lewd harp amidst a people's groans;— But, built on love, the world's exalted thrones Shall to the virtuous and the wise be given— Those bright, those sole Legitimates of Heaven! When will this be?—or, oh! is it, in truth, But one of those sweet, day-break dreams of youth, In which the Soul, as round her morning springs, 'Twixt sleep and waking, sees such dazzling things! And must the hope, as vain as it is bright, Be all resigned?—and are they only right, Who say this world of thinking souls was made To be by Kings partition'd, truck'd, and weigh'd In scales that, ever since the world begun, Have counted millions but as dust to one? Are they the only wise, who laugh to scorn The rights, the freedom to which man was born? Who Who, proud to kiss each separate rod of power, Bless, while he reigns, the minion of the hour; Worship each would-be God, that o'er them moves, And take the thundering of his brass for Jove's! If this be wisdom, then farewell, my books, Farewell, ye shrines of old, ye classic brooks, Which fed my soul with currents, pure and fair, Of living Truth, that now must stagnate there!— Instead of themes that touch the lyre with light, Instead of Greece, and her immortal fight For Liberty, which once awak'd my strings, Welcome the Grand Conspiracy of Kings, The High Legitimates, the Holy Band, Who, bolder ev'n than He of Sparta's land, Against whole millions, panting to be free, Would guard the pass of right-line tyranny. Instead of him, th' Athenian bard, whose blade Had stood the onset which his pen pourtray'd, Welcome And, 'stead of Aristides—woe the day Such names should mingle!—welcome C?gh! Here break we off, at this unhallow'd name The late Lord C. of Ireland had a curious theory about names;—he held that every man with three names was a jacobin. His instances in Ireland were numerous:—viz. Archibald Hamilton Rowan, Theobald Wolfe Tone, James Napper Tandy, John Philpot Curran, &amp;c. &amp;c. and, in England, he produced as examples Charles James Fox, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, John Horne Tooke, Francis Burdett Jones, &amp;c. &amp;c. The Romans called a thief “homo trium literarum.” Tun' trium literarum homo Me vituperas? Fur. Dissaldeus supposes this word to be a glossema:—that is, he thinks “Fur” has made his escape from the margin into the text. Plautus, Aulular. Act ii. Scene 4. Like priests of old, when words ill-omen'd came. My next shall tell thee, bitterly shall tell, Thoughts that Thoughts that—could patience hold—'twere wiser far To leave still hid and burning where they are. LETTER V. FROM MISS BIDDY FUDGE TO MISS DOROTHY ?. What a time since I wrote!—I'm a sad, naughty girl— For, though, like a tee-totum, I'm all in a twirl;— Yet ev'n (as you wittily say) a tee-totum Between all its twirls gives a letter to note 'em. But, Lord, such a place! and then, Dolly, my dresses, My gowns, so divine!—there's no language expresses, Except just the two words “superbe,” “magnifique,” The trimmings of that which I had home last week! It is call'd—I forget—à la—something which sounded Like alicampane—but, in truth, I'm confounded And bother'd, my dear, 'twixt that troublesome boy's (Bob's) cookery language, and Madame le Roi's: What with fillets of roses, and fillets of veal, Things garni with lace, and things garni with eel, One's hair and one's cutlets both en papillote, And a thousand more things I shall ne'er have by rote, I can scarce tell the diff'rence, at least as to phrase, Between beef à la Psyche and curls à la braise.— But, in short, dear, I'm trick'd out quite à la Francaise, With my bonnet—so beautiful!—high up and poking, Like things that are put to keep chimnies from smoking. Where shall I begin with the endless delights Of this Eden of milliners, monkies, and sights— This dear busy place, where there's nothing transacting But dressing and dinnering, dancing and acting? Imprimis, the Opera—mercy, my ears! Brother Bobby's remark, t'other night, was a true one;— “This must be the music,” said he, “of the spears, “For I'm curst if each note of it doesn't run through one!” Pa says (and you know, love, his Book's to make out 'Twas the Jacobins brought every mischief about) That this passion for roaring has come in of late, Since the rabble all tried for a voice in the State.— What a frightful idea, one's mind to o'erwhelm! What a chorus, dear Dolly, would soon be let loose of it, If, when of age, every man in the realm Had a voice like old Laïs The oldest, most celebrated, and most noisy of the singers at the French Opera., and chose to make use of it! No—never was known in this riotous sphere Such a breach of the peace as their singing, my dear. So bad too, you'd swear that the God of both arts, Of Music and Physic, had taken a frolic For setting a loud fit of asthma in parts, And composing a fine rumbling base to a cholic! But, the dancing—ah parlez-moi, Dolly, de ca— There, indeed, is a treat that charms all but Papa. Such beauty—such grace—oh ye sylphs of romance! Fly, fly to Titania, and ask her if she has One light-footed nymph in her train, that can dance Like divine Bigottini and sweet Fanny Bias! Fanny Bias in Flora—dear creature!—you'd swear, When her delicate feet in the dance twinkle round, That her steps are of light, that her home is the air, And she only par complaisance touches the ground. And when Bigottini in Psyche dishevels Her black flowing hair, and by dæmons is driven, Oh! who does not envy those rude little devils, That hold her and hug her, and keep her from heaven? Then, the music—so softly its cadences die, So divinely—oh, Dolly! between you and I, It's as well for my peace that there's nobody nigh To make love to me then—you've a soul, and can judge What a crisis 'twould be for your friend Biddy Fudge! The next place (which Bobby has near lost his heart in) They call it the Play-house—I think—of St. Martin The Théâtre de la Porte St. Martin, which was built when the Opera House in the Palais Royal was burned down, in 1781.—A few days after this dreadful fire, which lasted more than a week, and in which several persons perished, the Parisian élégantes displayed flame-coloured dresses, “couleur de feu d'Opéra!” —Dulaure, Curiosités de Paris. Quite charming—and very religious—what folly To say that the French are not pious, dear Dolly, When here one beholds, so correctly and rightly, The Testament turn'd into melo-drames nightly “The Old Testament,” says the theatrical Critic in the Gazette de France, “is a mine of gold for the managers of our small play-houses. A multitude crowd round the Théâtre de la Gaieté every evening to see the Passage of the Red Sea.” In the play-bill of one of these sacred melo-drames at Vienna, we find “The Voice of G?d, by M. Schwartz.”; And, doubtless, so fond they're of scriptural facts, They will soon get the Pentateuch up in five acts. Here Daniel, in pantomime A piece very popular last year, called “Daniel, ou La Fosse aux Lions.” The following scene will give an idea of the daring sublimity of these scriptural pantomimes. “Scene 20.—La fournaise devient un berceau de nuages azurés, au fond duquel est un grouppe de nuages plus lumineux, et au milieu ‘Jehovah’ au centre d'un cercle de rayons brillans, qui annonce la présence de l'Éternel.”, bids bold defiance To Nebuchadnezzar and all his stuff'd lions, While pretty young Israelites dance round the Prophet, In very thin clothing, and but little of it;— Here Bégrand Madame Bégrand, a finely formed woman, who acts in “Susanna and the Elders,”—“L'Amour et la Folie,” &amp;c. &amp;c, who shines in this scriptural path, As the lovely Susanna, without ev'n a relic Of drapery round her, comes out of the bath In a manner that, Bob says, is quite Eve-angelic! But in short, dear, 'twould take me a month to recite All the exquisite places we're at, day and night; And, besides, ere I finish, I think you'll be glad Just to hear one delightful adventure I've had. Last night, at the Beaujon The Promenades Aëriennes, or French Mountains.— See a description of this singular and fantastic place of amusement in a pamphlet, truly worthy of it, by “F. F. Cotterel. Médecin, Docteur de la Faculté de Paris,” &amp;c. &amp;c., a place where—I doubt If its charms I can paint—there are cars, that set out From a lighted pavilion, high up in the air, And rattle you down Doll—you hardly know where. These vehicles, mind me, in which you go through This delightfully dangerous journey, hold two. Some cavalier asks, with humility, whether You'll venture down with him—you smile—'tis a match; In an instant you're seated, and down both together Go thund'ring, as if you went post to old scratch! According to Dr. Cotterel the cars go at the rate of forty-eight miles an hour. Well, it was but last night, as I stood and remark'd On the looks and odd ways of the girls who embark'd, The impatience of some for the perilous flight, The forc'd giggle of others, 'twixt pleasure and fright,— That there came up—imagine, dear Doll, if you can— A fine sallow, sublime, sort of Werter-fac'd man, With mustachios that gave (what we read of so oft) The dear Corsair expression, half savage, half soft, As Hyænas in love may be fancied to look, or A something between Abelard and old Blucher! Up he came, Doll, to me, and, uncovering his head, (Rather bald, but so warlike!) in bad English said, “Ah! my dear—if Ma'mselle vil be so very good— Just for von littel course”—though I scarce understood What he wish'd me to do, I said, thank him, I would. Off we set—and, though 'faith, dear, I hardly knew whether My head or my heels were the uppermost then, For 'twas like heav'n and earth, Dolly, coming together,— Yet, spite of the danger, we dar'd it again. And oh! as I gaz'd on the features and air Of the man, who for me all this peril defied, I could fancy almost he and I were a pair Of unhappy young lovers, who thus, side by side, Were taking, instead of rope, pistol, or dagger, a Desperate dash down the falls of Niagara! This achiev'd, through the gardens In the Café attached to these gardens there are to be (as Doctor Cotterel informs us) “douze nègres, très-alertes, qui contrasteront par l'ébène de leur peau avec le teint de lis et de roses de nos belles. Les glaces et les sorbets, servis par une main bien noire, fera davantage ressortir l'albâtre des bras arrondis de celles-ci.”—P. 22. we saunter'd about, Saw the fire-works, exclaim'd “magnifique!” at each cracker, And, when 'twas all o'er, the dear man saw us out With the air I will say, of a Prince, to our fiacre. Now, hear me—this Stranger—it may be mere folly— But who do you think we all think it is, Dolly? Why, bless you, no less than the great King of Prussia, Who's here now incog. His Majesty, who was at Paris under the travelling name of Count Ruppin, is known to have gone down the Beaujon very frequently.—he, who made such a fuss, you Remember, in London, with Blucher and Platoff, When Sal was near kissing old Blucher's cravat off! Pa says he's come here to look after his money, (Not taking things now as he us'd under Boney,) Which suits with our friend, for Bob saw him, he swore, Looking sharp to the silver receiv'd at the door. Besides, too, they say that his grief for his Queen (Which was plain in this sweet fellow's face to be seen) Requires such a stimulant dose as this car is, Us'd three times a day with young ladies in Paris. Some Doctor, indeed, has declar'd that such grief Should—unless 'twould to utter despairing its folly push— Fly to the Beaujon, and there seek relief By rattling, as Bob says, “like shot through a holly-bush.” I must now bid adieu;—only think, Dolly, think If this should be the King—I have scarce slept a wink With imagining how it will sound in the papers, And how all the Misses my good luck will grudge, When they read that Count Ruppin, to drive away vapours, Has gone down the Beaujon with Miss Biddy Fudge. Nota Bene.—Papa's almost certain 'tis he— For he knows the Legitimate cut, and could see, In the way he went poising and manag'd to tower So erect in the car, the true Balance of Power. LETTER VI. FROM PHIL. FUDGE, ESQ. TO HIS BROTHER TIM FUDGE, ESQ. BARRISTER AT LAW. Yours of the 12th receiv'd just now— Thanks for the hint, my trusty brother! 'Tis truly pleasing to see how We, Fudges, stand by one another. But never fear—I know my chap, And he knows me too—verbum sap. My Lord and I are kindred spirits, Like in our ways as two young ferrets; Both fashion'd, as that supple race is, To twist into all sorts of places;— Creatures lengthy, lean, and hungering, Fond of blood and burrow-mongering. As to my Book in 91, Call'd “Down with Kings, or, Who'd have thought it?” Bless you, the Book's long dead and gone,— Not ev'n th' Attorney-General bought it. And, though some few seditious tricks I play'd in 95 and 6, As you remind me in your letter, His Lordship likes me all the better;— We proselytes, that come with news full, Are, as he says, so vastly useful! Reynolds and I—(you know Tom Reynolds— Drinks his claret, keeps his chaise— Lucky the dog that first unkennels Traitors and Luddites now-a-days; Or who can help to bag a few, When S?d?th wants a death or two;) Reynolds and I, and some few more, All men, like us, of information, Friends, whom his Lordship keeps in store, As under-saviours of the nation— Lord C.'s tribute to the character of his friend, Mr. Reynolds, will long be remembered with equal credit to both. Have form'd a Club this season, where His Lordship sometimes takes the chair, And gives us many a bright oration In praise of our sublime vocation; Tracing it up to great King Midas, Who, though in fable typified as A royal Ass, by grace divine And right of ears, most asinine, Was yet no more, in fact historical, Than an exceeding well-bred tyrant; And these, his ears, but allegorical, Meaning Informers, kept at high rent This interpretation of the fable of Midas's ears seems the most probable of any, and is thus stated in Hoffmann:— “Hâc allegoriâ significatum, Midam, utpote tynannum, subauscultatores dimittere solitum, per quos, quæcunque per omnem regionem vel fierent, vel dicerentur, cognosceret, nimirum illis utens aurium vice.”— Gem'men, who touch'd the Treasury glisteners, Like us, for being trusty listeners; And picking up each tale and fragment, For royal Midas's Green Bag meant. “And wherefore,” said this best of Peers, “Should not the R?g?t too have ears Brossette, in a note on this line of Boileau, “Midas, le Roi Midas, a des oreilles d'Ane,” tells us, that “M. Perrault le Médecin voulut faire à notre auteur un crime d'état de ce vers, comme d'une maligne allusion au Roi.” I trust, however, that no one will suspect the line in the text of any such indecorous allusion., “To reach as far, as long and wide as “Those of his model, good King Midas?” This speech was thought extremely good, And (rare for him) was understood— Instant we drank “The R?g?t's Ears,” With three times three illustrious cheers, Which made the room resound like thunder— “The R?g?t's Ears, and may he ne'er “From foolish shame, like Midas, wear “Old paltry wigs to keep them under!” It was not under wigs, but tiaras, that King Midas endeavoured to conceal these appendages: Tempora purpureis tentat velare tiaris. Ovid. The Noble Giver of the toast, however, had evidently, with his usual clearness, confounded King Midas, Mr. Liston, and the P?e R?g?t together. This touch at our old friends, the Whigs, Made us as merry all as grigs. In short (I'll thank you not to mention These things again), we get on gaily; And, thanks to pension and Suspension, Our little Club increases daily. Castles, and Oliver, and such, Who don't as yet full salary touch, Nor keep their chaise and pair, nor buy Houses and lands, like Tom and I, Of course don't rank with us, salvators Mr. Fudge and his friends ought to go by this name— as the man who, some years since, saved the late Right Hon. George Rose from drowning, was ever after called Salvator Rosa., But merely serve the Club as waiters. Like Knights, too, we've our collar days, (For us, I own, an awkward phrase,) When, in our new costume adorn'd,— The R?g?t's buff-and-blue coats turn'd— We have the honour to give dinners To the chief Rats in upper stations This intimacy between the Rats and Informers is just as it should be—“verè dulce sodalitium.”; Your W?ys, V?ns,—half-fledg'd sinners, Who shame us by their imitations; Who turn, 'tis true—but what of that? Give me the useful peaching Rat; Not things as mute as Punch, when bought, Whose wooden heads are all they've brought; Who, false enough to shirk their friends, But too faint-hearted to betray, Are, after all their twists and bends, But souls in Limbo, damn'd half way. No, no, we nobler vermin are A genus useful as we're rare; 'Midst all the things miraculous Of which your natural histories brag, The rarest must be Rats like us, Who let the cat out of the bag. Yet still these Tyros in the cause Deserve, I own, no small applause; And they're by us receiv'd and treated With all due honours—only seated In th' inverse scale of their reward, The merely promis'd next my Lord; Small pensions then, and so on, down, Rat after rat, they graduate Through job, red ribbon, and silk gown, To Chanc'llorship and Marquisate. This serves to nurse the ratting spirit; The less the bribe the more the merit. Our music's good, you may be sure; My Lord, you know, 's an amateur His Lordship, during one of the busiest periods of his Ministerial career, took lessons three times a week from a celebrated music-master, in glee-singing.— Takes every part with perfect ease, Though to the Base by nature suited; And, form'd for all, as best may please, For whips and bolts, or chords and keys, Turns from his victims to his glees, And has them both well executed. How amply these two propensities of the Noble Lord would have been gratified among that ancient people of Etruria, who, as Aristotle tells us, used to whip their slaves once a year to the sound of flutes! H?t?d, who, tho' no Rat himself, Delights in all such liberal arts, Drinks largely to the House of Guelph, And superintends the Corni parts. While C?nn?g This Right Hon. Gentleman ought to give up his present alliance with Lord C., if upon no other principle than that which is inculcated in the following arrangement between two Ladies of Fashion:— Says Clarinda, “though tears it may cost, It is time we should part, my dear Sue; For your character's totally lost, And I have not sufficient for two!”, who'd be first by choice, Consents to take an under voice; And Gr?v?s The rapidity of this Noble Lord's transformation, at the same instant, into a Lord of the Bed-chamber and an opponent of the Catholic Claims, was truly miraculous., who well that signal knows, Watches the Volti Subitos. Turn instantly—a frequent direction in music-books. In short, as I've already hinted, We take, of late, prodigiously; But as our Club is somewhat stinted For Gentlemen, like Tom and me, We'll take it kind if you'll provide A few Squireens The Irish diminutive of Squire. from 'tother side;— Some of those loyal, cunning elves (We often tell the tale with laughter), Who us'd to hide the pikes themselves, Then hang the fools who found them after. I doubt not you could find us, too, Some Orange Parsons that might do; Among the rest, we've heard of one, The Reverend—something—Hamilton, Who stuff'd a figure of himself (Delicious thought!) and had it shot at, To bring some Papists to the shelf, That couldn't otherwise be got at— If he'll but join the Association, We'll vote him in by acclamation. And now, my brother, guide, and friend, This somewhat tedious crawl must end. I've gone into this long detail, Because I saw your nerves were shaken With anxious fears lest I should fail In this new, loyal, course I've taken. But, bless your heart! you need not doubt— We, Fudges, know what we're about. Look round, and say if you can see A much more thriving family. There's Jack, the Doctor—night and day Hundreds of patients so besiege him, You'd swear that all the rich and gay Fell sick on purpose to oblige him. And while they think, the precious ninnies, He's counting o'er their pulse so steady, The rogue but counts how many guineas He's fobb'd, for that day's work, already. I'll ne'er forget th' old maid's alarm, When, feeling thus Miss Sukey Flirt, he Said, as he dropp'd her shrivell'd arm, “Damn'd bad this morning—only thirty!” Your dowagers, too, every one, So gen'rous are, when they call him in, That he might now retire upon The rheumatisms of three old women. Then, whatsoe'er your ailments are, He can so learnedly explain ye 'em— Your cold, of course, is a catarrh, Your headach is a hemi-cranium:— His skill, too, in young ladies' lungs, The grace with which, most mild of men, He begs them to put out their tongues, Then bids them—put them in again: In short, there's nothing now like Jack!— Take all your doctors great and small, Of present times and ages back, Dear Doctor Fudge is worth them all. So much for physic—then, in law too, Counsellor Tim, to thee we bow; Not one of us gives more eclat to Th' immortal name of Fudge than thou. Not to expatiate on the art With which you play'd the patriot's part, Till something good and snug should offer;— Like one, who, by the way he acts Th' enlight'ning part of candle-snuffer, The manager's keen eye attracts, And is promoted thence by him To strut in robes, like thee, my Tim!— Who shall describe thy pow'rs of face, Thy well-fee'd zeal in every case, Or wrong or right—but ten times warmer (As suits thy calling) in the former— Thy glorious, lawyer-like delight In puzzling all that's clear and right, Which, though conspicuous in thy youth, Improves so with a wig and band on, That all thy pride's to waylay Truth, And leave her not a leg to stand on. Thy patent, prime, morality,— Thy cases, cited from the Bible— Thy candour, when it falls to thee To help in trouncing for a libel;— “God knows, I, from my soul, profess “To hate all bigots and benighters! “God knows, I love, to ev'n excess, “The sacred Freedom of the Press, “My only aim's to—crush the writers.” These are the virtues, Tim, that draw The briefs into thy bag so fast; And these, oh Tim—if Law be Law— Will raise thee to the Bench at last. I blush to see this letter's length— But 'twas my wish to prove to thee How full of hope, and wealth, and strength, Are all our precious family. And, should affairs go on as pleasant As, thank the Fates, they do at present— Should we but still enjoy the sway Of S?dm?h and of C?gh, I hope, ere long, to see the day When England's wisest statesmen, judges, Lawyers, peers, will all be—Fudges! Good-bye—my paper's out so nearly, I've only room for Yours sincerely. LETTER VII. FROM PHELIM CONNOR TO ?. Before we sketch the Present—let us cast A few, short, rapid glances to the Past. When he, who had defied all Europe's strength, Beneath his own weak rashness sunk at length;— When, loos'd, as if by magic, from a chain That seem'd like Fate's, the world was free again, And Europe saw, rejoicing in the sight, The cause of Kings, for once, the cause of Right;— Then was, indeed, an hour of joy to those Who sigh'd for justice—liberty—repose, And hop'd the fall of one great vulture's nest Would ring its warning round, and scare the rest. All then was bright with promise;—Kings began To own a sympathy with suffering Man, And Man was grateful; Patriots of the South Caught wisdom from a Cossack Emperor's mouth, And heard, like accents thaw'd in Northern air, Unwonted words of freedom burst forth there! Who did not hope, in that triumphant time, When monarchs, after years of spoil and crime, Met round the shrine of Peace, and Heav'n look'd on,— Who did not hope the lust of spoil was gone; That that rapacious spirit, which had play'd The game of Pilnitz o'er so oft, was laid; And Europe's Rulers, conscious of the past, Would blush, and deviate into right at last? But no—the hearts, that nurs'd a hope so fair, Had yet to learn what men on thrones can dare; Had yet to know, of all earth's ravening things, The only quite untameable are Kings! Scarce had they met when, to its nature true, The instinct of their race broke out anew; Promises, treaties, charters, all were vain, And “Rapine! rapine!” was the cry again. How quick they carv'd their victims, and how well, Let Saxony, let injur'd Genoa tell;— Let all the human stock that, day by day, Was, at that Royal slave-mart, truck'd away,— The million souls that, in the face of heaven, Were split to fractions “Whilst the Congress was re-constructing Europe—not according to rights, natural affiances, language, habits, or laws; but by tables of finance, which divided and subdivided her population into souls, demi-souls, and even fractions, according to a scale of the direct duties or taxes, which could be levied by the acquiring state,” &amp;c. —Sketch of the Military and Political Power of Russia. The words on the protocol are ames, demi-ames, &amp;c., barter'd, sold, or given To swell some despot Power, too huge before, And weigh down Europe with one Mammoth more. How safe the faith of Kings let France decide;— Her charter broken, ere its ink had dried;— Her Press enthrall'd—her Reason mock'd again With all the monkery it had spurn'd in vain; Her crown disgrac'd by one, who dar'd to own He thank'd not France but England for his throne; Her triumphs cast into the shade by those, Who had grown old among her bitterest foes, And now return'd, beneath her conquerors' shields, Unblushing slaves! to claim her heroes' fields; To tread down every trophy of her fame, And curse that glory which to them was shame!— Let these—let all the damning deeds, that then Were dar'd through Europe, cry aloud to men, With voice like that of crashing ice that rings Round Alpine huts, the perfidy of Kings; And tell the world, when hawks shall harmless bear The shrinking dove, when wolves shall learn to spare The helpless victim for whose blood they lusted, Then, and then only, monarchs may be trusted. It could not last—these horrors could not last— France would herself have ris'n, in might, to cast Th' insulters off—and oh! that then, as now, Chain'd to some distant islet's rocky brow, Napoleon ne'er had come to force, to blight, Ere half matur'd, a cause so proudly bright;— To palsy patriot arts with doubt and shame, And write on Freedom's flag a despot's name;— To rush into the lists, unask'd, alone, And make the stake of all the game of one! Then would the world have seen again what power A people can put forth in Freedom's hour; Then would the fire of France once more have blaz'd;— For every single sword, reluctant rais'd In the stale cause of an oppressive throne, Millions would then have leap'd forth in her own; And never, never had th' unholy stain Of Bourbon feet disgrac'd her shores again. But fate decreed not so—th' Imperial Bird, That, in his neighbouring cage, unfear'd, unstirr'd, Had seem'd to sleep with head beneath his wing, Yet watch'd the moment for a daring spring;— Well might he watch, when deeds were done, that made His own transgressions whiten in their shade; Well might he hope a world, thus trampled o'er By clumsy tyrants, would be his once more:— Forth from his cage the eagle burst to light, From steeple on to steeple “L'aigle volera de clocher en clocher, jusqu'aux tours de Notre-Dame.”—Napoleon's Proclamation on landing from Elba. wing'd his flight, With calm and easy grandeur, to that throne From which a Royal craven just had flown; And resting there, as in his ærie, furl'd Those wings, whose very rustling shook the world! What was your fury then, ye crown'd array, Whose feast of spoil, whose plundering holiday Was thus broke up, in all its greedy mirth, By one bold chieftain's stamp on Gallic earth! Fierce was the cry, and fulminant the ban,— “Assassinate, who will—enchain, who can, “The vile, the faithless, outlaw'd, low-born man!” “Faithless!”—and this from you—from you, forsooth, Ye pious Kings, pure paragons of truth, Whose honesty all knew, for all had tried; Whose true Swiss zeal had serv'd on every side; Whose fame for breaking faith so long was known, Well might ye claim the craft as all your own, And lash your lordly tails, and fume to see Such low-born apes of Royal perfidy! Yes—yes—to you alone did it belong To sin for ever, and yet ne'er do wrong.— The frauds, the lies of Lords legitimate Are but fine policy, deep strokes of state; But let some upstart dare to soar so high In Kingly craft, and “outlaw” is the cry! What, though long years of mutual treachery Had peopled full your diplomatic shelves With ghosts of treaties, murder'd 'mong yourselves; Though each by turns was knave and dupe—what then? A Holy League would set all straight again; Like Juno's virtue, which a dip or two In some bless'd fountain made as good as new! Singulis annis in quodam Atticæ fonte lota virginitatem recuperâsse fingitur. Most faithful Russia—faithful to whoe'er Could plunder best, and give him amplest share; Who, ev'n when vanquish'd, sure to gain his ends, For want of foes to rob, made free with friends At the Peace of Tilsit, where he abandoned his ally, Prussia, to France, and received a portion of her territory., And, deepening still by amiable gradations, When foes were stript of all, then fleec'd relations! The seizure of Finland from his relative of Sweden. Most mild and saintly Prussia—steep'd to th' ears In persecuted Poland's blood and tears, And now, with all her harpy wings outspread O'er sever'd Saxony's devoted head! Pure Austria too—whose hist'ry nought repeats But broken leagues and subsidiz'd defeats; Whose faith, as Prince, extinguish'd Venice shows, Whose faith, as man, a widow'd daughter knows! And thou, oh England—who, though once as shy As cloister'd maids, of shame or perfidy, Art now broke in, and, thanks to C?gh, In all that's worst and falsest lead'st the way! Such was the pure divan, whose pens and wits Th' escape from Elba frighten'd into fits;— Such were the saints, who doom'd Napoleon's life, In virtuous frenzy, to th' assassin's knife. Disgusting crew!—who would not gladly fly To open, downright, bold-fac'd tyranny, To honest guilt, that dares do all but lie, From the false, juggling craft of men like these, Their canting crimes and varnish'd villanies;— These Holy Leaguers, who then loudest boast Of faith and honour, when they've stain'd them most; From whose affection men should shrink as loath As from their hate, for they'll be fleec'd by both; Who, ev'n while plund'ring, forge Religion's name To frank their spoil, and, without fear or shame, Call down the Holy Trinity The usual preamble of these flagitious compacts. In the same spirit, Catherine, after the dreadful massacre of Warsaw, ordered a solemn “thanksgiving to God in all the churches, for the blessings conferred upon the Poles;” and commanded that each of them should “swear fidelity and loyalty to her, and to shed in her defence the last drop of their blood, as they should answer for it to God, and his terrible judgment, kissing the holy word and cross of their Saviour!” to bless Partition leagues, and deeds of devilishness! But hold—enough—soon would this swell of rage O'erflow the boundaries of my scanty page;— So, here I pause—farewell—another day, Return we to those Lords of pray'r and prey, Whose loathsome cant, whose frauds by right divine Deserve a lash—oh! weightier far than mine! LETTER VIII. FROM MR. BOB FUDGE TO RICHARD ?, ESQ. Dear Dick, while old Donaldson's An English tailor at Paris. mending my stays,— Which I knew would go smash with me one of these days, And, at yesterday's dinner, when, full to the throttle, We lads had begun our dessert with a bottle Of neat old Constantia, on my leaning back Just to order another, by Jove I went crack!— Or, as honest Tom said, in his nautical phrase, “D?n my eyes, Bob, in doubling the Cape you've miss'd stays.” A ship is said to miss stays, when she does not obey the helm in tacking. So, of course, as no gentleman's seen out without them, They're now at the Schneider's The dandy term for a tailor.—and, while he's about them, Here goes for a letter, post-haste, neck and crop. Let us see—in my last I was—where did I stop? Oh, I know—at the Boulevards, as motley a road as Man ever would wish a day's lounging upon; With its cafés and gardens, hotels and pagodas, Its founts, and old Counts sipping beer in the sun: With its houses of all architectures you please, From the Grecian and Gothic, Dick, down by degrees To the pure Hottentot, or the Brighton Chinese; Where in temples antique you may breakfast or dinner it, Lunch at a mosque, and see Punch from a minaret. Then, Dick, the mixture of bonnets and bowers, Of foliage and frippery, fiacres and flowers, Green-grocers, green gardens—one hardly knows whether 'Tis country or town, they're so mess'd up together! And there, if one loves the romantic, one sees Jew clothes-men, like shepherds, reclin'd under trees; Or Quidnuncs, on Sunday, just fresh from the barber's, Enjoying their news and groseille “Lemonade and eau-de-groseille are measured out at every corner of every street, from fantastic vessels, jingling with bells, to thirsty tradesmen or wearied messengers.”—See Lady Morgan's lively description of the streets of Paris, in her very amusing work upon France, book vi. in those arbours; While gaily their wigs, like the tendrils, are curling, And founts of red currant-juice These gay, portable fountains, from which the groseille water is administered, are among the most characteristic ornaments of the streets of Paris. round them are purling. Here, Dick, arm in arm as we chattering stray, And receive a few civil “God-dems” by the way,— For, 'tis odd, these mounseers,—though we've wasted our wealth And our strength, till we've thrown ourselves into a phthisic, To cram down their throats an old King for their health, As we whip little children to make them take physic;— Yet, spite of our good-natur'd money and slaughter, They hate us, as Beelzebub hates holy-water! But who the deuce cares, Dick, as long as they nourish us Neatly as now, and good cookery flourishes— Long as, by bay'nets protected, we, Natties, May have our full fling at their salmis and pâtés? And, truly, I always declar'd 'twould be pity To burn to the ground such a choice-feeding city. Had Dad but his way, he'd have long ago blown The whole batch to old Nick—and the people, I own, If for no other cause than their curst monkey looks, Well deserve a blow-up—but then, damn it, their Cooks! As to Marshals, and Statesmen, and all their whole lineage, For aught that I care, you may knock them to spinage; But think, Dick, their Cooks—what a loss to mankind! What a void in the world would their art leave behind! Their chronometer spits—their intense salamanders— Their ovens—their pots, that can soften old ganders, All vanish'd for ever—their miracles o'er, And the Marmite Perpétuelle “Cette merveilleuse Marmite Perpétuelle, sur le feu depuis près d'un siècle; qui a donné le jour à plus de 300,000 chapons.” —Alman. de Gourmands, Quatrième Année, p. 152. bubbling no more! Forbid it, forbid it, ye Holy Allies! Take whatever ye fancy—take statues, take money— But leave them, oh leave them, their Perigueux pies, Their glorious goose-livers, and high pickled tunny! Le thon mariné, one of the most favourite and indigestible hors-d'œuvres. This fish is taken chiefly in the Golfe de Lyon. “La tête et le dessous du ventre sont les parties les plus recherchées des gourmets.” —Cours Gastronomique, p. 252. Though many, I own, are the evils they've brought us, Though Royalty's here on her very last legs, Yet, who can help loving the land that has taught us Six hundred and eighty-five ways to dress eggs? The exact number mentioned by M. de la Reynière— “On connoit en France 685 manières différentes d'accommoder les œufs; sans compter celles que nos savans imaginent chaque jour.” You see, Dick, in spite of their cries of “God-dam,” “Coquin Anglais,” et cæt'ra—how generous I am! And now (to return, once again, to my “Day,” Which will take us all night to get through in this way,) From the Boulevards we saunter through many a street, Crack jokes on the natives—mine, all very neat— Leave the Signs of the Times to political fops, And find twice as much fun in the Signs of the Shops;— Here, a Louis Dix-huit—there, a Martinmas goose, (Much in vogue since your eagles are gone out of use)— Henri Quatres in shoals, and of Gods a great many, But Saints are the most on hard duty of any:— St. Tony, who used all temptations to spurn, Here hangs o'er a beer-shop, and tempts in his turn; While there St. Venecia Veronica, the Saint of the Holy Handkerchief, is also, under the name of Venisse or Venecia, the tutelary saint of milliners. sits hemming and frilling her Holy mouchoir o'er the door of some milliner;— Saint Austin's the “outward and visible sign “Of an inward” cheap dinner, and pint of small wine; While St. Denys hangs out o'er some hatter of ton, And possessing, good bishop, no head of his own St. Denys walked three miles after his head was cut off. The mot of a woman of wit upon this legend is well known: —“Je le crois bien; en pareil cas, il n'y a que le premier pas qui coute.”, Takes an int'rest in Dandies, who've got—next to none! Then we stare into shops—read the evening's affiches— Or, if some, who're Lotharios in feeding, should wish Just to flirt with a luncheon, (a devilish bad trick, As it takes off the bloom of one's appetite, Dick,) To the Passage des—what d'ye call't—des Panoramas Off the Boulevards Italiens. We quicken our pace, and there heartily cram as Seducing young pâtés as ever could cozen One out of one's appetite, down by the dozen. We vary, of course—petits pâtés do one day, The next we've our lunch with the Gauffrier Hollandais In the Palais Royal; successor, I believe, to the Flamand, so long celebrated for the moëlleux of his Gaufres., That popular artist, who brings out, like Sc?tt, His delightful productions so quick, hot and hot; Not the worse for the exquisite comment that follows,— Divine maresquino, which—Lord, how one swallows! Once more, then, we saunter forth after our snack, or Subscribe a few francs for the price of a fiacre, And drive far away to the old Montagnes Russes, Where we find a few twirls in the car of much use To regen'rate the hunger and thirst of us sinners, Who've laps'd into snacks—the perdition of dinners. And here, Dick—in answer to one of your queries, About which we, Gourmands, have had much discussion— I've tried all these mountains, Swiss, French, and Ruggieri's, And think, for digestion Doctor Cotterel recommends, for this purpose, the Beaujon or French Mountains, and calls them “une médecine aérienne, couleur de rose;” but I own I prefer the authority of Mr. Bob, who seems, from the following note found in his own hand-writing, to have studied all these mountains very carefully:— Memoranda—The Swiss little notice deserves, While the fall at Ruggieri's is death to weak nerves; And (whate'er Doctor Cott'rel may write on the question) The turn at the Beaujon's too sharp for digestion. I doubt whether Mr. Bob is quite correct in accenting the second syllable of Ruggieri., there's none like the Russian; So equal the motion—so gentle, though fleet— It, in short, such a light and salubrious scamper is, That take whom you please—take old L?s D?xh?t, And stuff him—ay, up to the neck—with stew'd lampreys A dish so indigestible, that a late novelist, at the end of his book, could imagine no more summary mode of getting rid of all his heroes and heroines than by a hearty supper of stewed lampreys., So wholesome these Mounts, such a solvent I've found them, That, let me but rattle the Monarch well down them, The fiend, Indigestion, would fly far away, And the regicide lampreys They killed Henry I. of England:—“a food (says Hume, gravely,) which always agreed better with his palate than his constitution.” Lampreys, indeed, seem to have been always a favourite dish with kings—whether from some congeniality between them and that fish, I know not; but Dio Cassius tells us that Pollio fattened his lampreys with human blood. St. Louis of France was particularly fond of them.—See the anecdote of Thomas Aquinas eating up his majesty's lamprey, in a note upon Rabelais, liv. iii. chap. 2. be foiled of their prey! Such, Dick, are the classical sports that content us, Till five o'clock brings on that hour so momentous Had Mr. Bob's Dinner Epistle been inserted, I was prepared with an abundance of learned matter to illustrate it, for which, as, indeed, for all my “scientia popinæ Seneca.,“ I am indebted to a friend in the Dublin University,—whose reading formerly lay in the magic line; but, in consequence of the Provost's enlightened alarm at such studies, he has taken to the authors, “de re cibariâ” instead; and has left Bodin, Remigius, Agrippa and his little dog Filiolus, for Apicius, Nonius, and that most learned and savoury jesuit, Bulengerus., That epoch—but woa! my lad—here comes the Schneider, And, curse him, has made the stays three inches wider— Too wide by an inch and a half—what a Guy! But, no matter—'twill all be set right by-and-by. As we've Massinot's A famous Restaurateur—now Dupont. eloquent carte to eat still up, An inch and a half's but a trifle to fill up. So—not to lose time, Dick—here goes for the task; Au revoir, my old boy—of the Gods I but ask, That my life, like “the Leap of the German An old French saying;—“Faire le saut de l'Allemand, du lit à la table et de la table au lit.”,” may be, “Du lit à la table, d'la table au lit!” R. F. LETTER IX. FROM PHIL. FUDGE, ESQ. TO THE LORD VISCOUNT C?ST?GH. My Lord, th' Instructions, brought to-day, “I shall in all my best obey.” Your Lordship talks and writes so sensibly! And—whatsoe'er some wags may say— Oh! not at all incomprehensibly. I feel th' inquiries in your letter About my health and French most flattering; Thank ye, my French, though somewhat better, Is, on the whole, but weak and smattering:— Nothing, of course, that can compare With his who made the Congress stare (A certain Lord we need not name), Who ev'n in French, would have his trope, And talk of “batir un systême “Sur l'équilibre de l'Europe!” Sweet metaphor!—and then th' Epistle, Which bid the Saxon King go whistle,— That tender letter to “Mon Prince The celebrated letter to Prince Hardenburgh (written, however, I believe, originally in English,) in which his Lordship, professing to see “no moral or political objection” to the dismemberment of Saxony, denounced the unfortunate King as “not only the most devoted, but the most favoured of Bonaparte's vassals.”,” Which show'd alike thy French and sense;— Oh no, my Lord—there's none can do Or say un-English things like you; And, if the schemes that fill thy breast Could but a vent congenial seek, And use the tongue that suits them best, What charming Turkish would'st thou speak! But as for me, a Frenchless grub, At Congress never born to stammer, Nor learn like thee, my Lord, to snub Fall'n Monarchs, out of Chambaud's grammar— Bless you, you do not, cannot know How far a little French will go; For all one's stock, one need but draw On some half-dozen words like these— Comme ça—par-là—là-bas—ah ha! They'll take you all through France with ease. Your Lordship's praises of the scraps I sent you from my Journal lately, (Enveloping a few lac'd caps For Lady C.), delight me greatly. Her flattering speech—“What pretty things “One finds in Mr. Fudge's pages!” Is praise which (as some poet sings) Would pay one for the toils of ages. Thus flatter'd, I presume to send A few more extracts by a friend; And I should hope they'll be no less Approv'd of than my last MS.— The former ones, I fear, were creas'd, As Biddy round the caps would pin them; But these will come to hand, at least Unrumpled, for there's—nothing in them. Extracts from Mr. Fudge's Journal, addressed to Lord C. Aug. 10. Went to the Mad-house—saw the man This extraordinary madman is, I believe, in the Bicêtre. He imagines, exactly as Mr. Fudge states it, that, when the heads of those who had been guillotined were restored, he by mistake got some other person's instead of his own., Who thinks, poor wretch, that, while the Fiend Of Discord here full riot ran, He, like the rest, was guillotin'd;— But that when, under Boney's reign, (A more discreet, though quite as strong one,) The heads were all restor'd again, He, in the scramble, got a wrong one. Accordingly, he still cries out This strange head fits him most unpleasantly; And always runs, poor dev'l, about, Inquiring for his own incessantly! While to his case a tear I dropt, And saunter'd home, thought I—ye Gods! How many heads might thus be swopp'd, And, after all, not make much odds! For instance, there's V?s?tt?t's head— (“Tam carum Tam cari capitis.— Horat.” it may well be said) If by some curious chance it came To settle on Bill Soames's A celebrated pickpocket. shoulders, Th' effect would turn out much the same On all respectable cash-holders: Except that while, in its new socket, The head was planning schemes to win A zig-zag way into one's pocket, The hands would plunge directly in. Good Viscount S?dm?h, too, instead Of his own grave, respected head, Might wear (for aught I see that bars) Old Lady Wilhelmina Frump's— So while the hand sign'd Circulars, The head might lisp out “What is trumps?”— The R?g?t's brains could we transfer To some robust man-milliner, The shop, the shears, the lace, and ribbon Would go, I doubt not, quite as glib on; And, vice versâ, take the pains To give the P?ce the shopman's brains, One only change from thence would flow, Ribbons would not be wasted so. 'Twas thus I ponder'd on, my Lord; And, ev'n at night, when laid in bed, I found myself, before I snor'd, Thus chopping, swopping head for head. At length I thought, fantastic elf! How such a change would suit myself. 'Twixt sleep and waking, one by one, With various pericraniums saddled, At last I tried your Lordship's on, And then I grew completely addled— Forgot all other heads, od rot 'em! And slept, and dreamt that I was—Bottom. Aug. 21. Walk'd out with daughter Bid—was shown The House of Commons, and the Throne, Whose velvet cushion's just the same The only change, if I recollect right, is the substitution of lilies for bees. This war upon the bees is, of course, universal; “exitium misêre apibus,” like the angry nymphs in Virgil:— but may not new swarms arise out of the victims of Legitimacy yet? Napoleon sat on—what a shame! Oh, can we wonder, best of speechers, When Louis seated thus we see, That France's “fundamental features” Are much the same they us'd to be? However,—God preserve the Throne, And cushion too—and keep them free From accidents, which have been known To happen ev'n to Royalty! I am afraid that Mr. Fudge alludes here to a very awkward accident, which is well known to have happened to poor L?s le D?s?é, some years since, at one of the R?g?t's Fêtes. He was sitting next our gracious Queen at the time. Aug. 28. Read, at a stall (for oft one pops On something at these stalls and shops, That does to quote, and gives one's Book A classical and knowing look.— Indeed I've found, in Latin, lately, A course of stalls improves me greatly)— 'Twas thus I read, that, in the East, A monarch's fat's a serious matter; And once in every year, at least, He's weigh'd—to see if he gets fatter “The third day of the Feast the King causeth himself to be weighed with great care.” —F. Bernier's Voyage to Surat, &amp;c.: Then, if a pound or two he be Increas'd, there's quite a jubilee! “I remember,” says Bernier, “that all the Omrahs expressed great joy that the King weighed two pounds more now than the year preceding.”—Another author tells us that “Fatness, as well as a very large head, is considered, throughout India, as one of the most precious gifts of heaven. An enormous skull is absolutely revered, and the happy owner is looked up to as a superior being. To a Prince a joulter head is invaluable.” —Oriental Field Sports. Suppose, my Lord—and far from me To treat such things with levity— But just suppose the R?g?t's weight Were made thus an affair of state; And, ev'ry sessions, at the close,— 'Stead of a speech, which, all can see, is Heavy and dull enough, God knows— We were to try how heavy he is. Much would it glad all hearts to hear That, while the Nation's Revenue Loses so many pounds a year, The P?e, God bless him! gains a few. With bales of muslin, chintzes, spices, I see the Easterns weigh their Kings;— But, for the R?g?t, my advice is, We should throw in much heavier things: For instance ?'s quarto volumes, Which, though not spices, serve to wrap them; Dominie St?dd?t's Daily columns, “Prodigious!”—in, of course, we'd clap them— Letters, that C?rtw?t's Major Cartwright. pen indites, In which, with logical confusion, The Major like a Minor writes, And never comes to a Conclusion:— Lord S?m?rs' pamphlet—or his head— (Ah, that were worth its weight in lead!) Along with which we in may whip, sly, The Speeches of Sir John C?x H?pp?sly; That Baronet of many words, Who loves so, in the House of Lords, To whisper Bishops—and so nigh Unto their wigs in whisp'ring goes, That you may always know him by A patch of powder on his nose!— If this wo'n't do, we in must cram The “Reasons” of Lord B?ck?gh?m; (A Book his Lordship means to write, Entitled “Reasons for my Ratting:”) Or, should these prove too small and light, His r?p's a host—we'll bundle that in! And, still should all these masses fail To stir the R?g?t's ponderous scale, Why then, my Lord, in heaven's name, Pitch in, without reserve or stint, The whole of R?gl?y's beauteous Dame— If that wo'n't raise him, devil's in it! Aug. 31. Consulted Murphy's Tacitus About those famous spies at Rome The name of the first worthy who set up the trade of informer at Rome (to whom our Olivers and Castleses ought to erect a statue) was Romanus Hispo;—“qui formam vitæ iniit, quam postea celebrem miseriæ temporum et audaciæ hominum fecerunt.” —Tacit. Annal. i. 74., Whom certain Whigs—to make a fuss— Describe as much resembling us They certainly possessed the same art of instigating their victims, which the Report of the Secret Committee attributes to Lord Sidmouth's agents:—“socius (says Tacitus of one of them) libidinum et necessitatum, quo pluribus indiciis inligaret.”, Informing gentlemen, at home. But, bless the fools, they can't be serious, To say Lord S?dm?th's like Tiberius! What! he, the Peer, that injures no man, Like that severe, blood-thirsty Roman!— 'Tis true, the Tyrant lent an ear to All sorts of spies—so doth the Peer, too. 'Tis true my Lord's Elect tell fibs, And deal in perj'ry—ditto Tib's. 'Tis true, the Tyrant screen'd and hid His rogues from justice “Neque tamen id Sereno noxæ fuit, quem odium publicum tutiorem faciebat. Nam ut quis districtior accusator velut sacrosanctus erat.”—Annal. lib. iv. 36.—Or, as it is translated by Mr. Fudge's friend, Murphy:—“This daring accuser had the curses of the people, and the protection of the Emperor. Informers, in proportion as they rose in guilt, became sacred characters.”— ditto Sid. 'Tis true the Peer is grave and glib At moral speeches—ditto Tib. Murphy even confers upon one of his speeches the epithet “constitutional.” Mr. Fudge might have added to his parallel, that Tiberius was a good private character:—“egregium vitâ famâque quoad privatus.” 'Tis true, the feats the Tyrant did Were in his dotage—ditto Sid. So far, I own, the parallel 'Twixt Tib and Sid goes vastly well; But there are points in Tib that strike My humble mind as much more like Yourself, my dearest Lord, or him, Of th' India Board—that soul of whim! Like him, Tiberius lov'd his joke “Ludibria seriis permiscere solitus.”, On matters, too, where few can bear one; E.g. a man, cut up, or broke Upon the wheel—a devilish fair one! Your common fractures, wounds, and fits, Are nothing to such wholesale wits; But, let the suff'rer gasp for life, The joke is then worth any money; And, if he writhe beneath a knife,— Oh dear, that's something quite too funny. In this respect, my Lord, you see The Roman wag and ours agree: Now as to your resemblance—mum— This parallel we need not follow There is one point of resemblance between Tiberius and Lord C. which Mr. Fudge might have mentioned —“suspensa semper et obscura verba.”; Though 'tis, in Ireland, said by some Your Lordship beats Tiberius hollow; Whips, chains—but these are things too serious For me to mention or discuss; Whene'er your Lordship acts Tiberius, Phil. Fudge's part is Tacitus! Sept. 2. Was thinking, had Lord S?dm?th got Any good decent sort of Plot Against the winter-time—if not, Alas, alas, our ruin's fated; All done up, and spiflicated! Ministers and all their vassals, Down from C?tl?gh to Castles,— Unless we can kick up a riot, Ne'er can hope for peace or quiet! What's to be done?—Spa-Fields was clever; But even that brought gibes and mockings Upon our heads—so, mem.—must never Keep ammunition in old stockings; For fear some wag should in his curst head Take it to say our force was worsted. Mem. too—when Sid an army raises, It must not be “incog.” like Bayes's: Nor must the General be a hobbling Professor of the art of cobbling; Lest men, who perpetrate such puns, Should say, with Jacobinic grin, He felt, from soleing Wellingtons Short boots, so called., A Wellington's great soul within! Nor must an old Apothecary Go take the Tower, for lack of pence, With (what these wags would call, so merry,) Physical force and phial-ence! No—no—our Plot, my Lord, must be Next time contriv'd more skilfully. John Bull, I grieve to say, is growing So troublesomely sharp and knowing, So wise—in short, so Jacobin— 'Tis monstrous hard to take him in. Sept. 6. Heard of the fate of our Ambassador In China, and was sorely nettled; But think, my Lord, we should not pass it o'er Till all this matter's fairly settled; And here's the mode occurs to me:— As none of our Nobility, Though for their own most gracious King (They would kiss hands, or—any thing), Can be persuaded to go through This farce-like trick of the Ko-tou; And as these Mandarins wo'n't bend, Without some mumming exhibition, Suppose, my Lord, you were to send Grimaldi to them on a mission: As Legate, Joe could play his part, And if, in diplomatic art, The “volto sciolto” The open countenance, recommended by Lord Chesterfield. 's meritorious, Let Joe but grin, he has it, glorious! A title for him's easily made; And, by-the-by, one Christmas time, If I remember right, he play'd Lord Morley in some pantomime Mr. Fudge is a little mistaken here. It was not Grimaldi, but some very inferior performer, who played this part of “Lord Morley” in the pantomime,—so much to the horror of the distinguished Earl of that name. The expostulatory letters of the Noble Earl to Mr. H?rr?s, upon this vulgar profanation of his spick-and-span new title, will, I trust, some time or other, be given to the world.;— As Earl of M?rl?y then gazette him. If t'other Earl of M?rl?y'll let him. (And why should not the world be blest With two such stars, for East and West?) Then, when before the Yellow Screen He's brought—and, sure, the very essence Of etiquette would be that scene Of Joe in the Celestial Presence!— He thus should say:—“Duke Ho and Soo, “I'll play what tricks you please for you, “If you'll, in turn, but do for me “A few small tricks you now shall see. “If I consult your Emperor's liking, “At least you'll do the same for my King.” He then should give them nine such grins, As would astound ev'n Mandarins; And throw such somersets before The picture of King George (God bless him!) As, should Duke Ho but try them o'er, Would, by Confucius, much distress him! I start this merely as a hint, But think you'll find some wisdom in't; And, should you follow up the job, My son, my Lord (you know poor Bob), Would in the suite be glad to go And help his Excellency, Joe;— At least, like noble Amh?rst's son, The lad will do to practise on. See Mr. Ellis's account of the Embassy. LETTER X. FROM MISS BIDDY FUDGE TO MISS DOROTHY ?. Well, it isn't the King, after all, my dear creature! But don't you go laugh, now—there's nothing to quiz in't— For grandeur of air and for grimness of feature, He might be a King, Doll, though, hang him, he isn't. At first, I felt hurt, for I wish'd it, I own, If for no other cause but to vex Miss Malone,— (The great heiress, you know, of Shandangan, who's here, Showing off with such airs, and a real Cashmere See Lady Morgan's “France” for the anecdote, told her by Madame de Genlis, of the young gentleman whose love was cured by finding that his mistress wore a shawl “peau de lapin.”, While mine's but a paltry, old rabbit-skin, dear!) But Pa says, on deeply consid'ring the thing, “I am just as well pleas'd it should not be the King; “As I think for my Biddy, so gentille and jolie, “Whose charms may their price in an honest way fetch, “That a Brandenburgh”—(what is a Brandenburgh, Dolly?)— “Would be, after all, no such very great catch. “If the R?g?t indeed—” added he, looking sly— (You remember that comical squint of his eye) But I stopp'd him with “La, Pa, how can you say so, “When the R?g?t loves none but old women, you know!” Which is fact, my dear Dolly—we, girls of eighteen, And so slim—Lord, he'd think us not fit to be seen; And would like us much better as old—ay, as old As that Countess of Desmond, of whom I've been told That she liv'd to much more than a hundred and ten, And was kill'd by a fall from a cherry-tree then! What a frisky old girl! but—to come to my lover, Who, though not a King, is a hero I'll swear,— You shall hear all that's happen'd, just briefly run over, Since that happy night, when we whisk'd through the air! Let me see—'twas on Saturday—yes, Dolly, yes— From that evening I date the first dawn of my bliss; When we both rattled off in that dear little carriage, Whose journey, Bob says, is so like Love and Marriage, “Beginning gay, desperate, dashing, down-hilly, “And ending as dull as a six-inside Dilly!” The cars, on the return, are dragged up slowly by a chain. Well, scarcely a wink did I sleep the night through; And, next day, having scribbled my letter to you, With a heart full of hope this sweet fellow to meet, I set out with Papa, to see Louis Dix-huit Make his bow to some half-dozen women and boys, Who get up a small concert of shrill Vive le Rois— And how vastly genteeler, my dear, even this is, Than vulgar Pall-Mall's oratorio of hisses! The gardens seem'd full—so, of course, we walk'd o'er 'em, 'Mong orange-trees, clipp'd into town-bred decorum, And daphnes, and vases, and many a statue There staring, with not ev'n a stitch on them, at you! The ponds, too, we view'd—stood awhile on the brink To contemplate the play of those pretty gold fishes— “Live bullion,” says merciless Bob, “which, I think, “Would, if coin'd, with a little mint sauce, be delicious!” Mr. Bob need not be ashamed of his cookery jokes, when he is kept in countenance hy such men as Cicero, St. Augustine, and that jovial bishop, Venantius Fortunatus. The pun of the great orator upon the “jus Verrinum,” which he calls bad hogbroth, from a play upon both the words, is well known; and the Saint's puns upon the conversion of Lot's wife into salt are equally ingenious:—“In salem conversa hominibus fidelibus quoddam præstitit condimentum, quo sapiant aliquid, unde illud caveatur exemplum.”—De Civitat. Dei, lib. xvi. cap. 30. —The jokes of the pious favourite of Queen Radagunda, the convivial Bishop Venantius, may be found among his poems, in some lines against a cook who had robbed him. The following is similar to Cicero's pun:— Plus juscella Coci quam mea jura valent. See his poems, Corpus Poetar. Latin. tom. ii. p. 1732.— Of the same kind was Montmaur's joke, when a dish was spilt over him—“summum jus, summa injuria;” and the same celebrated parasite, in ordering a sole to be placed before him, said,— Eligi cui dicas, tu mihi sola places. The reader may likewise see, among a good deal of kitchen erudition, the learned Lipsius's jokes on cutting up a capon in his Saturnal. Sermon. lib. ii. cap. 2. But what, Dolly, what, is the gay orange-grove, Or gold fishes, to her that's in search of her love? In vain did I wildly explore every chair Where a thing like a man was—no lover sate there! In vain my fond eyes did I eagerly cast At the whiskers, mustachios, and wigs that went past, To obtain, if I could, but a glance at that curl,— A glimpse of those whiskers, as sacred, my girl, As the lock that, Pa says For this scrap of knowledge “Pa” was, I suspect, indebted to a note upon Volney's Ruins; a book which usually forms part of a Jacobin's library, and with which Mr. Fudge must have been well acquainted at the time when he wrote his “Down with Kings,” &amp;c. The note in Volney is as follows: —“It is by this tuft of hair (on the crown of the head), worn by the majority of Mussulmans, that the Angel of the Tomb is to take the elect and carry them to Paradise.”, is to Mussulmen giv'n, For the angel to hold by that “lugs them to heaven!” Alas, there went by me full many a quiz, And mustachios in plenty, but nothing like his! Disappointed, I found myself sighing out “well-a-day,”— Thought of the words of T?m M?re's Irish Melody, Something about the “green spot of delight The young lady, whose memory is not very correct, must allude, I think, to the following lines:— Oh that fairy form is ne'er forgot, Which First Love traced; Still it ling'ring haunts the greenest spot On Memory's waste!” (Which, you know, Captain Macintosh sung to us one day): Ah Dolly, my “spot” was that Saturday night, And its verdure, how fleeting, had wither'd by Sunday! We din'd at a tavern—La, what do I say? If Bob was to know!—a Restaurateur's, dear; Where your properest ladies go dine every day, And drink Burgundy out of large tumblers, like beer. Fine Bob (for he's really grown super-fine) Condescended, for once, to make one of the party; Of course, though but three, we had dinner for nine, And in spite of my grief, love, I own I eat hearty. Indeed, Doll, I know not how 'tis, but, in grief, I have always found eating a wond'rous relief; And Bob, who's in love, said he felt the same, quite— “My sighs,” said he, “ceas'd with the first glass I drank you; “The lamb made me tranquil, the puffs made me light, “And—now that all's o'er—why, I'm—pretty well, thank you!” To my great annoyance, we sat rather late; For Bobby and Pa had a furious debate About singing and cookery—Bobby, of course, Standing up for the latter Fine Art in full force Cookery has been dignified by the researches of a Bacon; (see his Natural History, Receipts, &amp;c.) and takes its station as one of the Fine Arts in the following passage of Mr. Dugald Stewart:—“Agreeably to this view of the subject, sweet may be said to be intrinsically pleasing, and bitter to be relatively pleasing; which both are, in many cases, equally essential to those effects, which, in the art of cookery, correspond to that composite beauty, which it is the object of the painter and of the poet to create.” —Philosophical Essays.; And Pa saying, “God only knows which is worst, “The French Singers or Cooks, but I wish us well over it— “What with old Laïs and Véry, I'm curst “If my head or my stomach will ever recover it!” 'Twas dark, when we got to the Boulevards to stroll, And in vain did I look 'mong the street Macaronis, When, sudden it struck me—last hope of my soul— That some angel might take the dear man to Tortoni's A fashionable café glacier on the Italian Boulevards. We enter'd—and, scarcely had Bob, with an air, For a grappe à la jardinière call'd to the waiters, When, oh Doll! I saw him—my hero was there (For I knew his white small-clothes and brown leather gaiters), A group of fair statues from Greece smiling o'er him “You eat your ice at Tortoni's,” says Mr. Scott, “under a Grecian group.”, And lots of red currant-juice sparkling before him! Oh Dolly, these heroes—what creatures they are; In the boudoir the same as in fields full of slaughter! As cool in the Beaujon's precipitous car, As when safe at Tortoni's, o'er ic'd currant water! He join'd us—imagine, dear creature, my ecstasy— Join'd by the man I'd have broken ten necks to see! Bob wish'd to treat him with Punch à la glace, But the sweet fellow swore that my beauté, my grace, And my je-ne-sais-quoi (then his whiskers he twirl'd) Were, to him, “on de top of all Ponch in de vorld.”— How pretty!—though oft (as, of course, it must be) Both his French and his English are Greek, Doll, to me. But, in short, I felt happy as ever fond heart did; And happier still, when 'twas fix'd, ere we parted, That, if the next day should be pastoral weather, We all would set off, in French buggies, together, To see Montmorency—that place which, you know, Is so famous for cherries and Jean Jacques Rousseau. His card then he gave us—the name, rather creas'd— But 'twas Calicot—something—a Colonel, at least! After which—sure there never was hero so civil—he Saw us safe home to our door in Rue Rivoli, Where his last words, as, at parting, he threw A soft look o'er his shoulders, were—“How do you do!” Not an unusual mistake with foreigners. But, lord,—there's Papa for the post—I'm so vext— Montmorency must now, love, be kept for my next. That dear Sunday night!—I was charmingly drest, And—so providential!—was looking my best; Such a sweet muslin gown, with a flounce—and my frills, You've no notion how rich—(though Pa has by the bills) And you'd smile had you seen, when we sat rather near, Colonel Calicot eyeing the cambric, my dear. Then the flow'rs in my bonnet—but, la, it's in vain— So, good-by, my sweet Doll—I shall soon write again. B. F. Nota bene—our love to all neighbours about— Your Papa in particular—how is his gout? P. S.—I've just open'd my letter to say, In your next you must tell me, (now do, Dolly, pray, For I hate to ask Bob, he's so ready to quiz,) What sort of a thing, dear, a Brandenburgh is. LETTER XI. FROM PHELIM CONNOR TO ?. Yes, 'twas a cause, as noble and as great As ever hero died to vindicate— A Nation's right to speak a Nation's voice, And own no power but of the Nation's choice! Such was the grand, the glorious cause that now Hung trembling on Napoleon's single brow; Such the sublime arbitrament, that pour'd, In patriot eyes, a light around his sword, A hallowing light, which never, since the day Of his young victories, had illum'd its way! Oh 'twas not then the time for tame debates, Ye men of Gaul, when chains were at your gates; When he, who late had fled your Chieftain's eye, As geese from eagles on Mount Taurus fly, See Ælian, lib. v. cap. 29.—who tells us that these geese, from a consciousness of their own loquacity, always cross Mount Taurus with stones in their bills, to prevent any unlucky cackle from betraying them to the eagles—??????????? ?????????. Denounc'd against the land, that spurn'd his chain, Myriads of swords to bind it fast again— Myriads of fierce invading swords, to track Through your best blood his path of vengeance back; When Europe's Kings, that never yet combin'd But (like those upper Stars, that, when conjoin'd, Shed war and pestilence,) to scourge mankind, Gather'd around, with hosts from every shore, Hating Napoleon much, but Freedom more, And, in that coming strife, appall'd to see The world yet left one chance for liberty!— No, 'twas not then the time to weave a net Of bondage round your Chief; to curb and fret Your veteran war-horse, pawing for the fight, When every hope was in his speed and might— To waste the hour of action in dispute, And coolly plan how freedom's boughs should shoot, When your Invader's axe was at the root! No sacred Liberty! that God, who throws, Thy light around, like his own sunshine, knows How well I love thee, and how deeply hate All tyrants, upstart and Legitimate— Yet, in that hour, were France my native land, I would have follow'd, with quick heart and hand, Napoleon, Nero—ay, no matter whom— To snatch my country from that damning doom, That deadliest curse that on the conquer'd waits— A Conqueror's satrap, thron'd within her gates! True, he was false—despotic—all you please— Had trampled down man's holiest liberties— Had, by a genius, form'd for nobler things Than lie within the grasp of vulgar Kings, But rais'd the hopes of men—as eaglets fly With tortoises aloft into the sky— To dash them down again more shatteringly! All this I own—but still Somebody (Fontenelle, I believe,) has said, that if he had his hand full of truths, he would open but one finger at a time; and the same sort of reserve I find to be necessary with respect to Mr. Connor's very plain-spoken letters. The remainder of this Epistle is so full of unsafe matter-of-fact, that it must, for the present at least, be withheld from the public. LETTER XII. FROM MISS BIDDY FUDGE TO MISS DOROTHY ?. At last, Dolly,—thanks to a potent emetic, Which Bobby and Pa, with grimace sympathetic, Have swallow'd this morning, to balance the bliss, Of an eel matelote and a bisque d'ecrevisses— I've a morning at home to myself, and sit down To describe you our heavenly trip out of town. How agog you must be for this letter, my dear! Lady Jane, in the novel, less languish'd to hear If that elegant cornet she met at Lord Neville's Was actually dying with love or—blue devils. But Love, Dolly, Love is the theme I pursue; With Blue Devils, thank heav'n, I have nothing to do— Except, indeed, dear Colonel Calicot spies Any imps of that colour in certain blue eyes, Which he stares at till I, Doll, at his do the same; Then he simpers—I blush—and would often exclaim, If I knew but the French for it, “Lord, Sir, for shame!” Well, the morning was lovely—the trees in full dress For the happy occasion—the sunshine express— Had we order'd it, dear, of the best poet going, It scarce could be furnish'd more golden and glowing. Though late when we started, the scent of the air Was like Gattie's rose-water,—and, bright, here and there, On the grass an odd dew-drop was glittering yet, Like my aunt's diamond pin on her green tabbinet! While the birds seem'd to warble as blest on the boughs, As if each a plum'd Calicot had for her spouse; And the grapes were all blushing and kissing in rows, And—in short, need I tell you, wherever one goes With the creature one loves, 'tis all couleur de rose; And, ah, I shall ne'er, liv'd I ever so long, see A day such as that at divine Montmorency! There was but one drawback—at first when we started, The Colonel and I were inhumanly parted; How cruel—young hearts of such moments to rob! He went in Pa's buggy, and I went with Bob; And, I own, I felt spitefully happy to know That Papa and his comrade agreed but so-so. For the Colonel, it seems, is a stickler of Boney's— Served with him of course—nay, I'm sure they were cronies. So martial his features! dear Doll, you can trace Ulm, Austerlitz, Lodi, as plain in his face As you do on that pillar of glory and brass The column in the Place Vendôme., Which the poor Duc de B?ri must hate so to pass! It appears, too, he made—as most foreigners do— About English affairs an odd blunder or two. For example—misled by the names, I dare say— He confounded Jack Castles with Lord C?gh; And—sure such a blunder no mortal hit ever on— Fancied the present Lord C?md?n the clever one! But politics ne'er were the sweet fellow's trade; 'Twas for war and the ladies my Colonel was made. And, oh, had you heard, as together we walk'd Thro' that beautiful forest, how sweetly he talk'd; And how perfectly well he appear'd, Doll, to know All the life and adventures of Jean Jacques Rousseau!— “'Twas there,” said he—not that his words I can state— 'Twas a gibb'rish that Cupid alone could translate;— But “there,” said he, (pointing where, small and remote, The dear Hermitage rose,) “there his Julie he wrote,— “Upon paper gilt-edg'd “Employant pour cela le plus beau papier doré, séchant l'écriture avec de la poudre d'azur et d'argent, et cousant mes cahiers avec de la nompareille bleue.”—Les Confessions, part ii. liv. 9., without blot or erasure; “Then sanded it over with silver and azure, “And—oh, what will genius and fancy not do?— “Tied the leaves up together with nompareille blue!” What a trait of Rousseau! what a crowd of emotions From sand and blue ribbons are conjur'd up here! Alas, that a man of such exquisite This word, “exquisite,” is evidently a favourite of Miss Fudge's; and I understand she was not a little angry when her brother Bob committed a pun on the last two syllables of it in the following couplet:— “I'd fain praise your Poem—but tell me, how is it When I cry out “Exquisite,” Echo cries “quiz it?” notions Should send his poor brats to the Foundling, my dear! “'Twas here, too, perhaps,” Colonel Calicot said— As down the small garden he pensively led— (Though once I could see his sublime forehead wrinkle With rage not to find there the lov'd periwinkle) The flower which Rousseau brought into such fashion among the Parisians, by exclaiming one day, “Ah, voilà de la pervenche!” “'Twas here he receiv'd from the fair D'Epinay “(Who call'd him so sweetly her Bear “Mon ours, voilà votre asyle—et vous, mon ours, ne viendrez vous pas aussi?”—&amp;c. &amp;c., every day,) “That dear flannel petticoat, pull'd off to form “A waistcoat, to keep the enthusiast warm!” “Un jour, qu'il geloit très fort, en ouvrant un paquet qu'elle m'envoyoit, je trouvai un petit jupon de flanelle d'Angleterre, qu'elle me marquoit avoir porté, et dont elle vouloit que je me fisse faire un gilet. Ce soin, plus qu'amical, me parut si tendre, comme si elle se fût dépouillée pour me vétir, que, dans mon émotion, je baisai vingt fois en pleurant le billet et le jupon.” Such, Doll, were the sweet recollections we ponder'd, As, full of romance, through that valley we wander'd. The flannel (one's train of ideas, how odd it is!) Led us to talk about other commodities, Cambric, and silk, and—I ne'er shall forget, For the sun was then hast'ning in pomp to its set, And full on the Colonel's dark whiskers shone down, When he ask'd me, with eagerness,—who made my gown? The question confus'd me—for, Doll, you must know, And I ought to have told my best friend long ago, That, by Pa's strict command, I no longer employ Miss Biddy's notions of French pronunciation may be perceived in the rhymes which she always selects for “Le Roi.” That enchanting couturière, Madame le Roi; But am forc'd now to have Victorine, who—deuce take her!— It seems is, at present, the King's mantua-maker— I mean of his party—and, though much the smartest, Le Roi is condemn'd as a rank Bonapartist. Le Roi, who was the Couturière of the Empress Maria Louisa, is at present, of course, out of fashion, and is succeeded in her station by the Royalist mantua-maker, Victorine. Think, Doll, how confounded I look'd—so well knowing The Colonel's opinions—my cheeks were quite glowing; I stammer'd out something—nay, even half nam'd The legitimate sempstress, when, loud, he exclaim'd, “Yes, yes, by the stitching 'tis plain to be seen “It was made by that Bourbonite b?h, Victorine!” What a word for a hero!—but heroes will err, And I thought, dear, I'd tell you things just as they were. Besides, though the word on good manners intrench, I assure you 'tis not half so shocking in French. But this cloud, though embarrassing, soon pass'd away, And the bliss altogether, the dreams of that day, The thoughts that arise, when such dear fellows woo us,— The nothings that then, love, are every thing to us— That quick correspondence of glances and sighs, And what Bob calls the “Twopenny-post of the Eyes”— Ah, Doll! though I know you've a heart, 'tis in vain To a heart so unpractis'd these things to explain. They can only be felt, in their fulness divine, By her who has wander'd, at evening's decline, Through a valley like that, with a Colonel like mine! But here I must finish—for Bob, my dear Dolly, Whom physic, I find, always makes melancholy, Is seiz'd with a fancy for church-yard reflections; And, full of all yesterday's rich recollections, Is just setting off for Montmartre—“for there is,” Said he, looking solemn, “the tomb of the Vèrys! It is the brother of the present excellent Restaurateur who lies entombed so magnificently in the Cimetière Montmartre. The inscription on the column at the head of the tomb concludes with the following words:—“Toute sa vie fut consacrée aux arts utiles.” “Long, long have I wish'd, as a votary true, “O'er the grave of such talents to utter my moans; “And, to-day—as my stomach is not in good cue “For the flesh of the Vérys—I'll visit their bones!” He insists upon my going with him—how teasing! This letter, however, dear Dolly, shall lie Unseal'd in my draw'r, that, if any thing pleasing Occurs while I'm out, I may tell you—good-bye. B. F. Four o'clock. Oh, Dolly, dear Dolly, I'm ruin'd for ever— I ne'er shall be happy again, Dolly, never! To think of the wretch—what a victim was I! 'Tis too much to endure—I shall die, I shall die— My brain's in a fever—my pulses beat quick— I shall die, or, at least, be exceedingly sick! Oh, what do you think? after all my romancing, My visions of glory, my sighing, my glancing, This Colonel—I scarce can commit it to paper— This Colonel's no more than a vile linen-draper!! 'Tis true as I live—I had coax'd brother Bob so, (You'll hardly make out what I'm writing, I sob so,) For some little gift on my birth-day—September The thirtieth, dear, I'm eighteen, you remember— That Bob to a shop kindly order'd the coach, (Ah, little I thought who the shopman would prove,) To bespeak me a few of those mouchoirs de poche, Which, in happier hours, I have sigh'd for, my love— (The most beautiful things—two Napoleons the price— And one's name in the corner embroider'd so nice!) Well, with heart full of pleasure, I enter'd the shop, But—ye Gods, what a phantom!—I thought I should drop— There he stood, my dear Dolly—no room for a doubt— There, behind the vile counter, these eyes saw him stand, With a piece of French cambric, before him roll'd out, And that horrid yard-measure uprais'd in his hand! Oh—Papa, all along, knew the secret, 'tis clear— 'Twas a shopman he meant by a “Brandenburgh,” dear! The man, whom I fondly had fancied a King, And, when that too delightful illusion was past, As a hero had worshipp'd—vile, treacherous thing— To turn out but a low linen-draper at last! My head swam around—the wretch smil'd, I believe, But his smiling, alas, could no longer deceive— I fell back on Bob—my whole heart seem'd to wither— And, pale as a ghost, I was carried back hither! I only remember that Bob, as I caught him, With cruel facetiousness said, “Curse the Kiddy! “A staunch Revolutionist always I've thought him, “But now I find out he's a Counter one, Biddy!” Only think, my dear creature, if this should be known To that saucy, satirical thing, Miss Malone! What a story 'twill be at Shandangan for ever! What laughs and what quizzing she'll have with the men! It will spread through the country—and never, oh, never Can Biddy be seen at Kilrandy again! Farewell—I shall do something desp'rate, I fear— And, ah! if my fate ever reaches your ear, One tear of compassion my Doll will not grudge To her poor—broken-hearted—young friend, Biddy Fudge. Nota bene—I am sure you will hear, with delight, That we're going, all three, to see Brunet to-night. A laugh will revive me—and kind Mr. Cox (Do you know him?) has got us the Governor's box. FABLES FOR THE HOLY ALLIANCE. Tu Regibus alas Eripe. Virgil, Georg. lib. iv. ? Clip the wings Of these high-flying, arbitrary Kings. Dryden's Translation. DEDICATION. TO LORD BYRON. FABLE I. THE DISSOLUTION OF THE HOLY ALLIANCE. A DREAM. I've have a dream that bodes no good Unto the Holy Brotherhood. I may be wrong, but I confess— As far as it is right or lawful For one, no conjurer, to guess— It seems to me extremely awful. Methought, upon the Neva's flood A beautiful Ice Palace stood, A dome of frost-work, on the plan Of that once built by Empress Anne “It is well known that the Empress Anne built a palace of ice on the Neva, in 1740, which was fifty-two feet in length, and when illuminated had a surprising effect.” —Pinkerton., Which shone by moonlight—as the tale is— Like an Aurora Borealis. In this said Palace, furnish'd all And lighted as the best on land are, I dreamt there was a splendid Ball, Giv'n by the Emperor Alexander, To entertain with all due zeal, Those holy gentlemen, who've shown a Regard so kind for Europe's weal, At Troppau, Laybach, and Verona. The thought was happy—and design'd To hint how thus the human Mind May, like the stream imprison'd there, Be check'd and chill'd, till it can bear The heaviest Kings, that ode or sonnet E'er yet be-prais'd, to dance upon it. And all were pleas'd, and cold, and stately, Shivering in grand illumination— Admir'd the superstructure greatly, Nor gave one thought to the foundation. Much too the Czar himself exulted, To all plebeian fears a stranger, For, Madame Krudener, when consulted, Had pledg'd her word there was no danger. So, on he caper'd, fearless quite, Thinking himself extremely clever, And waltz'd away with all his might, As if the Frost would last for ever. Just fancy how a bard like me, Who reverence monarchs, must have trembled To see that goodly company, At such a ticklish sport assembled. Nor were the fears, that thus astounded My loyal soul, at all unfounded— For, lo! ere long, those walls so massy Were seiz'd with an ill-omen'd dripping, And o'er the floors, now growing glassy, Their Holinesses took to slipping. The Czar, half through a Polonaise, Could scarce get on for downright stumbling; And Prussia, though to slippery ways Well us'd, was cursedly near tumbling. Yet still 'twas, who could stamp the floor most, Russia and Austria 'mong the foremost.— And now, to an Italian air, This precious brace would, hand in hand, go; Now—while old Louis, from his chair, Intreated them his toes to spare— Call'd loudly out for a Fandango. And a Fandango, 'faith, they had, At which they all set to, like mad! Never were Kings (though small th' expense is Of wit among their Excellencies) So out of all their princely senses. But, ah, that dance—that Spanish dance— Scarce was the luckless strain begun, When, glaring red, as 'twere a glance Shot from an angry Southern sun, A light through all the chambers flam'd, Astonishing old Father Frost, Who, bursting into tears, exclaim'd, “A thaw, by Jove—we're lost, we're lost! “Run, France—a second Waterloo “Is come to drown you—sauve qui peut!” Why, why will monarchs caper so In palaces without foundations?— Instantly all was in a flow, Crowns, fiddles, sceptres, decorations— Those Royal Arms, that look'd so nice, Cut out in the resplendent ice— Those Eagles, handsomely provided With double heads for double dealings— How fast the globes and sceptres glided Out of their claws on all the ceilings! Proud Prussia's double bird of prey Tame as a spatch cock, slunk away; While—just like France herself, when she Proclaims how great her naval skill is— Poor Louis' drowning fleurs-de-lys Imagin'd themselves water-lilies. And not alone rooms, ceilings, shelves, But—still more fatal execution— The Great Legitimates themselves Seem'd in a state of dissolution. Th' indignant Czar—when just about To issue a sublime Ukase, “Whereas all light must be kept out”— Dissolv'd to nothing in its blaze. Next Prussia took his turn to melt, And, while his lips illustrious felt The influence of this southern air, Some word, like “Constitution”—long Congeal'd in frosty silence there— Came slowly thawing from his tongue. While Louis, lapsing by degrees, And sighing out a faint adieu To truffles, salmis, toasted cheese And smoking fondus, quickly grew, Himself, into a fondu too;— Or like that goodly King they make Of sugar for a Twelfth-night cake, When, in some urchin's mouth, alas, It melts into a shapeless mass! In short, I scarce could count a minute, Ere the bright dome, and all within it, Kings, Fiddlers, Emperors, all were gone— And nothing now was seen or heard But the bright river, rushing on, Happy as an enfranchis'd bird, And prouder of that natural ray, Shining along its chainless way— More proudly happy thus to glide In simple grandeur to the sea, Than when, in sparkling fetters tied, 'Twas deck'd with all that kingly pride Could bring to light its slavery! Such is my dream—and, I confess, I tremble at its awfulness. That Spanish Dance—that southern beam— But I say nothing—there's my dream— And Madame Krudener, the she-prophet, May make just what she pleases of it. FABLE II. THE LOOKING-GLASSES. PROEM. Where Kings have been by mob-elections Rais'd to the throne, 'tis strange to see What different and what odd perfections Men have requir'd in Royalty. Some, liking monarchs large and plumpy, Have chos'n their Sovereigns by the weight;— Some wish'd them tall, some thought your dumpy, Dutch-built, the true Legitimate. The Goths had a law to choose always a short, thick man for their King. Munster, Cosmog. lib. iii. p. 164. The Easterns in a Prince, 'tis said, Prefer what's call'd a jolter-head “In a Prince a jolter-head is invaluable.” Oriental Field Sports.: Th' Egyptians wer'n't at all partic'lar, So that their Kings had not red hair— This fault not ev'n the greatest stickler For the blood-royal well could bear. A thousand more such illustrations Might be adduc'd from various nations. But, 'mong the many tales they tell us, Touching th' acquir'd or natural right Which some men have to rule their fellows, There's one, which I shall here recite:— FABLE. There was a land—to name the place Is neither now my wish nor duty— Where reign'd a certain Royal race, By right of their superior beauty. What was the cut legitimate Of these great persons' chins and noses, By right of which they rul'd the state, No history I have seen discloses. But so it was—a settled case— Some Act of Parliament, pass'd snugly, Had voted them a beauteous race, And all their faithful subjects ugly. As rank, indeed, stood high or low, Some change it made in visual organs; Your Peers were decent—Knights, so so— But all your common people, gorgons! Of course, if any knave but hinted That the King's nose was turn'd awry, Or that the Queen (God bless her!) squinted— The judges doom'd that knave to die. But rarely things like this occurr'd, The people to their King were duteous, And took it, on his Royal word, That they were frights, and He was beauteous. The cause whereof, among all classes, Was simply this—these island elves Had never yet seen looking-glasses, And, therefore, did not know themselves. Sometimes, indeed, their neighbours' faces Might strike them as more full of reason, More fresh than those in certain places— But, Lord, the very thought was treason! Besides, howe'er we love our neighbour, And take his face's part, 'tis known We ne'er so much in earnest labour, As when the face attack'd's our own. So, on they went—the crowd believing— (As crowds well govern'd always do) Their rulers, too, themselves deceiving— So old the joke, they thought 'twas true. But jokes, we know, if they too far go, Must have an end—and so, one day, Upon that coast there was a cargo Of looking-glasses cast away. 'Twas said, some Radicals, somewhere, Had laid their wicked heads together, And forc'd that ship to founder there,— While some believe it was the weather. However this might be, the freight Was landed without fees or duties; And from that hour historians date The downfal of the Race of Beauties. The looking-glasses got about, And grew so common through the land, That scarce a tinker could walk out, Without a mirror in his hand. Comparing faces, morning, noon, And night, their constant occupation— By dint of looking-glasses, soon, They grew a most reflecting nation. In vain the Court, aware of errors In all the old, establish'd mazards, Prohibited the use of mirrors, And tried to break them at all hazards:— In vain—their laws might just as well Have been waste paper on the shelves; That fatal freight had broke the spell; People had look'd—and knew themselves. If chance a Duke, of birth sublime, Presum'd upon his ancient face, (Some calf-head, ugly from all time,) They popp'd a mirror to his Grace:— Just hinting, by that gentle sign, How little Nature holds it true, That what is call'd an ancient line, Must be the line of Beauty too. From Dukes' they pass'd to regal phizzes, Compar'd them proudly with their own, And cried, “How could such monstrous quizzes “In Beauty's name usurp the throne!”— They then wrote essays, pamphlets, books, Upon Cosmetical Œconomy, Which made the King try various looks, But none improv'd his physiognomy. And satires at the Court were levell'd, And small lampoons, so full of slynesses, That soon, in short, they quite be-devil'd Their Majesties and Royal Highnesses. At length—but here I drop the veil, To spare some loyal folks' sensations;— Besides, what follow'd is the tale Of all such late-enlighten'd nations; Of all to whom old Time discloses A truth they should have sooner known— That Kings have neither rights nor noses A whit diviner than their own. FABLE III. THE TORCH OF LIBERTY. I saw it all in Fancy's glass— Herself, the fair, the wild magician, Who bid this splendid day-dream pass, And nam'd each gliding apparition. 'Twas like a torch-race—such as they Of Greece perform'd, in ages gone, When the fleet youths, in long array, Pass'd the bright torch triumphant on. I saw th' expectant nations stand, To catch the coming flame in turn;— I saw, from ready hand to hand, The clear, though struggling, glory burn. And, oh, their joy, as it came near, 'Twas, in itself, a joy to see;— While Fancy whisper'd in my ear, “That torch they pass is Liberty!” And, each, as she receiv'd the flame, Lighted her altar with its ray; Then, smiling, to the next who came, Speeded it on its sparkling way. From Albion first, whose ancient shrine Was furnish'd with the fire already, Columbia caught the boon divine, And lit a flame, like Albion's, steady. The splendid gift then Gallia took, And, like a wild Bacchante, raising The brand aloft, its sparkles shook, As she would set the world a-blazing! Thus kindling wild, so fierce and high Her altar blaz'd into the air, That Albion, to that fire too nigh, Shrunk back, and shudder'd at its glare! Next, Spain, so new was light to her, Leap'd at the torch—but, ere the spark That fell upon her shrine could stir, 'Twas quench'd—and all again was dark. Yet, no—not quench'd—a treasure, worth So much to mortals, rarely dies: Again her living light look'd forth, And shone, a beacon, in all eyes. Who next receiv'd the flame? alas, Unworthy Naples—shame of shames, That ever through such hands should pass That brightest of all earthly flames! Scarce had her fingers touch'd the torch, When, frighted by the sparks it shed, Nor waiting ev'n to feel the scorch, She dropp'd it to the earth—and fled. And fall'n it might have long remain'd; But Greece, who saw her moment now, Caught up the prize, though prostrate, stain'd, And wav'd it round her beauteous brow. And Fancy bade me mark where, o'er Her altar, as its flame ascended, Fair, laurell'd spirits seem'd to soar, Who thus in song their voices blended:— “Shine, shine for ever, glorious Flame, “Divinest gift of Gods to men! “From Greece thy earliest splendour came, “To Greece thy ray returns again. “Take, Freedom, take thy radiant round, “When dimm'd, revive, when lost, return, “Till not a shrine through earth be found, “On which thy glories shall not burn!” FABLE IV. THE FLY AND THE BULLOCK. PROEM. Of all that, to the sage's survey, This world presents of topsy-turvy, There's nought so much disturbs one's patience, As little minds in lofty stations. 'Tis like that sort of painful wonder, Which slender columns, labouring under Enormous arches, give beholders;— Or those poor Caryatides, Condemn'd to smile and stand at ease, With a whole house upon their shoulders. If, as in some few royal cases, Small minds are born into such places— If they are there, by Right Divine, Or any such sufficient reason, Why—Heav'n forbid we should repine!— To wish it otherwise were treason; Nay, ev'n to see it in a vision, Would be what lawyers call misprision. Sir Robert Filmer saith—and he, Of course, knew all about the matter— “Both men and beasts love Monarchy;” Which proves how rational—the latter. Sidney, we know, or wrong or right, Entirely differ'd from the Knight: Nay, hints a King may lose his head, By slipping awkwardly his bridle:— But this is treasonous, ill-bred, And (now-a-days, when Kings are led In patent snaffles) downright idle. No, no—it isn't right-line Kings, (Those sovereign lords in leading-strings Who, from their birth, are Faith-Defenders,) That move my wrath—'tis your pretenders, Your mushroom rulers, sons of earth, Who—not, like t'others, bores by birth, Establish'd gratiâ Dei blockheads, Born with three kingdoms in their pockets— Yet, with a brass that nothing stops, Push up into the loftiest stations, And, though too dull to manage shops, Presume, the dolts, to manage nations! This class it is, that moves my gall, And stirs up bile, and spleen, and all. While other senseless things appear To know the limits of their sphere— While not a cow on earth romances So much as to conceit she dances— While the most jumping frog we know of, Would scarce at Astley's hope to show off— Your ???s, your ???s dare, Untrain'd as are their minds, to set them To any business, any where, At any time that fools will let them. But leave we here these upstart things— My business is, just now, with Kings; To whom, and to their right-line glory, I dedicate the following story. FABLE. The wise men of Egypt were secret as dummies; And, ev'n when they most condescended to teach, They pack'd up their meaning, as they did their mummies, In so many wrappers, 'twas out of one's reach. They were also, good people, much given to Kings— Fond of craft and of crocodiles, monkeys and mystery; But blue-bottle flies were their best belov'd things— As will partly appear in this very short history. A Scythian philosopher (nephew, they say, To that other great traveller, young Anacharsis,) Stept into a temple at Memphis one day, To have a short peep at their mystical farces. He saw According to Ælian, it was in the island of Leucadia they practised this ceremony—????? ???? ???? ??????. —De Animal. lib. ii. cap. 8. a brisk blue-bottle Fly on an altar, Made much of, and worshipp'd, as something divine; While a large, handsome Bullock, led there in a halter, Before it lay stabb'd at the foot of the shrine. Surpris'd at such doings, he whisper'd his teacher— “If 'tisn't impertinent, may I ask why “Should a Bullock, that useful and powerful creature, “Be thus offer'd up to a blue-bottle Fly?” “No wonder”—said t'other—“you stare at the sight, “But we as a Symbol of Monarchy view it— “That Fly on the shrine is Legitimate Right, “And that Bullock, the People, that's sacrific'd to it.” FABLE V. CHURCH AND STATE. PROEM. “The moment any religion becomes national, or established, its purity must certainly be lost, because it is then impossible to keep it unconnected with men's interests; and, if connected, it must inevitably be perverted by them.” —Soame Jenyns. Thus did Soame Jenyns—though a Tory, A Lord of Trade and the Plantations; Feel how Religion's simple glory Is stain'd by State associations. When Catherine, ere she crush'd the Poles, Appeal'd to the benign Divinity; Then cut them up in protocols, Made fractions of their very souls Ames, demi-ames, &amp;c.— All in the name of the bless'd Trinity; Or when her grandson, Alexander, That mighty Northern salamander The salamander is supposed to have the power of extinguishing fire by its natural coldness and moisture., Whose icy touch, felt all about, Puts every fire of Freedom out— When he, too, winds up his Ukases With God and the Panagia's praises— When he, of royal Saints the type, In holy water dips the spunge, With which, at one imperial wipe, He would all human rights expunge; When Louis (whom as King, and eater, Some name Dix-huit, and some Des-huitres,) Calls down “St. Louis' God” to witness The right, humanity, and fitness Of sending eighty thousand Solons, Sages, with muskets and lac'd coats, To cram instruction, nolens volens, Down the poor struggling Spaniards' throats— I can't help thinking, (though to Kings I must, of course, like other men, bow,) That when a Christian monarch brings Religion's name to gloss these things— Such blasphemy out-Benbows Benbow! A well-known publisher of irreligious books. Or—not so far for facts to roam, Having a few much nearer home— When we see Churchmen, who, if ask'd, “Must Ireland's slaves be tith'd, and task'd, “And driv'n, like Negroes or Croäts, “That you may roll in wealth and bliss?” Look from beneath their shovel hats With all due pomp, and answer “Yes!” But then, if question'd, “Shall the brand “Intolerance flings throughout that land,— “Shall the fierce strife now taught to grow “Betwixt her palaces and hovels, “Be ever quench'd?”—from the same shovels Look grandly forth, and answer “No.”— Alas, alas! have these a claim To merciful Religion's name? If more you seek, go see a bevy Of bowing parsons at a levee— (Choosing your time, when straw's before Some apoplectic bishop's door,) Then, if thou canst, with life, escape That rush of lawn, that press of crape, Just watch their rev'rences and graces, As on each smirking suitor frisks, And say, if those round shining faces To heav'n or earth most turn their disks? This, this it is—Religion, made, 'Twixt Church and State, a truck, a trade— This most ill-match'd, unholy Co., From whence the ills we witness flow; The war of many creeds with one— Th' extremes of too much faith, and none— Till, betwixt ancient trash and new, 'Twixt Cant and Blasphemy—the two Rank ills with which this age is curst— We can no more tell which is worst, Than erst could Egypt, when so rich In various plagues, determine which She thought most pestilent and vile, Her frogs, like Benbow and Carlisle, Croaking their native mud-notes loud, Or her fat locusts, like a cloud Of pluralists, obesely lowering, At once benighting and devouring!— This—this it is—and here I pray Those sapient wits of the Reviews, Who make us poor, dull authors say, Not what we mean, but what they choose; Who to our most abundant shares Of nonsense add still more of theirs, And are to poets just such evils As caterpillars find those flies, “The greatest number of the ichneumon tribe are seen settling upon the back of the caterpillar, and darting at different intervals their stings into its body—at every dart they depose an egg.” —Goldsmith Which, not content to sting like devils, Lay eggs upon their backs likewise— To guard against such foul deposits Of other's meaning in my rhymes, (A thing more needful here, because it's A subject, ticklish in these times)— I, here, to all such wits make known, Monthly and Weekly, Whig and Tory, 'Tis this Religion—this alone— I aim at in the following story:— FABLE. When Royalty was young and bold, Ere, touch'd by Time, he had become— If 'tisn't civil to say old, At least, a ci-devant jeune homme; One evening, on some wild pursuit, Driving along, he chanc'd to see Religion, passing by on foot, And took him in his vis-à-vis. This said Religion was a Friar, The humblest and the best of men, Who ne'er had notion or desire Of riding in a coach till then. “I say”—quoth Royalty, who rather Enjoy'd a masquerading joke— “I say, suppose, my good old father, “You lend me, for a while, your cloak.” The Friar consented—little knew What tricks the youth had in his head; Besides, was rather tempted too By a lac'd coat he got in stead. Away ran Royalty, slap-dash, Scampering like mad about the town; Broke windows, shiver'd lamps to smash, And knock'd whole scores of watchmen down. While nought could they, whose heads were broke, Learn of the “why” or the “wherefore,” Except that 'twas Religion's cloak The gentleman, who crack'd them, wore. Meanwhile, the Friar, whose head was turn'd By the lac'd coat, grew frisky too; Look'd big—his former habits spurn'd— And storm'd about, as great men do: Dealt much in pompous oaths and curses— Said “d?mn you” often, or as bad— Laid claim to other people's purses— In short, grew either knave, or mad. As work like this was unbefitting, And flesh and blood no longer bore it, The Court of Common Sense, then sitting, Summon'd the culprits both before it. Where, after hours in wrangling spent (As Courts must wrangle to decide well), Religion to St. Luke's was sent, And Royalty pack'd off to Bridewell. With this proviso—should they be Restor'd, in due time, to their senses, They both must give security, In future, against such offences— Religion ne'er to lend his cloak, Seeing what dreadful work it leads to; And Royalty to crack his joke,— But not to crack poor people's heads too. FABLE VI. THE LITTLE GRAND LAMA. PROEM. Novella, a young Bolognese, The daughter of a learn'd Law Doctor, Andreas. Who had with all the subtleties Of old and modern jurists stock'd her, Was so exceeding fair, 'tis said, And over hearts held such dominion, That when her father, sick in bed, Or busy, sent her, in his stead, To lecture on the Code Justinian, She had a curtain drawn before her, Lest, if her charms were seen, the students Should let their young eyes wander o'er her, And quite forget their jurisprudence. Quand il étoit occupé d'aucune essoine, il envoyoit Novelle, sa fille, en son lieu lire aux escholes en charge, et, afin que la biaüté d'elle n'empêchât la pensée des oyants, elle avoit une petite courtine devant elle. —Christ. de Pise, Cité des Dames, p. 11. cap. 36. Just so it is with Truth, when seen, Too dazzling far,—'tis from behind A light, thin allegoric screen, She thus can safest teach mankind. FABLE. In Thibet once there reign'd, we're told, A little Lama, one year old— Rais'd to the throne, that realm to bless, Just when his little Holiness Had cut—as near as can be reckon'd— Some say his first tooth, some his second. Chronologers and Nurses vary, Which proves historians should be wary. We only know th' important truth, His Majesty had cut a tooth. See Turner's Embassy to Thibet for an account of his interview with the Lama.—“Teshoo Lama (he says) was at this time eighteen months old. Though he was unable to speak a word, he made the most expressive signs, and conducted himself with astonishing dignity and decorum.” And much his subjects were enchanted,— As well all Lamas' subjects may be, And would have giv'n their heads, if wanted, To make tee-totums for the baby. Thron'd as he was by Right Divine— (What Lawyers call Jure Divino, Meaning a right to yours, and mine, And every body's goods and rhino,) Of course, his faithful subjects' purses Were ready with their aids and succours; Nothing was seen but pension'd Nurses, And the land groan'd with bibs and tuckers. Oh! had there been a Hume or Bennet, Then sitting in the Thibet Senate, Ye Gods, what room for long debates Upon the Nursery Estimates! What cutting down of swaddling-clothes And pin-a-fores, in nightly battles! What calls for papers to expose The waste of sugar-plums and rattles! But no—if Thibet had M. P.'s, They were far better bred than these; Nor gave the slightest opposition, During the Monarch's whole dentition. But short this calm;—for, just when he Had reach'd th' alarming age of three, When Royal natures, and, no doubt, Those of all noble beasts break out— The Lama, who till then was quiet, Show'd symptoms of a taste for riot; And, ripe for mischief, early, late, Without regard for Church or State, Made free with whosoe'er came nigh; Tweak'd the Lord Chancellor by the nose, Turn'd all the Judges' wigs awry, And trod on the old Generals' toes; Pelted the Bishops with hot buns, Rode cock-horse on the City maces, And shot from little devilish guns, Hard peas into his subjects' faces. In short, such wicked pranks he play'd, And grew so mischievous, God bless him! That his Chief Nurse—with ev'n the aid Of an Archbishop—was afraid, When in these moods, to comb or dress him. Nay, ev'n the persons most inclin'd Through thick and thin, for Kings to stickle, Thought him (if they'd but speak their mind, Which they did not) an odious pickle. At length some patriot lords—a breed Of animals they've got in Thibet, Extremely rare, and fit, indeed, For folks like Pidcock, to exhibit— Some patriot lords, who saw the length To which things went, combin'd their strength, And penn'd a manly, plain and free Remonstrance to the Nursery; Protesting warmly that they yielded To none, that ever went before 'em, In loyalty to him who wielded Th' hereditary pap-spoon o'er 'em; That, as for treason, 'twas a thing That made them almost sick to think of— That they and theirs stood by the King, Throughout his measles and his chin-cough, When others, thinking him consumptive, Had ratted to the Heir Presumptive!— But, still—though much admiring Kings (And chiefly those in leading-strings), They saw, with shame and grief of soul, There was no longer now the wise And constitutional control Of birch before their ruler's eyes; But that, of late, such pranks, and tricks, And freaks occurr'd the whole day long, As all, but men with bishopricks, Allow'd, in ev'n a King, were wrong. Wherefore it was they humbly pray'd That Honourable Nursery, That such reforms be henceforth made, As all good men desir'd to see;— In other words (lest they might seem Too tedious), as the gentlest scheme For putting all such pranks to rest, And in its bud the mischief nipping— They ventur'd humbly to suggest His Majesty should have a whipping! When this was read, no Congreve rocket, Discharg'd into the Gallic trenches, E'er equall'd the tremendous shock it Produced upon the Nursery benches. The Bishops, who of course had votes, By right of age and petticoats, Were first and foremost in the fuss— “What, whip a Lama! suffer birch “To touch his sacred ? infamous! “Deistical!—assailing thus “The fundamentals of the Church!— “No—no—such patriot plans as these, “(So help them Heaven—and their Sees!) “They held to be rank blasphemies.” Th' alarm thus given, by these and other Grave ladies of the Nursery side, Spread through the land, till, such a pother, Such party squabbles, far and wide, Never in history's page had been Recorded, as were then between The Whippers and Non-whippers seen. Till, things arriving at a state, Which gave some fears of revolution, The patriot lords' advice, though late, Was put at last in execution. The Parliament of Thibet met— The little Lama, call'd before it, Did, then and there, his whipping get, And (as the Nursery Gazette Assures us) like a hero bore it. And though, 'mong Thibet Tories, some Lament that Royal Martyrdom (Please to observe, the letter D In this last word's pronounc'd like B), Yet to th' example of that Prince So much is Thibet's land a debtor, That her long line of Lamas, since, Have all behav'd themselves much better. FABLE VII. THE EXTINGUISHERS. PROEM. Though soldiers are the true supports, The natural allies of Courts, Woe to the Monarch, who depends Too much on his red-coated friends; For even soldiers sometimes think— Nay, Colonels have been known to reason,— And reasoners, whether clad in pink, Or red, or blue, are on the brink (Nine cases out of ten) of treason. Not many soldiers, I believe, are As fond of liberty as Mina; Else—woe to Kings, when Freedom's fever Once turns into a Scarletina! For then—but hold—'tis best to veil My meaning in the following tale:— FABLE. A Lord of Persia, rich and great, Just come into a large estate, Was shock'd to find he had, for neighbours, Close to his gate, some rascal Ghebers, Whose fires, beneath his very nose, In heretic combustion rose. But Lords of Persia can, no doubt, Do what they will—so, one fine morning, He turn'd the rascal Ghebers out, First giving a few kicks for warning. Then, thanking heaven most piously, He knock'd their Temple to the ground, Blessing himself for joy to see Such Pagan ruins strew'd around. But much it vex'd my Lord to find, That, while all else obey'd his will, The Fire these Ghebers left behind, Do what he would, kept burning still. Fiercely he storm'd, as if his frown Could scare the bright insurgent down; But, no—such fires are headstrong things, And care not much for Lords or Kings. Scarce could his Lordship well contrive The flashes in one place to smother, Before—hey presto!—all alive, They sprung up freshly in another. At length when, spite of prayers and damns, 'Twas found the sturdy flame defied him, His stewards came, with low salams, Offering, by contract, to provide him Some large Extinguishers, (a plan, Much us'd, they said, at Ispahan, Vienna, Petersburgh—in short, Wherever Light's forbid at court,) Machines no Lord should be without, Which would, at once, put promptly out All kinds of fires,—from staring, stark Volcanos to the tiniest spark; Till all things slept as dull and dark, As, in a great Lord's neighbourhood, 'Twas right and fitting all things should. Accordingly, some large supplies Of these Extinguishers were furnish'd (All of the true Imperial size), And there, in rows, stood black and burnish'd, Ready, where'er a gleam but shone Of light or fire, to be clapp'd on. But, ah, how lordly wisdom errs, In trusting to extinguishers! One day, when he had left all sure, (At least, so thought he) dark, secure— The flame, at all its exits, entries, Obstructed to his heart's content, And black extinguishers, like sentries, Plac'd over every dangerous vent— Ye Gods, imagine his amaze, His wrath, his rage, when, on returning, He found not only the old blaze, Brisk as before, crackling and burning,— Not only new, young conflagrations, Popping up round in various stations— But, still more awful, strange, and dire, Th' Extinguishers themselves on fire!! The idea of this Fable was caught from one of those brilliant mots, which abound in the conversation of my friend, the author of the “Letters to Julia,”—a production which contains some of the happiest specimens of playful poetry that have appeared in this or any age. They, they—those trusty, blind machines His Lordship had so long been praising, As, under Providence, the means Of keeping down all lawless blazing, Were now, themselves—alas, too true The shameful fact—turn'd blazers too, And, by a change as odd as cruel, Istead of dampers, served for fuel! Thus, of his only hope bereft, “What,” said the great man, “must be done?”— All that, in scrapes like this, is left To great men is—to cut and run. So run he did; while to their grounds, The banish'd Ghebers blest return'd; And, though their Fire had broke its bounds, And all abroad now wildly burn'd, Yet well could they, who lov'd the flame, Its wand'ring, its excess reclaim; And soon another, fairer Dome Arose to be its sacred home, Where, cherish'd, guarded, not confin'd, The living glory dwelt inshrin'd, And, shedding lustre strong, but even, Though born of earth, grew worthy heav'n. MORAL. The moral hence my Muse infers Is, that such Lords are simple elves, In trusting to Extinguishers, That are combustible themselves. FABLE VIII. LOUIS FOURTEENTH'S WIG. The money rais'd—the army ready— Drums beating, and the Royal Neddy Valiantly braying in the van, To the old tune “Eh, eh, Sire Âne!” They celebrated in the dark ages, at many churches, particularly at Rouen, what was called the Feast of the Ass. On this occasion the ass, finely drest, was brought before the altar, and they sung before him this elegant anthem, “Eh, eh, eh, Sire Âne, eh, eh, eh, Sire Âne.” —Warton's Essay on Pope.— Nought wanting, but some coup dramatic, To make French sentiment explode, Bring in, at once, the goût fanatic, And make the war “la dernière mode”— Instantly, at the Pav'llon Marsan, Is held an Ultra consultation— What's to be done, to help the farce on? What stage-effect, what decoration, To make this beauteous France forget, In one, grand, glorious pirouette, All she had sworn to but last week, And, with a cry of “Magnifique!” Rush forth to this, or any war, Without inquiring once—“What for?” After some plans propos'd by each, Lord Chateaubriand made a speech, (Quoting, to show what men's rights are, Or rather what men's rights should be, From Hobbes, Lord Castlereagh, the Czar, And other friends to Liberty,) Wherein he—having first protested 'Gainst humouring the mob—suggested (As the most high-bred plan he saw For giving the new War éclat) A grand, Baptismal Melo-drame, To be got up at Nôtre Dame, In which the Duke (who, bless his Highness! Had by his hilt acquir'd such fame, 'Twas hop'd that he as little shyness Would show, when to the point he came,) Should, for his deeds so lion-hearted, Be christen'd Hero, ere he started; With power, by Royal Ordonnance, To bear that name—at least in France. Himself—the Viscount Chateaubriand— (To help th' affair with more esprit on) Offering, for this baptismal rite, Some of his own fam'd Jordan water Brought from the river Jordan by M. Chateaubriand, and presented to the French Empress for the christening of young Napoleon.— (Marie Louise not having quite Used all that, for young Nap, he brought her,) The baptism, in this case, to be Applied to that extremity, Which Bourbon heroes most expose; And which (as well all Europe knows) Happens to be, in this Defender Of the true Faith, extremely tender. See the Duke's celebrated letter to madame, written during his campaign in 1815, in which he says, “J'ai le posterieur légèrement endommagé.” Or if (the Viscount said) this scheme Too rash and premature should seem— If thus discounting heroes, on tick— This glory, by anticipation, Was too much in the genre romantique For such a highly classic nation, He begg'd to say, the Abyssinians A practice had in their dominions, Which, if at Paris got up well, In full costume, was sure to tell. At all great epochs, good or ill, They have, says Bruce (and Bruce ne'er budges From the strict truth), a Grand Quadrille In public danc'd by the Twelve Judges “On certain great occasions, the twelve Judges (who are generally between sixty and seventy years of age) sing the song and dance the figure-dance,” &amp;c. —Book v.— And, he assures us, the grimaces, The entre-chats, the airs and graces Of dancers, so profound and stately, Divert the Abyssinians greatly. “Now (said the Viscount), there's but few “Great Empires, where this plan would do: “For instance, England;—let them take “What pains they would—'twere vain to strive— “The twelve stiff Judges there would make “The worst Quadrille-set now alive. “One must have seen them, ere one could “Imagine properly Judge Wood, “Performing, in his wig, so gaily, “A queue-de-chat with Justice Bailey! “French Judges, though, are, by no means, “This sort of stiff, be-wigg'd machines; “And we, who've seen them at Saumur, “And Poitiers lately, may be sure “They'd dance quadrilles, or any thing, “That would be pleasing to the King— “Nay, stand upon their heads, and more do, “To please the little Duke de Bordeaux!” After these several schemes there came Some others—needless now to name, Since that, which Monsieur plann'd, himself, Soon doom'd all others to the shelf, And was receiv'd par acclamation, As truly worthy the Grande Nation. It seems (as Monsieur told the story) That Louis the Fourteenth,—that glory, That Coryphée of all crown'd pates,— That pink of the Legitimates— Had, when, with many a pious pray'r, he Bequeath'd unto the Virgin Mary His marriage deeds, and cordon bleu “Louis XIV. fit présent à la Vierge de son cordon bleu, que l'on conserve soigneusement, et lui envoya ensuite, son Contrat de Mariage et le Traité des Pyrenées, magnifiquement relié.” —Mémoires, Anecdotes pour servir, &amp;c., Bequeath'd to her his State Wig too— (An offering which, at Court, 'tis thought, The Virgin values as she ought)— That Wig, the wonder of all eyes, The Cynosure of Gallia's skies, To watch and tend whose curls ador'd, Re-build its towering roof, when flat, And round its rumpled base, a Board Of sixty Barbers daily sat The learned author of Recherches Historiques sur les Perruques says that the Board consisted but of Forty—the same number as the Academy. “Le plus beau tems des perruques fut celui où Louis XIV. commenç à porter, lui-même, perruque; ? On ignore l'époque où se fit cette révolution; mais on sait qu'elle engagea Louis le Grand à y donner ses soins paternels, en créant, en 1656, quarante charges de perruquiers, suivant la cour; et en 1673, il forma un corps de deux cents perruquiers pour la Ville de Paris.” —P. 111., With Subs, on State-Days, to assist, Well pension'd from the Civil List:— That wondrous Wig, array'd in which, And form'd alike to awe or witch, He beat all other heirs of crowns, In taking mistresses and towns, Requiring but a shot at one, A smile at t'other, and 'twas done!— “That Wig (said Monsieur, while his brow Rose proudly,) “is existing now;— “That Grand Perruque, amid the fall Of every other Royal glory, “With curls erect survives them all, “And tells in every hair their story. “Think, think, how welcome at this time “A relic, so belov'd, sublime! “What worthier standard of the Cause “Of Kingly Right can France demand? “Or who among our ranks can pause “To guard it, while a curl shall stand? “Behold, my friends—(while thus he cried, A curtain, which conceal'd this pride Of Princely Wigs was drawn aside) “Behold that grand Perruque—how big “With recollections for the world— “For France—for us—Great Louis' Wig, “By Hippolyte A celebrated Coiffeur of the present day. new frizz'd and curl'd— “New frizz'd! alas, 'tis but too true, “Well may you start at that word new— “But such the sacrifice, my friends, “Th' Imperial Cossack recommends; “Thinking such small concessions sage, “To meet the spirit of the age, “And do what best that spirit flatters, “In Wigs—if not in weightier matters. “Wherefore, to please the Czar, and show “That we too, much-wrong'd Bourbons, know “What liberalism in Monarchs is, “We have conceded the New Friz! “Thus arm'd, ye gallant Ultras, say, “Can men, can Frenchmen, fear the fray? “With this proud relic in our van, “And D'Angoulême our worthy leader, “Let rebel Spain do all she can, “Let recreant England arm and feed her,— “Urg'd by that pupil of Hunt's school, “That Radical, Lord Liverpool— “France can have nought to fear—far from it— “When once astounded Europe sees “The Wig of Louis, like a Comet, “Streaming above the Pyrenées, “All's o'er with Spain—then on, my sons, “On, my incomparable Duke, “And, shouting for the Holy Ones, “Cry Vive la Guerre—et la Perruque!” RHYMES ON THE ROAD, EXTRACTED FROM THE JOURNAL OF A TRAVELLING MEMBER OF THE POCO-CURANTE SOCIETY, 1819. The greater part of the following Rhymes were written or composed in an old calêche, for the purpose of beguiling the ennui of solitary travelling; and as verses, made by a gentleman in his sleep, have been lately called “a psychological curiosity,” it is to be hoped that verses, composed by a gentleman to keep himself awake, may be honoured with some appellation equally Greek. INTRODUCTORY RHYMES. Different Attitudes in which Authors compose.—Bayes, Henry Stephens, Herodotus, &amp;c.—Writing in Bed—in the Fields. —Plato and Sir Richard Blackmore.—Fiddling with Gloves and Twigs.—Madame de Staël.—Rhyming on the Road, in an old Calêche. What various attitudes, and ways, And tricks, we authors have in writing! While some write sitting, some, like Bayes, Usually stand, while they're inditing. Poets there are, who wear the floor out, Measuring a line at every stride; While some, like Henry Stephens, pour out Rhymes by the dozen, while they ride. Pleraque sua carmina equitans composuit. —Paravicin. Singular. Herodotus wrote most in bed; And Richerand, a French physician, Declares the clock-work of the head Goes best in that reclin'd position. If you consult Montaigne “Mes pensées dorment, si je les assis.” —Montaigne. Animus eorum qui in aperto aere ambulant, attollitur. Pliny. and Pliny on The subject, 'tis their joint opinion That Thought its richest harvest yields Abroad, among the woods and fields; That bards, who deal in small retail, At home may, at their counters, stop; But that the grove, the hill, the vale, Are Poesy's true wholesale shop. And, verily, I think they're right— For, many a time, on summer eves, Just at that closing hour of light, When, like an Eastern Prince, who leaves For distant war his Haram bowers, The Sun bids farewell to the flowers, Whose heads are sunk, whose tears are flowing Mid all the glory of his going!— Ev'n I have felt, beneath those beams, When wand'ring through the fields alone, Thoughts, fancies, intellectual gleams, Which, far too bright to be my own, Seem'd lent me by the Sunny Power, That was abroad at that still hour. If thus I've felt, how must they feel, The few, whom genuine Genius warms; Upon whose souls he stamps his seal, Graven with Beauty's countless forms;— The few upon this earth, who seem Born to give truth to Plato's dream, Since in their thoughts, as in a glass, Shadows of heavenly things appear, Reflections of bright shapes that pass Through other worlds, above our sphere! But this reminds me I digress;— For Plato, too, produc'd, 'tis said, (As one, indeed, might almost guess,) His glorious visions all in bed. The only authority I know for imputing this practice to Plato and Herodotus, is a Latin poem by M. de Valois on his Bed, in which he says:— Lucifer Herodotum vidit Vesperque cubantem, Desedit totos heic Plato sæpe dies. 'Twas in his carriage the sublime Sir Richard Blackmore used to rhyme; And (if the wits don't do him wrong) 'Twixt death Sir Richard Blackmore was a physician, as well as a bad poet. and epics pass'd his time, Scribbling and killing all day long— Like Phœbus in his car, at ease, Now warbling forth a lofty song, Now murdering the young Niobes. There was a hero 'mong the Danes, Who wrote, we're told, 'mid all the pains And horrors of exenteration, Nine charming odes, which, if you'll look, You'll find preserv'd, with a translation, By Bartholinus in his book. Eâdem curâ nec minores inter cruciatus animam infelicem agenti fuit Asbiorno Prudæ Danico heroi, cum Bruso ipsum, intestina extrahens, immaniter torqueret, tunc enim novem carmina cecinit, &amp;c. —Bartholin. de Causis Contempt. Mort. In short, 'twere endless to recite The various modes in which men write. Some wits are only in the mind, When beaus and belles are round them prating; Some, when they dress for dinner, find Their muse and valet both in waiting; And manage, at the self-same time, To' adjust a neckcloth and a rhyme. Some bards there are who cannot scribble Without a glove, to tear or nibble; Or a small twig to whisk about— As if the hidden founts of Fancy, Like wells of old, were thus found out By mystic tricks of rhabdomancy. Such was the little feathery wand Made of paper, twisted up like a fan or feather., That, held for ever in the hand Of her Madame de Staël., who won and wore the crown Of female genius in this age, Seem'd the conductor, that drew down Those words of lightning to her page. As for myself—to come, at last, To the odd way in which I write— Having employ'd these few months past Chiefly in travelling, day and night, I've got into the easy mode, Of rhyming thus along the road— Making a way-bill of my pages, Counting my stanzas by my stages— 'Twixt lays and re-lays no time lost— In short, in two words, writing post. EXTRACT I. Geneva. View of the Lake of Geneva from the Jura. Between Vattay and Gex.—Anxious to reach it before the Sun went down.—Obliged to proceed on Foot.— Alps.—Mont Blanc.—Effect of the Scene. 'Twas late—the sun had almost shone His last and best, when I ran on, Anxious to reach that splendid view, Before the day-beams quite withdrew; And feeling as all feel, on first Approaching scenes, where, they are told, Such glories on their eyes will burst, As youthful bards in dreams behold. 'Twas distant yet, and, as I ran, Full often was my wistful gaze Turn'd to the sun, who now began To call in all his out-post rays, And form a denser march of light, Such as beseems a hero's flight. Oh, how I wish'd for Joshua's power, To stay the brightness of that hour! But no—the sun still less became, Diminish'd to a speck, as splendid And small as were those tongues of flame, That on th' Apostles' heads descended! 'Twas at this instant—while there glow'd This last, intensest gleam of light— Suddenly, through the opening road, The valley burst upon my sight! That glorious valley, with its Lake, And Alps on Alps in clusters swelling, Mighty, and pure, and fit to make The ramparts of a Godhead's dwelling. I stood entranc'd—as Rabbins say This whole assembled, gazing world Will stand, upon that awful day, When the Ark's Light, aloft unfurl'd, Among the opening clouds shall shine, Divinity's own radiant sign! Mighty Mont Blanc, thou wert to me, That minute, with thy brow in heaven, As sure a sign of Deity As e'er to mortal gaze was given. Nor ever, were I destined yet To live my life twice o'er again, Can I the deep-felt awe forget, The dream, the trance that rapt me then! 'Twas all that consciousness of power And life, beyond this mortal hour;— Those mountings of the soul within At thoughts of Heav'n—as birds begin By instinct in the cage to rise, When near their time for change of skies;— That proud assurance of our claim To rank among the Sons of Light, Mingled with shame—oh bitter shame!— At having risk'd that splendid right, For aught that earth through all its range Of glories, offers in exchange! 'Twas all this, at that instant brought, Like breaking sunshine, o'er my thought— 'Twas all this, kindled to a glow Of sacred zeal, which, could it shine Thus purely ever, man might grow, Ev'n upon earth a thing divine, And be, once more, the creature made To walk unstain'd th' Elysian shade! No, never shall I lose the trace Of what I've felt in this bright place. And, should my spirit's hope grow weak, Should I, oh God, e'er doubt thy power, This mighty scene again I'll seek, At the same calm and glowing hour, And here, at the sublimest shrine That Nature ever rear'd to Thee, Rekindle all that hope divine, And feel my immortality! EXTRACT II. FATE OF GENEVA IN THE YEAR 1782. A FRAGMENT. Geneva. Yes—if there yet live some of those, Who, when this small Republic rose, Quick as a startled hive of bees, Against her leaguering enemies— In the year 1782, when the forces of Berne, Sardinia, and France laid siege to Geneva, and when, after a demonstration of heroism and self-devotion, which promised to rival the feats of their ancestors in 1602 against Savoy, the Genevans, either panic-struck or betrayed, to the surprise of all Europe, opened their gates to the besiegers, and submitted without a struggle to the extinction of their liberties. —See an account of this Revolution in Coxe's Switzerland. When, as the Royal Satrap shook His well-known fetters at her gates, Ev'n wives and mothers arm'd, and took Their stations by their sons and mates; And on these walls there stood—yet, no, Shame to the traitors—would have stood As firm a band as e'er let flow At Freedom's base their sacred blood; If those yet live, who, on that night, When all were watching, girt for fight, Stole, like the creeping of a pest, From rank to rank, from breast to breast, Filling the weak, the old with fears,— Turning the heroine's zeal to tears,— Betraying Honour to that brink, Where, one step more, and he must sink— And quenching hopes, which, though the last, Like meteors on a drowning mast, Would yet have led to death more bright, Than life e'er look'd, in all its light! Till soon, too soon, distrust, alarms Throughout th' embattled thousands ran, And the high spirit, late in arms, The zeal, that might have work'd such charms, Fell, like a broken talisman— Their gates, that they had sworn should be The gates of Death, that very dawn, Gave passage widely, bloodlessly, To the proud foe—nor sword was drawn, Nor ev'n one martyr'd body cast To stain their footsteps, as they pass'd; But, of the many sworn at night To do or die, some fled the sight, Some stood to look, with sullen frown, While some, in impotent despair, Broke their bright armour and lay down, Weeping, upon the fragments there!— If those, I say, who brought that shame, That blast upon Geneva's name, Be living still—though crime so dark Shall hang up, fix'd and unforgiven, In History's page, th' eternal mark For Scorn to pierce—so help me, Heaven, I wish the traitorous slaves no worse, No deeper, deadlier disaster, From all earth's ills no fouler curse Than to have ? their master! EXTRACT III. Geneva. Fancy and Truth.—Hippomenes and Atalanta.—Mont Blanc.—Clouds. Even here, in this region of wonders, I find That light-footed Fancy leaves Truth far behind; Or, at least, like Hippomenes, turns her astray By the golden illusions he flings in her way. ? nitidique cupidine pomi Declinat cursus, aurumque volubile tollit. Ovid. What a glory it seem'd the first evening I gaz'd! Mont Blanc, like a vision, then suddenly rais'd On the wreck of the sunset—and all his array Of high-towering Alps, touch'd still with a light Far holier, purer than that of the Day, As if nearness to Heaven had made them so bright! Then the dying, at last, of these splendours away From peak after peak, till they left but a ray, One roseate ray, that, too precious to fly, O'er the Mighty of Mountains still glowingly hung, Like the last sunny step of Astræa, when high From the summit of earth to Elysium she sprung! And those infinite Alps, stretching out from the sight Till they mingled with Heaven, now shorn of their light, Stood lofty, and lifeless, and pale in the sky, Like the ghosts of a Giant Creation gone by! That scene—I have view'd it this evening again, By the same brilliant light that hung over it then— The valley, the lake in their tenderest charms— Mont Blanc in his awfullest pomp—and the whole A bright picture of Beauty, reclin'd in the arms Of Sublimity, bridegroom elect of her soul! But where are the mountains, that round me at first, One dazzling horizon of miracles, burst? Those Alps beyond Alps, without end swelling on Like the waves of eternity—where are they gone? Clouds—clouds—they were nothing but clouds, after all! It is often very difficult to distinguish between clouds and Alps; and on the evening when I first saw this magnificent scene, the clouds were so disposed along the whole horizon, as to deceive me into an idea of the stupendous extent of these mountains, which my subsequent observation was very far, of course, from confirming. That chain of Mont Blancs, which my fancy flew o'er, With a wonder that nought on this earth can recall, Were but clouds of the evening, and now are no more. What a picture of Life's young illusions! Oh, Night, Drop thy curtain, at once, and hide all from my sight. EXTRACT IV. Milan.

While see, among the clouds, their eldest brother, But just flown up, tells with a smile of bliss This prank of Pluto to his charmed mother, Who turns to greet the tidings with a kiss! Well might the Loves rejoice—and well did they, Who wove these fables, picture, in their weaving, That blessed truth, (which, in a darker day, Origen lost his saintship for believing The extension of the Divine Love ultimately even to the regions of the damned.,)— That Love, eternal Love, whose fadeless ray Nor time, nor death, nor sin can overcast, Ev'n to the depths of hell will find his way, And soothe, and heal, and triumph there at last! Guercino's Agar—where the bond-maid hears From Abram's lips that he and she must part; And looks at him with eyes all full of tears, That seem the very last drops from her heart. Exquisite picture!—let me not be told Of minor faults, of colouring tame and cold— If thus to conjure up a face so fair It is probable that this fine head is a portrait, as we find it repeated in a picture by Guercino, which is in the possession of Signor Camuccini, the brother of the celebrated painter at Rome., So full of sorrow; with the story there Of all that woman suffers, when the stay Her trusting heart hath lean'd on falls away— If thus to touch the bosom's tenderest spring, By calling into life such eyes, as bring Back to our sad remembrance some of those We've smil'd and wept with, in their joys and woes, Thus filling them with tears, like tears we've known, Till all the pictur'd grief becomes our own— If this be deem'd the victory of Art— If thus, by pen or pencil, to lay bare The deep, fresh, living fountains of the heart Before all eyes, be Genius—it is there! EXTRACT V. Padua. Fancy and Reality.—Rain-drops and Lakes.—Plan of a Story. —Where to place the Scene of it.—In some unknown Region. Psalmanazar's Imposture with respect to the Island of Formosa. The more I've view'd this world, the more I've found, That, fill'd as 'tis with scenes and creatures rare, Fancy commands, within her own bright round, A world of scenes and creatures far more fair. Nor is it that her power can call up there A single charm, that's not from Nature won, No more than rainbows, in their pride, can wear A single hue unborrow'd from the sun— But 'tis the mental medium it shines through, That lends to Beauty all its charm and hue; As the same light, that o'er the level lake One dull monotomy of lustre flings, Will, entering in the rounded rain-drop, make Colours as gay as those on Peris' wings! And such, I deem, the diff'rence between real, Existing Beauty and that form ideal, Which she assumes, when seen by poets' eyes, Like sunshine in the drop—with all those dyes, Which Fancy's variegating prism supplies. I have a story of two lovers, fill'd With all the pure romance, the blissful sadness, And the sad, doubtful bliss, that ever thrill'd Two young and longing hearts in that sweet madness. But where to choose the region of my vision In this wide, vulgar world—what real spot Can be found out sufficiently Elysian For two such perfect lovers, I know not. Oh for some fair Formosa, such as he, The young Jew fabled of, in the' Indian Sea, By nothing, but its name of Beauty, known, And which Queen Fancy might make all her own, Her fairy kingdom—take its people, lands, And tenements into her own bright hands, And make, at least, one earthly corner fit For Love to live in, pure and exquisite!

The Fall of Venice not to be lamented.—Former Glory.—Expedition against Constantinople.—Giustinianis.—Republic. —Characteristics of the old Government.—Golden Book.— Brazen Mouths.—Spies.—Dungeons.—Present Desolation. Mourn not for Venice—let her rest In ruin, 'mong those States unblest, Beneath whose gilded hoofs of pride, Where'er they trampled, Freedom died. No—let us keep our tears for them, Where'er they pine, whose fall hath been Not from a blood-stain'd diadem, Like that which deck'd this ocean-queen, But from high daring in the cause Of human Rights—the only good And blessed strife, in which man draws His mighty sword on land or flood. Mourn not for Venice; though her fall Be awful, as if Ocean's wave Swept o'er her, she deserves it all, And Justice triumphs o'er her grave. Thus perish ev'ry King and State, That run the guilty race she ran, Strong but in ill, and only great By outrage against God and man! True, her high spirit is at rest, And all those days of glory gone, When the world's waters, east and west, Beneath her white-wing'd commerce shone; When, with her countless barks she went To meet the Orient Empire's might Under the Doge Michaeli, in 1171., And her Giustinianis sent Their hundred heroes to that fight. “La famille entière des Justiniani, l'une des plus illustres de Venise, voulut marcher toute entière dans cette expédition; elle fournit cent combattans; c'était renouveler l'exemple d'une illustre famille de Rome; le même malheur les attendait.’ —Histoire de Venise, par Daru. Vanish'd are all her pomps, 'tis true, But mourn them not—for vanish'd, too, (Thanks to that Power, who, soon or late, Hurls to the dust the guilty Great,) Are all the outrage, falsehood, fraud, The chains, the rapine, and the blood, That fill'd each spot, at home, abroad, Where the Republic's standard stood. Desolate Venice! when I track Thy haughty course through centuries back; Thy ruthless power, obey'd but curst— The stern machinery of thy State, Which hatred would, like steam, have burst, Had stronger fear not chill'd ev'n hate;— Thy perfidy, still worse than aught Thy own unblushing Sarpi The celebrated Fra Paolo. The collection of Maxims which this bold monk drew up at the request of the Venetian Government, for the guidance of the Secret Inquisition of State, are so atrocious as to seem rather an over-charged satire upon despotism, than a system of policy, seriously inculcated, and but too readily and constantly pursued. The spirit, in which these maxims of Father Paul are conceived, may be judged from the instructions which he gives for the management of the Venetian colonies and provinces. Of the former he says:—“Il faut les traiter comme des animaux féroces, les rogner les dents, et les griffes, les humilier souvent, surtout leur ôter les occasions de s'aguerrir. Du pain et le bâton, voilà ce qu'il leur faut; gardons l'humanité pour une meilleure occasion.” For the treatment of the provinces he advises thus:— “Tendre à dépouiller les villes de leurs privilèges, faire que les habitans s'appauvrissent, et que leurs biens soient achetés par les Vénitiens. Ceux qui, dans les conseils municipaux, se montreront ou plus audacieux ou plus dévoués aux intérêts de la population, il faut les perdre ou les gagner à quelque prix que ce soit: enfin, s'il se trouve dans les provinces quelques chefs de parti, il faut les exterminer sous un prétexte quelconque, mais en évitant de recourir à la justice ordinaire. Que le poison fasse l'office de bourreau, cela est moins odieux et beaucoup plus profitable.” taught;— Thy friendship, which, o'er all beneath Its shadow, rain'd down dews of death Conduct of Venice towards her allies and dependencies, particularly to unfortunate Padua.—Fate of Francesco Carrara, for which see Daru, vol. ii. p. 141.;— Thy Oligarchy's Book of Gold, Clos'd against humble Virtue's name “À l'exception des trente citadins admis au grand conseil pendant la guerre de Chiozzi, il n'est pas arrivé une seule fois que les talens ou les services aient paru à cette noblesse orgueilleuse des titres suffisans pour s'asseoir avec elle.” —Daru., But open'd wide for slaves who sold Their native land to thee and shame Among those admitted to the honour of being inscribed in the Libro d'oro were some families of Brescia, Treviso, and other places, whose only claim to that distinction was the zeal with which they prostrated themselves and their country at the feet of the republic.;— Thy all-pervading host of spies, Watching o'er every glance and breath, Till men look'd in each others' eyes, To read their chance of life or death;— Thy laws, that made a mart of blood, And legaliz'd the assassin's knife By the infamous statutes of the State Inquisition M. Daru has given an abstract of these Statutes, from a manuscript in the Bibliothêque du Roi, and it is hardly credible that such a system of treachery and cruelty should ever have been established by any government, or submitted to, for an instant, by any people. Among various precautions against the intrigues of their own Nobles, we find the following:— “Pour persuader aux étrangers qu'il était difficile et dangereux d'entretenir quelqu' intrigue secrète avec les nobles Vénitiens, on imagina de faire avertir mystérieusement le Nonce du Pape (afin que les autres ministres en fussent informés) que l'Inquisition avait autorisé les patriciens à poignarder quiconque essaierait de tenter leur fidélité. Mais craignant que les ambassadeurs ne prêtassent foi difficilement à une délibération, qui en effet n'existait pas, l'Inquisition voulait prouver qu'elle en était capable. Elle ordonna des recherches pour découvrir s'il n'y avait pas dans Venise quelque exilé au-dessus du commun, qui eût rompu son ban; ensuite un des patriciens qui étaient aux gages du tribunal, reçut la mission d'assassiner ce malheureux, et l'ordre de s'en vanter, en disant qu'il s'était porté à cet acte, parce que ce banni était l'agent d'un ministre étranger, et avait cherché à le corrompre.”—“Remarquons,” adds M. Daru, “que ceci n'est pas une simple anecdote; c'est une mission projetée, délibérée, écrite d'avance; une règle de conduite tracée par des hommes graves à leurs successeurs, et consignée dans des statuts.” The cases, in which assassination is ordered by these Statutes, are as follow:— “Un ouvrier de l'arsenal, un chef de ce qu'on appelle parmi les marins le menstrance, passait-il au service d'une puissance étrangère: il fallait le faire assassiner, surtout si c'était un homme réputé brave et habile dans sa profession.” (Art. 3. des Statuts.) “Avait-il commis quelque action qu'on ne jugeait pas à propos de punir juridiquement, on devait le faire empoisonner,” (Art. 14.) “Un artisan passait-il à l'étranger en y exportant quelque procédé de l'industrie nationale: c'était encore un crime capital, que la loi inconnue ordonnait de punir par un assassinat.” (Art. 26.) The facility with which they got rid of their Duke of Bedfords, Lord Fitzwilliams, &amp;c. was admirable: it was thus:— “Le patricien qui se permettait le moindre propos contre le gouvernement, était admonété deux fois, et à la troisième noyé comme incorrigible.” (Art. 39.), not only was assassination recognized as a regular mode of punishment, but this secret power over life was delegated to their minions at a distance, with nearly as much facility as a licence is given under the game laws of England. The only restriction seems to have been the necessity of applying for a new certificate, after every individual exercise of the power.;— Thy sunless cells beneath the flood, And racks, and Leads “Les prisons des plombs; c'est-à-dire ces fournaises ardentes qu'on avait distribuées en petites cellule sous les terrasses qui couvrent le palais.”, that burnt out life;— When I review all this, and see The doom that now hath fall'n on thee; Thy nobles, towering once so proud, Themselves beneath the yoke now bow'd,— A yoke, by no one grace redeem'd, Such as, of old, around thee beam'd, But mean and base as e'er yet gall'd Earth's tyrants, when, themselves, enthrall'd,— I feel the moral vengeance sweet, And, smiling o'er the wreck, repeat “Thus perish every King and State, “That tread the steps which Venice trod, “Strong but in ill, and only great, “By outrage against man and God!” EXTRACT VII. Venice. Lord Byron's Memoirs, written by himself.—Reflections, when about to read them. Let me, a moment,—ere with fear and hope Of gloomy, glorious things, these leaves I ope— As one, in fairy tale, to whom the key Of some enchanter's secret halls is given, Doubts, while he enters, slowly, tremblingly, If he shall meet with shapes from hell or heaven— Let me, a moment, think what thousands live O'er the wide earth this instant, who would give, Gladly, whole sleepless nights to bend the brow Over these precious leaves, as I do now. How all who know—and where is he unknown? To what far region have his songs not flown, Like Psaphon's birds Psaphon, in order to attract the attention of the world, taught multitudes of birds to speak his name, and then let them fly away in various directions: whence the proverb, “Psaphonis aves.”, speaking their master's name, In ev'ry language, syllabled by Fame?— How all, who've felt the various spells combin'd Within the circle of that master-mind,— Like spells, deriv'd from many a star, and met Together in some wond'rous amulet,— Would burn to know when first the Light awoke In his young soul,—and if the gleams that broke From that Aurora of his genius, rais'd Most pain or bliss in those on whom they blaz'd; Would love to trace th' unfolding of that power, Which hath grown ampler, grander, every hour; And feel, in watching o'er his first advance, As did th' Egyptian traveller Bruce., when he stood By the young Nile, and fathom'd with his lance The first small fountains of that mighty flood. They, too, who, mid the scornful thoughts that dwell In his rich fancy, tinging all its streams,— As if the Star of Bitterness, which fell On earth of old “And the name of the star is called Wormwood, and the third part of the waters became wormwood.” —Rev. viii., had touch'd them with its beams,— Can track a spirit, which, though driven to hate, From Nature's hands came kind, affectionate; And which, ev'n now, struck as it is with blight, Comes out, at times, in love's own native light;— How gladly all, who've watch'd these struggling rays Of a bright, ruin'd spirit through his lays, Would here inquire, as from his own frank lips, What desolating grief, what wrongs had driven That noble nature into cold eclipse; Like some fair orb that, once a sun in heaven, And born, not only to surprise, but cheer With warmth and lustre all within its sphere, Is now so quench'd, that of its grandeur lasts Nought, but the wide, cold shadow which it casts! Eventful volume! whatsoe'er the change Of scene and clime—th' adventures, bold and strange— The griefs—the frailties, but too frankly told— The loves, the feuds thy pages may unfold, If Truth with half so prompt a hand unlocks His virtues as his failings, we shall find The record there of friendships, held like rocks, And enmities, like sun-touch'd snow, resign'd; Of fealty, cherish'd without change or chill, In those who serv'd him, young, and serve him still; Of generous aid, giv'n with that noiseless art Which wakes not pride, to many a wounded heart; Of acts—but, no—not from himself must aught Of the bright features of his life be sought. While they, who court the world, like Milton's cloud “Did a sable cloud Turn forth her silver lining on the night?” Comus., “Turn forth their silver lining” on the crowd, This gifted Being wraps himself in night; And, keeping all that softens, and adorns, And gilds his social nature hid from sight, Turns but its darkness on a world he scorns.

That maid, whose lips would still have mov'd, Could art have breath'd a spirit through them; Whose varying charms her artist lov'd More fondly every time he drew them, (So oft beneath his touch they pass'd, Each semblance fairer than the last); Wearing each shape that Fancy's range Offers to Love—yet still the one Fair idol, seen through every change, Like facets of some orient stone,— In each the same bright image shown. Sometimes a Venus, unarray'd But in her beauty In the Tribune at Florence.—sometimes deck'd In costly raiment, as a maid That kings might for a throne select. In the Palazzo Pitti. Now high and proud, like one who thought The world should at her feet be brought; Now, with a look reproachful, sad Alludes particularly to the portrait of her in the Sciarra collection at Rome, where the look of mournful reproach in those full, shadowy eyes, as if she had been unjustly accused of something wrong, is exquisite.,— Unwonted look from brow so glad;— And telling of a pain too deep For tongue to speak or eyes to weep. Sometimes, through allegory's veil, In double semblance seen to shine, Telling a strange and mystic tale Of Love Profane and Love Divine The fine picture in the Palazzo Borghese, called (it is not easy to say why) “Sacred and Profane Love,” in which the two figures, sitting on the edge of the fountain, are evidently portraits of the same person.— Akin in features, but in heart As far as earth and heav'n apart. Or else (by quaint device to prove The frailty of all worldly love) Holding a globe of glass, as thin As air-blown bubbles, in her hand, With a young Love confin'd therein, Whose wings seem waiting to expand— And telling, by her anxious eyes, That, if that frail orb breaks, he flies! This fanciful allegory is the subject of a picture by Titian in the possession of the Marquis Cambian at Turin, whose collection, though small, contains some beautiful specimens of all the great masters. Thou, too, with touch magnificent, Paul of Verona!—where are they, The oriental forms As Paul Veronese gave but little into the beau ideal, his women may be regarded as pretty close imitations of the living models which Venice afforded in his time., that lent Thy canvass such a bright array? Noble and gorgeous dames, whose dress Seems part of their own loveliness; Like the sun's drapery, which, at eve, The floating clouds around him weave Of light they from himself receive! Where is there now the living face Like those that, in thy nuptial throng The Marriage of Cana., By their superb, voluptuous grace, Make us forget the time, the place, The holy guests they smile among,— Till, in that feast of heaven-sent wine, We see no miracles but thine. If e'er, except in Painting's dream, There bloom'd such beauty here, 'tis gone,— Gone, like the face that in the stream Of Ocean for an instant shone, When Venus at that mirror gave A last look, ere she left the wave. And though, among the crowded ways, We oft are startled by the blaze Of eyes that pass, with fitful light, Like fire-flies on the wing at night “Certain it is (as Arthur Young truly and feelingly says) one now and then meets with terrible eyes in Italy.”, 'Tis not that nobler beauty, given To show how angels look in heaven. Ev'n in its shape most pure and fair, 'Tis Beauty, with but half her zone,— All that can warm the Sense is there, But the Soul's deeper charm is flown:— 'Tis Raphael's Fornarina,—warm, Luxuriant, arch, but unrefin'd; A flower, round which the noontide swarm Of young Desires may buzz and wind, But where true Love no treasure meets, Worth hoarding in his hive of sweets. Ah no,—for this, and for the hue Upon the rounded cheek, which tells How fresh, within the heart, this dew Of Love's unrifled sweetness dwells, We must go back to our own Isles, Where Modesty, which here but gives A rare and transient grace to smiles, In the heart's holy centre lives; And thence, as from her throne diffuses O'er thoughts and looks so bland a reign, That not a thought or feeling loses Its freshness in that gentle chain.

Nec mihi displiceant quæ sunt tibi grata; sed ipsa est, Te sine, lux oculis pene inimica meis.

Of every fair and brilliant throng; No wit, like thine, to wake the jest, No voice like thine, to breathe the song. And none could guess, so gay thou art, That thou and I are far apart. Alas, alas, how different flows, With thee and me the time away. Not that I wish thee sad, heaven knows— Still, if thou canst, be light and gay; I only know that without thee The sun himself is dark for me. Do I put on the jewels rare Thou'st always lov'd to see me wear? Do I perfume the locks that thou So oft hast braided o'er my brow, Thus deck'd, through festive crowds to run, And all th' assembled world to see,— All but the one, the absent one, Worth more than present worlds to me! No, nothing cheers this widow'd heart— My only joy, from thee apart, From thee thyself, is sitting hours And days, before thy pictur'd form— That dream of thee, which Raphael's powers Have made with all but life-breath warm! And as I smile to it, and say The words I speak to thee in play, I fancy from their silent frame, Those eyes and lips give back the same; And still I gaze, and still they keep Smiling thus on me—till I weep! Our little boy, too, knows it well, For there I lead him every day, And teach his lisping lips to tell The name of one that's far away. Forgive me, love, but thus alone My time is cheer'd, while thou art gone. EXTRACT XI. Florence. No—'tis not the region where Love's to be found— They have bosoms that sigh, they have glances that rove, They have language a Sappho's own lip might resound, When she warbled her best—but they've nothing like Love. Nor is't that pure sentiment only they want, Which Heav'n for the mild and the tranquil hath made— Calm, wedded affection, that home-rooted plant, Which sweetens seclusion, and smiles in the shade; That feeling, which, after long years have gone by, Remains, like a portrait we've sat for in youth, Where, ev'n though the flush of the colours may fly, The features still live, in their first smiling truth; That union, where all that in Woman is kind, With all that in Man most ennoblingly towers, Grow wreath'd into one—like the column, combin'd Of the strength of the shaft and the capital's flowers. Of this—bear ye witness, ye wives, every where, By the Arno, the Po, by all Italy's streams— Of this heart-wedded love, so delicious to share, Not a husband hath even one glimpse in his dreams. But it is not this, only;—born full of the light Of a sun, from whose fount the luxuriant festoons Of these beautiful valleys drink lustre so bright, That, beside him, our suns of the north are but moons,— We might fancy, at least, like their climate they burn'd; And that Love, though unus'd, in this region of spring, To be thus to a tame Household Deity turn'd, Would yet be all soul, when abroad on the wing. And there may be, there are those explosions of heart, Which burst, when the senses have first caught the flame; Such fits of the blood as those climates impart, Where Love is a sun-stroke, that maddens the frame. But that Passion, which springs in the depth of the soul; Whose beginnings are virginly pure as the source Of some small mountain rivulet, destin'd to roll As a torrent, ere long, losing peace in its course— A course, to which Modesty's struggle but lends A more headlong descent, without chance of recall; But which Modesty ev'n to the last edge attends, And, then, throws a halo of tears round its fall! This exquisite Passion—ay, exquisite, even Mid the ruin its madness too often hath made, As it keeps, even then, a bright trace of the heaven, That heaven of Virtue from which it has stray'd— This entireness of love, which can only be found, Where Woman, like something that's holy, watch'd over, And fenc'd, from her childhood, with purity round, Comes, body and soul, fresh as Spring, to a lover! Where not an eye answers, where not a hand presses, Till spirit with spirit in sympathy move; And the Senses, asleep in their sacred recesses, Can only be reach'd through the temple of Love!— This perfection of Passion—how can it be found, Where the mystery nature hath hung round the tie By which souls are together attracted and bound, Is laid open, for ever, to heart, ear, and eye;— Where nought of that innocent doubt can exist, That ignorance, even than knowledge more bright, Which circles the young, like the morn's sunny mist, And curtains them round in their own native light;— Where Experience leaves nothing for Love to reveal, Or for Fancy, in visions, to gleam o'er the thought; But the truths which, alone, we would die to conceal From the maiden's young heart, are the only ones taught. No, no, 'tis not here, howsoever we sigh, Whether purely to Hymen's one planet we pray, Or adore, like Sabæans, each light of Love's sky, Here is not the region, to fix or to stray. For faithless in wedlock, in gallantry gross, Without honour to guard, or reserve to restrain, What have they, a husband can mourn as a loss? What have they, a lover can prize as a gain? EXTRACT XII.

If it be true that Music reigns, Supreme, in Italy's soft shades, 'Tis like that Harmony, so famous, Among the spheres, which, He of Samos Declar'd, had such transcendent merit, That not a soul on earth could hear it; For, far as I have come—from Lakes, Whose sleep the Tramontana breaks, Through Milan, and that land, which gave The Hero of the rainbow vest Bergamo—the birth-place, it is said, of Harlequin.— By Mincio's banks, and by that wave The Lago di Garda., Which made Verona's bard so blest— Places, that (like the Attic shore, Which rung back music, when the sea Struck on its marge) should be, all o'er, Thrilling alive with melody— I've heard no music—not a note Of such sweet native airs as float, In my own land, among the throng, And speak our nation's soul for song. Nay, ev'n in higher walks, where Art Performs, as 'twere, the gardener's part, And richer, if not sweeter, makes The flow'rs she from the wild-hedge takes— Ev'n there, no voice hath charm'd my ear, No taste hath won my perfect praise, Like thine, dear friend Edward Tuite Dalton, the first husband of Sir John Stevenson's daughter, the late Marchioness of Headfort.—long, truly dear— Thine, and thy lov'd Olivia's lays. She, always beautiful, and growing Still more so every note she sings— Like an inspir'd young Sibyl Such as those of Domenichino in the Palazzo Borghese at the Capitol, &amp;c., glowing With her own bright imaginings! And thou, most worthy to be tied In music to her, as in love, Breathing that language by her side, All other language far above, Eloquent Song—whose tones and words In every heart find answering chords! How happy once the hours we past, Singing or listening all day long, Till Time itself seem'd chang'd, at last, To music, and we liv'd in song! Turning the leaves of Haydn o'er, As quick, beneath her master hand, They open'd all their brilliant store, Like chambers, touch'd by fairy wand; Or o'er the page of Mozart bending, Now by his airy warblings cheer'd, Now in his mournful Requiem blending Voices, through which the heart was heard. And still, to lead our evening choir, Was He invok'd, thy lov'd-one's Sire Sir John Stevenson.— He, who, if aught of grace there be In the wild notes I write or sing, First smooth'd their links of harmony, And lent them charms they did not bring;— He, of the gentlest, simplest heart, With whom, employ'd in his sweet art, (That art, which gives this world of ours A notion how they speak in heaven,) I've pass'd more bright and charmed hours Than all earth's wisdom could have given. Oh happy days, oh early friends, How Life, since then, hath lost its flowers! But yet—though Time some foliage rends, The stem, the Friendship, still is ours; And long may it endure, as green, And fresh as it hath always been! How I have wander'd from my theme! But where is he, that could return To such cold subjects from a dream, Through which these best of feelings burn?— Not all the works of Science, Art, Or Genius in this world are worth One genuine sigh, that from the heart Friendship or Love draws freshly forth. EXTRACT XIII. Rome. Reflections on reading De Cerceau's Account of the Conspiracy of Rienzi, in 1347. The “Conjuration de Nicolas Gabrini, dit de Rienzi,” by the Jesuit De Cerceau, is chiefly taken from the much more authentic work of Fortifiocca on the same subject. Rienzi was the son of a laundress.—The Meeting of the Conspirators on the Night of the 19th of May.—Their Procession in the Morning to the Capitol.—Rienzi's Speech. 'Twas a proud moment—ev'n to hear the words Of Truth and Freedom 'mid these temples breath'd, And see, once more, the Forum shine with swords, In the Republic's sacred name unsheath'd— That glimpse, that vision of a brighter day For his dear Rome, must to a Roman be, Short as it was, worth ages past away In the dull lapse of hopeless slavery. 'Twas on a night of May, beneath that moon, Which had, through many an age, seen Time untune The strings of this Great Empire, till it fell From his rude hands, a broken, silent shell— The sound of the church clock It is not easy to discover what church is meant by Du Cerceau here:—“Il fit crier dans les rues de Rome, à son de trompe, que chacun eût à se trouver, sans armes, la nuit du lendemain, dix neuvième, dans l'église du château de Saint-Ange, au son de la cloche, afin de pourvoir au Bon E'tat.”, near Adrian's Tomb, Summon'd the warriors, who had risen for Rome, To meet unarm'd,—with none to watch them there, But God's own eye,—and pass the night in prayer. Holy beginning of a holy cause, When heroes, girt for Freedom's combat, pause Before high Heav'n, and, humble in their might, Call down its blessing on that coming fight. At dawn, in arms, went forth the patriot band; And, as the breeze, fresh from the Tiber, fann'd Their gilded gonfalons, all eyes could see The palm-tree there, the sword, the keys of Heaven “Les gentilshommes conjurés portaient devant lui trois étendarts. Nicolas Guallato, surnommé le bon diseur, portait le premier; qui était de couleur rouge, et plus grand que les autres. On y voyait des caractères d'or avec une femme assise sur deux lions, tenant d'une main le globe du monde, et de l'autre une Palme pour représenter la ville de Rome. C'était le Gonfalon de la Liberté. Le second, à fonds blanc, avec un St. Paul tenant de la droite une Epée nue et de la gauche la couronne de Justice, était porté par Etienne Magnacuccia, notaire apostolique. Dans le troisième, St. Pierre avait en main les clefs de la Concorde et de la Paix. Tout cela insinuait le dessein de Rienzi, qui était de rétablir la liberté la justice et la paix.” —Du Cerceau, liv. ii.— Types of the justice, peace, and liberty, That were to bless them, when their chains were riven. On to the Capitol the pageant mov'd, While many a Shade of other times, that still Around that grave of grandeur sighing rov'd, Hung o'er their footsteps up the Sacred Hill, And heard its mournful echoes, as the last High-minded heirs of the Republic pass'd. 'Twas then that thou, their Tribune Rienzi., (name, which brought Dreams of lost glory to each patriot's thought,) Didst, with a spirit Rome in vain shall seek To wake up in her sons again, thus speak:— “Romans, look round you—on this sacred place “There once stood shrines, and gods, and godlike men. “What see you now? what solitary trace “Is left of all, that made Rome's glory then? “The shrines are sunk, the Sacred Mount bereft “Ev'n of its name—and nothing now remains “But the deep memory of that glory, left “To whet our pangs and aggravate our chains! “But shall this be?—our sun and sky the same,— “Treading the very soil our fathers trode,— “What withering curse hath fall'n on soul and frame, “What visitation hath there come from God, “To blast our strength, and rot us into slaves, “Here, on our great forefathers' glorious graves? “It cannot be—rise up, ye Mighty Dead,— “If we, the living, are too weak to crush “These tyrant priests, that o'er your empire tread, “Till all but Romans at Rome's tameness blush! “Happy, Palmyra, in thy desert domes, “Where only date-trees sigh and serpents hiss; “And thou, whose pillars are but silent homes “For the stork's brood, superb Persepolis! “Thrice happy both, that your extinguish'd race “Have left no embers—no half-living trace— “No slaves, to crawl around the once proud spot, “Till past renown in present shame's forgot. “While Rome, the Queen of all, whose very wrecks, “If lone and lifeless through a desert hurl'd, “Would wear more true magnificence than decks “The' assembled thrones of all the' existing world— “Rome, Rome alone, is haunted, stain'd and curst, “Through every spot her princely Tiber laves, “By living human things—the deadliest, worst, “This earth engenders—tyrants and their slaves! “And we—oh shame!—we, who have ponder'd o'er “The patriot's lesson and the poet's lay The fine Canzone of Petrarch, beginning “Spirto gentil,” is supposed, by Voltaire and others, to have been addressed to Rienzi; but there is much more evidence of its having been written, as Ginguené asserts, to the young Stephen Colonna, on his being created a Senator of Rome. That Petrarch, however, was filled with high and patriotic hopes by the first measures of this extraordinary man, appears from one of his letters, quoted by Du Cerceau, where he says,—“Pour tout dire, en un mot, j'atteste, non comme lecteur, mais comme témoin oculaire, qu'il nous a ramené le justice, la paix, la bonne foi, la sécurité, et tous les autres vestiges de l'âge d'or.”; “Have mounted up the streams of ancient lore, “Tracking our country's glories all the way— “Ev'n we have tamely, basely kiss'd the ground “Before that Papal Power,—that Ghost of Her, “The World's Imperial Mistress—sitting, crown'd “And ghastly, on her mouldering sepulchre! This image is borrowed from Hobbes, whose words are, as near as I can recollect:—“For what is the Papacy, but the Ghost of the old Roman Empire, sitting crowned on the grave thereof?” “But this is past:—too long have lordly priests “And priestly lords led us, with all our pride “Withering about us—like devoted beasts, “Dragg'd to the shrine, with faded garlands tied. “'Tis o'er—the dawn of our deliverance breaks! “Up from his sleep of centuries awakes “The Genius of the Old Republic, free “As first he stood, in chainless majesty, “And sends his voice through ages yet to come, “Proclaiming Rome, Rome, Rome, Eternal Rome!” EXTRACT XIV.

Fill'd with the wonders I had seen, In Rome's stupendous shrines and halls, I felt the veil of sleep, serene, Come o'er the memory of each scene, As twilight o'er the landscape falls. Nor was it slumber, sound and deep, But such as suits a poet's rest— That sort of thin, transparent sleep, Through which his day-dreams shine the best. Methought upon a plain I stood, Where certain wondrous men, 'twas said, With strange, miraculous power endu'd, Were coming, each in turn, to shed His arts' illusions o'er the sight, And call up miracles of light. The sky above this lonely place, Was of that cold, uncertain hue, The canvass wears, ere, warm'd apace, Its bright creation dawns to view. But soon a glimmer from the east Proclaim'd the first enchantments nigh The paintings of those artists who were introduced into Venice and Florence from Greece.; And as the feeble light increas'd, Strange figures mov'd across the sky, With golden glories deck'd, and streaks Of gold among their garments' dyes Margaritone of Orezzo, who was a pupil and imitator of the Greeks, is said to have invented this art of gilding the ornaments of pictures, a practice which, though it gave way to a purer taste at the beginning of the 16th century, was still occasionally used by many of the great masters: as by Raphael in the ornaments of the Fornarina, and by Rubens not unfrequently in glories and flames.; And life's resemblance ting'd their cheeks, But nought of life was in their eyes;— Like the fresh-painted Dead one meets, Borne slow along Rome's mournful streets. But soon these figures pass'd away; And forms succeeded to their place, With less of gold, in their array, But shining with more natural grace, And all could see the charming wands Had pass'd into more gifted hands. Cimabue, Giotto, &amp;c. Among these visions there was one The works of Masaccio.—For the character of this powerful and original genius, see Sir Joshua Reynolds's twelfth discourse. His celebrated frescos are in the church of St. Pietro del Carmine, at Florence., Surpassing fair, on which the sun, That instant risen, a beam let fall, Which through the dusky twilight trembled, And reach'd at length, the spot where all Those great magicians stood assembled. And as they turn'd their heads, to view The shining lustre, I could trace The bright varieties it threw On each uplifted studying face All the great artists studied, and many of them borrowed from Masaccio. Several figures in the Cartoons of Raphael are taken, with but little alteration, from his frescos.; While many a voice with loud acclaim, Call'd forth, “Masaccio” as the name Of him, the' Enchanter, who had rais'd This miracle, on which all gaz'd. 'Twas daylight now—the sun had risen, From out the dungeon of old Night,— Like the Apostle, from his prison Led by the Angel's hand of light; And—as the fetters, when that ray Of glory reach'd them, dropp'd away “And a light shined in the prison ? and his chains fell off from his hands.” Acts., So fled the clouds at touch of day! Just then, a bearded sage Leonardo da Vinci. came forth, Who oft in thoughtful dream would stand, To trace upon the dusky earth Strange learned figures with his wand His treatise on Mechanics, Optics, &amp;c. preserved in the Ambrosian library at Milan.; And oft he took the silver lute On dit que Léonard parut pour la première fois à la cour de Milan, dans un espèce de concours ouvert entre les meilleurs joueurs de lyre d'Italie. Il se présenta avec une lyre de sa facon, construit en argent. —Histoire de la Peinture en Italie. His little page behind him bore, And wak'd such music as, when mute, Left in the soul a thirst for more! Meanwhile, his potent spells went on, And forms and faces, that from out A depth of shadow mildly shone, Were in the soft air seen about. Though thick as midnight stars they beam'd, Yet all like living sisters seem'd, So close, in every point, resembling Each other's beauties—from the eyes Lucid as if through crystal trembling, Yet soft as if suffused with sighs, To the long, fawn-like mouth, and chin, Lovelily tapering, less and less, Till, by this very charm's excess, Like virtue on the verge of sin, It touch'd the bounds of ugliness. Here look'd as when they liv'd the shades Of some of Arno's dark-ey'd maids— Such maids as should alone live on, In dreams thus, when their charms are gone: Some Mona Lisa, on whose eyes A painter for whole years might gaze He is said to have been four years employed upon the portrait of this fair Florentine, without being able, after all, to come up to his idea of her beauty., Nor find in all his pallet's dyes, One that could even approach their blaze! Here float two spirit shapes Vanity and Modesty in the collection of Cardinal Fesch, at Rome. The composition of the four hands here is rather awkward, but the picture, altogether, is very delightful. There is a repetition of the subject in the possession of Lucien Bonaparte., the one, With her white fingers to the sun Outspread, as if to ask his ray Whether it e'er had chanc'd to play On lilies half so fair as they! This self-pleas'd nymph, was Vanity— And by her side another smil'd, In form as beautiful as she, But with that air, subdu'd and mild, That still reserve of purity, Which is to beauty like the haze Of evening to some sunny view, Softening such charms as it displays, And veiling others in that hue, Which fancy only can see through! This phantom nymph, who could she be, But the bright Spirit, Modesty? Long did the learn'd enchanter stay To weave his spells, and still there pass'd, As in the lantern's shifting play, Group after group in close array, Each fairer, grander, than the last. But the great triumph of his power Was yet to come:—gradual and slow, (As all that is ordain'd to tower Among the works of man must grow,) The sacred vision stole to view, In that half light, half shadow shown, Which gives to ev'n the gayest hue, A sober'd, melancholy tone. It was a vision of that last The Last Supper of Leonardo da Vinci, which is in the Refectory of the Convent delle Grazie at Milan. See L'Histoire de la Peinture in Italie, liv. iii. chap. 45. The writer of that interesting work (to whom I take this opportunity of offering my acknowledgments, for the copy he sent me a year since from Rome,) will see I have profited by some of his observations on this celebrated picture., Sorrowful night which Jesus pass'd With his disciples when he said Mournfully to them—“I shall be “Betray'd by one, who here hath fed “This night at the same board with me.” And though the Saviour, in the dream Spoke not these words, we saw them beam Legibly in his eyes (so well The great magician work'd his spell), And read in every thoughtful line Imprinted on that brow divine, The meek, the tender nature, griev'd, Not anger'd, to be thus deceiv'd— Celestial love requited ill For all its care, yet loving still— Deep, deep regret that there should fall From man's deceit so foul a blight Upon that parting hour—and all His Spirit must have felt that night, Who, soon to die for human-kind, Thought only, 'mid his mortal pain, How many a soul was left behind For whom he died that death in vain! Such was the heavenly scene—alas That scene so bright so soon should pass! But pictur'd on the humid air, Its tints, ere long, grew languid there Leonardo appears to have used a mixture of oil and varnish for this picture, which alone, without the various other causes of its ruin, would have prevented any long duration of its beauties. It is now almost entirely effaced.; And storms came on, that, cold and rough, Scatter'd its gentlest glories all— As when the baffling winds blow off The hues that hang o'er Terni's fall,— Till, one by one, the vision's beams Faded away, and soon it fled, To join those other vanish'd dreams That now flit palely 'mong the dead,— The shadows of those shades, that go, Around Oblivion's lake, below!

No wonder, Mary, that thy story Touches all hearts—for there we see The soul's corruption, and its glory, Its death and life combin'd in thee. From the first moment, when we find Thy spirit haunted by a swarm Of dark desires,—like demons shrin'd Unholily in that fair form,— Till when, by touch of Heav'n set free, Thou cam'st, with those bright locks of gold (So oft the gaze of Bethany), And, covering in their precious fold Thy Saviour's feet, didst shed such tears As paid, each drop, the sins of years!— Thence on, through all thy course of love To Him, thy Heavenly Master,—Him, Whose bitter death-cup from above Had yet this cordial round the brim, That woman's faith and love stood fast And fearless by Him to the last:— Till, oh, blest boon for truth like thine! Thou wert, of all, the chosen one, Before whose eyes that Face Divine, When risen from the dead, first shone; That thou might'st see how, like a cloud, Had pass'd away its mortal shroud, And make that bright revealment known To hearts, less trusting than thy own. All is affecting, cheering, grand; The kindliest record ever given, Ev'n under God's own kindly hand, Of what Repentance wins from Heaven! No wonder, Mary, that thy face, In all its touching light of tears, Should meet us in each holy place, Where Man before his God appears, Hopeless—were he not taught to see All hope in Him, who pardon'd thee! No wonder that the painter's skill Should oft have triumph'd in the power Of keeping thee all lovely still Ev'n in thy sorrow's bitterest hour; That soft Correggio should diffuse His melting shadows round thy form; That Guido's pale, unearthly hues Should, in pourtraying thee, grow warm; That all—from the ideal, grand, Inimitable Roman hand, Down to the small, enamelling touch Of smooth Carlino—should delight In picturing her, who “lov'd so much,” And was, in spite of sin, so bright! But, Mary, 'mong these bold essays Of Genius and of Art to raise A semblance of those weeping eyes— A vision, worthy of the sphere Thy faith has earn'd thee in the skies, And in the hearts of all men here,— None e'er hath match'd, in grief or grace, Canova's day-dream of thy face, In those bright sculptur'd forms, more bright With true expression's breathing light, Than ever yet, beneath the stroke Of chisel, into life awoke. The one This statue is one of the last works of Canova, and was not yet in marble when I left Rome. The other, which seems to prove, in contradiction to very high authority, that expression, of the intensest kind, is fully within the sphere of sculpture, was executed many years ago, and is in the possession of the Count Somariva, at Paris., pourtraying what thou wert In thy first grief,—while yet the flower Of those young beauties was unhurt By sorrow's slow, consuming power; And mingling earth's seductive grace With heav'n's subliming thoughts so well, We doubt, while gazing, in which place Such beauty was most form'd to dwell!— The other, as thou look'dst, when years Of fasting, penitence, and tears Had worn thy frame;—and ne'er did Art With half such speaking power express The ruin which a breaking heart Spreads, by degrees, o'er loveliness. Those wasting arms, that keep the trace, Ev'n still, of all their youthful grace, That loosen'd hair, of which thy brow Was once so proud,—neglected now!— Those features, ev'n in fading worth The freshest bloom to others given, And those sunk eyes, now lost to earth, But, to the last, still full of heaven! Wonderful artist! praise, like mine— Though springing from a soul, that feels Deep worship of those works divine, Where Genius all his light reveals— How weak 'tis to the words that came From him, thy peer in art and fame Chantrey., Whom I have known, by day, by night, Hang o'er thy marble with delight; And, while his lingering hand would steal O'er every grace the taper's rays Canova always shows his fine statue, the Venere Vincitrice by the light of a small candle., Give thee, with all the generous zeal Such master spirits only feel, That best of fame, a rival's praise!

A Visit to the House where Rousseau lived with Madame de Warrens. —Their Ménage.—Its Grossness.—Claude Anet.— Reverence with which the Spot is now visited.—Absurdity of this blind Devotion to Fame.—Feelings excited by the Beauty and Seclusion of the Scene.—Disturbed by its Associations with Rousseau's History.—Impostures of Men of Genius.— Their Power of mimicking all the best Feelings, Love, Independence, &amp;c. Strange power of Genius, that can throw Round all that's vicious, weak, and low, Such magic lights, such rainbow dyes As dazzle ev'n the steadiest eyes. 'Tis worse than weak—'tis wrong, 'tis shame, This mean prostration before Fame; This casting down, beneath the car Of Idols, whatsoe'er they are, Life's purest, holiest decencies, To be career'd o'er, as they please. No—give triumphant Genius all For which his loftiest wish can call: If he be worshipp'd, let it be For attributes, his noblest, first; Not with that base idolatry, Which sanctifies his last and worst. I may be cold;—may want that glow Of high romance, which bards should know; That holy homage, which is felt In treading where the great have dwelt; This reverence, whatsoe'er it be, I fear, I feel, I have it not:— For here, at this still hour, to me The charms of this delightful spot; Its calm seclusion from the throng, From all the heart would fain forget; This narrow valley, and the song Of its small murmuring rivulet; The flitting, to and fro, of birds, Tranquil and tame as they were once In Eden, ere the startling words Of Man disturb'd their orisons; Those little, shadowy paths, that wind Up the hill-side, with fruit-trees lin'd, And lighted only by the breaks The gay wind in the foliage makes, Or vistas, here and there, that ope Through weeping willows, like the snatches Of far-off scenes of light, which Hope Ev'n through the shade of sadness catches!— All this, which—could I once but lose The memory of those vulgar ties, Whose grossness all the heavenliest hues Of Genius can no more disguise, Than the sun's beams can do away The filth of fens o'er which they play— This scene, which would have fill'd my heart With thoughts of all that happiest is;— Of Love, where self hath only part, As echoing back another's bliss; Of solitude, secure and sweet, Beneath whose shade the Virtues meet; Which, while it shelters, never chills Our sympathies with human woe, But keeps them, like sequester'd rills, Purer and fresher in their flow; Of happy days, that share their beams 'Twixt quiet mirth and wise employ; Of tranquil nights, that give, in dreams, The moonlight of the morning's joy!— All this my heart could dwell on here, But for those gross mementos near; Those sullying truths, that cross the track Of each sweet thought, and drive them back Full into all the mire, and strife, And vanities of that man's life, Who, more than all that e'er have glow'd With Fancy's flame (and it was his, In fullest warmth and radiance) show'd What an impostor Genius is; How, with that strong, mimetic art, Which forms its life and soul, it takes All shapes of thought, all hues of heart, Nor feels, itself, one throb it wakes; How like a gem its light may smile O'er the dark path, by mortals trod, Itself as mean a worm, the while, As crawls at midnight o'er the sod; What gentle words and thoughts may fall From its false lip, what zeal to bless, While home, friends, kindred, country, all, Lie waste beneath its selfishness; How, with the pencil hardly dry From colouring up such scenes of love And beauty, as make young hearts sigh, And dream, and think through heav'n they rove, They, who can thus describe and move, The very workers of these charms, Nor seek, nor know a joy, above Some Maman's or Theresa's arms! How all, in short, that makes the boast Of their false tongues, they want the most; And, while with freedom on their lips, Sounding their timbrels, to set free This bright world, labouring in the' eclipse Of priestcraft, and of slavery,— They may, themselves, be slaves as low As ever Lord or Patron made To blossom in his smile, or grow, Like stunted brushwood, in his shade. Out on the craft!—I'd rather be One of those hinds, that round me tread, With just enough of sense to see The noonday sun that's o'er his head, Than thus, with high-built genius curst, That hath no heart for its foundation, Be all, at once, that's brightest, worst, Sublimest, meanest in creation! MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. OCCASIONAL EPILOGUE, SPOKEN BY MR. CORRY, IN THE CHARACTER OF VAPID, AFTER THE PLAY OF THE DRAMATIST, AT THE KILKENNY THEATRE. (Entering as if to announce the Play.) Ladies and Gentlemen, on Monday night, For the ninth time—oh accents of delight To the poor author's ear, when three times three With a full bumper crowns his Comedy! When, long by money, and the muse, forsaken, He finds at length his jokes and boxes taken, And sees his play-bill circulate—alas, The only bill on which his name will pass! Thus, Vapid, thus shall Thespian scrolls of fame Through box and gallery waft your well-known name, While critic eyes the happy cast shall con, And learned ladies spell your Dram. Person. 'Tis said our worthy Manager The late Mr. Richard Power. intends To help my night, and he, you know, has friends. Friends, did I say? for fixing friends, or parts, Engaging actors, or engaging hearts, There's nothing like him! wits, at his request, Are turn'd to fools, and dull dogs learn to jest; Soldiers, for him, good “trembling cowards” make, And beaus, turn'd clowns, look ugly for his sake; For him ev'n lawyers talk without a fee, For him (oh friendship!) I act tragedy! In short, like Orpheus, his persuasive tricks Make boars amusing, and put life in sticks. With such a manager we can't but please, Tho' London sent us all her loud O. P.'s The brief appellation by which those persons were distinguished who, at the opening of the new theatre of Covent Garden, clamoured for the continuance of the old prices of admission., Let them come on, like snakes, all hiss and rattle, Arm'd with a thousand fans, we'd give them battle; You, on our side, R. P. The initials of our manager's name. upon our banners, Soon should we teach the saucy O. P.'s manners: And show that, here—howe'er John Bull may doubt— In all our plays, the Riot-Act's cut out; And, while we skim the cream of many a jest, Your well-timed thunder never sours its zest. Oh gently thus, when three short weeks are past, At Shakspeare's altar This alludes to a scenic representation then preparing for the last night of the performances., shall we breathe our last; And, ere this long-lov'd dome to ruin nods, Die all, die nobly, die like demigods! EXTRACT FROM A PROLOGUE WRITTEN AND SPOKEN BY THE AUTHOR, AT THE OPENING OF THE KILKENNY THEATRE, OCTOBER, 1809. Yet, even here, though Fiction rules the hour, There shine some genuine smiles, beyond her power; And there are tears, too—tears that Memory sheds Ev'n o'er the feast that mimic fancy spreads, When her heart misses one lamented guest The late Mr. John Lyster, one of the oldest members and best actors of the Kilkenny Theatrical Society., Whose eye so long threw light o'er all the rest! There, there, indeed, the Muse forgets her task, And drooping weeps behind Thalia's mask. Forgive this gloom—forgive this joyless strain, Too sad to welcome pleasure's smiling train. But, meeting thus, our hearts will part the lighter, As mist at dawn but makes the setting brighter; Gay Epilogue will shine where Prologue fails— As glow-worms keep their splendour for their tails. I know not why—but time, methinks, hath pass'd More fleet than usual since we parted last. It seems but like a dream of yester-night, Whose charm still hangs, with fond, delaying light; And, ere the memory lose one glowing hue Of former joy, we come to kindle new. Thus ever may the flying moments haste With trackless foot along life's vulgar waste, But deeply print and lingeringly move, When thus they reach the sunny spots we love. Oh yes, whatever be our gay career, Let this be still the solstice of the year, Where Pleasure's sun shall at its height remain, And slowly sink to level life again. THE SYLPH'S BALL. A Sylph, as bright as ever sported Her figure through the fields of air, By an old swathy Gnome was couted, And, strange to say, he won the fair. The annals of the oldest witch A pair so sorted could not show, But how refuse?—the Gnome was rich, The Rothschild of the world below; And Sylphs, like other pretty creatures, Are told, betimes, they must consider Love as an auctioneer of features, Who knocks them down to the best bidder. Home she was taken to his Mine— A Palace, paved with diamonds all— And, proud as Lady Gnome to shine, Sent out her tickets for a Ball. The lower world, of course, was there, And all the best; but of the upper The sprinkling was but shy and rare,— A few old Sylphids, who lov'd supper. As none yet knew the wondrous Lamp Of Davy, that renown'd Aladdin, And the Gnome's Halls exhal'd a damp, Which accidents from fire were bad in; The chambers were supplied with light By many strange but safe devices; Large fire-flies, such as shine at night Among the Orient's flowers and spices;— Musical flint-mills—swiftly play'd By elfin hands—that, flashing round, Like certain fire-eyed minstrel maids, Gave out, at once, both light and sound. Bologna stones, that drink the sun; And water from that Indian sea, Whose waves at night like wild-fire run— Cork'd up in crystal carefully. Glow-worms, that round the tiny dishes, Like little light-houses, were set up; And pretty phosphorescent fishes, That by their own gay light were eat up. 'Mong the few guests from Ether, came That wicked Sylph, whom Love we call— My Lady knew him but by name, My Lord, her husband not at all. Some prudent Gnomes, 'tis said, appriz'd That he was coming, and, no doubt, Alarm'd about his torch, advis'd He should, by all means, be kept out. But others disapprov'd this plan, And, by his flame though somewhat frighted, Thought Love too much a gentleman, In such a dangerous place to light it. However, there he was—and dancing With the fair Sylph, light as a feather; They look'd like two fresh sunbeams, glancing, At daybreak, down to earth together. And all had gone off safe and well, But for that plaguy torch, whose light, Though not yet kindled—who could tell How soon, how devilishly, it might? And so it chanced—which, in those dark And fireless halls was quite amazing; Did we not know how small a spark Can set the torch of Love a-blazing. Whether it came (when close entangled In the gay waltz) from her bright eyes, Or from the lucciole, that spangled Her locks of jet—is all surmise; But certain 'tis the' ethereal girl Did drop a spark, at some odd turning, Which, by the waltz's windy whirl Was fann'd up into actual burning. Oh for that Lamp's metallic gauze, That curtain of protecting wire, Which Davy delicately draws Around illicit, dangerous fire!— The wall he sets 'twixt Flame and Air, (Like that, which barr'd young Thisbe's bliss,) Through whose small holes this dangerous pair May see each other, but not kiss. ? Partique dedêre Oscula quisque suæ, non pervenientia contrà. Ovid. At first the torch look'd rather bluely,— A sign, they say, that no good boded— Then quick the gas became unruly, And, crack! the ball-room all exploded. Sylphs, gnomes, and fiddlers mix'd together, With all their aunts, sons, cousins, nieces, Like butterflies in stormy weather, Were blown—legs, wings, and tails—to pieces! While, 'mid these victims of the torch, The Sylph, alas, too, bore her part— Found lying, with a livid scorch As if from lightning, o'er her heart! “Well done”—a laughing Goblin said— Escaping from this gaseous strife— “'Tis not the first time Love has made “A blow-up in connubial life!” REMONSTRANCE. After a Conversation with Lord John Russell, in which he had intimated some Idea of giving up all political Pursuits. What! thou, with thy genius, thy youth, and thy name— Thou, born of a Russell—whose instinct to run The accustom'd career of thy sires, is the same As the eaglet's, to soar with his eyes on the sun! Whose nobility comes to thee, stamp'd with a seal, Far, far more ennobling than monarch e'er set; With the blood of thy race, offer'd up for the weal Of a nation, that swears by that martyrdom yet! Shalt thou be faint-hearted and turn from the strife, From the mighty arena, where all that is grand, And devoted, and pure, and adorning in life, 'Tis for high-thoughted spirits like thine to command? Oh no, never dream it—while good men despair Between tyrants and traitors, and timid men bow, Never think, for an instant, thy country can spare Such a light from her darkening horizon as thou. With a spirit, as meek as the gentlest of those Who in life's sunny valley lie shelter'd and warm; Yet bold and heroic as ever yet rose To the top cliffs of Fortune, and breasted her storm; With an ardour for liberty, fresh as, in youth, It first kindles the bard and gives life to his lyre; Yet mellow'd, ev'n now, by that mildness of truth, Which tempers, but chills not, the patriot fire; With an eloquence—not like those rills from a height, Which sparkle, and foam, and in vapour are o'er; But a current, that works out its way into light Through the filtering recesses of thought and of lore. Thus gifted, thou never canst sleep in the shade; If the stirrings of Genius, the music of fame, And the charms of thy cause have not power to persuade, Yet think how to Freedom thou'rt pledg'd by thy Name. Like the boughs of that laurel, by Delphi's decree, Set apart for the Fane and its service divine, So the branches, that spring from the old Russell tree, Are by Liberty claim'd for the use of her Shrine. MY BIRTH-DAY. “My birth-day”—what a different sound That word had in my youthful ears! And how, each time the day comes round, Less and less white its mark appears! When first our scanty years are told, It seems like pastime to grow old; And, as Youth counts the shining links, That Time around him binds so fast, Pleased with the task, he little thinks How hard that chain will press at last. Vain was the man, and false as vain, Who said Fontenelle.—“Si je recommençais ma carrière, je ferai tout ce que j'ai fait.”—“were he ordain'd to run “His long career of life again, “He would do all that he had done.”— Ah, 'tis not thus the voice, that dwells In sober birth-days, speaks to me; Far otherwise—of time it tells, Lavish'd unwisely, carelessly; Of counsel mock'd; of talents, made Haply for high and pure designs, But oft, like Israel's incense, laid Upon unholy, earthly shrines; Of nursing many a wrong desire; Of wandering after Love too far, And taking every meteor fire, That cross'd my pathway, for his star.— All this it tells, and, could I trace The' imperfect picture o'er again, With pow'r to add, retouch, efface The lights and shades, the joy and pain, How little of the past would stay! How quickly all should melt away— All—but that Freedom of the Mind, Which hath been more than wealth to me; Those friendships, in my boyhood twin'd, And kept till now unchangingly; And that dear home, that saving ark, Where Love's true light at last I've found, Cheering within, when all grows dark, And comfortless, and stormy round! FANCY. The more I've view'd this world, the more I've found, That, fill'd as 'tis with scenes and creatures rare, Fancy commands, within her own bright round, A world of scenes and creatures far more fair. Nor is it that her power can call up there A single charm, that's not from Nature won,— No more than rainbows, in their pride, can wear A single tint unborrow'd from the sun; But 'tis the mental medium it shines through, That lends to Beauty all its charm and hue; As the same light, that o'er the level lake One dull monotony of lustre flings, Will, entering in the rounded rain-drop, make Colours as gay as those on angels' wings! FANNY, DEAREST! SONG. Yes! had I leisure to sigh and mourn, Fanny dearest, for thee I'd sigh; And every smile on my cheek should turn To tears when thou art nigh. But, between love, and wine, and sleep, So busy a life I live, That even the time it would take to weep Is more than my heart can give. Then wish me not to despair and pine, Fanny, dearest of all the dears! The Love that's order'd to bathe in wine, Would be sure to take cold in tears. Reflected bright in this heart of mine, Fanny dearest, thy image lies; But, ah! the mirror would cease to shine, If dimm'd too often with sighs. They lose the half of beauty's light, Who view it through sorrow's tear; And 'tis but to see thee truly bright That I keep my eye-beams clear. Then wait no longer till tears shall flow— Fanny, dearest! the hope is vain; If sunshine cannot dissolve thy snow, I shall never attempt it with rain. TRANSLATIONS FROM CATULLUS. Carm. 70. TO LESBIA. Dicebas quondam, &amp;c. Thou told'st me, in our days of love, That I had all that heart of thine; That, ev'n to share the couch of Jove, Thou would'st not, Lesbia, part from mine. How purely wert thou worshipp'd then! Not with the vague and vulgar fires Which Beauty wakes in soulless men,— But lov'd, as children by their sires. That flattering dream, alas, is o'er;— I know thee now—and though these eyes Doat on thee wildly as before, Yet, even in doating, I despise. Yes, sorceress—mad as it may seem— With all thy craft, such spells adorn thee, That passion even outlives esteem, And I, at once, adore—and scorn thee. Carm. 11. Pauca nunciate meæ puellæ. Comrades and friends! with whom, where'er The fates have will'd through life I've rov'd, Now speed ye home, and with you bear These bitter words to her I've lov'd. Tell her from fool to fool to run, Where'er her vain caprice may call; Of all her dupes not loving one, But ruining and maddening all. Bid her forget—what now is past— Our once dear love, whose ruin lies Like a fair flower, the meadow's last, Which feels the ploughshare's edge, and dies! Carm. 29. Peninsularum Sirmio, insularumque Ocelle. Sweet Sirmio! thou, the very eye Of all peninsulas and isles, That in our lakes of silver lie, Or sleep, enwreath'd by Neptune's smiles— How gladly back to thee I fly! Still doubting, asking—can it be That I have left Bithynia's sky, And gaze in safety upon thee? Oh! what is happier than to find Our hearts at ease, our perils past; When, anxious long, the lighten'd mind Lays down its load of care at last: When, tired with toil o'er land and deep, Again we tread the welcome floor Of our own home, and sink to sleep On the long-wish'd-for bed once more. Desideratoque acquiescimus lecto. This, this it is, that pays alone The ills of all life's former track.— Shine out, my beautiful, my own Sweet Sirmio, greet thy master back. And thou, fair Lake, whose water quaffs The light of heav'n like Lydia's sea, Rejoice, rejoice—let all that laughs Abroad, at home, laugh out for me! TIBULLUS TO SULPICIA. Nulla tuum nobis subducet femina lectum, &amp;c. &amp;c. Lib. iv. Carm. 13. “Never shall woman's smile have power “To win me from those gentle charms!”— Thus swore I, in that happy hour, When Love first gave thee to my arms. And still alone thou charm'st my sight— Still, though our city proudly shine With forms and faces, fair and bright, I see none fair or bright but thine. Would thou wert fair for only me, And could'st no heart but mine allure!— To all men else unpleasing be, So shall I feel my prize secure. Displiceas aliis, sic ego tutus ero. Oh, love like mine ne'er wants the zest Of others' envy, others' praise; But, in its silence safely blest, Broods o'er a bliss it ne'er betrays. Charm of my life! by whose sweet power All cares are hush'd, all ills subdued— My light, in even the darkest hour, My crowd, in deepest solitude! Tu mihi curarum requies, tu nocte vel atrâ Lumen, et in solis tu mihi turba locis. No, not though heaven itself sent down Some maid, of more than heavenly charms, With bliss undreamt thy bard to crown, Would he for her forsake those arms! IMITATION FROM THE FRENCH. With women and apples both Paris and Adam Made mischief enough in their day:— God be prais'd that the fate of mankind, my dear Madam, Depends not on us, the same way. For, weak as I am with temptation to grapple, The world would have doubly to rue thee; Like Adam, I'd gladly take from thee the apple, Like Paris, at once give it to thee. INVITATION TO DINNER, ADDRESSED TO LORD LANSDOWNE. September, 1818. Some think we bards have nothing real; That poets live among the stars so, Their very dinners are ideal,— (And, heaven knows, too oft they are so,)— For instance, that we have, instead Of vulgar chops, and stews, and hashes, First course—a Phœnix, at the head, Done in its own celestial ashes; At foot, a cygnet, which kept singing All the time its neck was wringing. Side dishes, thus—Minerva's owl, Or any such like learned fowl: Doves, such as heav'n's poulterer gets, When Cupid shoots his mother's pets. Larks, stew'd in Morning's roseate breath, Or roasted by a sunbeam's splendour; And nightingales, berhymed to death— Like young pigs whipp'd to make them tender. Such fare may suit those bards, who're able To banquet at Duke Humphrey's table; But as for me, who've long been taught To eat and drink like other people; And can put up with mutton, bought Where Bromham A picturesque village in sight of my cottage, and from which it is separated but by a small verdant valley. rears its ancient steeple— If Lansdowne will consent to share My humble feast, though rude the fare, Yet, season'd by that salt he brings From Attica's salinest springs, 'Twill turn to dainties;—while the cup, Beneath his influence brightening up, Like that of Baucis, touch'd by Jove, Will sparkle fit for gods above! VERSES TO THE POET CRABBE'S INKSTAND. Soon after Mr. Crabbe's death, the sons of that gentleman did me the honour of presenting to me the inkstand, pencil, &amp;c. which their distinguished father had long been in the habit of using. WRITTEN MAY, 1832. All, as he left it!—even the pen, So lately at that mind's command, Carelessly lying, as if then Just fallen from his gifted hand. Have we then lost him? scarce an hour, A little hour, seems to have past, Since Life and Inspiration's power Around that relic breath'd their last. Ah, powerless now—like talisman, Found in some vanish'd wizard's halls, Whose mighty charm with him began, Whose charm with him extinguish'd falls. Yet though, alas! the gifts that shone Around that pen's exploring track, Be now, with its great master, gone, Nor living hand can call them back; Who does not feel, while thus his eyes Rest on the enchanter's broken wand, Each earth-born spell it work'd arise Before him in succession grand?— Grand, from the Truth that reigns o'er all; The unshrinking Truth, that lets her light Through Life's low, dark, interior fall, Opening the whole, severely bright: Yet softening, as she frowns along, O'er scenes which angels weep to see— Where Truth herself half veils the Wrong, In pity of the Misery. True bard!—and simple, as the race Of true-born poets ever are, When, stooping from their starry place, They're children, near, though gods, afar. How freshly doth my mind recall, 'Mong the few days I've known with thee, One that, most buoyantly of all, Floats in the wake of memory The lines that follow allude to a day passed in company with Mr. Crabbe, many years since, when a party, consisting only of Mr. Rogers, Mr. Crabbe, and the author of these verses, had the pleasure of dining with Mr. Thomas Campbell, at his house at Sydenham.; When he, the poet, doubly graced, In life, as in his perfect strain, With that pure, mellowing power of Taste, Without which Fancy shines in vain; Who in his page will leave behind, Pregnant with genius though it be, But half the treasures of a mind, Where Sense o'er all holds mastery:— Friend of long years! of friendship tried Through many a bright and dark event; In doubts, my judge—in taste, my guide— In all, my stay and ornament! He, too, was of our feast that day, And all were guests of one, whose hand Hath shed a new and deathless ray Around the lyre of this great land; In whose sea-odes—as in those shells Where Ocean's voice of majesty Seems still to sound—immortal dwells Old Albion's Spirit of the Sea. Such was our host; and though, since then, Slight clouds have ris'n twixt him and me, Who would not grasp such hand again, Stretch'd forth again in amity? Who can, in this short life, afford To let such mists a moment stay, When thus one frank, atoning word, Like sunshine, melts them all away? Bright was our board that day—though one Unworthy brother there had place; As 'mong the horses of the Sun, One was, they say, of earthly race. Yet, next to Genius is the power Of feeling where true Genius lies; And there was light around that hour Such as, in memory, never dies; Light which comes o'er me, as I gaze, Thou Relic of the Dead, on thee, Like all such dreams of vanish'd days, Brightly, indeed—but mournfully! TO CAROLINE, VISCOUNTESS VALLETORT. WRITTEN AT LACOCK ABBEY, JANUARY, 1832. When I would sing thy beauty's light, Such various forms, and all so bright, I've seen thee, from thy childhood, wear, I know not which to call most fair, Nor 'mong the countless charms that spring For ever round thee, which to sing. When I would paint thee, as thou art, Then all thou wert comes o'er my heart— The graceful child, in beauty's dawn, Within the nursery's shade withdrawn, Or peeping out—like a young moon Upon a world 'twill brighten soon. Then next, in girlhood's blushing hour, As from thy own lov'd Abbey-tower I've seen thee look, all radiant, down, With smiles that to the hoary frown Of centuries round thee lent a ray, Chasing even Age's gloom away;— Or, in the world's resplendent throng, As I have mark'd thee glide along, Among the crowds of fair and great A spirit, pure and separate, To which even Admiration's eye Was fearful to approach too nigh;— A creature, circled by a spell Within which nothing wrong could dwell; And fresh and clear as from the source, Holding through life her limpid course, Like Arethusa through the sea, Stealing in fountain purity. Now, too, another change of light! As noble bride, still meekly bright, Thou bring'st thy Lord a dower above All earthly price, pure woman's love; And show'st what lustre Rank receives, When with his proud Corinthian leaves Her rose thus high-bred Beauty weaves. Wonder not if, where all's so fair, To choose were more than bard can dare; Wonder not if, while every scene I've watch'd thee through so bright hath been, The' enamour'd Muse should, in her quest Of beauty, know not where to rest, But, dazzled, at thy feet thus fall, Hailing thee beautiful in all! A SPECULATION. Of all speculations the market holds forth, The best that I know for a lover of pelf, Is to buy Marcus up, at the price he is worth, And then sell him at that which he sets on himself. TO MY MOTHER. WRITTEN IN A POCKET BOOK, 1822. They tell us of an Indian tree, Which, howsoe'er the sun and sky May tempt its boughs to wander free, And shoot, and blossom, wide and high, Far better loves to bend its arms Downward again to that dear earth, From which the life, that fills and warms Its grateful being, first had birth. 'Tis thus, though woo'd by flattering friends, And fed with fame (if fame it be) This heart, my own dear mother, bends, With love's true instinct, back to thee! LOVE AND HYMEN. Love had a fever—ne'er could close His little eyes till day was breaking; And wild and strange enough, Heav'n knows, The things he rav'd about while waking. To let him pine so were a sin;— One, to whom all the world's a debtor— So Doctor Hymen was call'd in, And Love that night slept rather better. Next day the case gave further hope yet, Though still some ugly fever latent;— “Dose, as before”—a gentle opiate, For which old Hymen has a patent. After a month of daily call, So fast the dose went on restoring, That Love, who first ne'er slept at all, Now took, the rogue! to downright snoring. LINES ON THE ENTRY OF THE AUSTRIANS INTO NAPLES, 1821. Carbone notati. Ay—down to the dust with them, slaves as they are, From this hour, let the blood in their dastardly veins, That shrunk at the first touch of Liberty's war, Be wasted for tyrants, or stagnate in chains. On, on like a cloud, through their beautiful vales, Ye locusts of tyranny, blasting them o'er— Fill, fill up their wide sunny waters, ye sails From each slave-mart of Europe, and shadow their shore! Let their fate be a mock-word—let men of all lands Laugh out, with a scorn that shall ring to the poles, When each sword, that the cowards let fall from their hands, Shall be forg'd into fetters to enter their souls. And deep, and more deep, as the iron is driv'n, Base slaves! let the whet of their agony be, To think—as the Doom'd often think of that heav'n They had once within reach—that they might have been free. Oh shame! when there was not a bosom, whose heat Ever rose 'bove the zero of C?h's heart, That did not, like echo, your war-hymn repeat, And send all its prayers with your Liberty's start; When the world stood in hope—when a spirit, that breath'd The fresh air of the olden time, whisper'd about; And the swords of all Italy, half-way unsheath'd, But waited one conquering cry, to flash out! When around you the shades of your Mighty in fame, Filicajas and Petrarchs, seemed bursting to view, And their words, and their warnings, like tongues of bright flame Over Freedom's apostles, fell kindling on you! Oh shame! that, in such a proud moment of life, Worth the hist'ry of ages, when, had you but hurl'd One bolt at your tyrant invader, that strife Between freemen and tyrants had spread through the world— That then—oh! disgrace upon manhood—ev'n then, You should falter, should cling to your pitiful breath; Cow'r down into beasts, when you might have stood men, And prefer the slave's life of prostration to death. It is strange, it is dreadful:—shout, Tyranny, shout Through your dungeons and palaces, “Freedom is o'er;”— If there lingers one spark of her light, tread it out, And return to your empire of darkness once more. For, if such are the braggarts that claim to be free, Come, Despot of Russia, thy feet let me kiss; Far nobler to live the brute bondman of thee, Than to sully ev'n chains by a struggle like this!

['Twas when the world was in its prime] 'Twas when the world was in its prime, When the fresh stars had just begun Their race of glory, and young Time Told his first birth-days by the sun; When, in the light of Nature's dawn Rejoicing, men and angels met The Mahometans believe, says D'Herbelot, that in that early period of the world, “les hommes n'eurent qu'une seule religion, et furent souvent visités des Anges, qui leur donnoient la main.” On the high hill and sunny lawn,— Ere sorrow came, or Sin had drawn 'Twixt man and heaven her curtain yet! When earth lay nearer to the skies Than in these days of crime and woe, And mortals saw, without surprise, In the mid-air, angelic eyes Gazing upon this world below. Alas, that Passion should profane, Ev'n then, the morning of the earth! That, sadder still, the fatal stain Should fall on hearts of heavenly birth— And that from Woman's love should fall So dark a stain, most sad of all! One evening, in that primal hour, On a hill's side, where hung the ray Of sunset, brightening rill and bower, Three noble youths conversing lay; And, as they look'd, from time to time, To the far sky, where Daylight furl'd His radiant wing, their brows sublime Bespoke them of that distant world— Spirits, who once, in brotherhood Of faith and bliss, near Alla stood, And o'er whose cheeks full oft had blown The wind that breathes from Alla's throne “To which will be joined the sound of the bells hanging on the trees, which will be put in motion by the wind proceeding from the Throne, so often as the Blessed wish for music.” —See Sale's Koran, Prelim. Dissert., Creatures of light, such as still play, Like motes in sunshine, round the Lord, And through their infinite array Transmit each moment, night and day, The echo of His luminous word! Of Heaven they spoke, and, still more oft, Of the bright eyes that charm'd them thence; Till, yielding gradual to the soft And balmy evening's influence— The silent breathing of the flowers— The melting light that beam'd above, As on their first, fond, erring hours,— Each told the story of his love, The history of that hour unblest, When, like a bird, from its high nest Won down by fascinating eyes, For Woman's smile he lost the skies. The First who spoke was one, with look The least celestial of the three— A Spirit of light mould, that took The prints of earth most yieldingly; Who, ev'n in heaven, was not of those Nearest the Throne The ancient Persians supposed that this Throne was placed in the Sun, and that through the stars were distributed the various classes of Angels that encircled it. The Basilidians supposed that there were three hundred and sixty-five orders of angels, “dont la perfection alloit en décroissant, à mesure qu'ils s'éloignoient de la première classe d'esprits placés dans le premier ciel.” See Dupuis, Orig. des Cultes, tom. ii. p. 112., but held a place Far off, among those shining rows That circle out through endless space, And o'er whose wings the light from Him In Heaven's centre falls most dim. Still fair and glorious, he but shone Among those youths the' unheavenliest one— A creature, to whom light remain'd From Eden still, but alter'd, stain'd, And o'er whose brow not Love alone A blight had, in his transit, cast, But other, earthlier joys had gone, And left their foot-prints as they pass'd. Sighing, as back through ages flown, Like a tomb-searcher, Memory ran, Lifting each shroud that Time had thrown O'er buried hopes, he thus began:— FIRST ANGEL'S STORY. “'Twas in a land, that far away Into the golden orient lies, Where Nature knows not night's delay, But springs to meet her bridegroom, Day, Upon the threshold of the skies. One morn, on earthly mission sent It appears that, in most languages, the term employed for an angel means also a messenger. Firischteh, the Persian word for angel, is derived (says D'Herbelot) from the verb Firischtin, to send. The Hebrew term, too, Melak, has the same signification., And mid-way choosing where to light, I saw, from the blue element— Oh beautiful, but fatal sight!— One of earth's fairest womankind, Half veil'd from view, or rather shrin'd In the clear crystal of a brook; Which, while it hid no single gleam Of her young beauties, made them look More spirit-like, as they might seem Through the dim shadowing of a dream. Pausing in wonder I look'd on, While, playfully around her breaking The waters, that like diamonds shone, She mov'd in light of her own making. At length, as from that airy height I gently lower'd my breathless flight, The tremble of my wings all o'er (For through each plume I felt the thrill) Startled her, as she reach'd the shore Of that small lake—her mirror still— Above whose brink she stood, like snow When rosy with a sunset glow. Never shall I forget those eyes!— The shame, the innocent surprise Of that bright face, when in the air Uplooking, she beheld me there. It seem'd as if each thought, and look, And motion were that minute chain'd Fast to the spot, such root she took, And—like a sunflower by a brook, With face upturn'd—so still remain'd! In pity to the wondering maid, Though loth from such a vision turning, Downward I bent, beneath the shade Of my spread wings to hide the burning Of glances, which—I well could feel— For me, for her, too warmly shone; But, ere I could again unseal My restless eyes, or even steal One sidelong look, the maid was gone— Hid from me in the forest leaves, Sudden as when, in all her charms Of full-blown light, some cloud receives The Moon into his dusky arms. 'Tis not in words to tell the power, The despotism that, from that hour, Passion held o'er me. Day and night I sought around each neighbouring spot; And, in the chase of this sweet light, My task, and heaven, and all forgot;— All, but the one, sole, haunting dream Of her I saw in that bright stream. Nor was it long, ere by her side I found myself, whole happy days, Listening to words, whose music vied With our own Eden's seraph lays, When seraph lays are warm'd by love, But, wanting that, far, far above!— And looking into eyes where, blue And beautiful, like skies seen through The sleeping wave, for me there shone A heaven, more worshipp'd than my own. Oh what, while I could hear and see Such words and looks, was heaven to me? Though gross the air on earth I drew, 'Twas blessed, while she breath'd it too; Though dark the flowers, though dim the sky, Love lent them light, while she was nigh. Throughout creation I but knew Two separate worlds—the one, that small, Belov'd, and consecrated spot Where Lea was—the other, all The dull, wide waste, where she was not! But vain my suit, my madness vain; Though gladly, from her eyes to gain One earthly look, one stray desire, I would have torn the wings, that hung Furl'd at my back, and o'er the Fire In Gehim's The name given by the Mahometans to the infernal regions, over which, they say, the angel Tabhek presides. By the seven gates of hell, mentioned in the Koran, the commentators understand seven different departments or wards, in which seven different sorts of sinners are to be punished. The first, called Gehennem, is for sinful Mussulmans; the second, Ladha, for Christian offenders; the third, Hothama, is appointed for Jews; and the fourth and fifth, called Sair and Sacar, are destined to receive the Sabæans and the worshippers of fire: in the sixth, named Gehim, those pagans and idolaters who admit a plurality of gods are placed; while into the abyss of the seventh, called Derk Asfal, or the Deepest, the hypocritical canters of all religions are thrown. pit their fragments flung;— 'Twas hopeless all—pure and unmov'd She stood, as lilies in the light Of the hot noon but look more white;— And though she lov'd me, deeply lov'd, 'Twas not as man, as mortal—no, Nothing of earth was in that glow— She lov'd me but as one, of race Angelic, from that radiant place She saw so oft in dreams—that Heaven, To which her prayers at morn were sent, And on whose light she gaz'd at even, Wishing for wings, that she might go Out of this shadowy world below, To that free, glorious element! Well I remember by her side Sitting at rosy even-tide, When,—turning to the star, whose head Look'd out, as from a bridal bed, At that mute, blushing hour,—she said, “Oh! that it were my doom to be “The Spirit of yon beauteous star, “Dwelling up there in purity, “Alone, as all such bright things are;— “My sole employ to pray and shine, “To light my censer at the sun, “And cast its fire towards the shrine “Of Him in heaven, the Eternal One!” So innocent the maid, so free From mortal taint in soul and frame, Whom 'twas my crime—my destiny— To love, aye, burn for, with a flame, To which earth's wildest fires are tame. Had you but seen her look, when first From my mad lips the' avowal burst; Not anger'd—no—the feeling came From depths beyond mere anger's flame— It was a sorrow, calm as deep, A mournfulness that could not weep, So fill'd her heart was to the brink, So fix'd and froz'n with grief, to think That angel natures—that ev'n I, Whose love she clung to, as the tie Between her spirit and the sky— Should fall thus headlong from the height Of all that heaven hath pure and bright! That very night—my heart had grown Impatient of its inward burning; The term, too, of my stay was flown, And the bright Watchers near the throne, Already, if a meteor shone Between them and this nether zone, Thought 'twas their herald's wing returning. Oft did the potent spell-word, given To Envoys hither from the skies, To be pronounc'd, when back to heaven It is their time or wish to rise, Come to my lips that fatal day; And once, too, was so nearly spoken, That my spread plumage in the ray And breeze of heaven began to play;— When my heart fail'd—the spell was broken— The word unfinish'd died away, And my check'd plumes, ready to soar, Fell slack and lifeless as before. How could I leave a world, which she, Or lost or won, made all to me? No matter where my wanderings were, So there she look'd, breath'd, mov'd about— Woe, ruin, death, more sweet with her, Than Paradise itself, without! But, to return—that very day A feast was held, where, full of mirth, Came—crowding thick as flowers that play In summer winds—the young and gay And beautiful of this bright earth. And she was there, and 'mid the young And beautiful stood first, alone; Though on her gentle brow still hung The shadow I that morn had thrown— The first, that ever shame or woe Had cast upon its vernal snow. My heart was madden'd;—in the flush Of the wild revel I gave way To all that frantic mirth—that rush Of desperate gaiety, which they, Who never felt how pain's excess Can break out thus, think happiness! Sad mimicry of mirth and life, Whose flashes come but from the strife Of inward passions—like the light Struck out by clashing swords in fight. Then, too, that juice of earth, the bane And blessing of man's heart and brain— That draught of sorcery, which brings Phantoms of fair, forbidden things— Whose drops, like those of rainbows, smile Upon the mists that circle man, Bright'ning not only Earth, the while, But grasping Heaven, too, in their span!— Then first the fatal wine-cup rain'd Its dews of darkness through my lips I have already mentioned that some of the circumstances of this story were suggested to me by the eastern legend of the two angels, Harut and Marut, as given by Mariti, who says that the author of the Taalim founds upon it the Mahometan prohibition of wine. The Bahardanush tells the fable differently. I have since found that Mariti's version of the tale (which differs also from that of Dr. Prideaux, in his Life of Mahomet,) is taken from the French Encyclopédie, in which work, under the head “Arot et Marot,” the reader will find it., Casting whate'er of light remain'd To my lost soul into eclipse; And filling it with such wild dreams, Such fantasies and wrong desires, As, in the absence of heaven's beams, Haunt us for ever—like wild-fires That walk this earth, when day retires. Now hear the rest;—our banquet done, I sought her in the' accustom'd bower, Where late we oft, when day was gone, And the world hush'd, had met alone, At the same silent, moonlight hour. Her eyes, as usual, were upturn'd To her lov'd star, whose lustre burn'd Purer than ever on that night; While she, in looking, grew more bright, As though she borrow'd of its light. There was a virtue in that scene, A spell of holiness around, Which, had my burning brain not been Thus madden'd, would have held me bound, As though I trod celestial ground. Ev'n as it was, with soul all flame, And lips that burn'd in their own sighs, I stood to gaze, with awe and shame— The memory of Eden came Full o'er me when I saw those eyes; And tho' too well each glance of mine To the pale, shrinking maiden prov'd How far, alas, from aught divine, Aught worthy of so pure a shrine, Was the wild love with which I lov'd, Yet must she, too, have seen—oh yes, 'Tis soothing but to think she saw The deep, true, soul-felt tenderness, The homage of an Angel's awe To her, a mortal, whom pure love Then plac'd above him—far above— And all that struggle to repress A sinful spirit's mad excess, Which work'd within me at that hour, When, with a voice, where Passion shed All the deep sadness of her power, Her melancholy power—I said, “Then be it so; if back to heaven “I must unlov'd, unpitied fly, “Without one blest memorial given “To soothe me in that lonely sky; “One look, like those the young and fond “Give when they're parting—which would be, “Ev'n in remembrance, far beyond “All heaven hath left of bliss for me! “Oh, but to see that head recline “A minute on this trembling arm, “And those mild eyes look up to mine, “Without a dread, a thought of harm! “To meet, but once, the thrilling touch “Of lips too purely fond to fear me— “Or, if that boon be all too much, “Ev'n thus to bring their fragrance near me! “Nay, shrink not so—a look—a word— “Give them but kindly and I fly; “Already, see, my plumes have stirr'd, “And tremble for their home on high. “Thus be our parting—cheek to cheek— “One minute's lapse will be forgiven, “And thou, the next, shalt hear me speak “The spell that plumes my wing for heaven!” While thus I spoke, the fearfull maid, Of me, and of herself afraid, Had shrinking stood, like flowers beneath The scorching of the south-wind's breath: But when I nam'd—alas, too well, I now recall, though wilder'd then,— Instantly, when I nam'd the spell, Her brow, her eyes uprose again, And, with an eagerness, that spoke The sudden light that o'er her broke, “The spell, the spell!—oh, speak it now, “And I will bless thee!” she exlaim'd— Unknowing what I did, inflam'd, And lost already, on her brow I stamp'd one burning kiss, and nam'd The mystic word, till then ne'er told To living creature of earth's mould! Scarce was it said, when, quick as thought, Her lips from mine, like echo, caught The holy sound—her hands and eyes Were instant lifted to the skies, And thrice to heaven she spoke it out With that triumphant look Faith wears, When not a cloud of fear or doubt, A vapour from this vale of tears, Between her and her God appears! That very moment her whole frame All bright and glorified became, And at her back I saw unclose Two wings, magnificent as those That sparkle around Alla's Throne, Whose plumes, as buoyantly she rose Above me, in the moon-beam shone With a pure light, which—from its hue, Unknown upon this earth—I knew Was light from Eden, glistening through! Most holy vision! ne'er before Did aught so radiant—since the day When Eblis, in his downfal, bore The third of the bright stars away— Rise, in earth's beauty, to repair That loss of light and glory there! But did I tamely view her flight? Did not I, too, proclaim out thrice The powerful words that were, that night,— Oh ev'n for heaven too much delight!— Again to bring us, eyes to eyes, And soul to soul, in Paradise? I did—I spoke it o'er and o'er— I pray'd, I wept, but all in vain; For me the spell had power no more. There seem'd around me some dark chain Which still, as I essay'd to soar, Baffled, alas, each wild endeavour: Dead lay my wings, as they have lain Since tha sad hour, and will remain— So wills the' offended God—for ever! It was to yonder star I trac'd Her journey up the' illumin'd waste— That isle in the blue firmament, To which so oft her fancy went In wishes and in dreams before, And which was now—such, Purity, Thy blest reward—ordain'd to be Her home of light for evermore! Once—or did I but fancy so?— Ev'n in her flight to that fair sphere, Mid all her spirit's new-felt glow, A pitying look she turn'd below On him who stood in darkness here; Him whom, perhaps, if vain regret Can dwell in heaven, she pities yet; And oft, when looking to this dim And distant world, remembers him. But soon that passing dream was gone; Farther and farther off she shone, Till lessen'd to a point, as small As are those specks that yonder burn,— Those vivid drops of light, that fall The last from Day's exhausted urn. And when at length she merg'd, afar, Into her own immortal star, And when at length my straining sight Had caught her wing's last fading ray, That minute from my soul the light Of heaven and love both pass'd away; And I forgot my home, my birth, Profan'd my spirit, sunk my brow, And revell'd in gross joys of earth, Till I became—what I am now!” The Spirit bow'd his head in shame; A shame, that of itself would tell— Were there not ev'n those breaks of flame, Celestial, through his clouded frame— How grand the height from which he fell! That holy Shame, which ne'er forgets The' unblench'd renown it us'd to wear; Whose blush remains, when Virtue sets, To show her sunshine has been there. Once only, while the tale he told, Were his eyes lifted to behold That happy stainless star, where she Dwelt in her bower of purity! One minute did he look, and then— As thou he felt some deadly pain From its sweet light through heart and brain— Shrunk back, and never look'd again. Who was the Second Spirit? he With the proud front and piercing glance— Who seem'd, when viewing heaven's expanse, As though his far-sent eye could see On, on into the' Immensity Behind the veils of that blue sky, Where Alla's grandest secrets lie?— His wings, the while, though day was gone, Flashing with many a various hue Of light they from themselves alone, Instinct with Eden's brightness, drew. 'Twas Rubi—once among the prime And flower of those bright creatures, nam'd Spirits of Knowledge The Kerubiim, as the Mussulmans call them, are often joined indiscriminately with the Asrafil or Seraphim, under one common name of Azazil, by which all spirits who approach near the throne of Alla are designated., who o'er Time And Space and Thought an empire claim'd, Second alone to Him, whose light Was, ev'n to theirs, as day to night; 'Twixt whom and them was distance far And wide, as would the journey be To reach from any island star The vague shores of Infinity! 'Twas Rubi, in whose mournful eye Slept the dim light of days gone by; Whose voice, though sweet, fell on the ear Like echoes, in some silent place, When first awak'd for many a year; And when he smil'd, if o'er his face Smile ever shone, 'twas like the grace Of moonlight rainbows, fair, but wan, The sunny life, the glory gone. Ev'n o'er his pride, though still the same, A softening shade from sorrow came; And though at times his spirit knew The kindlings of disdain and ire, Short was the fitful glare they threw— Like the last flashes, fierce but few, Seen through some noble pile on fire! Such was the Angel, who now broke The silence that had come o'er all, When he, the Spirit that last spoke, Clos'd the sad history of his fall; And, while a sacred lustre, flown For many a day, relum'd his cheek— Beautiful, as in days of old; And no those eloquent lips alone But every feature seem'd to speak— Thus his eventful story told:— SECOND ANGEL'S STORY. “You both remember well the day, When unto Eden's new-made bowers, Alla convok'd the bright array Of his supreme angelic powers, To witness the one wonder yet, Beyond man, angel, star, or sun, He must achieve, ere he could set His seal upon the world, as done— To see that last perfection rise, That crowning of creation's birth, When, mid the worship and surprise Of circling angels, Woman's eyes First open'd upon heaven and earth; And from their lids a thrill was sent, That through each living spirit went Like first light through the firmament! Can you forget how gradual stole The fresh-awaken'd breath of soul Throughout her perfect form—which seem'd To grow transparent, as there beam'd That dawn of Mind within, and caught New loveliness from each new thought? Slow as o'er summer seas we trace The progress of the noontide air, Dimpling its bright and silent face Each minute into some new grace, And varying heaven's reflections there— Or, like the light of evening, stealing O'er some fair temple, which all day Hath slept in shadow, slow revealing Its several beauties, ray by ray, Till it shines out, a thing to bless, All full of light and loveliness. Can you forget her blush, when round Through Eden's lone, enchanted ground She look'd, and saw, the sea—the skies— And heard the rush of many a wing, On high behests then vanishing; And saw the last few angel eyes, Still lingering—mine among the rest,— Reluctant leaving scenes so blest? From that miraculous hour, the fate Of this new, glorious Being dwelt For ever, with a spell-like weight, Upon my spirit—early, late, Whate'er I did, or dream'd, or felt, The thought of what might yet befall That matchless creature mix'd with all.— Nor she alone, but her whole race Through ages yet to come—whate'er Of feminine, and fond, and fair, Should spring from that pure mind and face, All wak'd my soul's intensest care; Their forms, souls, feelings, still to me Creation's strangest mystery! It was my doom—ev'n from the first, When witnessing the primal burst Of Nature's wonders, I saw rise Those bright creations in the skies,— Those worlds instinct with life and light, Which Man, remote, but sees by night,— It was my doom still to be haunted By some new wonder, some sublime And matchless work, that, for the time Held all my soul, enchain'd, enchanted, And left me not a thought, a dream, A word, but on that only theme! The wish to know—that endless thirst, Which ev'n by quenching is awak'd, And which becomes or blest or curst, As is the fount whereat 'tis slak'd— Still urg'd me onward, with desire Insatiate, to explore, inquire— Whate'er the wondrous things might be, That wak'd each new idolatry— Their cause, aim, source, whence-ever sprung— Their inmost powers, as though for me Existence on that knowledge hung. Oh what a vision were the stars, When first I saw them burn on high, Rolling along, like living cars Of light, for gods to journey by! “C'est un fait indubitable que la plupart des anciens philosophes, soit Chaldéens, soit Grecs, nous ont donné les astres comme animés, et ont soutenu que les astres, qui nous éclairent n'étoient que, ou les chars, ou même les navires des Intelligences qui les conduisoient. Pour les Chars, cela se lit partout; on n'a qu'ouvrir Pline, St. Clément,” &amp;c. &amp;c.— Mémoire Historique, sur le Sabiisme, par M. Fourmont. A belief that the stars are either spirits or the vehicles of spirits, was common to all the religions and heresies of the East. Kircher has given the names and stations of the seven archangels, who were by the Cabala of the Jews distributed through the planets. They were my heart's first passion—days And nights, unwearied, in their rays Have I hung floating, till each sense Seem'd full of their bright influence. Innocent joy! alas, how much Of misery had I shunn'd below, Could I have still liv'd blest with such; Nor, proud and restless, burn'd to know The knowledge that brings guilt and woe. Often—so much I lov'd to trace The secrets of this starry race— Have I at morn and evening run Along the lines of radiance spun Like webs, between them and the sun, Untwisting all the tangled ties Of light into their different dyes— Then fleetly wing'd I off, in quest Of those, the farthest, loneliest, That watch, like winking sentinels According to the cosmogony of the ancient Persians, there were four stars set as sentinels in the four quarters of the heavens, to watch over the other fixed stars, and superintend the planets in their course. The names of these four centinel stars are, according to the Boundesh, Taschter, for the east; Satevis, for the west; Venand, for the south; and Haftorang, for the north., The void, beyond which Chaos dwells; And there, with noiseless plume, pursued Their track through that grand solitude, Asking intently all and each What soul within their radiance dwelt, And wishing their sweet light were speech, That they might tell me all they felt. Nay, oft, so passionate my chase Of these resplendent heirs of space, Oft did I follow—lest a ray Should 'scape me in the farthest night— Some pilgrim Comet, on his way To visit distant shrines of light, And well remember how I sung Exultingly, when on my sight New worlds of stars, all fresh and young, As if just born of darkness, sprung! Such was my pure ambition then, My sinless transport, night and morn; Ere yet this newer world of men, And that most fair of stars was born Which I, in fatal hour, saw rise Among the flowers of Paradise! Thenceforth my nature all was chang'd, My heart, soul, senses turn'd below; And he, who but so lately rang'd Yon wonderful expanse, where glow Worlds upon worlds,—yet found his mind Ev'n in that luminous range confin'd,— Now blest the humblest, meanest sod Of the dark earth where Woman trod! In vain my former idols glisten'd From their far thrones; in vain these ears To the once-thrilling music listen'd, That hymn'd around my favourite spheres— To earth, to earth each thought was given, That in this half-lost soul had birth; Like some high mount, whose head's in heaven, While its whole shadow rests on earth! Nor was it Love, ev'n yet, that thrall'd My spirit in his burning ties; And less, still less could it be call'd That grosser flame, round which Love flies Nearer and nearer, till he dies— No, it was wonder, such as thrill'd At all God's works my dazzled sense; The same rapt wonder, only fill'd With passion, more profound, intense,— A vehement, but wandering fire, Which, though nor love, nor yet desire,— Though through all womankind it took Its range, as lawless lightnings run, Yet wanted but a touch, a look, To fix it burning upon One. Then, too, the ever-restless zeal, The' insatiate curiosity To know how shapes, so fair, must feel— To look, but once, beneath the seal Of so much loveliness, and see What souls belong'd to such bright eyes— Whether, as sun-beams find their way Into the gem that hidden lies, Those looks could inward turn their ray, And make the soul as bright as they: All this impell'd my anxious chase, And still the more I saw and knew Of Woman's fond, weak, conquering race, The' intenser still my wonder grew. I had beheld their First, their Eve, Born in that splendid Paradise, Which sprung there solely to receive The first light of her waking eyes. I had seen purest angels lean In worship o'er her from above; And man—oh yes, had envying seen Proud man possess'd of all her love. I saw their happiness, so brief, So exquisite,—her error, too, That easy trust, that prompt belief In what the warm heart wishes true; That faith in words, when kindly said, By which the whole fond sex is led— Mingled with—what I durst not blame, For 'tis my own—that zeal to know, Sad, fatal zeal, so sure of woe; Which, though from heaven all pure it came, Yet stain'd, misus'd, brought sin and shame On her, on me, on all below! I had seen this; had seen Man, arm'd, As his soul is, with strength and sense, By her first words to ruin charm'd; His vaunted reason's cold defence, Like an ice-barrier in the ray Of melting summer, smil'd away. Nay, stranger yet, spite of all this— Though by her counsels taught to err, Though driv'n from Paradise for her, (And with her—that, at least, was bliss,) Had I not heard him, ere he crost The threshold of that earthly heaven, Which by her wildering smile he lost— So quickly was the wrong forgiven!— Had I not heard him, as he prest The frail, fond trembler to a breast Which she had doom'd to sin and strife, Call her—ev'n then—his Life! his Life! Chavah, or, as it is in Arabic, Havah (the name by which Adam called the woman after their transgression), means “Life.” Yes, such the love-taught name, the first, That ruin'd Man to Woman gave, Ev'n in his outcast hour, when curst By her fond witchery, with that worst And earliest boon of love, the grave! She, who brought death into the world, There stood before him, with the light Of their lost Paradise still bright Upon those sunny locks, that curl'd Down her white shoulders to her feet— So beautiful in form, so sweet In heart and voice, as to redeem The loss, the death of all things dear, Except herself—and make it seem Life, endless Life, while she was near! Could I help wondering at a creature, Thus circled round with spells so strong— One, to whose every thought, word, feature, In joy and woe, through right and wrong, Such sweet omnipotence heaven gave, To bless or ruin, curse or save? Nor did the marvel cease with her— New Eves in all her daughters came, As strong to charm, as weak to err, As sure of man through praise and blame, Whate'er they brought him, pride or shame, He still the' unreasoning worshipper, And they, throughout all time, the same Enchantresses of soul and frame, Into whose hands, from first to last, This world with all its destinies, Devotedly by heaven seems cast, To save or ruin, as they please! Oh, 'tis not to be told how long, How restlessly I sigh'd to find Some one, from out that witching throng, Some abstract of the form and mind Of the whole matchless sex, from which, In my own arms beheld, possest, I might learn all the powers to witch, To warm, and (if my fate unblest Would have it) ruin, of the rest! Into whose inward soul and sense I might descend, as doth the bee Into the flower's deep heart, and thence Rifle, in all its purity, The prime, the quintessence, the whole Of wondrous Woman's frame and soul! At length, my burning wish, my prayer— (For such—oh what will tongues not dare, When hearts go wrong?—this lip preferr'd)— At length my ominous prayer was heard— But whether heard in heaven or hell, Listen—and thou wilt know too well. There was a maid, of all who move Like visions o'er this orb, most fit To be a bright young angel's love, Herself so bright, so exquisite! The pride, too, of her step, as light Along the' unconscious earth she went, Seem'd that of one, born with a right To walk some heav'nlier element, And tread in places where her feet A star at every step should meet. 'Twas not alone that loveliness By which the wilder'd sense is caught— Of lips, whose very breath could bless; Of playful blushes, that seem'd nought But luminous escapes of thought; Of eyes that, when by anger stirr'd, Were fire itself, but, at a word Of tenderness, all soft became As though they could, like the sun's bird, Dissolve away in their own flame— Of form, as pliant as the shoots Of a young tree, in vernal flower; Yet round and glowing as the fruits, That drop from it in summer's hour;— 'Twas not alone this loveliness That falls to loveliest women's share, Though, even here, her form could spare From its own beauty's rich excess Enough to make ev'n them more fair— But 'twas the Mind, outshining clear Through her whole frame—the soul, still near, To light each charm, yet independent Of what it lighted, as the sun That shines on flowers, would be resplendent Were there no flowers to shine upon— 'Twas this, all this, in one combin'd— The' unnumber'd looks and arts that form The glory of young woman-kind, Taken, in their perfection, warm, Ere time had chill'd a single charm, And stamp'd with such a seal of Mind, As gave to beauties, that might be Too sensual else, too unrefin'd, The impress of Divinity! 'Twas this—a union, which the hand Of Nature kept for her alone, Of every thing most playful, bland, Voluptuous, spiritual, grand, In angel-natures and her own— Oh this it was that drew me nigh One, who seem'd kin to heaven as I, A bright twin-sister from on high— One, in whose love, I felt, were given The mix'd delights of either sphere, All that the spirit seeks in heaven, And all the senses burn for here. Had we—but hold—hear every part Of our sad tale—spite of the pain Remembrance gives, when the fix'd dart Is stirr'd thus in the wound again— Hear every step, so full of bliss, And yet so ruinous, that led Down to the last, dark precipice, Where perish'd both—the fall'n, the dead! From the first hour she caught my sight, I never left her—day and night Hovering unseen around her way, And mid her loneliest musings near, I soon could track each thought that lay, Gleaming within her heart, as clear As pebbles within brooks appear; And there, among the countless things That keep young hearts for ever glowing, Vague wishes, fond imaginings, Love-dreams, as yet no object knowing— Light, winged hopes, that come when bid, And rainbow joys that end in weeping; And passions, among pure thoughts hid, Like serpents under flow'rets sleeping:— 'Mong all these feelings—felt where'er Young hearts are beating—I saw there Proud thoughts, aspirings high—beyond Whate'er yet dwelt in soul so fond— Glimpses of glory, far away Into the bright, vague future given; And fancies, free and grand, whose play, Like that of eaglets, is near heaven! With this, too—what a soul and heart To fall beneath the tempter's art!— A zeal for knowledge, such as ne'er Enshrin'd itself in form so fair, Since that first, fatal hour, when Eve, With every fruit of Eden blest, Save one alone—rather than leave That one unreach'd, lost all the rest. It was in dreams that first I stole With gentle mastery o'er her mind— In that rich twilight of the soul, When reason's beam, half hid behind The clouds of sleep, obscurely gilds Each shadowy shape the Fancy builds— 'Twas then, by that soft light, I brought Vague, glimmering visions to her view;— Catches of radiance, lost when caught, Bright labyrinths, that led to nought, And vistas, with no pathway through;— Dwellings of bliss, that opening shone, Then clos'd, dissolv'd, and left no trace— All that, in short, could tempt Hope on, But give her wing no resting-place; Myself the while, with brow, as yet, Pure as the young moon's coronet, Through every dream still in her sight, The' enchanter of each mocking scene, Who gave the hope, then brought the blight, Who said, “Behold yon world of light,” Then sudden dropt a veil between! At length, when I perceiv'd each thought, Waking or sleeping, fix'd on nought But these illusive scenes, and me— The phantom, who thus came and went, In half revealments, only meant To madden curiosity— When by such various arts I found Her fancy to its utmost wound, One night—'twas in a holy spot, Which she for pray'r had chos'n—a grot Of purest marble, built below Her garden beds, through which a glow From lamps invisible then stole, Brightly pervading all the place— Like that mysterious light the soul, Itself unseen, sheds through the face. There, at her altar while she knelt, And all that woman ever felt, When God and man both claim'd her sighs— Every warm thought, that ever dwelt, Like summer clouds, 'twixt earth and skies, Too pure to fall, too gross to rise, Spoke in her gestures, tones, and eyes— Then, as the mystic light's soft ray Grew softer still, as tho' its ray Was breath'd from her, I heard her say:— “Oh idol of my dreams! whate'er “Thy nature be—human, divine, “Or but half heav'nly—still too fair, “Too heavenly to be ever mine! “Wonderful Spirit, who dost make “Slumber so lovely, that it seems “No longer life to live awake, “Since heaven itself descends in dreams, “Why do I ever lose thee? why “When on thy realms and thee I gaze “Still drops that veil, which I could die, “Oh gladly, but one hour to raise? “Long ere such miracles as thou “And thine came o'er my thoughts, a thirst “For light was in this soul, which now “Thy looks have into passion nurs'd. “There's nothing bright above, below, “In sky—earth—ocean, that this breast “Doth not intensely burn to know, “And thee, thee, thee, o'er all the rest! “Then come, oh Spirit, from behind “The curtains of thy radiant home, “If thou would'st be as angel shrin'd, “Or lov'd and clasp'd as mortal, come! “Bring all thy dazzling wonders here, “That I may, waking, know and see; “Or waft me hence to thy own sphere, “Thy heaven or—aye, even that with thee! “Demon or God, who hold'st the book “Of knowledge spread beneath thine eye, “Give me, with thee, but one bright look “Into its leaves, and let me die! “By those ethereal wings, whose way “Lies through an element, so fraught “With living Mind, that, as they play, “Their every movement is a thought! “By that bright, wreathed hair, between “Whose sunny clusters the sweet wind “Of Paradise so late hath been, “And left its fragrant soul behind! “By those impassion'd eyes, that melt “Their light into the inmost heart; “Like sunset in the waters, felt “As molten fire through every part— “I do implore thee, oh most bright “And worshipp'd Spirit, shine but o'er “My waking, wondering eyes this night, “This one blest night—I ask no more!” Exhausted, breathless, as she said These burning words, her languid head Upon the altar's steps she cast, As if that brain-throb were its last— Till, startled by the breathing, nigh, Of lips, that echoed back her sigh, Sudden her brow again she rais'd; And there, just lighted on the shrine, Beheld me—not as I had blaz'd Around her, full of light divine, In her late dreams, but soften'd down Into more mortal grace;—my crown Of flowers, too radiant for this world, Left hanging on yon starry steep; My wings shut up, like banners furl'd, When Peace hath put their pomp to sleep; Or like autumnal clouds, that keep Their lightnings sheath'd, rather than mar The dawning hour of some young star; And nothing left, but what beseem'd The' accessible, though glorious mate Of mortal woman—whose eyes beam'd Back upon hers, as passionate; Whose ready heart brought flame for flame, Whose sin, whose madness was the same; And whose soul lost, in that one hour, For her and for her love—oh more Of heaven's light than ev'n the power Of heav'n itself could now restore! And yet, that hour!”— The Spirit here Stopp'd in his utterance, as if words Gave way beneath the wild career Of his then rushing thoughts—like chords, Midway in some enthusiast's song, Breaking beneath a touch too strong; While the clench'd hand upon the brow Told how remembrance throbb'd there now! But soon 'twas o'er—that casual blaze From the sunk fire of other days— That relic of a flame, whose burning Had been too fierce to be relum'd, Soon pass'd away, and the youth, turning To his bright listeners, thus resum'd:— “Days, months elaps'd, and, though what most On earth I sigh'd for was mine, all— Yet—was I happy? God, thou know'st, Howe'er they smile, and feign, and boast, What happiness is theirs, who fall! 'Twas bitterest anguish—made more keen Ev'n by the love, the bliss, between Whose throbs it came, like gleams of hell In agonizing cross-light given Athwart the glimpses, they who dwell In purgatory Called by the Mussulmans Al Araf—a sort of wall or partition which, according to the 7th chapter of the Koran, separates hell from paradise, and where they, who have not merits sufficient to gain them immediate admittance into heaven, are supposed to stand for a certain period, alternately tantalized and tormented by the sights that are on either side presented to them. Manes, who borrowed in many instances from the Platonists, placed his purgatories, or places of purification, in the Sun and Moon. —Beausobre, liv. iii. chap. 8. catch of heaven! The only feeling that to me Seem'd joy—or rather my sole rest From aching misery—was to see My young, proud, blooming Lilis blest. She, the fair fountain of all ill To my lost soul—whom yet its thirst Fervidly panted after still, And found the charm fresh as at first— To see her happy—to reflect Whatever beams still round me play'd Of former pride, of glory wreck'd, On her, my Moon, whose light I made, And whose soul worshipp'd ev'n my shade— This was, I own, enjoyment—this My sole, last lingering glimpse of bliss. And proud she was, fair creature!—proud, Beyond what ev'n most queenly stirs In woman's heart, nor would have bow'd That beautiful young brow of hers To aught beneath the First above, So high she deem'd her Cherub's love! Then, too, that passion, hourly growing Stronger and stronger—to which even Her love, at times, gave way—of knowing Every thing strange in earth and heaven; Not only all that, full reveal'd, The' eternal Alla loves to show, But all that He hath wisely seal'd In darkness, for man not to know— Ev'n this desire, alas, ill-starr'd And fatal as it was, I sought To feed each minute, and unbarr'd Such realms of wonder on her thought, As ne'er, till then, had let their light Escape on any mortal's sight! In the deep earth—beneath the sea— Through caves of fire—through wilds of air— Wherever sleeping Mystery Had spread her curtain, we were there— Love still beside us, as we went, At home in each new element, And sure of worship every where! Then first was Nature taught to lay The wealth of all her kingdoms down At woman's worshipp'd feet, and say, “Bright creature, this is all thine own!” Then first were diamonds, from the night “Quelques gnomes désireux de devenir immortels, avoient voulu gagner les bonnes graces des nos filles, et leur avoient apporté des pierreries dont ils sont gardiens naturels: et ces auteurs ont crû, s'appuyans sur le livre d'Enoch mal-entendu, que c'étoient des pièges que les anges amoureux,” &amp;c. &amp;c. —Comte de Gabalis. As the fiction of the loves of angels with women gave birth to the fanciful world of sylphs and gnomes, so we owe to it also the invention of those beautiful Genii and Peris, which embellish so much the mythology of the East; for in the fabulous histories of Caiöumarath, of Thamurath, &amp;c., these spiritual creatures are always represented as the descendants of Seth, and called the Bani Algiann, or children of Giann., Of earth's deep centre brought to light, And made to grace the conquering way Of proud young beauty with their ray. Then, too, the pearl from out its shell Unsightly, in the sunless sea, (As 'twere a spirit, forc'd to dwell In form unlovely) was set free, And round the neck of woman threw A light it lent and borrow'd too. For never did this maid—whate'er The' ambition of the hour—forget Her sex's pride in being fair; Nor that adornment, tasteful, rare, Which makes the mighty magnet, set In Woman's form, more mighty yet. Nor was there aught within the range Of my swift wing in sea or air, Of beautiful, or grand, or strange, That, quickly as her wish could change, I did not seek, with such fond care, That when I've seen her look above At some bright star admiringly, I've said, “Nay, look not there, my love I am aware that this happy saying of Lord Albemarle's loses much of its grace and playfulness, by being put into the mouth of any but a human lover., Alas, I cannot give it thee!” But not alone the wonders found Through Nature's realm—the' unveil'd, material, Visible glories, that abound, Through all her vast, enchanted ground— But whatsoe'er unseen, ethereal, Dwells far away from human sense, Wrapp'd in its own intelligence— The mystery of that Fountain-head, From which all vital spirit runs, All breath of Life, where'er 'tis spread Through men or angels, flowers or suns— The workings of the' Almighty Mind, When first o'er Chaos he design'd The outlines of this world; and through That depth of darkness—like the bow, Call'd out of rain-clouds, hue by hue According to Whitehurst's theory, the mention of rainbows by an antediluvian angel is an anachronism; as he says, “There was no rain before the flood, and consequently no rainbow, which accounts for the novelty of this sight after the Deluge.”— Saw the grand, gradual picture grow;— The covenant with human kind By Alla made For the terms of this compact, of which the angels were supposed to be witnesses, see the chapter of the Koran, entitled Al Araf, and the article “Adam” in D'Herbelot.—the chains of Fate He round himself and them hath twin'd, Till his high task he consummate;— Till good from evil, love from hate, Shall be work'd out through sin and pain, And Fate shall loose her iron chain, And all be free, be bright again! Such were the deep-drawn mysteries, And some, ev'n more obscure, profound, And wildering to the mind than these, Which—far as woman's thought could sound, Or a fall'n, outlaw'd spirit reach— She dar'd to learn, and I to teach. Till—fill'd with such unearthly lore, And mingling the pure light it brings With much that fancy had, before, Shed in false, tinted glimmerings— The' enthusiast girl spoke out, as one Inspir'd, among her own dark race, Who from their ancient shrines would run, Leaving their holy rites undone, To gaze upon her holier face. And, though but wild the things she spoke, Yet, mid that play of error's smoke Into fair shapes by fancy curl'd, Some gleams of pure religion broke— Glimpses, that have not yet awoke, But startled the still dreaming world! Oh, many a truth, remote, sublime, Which Heav'n would from the minds of men Have kept conceal'd, till its own time, Stole out in these revealments then— Revealments dim, that have fore-run, By ages, the great, Sealing One! In acknowledging the authority of the great Prophets who had preceded him, Mahomet represented his own mission as the final “Seal,” or consummation of them all. Like that imperfect dawn, or light The Zodiacal Light. Escaping from the Zodiac's signs, Which makes the doubtful east half bright, Before the real morning shines! Thus did some moons of bliss go by— Of bliss to her, who saw but love And knowledge throughout earth and sky; To whose enamour'd soul and eye, I seem'd—as is the sun on high— The light of all below, above, The spirit of sea, and land, and air, Whose influence, felt every where, Spread from its centre, her own heart, Ev'n to the world's extremest part; While through that world her reinless mind Had now career'd so fast and far, That earth itself seem'd left behind, And her proud fancy, unconfin'd, Already saw Heaven's gates ajar! Happy enthusiast! still, oh, still Spite of my own heart's mortal chill, Spite of that double-fronted sorrow, Which looks at once before and back, Beholds the yesterday, the morrow, And sees both comfortless, both black— Spite of all this, I could have still In her delight forgot all ill; Or, if pain would not be forgot, At least have borne and murmur'd not. When thoughts of an offended heaven, Of sinfulness, which I—ev'n I, While down its steep most headlong driven— Well knew could never be forgiven, Came o'er me with an agony Beyond all reach of mortal woe— A torture kept for those who know, Know every thing, and—worst of all— Know and love Virtue while they fall! Ev'n then, her presence had the power To soothe, to warm—nay, ev'n to bless— If ever bliss could graft its flower On stem so full of bitterness— Ev'n then her glorious smile to me Brought warmth and radiance, if not balm; Like moonlight o'er a troubled sea, Brightening the storm it cannot calm. Oft, too, when that disheartening fear, Which all who love, beneath yon sky, Feel, when they gaze on what is dear— The dreadful thought that it must die! That desolating thought, which comes Into men's happiest hours and homes; Whose melancholy boding flings Death's shadow o'er the brightest things, Sicklies the infant's bloom, and spreads The grave beneath young lovers' heads! This fear, so sad to all—to me Most full of sadness, from the thought That I must still live on Pococke, however, gives it as the opinion of the Mahometan doctors, that all souls, not only of men and of animals, living either on land or in the sea, but of the angels also, must necessarily taste of death., when she Would, like the snow that on the sea Fell yesterday, in vain be sought; That heaven to me this final seal Of all earth's sorrow would deny, And I eternally must feel The death-pang, without power to die! Ev'n this, her fond endearments—fond As ever cherish'd the sweet bond 'Twixt heart and heart—could charm away; Before her look no clouds would stay, Or, if they did, their gloom was gone, Their darkness put a glory on! But 'tis not, 'tis not for the wrong, The guilty, to be happy long; And she, too, now, had sunk within The shadow of her tempter's sin, Too deep for ev'n Omnipotence To snatch the fated victim thence! Listen, and, if a tear there be Left in your hearts, weep it for me. 'Twas on the evening of a day, Which we in love had dreamt away; In that same garden, where—the pride Of seraph splendour laid aside, And those wings furl'd, whose open light For mortal gaze were else too bright— I first had stood before her sight, And found myself—oh, ecstasy, Which ev'n in pain I ne'er forget— Worshipp'd as only God should be, And lov'd as never man was yet! In that same garden were we now, Thoughtfully side by side reclining, Her eyes turn'd upward, and her brow With its own silent fancies shining. It was an evening bright and still As ever blush'd on wave or bower, Smiling from heaven, as if nought ill Could happen in so sweet an hour. Yet, I remember, both grew sad In looking at that light—ev'n she, Of heart so fresh, and brow so glad, Felt the still hour's solemnity, And thought she saw, in that repose, The death-hour not alone of light, But of this whole fair world—the close Of all things beautiful and bright— The last, grand sunset, in whose ray Nature herself died calm away! At length, as though some livelier thought Had suddenly her fancy caught, She turn'd upon me her dark eyes, Dilated into that full shape They took in joy, reproach, surprise, As 'twere to let more soul escape, And, playfully as on my head Her white hand rested, smil'd and said:— “I had, last night, a dream of thee, “Resembling those divine ones, given, “Like preludes to sweet minstrelsy, “Before thou cam'st, thyself, from heaven. “The same rich wreath was on thy brow, “Dazzling as if of starlight made; “And these wings, lying darkly now, “Like meteors round thee flash'd and play'd. “Thou stood'st, all bright, as in those dreams, “As if just wafted from above; “Mingling earth's warmth with heaven's beams, “A creature to adore and love. “Sudden I felt thee draw me near “To thy pure heart, where, fondly plac'd, “I seem'd within the atmosphere “Of that exhaling light embrac'd; “And felt, methought, the' ethereal flame “Pass from thy purer soul to mine; “Till—oh, too blissful—I became, “Like thee, all spirit, all divine! “Say, why did dream so blest come o'er me, “If, now I wake, 'tis faded, gone? “When will my Cherub shine before me “Thus radiant, as in heaven he shone? “When shall I, waking, be allow'd “To gaze upon those perfect charms, “And clasp thee once, without a cloud, “A chill of earth, within these arms? “Oh what a pride to say, this, this “Is my own Angel—all divine, “And pure, and dazzling as he is, “And fresh from heaven—he's mine, he's mine! “Think'st thou, were Lilis in thy place, “A creature of yon lofty skies, “She would have hid one single grace, “One glory from her lover's eyes? “No, no—then, if thou lov'st like me, “Shine out, young Spirit, in the blaze “Of thy most proud divinity, “Nor think thou'lt wound this mortal gaze. “Too long and oft I've look'd upon “Those ardent eyes, intense ev'n thus— “Too near the stars themselves have gone, “To fear aught grand or luminous. “Then doubt me not—oh, who can say “But that this dream may yet come true, “And my blest spirit drink thy ray, “Till it becomes all heavenly too? “Let me this once but feel the flame “Of those spread wings, the very pride “Will change my nature, and this frame “By the mere touch be deified!” Thus spoke the maid, as one, not us'd To be by earth or heav'n refus'd— As one, who knew her influence o'er All creatures, whatsoe'er they were, And, though to heaven she could not soar, At least would bring down heaven to her. Little did she, alas, or I— Ev'n I, whose soul, but half-way yet Immerg'd in sin's obscurity Was as the earth whereon we lie, O'er half whose disk the sun is set— Little did we foresee the fate, The dreadful—how can it be told? Such pain, such anguish to relate Is o'er again to feel, behold! But, charg'd as 'tis, my heart must speak Its sorrow out, or it will break! Some dark misgivings had, I own, Pass'd for a moment through my breast— Fears of some danger, vague, unknown, To one, or both—something unblest To happen from this proud request. But soon these boding fancies fled; Nor saw I aught that could forbid My full revealment, save the dread Of that first dazzle, when, unhid, Such light should burst upon a lid Ne'er tried in heaven;—and ev'n this glare She might, by love's own nursing care, Be, like young eagles, taught to bear. For well I knew, the lustre shed From cherub wings, when proudliest spread, Was, in its nature, lambent, pure, And innocent as is the light The glow-worm hangs out to allure Her mate to her green bower at night. Oft had I, in the mid-air, swept Through clouds in which the lightning slept, As in its lair, ready to spring, Yet wak'd it not—though from my wing A thousand sparks fell glittering! Oft too when round me from above The feather'd snow, in all its whiteness, Fell, like the moultings of heaven's Dove The Dove, or pigeon which attended Mahomet as his Familiar, and was frequently seen to whisper into his ear, was, if I recollect right, one of that select number of animals (including also the ant of Solomon, the dog of the Seven Sleepers, &amp;c.) which were thought by the Prophet worthy of admission into Paradise. “The Moslems have a tradition that Mahomet was saved (when he hid himself in a cave in Mount Shur) by his pursuers finding the mouth of the cave covered by a spider's web, and a nest built by two pigeons at the entrance, with two eggs unbroken in it, which made them think no one could have entered it. In consequence of this, they say, Mahomet enjoined his followers to look upon pigeons as sacred, and never to kill a spider.” —Modern Universal History, vol. i.,— So harmless, though so full of brightness, Was my brow's wreath, that it would shake From off its flowers each downy flake As delicate, unmelted, fair, And cool as they had lighted there. Nay ev'n with Lilis—had I not Around her sleep all radiant beam'd, Hung o'er her slumbers, nor forgot To kiss her eye-lids, as she dream'd? And yet, at morn, from that repose, Had she not wak'd, unscath'd and bright, As doth the pure, unconscious rose, Though by the fire-fly kiss'd all night? Thus having—as, alas, deceiv'd By my sin's blindness, I believ'd— No cause for dread, and those dark eyes Now fix'd upon me, eagerly As though the' unlocking of the skies Then waited but a sign from me— How could I pause? how ev'n let fall A word, a whisper that could stir In her proud heart a doubt, that all I brought from heaven belong'd to her Slow from her side I rose, while she Arose, too, mutely, tremblingly, But not with fear—all hope, and pride, She waited for the awful boon, Like priestesses, at eventide, Watching the rise of the full moon, Whose light, when once its orb hath shone, 'Twill madden them to look upon! Of all my glories, the bright crown, Which, when I last from heaven came down, Was left behind me, in yon star That shines from out those clouds afar,— Where, relic sad, 'tis treasur'd yet, The downfall'n angel's coronet!— Of all my glories, this alone Was wanting:—but the' illumin'd brow, The sun-bright locks, the eyes that now Had love's spell added to their own, And pour'd a light till then unknown;— The' unfolded wings, that, in their play, Shed sparkles bright as Alla's throne; All I could bring of heaven's array, Of that rich panoply of charms A Cherub moves in, on the day Of his best pomp, I now put on; And, proud that in her eyes I shone Thus glorious, glided to her arms; Which still (though, at a sight so splendid, Her dazzled brow had, instantly, Sunk on her breast,) were wide extended To clasp the form she durst not see! “Mohammed (says Sale), though a prophet, was not able to bear the sight of Gabriel, when he appeared in his proper form, much less would others be able to support it.” Great Heav'n! how could thy vengeance light So bitterly on one so bright? How could the hand, that gave such charms, Blast them again, in love's own arms? Scarce had I touch'd her shrinking frame, When—oh most horrible!—I felt That every spark of that pure flame— Pure, while among the stars I dwelt— Was now, by my transgression, turn'd Into gross, earthly fire, which burn'd, Burn'd all it touch'd, as fast as eye Could follow the fierce, ravening flashes; Till there—oh God, I still ask why Such doom was hers?—I saw her lie Black'ning within my arms to ashes! That brow, a glory but to see— Those lips, whose touch was what the first Fresh cup of immortality Is to a new-made angel's thirst! Those clasping arms, within whose round— My heart's horizon—the whole bound Of its hope, prospect, heaven was found! Which, ev'n in this dread moment, fond As when they first were round me cast, Loos'd not in death the fatal bond, But, burning, held me to the last! All, all, that, but that morn, had seem'd As if Love's self there breath'd and beam'd, Now, parch'd and black, before me lay, Withering in agony away; And mine, oh misery! mine the flame, From which this desolation came;— I, the curst spirit, whose caress Had blasted all that loveliness! 'Twas maddening!—but now hear even worse— Had death, death only, been the curse I brought upon her—had the doom But ended here, when her young bloom Lay in the dust—and did the spirit No part of that fell curse inherit, 'Twere not so dreadful—but, come near— Too shocking 'tis for earth to hear— Just when her eyes, in fading, took Their last, keen, agoniz'd farewell, And look'd in mine with—oh, that look! Great vengeful Power, whate'er the hell Thou may'st to human souls assign, The memory of that look is mine!— In her last struggle, on my brow Her ashy lips a kiss imprest, So withering!—I feel it now— 'Twas fire—but fire, ev'n more unblest Than was my own, and like that flame, The angels shudder but to name, Hell's everlasting element! Deep, deep it pierc'd into my brain, Madd'ning and torturing as it went; And here—mark here, the brand, the stain It left upon my front—burnt in By that last kiss of love and sin— A brand, which all the pomp and pride Of a fallen Spirit cannot hide! But is it thus, dread Providence— Can it, indeed, be thus, that she, Who, (but for one proud, fond offence,) Had honour'd heaven itself, should be Now doom'd—I cannot speak it—no, Merciful Alla! 'tis not so— Never could lips divine have said The fiat of a fate so dread. And yet, that look—so deeply fraught With more than anguish, with despair— That new, fierce fire, resembling nought In heaven or earth—this scorch I bear!— Oh—for the first time that these knees Have bent before thee since my fall, Great Power, if ever thy decrees Thou could'st for prayer like mine recall, Pardon that spirit, and on me, On me, who taught her pride to err, Shed out each drop of agony Thy burning phial keeps for her! See, too, where low beside me kneel Two other outcasts, who, though gone And lost themselves, yet dare to feel And pray for that poor mortal one. Alas, too well, too well they know The pain, the penitence, the woe That Passion brings upon the best, The wisest, and the loveliest.— Oh, who is to be sav'd, if such Bright, erring souls are not forgiven; So loth they wander, and so much Their very wanderings lean tow'rds heaven! Again, I cry, Just Power, transfer That creature's sufferings all to me— Mine, mine the guilt, the torment be, To save one minute's pain to her, Let mine last all eternity!” He paus'd, and to the earth bent down His throbbing head; while they, who felt That agony as 'twere their own, Those angel youths, beside him knelt, And, in the night's still silence there, While mournfully each wandering air Play'd in those plumes, that never more To their lost home in heav'n must soar, Breath'd inwardly the voiceless prayer, Unheard by all but Mercy's ear— And which if Mercy did not hear, Oh, God would not be what this bright And glorious universe of His, This world of beauty, goodness, light And endless love proclaims He is! Not long they knelt, when, from a wood That crown'd that airy solitude, They heard a low, uncertain sound, As from a lute, that just had found Some happy theme, and murmur'd round The new-born fancy, with fond tone, Scarce thinking aught so sweet its own! Till soon a voice, that match'd as well That gentle instrument, as suits The sea-air to an ocean-shell, (So kin its spirit to the lute's), Tremblingly follow'd the soft strain, Interpreting its joy, its pain, And lending the light wings of words To many a thought, that else had lain Unfledg'd and mute among the chords. All started at the sound—but chief The third young Angel, in whose face, Though faded like the others, grief Had left a gentler, holier trace; As if, ev'n yet, through pain and ill, Hope had not fled him—as if still Her precious pearl, in sorrow's cup, Unmelted at the bottom lay, To shine again, when, all drunk up, The bitterness should pass away. Chiefly did he, though in his eyes There shone more pleasure than surprise, Turn to the wood, from whence that sound Of solitary sweetness broke; Then, listening, look delighted round To his bright peers, while thus it spoke:— “Come, pray with me, my seraph love, “My angel-lord, come pray with me; “In vain to-night my lip hath strove “To send one holy prayer above— “The knee may bend, the lip may move, “But pray I cannot, without thee! “I've fed the altar in my bower “With droppings from the incense tree; “I've shelter'd it from wind and shower, “But dim it burns the livelong hour, “As if, like me, it had no power “Of life or lustre, without thee! “A boat at midnight sent alone “To drift upon the moonless sea, “A lute, whose leading chord is gone, “A wounded bird, that hath but one “Imperfect wing to soar upon, “Are like what I am, without thee! “Then ne'er, my spirit-love, divide, “In life or death, thyself from me; “But when again, in sunny pride, “Thou walk'st through Eden, let me glide, “A prostrate shadow, by thy side— “Oh happier thus than without thee!” The song had ceas'd, when, from the wood Which, sweeping down that airy height, Reach'd the lone spot whereon they stood— There suddenly shone out a light From a clear lamp, which, as it blaz'd Across the brow of one, who rais'd Its flame aloft (as if to throw The light upon that group below), Display'd two eyes, sparkling between The dusky leaves, such as are seen By fancy only, in those faces, That haunt a poet's walk at even, Looking from out their leafy places Upon his dreams of love and heaven. 'Twas but a moment—the blush, brought O'er all her features at the thought Of being seen thus, late, alone, By any but the eyes she sought, Had scarcely for an instant shone Through the dark leaves, when she was gone— Gone, like a meteor that o'erhead Suddenly shines, and, ere we've said, “Behold, how beautiful!”—'tis fled. Yet, ere she went, the words, “I come, “I come, my Nama,” reach'd her ear, In that kind voice, familiar, dear, Which tells of confidence, of home,— Of habit, that hath drawn hearts near, Till they grow one,—of faith sincere, And all that Love most loves to hear; A music, breathing of the past, The present and the time to be, Where Hope and Memory, to the last, Lengthen out life's true harmony! Nor long did he, whom call so kind Summon'd away, remain behind; Nor did there need much time to tell What they—alas, more fall'n than he From happiness and heaven—knew well, His gentler love's short history! Thus did it run—not as he told The tale himself, but as 'tis grav'd Upon the tablets that, of old, By Seth Seth is a favourite personage among the Orientals, and acts a conspicuous part in many of their most extravagant romances. The Syrians pretended to have a Testament of this Patriarch in their possession, in which was explained the whole theology of angels, their different orders, &amp;c. &amp;c. The Curds, too (as Hyde mentions in his Appendix), have a book, which contains all the rites of their religion, and which they call Sohuph Sheit, or the Book of Seth. In the same manner that Seth and Cham are supposed to have preserved these memorials of antediluvian knowledge, Xixuthrus is said in Chaldæan fable to have deposited in Siparis, the city of the Sun, those monuments of science which he had saved out of the waters of a deluge.—See Jablonski's learned remarks upon these columns or tablets of Seth, which he supposes to be the same with the pillars of Mercury, or the Egyptian Thoth. —Pantheon. Egypt. lib. v. cap. 5. were from the deluge sav'd, All written over with sublime And saddening legends of the' unblest, But glorious Spirits of that time, And this young Angel's 'mong the rest. THIRD ANGEL'S STORY. Among the Spirits, of pure flame, That in the' eternal heav'ns abide— Circles of light, that from the same Unclouded centre sweeping wide, Carry its beams on every side— Like spheres of air that waft around The undulations of rich sound— Till the far-circling radiance be Diffus'd into infinity! First and immediate near the Throne Of Alla The Mussulmans, says D'Herbelot, apply the general name, Mocarreboun, to all those Spirits “qui approchent le plus près le Trône.” Of this number are Mikail and Gebrail., as if most his own, The Seraphs stand The Seraphim, or Spirits of Divine Love. There appears to be, among writers on the East, as well as among the Orientals themselves, considerable indecision with regard to the respective claims of Seraphim and Cherubim to the highest rank in the celestial hierarchy. The derivation which Hyde assigns to the word Cherub seems to determine the precedence in favour of that order of spirits:— “Cherubim, i. e. Propinqui Angeli, qui sc. Deo proprius quam alii accedunt; nam Charab est i. q. Karab, appropinquare.” (P. 263.) Al Beidawi, too, one of the commentators of the Koran, on that passage, “the angels, who bear the throne, and those who stand about it,” (chap. xl.) says, “These are the Cherubim, the highest order of angels.” On the other hand, we have seen, in a preceding note, that the Syrians place the sphere in which the Seraphs dwell at the very summit of all the celestial systems; and even, among Mahometans, the word Azazil and Mocarreboun (which mean the spirits that stand nearest to the throne of Alla) are indiscriminately applied to both Seraphim and Cherubim.—this burning sign Trac'd on their banner, “Love Divine!” Their rank, their honours, far above Ev'n those to high-brow'd Cherubs given, Though knowing all;—so much doth Love Transcend all Knowledge, ev'n in heaven! 'Mong these was Zaraph once—and none E'er felt affection's holy fire, Or yearn'd towards the' Eternal One, With half such longing, deep desire. Love was to his impassion'd soul Not, as with others, a mere part Of its existence, but the whole— The very life-breath of his heart! Oft, when from Alla's lifted brow A lustre came, too bright to bear, And all the seraph ranks would bow, To shade their dazzled sight, nor dare To look upon the' effulgence there— This Spirit's eyes would court the blaze (Such pride he in adoring took), And rather lose, in that one gaze, The power of looking, than not look! Then too, when angel voices sung The mercy of their God, and strung Their harps to hail, with welcome sweet, That moment, watch'd for by all eyes, When some repentant sinner's feet First touch'd the threshold of the skies, Oh then how clearly did the voice Of Zaraph above all rejoice! Love was in every buoyant tone— Such love, as only could belong To the blest angels, and alone Could, ev'n from angels, bring such song! Alas, that it should e'er have been In heav'n as 'tis too often here, Where nothing fond or bright is seen, But it hath pain and peril near;— Where right and wrong so close resemble, That what we take for virtue's thrill Is often the first downward tremble Of the heart's balance unto ill; Where Love hath not a shrine so pure, So holy, but the serpent, Sin, In moments, ev'n the most secure, Beneath his altar may glide in! So was it with that Angel—such The charm, that slop'd his fall along, From good to ill, from loving much, Too easy lapse, to loving wrong.— Ev'n so that am'rous Spirit, bound By beauty's spell, where'er 'twas found, From the bright things above the moon Down to earth's beaming eyes descended, Till love for the Creator soon In passion for the creature ended. 'Twas first at twilight, on the shore Of the smooth sea, he heard the lute And voice of her he lov'd steal o'er The silver waters, that lay mute, As loth, by ev'n a breath, to stay The pilgrimage of that sweet lay; Whose echoes still went on and on, Till lost among the light that shone Far off, beyond the ocean's brim— There, where the rich cascade of day Had, o'er the' horizon's golden rim, Into Elysium roll'd away! Of God she sung, and of the mild Attendant Mercy, that beside His awful throne for ever smil'd, Ready, with her white hand, to guide His bolts of vengeance to their prey— That she might quench them on the way! Of Peace—of that Atoning Love, Upon whose star, shining above This twilight world of hope and fear, The weeping eyes of Faith are fix'd So fond, that with her every tear The light of that love-star is mix'd!— All this she sung, and such a soul Of piety was in that song, That the charm'd Angel, as it stole Tenderly to his ear, along Those lulling waters where he lay, Watching the daylight's dying ray, Thought 'twas a voice from out the wave, An echo, that some sea-nymph gave To Eden's distant harmony, Heard faint and sweet beneath the sea! Quickly, however, to its source, Tracking that music's melting course, He saw, upon the golden sand Of the sea-shore a maiden stand, Before whose feet the' expiring waves Flung their last offering with a sigh— As, in the East, exhausted slaves Lay down the far-brought gift, and die— And, while her lute hung by her, hush'd, As if unequal to the tide Of song, that from her lips still gush'd, She rais'd, like one beatified, Those eyes, whose light seem'd rather given To be ador'd than to adore— Such eyes, as may have look'd from heaven, But ne'er were rais'd to it before! Oh Love, Religion, Music “Les Egyptiens disent que la Musique est Sœur de la Religion.” —Voyages de Pythagore, tom. i. p. 422.—all That's left of Eden upon earth— The only blessings, since the fall Of our weak souls, that still recall A trace of their high, glorious birth— How kindred are the dreams you bring! How Love, though unto earth so prone, Delights to take Religion's wing, When time or grief hath stain'd his own! How near to Love's beguiling brink, Too oft, entranc'd Religion lies! While Music, Music is the link They both still hold by to the skies, The language of their native sphere, Which they had else forgotten here. How then could Zaraph fail to feel That moment's witcheries?—one, so fair, Breathing out music, that might steal Heaven from itself, and rapt in prayer That seraphs might be proud to share! Oh, he did feel it, all too well— With warmth, that far too dearly cost— Nor knew he, when at last he fell, To which attraction, to which spell, Love, Music, or Devotion, most His soul in that sweet hour was lost. Sweet was the hour, though dearly won, And pure, as aught of earth could be, For then first did the glorious sun Before religion's altar see Two hearts in wedlock's golden tie Self-pledg'd, in love to live and die. Blest union! by that Angel wove, And worthy from such hands to come; Safe, sole asylum, in which Love, When fall'n or exil'd from above, In this dark world can find a home. And, though the Spirit had transgress'd, Had, from his station 'mong the blest Won down by woman's smile, allow'd Terrestrial passion to breathe o'er The mirror of his heart, and cloud God's image, there so bright before— Yet never did that Power look down On error with a brow so mild; Never did Justice wear a frown, Through which so gently Mercy smil'd. For humble was their love—with awe And trembling like some treasure kept, That was not theirs by holy law— Whose beauty with remorse they saw, And o'er whose preciousness they wept. Humility, that low, sweet root, From which all heavenly virtues shoot, Was in the hearts of both—but most In Nama's heart, by whom alone Those charms, for which a heaven was lost, Seem'd all unvalued and unknown; And when her Seraph's eyes she caught, And hid hers glowing on his breast, Ev'n bliss was humbled by the thought— “What claim have I to be so blest?” Still less could maid, so meek, have nurs'd Desire of knowledge—that vain thirst, With which the sex hath all been curs'd, From luckless Eve to her, who near The Tabernacle stole to hear The secrets of the angels Sara.: no— To love as her own Seraph lov'd, With Faith, the same through bliss and woe— Faith, that, were ev'n its light remov'd, Could, like the dial, fix'd remain, And wait till it shone out again;— With Patience that, though often bow'd By the rude storm, can rise anew; And Hope that, ev'n from Evil's cloud, Sees sunny Good half breaking through! This deep, relying Love, worth more In heaven than all a Cherub's lore— This Faith, more sure than aught beside, Was the sole joy, ambition, pride Of her fond heart—the' unreasoning scope Of all its views, above, below— So true she felt it that to hope, To trust, is happier than to know. And thus in humbleness they trod, Abash'd, but pure before their God; Nor e'er did earth behold a sight So meekly beautiful as they, When, with the altar's holy light Full on their brows, they knelt to pray, Hand within hand, and side by side, Two links of love, awhile untied From the great chain above, but fast Holding together to the last!— Two fallen Splendors An allusion to the Sephiroths or Splendors of the Jewish Cabbala, represented as a tree, of which God is the crown or summit. The Sephiroths are the higher orders of emanative being in the strange and incomprehensible system of the Jewish Cabala. They are called by various names, Pity, Beauty, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and their influences are supposed to act through certain canals, which communicate with each other., from that tree, Which buds with such eternally The reader may judge of the rationality of this Jewish system by the following explanation of part of the machinery: —“Les canaux qui sortent de la Miséricorde et de la Force, et qui vont aboutir à la Beauté, sont chargés d'un grand nombre d'Anges. Il y en a trente-cinq sur le canal de la Miséricorde, qui recompensent et qui couronnent la vertu des Saints,” &amp;c. &amp;c.—For a concise account of the Cabalistic Philosophy, see Enfield's very useful compendium of Brucker. “On les représente quelquefois sous la figure d'un arbre ? l'Ensoph qu'on met au-dessus de l'arbre Sephirotique ou des Splendeurs divins, est l'Infini.” —L'Histoire des Juifs, liv. ix. 11., Shaken to earth, yet keeping all Their light and freshness in the fall. Their only punishment, (as wrong, However sweet, must bear its brand,) Their only doom was this—that, long As the green earth and ocean stand, They both shall wander here—the same, Throughout all time, in heart and frame— Still looking to that goal sublime, Whose light remote, but sure, they see; Pilgrims of Love, whose way is Time, Whose home is in Eternity! Subject, the while, to all the strife, True Love encounters in this life— The wishes, hopes, he breathes in vain; The chill, that turns his warmest sighs To earthly vapour, ere they rise; The doubt he feeds on, and the pain That in his very sweetness lies:— Still worse, the' illusions that betray His footsteps to their shining brink; That tempt him, on his desert way Through the bleak world, to bend and drink, Where nothing meets his lips, alas,— But he again must sighing pass On to that far-off home of peace, In which alone his thirst will cease. All this they bear, but, not the less, Have moments rich in happiness— Blest meetings, after many a day Of widowhood past far away, When the lov'd face again is seen Close, close, with not a tear between— Confidings frank, without control, Pour'd mutually from soul to soul; As free from any fear or doubt As is that light from chill or stain, The sun into the stars sheds out, To be by them shed back again!— That happy minglement of hearts, Where, chang'd as chymic compounds are, Each with its own existence parts, To find a new one, happier far! Such are their joys—and, crowning all, That blessed hope of the bright hour, When, happy and no more to fall, Their spirits shall, with freshen'd power, Rise up rewarded for their trust In Him, from whom all goodness springs, And, shaking off earth's soiling dust From their emancipated wings, Wander for ever through those skies Of radiance, where Love never dies! In what lone region of the earth These Pilgrims now may roam or dwell, God and the Angels, who look forth To watch their steps, alone can tell. But should we, in our wanderings, Meet a young pair, whose beauty wants But the adornment of bright wings, To look like heaven's inhabitants— Who shine where'er they tread, and yet Are humble in their earthly lot, As is the way-side violet, That shines unseen, and were it not For its sweet breath would be forgot— Whose hearts, in every thought, are one, Whose voices utter the same wills— Answering, as Echo doth some tone Of fairy music 'mong the hills, So like itself, we seek in vain Which is the echo, which the strain— Whose piety is love, whose love, Though close as 'twere their souls' embrace, Is not of earth, but from above— Like two fair mirrors, face to face, Whose light, from one to the' other thrown, Is heaven's reflection, not their own— Should we e'er meet with aught so pure, So perfect here, we may be sure 'Tis Zaraph and his bride we see; And call young lovers round, to view The pilgrim pair, as they pursue Their pathway tow'rds eternity. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. SCEPTICISM. Ere Psyche drank the cup, that shed Immortal Life into her soul, Some evil spirit pour'd, 'tis said, One drop of Doubt into the bowl— Which, mingling darkly with the stream, To Psyche's lips—she knew not why— Made ev'n that blessed nectar seem As though its sweetness soon would die. Oft, in the very arms of Love, A chill came o'er her heart—a fear That Death might, even yet, remove Her spirit from that happy sphere. “Those sunny ringlets,” she exclaim'd, Twining them round her snowy fingers; “That forehead, where a light, unnam'd, “Unknown on earth, for ever lingers; “Those lips, through which I feel the breath “Of Heav'n itself, whene'er they sever— “Say, are they mine, beyond all death, “My own, hereafter, and for ever? “Smile not—I know that starry brow, “Those ringlets, and bright lips of thine, “Will always shine, as they do now— “But shall I live to see them shine?” In vain did Love say, “Turn thine eyes “On all that sparkles round thee here— “Thou'rt now in heaven, where nothing dies, “And in these arms—what canst thou fear?” In vain—the fatal drop, that stole Into that cup's immortal treasure, Had lodg'd its bitter near her soul, And gave a tinge to every pleasure. And, though there ne'er was transport given Like Psyche's with that radiant boy, Hers is the only face in heaven, That wears a cloud amid its joy. A JOKE VERSIFIED. “Come, come,” said Tom's father, “at your time of life, “There's no longer excuse for thus playing the rake— “It is time you should think, boy, of taking a wife”— “Why, so it is, father—whose wife shall I take?” ON THE DEATH OF A FRIEND. Pure as the mantle, which, o'er him who stood By Jordan's stream, descended from the sky, Is that remembrance, which the wise and good Leave in the hearts that love them, when they die. So pure, so precious shall the memory be, Bequeath'd, in dying, to our souls by thee— So shall the love we bore thee, cherish'd warm Within our souls through grief, and pain, and strife, Be, like Elisha's cruise, a holy charm, Wherewith to “heal the waters” of this life! TO JAMES CORRY, ESQ. ON HIS MAKING ME A PRESENT OF A WINE STRAINER. Brighton, June, 1825. This life, dear Corry, who can doubt?— Resembles much friend Ewart's A wine-merchant. wine, When first the rosy drops come out, How beautiful, how clear they shine! And thus awhile they keep their tint, So free from even a shade with some, That they would smile, did you but hint, That darker drops would ever come. But soon the ruby tide runs short, Each minute makes the sad truth plainer, Till life, like old and crusty port, When near its close, requires a strainer. This friendship can alone confer, Alone can teach the drops to pass, If not as bright as once they were, At least unclouded, through the glass. Nor, Corry, could a boon be mine, Of which this heart were fonder, vainer, Than thus, if life grow like old wine, To have thy friendship for its strainer. FRAGMENT OF A CHARACTER. Here lies Factotum Ned at last; Long as he breath'd the vital air, Nothing throughout all Europe pass'd, In which Ned hadn't some small share. Whoe'er was in, whoe'er was out, Whatever statesmen did or said, If not exactly brought about, 'Twas all, at least, contriv'd by Ned. With Nap, if Russia went to war, 'Twas owing, under Providence, To certain hints Ned gave the Czar— (Vide his pamphlet—price, sixpence.) If France was beat at Waterloo— As all but Frenchmen think she was— To Ned, as Wellington well knew, Was owing half that day's applause. Then for his news—no envoy's bag E'er pass'd so many secrets through it; Scarcely a telegraph could wag Its wooden finger, but Ned knew it. Such tales he had of foreign plots, With foreign names, one's ear to buzz in! From Russia, chefs and ofs in lots, From Poland, owskis by the dozen. When George, alarm'd for England's creed, Turn'd out the last Whig ministry, And men ask'd—who advis'd the deed? Ned modestly confess'd 'twas he. For though, by some unlucky miss, He had not downright seen the King, He sent such hints through Viscount This, To Marquis That, as clench'd the thing. The same it was in science, arts, The Drama, Books, MS. and printed— Kean learn'd from Ned his cleverest parts, And Scott's last work by him was hinted. Childe Harold in the proofs he read, And, here and there, infused some soul in't— Nay, Davy's Lamp, till seen by Ned, Had—odd enough—an awkward hole in't. Twas thus, all-doing and all-knowing, Wit, statesman, boxer, chymist, singer, Whatever was the best pye going, In that Ned—trust him—had his finger. WHAT SHALL I SING THEE? TO ? What shall I sing thee? Shall I tell Of that bright hour, remember'd well As tho' it shone but yesterday, When, loitering idly in the ray Of a spring sun, I heard, o'er-head, My name as by some spirit said, And, looking up, saw two bright eyes Above me from a casement shine, Dazzling my mind with such surprise As they, who sail beyond the Line, Feel when new stars above them rise;— And it was thine, the voice that spoke, Like Ariel's, in the mid-air then; And thine the eye, whose lustre broke— Never to be forgot again! What shall I sing thee? Shall I weave A song of that sweet summer-eve, (Summer, of which the sunniest part Was that we, each, had in the heart,) When thou and I, and one like thee, In life and beauty, to the sound Of our own breathless minstrelsy, Danc'd till the sunlight faded round, Ourselves the whole ideal Ball, Lights, music, company, and all! Oh, 'tis not in the languid strain Of lute like mine, whose day is past, To call up ev'n a dream again Of the fresh light those moments cast. COUNTRY DANCE AND QUADRILLE. One night the nymph call'd Country Dance— (Whom folks, of late, have used so ill, Preferring a coquette from France, That mincing thing, Mamselle Quadrille)— Having been chased from London down To that most humble haunt of all She used to grace—a Country Town— Went smiling to the New-Year's Ball. “Here, here, at least,” she cried, “though driv'n “From London's gay and shining tracks— “Though, like a Peri cast from heaven, “I've lost, for ever lost, Almack's— “Though not a London Miss alive “Would now for her acquaintance own me; “And spinsters, ev'n, of forty-five, “Upon their honours ne'er have known me; “Here, here, at least, I triumph still, “And—spite of some few dandy Lancers, “Who vainly try to preach Quadrille— “See nought but true-blue Country Dancers. “Here still I reign, and, fresh in charms, “My throne, like Magna Charta, raise “'Mong sturdy, free-born legs and arms, “That scorn the threaten'd chaine Anglaise.” 'Twas thus she said, as 'mid the din Of footmen, and the town sedan, She lighted at the King's Head Inn, And up the stairs triumphant ran. The Squires and their Squiresses all, With young Squirinas, just come out, And my Lord's daughters from the Hall, (Quadrillers, in their hearts, no doubt,)— All these, as light she tripp'd up stairs, Were in the cloak-room seen assembling— When, hark! some new, outlandish airs, From the First Fiddle, set her trembling. She stops—she listens—can it be? Alas, in vain her ears would 'scape it— It is “Di tanti palpiti” As plain as English bow can scrape it. “Courage!” however—in she goes, With her best, sweeping country grace; When, ah too true, her worst of foes, Quadrille, there meets her, face to face. Oh for the lyre, or violin, Or kit of that gay Muse, Terpsichore, To sing the rage these nymphs were in, Their looks and language, airs and trickery. There stood Quadrille, with cat-like face (The beau-ideal of French beauty), A band-box thing, all art and lace Down from her nose-tip to her shoe-tye. Her flounces, fresh from Victorine— From Hippolyte, her rouge and hair— Her poetry, from Lamartine— Her morals, from—the Lord knows where. And, when she danc'd—so slidingly, So near the ground she plied her art, You'd swear her mother-earth and she Had made a compact ne'er to part. Her face too, all the while, sedate, No signs of life or motion showing, Like a bright pendule's dial-plate— So still, you'd hardly think 'twas going. Full fronting her stood Country Dance— A fresh, frank nymph, whom you would know For English, at a single glance— English all o'er, from top to toe. A little gauche, 'tis fair to own, And rather given to skips and bounces; Endangering thereby many a gown, And playing, oft, the dev'l with flounces. Unlike Mamselle—who would prefer (As morally a lesser ill) A thousand flaws of character, To one vile rumple of a frill. No rouge did She of Albion wear; Let her but run that two-heat race She calls a Set, not Dian e'er Came rosier from the woodland chase. Such was the nymph, whose soul had in't Such anger now—whose eyes of blue (Eyes of that bright, victorious tint, Which English maids call “Waterloo”)— Like summer lightnings, in the dusk Of a warm evening, flashing broke, While—to the tune of “Money Musk An old English Country Dance.,” Which struck up now—she proudly spoke— “Heard you that strain—that joyous strain? “'Twas such as England lov'd to hear, “Ere thou, and all thy frippery train, “Corrupted both her foot and ear— “Ere Waltz, that rake from foreign lands, “Presum'd, in sight of all beholders, “To lay his rude, licentious hands “On virtuous English backs and shoulders— “Ere times and morals both grew bad, “And, yet unfleec'd by funding blockheads, “Happy John Bull not only had, “But danc'd to, ‘Money in both pockets.’ “Alas, the change!—Oh, L?d?y, “Where is the land could 'scape disasters, “With such a Foreign Secretary, “Aided by Foreign Dancing Masters? “Woe to ye, men of ships and shops! “Rulers of day-books and of waves! “Quadrill'd, on one side, into fops, “And drill'd, on t'other, into slaves! “Ye, too, ye lovely victims, seen, “Like pigeons, truss'd for exhibition, “With elbows, à la crapaudine, “And feet, in—God knows what position; “Hemm'd in by watchful chaperons, “Inspectors of your airs and graces, “Who intercept all whisper'd tones, “And read your telegraphic faces; “Unable with the youth ador'd, “In that grim cordon of Mammas, “To interchange one tender word, “Though whisper'd but in queue-de-chats. “Ah did you know how blest we rang'd, “Ere vile Quadrille usurp'd the fiddle— “What looks in setting were exchang'd, “What tender words in down the middle; “How many a couple, like the wind, “Which nothing in its course controls, “Left time and chaperons far behind, “And gave a loose to legs and souls; “How matrimony throve—ere stopp'd “By this cold, silent, foot-coquetting— “How charmingly one's partner popp'd “The' important question in poussette-ing. “While now, alas—no sly advances— “No marriage hints—all goes on badly— “'Twixt Parson Malthus and French Dances, “We, girls, are at a discount sadly. “Sir William Scott (now Baron Stowell) “Declares not half so much is made “By Licences—and he must know well— “Since vile Quadrilling spoil'd the trade.” She ceas'd—tears fell from every Miss— She now had touch'd the true pathetic:— One such authentic fact as this, Is worth whole volumes theoretic. Instant the cry was “Country Dance!” And the maid saw, with brightening face, The Steward of the night advance, And lead her to her birthright place. The fiddles, which awhile had ceas'd, Now tun'd again their summons sweet, And, for one happy night, at least, Old England's triumph was complete. GAZEL. Haste, Maami, the spring is nigh; Already, in the' unopen'd flowers That sleep around us, Fancy's eye Can see the blush of future bowers; And joy it brings to thee and me, My own beloved Maami! The streamlet frozen on its way, To feed the marble Founts of Kings, Now, loosen'd by the vernal ray, Upon its path exulting springs— As doth this bounding heart to thee, My ever blissful Maami! Such bright hours were not made to stay; Enough if they a while remain, Like Irem's bowers, that fade away, From time to time, and come again. And life shall all one Irem be For us, my gentle Maami. O haste, for this impatient heart, Is like the rose in Yemen's vale, That rends its inmost leaves apart With passion for the nightingale; So languishes this soul for thee, My bright and blushing Maami! LINES ON THE DEATH OF JOSEPH ATKINSON, ESQ. OF DUBLIN. If ever life was prosperously cast, If ever life was like the lengthen'd flow Of some sweet music, sweetness to the last, 'Twas his who, mourn'd by many, sleeps below. The sunny temper, bright where all is strife, The simple heart above all worldly wiles; Light wit that plays along the calm of life, And stirs its languid surface into smiles; Pure charity, that comes not in a shower, Sudden and loud, oppressing what it feeds, But, like the dew, with gradual silent power, Felt in the bloom it leaves along the meads; The happy grateful spirit, that improves And brightens every gift by fortune given; That, wander where it will with those it loves, Makes every place a home, and home a heaven: All these were his.—Oh, thou who read'st this stone, When for thyself, thy children, to the sky Thou humbly prayest, ask this boon alone, That ye like him may live, like him may die! GENIUS AND CRITICISM. Scripsit quidem fata, sed sequitur. Seneca. Of old, the Sultan Genius reign'd, As Nature meant, supreme, alone; With mind uncheck'd, and hands unchain'd, His views, his conquests were his own. But power like his, that digs its grave With its own sceptre, could not last; So Genius' self became the slave Of laws that Genius' self had pass'd. As Jove, who forg'd the chain of Fate, Was, ever after, doom'd to wear it; His nods, his struggles all too late— “Qui semel jussit, semper paret.” To check young Genius' proud career, The slaves, who now his throne invaded, Made Criticism his prime Vizir, And from that hour his glories faded. Tied down in Legislation's school, Afraid of even his own ambition, His very victories were by rule, And he was great but by permission. His most heroic deeds—the same, That dazzled, when spontaneous actions— Now, done by law, seem'd cold and tame, And shorn of all their first attractions. If he but stirr'd to take the air, Instant, the Vizir's Council sat— “Good Lord, your Highness can't go there— “Bless me, your Highness can't do that.” If, loving pomp, he chose to buy Rich jewels for his diadem, “The taste was bad, the price was high— “A flower were simpler than a gem.” To please them if he took to flowers— “What trifling, what unmeaning things! “Fit for a woman's toilet hours, “But not at all the style for Kings.” If, fond of his domestic sphere, He play'd no more the rambling comet— “A dull, good sort of man, 'twas clear, “But, as for great or brave, far from it.” Did he then look o'er distant oceans, For realms more worthy to enthrone him?— “Saint Aristotle, what wild notions! “Serve a ‘ne exeat regno’ on him.” At length, their last and worst to do, They round him plac'd a guard of watchmen, Reviewers, knaves in brown, or blue Turn'd up with yellow—chiefly Scotchmen; To dog his footsteps all about, Like those in Longwood's prison grounds, Who at Napoleon's heels rode out, For fear the Conqueror should break bounds. Oh for some Champion of his power, Some Ultra spirit, to set free, As erst in Shakspeare's sovereign hour, The thunders of his Royalty!— To vindicate his ancient line, The first, the true, the only one, Of Right eternal and divine, That rules beneath the blessed sun. TO LADY J?R??Y, ON BEING ASKED TO WRITE SOMETHING IN HER ALBUM. Written at Middleton. Oh albums, albums, how I dread Your everlasting scrap and scrawl! How often wish that from the dead, Old Omar would pop forth his head, And make a bonfire of you all! So might I 'scape the spinster band, The blushless blues, who, day and night, Like duns in doorways, take their stand, To waylay bards, with book in hand, Crying for ever, “Write, sir, write!” So might I shun the shame and pain, That o'er me at this instant come, When Beauty, seeking Wit in vain, Knocks at the portal of my brain, And gets, for answer, “Not at home!” November, 1828. TO THE SAME. ON LOOKING THROUGH HER ALBUM. No wonder bards, both high and low, From Byron down to ????? and me, Should seek the fame, which all bestow On him whose task is praising thee. Let but the theme be J?r??y's eyes, At once all errors are forgiven; As ev'n old Sternhold still we prize, Because, though dull, he sings of heaven. SATIRICAL AND HUMOROUS POEMS. The following trifles, having enjoyed, in their circulation through the newspapers, all the celebrity and length of life to which they were entitled, would have been suffered to pass quietly into oblivion without pretending to any further distinction, had they not already been published, in a collective form, both in London and Paris, and, in each case, been mixed up with a number of other productions, to which, whatever may be their merit, the author of the following pages has no claim. A natural desire to separate his own property, worthless as it is, from that of others, is, he begs to say, the chief motive of the publication of this volume. TO SIR HUDSON LOWE. Effare causam nominis, Utrumne mores hoc tui Nomen dedere, an nomen hoc Secuta morum regula. Ausonius. 1816. Sir Hudson Lowe, Sir Hudson Low, (By name, and ah! by nature so) As thou art fond of persecutions, Perhaps thou'st read, or heard repeated, How Captain Gulliver was treated, When thrown among the Lilliputians. They tied him down—these little men did— And having valiantly ascended Upon the Mighty Man's protuberance, They did so strut!—upon my soul, It must have been extremely droll To see their pigmy pride's exuberance! And how the doughty mannikins Amus'd themselves with sticking pins And needles in the great man's breeches: And how some very little things, That pass'd for Lords, on scaffoldings Got up, and worried him with speeches. Alas, alas! that it should happen To mighty men to be caught napping!— Though different, too, these persecutions; For Gulliver, there, took the nap, While, here, the Nap, oh sad mishap, Is taken by the Lilliputians! AMATORY COLLOQUY BETWEEN BANK AND GOVERNMENT. 1826. Bank. Is all then forgotten? those amorous pranks You and I, in our youth, my dear Government, play'd; When you call'd me the fondest, the truest of Banks, And enjoy'd the endearing advances I made! When left to ourselves, unmolested and free, To do all that a dashing young couple should do, A law against paying was laid upon me, But none against owing, dear helpmate, on you. And is it then vanish'd?—that “hour (as Othello So happily calls it) of Love and Direction?” ? “An hour Of love, of worldly matter and direction.” And must we, like other fond doves, my dear fellow, Grow good in our old age, and cut the connexion? Government. Even so, my belov'd Mrs. Bank, it must be; This paying in cash plays the devil with wooing It appears, however, that Ovid was a friend to the resumption of payment in specie:— ? “finem, specie cæleste resumtâ, Luctibus imposuit, venitque salutifer urbi.” Met. l. 15. v. 743.: We've both had our swing, but I plainly foresee There must soon be a stop to our bill-ing and cooing. Propagation in reason—a small child or two— Even Reverend Malthus himself is a friend to; The issue of some folks is mod'rate and few— But ours, my dear corporate Bank, there's no end to! So—hard though it be on a pair, who've already Disposed of so many pounds, shillings, and pence; And, in spite of that pink of prosperity, Freddy Honourable Frederick R?b?ns?n., So lavish of cash and so sparing of sense— The day is at hand, my Papyria So called, to distinguish her from the “Aurea” or Golden Venus. Venus, When—high as we once us'd to carry our capers— Those soft billet-doux we're now passing between us, Will serve but to keep Mrs. Coutts in curl-papers: And when—if we still must continue our love, (After all that has pass'd)—our amour, it is clear, Like that which Miss Danäe manag'd with Jove, Must all be transacted in bullion, my dear! February, 1826. DIALOGUE BETWEEN A SOVEREIGN AND A ONE POUND NOTE. “O ego non felix, quam tu fugis, ut pavet acres Agna lupos, capreæque leones.” Hor. Said a Sovereign to a Note, In the pocket of my coat, Where they met in a neat purse of leather, “How happens it, I prithee, “That, though I'm wedded with thee, “Fair Pound, we can never live together? “Like your sex, fond of change, “With Silver you can range, “And of lots of young sixpences be mother; “While with me—upon my word, “Not my Lady and my Lord “Of W?stm?th see so little of each other!” The indignant Note replied (Lying crumpled by his side), “Shame, shame, it is yourself that roam, Sir— “One cannot look askance, “But, whip! you're off to France, “Leaving nothing but old rags at home, Sir. “Your scampering began “From the moment Parson Van, “Poor man, made us one in Love's fetter; “‘For better or for worse’ “Is the usual marriage curse, “But ours is all ‘worse’ and no ‘better.’ “In vain are laws pass'd, “There's nothing holds you fast, “Tho' you know, sweet Sovereign, I adore you— “At the smallest hint in life, “You forsake your lawful wife, “As other Sovereigns did before you. “I flirt with Silver, true— “But what can ladies do, “When disown'd by their natural protectors? “And as to falsehood, stuff! “I shall soon be false enough, “When I get among those wicked Bank Directors.” The Sovereign, smiling on her, Now swore, upon his honour, To be henceforth domestic and loyal; But, within an hour or two, Why—I sold him to a Jew, And he's now at No. 10. Palais Royal. AN EXPOSTULATION TO LORD KING. “Quem das finem, Rex magne, laborum?” Virgil. 1826. How can you, my Lord, thus delight to torment all The Peers of the realm about cheapening their corn See the proceedings of the Lords, Wednesday, March 1. 1826, when Lord King was severely reproved by several of the noble Peers, for making so many speeches against the Corn Laws., When you know, if one hasn't a very high rental, 'Tis hardly worth while being very high born? Why bore them so rudely, each night of your life, On a question, my Lord, there's so much to abhor in? A question—like asking one, “How is your wife?”— At once so confounded domestic and foreign. As to weavers, no matter how poorly they feast; But Peers, and such animals, fed up for show, (Like the well-physick'd elephant, lately deceas'd,) Take a wonderful quantum of cramming, you know. You might see, my dear Baron, how bor'd and distrest Were their high noble hearts by your merciless tale, When the force of the agony wrung ev'n a jest From the frugal Scotch wit of my Lord L?d?d?le! This noble Earl said, that “when he heard the petition came from ladies' boot and shoemakers, he thought it must be against the ‘corns’ which they inflicted on the fair sex.” Bright Peer! to whom Nature and Berwickshire gave A humour, endow'd with effects so provoking, That, when the whole House looks unusually grave, You may always conclude that Lord L?d?d?le's joking! And then, those unfortunate weavers of Perth— Not to know the vast difference Providence dooms Between weavers of Perth and Peers of high birth, 'Twixt those who have heir-looms, and those who've but looms! “To talk now of starving!”—as great Ath?l said The Duke of Athol said, that “at a former period, when these weavers were in great distress, the landed interest of Perth had supported 1500 of them. It was a poor return for these very men now to petition against the persons who had fed them.”— (And the nobles all cheer'd, and the bishops all wonder'd,) “When, some years ago, he and others had fed Of these same hungry devils about fifteen hundred!” It follows from hence—and the Duke's very words Should be publish'd wherever poor rogues of this craft are— That weavers, once rescued from starving by Lords, Are bound to be starved by said Lords ever after. When Rome was uproarious, her knowing patricians Made “Bread and the Circus” a cure for each row; But not so the plan of our noble physicians, “No Bread and the Tread-mill's” the regimen now. So cease, my dear Baron of Ockham, your prose, As I shall my poetry—neither convinces; And all we have spoken and written but shows, When you tread on a nobleman's corn An improvement, we flatter ourselves, on Lord L.'s joke., how he winces. THE SINKING FUND CRIED. “Now what, we ask, is become of this Sinking Fund—these eight millions of surplus above expenditure, which were to reduce the interest of the national debt by the amount of four hundred thousand pounds annually? Where, indeed, is the Sinking Fund itself?” —The Times. Take your bell, take your bell, Good Crier, and tell To the Bulls and the Bears, till their ears are stunn'd, That, lost or stolen, Or fall'n through a hole in The Treasury floor, is the Sinking Fund! O yes! O yes! Can any body guess What the deuce has become of this Treasury wonder? It has Pitt's name on't, All brass, in the front, And R?b?ns?n's, scrawl'd with a goose-quill, under. Folks well knew what Would soon be its lot, When Frederick and Jenky set hob-nobbing In 1824, when the Sinking Fund was raised by the imposition of new taxes to the sum of five millions., And said to each other, “Suppose, dear brother, “We make this funny old Fund worth robbing.” We are come, alas! To a very pretty pass— Eight Hundred Millions of score, to pay, With but Five in the till, To discharge the bill, And even that Five, too, whipp'd away! Stop thief! stop thief!— From the Sub to the Chief, These Gemmen of Finance are plundering cattle— Call the watch—call Brougham, Tell Joseph Hume, That best of Charleys, to spring his rattle. Whoever will bring This aforesaid thing To the well-known House of Bobinson and Jenkin, Shall be paid, with thanks, In the notes of banks, Whose Funds have all learn'd “the Art of Sinking.” O yes! O yes! Can any body guess What the dev'l has become of this Treasury wonder? It has Pitt's name on't, All brass, in the front, And R?b?ns?n's, scrawl'd with a goose-quill, under. ODE TO THE GODDESS CERES. BY SIR TH?M?S L?THBR?E. “Legiferæ Cereri Phœboque.” Virgil. Dear Goddess of Corn, whom the ancients, we know, (Among other odd whims of those comical bodies,) Adorn'd with somniferous poppies, to show Thou wert always a true Country-gentleman's Goddess. Behold, in his best shooting-jacket, before thee, An eloquent 'Squire, who most humbly beseeches, Great Queen of Mark-lane (if the thing doesn't bore thee), Thou'lt read o'er the last of his—never-last speeches. Ah! Ceres, thou know't not the slander and scorn Now heap'd upon England's 'Squirearchy, so boasted; Improving on Hunt, A sort of “breakfast-powder,” composed of roasted corn, was about this time introduced by Mr. Hunt, as a substitute for coffee. 'tis no longer the Corn, 'Tis the growers of Corn that are now, alas! roasted. In speeches, in books, in all shapes they attack us— Reviewers, economists—fellows, no doubt, That you, my dear Ceres, and Venus, and Bacchus, And Gods of high fashion know little about. There's B?nth?m, whose English is all his own making,— Who thinks just as little of settling a nation As he would of smoking his pipe, or of taking (What he, himself, calls) his “post-prandial vibration.” The venerable Jeremy's phrase for his after-dinner walk. There are two Mr. M?lls, too, whom those that love reading Through all that's unreadable, call very clever;— And, whereas M?ll Senior makes war on good breeding, M?ll Junior makes war on all breeding whatever! In short, my dear Goddess, Old England's divided Between ultra blockheads and superfine sages;— With which of these classes we, landlords, have sided Thou'lt find in my Speech, if thou'lt read a few pages. For therein I've prov'd, to my own satisfaction, And that of all 'Squires I've the honour of meeting, That 'tis the most senseless and foul-mouth'd detraction To say that poor people are fond of cheap eating. On the contrary, such the “chaste notions A phrase in one of Sir T?m?s's last speeches.” of food That dwell in each pale manufacturer's heart, They would scorn any law, be it ever so good, That would make thee, dear Goddess, less dear than thou art! And, oh! for Monopoly what a blest day, When the Land and the Silk Great efforts were, at that time, making for the exclusion of foreign silk. shall, in fond combination, (Like Sulky and Silky, that pair in the play “Road to Ruin.”,) Cry out, with one voice, for High Rents and Starvation! Long life to the Minister!—no matter who, Or how dull he may be, if, with dignified spirit, he Keeps the ports shut—and the people's mouths, too— We shall all have a long run of Freddy's prosperity. And, as for myself, who've, like Hannibal, sworn To hate the whole crew who would take our rents from us, Had England but One to stand by thee, Dear Corn, That last, honest Uni-Corn This is meant not so much for a pun, as in allusion to the natural history of the Unicorn, which is supposed to be something between the Bos and the Asinus, and, as Rees's Cyclopædia assures us, has a particular liking for every thing “chaste.” would be Sir Th?m?s! A HYMN OF WELCOME AFTER THE RECESS. “Animas sapientiores fieri quiescendo.” And now—cross-buns and pancakes o'er— Hail, Lords and Gentlemen, once more! Thrice hail and welcome, Houses Twain! The short eclipse of April-Day Having (God grant it!) pass'd away, Collective Wisdom, shine again! Come, Ayes and Noes, through thick and thin,— With Paddy H?lmes for whipper-in,— Whate'er the job, prepar'd to back it; Come, voters of Supplies—bestowers Of jackets upon trumpet-blowers, At eighty mortal pounds the jacket! An item of expense which Mr. Hume in vain endeavoured to get rid of:—trumpeters, it appears, like the men of All-Souls, must be “bene vestiti.” Come—free, at length, from Joint-Stock cares— Ye Senators of many Shares, Whose dreams of premium knew no boundary; So fond of aught like Company, That you would even have taken tea (Had you been ask'd) with Mr. Goundry. The gentleman, lately before the public, who kept his Joint-Stock Tea Company all to himself, singing “Te solo adoro.” Come, matchless country-gentlemen; Come, wise Sir Thomas—wisest then, When creeds and corn-laws are debated; Come, rival ev'n the Harlot Red, And show how wholly into bread A 'Squire is transubstantiated. Come, L?derd?e, and tell the world, That—surely as thy scratch is curl'd, As never scratch was curl'd before— Cheap eating does more harm than good, And working-people, spoil'd by food, The less they eat, will work the more. Come, G?lb?rn, with thy glib defence (Which thou'dst have made for Peter's Pence) Of Church-Rates, worthy of a halter; Two pipes of port (old port, 'twas said By honest Newport Sir John Newport.) bought and paid By Papists for the Orange Altar! This charge of two pipes of port for the sacramental wine is a precious specimen of the sort of rates levied upon their Catholic fellow-parishioners by the Irish Protestants. “The thirst that from the soul doth rise Doth ask a drink divine.” Come, H?rt?n, with thy plan, so merry, For peopling Canada from Kerry— Not so much rendering Ireland quiet, As grafting on the dull Canadians That liveliest of earth's contagions, The bull-pock of Hibernian riot! Come all, in short, ye wond'rous men Of wit and wisdom, come again; Though short your absence, all deplore it— Oh, come and show, whate'er men say, That you can, after April-Day, Be just as—sapient as before it. MEMORABILIA OF LAST WEEK. MONDAY, MARCH 13. 1826. The Budget—quite charming and witty—no hearing, For plaudits and laughs, the good things that were in it;— Great comfort to find, though the Speech isn't cheering, That all its gay auditors were, every minute. What, still more prosperity!—mercy upon us, “This boy'll be the death of me”—oft as, already, Such smooth Budgeteers have genteelly undone us, For Ruin made easy there's no one like Freddy. TUESDAY. Much grave apprehension express'd by the Peers, Lest—calling to life the old Peachums and Lockitts— The large stock of gold we're to have in three years, Should all find its way into highwaymen's pockets!! “Another objection to a metallic currency was, that it produced a greater number of highway robberies.” —Debate in the Lords. WEDNESDAY. Little doing—for sacred, oh Wednesday, thou art To the seven-o'-clock joys of full many a table— When the Members all meet, to make much of that part, With which they so rashly fell out, in the Fable. It appear'd, though, to-night, that—as church-wardens, yearly, Eat up a small baby—those cormorant sinners, The Bankrupt-Commisioners, bolt very nearly A mod'rate-siz'd bankrupt, tout chaud, for their dinners! Mr. Abercromby's statement of the enormous tavern bills of the Commissioners of Bankrupts. Nota bene—a rumour to-day, in the City, “Mr. R?b?ns?n just has resign'd”—what a pity! The Bulls and the Bears all fell a sobbing, When they heard of the fate of poor Cock Robin; While thus, to the nursery tune, so pretty, A murmuring Stock-dove breath'd her ditty:— Alas, poor Robin, he crow'd as long And as sweet as a prosperous Cock could crow; But his note was small, and the gold-finch's song Was a pitch too high for Robin to go. Who'll make his shroud? “I,” said the Bank, “though he play'd me a prank, “While I have a rag, poor Rob shall be roll'd in't, “With many a pound I'll paper him round, “Like a plump rouleau—without the gold in't.‘ ALL IN THE FAMILY WAY. A NEW PASTORAL BALLAD. (SUNG IN THE CHARACTER OF BRITANNIA.) “The Public Debt is due from ourselves to ourselves, and resolves itself into a Family Account.” —Sir Robert Peel's Letter. Tune—My banks are all furnish'd with bees. My banks are all furnish'd with rags, So thick, even Freddy can't thin 'em; I've torn up my old money-bags, Having little or nought to put in 'em. My tradesmen are smashing by dozens, But this is all nothing, they say; For bankrupts, since Adam, are cousins,— So, it's all in the family way. My Debt not a penny takes from me, As sages the matter explain;— Bob owes it to Tom, and then Tommy Just owes it to Bob back again. Since all have thus taken to owing, There's nobody left that can pay; And this is the way to keep going,— All quite in the family way. My senators vote away millions, To put in Prosperity's budget; And though it were billions or trillions, The generous rogues wouldn't grudge it. 'Tis all but a family hop, 'Twas Pitt began dancing the hay; Hands round!—why the deuce should we stop? 'Tis all in the family way. My labourers used to eat mutton, As any great man of the State does; And now the poor devils are put on Small rations of tea and potatoes. But cheer up, John, Sawney, and Paddy, The King is your father, they say; So, ev'n if you starve for your Daddy, 'Tis all in the family way. My rich manufacturers tumble, My poor ones have nothing to chew; And, ev'n if themselves do not grumble, Their stomachs undoubtedly do. But coolly to fast en famille, Is as good for the soul as to pray; And famine itself is genteel, When one starves in a family way. I have found out a secret for Freddy, A secret for next Budget day; Though, perhaps, he may know it already, As he, too, 's a sage in his way. When next for the Treasury scene he Announces “the Devil to pay,” Let him write on the bills, “Nota bene, “'Tis all in the family way.” BALLAD FOR THE CAMBRIDGE ELECTION. “I authorized my Committee to take the step which they did, of proposing a fair comparison of strength, upon the understanding that whichever of the two should prove to be the weakest, should give way to the other.” —Extract from Mr. W. J. B?kes's Letter to Mr. G?lb?n. B?kes is weak, and G?lb?n too, No one e'er the fact denied;— Which is “weakest” of the two, Cambridge can alone decide. Choose between them, Cambridge, pray, Which is weakest, Cambridge, say. G?lb?n of the Pope afraid is, B?kes, as much afraid as he; Never yet did two old ladies On this point so well agree. Choose between them, Cambridge, pray, Which is weakest, Cambridge, say. Each a different mode pursues, Each the same conclusion reaches; B?kes is foolish in Reviews, G?lb?n, foolish in his speeches. Choose between them, Cambridge, pray, Which is weakest, Cambridge, say. Each a different foe doth damn, When his own affairs have gone ill; B?kes he damneth Buckingham, G?lb?n damneth Dan O'Connell. Choose between them, Cambridge, pray, Which is weakest, Cambridge, say. Once, we know, a horse's neigh Fix'd the' election to a throne So, whichever first shall bray, Choose him, Cambridge, for thy own. Choose him, choose him by his bray, Thus elect him, Cambridge, pray. June, 1826. MR. ROGER DODSWORTH. 1826. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,—Having just heard of the wonderful resurrection of Mr. Roger Dodsworth from under an avalanche, where he had remained, bien frappé, it seems, for the last 166 years, I hasten to impart to you a few reflections on the subject.—Yours, &amp;c. Laudator Temporis Acti. What a lucky turn-up!—just as Eld?n's withdrawing, To find thus a gentleman, froz'n in the year Sixteen hundred and sixty, who only wants thawing, To serve for our times quite as well as the Peer;— To bring thus to light, not the Wisdom alone Of our Ancestors, such as 'tis found on our shelves, But, in perfect condition, full-wigg'd and full-grown, To shovel up one of those wise bucks themselves! Oh thaw Mr. Dodsworth, and send him safe home— Let him learn nothing useful or new on the way; With his wisdom kept snug from the light let him come, And our Tories will hail him with “Hear!” and “Hurra!” What a God-send to them!—a good, obsolete man, Who has never of Locke or Voltaire been a reader;— Oh thaw Mr. Dodsworth as fast as you can, And the L?nsd?les and H?rtf?rds shall choose him for leader. Yes, Sleeper of Ages, thou shalt be their chosen; And deeply with thee will they sorrow, good men, To think that all Europe has, since thou wert frozen, So alter'd, thou hardly wilt know it again. And Eld?n will weep o'er each sad innovation Such oceans of tears, thou wilt fancy that he Has been also laid up in a long congelation, And is only now thawing, dear Roger, like thee. COPY OF AN INTERCEPTED DESPATCH. FROM HIS EXCELLENCY DON STREPITOSO DIABOLO, ENVOY EXTRAORDINARY TO HIS SATANIC MAJESTY. St. James's Street, July 1. 1826. Great Sir, having just had the good luck to catch An official young Demon, preparing to go, Ready booted and spurr'd, with a black-leg despatch From the Hell here, at Cr?ckf?rd's, to our Hell, below— I write these few lines to your Highness Satanic, To say that, first having obey'd your directions, And done all the mischief I could in “the Panic,” My next special care was to help the Elections. Well knowing how dear were those times to thy soul, When ev'ry good Christian tormented his brother, And caus'd, in thy realm, such a saving of coal, From all coming down, ready grill'd by each other; Rememb'ring, besides, how it pain'd thee to part With the Old Penal Code—that chef-d'œuvre of Law, In which (though to own it too modest thou art) We could plainly perceive the fine touch of thy claw; It thought, as we ne'er can those good times revive, (Though Eld?n, with help from your Highness would try,) 'Twould still keep a taste for Hell's music alive, Could we get up a thund'ring No-Popery cry;— That yell which, when chorus'd by laics and clerics, So like is to ours, in its spirit and tone, That I often nigh laugh myself into hysterics, To think that Religion should make it her own. So, having sent down for the' original notes Of the chorus, as sung by your Majesty's choir, With a few pints of lava, to gargle the throats Of myself and some others, who sing it “with fire Con fuoco—a music-book direction.,” Thought I, “if the Marseillois Hymn could command “Such audience, though yell'd by a Sans-culotte crew, “What wonders shall we do, who've men in our band, “That not only wear breeches, but petticoats too.” Such then were my hopes; but, with sorrow, your Highness, I'm forc'd to confess—be the cause what it will, Whether fewness of voices, or hoarseness, or shyness,— Our Beelzebub Chorus has gone off but ill. The truth is, no placeman now knows his right key, The Treasury pitch-pipe of late is so various; And certain base voices, that look'd for a fee At the York music-meeting, now think it precarious. Even some of our Reverends might have been warmer,— Though one or two capital roarers we've had; Doctor Wise This reverend gentleman distinguished himself at the Reading election. is, for instance, a charming performer, And Huntingdon Maberley's yell was not bad! Altogether, however, the thing was not hearty;— Even Eld?n allows we got on but so so; And when next we attempt a No-Popery party, We must, please your Highness, recruit from below. But, hark, the young Black-leg is cracking his whip— Excuse me, Great Sir—there's no time to be civil;— The next opportunity shan't be let slip, But, till then, I'm, in haste, your most dutiful Devil. July, 1826. THE MILLENNIUM. SUGGESTED BY THE LATE WORK OF THE REVEREND MR. IRV?NG “ON PROPHECY.” 1826. A Millennium at hand!—I'm delighted to hear it— As matters, both public and private, now go, With multitudes round us all starving, or near it, A good, rich Millennium will come à-propos. Only think, Master Fred, what delight to behold, Instead of thy bankrupt old City of Rags, A bran-new Jerusalem, built all of gold, Sound bullion throughout, from the roof to the flags— A City, where wine and cheap corn “A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny.” —Rev. vi. shall abound— A celestial Cocaigne, on whose buttery shelves We may swear the best things of this world will be found, As your Saints seldom fail to take care of themselves! Thanks, reverend expounder of raptures Elysian See the oration of this reverend gentleman, where he describes the connubial joys of Paradise, and paints the angels hovering round “each happy fair.”, Divine Squintifobus, who, plac'd within reach Of two opposite worlds, by a twist of your vision, Can cast, at the same time, a sly look at each;— Thanks, thanks for the hope thou affordest, that we May, ev'n in our own times, a Jubilee share, Which so long has been promis'd by prophets like thee, And so often postpon'd, we began to despair. There was Whiston When Whiston presented to Prince Eugene the Essay in which he attempted to connect his victories over the Turks with Revelation, the Prince is said to have replied, that “he was not aware he had ever had the honour of being known to St. John.”, who learnedly took Prince Eugene For the man who must bring the Millennium about; There's Faber, whose pious productions have been All belied, ere his book's first edition was out;— There was Counsellor Dobbs, too, an Irish M. P., Who discours'd on the subject with signal éclât, And, each day of his life, sat expecting to see A Millennium break out in the town of Armagh! Mr. Dobbs was a member of the Irish Parliament, and, on all other subjects but the Millennium, a very sensible person: he chose Armagh as the scene of his Millennium, on account of the name Armageddon, mentioned in Revelation. There was also—but why should I burden my lay With your Brotherses, Southcotes, and names less deserving, When all past Millenniums henceforth must give way To the last new Millennium of Orator Irv?ng. Go on, mighty man,—doom them all to the shelf,— And when next thou with Prophecy troublest thy sconce, Oh forget not, I pray thee, to prove that thyself Art the Beast (Chapter iv.) that sees nine ways at once. THE THREE DOCTORS. Doctoribus lætamur tribus. 1826. Though many great Doctors there be, There are three that all Doctors out-top, Doctor Eady, that famous M. D., Doctor S?th?y, and dear Doctor Slop. The editor of the Morning Herald, so nick-named. The purger—the proser—the bard— All quacks in a different style; Doctor S?th?y writes books by the yard, Doctor Eady writes puffs by the mile! Alluding to the display of this doctor's name, in chalk, on all the walls round the metropolis. Doctor Slop, in no merit outdone By his scribbling or physicking brother, Can dose us with stuff like the one, Ay, and doze us with stuff like the other. Doctor Eady good company keeps With “No Popery” scribes, on the walls; Doctor S?th?y as gloriously sleeps With “No Popery” scribes, on the stalls. Doctor Slop, upon subjects divine, Such bedlamite slaver lets drop, That, if Eady should take the mad line, He'll be sure of a patient in Slop. Seven millions of Papists, no less, Doctor S?th?y attacks, like a Turk This seraphic doctor, in the preface to his last work (Vindiciæ Ecclesiæ Anglicanæ), is pleased to anathematize not only all Catholics, but all advocates of Catholics:—“They have for their immediate allies (he says) every faction that is banded against the State, every demagogue, every irreligious and seditious journalist, every open and every insidious enemy to Monarchy and to Christianity.”; Doctor Eady, less bold, I confess, Attacks but his maid-of-all-work. See the late accounts in the newspapers of the appearance of this gentleman at one of the Police-offices, in consequence of an alleged assault on his “maid-of-all-work.” Doctor S?th?y, for his grand attack, Both a laureate and pensioner is; While poor Doctor Eady, alack, Has been had up to Bow-street, for his! And truly, the law does so blunder, That, though little blood has been spilt, he May probably suffer as, under The Chalking Act, known to be guilty. So much for the merits sublime (With whose catalogue ne'er should I stop) Of the three greatest lights of our time, Doctor Eady, and S?th?y, and Slop! Should you ask me, to which of the three Great Doctors the pref'rence should fall, As a matter of course, I agree Doctor Eady must go to the wall. But as S?th?y with laurels is crown'd, And Slop with a wig and a tail is, Let Eady's bright temples be bound With a swingeing “Corona Muralis!” A crown granted as a reward among the Romans to persons who performed any extraordinary exploits upon walls, such as scaling them, battering them, &amp;c.—No doubt, writing upon them, to the extent Dr. Eady does, would equally establish a claim to the honour. EPITAPH ON A TUFT-HUNTER. Lament, lament, Sir Isaac Heard, Put mourning round thy page, Debrett, For here lies one, who ne'er preferr'd A Viscount to a Marquis yet. Beside him place the God of Wit, Before him Beauty's rosiest girls, Apollo for a star he'd quit, And Love's own sister for an Earl's. Did niggard fate no peers afford, He took, of course, to peers' relations; And, rather than not sport a Lord, Put up with ev'n the last creations. Ev'n Irish names, could he but tag 'em With “Lord” and “Duke,” were sweet to call; And, at a pinch, Lord Ballyraggum Was better than no Lord at all. Heav'n grant him now some noble nook, For, rest his soul! he'd rather be Genteelly damn'd beside a Duke, Than sav'd in vulgar company. ODE TO A HAT. ? “altum Ædificat caput.” Juvenal. 1826. Hail, reverend Hat!—sublime 'mid all The minor felts that round thee grovel;— Thou, that the Gods “a Delta” call, While meaner mortals call thee “shovel.” When on thy shape (like pyramid, Cut horizontally in two) So described by a Reverend Historian of the Church:— “A Delta hat, like the horizontal section of a pyramid.”— Grant's History of the English Church. I raptur'd gaze, what dreams, unbid, Of stalls and mitres bless my view! That brim of brims, so sleekly good— Not flapp'd, like dull Wesleyans', down, But looking (as all churchmen's should) Devoutly upward—tow'rds the crown. Gods! when I gaze upon that brim, So redolent of Church all over, What swarms of Tithes, in vision dim,— Some pig-tail'd, some like cherubim, With ducklings' wings—around it hover! Tenths of all dead and living things, That Nature into being brings, From calves and corn to chitterlings. Say, holy Hat, that hast, of cocks, The very cock most orthodox, To which, of all the well-fed throng Of Zion, Archbishop Magee affectionately calls the Church Establishment of Ireland “the little Zion.”, joy'st thou to belong? Thou'rt not Sir Harcourt Lees's—no— For hats grow like the heads that wear 'em; And hats, on heads like his, would grow Particularly harum-scarum. Who knows but thou may'st deck the pate Of that fam'd Doctor Ad?mth?te, (The reverend rat, whom we saw stand On his hind-legs in Westmoreland,) Who chang'd so quick from blue to yellow, And would from yellow back to blue, And back again, convenient fellow, If 'twere his interest so to do. Or, haply, smartest of triangles, Thou art the hat of Doctor Ow?n; The hat that, to his vestry wrangles, That venerable priest doth go in,— And, then and there, amid the stare Of all St. Olave's, takes the chair, And quotes, with phiz right orthodox, The' example of his reverend brothers, To prove that priests all fleece their flocks, And he must fleece as well as others. Blest Hat! (whoe'er thy lord may be) Thus low I take off mine to thee, The homage of a layman's castor, To the spruce delta of his pastor. Oh may'st thou be, as thou proceedest, Still smarter cock'd, still brush'd the brighter, Till, bowing all the way, thou leadest Thy sleek possessor to a mitre! NEWS FOR COUNTRY COUSINS. 1826. Dear Coz, as I know neither you nor Miss Draper, When Parliament's up, ever take in a paper, But trust for your news to such stray odds and ends As you chance to pick up from political friends—. Being one of this well-inform'd class, I sit down To transmit you the last newest news that's in town. As to Greece and Lord Cochrane, things couldn't look better— His Lordship (who promises now to fight faster) Has just taken Rhodes, and despatch'd off a letter To Daniel O'Connell, to make him Grand Master; Engaging to change the old name, if he can, From the Knights of St. John to the Knights of St. Dan;— Or, if Dan should prefer (as a still better whim) Being made the Colossus, 'tis all one to him. From Russia the last accounts are that the Czar— Most gen'rous and kind, as all sovereigns are, And whose first princely act (as you know, I suppose) Was to give away all his late brother's old clothes A distribution was made of the Emperor Alexander's military wardrobe by his successor.— Is now busy collecting, with brotherly care, The late Emperor's nightcaps, and thinks of bestowing One nightcap apiece (if he has them to spare) On all the distinguish'd old ladies now going. (While I write, an arrival from Riga—the ‘Brothers’— Having nightcaps on board for Lord Eld—n and others.) Last advices from India—Sir Archy, 'tis thought, Was near catching a Tartar (the first ever caught In N. Lat. 21.)—and his Highness Burmese, Being very hard press'd to shell out the rupees, And not having rhino sufficient, they say, meant To pawn his august Golden Foot This potentate styles himself the Monarch of the Golden Foot. for the payment. (How lucky for monarchs, that thus, when they choose, Can establish a running account with the Jews!) The security being what Rothschild calls “goot,” A loan will be shortly, of course, set on foot; The parties are Rothschild, A. Baring and Co. With three other great pawnbrokers: each takes a toe, And engages (lest Gold-foot should give us leg-bail, As he did once before) to pay down on the nail. This is all for the present—what vile pens and paper! Yours truly, dear Cousin—best love to Miss Draper. September, 1826. A VISION. BY THE AUTHOR OF CHRISTABEL. “Up!” said the Spirit, and, ere I could pray One hasty orison, whirl'd me away To a Limbo, lying—I wist not where— Above or below, in earth or air; For it glimmer'd o'er with a doubtful light, One couldn't say whether 'twas day or night; And 'twas crost by many a mazy track, One didn't know how to get on or back; And I felt like a needle that's going astray (With its one eye out) through a bundle of hay; When the Spirit he grinn'd, and whisper'd me, “Thou'rt now in the Court of Chancery!” Around me flitted unnumber'd swarms Of shapeless, bodiless, tailless forms; (Like bottled-up babes, that grace the room Of that worthy knight, Sir Everard Home)— All of them, things half-kill'd in rearing; Some were lame—some wanted hearing; Some had through half a century run, Though they hadn't a leg to stand upon. Others, more merry, as just beginning, Around on a point of law were spinning; Or balanc'd aloft, 'twixt Bill and Answer, Lead at each end, like a tight-rope dancer. Some were so cross, that nothing could please 'em;— Some gulp'd down affidavits to ease 'em;— All were in motion, yet never a one, Let it move as it might, could ever move on. “These,” said the Spirit, “you plainly see, “Are what they call suits in Chancery!” I heard a loud screaming of old and young, Like a chorus by fifty Vellutis sung; Or an Irish Dump (“the words by Moore”) At an amateur concert scream'd in score;— So harsh on my ear that wailing fell Of the wretches who in this Limbo dwell! It seem'd like the dismal symphony Of the shapes Æneas in hell did see; Or those frogs, whose legs a barbarous cook Cut off, and left the frogs in the brook, To cry all night, till life's last dregs, “Give us our legs!—give us our legs!” Touch'd with the sad and sorrowful scene, I ask'd what all this yell might mean, When the Spirit replied, with a grin of glee, “'Tis the cry of the Suitors in Chancery!” I look'd, and I saw a wizard rise, The Lord Chancellor Eld?n. With a wig like a cloud before men's eyes. In his aged hand he held a wand, Wherewith he beckon'd his embryo band, And they mov'd and mov'd, as he wav'd it o'er, But they never got on one inch the more. And still they kept limping to and fro, Like Ariels round old Prospero— Saying, “Dear Master, let us go,” But still old Prospero answer'd “No.” And I heard, the while, that wizard elf Muttering, muttering spells to himself, While o'er as many old papers he turn'd, As Hume e'er mov'd for, or Omar burn'd. He talk'd of his virtue—“though some, less nice, (He own'd with a sigh) preferr'd his Vice”— And he said, “I think”—“I doubt”—“I hope,” Call'd God to witness, and damn'd the Pope; With many more sleights of tongue and hand I couldn't, for the soul of me, understand. Amaz'd and pos'd, I was just about To ask his name, when the screams without, The merciless clack of the imps within, And that conjuror's mutterings, made such a din, That, startled, I woke—leap'd up in my bed— Found the Spirit, the imps, and the conjuror fled, And bless'd my stars, right pleas'd to see, That I wasn't, as yet, in Chancery. THE PETITION OF THE ORANGEMEN OF IRELAND. 1826. To the people of England, the humble Petition Of Ireland's disconsolate Orangemen, showing— That sad, very sad, is our present condition;— Our jobbing all gone, and our noble selves going;— That, forming one seventh, within a few fractions, Of Ireland's seven millions of hot heads and hearts, We hold it the basest of all base transactions To keep us from murd'ring the other six parts;— That, as to laws made for the good of the many, We humbly suggest there is nothing less true; As all human laws (and our own, more than any) Are made by and for a particular few;— That much it delights ev'ry true Orange brother, To see you, in England, such ardour evince, In discussing which sect most tormented the other, And burn'd with most gusto, some hundred years since;— That we love to behold, while old England grows faint, Messrs. Southey and Butler nigh coming to blows, To decide whether Dunstan, that strong-bodied Saint, Ever truly and really pull'd the Dev'l's nose; Whether t'other Saint, Dominic, burnt the Dev'l's paw— Whether Edwy intrigued with Elgiva's old mother— To such important discussions as these the greater part of Dr. Southey's Vindiciæ Ecclesiæ Anglicanæ is devoted. And many such points, from which Southey can draw Conclusions most apt for our hating each other. That 'tis very well known this devout Irish nation Has now, for some ages, gone happily on, Believing in two kinds of Substantiation, One party in Trans and the other in Con Consubstantiation—the true Reformed belief; at least, the belief of Luther, and, as Mosheim asserts, of Melancthon also.; That we, your petitioning Cons, have, in right Of the said monosyllable, ravag'd the lands, And embezzled the goods, and annoy'd, day and night, Both the bodies and souls of the sticklers for Trans;— That we trust to Peel, Eldon, and other such sages, For keeping us still in the same state of mind; Pretty much as the world us'd to be in those ages, When still smaller syllables madden'd mankind;— When the words ex and per When John of Ragusa went to Constantinople (at the time this dispute between “ex” and “per” was going on), he found the Turks, we are told, “laughing at the Christians for being divided by two such insignificant particles.” serv'd as well, to annoy One's neighbours and friends with, as con and trans now; And Christians, like S?th?y, who stickled for oi, Cut the throats of all Christians who stickled for ou. The Arian controversy.—Before that time, says Hooker, “in order to be a sound believing Christian, men were not curious what syllables or particles of speech they used.” That, relying on England, whose kindness already So often has help'd us to play this game o'er, We have got our red coats and our carabines ready, And wait but the word to show sport, as before. That, as to the expense—the few millions, or so, Which for all such diversions John Bull has to pay— 'Tis, at least, a great comfort to John Bull to know, That to Orangemen's pockets 'twill all find its way. For which your petitioners ever will pray, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. COTTON AND CORN. A DIALOGUE. Said Cotton to Corn, t'other day, As they met and exchang'd a salute— (Squire Corn in his carriage so gay, Poor Cotton, half famish'd, on foot): “Great Squire, if it isn't uncivil “To hint at starvation before you, “Look down on a poor hungry devil, “And give him some bread, I implore you!” Quoth Corn then, in answer to Cotton, Perceiving he meant to make free— “Low fellow, you've surely forgotten “The distance between you and me! “To expect that we, Peers of high birth, “Should waste our illustrious acres, “For no other purpose on earth “Than to fatten curst calico-makers!— “That Bishops to bobbins should bend— “Should stoop from their Bench's sublimity, “Great dealers in lawn, to befriend “Such contemptible dealers in dimity! “No—vile Manufacture! ne'er harbour “A hope to be fed at our boards;— “Base offspring of Arkwright the barber, “What claim canst thou have upon Lords? “No—thanks to the taxes and debt, “And the triumph of paper o'er guineas, “Our race of Lord Jemmys, as yet, “May defy your whole rabble of Jennys!” So saying—whip, crack, and away Went Corn in his chaise through the throng, So headlong, I heard them all say, “Squire Corn would be down, before long.” THE CANONIZATION OF SAINT B?TT?RW?RTH. “A Christian of the best edition.” Rabelais. Canonize him!—yea, verily, we'll canonize him; Though Cant is his hobby, and meddling his bliss, Though sages may pity, and wits may despise him, He'll ne'er make a bit the worse Saint for all this. Descend, all ye Spirits, that ever yet spread The dominion of Humbug o'er land and o'er sea, Descend on our B?tt?rw?rth's biblical head, Thrice-Great, Bibliopolist, Saint, and M. P. Come, shade of Joanna, come down from thy sphere, And bring little Shiloh—if 'tisn't too far— Such a sight will to B?tt?rw?rth's bosom be dear, His conceptions and thine being much on a par. Nor blush, Saint Joanna, once more to behold A world thou hast honour'd by cheating so many; Thou'lt find still among us one Personage old, Who also by tricks and the Seals A great part of the income of Joanna Southcott arose from the Seals of the Lord's protection which she sold to her followers. makes a penny. Thou, too, of the Shakers, divine Mother Lee! Mrs. Anne Lee, the “chosen vessel” of the Shakers, and “Mother of all the children of regeneration.” Thy smiles to beatified B?tt?rw?rth deign; Two “lights of the Gentiles” are thou, Anne, and he, One hallowing Fleet Street, and t'other Toad Lane! Toad Lane, in Manchester, where Mother Lee was born. In her “Address to Young Believers,” she says, that “it is a matter of no importance with them from whence the means of their deliverance come, whether from a stable in Bethlehem, or from Toad Lane, Manchester.” The Heathen, we know, made their Gods out of wood, And Saints may be fram'd of as handy materials;— Old women and B?tt?rw?rths make just as good As any the Pope ever book'd as Ethereals. Stand forth, Man of Bibles!—not Mahomet's pigeon, When, perch'd on the Koran, he dropp'd there, they say, Strong marks of his faith, ever shed o'er religion Such glory as B?tt?rw?rth sheds every day. Great Galen of souls, with what vigour he crams Down Erin's idolatrous throats, till they crack again, Bolus on bolus, good man!—and then damns Both their stomachs and souls, if they dare cast them back again. How well might his shop—as a type representing The creed of himself and his sanctified clan— On its counter exhibit “the Art of Tormenting,” Bound neatly, and letter'd “Whole Duty of Man!” Canonize him!—by Judas, we will canonize him; For Cant is his hobby, and twaddling his bliss; And, though wise men may pity and wits may despise him, He'll make but the better shop-saint for all this. Call quickly together the whole tribe of Canters, Convoke all the serious Tag-rag of the nation; Bring Shakers and Snufflers and Jumpers and Ranters, To witness their B?tt?rw?rth's Canonization! Yea, humbly I've ventur'd his merits to paint, Yea, feebly have tried all his gifts to portray; And they form a sum-total for making a Saint, That the Devil's own Advocate could not gainsay. Jump high, all ye Jumpers, ye Ranters all roar, While B?tt?rw?rth's spirit, uprais'd from your eyes, Like a kite made of foolscap, in glory shall soar, With a long tail of rubbish behind, to the skies! AN INCANTATION. SUNG BY THE BUBBLE SPIRIT. Air.— Come with me, and we will go Where the rocks of coral grow. Come with me, and we will blow Lots of bubbles, as we go; Bubbles, bright as ever Hope Drew from fancy—or from soap; Bright as e'er the South Sea sent From its frothy element! Come with me, and we will blow Lots of bubbles, as we go. Mix the lather, Johnny W?lks, Thou, who rhym'st so well to bilks Strong indications of character may be sometimes traced in the rhymes to names. Marvell thought so, when he wrote “Sir Edward Sutton, The foolish Knight who rhymes to mutton.”; Mix the lather—who can be Fitter for such task than thee, Great M. P. for Sudsbury! Now the frothy charm is ripe, Puffing Peter The Member, during a long period, for Coventry., bring thy pipe,— Thou, whom ancient Coventry Once so dearly lov'd, that she Knew not which to her was sweeter, Peeping Tom or Puffing Peter;— Puff the bubbles high in air, Puff thy best to keep them there. Bravo, bravo, Peter M—re! Now the rainbow humbugs An humble imitation of one of our modern poets, who, in a poem against War, after describing the splendid habiliments of the soldier, thus apostrophizes him—“thou rainbow ruffian!” soar, Glittering all with golden hues, Such as haunt the dreams of Jews;— Some, reflecting mines that lie Under Chili's glowing sky, Some, those virgin pearls that sleep Cloister'd in the southern deep; Others, as if lent a ray From the streaming Milky Way, Glistening o'er with curds and whey From the cows of Alderney. Now's the moment—who shall first Catch the bubbles, ere they burst? Run, ye Squires, ye Viscounts, run, Br?gd?n, T?ynh?m, P?lm?t?n;— John W?lks junior runs beside ye! Take the good the knaves provide ye! Take the good the Gods provide thee.” See, with upturn'd eyes and hands, Where the Shareman So called by a sort of Tuscan dulcification of the ch, in the word “Chairman.“, Br?gd?n, stands, Gaping for the froth to fall Down his gullet—lye and all. See!— But, hark, my time is out— Now, like some great water-spout, Scatter'd by the cannon's thunder, Burst, ye bubbles, all asunder! [Here the stage darkens—a discordant crash is heard from the orchestra—the broken bubbles descend in a saponaceous but uncleanly mist over the heads of the Dramatis Personæ, and the scene drops, leaving the bubble-hunters—all in the suds.] A DREAM OF TURTLE. BY SIR W. CURTIS. 1826. 'Twas evening time, in the twilight sweet I sail'd along, when—whom should I meet But a Turtle journeying o'er the sea, “On the service of his Majesty.” We are told that the passport of this grand diplomatic Turtle (sent by the Secretary for Foreign Affairs to a certain noble envoy) described him as “on his majesty's service.” ? dapibus supremi Grata testudo Jovis. When spying him first through twilight dim, I didn't know what to make of him; But said to myself, as slow he plied His fins, and roll'd from side to side Conceitedly o'er the watery path— “'Tis my Lord of St?w?ll taking a bath, “And I hear him now, among the fishes, “Quoting Vatel and Burgersdicius!” But, no—'twas, indeed, a Turtle, wide And plump as ever these eyes descried; A Turtle, juicy as ever yet Glu'd up the lips of a Baronet! And much did it grieve my soul to see That an animal of such dignity, Like an absentee abroad should roam, When he ought to stay and be ate at home. But now “a change came o'er my dream,” Like the magic lantern's shifting slider;— I look'd, and saw, by the evening beam, On the back of that Turtle sat a rider— A goodly man, with an eye so merry, I knew 'twas our Foreign Secretary Mr. Canning., Who there, at his ease, did sit and smile, Like Waterton on his crocodile Wanderings in South America. “It was the first and last time (says Mr. Waterton) I was ever on a crocodile's back.”; Cracking such jokes, at every motion, As made the Turtle squeak with glee, And own they gave him a lively notion Of what his forc'd-meat balls would be. So, on the Sec. in his glory went, Over that briny element, Waving his hand, as he took farewell, With graceful air, and bidding me tell Inquiring friends that the Turtle and he Were gone on a foreign embassy— To soften the heart of a Diplomate, Who is known to doat upon verdant fat, And to let admiring Europe see, That calipash and calipee Are the English forms of Diplomacy. THE DONKY AND HIS PANNIERS. A FABLE. ? “fessus jam sudat asellus, “Parce illi; vestrum delicium est asinus.” Virgil. Copa. A Donky, whose talent for burdens was wond'rous, So much that you'd swear he rejoic'd in a load, One day had to jog under panniers so pond'rous, That—down the poor Donky fell smack on the road! His owners and drivers stood round in amaze— What! Neddy, the patient, the prosperous Neddy, So easy to drive, through the dirtiest ways, For every description of job-work so ready! One driver (whom Ned might have “hail'd” as a “brother” Alluding to an early poem of Mr. Coleridge's, addressed to an Ass, and beginning, “I hail thee, brother!”) Had just been proclaiming his Donky's renown For vigour, for spirit, for one thing or other— When, lo, 'mid his praises, the Donky came down! But, how to upraise him?—one shouts, t'other whistles, While Jenky, the Conjurer, wisest of all, Declared that an “over-production of thistles— A certain country gentleman having said in the House, “that we must return at last to the food of our ancestors,” somebody asked Mr. T. “what food the gentleman meant?” —“Thistles, I suppose,” answered Mr. T. (Here Ned gave a stare)—was the cause of his fall.” Another wise Solomon cries, as he passes— “There, let him alone, and the fit will soon cease; “The beast has been fighting with other jack-asses, “And this is his mode of ‘transition to peace.’” Some look'd at his hoofs, and, with learned grimaces, Pronounc'd that too long without shoes he had gone— “Let the blacksmith provide him a sound metal basis (The wise-acres said), “and he's sure to jog on.” Meanwhile, the poor Neddy, in torture and fear, Lay under his panniers, scarce able to groan; And—what was still dolefuller—lending an ear To advisers, whose ears were a match for his own. At length, a plain rustic, whose wit went so far As to see others' folly, roar'd out, as he pass'd— “Quick—off with the panniers, all dolts as ye are, “Or your prosperous Neddy will soon kick his last!” October, 1826. ODE TO THE SUBLIME PORTE. 1826. Great Sultan, how wise are thy state compositions! And oh, above all, I admire that Decree, In which thou command'st, that all she politicians Shall forthwith be strangled and cast in the sea. 'Tis my fortune to know a lean Benthamite spinster— A maid, who her faith in old Jeremy puts; Who talks, with a lisp, of “the last new Westminster,” And hopes you're delighted with “Mill upon Gluts;” Who tells you how clever one Mr. Fun-blank is, How charming his Articles 'gainst the Nobility;— And assures you that even a gentleman's rank is, In Jeremy's school, of no sort of utility. To see her, ye Gods, a new Number perusing— Art. 1.—“On the Needle's variations,” by Pl?e A celebrated political tailor.; Art. 2.—By her fav'rite Fun-blank This pains-taking gentleman has been at the trouble of counting, with the assistance of Cocker, the number of metaphors in Moore's “Life of Sheridan,” and has found them to amount, as nearly as possible, to 2235—and some fractions.—“so amusing! “Dear man! he makes Poetry quite a Law case.” Art. 3.—“Upon Fallacies,” Jeremy's own— (Chief Fallacy being, his hope to find readers);— Art. 4.—“Upon Honesty,” author unknown;— Art. 5.—(by the young Mr. M?) “Hints to Breeders.” Oh, Sultan, oh, Sultan, though oft for the bag And the bowstring, like thee, I am tempted to call— Though drowning's too good for each blue-stocking hag, I would bag this she Benthamite first of them all! And, lest she should ever again lift her head From the watery bottom, her clack to renew— As a clog, as a sinker, far better than lead, I would hang round her neck her own darling Review. CORN AND CATHOLICS. Utrum horum Dirius borum? Incerti Auctoris. What! still those two infernal questions, That with our meals, our slumbers mix— That spoil our tempers and digestions— Eternal Corn and Catholics! Gods! were there ever two such bores? Nothing else talk'd of night or morn— Nothing in doors, or out of doors, But endless Catholics and Corn! Never was such a brace of pests— While Ministers, still worse than either, Skill'd but in feathering their nests, Plague us with both, and settle neither. So addled in my cranium meet Popery and Corn, that oft I doubt, Whether, this year, 'twas bonded Wheat, Or bonded Papists, they let out. Here, landlords, here, polemics nail you, Arm'd with all rubbish they can rake up; Prices and Texts at once assail you— From Daniel these, and those from Jacob. Author of the late Report on Foreign Corn. And when you sleep, with head still torn Between the two, their shapes you mix, Till sometimes Catholics seem Corn— Then Corn again seems Catholics. Now, Dantsic wheat before you floats— Now, Jesuits from California— Now Ceres, link'd with Titus Oats, Comes dancing through the “Porta Cornea.” The Horn Gate, through which the ancients supposed all true dreams (such as those of the Popish Plot, &amp;c.) to pass. Oft, too, the Corn grows animate, And a whole crop of heads appears, Like Papists, bearding Church and State— Themselves, together by the ears! In short, these torments never cease; And oft I wish myself transferr'd off To some far, lonely land of peace, Where Corn or Papists ne'er were heard of. Yes, waft me, Parry, to the Pole; For—if my fate is to be chosen 'Twixt bores and icebergs—on my soul, I'd rather, of the two, be frozen! A CASE OF LIBEL. “The greater the truth, the worse the libel.” A certain Sprite, who dwells below, ('Twere a libel, perhaps, to mention where,) Came up incog., some years ago, To try, for a change, the London air. So well he look'd, and dress'd, and talk'd, And hid his tail and horns so handy, You'd hardly have known him as he walk'd, From C?e, or any other Dandy. (His horns, it seems, are made t'unscrew; So, he has but to take them out of the socket, And—just as some fine husbands do— Conveniently clap them into his pocket.) In short, he look'd extremely natty, And ev'n contriv'd—to his own great wonder— By dint of sundry scents from Gattie, To keep the sulphurous hogo under. And so my gentleman hoof'd about, Unknown to all but a chosen few At White's and Crockford's, where, no doubt, He had many post-obits falling due. Alike a gamester and a wit, At night he was seen with Crockford's crew, At morn with learned dames would sit— So pass'd his time 'twixt black and blue. Some wish'd to make him an M. P., But, finding W?lks was also one, he Swore, in a rage, “he'd be d?d, if he “Would ever sit in one house with Johnny.” At length, as secrets travel fast, And devils, whether he or she, Are sure to be found out at last, The affair got wind most rapidly. The Press, the impartial Press, that snubs Alike a fiend's or an angel's capers— Miss Paton's soon as Beelzebub's— Fir'd off a squib in the morning papers: “We warn good men to keep aloof “From a grim old Dandy, seen about, “With a fire-proof wig, and a cloven hoof “Through a neat-cut Hoby smoking out.” Now,—the Devil being a gentleman, Who piques himself on well-bred dealings,— You may guess, when o'er these lines he ran, How much they hurt and shock'd his feelings. Away he posts to a Man of Law, And 'twould make you laugh could you have seen 'em, As paw shook hand, and hand shook paw, And 'twas “hail, good fellow, well met,” between 'em. Straight an indictment was preferr'd— And much the Devil enjoy'd the jest, When, asking about the Bench, he heard That, of all the Judges, his own was Best. A celebrated Judge, so named. In vain Defendant proffer'd proof That Plaintiff's self was the Father of Evil— Brought Hoby forth, to swear to the hoof, And Stultz to speak to the tail of the Devil. The Jury (saints, all snug and rich, And readers of virtuous Sunday papers) Found for the Plaintiff—on hearing which The Devil gave one of his loftiest capers. For oh, 'twas nuts to the Father of Lies (As this wily fiend is nam'd in the Bible) To find it settled by laws so wise, That the greater the truth, the worse the libel! LITERARY ADVERTISEMENT. Wanted—Authors of all-work, to job for the season, No matter which party, so faithful to neither; Good hacks, who, if pos'd for a rhyme or a reason, Can manage, like ??????, to do without either. If in gaol, all the better for out-o'-door topics; Your gaol is for Trav'llers a charming retreat; They can take a day's rule for a trip to the Tropics, And sail round the world, at their ease, in the Fleet. For a Dramatist, too, the most useful of schools— He can study high life in the King's Bench community; Aristotle could scarce keep him more within rules, And of place he, at least, must adhere to the unity. Any lady or gentleman, come to an age To have good “Reminiscences” (three-score or higher), Will meet with encouragement—so much, per page, And the spelling and grammar both found by the buyer. No matter with what their remembrance is stock'd, So they'll only remember the quantum desir'd;— Enough to fill handsomely Two Volumes, oct., Price twenty-four shillings, is all that's requir'd. They may treat us, like Kelly, with old jeu-d'esprits, Like Dibdin, may tell of each farcical frolic; Or kindly inform us, like Madame Genlis This lady also favours us, in her Memoirs, with the address of those apothecaries, who have, from time to time, given her pills that agreed with her; always desiring that the pills should be ordered “comme pour elle.”, That gingerbread-cakes always give them the colic. Wanted, also, a new stock of Pamphlets on Corn, By “Farmers” and “Landholders”—(worthies whose lands Enclos'd all in bow-pots, their attics adorn, Or, whose share of the soil may be seen on their hands). No-Popery Sermons, in ever so dull a vein, Sure of a market;—should they, too, who pen 'em, Be renegade Papists, like Murtagh O'S?ll?v?n A gentleman, who distinguished himself by his evidence before the Irish Committees., Something extra allow'd for the' additional venom Funds, Physic, Corn, Poetry, Boxing, Romance, All excellent subjects for turning a penny;— To write upon all is an author's sole chance For attaining, at last, the least knowledge of any. Nine times out of ten, if his title is good, The material within of small consequence is;— Let him only write fine, and, if not understood, Why—that's the concern of the reader, not his. Nota Bene—an Essay, now printing, to show, That Horace (as clearly as words could express it) Was for taxing the Fund-holders, ages ago, When he wrote thus—“Quodcunque in Fund is, assess it.” According to the common reading, “quodcunque infundis, acescit.” THE IRISH SLAVE. Written on the death of the Duke of York. 1827. I heard, as I lay, a wailing sound, “He is dead—he is dead,” the rumour flew; And I rais'd my chain, and turn'd me round, And ask'd, through the dungeon-window, “Who?” I saw my livid tormentors pass; Their grief 'twas bliss to hear and see! For, never came joy to them, alas, That didn't bring deadly bane to me. Eager I look'd through the mist of night, And ask'd, “What foe of my race hath died? “Is it he—that Doubter of law and right, “Whom nothing but wrong could e'er decide— “Who, long as he sees but wealth to win, “Hath never yet felt a qualm or doubt “What suitors for justice he'd keep in, “Or what suitors for freedom he'd shut out— “Who, a clog for ever on Truth's advance, “Hangs round her (like the Old Man of the Sea “Round Sinbad's neck “You fell, said they, into the hands of the Old Man of the Sea, and are the first who ever escaped strangling by his malicious tricks.” —Story of Sinbad.), nor leaves a chance “Of shaking him off—is't he? is't he?” Ghastly my grim tormentors smil'd, And thrusting me back to my den of woe, With a laughter even more fierce and wild Than their funeral howling, answer'd “No.” But the cry still pierc'd my prison-gate, And again I ask'd, “What scourge is gone? “Is it he—that Chief, so coldly great, “Whom Fame unwillingly shines upon— “Whose name is one of the' ill-omen'd words “They link with hate, on his native plains; “And why?—they lent him hearts and swords, “And he, in return, gave scoffs and chains! “Is it he? is it he?” I loud inquir'd, When, hark!—there sounded a Royal knell; And I knew what spirit had just expir'd, And, slave as I was, my triumph fell. He had pledg'd a hate unto me and mine, He had left to the future nor hope nor choice, But seal'd that hate with a Name Divine, And he now was dead, and—I couldn't rejoice! He had fann'd afresh the burning brands Of a bigotry waxing cold and dim; He had arm'd anew my torturers' hands, And them did I curse—but sigh'd for him. For, his was the error of head, not heart; And—oh, how beyond the ambush'd foe, Who to enmity adds the traitor's part, And carries a smile, with a curse below! If ever a heart made bright amends For the fatal fault of an erring head— Go, learn his fame from the lips of friends, In the orphan's tear be his glory read. A Prince without pride, a man without guile, To the last unchanging, warm, sincere, For Worth he had ever a hand and smile, And for Misery ever his purse and tear. Touch'd to the heart by that solemn toll, I calmly sunk in my chains again; While, still as I said “Heaven rest his soul!” My mates of the dungeon sigh'd “Amen!” January, 1827. ODE TO FERDINAND. 1827. Quit the sword, thou King of men, Grasp the needle once again; Making petticoats is far Safer sport than making war; Trimming is a better thing, Than the being trimm'd, oh King! Grasp the needle bright with which Thou didst for the Virgin stitch Garment, such as ne'er before Monarch stitch'd or Virgin wore. Not for her, oh semster nimble! Do I now invoke thy thimble; Not for her thy wanted aid is, But for certain grave old ladies, Who now sit in England's cabinet, Waiting to be clothed in tabinet, Or whatever choice étoffe is Fit for Dowagers in office. First, thy care, oh King, devote To Dame Eld?n's petticoat. Make it of that silk, whose dye Shifts for ever to the eye, Just as if it hardly knew Whether to be pink or blue. Or—material fitter yet— If thou could'st a remnant get Of that stuff, with which, of old, Sage Penelope, we're told, Still by doing and undoing, Kept her suitors always wooing— That's the stuff which I pronounce, is Fittest for Dame Eld?n's flounces. After this, we'll try thy hand, Mantua-making Ferdinand, For old Goody W?stm?l?d; One who loves, like Mother Cole, Church and State with all her soul; And has pass'd her life in frolics Worthy of your Apostolics. Choose, in dressing this old flirt, Something that wo'n't show the dirt, As, from habit, every minute Goody W?stm?l?d is in it. This is all I now shall ask, Hie thee, monarch, to thy task; Finish Eld?n's frills and borders, Then return for further orders. Oh what progress for our sake, Kings in millinery make! Ribands, garters, and such things, Are supplied by other Kings— Ferdinand his rank denotes By providing petticoats. HAT versus WIG. 1827. “At the interment of the Duke of York, Lord Eld?n, in order to guard against the effects of the damp, stood upon his hat during the whole of the ceremony.” ? metus omnes et inexorabile fatum Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari. 'Twixt Eld?n's Hat and Eld?n's Wig There lately rose an altercation,— Each with its own importance big, Disputing which most serves the nation. Quoth Wig, with consequential air, “Pooh! pooh! you surely can't design, “My worthy beaver, to compare “Your station in the state with mine. “Who meets the learned legal crew? “Who fronts the lordly Senate's pride? “The Wig, the Wig, my friend—while you “Hang dangling on some peg outside. “Oh, 'tis the Wig, that rules, like Love, “Senate and Court, with like éclat— “And wards below, and lords above, “For Law is Wig and Wig is Law! For Love is Heav'n and Heav'n is Love.”—Scott. “Who tried the long, Long W?ll?sl?y suit, “Which tried one's patience, in return? “Not thou, oh Hat!—though, could'st thou do't, “Of other brims “Brim—a naughty woman.” —Grose. than thine thou'dst learn. “'Twas mine our master's toil to share; “When, like ‘Truepenny,’ in the play “Ghost [beneath].—Swear! “Hamlet.—Ha, ha! say'st thou so? Art thou there, Truepenny? Come on.”, “He, every minute, cried out ‘Swear,’ “And merrily to swear went they His Lordship's demand for fresh affidavits was incessant.;— “When, loth poor W?ll?sl?y to condemn, he “With nice discrimination weigh'd, “Whether 'twas only ‘Hell and Jemmy,’ “Or ‘Hell and Tommy’ that he play'd. “No, no, my worthy beaver, no— “Though cheapen'd at the cheapest hatter's, “And smart enough, as beavers go, “Thou ne'er wert made for public matters.” Here Wig concluded his oration, Looking, as wigs do, wondrous wise; While thus, full cock'd for declamation, The veteran Hat enrag'd replies:— “Ha! dost thou then so soon forget “What thou, what England owes to me? “Ungrateful Wig!—when will a debt, “So deep, so vast, be owed to thee? “Think of that night, that fearful night, “When, through the steaming vault below, “Our master dar'd, in gout's despite, “To venture his podagric toe! “Who was it then, thou boaster, say, “When thou had'st to thy box sneak'd off, “Beneath his feet protecting lay, “And sav'd him from a mortal cough? “Think, if Catarrh had quench'd that sun, “How blank this world had been to thee! “Without that head to shine upon, “Oh Wig, where would thy glory be? “You, too, ye Britons,—had this hope “Of Church and state been ravish'd from ye, “Oh think, how Canning and the Pope “Would then have play'd up ‘Hell and Tommy!’ “At sea, there's but a plank, they say, “'Twixt seamen and annihilation; “A Hat, that awful moment, lay “'Twixt England and Emancipation! “Oh!!!—” At this “Oh!!!” The Times' Reporter Was taken poorly, and retir'd; Which made him cut Hat's rhetoric shorter, Than justice to the case requir'd. On his return, he found these shocks Of eloquence all ended quite; And Wig lay snoring in his box, And Hat was—hung up for the night. THE PERIWINKLES AND THE LOCUSTS. A SALMAGUNDIAN HYMN. “To Panurge was assigned the Lairdship of Salmagundi, which was yearly worth 6,789,106,789 ryals, besides the revenue of the Locusts and Periwinkles, amounting one year with another to the value of 2,435,768,” &amp;c. &amp;c. Rabelais. “Hurra! hurra!” I heard them say, And they cheer'd and shouted all the way, As the Laird of Salmagundi went, To open in state his Parliament. The Salmagundians once were rich, Or thought they were—no matter which— For, every year, the Revenue Accented as in Swift's line— “Not so a nation's revenues are paid.” From their Periwinkles larger grew; And their rulers, skill'd in all the trick And legerdemain of arithmetic, Knew how to place 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 and 10, Such various ways, behind, before, That they made a unit seem a score, And prov'd themselves most wealthy men! So, on they went, a prosperous crew, The people wise, the rulers clever— And God help those, like me and you, Who dar'd to doubt (as some now do) That the Periwinkle Revenue Would thus go flourishing on for ever. “Hurra! hurra!” I heard them say, And they cheer'd and shouted all the way, As the Great Panurge in glory went To open his own dear Parliament. But folks at length began to doubt What all this conjuring was about; For, every day, more deep in debt They saw their wealthy rulers get:— “Let's look (said they) the items through, “And see if what we're told be true “Of our Periwinkle Revenue.” But, lord! they found there wasn't a tittle Of truth in aught they heard before; For, they gain'd by Periwinkles little, And lost by Locusts ten times more! These Locusts are a lordly breed Some Salmagundians love to feed. Of all the beasts that ever were born, Your Locust most delights in corn; And, though his body be but small, To fatten him takes the dev'l and all! “Oh fie! oh fie!” was now the cry, As they saw the gaudy show go by, And the Laird of Salmagundi went To open his Locust Parliament! NEW CREATION OF PEERS. BATCH THE FIRST. “His 'prentice han’ He tried on man, And then he made the lasses.” 1827. “And now,” quoth the Minister, (eas'd of his panics, And ripe for each pastime the summer affords,) “Having had our full swing at destroying mechanics, “By way of set-off, let us make a few Lords. “'Tis pleasant—while nothing but mercantile fractures, “Some simple, some compound, is dinn'd in our ears— “To think that, though robb'd of all coarse manufactures, “We still have our fine manufacture of Peers;— “Those Gobelin productions, which Kings take a pride “In engrossing the whole fabrication and trade of; “Choice tapestry things, very grand on one side, “But showing, on t'other, what rags they are made of.” The plan being fix'd, raw material was sought,— No matter how middling, if Tory the creed be; And first, to begin with, Squire W?, 'twas thought, For a Lord was as raw a material as need be. Next came, with his penchant for painting and pelf, The tasteful Sir Charles Created Lord F?rnb?gh., so renown'd, far and near, For purchasing pictures, and selling himself— And both (as the public well knows) very dear. Beside him Sir John comes, with equal éclat, in;— Stand forth, chosen pair, while for titles we measure ye; Both connoisseur baronets, both fond of drawing, Sir John, after nature, Sir Charles, on the Treasury. But, bless us!—behold a new candidate come— In his hand he upholds a prescription, new written; He poiseth a pill-box 'twixt finger and thumb, And he asketh a seat 'mong the Peers of Great Britain!! “Forbid it,” cried Jenky, “ye Viscounts, ye Earls!— “Oh Rank, how thy glories would fall disenchanted, “If coronets glisten'd with pills 'stead of pearls, “And the strawberry-leaves were by rhubarb supplanted! “No—ask it not, ask it not, dear Doctor H?lf?rd— “If nought but a Peerage can gladden thy life, “And young Master H?lf?rd as yet is too small for't, “Sweet Doctor, we'll make a she Peer of thy wife. “Next to bearing a coronet on our own brows, “Is to bask in its light from the brows of another; “And grandeur o'er thee shall reflect from thy spouse, “As o'er V?y F?tz?d 'twill shine through his mother.” Among the persons mentioned as likely to be raised to the Peerage are the mother of Mr. V?y F?tz?d, &amp;c. Thus ended the First Batch—and Jenky, much tir'd (It being no joke to make Lords by the heap), Took a large dram of ether—the same that inspir'd His speech 'gainst the Papists—and pros'd off to sleep. SPEECH ON THE UMBRELLA A case which interested the public very much at this period. A gentleman, of the name of Bell, having left his umbrella behind him in the House of Lords, the doorkeepers (standing, no doubt, on the privileges of that noble body) refused to restore it to him; and the above speech, which may be considered as a pendant to that of the Learned Earl on the Catholic Question, arose out of the transaction. QUESTION. BY LORD ELD?N. “Vos inumbrelles video.” From Mr. Canning's translation of Jekyl's— “I say, my good fellows, As you've no umbrellas.” —Ex Juvenil. Georgii Canningii. 1827. My Lords, I'm accus'd of a trick that, God knows, is The last into which, at my age, I could fall— Of leading this grave House of Peers, by their noses, Wherever I choose, princes, bishops, and all. My Lords, on the question before us at present, No doubt I shall hear, “'Tis that cursed old fellow, “That bugbear of all that is lib'ral and pleasant, “Who wo'n't let the Lords give the man his umbrella!” God forbid that your Lordships should knuckle to me; I am ancient—but were I as old as King Priam, Not much, I confess, to your credit 'twould be, To mind such a twaddling old Trojan as I am. I own, of our Protestant laws I am jealous. And, long as God spares me, will always maintain, That, once having taken men's rights, or umbrellas, We ne'er should consent to restore them again. What security have you, ye Bishops and Peers, If thus you give back Mr. Bell's parapluie, That he mayn't, with its stick, come about all your ears, And then—where would your Protestant periwigs be? No, heav'n be my judge, were I dying to-day, Ere I dropp'd in the grave, like a medlar that's mellow, “For God's sake”—at that awful moment I'd say— “For God's sake, don't give Mr. Bell his umbrella.” [“This address,” says a ministerial journal, “delivered with amazing emphasis and earnestness, occasioned an extraordinary sensation in the House. Nothing since the memorable address of the Duke of York has produced so remarkable an impression.”] A PASTORAL BALLAD. BY JOHN BULL. Dublin, March 12. 1827.—Friday, after the arrival of the packet bringing the account of the defeat of the Catholic Question, in the House of Commons, orders were sent to the Pigeon House to forward 5,000,000 rounds of musket-ball cartridge to the different garrisons round the country. —Freeman's Journal. I have found out a gift for my Erin, A gift that will surely content her;— Sweet pledge of a love so endearing! Five millions of bullets I've sent her. She ask'd me for Freedom and Right, But ill she her wants understood;— Ball cartridges, morning and night, Is a dose that will do her more good. There is hardly a day of our lives But we read, in some amiable trials, How husbands make love to their wives Through the medium of hemp and of phials. One thinks, with his mistress or mate A good halter is sure to agree— That love-knot which, early and late, I have tried, my dear Erin, on thee. While another, whom Hymen has bless'd With a wife that is not over placid, Consigns the dear charmer to rest, With a dose of the best Prussic acid. Thus, Erin! my love do I show— Thus quiet thee, mate of my bed! And, as poison and hemp are too slow, Do thy business with bullets instead. Should thy faith in my medicine be shaken, Ask R?d?n, that mildest of saints; He'll tell thee, lead, inwardly taken, Alone can remove thy complaints;— That, blest as thou art in thy lot, Nothing's wanted to make it more pleasant But being hang'd, tortur'd, and shot, Much oft'ner than thou art at present. Even W?ll?t?n's self hath averr'd Thou art yet but half sabred and hung, And I lov'd him the more when I heard Such tenderness fall from his tongue. So take the five millions of pills, Dear partner, I herewith inclose; 'Tis the cure that all quacks for thy ills, From Cromwell to Eld?n, propose. And you, ye brave bullets that go, How I wish that, before you set out, The Devil of the Freischutz could know The good work you are going about. For he'd charm ye, in spite of your lead, Into such supernatural wit, That you'd all of you know, as you sped, Where a bullet of sense ought to hit. A LATE SCENE AT SWANAGE A small bathing-place on the coast of Dorsetshire, long a favourite summer resort of the ex-nobleman in question, and, till this season, much frequented also by gentlemen of the church. Regnis ex-sul ademtis. Virg. 1827. To Swanage—that neat little town, in whose bay Fair Thetis shows off, in her best silver slippers— Lord Bags The Lord Chancellor Eld?n. took his annual trip t'other day, To taste the sea breezes, and chat with the dippers. There—learn'd as he is in conundrums and laws— Quoth he to his dame (whom he oft plays the wag on), “Why are chancery suitors like bathers?”—“Because Their suits are put off, till—they haven't a rag on.” Thus on he went chatting—but, lo, while he chats, With a face full of wonder around him he looks; For he misses his parsons, his dear shovel hats, Who used to flock round him at Swanage like rooks. “How is this, Lady Bags?—to this region aquatic “Last year they came swarming, to make me their bow, “As thick as Burke's cloud o'er the vales of Carnatic, “Deans, Rectors, D. D.'s—where the dev'l are they now?” “My dearest Lord Bags!” saith his dame, “can you doubt? “I am loth to remind you of things so unpleasant; “But don't you perceive, dear, the Church have found out “That you're one of the people call'd Ex's, at present?” “Ah, true—you have hit it—I am, indeed, one “Of those ill-fated Ex's (his Lordship replies), “And, with tears, I confess—God forgive me the pun!— “We X's have proved ourselves not to be Y's.” WO! WO! Suggested by a speech of the Bishop of Ch?st?r on the subject of the New Reformation in Ireland, in which his Lordship denounced “Wo! Wo! Wo!” pretty abundantly on all those who dared to interfere with its progress. Wo, wo unto him who would check or disturb it— That beautiful Light, which is now on its way; Which, beaming, at first, o'er the bogs of Belturbet, Now brightens sweet Ballinafad with its ray! Oh F?rnh?m, Saint F?rnh?m, how much do we owe thee! How form'd to all tastes are thy various employs! The old, as a catcher of Catholics, know thee, The young, as an amateur scourger of boys. Wo, wo to the man, who such doings would smother!— On, Luther of Cavan! On, Saint of Kilgroggy! With whip in one hand, and with Bible in 'tother, Like Mungo's tormentor, both “preachee and floggee.” Come, Saints from all quarters, and marshal his way; Come, L?rt?n, who, scorning profane erudition, Popp'd Shakspeare, they say, in the river, one day, Though 'twas only old Bowdler's Velluti edition. Come, R?den, who doubtest—so mild are thy views— Whether Bibles or bullets are best for the nation; Who leav'st to poor Paddy no medium to choose, 'Twixt good old Rebellion and new Reformation. What more from her Saints can Hibernia require? St. Bridget, of yore, like a dutiful daughter, Supplied her, 'tis said, with perpetual fire The inextinguishable fire of St. Bridget, at Kildare., And Saints keep her, now, in eternal hot water. Wo, wo to the man, who would check their career, Or stop the Millennium, that's sure to await us, When, bless'd with an orthodox crop every year, We shall learn to raise Protestants, fast as potatoes. In kidnapping Papists, our rulers, we know, Had been trying their talent for many a day; Till F?rnh?m, when all had been tried, came to show, Like the German flea-catcher, “anoder goot way.” And nothing's more simple than F?rnh?m's receipt;— “Catch your Catholic, first—soak him well in poteen Whiskey.— “Add salary sauce “We understand that several applications have lately been made to the Protestant clergymen of this town by fellows, inquiring ‘What are they giving a head for converts?’” —Wexford Post., and the thing is complete. “You may serve up your Protestant, smoking and clean.” “Wo, wo to the wag, who would laugh at such cookery!” Thus, from his perch, did I hear a black crow Of the rook species—Corvus frugilegus, i. e. a great consumer of corn. Caw angrily out, while the rest of the rookery Open'd their bills, and re-echo'd “Wo! wo!” TOUT POUR LA TRIPE. “If, in China or among the natives of India, we claimed civil advantages which were connected with religious usages, little as we might value those forms in our hearts, we should think common decency required us to abstain from treating them with offensive contumely; and, though unable to consider them sacred, we would not sneer at the name of Fot, or laugh at the imputed divinity of Visthnou.” —Courier, Tuesday, Jan. 16. 1827. Come, take my advice, never trouble your cranium, When “civil advantages” are to be gain'd, What god or what goddess may help to obtain you 'em, Hindoo or Chinese, so they're only obtain'd. In this world (let me hint in your organ auricular) All the good things to good hypocrites fall; And he, who in swallowing creeds is particular, Soon will have nothing to swallow at all. Oh place me where Fo (or, as some call him, Fot) Is the god, from whom “civil advantages” flow, And you'll find, if there's any thing snug to be got, I shall soon be on excellent terms with old Fo. Or were I where Vishnu, that four-handed god, Is the quadruple giver of pensions and places, I own I should feel it unchristian and odd Not to find myself also in Vishnu's good graces. For, among all the gods that humanely attend To our wants in this planet, the gods to my wishes Are those that, like Vishnu and others, descend In the form, so attractive, of loaves and of fishes! Vishnu was (as Sir W. Jones calls him) “a pisciform god,” —his first Avatar being in the shape of a fish. So take my advice—for, if even the devil Should tempt men again as an idol to try him, 'Twere best for us Tories, even then, to be civil, As nobody doubts we should get something by him. ENIGMA. Monstrum nulla virtute redemptum. Come, riddle-me-ree, come, riddle-me-ree, And tell me what my name may be. I am nearly one hundred and thirty years old, And therefore no chicken, as you may suppose;— Though a dwarf in my youth (as my nurses have told), I have, ev'ry year since, been outgrowing my clothes; Till, at last, such a corpulent giant I stand, That, if folks were to furnish me now with a suit, It would take ev'ry morsel of scrip in the land But to measure my bulk from the head to the foot. Hence, they who maintain me, grown sick of my stature, To cover me nothing but rags will supply; And the doctors declare that, in due course of nature, About the year 30 in rags I shall die. Meanwhile, I stalk hungry and bloated around, An object of int'rest, most painful, to all; In the warehouse, the cottage, the palace I'm found, Holding citizen, peasant, and king in my thrall. Then riddle-me-ree, oh riddle-me-ree, Come, tell me what my name may be. When the lord of the counting-house bends o'er his book, Bright pictures of profit delighting to draw, O'er his shoulders with large cipher eyeballs I look, And down drops the pen from his paralyz'd paw! When the Premier lies dreaming of dear Waterloo, And expects through another to caper and prank it, You'd laugh did you see, when I bellow out “Boo!” How he hides his brave Waterloo head in the blanket. When mighty Belshazzar brims high in the hall His cup, full of gout, to the Gaul's overthrow, Lo, “Eight Hundred Millions” I write on the wall, And the cup falls to earth and—the gout to his toe! But the joy of my heart is when largely I cram My maw with the fruits of the Squirearchy's acres, And, knowing who made me the thing that I am, Like the monster of Frankenstein, worry my makers. Then riddle-me-ree, come, riddle-me-ree, And tell, if thou know'st, who I may be. DOG-DAY REFLECTIONS. BY A DANDY KEPT IN TOWN. “Vox clamantis in deserto.” 1827. Said Malthus, one day, to a clown Lying stretch'd on the beach, in the sun,— “What's the number of souls in this town?”— “The number! Lord bless you, there's none. “We have nothing but dabs in this place, “Of them a great plenty there are;— “But the soles, please your rev'rence and grace, “Are all t'other side of the bar.” And so 'tis in London just now, Not a soul to be seen, up or down;— Of dabs a great glut, I allow, But your soles, every one, out of town. East or west, nothing wond'rous or new; No courtship or scandal, worth knowing; Mrs. B?, and a Mermaid One of the shows of London. or two, Are the only loose fish that are going. Ah, where is that dear house of Peers, That, some weeks ago, kept us merry? Where, Eld?n, art thou, with thy tears? And thou, with thy sense, L?d?d?y? Wise Marquis, how much the Lord May'r, In the dog-days, with thee must be puzzled!— It being his task to take care That such animals shan't go unmuzzled. Thou, too, whose political toils Are so worthy a captain of horse— Whose amendments More particularly his Grace's celebrated amendment to the Corn Bill; for which, and the circumstances connected with it, see Annual Register for a. d. 1827. (like honest Sir Boyle's) Are “amendments, that make matters worse;” From a speech of Sir Boyle Roche's, in the Irish House of Commons. Great Chieftain, who takest such pains To prove—what is granted, nem. con.— With how mod'rate a portion of brains Some heroes contrive to get on. And, thou, too, my R?d?sd?e, ah, where Is the peer, with a star at his button, Whose quarters could ever compare With R?d?sd?e's five quarters of mutton? The learning his Lordship displayed, on the subject of the butcher's “fifth quarter” of mutton, will not speedily be forgotten. Why, why have ye taken your flight, Ye diverting and dignified crew? How ill do three farces a night, At the Haymarket, pay us for you! For, what is Bombastes to thee, My Ell?nbro', when thou look'st big? Or, where's the burletta can be Like L?d?rd?le's wit, and his wig? I doubt if ev'n Griffinhoof The nom de guerre under which Colman has written some of his best farces. could (Though Griffin's a comical lad) Invent any joke half so good As that precious one, “This is too bad!” Then come again, come again, Spring! Oh haste thee, with Fun in thy train; And—of all things the funniest—bring These exalted Grimaldis again! THE “LIVING DOG” AND “THE DEAD LION.” 1828. Next week will be publish'd (as “Lives” are the rage) The whole Reminiscences, wond'rous and strange, Of a small puppy-dog, that liv'd once in the cage Of the late noble Lion at Exeter 'Change. Though the dog is a dog of the kind they call “sad,” 'Tis a puppy that much to good breeding pretends; And few dogs have such opportunities had Of knowing how Lions behave—among friends; How that animal eats, how he snores, how he drinks, Is all noted down by this Boswell so small; And 'tis plain, from each sentence, the puppy-dog thinks That the Lion was no such great things after all. Though he roar'd pretty well—this the puppy allows— It was all, he says, borrow'd—all second-hand roar; And he vastly prefers his own little bow-wows To the loftiest war-note the Lion could pour. 'Tis, indeed, as good fun as a Cynic could ask, To see how this cockney-bred setter of rabbits Takes gravely the Lord of the Forest to task, And judges of lions by puppy-dog habits. Nay, fed as he was (and this makes it a dark case) With sops every day from the Lion's own pan, He lifts up his leg at the noble beast's carcass, And—does all a dog, so diminutive, can. However, the book's a good book, being rich in Examples and warnings to lions high-bred, How they suffer small mongrelly curs in their kitchen, Who'll feed on them living, and foul them when dead. T. Pidcock. Exeter 'Change. ODE TO DON MIGUEL. Et tu, Brute! 1828. At the commencement of this year, the designs of Don Miguel and his partisans against the constitution established by his brother had begun more openly to declare themselves. What! Miguel, not patriotic? oh, fy! After so much good teaching 'tis quite a take-in, Sir;— First school'd, as you were, under Metternich's eye, And then (as young misses say) “finish'd” at Windsor! Don Miguel had paid a visit to the English court, at the close of the year 1827. I ne'er in my life knew a case that was harder;— Such feasts as you had, when you made us a call! Three courses each day from his Majesty's larder,— And now, to turn absolute Don, after all!! Some authors, like Bayes, to the style and the matter Of each thing they write suit the way that they dine, Roast sirloin for Epic, broil'd devils for Satire, And hotchpotch and trifle for rhymes such as mine. That Rulers should feed the same way, I've no doubt;— Great Despots on bouilli serv'd up à la Russe Dressed with a pint of the strongest spirits—a favourite dish of the Great Frederick of Prussia, and which he persevered in eating even on his death-bed, much to the horror of his physician Zimmerman., Your small German Princes on frogs and sour crout, And your Vice-roy of Hanover always on goose. Some Dons, too, have fancied (though this may be fable) A dish rather dear, if, in cooking, they blunder it;— Not content with the common hot meat on a table, They're partial (eh, Mig?) to a dish of cold under it! This quiet case of murder, with all its particulars—the hiding the body under the dinner-table, &amp;c. &amp;c.—is, no doubt, well known to the reader. No wonder a Don of such appetites found Even Windsor's collations plebeianly plain; Where the dishes most high that my Lady sends round Are her Maintenon cutlets and soup à la Reine. Alas! that a youth with such charming beginnings, Should sink, all at once, to so sad a conclusion, And, what is still worse, throw the losings and winnings Of worthies on 'Change into so much confusion! The Bulls, in hysterics—the Bears just as bad— The few men who have, and the many who've not tick, All shock'd to find out that that promising lad, Prince Metternich's pupil, is—not patriotic! THOUGHTS ON THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND. 1828. Oft have I seen, in gay, equestrian pride, Some well-rouged youth round Astley's Circus ride Two stately steeds—standing, with graceful straddle, Like him of Rhodes, with foot on either saddle, While to soft tunes—some jigs, and some andantes— He steers around his light-paced Rosinantes. So rides along, with canter smooth and pleasant, That horseman bold, Lord Anglesea, at present;— Papist and Protestant the coursers twain, That lend their necks to his impartial rein, And round the ring—each honour'd, as they go, With equal pressure from his gracious toe— To the old medley tune, half “Patrick's Day” And half “Boyne Water,” take their cantering way, While Peel, the showman in the middle, cracks His long-lash'd whip, to cheer the doubtful hacks. Ah, ticklish trial of equestrian art! How blest, if neither steed would bolt or start;— If Protestant's old restive tricks were gone, And Papist's winkers could be still kept on! But no, false hopes—not ev'n the great Ducrow 'Twixt two such steeds could 'scape an overthrow: If solar hacks play'd Phaëton a trick, What hope, alas, from hackneys lunatic? If once my Lord his graceful balance loses, Or fails to keep each foot where each horse chooses; If Peel but gives one extra touch of whip To Papist's tail or Protestant's ear-tip— That instant ends their glorious horsemanship! Off bolt the sever'd steeds, for mischief free, And down, between them, plumps Lord Anglesea! THE LIMBO OF LOST REPUTATIONS. A DREAM. “Cio che si perde qui, làsi raguna.” Ariosto. “? a valley, where he sees Things that on earth were lost.” Milton. 1828. Know'st thou not him Astolpho. the poet sings, Who flew to the moon's serene domain, And saw that valley, where all the things, That vanish on earth, are found again— The hopes of youth, the resolves of age, The vow of the lover, the dream of the sage, The golden visions of mining cits, The promises great men strew about them; And, pack'd in compass small, the wits Of monarchs, who rule as well without them!— Like him, but diving with wing profound, I have been to a Limbo under ground, Where characters lost on earth, (and cried, In vain, like H?rr?s's, far and wide,) In heaps, like yesterday's orts, are thrown And there, so worthless and fly-blown, That even the imps would not purloin them, Lie, till their worthy owners join them. Curious it was to see this mass Of lost and torn-up reputations;— Some of them female wares, alas, Mislaid at innocent assignations; Some, that had sigh'd their last amen From the canting lips of saints that would be; And some once own'd by “the best of men,” Who had prov'd—no better than they should be. 'Mong others, a poet's fame I spied, Once shining fair, now soak'd and black— “No wonder” (an imp at my elbow cried), “For I pick'd it out of a butt of sack!” Just then a yell was heard o'er head, Like a chimney-sweeper's lofty summons; And lo! a dev'l right downward sped, Bringing, within his claws so red, Two statesmen's characters, found, he said, Last night, on the floor of the House of Commons; The which, with black official grin, He now to the Chief Imp handed in;— Both these articles much the worse For their journey down, as you may suppose; But one so devilish rank—“Odd's curse!” Said the Lord Chief Imp, and held his nose. “Ho, ho!” quoth he, “I know full well “From whom these two stray matters fell;”— Then, casting away, with loathful shrug, The' uncleaner waif (as he would a drug The' Invisible's own dark hand had mix'd), His gaze on the other H?k?n. firm he fix'd, And trying, though mischief laugh'd in his eye, To be moral, because of the young imps by, “What a pity!” he cried—“so fresh its gloss, “So long preserv'd—'tis a public loss! “This comes of a man, the careless blockhead, “Keeping his character in his pocket; “And there—without considering whether “There's room for that and his gains together— “Cramming, and cramming, and cramming away, “Till—out slips character some fine day! “However”—and here he view'd it round— “This article still may pass for sound. “Some flaws, soon patch'd, some stains are all “The harm it has had in its luckless fall. “Here, Puck!”—and he call'd to one of his train— “The owner may have this back again. “Though damag'd for ever, if us'd with skill, “It may serve, perhaps, to trade on still; “Though the gem can never, as once, be set, “It will do for a Tory Cabinet.” HOW TO WRITE BY PROXY. Qui facit per alium facit per se. 'Mong our neighbours, the French, in the good olden time When Nobility flourish'd, great Barons and Dukes Often set up for authors in prose and in rhyme, But ne'er took the trouble to write their own books. Poor devils were found to do this for their betters;— And, one day, a Bishop, addressing a Blue, Said, “Ma'am, have you read my new Pastoral Letters?” To which the Blue answer'd—“No, Bishop, have you?” The same is now done by our privileg'd class; And, to show you how simple the process it needs, If a great Major-General Or Lieutenant-General, as it may happen to be. wishes to pass For an author of History, thus he proceeds:— First, scribbling his own stock of notions as well As he can, with a goose-quill that claims him as kin, He settles his neckcloth—takes snuff—rings the bell, And yawningly orders a Subaltern in. The Subaltern comes—sees his General seated, In all the self-glory of authorship swelling;— “There, look,” saith his Lordship, “my work is completed,— “It wants nothing now, but the grammar and spelling.” Well used to a breach, the brave Subaltern dreads Awkward breaches of syntax a hundred times more; And, though often condemn'd to see breaking of heads, He had ne'er seen such breaking of Priscian's before. However, the job's sure to pay—that's enough— So, to it he sets with his tinkering hammer, Convinc'd that there never was job half so tough As the mending a great Major-General's grammar. But, lo, a fresh puzzlement starts up to view— New toil for the Sub.—for the Lord new expense: 'Tis discover'd that mending his grammar wo'n't do, As the Subaltern also must find him in sense! At last—even this is achieved by his aid; Friend Subaltern pockets the cash and—the story; Drums beat—the new Grand March of Intellect's play'd— And off struts my Lord, the Historian, in glory! IMITATION OF THE INFERNO OF DANTE. “Così quel fiato gli spiriti mali Di quà, di là, di giù, di su gli mena.” Inferno, canto 5. I turn'd my steps, and lo, a shadowy throng Of ghosts came fluttering tow'rds me—blown along, Like cockchafers in high autumnal storms, By many a fitful gust that through their forms Whistled, as on they came, with wheezy puff, And puff'd as—though they'd never puff enough. “Whence and what are ye?” pitying I inquir'd Of these poor ghosts, who, tatter'd, tost, and tir'd With such eternal puffing, scarce could stand On their lean legs while answering my demand. “We once were authors”—thus the Sprite, who led This tag-rag regiment of spectres, said— “Authors of every sex, male, female, neuter, “Who, early smit with love of praise and—pewter The classical term for money., “On C?lb?n's The reader may fill up this gap with any one of the dissyllabic publishers of London that occurs to him. shelves first saw the light of day, “In ?'s puffs exhal'd our lives away— “Like summer windmills, doom'd to dusty peace, “When the brisk gales, that lent them motion, cease. “Ah, little knew we then what ills await “Much-lauded scribblers in their after-state; “Bepuff'd on earth—how loudly Str?t can tell— “And, dire reward, now doubly puff'd in hell!” Touch'd with compassion for this ghastly crew, Whose ribs, even now, the hollow wind sung through In mournful prose,—such prose as Rosa's Rosa Matilda, who was for many years the writer of the political articles in the journal alluded to, and whose spirit still seems to preside—“regnat Rosa”—over its pages. ghost Still, at the' accustom'd hour of eggs and toast, Sighs through the columns of the M?rn?g P?t,— Pensive I turn'd to weep, when he, who stood Foremost of all that flatulential brood, Singling a she-ghost from the party, said, “Allow me to present Miss X.

LAMENT FOR THE LOSS OF LORD B?TH?ST'S TAIL. The noble Lord, it is well known, cut off this much-respected appendage, on his retirement from office some months since. All in again—unlook'd for bliss! Yet, ah, one adjunct still we miss;— One tender tie, attach'd so long To the same head, through right and wrong. Why, B?th?st, why didst thou cut off That memorable tail of thine? Why—as if one was not enough— Thy pig-tie with thy place resign, And thus, at once, both cut and run? Alas, my Lord, 'twas not well done, 'Twas not, indeed—though sad at heart, From office and its sweets to part, Yet hopes of coming in again, Sweet Tory hopes! beguil'd our pain; But thus to miss that tail of thine, Through long, long years our rallying sign— As if the State and all its powers By tenancy in tail were ours— To see it thus by scissors fall, This was “the' unkindest cut of all!” It seem'd as though the' ascendant day Of Toryism had pass'd away, And, proving Samson's story true, She lost her vigour with her queue. Parties are much like fish, 'tis said— The tail directs them, not the head; Then, how could any party fail, That steer'd its course by B?th?st's tail? Not Murat's plume, through Wagram's fight, E'er shed such guiding glories from it, As erst, in all true Tories' sight, Blaz'd from our old Colonial comet! If you, my Lord, a Bashaw were, (As W?ll?gt?n will be anon) Thou might'st have had a tail to spare; But no, alas, thou hadst but one. And that—like Troy, or Babylon, A tale of other times—is gone! Yet—weep ye not, ye Tories true— Fate has not yet of all bereft us; Though thus depriv'd of B?th?st's queue, We've E?b?h's curls still left us;— Sweet curls, from which young Love, so vicious, His shots, as from nine-pounders, issues; Grand, glorious curls, which, in debate, Surcharg'd with all a nation's fate, His Lordship shakes, as Homer's God did “Shakes his ambrosial curls, and gives the nod.” Pope's Homer., And oft in thundering talk comes near him;— Except that, there, the speaker nodded, And, here, 'tis only those who hear him. Long, long, ye ringlets, on the soil Of that fat cranium may ye flourish, With plenty of Macassar oil, Through many a year your growth to nourish! And, ah, should Time too soon unsheath His barbarous shears such locks to sever, Still dear to Tories, even in death, Their last, lov'd relics we'll bequeath, A hair-loom to our sons for ever. THE CHERRIES. A PARABLE. Written during the late discussion on the Test and Corporation Acts. 1828. See those cherries, how they cover Yonder sunny garden wall;— Had they not that network over, Thieving birds would eat them all. So, to guard our posts and pensions, Ancient sages wove a net, Through whose holes, of small dimensions, Only certain knaves can get. Shall we then this network widen? Shall we stretch these sacred holes, Through which, ev'n already, slide in Lots of small dissenting souls? “God forbid!” old Testy crieth; “God forbid!” so echo I; Every ravenous bird that flieth Then would at our cherries fly. Ope but half an inch or so, And, behold, what bevies break in;— Here, some curst old Popish crow Pops his long and lickerish beak in; Here, sly Arians flock unnumber'd, And Socinians, slim and spare, Who, with small belief encumber'd, Slip in easy any where;— Methodists, of birds the aptest, Where there's pecking going on; And that water-fowl, the Baptist— All would share our fruits anon; Ev'ry bird, of ev'ry city, That, for years, with ceaseless din, Hath revers'd the starling's ditty, Singing out “I can't get in.” “God forbid!” old Testy snivels; “God forbid!” I echo too; Rather may ten thousand d?v?ls Seize the whole voracious crew! If less costly fruit wo'n't suit 'em, Hips and haws and such like berries, Curse the corm'rants! stone 'em, shoot 'em, Any thing—to save our cherries. STANZAS WRITTEN IN ANTICIPATION OF DEFEAT. During the discussion of the Catholic question in the House of Commons last session. 1828. Go seek for some abler defenders of wrong, If we must run the gantlet through blood and expense; Or, Goths as ye are, in your multitude strong, Be content with success, and pretend not to sense. If the words of the wise and the gen'rous are vain, If Truth by the bowstring must yield up her breath, Let Mutes do the office—and spare her the pain Of an In?gl?s or T?nd?l to talk her to death. Chain, persecute, plunder—do all that you will— But save us, at least, the old womanly lore Of a F?st?r, who, dully prophetic of ill, Is, at once, the two instruments, augur This rhyme is more for the ear than the eye, as the carpenter's tool is spelt auger. and bore. Bring legions of Squires—if they'll only be mute— And array their thick heads against reason and right, Like the Roman of old, of historic repute Fabius, who sent droves of bullocks against the enemy., Who with droves of dumb animals carried the fight; Pour out, from each corner and hole of the Court, Your Bedchamber lordlings, your salaried slaves, Who, ripe for all job-work, no matter what sort, Have their consciences tack'd to their patents and staves. Catch all the small fry who, as Juvenal sings, Are the Treasury's creatures, wherever they swim Res Fisci est, ubicumque natat. —Juvenal.; With all the base, time-serving toadies of Kings, Who, if Punch were the monarch, would worship ev'n him; And while, on the one side, each name of renown, That illumines and blesses our age is combin'd; While the Foxes, the Pitts, and the Cannings look down, And drop o'er the cause their rich mantles of Mind; Let bold Paddy H?lmes show his troops on the other, And, counting of noses the quantum desir'd, Let Paddy but say, like the Gracchi's fam'd mother, “Come forward, my jewels”—'tis all that's requir'd. And thus let your farce be enacted hereafter— Thus honestly persecute, outlaw, and chain; But spare ev'n your victims the torture of laughter, And never, oh never, try reasoning again! END OF THE EIGHTH VOLUME. ODE TO THE WOODS AND FORESTS. BY ONE OF THE BOARD. 1828. Let other bards to groves repair, Where linnets strain their tuneful throats, Mine be the Woods and Forests, where The Treasury pours its sweeter notes. No whispering winds have charms for me, Nor zephyr's balmy sighs I ask; To raise the wind for Royalty Be all our Sylvan zephyr's task! And, 'stead of crystal brooks and floods, And all such vulgar irrigation, Let Gallic rhino through our Woods Divert its “course of liquid-ation.” Ah, surely, Virgil knew full well What Woods and Forests ought to be, When, sly, he introduc'd in hell His guinea-plant, his bullion-tree Called by Virgil, botanically, “species auri frondentis.”:— Nor see I why, some future day, When short of cash, we should not send Our H?rr?s down—he knows the way— To see if Woods in hell will lend. Long may ye flourish, sylvan haunts, Beneath whose “branches of expense” Our gracious K?g gets all he wants,— Except a little taste and sense. Long, in your golden shade reclin'd, Like him of fair Armida's bowers, May W?ll?n some wood-nymph find, To cheer his dozenth lustrum's hours; To rest from toil the Great Untaught, And soothe the pangs his warlike brain Must suffer, when, unus'd to thought, It tries to think, and—tries in vain. Oh long may Woods and Forests be Preserv'd, in all their teeming graces, To shelter Tory bards, like me, Who take delight in Sylvan places! Tu facis, ut silvas, ut amem loca ? Ovid. STANZAS FROM THE BANKS OF THE SHANNON. These verses were suggested by the result of the Clare election, in the year 1828, when the Right Honourable W. Vesey Fitzgerald was rejected, and Mr. O'Connell returned. 1828. “Take back the virgin page.” Moore's Irish Melodies. No longer, dear V?sey, feel hurt and uneasy At hearing it said by thy Treasury brother, That thou art a sheet of blank paper, my V?sey, And he, the dear, innocent placeman, another. Some expressions to this purport, in a published letter of one of these gentlemen, had then produced a good deal of amusement. For, lo, what a service we, Irish, have done thee;— Thou now art a sheet of blank paper no more; By St. Patrick, we've scrawl'd such a lesson upon thee As never was scrawl'd upon foolscap before. Come—on with your spectacles, noble Lord Duke, (Or O'Connell has green ones he haply would lend you,) Read V?sey all o'er (as you can't read a book) And improve by the lesson we, bog-trotters, send you; A lesson, in large Roman characters trac'd, Whose awful impressions from you and your kin Of blank-sheeted statesmen will ne'er be effac'd— Unless, 'stead of paper, you're mere asses' skin. Shall I help you to construe it? ay, by the Gods, Could I risk a translation, you should have a rare one; But pen against sabre is desperate odds, And you, my Lord Duke (as you hinted once), wear one. Again and again I say, read V?sey o'er;— You will find him worth all the old scrolls of papyrus, That Egypt e'er fill'd with nonsensical lore, Or the learned Champollion e'er wrote of, to tire us. All blank as he was, we've return'd him on hand, Scribbled o'er with a warning to Princes and Dukes, Whose plain, simple drift if they wo'n't understand, Though caress'd at St. James's, they're fit for St. Luke's. Talk of leaves of the Sibyls!—more meaning convey'd is In one single leaf such as now we have spell'd on, Than e'er hath been utter'd by all the old ladies That ever yet spoke, from the Sibyls to Eld?n.

Oh tidings of freedom! oh accents of hope! Waft, waft them, ye zephyrs, to Erin's blue sea, And refresh with their sounds every son of the Pope, From Dingle-a-cooch to far Donaghadee. “If mutely the slave will endure and obey, “Nor clanking his fetters, nor breathing his pains, “His masters, perhaps, at some far distant day, “May think (tender tyrants!) of loosening his chains.” Wise “if” and “perhaps!”—precious salve for our wounds, If he, who would rule thus o'er manacled mutes, Could check the free spring-tide of Mind, that resounds, Even now, at his feet, like the sea at Canute's. But, no, 'tis in vain—the grand impulse is given— Man knows his high Charter, and knowing will claim; And if ruin must follow where fetters are riven, Be theirs, who have forg'd them, the guilt and the shame. “If the slave will be silent!”—vain Soldier, beware— There is a dead silence the wrong'd may assume, When the feeling, sent back from the lips in despair, But clings round the heart with a deadlier gloom;— When the blush, that long burn'd on the suppliant's cheek, Gives place to the' avenger's pale, resolute hue; And the tongue, that once threaten'd, disdaining to speak, Consigns to the arm the high office—to do. If men, in that silence, should think of the hour, When proudly their fathers in panoply stood, Presenting, alike, a bold front-work of power To the despot on land and the foe on the flood:— That hour, when a Voice had come forth from the west, To the slave bringing hopes, to the tyrant alarms; And a lesson, long look'd for, was taught the opprest, That kings are as dust before freemen in arms! If, awfuller still, the mute slave should recall That dream of his boyhood, when Freedom's sweet day At length seem'd to break through a long night of thrall, And Union and Hope went abroad in its ray;— If Fancy should tell him, that Day-spring of Good, Though swiftly its light died away from his chain, Though darkly it set in a nation's best blood, Now wants but invoking to shine out again;— If—if, I say—breathings like these should come o'er The chords of remembrance, and thrill, as they come, Then, perhaps—ay, perhaps—but I dare not say more; Thou hast will'd that thy slaves should be mute—I am dumb. WRITE ON, WRITE ON. A BALLAD. Air.—“Sleep on, sleep on, my Kathleen dear.” Salvete, fratres Asini. St. Francis. Write on, write on, ye Barons dear, Ye Dukes, write hard and fast; The good we've sought for many a year Your quills will bring at last. One letter more, N?wc?stle, pen, To match Lord K?ny?n's two, And more than Ireland's host of men, One brace of Peers will do. Write on, write on, &amp;c. Sure, never, since the precious use Of pen and ink began, Did letters, writ by fools, produce Such signal good to man. While intellect, 'mong high and low, Is marching on, they say, Give me the Dukes and Lords, who go, Like crabs, the other way. Write on, write on, &amp;c. Ev'n now I feel the coming light— Ev'n now, could Folly lure My Lord M?ntc?sh?l, too, to write, Emancipation's sure. By geese (we read in history), Old Rome was sav'd from ill; And now, to quills of geese, we see Old Rome indebted still. Write on, write on, &amp;c. Write, write, ye Peers, nor stoop to style, Nor beat for sense about— Things, little worth a Noble's while, You're better far without. Oh ne'er, since asses spoke of yore, Such miracles were done; For, write but four such letters more, And Freedom's cause is won! SONG OF THE DEPARTING SPIRIT OF TITHE. “The parting Genius is with sighing sent.” Milton. It is o'er, it is o'er, my reign is o'er; I hear a Voice, from shore to shore, From Dunfanaghy to Baltimore, And it saith, in sad, parsonic tone, “Great Tithe and Small are dead and gone!” Even now, I behold your vanishing wings, Ye Tenths of all conceivable things, Which Adam first, as Doctors deem, Saw, in a sort of night-mare dream A reverend prebendary of Hereford, in an Essay on the Revenues of the Church of England, has assigned the origin of Tithes to “some unrecorded revelation made to Adam.”, After the feast of fruit abhorr'd— First indigestion on record!— Ye decimate ducks, ye chosen chicks, Ye pigs which, though ye be Catholics, Or of Calvin's most select deprav'd, In the Church must have your bacon sav'd;— Ye fields, where Labour counts his sheaves, And, whatsoever himself believes, Must bow to the' Establish'd Church belief, That the tenth is always a Protestant sheaf;— Ye calves, of which the man of Heaven Takes Irish tithe, one calf in seven “The tenth calf is due to the parson of common right; and if there are seven he shall have one.” —Rees's Cyclopædia, art. “Tithes.”; Ye tenths of rape, hemp, barley, flax, Eggs Chaucer's Plowman complains of the parish rectors, that “For the tithing of a duck, Or an apple, or an aye (egg), They make him swear upon a boke; Thus they foulen Christ's fay.”, timber, milk, fish, and bees' wax; All things, in short, since earth's creation, Doom'd, by the Church's dispensation, To suffer eternal decimation— Leaving the whole lay-world, since then, Reduc'd to nine parts out of ten; Or—as we calculate thefts and arsons— Just ten per cent. the worse for Parsons! Alas, and is all this wise device For the saving of souls thus gone in a trice?— The whole put down, in the simplest way, By the souls resolving not to pay! And even the Papists, thankless race, Who have had so much the easiest case— To pay for our sermons doom'd, 'tis true, But not condemn'd to hear them, too— (Our holy business being, 'tis known, With the ears of their barley, not their own,) Even they object to let us pillage, By right divine, their tenth of tillage, And, horror of horrors, even decline To find us in sacramental wine! Among the specimens laid before Parliament of the sort of Church rates levied upon Catholics in Ireland, was a charge of two pipes of port for sacramental wine. It is o'er, it is o'er, my reign is o'er, Ah, never shall rosy Rector more, Like the shepherds of Israel, idly eat, And make of his flock “a prey and meat.” Ezekiel, xxxiv. 10.—“Neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.” No more shall be his the pastoral sport Of suing his flock in the Bishop's Court, Through various steps, Citation, Libel— Scriptures all, but not the Bible; Working the Law's whole apparatus, To get at a few pre-doom'd potatoes, And summoning all the powers of wig, To settle the fraction of a pig!— Till, parson and all committed deep In the case of “Shepherds versus Sheep,” The Law usurps the Gospel's place, And, on Sundays, meeting face to face, While Plaintiff fills the preacher's station, Defendants form the congregation. So lives he, Mammon's priest, not Heaven's, For tenths thus all at sixes and sevens, Seeking what parsons love no less Than tragic poets—a good distress. Instead of studying St. Augustin, Gregory Nyss., or old St. Justin (Books fit only to hoard dust in), His reverence stints his evening readings To learn'd Reports of Tithe Proceedings, Sipping, the while, that port so ruddy, Which forms his only ancient study;— Port so old, you'd swear its tartar Was of the age of Justin Martyr, And, had he sipp'd of such, no doubt His martyrdom would have been—to gout. Is all then lost?—alas, too true— Ye Tenths belov'd, adieu, adieu! My reign is o'er, my reign is o'er— Like old Thumb's ghost, “I can no more.” THE EUTHANASIA OF VAN. “We are told that the bigots are growing old and fast wearing out. If it be so, why not let us die in peace?” —Lord Bexley's Letter to the Freeholders of Kent. Stop, Intellect, in mercy stop, Ye curst improvements, cease; And let poor Nick V?ns?tt?t drop Into his grave in peace. Hide, Knowledge, hide thy rising sun, Young Freedom, veil thy head; Let nothing good be thought or done, Till Nick V?ns?tt?t's dead! Take pity on a dotard's fears, Who much doth light detest; And let his last few drivelling years Be dark as were the rest. You, too, ye fleeting one-pound notes, Speed not so fast away— Ye rags, on which old Nicky gloats, A few months longer stay. Perituræ parcere chartæ. Together soon, or much I err, You both from life may go— The notes unto the scavenger, And Nick—to Nick below. Ye Liberals, whate'er your plan, Be all reforms suspended; In compliment to dear old Van, Let nothing bad be mended. Ye Papists, whom oppression wrings, Your cry politely cease, And fret your hearts to fiddle-strings That Van may die in peace. So shall he win a fame sublime By few old rag-men gain'd; Since all shall own, in Nicky's time, Nor sense, nor justice reign'd. So shall his name through ages past, And dolts ungotten yet, Date from “the days of Nicholas,” With fond and sad regret;— And sighing, say, “Alas, had he “Been spar'd from Pluto's bowers, “The blessed reign of Bigotry “And Rags might still be ours!” TO THE REVEREND ?. ONE OF THE SIXTEEN REQUISITIONISTS OF NOTTINGHAM. 1828. What, you, too, my ??????, in hashes so knowing, Of sauces and soups Aristarchus profest! Are you, too, my savoury Brunswicker, going To make an old fool of yourself with the rest? Far better to stick to your kitchen receipts; And—if you want something to tease—for variety, Go study how Ude, in his “Cookery,” treats Live eels, when he fits them for polish'd society. Just snuggling them in, 'twixt the bars of the fire, He leaves them to wriggle and writhe on the coals The only way, Monsieur Ude assures us, to get rid of the oil so objectionable in this fish., In a manner that H?rn?r himself would admire, And wish, 'stead of eels, they were Catholic souls. Ude tells us, the fish little suffering feels; While Papists, of late, have more sensitive grown; So, take my advice, try your hand at live eels, And, for once, let the other poor devils alone. I have ev'n a still better receipt for your cook— How to make a goose die of confirm'd hepatitis A liver complaint. The process by which the livers of geese are enlarged for the famous Patés de foie d'oie.; And, if you'll, for once, fellow-feelings o'erlook, A well-tortur'd goose a most capital sight is. First, catch him, alive—make a good steady fire— Set your victim before it, both legs being tied, (As, if left to himself, he might wish to retire,) And place a large bowl of rich cream by his side. There roasting by inches, dry, fever'd, and faint, Having drunk all the cream, you so civilly laid, off, He dies of as charming a liver complaint As ever sleek parson could wish a pie made of. Besides, only think, my dear one of Sixteen, What an emblem this bird, for the epicure's use meant, Presents of the mode in which Ireland has been Made a tid-bit for yours and your brethren's amusement: Tied down to the stake, while her limbs, as they quiver, A slow fire of tyranny wastes by degrees— No wonder disease should have swell'd up her liver, No wonder you, Gourmands, should love her disease. IRISH ANTIQUITIES. According to some learn'd opinions The Irish once were Carthaginians; But, trusting to more late descriptions, I'd rather say they were Egyptians. My reason's this:—the Priests of Isis, When forth they march'd in long array, Employ'd, 'mong other grave devices, A Sacred Ass to lead the way To this practice the ancient adage alludes, “Asinus portans mysteria.”; And still the antiquarian traces 'Mong Irish Lords this Pagan plan, For still, in all religious cases, They put Lord R?d?n in the van. A CURIOUS FACT. The present Lord K?ny?n (the Peer who writes letters, For which the waste-paper folks much are his debtors) Hath one little oddity, well worth reciting, Which puzzleth observers, ev'n more than his writing. Whenever Lord K?ny?n doth chance to behold A cold Apple-pie—mind, the pie must be cold— His Lordship looks solemn (few people know why), And he makes a low bow to the said apple-pie. This idolatrous act, in so “vital” a Peer, Is, by most serious Protestants, thought rather queer— Pie-worship, they hold, coming under the head (Vide Crustium, chap. iv.) of the Worship of Bread. Some think 'tis a tribute, as author, he owes For the service that pie-crust hath done to his prose;— The only good things in his pages, they swear, Being those that the pastry-cook sometimes puts there. Others say, 'tis a homage, through pie-crust convey'd, To our Glorious Deliverer's much-honour'd shade; As that Protestant Hero (or Saint, if you please) Was as fond of cold pie as he was of green peas See the anecdote, which the Duchess of Marlborough relates in her Memoirs, of this polite hero appropriating to himself one day, at dinner, a whole dish of green peas—the first of the season—while the poor Princess Anne, who was then in a longing condition, sat by, vainly entreating, with her eyes, for a share., And 'tis solely in loyal remembrance of that, My Lord K?ny?n to apple-pie takes off his hat. While others account for this kind salutation By what Tony Lumpkin calls “concatenation;”— A certain good-will that, from sympathy's ties, 'Twixt old Apple-women and Orange-men lies. But 'tis needless to add, these are all vague surmises, For thus, we're assur'd, the whole matter arises: Lord K?ny?n's respected old father (like many Respected old fathers) was fond of a penny; And lov'd so to save The same prudent propensity characterises his descendant, who (as is well known) would not even go to the expense of a diphthong on his father's monument, but had the inscription spelled, economically, thus:—“Mors janua vita.”, that,—there's not the least question— His death was brought on by a bad indigestion, From cold apple-pie-crust his Lordship would stuff in, At breakfast, to save the expense of hot muffin. Hence it is, and hence only, that cold apple-pies Are beheld by his Heir with such reverent eyes— Just as honest King Stephen his beaver might doff To the fishes that carried his kind uncle off— And while filial piety urges so many on, 'Tis pure apple-pie-ety moves my Lord K?ny?n. NEW-FASHIONED ECHOES. Sir, Most of your readers are, no doubt, acquainted with the anecdote told of a certain, not over-wise, judge, who, when in the act of delivering a charge in some country court-house, was interrupted by the braying of an ass at the door. “What noise is that?” asked the angry judge. “Only an extraordinary echo there is in court, my Lord,” answered one of the counsel. As there are a number of such “extraordinary echoes” abroad just now, you will not, perhaps, be unwilling, Mr. Editor, to receive the following few lines suggested by them. Yours, &amp;c. S. Huc coeamus “Let us form Clubs.”, ait; nullique libentius unquam Responsura sono, Coeamus, retulit echo. Ovid. There are echoes, we know, of all sorts, From the echo, that “dies in the dale,” To the “airy-tongu'd babbler,” that sports Up the tide of the torrent her “tale.” There are echoes that bore us, like Blues, With the latest smart mot they have heard; There are echoes, extremely like shrews, Letting nobody have the last word. In the bogs of old Paddy-land, too, Certain “talented” echoes Commonly called “Paddy Blake's Echoes.” there dwell, Who, on being ask'd, “How do you do?” Politely reply, “Pretty well.” But why should I talk any more Of such old-fashion'd echoes as these, When Britain has new ones in store, That transcend them by many degrees? For, of all repercussions of sound, Concerning which bards make a pother, There's none like that happy rebound When one blockhead echoes another;— When K?ny?n commences the bray, And the Borough-Duke follows his track; And loudly from Dublin's sweet bay, R?thd?ne brays, with interest, back;— And while, of most echoes the sound On our ear by reflection doth fall, These Brunswickers Anti-Catholic associations, under the title of Brunswick Clubs, were at this time becoming numerous both in England and Ireland. pass the bray round, Without any reflection at all. Oh Scott, were I gifted like you, Who can name all the echoes there are From Benvoirlich to bold Ben-venue, From Benledi to wild Uamvar; I might track, through each hard Irish name, The rebounds of this asinine strain, Till from Neddy to Neddy, it came To the chief Neddy, K?ny?n, again; Might tell how it roar'd in R?thd?ne, How from D?ws?n it died off genteelly— How hollow it rung from the crown Of the fat-pated Marquis of E?y; How, on hearing my Lord of G?e, Thistle-eaters, the stoutest, gave way, Outdone, in their own special line, By the forty-ass power of his bray! But, no—for so humble a bard 'Tis a subject too trying to touch on; Such noblemen's names are too hard, And their noddles too soft to dwell much on. Oh Echo, sweet nymph of the hill, Of the dell, and the deep-sounding shelves; If, in spite of Narcissus, you still Take to fools who are charm'd with themselves, Who knows but, some morning retiring, To walk by the Trent's wooded side, You may meet with N?wc?stle, admiring His own lengthen'd ears in the tide! Or, on into Cambria straying, Find K?ny?n, that double tongu'd elf, In his love of ass-cendency, braying A Brunswick duet with himself! INCANTATION. FROM THE NEW TRAGEDY OF “THE BRUNSWICKERS.” 1828. SCENE.—Penenden Plain. In the middle, a caldron boiling. Thunder.—Enter three Brunswickers. 1st Bruns. —Thrice hath scribbling K?ny?n scrawl'd, 2d Bruns. —Once hath fool N?wc?stle bawl'd, 3d Bruns. —B?xl?y snores:—'tis time, 'tis time, 1st Bruns. —Round about the caldron go; In the pois'nous nonsense throw. Bigot spite, that long hath grown, Like a toad within a stone, Sweltering in the heart of Sc?tt, Boil we in the Brunswick pot. All. —Dribble, dribble, nonsense dribble, Eld?n, talk, and K?ny?n, scribble. 2d Bruns. —Slaver from N?wc?stle's quill In the noisome mess distil, Brimming high our Brunswick broth Both with venom and with froth. Mix the brains (though apt to hash ill, Being scant) of Lord M?ntc?shel, With that malty stuff which Ch?nd?s Drivels as no other man does. Catch (i. e. if catch you can) One idea, spick and span, From my Lord of S?l?sb?y,— One idea, though it be Smaller than the “happy flea,” Which his sire, in sonnet terse, Wedded to immortal verse. Alluding to a well-known lyric composition of the late Marquis, which, with a slight alteration, might be addressed either to a flea or a fly. For instance:— “Oh, happy, happy, happy fly, If I were you, or you were I.” Or, “Oh, happy, happy, happy flea, If I were you, or you were me; But since, alas! that cannot be, I must remain Lord S?y.” Though to rob the son is sin, Put his one idea in; And, to keep it company, Let that conjuror W?nch?ls?a Drop but half another there, If he hath so much to spare. Dreams of murders and of arsons, Hatch'd in heads of Irish parsons, Bring from every hole and corner, Where ferocious priests, like H?rn?r, Purely for religious good, Cry aloud for Papist's blood, Blood for W?lls, and such old women, At their ease to wade and swim in. All. —Dribble, dribble, nonsense dribble, B?xl?y, talk, and K?ny?n, scribble. 3d Bruns. —Now the charm begin to brew; Sisters, sisters, add thereto Scraps of L?thbr?dge's old speeches, Mix'd with leather from his breeches. Rinsings of old B?xl?y's brains, Thicken'd (if you'll take the pains) With that pulp which rags create, In their middle, nympha state, Ere, like insects frail and sunny, Forth they wing abroad as money. There—the Hell-broth we've enchanted— Now but one thing more is wanted. Squeeze o'er all that Orange juice, C? keeps cork'd for use, Which, to work the better spell, is Colour'd deep with blood of ?, Blood, of powers far more various, Ev'n than that of Januarius, Since so great a charm hangs o'er it, England's parsons bow before it! All. —Dribble, dribble, nonsense dribble, B?xl?y, talk, and K?ny?n, scribble. 2d Bruns. —Cool it now with ?'s blood, So the charm is firm and good. [Exeunt. HOW TO MAKE A GOOD POLITICIAN. Whene'er you're in doubt, said a Sage I once knew, 'Twixt two lines of conduct which course to pursue, Ask a woman's advice, and, whate'er she advise, Do the very reverse, and you're sure to be wise. Of the same use as guides, are the Brunswicker throng; In their thoughts, words, and deeds, so instinctively wrong, That, whatever they counsel, act, talk, or indite, Take the opposite course, and you're sure to be right. So golden this rule, that, had nature denied you The use of that finger-post, Reason, to guide you— Were you even more doltish than any giv'n man is, More soft than N?wc?stle, more twaddling than Van is, I'd stake my repute, on the following conditions, To make you the soundest of sound politicians. Place yourself near the skirts of some high-flying Tory— Some Brunswicker parson, of port-drinking glory,— Watch well how he dines, during any great Question— What makes him feed gaily, what spoils his digestion— And always feel sure that his joy o'er a stew Portends a clear case of dyspepsia to you. Read him backwards, like Hebrew—whatever he wishes, Or praises, note down as absurd, or pernicious. Like the folks of a weather-house, shifting about, When he's out, be an In—when he's in, be an Out. Keep him always revers'd in your thoughts, night and day, Like an Irish barometer turn'd the wrong way:— If he's up, you may swear that foul weather is nigh; If he's down, you may look for a bit of blue sky. Never mind what debaters or journalists say, Only ask what he thinks, and then think t'other way. Does he hate the Small-note Bill? then firmly rely The Small-note Bill's a blessing, though you don't know why. Is Brougham his aversion? then Harry's your man. Does he quake at O'Connell? take doubly to Dan. Is he all for the Turks? then, at once, take the whole Russian Empire (Czar, Cossacks, and all) to your soul. In short, whatsoever he talks, thinks, or is, Be your thoughts, words, and essence the contrast of his. Nay, as Siamese ladies—at least, the polite ones— All paint their teeth black, 'cause the devil has white ones— If ev'n, by the chances of time or of tide, Your Tory, for once, should have sense on his side, Even then stand aloof—for, be sure that Old Nick, When a Tory talks sensibly, means you some trick. Such my recipe is—and, in one single verse, I shall now, in conclusion, its substance rehearse. Be all that a Brunswicker is not, nor could be, And then—you'll be all that an honest man should be. EPISTLE OF CONDOLENCE, FROM A SLAVE-LORD, TO A COTTON-LORD. Alas! my dear friend, what a state of affairs! How unjustly we both are despoil'd of our rights! Not a pound of black flesh shall I leave to my heirs, Nor must you any more work to death little whites. Both forc'd to submit to that general controller Of King, Lords, and cotton mills, Public Opinion, No more shall you beat with a big billy-roller, Nor I with the cart-whip assert my dominion. Whereas, were we suffer'd to do as we please With our Blacks and our Whites, as of yore we were let, We might range them alternate, like harpsichord keys, And between us thump out a good piebald duet. But this fun is all over;—farewell to the zest Which Slav'ry now lends to each tea-cup we sip; Which makes still the cruellest coffee the best, And that sugar the sweetest which smacks of the whip. Farewell, too, the Factory's white picaninnies— Small, living machines, which, if flogg'd to their tasks, Mix so well with their namesakes, the “Billies” and “Jennies,” That which have got souls in 'em nobody asks;— Little Maids of the Mill, who, themselves but ill-fed, Are oblig'd, 'mong their other benevolent cares, To “keep feeding the scribblers One of the operations in cotton mills usually performed by children.,”—and better, 'tis said, Than old Blackwood or Fraser have ever fed theirs. All this is now o'er, and so dismal my loss is, So hard 'tis to part from the smack of the thong, That I mean (from pure love for the old whipping process), To take to whipt syllabub all my life long. THE GHOST OF MILTIADES. Ah quoties dubius Scriptis exarsit amator! Ovid. The Ghost of Miltiades came at night, And he stood by the bed of the Benthamite, And he said, in a voice that thrill'd the frame, “If ever the sound of Marathon's name “Hath fir'd thy blood or flush'd thy brow, “Lover of Liberty, rouse thee now!” The Benthamite, yawning, left his bed— Away to the Stock Exchange he sped, And he found the Scrip of Greece so high, That it fir'd his blood, it flush'd his eye, And oh, 'twas a sight for the Ghost to see, For never was Greek more Greek than he! And still as the premium higher went, His ecstasy rose—so much per cent. (As we see in a glass, that tells the weather, The heat and the silver rise together,) And Liberty sung from the patriot's lip, While a voice from his pocket whisper'd “Scrip!” The Ghost of Miltiades came again;— He smil'd, as the pale moon smiles through rain, For his soul was glad at that patriot strain; (And poor, dear ghost—how little he knew The jobs and the tricks of the Philhellene crew!) “Blessings and thanks!” was all he said, Then, melting away, like a night-dream, fled! The Benthamite hears—amaz'd that ghosts Could be such fools—and away he posts, A patriot still? Ah no, ah no— Goddess of Freedom, thy Scrip is low, And, warm and fond as thy lovers are, Thou triest their passion, when under par. The Benthamite's ardour fast decays, By turns he weeps, and swears, and prays, And wishes the d?l had Crescent and Cross, Ere he had been forc'd to sell at a loss. They quote him the Stock of various nations, But, spite of his classic associations, Lord, how he loathes the Greek quotations! “Who'll buy my Scrip? Who'll buy my Scrip?” Is now the theme of the patriot's lip, As he runs to tell how hard his lot is To Messrs. Orlando and Luriottis, And says, “Oh Greece, for Liberty's sake, “Do buy my Scrip, and I vow to break “Those dark, unholy bonds of thine— “If you'll only consent to buy up mine!” The Ghost of Miltiades came once more;— His brow, like the night, was lowering o'er, And he said, with a look that flash'd dismay, “Of Liberty's foes the worst are they, “Who turn to a trade her cause divine, “And gamble for gold on Freedom's shrine!” Thus saying, the Ghost, as he took his flight, Gave a Parthian kick to the Benthamite, Which sent him, whimpering, off to Jerry— And vanish'd away to the Stygian ferry! ALARMING INTELLIGENCE—REVOLUTION IN THE DICTIONARY—ONE GALT AT THE HEAD OF IT. God preserve us!—there's nothing now safe from assault;— Thrones toppling around, churches brought to the hammer; And accounts have just reach'd us that one Mr. Galt Has declar'd open war against English and Grammar! He had long been suspected of some such design, And, the better his wicked intents to arrive at, Had lately 'mong C?lb?n's troops of the line (The penny-a-line men) enlisted as private. There school'd, with a rabble of words at command, Scotch, English, and slang, in promiscuous alliance, He, at length, against Syntax has taken his stand, And sets all the Nine Parts of Speech at defiance. Next advices, no doubt, further facts will afford; In the mean time the danger most imminent grows, He has taken the Life of one eminent Lord, And whom he'll next murder the Lord only knows. Wednesday evening. Since our last, matters, luckily, look more serene; Tho' the rebel, 'tis stated, to aid his defection, Has seized a great Powder—no, Puff Magazine, And the' explosions are dreadful in every direction. What his meaning exactly is, nobody knows, As he talks (in a strain of intense botheration) Of lyrical “ichor “That dark diseased ichor which coloured his effusions.” —Galt's Life of Byron.,” “gelatinous” prose “That gelatinous character of their effusions.” —Ibid., And a mixture call'd amber immortalization. “The poetical embalmment, or rather, amber immortalization.” —Ibid. Now, he raves of a bard he once happen'd to meet, Seated high “among rattlings,” and churning a sonnet “Sitting amidst the shrouds and rattlings, churning an inarticulate melody.” —Ibid.; Now, talks of a mystery, wrapp'd in a sheet, With a halo (by way of a nightcap) upon it! “He was a mystery in a winding sheet, crowned with a halo.” —Galt's Life of Byron. We shudder in tracing these terrible lines; Something bad they must mean, tho' we can't make it out; For, whate'er may be guess'd of Galt's secret designs, That they're all Anti-English no Christian can doubt. RESOLUTIONS PASSED AT A LATE MEETING OF REVERENDS AND RIGHT REVERENDS. Resolv'd—to stick to ev'ry particle Of ev'ry Creed and ev'ry Article; Reforming nought, or great or little, We'll stanchly stand by every tittle One of the questions propounded to the Puritans in 1573 was—“Whether the Book of Service was good and godly, every tittle grounded on the Holy Scripture?” On which an honest Dissenter remarks—“Surely they had a wonderful opinion of their Service Book that there was not a tittle amiss in it.,” And scorn the swallow of that soul Which cannot boldly bolt the whole. Resolv'd, that, though St. Athanasius In damning souls is rather spacious— Though wide and far his curses fall, Our Church “hath stomach for them all;” And those who're not content with such, May e'en be d?d ten times as much. Resolv'd—such liberal souls are we— Though hating Nonconformity, We yet believe the cash no worse is That comes from Nonconformist purses. Indifferent whence the money reaches The pockets of our reverend breeches, To us the Jumper's jingling penny Chinks with a tone as sweet as any; And ev'n our old friends Yea and Nay May through the nose for ever pray, If also through the nose they'll pay. Resolv'd, that Hooper “They,” the Bishops, “know that the primitive Church had no such Bishops. If the fourth part of the bishopric remained unto the Bishop, it were sufficient.” —On the Commandments, p. 72., Latimer “Since the Prelates were made Lords and Nobles, the plough standeth, there is no work done, the people starve.” —Lat. Serm., And Cranmer “Of whom have come all these glorious titles, styles, and pomps into the Church. But I would that I, and all my brethren, the Bishops, would leave all our styles, and write the styles of our offices,” &amp;c. —Life of Cranmer, by Strype, Appendix., all extremely err, In taking such a low-bred view Of what Lords Spiritual ought to do:— All owing to the fact, poor men, That Mother Church was modest then, Nor knew what golden eggs her goose, The Public, would in time produce. One Pisgah peep at modern Durham To far more lordly thoughts would stir 'em. Resolv'd, that when we, Spiritual Lords, Whose income just enough affords To keep our Spiritual Lordships cozy, Are told, by Antiquarians prosy, How ancient Bishops cut up theirs, Giving the poor the largest shares— Our answer is, in one short word, We think it pious, but absurd. Those good men made the world their debtor, But we, the Church reform'd, know better; And, taking all that all can pay, Balance the' account the other way. Resolv'd, our thanks profoundly due are To last month's Quarterly Reviewer, Who proves (by arguments so clear One sees how much he holds per year) That England's Church, though out of date, Must still be left to lie in state, As dead, as rotten, and as grand as The mummy of King Osymandyas, All pickled snug—the brains drawn out Part of the process of embalmment.— With costly cerements swathed about,— And “Touch me not,” those words terrific, Scrawl'd o'er her in good hieroglyphic. SIR ANDREW'S DREAM. “Nec tu sperne piis venientia somnia portis: Cum pia venerunt somnia, pondus habent.” Propert. lib. iv. eleg. 7. As snug, on a Sunday eve, of late, In his easy chair Sir Andrew sate, Being much too pious, as every one knows, To do aught, of a Sunday eve, but doze, He dreamt a dream, dear, holy man, And I'll tell you his dream as well as I can. He found himself, to his great amaze, In Charles the First's high Tory days, And just at the time that gravest of Courts Had publish'd its Book of Sunday Sports. The Book of Sports drawn up by Bishop Moreton was first put forth in the reign of James I., 1618, and afterwards republished, at the advice of Laud, by Charles I., 1633, with an injunction that it should be “made public by order from the Bishops.” We find it therein declared, that “for his good people's recreation, his Majesty's pleasure was, that after the end of divine service they should not be disturbed, letted, or discouraged from any lawful recreations, such as dancing, either of men or women, archery for men, leaping, vaulting, or any such harmless recreations, nor having of May-games, Whitsunales, or Morris-dances, or setting up of May-poles, or other sports therewith used,” &amp;c.— Sunday Sports! what a thing for the ear Of Andrew, even in sleep, to hear!— It chanced to be, too, a Sabbath day, When the people from church were coming away; And Andrew with horror heard this song, As the smiling sinners flock'd along:— “Long life to the Bishops, hurrah! hurrah! “For a week of work and a Sunday of play “Make the poor man's life run merry away.” “The Bishops!” quoth Andrew, “Popish, I guess,” And he grinned with conscious holiness. But the song went on, and, to brim the cup Of poor Andy's grief, the fiddles struck up! “Come, take out the lasses—let's have a dance— “For the Bishops allow us to skip our fill, “Well knowing that no one's the more in advance “On the road to heaven, for standing still. “Oh, it never was meant that grim grimaces “Should sour the cream of a creed of love; “Or that fellows with long, disastrous faces, “Alone should sit among cherubs above. “Then hurrah for the Bishops, &amp;c. “For Sunday fun we never can fail, “When the Church herself each sport points out;— “There's May-games, archery, Whitsun-ale, “And a May-pole high to dance about. “Or, should we be for a pole hard driven, “Some lengthy saint, of aspect fell, “With his pockets on earth, and his nose in heaven, “Will do for a May-pole just as well “Then hurrah for the Bishops, hurrah! hurrah! “A week of work and a Sabbath of play “Make the poor man's life run merry away.” To Andy, who doesn't much deal in history, This Sunday scene was a downright mystery; And God knows where might have ended the joke, But, in trying to stop the fiddles, he woke. And the odd thing is (as the rumour goes) That since that dream—which, one would suppose, Should have made his godly stomach rise, Even more than ever, 'gainst Sunday pies— He has view'd things quite with different eyes; Is beginning to take, on matters divine, Like Charles and his Bishops, the sporting line— Is all for Christians jigging in pairs, As an interlude 'twixt Sunday prayers;— Nay, talks of getting Archbishop H?l?y To bring in a Bill, enacting duly, That all good Protestants, from this date, May, freely and lawfully, recreate, Of a Sunday eve, their spirits moody, With Jack in the Straw, or Punch and Judy. A BLUE LOVE-SONG. TO MISS ?. Air.—“Come live with me and be my love.” Come wed with me, and we will write, My Blue of Blues, from morn till night. Chased from our classic souls shall be All thoughts of vulgar progeny; And thou shalt walk through smiling rows Of chubby duodecimos, While I, to match thy products nearly, Shall lie-in of a quarto yearly. 'Tis true, ev'n books entail some trouble; But live productions give one double. Correcting children is such bother,— While printers' dev'ls correct the other. Just think, my own Malthusian dear, How much more decent 'tis to hear From male or female—as it may be— “How is your book?” than “How's your baby?” And, whereas physic and wet nurses Do much exhaust paternal purses, Our books, if rickety, may go And be well dry-nurs'd in the Row; And, when God wills to take them hence, Are buried at the Row's expense. Besides, (as 'tis well prov'd by thee, In thy own Works, vol. 93.) The march, just now, of population So much outstrips all moderation, That ev'n prolific herring-shoals Keep pace not with our erring souls. See “Ella of Garveloch.”—Garveloch being a place where there was a large herring-fishery, but where, as we are told by the author, “the people increased much faster than the produce.” Oh far more proper and well-bred To stick to writing books instead; And show the world how two Blue lovers Can coalesce, like two book-covers, (Sheep-skin, or calf, or such wise leather,) Letter'd at back, and stitch'd together, Fondly as first the binder fix'd 'em, With nought but—literature betwixt 'em. SUNDAY ETHICS. A SCOTCH ODE. Puir, profligate Londoners, having heard tell That the De'il's got amang ye, and fearing 'tis true, We ha' sent ye a mon wha's a match for his spell, A chiel o'our ain, that the De'il himsel Will be glad to keep clear of, one Andrew Agnew. So, at least, ye may reckon, for ane day entire In ilka lang week ye'll be tranquil eneugh, As Auld Nick, do him justice, abhors a Scotch squire, An' would sooner gae roast by his ain kitchen fire Than pass a hale Sunday wi' Andrew Agnew. For, bless the gude mon, gin he had his ain way, He'd na let a cat on the Sabbath say “mew;” Nae birdie maun whistle, nae lambie maun play, An' Phœbus himsel could na travel that day, As he'd find a new Joshua in Andie Agnew. Only hear, in your Senate, how awfu' he cries, “Wae, wae to a'sinners who boil an' who stew! “Wae, wae to a'eaters o'Sabbath-bak'd pies, “For as surely again shall the crust thereof rise “In judgment against ye,” saith Andrew Agnew! Ye may think, from a'this, that our Andie's the lad To ca' o'er the coals your nobeelity, too; That their drives, o'a Sunday, wi' flunkies Servants in livery., a'clad Like Shawmen, behind 'em, would mak the mon mad— But he's nae sic a noodle, our Andie Agnew. If Lairds an' fine Ladies, on Sunday, think right To gang to the deevil—as maist o'em do— To stop them our Andie would think na polite; And 'tis odds (if the chiel could get ony thing by't) But he'd follow 'em, booing For the “gude effects and uteelity of booing,” see the Man of the World., would Andrew Agnew. AWFUL EVENT. Yes, W?nch?ls?a (I tremble while I pen it), W?nch?ls?a's Earl hath cut the British Senate— Hath said to England's Peers, in accent gruff, “That for ye all” [snapping his fingers], and exit, in a huff! Disastrous news!—like that, of old, which spread From shore to shore, “our mighty Pan is dead,” O'er the cross benches (cross from being crost) Sounds the loud wail, “Our W?nch?ls?a is lost!” Which of ye, Lords, that heard him, can forget The deep impression of that awful threat, “I quit your house!!”—'midst all that histories tell, I know but one event that's parallel:— It chanc'd at Drury Lane, one Easter night, When the gay gods, too blest to be polite, Gods at their ease, like those of learn'd Lucretius, Laugh'd, whistled, groan'd, uproariously facetious— A well-dress'd member of the middle gallery, Whose “ears polite” disdain'd such low canaillerie, Rose in his place—so grand, you'd almost swear Lord W?nch?ls?a himself stood towering there— And like that Lord of dignity and nous, Said, “Silence, fellows, or—I'll leave the house!!” How brook'd the gods this speech? Ah well-a-day, That speech so fine should be so thrown away! In vain did this mid-gallery grandee Assert his own two-shilling dignity— In vain he menac'd to withdraw the ray Of his own full-price countenance away— Fun against Dignity is fearful odds, And as the Lords laugh now, so giggled then the gods! THE NUMBERING OF THE CLERGY. PARODY ON SIR CHARLES HAN. WILLIAMS'S FAMOUS ODE, “COME, CLOE, AND GIVE ME SWEET KISSES.” “We want more Churches and more Clergymen.” Bishop of London's late Charge. “Rectorum numerum, terris pereuntibus, augent.” Claudian in Eutrop. Come, give us more Livings and Rectors, For, richer no realm ever gave; But why, ye unchristian objectors, Do ye ask us how many we crave? Come, Cloe, and give me sweet kisses, For sweeter sure never girl gave; But why, in the midst of my blisses, Do you ask me how many I'd have? Oh, there can't be too many rich Livings For souls of the Pluralist kind, Who, despising old Cocker's misgivings, To numbers can ne'er be confin'd. For whilst I love thee above measure, To numbers I'll ne'er be confin'd. Count the cormorants hovering about Count the bees that on Hybla are playing, Count the flowers that enamel its fields, Count the flocks, &amp;c., At the time their fish season sets in, When these models of keen diners-out Are preparing their beaks to begin. Count the rooks that, in clerical dresses, Flock round when the harvest's in play, And, not minding the farmer's distresses, Like devils in grain peck away. Go, number the locusts in heaven Go number the stars in the heaven, Count how many sands on the shore; When so many kisses you've given, I still shall be craving for more., On their way to some titheable shore; And when so many Parsons you've given, We still shall be craving for more. Then, unless ye the Church would submerge, ye Must leave us in peace to augment For the wretch who could number the Clergy, With few will be ever content. But the wretch who can number his kisses, With few will be ever content. A SAD CASE. “If it be the undergraduate season at which this rabies religiosa is to be so fearful, what security has Mr. G?lb?n against it at this moment, when his son is actually exposed to the full venom of an association with Dissenters?” —The Times, March 25. How sad a case!—just think of it— If G?lb?n junior should be bit By some insane Dissenter, roaming Through Granta's halls, at large and foaming, And with that aspect, ultra crabbed Which marks Dissenters when they're rabid! God only knows what mischiefs might Result from this one single bite, Or how the venom, once suck'd in, Might spread and rage through kith and kin. Mad folks, of all denominations, First turn upon their own relations: So that one G?lb?n, fairly bit, Might end in maddening the whole kit, Till, ah, ye gods, we'd have to rue Our G?lb?n senior bitten too; The Hychurchphobia in those veins, Where Tory blood now redly reigns;— And that dear man, who now perceives Salvation only in lawn sleeves, Might, tainted by such coarse infection, Run mad in the' opposite direction, And think, poor man, 'tis only given To linsey-woolsey to reach Heaven! Just fancy what a shock 'twould be Our G?lb?n in his fits to see, Tearing into a thousand particles His once-lov'd Nine and Thirty Articles; (Those Articles his friend, the Duke The Duke of Wellington, who styled them “the Articles of Christianity.”, For Gospel, t'other night, mistook;) Cursing cathedrals, deans, and singers— Wishing the ropes might hang the ringers— Pelting the church with blasphemies, Even worse than Parson B?v?rl?y's;— And ripe for severing Church and State, Like any creedless reprobate, Or like that class of Methodists Prince Waterloo styles “Atheists!” But 'tis too much—the Muse turns pale, And o'er the picture drops a veil, Praying, God save the G?lb?rns all From mad Dissenters, great and small! A DREAM OF HINDOSTAN. ? risum teneatis, amici. “The longer one lives, the more one learns, Said I, as off to sleep I went, Bemus'd with thinking of Tithe concerns, And reading a book, by the Bishop of Ferns An indefatigable scribbler of anti-Catholic pamphlets., On the Irish Church Establishment. But, lo, in sleep, not long I lay, When Fancy her usual tricks began, And I found myself bewitch'd away To a goodly city in Hindostan— A city, where he, who dares to dine On aught but rice, is deem'd a sinner; Where sheep and kine are held divine, And, accordingly—never drest for dinner. “But how is this?” I wondering cried— As I walk'd that city, fair and wide, And saw, in every marble street, A row of beautiful butchers' shops— “What means, for men who don't eat meat, “This grand display of loins and chops?” In vain I ask'd—'twas plain to see That nobody dar'd to answer me. So, on, from street to street I strode; And you can't conceive how vastly odd The butchers look'd—a roseate crew, Inshrin'd in stalls, with nought to do; While some on a bench, half dozing, sat, And the Sacred Cows were not more fat. Still pos'd to think, what all this scene Of sinecure trade was meant to mean, “And, pray,” ask'd I—“by whom is paid The expense of this strange masquerade?”— “The' expense!—oh, that's of course defray'd (Said one of these well-fed Hecatombers) “By yonder rascally rice-consumers.” “What! they, who mustn't eat meat!”— “No matter— (And, while he spoke, his cheeks grew fatter,) “The rogues may munch their Paddy crop, “But the rogues must still support our shop. “And, depend upon it, the way to treat “Heretical stomachs that thus dissent, “Is to burden all that wo'n't eat meat, “With a costly Meat Establishment.” On hearing these words so gravely said, With a volley of laughter loud I shook; And my slumber fled, and my dream was sped, And I found I was lying snug in bed, With my nose in the Bishop of Ferns' book. THE BRUNSWICK CLUB. A letter having been addressed to a very distinguished personage, requesting him to become the Patron of this Orange Club, a polite answer was forthwith returned, of which we have been fortunate enough to obtain a copy. Brimstone-hall, September 1. 1828. Private.—Lord Belzebub presents To the Brunswick Club his compliments, And much regrets to say that he Cannot, at present, their Patron be. In stating this, Lord Belzebub Assures, on his honour, the Brunswick Club, That 'tisn't from any lukewarm lack Of zeal or fire he thus holds back— As ev'n Lord Coal Usually written “Cole.” himself is not For the Orange party more red-hot: But the truth is, till their Club affords A somewhat decenter show of Lords, And on its list of members gets A few less rubbishy Baronets, Lord Belzebub must beg to be Excused from keeping such company. Who the devil, he humbly begs to know, Are Lord Gl?nd?ne, and Lord D?nlo? Or who, with a grain of sense, would go To sit and be bored by Lord M?yo? What living creature—except his nurse— For Lord M?ntc?sh?l cares a curse, Or thinks 'twould matter if Lord M?sk?rry Were t'other side of the Stygian ferry? Breathes there a man in Dublin town, Who'd give but half of half-a-crown To save from drowning my Lord R?thd?ne, Or who wouldn't also gladly hustle in Lords R?d?n, B?nd?n, C?le, and J?c?l?n? In short, though, from his tenderest years, Accustom'd to all sorts of Peers, Lord Belzebub much questions whether He ever yet saw, mix'd together, As 'twere in one capacious tub, Such a mess of noble silly-bub As the twenty Peers of the Brunswick Club. 'Tis therefore impossible that Lord B. Could stoop to such society, Thinking, he owns (though no great prig), For one in his station 'twere infra dig. But he begs to propose, in the interim (Till they find some prop'rer Peers for him), His Highness of C?mb?d, as Sub, To take his place at the Brunswick Club— Begging, meanwhile, himself to dub Their obedient servant, Belzebub. It luckily happens, the R?y?l Duke Resembles so much, in air and look, The head of the Belzebub family, That few can any difference see; Which makes him, of course, the better suit To serve as Lord B.'s substitute. PROPOSALS FOR A GYNÆCOCRACY. ADDRESSED TO A LATE RADICAL MEETING. ? “Quas ipsa decus sibi dia Camilla Delegit pacisque bonas bellique ministras.” Virgil. As Whig Reform has had its range, And none of us are yet content, Suppose, my friends, by way of change, We try a Female Parliament; And since, of late, with he M. P.'s We've fared so badly, take to she's— Petticoat patriots, flounc'd John Russells, Burdetts in blonde, and Broughams in bustles. The plan is startling, I confess— But 'tis but an affair of dress; Nor see I much there is to choose 'Twixt Ladies (so they're thorough bred ones) In ribands of all sorts of hues, Or Lords in only blue or red ones. At least, the fiddlers will be winners, Whatever other trade advances; As then, instead of Cabinet dinners, We'll have, at Almack's, Cabinet dances; Nor let this world's important questions Depend on Ministers' digestions. If Ude's receipts have done things ill, To Weippert's band they may go better; There's Lady ?, in one quadrille, Would settle Europe, if you'd let her: And who the deuce or asks, or cares, When Whigs or Tories have undone 'em, Whether they've danc'd through State affairs, Or simply, dully, din'd upon 'em? Hurrah then for the Petticoats! To them we pledge our free-born votes; We'll have all she, and only she— Pert blues shall act as “best debaters,” Old dowagers our Bishops be, And termagants our Agitators. If Vestris, to oblige the nation, Her own Olympus will abandon, And help to prop the' Administration, It can't have better legs to stand on. The fam'd Macaulay (Miss) shall show, Each evening, forth in learn'd oration; Shall move (midst general cries of “Oh!”) For full returns of population: And, finally, to crown the whole, The Princess Olive A personage, so styling herself, who attained considerable notoriety at that period., Royal soul, Shall from her bower in Banco Regis, Descend, to bless her faithful lieges, And, mid our Unions' loyal chorus, Reign jollily for ever o'er us. LORD H?NL?Y AND ST. CECILIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ?. Sir, Having heard some rumours respecting the strange and awful visitation under which Lord H?nl?y has for some time past been suffering, in consequence of his declared hostility to “anthems, solos, duets In a work, on Church Reform, published by his Lordship in 1832.,” &amp;c., I took the liberty of making inquiries at his Lordship's house this morning, and lose no time in transmitting to you such particulars as I could collect. It is said that the screams of his Lordship, under the operation of this nightly concert, (which is, no doubt, some trick of the Radicals,) may be heard all over the neighbourhood. The female who personates St. Cecilia is supposed to be the same that, last year, appeared in the character of Isis, at the Rotunda. How the cherubs are managed, I have not yet ascertained. Yours, &amp;c. P. P. ? in Metii descendat Judicis aures. Horat. As snug in his bed Lord H?nl?y lay, Revolving much his own renown, And hoping to add thereto a ray, By putting duets and anthems down, Sudden a strain of choral sounds Mellifluous o'er his senses stole; Whereat the Reformer mutter'd, “Zounds!” For he loath'd sweet music with all his soul. Then, starting up, he saw a sight That well might shock so learn'd a snorer— Saint Cecilia, rob'd in light, With a portable organ slung before her. And round were Cherubs, on rainbow wings, Who, his Lordship fear'd, might tire of flitting, So begg'd they'd sit—but ah! poor things, They'd, none of them, got the means of sitting. “Asseyez-vous, mes enfans.”—“Il n'y a pas de quoi, mon Seigneur.” “Having heard,” said the Saint, “you're fond of hymns, “And indeed, that musical snore betray'd you, “Myself, and my choir of cherubims, “Are come, for a while, to serenade you.” In vain did the horrified H?nl?y say “'Twas all a mistake”—“she was misdirected;” And point to a concert, over the way, Where fiddlers and angels were expected. In vain—the Saint could see in his looks (She civilly said) much tuneful lore; So, at once, all open'd their music-books, And herself and her Cherubs set off at score. All night duets, terzets, quartets, Nay, long quintets most dire to hear; Ay, and old motets, and canzonets, And glees, in sets, kept boring his ear. He tried to sleep—but it wouldn't do; So loud they squall'd, he must attend to 'em; Though Cherubs' songs, to his cost he knew, Were like themselves, and had no end to 'em. Oh judgment dire on judges bold, Who meddle with music's sacred strains! Judge Midas tried the same of old, And was punish'd, like H?nl?y, for his pains. But worse on the modern judge, alas! Is the sentence launch'd from Apollo's throne; For Midas was given the ears of an ass, While H?nl?y is doom'd to keep his own! ADVERTISEMENT. Written at that memorable crisis when a distinguished Duke, then Prime Minister, acting under the inspirations of Sir Cl?d?s H?nt?r and other City worthies, advised his Majesty to give up his announced intention of dining with the Lord Mayor. 1830. Missing or lost, last Sunday night, A Waterloo coin, whereon was trac'd The' inscription, “Courage!” in letters bright, Though a little by rust of years defac'd. The metal thereof is rough and hard, And ('tis thought of late) mix'd up with brass; But it bears the stamp of Fame's award, And through all Posterity's hands will pass. How it was lost, God only knows, But certain City thieves, they say, Broke in on the owner's evening doze, And filch'd this “gift of gods” away! One ne'er could, of course, the Cits suspect, If we hadn't, that evening, chanc'd to see, At the robb'd man's door, a Mare elect, With an ass to keep her company. Whosoe'er of this lost treasure knows, Is begg'd to state all facts about it, As the owner can't well face his foes, Nor ev'n his friends, just now, without it. And if Sir Clod will bring it back, Like a trusty Baronet, wise and able, He shall have a ride on the whitest hack Among other remarkable attributes by which Sir Cl?d?s distinguished himself, the dazzling whiteness of his favourite steed was not the least conspicuous. That's left in old King George's stable. MISSING. Carlton Terrace, 1832. Whereas, Lord ?????? de ??????? Left his home last Saturday, And, though inquir'd for, round and round, Through certain purlieus, can't be found; And whereas, none can solve our queries As to where this virtuous Peer is, Notice is hereby giv'n, that all May forthwith to inquiring fall, As, once the thing's well set about, No doubt but we shall hunt him out. His Lordship's mind, of late, they say, Hath been in an uneasy way. Himself and colleagues not being let To climb into the Cabinet, To settle England's state affairs, Hath much, it seems, unsettled theirs; And chief to this stray Plenipo Hath been a most distressing blow. Already,—certain to receive a Well-paid mission to the Neva, And be the bearer of kind words To tyrant Nick from Tory Lords,— To fit himself for free discussion, His Lordship had been learning Russian; And all so natural to him were The accents of the Northern bear, That, while his tones were in your ear, you Might swear you were in sweet Siberia. And still, poor Peer, to old and young, He goes on raving in that tongue; Tells you how much you would enjoy a Trip to Dalnodoubrowskoya In the Government of Perm.; Talks of such places, by the score, on As Oulisfflirmchinagoboron Territory belonging to the mines of Kolivano-Kosskressense., And swears (for he at nothing sticks) That Russia swarms with Raskol-niks The name of a religious sect in Russia. “Il existe en Russie plusieurs sectes; la plus nombreuse est celle des Raskol-niks, ou vrai-croyants.” —Gamba, Voyage dans la Russie Meridionale., Though one such Nick, God knows, must be A more than ample quantity, Such are the marks by which to know This stray'd or stolen Plenipo; And whosoever brings or sends The unhappy statesman to his friends, On Carlton Terrace, shall have thanks, And—any paper but the Bank's. P. S.—Some think, the disappearance Of this our diplomatic Peer hence Is for the purpose of reviewing, In person, what dear Mig is doing So as to 'scape all tell-tale letters 'Bout B?s?d, and such abettors,— The only “wretches” for whose aid “Heav'n first taught letters for some wretch's aid.” Pope. Letters seem not to have been made. THE DANCE OF BISHOPS; OR, THE EPISCOPAL QUADRILLE. Written on the passing of the memorable Bill, in the year 1833, for the abolition of ten Irish Bishoprics. A DREAM. 1833. “Solemn dances were, on great festivals and celebrations, admitted among the primitive Christians, in which even the Bishops and dignified Clergy were performers. Scaliger says, that the first Bishops were called Præsules Literally, First Dancers. for no other reason than that they led off these dances.” —Cyclopædia, art. Dances. I've had such a dream—a frightful dream— Though funny, mayhap, to wags 'twill seem, By all who regard the Church, like us, 'Twill be thought exceedingly ominous! As reading in bed I lay last night— Which (being insured) is my delight— I happen'd to doze off just as I got to The singular fact which forms my motto. Only think, thought I, as I doz'd away, Of a party of Churchmen dancing the hay! Clerks, curates, and rectors, capering all, With a neat-legg'd Bishop to open the ball! Scarce had my eyelids time to close, When the scene I had fancied before me rose— An Episcopal Hop, on a scale so grand As my dazzled eyes could hardly stand. For, Britain and Erin clubb'd their Sees To make it a Dance of Dignities, And I saw—oh brightest of Church events! A quadrille of the two Establishments, Bishop to Bishop vis-à-vis, Footing away prodigiously. There was Bristol capering up to Derry, And Cork with London making merry; While huge Llandaff, with a See, so so, Was to dear old Dublin pointing his toe. There was Chester, hatch'd by woman's smile, Performing a chaine des Dames in style; While he who, whene'er the Lords' House dozes, Can waken them up by citing Moses “And what does Moses say?”—One of the ejaculations with which this eminent prelate enlivened his famous speech on the Catholic question., The portly Tuam, was all in a hurry To set, en avant, to Canterbury. Meantime, while pamphlets stuff'd his pockets, (All out of date, like spent sky-rockets,) Our Exeter stood forth to caper, As high on the floor as he doth on paper— Much like a dapper Dancing Dervise, Who pirouettes his whole church-service— Performing, 'midst those reverend souls, Such entrechats, such cabrioles, Such balonnés A description of the method of executing this step may be useful to future performers in the same line:—“Ce pas est composé de deux mouvemens différens savoir, plier, et sauter sur un pied, et se rejeter sur l'autre.” —Dictionnaire de Danse, art. Contre-temps., such—rigmaroles, Now high, now low, now this, now that, That none could guess what the dev'l he'd be at; Though, watching his various steps, some thought That a step in the Church was all he sought. But alas, alas! while thus so gay, These rev'rend dancers frisk'd away, Nor Paul himself (not the saint, but he Of the Opera-house) could brisker be, There gather'd a gloom around their glee— A shadow, which came and went so fast, That ere one could say “'Tis there,” 'twas past— And, lo, when the scene again was clear'd, Ten of the dancers had disappear'd! Ten able-bodied quadrillers swept From the hallow'd floor where late they stept, While twelve was all that footed it still, On the Irish side of that grand Quadrille! Nor this the worst:—still danc'd they on, But the pomp was sadden'd, the smile was gone; And again, from time to time, the same Ill-omened darkness round them came— While still, as the light broke out anew, Their ranks look'd less by a dozen or two; Till ah! at last there were only found Just Bishops enough for a four-hands-round; And when I awoke, impatient getting, I left the last holy pair poussetting! N. B.—As ladies in years, it seems, Have the happiest knack at solving dreams, I shall leave to my ancient feminine friends Of the Standard to say what this portends. DICK ????. A CHARACTER. Of various scraps and fragments built, Borrow'd alike from fools and wits, Dick's mind was like a patchwork quilt, Made up of new, old, motley bits— Where, if the Co. call'd in their shares, If petticoats their quota got, And gowns were all refunded theirs, The quilt would look but shy, God wot. And thus he still, new plagiaries seeking, Revers'd ventriloquism's trick, For, 'stead of Dick through others speaking, 'Twas others we heard speak through Dick. A Tory now, all bounds exceeding, Now best of Whigs, now worst of rats; One day, with Malthus, foe to breeding, The next, with Sadler, all for brats. Poor Dick!—and how else could it be? With notions all at random caught, A sort of mental fricassee, Made up of legs and wings of thought— The leavings of the last Debate, or A dinner, yesterday, of wits, Where Dick sate by and, like a waiter, Had the scraps for perquisites. A CORRECTED REPORT OF SOME LATE SPEECHES. “Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that saint.” 1834. St. S?ncl?r rose and declar'd in sooth. That he wouldn't give sixpence to Maynooth. He had hated priests the whole of his life, For a priest was a man who had no wife “He objected to the maintenance and education of a clergy bound by the particular vows of celibacy, which, as it were, gave them the church as their only family, making it fill the places of father and mother and brother.” —Debate on the Grant to Maynooth College, The Times, April 19., And, having no wife, the Church was his mother, The Church was his father, sister, and brother. This being the case, he was sorry to say, That a gulf 'twixt Papist and Protestant lay “It had always appeared to him that between the Catholic and Protestant a great gulf intervened, which rendered it impossible,” &amp;c., So deep and wide, scarce possible was it To say even “how d'ye do?” across it: And though your Liberals, nimble as fleas, Could clear such gulfs with perfect ease, 'Twas a jump that nought on earth could make Your proper, heavy-built Christian take. No, no,—if a Dance of Sects must be, He would set to the Baptist willingly “The Baptist might acceptably extend the offices of religion to the Presbyterian and the Independent, or the member of the Church of England to any of the other three; but the Catholic,” &amp;c., At the Independent deign to smirk, And rigadoon with old Mother Kirk; Nay ev'n, for once, if needs must be, He'd take hands round with all the three; But, as to a jig with Popery, no,— To the Harlot ne'er would he point his toe. St. M?nd?v?le was the next that rose,— A Saint who round, as pedlar, goes, With his pack of piety and prose, Heavy and hot enough, God knows,— And he said that Papists were much inclin'd To extirpate all of Protestant kind, Which he couldn't, in truth, so much condemn, Having rather a wish to extirpate them; That is,—to guard against mistake,— To extirpate them for their doctrine's sake; A distinction Churchmen always make,— Insomuch that, when they've prime control, Though sometimes roasting heretics whole, They but cook the body for sake of the soul. Next jump'd St. J?hnst?n jollily forth, The spiritual Dogberry of the North “Could he then, holding as he did a spiritual office in the Church of Scotland, (cries of hear, and laughter,) with any consistency give his consent to a grant of money?” &amp;c., A right “wise fellow, and, what's more, An officer “I am a wise fellow, and which is more, an officer.” Much Ado about Nothing.,” like his type of yore; And he ask'd, if we grant such toleration, Pray, what's the use of our Reformation? “What, he asked, was the use of the Reformation? What was the use of the Articles of the Church of England, or of the Church of Scotland?” &amp;c. What is the use of our Church and State? Our Bishops, Articles, Tithe, and Rate? And, still as he yell'd out “what's the use?” Old Echoes, from their cells recluse Where they'd for centuries slept, broke loose, Yelling responsive, “What's the use?” MORAL POSITIONS, A DREAM. “His Lordship said that it took a long time for a moral position to find its way across the Atlantic. He was very sorry that its voyage had been so long,” &amp;c.—Speech of Lord Dudley and Ward on Colonial Slavery, March 8. T'other night, after hearing Lord Dudley's oration (A treat that comes once a-year as May-day does), I dreamt that I saw—what a strange operation! A “moral position” shipp'd off for Barbadoes. The whole Bench of Bishops stood by in grave attitudes, Packing the article tidy and neat;— As their Rev'rences know, that in southerly latitudes “Moral positions” don't keep very sweet. There was B?th?st arranging the custom-house pass; And, to guard the frail package from tousing and routing, There stood my Lord Eld?n, endorsing it “Glass,” Though as to which side should lie uppermost, doubting. The freight was, however, stow'd safe in the hold; The winds were polite, and the moon look'd romantic, While off in the good ship “The Truth” we were roll'd, With our ethical cargo, across the Atlantic. Long, dolefully long, seem'd the voyage we made; For “The Truth,” at all times but a very slow sailer, By friends, near as much as by foes, is delay'd, And few come aboard her, though so many hail her. At length, safe arrived, I went through “tare and tret,’ Deliver'd my goods in the primest condition, And next morning read, in the Bridgetown Gazette, “Just arrived by ‘The Truth,’ a new moral position. “The Captain”—here, startled to find myself nam'd As “the Captain”—(a thing which, I own it with pain, I through life have avoided,) I woke—look'd asham'd, Found I wasn't a captain, and doz'd off again. THE MAD TORY AND THE COMET. FOUNDED ON A LATE DISTRESSING INCIDENT. 1832–3. “Mutantem regna cometem.” Lucan. Eclipses and comets have been always looked to as great changers of administrations. Thus Milton, speaking of the former:— “With fear of change Perplexing monarchs.” And in Statius we find, “Mutant quæ sceptra cometæ.” “Though all the pet mischiefs we count upon, fail, “Though Cholera, hurricanes, Wellington leave us, “We've still in reserve, mighty Comet, thy tail;— “Last hope of the Tories, wilt thou too deceive us? “No—'tis coming, 'tis coming, th' avenger is nigh; “Heed, heed not, ye placemen, how Herapath flatters; “One whisk from that tail, as it passes us by, “Will settle, at once, all political matters;— “The East-India Question, the Bank, the Five Powers, “(Now turn'd into two) with their rigmarole Protocols See, for some of these Protocols, the Annual Register, for the year 1832.;— “Ha! ha! ye gods, how this new friend of ours “Will knock, right and left, all diplomacy's what-d'ye-calls! “Yes, rather than Whigs at our downfall should mock, “Meet planets, and suns, in one general hustle! “While, happy in vengeance, we welcome the shock “That shall jerk from their places, Grey, Althorp, and Russell.” Thus spoke a mad Lord, as, with telescope rais'd, His wild Tory eye on the heavens he set; And, though nothing destructive appear'd as he gaz'd, Much hop'd that there would, before Parliament met. And still, as odd shapes seem'd to flit through his glass, “Ha! there it is now,” the poor maniac cries; While his fancy with forms but too monstrous, alas! From his own Tory zodiac, peoples the skies:— “Now I spy a big body, good heavens, how big! “Whether Bucky The D?e of B?ck?m. or Taurus I cannot well say:— “And, yonder, there's Eld?n's old Chancery-wig, “In its dusty aphelion fast fading away. “I see, 'mong those fatuous meteors behind, “L?nd?nd?ry, in vacuo, flaring about;— “While that dim double star, of the nebulous kind, “Is the Gemini, R?den and L?rt?n, no doubt. “Ah, El?b'r?h! 'faith, I first thought 'twas the Comet; “So like that in Milton, it made me quite pale; “The head with the same ‘horrid hair’ Shakes pestilence and war.” coming from it, “And plenty of vapour, but—where is the tail?” Just then, up aloft jump'd the gazer elated— For, lo, his bright glass a phenomenon show'd, Which he took to be C?mb?rl?d, upwards translated, Instead of his natural course, t'other road! But too awful that sight for a spirit so shaken,— Down dropp'd the poor Tory in fits and grimaces, Then off to the Bedlam in Charles Street was taken, And is now one of Halford's most favourite cases. FROM THE HON. HENRY ?, TO LADY EMMA ?. Paris, March 30. 1832. You bid me explain, my dear angry Ma'amselle, How I came thus to bolt without saying farewell; And the truth is,—as truth you will have, my sweet railer,— There are two worthy persons I always feel loth To take leave of at starting,—my mistress and tailor,— As somehow one always has scenes with them both; The Snip in ill-humour, the Syren in tears, She calling on Heaven, and he on the' attorney,— Till sometimes, in short, 'twixt his duns and his dears, A young gentleman risks being stopp'd in his journey. But, to come to the point,—though you think, I dare say, That 'tis debt or the Cholera drives me away, 'Pon honour you're wrong;—such a mere bagatelle As a pestilence, nobody, now-a-days, fears; And the fact is, my love, I'm thus bolting, pell-mell, To get out of the way of these horrid new Peers A new creation of Peers was generally expected at this time.; This deluge of coronets, frightful to think of, Which England is now, for her sins, on the brink of; This coinage of nobles,—coin'd, all of 'em, badly, And sure to bring Counts to a discount most sadly. Only think, to have Lords overrunning the nation, As plenty as frogs in a Dutch inundation; No shelter from Barons, from Earls no protection, And tadpole young Lords, too, in every direction,— Things created in haste, just to make a Court list of, Two legs and a coronet all they consist of! The prospect's quite frightful, and what Sir George R?se (My particular friend) says is perfectly true, That, so dire the alternative, nobody knows, 'Twixt the Peers and the Pestilence, what he's to do; And Sir George even doubts,—could he choose his disorder,— 'Twixt coffin and coronet, which he would order. This being the case, why, I thought, my dear Emma, 'Twere best to fight shy of so curs'd a dilemma; And though I confess myself somewhat a villain, To've left idol mio without an addio, Console your sweet heart, and, a week hence, from Milan I'll send you—some news of Bellini's last trio. N. B.—Have just pack'd up my travelling set-out, Things a tourist in Italy can't go without— Viz., a pair of gants gras, from old Houbigant's shop, Good for hands that the air of Mont Cenis might chap. Small presents for ladies,—and nothing so wheedles The creatures abroad as your golden-ey'd needles. A neat pocket Horace, by which folks are cozen'd To think one knows Latin, when—one, perhaps, doesn't; With some little book about heathen mythology, Just large enough to refresh one's theology; Nothing on earth being half such a bore as Not knowing the diff'rence 'twixt Virgins and Floras. Once more, love, farewell, best regards to the girls, And mind you beware of damp feet and new Earls. Henry. TRIUMPH OF BIGOTRY. “College.—We announced, in our last, that Lefroy and Shaw were returned. They were chaired yesterday; the Students of the College determined, it would seem, to imitate the mob in all things, harnessing themselves to the car, and the Masters of Arts bearing Orange flags and bludgeons before, beside, and behind the car.” Dublin Evening Post, Dec. 20. 1832. Ay, yoke ye to the bigots' car, Ye chos'n of Alma Mater's scions;— Fleet chargers drew the God of War, Great Cybele was drawn by lions, And Sylvan Pan, as Poets dream, Drove four young panthers in his team. Thus classical L?fr?y, for once, is, Thus, studious of a like turn-out, He harnesses young sucking dunces, To draw him, as their Chief, about, And let the world a picture see Of Dulness yok'd to Bigotry: Showing us how young College hacks Can pace with bigots at their backs, As though the cubs were born to draw Such luggage as L?fr?y and Sh?w. Oh shade of Goldsmith, shade of Swift, Bright spirits whom, in days of yore, This Queen of Dulness sent adrift, As aliens to her foggy shore See the lives of these two poets for the circumstances under which they left Dublin College.;— Shade of our glorious Grattan, too, Whose very name her shame recalls; Whose effigy her bigot crew Revers'd upon their monkish walls In the year 1799, the Board of Trinity College, Dublin, thought proper, as a mode of expressing their disapprobation of Mr. Grattan's public conduct, to order his portrait, in the Great Hall of the University, to be turned upside down, and in this position it remained for some time.,— Bear witness (lest the world should doubt) To your mute Mother's dull renown, Then famous but for Wit turn'd out, And Eloquence turn'd upside down; But now ordain'd new wreaths to win, Beyond all fame of former days, By breaking thus young donkies in To draw M.P.s, amid the brays Alike of donkies and M.A.s;— Defying Oxford to surpass 'em In this new “Gradus ad Parnassum.” TRANSLATION FROM THE GULL LANGUAGE. Scripta manet. 1833. 'Twas graved on the Stone of Destiny Liafail, or the Stone of Destiny,—for which see Westminster Abbey., In letters four, and letters three; And ne'er did the King of the Gulls go by But those awful letters scar'd his eye; For he knew that a Prophet Voice had said, “As long as those words by man were read, “The ancient race of the Gulls should ne'er “One hour of peace or plenty share.” But years on years successive flew, And the letters still more legible grew,— At top, a T, an H, an E, And underneath, D. E. B. T. Some thought them Hebrew,—such as Jews, More skill'd in Scrip than Scripture, use; While some surmis'd 'twas an ancient way Of keeping accounts, (well known in the day Of the fam'd Didlerius Jeremias, Who had thereto a wonderful bias,) And prov'd in books most learn'dly boring, 'Twas called the Pontick way of scoring. Howe'er this be, there never were yet Seven letters of the alphabet, That, 'twixt them, form'd so grim a spell, Or scar'd a Land of Gulls so well, As did this awful riddle-me-ree Of T.H.E. D.E.B.T. Hark!—it is struggling Freedom's cry; “Help, help, ye nations, or I die; “'Tis Freedom's fight, and, on the field “Where I expire, your doom is seal'd.” The Gull-King hears the awakening call, He hath summon'd his Peers and Patriots all, And he asks, “Ye noble Gulls, shall we “Stand basely by at the fall of the Free, “Nor utter a curse, nor deal a blow?” And they answer, with voice of thunder, “No.” Out fly their flashing swords in the air!— But,—why do they rest suspended there? What sudden blight, what baleful charm, Hath chill'd each eye, and check'd each arm? Alas! some withering hand hath thrown The veil from off that fatal stone, And pointing now, with sapless finger, Showeth where dark those letters linger,— Letters four, and letters three, T.H.E. D.E.B.T. At sight thereof, each lifted brand Powerless falls from every hand; In vain the Patriot knits his brow,— Even talk, his staple, fails him now. In vain the King like a hero treads, His Lords of the Treasury shake their heads; And to all his talk of “brave and free,” No answer getteth His Majesty But “T.H.E. D.E.B.T.” In short, the whole Gull nation feels They're fairly spell-bound, neck and heels; And so, in the face of the laughing world, Must e'en sit down, with banners furl'd, Adjourning all their dreams sublime Of glory and war to—some other time. NOTIONS ON REFORM. BY A MODERN REFORMER. Of all the misfortunes as yet brought to pass By this comet-like Bill, with its long tail of speeches, The saddest and worst is the schism which, alas! It has caused between W?th?r?l's waistcoat and breeches. Some symptoms of this Anti-Union propensity Had oft broken out in that quarter before; But the breach, since the Bill, has attain'd such immensity, Daniel himself could have scarce wish'd it more. Oh! haste to repair it, ye friends of good order, Ye Atw?ds and W?nns, ere the moment is past; Who can doubt that we tread upon Anarchy's border, When the ties that should hold men are loosening so fast? Make W?th?r?l yield to “some sort of Reform” (As we all must, God help us! with very wry faces); And loud as he likes let him bluster and storm About Corporate Rights, so he'll only wear braces. Should those he now sports have been long in possession, And, like his own borough, the worse for the wear, Advise him, at least, as a prudent concession To Intellect's progress, to buy a new pair. Oh! who that e'er saw him, when vocal he stands, With a look something midway 'twixt Filch's and Lockit's, While still, to inspire him, his deeply-thrust hands Keep jingling the rhino in both breeches-pockets— Who that ever has listen'd, through groan and through cough, To the speeches inspir'd by this music of pence,— But must grieve that there's any thing like falling off In that great nether source of his wit and his sense? Who that knows how he look'd when, with grace debonair, He began first to court—rather late in the season— Or when, less fastidious, he sat in the chair Of his old friend, the Nottingham Goddess of Reason It will be recollected that the learned gentleman himself boasted, one night, in the House of Commons, of having sat in the very chair which this allegorical lady had occupied.; That Goddess, whose borough-like virtue attracted All mongers in both wares to proffer their love; Whose chair like the stool of the Pythoness acted, As W?th?r?l's rants, ever since, go to prove Lucan's description of the effects of the tripod on the appearance and voice of the sitter, shows that the symptoms are, at least, very similar: Spumea tunc primum rabies vesana per ora Effluit ? tunc mœstus vastis ululatus in antris.; Who, in short, would not grieve, if a man of his graces Should go on rejecting, unwarn'd by the past, The “moderate Reform” of a pair of new braces, Till, some day,—he'll all fall to pieces at last. TORY PLEDGES. I pledge myself through thick and thin, To labour still, with zeal devout, To get the Outs, poor devils, in, And turn the Ins, the wretches, out. I pledge myself, though much bereft Of ways and means of ruling ill, To make the most of what are left, And stick to all that's rotten still. Though gone the days of place and pelf, And drones no more take all the honey, I pledge myself to cram myself With all I can of public money. To quarter on that social purse My nephews, nieces, sisters, brothers, Nor, so we prosper, care a curse How much 'tis at the' expense of others. I pledge myself, whenever Right And Might on any point divide, Not to ask which is black or white, But take, at once, the strongest side. For instance, in all Tithe discussions, I'm for the Reverend encroachers:— I loathe the Poles, applaud the Russians,— Am for the Squires, against the Poachers. Betwixt the Corn-Lords and the Poor I've not the slightest hesitation,— The People must be starv'd, t'insure The Land its due remuneration. I pledge myself to be no more With Ireland's wrongs bepros'd or shamm'd,— I vote her grievances a bore, So she may suffer, and be d?d. Or if she kick, let it console us, We still have plenty of red coats, To cram the Church, that general bolus, Down any giv'n amount of throats. I dearly love the Frankfort Diet,— Think newspapers the worst of crimes; And would, to give some chance of quiet, Hang all the writers of The Times; Break all their correspondents' bones, All authors of “Reply,” “Rejoinder,” From the Anti-Tory, Colonel J?es, To the Anti-Suttee, Mr. P?ynd?r. Such are the Pledges I propose; And though I can't now offer gold, There's many a way of buying those Who've but the taste for being sold. So here's, with three times three hurrahs, A toast, of which you'll not complain,— “Long life to jobbing; may the days “Of Peculation shine again!” ST. JEROME ON EARTH. FIRST VISIT. 1832. As St. Jerome, who died some ages ago, Was sitting, one day, in the shades below, “I've heard much of English bishops,” quoth he, “And shall now take a trip to earth, to see “How far they agree, in their lives and ways, “With our good old bishops of ancient days.” He had learn'd—but learn'd without misgivings— Their love for good living, and eke good livings; Not knowing (as ne'er having taken degrees) That good living means claret and fricassees, While its plural means simply—pluralities. “From all I hear,” said the innocent man, “They are quite on the good old primitive plan. “For wealth and pomp they little can care, “As they all say ‘No’ to the' Episcopal chair; “And their vestal virtue it well denotes “That they all, good men, wear petticoats.” Thus saying, post-haste to earth he hurries, And knocks at the' Archbishop of Canterbury's. The door was oped by a lackey in lace, Saying, “What's your business with his Grace?” “His Grace!” quoth Jerome—for posed was he, Not knowing what sort this Grace could be; Whether Grace preventing, Grace particular, Grace of that breed called Quinquarticular So called from the proceedings of the Synod of Dort.— In short, he rummag'd his holy mind, The' exact description of Grace to find, Which thus could represented be By a footman in full livery. At last, out loud in a laugh he broke, (For dearly the good saint lov'd his joke) Witness his well known pun on the name of his adversary Vigilantius, whom he calls facetiously Dormitantius. And said—surveying, as sly he spoke, The costly palace from roof to base— “Well, it isn't, at least, a saving Grace!” “Umph!” said the lackey, a man of few words, “Th' Archbishop is gone to the House of Lords.” “To the House of the Lord, you mean, my son, “For, in my time, at least, there was but one; “Unless such many-fold priests as these “Seek, ev'n in their Lord, pluralities!” The suspicion attached to some of the early Fathers of being Arians in their doctrine would appear to derive some confirmation from this passage. “No time for gab,” quoth the man in lace: Then, slamming the door in St. Jerome's face, With a curse to the single knockers all, Went to finish his port in the servants' hall, And propose a toast (humanely meant To include even Curates in its extent) “To all as serves the' Establishment.” ST. JEROME ON EARTH. SECOND VISIT. “This much I dare say, that, since lording and loitering hath come up, preaching hath come down, contrary to the Apostles' times. For they preached and lorded not: and now they lord and preach not ..... Ever since the Prelates were made Lords and Nobles, the plough standeth; there is no work done, the people starve.” —Latimer, Sermon of the Plough. “Once more,” said Jerome, “I'll run up and see How the Church goes on,”—and off set he. Just then the packet-boat, which trades Betwixt our planet and the shades, Had arrived below, with a freight so queer, “My eyes!” said Jerome, “what have we here?”— For he saw, when nearer he explor'd, They'd a cargo of Bishops' wigs aboard. “They are ghosts of wigs,” said Charon, “all, “Once worn by nobs Episcopal. The wig, which had so long formed an essential part of the dress of an English bishop, was at this time beginning to be dispensed with. “For folks on earth, who've got a store “Of cast off things they'll want no more, “Oft send them down, as gifts, you know, “To a certain Gentleman here below. “A sign of the times, I plainly see,” Said the Saint to himself as, pondering, he Sail'd off in the death-boat gallantly. Arriv'd on earth, quoth he, “No more “I'll affect a body, as before; “For I think I'd best, in the company “Of Spiritual Lords, a spirit be, “And glide, unseen, from See to See.” But oh! to tell what scenes he saw,— It was more than Rabelais' pen could draw. For instance, he found Ex?t?r, Soul, body, inkstand, all in a stir,— For love of God? for sake of King? For good of people?—no such thing; But to get for himself, by some new trick, A shove to a better bishoprick. He found that pious soul, Van M?ld?t, Much with his money-bags bewilder'd; Snubbing the Clerks of the Diocess See the Bishop's Letter to Clergy of his Diocese., Because the rogues showed restlessness At having too little cash to touch, While he so Christianly bears too much. He found old Sarum's wits as gone As his own beloved text in John 1 John, v. 7. A text which, though long given up by all the rest of the orthodox world, is still pertinaciously adhered to by this Right Reverend scholar.,— Text he hath prosed so long upon, That 'tis thought when ask'd, at the gate of heaven, His name, he'll answer “John, v. 7.” “But enough of Bishops I've had to-day,” Said the weary Saint,—“I must away. “Though I own I should like, before I go, “To see for once (as I'm ask'd below “If really such odd sights exist) “A regular six-fold Pluralist.” Just then he heard a general cry— “There's Doctor Hodgson galloping by!” “Ay, that's the man,” says the Saint, “to follow,” And off he sets, with a loud view-hollo, At Hodgson's heels, to catch, if he can, A glimpse of this singular plural man. But,—talk of Sir Boyle Roche's bird! It was a saying of the well-known Sir Boyle, that “a man could not be in two places at once, unless he was a bird.” To compare him with Hodgson is absurd. “Which way, sir, pray, is the doctor gone?”— “He is now at his living at Hillingdon.”— “No, no,—you're out, by many a mile, “He's away at his Deanery, in Carlisle.”— “Pardon me, sir; but I understand “He's gone to his living in Cumberland.”— “God bless me, no,—he can't be there; “You must try St. George's, Hanover Square.” Thus all in vain the Saint inquir'd, From living to living, mock'd and tir'd;— 'Twas Hodgson here, 'twas Hodgson there, 'Twas Hodgson nowhere, everywhere; Till, fairly beat, the Saint gave o'er, And flitted away to the Stygian shore, To astonish the natives under ground With the comical things he on earth had found. THOUGHTS ON TAR BARRELS. (Vide Description of a late Fête. The M?s of H?tf?d's Fête.—From dread of cholera his Lordship had ordered tar-barrels to be burned in every direction.) 1832. What a pleasing contrivance! how aptly devis'd 'Twixt tar and magnolias to puzzle one's noses! And how the tar-barrels must all be surpris'd To find themselves seated like “Love among roses!” What a pity we can't, by precautions like these, Clear the air of that other still viler infection; That radical pest, that old whiggish disease, Of which cases, true-blue, are in every direction. Stead of barrels, let's light up an Auto da Fé Of a few good combustible Lords of “the Club;” They would fume, in a trice, the Whig chol'ra away, And there's B?cky would burn like a barrel of bub. How R?d?n would blaze! and what rubbish throw out! A volcano of nonsense, in active display; While V?ne, as a butt, amidst laughter, would spout The hot nothings he's full of, all night and all day. And then, for a finish, there's C?mb?d's Duke,— Good Lord, how his chin-tuft would crackle in air! Unless (as is shrewdly surmised from his look) He's already bespoke for combustion elsewhere. THE CONSULTATION. These verses, as well as some others, that follow, (p. 148.) were extorted from me by that lamentable measure of the Whig ministry, the Irish Coercion Act. “When they do agree, their unanimity is wonderful.” The Critic. 1833. Scene discovers Dr. Whig and Dr. Tory in consultation. Patient on the floor between them. Dr. Whig. —This wild Irish patient does pester me so, That what to do with him, I'm curst if I know. I've promis'd him anodynes— Dr. Tory. Anodynes!—Stuff. Tie him down—gag him well—he'll be tranquil enough. That's my mode of practice. Dr. Whig. True, quite in your line, But unluckily not much, till lately, in mine. 'Tis so painful— Dr. Tory. —Pooh, nonsense—ask Ude how he feels, When, for Epicure feasts, he prepares his live eels, By flinging them in, 'twixt the bars of the fire, And letting them wriggle on there till they tire. He, too, says “'tis painful”—“quite makes his heart bleed.”— But “your eels are a vile, oleaginous breed.”— He would fain use them gently, but Cook'ry says “No,” And—in short—eels were born to be treated just so. This eminent artist, in the second edition of the work wherein he propounds this mode of purifying his eels, professes himself much concerned at the charge of inhumanity brought against his practice, but still begs leave respectfully to repeat that it is the only proper mode of preparing eels for the table. 'Tis the same with these Irish,—who're odder fish still,— Your tender Whig heart shrinks from using them ill; I, myself, in my youth, ere I came to get wise, Used, at some operations, to blush to the eyes;— But, in fact, my dear brother,—if I may make bold To style you, as Peachum did Lockit, of old,— We, Doctors, must act with the firmness of Ude, And, indifferent like him,—so the fish is but stew'd,— Must torture live Pats for the general good. [Here patient groans and kicks a little. Dr. Whig. —But what, if one's patient's so devilish perverse, That he wo'n't be thus tortur'd? Dr. Tory. Coerce, sir, coerce. You're a juv'nile performer, but once you begin, You can't think how fast you may train your hand in: And (smiling) who knows but old Tory may take to the shelf, With the comforting thought that, in place and in pelf, He's succeeded by one just as—bad as himself? Dr. Whig (looking flattered). —Why, to tell you the truth, I've a small matter here, Which you help'd me to make for my patient last year,— [Goes to a cupboard and brings out a strait-waistcoat and gag. And such rest I've enjoy'd from his raving, since then, That I've made up my mind he shall wear it again. Dr. Tory (embracing him). —Oh, charming!— My dear Doctor Whig, you're a treasure. Next to torturing, myself, to help you is a pleasure. [Assisting Dr. Whig. Give me leave—I've some practice in these mad machines; There—tighter—the gag in the mouth, by all means. Delightful!—all's snug—not a squeak need you fear,— You may now put your anodynes off till next year. [Scene closes. TO THE REV. CH?RL?S OV?RT?N, CURATE OF ROMALDKIRK. AUTHOR OF THE POETICAL PORTRAITURE OF THE CHURCH. See Edinburgh Review, No. 117. 1833. Sweet singer of Romaldkirk, thou who art reckon'd, By critics Episcopal, David the Second “Your Lordship,” says Mr. Ov?rt?n, in the Dedication of his Poem to the Bishop of Chester, “has kindly expressed your persuasion that my ‘Muse will always be a Muse of sacred song, and that it will be tuned as David's was.’”, If thus, as a Curate, so lofty your flight, Only think, in a Rectory, how you would write! Once fairly inspir'd by the “Tithe-crown'd Apollo,” (Who beats, I confess it, our lay Phœbus hollow, Having gotten, besides the old Nine's inspiration, The Tenth of all eatable things in creation,) There's nothing, in fact, that a poet like you, So be-nined and be-tenth'd, couldn't easily do. Round the lips of the sweet-tounged Athenian Sophocles. they say, While yet but a babe in his cradle he lay, Wild honey-bees swarm'd, as a presage to tell Of the sweet-flowing words that thence afterwards fell. Just so round our Ov?rt?n's cradle, no doubt, Tenth ducklings and chicks were seen flitting about; Goose embryos, waiting their doom'd decimation, Came, shadowing forth his adult destination, And small, sucking tithe-pigs, in musical droves, Announc'd the Church poet whom Chester approves. O Horace! when thou, in thy vision of yore, Didst dream that a snowy-white plumage came o'er Thy etherealis'd limbs, stealing downily on, Till, by Fancy's strong spell, thou wert turn'd to a swan ? album mutor in alitem Supernè: nascunturque læves Per digitos, humerosque plumæ., Little thought'st thou such fate could a poet befall, Without any effort of fancy, at all; Little thought'st thou the world would in Ov?rt?n find A bird, ready-made, somewhat different in kind, But as perfect as Michaelmas' self could produce, By gods yclept anser, by mortals a goose. SCENE FROM A PLAY, ACTED AT OXFORD, CALLED “MATRICULATION.” “It appears that when a youth of fifteen goes to be matriculated at Oxford, and is required first to subscribe Thirty-Nine Articles of Religious Belief, this only means that he engages himself afterwards to understand what is now above his comprehension; that he expresses no assent at all to what he signs; and that he is (or, ought to be) at full liberty, when he has studied the subject, to withdraw his provisional assent.” —Edinburgh Review, No. 120. 1834. [Boy discovered at a table, with the Thirty-Nine Articles before him.—Enter the Rt. Rev. Doctor Ph?llp?ts.] Doctor P. —There, my lad, lie the Articles— (Boy begins to count them) just thirty-nine— No occasion to count—you've now only to sign. At Cambridge, where folks are less High-church than we, The whole Nine-and-Thirty are lump'd into Three. Let's run o'er the items;—there's Justification, Predestination, and Supererogation,— Not forgetting Salvation and Creed Athanasian, Till we reach, at last, Queen Bess's Ratification. That's sufficient—now, sign—having read quite enough, You “believe in the full and true meaning thereof?” (Boy stares.) Oh, a mere form of words, to make things smooth and brief,— A commodious and short make-believe of belief, Which our Church has drawn up, in a form thus articular, To keep out, in general, all who're particular. But what's the boy doing? what! reading all through, And my luncheon fast cooling!—this never will do. Boy (poring over the Articles.) —Here are points which—pray, Doctor, what's “Grace of Congruity?” Doctor P. (sharply). —You'll find out, young sir, when you've more ingenuity. At present, by signing, you pledge yourself merely, Whate'er it may be, to believe it sincerely. Both in dining and signing we take the same plan,— First, swallow all down, then digest—as we can. Boy (still reading). —I've to gulp, I see, St. Athanasius's Creed, Which, I'm told, is a very tough morsel, indeed; As he damns— Doctor P. (aside). —Ay, and so would I, willingly, too, All confounded particular young boobies, like you. This comes of Reforming!—all's o'er with our land, When people wo'n't stand what they can't understand; Nor perceive that our ever-rever'd Thirty-Nine Were made, not for men to believe, but to sign. [Exit Dr. P. in a passion. LATE TITHE CASE. “Sic vos non vobis.” 1833. “The Vicar of B?mh?m desires me to state that, in consequence of the passing of a recent Act of Parliament, he is compelled to adopt measures which may by some be considered harsh or precipitate; but, in duty to what he owes to his successors, he feels bound to preserve the rights of the vicarage.” —Letter from Mr. S. Powell, August 6. No, not for yourselves, ye reverend men, Do you take one pig in every ten, But for Holy Church's future heirs, Who've an abstract right to that pig, as theirs;— The law supposing that such heirs male Are already seised of the pig, in tail. No, not for himself hath B?mh?m's priest His “well-belov'd” of their pennies fleec'd: But it is that, before his prescient eyes, All future Vicars of B?mh?m rise, With their embryo daughters, nephews, nieces, And 'tis for them the poor he fleeces. He heareth their voices, ages hence, Saying “Take the pig”—“oh take the pence;” The cries of little Vicarial dears, The unborn B?mh?mites, reach his ears; And, did he resist that soft appeal, He would not like a true-born Vicar feel. Thou, too, L?ndy of L?ck?ngt?n! A Rector true, if e'er there was one, Who, for sake of the L?ndies of coming ages, Gripest the tenths of labourers' wages. Fourteen agricultural labourers (one of whom received so little as six guineas for yearly wages, one eight, one nine, another ten guineas, and the best paid of the whole not more than 18l. annually) were all, in the course of the autumn of 1832, served with demands of tithe at the rate of 4d. in the 1l. sterling, on behalf of the Rev. F. L?dy, Rector of ?, &amp;c. &amp;c. —The Times, August, 1833. 'Tis true, in the pockets of thy small-clothes The claim'd “obvention One of the various general terms under which oblations, tithes, &amp;c. are comprised.” of four-pence goes; But its abstract spirit, unconfin'd, Spreads to all future Rector-kind, Warning them all to their rights to wake, And rather to face the block, the stake, Than give up their darling right to take. One grain of musk, it is said, perfumes (So subtle its spirit) a thousand rooms, And a single four-pence, pocketed well, Through a thousand rectors' lives will tell. Then still continue, ye reverend souls, And still as your rich Pactolus rolls, Grasp every penny on every side, From every wretch, to swell its tide: Remembering still what the Law lays down, In that pure poetic style of its own, “If the parson in esse submits to loss, he “Inflicts the same on the parson in posse.” FOOLS' PARADISE. DREAM THE FIRST. I have been, like Puck, I have been, in a trice, To a realm they call Fools' Paradise, Lying N. N. E. of the Land of Sense, And seldom bless'd with a glimmer thence. But they want it not in this happy place, Where a light of its own gilds every face; Or, if some wear a shadowy brow, 'Tis the wish to look wise,—not knowing how. Self-glory glistens o'er all that's there, The trees, the flowers have a jaunty air; The well-bred wind in a whisper blows, The snow, if it snows, is couleur de rose, The falling founts in a titter fall, And the sun looks simpering down on all. Oh, 'tisn't in tongue or pen to trace The scenes I saw in that joyous place. There were Lords and Ladies sitting together, In converse sweet, “What charming weather!— “You'll all rejoice to hear, I'm sure, “Lord Charles has got a good sinecure; “And the Premier says, my youngest brother “(Him in the Guards) shall have another. “Isn't this very, very gallant!— “As for my poor old virgin aunt, “Who has lost her all, poor thing, at whist, “We must quarter her on the Pension List.” Thus smoothly time in that Eden roll'd; It seem'd like an Age of real gold, Where all who liked might have a slice, So rich was that Fools' Paradise. But the sport at which most time they spent, Was a puppet-show, called Parliament Perform'd by wooden Ciceros, As large as life, who rose to prose, While, hid behind them, lords and squires, Who own'd the puppets, pull'd the wires; And thought it the very best device Of that most prosperous Paradise, To make the vulgar pay through the nose For them and their wooden Ciceros. And many more such things I saw In this Eden of Church, and State, and Law; Nor e'er were known such pleasant folk As those who had the best of the joke. There were Irish Rectors, such as resort To Cheltenham yearly, to drink—port, And bumper, “Long may the Church endure, May her cure of souls be a sinecure, And a score of Parsons to every soul A mod'rate allowance on the whole.” There were Heads of Colleges, lying about, From which the sense had all run out, Ev'n to the lowest classic lees, Till nothing was left but quantities; Which made them heads most fit to be Stuck up on a University, Which yearly hatches, in its schools, Such flights of young Elysian fools. Thus all went on, so snug and nice, In this happiest possible Paradise. But plain it was to see, alas! That a downfall soon must come to pass. For grief is a lot the good and wise Don't quite so much monopolise, But that (“lapt in Elysium” as they are) Even blessed fools must have their share. And so it happen'd:—but what befell, In Dream the Second I mean to tell THE RECTOR AND HIS CURATE; OR, ONE POUND TWO. “I trust we shall part, as we met, in peace and charity. My last payment to you paid your salary up to the 1st of this month. Since that, I owe you for one month, which, being a long month, of thirty-one days, amounts, as near as I can calculate, to six pounds eight shillings. My steward returns you as a debtor to the amount of seven pounds ten shillings for con-acre ground, which leaves some trifling balance in my favour.” —Letter of Dismissal from the Rev. Marcus Beresford to his Curate, the Rev. T. A. Lyons. The account is balanced—the bill drawn out,— The debit and credit all right, no doubt— The Rector, rolling in wealth and state, Owes to his Curate six pound eight; The Curate, that least well-fed of men, Owes to his Rector seven pound ten, Which maketh the balance clearly due From Curate to Rector, one pound two. Ah balance, on earth unfair, uneven! But sure to be all set right in heaven, Where bills like these will be check'd, some day, And the balance settled the other way: Where Lyons the curate's hard-wrung sum Will back to his shade with interest come; And Marcus, the rector, deep may rue This tot, in his favour, of one pound two. PADDY'S METAMORPHOSIS. I have already, in a preceding page, referred to this squib, as being one of those wrung from me by the Irish Coercion Act of my friends, the Whigs. 1833. About fifty years since, in the days of our daddies, That plan was commenced which the wise now applaud, Of shipping off Ireland's most turbulent Paddies, As good raw material for settlers, abroad. Some West-India island, whose name I forget, Was the region then chos'n for this scheme so romantic; And such the success the first colony met, That a second, soon after, set sail o'er th' Atlantic. Behold them now safe at the long-look'd for shore, Sailing in between banks that the Shannon might greet, And thinking of friends whom, but two years before, They had sorrow'd to lose, but would soon again meet. And, hark! from the shore a glad welcome there came— “Arrah, Paddy from Cork, is it you, my sweet boy?” While Pat stood astounded, to hear his own name Thus hail'd by black devils, who caper'd for joy! Can it possibly be?—half amazement—half doubt, Pat listens again—rubs his eyes and looks steady; Then heaves a deep sigh, and in horror yells out, “Good Lord! only think,—black and curly already!” Deceiv'd by that well-mimick'd brogue in his ears, Pat read his own doom in these wool-headed figures, And thought, what a climate, in less than two years, To turn a whole cargo of Pats into niggers! MORAL. 'Tis thus,—but alas! by a marvel more true Than is told in this rival of Ovid's best stories,— Your Whigs, when in office a short year or two, By a lusus naturæ, all turn into Tories. And thus, when I hear them “strong measures” advise, Ere the seats that they sit on have time to get steady, I say, while I listen, with tears in my eyes, “Good Lord! only think,—black and curly already!” COCKER, ON CHURCH REFORM. FOUNDED UPON SOME LATE CALCULATIONS. 1833. Fine figures of speech let your orators follow, Old Cocker has figures that beat them all hollow. Though famed for his rules Aristotle may be, In but half of this Sage any merit I see, For, as honest Joe Hume says, the “tottle The total,—so pronounced by this industrious senator.” for me! For instance, while others discuss and debate, It is thus about Bishops I ratiocinate. In England, where, spite of the infidel's laughter, 'Tis certain our souls are look'd very well after, Two Bishops can well (if judiciously sunder'd) Of parishes manage two thousand two hundred,— Said number of parishes, under said teachers, Containing three millions of Protestant creatures,— So that each of said Bishops full ably controls One million and five hundred thousands of souls. And now comes old Cocker. In Ireland we're told, Half a million includes the whole Protestant fold; If, therefore, for three million souls, 'tis conceded Two proper-sized Bishops are all that is needed, 'Tis plain, for the Irish half million who want 'em, One third of one Bishop is just the right quantum. And thus, by old Cocker's sublime Rule of Three, The Irish Church question's resolv'd to a T; Keeping always that excellent maxim in view, That, in saving men's souls, we must save money too. Nay, if—as St. Roden complains is the case— The half million of soul is decreasing apace, The demand, too, for bishop will also fall off, Till the tithe of one, taken in kind, be enough. But, as fractions imply that we'd have to dissect, And to cutting up Bishops I strongly object, We've a small, fractious prelate whom well we could spare, Who has just the same decimal worth, to a hair; And, not to leave Ireland too much in the lurch, We'll let her have Ex?t?r, sole Corporation sole., as her Church LES HOMMES AUTOMATES. 1834. “We are persuaded that this our artificial man will not only walk and speak, and perform most of the outward functions of animal life, but (being wound up once a week) will perhaps reason as well as most of your country parsons.” —Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus, chap. xii. It being an object now to meet With Parsons that don't want to eat, Fit men to fill those Irish rectories, Which soon will have but scant refectories, It has been suggested,—lest that Church Should, all at once, be left in the lurch, For want of reverend men endued With this gift of ne'er requiring food,— To try, by way of experiment, whether There couldn't be made, of wood and leather The materials of which those Nuremberg Savans, mentioned by Scriblerus, constructed their artificial man., (Howe'er the notion may sound chimerical,) Jointed figures, not lay The wooden models used by painters are, it is well known, called “lay figures.”, but clerical, Which, wound up carefully once a week, Might just like parsons look and speak, Nay even, if requisite, reason too, As well as most Irish parsons do. The' experiment having succeeded quite, (Whereat those Lords must much delight, Who've shown, by stopping the Church's food, They think it isn't for her spiritual good To be serv'd by parsons of flesh and blood,) The Patentees of this new invention Beg leave respectfully to mention, They now are enabled to produce An ample supply, for present use, Of these reverend pieces of machinery, Ready for vicarage, rect'ry, deanery, Or any such-like post of skill That wood and leather are fit to fill. N.B.—In places addicted to arson, We can't recommend a wooden parson: But, if the Church any such appoints, They'd better, at least, have iron joints. In parts, not much by Protestants haunted, A figure to look at's all that's wanted— A block in black, to eat and sleep, Which (now that the eating's o'er) comes cheap. P.S.—Should the Lords, by way of a treat, Permit the clergy again to eat, The Church will, of course, no longer need Imitation-parsons that never feed; And these wood creatures of ours will sell For secular purposes just as well— Our Beresfords, turn'd to bludgeons stout, May, 'stead of beating their own about, Be knocking the brains of Papists out; While our smooth O'Sullivans, by all means, Should transmigrate into turning machines. HOW TO MAKE ONE'S SELF A PEER. ACCORDING TO THE NEWEST RECEIPT, AS DISCLOSED IN A LATE HERALDIC WORK. The claim to the barony of Chandos (if I recollect right) advanced by the late Sir Eg?r?t?n Br?d?s. 1834. Choose some title that's dormant—the Peerage hath many— Lord Baron of Shamdos sounds nobly as any. Next, catch a dead cousin of said defunct Peer, And marry him, off hand, in some given year, To the daughter of somebody,—no matter who,— Fig, the grocer himself, if you're hard run, will do; For, the Medici pills still in heraldry tell, And why shouldn't lollypops quarter as well? Thus, having your couple, and one a lord's cousin, Young materials for peers may be had by the dozen; And 'tis hard if, inventing each small mother's son of 'em, You can't somehow manage to prove yourself one of 'em. Should registers, deeds, and such matters refractory, Stand in the way of this lord-manufactory, I've merely to hint, as a secret auricular, One grand rule of enterprise,—don't be particular. A man who once takes such a jump at nobility, Must not mince the matter, like folks of nihility “This we call pure nihility, or mere nothing.” —Watts's Logic., But clear thick and thin with true lordly agility. 'Tis true, to a would-be descendant from Kings, Parish-registers sometimes are troublesome things; As oft, when the vision is near brought about, Some goblin, in shape of a grocer, grins out; Or some barber, perhaps, with my Lord mingles bloods, And one's patent of peerage is left in the suds. But there are ways—when folks are resolv'd to be lords— Of expurging ev'n troublesome parish records. What think ye of scissors? depend on't no heir Of a Shamdos should go unsupplied with a pair, As, whate'er else the learn'd in such lore may invent, Your scissors does wonders in proving descent. Yes, poets may sing of those terrible shears With which Atropos snips off both bumpkins and peers, But they're nought to that weapon which shines in the hands Of some would-be Patrician, when proudly he stands O'er the careless churchwarden's baptismal array, And sweeps at each cut generations away. By some babe of old times is his peerage resisted? One snip,—and the urchin hath never existed! Does some marriage, in days near the Flood, interfere With his one sublime object of being a Peer? Quick the shears at once nullify bridegroom and bride,— No such people have ever liv'd, married, or died! Such the newest receipt for those high-minded elves, Who've fancy for making great lords of themselves. Follow this, young aspirer, who pant'st for a peerage, Take S?m for thy model and B?z for thy steerage, Do all and much worse than old Nicholas Flam does, And—who knows but you'll be Lord Baron of Shamdos? THE DUKE IS THE LAD. Air.—“A master I have, and I am his man, Galloping dreary dun.” Castle of Andalusia. The Duke is the lad to frighten a lass, Galloping, dreary duke; The Duke is the lad to frighten a lass, He's an ogre to meet, and the d?l to pass, With his charger prancing, Grim eye glancing, Chin, like a Mufti, Grizzled and tufty, Galloping, dreary Duke. Ye misses, beware of the neighbourhood Of this galloping dreary Duke; Avoid him, all who see no good In being run o'er by a Prince of the Blood. For, surely, no nymph is Fond of a grim phiz, And of the married, Whole crowds have miscarried At sight of this dreary Duke. EPISTLE FROM ERASMUS ON EARTH TO CICERO IN THE SHADES. Southampton. As 'tis now, my dear Tully, some weeks since I started By rail-road, for earth, having vowed, ere we parted, To drop you a line, by the Dead-Letter post, Just to say how I thrive, in my new line of ghost, And how deucedly odd this live world all appears, To a man who's been dead now for three hundred years, I take up my pen, and, with news of this earth, Hope to waken, by turns, both your spleen and your mirth. In my way to these shores, taking Italy first, Lest the change from Elysium too sudden should burst, I forgot not to visit those haunts where, of yore, You took lessons from Pætus in cookery's lore See his Letters to Friends, lib. ix. epist. 19, 20, &amp;c., Turn'd aside from the calls of the rostrum and Muse, To discuss the rich merits of rôtis and stews, And preferr'd to all honours of triumph or trophy, A supper on prawns with that rogue, little Sophy. Ingentium squillarum cum Sophia Septimæ. —Lib. ix. epist. 10. Having dwelt on such classical musings awhile, I set off, by a steam-boat, for this happy isle, (A conveyance you ne'er, I think, sail'd by, my Tully, And therefore, per next, I'll describe it more fully,) Having heard, on the way, what distresses me greatly, That England's o'er-run by idolaters lately, Stark, staring adorers of wood and of stone, Who will let neither stick, stock, or statue alone. Such the sad news I heard from a tall man in black, Who from sports continental was hurrying back, To look after his tithes;—seeing, doubtless, 'twould follow, That, just as, of old, your great idol, Apollo, Devour'd all the Tenths Tithes were paid to the Pythian Apollo., so the idols in question, These wood and stone gods, may have equal digestion, And th' idolatrous crew, whom this Rector despises, May eat up the tithe-pig which he idolizes. London. 'Tis all but too true—grim Idolatry reigns, In full pomp, over England's lost cities and plains! On arriving just now, as my first thought and care Was, as usual, to seek out some near House of Prayer, Some calm, holy spot, fit for Christians to pray on, I was shown to—what think you?—a downright Pantheon! A grand, pillar'd temple, with niches and halls See Dr. Wiseman's learned and able letter to Mr. Poynder., Full of idols and gods, which they nickname St. Paul's;— Though 'tis clearly the place where the idolatrous crew, Whom the Rector complain'd of, their dark rites pursue; And, 'mong all the “strange gods” Abr'ham's father carv'd out Joshua, xxiv. 2., That he ever carv'd stranger than these I much doubt. Were it ev'n, my dear Tully, your Hebes and Graces, And such pretty things, that usurp'd the Saints' places, I shouldn't much mind,—for, in this classic dome, Such folks from Olympus would feel quite at home. But the gods they've got here!—such a queer omnium gatherum Of misbegot things, that no poet would father 'em;— Britannias, in light, summer-wear for the skies,— Old Thames, turn'd to stone, to his no small surprise,— Father Nile, too,—a portrait, (in spite of what's said, That no mortal e'er yet got a glimpse of his head ? “Nec contigit ulli Hoc vidisse caput.” Claudian.,) And a Ganges, which India would think somewhat fat for't, Unless 'twas some full-grown Director had sat for't;— Not to mention the' et cæteras of Genii and Sphinxes, Fame, Vict'ry, and other such semi-clad minxes;— Sea Captains Captains Mosse, Riou, &amp;c. &amp;c.—the idols here most idolised; And of whom some, alas, might too well be comprized Among ready-made Saints, as they died cannonized;— With a multitude more of odd cockneyfied deities, Shrined in such pomp that quite shocking to see it 'tis; Nor know I what better the Rector could do Than to shrine there his own belov'd quadruped too; As most surely a tithe-pig, whate'er the world thinks, is A much fitter beast for a church than a Sphinx is. But I'm call'd off to dinner—grace just has been said, And my host waits for nobody, living or dead. LINES This and the following squib, which must have been written about the year 1815–16, have been by some oversight misplaced. ON THE DEPARTURE OF LORDS C?ST?R?GH AND ST?W?RT FOR THE CONTINENT. At Paris Ovid is mistaken in saying that it was “at Paris” these rapacious transactions took place—we should read “at Vienna.” et Fratres, et qui rapuêre sub illis Vix tenuêre manus (scis hoc, Menelaë) nefandas.

Go, Hero of Chancery, blest with the smile Of the Misses that love, and the monarchs that prize thee; Forget Mrs. Ang?lo T?yl?r awhile, And all tailors but him who so well dandifies thee. Never mind how thy juniors in gallantry scoff, Never heed how perverse affidavits may thwart thee, But show the young Misses thou'rt scholar enough To translate “Amor Fortis” a love, about forty! And sure 'tis no wonder, when, fresh as young Mars, From the battle you came, with the Orders you'd earn'd in't, That sweet Lady Fanny should cry out “my stars!” And forget that the Moon, too, was some way concern'd in't. For not the great R?g?t himself has endur'd (Though I've seen him with badges and orders all shine, Till he look'd like a house that was over insur'd) A much heavier burden of glories than thine. And 'tis plain, when a wealthy young lady so mad is, Or any young ladies can so go astray, As to marry old Dandies that might be their daddies, The stars The stars are more in fault than they.” are in fault, my Lord St?w?rt, not they! Thou, too, t'other brother, thou Tully of Tories, Thou Malaprop Cicero, over whose lips Such a smooth rigmarole about “monarchs,” and “glories,” And “nullidge It is thus the noble lord pronounces the word “knowledge” —deriving it, as far as his own share is concerned, from the Latin, “nullus.”,” and “features,” like syllabub slips. Go, haste, at the Congress pursue thy vocation Of adding fresh sums to this National Debt of ours, Leaguing with Kings, who, for mere recreation, Break promises, fast as your Lordship breaks metaphors. Fare ye well, fare ye well, bright Pair of Peers, And may Cupid and Fame fan you both with their pinions! The one, the best lover we have—of his years, And the other, Prime Statesman of Britain's dominions. TO THE SHIP IN WHICH LORD C?ST?R?GH SAILED FOR THE CONTINENT. Imitated from Horace, lib. i. ode 3.

And now, that—strife and bloodshed past— We've done on earth what harm we can do, We gravely take to heav'n at last Cœlum ipsum petimus stultitiâ And think its favouring smile to purchase (Oh Lord, good Lord! by—building churches!) SKETCH OF THE FIRST ACT OF A NEW ROMANTIC DRAMA. “And now,” quoth the goddess, in accents jocose, “Having got good materials, I'll brew such a dose “Of Double X mischief as, mortals shall say, “They've not known its equal for many a long day.” Here she wink'd to her subaltern imps to be steady, And all wagg'd their fire-tipp'd tails and stood ready. “So, now for the' ingredients:—first, hand me that bishop;” Whereon, a whole bevy of imps run to fish up, From out a large reservoir, wherein they pen 'em, The blackest of all its black dabblers in venom; And wrapping him up (lest the virus should ooze, And one “drop of the' immortal “To lose no drop of the immortal man.”” Right Rev. The present Bishop of Ex?t?r. they might lose) In the sheets of his own speeches, charges, reviews, Pop him into the caldron, while loudly a burst From the by-standers welcomes ingredient the first! “Now fetch the Ex-Chancellor,” mutter'd the dame— “He who's call'd after Harry the Older, by name.” “The Ex-Chancellor!” echoed her imps, the whole crew of 'em— “Why talk of one Ex, when your Mischief has two of 'em?” “True, true,” said the hag, looking arch at her elves, “And a double-Ex dose they compose, in themselves.” This joke, the sly meaning of which was seen lucidly, Set all the devils a laughing most deucedly. So, in went the pair, and (what none thought surprising) Show'd talents for sinking as great as for rising; While not a grim phiz in that realm but was lighted With joy to see spirits so twin-like united— Or (plainly to speak) two such birds of a feather, In one mess of venom thus spitted together. Here a flashy imp rose—some connexion, no doubt, Of the young lord in question—and, scowling about, “Hop'd his fiery friend, St?nl?y, would not be left out; “As no schoolboy unwhipp'd, the whole world must agree, “Lov'd mischief, pure mischief, more dearly than he.” But, no—the wise hag wouldn't hear of the whipster; Not merely because, as a shrew, he eclips'd her, And nature had giv'n him, to keep him still young, Much tongue in his head and no head in his tongue; But because she well knew that, for change ever ready, He'd not ev'n to mischief keep properly steady; That soon ev'n the wrong side would cease to delight, And, for want of a change, he must swerve to the right; While, on each, so at random his missiles he threw, That the side he attack'd was most safe, of the two.— This ingredient was therefore put by on the shelf, There to bubble, a bitter, hot mess, by itself. “And now,” quoth the hag, as her caldron she ey'd, And the tidbits so friendlily rankling inside, “There wants but some seasoning;—so, come, ere I stew 'em, “By way of a relish, we'll throw in ‘?John Tuam.’ “In cooking up mischief, there's no flesh or fish “Like your meddling High Priest, to add zest to the dish.” Thus saying, she pops in the Irish Grand Lama— Which great event ends the First Act of the Drama. ANIMAL MAGNETISM. Though fam'd was Mesmer, in his day, Nor less so, in ours, is Dupotet, To say nothing of all the wonders done By that wizard, Dr. Elliotson, When, standing as if the gods to invoke, he Up waves his arm, and—down drops Okey! The name of the heroine of the performances at the North London Hospital. Though strange these things, to mind and sense, If you wish still stranger things to see— If you wish to know the power immense Of the true magnetic influence, Just go to her Majesty's Treasury, And learn the wonders working there— And I'll be hang'd if you don't stare! Talk of your animal magnetists, And that wave of the hand no soul resists, Not all its witcheries can compete With the friendly beckon tow'rds Downing Street, Which a Premier gives to one who wishes To taste of the Treasury loaves and fishes. It actually lifts the lucky elf, Thus acted upon, above himself;— He jumps to a state of clairvoyance, And is placeman, statesman, all, at once! These effects, observe (with which I begin), Take place when the patient's motion'd in; Far different, of course, the mode of affection, When the wave of the hand's in the out direction; The effects being then extremely unpleasant, As is seen in the case of Lord B?m, at present; In whom this sort of manipulation Has lately produc'd such inflammation, Attended with constant irritation, That, in short—not to mince his situation— It has work'd in the man a transformation That puzzles all human calculation! Ever since the fatal day which saw That “pass The technical term for the movements of the magnetizer's hand.” perform'd on this Lord of Law— A pass potential, none can doubt, As it sent Harry B?m to the right about— The condition in which the patient has been Is a thing quite awful to be seen. Not that a casual eye could scan This wondrous change by outward survey; It being, in fact, the' interior man That's turn'd completely topsy-turvy:— Like a case that lately, in reading o'er 'em, I found in the Acta Eruditorum, Of a man in whose inside, when disclos'd, The whole order of things was found transpos'd Omnes feré internas corporis partes inverso ordine sitas. —Act. Erudit. 1690.; By a lusus naturæ, strange to see, The liver plac'd where the heart should be, And the spleen (like B?m's, since laid on the shelf) As diseas'd and as much out of place as himself. In short, 'tis a case for consultation, If e'er there was one, in this thinking nation; And therefore I humbly beg to propose, That those savans who mean, as the rumour goes, To sit on Miss Okey's wonderful case, Should also Lord Harry's case embrace; And inform us, in both these patients' states, Which ism it is that predominates, Whether magnetism and somnambulism, Or, simply and solely, mountebankism. THE SONG OF THE BOX. Let History boast of her Romans and Spartans, And tell how they stood against tyranny's shocks; They were all, I confess, in my eye, Betty Martins, Compar'd to George Gr?te and his wonderful Box. Ask, where Liberty now has her seat?—Oh, it isn't By Delaware's banks or on Switzerland's rocks;— Like an imp in some conjuror's bottle imprison'd, She's slily shut up in Gr?te's wonderful Box. How snug!—'stead of floating through ether's dominions, Blown this way and that, by the “populi vox,” To fold thus in silence her sinecure pinions, And go fast asleep in Gr?te's wonderful Box. Time was, when free speech was the life-breath of freedom— So thought once the Seldens, the Hampdens, the Lockes; But mute be our troops, when to ambush we lead 'em, For “Mum” is the word with us Knights of the Box. Pure, exquisite Box! no corruption can soil it; There's Otto of Rose in each breath it unlocks; While Gr?te is the “Betty,” that serves at the toilet, And breathes all Arabia around from his Box. And all Arabia breathes from yonder box. Pope's Rape of the Lock. 'Tis a singular fact, that the fam'd Hugo Grotius Groot, or Grote, latinized into Grotius. (A namesake of Gr?te's—being both of Dutch stocks), Like Gr?te, too, a genius profound as precocious, Was also, like him, much renown'd for a Box;— An immortal old clothes-box, in which the great Grotius When suffering, in prison, for views het'rodox, Was pack'd up incog. spite of gaolers ferocious For the particulars of this escape of Grotius from the Castle of Louvenstein, by means of a box (only three feet and a half long, it is said) in which books used to be occasionally sent to him and foul linen returned, see any of the Biographical Dictionaries., And sent to his wife This is not quite according to the facts of the case; his wife having been the contriver of the stratagem, and remained in the prison herself to give him time for escape., carriage free, in a Box! But the fame of old Hugo now rests on the shelf, Since a rival hath ris'n that all parallel mocks;— That Grotius ingloriously sav'd but himself, While ours saves the whole British realm by a Box! And oh when, at last, ev'n this greatest of Gr?tes Must bend to the Power that at every door knocks Pallida Mors æquo pulsat pede, &amp;c. —Horat., May he drop in the urn like his own “silent votes,” And the tomb of his rest be a large Ballot-Box. While long at his shrine, both from county and city, Shall pilgrims triennially gather in flocks, And sing, while they whimper, the' appropriate ditty, “Oh breathe not his name, let it sleep—in the Box.” ANNOUNCEMENT OF A NEW THALABA. ADDRESSED TO ROBERT SOUTHEY, ESQ. When erst, my Southey, thy tuneful tongue The terrible tale of Thalaba sung— Of him, the Destroyer, doom'd to rout That grim divan of conjurors out, Whose dwelling dark, as legends say, Beneath the roots of the ocean lay, (Fit place for deep ones, such as they,) How little thou knew'st, dear Dr. Southey, Although bright genus all allow thee, That, some years thence, thy wondering eyes Should see a second Thalaba rise— As ripe for ruinous rigs as thine, Though his havoc lie in a different line, And should find this new, improv'd Destroyer Beneath the wig of a Yankee lawyer; A sort of an “alien,” alias man, Whose country or party guess who can, Being Cockney half, half Jonathan; And his life, to make the thing completer, Being all in the genuine Thalaba metre, Loose and irregular as thy feet are;— First, into Whig Pindarics rambling, Then in low Tory doggrel scrambling; Now love his theme, now Church his glory (At once both Tory and ama-tory), Now in the' Old Bailey-lay meandering, Now in soft couplet style philandering; And, lastly, in lame Alexandrine, Dragging his wounded length along “A needless Alexandrine ends the song That, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.”, When scourg'd by Holland's silken thong. In short, dear Bob, Destroyer the Second May fairly a match for the First be reckon'd; Save that your Thalaba's talent lay In sweeping old conjurors clean away, While ours at aldermen deals his blows, (Who no great conjurors are, God knows,) Lays Corporations, by wholesale, level, Sends Acts of Parliament to the devil, Bullies the whole Milesian race— Seven millions of Paddies, face to face; And, seizing that magic wand, himself, Which erst thy conjurors left on the shelf, Transforms the boys of the Boyne and Liffey All into foreigners, in a jiffey— Aliens, outcasts, every soul of 'em, Born but for whips and chains, the whole of 'em! Never, in short, did parallel Betwixt two heroes gee so well; And, among the points in which they fit, There's one, dear Bob, I can't omit. That hacking, hectoring blade of thine Dealt much in the Domdaniel line “Vain are the spells, the Destroyer Treads the Domdaniel floor.” Thalaba, a Metrical Romance.; And 'tis but rendering justice due, To say that ours and his Tory crew Damn Daniel most devoutly too. RIVAL TOPICS. The date of this squib must have been, I think, about 1828–9. AN EXTRAVAGANZA. Oh W?ll?ngt?n and Stephenson, Oh morn and evening papers, Times, Herald, Courier, Globe, and Sun, When will ye cease our ears to stun With these two heroes' capers? Still “Stephenson” and “W?ll?ngt?n,” The everlasting two!— Still doom'd, from rise to set of sun, To hear what mischief one has done, And t'other means to do:— What bills the banker pass'd to friends, But never meant to pay; What Bills the other wight intends, As honest, in their way;— Bills, payable at distant sight, Beyond the Grecian kalends, When all good deeds will come to light, When W?ll?ngt?n will do what's right, And Rowland pay his balance. To catch the banker all have sought, But still the rogue unhurt is; While t'other juggler—who'd have thought? Though slippery long, has just been caught By old Archbishop Curtis;— And, such the power of papal crook, The crosier scarce had quiver'd About his ears, when, lo, the Duke Was of a Bull deliver'd! Sir Richard Birnie doth decide That Rowland “must be mad,” In private coach, with crest, to ride, When chaises could be had. And t'other hero, all agree, St. Luke's will soon arrive at, If thus he shows off publicly, When he might pass in private. Oh W?ll?ngt?n, oh Stephenson, Ye ever-boring pair, Where'er I sit, or stand, or run, Ye haunt me every where. Though Job had patience tough enough, Such duplicates would try it; Till one's turn'd out and t'other off, We shan't have peace or quiet. But small's the chance that Law affords— Such folks are daily let off; And, 'twixt the' Old Bailey and the Lords, They both, I fear, will get off. THE BOY STATESMAN. BY A TORY. “That boy will be the death of me.” Matthews at Home. Ah, Tories dear, our ruin is near, With St?nl?y to help us, we can't but fall; Already a warning voice I hear, Like the late Charles Matthews' croak in my ear, “That boy—that boy'll be the death of you all.” He will, God help us!—not ev'n Scriblerius In the “Art of Sinking” his match could be; And our case is growing exceeding serious, For, all being in the same boat as he, If down my Lord goes, down go we, Lord Baron St?nl?y and Company, As deep in Oblivion's swamp below As such “Masters Shallow” well could go; And where we shall all both low and high, Embalm'd in mud, as forgotten lie As already doth Gr?h?m of Netherby! But that boy, that boy!—there's a tale I know, Which in talking of him comes à-propos. Sir Thomas More had an only son, And a foolish lad was that only one, And Sir Thomas said, one day to his wife, “My dear, I can't but wish you joy, “For you pray'd for a boy, and you now have a boy, “Who'll continue a boy to the end of his life.” Ev'n such is our own distressing lot, With the ever-young statesman we have got;— Nay ev'n still worse; for Master More Wasn't more a youth than he'd been before, While ours such power of boyhood shows, That, the older he gets, the more juv'nile he grows, And, at what extreme old age he'll close His schoolboy course, heaven only knows;— Some century hence, should he reach so far, And ourselves to witness it heav'n condemn, We shall find him a sort of cub Old Parr, A whipper-snapper Methusalem; Nay, ev'n should he make still longer stay of it, The boy'll want judgment, ev'n to the day of it! Meanwhile, 'tis a serious, sad infliction; And, day and night, with awe I recall The late Mr. Matthews' solemn prediction, “That boy'll be the death, the death of you all.” LETTER FROM LARRY O'BRANIGAN TO THE REV. MURTAGH O'MULLIGAN. Abrah, where were you, Murthagh, that beautiful day?— Or, how came it your riverence was laid on the shelf, When that poor craythur, Bobby—as you were away— Had to make twice as big a Tom-fool of himself. Throth, it wasn't at all civil to lave in the lurch A boy so desarving your tindh'rest affection;— Two such iligant Siamase twins of the Church, As Bob and yourself, ne'er should cut the connection. If thus in two different directions you pull, 'Faith, they'll swear that yourself and your riverend brother Are like those quare foxes, in Gregory's Bull, Whose tails were join'd one way, while they look'd another! “You will increase the enmity with which they are regarded by their associates in heresy, thus tying these foxes by the tails, that their faces may tend in opposite directions.” —Bob's Bull, read at Exeter Hall, July 14. Och bless'd be he, whosomdever he be, That help'd soft Magee to that Bull of a Letther! Not ev'n my own self, though I sometimes make free At such bull-manufacture, could make him a betther. To be sure, when a lad takes to forgin', this way, 'Tis a thrick he's much timpted to carry on gaily; Till, at last, his “injanious devices “An ingenious device of my learned friend.” —Bob's Letter to Standard.,” some day, Show him up, not at Exether Hall, but the' Ould Bailey. That parsons should forge thus appears mighty odd, And (as if somethin' “odd” in their names, too, must be,) One forger, of ould, was a riverend Dod, While a riverend Todd's now his match, to a T. Had I consulted only my own wishes, I should not have allowed this hasty attack on Dr. Todd to have made its appearance in this Collection; being now fully convinced that the charge brought against that reverend gentleman of intending to pass off as genuine his famous mock Papal Letter was altogether unfounded. Finding it to be the wish, however, of my reverend friend—as I am now glad to be permitted to call him—that both the wrong and the reparation, the Ode and the Palinode, should be thus placed in juxtaposition, I have thought it but due to him to comply with his request. But, no matther who did it—all blessins betide him, For dishin' up Bob, in a manner so nate; And there wanted but you, Murthagh 'vourneen, beside him, To make the whole grand dish of bull-calf complate. MUSINGS OF AN UNREFORMED PEER. Of all the odd plans of this monstrously queer age, The oddest is that of reforming the peerage;— Just as if we, great dons, with a title and star Did not get on exceedingly well, as we are, And perform all the functions of noodles, by birth, As completely as any born noodles on earth. How acres descend, is in law-books display'd, But we as wiseacres descend, ready made; And, by right of our rank in Debrett's nomenclature, Are, all of us, born legislators by nature;— Like ducklings, to water instinctly taking, So we, with like quackery, take to law-making; And God forbid any reform should come o'er us, To make us more wise than our sires were before us. The' Egyptians of old the same policy knew— If your sire was a cook, you must be a cook too: Thus making, from father to son, a good trade of it, Poisoners by right (so no more could be said of it), The cooks, like our lordships, a pretty mess made of it; While, fam'd for conservative stomachs, th' Egyptians Without a wry face bolted all the prescriptions. It is true, we've among us some peers of the past, Who keep pace with the present most awfully fast— Fruits, that ripen beneath the new light now arising With speed that to us, old conserves, is surprising, Conserves, in whom—potted, for grandmamma uses— 'Twould puzzle a sunbeam to find any juices. 'Tis true, too, I fear, midst the general movement, Ev'n our House, God help it, is doom'd to improvement, And all its live furniture, nobly descended, But sadly worn out, must be sent to be mended. With moveables 'mong us, like Br?m and like D?rh?m, No wonder ev'n fixtures should learn to bestir 'em; And, distant, ye gods, be that terrible day, When—as playful Old Nick, for his pastime, they say, Flies off with old houses, sometimes, in a storm— So ours may be whipt off, some night, by Reform; And, as up, like Loretto's fam'd house The Casa Santa, supposed to have been carried by angels through the air from Galilee to Italy., through the air, Not angels, but devils, our lordships shall bear, Grim, radical phizzes, unus'd to the sky, Shall flit round, like cherubs, to wish us “good-by,” While, perch'd up on clouds, little imps of plebeians, Small Grotes and O'Connells, shall sing Io Pæans. THE REVEREND PAMPHLETEER. A ROMANTIC BALLAD. Oh, have you heard what hap'd of late? If not, come lend an ear, While sad I state the piteous fate Of the Reverend Pamphleteer. All prais'd his skilful jockeyship, Loud rung the Tory cheer, While away, away, with spur and whip, Went the Reverend Pamphleteer. The nag he rode—how could it err? 'Twas the same that took, last year, That wonderful jump to Exeter With the Reverend Pamphleteer. Set a beggar on horseback, wise men say, The course he will take is clear; And in that direction lay the way Of the Reverend Pamphleteer. “Stop, stop,” said Truth, but vain her cry— Left far away in the rear, She heard but the usual gay “Good-by” From her faithless Pamphleteer. You may talk of the jumps of Homer's gods, When cantering o'er our sphere— I'd back for a bounce, 'gainst any odds, This Reverend Pamphleteer. But ah, what tumbles a jockey hath! In the midst of his career, A file of the Times lay right in the path Of the headlong Pamphleteer. Whether he tripp'd or shy'd thereat, Doth not so clear appear: But down he came, as his sermons flat— This Reverend Pamphleteer! Lord King himself could scarce desire To see a spiritual Peer Fall much more dead, in the dirt and mire, Than did this Pamphleteer. Yet pitying parsons, many a day, Shall visit his silent bier, And, thinking the while of Stanhope, say “Poor dear old Pamphleteer! “He has finish'd, at last, his busy span, “And now lies coolly here— “As often he did in life, good man, “Good, Reverend Pamphleteer!” A RECENT DIALOGUE. 1825. A bishop and a bold dragoon, Both heroes in their way Did thus, of late, one afternoon, Unto each other say:— “Dear bishop,” quoth the brave hussar, “As nobody denies “That you a wise logician are, “And I am—otherwise, “'Tis fit that in this question, we “Stick each to his own art— “That yours should be the sophistry, “And mine the fighting part. “My creed, I need not tell you, is “Like that of W?n, “To whom no harlot comes amiss, “Save her of Babylon Cui nulla meretrix displicuit præter Babylonicam.; “And when we're at a loss for words, “If laughing reasoners flout us, “For lack of sense we'll draw our swords— “The sole thing sharp about us.”— “Dear bold dragoon,” the bishop said, “'Tis true for war thou art meant; “And reasoning—bless that dandy head! “Is not in thy department. “So leave the argument to me— “And, when my holy labour “Hath lit the fires of bigotry, “Thou'lt poke them with thy sabre. “From pulpit and from sentry-box, “We'll make our joint attacks, “I at the head of my Cassocks, “And you, of your Cossacks. “So here's your health, my brave hussar, “My exquisite old fighter— “Success to bigotry and war, “The musket and the mitre!” Thus pray'd the minister of heaven— While Y?k, just entering then, Snor'd out (as if some Clerk had given His nose the cue) “Amen.” T B. THE WELLINGTON SPA. “And drink oblivion to our woes.” Anna Matilda. 1829. Talk no more of your Cheltenham and Harrowgate springs, 'Tis from Lethe we now our potations must draw; Your Lethe's a cure for—all possible things, And the doctors have nam'd it the Wellington Spa. Other physical waters but cure you in part; One cobbles your gout—t'other mends your digestion— Some settle your stomach, but this—bless your heart!— It will settle, for ever, your Catholic Question. Unlike, too, the potions in fashion at present, This Wellington nostrum, restoring by stealth, So purges the mem'ry of all that's unpleasant, That patients forget themselves into rude health. For instance, the' inventor—his having once said “He should think himself mad, if, at any one's call, “He became what he is”—is so purg'd from his head, That he now doesn't think he's a madman at all. Of course, for your mem'ries of very long standing— Old chronic diseases, that date back, undaunted, To Brian Boroo and Fitz-Stephens' first landing— A dev'l of a dose of the Lethe is wanted. But ev'n Irish patients can hardly regret An oblivion, so much in their own native style, So conveniently plann'd, that, whate'er they forget, They may go on rememb'ring it still, all the while! The only parallel I know to this sort of oblivion is to be found in a line of the late Mr. R. P. Knight— “The pleasing memory of things forgot.” A CHARACTER. 1834. Half Whig, half Tory, like those midway things, 'Twixt bird and beast, that by mistake have wings; A mongrel Statesman, 'twixt two factions nurst, Who, of the faults of each, combines the worst— The Tory's loftiness, the Whigling's sneer, The leveller's rashness, and the bigot's fear; The thirst for meddling, restless still to show How Freedom's clock, repair'd by Whigs, will go; The alarm when others, more sincere than they, Advance the hands to the true time of day. By Mother Church, high-fed and haughty dame, The boy was dandled, in his dawn of fame; List'ning, she smil'd, and bless'd the flippant tongue On which the fate of unborn tithe-pigs hung. Ah, who shall paint the grandam's grim dismay, When loose Reform entic'd her boy away; When shock'd she heard him ape the rabble's tone, And, in Old Sarum's fate, foredoom her own! Groaning she cried, while tears roll'd down her cheeks, “Poor, glib-tongued youth, he means not what he speaks. “Like oil at top, these Whig professions flow, “But, pure as lymph, runs Toryism below. “Alas, that tongue should start thus, in the race, “Ere mind can reach and regulate its pace!— “For, once outstripp'd by tongue, poor, lagging mind, “At every step, still further limps behind. “But, bless the boy!—whate'er his wandering be, “Still turns his heart to Toryism and me. “Like those odd shapes, portray'd in Dante's lay Perchè 'l veder dinanzi era lor tolto.”, “With heads fix'd on, the wrong and backward way, “His feet and eyes pursue a diverse track, “While those march onward, these look fondly back.” And well she knew him—well foresaw the day, Which now hath come, when snatch'd from Whigs away, The self-same changeling drops the mask he wore, And rests, restor'd, in granny's arms once more. But whither now, mixt brood of modern light And ancient darkness, can'st thou bend thy flight? Tried by both factions, and to neither true, Fear'd by the old school, laugh'd at by the new; For this too feeble, and for that too rash, This wanting more of fire, that less of flash, Lone shalt thou stand, in isolation cold, Betwixt two worlds, the new one and the old, A small and “vex'd Bermoothes,” which the eye Of venturous seaman sees—and passes by. A GHOST STORY. To the Air of “Unfortunate Miss Bailey.” 1835. Not long in bed had L?ndh?rst lain, When, as his lamp burn'd dimly, The ghosts of corporate bodies slain Referring to the line taken by Lord L?ndh?rst, on the question of Municipal Reform., Stood by his bed-side grimly. Dead aldermen, who once could feast, But now, themselves, are fed on, And skeletons of may'rs deceas'd, This doleful chorus led on:— “Oh Lord L?ndh?rst, “Unmerciful Lord L?ndh?rst, “Corpses we, “All burk'd by thee, “Unmerciful Lord L?ndh?rst!” “Avaunt, ye frights!” his Lordship cried, “Ye look most glum and whitely.” “Ah, L?ndh?rst dear!” the frights replied, “You've us'd us unpolitely. “And now, ungrateful man! to drive “Dead bodies from your door so, “Who quite corrupt enough, alive, “You've made, by death, still more so. “Oh, Ex-Chancellor, “Destructive Ex-Chancellor, “See thy work, “Thou second Burke, “Destructive Ex-Chancellor!” Bold L?ndh?rst then, whom nought could keep Awake, or surely that would, Cried “Curse you all”—fell fast asleep— And dreamt of “Small v. Attwood.” While, shock'd, the bodies flew down stairs. But, courteous in their panic, Precedence gave to ghosts of may'rs, And corpses aldermanic, Crying, “Oh, Lord L?ndh?rst, “That terrible Lord L?ndh?rst, “Not Old Scratch “Himself could match “That terrible Lord L?ndh?rst.” THOUGHTS ON THE LATE DESTRUCTIVE PROPOSITIONS OF THE TORIES. These verses were written in reference to the Bill brought in at this time, for the reform of Corporations, and the sweeping amendments proposed by Lord Lyndhurst and other Tory Peers, in order to obstruct the measure. BY A COMMON-COUNCILMAN. 1835. I sat me down in my easy chair, To read, as usual, the morning papers; But—who shall describe my look of despair, When I came to Lefroy's “destructive” capers! That he—that, of all live men, Lefroy Should join in the cry “Destroy, destroy!” Who, ev'n when a babe, as I've heard said, On Orange conserve was chiefly fed, And never, till now, a movement made That wasn't most manfully retrograde! Only think—to sweep from the light of day Mayors, maces, criers, and wigs away; To annihilate—never to rise again— A whole generation of aldermen, Nor leave them ev'n the' accustom'd tolls, To keep together their bodies and souls!— At a time, too, when snug posts and places Are falling away from us, one by one, Crash—crash—like the mummy-cases Belzoni, in Egypt, sat upon, Wherein lay pickled, in state sublime, Conservatives of the ancient time;— To choose such a moment to overset The few snug nuisances left us yet; To add to the ruin that round us reigns, By knocking out mayors' and town-clerks' brains; By dooming all corporate bodies to fall, Till they leave, at last, no bodies at all— Nought but the ghosts of by-gone glory, Wrecks of a world that once was Tory!— Where pensive criers, like owls unblest, Robb'd of their roosts, shall still hoot o'er them; Nor may'rs shall know where to seek a nest, Till Gally Knight shall find one for them;— Till mayors and kings, with none to rue 'em, Shall perish all in one common plague; And the sovereigns of Belfast and Tuam Must join their brother, Charles Dix, at Prague. Thus mus'd I, in my chair, alone, (As above describ'd) till dozy grown, And nodding assent to my own opinions, I found myself borne to sleep's dominions, Where, lo, before my dreaming eyes, A new House of Commons appear'd to rise, Whose living contents, to fancy's survey, Seem'd to me all turn'd topsy-turvy— A jumble of polypi—nobody knew Which was the head or which the queue. Here, Inglis, turn'd to a sans-culotte, Was dancing the hays with Hume and Grote; There, ripe for riot, Recorder Shaw Was learning from Roebuck “Ça-ira;” While Stanley and Graham, as poissarde wenches, Scream'd “à-bas!” from the Tory benches; And Peel and O'Connell, cheek by jowl, Were dancing an Irish carmagnole. The Lord preserve us!—if dreams come true, What is this hapless realm to do? ANTICIPATED MEETING OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION IN THE YEAR 2836. 1836. After some observations from Dr. M'Grig On that fossile reliquium call'd Petrified Wig, Or Perruquolithus—a specimen rare Of those wigs, made for antediluvian wear, Which, it seems, stood the Flood without turning a hair— Mr. Tomkins rose up, and requested attention To facts no less wondrous which he had to mention. Some large fossil creatures had lately been found, Of a species no longer now seen above ground, But the same (as to Tomkins most clearly appears) With those animals, lost now for hundreds of years, Which our ancestors us'd to call “Bishops” and “Peers,” But which Tomkins more erudite names has bestow'd on, Having call'd the Peer fossil the' Aristocratodon A term formed on the model of the Mastodon, &amp;c., And, finding much food under t'other one's thorax, Has christen'd that creature the' Episcopus Vorax. Lest the savantes and dandies should think this all fable, Mr. Tomkins most kindly produc'd, on the table, A sample of each of these species of creatures, Both tol'rably human, in structure and features, Except that the' Episcopus seems, Lord deliver us! To've been carnivorous as well as granivorous; And Tomkins, on searching its stomach, found there Large lumps, such as no modern stomach could bear, Of a substance call'd Tithe, upon which, as 'tis said, The whole Genus Clericum formerly fed; And which having lately himself decompounded, Just to see what 'twas made of, he actually found it Compos'd of all possible cookable things That e'er tripp'd upon trotters or soar'd upon wings— All products of earth, both gramineous, herbaceous, Hordeaceous, fabaceous, and eke farinaceous, All clubbing their quotas, to glut the œsophagus Of this ever greedy and grasping Tithophagus. The zoological term for a tithe-eater. “Admire,” exclaim'd Tomkins, “the kind dispensation “By Providence shed on this much-favour'd nation, “In sweeping so ravenous a race from the earth, “That might else have occasion'd a general dearth— “And thus burying 'em, deep as ev'n Joe Hume would sink 'em, “With the Ichthyosaurus and Palœorynchum, “And other queer ci-devant things, under ground— “Not forgetting that fossilised youth The man found by Scheuchzer, and supposed by him to have witnessed the Deluge (“homo diluvii testis”), but who turned out, I am sorry to say, to be merely a great lizard., so renown'd, “Who liv'd just to witness the Deluge—was gratified “Much by the sight, and has since been found stratified!” This picturesque touch—quite in Tomkins's way— Call'd forth from the savantes a general hurrah; While inquiries among them went rapidly round, As to where this young stratified man could be found. The “learn'd Theban's” discourse next as livelily flow'd on, To sketch t'other wonder, the' Aristocratodon— An animal, differing from most human creatures Not so much in speech, inward structure, or features, As in having a certain excrescence, T. said, Which in form of a coronet grew from its head, And devolv'd to its heirs, when the creature was dead; Nor matter'd it, while this heir-loom was transmitted, How unfit were the heads, so the coronet fitted. He then mention'd a strange zoological fact, Whose announcement appear'd much applause to attract. In France, said the learned professor, this race Had so noxious become, in some centuries' space, From their numbers and strength, that the land was o'errun with 'em, Every one's question being, “What's to be done with 'em?” When, lo! certain knowing ones—savans, mayhap, Who, like Buckland's deep followers, understood trap Particularly the formation called Transition Trap., Slily hinted that nought upon earth was so good For Aristocratodons, when rampant and rude, As to stop, or curtail, their allowance of food. This expedient was tried, and a proof it affords Of the' effect that short commons will have upon lords; For this whole race of bipeds, one fine summer's morn, Shed their coronets, just as a deer sheds his horn, And the moment these gewgaws fell off, they became Quite a new sort of creature—so harmless and tame, That zoologists might, for the first time, maintain 'em To be near akin to the genus humanum, And the' experiment, tried so successfully then, Should be kept in remembrance, when wanted again. SONGS OF THE CHURCH. No 1. LEAVE ME ALONE. A PASTORAL BALLAD. “We are ever standing on the defensive. All that we say to them is, ‘leave us alone.’ The Established Church is part and parcel of the constitution of this country. You are bound to conform to this constitution. We ask of you nothing more;—let us alone.”—Letter in The Times, Nov. 1838. 1838. Come, list to my pastoral tones, In clover my shepherds I keep; My stalls are well furnish'd with drones, Whose preaching invites one to sleep. At my spirit let infidels scoff, So they leave but the substance my own; For, in sooth, I'm extremely well off, If the world will but let me alone. Dissenters are grumblers, we know;— Though excellent men, in their way, They never like things to be so, Let things be however they may. But dissenting's a trick I detest; And, besides, 'tis an axiom well known, The creed that's best paid is the best, If the unpaid would let it alone. To me, I own, very surprising Your Newmans and Puseys all seem, Who start first with rationalizing, Then jump to the other extreme. Far better, 'twixt nonsense and sense, A nice half-way concern, like our own, Where piety's mix'd up with pence, And the latter are ne'er left alone. Of all our tormentors, the Press is The one that most tears us to bits; And now, Mrs. Woolfrey's “excesses,” Have thrown all its imps into fits. The dev'ls have been at us, for weeks, And there's no saying when they'll have done;— Oh dear, how I wish Mr. Breeks Had left Mrs. Woolfrey alone! If any need pray for the dead, 'Tis those to whom post-obits fall; Since wisely hath Solomon said, 'Tis “money that answereth all.” But ours be the patrons who live;— For, once in their glebe they are thrown, The dead have no living to give, And therefore we leave them alone. Though in morals we may not excel, Such perfection is rare to be had; A good life is, of course, very well, But good living is also—not bad. And when, to feed earth-worms, I go, Let this epitaph stare from my stone, “Here lies the Right Rev. so and so; “Pass, stranger, and—leave him alone.” EPISTLE FROM HENRY OF EX?T?R TO JOHN OF TUAM. Dear John, as I know, like our brother of London, You've sipp'd of all knowledge, both sacred and mundane, No doubt, in some ancient Joe Miller, you've read What Cato, that cunning old Roman, once said— That he ne'er saw two rev'rend soothsayers meet, Let it be where it might, in the shrine or the street, Without wondering the rogues, 'mid their solemn grimaces, Didn't burst out a laughing in each other's faces. Mirari se, si augur augurem aspiciens sibi temperaret a risu. What Cato then meant, though 'tis so long ago, Even we in the present times pretty well know; Having soothsayers also, who—sooth to say, John— Are no better in some points than those of days gone, And a pair of whom, meeting (between you and me), Might laugh in their sleeves, too—all lawn though they be. But this, by the way—my intention being chiefly In this, my first letter, to hint to you briefly, That, seeing how fond you of Tuum So spelled in those ancient versicles which John, we understand, frequently chants:— “Had every one Suum, You wouldn't have Tuum, But I should have Meum, And sing Te Deum.” must be, While Meum's at all times the main point with me, We scarce could do better than form an alliance, To set these sad Anti-Church times at defiance: You, John, recollect, being still to embark, With no share in the firm but your title For his keeping the title he may quote classical authority, as Horace expressly says, “Poteris servare Tuam.” —De Art. Poet. v. 329.—Chronicle. and mark; Or ev'n should you feel in your grandeur inclin'd To call yourself Pope, why, I shouldn't much mind; While my church as usual holds fast by your Tuum, And every one else's, to make it all Suum. Thus allied, I've no doubt we shall nicely agree, As no twins can be liker, in most points, than we; Both, specimens choice of that mix'd sort of beast, (See Rev. xiii. 1.) a political priest; Both mettlesome chargers, both brisk pamphleteers, Ripe and ready for all that sets men by the ears; And I, at least one, who would scorn to stick longer By any giv'n cause than I found it the stronger, And who, smooth in my turnings, as if on a swivel, When the tone ecclesiastic wo'n't do, try the civil. In short (not to bore you, ev'n jure divino) We've the same cause in common, John—all but the rhino; And that vulgar surplus, whate'er it may be, As you're not us'd to cash, John, you'd best leave to me. And so, without form—as the postman wo'n't tarry— I'm, dear Jack of Tuam, Yours, Exeter Harry. SONG OF OLD PUCK. “And those things do best please me, That befall preposterously.” Puck Junior, Midsummer Night's Dream. Who wants old Puck? for here am I, A mongrel imp, 'twixt earth and sky, Ready alike to crawl or fly; Now in the mud, now in the air, And, so 'tis for mischief, reckless where. As to my knowledge, there's no end to't, For, where I haven't it, I pretend to't; And, 'stead of taking a learn'd degree At some dull university, Puck found it handier to commence With a certain share of impudence, Which passes one off as learn'd and clever, Beyond all other degrees whatever; And enables a man of lively sconce To be Master of all the Arts at once. No matter what the science may be— Ethics, Physics, Theology, Mathematics, Hydrostatics, Aerostatics or Pneumatics— Whatever it be, I take my luck, 'Tis all the same to ancient Puck; Whose head's so full of all sorts of wares, That a brother imp, old Smugden, swears If I had but of law a little smatt'ring, I'd then be perfect Verbatim, as said. This tribute is only equalled by that of Talleyrand to his medical friend, Dr. ?: “Il se connoît en tout; et même un peu en médecine.”—which is flatt'ring. My skill as a linguist all must know Who met me abroad some months ago; (And heard me abroad exceedingly, too, In the moods and tenses of parlez vous) When, as old Chambaud's shade stood mute, I spoke such French to the Institute As puzzled those learned Thebans much, To know if 'twas Sanscrit or High Dutch, And might have pass'd with the' unobserving As one of the unknown tongues of Irving. As to my talent for ubiquity, There's nothing like it in all antiquity. Like Mungo (my peculiar care) “I'm here, I'm dere, I'm ebery where.” Song in “The Padlock.” If any one's wanted to take the chair, Upon any subject, any where, Just look around, and—Puck is there! When slaughter's at hand, your bird of prey Is never known to be out of the way; And wherever mischief's to be got, There's Puck instanter, on the spot. Only find me in negus and applause, And I'm your man for any cause. If wrong the cause, the more my delight; But I don't object to it, ev'n when right, If I only can vex some old friend by't; There's D?rh?m, for instance;—to worry him Fills up my cup of bliss to the brim! (NOTE BY THE EDITOR.) Those who are anxious to run a muck Can't do better than join with Puck. They'll find him bon diable—spite of his phiz— And, in fact, his great ambition is, While playing old Puck in first-rate style, To be thought Robin Good-fellow all the while. POLICE REPORTS. CASE OF IMPOSTURE. Among other stray flashmen, dispos'd of, this week, Was a youngster, nam'd St?nl?y, genteelly connected, Who has lately been passing off coins, as antique, Which have prov'd to be sham ones, though long unsuspected. The ancients, our readers need hardly be told, Had a coin they call'd “Talents,” for wholesale demands For an account of the coin called Talents by the ancients, see Budæus de Asse, and the other writers de Re Nummariâ.; And 'twas some of said coinage this youth was so bold As to fancy he'd got, God knows how, in his hands. People took him, however, like fools, at his word; And these talents (all priz'd at his own valuation,) Were bid for, with eagerness ev'n more absurd Than has often distinguish'd this great thinking nation. Talk of wonders one now and then sees advertiz'd, “Black swans”—“Queen Anne farthings”—or ev'n “a child's caul”— Much and justly as all these rare objects are priz'd, “St?nl?y's talents” outdid them—swans, farthings, and all! At length, some mistrust of this coin got abroad; Even quondam believers began much to doubt of it; Some rung it, some rubb'd it, suspecting a fraud— And the hard rubs it got rather took the shine out of it. Others, wishing to break the poor prodigy's fall, Said 'twas known well to all who had studied the matter, That the Greeks had not only great talents but small The Talentum Magnum and the Talentum Atticum appear to have been the same coin., And those found on the youngster were clearly the latter. While others, who view'd the grave farce with a grin— Seeing counterfeits pass thus for coinage so massy, By way of a hint to the dolts taken in, Appropriately quoted Budæus de Asse. In short, the whole sham by degrees was found out, And this coin, which they chose by such fine names to call, Prov'd a mere lacker'd article—showy, no doubt, But, ye gods, not the true Attic Talent at all. As th' impostor was still young enough to repent, And, besides, had some claims to a grandee connexion, Their Worships—considerate for once—only sent The young Thimblerig off to the House of Correction. REFLECTIONS. ADDRESSED TO THE AUTHOR OF THE ARTICLE OF THE CHURCH IN THE LAST NUMBER OF THE QUARTERLY REVIEW. I'm quite of your mind;—though these Pats cry aloud That they've got “too much Church,” 'tis all nonsense and stuff; For Church is like Love, of which Figaro vow'd That even too much of it's not quite enough. En fait d'amour, trop même n'est pas assez. —Barbier de Seville. Ay, dose them with parsons, 'twill cure all their ills;— Copy Morison's mode when from pill-box undaunted he Pours through the patient his black-coated pills, Nor cares what their quality, so there's but quantity. I verily think, 'twould be worth England's while To consider, for Paddy's own benefit, whether 'Twould not be as well to give up the green isle To the care, wear and tear of the Church altogether. The Irish are well us'd to treatment so pleasant; The harlot Church gave them to Henry Plantagenet Grant of Ireland to Henry II. by Pope Adrian., And now, if King William would make them a present To 'tother chaste lady—ye Saints, just imagine it! Chief Secs., Lord-Lieutenants, Commanders-in-chief, Might then all be cull'd from the' episcopal benches; While colonels in black would afford some relief From the hue that reminds one of the' old scarlet wench's. Think how fierce at a charge (being practis'd therein) The Right Reverend Brigadier Ph?ll?tts would slash on! How General Bl?mf?d, through thick and through thin, To the end of the chapter (or chapters) would dash on! For, in one point alone do the amply fed race Of bishops to beggars similitude bear— That, set them on horseback, in full steeple chase, And they'll ride, if not pull'd up in time—you know where. But, bless you, in Ireland, that matters not much, Where affairs have for centuries gone the same way; And a good stanch Conservative's system is such That he'd back even Beelzebub's long-founded sway. I am therefore, dear Quarterly, quite of your mind;— Church, Church, in all shapes, into Erin let's pour; And the more she rejecteth our med'cine so kind, The more let's repeat it—“Black dose, as before.” Let Coercion, that peace-maker, go hand in hand With demure-ey'd Conversion, fit sister and brother; And, covering with prisons and churches the land, All that wo'n't go to one, we'll put into the other. For the sole, leading maxim of us who're inclin'd To rule over Ireland, not well, but religiously, Is to treat her like ladies, who've just been confin'd (Or who ought to be so) and to church her prodigiously. NEW GRAND EXHIBITION OF MODELS OF THE TWO HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT. Come, step in, gentlefolks, here ye may view An exact and nat'ral representation (Like Siburn's Model of Waterloo One of the most interesting and curious of all the exhibitions of the day.) Of the Lords and Commons of this here nation. There they are—all cut out in cork— The “Collective Wisdom” wondrous to see; My eyes! when all them heads are at work, What a vastly weighty consarn it must be. As for the “wisdom,”—that may come anon; Though, to say truth, we sometimes see (And I find the phenomenon no uncommon 'un) A man who's M.P. with a head that's M.T. Our Lords are rather too small, 'tis true; But they do well enough for Cabinet shelves; And, besides,—what's a man with creeturs to do That make such werry small figures themselves? There—don't touch those lords, my pretty dears—(Aside.) Curse the children!—this comes of reforming a nation: Those meddling young brats have so damag'd my peers, I must lay in more cork for a new creation. Them yonder's our bishops—“to whom much is giv'n,” And who're ready to take as much more as you please: The seers of old times saw visions of heaven, But these holy seers see nothing but Sees. Like old Atlas The sign of the Insurance Office in Cheapside. (the chap, in Cheapside, there below,) 'Tis for so much per cent. they take heav'n on their shoulders; And joy 'tis to know that old High Church and Co., Though not capital priests, are such capitalholders. There's one on 'em, Ph?llp?ts, who now is away, As we're having him fill'd with bumbustible stuff, Small crackers and squibs, for a great gala-day, When we annually fire his Right Reverence off. 'Twould do your heart good, ma'am, then to be by, When, bursting with gunpowder, 'stead of with bile, Crack, crack, goes the bishop, while dowagers cry, “How like the dear man, both in matter and style!” Should you want a few Peers and M.P.s, to bestow, As presents to friends, we can recommend these Producing a bag full of lords and gentlemen.:— Our nobles are come down to nine-pence, you know, And we charge but a penny a piece of M.P.s. Those of bottle-corks made take most with the trade, (At least, 'mong such as my Irish writ summons,) Of old whiskey corks our O'Connells are made, But those we make Shaws and Lefroys of, are rum 'uns. So, step in, gentlefolks, &amp;c. &amp;c. Da Capo. ANNOUNCEMENT OF A NEW GRAND ACCELERATION COMPANY FOR THE PROMOTION OF THE SPEED OF LITERATURE. Loud complaints being made, in these quick-reading times, Of too slack a supply, both of prose works and rhymes, A new Company, form'd on the keep-moving plan, First propos'd by the great firm of Catch-'em-who-can, Beg to say they've now ready, in full wind and speed, Some fast-going authors, of quite a new breed— Such as not he who runs but who gallops may read— And who, if well curried and fed, they've no doubt, Will beat even Bentley's swift stud out and out. It is true, in these days, such a drug is renown, We've “Immortals” as rife as M.P.s about town; And not a Blue's rout but can off-hand supply Some invalid bard who's insur'd “not to die.” Still, let England but once try our authors, she'll find How fast they'll leave ev'n these Immortals behind; And how truly the toils of Alcides were light, Compar'd with his toil who can read all they write. In fact, there's no saying, so gainful the trade, How fast immortalities now may be made; Since Helicon never will want an “Undying One,” As long as the public continues a Buying One; And the company hope yet to witness the hour, When, by strongly applying the mare-motive “'Tis money makes the mare to go.” power, A three-decker novel, 'midst oceans of praise, May be written, launch'd, read, and—forgot, in three days! In addition to all this stupendous celerity, Which—to the no small relief of posterity— Pays off at sight the whole debit of fame, Nor troubles futurity ev'n with a name (A project that wo'n't as much tickle Tom Tegg as us, Since 'twill rob him of his second-priced Pegasus); We, the Company—still more to show how immense Is the power o'er the mind of pounds, shillings, and pence; And that not even Phœbus himself, in our day, Could get up a lay without first an outlay— Beg to add, as our literature soon may compare, In its quick make and vent, with our Birmingham ware, And it doesn't at all matter in either of these lines, How sham is the article, so it but shines,— We keep authors ready, all perch'd, pen in hand, To write off, in any giv'n style, at command. No matter what bard, be he living or dead We have lodgings apart, for our posthumous people, As we find that, if left with the live ones, they keep ill., Ask a work from his pen, and 'tis done soon as said: There being, on th' establishment, six Walter Scotts, One capital Wordsworth, and Southeys in lots;— Three choice Mrs. Nortons, all singing like syrens, While most of our pallid young clerks are Lord Byrons. Then we've ???s and ???s (for whom there's small call), And ???s and ???s (for whom no call at all). In short, whosoe'er the last “Lion” may be, We've a Bottom who'll copy his roar “Bottom: Let me play the lion; I will roar you as 'twere any nightingale.” to a T, And so well, that not one of the buyers who've got 'em Can tell which is lion, and which only Bottom. N.B.—The company, since they set up in this line, Have mov'd their concern, and are now at the sign Of the Muse's Velocipede, Fleet Street, where all Who wish well to the scheme are invited to call. SOME ACCOUNT OF THE LATE DINNER TO DAN. From tongue to tongue the rumour flew; All ask'd, aghast, “Is't true? is't true?” But none knew whether 'twas fact or fable: And still the unholy rumour ran, From Tory woman to Tory man, Though none to come at the truth was able— Till, lo, at last, the fact came out, The horrible fact, beyond all doubt, That Dan had din'd at the Viceroy's table; Had flesh'd his Popish knife and fork In the heart of th' Establish'd mutton and pork! Who can forget the deep sensation That news produc'd in this orthodox nation? Deans, rectors, curates, all agreed, If Dan was allow'd at the Castle to feed, 'Twas clearly all up with the Protestant creed! There hadn't, indeed, such an apparition Been heard of, in Dublin, since that day When, during the first grand exhibition Of Don Giovanni, that naughty play, There appear'd, as if rais'd by necromancers, An extra devil among the dancers! Yes—ev'ry one saw, with fearful thrill, That a devil too much had join'd the quadrille History of the Irish Stage.; And sulphur was smelt, and the lamps let fall A grim, green light o'er the ghastly ball, And the poor sham dev'ls didn't like it at all; For, they knew from whence th' intruder had come, Though he left, that night, his tail at home. This fact, we see, is a parallel case To the dinner that, some weeks since, took place. With the difference slight of fiend and man, It shows what a nest of Popish sinners That city must be, where the devil and Dan May thus drop in, at quadrilles and dinners! But, mark the end of these foul proceedings, These demon hops and Popish feedings. Some comfort 'twill be—to those, at least, Who've studied this awful dinner question— To know that Dan, on the night of that feast, Was seiz'd with a dreadful indigestion; That envoys were sent, post-haste, to his priest, To come and absolve the suffering sinner, For eating so much at a heretic dinner; And some good people were even afraid That Peel's old confectioner—still at the trade— Had poison'd the Papist with orangeade. NEW HOSPITAL FOR SICK LITERATI. With all humility we beg To inform the public, that Tom Tegg— Known for his spunky speculations, In buying up dead reputations, And, by a mode of galvanizing Which, all must own, is quite surprising, Making dead authors move again, As though they still were living men;— All this, too, manag'd, in a trice, By those two magic words, “Half Price,” Which brings the charm so quick about, That worn-out poets, left without A second foot whereon to stand, Are made to go at second hand;— 'Twill please the public, we repeat, To learn that Tegg, who works this feat, And, therefore, knows what care it needs To keep alive Fame's invalids, Has oped an Hospital, in town, For cases of knock'd-up renown— Falls, fractures, dangerous Epic fits (By some call'd Cantos), stabs from wits; And, of all wounds for which they're nurst, Dead cuts from publishers, the worst;— All these, and other such fatalities, That happen to frail immortalities, By Tegg are so expertly treated, That oft-times, when the cure's completed, The patient's made robust enough To stand a few more rounds of puff, Till, like the ghosts of Dante's lay, He's puff'd into thin air away! As titled poets (being phenomenons) Don't like to mix with low and common 'uns, Tegg's Hospital has separate wards, Express for literary lords, Where prose-peers, of immoderate length, Are nurs'd, when they've out grown their strength, And poets, whom their friends despair of, Are—put to bed and taken care of. Tegg begs to contradict a story, Now current both with Whig and Tory, That Doctor W?rb?t?n, M.P., Well known for his antipathy, His deadly hate, good man, to all The race of poets, great and small— So much, that he's been heard to own, He would most willingly cut down The holiest groves on Pindus' mount, To turn the timber to account!— The story actually goes, that he Prescribes at Tegg's Infirmary; And oft, not only stints, for spite, The patients in their copy-right, But that, on being call'd in lately To two sick poets, suffering greatly, This vaticidal Doctor sent them So strong a dose of Jeremy Bentham, That one of the poor bards but cried, “Oh, Jerry, Jerry!” and then died; While t'other, though less stuff was given, Is on his road, 'tis fear'd, to heaven! Of this event, howe'er unpleasant, Tegg means to say no more at present,— Intending shortly to prepare A statement of the whole affair, With full accounts, at the same time, Of some late cases (prose and rhyme), Subscrib'd with every author's name, That's now on the Sick List of Fame. RELIGION AND TRADE. “Sir Robert Peel believed it was necessary to originate all respecting religion and trade in a Committee of the House.” —Church Extension, May 22, 1830. Say, who was the wag, indecorously witty, Who first, in a statute, this libel convey'd; And thus slily referr'd to the self-same committee, As matters congenial, Religion and Trade? Oh surely, my Ph?llp?ts, 'twas thou did'st the deed; For none but thyself, or some pluralist brother, Accustom'd to mix up the craft with the creed, Could bring such a pair thus to twin with each other. And yet, when one thinks of times present and gone, One is forc'd to confess, on maturer reflection, That 'tisn't in the eyes of committees alone That the shrine and the shop seem to have some connection. Not to mention those monarchs of Asia's fair land, Whose civil list all is in “god-money” paid; And where the whole people, by royal command, Buy their gods at the government mart, ready made The Birmans may not buy the sacred marble in mass but must purchase figures of the deity already made. —Symes.;— There was also (as mention'd, in rhyme and in prose, is) Gold heap'd, throughout Egypt, on every shrine, To make rings for right reverend crocodiles' noses— Just such as, my Ph?llp?ts, would look well in thine. But one needn't fly off, in this erudite mood; And 'tis clear, without going to regions so sunny, That priests love to do the least possible good, For the largest most possible quantum of money. “Of him,” saith the text, “unto whom much is given, “Of him much, in turn, will be also required:”— “By me,” quoth the sleek and obese man of heaven— “Give as much as you will—more will still be desir'd.” More money! more churches!—oh Nimrod, had'st thou 'Stead of Tower-extension, some shorter way gone— Had'st thou known by what methods we mount to heav'n now, And tried Church-extension, the feat had been done! MUSINGS, SUGGESTED BY THE LATE PROMOTION OF MRS. NETHERCOAT. “The widow Nethercoat is appointed gaoler of Loughrea, in the room of her deceased husband.” —Limerick Chronicle. Whether as queens or subjects, in these days, Women seem form'd to grace alike each station;— As Captain Flaherty gallantly says, “You, ladies, are the lords of the creation!” Thus o'er my mind did prescient visions float Of all that matchless woman yet may be; When, hark, in rumours less and less remote, Came the glad news o'er Erin's ambient sea, The important news—that Mrs. Nethercoat Had been appointed gaoler of Loughrea; Yes, mark it, History—Nethercoat is dead, And Mrs. N. now rules his realm instead; Hers the high task to wield the' uplocking keys, To rivet rogues and reign o'er Rapparees! Thus, while your blust'rers of the Tory school Find Ireland's sanest sons so hard to rule, One meek-ey'd matron, in Whig doctrines nurst, Is all that's ask'd to curb the maddest, worst! Show me the man that dares, with blushless brow, Prate about Erin's rage and riot now;— Now, when her temperance forms her sole excess; When long-lov'd whiskey, fading from her sight, “Small by degrees, and beautifully less,” Will soon, like other spirits, vanish quite; When of red coats the number's grown so small, That soon, to cheer the warlike parson's eyes, No glimpse of scarlet will be seen at all, Save that which she of Babylon supplies;— Or, at the most, a corporal's guard will be, Of Ireland's red defence the sole remains; While of its gaols bright woman keeps the key, And captive Paddies languish in her chains! Long may such lot be Erin's, long be mine! Oh yes—if ev'n this world, though bright it shine, In Wisdom's eyes a prison-house must be, At least let woman's hand our fetters twine, And blithe I'll sing, more joyous than if free, The Nethercoats, the Nethercoats for me! INTENDED TRIBUTE TO THE AUTHOR OF AN ARTICLE IN THE LAST NUMBER OF THE QUARTERLY REVIEW, ENTITLED “ROMANISM IN IRELAND.” It glads us much to be able to say, That a meeting is fix'd, for some early day, Of all such dowagers—he or she— (No matter the sex, so they dowagers be,) Whose opinions, concerning Church and State, From about the time of the Curfew date— Staunch sticklers still for days by-gone, And admiring them for their rust alone— To whom if we would a leader give, Worthy their tastes conservative, We need but some mummy-statesman raise, Who was pickled and potted in Ptolemy's days; For that's the man, if waked from his shelf To conserve and swaddle this world, like himself. Such, we're happy to state, are the old he-dames Who've met in committee, and given their names (In good hieroglyphics), with kind intent To pay some handsome compliment To their sister-author, the nameless he, Who wrote, in the last new Quarterly, That charming assault upon Popery; An article justly prized by them, As a perfect antediluvian gem— The work, as Sir Sampson Legend would say, Of some “fellow the Flood couldn't wash away.” See Congreve's Love for Love. The fund being rais'd, there remain'd but to see What the dowager-author's gift was to be. And here, I must say, the Sisters Blue Show'd delicate taste and judgment too. For, finding the poor man suffering greatly From the awful stuff he has thrown up lately— So much so, indeed, to the alarm of all, As to bring on a fit of what doctors call The Antipapistico-monomania (I'm sorry with such a long word to detain ye), They've acted the part of a kind physician, By suiting their gift to the patient's condition; And, as soon as 'tis ready for presentation, We shall publish the facts, for the gratification Of this highly-favour'd and Protestant nation. Meanwhile, to the great alarm of his neighbours, He still continues his Quarterly labours; And often has strong No-Popery fits, Which frighten his old nurse out of her wits. Sometimes he screams, like Scrub in the play Beaux Stratagem., “Thieves! Jesuits! Popery!” night and day; Takes the Printer's Devil for Doctor Dens The writer of the article has groped about, with much success, in what he calls “the dark recesses of Dr. Dens's disquisitions.” —Quarterly Review., And shies at him heaps of High-church pens “Pray, may we ask, has there been any rebellious movement of Popery in Ireland, since the planting of the Ulster colonies, in which something of the kind was not visible among the Presbyterians of the North?” —Ibid.; Which the Devil (himself a touchy Dissenter) Feels all in his hide, like arrows, enter. 'Stead of swallowing wholesome stuff from the druggist's, He will keep raving of “Irish Thuggists “Lord Lorton, for instance, who, for clearing his estate of a village of Irish Thuggists,” &amp;c. &amp;c. —Quarterly Review.;” Tells us they all go murd'ring, for fun, From rise of morn till set of sun, Pop, pop, as fast as a minute-gun! “Observe how murder after murder is committed like minute-guns.” —Ibid. If ask'd, how comes it the gown and cassock are Safe and fat, 'mid this general massacre— How haps it that Pat's own population But swarms the more for this trucidation— He refers you, for all such memoranda, To the “archives of the Propaganda!” “Might not the archives of the Propaganda possibly supply the key?” This is all we've got, for the present, to say— But shall take up the subject some future day. GRAND DINNER OF TYPE AND CO. A POOR POET'S DREAM. Written during the late agitation of the question of Copyright. As I sate in my study, lone and still, Thinking of Sergeant Talfourd's Bill, And the speech by Lawyer Sugden made, In spirit congenial, for “the Trade,” Sudden I sunk to sleep, and, lo, Upon Fancy's reinless night-mare flitting, I found myself, in a second or so, At the table of Messrs. Type and Co. With a goodly group of diners sitting;— All in the printing and publishing line, Drest, I thought, extremely fine, And sipping, like lords, their rosy wine; While I, in a state near inanition, With coat that hadn't much nap to spare (Having just gone into its second edition), Was the only wretch of an author there. But think, how great was my surprise, When I saw, in casting round my eyes, That the dishes, sent up by Type's she-cooks, Bore all, in appearance, the shape of books; Large folios—God knows where they got 'em, In these small times—at top and bottom; And quartos (such as the Press provides For no one to read them) down the sides. Then flash'd a horrible thought on my brain, And I said to myself, “'Tis all too plain, “Like those, well known in school quotations, “Who ate up for dinner their own relations, “I see now, before me, smoking here, “The bodies and bones of my brethren dear;— “Bright sons of the lyric and epic Muse, “All cut up in cutlets, or hash'd in stews; “Their works, a light through ages to go,— “Themselves, eaten up by Type and Co.!” While thus I moralized, on they went, Finding the fare most excellent; And all so kindly, brother to brother, Helping the tidbits to each other: “A slice of Southey let me send you”— “This cut of Campbell I recommend you”— “And here, my friends, is a treat indeed, “The immortal Wordsworth fricassee'd!” Thus having, the cormorants, fed some time, Upon joints of poetry—all of the prime— With also (as Type in a whisper averr'd it) “Cold prose on the sideboard, for such as preferr'd it”— They rested awhile, to recruit their force, Then pounc'd, like kites, on the second course, Which was singing-birds merely—Moore and others— Who all went the way of their larger brothers; And, num'rous now though such songsters be, 'Twas really quite distressing to see A whole dishful of Toms—Moore, Dibdin, Bayly,— Bolted by Type and Co. so gaily! Nor was this the worst—I shudder to think What a scene was disclos'd when they came to drink. The warriors of Odin, as every one knows, Used to drink out of skulls of slaughter'd foes: And Type's old port, to my horror I found, Was in skulls of bards sent merrily round. And still as each well-fill'd cranium came, A health was pledg'd to its owner's name; While Type said slily, midst general laughter, “We eat them up first, then drink to them after.” There was no standing this—incensed I broke From my bonds of sleep, and indignant woke, Exclaiming, “Oh shades of other times, “Whose voices still sound, like deathless chimes, “Could you e'er have foretold a day would be, “When a dreamer of dreams should live to see “A party of sleek and honest John Bulls “Hobnobbing each other in poets' skulls!” CHURCH EXTENSION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE MORNING CHRONICLE. Sir—A well-known classical traveller, while employed in exploring, some time since, the supposed site of the Temple of Diana of Ephesus, was so fortunate, in the course of his researches, as to light upon a very ancient bark manuscript, which has turned out, on examination, to be part of an old Ephesian newspaper;—a newspaper published, as you will see, so far back as the time when Demetrius, the great Shrine-Extender “For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen; whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.” —Acts, xix., flourished. I am, Sir, yours, &amp;c. EPHESIAN GAZETTE. Second edition. Important event for the rich and religious! Great Meeting of Silversmiths held in Queen Square;— Church Extension, their object,—the' excitement prodigious;— Demetrius, head man of the craft, takes the chair! Third edition. The Chairman still up, when our dev'l came away; Having prefac'd his speech with the usual state prayer, That the Three-headed Dian Tria Virginis ora Dianæ. would kindly, this day, Take the Silversmiths' Company under her care. Being ask'd by some low, unestablish'd divines, “When your churches are up, where are flocks to be got?” He manfully answer'd, “Let us build the shrines The “shrines” are supposed to have been small churches, or chapels, adjoining to the great temples;—“ædiculæ, in quibus statuæ reponebantur.” —Erasm., “And we care not if flocks are found for them or not.” He then added—to show that the Silversmiths' Guild Were above all confin'd and intolerant views— “Only pay through the nose to the altars we build, “You may pray through the nose to what altars you choose.” This tolerance, rare from a shrine-dealer's lip (Though a tolerance mix'd with due taste for the till)— So much charm'd all the holders of scriptural scrip, That their shouts of “Hear!” “Hear!” are reechoing still. Fourth edition. Great stir in the Shrine Market! altars to Phœbus Are going dog-cheap—may be had for a rebus. Old Dian's, as usual, outsell all the rest;— But Venus's also are much in request. LATEST ACCOUNTS FROM OLYMPUS. As news from Olympus has grown rather rare, Since bards, in their cruises, have ceas'd to touch there, We extract for our readers the' intelligence given, In our latest accounts from that ci-devant Heaven— That realm of the By-gones, where still sit, in state, Old god-heads and nod-heads, now long out of date. Jove himself, it appears, since his love-days are o'er, Seems to find immortality rather a bore; Though he still asks for news of earth's capers and crimes, And reads daily his old fellow-Thund'rer, the Times. He and Vulcan, it seems, by their wives still hen-peck'd are, And kept on a stinted allowance of nectar. Old Phœbus, poor lad, has given up inspiration, And pack'd off to earth on a puff-speculation. The fact is, he found his old shrines had grown dim, Since bards look'd to Bentley and Colburn, not him. So, he sold off his stud of ambrosia-fed nags, Came incog. down to earth, and now writes for the Mags; Taking care that his work not a gleam hath to linger in't, From which men could guess that the god had a finger in't. There are other small facts, well deserving attention, Of which our Olympic despatches make mention. Poor Bacchus is still very ill, they allege, Having never recover'd the Temperance Pledge. “What, the Irish!” he cried—“those I look'd to the most! “If they give up the spirit, I give up the ghost:” While Momus, who us'd of the gods to make fun, Is turn'd Socialist now, and declares there are none! But these changes, though curious, are all a mere farce Compared to the new “casus belli” of Mars, Who, for years, has been suffering the horrors of quiet, Uncheer'd by one glimmer of bloodshed or riot! In vain from the clouds his belligerent brow Did he pop forth, in hopes that somewhere or somehow, Like Pat at a fair, he might “coax up a row:” But the joke wouldn't take—the whole world had got wiser; Men liked not to take a Great Gun for adviser; And, still less, to march in fine clothes to be shot, Without very well knowing for whom or for what. The French, who of slaughter had had their full swing, Were content with a shot, now and then, at their King; While, in England, good fighting's a pastime so hard to gain, Nobody's left to fight with, but Lord C?rd?g?n. 'Tis needless to say, then, how monstrously happy Old Mars has been made by what's now on the tapis; How much it delights him to see the French rally, In Liberty's name, around Mehemet Ali; Well knowing that Satan himself could not find A confection of mischief much more to his mind Than the old Bonnet Rouge and the Bashaw combin'd. Right well, too, he knows, that there ne'er were attackers, Whatever their cause, that they didn't find backers; While any slight care for Humanity's woes May be soothed by that “Art Diplomatique,” which shows How to come, in the most approv'd method, to blows. This is all, for to-day—whether Mars is much vext At his friend Thiers's exit, we'll know by our next. THE TRIUMPHS OF FARCE. Our earth, as it rolls through the regions of space, Wears always two faces, the dark and the sunny; And poor human life runs the same sort of race, Being sad, on one side—on the other side, funny. Thus oft we, at eve, to the Haymarket hie, To weep o'er the woes of Macready;—but scarce Hath the tear-drop of Tragedy pass'd from the eye, When, lo, we're all laughing in fits at the Farce. And still let us laugh—preach the world as it may— Where the cream of the joke is, the swarm will soon follow; Heroics are very grand things, in their way, But the laugh at the long run will carry it hollow. For instance, what sermon on human affairs Could equal the scene that took place t'other day 'Twixt Romeo and Louis Philippe, on the stairs— The Sublime and Ridiculous meeting half-way! Yes, Jocus! gay god, whom the Gentiles supplied, And whose worship not ev'n among Christians declines, In our senate thou'st languish'd since Sheridan died, But Sydney still keeps thee alive in our shrines. Rare Sydney! thrice honour'd the stall where he sits, And be his ev'ry honour he deigneth to climb at! Had England a hierarchy form'd all of wits, Who but Sydney would England proclaim as its primate? And long may he flourish, frank, merry, and brave— A Horace to hear, and a Paschal to read Some parts of the Provinciales may be said to be of the highest order of jeux d'esprit, or squibs.; While he laughs, all is safe, but, when Sydney grows grave, We shall then think the Church is in danger indeed. Meanwhile, it much glads us to find he's preparing To teach other bishops to “seek the right way “This stroll in the metropolis is extremely well contrived for your Lordship's speech; but suppose, my dear Lord, that instead of going E. and N. E. you had turned about,” &amp;c. &amp;c.—Sydney Smith's Last Letter to the Bishop of London.;” And means shortly to treat the whole Bench to an airing, Just such as he gave to Charles James t'other day. For our parts, though gravity's good for the soul, Such a fancy have we for the side that there's fun on, We'd rather with Sydney south-west take a “stroll,” Than coach it north-east with his Lordship of Lunnun. THOUGHTS ON PATRONS, PUFFS, AND OTHER MATTERS. IN AN EPISTLE FROM T. M. TO S. R. What, thou, my friend! a man of rhymes, And, better still, a man of guineas, To talk of “patrons,” in these times, When authors thrive, like spinning-jennies, And Arkwright's twist and Bulwer's page Alike may laugh at patronage! No, no—those times are past away, When, doom'd in upper floors to star it, The bard inscrib'd to lords his lay,— Himself, the while, my Lord Mountgarret. No more he begs, with air dependent, His “little bark may sail attendant” Under some lordly skipper's steerage; But launch'd triumphant in the Row, Or ta'en by Murray's self in tow, Cuts both Star Chamber and the peerage. Patrons, indeed! when scarce a sail Is whisk'd from England by the gale, But bears on board some authors, shipp'd For foreign shores, all well equipp'd With proper book-making machinery, To sketch the morals, manners, scenery, Of all such lands as they shall see, Or not see, as the case may be:— It being enjoin'd on all who go To study first Miss M????????, And learn from her the method true, To do one's books—and readers, too. For so this nymph of nous and nerve Teaches mankind “How to Observe;” And, lest mankind at all should swerve, Teaches them also “What to Observe.” No, no, my friend—it can't be blink'd— The Patron is a race extinct; As dead as any Megatherion That ever Buckland built a theory on. Instead of bartering, in this age, Our praise for pence and patronage, We, authors, now, more prosperous elves, Have learn'd to patronise ourselves; And since all-potent Puffing's made The life of song, the soul of trade, More frugal of our praises grown, We puff no merits but our own. Unlike those feeble gales of praise Which critics blew in former days, Our modern puffs are of a kind That truly, really raise the wind; And since they've fairly set in blowing, We find them the best trade-winds going. 'Stead of frequenting paths so slippy As her old haunts near Aganippe, The Muse, now, taking to the till, Has open'd shop on Ludgate Hill (Far handier than the Hill of Pindus, As seen from bard's back attic windows); And swallowing there without cessation Large draughts (at sight) of inspiration, Touches the notes for each new theme, While still fresh “change comes o'er her dream.” What Steam is on the deep—and more— Is the vast power of Puff on shore; Which jumps to glory's future tenses Before the present ev'n commences; And makes “immortal” and “divine” of us Before the world has read one line of us. In old times, when the God of Song Drove his own two-horse team along, Carrying inside a bard or two, Book'd for posterity “all through;”— Their luggage, a few close-pack'd rhymes, (Like yours, my friend,) for after-times— So slow the pull to Fame's abode, That folks oft slept upon the road;— And Homer's self, sometimes, they say, Took to his nightcap on the way. Quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus. —Horat. Ye Gods! how different is the story With our new galloping sons of glory, Who, scorning all such slack and slow time, Dash to posterity in no time! Raise but one general blast of Puff To start your author—that's enough. In vain the critics, set to watch him, Try at the starting post to catch him: He's off—the puffers carry it hollow— The critics, if they please, may follow. Ere they've laid down their first positions, He's fairly blown through six editions! In vain doth Edinburgh dispense Her blue and yellow pestilence (That plague so awful in my time To young and touchy sons of rhyme)— The Quarterly, at three months' date, To catch the' Unread One, comes too late; And nonsense, litter'd in a hurry, Becomes “immortal,” spite of Murray. But, bless me!—while I thus keep fooling, I hear a voice cry, “Dinner's cooling.” That postman, too, (who, truth to tell, 'Mong men of letters bears the bell,) Keeps ringing, ringing, so infernally That I must stop— Yours sempiternally. THOUGHTS ON MISCHIEF. BY LORD ST?NL?Y. (HIS FIRST ATTEMPT IN VERSE.) “Evil, be thou my good.” Milton. How various are the inspirations Of different men, in different nations! As genius prompts to good or evil, Some call the Muse, some raise the devil. Old Socrates, that pink of sages, Kept a pet demon, on board wages, To go about with him incog., And sometimes give his wits a jog. So L?nd?st, in our day, we know, Keeps fresh relays of imps below, To forward, from that nameless spot, His inspirations, hot and hot. But, neat as are old L?nd?st's doings— Beyond ev'n Hecate's “hell-broth” brewings— Had I, Lord Stanley, but my will, I'd show you mischief prettier still; Mischief, combining boyhoods' tricks With age's sourest politics; The urchin's freaks, the vet'ran's gall, Both duly mix'd, and matchless all; A compound nought in history reaches But Machiavel, when first in breeches! Yes, Mischief, Goddess multiform, Whene'er thou, witch-like, rids't the storm, Let Stanley ride cockhorse behind thee— No livelier lackey could they find thee. And, Goddess, as I'm well aware, So mischief's done, you care not where, I own, 'twill most my fancy tickle In Paddyland to play the Pickle; Having got credit for inventing A new, brisk method of tormenting— A way, they call the Stanley fashion, Which puts all Ireland in a passion; So neat it hits the mixture due Of injury and insult too; So legibly it bears upon't The stamp of Stanley's brazen front. Ireland, we're told, means land of Ire; And why she's so, none need inquire, Who sees her millions, martial, manly, Spat upon thus by me, Lord St?nl?y. Already in the breeze I scent The whiff of coming devilment; Of strife, to me more stirring far Than the' Opium or the Sulphur war, Or any such drug ferments are. Yes—sweeter to this Tory soul Than all such pests, from pole to pole, Is the rich, “swelter'd venom” got By stirring Ireland's “charmed pot Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.”;” And, thanks to practice on that land, I stir it with a master-hand. Again thou'lt see, when forth hath gone The War-Church-cry, “On, Stanley, on!” How Caravats and Shanavests Shall swarm from out their mountain nests, With all their merry moonlight brothers, To whom the Church (step-dame to others) Hath been the best of nursing mothers. Again o'er Erin's rich domain Shall Rockites and right reverends reign; And both, exempt from vulgar toil, Between them share that titheful soil; Puzzling ambition which to climb at, The post of Captain, or of Primate. And so, long life to Church and Co.— Hurrah for mischief!—here we go. EPISTLE FROM CAPTAIN ROCK TO LORD L?NDH?T. Dear L?ndh?t,—you'll pardon my making thus free,— But form is all fudge 'twixt such “comrogues” as we, Who, whate'er the smooth views we, in public, may drive at, Have both the same praiseworthy object, in private— Namely, never to let the old regions of riot, Where Rock hath long reign'd, have one instant of quiet, But keep Ireland still in that liquid we've taught her To love more than meat, drink, or clothing—hot water. All the diff'rence betwixt you and me, as I take it, Is simply, that you make the law and I break it; And never, of big-wigs and small, were there two Play'd so well into each other's hands as we do; Insomuch, that the laws you and yours manufacture, Seem all made express for the Rock-boys to fracture. Not Birmingham's self—to her shame be it spoken— E'er made things more neatly contriv'd to be broken; And hence, I confess, in this island religious, The breakage of laws—and of heads is prodigious. And long may it thrive, my Ex-Bigwig, say I,— Though, of late, much I fear'd all our fun was gone by; As, except when some tithe-hunting parson show'd sport, Some rector—a cool hand at pistols and port, Who “keeps dry” his powder, but never himself— One who, leaving his Bible to rust on the shelf, Sends his pious texts home, in the shape of ball-cartridges, Shooting his “dearly beloved,” like partridges;— Except when some hero of this sort turn'd out, Or, the' Exchequer sent, flaming, its tithe-writs Exchequer tithe processes, served under a commission of rebellion. —Chronicle. about— A contrivance more neat, I may say, without flattery, Than e'er yet was thought of for bloodshed and battery; So neat, that even I might be proud, I allow, To have hit off so rich a receipt for a row;— Except for such rigs turning up, now and then, I was actually growing the dullest of men; And, had this blank fit been allow'd to increase, Might have snor'd myself down to a Justice of Peace. Like you, Reformation in Church and in State Is the thing of all things I most cordially hate. If once these curst Ministers do as they like, All's o'er, my good Lord, with your wig and my pike, And one may be hung up on t'other, henceforth, Just to show what such Captains and Chanc'llors were worth. But we must not despair—ev'n already Hope sees You're about, my bold Baron, to kick up a breeze Of the true baffling sort, such as suits me and you, Who have box'd the whole compass of party right through, And care not one farthing, as all the world knows, So we but raise the wind, from what quarter it blows, Forgive me, dear Lord, that thus rudely I dare My own small resources with thine to compare: Not ev'n Jerry Didler, in “raising the wind,” durst Compete, for one instant, with thee, my dear L?ndh?t. But, hark, there's a shot!—some parsonic practitioner? No—merely a bran-new Rebellion Commissioner; The Courts having now, with true law erudition, Put even Rebellion itself “in commission.” As seldom, in this way, I'm any man's debtor, I'll just pay my shot, and then fold up this letter. In the mean time, hurrah for the Tories and Rocks! Hurrah for the parsons who fleece well their flocks! Hurrah for all mischief in all ranks and spheres, And, above all, hurrah for that dear House of Peers! CAPTAIN ROCK IN LONDON. LETTER FROM THE CAPTAIN TO TERRY ALT, ESQ. The subordinate officer or lieutenant of Captain Rock. Here I am, at head-quarters, dear Terry, once more, Deep in Tory designs, as I've oft been before:— For, bless them! if 'twasn't for this wrong-headed crew, You and I, Terry Alt, would scarce know what to do; So ready they're always, when dull we are growing, To set our old concert of discord a-going, While L?ndh?t's the lad, with his Tory-Whig face, To play, in such concert, the true double-base. I had fear'd this old prop of my realm was beginning To tire of his course of political sinning, And, like Mother Cole, when her heyday was past, Meant, by way of a change, to try virtue at last. But I wrong'd the old boy, who as staunchly derides All reform in himself as in most things besides; And, by using two faces through life, all allow, Has acquir'd face sufficient for any thing now. In short, he's all right; and, if mankind's old foe, My “Lord Harry” himself—who's the leader, we know, Of another red-hot Opposition, below— If that “Lord,” in his well-known discernment, but spares Me and L?ndh?t, to look after Ireland's affairs, We shall soon such a region of devilment make it, That Old Nick himself for his own may mistake it. Ev'n already—long life to such Big-wigs, say I, For, as long as they flourish, we Rocks cannot die— He has serv'd our right riotous cause by a speech Whose perfection of mischief he only could reach; As it shows off both his and my merits alike, Both the swell of the wig, and the point of the pike; Mixes up, with a skill which one can't but admire, The lawyer's cool craft with the' incendiary's fire, And enlists, in the gravest, most plausible manner, Seven millions of souls under Rockery's banner! Oh Terry, my man, let this speech never die; Through the regions of Rockland, like flame, let it fly; Let each syllable dark the Law-Oracle utter'd By all Tipperary's wild echoes be mutter'd, Till nought shall be heard, over hill, dale, or flood, But “You're aliens in language, in creed, and in blood;” While voices, from sweet Connemara afar, Shall answer, like true Irish echoes, “We are!” And, though false be the cry, and though sense must abhor it, Still the' echoes may quote Law authority for it, And nought L?ndh?t cares for my spread of dominion So he, in the end, touches cash “for the' opinion.” But I've no time for more, my dear Terry, just now, Being busy in helping these Lords through their row. They're bad hands at mob-work, but, once they begin, They'll have plenty of practice to break them well in. THE FUDGES IN ENGLAND; BEING A SEQUEL TO THE “FUDGE FAMILY IN PARIS.” LETTER I. FROM PATRICK MAGAN, ESQ., TO THE REV. RICHARD ?, CURATE OF ?, IN IRELAND. Who d'ye think we've got here?—quite reformed from the giddy, Fantastic young thing, that once made such a noise— Why, the famous Miss Fudge—that delectable Biddy, Whom you and I saw once at Paris, when boys, In the full blaze of bonnets, and ribands, and airs— Such a thing as no rainbow hath colours to paint; Ere time had reduced her to wrinkles and prayers, And the Flirt found a decent retreat in the Saint. Poor “Pa” hath popp'd off—gone, as charity judges, To some choice Elysium reserv'd for the Fudges; And Miss, with a fortune, besides expectations From some much revered and much-palsied relations, Now wants but a husband, with requisites meet,— Age thirty, or thereabouts—stature six feet, And warranted godly—to make all complete. Nota bene—a Churchman would suit, if he's high, But Socinians or Catholics need not apply. What say you, Dick? doesn't this tempt your ambition? The whole wealth of Fudge, that renown'd man of pith, All brought to the hammer, for Church competition,— Sole encumbrance, Miss Fudge to be taken therewith. Think, my boy, for a Curate how glorious a catch! While, instead of the thousands of souls you now watch, To save Biddy Fudge's is all you need do; And her purse will, meanwhile, be the saving of you. You may ask, Dick, how comes it that I, a poor elf, Wanting substance ev'n more than your spiritual self, Should thus generously lay my own claims on the shelf, When, God knows! there ne'er was young gentleman yet So much lack'd an old spinster to rid him from debt, Or had cogenter reasons than mine to assail her With tender love-suit—at the suit of his tailor. But thereby there hangs a soft secret, my friend, Which thus to your reverend breast I commend: Miss Fudge hath a niece—such a creature!—with eyes Like those sparklers that peep out from summer-night skies At astronomers-royal, and laugh with delight To see elderly gentlemen spying all night. While her figure—oh, bring all the gracefullest things That are borne through the light air by feet or by wings, Not a single new grace to that form could they teach, Which combines in itself the perfection of each; While, rapid or slow, as her fairy feet fall, The mute music of symmetry modulates all. Ne'er, in short, was there creature more form'd to bewilder A gay youth like me, who of castles aërial (And only of such) am, God help me! a builder; Still peopling each mansion with lodgers ethereal, And now, to this nymph of the seraph-like eye, Letting out, as you see, my first floor next the sky. That floor which a facetious garreteer called “le premier en descendant du ciel.” But, alas! nothing's perfect on earth—even she, This divine little gipsy, does odd things sometimes; Talks learning—looks wise (rather painful to see), Prints already in two County papers her rhymes; And raves—the sweet, charming, absurd little dear! About Amulets, Bijous, and Keepsakes, next year, In a manner which plainly bad symptoms portends Of that Annual blue fit, so distressing to friends; A fit which, though lasting but one short edition, Leaves the patient long after in sad inanition. However, let's hope for the best—and, meanwhile, Be it mine still to bask in the niece's warm smile; While you, if you're wise, Dick, will play the gallant (Uphill work, I confess,) to her Saint of an Aunt. Think, my boy, for a youngster like you, who've a lack, Not indeed of rupees, but of all other specie, What luck thus to find a kind witch at your back, An old goose with gold eggs, from all debts to release ye! Never mind, tho' the spinster be reverend and thin, What are all the Three Graces to her Three per Cents.?

LETTER II. FROM MISS BIDDY FUDGE, TO MRS. ELIZABETH ?. Just in time for the post, dear, and monstrously busy, With godly concernments—and worldly ones, too; Things carnal and spiritual mix'd, my dear Lizzy, In this little brain till, bewilder'd and dizzy, 'Twixt heaven and earth, I scarce know what I do. First, I've been to see all the gay fashions from Town, Which our favourite Miss Gimp for the spring has had down. Sleeves still worn (which I think is wise), à la folle, Charming hats, pou de soie—though the shape rather droll. But you can't think how nicely the caps of tulle lace, With the mentonnières, look on this poor sinful face; And I mean, if the Lord in his mercy thinks right, To wear one at Mrs. Fitz-wigram's to-night. The silks are quite heav'nly:—I'm glad, too, to say, Gimp herself grows more godly and good every day; Hath had sweet experience—yea, ev'n doth begin To turn from the Gentiles, and put away sin— And all since her last stock of goods was laid in. What a blessing one's milliner, careless of pelf, Should thus “walk in newness” as well as one's self! So much for the blessings, the comforts of Spirit I've had since we met, and they're more than I merit!— Poor, sinful, weak creature in every respect, Though ordain'd (God knows why) to be one of the' Elect. But now for the picture's reverse.—You remember That footman and cook-maid I hired last December; He, a Baptist Particular—she, of some sect Not particular, I fancy, in any respect; But desirous, poor thing, to be fed with the Word, And “to wait,” as she said, “on Miss Fudge and the Lord.” Well, my dear, of all men, that Particular Baptist At preaching a sermon, off hand, was the aptest; And, long as he staid, do him justice, more rich in Sweet savours of doctrine, there never was kitchen. He preach'd in the parlour, he preach'd in the hall, He preach'd to the chambermaids, scullions, and all. All heard with delight his reprovings of sin, But above all, the cook-maid;—oh, ne'er would she tire— Though, in learning to save sinful souls from the fire She would oft let the soles she was frying fall in. (God forgive me for punning on points thus of piety!— A sad trick I've learn'd in Bob's heathen society.) But ah! there remains still the worst of my tale; Come, Ast'risks, and help me the sad truth to veil— Conscious stars, that at ev'n your own secret turn pale! In short, dear, this preaching and psalm-singing pair, Chosen “vessels of mercy,” as I thought they were, Have together this last week eloped; making bold To whip off as much goods as both vessels could hold— Not forgetting some scores of sweet Tracts from my shelves, Two Family Bibles as large as themselves, And besides, from the drawer—I neglecting to lock it— My neat “Morning Manna, done up for the pocket.” “Morning Manna, or British Verse-book, neatly done up for the pocket,” and chiefly intended to assist the members of the British Verse Association, whose design is, we are told, “to induce the inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland to commit one and the same verse of Scripture to memory every morning. Already, it is known, several thousand persons in Scotland, besides tens of thousands in America and Africa, are every morning learning the same verse.” Was there e'er known a case so distressing, dear Liz? It has made me quite ill:—and the worst of it is, When rogues are all pious, 'tis hard to detect Which rogues are the reprobate, which the elect. This man “had a call,” he said—impudent mockery! What call had he to my linen and crockery? I'm now, and have been for this week past, in chase Of some godly young couple this pair to replace. The inclos'd two announcements have just met my eyes, In that ven'rable Monthly where Saints advertise For such temporal comforts as this world supplies The Evangelical Magazine.—A few specimens taken at random from the wrapper of this highly esteemed periodical; will fully justify the character which Miss Fudge has here given of it. “Wanted, in a pious pawnbroker's family, an active lad as an apprentice.” “Wanted, as housemaid, a young female who has been brought to a saving knowledge of the truth.” “Wanted immediately, a man of decided piety, to assist in the baking business.” “A gentleman who understands the Wine Trade is desirous of entering into partnership, &amp;c. &amp;c. He is not desirous of being connected with any one whose system of business is not of the strictest integrity as in the sight of God, and seeks connection only with a truly pious man, either Churchman or Dissenter.”; And the fruits of the Spirit are properly made An essential in every craft, calling, and trade. Where the' attorney requires for his 'prentice some youth Who has “learn'd to fear God and to walk in the truth;” Where the sempstress, in search of employment, declares, That pay is no object, so she can have prayers; And the' Establish'd Wine Company proudly gives out That the whole of the firm, Co. and all, are devout, Happy London, one feels, as one reads o'er the pages, Where Saints are so much more abundant than sages; Where Parsons may soon be all laid on the shelf, As each Cit can cite chapter and verse for himself, And the serious frequenters of market and dock All lay in religion as part of their stock. According to the late Mr. Irving, there is even a peculiar form of theology got up expressly for the money-market. “I know how far wide,” he says, “of the mark my views of Christ's work in the flesh will be viewed by those who are working with the stock-jobbing theology of the religious world.” “Let these preachers,” he adds, “(for I will not call them theologians), cry up, broker-like, their article.” Morning Watch.—No. iii. 442, 443. From the statement of another writer, in the same publication, it would appear that the stock-brokers have even set up a new Divinity of their own. “This shows,” says the writer in question, “that the doctrine of the union between Christ and his members is quite as essential as that of substitution, by taking which latter alone the Stock-Exchange Divinity has been produced.” —No. x. p. 375. Among the ancients, we know the money-market was provided with more than one presiding Deity—“Deæ Pecuniæ (says an ancient author) commendabantur ut pecuniosi essent.” Who can tell to what lengths we may go on improving, When thus thro' all London the Spirit keeps moving, And heaven's so in vogue, that each shop advertisement Is now not so much for the earth as the skies meant? P.S. Have mislaid the two paragraphs—can't stop to look, But both describe charming—both Footman and Cook. She, “decidedly pious”—with pathos deplores The' increase of French cook'ry, and sin on our shores; And adds—(while for further accounts she refers To a great Gospel preacher, a cousin of hers,) That “though some make their Sabbaths mere matter-of-fun days, She asks but for tea and the Gospel, on Sundays.” The footman, too, full of the true saving knowledge;— Has late been to Cambridge—to Trinity College; Serv'd last a young gentleman, studying divinity, But left—not approving the morals of Trinity. P.S. I inclose, too, according to promise, some scraps Of my Journal—that Day-book I keep of my heart; Where, at some little items, (partaking, perhaps, More of earth than of heaven,) thy prud'ry may start, And suspect something tender, sly girl as thou art. For the present, I'm mute—but, whate'er may befall, Recollect, dear, (in Hebrews, xiii. 4.) St. Paul Hath himself declar'd, “marriage is honourable in all.” EXTRACTS FROM MY DIARY. Monday. Tried a new châlé gown on—pretty. No one to see me in it—pity! Flew in a passion with Friz, my maid;— The Lord forgive me!—she look'd dismay'd; But got her to sing the 100th Psalm, While she curl'd my hair, which made me calm. Nothing so soothes a Christian heart As sacred music—heavenly art! Tuesday. At two, a visit from Mr. Magan— A remarkably handsome, nice young man; And, all Hibernian though he be, As civilis'd, strange to say, as we! I own this young man's spiritual state Hath much engross'd my thoughts of late; And I mean, as soon as my niece is gone, To have some talk with him thereupon. At present, I nought can do or say, But that troublesome child is in the way: Nor is there, I think, a doubt that he Would also her absence much prefer, As oft, while listening intent to me, He's forc'd, from politeness, to look at her. Heigho!—what a blessing should Mr. Magan Turn out, after all, a “renewed” young man; And to me should fall the task, on earth, To assist at the dear youth's second birth. Blest thought! and, ah, more blest the tie, Were it heaven's high will, that he and I— But I blush to write the nuptial word— Should wed, as St. Paul says, “in the Lord;” Not this world's wedlock—gross, gallant, But pure—as when Amram married his aunt. Our ages differ—but who would count One's natural sinful life's amount, Or look in the Register's vulgar page For a regular twice-born Christian's age, Who, blessed privilege! only then Begins to live when he's born again. And, counting in this way—let me see— I myself but five years old shall be, And dear Magan, when the' event takes place, An actual new-born child of grace— Should Heav'n in mercy so dispose— A six-foot baby, in swaddling clothes. Wednesday. Finding myself, by some good fate, With Mr. Magan left tête-à-tête, Had just begun—having stirr'd the fire, And drawn my chair near his—to inquire What his notions were of Original Sin, When that naughty Fanny again bounc'd in; And all the sweet things I had got to say Of the Flesh and the Devil were whisk'd away! Much grieved to observe that Mr. Magan Is actually pleased and amused with Fan! What charms any sensible man can see In a child so foolishly young as she— But just eighteen, come next May-day, With eyes, like herself, full of nought but play— Is, I own, an exceeding puzzle to me. LETTER III. FROM MISS FANNY FUDGE, TO HER COUSIN, MISS KITTY ?. STANZAS (INCLOSED) TO MY SHADOW; OR, WHY?—WHAT?—HOW? Dark comrade of my path! while earth and sky Thus wed their charms, in bridal light array'd, Why in this bright hour, walk'st thou ever nigh, Blackening my footsteps with thy length of shade— Dark comrade, Why? Thou mimic Shape that, mid these flowery scenes, Glidest beside me o'er each sunny spot, Sadd'ning them as thou goest—say, what means So dark an adjunct to so bright a lot— Grim goblin, What? Still, as to pluck sweet flowers I bend my brow, Thou bendest, too—then risest when I rise;— Say, mute mysterious Thing! how is't that thou Thus com'st between me and those blessed skies— Dim shadow, How? (ADDITIONAL STANZA, BY ANOTHER HAND.) Thus said I to that Shape, far less in grudge Than gloom of soul; while, as I eager cried, Oh Why? What? How?—a Voice, that one might judge To be some Irish echo's, faint replied, Oh fudge, fudge, fudge! You have here, dearest Coz, my last lyric effusion; And, with it, that odious “additional stanza,” Which Aunt will insist I must keep, as conclusion, And which, you'll at once see, is Mr. Magan's;—a Most cruel and dark-design'd extravaganza, And part of that plot in which he and my Aunt are To stifle the flights of my genius by banter. Just so 'twas with Byron's young eagle-ey'd strain, Just so did they taunt him;—but vain, critics, vain All your efforts to saddle Wit's fire with a chain! To blot out the splendour of Fancy's young stream, Or crop, in its cradle, her newly-fledg'd beam!!! Thou perceiv'st, dear, that, ev'n while these lines I indite, Thoughts burn, brilliant fancies break out, wrong or right, And I'm all over poet, in Criticism's spite! That my Aunt, who deals only in Psalms, and regards Messrs. Sternhold and Co. as the first of all bards— That she should make light of my works I can't blame; But that nice, handsome, odious Magan—what a shame! Do you know, dear, that, high as on most points I rate him, I'm really afraid—after all, I—must hate him. He is so provoking—nought's safe from his tongue; He spares no one authoress, ancient or young. Were you Sappho herself, and in Keepsake or Bijou Once shone as contributor, Lord how he'd quiz you! He laughs at all Monthlies—I've actually seen A sneer on his brow at the Court Magazine!— While of Weeklies, poor things, there's but one he peruses, And buys every book which that Weekly abuses. But I care not how others such sarcasm may fear, One spirit, at least, will not bend to his sneer; And though tried by the fire, my young genius shall burn as Uninjured as crucified gold in the furnace! (I suspect the word “crucified” must be made “crucible,” Before this fine image of mine is producible.) And now, dear—to tell you a secret which, pray Only trust to such friends as with safety you may— You know, and, indeed the whole county suspects (Though the Editor often my best things rejects), That the verses sign'd of so, , which you now and then see In our County Gazette (vide last) are by me. But 'tis dreadful to think what provoking mistakes The vile country Press in one's prosody makes. For you know, dear—I may, without vanity, hint— Though an angel should write, still 'tis devils must print; And you can't think what havoc these demons sometimes Choose to make of one's sense, and what's worse, of one's rhymes. But a week or two since, in my Ode upon Spring, Which I meant to have made a most beautiful thing, Where I talk'd of the “dewdrops from freshly-blown roses,” The nasty things made it “from freshly-blown noses!” And once when, to please my cross Aunt, I had tried To commem'rate some saint of her clique, who'd just died, Having said he “had tak'n up in heav'n his position,” They made it, he'd “tak'n up to heav'n his physician!” This is very disheartening;—but brighter days shine, I rejoice, love, to say, both for me and the Nine; For, what do you think?—so delightful! next year, Oh, prepare, dearest girl, for the grand news prepare— I'm to write in the Keepsake—yes, Kitty, my dear, To write in the Keepsake, as sure as you're there!! T'other night, at a Ball, 'twas my fortunate chance With a very nice elderly Dandy to dance, Who, 'twas plain, from some hints which I now and then caught, Was the author of something—one couldn't tell what; But his satisfied manner left no room to doubt It was something that Colburn had lately brought out. We convers'd of belles-lettres through all the quadrille,— Of poetry, dancing, of prose, standing still; Talk'd of Intellect's march—whether right 'twas or wrong— And then settled the point in a bold en avant. In the course of this talk 'twas that, having just hinted That I too had Poems which—long'd to be printed, He protested, kind man! he had seen, at first sight, I was actually born in the Keepsake to write. “In the Annals of England let some,” he said, “shine, “But a place in her Annuals, Lady, be thine! “Even now future Keepsakes seem brightly to rise, “Through the vista of years, as I gaze on those eyes,— “All letter'd and press'd, and of large-paper size!” How unlike that Magan, who my genius would smother, And how we, true geniuses, find out each other! This, and much more he said, with that fine frenzied glance One so rarely now sees, as we slid through the dance; Till between us 'twas finally fix'd that, next year, In this exquisite task I my pen should engage; And, at parting, he stoop'd down and lisp'd in my ear These mystical words, which I could but just hear, “Terms for rhyme—if it's prime—ten and sixpence per page.” Think, Kitty, my dear, if I heard his words right, What a mint of half-guineas this small head contains; If for nothing to write is itself a delight, Ye Gods, what a bliss to be paid for one's strains! Having dropp'd the dear fellow a court'sy profound, Off at once, to inquire all about him, I ran; And from what I could learn, do you know, dear, I've found That he's quite a new species of lit'rary man; One, whose task is—to what will not fashion accustom us?— To edite live authors, as if they were posthumous. For instance—the plan, to be sure, is the oddest!— If any young he or she author feels modest In venturing abroad, this kind gentleman-usher Lends promptly a hand to the int'resting blusher; Indites a smooth Preface, brings merit to light, Which else might, by accident, shrink out of sight, And, in short, renders readers and critics polite. My Aunt says—though scarce on such points one can credit her— He was Lady Jane Thingumbob's last novel's editor. 'Tis certain the fashion's but newly invented; And, quick as the change of all things and all names is, Who knows but, as authors, like girls, are presented, We, girls, may be edited soon at St. James's? I must now close my letter—there's Aunt, in full screech, Wants to take me to hear some great Irvingite preach. God forgive me, I'm not much inclined, I must say, To go and sit still to be preach'd at, to-day. And, besides—'twill be all against dancing, no doubt, Which my poor Aunt abhors, with such hatred devout, That, so far from presenting young nymphs with a head, For their skill in the dance, as of Herod is said, She'd wish their own heads in the platter, instead. There, again—coming, Ma'am!—I'll write more, if I can, Before the post goes, Your affectionate Fan. Four o'clock. Such a sermon!—though not about dancing, my dear; 'Twas only on the' end of the world being near. Eighteen Hundred and Forty's the year that some state As the time for that accident—some Forty Eight With regard to the exact time of this event, there appears to be a difference only of about two or three years among the respective calculators. M. Alphonse Nicole, Docteur en Droit, et Avocat, merely doubts whether it is to be in 1846 or 1847. “A cette époque,” he says, “les fidèles peuvent espérer de voir s'effectuer la purification du Sanctuaire.”: And I own, of the two, I'd prefer much the latter, As then I shall be an old maid, and 'two'n't matter. Once more, love, good-bye—I've to make a new cap; But am now so dead tired with this horrid mishap Of the end of the world, that I must take a nap. LETTER IV. FROM PATRICK MAGAN, ESQ. TO THE REV. RICHARD ?. He comes from Erin's speechful shore Like fervid kettle, bubbling o'er With hot effusions—hot and weak; Sound, Humbug, all your hollowest drums, He comes, of Erin's martyrdoms To Britain's well-fed Church to speak. Puff him, ye Journals of the Lord “Our anxious desire is to be found on the side of the Lord.” —Record Newspaper., Twin prosers, Watchman and Record! Journals reserv'd for realms of bliss, Being much too good to sell in this. Prepare, ye wealthier Saints, your dinners, Ye Spinsters, spread your tea and crumpets; And you, ye countless Tracts for Sinners, Blow all your little penny trumpets. He comes, the reverend man, to tell To all who still the Church's part take, Tales of parsonic woe, that well Might make ev'n grim Dissenter's heart ache:— Of ten whole Bishops snatch'd away For ever from the light of day; (With God knows, too, how many more, For whom that doom is yet in store)— Of Rectors cruelly compell'd From Bath and Cheltenham to haste home, Because the tithes, by Pat withheld, Will not to Bath or Cheltenham come; Nor will the flocks consent to pay Their parsons thus to stay away;— Though, with such parsons, one may doubt If 'tisn't money well laid out;— Of all, in short, and each degree Of that once happy Hierarchy, Which us'd to roll in wealth so pleasantly; But now, alas, is doom'd to see Its surplus brought to nonplus presently! Such are the themes this man of pathos, Priest of prose and Lord of bathos, Will preach and preach t'ye, till you're dull again; Then, hail him, Saints, with joint acclaim, Shout to the stars his tuneful name, Which Murtagh was, ere known to fame, But now is Mortimer O'Mulligan! All true, Dick, true as you're alive— I've seen him, some hours since, arrive. Murtagh is come, the great Itinerant— And Tuesday, in the market-place, Intends, to every saint and sinner in't, To state what he calls Ireland's Case; Meaning thereby the case of his shop,— Of curate, vicar, rector, bishop, And all those other grades seraphic, That make men's souls their special traffic, Though caring not a pin which way The' erratic souls go, so they pay.— Just as some roguish country nurse, Who takes a foundling babe to suckle, First pops the payment in her purse, Then leaves poor dear to—suck its knuckle: Ev'n so these reverend rigmaroles Pocket the money—starve the souls. Murtagh, however, in his glory, Will tell, next week, a different story; Will make out all these men of barter, As each a saint, a downright martyr, Brought to the stake—i. e. a beef one, Of all their martyrdoms the chief one; Though try them ev'n at this, they'll bear it, If tender and wash'd down with claret. Meanwhile Miss Fudge, who loves all lions, Your saintly, next to great and high 'uns— (A Viscount, be he what he may, Would cut a Saint out, any day,) Has just announc'd a godly rout, Where Murtagh's to be first brought out, And shown in his tame, week-day state:— “Pray'rs, half-past seven, tea at eight.” Ev'n so the circular missive orders— Pink cards, with cherubs round the borders. Haste, Dick—you're lost, if you lose time;— Spinsters at forty-five grow giddy, And Murtagh, with his tropes sublime, Will surely carry off old Biddy, Unless some spark at once propose, And distance him by downright prose. That sick, rich squire, whose wealth and lands All pass, they say, to Biddy's hands, (The patron, Dick, of three fat rectories!) Is dying of angina pectoris;— So that, unless you're stirring soon, Murtagh, that priest of puff and pelf, May come in for a honey-moon, And be the man of it, himself! As for me, Dick—'tis whim, 'tis folly, But this young niece absorbs me wholly. 'Tis true, the girl's a vile verse-maker— Would rhyme all nature, if you'd let her;— But ev'n her oddities, plague take her, But make me love her all the better. Too true it is, she's bitten sadly With this new rage for rhyming badly, Which late hath seiz'd all ranks and classes, Down to that new Estate, “the masses;” Till one pursuit all tastes combines— One common rail-road o'er Parnassus, Where, sliding in those tuneful grooves, Call'd couplets, all creation moves, And the whole world runs mad in lines. Add to all this—what's ev'n still worse, As rhyme itself, though still a curse, Sounds better to a chinking purse— Scarce sixpence hath my charmer got, While I can muster just a groat; So that, computing self and Venus, Tenpence would clear the' amount between us. However, things may yet prove better:— Meantime, what awful length of letter! And how, while heaping thus with gibes The Pegasus of modern scribes, My own small hobby of farrago Hath beat the pace at which ev'n they go! LETTER V. FROM LARRY O'BRANIGAN, IN ENGLAND, TO HIS WIFE JUDY, AT MULLINAFAD. Dear Judy, I sind you this bit of a letther, By mail-coach conveyance—for want of a betther— To tell you what luck in this world I have had Since I left the sweet cabin, at Mullinafad. Och, Judy, that night!—when the pig which we meant To dry-nurse in the parlour, to pay off the rent, Julianna, the craythur—that name was the death of her The Irish peasantry are very fond of giving fine names to their pigs. I have heard of one instance in which a couple of young pigs were named, at their birth, Abelard and Eloisa.— Gave us the shlip and we saw the last breath of her! And there were the childher, six innocent sowls, For their nate little play-fellow tuning up howls; While yourself, my dear Judy (though grievin's a folly), Stud over Julianna's remains, melancholy— Cryin', half for the craythur, and half for the money, “Arrah, why did ye die till we'd sowl'd you, my honey?” But God's will be done!—and then, faith, sure enough, As the pig was desaiced, 'twas high time to be off. So we gother'd up all the poor duds we could catch, Lock'd the owld cabin-door, put the kay in the thatch, Then tuk laave of each other's sweet lips in the dark, And set off, like the Chrishtians turn'd out of the Ark; The six childher with you, my dear Judy, ochone! And poor I wid myself, left condolin' alone. How I came to this England, o'er say and o'er lands, And what cruel hard walkin' I've had on my hands, Is, at this present writin', too tadious to speak, So I'll mintion it all in a postscript, next week:— Only starv'd I was, surely, as thin as a lath, Till I came to an up-and-down place they call Bath, Where, as luck was, I manag'd to make a meal's meat, By dhraggin owld ladies all day through the street— Which their docthors (who pocket, like fun, the pound starlins,) Have brought into fashion to plase the owld darlins. Div'l a boy in all Bath, though I say it, could carry The grannies up hill half so handy as Larry; And the higher they liv'd, like owld crows, in the air, The more I was wanted to lug them up there. But luck has two handles, dear Judy, they say, And mine has both handles put on the wrong way. For, pondherin', one morn, on a drame I'd just had Of yourself and the babbies, at Mullinafad, Och, there came o'er my sinses so plasin' a flutther, That I spilt an owld Countess right clane in the gutther, Muff, feathers and all!—the descint was most awful, And—what was still worse, faith—I knew 'twas unlawful: For, though, with mere women, no very great evil, T' upset an owld Countess in Bath is the divil! So, liftin' the chair, with herself safe upon it, (For nothin' about her was kilt, but her bonnet,) Without even mentionin' “By your lave, ma'am,” I tuk to my heels and—here, Judy, I am! What's the name of this town I can't say very well, But your heart sure will jump when you hear what befell Your own beautiful Larry, the very first day, (And a Sunday it was, shinin' out mighty gay,) When his brogues to this city of luck found their way. Bein' hungry, God help me, and happenin' to stop, Just to dine on the shmell of a pasthry-cook's shop, I saw, in the window, a large printed paper, And read there a name, och! that made my heart caper— Though printed it was in some quare A B C, That might bother a schoolmasther, let alone me. By gor, you'd have laughed, Judy, could you've but listen'd, As, doubtin', I cried, “why it is!—no, it isn't:” But it was, after all—for, by spellin' quite slow, First I made out “Rev. Mortimer”—then a great “O;” And, at last, by hard readin' and rackin' my skull again, Out it came, nate as imported, “O'Mulligan!” Up I jump'd, like a sky-lark, my jew'l, at that name,— Div'l a doubt on my mind, but it must be the same. “Masther Murthagh, himself,” says I, “all the world over! My own fosther-brother—by jinks, I'm in clover. Though there, in the play-bill, he figures so grand, One wet-nurse it was brought us both up by hand, And he'll not let me shtarve in the inemy's land!” Well, to make a long hishtory short, niver doubt But I manag'd, in no time, to find the lad out; And the joy of the meetin' bethuxt him and me, Such a pair of owld cumrogues—was charmin' to see. Nor is Murthagh less plas'd with the' evint than I am, As he just then was wanting a Valley-de-sham; And, for dressin' a gintleman, one way or t'other, Your nate Irish lad is beyant every other. But now, Judy, comes the quare part of the case; And, in throth, it's the only drawback on my place. 'Twas Murthagh's ill luck to be cross'd, as you know, With an awkward mishfortune some short time ago; That's to say, he turn'd Protestant—why, I can't larn; But, of coorse, he knew best, an' it's not my consarn. All I know is, we both were good Cath'lics, at nurse, And myself am so still—nayther betther nor worse. Well, our bargain was all right and tight in a jiffey, And lads more contint never yet left the Liffey, When Murthagh—or Morthimer, as he's now chrishen'd, His name being convarted, at laist, if he isn't— Lookin' sly at me (faith, 'twas divartin' to see) “Of coorse, you're a Protestant, Larry,” says he. Upon which says myself, wid a wink just as shly, “Is't a Protestant?—oh yes, I am, sir,” says I;— And there the chat ended, and div'l a more word Controvarsial between us has since then occurr'd. What Murthagh could mane, and, in troth, Judy dear, What I myself meant, doesn't seem mighty clear; But the thruth is, though still for the Owld Light a stickler, I was just then too shtarv'd to be over partic'lar:— And, God knows, between us, a comic'ler pair Of twin Protestants couldn't be seen any where. Next Tuesday (as towld in the play-bills I mintion'd, Address'd to the loyal and godly intintion'd,) His riverence, my master, comes forward to preach,— Myself doesn't know whether sarmon or speech, But it's all one to him, he's a dead hand at each; Like us, Paddys, in gin'ral, whose skill in orations Quite bothers the blarney of all other nations. But, whisht!—there's his Rivirence, shoutin' out “Larry,” And sorra a word more will this shmall paper carry; So, here, Judy, ends my short bit of a letther, Which, faix, I'd have made a much bigger and betther, But div'l a one Post-office hole in this town Fit to swallow a dacent siz'd billy-dux down. So good luck to the childer!—tell Molly, I love her; Kiss Oonagh's sweet mouth, and kiss Katty all over— Not forgettin' the mark of the red-currant whiskey She got at the fair when yourself was so frisky. The heav'ns be your bed!—I will write, when I can again, Yours to the world's end, Larry O'Branigan. LETTER VI. FROM MISS BIDDY FUDGE, TO MRS. ELIZABETH ?. How I grieve you're not with us!—pray, come, if you can, Ere we're robb'd of this dear, oratorical man, Who combines in himself all the multiple glory Of Orangeman, Saint, quondam Papist and Tory;— (Choice mixture! like that from which, duly confounded, The best sort of brass was, in old times, compounded)— The sly and the saintly, the worldly and godly, All fused down in brogue so deliciously oddly! In short, he's a dear—and such audiences draws, Such loud peals of laughter and shouts of applause, As can't but do good to the Protestant cause. Poor dear Irish Church!—he to-day sketch'd a view Of her hist'ry and prospects, to me at least new, And which (if it takes as it ought) must arouse The whole Christian world her just rights to espouse. As to reasoning—you know, dear, that's now of no use, People still will their facts and dry figures produce, As if saving the souls of a Protestant flock were A thing to be managed “according to Cocker!” In vain do we say, (when rude radicals hector At paying some thousands a year to a Rector, In places where Protestants never yet were,) “Who knows but young Protestants may be born there? And granting such accident, think, what a shame, If they didn't find Rector and Clerk when they came! It is clear that, without such a staff on full pay, These little Church embryos must go astray; And, while fools are computing what Parsons would cost, Precious souls are meanwhile to the' Establishment lost! In vain do we put the case sensibly thus;— They'll still with their figures and facts make a fuss, And ask “if, while all, choosing each his own road, Journey on, as we can, tow'rds the Heav'nly Abode, It is right that seven eights of the trav'llers should pay For one eighth that goes quite a different way?”— Just as if, foolish people, this wasn't, in reality, A proof of the Church's extreme liberality, That, though hating Pop'ry in other respects, She to Catholic money in no way objects; And so lib'ral her very best Saints, in this sense, That they ev'n go to heav'n at the Cath'lic's expense. But, though clear to our minds all these arguments be, People cannot or will not their cogency see; And, I grieve to confess, did the poor Irish Church Stand on reasoning alone, she'd be left in the lurch. It was therefore, dear Lizzy, with joy most sincere, That I heard this nice Rev'rend O' something we've here, Produce, from the depths of his knowledge and reading, A view of that marvellous Church, far exceeding, In novelty, force, and profoundness of thought, All that Irving himself, in his glory, e'er taught. Looking through the whole history, present and past, Of the Irish Law Church, from the first to the last; Considering how strange its original birth— Such a thing having never before been on earth— How oppos'd to the instinct, the law, and the force Of nature and reason has been its whole course; Through centuries encount'ring repugnance, resistance, Scorn, hate, execration—yet still in existence! Considering all this, the conclusion he draws Is that Nature exempts this one Church from her laws— That Reason, dumb-founder'd, gives up the dispute, And before the portentous anom'ly stands mute;— That, in short, 'tis a Miracle!—and, once begun, And transmitted through ages, from father to son, For the honour of miracles, ought to go on. Never yet was conclusion so cogent and sound, Or so fitted the Church's weak foes to confound. For, observe, the more low all her merits they place, The more they make out the miraculous case, And the more all good Christians must deem it profane To disturb such a prodigy's marvellous reign. As for scriptural proofs, he quite plac'd beyond doubt That the whole in the Apocalypse may be found out, As clear and well-prov'd, he would venture to swear, As any thing else has been ever found there:— While the mode in which, bless the dear fellow, he deals With that whole lot of vials and trumpets and seals, And the ease with which vial on vial he strings, Shows him quite a first-rate at all these sort of things. So much for theology:—as for the' affairs Of this temporal world—the light, drawing-room cares And gay toils of the toilet, which, God knows, I seek, From no love of such things, but in humbleness meek, And to be, as the' Apostle was, “weak with the weak,” Thou wilt find quite enough (till I'm somewhat less busy) In the' extracts inclosed, my dear news-loving Lizzy. EXTRACTS FROM MY DIARY. Thursday. Last night, having nought more holy to do, Wrote a letter to dear Sir Andrew Agnew, About the “Do-nothing-on-Sunday-Club,” Which we wish by some shorter name to dub:— As the use of more vowels and consonants Than a Christian, on Sunday, really wants, Is a grievance that ought to be done away, And the Alphabet left to rest, that day. Sunday. Sir Andrew's answer!—but, shocking to say, Being franked unthinkingly yesterday, To the horror of Agnews yet unborn, It arriv'd on this blessed Sunday morn!!— How shocking!—the postman's self cried “shame on't,” Seeing the' immaculate Andrew's name on't!! What will the Club do?—meet, no doubt. 'Tis a matter that touches the Class Devout, And the friends of the Sabbath must speak out. Tuesday. Saw to-day, at the raffle—and saw it with pain— That those stylish Fitzwigrams begin to dress plain. Even gay little Sophy smart trimmings renounces— She, who long has stood by me through all sorts of flounces, And showed, by upholding the toilet's sweet rites, That we, girls, may be Christians, without being frights. This, I own, much alarms me; for though one's religious, And strict and—all that, there's no need to be hideous; And why a nice bonnet should stand in the way Of one's going to heav'n, 'tisn't easy to say. Then, there's Gimp, the poor thing—if her custom we drop, Pray, what's to become of her soul and her shop? If by saints like ourselves no more orders are given, She'll lose all the interest she now takes in heaven; And this nice little “fire-brand, pluck'd from the burning,” May fall in again at the very next turning. Wednesday. Mem.—To write to the India-Mission Society; And send £20—heavy tax upon piety! Of all Indian lux'ries we now-a-days boast, Making “Company's Christians The title given by the natives to such of their countrymen as become converts.” perhaps costs the most. And the worst of it is, that these converts full grown, Having lived in our faith mostly die in their own Of such relapses we find innumerable instances in the accounts of the Missionaries., Praying hard, at the last, to some god who, they say, When incarnate on earth, used to steal curds and whey. The god Krishna, one of the incarnations of the god Vishnu. “One day (says the Bhagavata) Krishna's play-fellows complained to Tasuda that he had pilfered and ate their curds.” Think, how horrid, my dear!—so that all's thrown away; And (what is still worse) for the rum and the rice They consum'd, while believers, we saints pay the price. Still 'tis cheering to find that we do save a few— The Report gives six Christians for Cunnangcadoo; Doorkotchum reckons seven, and four Trevandrum, While but one and a half's left at Cooroopadum. In this last-mention'd place 'tis the barbers enslave 'em, For, once they turn Christians, no barber will shave 'em. “Roteen wants shaving; but the barber here will not do it. He is run away lest he should be compelled. He says he will not shave Yesoo Kreest's people.” —Bapt. Mission Society, vol. ii. p. 493. To atone for this rather small Heathen amount, Some Papists, turn'd Christians In the Reports of the Missionaries, the Roman Catholics are almost always classed along with the Heathen. “I have extended my labours, (says James Venning, in a Report for 1831,) to the Heathen, Mahomedans, and Roman Catholics.” “The Heathen and Roman Catholics in this neighbourhood (says another missionary for the year 1832) are not indifferent, but withstand, rather than yield to, the force of truth.”, are tack'd to the' account. And though, to catch Papists, one needn't go so far, Such fish are worth hooking, wherever they are; And now, when so great of such converts the lack is, One Papist well caught is worth millions of Blackies. Friday. Last night had a dream so odd and funny, I cannot resist recording it here.— Methought that the Genius of Matrimony Before me stood, with a joyous leer, Leading a husband in each hand, And both for me, which look'd rather queer;— One I could perfectly understand, But why there were two wasn't quite so clear. 'Twas meant, however, I soon could see, To afford me a choice—a most excellent plan; And—who should this brace of candidates be, But Messrs. O'Mulligan and Magan:— A thing, I suppose, unheard of till then, To dream, at once, of two Irishmen!— That handsome Magan, too, with wings on his shoulders (For all this pass'd in the realms of the Blest,) And quite a creature to dazzle beholders; While even O'Mulligan, feather'd and drest As an elderly cherub, was looking his best. Ah Liz, you, who know me, scarce can doubt As to which of the two I singled out. But—awful to tell—when, all in dread Of losing so bright a vision's charms, I grasp'd at Magan, his image fled, Like a mist, away, and I found but the head Of O'Mulligan, wings and all, in my arms! The Angel had flown to some nest divine, And the elderly Cherub alone was mine! Heigho!—it is certain that foolish Magan Either can't or wo'n't see that he might be the man; And, perhaps, dear—who knows?—if nought better befall But—O'Mulligan may be the man, after all. N.B. Next week mean to have my first scriptural rout, For the special discussion of matters devout;— Like those soirées, at Pow'rscourt An account of these Powerscourt Conversaziones (under the direct presidency of Lord Roden), as well as a list of the subjects discussed at the different meetings, may be found in the Christian Herald for the month of December, 1832. The following is a specimen of the nature of the questions submitted to the company:—“Monday Evening, Six o'clock, September 24. 1832.—‘An examination into the quotations given in the New Testament from the Old, with their connection and explanation, viz.’ &amp;c. &amp;c.—Wednesday.—‘Should we expect a personal Antichrist? and to whom will he be revealed?’ &amp;c. &amp;c.—Friday.—‘What light does Scripture throw on present events, and their moral character? What is next to be looked for or expected?’” &amp;c. The rapid progress made at these tea-parties in settling points of Scripture, may be judged from a paragraph in the account given of one of their evenings, by the Christian Herald:— “On Daniel a good deal of light was thrown, and there was some, I think not so much, perhaps, upon the Revelations; though particular parts of it were discussed with considerable accession of knowledge. There was some very interesting inquiry as to the quotation of the Old Testament in the New; particularly on the point, whether there was any ‘accomodation,’ or whether they were quoted according to the mind of the Spirit in the Old; this gave occasion to some very interesting developement of Scripture. The progress of the Antichristian powers was very fully discussed.”, so justly re-renown'd, For the zeal with which doctrine and negus went round; Those theology-routs which the pious Lord R?d?n, That pink of Christianity, first set the mode in; Where, blessed down-pouring! “About eight o'clock the Lord began to pour down his spirit copiously upon us—for they had all by this time assembled in my room for the purpose of prayer. This downpouring continued till about ten o'clock.”—Letter from Mary Campbell to the Rev. John Campbell, of Row, (dated Fernicary, April 4. 1830,) giving an account of her “miraculous cure.” from tea until nine, The subjects lay all in the Prophecy line;— Then, supper—and then, if for topics hard driven, From thence until bed-time to Satan was given; While R?d?n, deep read in each topic and tome, On all subjects (especially the last) was at home. LETTER VII. FROM MISS FANNY FUDGE, TO HER COUSIN, MISS KITTY ?. IRREGULAR ODE. Bring me the slumbering souls of flowers, While yet, beneath some northern sky, Ungilt by beams, ungemm'd by showers, They wait the breath of summer hours, To wake to light each diamond eye, And let loose every florid sigh! Bring me the first-born ocean waves, From out those deep primeval caves, Where from the dawn of Time they've lain— The Embryos of a future Main!— Untaught as yet, young things, to speak The language of their Parent Sea (Polyphlysbæan If you guess what this word means, 'tis more than I can:— I but give't as I got it from Mr. Magan. F.F. nam'd, in Greek), Though soon, too soon, in bay and creek, Round startled isle and wondering peak, They'll thunder loud and long as He! Bring me, from Hecla's iced abode, Young fires— I had got, dear, thus far in my Ode, Intending to fill the whole page to the bottom, But, having invok'd such a lot of fine things, Flowers, billows and thunderbolts, rainbows and wings, Didn't know what to do with 'em, when I had got 'em. The truth is, my thoughts are too full, at this minute, Of past MSS. any new ones to try. This very night's coach brings my destiny in it— Decides the great question, to live or to die! And, whether I'm henceforth immortal or no, All depends on the answer of Simpkins and Co.! You'll think, love, I rave, so 'tis best to let out The whole secret, at once—I have publish'd a Book!!! Yes, an actual Book:—if the marvel you doubt, You have only in last Monday's Courier to look, And you'll find “This day publish'd by Simpkins and Co. A Romaunt, in twelve Cantos, entitled ‘Woe Woe!’ By Miss Fanny F?, known more commonly so .” This I put that my friends mayn't be left in the dark, But may guess at my writing by knowing my mark. How I manag'd, at last, this great deed to achieve, Is itself a “Romaunt” which you'd scarce, dear, believe; Nor can I just now, being all in a whirl, Looking out for the Magnet A day-coach of that name., explain it, dear girl. Suffice it to say, that one half the expense Of this leasehold of fame for long centuries hence— (Though “God knows,” as aunt says, my humble ambition Aspires not beyond a small Second Edition,)— One half the whole cost of the paper and printing, I've manag'd, to scrape up, this year past, by stinting My own little wants in gloves, ribands, and shoes, Thus defrauding the toilet to fit out the Muse! And who, my dear Kitty, would not do the same? What's eau de Cologne to the sweet breath of fame? Yards of riband soon end—but the measures of rhyme, Dipp'd in hues of the rainbow, stretch out through all time. Gloves languish and fade away, pair after pair, While couplets shine out, but the brighter for wear, And the dancing-shoe's gloss in an evening is gone, While light-footed lyrics through ages trip on. The remaining expense, trouble, risk—and, alas! My poor copyright too—into other hands pass; And my friend, the Head Dev'l of the “County Gazette” (The only Mecænas I've ever had yet), He who set up in type my first juvenile lays, Is now set up by them for the rest of his days; And while Gods (as my “Heathen Mythology” says) Live on nought but ambrosia, his lot how much sweeter To live, lucky dev'l, on a young lady's metre! As for puffing—that first of all lit'rary boons, And essential alike both to bards and balloons As, unless well supplied with inflation, 'tis found Neither bards nor balloons budge an inch from the ground;— In this respect, nought could more prosp'rous befall; As my friend (for no less this kind imp can I call) Knows the whole world of critics—the hypers and all. I suspect he himself, indeed, dabbles in rhyme, Which, for imps diabolic, is not the first time; As I've heard uncle Bob say, 'twas known among Gnostics, That the Dev'l on Two Sticks was a dev'l at Acrostics. But hark! there's the Magnet just dash'd in from Town— How my heart, Kitty, beats! I shall surely drop down. That awful Court Journal, Gazette, Athenæum, All full of my book—I shall sink when I see 'em. And then the great point—whether Simpkins and Co. Are actually pleas'd with their bargain or no!— Five o'clock. All's delightful—such praises!—I really fear That this poor little head will turn giddy, my dear, I've but time now to send you two exquisite scraps— All the rest by the Magnet, on Monday, perhaps. FROM THE “MORNING POST.” 'Tis known that a certain distinguish'd physician Prescribes, for dyspepsia, a course of light reading; And Rhymes by young Ladies, the first, fresh edition (Ere critics have injur'd their powers of nutrition), Are he thinks, for weak stomachs, the best sort of feeding. Satires irritate—love-songs are found calorific; But smooth, female sonnets he deems a specific, And, if taken at bed-time, a sure soporific. Among works of this kind, the most pleasing we know, Is a volume just published by Simpkins and Co., Where all such ingredients—the flowery, the sweet, And the gently narcotic—are mix'd per receipt, With a hand so judicious, we've no hesitation To say that—'bove all, for the young generation— 'Tis an elegant, soothing, and safe preparation. Nota bene—for readers, whose object's to sleep, And who read, in their nightcaps, the publishers keep Good fire-proof binding, which comes very cheap. ANECDOTE—FROM THE “COURT JOURNAL.” T'other night, at the Countess of ???'s rout, An amusing event was much whisper'd about. It was said that Lord—, at the Council, that day, Had, more than once, jump'd from his seat, like a rocket, And flown to a corner, where—heedless, they say, How the country's resources were squander'd away— He kept reading some papers he'd brought in his pocket. Some thought them despatches from Spain or the Turk, Others swore they brought word we had lost the Mauritius; But it turn'd out 'twas only Miss Fudge's new work, Which his Lordship devour'd with such zeal expeditious— Messrs. Simpkins and Co., to avoid all delay, Having sent it in sheets, that his Lordship might say, He had distanc'd the whole reading world by a day! LETTER VIII. FROM BOB FUDGE, ESQ., TO THE REV. MORTIMER O'MULLIGAN. Tuesday evening. I much regret, dear Reverend Sir, I could not come to ???meet you; But this curst gout wo'n't let me stir— Ev'n now I but by proxy greet you; As this vile scrawl, whate'er its sense is, Owes all to an amanuensis. Most other scourges of disease Reduce men to extremities— But gout wo'n't leave one even these. From all my sister writes, I see That you and I will quite agree. I'm a plain man, who speak the truth, And trust you'll think me not uncivil, When I declare that, from my youth, I've wish'd your country at the devil: Nor can I doubt, indeed, from all I've heard of your high patriot fame— From every word your lips let fall— That you most truly wish the same. It plagues one's life out—thirty years Have I had dinning in my ears, “Ireland wants this, and that, and t'other,” And, to this hour, one nothing hears But the same vile, eternal bother. While, of those countless things she wanted, Thank God, but little has been granted, And ev'n that little, if we're men And Britons, we'll have back again! I really think that Catholic question Was what brought on my indigestion; And still each year, as Popery's curse Has gather'd round us, I've got worse; Till ev'n my pint of port a day Can't keep the Pope and bile away. And whereas, till the Catholic bill, I never wanted draught or pill, The settling of that cursed question Has quite unsettled my digestion. Look what has happen'd since—the Elect Of all the bores of every sect, The chosen triers of men's patience, From all the Three Denominations, Let loose upon us;—even Quakers Turn'd into speechers and law-makers, Who'll move no question, stiff-rump'd elves, Till first the Spirit moves themselves; And whose shrill Yeas and Nays, in chorus, Conquering our Ays and Nos sonorous, Will soon to death's own slumber snore us. Then, too, those Jews!—I really sicken To think of such abomination; Fellows, who wo'n't eat ham with chicken, To legislate for this great nation!— Depend upon't, when once they've sway, With rich old Goldsmid at the head o' them, Th' Excise laws will be done away, And Circumcise ones pass'd instead o' them! In short, dear sir, look where one will, Things all go on so devilish ill, That, 'pon my soul, I rather fear Our reverend Rector may be right, Who tells me the Millennium's near; Nay, swears he knows the very year, And regulates his leases by't;— Meaning their terms should end, no doubt, Before the world's own lease is out. He thinks, too, that the whole thing's ended So much more soon than was intended, Purely to scourge those men of sin Who brought th' accurst Reform Bill in. This appears to have been the opinion also of an eloquent writer in the Morning Watch. “One great object of Christ's second Advent, as the Man and as the King of the Jews, is to punish the Kings who do not acknowledge that their authority is derived from him, and who submit to receive it from that many-headed monster, the mob.” No. x. p. 373. However, let's not yet despair; Though Toryism's eclips'd, at present, And—like myself, in this old chair— Sits in a state by no means pleasant; Feet crippled—hands, in luckless hour, Disabled of their grasping power; And all that rampant glee, which revell'd In this world's sweets, be-dull'd, bedevil'd— Yet, though condemn'd to frisk no more, And both in Chair of Penance set, There's something tells me, all's not o'er With Toryism or Bobby yet; That though, between us, I allow We've not a leg to stand on now; Though curst Reform and colchicum Have made us both look deuced glum, Yet still, in spite of Grote and Gout, Again we'll shine triumphant out! Yes—back again shall come, egad, Our turn for sport, my reverend lad. And then, O'Mulligan—oh then, When mounted on our nags again, You, on your high-flown Rosinante, Bedizen'd out, like Show-Gallantee (Glitter great from substance scanty);— While I, Bob Fudge, Esquire, shall ride Your faithful Sancho, by your side; Then—talk of tilts and tournaments! Dam'me, we'll— 'Squire Fudge's clerk presents To Reverend Sir his compliments; Is griev'd to say an accident Has just occurr'd which will prevent The Squire—though now a little better— From finishing this present letter. Just when he'd got to “Dam'me, we'll—” His Honour, full of martial zeal, Grasp'd at his crutch, but not being able To keep his balance or his hold, Tumbled, both self and crutch, and roll'd Like ball and bat, beneath the table. All's safe—the table, chair, and crutch;— Nothing, thank God, is broken much, But the Squire's head, which, in the fall, Got bump'd consid'rably—that's all. At this no great alarm we feel, As the Squire's head can bear a deal. Wednesday morning. Squire much the same—head rather light— Rav'd about “Barbers' Wigs” all night. Our housekeeper, old Mrs. Griggs, Suspects that he meant “barbarous Whigs.” LETTER IX. FROM LARRY O'BRANIGAN, TO HIS WIFE JUDY. As it was but last week that I sint you a letther, You'll wondher, dear Judy, what this is about; And, throth, it's a letther myself would like betther, Could I manage to lave the contints of it out; For sure, if it makes even me onaisy, Who takes things quiet, 'twill dhrive you crazy. Oh, Judy, that riverind Murthagh, bad scran to him! That e'er I should come to've been sarvant-man to him, Or so far demane the O'Branigan blood, And my Aunts, the Diluvians (whom not ev'n the Flood Was able to wash away clane from the earth) “I am of your Patriarchs, I, a branch of one of your antediluvian families—fellows that the Flood could not wash away.” —Congreve, Love for Love. As to sarve one whose name, of mere yestherday's birth, Can no more to a great O, before it, purtend, Than mine can to wear a great Q at its end. But that's now all over—last night I gev warnin', And, masth'r as he is, will discharge him this mornin'. The thief of the world!—but it's no use balraggin' To balrag is to abuse—Mr. Lover makes it ballyrag, and he is high authority: but if I remember rightly, Curran in his national stories used to employ the word as above.—See Lover's most amusing and genuinely Irish work, the “Legends and Stories of Ireland.”;— All I know is, I'd fifty times rather be draggin' Ould ladies up hill to the ind of my days, Than with Murthagh to rowl in a chaise, at my aise, And be forc'd to discind thro' the same dirty ways. Arrah, sure, if I'd heerd where he last show'd his phiz, I'd have known what a quare sort of monsther he is; For, by gor, 'twas at Exether Change, sure enough, That himself and his other wild Irish show'd off; And it's pity, so 'tis, that they hadn't got no man Who knew the wild crathurs to act as their showman— Sayin', “Ladies and Gintlemen, plaze to take notice, “How shlim and how shleek this black animal's coat is; “All by-raison, we're towld, that the nathur o' the baste “Is to change its coat once in its lifetime, at laste; “And such objiks, in our counthry, not bein' common ones, “Are bought up, as this was, by way of Fine Nomenons. “In regard of its name—why, in throth, I'm consarn'd “To differ on this point so much with the Larn'd, “Who call it a ‘Morthimer,’ whereas the craythur “Is plainly a ‘Murthagh,’ by name and by nathur.” This is how I'd have towld them the rights of it all, Had I been their showman at Exether Hall— Not forgettin' that other great wondher of Airin (Of th' owld bitther breed which they call Prosbetairin), The fam'd Daddy C?ke? who, by gor, I'd have shown 'em As proof how such bastes may be tam'd, when you've thrown 'em A good frindly sop of the rale Raigin Donem. Larry evidently means the Regium Donum;—a sum contributed by the government annually to the support of the Presbyterian churches in Ireland. But, throth, I've no laisure just now, Judy dear, For any thing, barrin' our own doings here, And the cursin' and dammin' and thund'rin', like mad, We Papists, God help us, from Murthagh have had. He says we're all murtherers—div'l a bit less— And that even our priests, when we go to confess, Give us lessons in murth'ring and wish us success! When ax'd how he daar'd, by tongue or by pen, To belie, in this way, seven millions of men, Faith, he said 'twas all towld him by Docthor Den! Correctly, Dens—Larry not being very particular in his nomenclature. “And who the div'l's he?” was the question that flew From Chrishtian to Chrishtian—but not a sowl knew. While on went Murthagh, in iligant style, Blasphaming us Cath'lics all the while, As a pack of desaivers, parjurers, villians, All the whole kit of th' aforesaid millions “The deeds of darkness which are reduced to horrid practice over the drunken debauch of the midnight assassin are debated, in principle, in the sober morning religious conferences of the priests.” —Speech of the Rev. Mr. M'Ghee.— “The character of the Irish people generally is, that they are given to lying and to acts of theft.” —Speech of the Rev. Robert Daly.,— Yourself, dear Judy, as well as the rest, And the innocent craythur that's at your breast, All rogues together, in word and deed, Owld Den our insthructor and Sin our creed! When ax'd for his proofs again and again, Div'l an answer he'd give but Docthor Den. Couldn't he call into coort some livin' men? “No, thank you”—he'd stick to Docthor Den— An ould gintleman dead a century or two, Who all about us, live Cath'lics, knew; And of coorse was more handy, to call in a hurry, Than Docthor Mac Hale or Docthor Murray! But, throth, it's no case to be jokin' upon, Though myself, from bad habits, is makin' it one. Even you, had you witness'd his grand climactherics, Which actially threw one owld maid in hysterics— Or, och! had you heerd such a purty remark as his, That Papists are only “Humanity's carcasses, “Ris'n”—but, by dad, I'm afeard I can't give it ye— “Ris'n from the sepulchre of—inactivity; “And, like owld corpses, dug up from antikity, “Wandrin' about in all sorts of inikity!!” “But she (Popery) is no longer the tenant of the sepulchre of inactivity. She has come from the burial-place, walking forth a monster, as if the spirit of evil had corrupted the carcass of her departed humanity; noxious and noisome, an object of abhorrence and dismay to all who are not leagued with her in iniquity.” —Report of the Rev. Gentleman's Speech, June 20. in the Record Newspaper. We may well ask, after reading this and other such reverend ravings, “Quis dubitat quin omne sit hoc rationis egestas?”— Even you, Judy, true as you are to the Owld Light, Would have laugh'd, out and out, at this iligant flight Of that figure of speech call'd the Blatherumskite. As for me, though a funny thought now and then came to me, Rage got the betther at last—and small blame to me! So, slapping my thigh, “by the Powers of Delf,” Says I bowldly “I'll make a noration myself.” And with that up I jumps—but, my darlint, the minit I cock'd up my head, div'l a sinse remain'd in it. Though, saited, I could have got beautiful on, When I tuk to my legs, faith, the gab was all gone:— Which was odd, for us, Pats, who, whate'er we've a hand in, At laste in our legs show a sthrong understandin'. Howsumdever, detarmin'd the chaps should pursaive What I thought of their doin's, before I tuk lave, “In regard of all that,” says I—there I stopp'd short— Not a word more would come, though I shtruggled hard for't. So, shnapping my fingers at what's call'd the Chair, And the owld Lord (or Lady, I b'lieve) that sat there— “In regard of all that,” says I bowldly again— “To owld Nick I pitch Mortimer—and Docthor Den;”— Upon which the whole company cried out “Amen;” And myself was in hopes 'twas to what I had said, But, by gor, no such thing—they were not so well bred: For, 'twas all to a pray'r Murthagh just had read out, By way of fit finish to job so devout; That is—afther well damning one half the community, To pray God to keep all in pace an' in unity! This is all I can shtuff in this letther, though plinty Of news, faith, I've got to fill more—if 'twas twinty. But I'll add, on the outside, a line, should I need it, (Writin' “Private” upon it, that no one may read it,) To tell you how Mortimer (as the Saints chrishten him) Bears the big shame of his sarvant's dismisshin' him. (Private outside.) Just come from his riv'rence—the job is all done— By the powers, I've discharg'd him as sure as a gun! And now, Judy dear, what on earth I'm to do With myself and my appetite—both good as new— Without ev'n a single traneen in my pocket, Let alone a good, dacent pound-starlin', to stock it— Is a mysht'ry I lave to the One that's above, Who takes care of us, dissolute sowls, when hard dhrove! LETTER X. FROM THE REV. MORTIMER O'MULLIGAN, TO THE REV. ?. These few brief lines, my reverend friend, By a safe, private hand I send (Fearing lest some low Catholic wag Should pry into the Letter-bag), To tell you, far as pen can dare How we, poor errant martyrs, fare;— Martyrs, not quite to fire and rack, As Saints were, some few ages back, But—scarce less trying in its way— To laughter, wheresoe'er we stray; To jokes, which Providence mysterious Permits on men and things so serious, Lowering the Church still more each minute, And—injuring our preferment in it. Just think, how worrying 'tis, my friend, To find, where'er our footsteps bend, Small jokes, like squibs, around us whizzing; And bear the eternal torturing play Of that great engine of our day, Unknown to the' Inquisition—quizzing! Your men of thumb-screws and of racks Aim'd at the body their attacks; But modern torturers, more refin'd, Work their machinery on the mind. Had St. Sebastian had the luck With me to be a godly rover, Instead of arrows, he'd be stuck With stings of ridicule all over; And poor St. Lawrence, who was kill'd By being on a gridir'n grill'd, Had he but shar'd my errant lot, Instead of grill on gridir'n hot, A moral roasting would have got. Nor should I (trying as all this is) Much heed the suffering or the shame— As, like an actor, used to hisses, I long have known no other fame, But that (as I may own to you, Though to the world it would not do,) No hope appears of fortune's beams Shining on any of my schemes; No chance of something more per ann. As supplement to K?llym?n; No prospect that, by fierce abuse Of Ireland, I shall e'er induce The rulers of this thinking nation To rid us of Emancipation; To forge anew the sever'd chain, And bring back Penal Laws again. Ah happy time! when wolves and priests Alike were hunted, as wild beasts; And five pounds was the price, per head, For bagging either, live or dead “Among other amiable enactments against the Catholics at this period (1649), the price of five pounds was set on the head of a Romish priest—being exactly the same sum offered by the same legislators for the head of a wolf.” Memoirs of Captain Rock, book i. chap. 10.;— Though oft, we're told, one outlaw'd brother Sav'd cost, by eating up the other. Finding thus all those schemes and hopes I built upon my flowers and tropes All scatter'd, one by one, away, As flashy and unsound as they, The question comes—what's to be done? And there's but one course left me—one. Heroes, when tir'd of war's alarms, Seek sweet repose in Beauty's arms. The weary Day-God's last retreat is The breast of silv'ry-footed Thetis; And mine, as mighty Love's my judge, Shall be the arms of rich Miss Fudge! Start not, my friend,—the tender scheme, Wild and romantic though it seem, Beyond a parson's fondest dream, Yet shines, too, with those golden dyes, So pleasing to a parson's eyes— That only gilding which the Muse Cannot around her sons diffuse;— Which, whencesoever flows its bliss, From wealthy Miss or benefice, To Mortimer indiff'rent is, So he can only make it his. There is but one slight damp I see Upon this scheme's felicity, And that is, the fair heroine's claim That I shall take her family name. To this (though it may look henpeck'd), I can't quite decently object, Having myself long chos'n to shine Conspicuous in the alias In the first edition of his Dictionary, Dr. Johnson very significantly exemplified the meaning of the word “alias” by the instance of Mallet, the poet, who had exchanged for this more refined name his original Scotch patronymic, Malloch. “What other proofs he gave (says Johnson) of disrespect to his native country, I know not; but it was remarked of him that he was the only Scot whom Scotchmen did not commend.” —Life of Mallet. line; So that henceforth, by wife's decree, (For Biddy from this point wo'n't budge) Your old friend's new address must be The Rev. Mortimer O'Fudge— The “O” being kept, that all may see We're both of ancient family. Such, friend, nor need the fact amaze you, My public life's calm Euthanasia. Thus bid I long farewell to all The freaks of Exeter's old Hall— Freaks, in grimace, its apes exceeding, And rivalling its bears in breeding. Farewell, the platform fill'd with preachers— The pray'r giv'n out, as grace “I think I am acting in unison with the feelings of a Meeting assembled for this solemn object, when I call on the Rev. Doctor Holloway to open it by prayer.” —Speech of Lord Kenyon., by speechers, Ere they cut up their fellow-creatures:— Farewell to dead old Dens's volumes, And, scarce less dead, old Standard's columns:— From each and all I now retire, My task, henceforth, as spouse and sire, To bring up little filial Fudges, To be M.P.s, and Peers, and Judges— Parsons I'd add too, if, alas! There yet were hope the Church could pass The gulf now oped for hers and her, Or long survive what Exeter— Both Hall and Bishop, of that name— Have done to sink her reverend fame. Adieu, dear friend—you'll oft hear from me, Now I'm no more a travelling drudge; Meanwhile I sign (that you may judge How well the surname will become me) Yours truly, Mortimer O'Fudge. LETTER XI. FROM PATRICK MAGAN, ESQ., TO THE REV. RICHARD ?. ?, Ireland. Dear Dick—just arriv'd at my own humble gîte, I inclose you, post-haste, the account, all complete, Just arriv'd, per express, of our late noble feat. [Extract from the “County Gazette.”] This place is getting gay and full again. Last week was married, “in the Lord,” The Reverend Mortimer O'Mulligan, Preacher, in Irish, of the Word, (He, who the Lord's force lately led on— Exeter Hall his Armagh-geddon,) The rectory which the Rev. gentleman holds is situated in the county of Armagh!—a most remarkable coincidence— and well worthy of the attention of certain expounders of the Apocalypse. To Miss B. Fudge of Pisgah Place, One of the chos'n, as “heir of grace,” And likewise heiress of Phil. Fudge, Esquire, defunct, of Orange Lodge. Same evening, Miss F. Fudge, 'tis hinted— Niece of the above, (whose “Sylvan Lyre,” In our Gazette, last week, we printed,) Elop'd with Pat. Magan, Esquire. The fugitives were track'd, some time, After they'd left the Aunt's abode, By scraps of paper, scrawl'd with rhyme, Found strew'd along the Western road;— Some of them, ci-devant curl-papers, Others, half burnt in lighting tapers. This clue, however, to their flight, After some miles was seen no more; And, from inquiries made last night, We find they've reach'd the Irish shore. Every word of it true, Dick—th' escape from Aunt's thrall— Western road—lyric fragments—curl-papers and all. My sole stipulation, ere link'd at the shrine (As some balance between Fanny's numbers and mine), Was that, when we were one, she must give up the Nine; Nay, devote to the Gods her whole stock of MS. With a vow never more against prose to transgress. This she did, like a heroine;—smack went to bits The whole produce sublime of her dear little wits— Sonnets, elegies, epigrams, odes, canzonets— Some twisted up neatly, to form allumettes, Some turn'd into papillotes, worthy to rise And enwreathe Berenice's bright locks in the skies! While the rest, honest Larry (who's now in my pay), Begg'd, as “lover of po'thry,” to read on the way. Having thus of life's poetry dar'd to dispose, How we now, Dick, shall manage to get through its prose, With such slender materials for style, Heaven knows! But—I'm call'd off abruptly—another Express! What the deuce can it mean?—I'm alarm'd, I confess. P.S. Hurrah, Dick, hurrah, Dick, ten thousand hurrahs! I'm a happy, rich dog to the end of my days. There—read the good news—and while glad, for my sake, That Wealth should thus follow in Love's shining wake, Admire also the moral—that he, the sly elf, Who has fudg'd all the world, should be now fudg'd himself! EXTRACT FROM LETTER INCLOSED. With pain the mournful news I write, Miss Fudge's uncle died last night; And much to mine and friends' surprise, By will doth all his wealth devise— Lands, dwellings—rectories likewise— To his “belov'd grand-niece,” Miss Fanny, Leaving Miss Fudge herself, who many Long years hath waited—not a penny! Have notified the same to latter, And wait instructions in the matter. For self and partners, &amp;c. &amp;c. SONGS FROM M.P.; OR, THE BLUE STOCKING. SONG. [Young Love liv'd once in an humble shed] SUSAN. Young Love liv'd once in an humble shed, Where roses breathing, And woodbines wreathing Around the lattice their tendrils spread, As wild and sweet as the life he led. His garden flourish'd, For young Hope nourish'd The infant buds with beams and showers; But lips, though blooming, must still be fed, And not even Love can live on flowers. Alas! that Poverty's evil eye Should e'er come hither, Such sweets to wither! The flowers laid down their heads to die, And Hope fell sick as the witch drew nigh. She came one morning, Ere Love had warning, And rais'd the latch, where the young god lay; “Oh ho!” said Love—“is it you? good-by;” So he oped the window, and flew away! [To sigh, yet feel no pain] To sigh, yet feel no pain, To weep, yet scarce know why; To sport an hour with Beauty's chain, Then throw it idly by. To kneel at many a shrine, Yet lay the heart on none; To think all other charms divine, But those we just have won. This is love, faithless love, Such as kindleth hearts that rove. To keep one sacred flame, Through life unchill'd, unmov'd, To love, in wintry age, the same As first in youth we lov'd; To feel that we adore, Ev'n to such fond excess, That, though the heart would break, with more, It could not live with less. This is love, faithful love, Such as saints might feel above. [Spirit of Joy, thy altar lies] Spirit of Joy, thy altar lies In youthful hearts that hope like mine; And 'tis the light of laughing eyes, That leads us to thy fairy shrine. There if we find the sigh, the tear, They are not those to Sorrow known; But breath so soft, and drops so clear, That Bliss may claim them for her own. Then give me, give me, while I weep, The sanguine hope that brightens woe, And teaches ev'n our tears to keep The tinge of pleasure as they flow. The child, who sees the dew of night Upon the spangled hedge at morn, Attempts to catch the drops of light, But wounds his finger with the thorn. Thus oft the brightest joys we seek, Are lost, when touch'd, and turn to pain; The flush they kindled leaves the cheek, The tears they waken long remain. But give me, give me, &amp;c. &amp;c [When Leila touch'd the lute] When Leila touch'd the lute, Not then alone 'twas felt, But, when the sounds were mute, In memory still they dwelt. Sweet lute! in nightly slumbers Still we heard thy morning numbers. Ah, how could she, who stole Such breath from simple wire, Be led, in pride of soul, To string with gold her lyre? Sweet lute! thy chords she breaketh; Golden now the strings she waketh! But where are all the tales Her lute so sweetly told? In lofty themes she fails, And soft ones suit not gold. Rich lute! we see thee glisten, But, alas! no more we listen! BOAT GLEE. The song that lightens our languid way When brows are glowing, And faint with rowing, Is like the spell of Hope's airy lay, To whose sound through life we stray. The beams that flash on the oar awhile, As we row along through waves so clear, Illume its spray, like the fleeting smile That shines o'er Sorrow's tear. Nothing is lost on him who sees With an eye that Feeling gave;— For him there's a story in every breeze, And a picture in every wave. Then sing to lighten the languid way;— When brows are glowing, And faint with rowing: 'Tis like the spell of Hope's airy lay, To whose sound through life we stray. Oh think, when a hero is sighing, What danger in such an adorer! What woman could dream of denying The hand that lays laurels before her. No heart is so guarded around, But the smile of a victor would take it; No bosom can slumber so sound, But the trumpet of Glory will wake it. Love sometimes is given to sleeping, And woe to the heart that allows him; For soon neither smiling or weeping Will e'er from such slumber arouse him. But though he were sleeping so fast, That the life almost seem'd to forsake him, Ev'n then, one soul-thrilling blast From the trumpet of Glory would wake him. CUPID'S LOTTERY. A lottery, a Lottery, In Cupid's Court there used to be; Two roguish eyes The highest prize, In Cupid's scheming Lottery; And kisses, too, As good as new, Which weren't very hard to win, For he, who won The eyes of fun, Was sure to have the kisses in. A Lottery, a Lottery, &amp;c. This Lottery, this Lottery, In Cupid's Court went merrily, And Cupid play'd A Jewish trade In this his scheming Lottery; For hearts, we're told, In shares he sold To many a fond believing drone, And cut the hearts So well in parts, That each believ'd the whole his own. Chor.— A Lottery, a Lottery, In Cupid's Court there used to be; Two roguish eyes The highest prize In Cupid's scheming Lottery. SONG. Sung in the character of a Frenchman. [Though sacred the tie that our country entwineth] Though sacred the tie that our country entwineth, And dear to the heart her remembrance remains, Yet dark are the ties where no liberty shineth, And sad the remembrance that slavery stains. Oh Liberty, born in the cot of the peasant, But dying of languor in luxury's dome, Our vision, when absent—our glory when present— Where thou art, O Liberty! there is my home. Farewell to the land where in childhood I wander'd! In vain is she mighty, in vain is she brave; Unbless'd is the blood that for tyrants is squander'd, And Fame has no wreaths for the brow of the slave. But hail to thee, Albion! who meet'st the commotion Of Europe, as calm as thy cliffs meet the foam; With no bonds but the law, and no slave but the ocean, Hail, Temple of Liberty! thou art my home. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. AT NIGHT. These lines allude to a curious lamp, which has for its device a Cupid, with the words “at night” written over him. At night, when all is still around, How sweet to hear the distant sound Of footstep, coming soft and light! What pleasure in the anxious beat, With which the bosom flies to meet That foot that comes so soft at night! And then, at night, how sweet to say “'Tis late, my love!” and chide delay, Though still the western clouds are bright; Oh! happy, too, the silent press, The eloquence of mute caress, With those we love exchang'd at night! TO LADY HOLLAND. ON NAPOLEON'S LEGACY OF A SNUFF-BOX. Gift of the Hero, on his dying day, To her, whose pity watch'd, for ever nigh; Oh! could he see the proud, the happy ray, This relic lights up on her generous eye, Sighing, he'd feel how easy 'tis to pay A friendship all his kingdoms could not buy. Paris, July, 1821. EPILOGUE. WRITTEN FOR LADY DACRE'S TRAGEDY OF INA. Last night, as lonely o'er my fire I sat, Thinking of cues, starts, exits, and—all that, And wondering much what little knavish sprite Had put it first in women's heads to write:— Sudden I saw—as in some witching dream— A bright-blue glory round my book-case beam, From whose quick-opening folds of azure light Out flew a tiny form, as small and bright As Puck the Fairy, when he pops his head, Some sunny morning from a violet bed. “Bless me!” I starting cried, “what imp are you?”— “A small he-devil, Ma'am—my name Bas Bleu— “A bookish sprite, much given to routs and reading; “'Tis I who teach your spinsters of good breeding, “The reigning taste in chemistry and caps, “The last new bounds of tuckers and of maps, “And, when the waltz has twirl'd her giddy brain, “With metaphysics twirl it back again!” I view'd him, as he spoke—his hose were blue, His wings—the covers of the last Review— Cerulean, border'd with a jaundice hue, And tinsell'd gaily o'er, for evening wear, Till the next quarter brings a new-fledg'd pair. “Inspir'd by me—(pursued this waggish Fairy)— “That best of wives and Sapphos, Lady Mary, “Votary alike of Crispin and the Muse, “Makes her own splay-foot epigrams and shoes. “For me the eyes of young Camilla shine, “And mingle Love's blue brilliances with mine; “For me she sits apart, from coxcombs shrinking, “Looks wise—the pretty soul!—and thinks she's thinking. “By my advice Miss Indigo attends “Lectures on Memory, and assures her friends, “‘'Pon honour!— (mimics)—nothing can surpass the plan “‘Of that professor— (trying to recollect)—psha! that memory-man— “‘That—what's his name?—him I attended lately— “‘'Pon honour, he improv'd my memory greatly.’” Here, curtseying low, I ask'd the blue-legg'd sprite, What share he had in this our play to-night. “Nay, there—(he cried)—there I am guiltless quite— “What! choose a heroine from that Gothic time, “When no one waltz'd, and none but monks could rhyme; “When lovely woman, all unschool'd and wild, “Blush'd without art, and without culture smil'd— “Simple as flowers, while yet unclass'd they shone, “Ere Science call'd their brilliant world her own, “Rang'd the wild, rosy things in learned orders, “And fill'd with Greek the garden's blushing borders!— “No, no—your gentle Inas will not do— “To-morrow evening, when the lights burn blue, “I'll come— (pointing downwards)—you understand—till then adieu!” And has the sprite been here? No—jests apart— Howe'er man rules in science and in art, The sphere of woman's glories is the heart. And, if our Muse have sketch'd with pencil true The wife—the mother—firm, yet gentle too— Whose soul, wrapp'd up in ties itself hath spun, Trembles, if touch'd in the remotest one; Who loves—yet dares even Love himself disown, When Honour's broken shaft supports his throne: If such our Ina, she may scorn the evils, Dire as they are, of Critics and—Blue Devils. THE DAY-DREAM. In these stanzas I have done little more than relate a fact in verse; and the lady, whose singing gave rise to this curious instance of the power of memory in sleep, is Mrs. Robert Arkwright. They both were hush'd, the voice, the chords,— I heard but once that witching lay; And few the notes, and few the words, My spell-bound memory brought away; Traces, remember'd here and there, Like echoes of some broken strain;— Links of a sweetness lost in air, That nothing now could join again. Ev'n these, too, ere the morning, fled; And, though the charm still linger'd on, That o'er each sense her song had shed, The song itself was faded, gone;— Gone, like the thoughts that once were ours, On summer days, ere youth had set; Thoughts bright, we know, as summer flowers, Though what they were, we now forget. In vain, with hints from other strains, I woo'd this truant air to come— As birds are taught, on eastern plains, To lure their wilder kindred home. In vain:—the song that Sappho gave, In dying, to the mournful sea, Not muter slept beneath the wave, Than this within my memory. At length, one morning, as I lay In that half-waking mood, when dreams Unwillingly at last give way To the full truth of daylight's beams, A face—the very face, methought, From which had breath'd, as from a shrine Of song and soul, the notes I sought— Came with its music close to mine; And sung the long-lost measure o'er,— Each note and word, with every tone And look, that lent it life before,— All perfect, all again my own! Like parted souls, when, mid the Blest They meet again, each widow'd sound Through memory's realm had wing'd in quest Of its sweet mate, till all were found. Nor ev'n in waking did the clue, Thus strangely caught, escape again; For never lark its matins knew So well as now I knew this strain. And oft, when memory's wondrous spell Is talk'd of in our tranquil bower, I sing this lady's song, and tell The vision of that morning hour. SONG. [Where is the heart that would not give] Where is the heart that would not give Years of drowsy days and nights, One little hour, like this, to live— Full, to the brim, of life's delights? Look, look around, This fairy ground, With love-lights glittering o'er; While cups that shine With freight divine Go coasting round its shore. Hope is the dupe of future hours, Memory lives in those gone by; Neither can see the moment's flowers Springing up fresh beneath the eye. Wouldst thou, or thou, Forego what's now, For all that Hope may say? No—Joy's reply, From every eye, Is, “Live we while we may.” SONG OF THE POCO-CURANTE SOCIETY. Haud curat Hippoclides. Erasm. Adag. To those we love we've drank to-night; But now attend, and stare not, While I the ampler list recite Of those for whom We care not. For royal men, howe'er they frown, If on their fronts they bear not That noblest gem that decks a crown, The People's Love—We care not. For slavish men, who bend beneath A despot yoke, yet dare not Pronounce the will, whose very breath Would rend its links—We care not. For priestly men, who covet sway And wealth, though they declare not; Who point, like finger-posts, the way They never go—We care not. For martial men, who on their sword, Howe'er it conquers, wear not The pledges of a soldier's word, Redeem'd and pure—We care not. For legal men, who plead for wrong, And, though to lies they swear not, Are hardly better than the throng Of those who do—We care not. For courtly men, who feed upon The land, like grubs, and spare not The smallest leaf, where they can sun Their crawling limbs—We care not. For wealthy men, who keep their mines In darkness hid, and share not The paltry ore with him who pines In honest want—We care not. For prudent men, who hold the power Of Love aloof, and bare not Their hearts in any guardless hour To Beauty's shaft—We care not. For all, in short, on land or sea, In camp or court, who are not, Who never were, or e'er will be Good men and true—We care not. ANNE BOLEYN. TRANSLATION FROM THE METRICAL “HISTOIRE D'ANNE BOLEYN.” “S'elle estoit belle et de taille élégante, Estoit des yeulx encor plus attirante, Lesquelz sçavoit bien conduyre à propos En les tenant quelquefoys en repos; Aucunefoys envoyant en message Porter du cueur le secret tesmoignage.” Much as her form seduc'd the sight, Her eyes could ev'n more surely woo; And when, and how to shoot their light Into men's hearts full well she knew. For sometimes, in repose, she hid Their rays beneath a downcast lid; And then again, with wakening air, Would send their sunny glances out, Like heralds of delight, to bear Her heart's sweet messages about. THE DREAM OF THE TWO SISTERS. FROM DANTE. Nell ora, credo, che dell' oriente Prima raggiò nel monte Citerea, Che di fuoco d'amor par sempre ardente, Giovane e bella in sogno mi parea Donna vedere andar per una landa Cogliendo fiori; e cantando dicea:— Sappia qualunque 'l mio nome dimanda, Ch' io mi son Lia, e vo movendo 'ntorno Le belle mani a farmi una ghirlanda— Per piacermi allo specchio qui m' adorno; Ma mia suora Rachel mai non si smaga Dal suo ammiraglio, e siede tutto il giorno. Ell' è de' suoi begli occhi veder vaga, Com' io dell' adornarmi con le mani; Lei lo vedere e me l'ovrare appaga. Dante, Purg. canto xxvii. 'Twas eve's soft hour, and bright, above, The star of Beauty beam'd, While lull'd by light so full of love, In slumber thus I dream'd— Methought, at that sweet hour, A nymph came o'er the lea, Who, gath'ring many a flow'r, Thus said and sung to me:— “Should any ask what Leila loves, “Say thou, To wreathe her hair “With flow'rets cull'd from glens and groves, “Is Leila's only care. “While thus in quest of flow'rets rare, “O'er hill and dale I roam, “My sister, Rachel, far more fair, “Sits lone and mute at home. “Before her glass untiring, “With thoughts that never stray, “Her own bright eyes admiring, “She sits the live-long day; “While I!—oh, seldom ev'n a look “Of self salutes my eye;— “My only glass, the limpid brook, “That shines and passes by.” SOVEREIGN WOMAN. A BALLAD. The dance was o'er, yet still in dreams, That fairy scene went on; Like clouds still flush'd with daylight gleams Though day itself is gone. And gracefully to music's sound, The same bright nymphs went gliding round; While thou, the Queen of all, wert there— The Fairest still, where all were fair. The dream then chang'd—in halls of state, I saw thee high enthron'd; While, rang'd around, the wise, the great In thee their mistress own'd: And still the same, thy gentle sway O'er willing subjects won its way— 'Till all confess'd the Right Divine To rule o'er man was only thine! But, lo, the scene now chang'd again— And borne on plumed steed, I saw thee o'er the battle-plain Our land's defenders lead: And stronger in thy beauty's charms, Than man, with countless hosts in arms, Thy voice, like music, cheer'd the Free, Thy very smile was victory! Nor reign such queens on thrones alone— In cot and court the same, Wherever woman's smile is known, Victoria's still her name. For though she almost blush to reign, Though Love's own flow'rets wreath the chain, Disguise our bondage as we will, 'Tis woman, woman, rules us still. COME, PLAY ME THAT SIMPLE AIR AGAIN. A BALLAD. Come, play me that simple air again, I us'd so to love, in life's young day, And bring, if thou canst, the dreams that then Were waken'd by that sweet lay. The tender gloom its strain Shed o'er the heart and brow, Grief's shadow, without its pain— Say where, where is it now? But play me the well-known air once more, For thoughts of youth still haunt its strain, Like dreams of some far, fairy shore We never shall see again. Sweet air, how every note brings back Some sunny hope, some day-dream bright, That, shining o'er life's early track, Fill'd ev'n its tears with light. The new-found life that came With love's first echo'd vow;— The fear, the bliss, the shame— Ah—where, where are they now? But, still the same lov'd notes prolong, For sweet 'twere thus, to that old lay, In dreams of youth and love and song, To breathe life's hour away. END OF THE NINTH VOLUME.</field>

TO LORD JOHN RUSSELL, THIS VOLUME IS INSCRIBED BY ONE WHO ADMIRES HIS CHARACTER AND TALENTS, AND IS PROUD OF HIS FRIENDSHIP. THE EPICUREAN. A TALE. [“As o'er the lake, in evening's glow] “As o'er the lake, in evening's glow, That temple threw its lengthening shade, Upon the marble steps below There sate a fair Corinthian maid, Gracefully o'er some volume bending; While, by her side, the youthful Sage Held back her ringlets, lest, descending, They should o'er-shadow all the page.” [Oh, were it not for this sad voice] Oh, were it not for this sad voice, Stealing amid our mirth to say, That all, in which we most rejoice, Ere night may be the earth-worm's prey;— But for this bitter—only this— Full as the world is brimm'd with bliss, And capable as feels my soul Of draining to its depth the whole, I should turn earth to heaven, and be, If bliss made gods, a deity! [Oracles, truer far than oak] Oracles, truer far than oak Or dove, or tripod, ever spoke. [Th' imbrowning of the fruit, that tells] Th' imbrowning of the fruit, that tells, How rich within the soul of sweetness dwells. [While, far as sight could reach, beneath as clear] While, far as sight could reach, beneath as clear And blue a heaven as ever bless'd this sphere, Gardens, and pillar'd streets, and porphyry domes, And high-built temples, fit to be the homes Of mighty gods—and pyramids, whose hour Outlasts all time, above the waters tower! Then, too, the scenes of pomp and joy, that make One theatre of this vast peopled lake, Where all that Love, Religion, Commerce gives Of life and motion, ever moves and lives. Here, up the steps of temples, from the wave Ascending, in procession slow and grave, Priests, in white garments, go, with sacred wands And silver cymbals gleaming in their hands: While, there, rich barks—fresh from those sunny tracts Far off, beyond the sounding cataracts— Glide with their precious lading to the sea, Plumes of bright birds, rhinoceros' ivory, Gems from the Isle of Meröe, and those grains Of gold, wash'd down by Abyssinian rains. Here, where the waters wind into a bay Shadowy and cool, some pilgrims on their way To Saïs or Bubastus, among beds Of lotus-flowers Vide Strabo., that close above their heads, Push their light barks, and hid, as in a bower, Sing, talk, or sleep away the sultry hour; While haply, not far off, beneath a bank Of blossoming acacias, many a prank Is play'd in the cool current by a train Of laughing nymphs, lovely as she, whose chain Around two conquerors of the world was cast But, for a third too feeble, broke at last! [whose beams] On a little island, half-way over between the gardens of Memphis and the eastern shore, stood the temple of that goddess, whose beams Bring the sweet time of night-flowers and dreams. Not the cold Dian of the North, who chains In vestal ice the current of young veins; But she, who haunts the gay, Bubastian For Bubastis, the Diana of the Egyptians. —Vide Jablonski, lib. iii. cap. 4. grove, And owns she sees, from her bright heav'n above, Nothing on earth, to match that heav'n, but love! [“Fair Rhodope] “Fair Rhodope From the story of Rhodope, Zoega thinks, “videntur Arabes ansam arripuisse ut in una ex pyramidibus, genii loco, habitare dicerent mulierem nudam insignis pulchritudinis quæ aspecto suo homines insanire faciat.” De Usu Obeliscorum. See also L' Egypte de Murtadi par Vattier., as story tells, The bright unearthly nymph, who dwells 'Mid sunless gold and jewels hid, The Lady of the Pyramid!” [“Light as a lime-bush, that receives] “Light as a lime-bush, that receives Some wandering bird among its leaves.” [You, who would try] You, who would try Yon terrible track, To live, or to die, But ne'er to look back.— You, who aspire To be purified there, By the terrors of Fire, Of Water, and Air— If danger, and pain, And death you despise, On—for again Into light you shall rise; Rise into light With that Secret Divine, Now shrouded from sight By the Veils of the Shrine But if ? Here the letters faded away into a dead blank, more awfully intelligible than the most eloquent words. [“Drink of this cup—Osiris] “Drink of this cup—Osiris Osiris, under the name of Serapis, was supposed to rule over the subterranean world; and performed the office of Pluto, in the mythology of the Egyptians. “They believed,” says Dr. Pritchard, “that Serapis presided over the region of departed souls, during the period of their absence, when languishing without bodies, and that the dead were deposited in his palace.” Analysis of the Egyptian Mythology. sips The same in his halls below; And the same he gives, to cool the lips Of the Dead “Frigidam illam aquam post mortem, tanquam Hebes poculum, expetitam.” Zoega.—The Lethe of the Egyptians was called Ameles. See Dupuis, tom. viii. p. 651. who downward go. “Drink of this cup—the water within Is fresh from Lethe's stream; 'Twill make the past, with all its sin, And all its pain and sorrows, seem Like a long-forgotten dream! “The pleasure, whose charms Are steep'd in woe; The knowledge, that harms The soul to know; “The hope, that, bright As the lake of the waste, Allures the sight, But mocks the taste; “The love that binds Its innocent wreath, Where the serpent winds, In venom, beneath;— “All that, of evil or false, by thee Hath ever been known or seen, Shall melt away in this cup, and be Forgot, as it never had been!” [“Drink of this cup—when Isis led] “Drink of this cup—when Isis led Her boy, of old to the beaming sky, She mingled a draught divine The ??? ????????? ????????, which, according to Diodorus Siculus, Isis prepared for her son Orus. —Lib. i., and said— ‘Drink of this cup, thou'lt never die!’ “Thus do I say and sing to thee, Heir of that boundless heav'n on high, Though frail, and fall'n, and lost thou be, Drink of this cup, thou'lt never die!” “And Memory, too, with her dreams shall come, Dreams of a former, happier day, When Heaven was still the Spirit's home, And her wings had not yet fallen away; “Glimpses of glory, ne'er forgot, That tell, like gleams on a sunset sea, What once hath been, what now is not, But, oh, what again shall brightly be.” [“Oh! Abyssinian tree] “Oh! Abyssinian tree, We pray, we pray to thee; By the glow of thy golden fruit, And the violet hue of thy flower, And the greeting mute Of thy bough's salute To the stranger who seeks thy bower. See an account of this sensitive tree, which bends down its branches to those who approach it, in M. Jomard's Description of Syene and the Cataracts. “Oh! Abyssinian tree, How the traveller blesses thee, When the night no moon allows, And the sunset hour is near, And thou bend'st thy boughs To kiss his brows, Saying, ‘Come rest thee here.’ Oh! Abyssinian tree, Thus bow thy head to me!” [? on one of those sweet nights] The looks and attitudes of the young people denoted that they were lovers; and, sometimes, they were seen sitting under a canopy of flowers, with their eyes fixed on each other's faces, as though they could never look away; sometimes, they appeared walking along the banks of the Nile,— ? on one of those sweet nights When Isis, the pure star of lovers Vide Plutarch. de Isid., lights Her bridal crescent o'er the holy stream— When wandering youths and maidens watch her beam, And number o'er the nights she hath to run, Ere she again embrace her bridegroom sun. “Conjunctio solis cum luna, quod est veluti utriusque connubium.” Jablonski. [? the glorious stream] On the opposite shore, rich plains, all teeming with cultivation to the water's edge, seemed to offer up, as from verdant altars, their fruits to the sun; while, beneath us, the Nile,— ? the glorious stream, That late between its banks was seen to glide— With shrines and marble cities, on each side, Glittering, like jewels strung along a chain— Had now sent forth its waters, and o'er plain And valley, like a giant from his bed Rising with outstretch'd limbs, superbly spread. ALCIPHRON: A FRAGMENT. LETTER I. FROM ALCIPHRON AT ALEXANDRIA TO CLEON AT ATHENS. Well may you wonder at my flight From those fair Gardens, in whose bowers Lingers whate'er of wise and bright, Of Beauty's smile or Wisdom's light, Is left to grace this world of ours. Well may my comrades, as they roam, On such sweet eves as this, inquire Why I have left that happy home Where all is found that all desire, And Time hath wings that never tire; Where bliss, in all the countless shapes That Fancy's self to bliss hath given, Comes clustering round, like road-side grapes That woo the traveller's lip, at even; Where Wisdom flings not joy away— As Pallas in the stream, they say, Once flung her flute—but smiling owns That woman's lip can send forth tones Worth all the music of those spheres So many dream of, but none hears; Where Virtue's self puts on so well Her sister Pleasure's smile that, loth From either nymph apart to dwell, We finish by embracing both. Yes, such the place of bliss, I own, From all whose charms I just have flown; And ev'n while thus to thee I write, And by the Nile's dark flood recline, Fondly, in thought, I wing my flight Back to those groves and gardens bright, And often think, by this sweet light, How lovelily they all must shine; Can see that graceful temple throw Down the green slope its lengthen'd shade, While, on the marble steps below, There sits some fair Athenian maid, Over some favourite volume bending; And, by her side, a youthful sage Holds back the ringlets that, descending, Would else o'ershadow all the page. But hence such thoughts!—nor let me grieve O'er scenes of joy that I but leave, As the bird quits awhile its nest To come again with livelier zest. And now to tell thee—what I fear Thou'lt gravely smile at—why I'm here. Though through my life's short, sunny dream, I've floated without pain or care, Like a light leaf, down pleasure's stream, Caught in each sparkling eddy there; Though never Mirth awaked a strain That my heart echoed not again; Yet have I felt, when ev'n most gay, Sad thoughts—I knew not whence or why— Suddenly o'er my spirit fly, Like clouds, that, ere we've time to say “How bright the sky is!” shade the sky. Sometimes so vague, so undefin'd Were these strange dark'nings of my mind— While nought but joy around me beam'd So causelessly they've come and flown, That not of life or earth they seem'd, But shadows from some world unknown. More oft, however, 'twas the thought How soon that scene, with all its play Of life and gladness must decay— Those lips I prest, the hands I caught— Myself—the crowd that mirth had brought Around me—swept like weeds away! This thought it was that came to shed O'er rapture's hour its worst alloys; And, close as shade with sunshine, wed Its sadness with my happiest joys. Oh, but for this disheart'ning voice Stealing amid our mirth to say That all, in which we most rejoice, Ere night may be the earth-worm's prey— But for this bitter—only this— Full as the world is brimm'd with bliss, And capable as feels my soul Of draining to its dregs the whole, I should turn earth to heav'n, and be, If bliss made Gods, a Deity! Thou know'st that night—the very last That 'mong my Garden friends I pass'd— When the School held its feast of mirth To celebrate our founder's birth. And all that He in dreams but saw When he set Pleasure on the throne Of this bright world, and wrote her law In human hearts, was felt and known— Not in unreal dreams, but true, Substantial joy as pulse e'er knew— By hearts and bosoms, that each felt Itself the realm where Pleasure dwelt. That night, when all our mirth was o'er, The minstrels silent, and the feet Of the young maidens heard no more— So stilly was the time, so sweet, And such a calm came o'er that scene, Where life and revel late had been— Lone as the quiet of some bay, From which the sea hath ebb'd away— That still I linger'd, lost in thought, Gazing upon the stars of night, Sad and intent, as if I sought Some mournful secret in their light; And ask'd them, mid that silence, why Man, glorious man, alone must die, While they, less wonderful than he, Shine on through all eternity. That night—thou haply may'st forget Its loveliness—but 'twas a night To make earth's meanest slave regret Leaving a world so soft and bright. On one side, in the dark blue sky, Lonely and radiant, was the eye Of Jove himself, while, on the other, 'Mong stars that came out one by one, The young moon—like the Roman mother Among her living jewels—shone. “Oh that from yonder orbs,” I thought, “Pure and eternal as they are, “There could to earth some power be brought, “Some charm, with their own essence fraught, “To make man deathless as a star, “And open to his vast desires “A course, as boundless and sublime “As that which waits those comet-fires, “That burn and roam throughout all time!” While thoughts like these absorb'd my mind, That weariness which earthly bliss, However sweet, still leaves behind, As if to show how earthly 'tis, Came lulling o'er me, and I laid My limbs at that fair statue's base— That miracle, which Art hath made Of all the choice of Nature's grace— To which so oft I've knelt and sworn, That, could a living maid like her Unto this wondering world be born, I would, myself, turn worshipper. Sleep came then o'er me—and I seem'd To be transported far away To a bleak desert plain, where gleam'd One single, melancholy ray, Throughout that darkness dimly shed From a small taper in the hand Of one, who, pale as are the dead, Before me took his spectral stand, And said, while, awfully a smile Came o'er the wanness of his cheek— “Go, and, beside the sacred Nile, “You'll find th' Eternal Life you seek.” Soon as he spoke these words, the hue Of death o'er all his features grew Like the pale morning, when o'er night She gains the victory, full of light; While the small torch he held became A glory in his hand, whose flame Brighten'd the desert suddenly, Ev'n to the far horizon's line— Along whose level I could see Gardens and groves, that seem'd to shine, As if then o'er them freshly play'd A vernal rainbow's rich cascade; And music floated every where, Circling, as 'twere itself the air, And spirits, on whose wings the hue Of heav'n still linger'd, round me flew, Till from all sides such splendours broke, That with the excess of light, I woke! Such was my dream;—and, I confess, Though none of all our creedless school E'er conn'd, believ'd, or reverenc'd less The fables of the priest-led fool, Who tells us of a soul, a mind, Separate and pure, within us shrin'd, Which is to live—ah, hope too bright!— For ever in yon fields of light; Who fondly thinks the guardian eyes Of God's are on him—as if, blest And blooming in their own blue skies, Th' eternal Gods were not too wise To let weak man disturb their rest!— Though thinking of such creeds as thou And all our Garden sages think, Yet is there something, I allow, In dreams like this—a sort of link With worlds unseen, which, from the hour I first could lisp my thoughts till now, Hath master'd me with spell-like power. And who can tell, as we're combin'd Of various atoms—some refin'd, Like those that scintillate and play In the fix'd stars—some, gross as they That frown in clouds or sleep in clay— Who can be sure, but 'tis the best And brightest atoms of our frame, Those most akin to stellar flame, That shine out thus, when we're at rest;— Ev'n as the stars themselves, whose light Comes out but in the silent night. Or is it that there lurks, indeed, Some truth in Man's prevailing creed, And that our Guardians, from on high, Come, in that pause from toil and sin, To put the senses' curtain by, And on the wakeful soul look in! Vain thought!—but yet, howe'er it be, Dreams, more than once, have prov'd to me Oracles, truer far than Oak, Or Dove, or Tripod ever spoke. And 'twas the words—thou'lt hear and smile— The words that phantom seem'd to speak— “Go, and beside the sacred Nile “You'll find the Eternal Life you seek—” That, haunting me by night, by day, At length, as with the unseen hand Of Fate itself, urg'd me away From Athens to this Holy Land; Where, 'mong the secrets, still untaught, The myst'ries that, as yet, nor sun Nor eye hath reach'd—oh, blessed thought!— May sleep this everlasting one. Farewell—when to our Garden friends Thou talk'st of the wild dream that sends The gayest of their school thus far, Wandering beneath Canopus' star, Tell them that, wander where he will, Or, howsoe'er they now condemn His vague and vain pursuit, he still Is worthy of the School and them;— Still, all their own—nor e'er forgets, Ev'n while his heart and soul pursue Th' Eternal Light which never sets, The many meteor joys that do, But seeks them, hails them with delight Where'er they meet his longing sight. And, if his life must wane away, Like other lives, at least the day, The hour it lasts shall, like a fire With incense fed, in sweets expire. LETTER II. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME. Memphis 'Tis true, alas—the mysteries and the lore I came to study on this wondrous shore, Are all forgotten in the new delights, The strange, wild joys that fill my days and nights. Instead of dark, dull oracles that speak From subterranean temples, those I seek Come from the breathing shrines where Beauty lives, And Love, her priest, the soft responses gives. Instead of honouring Isis in those rites At Coptos held, I hail her, when she lights Her first young crescent on the holy stream— When wandering youths and maidens watch her beam And number o'er the nights she hath to run, Ere she again embrace her bridegroom sun. While o'er some mystic leaf, that dimly lends A clue into past times, the student bends, And by its glimmering guidance learns to tread Back through the shadowy knowledge of the dead— The only skill, alas, I yet can claim Lies in deciphering some new lov'd-one's name— some gentle missive, hinting time and place, In language, soft as Memphian reed can trace. And where—oh where's the heart that could withstand Th' unnumber'd witcheries of this sun-born land, Where first young Pleasure's banner was unfurl'd, And Love hath temples ancient as the world! Where mystery, like the veil by Beauty worn, Hides but to win, and shades but to adorn; Where that luxurious melancholy, born Of passion and of genius, sheds a gloom Making joy holy;—where the bower and tomb Stand side by side, and Pleasure learns from Death The instant value of each moment's breath. Couldst thou but see how like a poet's dream This lovely land now looks!—the glorious stream, That late, between its banks, was seen to glide 'Mong shrines and marble cities, on each side Glittering like jewels strung along a chain, Hath now sent forth its waters, and o'er plain And valley, like a giant from his bed Rising with outstretch'd limbs, hath grandly spread. While far as sight can reach, beneath as clear And blue a heav'n as ever bless'd our sphere, Gardens, and pillar'd streets, and porphyry domes, And high-built temples, fit to be the homes Of mighty Gods, and pyramids, whose hour Outlasts all time, above the waters tower! Then, too, the scenes of pomp and joy, that make One theatre of this vast, peopled lake, Where all that Love, Religion, Commerce gives Of life and motion, ever moves and lives. Here, up the steps of temples from the wave Ascending, in procession slow and grave, Priests in white garments go, with sacred wands And silver cymbals gleaming in their hands; While there, rich barks—fresh from those sunny tracts Far off, beyond the sounding cataracts— Glide, with their precious lading to the sea, Plumes of bright birds, rhinoceros ivory, Gems from the Isle of Meroe, and those grains Of gold, wash'd down by Abyssinian rains. Here, where the waters wind into a bay Shadowy and cool, some pilgrims, on their way To Saïs or Bubastus, among beds Of lotus flowers, that close above their heads, Push their light barks, and there, as in a bower, Sing, talk, or sleep away the sultry hour; Oft dipping in the Nile, when faint with heat, That leaf, from which its waters drink most sweet.— While haply, not far off, beneath a bank Of blossoming acacias, many a prank Is played in the cool current by a train Of laughing nymphs, lovely as she Cleopatra., whose chain Around two conquerors of the world was cast, But, for a third too feeble, broke at last. For oh, believe not them, who dare to brand, As poor in charms, the women of this land. Though darken'd by that sun, whose spirit flows Through every vein, and tinges as it goes, ‘Tis but th' embrowning of the fruit that tells How rich within the soul of ripeness dwells— The hue their own dark sanctuaries wear, Announcing heav'n in half-caught glimpses there. And never yet did tell-tale looks set free The secret of young hearts more tenderly. Such eyes!—long, shadowy, with that languid fall Of the fring'd lids, which may be seen in all Who live beneath the sun's too ardent rays— Lending such looks as, on their marriage days Young maids cast down before a bridegroom's gaze! Then for their grace—mark but the nymph-like shapes Of the young village girls, when carrying grapes From green Anthylla, or light urns of flowers— Not our own Sculpture, in her happiest hours, E'er imag'd forth, even at the touch of him Apelles. Whose touch was life, more luxury of limb! Then, canst thou wonder if, mid scenes like these, I should forget all graver mysteries, All lore but Love's, all secrets but that best In heav'n or earth, the art of being blest! Yet are there times—though brief, I own, their stay, Like summer-clouds that shine themselves away— Moments of gloom, when ev'n these pleasures pall Upon my sadd'ning heart, and I recall That Garden dream—that promise of a power, Oh, were there such!—to lengthen out life's hour, On, on, as through a vista, far away Opening before us into endless day! And chiefly o'er my spirit did this thought Come on that evening—bright as ever brought Light's golden farewell to the world—when first Th' eternal pyramids of Memphis burst Awfully on my sight—standing sublime 'Twixt earth and heav'n, the watch-towers of Time, From whose lone summit, when his reign hath past From earth for ever, he will look his last! There hung a calm and solemn sunshine round Those mighty monuments, a hushing sound In the still air that circled them, which stole Like music of past times into my soul. I thought what myriads of the wise and brave And beautiful had sunk into the grave, Since earth first saw these wonders—and I said “Are things eternal only for the Dead? “Hath Man no loftier hope than this, which dooms “His only lasting trophies to be tombs? “But 'tis not so—earth, heaven, all nature shows “He may become immortal—may unclose “The wings within him wrapt, and proudly rise “Redeem'd from earth, a creature of the skies! “And who can say, among the written spells “From Hermes' hand, that, in these shrines and cells “Have, from the Flood, lay hid, there may not be “Some secret clue to immortality, “Some amulet, whose spell can keep life's fire “Awake within us, never to expire! “'Tis known that, on the Emerald Table See Notes on the Epicurean., hid “For ages in yon loftiest pyramid, “The Thrice-Great The Hermes Trismegistus. did himself, engrave, of old, “The chymic mystery that gives endless gold. “And why may not this mightier secret dwell “Within the same dark chambers? who can tell “But that those kings, who, by the written skill “Of th' Emerald Table, call'd forth gold at will, “And quarries upon quarries heap'd and hurl'd, “To build them domes that might outstand the world— “Who knows but that the heavenlier art, which shares “The life of Gods with man, was also theirs— “That they themselves, triumphant o'er the power “Of fate and death, are living at this hour; “And these, the giant homes they still possess, “Not tombs, but everlasting palaces, “Within whose depths, hid from the world above, “Even now they wander, with the few they love, “Through subterranean gardens, by a light “Unknown on earth, which hath nor dawn nor night! “Else, why those deathless structures? why the grand “And hidden halls, that undermine this land? “Why else hath none of earth e'er dared to go “Through the dark windings of that realm below, “Nor aught from heav'n itself, except the God “Of Silence, through those endless labyrinths trod?” Thus did I dream—wild, wandering dreams, I own, But such as haunt me ever, if alone, Or in that pause 'twixt joy and joy I be, Like a ship hush'd between two waves at sea. Then do these spirit whisperings, like the sound Of the Dark Future, come appalling round; Nor can I break the trance that holds me then, Till high o'er Pleasure's surge I mount again! Ev'n now for new adventure, new delight, My heart is on the wing;—this very night, The Temple on that island, half-way o'er From Memphis' gardens to the eastern shore, Sends up its annual rite The great Festival of the Moon. to her, whose beams Bring the sweet time of night-flowers and dreams; The nymph, who dips her urn in silent lakes, And turns to silvery dew each drop it takes;— Oh, not our Dian of the North, who chains In vestal ice the current of young veins, But she who haunts the gay Bubastian Bubastis, or Isis, was the Diana of the Egyptian mythology. grove, And owns she sees, from her bright heav'n above, Nothing on earth to match that heav'n but Love. Think, then, what bliss will be abroad to-night!— Besides those sparkling nymphs, who meet the sight Day after day, familiar as the sun, Coy buds of beauty, yet unbreath'd upon, And all the hidden loveliness, that lies,— Shut up, as are the beams of sleeping eyes, Within these twilight shrines—to-night shall be Let loose, like birds, for this festivity! And mark, 'tis nigh; already the sun bids His evening farewell to the Pyramids, As he hath done, age after age, till they Alone on earth seem ancient as his ray; While their great shadows, stretching from the light, Look like the first colossal steps of Night, Stretching across the valley, to invade The distant hills of porphyry with their shade. Around, as signals of the setting beam, Gay, gilded flags on every house-top gleam: While, hark!—from all the temples a rich swell Of music to the Moon—farewell—farewell. LETTER III. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME. Memphis. There is some star—or it may be That moon we saw so near last night— Which comes athwart my destiny For ever, with misleading light. If for a moment, pure and wise And calm I feel, there quick doth fall A spark from some disturbing eyes, That through my heart, soul, being flies, And makes a wildfire of it all. I've seen—oh, Cleon, that this earth Should e'er have giv'n such beauty birth!— That man—but, hold—hear all that pass'd Since yester-night, from first to last. The rising of the Moon, calm, slow, And beautiful, as if she came Fresh from the Elysian bowers below, Was, with a loud and sweet acclaim, Welcom'd from every breezy height, Where crowds stood waiting for her light. And well might they who view'd the scene Then lit up all around them, say, That never yet had Nature been Caught sleeping in a lovelier ray, Or rivall'd her own noon-tide face, With purer show of moonlight grace. Memphis—still grand, though not the same Unrivall'd Memphis, that could seize From ancient Thebes the crown of Fame, And wear it bright through centuries— Now, in the moonshine, that came down Like a last smile upon that crown, Memphis, still grand, among her lakes, Her pyramids and shrines of fire, Rose, like a vision, that half breaks On one who, dreaming still, awakes To music from some midnight choir: While to the west—where gradual sinks In the red sands, from Libya roll'd, Some mighty column, or fair sphynx That stood in kingly courts, of old— It seem'd as, mid the pomps that shone Thus gaily round him, Time look'd on, Waiting till all, now bright and blest, Should sink beneath him like the rest. No sooner had the setting sun Proclaim'd the festal rite begun, And, mid their idol's fullest beams, The Egyptian world was all afloat, Than I, who live upon these streams, Like a young Nile-bird, turn'd my boat To the fair island, on whose shores, Through leafy palms and sycamores, Already shone the moving lights Of pilgrims, hastening to the rites. While, far around, like ruby sparks Upon the water, lighted barks, Of every form and kind—from those That down Syene's cataract shoots, To the grand, gilded barge, that rows To tambour's beat and breath of flutes, And wears at night, in words of flame, On the rich prow, its master's name;— All were alive, and made this sea Of cities busy as a hill Of summer ants, caught suddenly In the overflowing of a rill. Landed upon the isle, I soon Through marble alleys and small groves Of that mysterious palm she loves, Reach'd the fair Temple of the Moon; And there—as slowly through the last Dim-lighted vestibule I pass'd— Between the porphyry pillars, twin'd With palm and ivy, I could see A band of youthful maidens wind, In measur'd walk, half dancingly, Round a small shrine, on which was plac'd That bird The Ibis., whose plumes of black and white Wear in their hue, by Nature trac'd, A type of the moon's shadow'd light. In drapery, like woven snow, These nymphs were clad; and each, below The rounded bosom, loosely wore A dark blue zone, or bandelet, With little silver stars all o'er, As are the skies at midnight, set. While in their tresses, braided through, Sparkled that flower of Egypt's lakes, The silvery lotus, in whose hue As much delight the young Moon takes, As doth the Day-God to behold The lofty bean-flower's buds of gold. And, as they gracefully went round The worshipp'd bird, some to the beat Of castanets, some to the sound Of the shrill sistrum tim'd their feet; While others, at each step they took, A tinkling chain of silver shook. They seem'd all fair—but there was one On whom the light had not yet shone, Or shone but partly—so downcast She held her brow, as slow she pass'd. And yet to me, there seem'd to dwell A charm about that unseen face— A something, in the shade that fell Over that brow's imagin'd grace, Which won me more than all the best Outshining beauties of the rest. And her alone my eyes could see, Enchain'd by this sweet mystery; And her alone I watch'd, as round She glided o'er that marble ground, Stirring not more th' unconscious air Than if a Spirit were moving there. Till suddenly, wide open flew The Temple's folding gates, and threw A splendour from within, a flood Of glory where these maidens stood. While, with that light—as if the same Rich source gave birth to both—there came A swell of harmony, as grand As e'er was born of voice and hand, Filling the gorgeous aisles around With luxury of light and sound. Then was it, by the flash that blaz'd Full o'er her features—oh 'twas then, As startingly her eyes she rais'd, But quick let fall their lids again, I saw—not Psyche's self, when first Upon the threshold of the skies She paus'd, while heaven's glory burst Newly upon her downcast eyes, Could look more beautiful or blush With holier shame than did this maid, Whom now I saw, in all that gush Of splendour from the aisles, display'd. Never—tho' well thou know'st how much I've felt the sway of Beauty's star— Never did her bright influence touch My soul into its depths so far; And had that vision linger'd there One minute more, I should have flown, Forgetful who I was and where, And, at her feet in worship thrown, Proffer'd my soul through life her own. But, scarcely had that burst of light And music broke on ear and sight, Than up the aisle the bird took wing, As if on heavenly mission sent, While after him, with graceful spring, Like some unearthly creatures, meant To live in that mix'd element Of light and song, the young maids went; And she, who in my heart had thrown A spark to burn for life, was flown. In vain I tried to follow;—bands Of reverend chanters fill'd the aisle: Where'er I sought to pass, their wands Motion'd me back, while many a file Of sacred nymphs—but ah, not they Whom my eyes look'd for—throng'd the way. Perplex'd, impatient, mid this crowd Of faces, lights—the o'erwhelming cloud Of incense round me, and my blood Full of its new-born fire—I stood, Nor mov'd, nor breath'd, but when I caught A glimpse of some blue, spangled zone, Or wreath of lotus, which, I thought, Like those she wore at distance shone. But no, 'twas vain—hour after hour, Till my heart's throbbing turn'd to pain, And my strain'd eyesight lost its power, I sought her thus, but all in vain. At length, hot—wilder'd—in despair, I rush'd into the cool night-air, And hurrying (though with many a look Back to the busy Temple) took My way along the moonlight shore, And sprung into my boat once more. There is a Lake, that to the north Of Memphis stretches grandly forth, Upon whose silent shore the Dead Have a proud City of their own Necropolis, or the City of the Dead, to the south of Memphis., With shrines and pyramids o'erspread— Where many an ancient kingly head Slumbers, immortalis'd in stone; And where, through marble grots beneath, The lifeless, rang'd like sacred things, Nor wanting aught of life but breath, Lie in their painted coverings, And on each new successive race, That visit their dim haunts below, Look with the same unwithering face, They wore three thousand years ago. There, Silence, thoughtful God, who loves The neighbourhood of death, in groves Of asphodel lies hid, and weaves His hushing spell among the leaves— Nor ever noise disturbs the air, Save the low, humming, mournful sound Of priests, within their shrines, at prayer For the fresh Dead entomb'd around. 'Twas tow'rd this place of death—in mood Made up of thoughts, half bright, half dark— I now across the shining flood Unconscious turn'd my light-wing'd bark. The form of that young maid, in all Its beauty, was before me still; And oft I thought, if thus to call Her image to my mind at will, If but the memory of that one Bright look of hers, for ever gone, Was to my heart worth all the rest Of woman-kind, beheld, possest— What would it be, if wholly mine, Within these arms, as in a shrine, Hallow'd by Love, I saw her shine— An idol, worshipp'd by the light Of her own beauties, day and night— If 'twas a blessing but to see And lose again, what would this be? In thoughts like these—but often crost By darker threads—my mind was lost, Till, near that City of the Dead, Wak'd from my trance, I saw o'erhead— As if by some enchanter bid Suddenly from the wave to rise— Pyramid over pyramid Tower in succession to the skies; While one, aspiring, as if soon 'Twould touch the heavens, rose o'er all; And, on its summit, the white moon Rested, as on a pedestal! The silence of the lonely tombs And temples round, where nought was heard But the high palm-tree's tufted plumes, Shaken, at times, by breeze or bird, Form'd a deep contrast to the scene Of revel, where I late had been; To those gay sounds, that still came o'er, Faintly, from many a distant shore, And th' unnumbered lights, that shone Far o'er the flood, from Memphis on To the Moon's Isle and Babylon. My oars were lifted, and my boat Lay rock'd upon the rippling stream; While my vague thoughts, alike afloat, Drifted through many an idle dream, With all of which, wild and unfix'd As was their aim, that vision mix'd, That bright nymph of the Temple—now, With the same innocence of brow She wore within the lighted fane— Now kindling, through each pulse and vein, With passion of such deep-felt fire As Gods might glory to inspire;— And now—oh Darkness of the tomb, That must eclipse ev'n light like hers! Cold, dead, and blackening mid the gloom Of those eternal sepulchres. Scarce had I turn'd my eyes away From that dark death-place, at the thought, When by the sound of dashing spray From a light oar my ear was caught, While past me, through the moonlight, sail'd A little gilded bark, that bore Two female figures, closely veil'd And mantled, towards that funeral shore. They landed—and the boat again Put off across the watery plain. Shall I confess—to thee I may— That never yet hath come the chance Of a new music, a new ray From woman's voice, from woman's glance, Which—let it find me how it might, In joy or grief—I did not bless, And wander after, as a light Leading to undreamt happiness. And chiefly now, when hopes so vain Were stirring in my heart and brain, When Fancy had allur'd my soul Into a chase, as vague and far As would be his, who fix'd his goal In the horizon, or some star— Any bewilderment, that brought More near to earth my high-flown thought— The faintest glimpse of joy, less pure, Less high and heavenly, but more sure, Came welcome—and was then to me What the first flowery isle must be To vagrant birds, blown out to sea. Quick to the shore I urg'd my bark, And, by the bursts of moonlight, shed Between the lofty tombs, could mark Those figures, as with hasty tread They glided on—till in the shade Of a small pyramid, which through Some boughs of palm its peak display'd, They vanish'd instant from my view. I hurried to the spot—no trace Of life was in that lonely place; And, had the creed I hold by taught Of other worlds, I might have thought Some mocking spirits had from thence Come in this guise to cheat my sense. At length, exploring darkly round The Pyramid's smooth sides, I found An iron portal—opening high 'Twixt peak and base—and, with a pray'r To the bliss-loving Moon, whose eye Alone beheld me, sprung in there. Downward the narrow stairway led Through many a duct obscure and dread, A labyrinth for mystery made, With wanderings onward, backward, round, And gathering still, where'er it wound, But deeper density of shade. Scarce had I ask'd myself, “Can aught “That man delights in sojourn here?”— When, suddenly, far off, I caught A glimpse of light, remote, but clear— Whose welcome glimmer seem'd to pour From some alcove or cell, that ended The long, steep, marble corridor, Through which I now, all hope, descended. Never did Spartan to his bride With warier foot at midnight glide. It seem'd as echo's self were dead In this dark place, so mute my tread. Reaching, at length, that light, I saw— Oh listen to the scene, now rais'd Before my eyes—then guess the awe, The still, rapt awe with which I gaz'd. 'Twas a small chapel, lin'd around With the fair, spangling marble, found In many a ruin'd shrine that stands Half seen above the Libyan sands. The walls were richly sculptur'd o'er, And character'd with that dark lore Of times before the Flood, whose key Was lost in th' “Universal Sea.”— While on the roof was pictur'd bright The Theban beetle, as he shines, When the Nile's mighty flow declines, And forth the creature springs to light, With life regenerate in his wings:— Emblem of vain imaginings! Of a new world, when this is gone, In which the spirit still lives on! Direct beneath this type, reclin'd On a black granite altar, lay A female form, in crystal shrin'd, And looking fresh as if the ray Of soul had fled but yesterday. While in relief, of silv'ry hue, Grav'd on the altar's front were seen A branch of lotus, brok'n in two, As that fair creature's life had been, And a small bird that from its spray Was winging, like her soul, away. But brief the glimpse I now could spare To the wild, mystic wonders round; For there was yet one wonder there, That held me as by witch'ry bound. The lamp, that through the chamber shed Its vivid beam, was at the head Of her who on that altar slept; And near it stood, when first I came— Bending her brow, as if she kept Sad watch upon its silent flame— A female form, as yet so plac'd Between the lamp's strong glow and me, That I but saw, in outline trac'd, The shadow of her symmetry. Yet did my heart—I scarce knew why— Ev'n at that shadow'd shape beat high. Nor was it long, ere full in sight The figure turn'd; and by the light That touch'd her features, as she bent Over the crystal monument, I saw 'twas she—the same—the same— That lately stood before me, bright'ning The holy spot, where she but came And went again, like summer lightning! Upon the crystal, o'er the breast Of her who took that silent rest, There was a cross of silver lying— Another type of that blest home, Which hope, and pride, and fear of dying Build for us in a world to come:— This silver cross the maiden rais'd To her pure lips:—then, having gaz'd Some minutes on that tranquil face, Sleeping in all death's mournful grace, Upward she turn'd her brow serene, As if, intent on heav'n, those eyes Saw then nor roof nor cloud between Their own pure orbits and the skies, And, though her lips no motion made, And that fix'd look was all her speech, I saw that the rapt spirit pray'd Deeper within than words could reach. Strange pow'r of Innocence, to turn To its own hue whate'er comes near, And make ev'n vagrant Passion burn With purer warmth within its sphere! She who, but one short hour before, Had come, like sudden wild-fire, o'er My heart and brain—whom gladly, even From that bright Temple, in the face Of those proud ministers of heav'n, I would have borne, in wild embrace, And risk'd all punishment, divine And human, but to make her mine;— She, she was now before me, thrown By fate itself into my arms— There standing, beautiful, alone, With nought to guard her, but her charms. Yet did I, then—did ev'n a breath From my parch'd lips, too parch'd to move, Disturb a scene where thus, beneath Earth's silent covering, Youth and Death Held converse through undying love? No—smile and taunt me as thou wilt— Though but to gaze thus was delight, Yet seem'd it like a wrong, a guilt, To win by stealth so pure a sight: And rather than a look profane Should then have met those thoughtful eyes, Or voice, or whisper broke the chain That link'd her spirit with the skies, I would have gladly, in that place, From which I watch'd her heav'nward face, Let my heart break, without one beat That could disturb a prayer so sweet. Gently, as if on every tread, My life, my more than life depended, Back through the corridor that led To this blest scene I now ascended, And with slow seeking, and some pain, And many a winding tried in vain, Emerg'd to upper air again. The sun had freshly ris'n, and down The marble hills of Araby, Scatter'd, as from a conqueror's crown, His beams into that living sea. There seem'd a glory in his light, Newly put on—as if for pride Of the high homage paid this night To his own Isis, his young bride, Now fading feminine away In her proud Lord's superior ray. My mind's first impulse was to fly At once from this entangling net— New scenes to range, new loves to try, Or, in mirth, wine, and luxury Of every sense, that night forget. But vain the effort—spell-bound still, I linger'd, without power or will To turn my eyes from that dark door, Which now enclos'd her 'mong the dead; Oft fancying, through the boughs, that o'er The sunny pile their flickering shed, 'Twas her light form again I saw Starting to earth—still pure and bright, But wakening, as I hop'd, less awe, Thus seen by morning's natural light, Than in that strange, dim cell at night. But no, alas—she ne'er return'd: Nor yet—though still I watch—nor yet, Though the red sun for hours hath burn'd, And now, in his mid course, hath met The peak of that eternal pile He pauses still at noon to bless, Standing beneath his downward smile, Like a great Spirit, shadowless!— Nor yet she comes—while here, alone, Saunt'ring through this death-peopled place, Where no heart beats except my own, Or 'neath a palm-tree's shelter thrown, By turns I watch, and rest, and trace These lines, that are to waft to thee My last night's wondrous history. Dost thou remember, in that Isle Of our own Sea, where thou and I Linger'd so long, so happy a while, Till all the summer flowers went by— How gay it was, when sunset brought To the cool Well our favourite maids— Some we had won, and some we sought— To dance within the fragrant shades, And, till the stars went down attune Their Fountain Hymns These Songs of the Well, as they were called by the ancients, are still common in the Greek isles. to the young moon? That time, too—oh, 'tis like a dream— When from Scamander's holy tide I sprung as Genius of the Stream, And bore away that blooming bride, Who thither came, to yield her charms (As Phrygian maids are wont, ere wed) Into the cold Scamander's arms, But met, and welcom'd mine, instead— Wondering, as on my neck she fell, How river-gods could love so well! Who would have thought that he, who rov'd Like the first bees of summer then, Rifling each sweet, nor ever lov'd But the free hearts, that lov'd again, Readily as the reed replies To the least breath that round it sighs— Is the same dreamer who, last night, Stood aw'd and breathless at the sight Of one Egyptian girl; and now Wanders among these tombs, with brow Pale, watchful, sad, as tho' he just, Himself, had ris'n from out their dust! Yet so it is—and the same thirst For something high and pure, above This withering world, which, from the first, Made me drink deep of woman's love— As the one joy, to heav'n most near Of all our hearts can meet with here— Still burns me up, still keeps awake A fever nought but death can slake. Farewell; whatever may befall— Or bright, or dark—thou'lt know it all. LETTER IV. FROM ORCUS, HIGH PRIEST OF MEMPHIS, TO DECIUS, THE PRÆTORIAN PREFECT. Rejoice, my friend, rejoice:—the youthful Chief Of that light Sect which mocks at all belief, And, gay and godless, makes the present hour Its only heaven, is now within our power. Smooth, impious school!—not all the weapons aim'd, At priestly creeds, since first a creed was fram'd, E'er struck so deep as that sly dart they wield, The Bacchant's pointed spear in laughing flowers conceal'd. And oh, 'twere victory to this heart, as sweet As any thou canst boast—ev'n when the feet Of thy proud war-steed wade through Christian blood, To wrap this scoffer in Faith's blinding hood, And bring him, tam'd and prostrate, to implore The vilest gods ev'n Egypt's saints adore. What!—do these sages think, to them alone The key of this world's happiness is known? That none but they, who make such proud parade Of Pleasure's smiling favours, win the maid, Or that Religion keeps no secret place, No niche, in her dark fanes, for Love to grace? Fools!—did they know how keen the zest that's given To earthly joy, when season'd well with heaven; How Piety's grave mask improves the hue Of Pleasure's laughing features, half seen through, And how the Priest, set aptly within reach Of two rich worlds, traffics for bliss with each, Would they not, Decius—thou, whom th' ancient tie 'Twixt Sword and Altar makes our best ally— Would they not change their creed, their craft, for ours? Leave the gross daylight joys that, in their bowers, Languish with too much sun, like o'er-blown flowers, For the veil'd loves, the blisses undisplay'd That slily lurk within the Temple's shade? And, 'stead of haunting the trim Garden's school— Where cold Philosophy usurps a rule, Like the pale moon's, o'er passion's heaving tide, Till Pleasure's self is chill'd by Wisdom's pride— Be taught by us, quit shadows for the true, Substantial joys we sager Priests pursue, Who, far too wise to theorise on bliss, Or pleasure's substance for its shade to miss, Preach other worlds, but live for only this:— Thanks to the well-paid Mystery round us flung, Which, like its type, the golden cloud that hung O'er Jupiter's love-couch its shade benign, Round human frailty wraps a veil divine. Still less should they presume, weak wits, that they Alone despise the craft of us who pray;— Still less their creedless vanity deceive With the fond thought, that we who pray believe. Believe!—Apis forbid—forbid it, all Ye monster Gods, before whose shrines we fall— Deities, fram'd in jest, as if to try How far gross Man can vulgarise the sky; How far the same low fancy that combines Into a drove of brutes yon zodiac's signs, And turns that Heaven itself into a place Of sainted sin and deified disgrace, Can bring Olympus ev'n to shame more deep, Stock it with things that earth itself holds cheap, Fish, flesh, and fowl, the kitchen's sacred brood, Which Egypt keeps for worship, not for food— All, worthy idols of a Faith that sees In dogs, cats, owls, and apes, divinities! Believe!—oh, Decius, thou, who feel'st no care For things divine, beyond the soldier's share, Who takes on trust the faith for which he bleeds, A good, fierce God to swear by, all he needs— Little canst thou, whose creed around thee hangs Loose as thy summer war-cloak, guess the pangs Of loathing and self-scorn with which a heart, Stubborn as mine is, acts the zealot's part— The deep and dire disgust with which I wade Through the foul juggling of this holy trade— This mud profound of mystery, where the feet, At every step, sink deeper in deceit. Oh! many a time, when, mid the Temple's blaze, O'er prostrate fools the sacred cist I raise, Did I not keep still proudly in my mind The power this priestcraft gives me o'er mankind— A lever, of more might, in skilful hand, To move this world, than Archimede e'er plann'd— I should, in vengeance of the shame I feel At my own mockery, crush the slaves that kneel Besotted round; and—like that kindred breed Of reverend, well-drest crocodiles they feed, At fam'd Arsinoë For the trinkets with which the sacred Crocodiles were ornamented, see the Epicurean, chap. x.—make my keepers bless, With their last throb, my sharp-fang'd Holiness. Say, is it to be borne, that scoffers, vain Of their own freedom from the altar's chain, Should mock thus all that thou thy blood hast sold, And I my truth, pride, freedom, to uphold? It must not be:—think'st thou that Christian sect, Whose followers, quick as broken waves, erect Their crests anew and swell into a tide, That threats to sweep away our shrines of pride— Think'st thou, with all their wondrous spells, ev'n they Would triumph thus, had not the constant play Of Wit's resistless archery clear'd their way?— That mocking spirit, worst of all the foes, Our solemn fraud, our mystic mummery knows, Whose wounding flash thus ever 'mong the signs Of a fast-falling creed, prelusive shines, Threat'ning such change as do the awful freaks Of summer lightning, ere the tempest breaks. But, to my point—a youth of this vain school, But one, whom Doubt itself hath fail'd to cool Down to that freezing point where Priests despair Of any spark from th' altar catching there— Hath, some nights since—it was, methinks, the night That follow'd the full Moon's great annual rite— Through the dark, winding ducts, that downward stray To these earth-hidden temples, track'd his way, Just at that hour when, round the Shrine, and me, The choir of blooming nymphs thou long'st to see, Sing their last night-hymn in the Sanctuary. The clangour of the marvellous Gate, that stands At the Well's lowest depth—which none but hands Of new, untaught adventurers, from above, Who know not the safe path, e'er dare to move— Gave signal that a foot profane was nigh:— 'Twas the Greek youth, who, by that morning's sky, Had been observ'd, curiously wand'ring round The mighty fanes of our sepulchral ground. Instant, th' Initiate's Trials were prepar'd,— The Fire, Air, Water; all that Orpheus dar'd, That Plato, that the bright-hair'd Samian Pythagoras. pass'd, With trembling hope, to come to—what, at last? Go, ask the dupes of Priestcraft; question him Who, mid terrific sounds and spectres dim, Walks at Eleusis; ask of those, who brave The dazzling miracles of Mithra's Cave, With its seven starry gates; ask all who keep Those terrible night-myst'ries where they weep And howl sad dirges to the answering breeze, O'er their dead Gods, their mortal Deities— Amphibious, hybrid things, that died as men, Drown'd, hang'd, empal'd, to rise, as gods, again;— Ask them, what mighty secret lurks below This sev'n-fold myst'ry—can they tell thee? No; Gravely they keep that only secret, well And fairly kept—that they have none to tell; And, dup'd themselves, console their humbled pride By duping thenceforth all mankind beside. And such th' advance in fraud since Orpheus' time— That earliest master of our craft sublime— So many minor Myst'ries, imps of fraud, From the great Orphic Egg have wing'd abroad, That, still to' uphold our Temple's ancient boast, And seem most holy, we must cheat the most; Work the best miracles, wrap nonsense round In pomp and darkness, till it seems profound; Play on the hopes, the terrors of mankind, With changeful skill; and make the human mind Like our own Sanctuary, where no ray, But by the Priest's permission, wins its way— Where through the gloom as wave our wizard rods, Monsters, at will, are conjured into Gods; While Reason, like a grave-faced mummy, stands, With her arms swathed in hieroglyphic bands. But chiefly in that skill with which we use Man's wildest passions for Religion's views, Yoking them to her car like fiery steeds, Lies the main art in which our craft succeeds. And oh be blest, ye men of yore, whose toil Hath, for our use, scoop'd out from Egypt's soil This hidden Paradise, this mine of fanes, Gardens, and palaces, where Pleasure reigns In a rich, sunless empire of her own, With all earth's luxuries lighting up her throne;— A realm for mystery made, which undermines The Nile itself and, 'neath the Twelve Great Shrines That keep Initiation's holy rite, Spreads its long labyrinths of unearthly light, A light that knows no change—its brooks that run Too deep for day, its gardens without sun, Where soul and sense, by turns, are charm'd, surpris'd, And all that bard or prophet e'er devis'd For man's Elysium, priests have realiz'd. Here, at this moment—all his trials past, And heart and nerve unshrinking to the last— Our new Initiate roves—as yet left free To wander through this realm of mystery; Feeding on such illusions as prepare The soul, like mist o'er waterfalls, to wear All shapes and hues, at Fancy's varying will, Through every shifting aspect, vapour still;— Vague glimpses of the Future, vistas shown, By scenic skill, into that world unknown, Which saints and sinners claim alike their own; And all those other witching, wildering arts, Illusions, terrors, that make human hearts, Ay, ev'n the wisest and the hardiest, quail To any goblin thron'd behind a veil. Yes—such the spells shall haunt his eye, his ear, Mix with his night-dreams, form his atmosphere; Till, if our Sage be not tam'd down, at length, His wit, his wisdom, shorn of all their strength, Like Phrygian priests, in honour of the shrine— If he become not absolutely mine, Body and soul, and, like the tame decoy Which wary hunters of wild doves employ, Draw converts also, lure his brother wits To the dark cage where his own spirit flits, And give us, if not saints, good hypocrites— If I effect not this, then be it said The ancient spirit of our craft hath fled, Gone with that serpent-god the Cross hath chas'd To hiss its soul out in the Theban waste.
