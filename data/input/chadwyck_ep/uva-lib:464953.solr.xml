      <field name="fulltext">PrÃ¦-existence. A POEM, In imitation of MILTON. Has Animas, ubi mille rotam volvere per Annos, LethÃ¦um ad fluvium Deus evocat agmine magno, Scilicet immemores supera ut convexa revisant: Igneus est illis vigor, &amp; cÅlestis origo Seminibus, quantum non noxia corpora tardant: Hinc sperant, cupiunt, odiunt, metuuntq; dolentq; Corporis inclusÃ¦ muris, &amp; carcere cÃ¦co; In quo exercentur pÃ¦nis, veterumque malorum Supplicia expenduntâ Donec longa dies, perfecto temporis orbe Concretam exemit Labem, purumque reliquit Ãthereum sensum, atque auraÃ¯ simplicis Ignem. Now had th' Archangel Trumpet, rais'd sublime Above the Walls of Heav'n, begun to sound; All Ãther took the Blast, and Hell beneath Shoke with Celestial Noise; th' Almighty Host Hot with pursuit, and reaking with the Blood Of guilty Cherubs smear'd in sulphurous Dust, Pause at the known Command of sounding Gold; And first they close the wide Tartarian Gates, Th' impenetrable Folds on brazen Hinge Rowl creaking horrible; the Din beneath O'ercomes the Roar of Flames, and deafens Hell; Then through the solid Gloom with nimble Wing They cut their shining Traces up to Light; Return'd upon the Edge of heavenly Day, Where thinnest Beams play round the vast obscure, And with eternal Gleam drive back the Night, They find the Troops less stubborn, less involv'd In Crime and Ruine, barr'd the Realms of Peace, Yet uncondemn'd to baleful Seats of Woe, Doubtful and suppliant; all the Plumes of Light Moult from their shuddering Wings, and sickly fear Shades every Face with Horrour; conscious Guilt Rowls in the livid Eye-ball, and each Breast Shakes with the Dread of future Doom unknown. 'Twas there the wide Circumference of Heaven Opens in two vast Gates, that inward turn Voluminous, on Jasper Columns hung By Geometry Divine, they ever glow With living Sculptures, that arise by turns T'imboss the shining Leaves, by turns they set To give succeeding Argument their place; In holy Hierogliphicks on they move, The Gaze of journying Angels, as they pass Oft looking back, and held in deep surprize; Here stood the Troops distinct; the Cherub Guard Unbarr'd the splendid Gates, and in they rowl Harmonious, for a vocal Spirit sits Within each Hinge, and as they onward drive, In just Divisions break the num'rous Jarr With Symphony melodious, such as Spheres Involv'd in ten-fold Wreaths are said to sound. Out flows a blaze of Glory; for on high Tow'ring advanc'd the moving Throne of God, Vast and Majestick; on each radient side The pointed Rays slope glittering, at the foot Glides a full Tide of Day, that onward pours In liquid Torrents through the black Abyss, Sparkling among reluctant Shades which thence Retire confus'd; as when Vesuvio shakes With inward Torments, and disgorges Flames, O'er the vast Mountain's Ridge the burning Waves Drive their refulgent Curls, and on they rowl Sweeping the glowing Plains down to the Sea; Th' affrighted Sea leaps back with hideous Roar To give the Fire its Course: Thus Chaos wild Hissing recoils to let in Floods of Light. Above the Throne, th' Ideas heavenly bright Of past, of present, and of coming time Fix'd their immov'd abode, and there present An endless Landskip of created Things To sight Celestial, where Angelick Eyes Are lost in Prospect; for the shiny Range Boundless and various, in its Bosom bears Millions of full proportion'd Worlds, beheld With stedfast Eyes, till more arise to view, And farther inward Scenes start up unknown. Myriads of Seraphs in long Series wait About the Throne, and as it moves proceed In numerous Order to Celestial Song: Above; the Symphony of mellow Flutes, And Harps by flying Angels gently touch'd, Relieve the Trumpet's rage, and fitly blend The solemn sounds in Harmony divine; Such as might tune new Worlds, and give the Laws To Globes on high, and the just Figure guide Of Planets forming all their airy Dance; Below; the blazing Wheels drive bounding o'er The starry Pavement; Stars and Hills of Light Double their Glories where the Chariot rowls With rattling sound; and th' EmpyrÃ¦um vast Down to its stedfast Axis, groans throughout Under the burning Tracts, till now it rests Upon the gaping Brink of Heaven; and there With open Pomp, fills the vast empty space. Silence ensues; a deep and awful pause More terrible, all Expectation held In Horror; now Wrath imminent amaz'd With dreadful Precipice, to all it seems More formidable near: Then from the Throne A vocal Thunder rowl'd the Sence of God, Majestically long, repugnant all To Princes Customs here; their Judgments flash On Guilt, with Words concise, and sudden blaze; Quite otherwise, the God's enlarged Speech Sets wide the fate of things; that all around Might take full Prospects of their coming Doom. Servants of God! and Vertues great in Arms! âW' approve your faithful Works, and you return Bless'd from the dire pursuit of rebel Foes; Resolv'd, obdurate, they have try'd the force Of this Right Hand, and known Almighty Pow'r; Transfix'd with Lightning down they sunk, they fell Into the fiery Gulph, and deep they plunge Below the burning Waves, to hide their Heads In shelter from my Vengeance bellowing hence, More fierce and scorching with more dreadful Fires, There let 'em find their Doom, that durst defy Omnipotence, and slight his proffer'd Grace; Rowling in Flames, and ne'er to feel a Dawn Of heavenly Day; instead, the Mind imbibes Eternal Gloom, and sign'd with constant Flames Can find no Ease; while fierce their boiling Rage Eats through th' impyral Mould, and glows within, With endless Pain; not one repentant Thought Shall cool the Breast, but proud in horrid Crime The Soul anheals and hardens in the Fire. But you! commission'd by Commands Divine, Have wisely fill'd your Trust, and clos'd 'em all Within the fervid Lake, lest any roam Into the dark Abiss to shun their Doom, And in the Womb immense of Things unborn Should seek annihilation; you must rise Among the shining Virtues, more sublime; On lofty Thrones preferr'd for lofty Deeds. For you, ye guilty Throng! that lately joyn'd In this Sedition, since seduc'd from Good, And caught in Trains of Guile, by Spirits malign, Superior in their Order; you accept Trembling, my heavenly Clemency and Grace. When the long Ãra once has fill'd its Orb, You shall emerge to Light, and humbly here, Again shall bow before this favouring Throne, If your own Virtue second my Decree: But all must have their Manes first below, So stands th' eternal Fate, but smoother yours Than what lost Angels feel; nor can our Reign Without just Dooms, the Peace of Heav'n secure; For Forms Celestial new erect in Glory Wou'd totter, dazl'd with the Heighths of Power, Did not the Nerves of Justice fix their Sight. See, where below in Chaos wond'rous deep, A Speck of Light dawns forth, and thence throughout The Shades, in many a Wreath my forming Power There swiftly turns the burning Eddy round, Absorbing all crude Matter near its Brink; Which next, with subtle Motions take the Form I please to stamp, the Seed of Infant Worlds All now in Embrio, but e'er long shall rise Variously scatter'd in this vast Expanse, Involv'd in winding Orbs until the Brims Of outward Circles brush these heavenly Gates: The middle Point a Globe of curling Fire Shall hold, which round it sheds its genial Heat; Where e'er I kindle Life, the Motion grows In all the endless Orbs, from this Machine; And infinite Vicissitudes shall rowl About this restless Center; for I rear In those Meanders turn'd, a dusty Ball, Deform'd all o'er with Woods, whose shaggy Tops Enclose eternal Mists, and deadly Damps Hover within their Boughs, to choak the Light; Impervious Scenes of Horror, 'till reform'd To Fields, and grassy Dales, and flow'ry Meads, By your continual Pains: The Torrid Zone Here frys with constant Heat, the swarthy World; Parching the Plains where hideous Monsters glare, And dusty Mountains, tumbl'd by the Winds, Stretch their uncertain Heaps; no less the Frost At either end shall rage, and high shall raise Firm Promontories; vast the Ruins seem Of desart Nature, and th' eternal Piles Load all the dreary Coast, and thick in Ice Arm either Pole, that yearly peeps ascance On coming Light, but feels no gentle Ray Unbind the frozen Chain: between these lie The changeful Clymes, alternately they burn, And chill again by turns: for both Extremes Make their Incursions here; and this my Will Unchangeable, ordains your doleful Seat. Beneath; mishapen Chaos, and the Field Of fighting Atoms, where hot, moist and dry, Wage an eternal War with dismal Roar; The dismal Roar breaks smoothly on the Ground, Sacred to horror, and eternal Night: Here Silence sits, whose visionary Shape In Folds of wreathy mantling sinks obscure And in dark Fumes reclines his drowsy head; An Urn he holds, from whence a Lake proceeds, Wide, flowing gently, smooth, and Lethe nam'd: Hither compell'd, each Soul must drink long Draughts Of those forgetful Streams, 'till Forms within, And all the great Ideas fade and die: For if vast Thoughts shou'd play about a Mind Inclos'd in Flesh, and dregging cumbrous Life, Fluttering and beating in the mournful Cage, It soon wou'd break its Grates and wing away: 'Tis therefore my Decree, the Soul return Naked from off this Beach and perfect Blank, To visit the New World; and strait to feel Itself, in crude consistence closely shut, The dreadful Monument of just Revenge; Immur'd by Heaven's own Hand, and plac'd erect On fleeting Matter, all imprison'd round With Walls of Clay; th' Ãthereal Mould shall bear The Chain of Members, deafen'd with an Ear, Blinded by Eyes, and manacl'd in Hands. Here Anger, vast Ambition, and Disdain, And all the haughty Movements rise and fall, As Storms of neighbouring Atoms tear the Soul; And Hope, and Love, and all the calmer turns Of easy Hours, in their gay gilded Shapes, With sudden run, skin o'er deluded Minds, As matter leads the Dance; but one Desire Unsatisfied, shall marr ten thousand Joys. The Rank of Beings that shall first advance, Drink deep of Human Life, and long shall stay On this great Scene of Cares; from all the rest, That longer for the destin'd Body wait, Less Penance I expect; and short abode In those pale dreary Kingdoms will content: Each has his lamentable Lot, and all On different Racks, abide the Pains of Life. The pensive Spirit takes the lonely Grove, Nightly he visits all the Sylvan Scenes, Where far remote, a melancholly Moon Raising her Head, serene and shorn of Beams, Throws here and there her Glimmerings through the Trees, To make more awful Darkness; starry Lights Hung up on high, shed round 'em as they burn A Pale sad influence, and they gild the Plains With doubtful Rays, which strike within the Shades A trembling Lustre and uncertain Light. The Sage shall haunt this solitary Ground, And view the dismal Landskip, limn'd within In horrid Shades mix'd with imperfect Light; Here Judgment, blinded by delusive Sence Contracted through the Cranny of an Eye, Shoots up faint languid Beams, to that dark Seat Wherein the Soul, bereav'd of native Fire, Sits intricate in misty Clouds obscur'd, Ev'n from itself conceal'd, and there presides O'er jarring Images with Reason's sway, Which by his ordering more confounds their Form; And by decisions more imbroyls the Fray: The more he strives t'appease, the more he feels The strugling Surges of the darksome Void Impetuous, and the thick revolving Thoughts Encountring Thoughts, Image on Image turn'd, A Chaos of wild Science, where sometimes The clashing Notions strike out casual Light; Which soon must perish and be lost again In the thick Darkness round it: Now, he trys With all his Might to raise some weighty Thought, Of Me, of Fate, or of th' eternal Round, Which but recoils to crush the labouring Mind: High are his Reasonings, but the feeble Clue Of fleeting Images he draws in vain To wondrous length; (for still the turning Maze Eludes his Art,) its end flies far away, And leaves him tracing round the toilsome Path, Returning oft on the same beaten Thought. For much of Good he talks, and Life serene, Of Happiness deny'd, the dismal waste Of Wisdom's Privilege, and th' obdurate Breast, Stubborn in Anguish; idle Wisdom, all Weak Sorcery to charm a real Pain; Distasting Crowds and Business, thus he seeks Diversion in himself, but with deep Thoughts He kindles doubt; and while he strives to blow The Ashes off, revives the brand of Care. Hence far remov'd, a different noisie Race In Cities full and frequent take their Seat, Where Honour's crush'd, and Gratitude oppress'd, With swelling hopes of Gain, that raise within A Tempest, and drove onward by Success, Can find no Bounds; for Creatures of a Day Stretch their wide Cares to Ages; full increase Starves the penurious Soul, while empty sound Fills th' Ambitious; that shall ever shrink, Pining with endless Cares, whilst this shall swell To Tympany enormous. Bright in Arms Here shines the Hero, out he fiercely leads A martial Throng, his Instruments of Rage, To fill the World with Death, and thin Mankind. Ambition drives, and round the World he roams, Marking his Way with Blood; the dreadful noise Begets a Fame; and all the Breath he leaves Is spent in his false Praise, and vainly bloats The Tyrant's Soul; while high his Kingdoms rise In fleeting Pomp, hovering their gawdy Wings Around the servile Globe, that tamely bends Beneath his haughty Reign; and all his Slaves Under his Yoke shall groan, and scarce shall groan Without a Crime: Here torturing Engines roar With human voice disguiss'd; Earth, Water, Fire, Are made (dire Elements of Cruelty!) Subservient to his Lust, and Power to kill; Yet shall the Herd endure, and dare not break United their imaginary Chain; While their great Monarch chills with equal Fears, No less a Slave than they; each Rumour shakes The haughty Purple; dark and cloudy Cares Involve the awful Throne, that stands erect, Balanc'd on the wild People's temper'd Rage, And fortify'd with dangerous Arts of Power: But Death shall shift those Scenes of Misery; Then doubtful Titles kindle up new Wars, And urge on ling'ring Fate; the Ensigns blaze About the Camp, and Drums and Trumpets sound, Prepare a solemn Way to grizly War: Javelins and bearded Spears in ghastly Ranks Erect their shining Heads, and round the Field A Harvest's seen of formidable Death; Then joins the horrid Shock, whose bellowing Burst Torments the shatter'd Air, and drowns the Groans Of Men below that rowl in certain Death: These are the mortal Sports, and tragick Plays, By Man himself embroil'd; the dire Debate Makes the waste Desart seem serene and mild, Where savage Nature in one Common lies, By homely Cots possess'd; all squalid wild, And despicably poor, they range the Field, And feel their share of Hunger, Care and Pain, Cheated by flying Prey; and now they tear Their panting Flesh; and now with Nails unclean They tug their shaggy Beards; and deeply quaff Of humane Woe, even when they rudely sip The flowing Stream, or chew the savory Pulp Of Nature's freshest Viands; fragrant Fruits Enjoy'd with trembling, and in danger sought. But where th' appointed limits of a Law, Fences the general safety of the World, No greater quiet Reigns; for wanton Man, In giddy frolick, easily leaps o'er His own invented Bounds; hence Rapine, Fraud, Revenge and Lust, and all the hideous Train Of nameless Ills, distort the meagre Mind To endless Shapes of Woe. Here Misers mourn Departed Gold, and there defrauded Heirs Dire Perjuries complain; the blended Loads Of Punishment and Crime, deform the World, And give no rest to Man; with Pangs and Throws He enters on the Stage; prophetick Tears And Infant Cries prelude his future Woes; And all is one continu'd Scene of Grief, Till the sad sable Curtain falls in Death. But that last Act shall in one Moment close Of doubt and darkness; Pain shall crack the Strings Of Life decay'd; no less the Soul convuls'd Trembles in anxious Cares, and shuddering stands, Afraid to leap into the opening Gulph Of future Fate, till all the Banks of Clay Fall from beneath his Feet; in vain he grasps The shatter'd Reeds that cheat his easie Wish: Reason is now no more; that narrow Lamp (Which with its sickly Fires wou'd shoot its Beams To Distances unknown, and stretch its Rays Ascance my Paths, in deepest darkness veil'd) Is sunk into its Socket; inly there It burns a dismal Light; th' expiring Flame Is choak'd in Fumes, and parts in various Doubt. Then the gay Glories of the living World Shall cast their empty Varnish, and retire Out of his feeble view; and rising shade Sits hovering o'er all Nature's various Face: Musick shall cease, and Instruments of Joy Shall fail that sullen Hour; nor can the Mind Attend their Sounds, when Fancies swim in Death Confus'd and crush'd, with Cares; for long shall seem The dreary Road, and melancholy dark That leads he knows not where; here empty space Gapes horrible, and threatens to absorp All Being; yonder sooty Demons glare, And dolorous Spectres grin; the shapeless Rout Of wild Imagination, dance and play Before his Eyes obscure; till all in Death Shall vanish, and the Prisoner now enlarg'd, Regains the flaming Borders of the Sky. He ended. Peals of Thunder rend the Heavens, And Chaos, from the bottom turn'd, resounds The mighty Clangor: All the heavenly Host Approve the high Decree, and loud they sing Eternal Justice; while the guilty Troops, Sad with their Doom, but sad without Despair, Fall fluttering down to Lethe's Lake, and there For Penance, and the destin'd Body wait.
