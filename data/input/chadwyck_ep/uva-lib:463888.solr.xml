Mirrha, The Mother of Adonis. I sing the ruine of a beautious Maide, White as my paper, or loues fairest Doue. shine bright Apollo, Muse be not affraide, Although thou chauntest of vnnaturall loue. Great is my quill, to bring foorth such a birth, as shall abash the Virgins of our earth. smoake Goulden censors vpon Paphos shrine, drinke deep Lenæus to this worke of mine. Cupid to Thracia went to heare a Song of Orpheus, to whome euen Tygers came, And left their sauage Nature, if there long they did with his sweet Melodie remaine. Wolues lost their preyes, and by signes praid him sing Beasts left the Lyon, and chose him their King. Cecropian Apes did on his musicke waite, Yet of them all, not one could immitate. Tis saide when Orpheus dyed, he did descend To the infernall, so the Furies boast: Where now they giue him leaue his eies to bend without all feare, on her whome he once lost, By a regardant looke, but tis not so: Ioue not reseru'd such musicke for belowe, But placed him amongst celestiall stars, To keep the Scorpion, Lyon, Beare from Iars For euer since the fall of Phaeton, that then displaced, them they were at strife For their degrees, till his alluring Tone. who though in death hath the office of his life. Though more diuinely: and where he attracts, More glorious bodies to admire his actes. Faire stranger shape of creature, and of beast, With his concordant tunes, plac'd them in rest. The Dittie was (and Cupid lent an eare) Vpon the death of his Euridice: Which still he sung, as if his former feare, Of loosing her was now, or else would be, The Eccho beate the noyse vp to the Spheares, And to his passionate song, Gods bent their eares. It was a signe, he was new come from hell, Their tunes so sad, he immitates so well. Such passion it did strike vpon the earth, that Daphnes roote groan'd for Apollo's wrong: Hermophrodite wept snewers and wisht his birth had neuer bin, or that he more had clung To Salmacis, and Clitie grieued in vaine: Leueothoes wrong, the occasion of her baine, my wilful eie (this should the burthen be) Hath rob'd me of, twice slaine Euridice. Cicnus stil proud though he confuted be, for Phaetons losse, would needs afresh complaine Thinking therewith to singe as sweet as he, but pittiles he sung and dyed in vaine. Eccho was pleas'd with voice resounding brim as proud to loose her shape to answer him. Hether resorted more then wel could heare, but on my Muse, &amp; speake what chansed there Amongst the rest of Vesta-vowed Girles, came Mirrha (whose thoughts no guile then knew Like a bright diamond circled with pearls, whose radiant eye delt lustre to the hew O fall the dames: whose face so farre aboue though the rest (beautious all) vnwounded made loue, loue for neuer since Spiches was made a star did he see nature excel art so far. He ch?g'd his shape, his wings he oft hath torne, and like a hunter to this nimph he came: With gold tipt Iauelin and a bugle Horne, such as they beare to make the Lyon tame: First did he kisse hir hand, which then did melt with loue's impression, Cupid the like felt: Stroke dumbe, he stood in an vnwonted guise, such magicke beawtie carries in her eies. At length (quoth he) should I not say I loue, I should both Cupid and his Mother wrong: By thee faire Maid a power farre aboue, My heart is the true index of my tongue. And by my naked wordes you may discouer, I am not traded like a common Louer. Rare obiects, rare amazements bred, tis true: And their effects are tryed in me by you. My barren braine, can blesse me with no store Of able Epithits, so what praise I giue Makes not you ritcher though it makes me poorer therefore in vaine against the streame I striue, Th' ore curious painter, meaning to excell, Oft marres the worke, the which before was well, And he shall dazeled be, and tyred soone, That leuelleth his shafts to hit the Moone. With this, she turnd her blushing head aside, &amp; vail'd her face with lawne, not halfe so white That euen the blending roses were espyed despight the cloudes, that hid them in despight She threw her thin breath through the lawne, and said Leaue gentle youth, do not thus snare a maid I came to Orpheus Song, good then forbeare, It is his tune, not yours can charme mine eare. Let Orpheus learne (quoth he) of thee to sing, Bid him charme men Mirrha as thou canst doe: Let him tame Man, that is the Lyons King, And lay him prostrate at his feete belowe. As thou canst doe: nor Orpheus nor the spheares Haue Tones like thee, to rauish mortall eares. Yea, were this Thracian Harpet Iudge to tell, (As thee) hee'd sweare he sung not halfe so wel. Nor dying Swans, nor Phebus when he loue's, equals thy voice (though he in musicke courts and as the God whose voice the firm earth moues making the terrors of the great, his sports, Whose first word strooke into the Chaos light: so if that contrary thou take delight, at thy word, darknes would or'e-cloude the ayre and the fayrest day giue place to thee more faire. Fame hath resing'd her lasting Trump to thee, as to the worthyer, then thy fame display: Tell Venus thou art fairer farre then she, For thine own worth becomes thee best to say, Time will stand still, the sunne in motion stay, Sirens be mute to heare thee speake of Mirrha, Thy voice, if heard in the low shades should be Would a third time fetch back Euridice. Giue eare eternall wonder to a swaine, Twas writ in starres that I should see that face: And seeing loue, and in that loue be slaine, if beautie pittie not my wretched case. Fortune and loue, the starres and powers diuine, Haue all betraide me to those eyes of thine. O proue not then more crueller th? they, Loues shaftes &amp; fates wheeles, who hath power to stay Stay there (quoth she) giue backe those powers their owne or not impose their powerful force on me: Haue I the least word or the least glance thrown To make you attribute what's destinie Vnto my beautie: if loue and fate you wound, Throw vowes to th?, their altars are soone found. Wouldst thou haue me pittie before they doe? Loue's blinde, and fortun's deafe, so am I too. I know not loue, sure tis a subtle thing, I, by these blushes that thy charmes haue raisd, T'allay more quiet, tell loues little king, I serue a Mistres he himselfe hath praisd Though he enuy, a rare and sacred floure, Whom he had will to wrong, but neuer power. Now Cupid hangs the head, and melts in shame, for she did vtter Vestas holy name. And as you see a woman teeming young, bearing the growing burthen of her womb: Missing the dainty she hath lookt for long, falls straight in passionate sicknes pale &amp; dumb (for seeing she hath lost it) will not tell, for what she in this forced passion fell. So when his hopes were lost, he would not say, what was the cause, but this to her did laye. Virgin beware that fire within thy brest, to Vesta dedicate do not expire: as she must warie be that is the best to keepe it, it is knowne no lasting fier. The fuell cold fruitelesse Virginitie, which if zeale blow not violent, wil so one die: This stricts a virgins life, and who but knowes, that loue and chastitie, were euer foes. And if ere loue assaile those virgins forts, those Iuory bulwarkes that defend your heart: Though he be king of sportes he neuer sports, when as he wounds, but playes the Tirants part And so much more he wil tri?ph oure thee, by how much thou contents his deitie: I know you to be chaste, but yet faire Mayd, if ere you loue youle finde what I haue sayd. Sir (quoth she) when I loue you shall be mine: but know the time, when you shall claime me your's When as the fire extinct as Vestaes shrine: and Venus leaues to haunt the Papheon bowres, When men are perfect friendes Tigers at peace, Discord in heauen, and powers diuine doe cease, when Fortune sleeps &amp; the north star doth moue wh? Turtles leaue to mourne their mates, ile loue Ere this was ended, Orpheus song was done, And all the Virgins fell into their rankes, Each tooke their leaue of him, so did the sunne, who now was poasting to the westerne banckes and the wild beasts, wh? he had made more tame, seem'd to depart with reuerence at his name. Each one gaue place to Mirrha as their duetie, She being preferr'd in state, first as in beautie. Now Cupid of her his last leaue doth take, so haue I seene a soule and body part: He begs a chaste kisse for her mothers sake, and vowes she shall be soueraigne of his heart. But whether he disembling did it, or twa's fate, (As extream'st loue, turnes to the direst hate) Being repulst, but this kisse did inspire, her brest with an infernall and vnnam'd desire. Night like a masque was entred heauens greate hall with thousand torches vshering the way: The complements of parting were done all, &amp; homewards Orpheus chaunteth many alay; Venus had sent her coach, drawn by a Doue, For little Cupid the great God of loue. &amp; this hath sprung (as men haue sayen of yore) For Mirrhas sake he vow'd to loue no more. Blacke as my inck now must my verse commence You blushing girles, and parents siluer-gray: As farre as Trace from vs, so farre from hence goe, that you may not heare me say, A daughter did with an adulterous head, And heauie lust, presse downe her fathers bed, such Songs as these more fit the Tartars cares, had Orpheus sung it, beasts had pour'd out teares. Vnhallowed lust, for loues lies drownd in poison in what blacke ornament shall I attire thee? Since I must write of thy so sad confusion, shall I say Cupid with his brand did fire thee? Accuse the Fates, or thee shall I accuse? Mirrha weepes yet, onely say this my Muse: wise destinie, true loue, and mortall thought, would nere confirme this, the furies brought this She loues her Father, Daughter nere lou'd so, for as her mother lou'd so lou'd she him: Thirsting in fire those softer sweetes to know, Amidst whose waues, Uenus in pride doth swim So young she was, yet that her father kist her. Which she so duely lookes for he nere mist her, Yet could he haue conceiu'd as he did after those kisses rellish much vnlike a daughter. Giue to her golde of Ophire Indian shels, Cloath her with Tirian purple skin of beast: Perfurme her waies with choice Arabian smells, Present her with the Phœnix in her nest, Delight her eare with song of poets rare, All these with Cyneas might naught compare, “The comfort of the minde being tane away, “Nectar not pleaseth, nor Ambrosia. The feast of Bacchus at this present time, Was by the giddie Menades intended; There Mirrha daunc'd, and Orpheus sung in rime crownd with green thirses, now y? try?hes ended with praise to Bacchus all depart with spright, vnto their feastes, feasts that deuoure the night. for loe, the stars, in trauaile in the skie, brought forth their brightnes to each waking eye High midnight came, and she to bed ward hies, pretending rest, to beguile natures rest: Anon the gloomy gallerie she spies, toward her chamber, and she first that blest, Her care-fild eyes, her far hers picture was Arm'd but the face, although it dumbe, alasse, she ask'd and if he call'd, seeing no reply, she answer'd for her father, and said I. Daughter (quoth she) why art thou thus alone? Let Doues so mourn girle, y? hath lost their mates Thine is to come, then prethee cease thy mone, Care shold not dwel with great &amp; high estates. Let her that needs and is not faire at all, Repine at fortune, loue shall be thy thrall, wing'd as he is, and armed thou shalt see, (I haue the power to giue) &amp; giue him thee. Father (quoth she) and spoke with smaller voice, Nature hath made me yours, yours I must be: You choose my choice, for in you lies my choice, Hereat shee starts as what not feares the guiltie? Thinking the shadowe knew her double sence, and blushing, in strange feare departeth thence. blaming her selfe, for vttering her blacke fault to him who armed stood gainst her assault. Anon she spies many a youthfull Lord, In seuerall Tables, each in seuerall guise, Whose pictures they had sent with one accord, To shew their manly features to her eyes, Whose dumb'd perswasiue images were plac'd, To see if any in her lookes were grac'd: But heere in vaine, their faire assayes doe proue for had they spake they could not win her loue. Ouer her Mothers shape a vaile she drew, and weeping, saide: may I nere see thee more: Poore abus'd image, doost not turne thy hew, to see so foule an obiect thee before? Didst thou but know, what's sprung from out thy wombe thy shap cold speak, whilst y? thy self stodst d?be Art would claime Nature in thy heauie woes, thy shape haue limbs, thy limbs be stiff as those. Anon she leapt on it with ardent heate, and full of teares, yet falles vppon her backe: Wishing euen in that griefe the lustfull feate, Were now perform'd (woemen oft longings lack down sunck the down, and with so deep impresse that had Hermaphroditus bin there he might ges Salmacis were aganie his prostitute, or one more farre, then to denie her suite. A strange conceite, had now possest hir braine, nie equall to her lust, thought innocent: She gaue vp to desire, and leapes amaine, From the bruisd bed, with bloodie fram'd int?t To hang her selfe O, me moste wofull theame. She now espide an hie and sturdie beame: Many staue liu'd to an vnpittied death, who might haue dyed sometimes with famed breath Yet doth she thinke what terror death would be and on her heart, imprints his Character: Faine would she die, yet first would pleased be with damned lust, which death could not deter O sinne (saies she) thou must be Natures slaue, In spight of Fate, goe to a pleasing graue. When I haue sin'd, send Ioue a thunder stroake and spare thy chosen tree, the harmlesse Oake. She thinkes againe, and sees nor time nor place, to quench the thirstines of her parched blood: Time still ranne on, with an auerted face, and nothing but her passions did her good. This thought confoundes her, and she is resoul'd In deathes bleake azure armes to be inuoul'd. Fates, you are women, saue your modesties: sheele kill her selfe, you neede but close her eies And like as when some suddaine extasie, seisth the nature of a sicklie man, When hee's discernd to swoune, straite by and by folke by his helpe confusedly haue ran, And seeking with their art to fetch him backe: so many throng, that he the ayre doth lacke, so Mirrha's thoughts confusedly did stound her, some adding c?fort, whilst the rest confound her Like to a fountaines head, so shew'd her head, from whence since passion first tooke hold of hir Two springs did run thorow each flowr-fil'd mead &amp; at her lips staid, where shee wisht Cynir Would so haue done: her face with teares run ore, Like Hebæs Nectar shew'd, spilt on heauens flore. for as the blomes in May the dewe drops beares, so Mirrha's cheeks look'd sprinkl'd with her tears Her haire, that with such diligence was vsde To be kemb'd vp &amp; did like clowdes appeare: Where many spangles, star-like were infus'd, To attend the lustre of so bright chaire, Whose beames like bright Arachnes web c?posed Taught Pallas a new enuie, now vnlosed, hiding her face, yet making it seeme rarer, as blazing Commets traine makes the star fairer Dispaire that teàcherh holy ones to die, when as affliction ministers her part: Had breathing now in Mirrha, and well nie, Like Venus, made her graspe a flaming heart. Cupid was borne at Etna, a hot sprite, Whose violence takes edge off from delight. For men deepe louing, oft themselues so waste, that proffer'd dainties, they want power to tast Digresse no farther least thou proue obsceane, but tell by this how Nurse had broke the dore, And trembling both through age and feare, Forgot the naturall sence she had before Yet with her out-cries from the shades of death, cald Mirrhas spright, who with vnwilling breath re-enters flesh, scorning to giue it grace, with wonted beautie that adorn'd her face. She tooke the haltar, and held vp her chin, chafing her temples with a violent heate: Making her soule returne with torments in, as it went out, being come vnto retrait, Nurse heau'd her trembling body on the bed, Where sinking as in graue, she seemed dead: Chast had my verse bin, blessed Mirrhas hap, if here my pen could write thy Epitaph. When hauing gotten ope her heauie eyes, life-mocking death, with a fresh crimson hew, she thus be spake: if there be sorceries, Philters, inchauntments, any furie new That can inspire with irrelegious fire, The brest of mortall, that vntam'd desire Possesseth me, and all my bodies merrit, Shewes like a faire house, haunted with a spirit. The foure and twentie windes are not so fierce, as what doth blow the fewel in my breast: Not the soft oyle, Appollo did disperse, on Phaitons brow, to keep his sun-beam'd crest From face of heauenly fires, could ought preuaile Gainst raging br?ds which my poore heart affaile scorch'd with materiall flames, wee soone do die and to purge sins, we imbrace purgatorie. But this a heate that nor in life or death, can render any humor but dispaire: Nor can it with the short cut of my breath, Take hence my shame, that shall suruiue mine heire Nor can the act (after tis done) content But brings with it eternall punishment, lesseneth the pleasure of the world to come, giues the iudge leaue, &amp; strikes the guiltie dumb The iealious nurse, did apprehend her straite, yet would extract the quintessence of all: And therefore childe (quoth she) vse no deceipt, but tel me freely whence these teares doe fall I am thy nurse, and from my aged brest Thou hadst thy second being, tell the rest. I doe coniure thee, by these siluer haires, which are grown white, the sooner in their cares If any orped witch of Thessalie, haue powre vpon thee, gentle-girle relate: Or if thou haue prophan'd some dietie, wee shall some misticke fires propogate. To attone with them or if with barbarous hand devoy'd of thy first chastitie thou stand: Vnfold to me: griefes vttered finde redresse: fires vndescern'd burn the more pittilesse. Or if the sunne of bewtie shoote at thee his fiery shafts, O tell me and the rather, Because thy confidence shal answer'd be, With this my childe Ile hide it from thy father As doth a dying man hold fast what so he grasps so she her feruent armes bout her Nurse claspes and nuzzels once more twixt those dugs her face whilst ore those Ilands flow salt teares apace. That word of father was like Persey's shield, to make the poore maid stone, now nurse doth threat Vnlesse she will in gentle manner yeeld, she would to morrow shew how in a heat She would haue made away her desperate life, and she must tell the man that forc'd that strife within her brest through feare she thus did frame and made her toung the trumpet of her shame. Her voyce halfe stopt with sighes (O fatal voice) pronounc'd these words, yet did the acc?ts faile: How blessed is my mother in her choise, How fully she with nature did preuaile. This said, her blushing face sinkes in her shroud like Cinthia muffel'd in an enuious cloud. When loe, the dying taper in his toombe, gaue darknes to it selfe and to the roome. Now had she time to waile, and well she might, Guiltie of sorrow, there might you haue seene: As glow wormes adde a tincture to the night, Glimmering in pallid fire, vppon some greene, mixt with the dew, so did her eyes appeare, Each goulden glance ioyn'd with a dewy teare, oft shut her eyes, like starres that portend ill, with bloody deluge, they their orbes did fill. The Nurse amated with the latter wordes, whose aged haires stood vp like siluer wire: Knew speech was vaine, where will the scope affords &amp; whispering softly, saies childe thy desire Ile put into thy armes, sleepe, seize thy head, Tis now nights noone, all but the stars seem dead, Our vanities like fire-works will ascend, Vntil they breake, vncertaine where to end, Neuer did mortall with a vicious thought, wish to bring vices Embrion to aforme: But still the prince of darknesse to them brought occasions fore-locke, which they off haue torne. Sin like a Cedar shadowes all our good: Whilst vertues bounded like a narrow flood. As see now, how the occasion of misfortune; Mirrha's much abus'd-mother did importune. Now came the time, of Ceres sacred rite, and Misteries, when all wiues young and olde Cloathed in vailes, all of transparent white, Kneele to her, and to the Attick priest vnfolde, The firstlings of the fiel'd wreath'd gilded corne, Chaplets of dill, pluckt in a blushing morne, And many such, nor may they husbands see, In nine daies, till they end their misterie. Now nurse was double diligent, watching her time and told old Cyniras a louely maide Sigh'd for him: and still with cupps of wine betwixt each word his pallat she assaide. Heated with wines, he bad the Nurse repaide, and bring to him the Maide that was so faire. Bacchus &amp; Venus, Wine and frolicke lust, are sworne to blood, and keepe togither must. Mirrha no sooner heard this glad reply, but as a poore bird long time in a snare, Ready for fammine and her woe to die, whom an vnskilful fouler vnaware hath guiuen freedome, to her foode doth hast, so Mirrha thought each houre an age was past: In her strict torment; but being scapt away, her woes forgot, she thinkes vppon her prey. And as she did ascend those staires to lust, in the midway, she heard her father speake: And nere lay partridge closer to the dust, at sound o'the Faulccons bell, then she too weak To encounter or resist: and feares are such, in loue by loue, that they enccrease loue much. Loue like to Monarkes, hath his state hie reared who euer wil be lou'd, where they are feared. To a hundred seueral passions she doth yeeld, and as we see in Autumne of the yere Some gallant oake stand ready to be feld, vppon whose ribs a hundred wounds appeare Forc'd by the brawnie armes of Hynds vnlithe, who workes a passage to the weeping pith: Vncertaine (though wind shaken) where to fall: so stood her mynd doutful of rest at al. Nurse opes the doore, and brings her to the bed the darkenesse of the night abated shame: And leaues her that must leaue her maiden head to the begetter of his owne defame, With faultring hams hauing got twixt the sheetes In fearefull lust this Prodegiæ meetes, He begs a kisse, then blusht she as he spake it, yet he must giue it, shee wants power to take it. Now trembling lay she by her fathers side, like silly doue within the Eagles gripe: Nor doth she vse soft shrikes as doth a bride, (I meane a maide) when as the fruite so ripe Of maiden-head, is forced from their wombe, Her fathers armes to her was as a tombe. she dead in pleasure, durst not shew her voice, least Cyniras should know this faire foule choice. But when that Cupid once had whetted her, she twines her lilly stalks about his necke: So clings young Iuie bout the aged oake there, Venus smile, but frowning Iuno checks. Their stolne delight no nuptiall tapers shone, No Virgin belt vntyed, but all vndone, the Athenian God, kindled no hallowed fires, darke was the night, suiting to their desires. The morrow came, toyled with wakes and lust, she leaues her father, when as the rising Sun Couering the easterne Pines and mountaine dust, spyed Mirrha from her couch of sin to runne. Then blusht he first, and backward would hafled And euer since in's rising hee's still red, Nere Turk as was at sicke blood more estrang'd, then Mirrha when her chastitie was chang'd. Oft would she leane against her fathers knees, &amp; tie his garter in a true loue's knot: And then vndoo't againe, as to shew she were vndone, yet he conceiu'd it note And woman like that, keep not secrets long, she shewd her loue in d?b shewes with out tung, her lust she knew (yet hardly it concealde) like Fayries Treasur's vanish'd if reueal'd. A third night came, darker then shores belowe, when Cyniras (father of feareful lust) Willing to see the soule that did bestowe So many pleasures on him (Ioue is iust) Did reach a taper, whose confusiue light, Strucke like a blasting at that horrid sight, The light fell from him loathing his defame, things senceles oft are mon'd, wh? men not shame At length with bloodie eye fixed on her, out of an Iuorie scabberd hanging by: He drew a monumental Semiter, Thinking with death that both their shames shold dye But night that oft befriended her with sinne, In her blacke wombe too, did her freedome win, For through the darke she slipt, and left her sire, to mourne his Fate, not execute his ire. Sped with her lust, and flying thence apace, in feares and trembling, feare doth giue vs eies: For saftie to the Gods, she lifts her face, &amp; her claspt hands to what she now not see's, loues browe was darke, Boetes had amaine Driuen his Oxen to the lower plaine. Phebæ fled heauen, her face no tincture beares, Because shee saw a deed, worthie her teares. The morning came, where yet the fatall print of Mirrha lay vpon the pillow: Cynix he Clog'd with distresse, a fathers cursse did hint, vpon that place of foule inchastitie, the sight of what we loath, breedes loathing more and vertue once renounc'd ingenders store, Leaue we him touz'd in care, for worldly wee, loue to leaue great men in their miserie. Seauen winters nights, she fled before the Moone (who knew the vnchaste act she had inforc'd) Through Arabie, in feare she posteth soone, To odorous Panchaia, whose confines diuorc'd Her fathers land: here grew all choicest fumes: That to Ioues temples often men presumes: and on his altars them accumulate, and how they first sprung, here thereof the Fate. Hebæ now banish'd from th' Aetherian boule vppon a feast day mongst the Gods aboue, Where twas made lawfull, all without controule, might freely drink it chanc'd the Queen of loue Whether she long'd, or enuied Hebæs starre, (Women are enuious, where they long for nectar) forc'd her to skinke so much, the iuice ran ore, so that Ioues drinke washt the defiled flore. With this he storm'd, that's Priests from altars flie streight banish'd Hebæ, &amp; the world did thinke To a second Chaos they should turned be, the clouds for feare wept out th' immortal drinke and on Panchaia there this Nectar fell, Made rich th' adiacent lands with odorous smell, and such rare spices to the shoares are giuen, as Ioue would thinke no Nectar were in heauen. There was a Satire rough and barbarous, pleasing his pallat at a trembling spring: Vnder a Beech with bowes frondiferous, though he had seene a nimph or rarer thing Then flesh and blood for in the calmed streame, He saw her eyes like stars, whose raies did gleame Boue Phœbus farre, and so amazed stood, as if she had bin Goddesse of that flood. and as you see a man that hath bin long Possessed with a furie of the shades: after some prayers and many a sacred song, with blessed signes; the euill spirit vades, so fell his rudenesse from him, and her shine, Made all his earthie parts pure and diuine. O potent loue, great is thy power be falne, That makes the wise mad, &amp; the mad man calme Thus he begins, fairer then Venus farre, If Venus be, or if she be tis thee: Louelie as Lillies, brighter then the starre that is to earth the mornings Mercurie: Softer then Roses, sweeter breath'd then they, blush't boue Aurora, better cloath'd then May. lipt like a cherrie, but of rarer taste, Deuine as Dian, and as fully chaste. Pardon my rude tongue, if I chance to erre, as Hermes selfe might erre being the God of Eloquence: for your bright eye doth beare all earthly blessings in a faire abode, Excuse me if I trip, I meane your weale, Error's no error, where tis done with zeale. Loue like materiall fires is made to flame: When tis supprest: with fanning Fires first came With this, the Maid (so took) hung down her head wondring that such a shape had such a tongue: able to steale her loue, had she not fled, and from his ardent gripes, her body wrung. Flying like Phebæ after strucken deere: and as he follow'd she fled more for feare. Zephire came foorth, to dally with her haire, while the poore Satire cried stay maide so faire But he on sudden like a subtill Snake, rould in a heape, shootes foorth himself at l?gth: and to his vigorous armes greedie doth take, his yeilding prey, won with his words not str?gth To be a woman, is by nature giuen, But to be constant, is a star, which heauen Hath seald on their sex forehead as a signe, That constancie in women is diuine. Thou didst deceiue me Mirrha, when I saide, thou flew'st for feare, thou gau'st me cause to fear and I might iustlie haue this gainst thee laide, thou wentst t'auide by pathes that were so nere Who begin, ill most often end in ill, and she that doth her first pure youth so spill In lawles lust though made a wife to one, Remaines like wax for each impression. But see the goodnesse of the Deities, who still with grace preuents our ill presage, This groue was hallow'd to no Hiadres, but chast Diana, who with violent rage Discending from her towre of Christalline, To keepe the place still sacred and diuine: against her rites, brought with her thereupon white Poplar from the banckes of Acheron: Then with a charme, that did her face eclips, And made her crescent quak, the iuice she powers Vpon the Satirs face, and prophane lipps, which quickly ouer all his body showers, Her borrow'd power of art being finished: (Deriued from Phœbus as her light) she saide, Nine-times the holy time, which spok will clere, all prophane matter, and this spake she there. Sleepe Poplar sleepe, that was the Satirs name, who had bin long a king within these woods, Since thou my sacred Groue, gan to prophane: a sleepe seize on thee, still as stigian floods, by Stix I vow the partiall destenies, Did they conspire, shold nere vnclaspe thine eies. haning thus said, the Satire vanisht so, as mens prospect that from a mirrour goe. I thinke (quoth she) accursed is this place, for heere the man, for whome I sorrow now, Heedelesse Acteon with immodest face, saw all our naked and did ouer-vewe: As men rich iuells doe, thinking there lies yet some rare vertue hidden from their eyes: And euen there quoth shee &amp; then did point, reuen'gd, I saw his hounds teare ioint from ioint. But since saies she, thou as a King didst reigne, and art a Trophey too of Dians power: Thus much the Goddesse of the floods doth deign wood to change thy shape, into a vertick flower. Then thrice three words, thrice striking charmed The ground did crannie, and there out of hand, appeared greene Poplar, younger then before, which bow'd the head &amp; dyan did adore. The palefac'd Mirrha sat like guiltie spright, fore the infernall iudge, yet did not see Diana great, for dull are mortalls sight, (and all inuisible is chastitie) But heard a voice as she was vanishing, saving defild maide, doost wonder at this thing O Mirrha ere my crescents beautie change, thou shalt be turn'd into a shape as strange. With this the verdant new sprung Poplar plant (moou'd with the winde) seemd to bow down the head as cheering Mirrha, who did comfort want being amaz'd at what Diana saide, Hauing recouer'd sence, she flies the place, For feare of Phebæs comming to the chace: to Saba land she hies, where all affraide, my muse shall sing the downfall of the Maide. Then first hung downe Poplar his heauie braine, for Mirrha's losse, whose loue brought him that And for he once in woods a King did raigne, a crowne hee still wear's, richly wrought with blew and yellow eke, as figures both of loue, Which Venus dropt downe him from aboue. Bacchus doth loue him, for in feasts of wine, She weares a poplar Garland mixt with vine. The leaden God of sleepe, on his iuice feede, the vertues of him, sundry doe declare, His suddain taste a heauinesse doth breede, and drownes in rest, sences opprest with care, In places farre remote, he loues to growe, And eke by riuers that runne thicke and slowe, where drowsilie this woodish demie God, with euerie gale of winde his head doth nod. Now to proceede after a small repose, that the accursed seede gan swell her wombe, wh? her drie brain, no more teares could expose, she weayting for a sad and heauie dombe. For often men offending, still doe feare, Though Ioue be farre off, yet his iudgements nere downe would she sit, and so vnfolde her moane, that Eccho sight hirs and forgot her owne Distressed twixt the teadiousnesse of life, and trembling feare of death, she thus began: For when we cease to be the crimes are rife, which youth committed, and before vs then. For aged memorie doth clasp't containe, Those shapes of sin, which hot blood held as vaine O cursed Fates quoth she, that brought to passe this prodegie twixt me and Cyniras. O leaue to leape for ioy, thou prettie childe, to Heare of Cyniras, or ile leaue rather: To speake of him, whose bed I haue defilde, &amp; made him proue thy Grandsire &amp; thy father Was I predestin'd to select no other, But fated for the sister and the Mother. of thee my babe, heauen here hath beene sinister the childe shall call his grandsire, son his mother sister Oft doe two Roses grow out from one stem, and one of them is full blowne fore the other, So fares it now with thee my virgin iem, whome nature would call sonne but shame saies brother Shall I not blush when thou art ripe, to gather The circumstances of who was thy Father, yes sure I shall, yet shame forgets all shame, Ile charge thy father of a heauenly name. But oh, I feare me least some Prodegie, the heauens agree, that I to light should bring: to fright ee'n the yron age, that chastitie might take example by my suffering. That I a monster-mother should be made, If soe, O ouer equall Gods, let Mirrha fade into some shape, worthy your high deuice, Pitty to me, would make Ioue seeme vnwise. Alter O Gods, death that is due to birth, nor let the dead repine, that I should see Eliziums blest shades, nor the men of earth annoided be with my impuritie, Let them enioy the fieldes, and learned Songes, Of hye brow'd Orphens, let the vuflesht thronges that haue deseru'd this, and much more be glad, my starres, my double life, and fate, are sad. You wearyed race of Danans vnblest girles, In vaine leaue off your vnwomb'd tubs to fill, &amp; with your teares that staynd y? Indyan pearles, Weepe out or Mirrha, and ere night you will at my sad story orebrim with your teares, Your whirle-poole vessells, which so many yeres return'd no interest, if you well deplore, you'le drowne in teares, or labour so no more. C?clude my fate, quicke you eternall counsell, or else I feare the nere-erturned dead Clad in the fearefull shapes of night and hell, will rise before the generall day be spred; and hurrie me in flesh to Acheron, To taste hels torture both in soule and bone: Then blast me thunderer in righteous ire, and I like Semele wil meete thy fire. The Gods to her last wish was tractable, her tongue percullist twice was as she spake: aire was her voice, and Mirrha now not able, to thanke the Gods, her ioynts in sender brake. Leaues were her locks, of golden haire bereau'd, her armes long boughes, deem &amp; be not deceiu'd tree gan she be, yet twixt her thing so staid, you could not say she was or tree or maide. First grew her hayre vp like the Summer Corne, or as a blazing starre, whose streames rise vpward &amp; being changd, fell leaues, that vp were borne, by the rude windes, yet had you but haue heard You'd sware, a sigh for Mirrha's transmigration Had beene decreed by all the windie nation. and euerie Autume, since a thing moste rare, The falling leaues, resemble Mirrha's haire. To barke her yuorie skin polisht congeald, each blew-rig'd current into melting sap, Her nailes to bolssome faire, &amp; what reueal'd with accents sad, the babe yet in her lap. Her fingers twigs, her bright eye; turn'd to gum Buried on earth, and her owne selfe the toombe. her sences gone, yet this sence did she win, to aye relent, the horror of her sinne. For euen as from a guilty man, that's pleading for remorse teares follow teares, as hoping to preuaile, So from this tree, (though now a sencelesse course) flowe pretious teares, as seemes she doth bewaile In death, with euer liuing teares, the act fore-done These Pius drops, made densiue by the sunne, are kept for holy vses, and the Mir, That so distilles, doth beare the name of her. The misbegotten babie, swels the tree, and loathing the defiled wombe sought vent: Those panges that mothers haue felt shee, and solemne sighes had issue, as they'd rent, and spoile the shape, she newly had assum'd, But wordes within the close bark were inhumbd Yet wept it out, as it to water would, Or seem'd it mockt Pactolus waues of golde. Till chast Lucina, whome the Poets giue, The mid-wiues power in producing creatures, by whose change we last die, and first doe liue, (be they not violent each) she that giues features Forme or takes away, makes foule or faire, Discending from her Spheare next to our ayre: with armes yspred, vppon the melting mir, brought diuine comfort downe from heau? with her Few wordes she spake, but euery sillable, of power to comfort the afflicted Ghostes: Or any other sencelesse thing make able, doe better deedes then those Alcides boastes, the tree streight craynes, &amp; springs forth the child who the first minut, though his countenance smild cryed out a maine, our first propheticke breath, showes our first houre, is mother to our death. The water Nymphes then caught him tenderly, who laid him streight on the enameled bankes, and bath'd him with his mothers teares, whereby they made him fairer, and in merry prankes The Ladies call a conuocation there, Some praise his nose, his lips, his eye, his eare, Some his streight fingers, whilst a fist doth sweare his verry breath yet smelleth of the mirre. Another wishes, oh for such a face! Nor can I blame her though she did wish so: For sure, were I a wench, t'had bin my case, for nature heere, made both her ioy and woe, And spight that (but herself) commendeth none, Of force must say, this was a rarer one Then either nature did, or ere shall make, whose life holdes vp her age, whose deathe's her wrack Eyes like two stars falne from their proper sphears as if they scorn'd the beaten pathes of heauen: Or enuying of beautie of the beares, showne firmer heere, and brighter then the seau? Such was he as was Cupid wont to be In pictures lim'd, and that they may agree, furnish the babe with winges and quiuer light, or from loues God, take wings, and quier quite. Nought may compare with Time in his swift race the babe ere while feeles now youths hot alarms And as in yeares, so beautious grew his face, that he is fit againe for Ladies armes: Nor Cupid now could wound more dames th? he That Venus who Captiues all, is not free From her own power, she loue's Adonis milde, That Mars doth storm, &amp; wish he were no childe Nor Paphos, Amathus nor fishie Gnide, delights she now to haunt, nor Etna now Burnes more then her, she roans the wood so wide after her game, that to his game doth bow. And will not heare or see, for eies and eares, If they her heare or see, their vse forbeares Yet she persues, and leaues her power vn euen on heauen &amp; earth, she loues him more th? heau? Oft would she say, and bathe those words in tears oh thou faire boy, wold God thou loudst like me but sure thou art not flesh, it well appeares, thou wert the stubborne issue of a tree, So hard thou art, then she a sigh would fet, and wish that Vulcan had not made his net, For boysterous Mars, shee'd fayner ha'bin sped with this choice floure, claspt in her yron bed. Shee'd nere haue blusht, th? she does make a vow though al the Gods of both worlds had th? seen She raveth that she euer lou'd til now, that she might worthily ha bin loues Queene. wel, wel (quoth she) thou hast reueng'd the spight which from my accurst Sons bow did fowly light On thy faire Mother, O immortall boy, Though thou be faire, tis I that should be coy. But stay my Muse in thine owne confines keepe, &amp; wage not warre with so deere lou'd a neighbor But hauing sung thy day song, rest &amp; sleepe preserue thy small fame and his greater fauor: His song was worthie merrit (Shakspeære hee) sung the faire blossome, thou the withered tree Laurell is due to him, his art and wit hath purchast it, Cypres thy brow will fit.
