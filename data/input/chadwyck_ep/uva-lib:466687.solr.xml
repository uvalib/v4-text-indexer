      <field name="fulltext">TO MARY. Ecton, June 1780. From flower to flower of every hue The Bee delights to stray, Collects around the honied dew, Then wings its flight away, Alike the Lily, and the Rose, With every meaner flower that blows In wild variety, Allure—yet soon the charm is o'er, Their sweets scarce tasted, please no more, They flourish fade and die. To many a fair, my vows I paid, By different beauties caught, But fleeting, the impression made, And passed, with passing thought; Then say, why thus content my breast No longer roams? Why lull'd to rest? My youth yet scarce begun. My Mary, best adored! confess! Virtue alone, gives happiness, Virtue, and thou, are one. WRITTEN AT BEVIS MOUNT, 1782. Whether I rest in peace, till life's decline, Within thy bowers, oh lov'd retreat! or stray Far from thy shades, my wandering steps away; To thee, the Bard thou shelterest, shall consign The meed most due, of this memorial line— Not formed by vulgar hands, in waving way Bend thy slope banks, and woods that dim the day. These elms, that o'er my head their branches join, A Hero planted, one whom conqu'ring Rome Had proudly crown'd.—And underneath the gloom Of yon old oak, a skilled magician sung: Oft at his call, these sunny glades among Thy guardian Sylphs, Belinda, sportive play'd, And Eloisa sigh'd in yon sequester'd shade. ON THE DEATH OF MY MOTHER. Clifton, 1790. Clifton, in happier hour, thy groves among I stray'd, in tuneful extacy beguiled, When fancy warbled wild her fairy song, And youth in hope's gay sunshine sweetly smiled. To youth, the dream of happiness I leave; Me, sharp experience of man's bitter doom Leads o'er the solitude of death to grieve, And breathe a prayer upon a parent's tomb. Spirit! I thank thee for each tender care, That train'd my infancy; the Babe the while Feeling no pang the Mother did not share, Giving no recompense beyond a smile! But yesterday, the pious office mine To steal the sharpness of thy pangs away, And in the feebleness of Life's decline, To age, that debt of infancy repay. Yet, while I mourn that mute the voice revered Which left its dying blessing on my head, And closed the watchful eye, that soothing cheer'd, And o'er life's onward way, a radiance shed. I seek the consolation heaven design'd, And may the God, who hears the mourner's cry, Fix as thy death, thy life upon my mind, That I like thee may live, like thee may die! Farewell, blest spirit! To the world I go, To trace the toilsome path, thy footsteps trod; And bid my children learn to look on woe, As chastenings of a Father and a God! SONNET TO WIELAND. Bard! while with eagle flight, thy vent'rous muse Blending at will, her artful harmonies, O'er poesy's wide range sublimely flies, Her pinions glittering with unborrow'd hues, Of power, new life and lustre to diffuse; Whether with seraph plume, she reach the skies Where Plato soar'd; or bright with magic dies Wing the wild course, the hypogriff pursues, Proud tilt and tournament, and paynim knight, Or Paladin to sing; or scatt'ring flowers O'er Shakespeare's tomb, she woo th'enchanting sprite, That tranced in fairy land, his youthful hours: Accept this tribute! nor disdainful, slight An offering, gather'd from thy cultured bowers. May, 1798. TO THE REV. PETER ELMSLEY. Elmsley! with thy lone hour the Grecian muse Holds nightly commerce, and to Isis' shore Brings the fair fruits the groves of Athens bore, When Plato, nurtur'd with Castalian dews, The bloom of fancy, gave, to moral truth: And now she leads her Bacchic choir along, To thee, forth pouring the full tide of song; All, daring Æschylus in fire of youth Feared not to utter! All of truer tone— More artful harmony—that sweetly floats Tempering the swell of Sophoclean notes,— To thee the strains where nature speaks alone And language breathes the echo of the heart When He, whom fancy, love, and pity crown'd Drew from his chord each passion's simple sound: These all are thine!—These to the world impart, But be it mine in this sequester'd bower, Here as I turn the page of memory o'er, To dwell on deeds, untaught by classic lore, And back recal thy kindness at that hour When, as the rumour reach'd thy distant way, That misery had sore bow'd us, thou wert seen,— As though thy foot had never absent been— Seen at our side, commission'd to allay That agony whose utterance had no tongue; And when methought o'er death we hopeless hung Thy look, thy word, thy faith, forbade despair And grief found language when a friend wept there. STAFFA AND IONA. Staffa I scal'd thy summit hoar, I pass'd beneath thy arch gigantic, Whose pillar'd cavern swells the roar When thunders on thy rocky shore The roll of the atlantic. That hour the wind forgot to rave, The surge forgot its motion, And every pillar in thy cave Slept in its shadow on the wave Unrippled by the ocean. Then the past age before me came When mid the lightning's sweep Thy isle with its basaltic frame And every column wreath'd with flame, Burst from the boiling deep. When mid Iona's wrecks, mean while O'er sculptured graves I trod Where time had strewn each mouldering aisle O'er Saints and Kings that rear'd the pile, I hail'd the eternal God. Yet Staffa, more I felt his presence in thy cave Than where Iona's cross rose o'er the western wave. TO HIS MAJESTY'S SHIP BARHAM, APPOINTED BY THE KING TO CONVEY SIR WALTER SCOTT TO NAPLES. Go forth, thou gallant Ship!—a King's command Has honour'd thee, in peaceful prowess sent, To bear along thy subject element The Northern Minstrel from his mournful land. Speed in proud safety, though tempestuous gales Through severed Continents around thee roar, Speed, where Health beckons to her Syren shore, And genial airs, that fan the Orange Vales, Him, who unlocks the heart, the Passions' Lord, Powerful alike to lead mankind along By linked sweetness of melodious song, Or the free force of his unfettered word: Him, who strikes truth from Fancy's fairy lyre: The skilful Moralist, whose latent art Charms while it chastens, and exalts the heart By generous feelings and heroic fire. A stranger, from his far and frozen clime, Goes forth to woo thy breath, Parthenope! A Stranger, yet by fame long known to thee. The world has rung of the Enchanter's rhyme; Thy realm has rung of him. His wide renown Gathers fresh glory as the years roll on. Who has not heard of dauntless Marmion? Of her whose charms illumed stern Scotia's crown? Of the wild witch's dark sublimity? Of one who swerved not from her hard career To save a sister; and the burning tear That gush'd through flame from Douglas' iron eye? Who has not thrill'd o'er the unbroken flow Of purest Poesy, that sweetly wound The hunter's horn lone Katrine's lake around, When through the Trossacks burst the antler'd brow? Bright Sun of Italy! soft Southern clime! Ye gales that breathe of health, refresh his frame! Not yet consummated his glorious aim; Forms yet unseen, the beauteous, the sublime, From his creative spirit, life implore— Then—gallant Ship!—ere long—exultant bear From soft Parthenope's reviving air, The Bard to Caledonia's joyful shore.— Not Britain thy return alone shall hail; For thee the Nations wait, and watch afar thy sail. W. S. Fair Mead Lodge, Epping Forest, 18 Nov. 1831. ON THE DEATH OF SIR WALTER SCOTT. Proem. I who erewhile with Hope's delightful strain To Italy's bright sun and syren bay, O'er the blue splendour of the midland main, Accompanied the Minstrel on his way, And preluded his glories yet to come, The golden close of Fame's unclouded day.— Ah! dire reverse! now breathe the funeral lay, And strew these fading flowers on Scott's untimely tomb. Mourn Abbotsford! Mourn Thou! far famed retreat! Where, picturing on the Tweed th'embattled crest, The great Magician raised his Gothic seat! Thou roof! whose hospitable rest Welcomed the stranger guest,— And Thou armorial Hall! Where the Bard, communing with chiefs of yore, Hung their proud weapons on his storied wall: Ye haunts! where once in happier hour Th' Enchanter led me to his secret bow'r, Receive my farewell word! Ne'er may the Sun behold an alien Lord Scott's sacred hearth profane! But, evermore, a Scott there hold th'ancestral reign! Harp of the North!—Death's ruthless stroke, Thy chord that witch'd the world has broke, And thou in Dryburgh's hallow'd gloom Liest silent on the Minstrel's tomb; Thy chord is broke, but ne'er shall die, The echo of his minstrelsy. Drawn by the magic of his rhyme, Wild, romantic, bold, sublime, Not Caledonia's sons alone, The race of her poetic zone, But in far Dryburgh's still retreat The pilgrims of the world shall meet: And tell of Him whose gifted lay Held o'er the heart resistless sway; Of Him, the painter of the mind, Of Him, whose portrait of mankind, The lights, the shades, the mingled strife, Each hue of many-colour'd life, In bold similitude display'd The living man that Nature made. Scott, thou didst trance in deep delight The summer day and winter night, Yet, Bard! thy harp had higher pow'r Than witcheries of the passing hour— Its tone could, like a Seraph's lyre, Draw from the breast each base desire; Could rouse the passions, yet controul; Could soothe, yet elevate the soul; And to the world's tired slave impart The freshness of thy feeling heart. Yet though thy lay had power to bind, In chain of sympathy, mankind, And on the universe imprest Each image glowing in thy breast; While o'er the world the spell was thrown Scotland! his heart was thine alone.— To thee the patriot passion given, Thy rocks, thy lakes, his earthly heaven. E'en when Italia's treacherous gale Lured to the Syren bay his sail, While round him breathed from every bower The fragrance of the orange flower, “Land of the mountain and the flood,” Thy image still before him stood; And when life's sunshine was o'ercast, Ne'er from his dream that vision past.— His prayer was heard—to view once more, While Death yet paused, his haunts of yore, Where Tweed his course romantic leads Mid Abbotsford's delightful meads; Or where the woods he planted spread Their grateful shadow o'er his head.— His prayer was heard—he sunk to rest Beneath that roof where life was blest,— Sunk in their arms whose ceaseless care Watch'd o'er a Father's silver hair, While his last look on them reposed, And Death in peace his eyelid closed.— He rests in peace; but Scotland! thou Low bent in sorrow o'er his brow,— Thou realm! that glories in his birth, Now, o'er him, in his native earth Raise in proud Dryburgh's hallow'd aisle The Northern Bard's sepulchral pile.— Yet not the sculptor's utmost art That to the rock can life impart, But Scott's imperishable page Shall spread his name from age to age. What needs it—where his relics lie— The pomp of idle eulogy? One word shall consecrate the stone, Immortal Scott, thy name, alone! W. S. Fair Mead Lodge, Epping Forest, 7 Nov. 1832. LINES SUGGESTED BY THE THIRD MEETING OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE, HELD AT CAMBRIDGE, IN JUNE, 1833. Britain now rests in peace; War's thunder roar Has past away. The flag which Victory bore From sea to sea, forgetful of the wave, Now idly hangs o'er Nelson's honoured grave; And that memorial mound, on Belgium's plain, Which proudly raised, o'er British heroes slain, Proclaimed immortal Wellington's career, Drops into dust, on harvest's golden ear. So rest perturbed world! no longer yield A laurel from thy blood embathed field; Where mad Ambition, with a Demon's hand, Spreads desolation o'er the unpeopled land; But thou, celestial Peace, thy olive rear That knows no taint of blood, no orphan's tear, And wreathe thy sons who league to bless mankind, To spread the conquests of the enlightened mind, The inert mass of matter to controul, And stamp on all the sov'reignty of soul. Go keen Observer! go, maturely taught, Thou dweller in a world with wonders fraught; Go, with a Herschel's glass heaven's concave sweep, Search in the sea the marvels of the deep, Pierce the dark womb, and bid the unclosing earth Reveal the day spring of her ancient birth, How nature fills with life her mighty frame, And rests her pillars based on central flame; Then mid the haunts of man thy search pursue, And to thy power the elements subdue; Chain, or let loose at will, the force of fire, Th'omnipotent slave, whose strength no labours tire, While his fierce spirit with dense steam combined Slow rolls in darkness on the loaded wind; Brings down its giant arm, or poised on high With fairy hands ten thousand looms supply; Shapes the obdurate metal, cleaves the stone— Gives to each art new forms, and powers unknown; At one swift whirl, with momentary stroke, Cuts the steel bar, and saws the gnarled oak; Swift as the mind conceives, or sound is heard, Imprints the image of each winged word: Frees the tall mast, forgetful of the sail, And navigates the deep without a gale; Or extricates hid treasures, and refines, Rude ores more precious than Golconda's mines; Drains subterranean floods, and pours their tide Subservient, down the mountain's channel'd side To fertilize the earth. Thus train'd thy mind A willing minister to serve mankind: Thou—not regardless of the voice of fame, Thou, then, shalt raise to high renown thy name, Like those who first convened The first Meeting of the British Association was held at York, in the year 1831. by science led, Where Ooze slow lingers on his silver bed, Beheld in renovated splendour rise York's ancient Fane, bright towering to the skies; Ere Buckland, from thy venerable seat Guided her followers to his learn'd retreat: The Second Meeting was held at Oxford, in the year 1832. To where Castalian Isis flows along, Through haunts whose echoes swell the Aonian song. Fair-structured Oxford! graceful beauty bends The gliding curve that down thy street descends, Where, either side from groves and ancient bowers Temples arise, and towers irradiate towers. How boldly soars thy vast Bodleian dome, The mental mine, the Muse's hallowed home; While brightly streaming through the gothic gloom Glow the warm hues that Reynold's forms illume; Yet would I fain, with pilgrim zeal explore Some sacred spot where Alfred mused of yore, There on the patriot King devoutly pause, The King who framed a nation's equal laws: On Freedom's base, firm fix'd the British throne And made the Sovereign and the subject one— Then let me rest amid those peaceful bowers Where Locke deep reasoning past his studious hours; And attic Addison, thy groves among, Smooth'd his pure prose more musical than song; A nation's morals with their taste refined And train'd to truths divine the public mind. But—I no more, may dwell on Isis praise.— High cultured Sedgwick, claims these votive lays; He leads where Science of celestial birth Came down to commune with a son of earth, With Bacon dwelt, and bade th' enlighten'd sage, Burst through the darkness of a barbarous age, Cast off the yoke that had enslaved mankind, Scatter the schoolman's cobwebs to the wind, Prepare the soil, uproot each noxious weed, And step by step, sow wisdom's fruitful seed. High priest of truth! When call'd to purer day Thy soaring spirit past from earth away, Prophet of knowledge, in the lonely cell Where youthful Newton mused, thy mantle fell. Hail honour'd Cambridge! Thou, from age to age Seat of the Bard, the Scholar, and the Sage! Hail stately domes! that scepter'd Queens endow,— Ye, that record the Monarch's death bed vow, Where o'er the porch the royal Founder stands, Or mitred Abbots cross their crosier'd hands; Resplendent piles! where Learning rears her throne, Not for the high born heir of wealth alone, But for some peasant youth, without a name, Who there builds up the column of his fame, And summon'd thence in fullness of his power Shall guide the council at the trying hour, Mature the laws, that British realms obey, And in his scale the fate of empires weigh. Thee too, Trinity. where hospitality imprest The seal of kindness on the stranger guest, How pass unsung! E'en here, while far away Amid my woodland wilds, I thoughtful stray; Before me yet, thy vast quadrangles spread, Thy pillar'd cloisters yet invite my tread, The long-drawn aisle of thy cathedral grove Where never noon-beam pierced the dark alcove, And Cam, that gliding on with slow delay Winds through the close mown lawn its waveless way. Nor can I e'er forget that peaceful hour When as the summer sun went down in power, And fringed with beams the veil whose splendor shrouds His setting in the pomp of purple clouds, I, passing on, the far famed chapel sought Where master skill th'unrivall'd wonder wrought, And freely o'er the gothic grandeur cast, A grace that all of human art surpast, Stamping light woven on the matchless roof The sportive fancies of a fairy's woof, As if an Ariel through the vault had flown And left his pinions imaged on the stone. While there I stood, and with unsated gaze Pursued the tracery's labyrinthine maze, All imperceptibly a seraph song Flow'd, and its echo wound the aisle along: It breathed the anthem that at daylight close Soothes the world-wearied spirit to repose, When the heart answers to the full voiced choir And hallow'd sounds celestial thoughts inspire. Onward I went, and in that solemn mood Hail'd the still spot where Newton's image stood, And robed in mental grandeur, beam'd around An added lustre on that classic ground. Interpreter of Nature! o'er thy head The day's last light, a saint-like glory shed, And rested on thy brow intensely fraught With keen intelligence and patient thought; Erect thy front, as one empower'd from high To look on nature with a master's eye: The obedient prism, resting in thy hand, Seem'd as awaiting thy supreme command, To draw the secret from the orb of day, And bringing down the beam dissect the ray. Thus the famed sculptor, with the rock at strife, Tamed the rude mass, and softening into life, Graved on the breathing stone a Newton's mind, While wisdom hail'd him wisest of mankind. Then in deep reverence, as the twilight closed And gradual darkness on thy form reposed, On thee, prophetic Sage! I awe struck gazed, Thee, whose pure hand the veil of nature raised When, heaven illumed, thy genius first displayed In the bright orb of dew that gems the blade, In ocean heaving to the moon its might, In each fix'd star, and planet's wandering light, In the terrestrial globe's unfelt career, And swift mutations of the Lunar sphere, How in all nature the same virtue reign'd, Alike sustaining, and alike sustain'd, And the vast sun, while worlds around him roll'd, Held by his central power, the whole control'd. Bright were the hours; 'twas summer's beauteous prime, When science call'd her sons from every clime, And mid the sacred haunts, where Newton taught Divinest truths, her distant votaries brought With Britain's chosen band. Yet, how renew The scene that o'er that day enchantment threw, When friend, met friend, and they who ne'er had known Each other's being, save by fame alone, At their first greeting proffer'd hand to hand, By science leagued in her fraternal band. In vain my numbers would at large rehearse All whose renown might dignify the verse, In vain re-echo Buckland's wide spread fame, And give new glory to a Sedgwick's name, Explore each path where Greenough's power presides, Where Babbage meditates, or Fitton guides, Or search the stores of Gilbert's cultured mind, Adorn'd by learning and by taste refined. How, here record what varied talents grace With added lustre Compton's ancient race? Yet—would I now,—were such the power of song Accomplish'd Roget's just renown prolong, Whose lucid lore man's heaven-built frame display'd, How “fearfully, how wonderfully made.” Fain would I dwell on Peacock's depth of thought Illustrating the truths that Leibnitz taught; And mark where Brewster's penetrating sight Measured each angle of refracted light, And through the undulating ether view'd How the bent beam its mazy course pursued. Admiring, we the lucid order own Of Nature's germs in Lindley's herbal shewn; Heaths which the Cape's luxuriant soil supplies, Bright flowers that bask beneath the Indian skies, O'er Persia bloom, or breathing on the gale In fragrance float down Yemen's spicy vale. Nor less his search unwearied brings to light Forms long entomb'd in subterraneous night, When, as o'er ages, ages slowly roll'd No vivifying sun had pierced the mould, Nor dew, nor vernal shower, nor later rain E'er dropt prolific on the pregnant vein; Where fossil ferns their giant fibres spread, And clung firm rooted in their native bed, When waved o'er northern soils, in years unknown, The tropic pine, now sculptured in the stone, And palms o'er Indian Oceans seen to soar. Spread their broad leaves, and swept the British shore. In what harmonious numbers, how impart, Whewell thy skill, and subtlety of art? That tracing to its source the central mould, Th'imprison'd crystal's genuine form unfold, And cleaving with sure hand the scales away, Bring out the beauteous gem in bright array; So Wollaston its covering cast aside, And gave to science an unerring guide. The Goniometer. Inventive Wollaston! thy touch refined Sprung from the keeness of th'unsated mind. Nature from thee her mysteries scarce concealed; And hadst thou longer lived had more revealed. Fain would I mention, where the billows sweep Wave after wave successive o'er the deep, How Lubbock views along th'Atlantic, glide The measured motion of the crested tide, From sea to sea the rolling mass explores, Ere the surge foam on Britain's rock-built shores— And Conybeare extoll? whose boundless range Traces from realm to realm, earth's mineral change. Him too the muse would honour, round whose brow Time's soft slow hand has wreathed a fleece of snow, Yet—who in age, as one new born to truth, With the bold step and buoyancy of youth Pursues his course—so Dalton met my view And science, him, her legislator knew, When to his mental eye, she first display'd The separate atoms in her balance weigh'd. Know we not Herschel, whose far echoed name Rests not its glory on a Father's fame? Beyond hereditary greatness, great— On him may now propitious gales await! On him who to a far and foreign strand, A willing exile from his native land, Steers boldly on and seeks that southern clime Where he by science led, with skill sublime, Shall tell each star whose individual light Beams through the darkness of the Afric night, And weigh the worlds that traversing the sky Reserve their secrets for his searching eye, While the bright Cross illumining the whole With peerless splendour decks th'antarctic pole. Is Faraday unknown to fame? around Whose brow Lutetia's sons their chaplet wound; Such, as erewhile on Britain's honoured shore In his triumphant spring, famed Davy wore, When his bold hand drew forth to brilliant birth, The unknown metal from reluctant earth; And raised the lamp, that bright with vital breath, Drove back the fiend, who fill'd the mine with death. Thou! from whose lip, the word that freely flow'd, With all a poet's inspiration glow'd, Lamented Friend! farewell! thou liest at rest! A world of wonders buried in thy breast! High aims were thine! All nature to explore, Make each new truth developed, gender more, And upward traced, through universal laws Ascend in spirit to the eternal cause. Such was thy ardent hope, thy views sublime, But ah! cut off in manhood's daring prime, Thou liest where genius leans upon thy tomb, And half eclipsed mourns thy untimely doom! Thus, Faraday, so crown'd in early hour, Another Davy, reascends in power.— Tis He, who nature's varying form discern'd, Condensed the gas and to a liquid turn'd: He, from the magnet's subterraneous force Th'electric currents traced, and mark'd their course; And while the slave of superstitious fear Sees in the Northern lights spear flash on spear, And blood-stain'd hosts, that horsed upon the wind With war's portentous horrours threat mankind, He views th'o'erburden'd Pole discharge its rays, Where the Equator drinks the solar blaze, Thence back receive, and flash in wavy flow, Innocuous lightenings o'er the world below. Can I pass o'er, as one to science known Thy willing toils enlighten'd Murchison; Whether thou pierce beneath the billowy robe, That by the Deluge cast, o'erspread the globe, Ere yet Jehovah moving in his might O'er chaos, spake—“Be light”—and there was light. Or where time graved on his sepulchral page The indelible impress of that early age, When the scaled Saurians stretch'd their hideous length And Mammoths labour'd with unwieldy strength. The muse sagacious Lyell! would record The course by thy advent'rous steps explored; Whether thou climb the Alps, or view below Through their ice-arch perpetual rivers flow; Or trace the gradual progress of decay, As time's soft footstep wears the rock away, And wastes the globe whose relics onward spread Pave the wide sea's unfathomable bed, Thence from their ocean cradle upward hurl'd Burst into light a renovated world; Or where earth heard thee of her age enquire When Auvergne answered from his realm of fire. And where past lavas, on past lavas lay, Volcanos, through volcanos, forced their way. Lyell! like thee to search that realm of flame, From Scotia's ice-capt heights her native came, Another Lælius with mild wisdom fraught, Simplicity of speech with depth of thought;— Twas he whose lucid lore so clearly shown To Hutton gave fresh glory not his own, Thou, Playfair! whose rich converse, day by day, Led me delighted round the Latian way; While all that Italy enchanting made, Sweet Arno's vale, or Tivoli's cascade, The flint that 'neath a Cæsar's footstep rang, Where Tully thunder'd or where Virgil sang: The dome high-poised in air, the beauteous bay Whose cliffs yet echo with the Syren's lay; When last we parted, on Vesuvius' cone I heard thee reas'ning mid its fiery zone: When next I sought thee, thou within thy bier Wert laid unconscious of a nation's tear. Mild-tempered sage! oh may my life's decline Mindful of thee! so pass serene as thine! Farewell! Ascend mid spirits of the blest! Thy last remains in peace on Calton rest. Still there remain, those who unwearied trace The countless host of heaven 'mid boundless space, Describe their orbits, and with powerful sway, Seem to direct the planets on their way, Guide the far wandering comet, and presage Its gradual progress to a distant age: Beyond the Galaxy's faint glimmer view Suns, Planets, Satellites their course pursue, Each in its sphere, and through the vast profound Wheel other worlds, and other Heavens around, Where stars on stars swift pouring down their light That never yet has beam'd on mortal sight, Circle with brightness the eternal throne, Where thou Jehovah! in thy glory, lone! Reign'st unapproachable.—Thus Newton view'd The Heavens, in measureless infinitude All bathed in floods of light—no barren void— All fill'd with life by blissful worlds enjoy'd; Thus Herschel, Robinson, and Airey raise From earth's low scene, man's heaven-illumin'd gaze, And as they teach—where sphere encircling sphere How myriad worlds in unconfused career, Round myriad worlds revolve, their voice to earth Proclaims the God, who gave creation birth. But—thou, in whom we love alike to trace The force of reason, and each female grace, Why wert thou absent? Thou, whose cultured mind, Smoothing the path of knowledge to mankind, Adorn'st thy page deep stored with thought profound With many a flowret cull'd from classic ground; While Cambridge glorying in her Newton's fame, Records with his, thy woman's honoured name, High gifted Somerville?— Here close the lay, Here gladly preluding that brilliant day, When thou, famed Brisbane, to thy native shore Where high Dunedin hears the ocean roar, And where the Parthenon from Calton's brow Looks o'er the northern Athens stretch'd below, Shalt, from far realms the sons of science lead From worldly views, and low ambition freed,— And there as nature's wonders they explore Bid them, her maker in his works adore; Tell them, that knowledge, not alone design'd To rouse, mature, invigorate the mind, Sublimer views can perfect, and impart Power to chastise, amend, exalt the heart, Rude passion tame, the moral sense refine, And lead from earthly wisdom to divine. 8th of December, 1833.</field>
